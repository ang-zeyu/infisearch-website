In Christé's flock let love be surely placed,   From Christé's flock let concord hate expel,   Of Christé's flock let love be so embraced   As we in Christ and Christ in us may dwell;     Christ is the author of all unity,     From whence proceedeth all felicity.    O sing unto this glittering, glorious king,   O praise His name let every living thing;   Let heart and voice, like bells of silver, ring   The comfort that this day doth bring;     Let lute, let shawm, with sound of sweet delight,     The joy of Christé's birth this day recite.                      _Francis Kinwelmersh, A.D. 1576._     SUNG TO THE KING IN THE PRESENCE AT WHITEHALL.   _Chor._--What sweeter music can we bring,               Than a carol for to sing          The birth of this our heavenly King?          Awake the voice! awake the string!          Heart, ear, and eye, and everything          Awake! the while the active finger          Runs divisions with the singer.    _From the flourish they come to the song._    Dark and dull night, fly hence away,   And give the honor to this day,   That sees December turn'd to May.    If we may ask the reason, say   The why and wherefore all things here   Seem like the spring-time of the year?   Why does the chilling winter's morn   Smile like a field beset with corn?   Or smell like to a mead new-shorn,   Thus on the sudden? Come and see   The cause why things thus fragrant be:   'Tis He is born whose quickening birth   Gives life and lustre public mirth   To heaven and the under-earth.  _Chor._--We see Him come, and know Him ours,          Who with His sunshine and His showers          Turns all the patient ground to flowers.           The darling of the world is come,          And fit it is we find a room          To welcome Him. The nobler part          Of all the house here is the heart.  _Chor._--Which we will give Him; and bequeath          This holly and this ivy wreath,          To do Him honor, who's our King,          And Lord of all this revelling.                      _Robert Herrick._     AND THEY LAID HIM IN A MANGER.     Happy crib, that wert alone   To my God, bed, cradle, throne!   Whilst thy glorious vileness I   View with divine fancy's eye,   Sordid filth seems all the cost,   State, and splendor, crowns do boast.    See heaven's sacred majesty   Humbled beneath poverty;   Swaddled up in homely rags   On a bed of straw and flags!   He whose hands the heavens displayed,   And the world's foundation laid,   From the world's almost exiled,   Of all ornaments despoiled.   Perfumes bathe Him not, new-born,   Persian mantles not adorn;   Nor do the rich roofs look bright   With the jasper's orient light.   Where, O royal Infant, be   Th' ensigns of Thy majesty;   Thy Sire's equalizing state;   And Thy sceptre that rules fate?   Where's Thy angel-guarded throne,   Whence Thy laws Thou didst make known,   Laws which heaven, earth, hell, obeyed?   These, ah! these aside He laid;   Would the emblem be--of pride   By humility outvied?                      _Sir Edward Sherburne._     THE BURNING BABE.     As I in hoary winter's night stood shivering in the snow,   Surprised I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow;   And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,   A pretty babe all burning bright did in the air appear,   Who, scorchéd with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed,   As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears         were fed.   Alas! quoth he, but newly born in fiery heats I fry,   Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I.   My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns:   Love is the fire and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns:   The fuel justice layeth on, and mercy blows the coals;   The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defiléd souls;   For which, as now on fire I am, to work them to their good,   So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.   With that he vanish'd out of sight and swiftly shrunk away.   And straight I calléd unto mind that it was Christmas Day.                      _Robert Southwell._     CHRIST'S NATIVITY.     Awake, glad heart! get up and sing!   It is the birthday of thy King.               Awake! awake!               The sun doth shake   Light from his locks, and, all the way   Breathing perfumes, doth spice the day.    Awake! awake! hark how th' wood rings,   Winds whisper, and the busy springs               A concert make!               Awake! awake!   Man is their high-priest, and should rise   To offer up the sacrifice.    I would I were some bird or star   Fluttering in woods, or lifted far               Above this inn,               And road of sin!   Then either star or bird should be   Shining or singing still to Thee.    I would I had in my best part   Fit rooms for Thee! or that my heart               Were so clean as               Thy manger was!   But I am all filth, and obscene;   Yet, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make clean.    Sweet Jesu! will then. Let no more   This leper haunt and soil Thy door!               Cure him, ease him,               O release him!   And let once more, by mystic birth,   The Lord of life be born in earth.                      _Henry Vaughan._     AN ODE ON THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR.     In numbers, and but these few,   I sing Thy birth, O Jesu!   Thou pretty baby, born here   With sup'rabundant scorn here:   Who, for Thy princely port here,           Hadst for Thy place           Of birth a base   Out-stable for Thy court here.    Instead of neat enclosures   Of interwoven osiers,   Instead of fragrant posies   Of daffodils and roses,   Thy cradle, kingly stranger,           As gospel tells,           Was nothing else   But here a homely manger.    But we with silks not crewels,   With sundry precious jewels,   And lily work will dress Thee;   And, as we dispossess Thee   Of clouts, we'll make a chamber,           Sweet babe, for Thee           Of ivory   And plaster'd round with amber.    The Jews they did disdain Thee,   But we will entertain Thee   With glories to await here   Upon Thy princely state here;   And, more for love than pity,           From year to year           We'll make Thee here   A free-born of our city.                      _Robert Herrick._     WHO CAN FORGET?     Who can forget--never to be forgot--     The time, that all the world in slumber lies,   When, like the stars, the singing angels shot     To earth, and heaven awaked all his eyes     To see another sun at midnight rise   On earth? Was never sight of pareil fame   For God before, man like himself did frame,   But God himself now like a mortal man became.    A child He was, and had not learnt to speak,     That with His word the world before did make;   His mother's arms Him bore, He was so weak,     That with one hand the vaults of heaven could shake;     See how small room my infant Lord doth take,   Whom all the world is not enough to hold!   Who of His years or of His age hath told?   Never such age so young, never a child so old.    And yet but newly He was infanted,     And yet already He was sought to die;   Yet scarcely born, already banished;     Not able yet to go, and forced to fly:     But scarcely fled away, when by and by   The tyrant's sword with blood is all defiled,   And Rachel, for her sons, with fury wild,   Cries, \"O thou cruel king, and O my sweetest Child!\"    Egypt His nurse became, where Nilus springs,     Who, straight to entertain the rising sun,   The hasty harvest in his bosom brings;     But now for drought the fields were all undone,     And now with waters all is overrun:   So fast the Cynthian mountains pour'd their snow,   When once they felt the sun so near them glow,   That Nilus Egypt lost, and to a sea did grow.    The angels carolled loud their song of peace;     The cursed oracles were strucken dumb;   To see their Shepherd the poor shepherds press;     To see their King, the kingly sophies[S] come;     And them to guide unto his Master's home,   A star comes dancing up the orient,   That springs for joy over the strawy tent,   Where gold, to make their prince a crown, they all present.                      _Giles Fletcher._   FOOTNOTE:  [S] Wise men.     THE CHILD JESUS.  A CORNISH CAROL.     Welcome that star in Judah's sky,     That voice o'er Bethlehem's palmy glen!   The lamp far sages hailed on high,     The tones that thrilled the shepherd men:   Glory to God in loftiest heaven!     Thus angels smote the echoing chord;   Glad tidings unto man forgiven,     Peace from the presence of the Lord.    The Shepherds sought that birth divine,     The Wise Men traced their guided way;   There, by strange light and mystic sign,     The God they came to worship lay.   A human Babe in beauty smiled,     Where lowing oxen round Him trod:   A maiden clasped her awful Child,     Pure offspring of the breath of God.    Those voices from on high are mute,     The star the Wise Men saw is dim;   But hope still guides the wanderer's foot,     And faith renews the angel hymn:   Glory to God in loftiest heaven!     Touch with glad hand the ancient chord;   Good tidings unto man forgiven,     Peace from the presence of the Lord.                      _Robert Stephen Hawker._     LONG AGO.     In the bleak mid-winter     Frosty wind made moan,   Earth stood hard as iron,     Water like a stone;   Snow had fallen, snow on snow,     Snow on snow,   In the bleak mid-winter     Long ago.    Our God, heaven cannot hold Him,     Nor earth sustain;   Heaven and earth shall flee away     When He comes to reign:   In the bleak mid-winter     A stable-place sufficed   The Lord God Almighty,     Jesus Christ.    Enough for Him whom cherubim     Worship night and day,   A breastful of milk     And a mangerful of hay;   Enough for Him whom angels     Fall down before,   The ox and ass and camel     Which adore.

What can I give Him,     Poor as I am?   If I were a shepherd,     I would bring a lamb;   If I were a wise man,     I would do my part:   Yet what I can I give Him,     Give my heart.                      _Christina G. Rossetti._     [Illustration: \"What Can I Give Him?\"]     STAR OF BETHLEHEM.     When marshalled on the nightly plain   The glitt'ring host bestud the sky,   One star alone of all the train   Can fix the sinner's wandering eye.   Hark! hark! to God the chorus breaks   From ev'ry host, from ev'ry gem;   But one alone the Saviour speaks,--   It is the Star of Bethlehem!    Once on the raging seas I rode;   The storm was loud, the night was dark;   The ocean yawned, and rudely blew   The wind that tossed my found'ring bark.   Deep horror then my vitals froze;   Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem,   When suddenly a star arose,--   It was the Star of Bethlehem!    It was my guide, my light, my all;   It bade my dark forebodings cease;   And through the storm and danger's thrall,   It led me to the port of peace.   Now safely moored, my perils o'er,   I'll sing first in night's diadem,   Forever and forever more,--   The Star, the Star of Bethlehem!                      _Henry Kirke White._     NO ROOM.     Foot-sore and weary, Mary tried   Some rest to seek, but was denied.   \"There is no room,\" the blind ones cried.    Meekly the Virgin turned away,   No voice entreating her to stay;   There was no room for God that day.    No room for her, round whose tired feet   Angels are bowed in transport sweet   The mother of their God to greet.    No room for Him in whose small hand   The troubled sea and mighty land   Lie cradled like a grain of sand;    No room, O Babe Divine! for Thee   That Christmas night; and even we   Dare shut our hearts and turn the key.    In vain Thy pleading baby cry   Strikes our deaf souls; we pass Thee by,   Unsheltered 'neath the wintry sky.    No room for God! O Christ, that we   Should bar our doors, nor ever see   Our Saviour waiting patiently.    Fling wide the doors! Dear Christ, turn back!   The ashes on my hearth lie black--   Of light and warmth a total lack.    How can I bid Thee enter here   Amid the desolation drear   Of lukewarm love and craven fear?    What bleaker shelter can there be   Than my cold heart's tepidity--   Chilled, wind-tossed, as the winter sea?    Dear Lord, I shrink from Thy pure eye,   No home to offer Thee have I;   Yet in Thy mercy pass not by.                      _Agnes Repplier._     ON CHRISTMAS DAY.     Assist me, Muse divine! to Sing the Morn   On which the Saviour of Mankind was born;   But oh! what Numbers to the Theme can rise?   Unless kind Angels aid me from the Skies!   Methinks I see the tunefull Host descend,   And with officious Joy the Scene attend!   Hark, by their Hymns directed on the Road,   The Gladsome Shepherds find the nascent God!   And view the Infant conscious of his Birth,   Smiling bespeak Salvation to the Earth!     For when th' important Æra first drew near   In which the great Messiah should appear;   And to accomplish his redeeming Love;   Beneath our Form should every Woe sustain,   And by triumphant Suffering fix his Reign,   Should for lost Man in Tortures yield his Breath   Dying to save us from eternal Death!   Oh mystick union!--salutary Grace!   Incarnate God our Nature should embrace!   That Deity should stoop to our Disguise!   That man recover'd should regain the Skies!   Dejected Adam! from thy grave ascend,   And view the Serpent's Deadly Malice end,   Adorning bless th' Almighty's boundless Grace   That gave his son a Ransome for thy Race!   Oh never let my Soul this Day forget,   But pay in gratefull praise the annual Debt.            _From a manuscript volume, written by George Washington._     THE HEAVENLY CHOIR.     What sudden blaze of song     Spreads o'er th' expanse of heaven?   In waves of light it thrills along,     Th' angelic signal given--   \"Glory to God!\" from yonder central fire   Flows out the echoing lay beyond the starry quire;    Like circles widening round     Upon a clear blue river,   Orb after orb, the wondrous sound     Is echoed on forever;   \"Glory to God on high, on earth be peace,   And love toward men of love--salvation and release.\"    Yet stay, before thou dare     To join that festal throng;   Listen and mark what gentle air     First stirred the tide of song;   'Tis not, \"the Saviour born in David's home,   To whom for power and health obedient worlds should come:\"    'Tis not \"the Christ the Lord:\"--     With fix'd adoring look   The choir of angels caught the word,     Nor yet their silence broke;   But when they heard the sign, where Christ should be,   In sudden light they shone and heavenly harmony.    Wrapped in His swaddling-bands,     And in His manger laid,   The hope and glory of all lands     Is come to the world's aid:   No peaceful home upon His cradle smiled,   Guests rudely went and came where slept the royal Child.    But where Thou dwellest, Lord,     No other thought should be;   Once duly welcomed and adored,     How should I part with Thee?   Bethlehem must lose Thee soon, but Thou wilt grace   The single heart to be Thy pure abiding-place.    Thee, on the bosom laid     Of a pure virgin mind,   In quiet ever, and in shade,     Shepherd and sage may find;   They who have bow'd untaught to nature's sway,   And they who follow truth along her star-paved way.    The pastoral spirits first     Approach Thee, Babe divine,   For they in lowly thoughts are nursed,     Meet for Thy lowly shrine:   Sooner than they should miss where Thou dost dwell,   Angels from heaven will stoop to guide them to Thy cell.    Still, as the day comes round     For Thee to be revealed,   By wakeful shepherds Thou art found,     Abiding in the field.   All through the wintry heaven and chill night air,   In music and in light Thou dawnest on their prayer.    O faint not ye for fear--     What though your wandering sheep,   Reckless of what they see and hear,     Lie lost in wilful sleep?   High heaven in mercy to your sad annoy   Still greets you with glad tidings of immortal joy.    Think on th' eternal home     The Saviour left for you;   Think on the Lord most holy, come     To dwell with hearts untrue:   So shall ye tread untired His pastoral ways,   And in the darkness sing your carol of high praise.                      _John Keble._     _The Wassail-Bowl._     \"Wassail, wassail, all over the town;   Our toast it is white, our ale it is brown,   Our bowl it is made of the mapling tree;   With the wassailing bowl we will drink to thee.\"                      _Old Carol._     WASSAIL.     Give way, give way, ye gates, and win   An easy blessing to your bin   And basket, by our entering in.    May both with manchet[T] stand replete,   Your larders, too, so hung with meat,   That though a thousand thousand eat,    Yet ere twelve moons shall whirl about   Their silvery spheres, there's none may doubt   But more's sent in than was served out.    Next, may your dairies prosper so   As that your pans no ebb may know;   But if they do, the more to flow,    Like to a solemn, sober stream,   Banked all with lilies, and the cream   Of sweetest cowslips filling them.    Then may your plants be pressed with fruit,   Nor bee or hive you have be mute,   But sweetly sounding like a lute.    Last, may your harrows, shares, and ploughs,   Your stacks, your stocks, your sweetest mows,   All prosper by your virgin vows.    Alas! we bless, but see none here,   That brings us either ale or beer;   In a dry house all things are near.    Let's leave a longer time to wait,   Where rust and cobwebs bind the gate;   And all live here with needy fate;    Where chimneys do forever weep   For want of warmth, and stomachs keep   With noise the servants' eyes from sleep.    It is in vain to sing or stay   Our free feet here, but we'll away;   Yet to the Lares this we'll say:    The time will come when you'll be sad,   And reckon this for fortune bad,   T' have lost the good ye might have had.                      _Robert Herrick._   FOOTNOTE:  [T] White bread.     INVITATION À FAIRE NOËL.  (FROM THE FRENCH OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY.)     Hail, good Masters, let us bide,   Hither come from travel wide,                 This Christmas-tide.   Hearken, give us bed and cheer,   We are weary, life is dear                 This day o' the year!   God send ye joy and peace on earth,   Who broach good cheer for Christé's birth.    Masters, an ye make no feast:   Spicéd ale and meat of beast,                 Nor laugh the least:   If ye fill not pantries high   With bread, and fish, and mammoth pie,                 And sweets, pardie!--   God ordains no peace on earth   To ye who fast at Christé's birth.    Masters, it is writ of old   Who fill the fire for Christmas cold                 And wassail hold,   Shall have of food a double store   And ruddy-blazing ingle roar                 Forevermore.   God sends the peace of heaven and earth   To men who carol Christé's birth.    O Masters! let nor hate nor spite   Mar the tongue of any wight                 'Twixt night and night.   _Botun, batun_--belabor well   Churls who sleep through matin bell                 And no soothe tell.   God will forfeit peace on earth   If men fall out at Christé's birth.    Christmas tipples every wine,   English, French, and Gascon fine                 And Angevine;   Clinks with neighbor and with guest,   Empties casks with gibe and jest--                 The year's for rest!   God sends to men the joy of earth   Who broach good cheer for Christé's birth.    But hearken, Masters, ere ye drink   While yet the bubbles boil and wink                 At the brink;   Ere ye lift the pot aloft,   Merrily wave it, laughing oft,                 With hood well doft.
