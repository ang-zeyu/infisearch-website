He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to writing.  In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books, many of which are among the very best of English literature, and some of which are still in print.  Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories.  He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work, he never knew what he was going to write.  He certainly was a literary genius.  \"The Mission in Africa\" was published in 1845, the twenty-second book to flow from Marryat's pen.  This e-text was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson, and was reformatted in 2003, and again in 2005.  ________________________________________________________________________  THE MISSION IN AFRICA, BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE EXPEDITION.  It was in the autumn of the year 1828, that an elderly and infirm gentleman was slowly pacing up and down in a large dining-room.  He had apparently finished his dinner, although it was not yet five o'clock, and the descending sun shone bright and warm through the windows, which were level with the ground, and from which there was a view of a spacious park, highly ornamented with old timber.  He held a newspaper in one hand, and had the other behind his back, as if for support, for he was bent forward, and looked very feeble and emaciated.  After pacing for some time, he sat down in an easy chair and remained in deep thought, holding the newspaper in both his hands.  This old gentleman's name was Sir Charles Wilmot.  He had in early life gone out to India as a writer, and after remaining there for a few years, during which he had amassed a handsome fortune, was advised to leave the country for a time on account of his health.  He returned to England on furlough, and had not been there more than six months when the death, without issue, of his eldest brother, Sir Henry Wilmot, put him in possession of the entailed estates and of the baronetcy.  This decided him not to return to India for his wife and three daughters, whom he had left out there, but to write, desiring them to return home by the first ship.  The reply which he received was most painful: his wife and two of his daughters had been carried off by the cholera, which had been very fatal during the previous rainy season. His remaining daughter was about to sail, in obedience to his wishes, in the _Grosvenor_ East-Indiaman, under the care of Colonel and Mrs James, who were near connexions.  This was a heavy blow with which it pleased God to visit him in his prosperity, and was almost a total wreck of all his hopes and anticipations.  But he was a good man and a religious one, and he bowed in humility to the dispensation, submitting with resignation to his loss, and still thankful to Heaven that it had graciously spared one of the objects of his affections to console him, and to watch his declining years.  Sir Charles Wilmot took possession of the family mansion and estate in Berkshire, in which he was still residing at the time that our history commences.  By degrees he became more resigned, and waited with anxiety for the return of his only daughter, who now seemed more dear to him than ever.  He employed himself in making preparations for her reception, fitting up her apartments in the Oriental style which she had been accustomed to, and devising every little improvement and invention which he thought would give pleasure to a child of ten years old.  But it pleased Heaven that Sir Charles should be more severely chastised: the _Grosvenor's_ time of arrival had elapsed, and still she was not reported in the Channel; week after week of anxiety and suspense passed slowly away, and the East-India ship did not make her appearance. It was supposed that she had been captured by the enemy, but still no tidings of her capture were received.  At length, however, this state of anxiety and doubt was put an end to by the dreadful intelligence that the ship had been wrecked on the east coast of Africa, and that nearly the whole of the crew and passengers had perished.  Two men belonging to her had been brought home by a Danish East-Indiaman, and shortly after the first intelligence, these men arrived in London, and gave a more particular detail of what had occurred.  Sir Charles, in a state of feverish anxiety, as soon as he heard of their arrival, hastened up to town to question these men; and the result of his interrogatories fully convinced him that he was now quite bereaved and childless.  This was the last blow and the most severe; it was long before he could resign himself to the unsearchable dispensations of Providence; but time and religion had at last overcome all his repining feelings,--all disposition to question the goodness or wisdom of his Heavenly Father, and he was enabled to say, with sincerity, \"Not my will, but thine, be done.\"  But although Sir Charles was thus left childless, as years passed away, he at last found that he had those near to him for whom he felt an interest, and one in particular who promised to deserve all his regard. This was his grand-nephew, Alexander Wilmot, who was the legal heir to the title and entailed property,--the son of a deceased nephew, who had fallen during the Peninsular war.  On this boy Sir Charles had lavished those affections which it pleased Heaven that he should not bestow upon his own issue, and Alexander Wilmot had gradually become as dear to him as if he had been his own child.  Still the loss of his wife and children was ever in his memory, and as time passed on, painful feelings of hope and doubt were occasionally raised in Sir Charles's mind, from the occasional assertions of travellers, that all those did not perish who were supposed so to do when the _Grosvenor_ was wrecked, and that, from the reports of the natives, some of them and of their descendants were still alive.  It was a paragraph in the newspaper, containing a renewal of these assertions, which had attracted the attention of Sir Charles, and which had put him in the state of agitation and uneasiness in which we have described him at the opening of this chapter.  We left him in deep and painful thought, with the newspaper in his hands.  His reveries were interrupted by the entrance of Alexander Wilmot, who resided with him, being now twenty-two years of age, and having just finished his college education.  Alexander Wilmot was a tall, handsome young man, very powerful in frame, and very partial to all athletic exercises; he was the best rower and the best cricketer at Oxford, very fond of horses and hunting, and an excellent shot; in character and disposition he was generous and amiable, frank in his manner, and obliging to his inferiors.  Every one liked Alexander Wilmot, and he certainly deserved to be liked, for he never injured or spoke ill of anybody.  Perhaps his most prominent fault was obstinacy; but this was more shown in an obstinate courage and perseverance to conquer what appeared almost impossible, and at the greatest risk to himself; he was of that disposition that he would hardly get out of the way of a mad bull if it crossed his path, but risk his life probably, and to no purpose; but there is no perfection in this world, and it was still less to be expected in a young man of only twenty-two years of age.  \"Well, uncle, I've conquered him,\" said Alexander, as he came into the room, very much heated with exercise.  \"Conquered whom, my boy?\" replied Sir Charles.  \"The colt; I've backed him, and he is now as gentle as a lamb; but he fought hard for two hours at least.\"  \"Why should you run such risk, Alexander, when the horsebreaker would have broke him just as well?\"  \"But not so soon, uncle.\"  \"I did not know that you were in such want of a horse as to require such hurry; I thought you had plenty in the stable.\"  \"So I have, uncle, thanks to you, more than I can use; but I like the pleasure--the excitement.\"  \"There you state the truth, my dear Alexander; when you have lived as long as I have, you will find more pleasure in quiet and repose,\" replied Sir Charles, with a heavy sigh.  \"Something has disturbed you, my dear uncle,\" said Alexander, going up to Sir Charles and taking his hand; \"what is it, sir?\"  \"You are right, Alexander; something has unsettled me, has called up painful feelings and reminiscences; it is that paragraph in the newspaper.\"  Alexander was now as subdued almost as his uncle; he took a chair and quietly read the paragraph.  \"Do you think that there is any foundation for this, my dear sir?\" said he, after he had read it.  \"It is impossible to say, my dear boy; it may be so, it has often been asserted before.  The French traveller Le Vaillant states that he received the same information, but was prevented from ascertaining the truth; other travellers have subsequently given similar accounts.  You may easily credit the painful anxiety which is raised in my mind when I read such a statement as this.  I think I see my poor Elizabeth, the wife or slave to some wild savage; her children, merciful Heaven! my grandchildren, growing up as the brutes of the field, in ignorance and idolatry.  It is torture, my dear Alexander--absolute torture, and requires long prayer and meditation to restore my mind to its usual tone, and to enable me to bow to the dispensations of the Divine will.\"  \"Although I have long been acquainted with the general statement, my dear uncle, respecting the loss of the ship, I have never yet heard any such details as would warrant this apprehension of yours.  It is generally supposed that all perished, perished indeed most miserably, except the few men who made their way to the Cape, and returned to England.\"  \"Such was the supposition, my dear boy, but subsequent reports have to a certain degree"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21555"],["title","The Mission; or Scenes in Africa (#1)"],["body"," it, and there is reason to believe that all did not perish who were accounted as dead.  If you have nothing particularly to engage you at this moment, I will enter into a detail of what did occur, and of the proofs that the fate of a large portion, among which that of your aunt Elizabeth, was never ascertained.\"  \"If it will not be too painful to you, my dear uncle, I will most gladly hear it.\"  \"I will not dwell longer upon it than is necessary, Alexander; believe me the subject is too distressing, but I wish you to know it also, and then to give me your opinion.  You are of course aware that it was on the coast of Caffraria, to the southward of Port Natal, that the _Grosvenor_ was wrecked.  She soon divided and went to pieces, but by a sudden--I know not that I can say a _fortunate_--change of wind, yet such was the will of Heaven,--the whole of the crew and passengers (with the exception of sixteen who had previously attempted to gain the shore by a hawser, and one man who was left on board in a state of intoxication) were all safely landed, even to the little children who were coming home in the vessel; among whom was my poor Elizabeth.\"  Alexander made no observation when Sir Charles paused for a while: the latter then continued:--  \"By the time that they had all gained the shore, the day was far spent; the natives, who were of the Caffre race, and who had been busy in obtaining all the iron that they could from the mainmast, which had drifted on shore, left the beach at dark.  The wretched sufferers lighted fires, and having collected some casks of beef and flour, and some live stock, they remained on the rocks daring that night.  The next morning the captain proposed that they should make their way to Cape Town, the Dutch settlement, to which they all unanimously consented; certainly a most wild proposition, and showing very little judgment.\"  \"Could they have done otherwise, my dear uncle?\"  \"Most certainly; they knew that they were in a country of lawless savages, who had already come down and taken by force everything that they could lay their hands upon.  The captain calculated that they would reach Cape Town in sixteen or seventeen days.  How far his calculation was correct, is proved by the fact that those who did reach it at last were one hundred and seventeen days on their journey.  But even admitting that the distance could have been performed in the time stated by the captain, the very idea of attempting to force their way through a country inhabited by savage people, with such a number of helpless women and children, and without any arms for their defence, was indeed an act of folly and madness, as it eventually proved.\"  \"What then should have been their plan?\"  \"Observe, Alexander, the ship was wrecked not a cable's length from the shore, firmly fixed upon a reef of rocks upon which she had been thrown; the water was smooth, and there was no difficulty in their communication.  The savages, content with plundering whatever was washed on shore, had to the time of their quitting the rocks left them uninjured.  They might have gone on board again, have procured arms to defend themselves and the means of fortifying their position against any attempt of the savages, who had no other weapons but assaguays or spears, and then might have obtained the provisions and other articles necessary for their support.  Armed as they might have been, and numerous as they were, for there were one hundred and fifty souls on board at the time of the wreck, they might have protected themselves until they had built boats or small vessels out of the timber of the wreck; for all their carpenters and blacksmiths were safely landed on shore with them.  By taking this course they might have coasted along shore, and have arrived without difficulty at the Cape.\"  \"Most certainly, sir, it would have been the most judicious plan.\"  \"The captain must have been very deficient in judgment to have acted as he did.  He had everything to his hand--the means--the men to build the boats--provisions, arms, sails, and cordage, and yet he threw all these chances away, and attempted to do what was impossible.\"  \"He was not one of those who were saved, I believe, sir?\"  \"No, he is one of those who have not been heard of;--but to proceed:-- The first day of their march from the site of the wreck ought to have been a warning to them to turn back.  The savages robbed them of everything and threw stones at them.  A Dutchman of the name of Trout, who had fled to the Caffre country for some murder he had committed in the colony, fell in with them and told them the attempt was impracticable, from the number of savage nations, the width of the rivers, the desert countries without water, and the number of wild beasts which they would encounter; but still they were not persuaded, and went on to their destruction.  They were not five miles from the wreck at that time, and might have returned to it before night.\"  \"May it not fairly be supposed that after such a dreadful shipwreck anything was considered preferable by the major portion of them, especially the passengers, to re-embarking?\"  \"It may be so; but still it was a feeling that was to be surmounted, and would have been, had they been counselled by a judicious leader; for he might fairly have pointed out to them,--without re-embarkation, how are you to arrive in England?\"  \"Very true, uncle.  Pray continue.\"  \"From the accounts given by the seamen who returned, before they had travelled a week they were attacked by a large party of natives, to whose blows and ill-treatment as they passed along they had hitherto submitted; but as in this instance the natives appeared determined to massacre them, they resisted as well as they could, and, being nearly one hundred men in force, succeeded in driving them off, not without receiving many severe wounds.  After a few days' more travelling, their provisions were all expended, and the seamen began to murmur, and resolve to take care of themselves, and not to be encumbered with women and children.  The consequence was, that forty-three of the number separated from the rest, leaving the captain and all the male and female passengers and children (my dear Elizabeth among them), to get on as they could.\"  \"How cruel!\"  \"Yes! but self-preservation is the first law of nature, and I fear it is in vain to expect that persons not under the influence of religious principles will risk their lives, or submit to much self-denial, for the sake of alleviating the miseries of others.  The reason given for this separation was, that it was impossible to procure food for so large a number, and that they would be more likely to obtain sustenance when divided.  The party who thus proceeded in advance encountered the most terrible difficulties; they coasted along the sea-shore because they had no other food than the shell-fish found on the rocks; they had continually to cross rivers from a mile to two miles wide; they were kept from their slumber by the wild beasts which prowled around them, and at length they endured so much from want of water, that their sufferings were extreme.  They again subdivided and separated, wandering they hardly knew where, exposed to a burning sun, without clothing and without food.  One by one they sat down and were left behind to die, or to be devoured by the wild beasts before they were dead.  At last they were reduced to such extremity, that they proposed to cast lots for one to be killed to support the others; they turned back on their route, that they might find the dead bodies of their companions for food. Finally, out of the whole crew, three or four, purblind and staggering from exhaustion, craving for death, arrived at the borders of the colony, where they were kindly received and gradually recovered.\"  \"You now speak of the first party who separated from the captain and the passengers, do you not, uncle?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And what became of the captain's party?\"  \"No tidings were heard of them; their fate was unknown; it was long supposed that they had all perished; for if the sufferings of the seamen, inured to toil and danger, had been so great, what chance was there for helpless women and children?  But after some years, there was a report that they had been saved, and were living with the savages.  Le Vaillant first mentioned it, and then it died away and was not credited; but since that, the reports of various travellers appear to give confirmation to what Le Vaillant asserted.  The paragraph you have now read in the newspaper has again renewed the assertion, and the parties from whom it proceeds are by all accounts worthy of credence.  You may imagine, my dear boy, what a pang it gives me when I read these reports,--when I reflect that my poor girl, who was with that party, may at this moment be alive, may have returned to a state of barbarism,--the seeds of faith long dead in her bosom,--now changed to a wild untutored savage, knowing no God.\"  \"But, my dear uncle, allowing that my aunt is alive, she was not so young at the time of the wreck as to forget entirely what she had been taught.\"  \"That is possible; but then her condition must be still more painful, or rather I should say must have been, for probably she is dead long before this, or if not dead, she must be a woman advanced in life; indeed, as you may observe in the account given by the traveller in the paragraph you have read, it speaks only of the _descendants_ of those who were lost in the _Grosvenor_.  The idea of my grandchildren having returned to a state of barbarism is painful enough; I wish it were possible that I could discover the truth, for it is the uncertainty which so much distresses me.  I have but a few years to live, Alexander; I am a very old man, as you know, and may be summoned to-morrow or to-night, for we know not what a day may bring forth.  If I were only certain that my child had died, miserable as her death must have been, it would be happiness, "]]]
