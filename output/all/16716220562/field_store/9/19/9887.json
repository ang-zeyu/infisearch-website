'Twas honest metal and honest wood, in the days of the Outward Bound,  When men were gallant and ships were good -- roaming the wide world round.  The gods could envy a leader then when 'Follow me, lads!' he cried --  They faced each other and fought like men    in the days when the world was wide.   They tried to live as a freeman should -- they were happier men than we,  In the glorious days of wine and blood, when Liberty crossed the sea;  'Twas a comrade true or a foeman then, and a trusty sword well tried --  They faced each other and fought like men    in the days when the world was wide.   The good ship bound for the Southern seas when the beacon was Ballarat,  With a 'Ship ahoy!' on the freshening breeze,    'Where bound?' and 'What ship's that?' --  The emigrant train to New Mexico -- the rush to the Lachlan Side --  Ah! faint is the echo of Westward Ho!    from the days when the world was wide.   South, East, and West in advance of Time -- and, ay! in advance of Thought  Those brave men rose to a height sublime -- and is it for this they fought?  And is it for this damned life we praise the god-like spirit that died  At Eureka Stockade in the Roaring Days    with the days when the world was wide?   We fight like women, and feel as much; the thoughts of our hearts we guard;  Where scarcely the scorn of a god could touch,    the sneer of a sneak hits hard;  The treacherous tongue and cowardly pen, the weapons of curs, decide --  They faced each other and fought like men    in the days when the world was wide.   Think of it all -- of the life that is!  Study your friends and foes!  Study the past!  And answer this:  'Are these times better than those?'  The life-long quarrel, the paltry spite, the sting of your poisoned pride!  No matter who fell it were better to fight    as they did when the world was wide.   Boast as you will of your mateship now -- crippled and mean and sly --  The lines of suspicion on friendship's brow    were traced since the days gone by.  There was room in the long, free lines of the van    to fight for it side by side --  There was beating-room for the heart of a man    in the days when the world was wide.        .    .    .    .    .   With its dull, brown days of a-shilling-an-hour    the dreary year drags round:  Is this the result of Old England's power?    -- the bourne of the Outward Bound?  Is this the sequel of Westward Ho! -- of the days of Whate'er Betide?  The heart of the rebel makes answer 'No!    We'll fight till the world grows wide!'   The world shall yet be a wider world -- for the tokens are manifest;  East and North shall the wrongs be hurled that followed us South and West.  The march of Freedom is North by the Dawn!  Follow, whate'er betide!  Sons of the Exiles, march!  March on!  March till the world grows wide!     Faces in the Street     They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone  That want is here a stranger, and that misery's unknown;  For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet  My window-sill is level with the faces in the street --      Drifting past, drifting past,      To the beat of weary feet --  While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.   And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,  To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care;  I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet  In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street --      Drifting on, drifting on,      To the scrape of restless feet;  I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.   In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky  The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,  Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,  Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street --      Flowing in, flowing in,      To the beat of hurried feet --  Ah!  I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.   The human river dwindles when 'tis past the hour of eight,  Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;  But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat  The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street --      Grinding body, grinding soul,      Yielding scarce enough to eat --  Oh!  I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.   And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down  Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town,  Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street,  Tells of the city's unemployed upon his weary beat --      Drifting round, drifting round,      To the tread of listless feet --  Ah!  My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.   And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away,  And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day,  Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat,  Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street --      Ebbing out, ebbing out,      To the drag of tired feet,  While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.   And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day's sad pages end,  For while the short 'large hours' toward the longer 'small hours' trend,  With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat,  Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street --      Sinking down, sinking down,      Battered wreck by tempests beat --  A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.   But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes,  For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums,  Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet,  And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street --      Rotting out, rotting out,      For the lack of air and meat --  In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.   I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure  Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor?  Ah! Mammon's slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror beat,  When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,      The wrong things and the bad things      And the sad things that we meet  In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.   I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still,  And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill;  But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet,  They haunted me -- the shadows of those faces in the street,      Flitting by, flitting by,      Flitting by with noiseless feet,  And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.   Once I cried:  'Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure,  Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.'  And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city's street,  And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,      Coming near, coming near,      To a drum's dull distant beat,  And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street.   Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall,  The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all,  And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution's heat,  And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.      Pouring on, pouring on,      To a drum's loud threatening beat,  And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.   And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course,  The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse,  But not until a city feels Red Revolution's feet  Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street --      The dreadful everlasting strife      For scarcely clothes and meat  In that pent track of living death -- the city's cruel street.     The Roaring Days     The night too quickly passes   And we are growing old,  So let us fill our glasses   And toast the Days of Gold;  When finds of wondrous treasure   Set all the South ablaze,  And you and I were faithful mates   All through the roaring days!   Then stately ships came sailing   From every harbour's mouth,  And sought the land of promise   That beaconed in the South;  Then southward streamed their streamers   And swelled their canvas full  To speed the wildest dreamers   E'er borne in vessel's hull.   Their shining Eldorado,   Beneath the southern skies,  Was day and night for ever   Before their eager eyes.  The brooding bush, awakened,   Was stirred in wild unrest,  And all the year a human stream   Went pouring to the West.   The rough bush roads re-echoed   The bar-room's noisy din,  When troops of stalwart horsemen   Dismounted at the inn.  And oft the hearty greetings   And hearty clasp of hands  Would tell of sudden meetings   Of friends from other lands;  When, puzzled long, the new-chum   Would recognise at last,  Behind a bronzed and bearded skin,   A comrade of the past.   And when the cheery camp-fire   Explored the bush with gleams,  The camping-grounds were crowded   With caravans of teams;  Then home the jests were driven,   And good old songs were sung,  And choruses were given   The strength of heart and lung.  Oh, they were lion-hearted   Who gave our country birth!  Oh, they were of the stoutest sons   From all the lands on earth!   Oft when the camps were dreaming,   And fires began to pale,  Through rugged ranges gleaming   Would come the Royal Mail.  Behind six foaming horses,   And lit by flashing lamps,  Old 'Cobb and Co.'s', in royal state,   Went dashing past the camps.   Oh, who would paint a goldfield,   And limn the picture right,  As we have often seen it   In early morning's light;  The yellow mounds of mullock   With spots of red and white,  The scattered quartz that glistened   Like diamonds in light;  The azure line of ridges,   The bush of darkest green,  The little homes of calico   That dotted all the scene.   I hear the fall of timber   From distant flats and fells,  The pealing of the anvils   As clear as little bells,  The rattle of the cradle,   The clack of windlass-boles,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/214"],["title","In the Days When the World Was Wide, and Other Verses (#2)"],["body"," flutter of the crimson flags   Above the golden holes.        .    .    .    .    .   Ah, then our hearts were bolder,   And if Dame Fortune frowned  Our swags we'd lightly shoulder   And tramp to other ground.  But golden days are vanished,   And altered is the scene;  The diggings are deserted,   The camping-grounds are green;  The flaunting flag of progress   Is in the West unfurled,  The mighty bush with iron rails   Is tethered to the world.     'For'ard'     It is stuffy in the steerage where the second-classers sleep,  For there's near a hundred for'ard, and they're stowed away like sheep, --  They are trav'lers for the most part in a straight 'n' honest path;  But their linen's rather scanty, an' there isn't any bath --  Stowed away like ewes and wethers that is shore 'n' marked 'n' draft.  But the shearers of the shearers always seem to travel aft;      In the cushioned cabins, aft,      With saloons 'n' smoke-rooms, aft --  There is sheets 'n' best of tucker for the first-salooners, aft.   Our beef is just like scrapin's from the inside of a hide,  And the spuds were pulled too early, for they're mostly green inside;  But from somewhere back amidships there's a smell o' cookin' waft,  An' I'd give my earthly prospects for a real good tuck-out aft --      Ham an' eggs 'n' coffee, aft,      Say, cold fowl for luncheon, aft,  Juicy grills an' toast 'n' cutlets -- tucker a-lor-frongsy, aft.   They feed our women sep'rate, an' they make a blessed fuss,  Just as if they couldn't trust 'em for to eat along with us!  Just because our hands are horny an' our hearts are rough with graft --  But the gentlemen and ladies always DINE together, aft --      With their ferns an' mirrors, aft,      With their flow'rs an' napkins, aft --  'I'll assist you to an orange' -- 'Kindly pass the sugar', aft.   We are shabby, rough, 'n' dirty, an' our feelin's out of tune,  An' it's hard on fellers for'ard that was used to go saloon;  There's a broken swell among us -- he is barracked, he is chaffed,  An' I wish at times, poor devil, for his own sake he was aft;      For they'd understand him, aft,      (He will miss the bath-rooms aft),  Spite of all there's no denyin' that there's finer feelin's aft.   Last night we watched the moonlight as it spread across the sea --  'It is hard to make a livin',' said the broken swell to me.  'There is ups an' downs,' I answered, an' a bitter laugh he laughed --  There were brighter days an' better when he always travelled aft --      With his rug an' gladstone, aft,      With his cap an' spyglass, aft --  A careless, rovin', gay young spark as always travelled aft.   There's a notice by the gangway, an' it seems to come amiss,  For it says that second-classers 'ain't allowed abaft o' this';  An' there ought to be a notice for the fellows from abaft --  But the smell an' dirt's a warnin' to the first-salooners, aft;      With their tooth and nail-brush, aft,      With their cuffs 'n' collars, aft --  Their cigars an' books an' papers, an' their cap-peaks fore-'n'-aft.   I want to breathe the mornin' breeze that blows against the boat,  For there's a swellin' in my heart -- a tightness in my throat --  We are for'ard when there's trouble!  We are for'ard when there's graft!  But the men who never battle always seem to travel aft;      With their dressin'-cases, aft,      With their swell pyjamas, aft --  Yes! the idle and the careless, they have ease an' comfort, aft.   I feel so low an' wretched, as I mooch about the deck,  That I'm ripe for jumpin' over -- an' I wish there was a wreck!  We are driven to New Zealand to be shot out over there --  Scarce a shillin' in our pockets, nor a decent rag to wear,  With the everlastin' worry lest we don't get into graft --  There is little left to land for if you cannot travel aft;      No anxiety abaft,      They have stuff to land with, aft --  Oh, there's little left to land for if you cannot travel aft;   But it's grand at sea this mornin', an' Creation almost speaks,  Sailin' past the Bay of Islands with its pinnacles an' peaks,  With the sunny haze all round us an' the white-caps on the blue,  An' the orphan rocks an' breakers -- Oh, it's glorious sailin' through!  To the south a distant steamer, to the west a coastin' craft,  An' we see the beauty for'ard, better than if we were aft;      Spite of op'ra-glasses, aft;      But, ah well, they're brothers aft --  Nature seems to draw us closer -- bring us nearer fore-'n'-aft.   What's the use of bein' bitter?  What's the use of gettin' mad?  What's the use of bein' narrer just because yer luck is bad?  What's the blessed use of frettin' like a child that wants the moon?  There is broken hearts an' trouble in the gilded first saloon!  We are used to bein' shabby -- we have got no overdraft --  We can laugh at troubles for'ard that they couldn't laugh at aft;      Spite o' pride an' tone abaft      (Keepin' up appearance, aft)  There's anxiety an' worry in the breezy cabins aft.   But the curse o' class distinctions from our shoulders shall be hurled,  An' the influence of woman revolutionize the world;  There'll be higher education for the toilin' starvin' clown,  An' the rich an' educated shall be educated down;  An' we all will meet amidships on this stout old earthly craft,  An' there won't be any friction 'twixt the classes fore-'n'-aft.      We'll be brothers, fore-'n'-aft!      Yes, an' sisters, fore-'n'-aft!  When the people work together, and there ain't no fore-'n'-aft.     The Drover's Sweetheart     An hour before the sun goes down   Behind the ragged boughs,  I go across the little run   And bring the dusty cows;  And once I used to sit and rest   Beneath the fading dome,  For there was one that I loved best   Who'd bring the cattle home.   Our yard is fixed with double bails,   Round one the grass is green,  The bush is growing through the rails,   The spike is rusted in;  And 'twas from there his freckled face   Would turn and smile at me --  He'd milk a dozen in the race   While I was milking three.   I milk eleven cows myself   Where once I milked but four;  I set the dishes on the shelf   And close the dairy door;  And when the glaring sunlight fails   And the fire shines through the cracks,  I climb the broken stockyard rails   And watch the bridle-tracks.   He kissed me twice and once again   And rode across the hill,  The pint-pots and the hobble-chain   I hear them jingling still;  He'll come at night or not at all --   He left in dust and heat,  And when the soft, cool shadows fall   Is the best time to meet.   And he is coming back again,   He wrote to let me know,  The floods were in the Darling then --   It seems so long ago;  He'd come through miles of slush and mud,   And it was weary work,  The creeks were bankers, and the flood   Was forty miles round Bourke.   He said the floods had formed a block,   The plains could not be crossed,  And there was foot-rot in the flock   And hundreds had been lost;  The sheep were falling thick and fast   A hundred miles from town,  And when he reached the line at last   He trucked the remnant down.   And so he'll have to stand the cost;   His luck was always bad,  Instead of making more, he lost   The money that he had;  And how he'll manage, heaven knows   (My eyes are getting dim),  He says -- he says -- he don't -- suppose   I'll want -- to -- marry -- him.   As if I wouldn't take his hand   Without a golden glove --  Oh! Jack, you men won't understand   How much a girl can love.  I long to see his face once more --   Jack's dog! thank God, it's Jack! --  (I never thought I'd faint before)   He's coming -- up -- the track.     Out Back     The old year went, and the new returned, in the withering weeks of drought,  The cheque was spent that the shearer earned,    and the sheds were all cut out;  The publican's words were short and few,    and the publican's looks were black --  And the time had come, as the shearer knew, to carry his swag Out Back.        For time means tucker, and tramp you must,         where the scrubs and plains are wide,       With seldom a track that a man can trust, or a mountain peak to guide;       All day long in the dust and heat -- when summer is on the track --       With stinted stomachs and blistered feet,         they carry their swags Out Back.   He tramped away from the shanty there, when the days were long and hot,  With never a soul to know or care if he died on the track or not.  The poor of the city have friends in woe, no matter how much they lack,  But only God and the swagmen know how a poor man fares Out Back.   He begged his way on the parched Paroo and the Warrego tracks once more,  And lived like a dog, as the swagmen do, till the Western stations shore;  But men were many, and sheds were full, for work in the town was slack --  The traveller never got hands in wool,    though he tramped for a year Out Back.   In stifling noons when his back was wrung    by its load, and the air seemed dead,  And the water warmed in the bag that hung to his aching arm like lead,  Or in times of flood, when plains were seas,    and the scrubs were cold and black,  He ploughed in mud to his trembling knees, and paid for his sins Out Back.   He blamed himself in the year 'Too Late' --    in the heaviest hours of life --  'Twas little he dreamed that a shearing-mate had care of his home and wife;  There are times when wrongs from your kindred come,    and treacherous tongues attack --  When a man is better away from home, and dead to the world, Out Back.   And dirty and careless and old he wore, as his lamp of hope grew dim;  He tramped for years till the swag he bore seemed part of himself to him.  As a bullock drags in the sandy ruts, he followed the dreary track,  With never a thought but to reach the huts when the sun went down Out Back.   It chanced one day, when the north wind blew    in his face like a furnace-breath,  He left the track for a tank he knew -- 'twas a short-cut to his death;"]]]
