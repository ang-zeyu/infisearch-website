She didn't even beg Betsy Butterfly's pardon for calling her a thief. But all the rest of the field people realized at last that Betsy was no thief.  The butter-and-eggs plant, they were well aware, was as free as the clover, or the milk-weed blossoms, or any other of the wild flowers. Everybody knew that Farmer Green laid no claim to them, though they did grow in his meadow.  And when Betsy Butterfly thanked Daddy Longlegs for his explanation he wished more than ever that he had worn his new coat that day--and his new hat, too.     XIII  THE FRIENDLY STRANGER   OF course, anyone so beautiful as Betsy Butterfly was bound to attract attention. Wherever she went people turned their heads--if they could--to look at her. And those whose heads were so fastened to their bodies that they simply couldn't crane their necks at anybody--even those unlucky creatures wheeled themselves about in order to gaze at Betsy.  If they happened to be ladies they stared at her because they wanted to see what was the latest style in gowns, or maybe hats. And if they happened to be gentlemen they looked at her because they just couldn't help it.  It was no wonder, then, that Betsy Butterfly had many admirers. In fact, she was so accustomed to their flittering after her that usually she paid little heed to them. But now and then one of them made himself so agreeable that Betsy favored him slightly more than the others.  Such was a stranger dressed in yellowish brown whom she chanced to meet among the flowers one day. He was flying from flower to flower with a loud buzzing. And he reminded Betsy Butterfly of somebody, but she couldn't just think who it was.  \"Ah!\" said the stranger, as soon as he caught Betsy's eye. \"The blossoms are fine and fresh after last night's shower, aren't they?\"  Betsy had to admit that what the stranger said was true. And when he came right over to the flower where she was breakfasting and began buzzing around her, and eating pollen, Betsy Butterfly thought that for a stranger he seemed very friendly.  She looked at him for a time, out of the corner of her eye, while she tried to recall whom the newcomer resembled. But he looked like no one she had even seen. And then all at once Betsy knew what was so familiar about him. It was his voice!  \"You remind me of a friend of mine,\" she remarked. \"He lives in the meadow not far from here. It's your buzzing,\" she explained. \"If I didn't see you I should think you were Buster Bumblebee.\"  Betsy's remark seemed to please the stranger. And he smiled smugly while he buzzed louder than ever.  \"It's not surprising that I make you think of him,\" he observed. \"Indeed it would be odd if I didn't, for I'm a sort of cousin of Buster's, so to speak. Perhaps you didn't know that my name is Bumble--Joseph Bumble.\"  Naturally Betsy and Joseph became good friends on the spot. And after that people often saw them rambling together among the flowers.  Now, Joseph Bumble proved to be a great talker. And since Betsy Butterfly was an excellent listener, they spent many agreeable hours together.  At least, Joseph enjoyed every minute that he spent in Betsy Butterfly's company. And if at times she found his prattle a bit tiresome, she was too well-mannered to say so.  If the truth were known, Joseph Bumble proved to be somewhat of a braggart. He was forever boasting of his connection with the Bumblebee family. And Betsy couldn't say anything to him without his remarking that his cousin Buster Bumblebee's mother, the well-known Queen, thought this or that.  \"And being of royal blood, the Queen ought to know what's what,\" he frequently said.  \"I suppose--\" Betsy said to him at last--\"I suppose you're of royal blood yourself, Mr. Bumble?\"  \"Oh, very!\" he replied with a smirk. \"We're all of us very royal indeed.\"  And Betsy Butterfly thought how pleasant it was to be friends with anyone who came from such a fine family as Joseph Bumble's.     XIV  A DEEP PLOT   AS time passed, Betsy continued to see a great deal of Joseph Bumble. And she noticed one peculiar thing: Although he talked continually of his cousin Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son, no one had ever seen the two together.  \"How does it happen,\" she asked Joseph at last, \"that I never find you with your cousin? Aren't you friends?\"  \"We're certainly not _enemies_,\" said Joseph Bumble, \"though I must admit that we're not quite so intimate as we might be. You see, Buster and I have different tastes. And now that the red clover is in blossom he spends all his time in the clover field. But as you know, like you I am very fond of flowers. And I'd far rather be here in the meadow--or the flower garden--with you, than in the clover patch with Buster Bumblebee.\"  Naturally such an answer was bound to please Betsy Butterfly. And after that she bothered her head no more about the friendship between the two cousins. Certainly Joseph Bumble's explanation sounded reasonable. And she had no cause to doubt his statement.  Meanwhile there were others among Betsy Butterfly's admirers who became very peevish on observing how much time Betsy and the newcomer in the neighborhood, Joseph Bumble, were spending in each other's society. And they agreed among themselves that something ought to be done to put an end to the upstart Bumble's boasting.  \"Betsy Butterfly thinks the fellow is a cousin of Buster Bumblebee's,\" said Chirpy Cricket. \"But I've noticed that he and Buster are never together. Let's ask Buster to come over to the meadow so that he may meet this cousin of his! And then perhaps we'll learn something more about Joseph Bumble than we know now.\"  Everybody said that that was a good plan. And Betsy's admirers chose Daddy Longlegs to call on Buster Bumblebee and invite him to a party to be given in the meadow the following day.  Daddy Longlegs agreed to do the errand, in spite of the fact that for him it was half a day's journey to the Bumblebee's home from the stone wall where he lived. But he thought that by hurrying he ought to be able to get back in time to put on his best coat and go to the party, though he might arrive somewhat late.  \"Don't forget to ask Betsy Butterfly to the party!\" Daddy called, as he started off on his long trip.  \"Don't worry! I'll attend to that myself,\" Chirpy Cricket promised.  \"And don't forget to invite Joseph Bumble!\" Daddy cautioned him.  \"Oh! we don't need to ask him,\" said Chirpy Cricket. \"_He'll_ come without being invited, unless I'm greatly mistaken.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Luckily for Daddy Longlegs there was not a breath of wind either that day or the following one. So he made excellent time to the Bumblebee home, where he found Buster Bumblebee and gave him his invitation. Then Daddy turned around and started back towards his stone wall. Buster Bumblebee had promised to come to the party. And Daddy wanted to be present when the two cousins, Buster Bumblebee and Joseph Bumble, met--with Betsy Butterfly right there to watch them.     XV  JOSEPH BUMBLE'S COMPLAINT   IT happened just as Chirpy Cricket had expected. Betsy Butterfly arrived at the party with her admirer, Joseph Bumble, buzzing close behind her. Although he had not been invited, he did not feel the least bit shy about coming.  \"Being of a royal family, I never wait to be asked to a place,\" he had explained loftily to Betsy. \"And you'll see that everybody will be glad to see me at the party. People always consider it an honor to have me at their entertainments.\"  Joseph's words proved partly true, anyhow. Anyone could see that Joseph Bumble was more than welcome. Chirpy Cricket and Daddy Longlegs--as well good many others--rushed up to him and told him how pleased they were to see him.  And Joseph Bumble was having a very agreeable time talking in a loud voice about himself and his family when he suddenly stopped short. A look of displeasure crossed his face. And Daddy Longlegs asked him if he had eaten something that disagreed with him.  \"No!\" replied Joseph Bumble. \"I've been interrupted. And it's hardly the sort of treatment a person of royal blood--like myself--expects to receive at a party.\"  \"Who interrupted you?\" Chirpy Cricket inquired.  \"I don't know,\" Joseph Bumble answered. \"But someone was talking in a loud voice.\"  \"Are you sure it wasn't yourself that you heard?\" Daddy Longlegs wanted to know.  \"Certainly not!\" cried Joseph. \"Don't be silly! Don't you suppose I know my own voice when I hear it?\"  \"Perhaps it was your echo that you heard,\" Daddy ventured.  At that Joseph Bumble rudely turned his back on him and began whispering to Chirpy Cricket. He was actually suggesting that Daddy Longlegs should be thrown out of the party!  And then Mr. Bumble again paused abruptly and listened.  \"There!\" he said to Chirpy Cricket. \"Don't you hear that buzzing? That's the person that interrupted me. And I'd like to have him put out of the party too, along with this queer old chap who insulted me a moment ago.\"  Chirpy Cricket looked around, until his eye rested on Buster Bumblebee, who had just arrived and who was at that moment talking with Betsy Butterfly.  \"There's the young man you hear!\" Chirpy told Joseph Bumble. \"Don't you know him?\"  \"No!\" replied Joseph, as his eyes followed Chirpy Cricket's. \"And I don't want to know him, either. He looks to me to be a very ordinary person. And anybody can see that he's annoying Betsy Butterfly. I tell you, I want him chased away from here at once. For I'm of royal blood; and I'm not accustomed to go to parties with ragtags and bobtails. I'm a cousin of Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son.\"  Well, Chirpy Cricket tried hard not to laugh right in Joseph Bumble's face.  \"I'll see what I can do,\" Chirpy promised him. \"And I will admit that _somebody_ ought to be barred out of this party.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed Joseph Bumble. \"I'm glad to know that you're so sensible.\"  Perhaps he would have spoken in a different fashion had he known exactly what Chirpy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],["title","The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#5)"],["body","had in mind. But now he said nothing more, though he continued to stare angrily at Buster Bumblebee, who was glad to see Betsy Butterfly, and was telling her as much, too.     XVI  NOTHING BUT A FRAUD   AT last Joseph Bumble's displeasure passed all control. He began to buzz as loud as he could, hoping to drown Buster Bumblebee's buzzing, so that Buster could no longer talk to Betsy Butterfly.  Naturally, Buster soon had to raise his own voice, in order to make himself heard. And soon the two made such a roar that everybody else had to stop up his ears.  Noticing a look of distress on Betsy Butterfly's face, Buster asked her what the trouble was.  \"You and your cousin Joseph are making a terrible racket,\" she told him.  \"My cousin Joseph!\" cried Buster Bumblebee. \"And who is he, I should like to know? Point him out to me, please! For I didn't know I had a cousin at this party.\"  \"There he is!\" said Betsy Butterfly, nodding her head towards the glowering Joseph.  \"What! That unshaven stranger in the yellowish-brown suit?\" cried Buster Bumblebee. \"I assure you he's no relation of mine.\"  \"You must be mistaken,\" Betsy persisted. \"He says he's your cousin, and of royal blood himself.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Buster Bumblebee. \"Just let me talk to him a moment, and I'll soon prove that your friend is nothing but a fraud.\"  Accordingly Buster left her, and straightway perched himself upon a daisy directly in front of Joseph Bumble.  \"How-dy do!\" said Buster. \"I hear you've been talking about me.\"  Now, Joseph Bumble's only thought was that the noisy chap in the yellow and black velvet must have overheard what he had said to Chirpy Cricket about throwing him out of the party.  \"I don't care to talk with you,\" Joseph announced in his grandest manner. \"I'm from such a fine family that I have to be very particular about whom I'm seen with.\"  \"Is that so?\" said Buster. \"I suppose if Buster Bumblebee were at this party you'd be glad to talk with him?\"  \"I should say I would!\" was the other's answer. \"He's my cousin.\"  \"What's your name, anyhow?\" Buster Inquired.  \"Joseph Bumble!\"  \"What's the rest of it?\" Buster Bumblebee demanded, while the whole company surged around him, so that they might hear.  \"I refuse to answer!\" said Joseph Bumble. And afterward Daddy Longlegs declared that at that moment he saw the fellow's knees trembling.  \"Come!\" said Joseph Bumble, turning suddenly to Betsy Butterfly. \"I see that we've accidentally fallen in with some rough people; and we'd better be moving on.\"  But Betsy Butterfly didn't even look at Joseph.  \"What _is_ his full name?\" she asked Buster.  \"He's a Bumble Flower-Beetle,\" Buster said. \"And as for his being related to me, that's all humbug. This stranger is no kin either to the Bumblebee or any other Bee family. But his voice is so much like ours that he's taken part of our name, though our family has always claimed that he has no right to it.\"  \"Who are you?\" Joseph Bumble demanded of Buster quite fiercely. He was determined to put his enemy to rout if he could.  \"I'm Buster Bumblebee!\" was the reply. \"Don't you know your cousin?\"  When he heard that, Joseph Bumble knew at once that the game was up. His trickery was discovered beyond a doubt. So with one last lingering look at the beautiful Betsy he took to his wings. And no one ever saw him in those parts again.  As for Betsy Butterfly, she never could bear, after that, to hear the name of Joseph Bumble so much as mentioned.     XVII  DUSTY'S DIFFICULTY   IT was to be expected that as time went on, Betsy Butterfly's fame would spread far and wide. And long before the summer was over, half the creatures that lived in Pleasant Valley knew her. They were the ones that went about by daylight and rested at night.  As for the other half--the night-prowlers--many of them had heard about the beautiful Betsy, though of course they had never seen her. That is, none of them had set eyes on her except Freddie Firefly, who had flashed his light upon Betsy all one night, because Mrs. Ladybug had a strange notion that she was stealing butter from the farmhouse.  In fact, after that happened, Freddie Firefly had gone about telling all his friends how beautiful Betsy Butterfly was, and saying what a pity it was that she didn't like moonlight as well as sunshine.  He talked so much about her that at last a good many of the night-prowling people said that they wished they might see Betsy Butterfly just once, for they could scarcely believe that anybody could be as dainty and bewitching as Freddie Firefly would have them believe her.  And there was one dashing young chap of the Moth family who became especially eager to make Betsy's acquaintance. Indeed, he began to complain that he was losing his appetite, through thinking about Betsy Butterfly. So he besought Freddie Firefly to help him out of his difficulty.  Now, while he was talking with Freddie Firefly, this young Moth, who was known as Dusty, never once stopped eating. Freddie Firefly noticed how his fat sides stuck out.  And he wondered what the fellow's appetite could have been like before he lost some of it.  \"You don't act like one in delicate health,\" Freddie Firefly observed, as he watched the greedy Dusty consume more food.  \"Oh, but I am!\" Dusty Moth protested feebly. \"I'm so weak now that I can hardly raise myself with my wings.\"  Freddie was sure that Dusty's trouble was merely due to his being too fat. But he saw no reason for quarreling with him.  \"Can't you think of some plan by which I could meet Betsy Butterfly?\" Dusty Moth persisted. \"Perhaps if I could see her just once I'd be able to get my mind _off_ her--and _on_ my meals again.\"  \"I don't know how I can help you,\" Freddie Firefly confessed. \"You see, Betsy goes home exactly at sunset. And at present she never seems to make her home in the same place for even two nights. So one can never be sure where she will be.  \"Of course, when the sun is shining you can always find her among the flowers. But that won't help you any, because you're such a sleepy-head in the daytime that you couldn't see anything even if it was stuck right into your eyes.\"  \"Can't you explain my sad case to Betsy Butterfly?\" Dusty Moth asked hopefully. \"I've heard that she's very kind-hearted. And if she knew how I'm suffering on her account I'm sure she'd be glad to meet me some pleasant, dark night.\"  He begged so piteously that in the end Freddie Firefly agreed to do what he could.  \"But I warn you--\" he said--\"I warn you that I can't give you much hope.\"     XVIII  SOLOMON OWL'S IDEA   FREDDIE FIREFLY actually did send a message to Betsy Butterfly, telling her that Dusty Moth wanted to see her, and saying that unless she would agree to meet him in the meadow some night soon, Dusty was afraid he would lose his appetite entirely.  But Betsy thought the whole affair was only a joke. So she merely laughed--and sent Freddie no answer at all; for she hardly believed that she needed to explain to him that nothing could induce her to stir out after sunset.  Freddie Firefly was much upset because he received no answer to his message. Perhaps he would not have cared so much had Dusty Moth not made his life miserable each night from dusk to dawn. But that persistent fellow kept asking Freddie every few minutes if he had \"heard from her\" yet. And naturally anyone would grow tired if he had to keep saying \"No! no! no!\" all night long.  At the same time Dusty Moth kept insisting in a most annoying way that if he lost much more of his appetite he would be ill, and it would be Freddie Firefly's fault.  So Freddie Firefly began to worry. He came finally to detest Dusty Moth. And Freddie's family noticed that he was growing quite thin, because Dusty Moth left him little time--between questions--in which to eat his meals comfortably.  \"I declare, I wish Betsy Butterfly would move away from Pleasant Valley!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed at last, quite out of patience with everybody and everything. \"I'm in a pretty fix, I am! And since I don't know how to get rid of this annoying Dusty Moth, I'm going to ask Solomon Owl what I'd better do.\" That, at least, was a comforting thought.  So the following morning, just before dawn, he made what might be termed a flying call on Solomon Owl who lived in the hemlock woods beyond the swamp.  And luckily wise old Solomon thought of a good plan at once. As soon as he had heard Freddie Firefly's story he said to him:  \"If Betsy Butterfly refuses to meet your friend, why don't you ask her for her picture?\"  \"That's a splendid idea!\" Freddie cried. \"How in the world did you ever happen to think of it, Mr. Owl?\"  Solomon Owl hooted at that question.  \"That's my secret,\" he said. \"If I told all I know, everybody else would be just as wise as I am.\" And after giving another long string of hoots, which he followed with a burst of loud laughter, Solomon Owl popped into his house.  Anyhow, Freddie Firefly couldn't complain, for he now had a remedy for his trouble. And he felt so carefree and happy again that on his way across the meadow he stopped to talk with Jimmy Rabbit, who was taking a stroll in the direction of Farmer Green's cabbage patch.  Freddie Firefly quickly told Jimmy all about his affair with Dusty Moth. He even explained how he had gone to ask Solomon Owl's help, and related what that wise bird had advised.  \"There's only one thing that worries me now,\" said Freddie Firefly anxiously. \"I'm wondering whether Betsy Butterfly has ever had a picture made of herself.\"     XIX  A BIT OF LUCK   JIMMY RABBIT promptly set Freddie Firefly's fears at rest.  \"I happen to know,\" said he, \"that Betsy Butterfly has a picture of herself.\"  \"Are you sure?\" Freddie asked him eagerly.  \"I ought to be,\" replied Jimmy Rabbit, \"because I painted it myself, the very next day after I finished a portrait of old Mr. Crow.\"  \"It ought to be a good one, if you made it,\" said Freddie. \"But wasn't it some time ago that you were an artist?\"  \"It was"]]]
