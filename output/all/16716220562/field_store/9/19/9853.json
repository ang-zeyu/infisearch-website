You did wrong, as I says to you at the time; but you was so orbst'nate you would.  Says as you'd got such lots of money, master, as you'd never miss it.\"  Uncle Josiah gave vent to a sound resembling a disgusted grunt, and turned from the speaker, who continued reproachfully to Don,--  \"What you've got to do, my lad, is to go down on your bended knees to your uncle, as is a good master as ever lived--and I will say that, come what may--and ask him to let you off this time, and you won't do so any more.\"  \"Uncle, you won't believe what he says?\" cried Don wildly.  Uncle Josiah did not reply, only looked at him searchingly.  \"He can't help believing it, my lad,\" said Mike sadly.  \"It's werry shocking in one so young.\"  Don made a desperate struggle to free himself from Jem's encircling arms, but the man held fast.  \"No, no, my lad; keep quiet,\" growled Jem.  \"I'm going to spoil the shape of his nose for him before he goes.\"  \"Then you don't believe it, Jem?\" cried Don, passionately.  \"Believe it, my lad?  Why, I couldn't believe it if he swore it 'fore a hundred million magistrits.\"  \"No, that's allus the way with higgerant chaps like you, Jem Wimble,\" said Mike; \"but it's all true, genelmen, and I'm sorry I didn't speak out afore like a man, for he don't deserve what I did for him.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated Uncle Josiah, and Don's face was full of despair.  \"You charge Mike Bannock, then, with stealing this money, sir,\" said the constable.  \"Yes, certainly.\"  \"What?\" roared Mike, savagely, \"charge me?\"  \"That will do,\" said the constable, taking a little staff with a brass crown on the end from his pocket.  \"No nonsense, or I shall call in help.  In the King's name, my lad.  Do you give in?\"  \"Give in?  What for?  I arn't done nothing.  Charge him; he's the thief.\"  Don started as if the word _thief_ were a stinging lash.  Jem loosed his hold, and with double fists dashed at the scoundrel.  \"You say Master Don's a thief!\"  \"Silence, Wimble!  Stand back, sir,\" cried Uncle Josiah, sternly.  \"But, sir--\"  \"Silence, man!  Am I master here?\"  Jem drew back muttering.  \"Charge him, I say,\" continued Mike, boisterously; \"and if you won't, I will.  Look here, Mr Smithers, I charge this 'ere boy with going to his uncle's desk and taking all the gold, and leaving all the silver in a little hogamee bowl.\"  \"You seem to know all about it, Mike,\" said the constable, grimly.  \"Course I do, my lad.  I seed him.  Caught him in the werry act, and he dropped one o' the guineas, and it run away under the desk, and he couldn't find it.\"  \"You saw all that, eh?\" said the constable.  \"Every bit of it.  I swears to it, sir.\"  \"And how came you to be in the office to see it?\"  \"How come I in the office to see it?\" said Mike, staring; \"how come I in the office to see it?\"  \"Yes.  Your work's in the yard, isn't it?\"  \"Course it is,\" said Mike, with plenty of effrontery; \"but I heerd the money jingling like, and I went in to see.\"  \"And very kind of you too, Mike,\" said the constable, jocularly.  \"Don't you forget to tell that to the magistrates.\"  \"Magistrits?  What magistrits?  Master arn't going to give me in custody, I know.\"  \"Indeed, but I am, you scoundrel,\" cried Uncle Josiah, wrathfully.  \"You are one of the worst kind of thieves--\"  \"Here, take that back, master.\"  \"Worst kind of scoundrels--dogs who bite the hand that has fed them.\"  \"I tell yer it was him,\" said Mike, with a ferocious glare at Don.  \"All right, Mike, you tell the magistrates that,\" said the constable, \"and don't forget.\"  \"I arn't going 'fore no magistrits,\" grumbled Mike.  \"Yes, you are,\" said the constable, taking a pair of handcuffs from his pocket.  \"Now then, is it to be quietly?\"  Mike made a furious gesture.  \"Just as you like,\" said the constable.  \"Jem Wimble, I call you in the King's name to help.\"  \"Which I just will,\" cried Jem, with alacrity; and he made at Mike, while Don felt a strange desire tingling in his veins as he longed to help as well.  \"I gives in,\" growled Mike.  \"I could chuck the whole lot on you outer winder, but I won't.  It would only make it seem as if I was guilty, and it's not guilty, and so I tell you.  Master says I took the money, and I says it was that young Don Lavington as is the thief.  Come on, youngster.  I'll talk to you when we're in the lock-up.\"  Don looked wildly from Mike to his uncle, whose eyes were fixed on the constable.  \"Do you charge the boy too, sir?\"  Uncle Josiah was silent for some moments.  \"No!  Not now!\"  Lindon's heart leapt at that word \"_no_!\"  But it sank again at the \"_not now_.\"  \"But the case is awkward, sir,\" said the constable.  \"After what this man has said we shall be obliged to take some notice of the matter.\"  \"'Bliged to?  Course you will.  Here, bring 'im along.  Come on, mate. I can tell you stories all night now about my bygones.  Keep up yer sperrits, and I daresay the magistrits 'll let you off pretty easy.\"  \"If there is any charge made against my young clerk,\"--Don winced, for his uncle did not say, \"against my nephew,\"--\"I will be answerable for his appearance before the magistrates.  That will be sufficient, I presume.\"  \"Yes, sir, I suppose that will do,\" said the constable.  \"But I s'pose it won't,\" said Mike.  \"He's the monkey and I'm only the cat.  You've got to take him if you does your dooty, and master 'll be answerable for me.\"  \"Exactly,\" said the constable; \"come along.\"  \"Nay, but this arn't fair, master.  Take one, take all.  You bring us both.\"  \"Come along.\"  \"If you don't bring that there young un too, I won't go,\" exclaimed the scoundrel, fiercely.  _Click_!  A short struggle, and then _click_ again, and Mike Bannock's hands were useless, but he threw himself down.  \"Fair play, fair play,\" he cried, savagely; \"take one, take all.  Are you going to charge him, master?\"  \"Take the scoundrel away, Smithers, and once more I will be bail--before the magistrates, if necessary--for my clerk's appearance,\" cried Uncle Josiah, who was now out of patience.  \"Can I help?\"  \"Well, sir, you could,\" said the constable, grimly; \"but if you'd have in three or four of your men, and a short step ladder, we could soon carry him off.\"  \"No man sha'n't carry me off,\" roared Mike, as Jem ran out of the office with great alacrity, and returned in a very short time with three men and a stout ladder, about nine feet long.  \"That's the sort, Wimble,\" said the constable.  \"Didn't think of a rope, did you?\"  \"Did I think of two ropes?\" said Jem, grinning.  \"Ah!\" ejaculated the constable.  \"Now, Mike Bannock, I just warn you that any violence will make your case worse.  Take my advice, get up and come quietly.\"  \"Take young Don Lavington too, then, and I will.\"  \"Get up, and walk quietly.\"  \"Not 'less you takes him.\"  \"Sorry to make a rumpus, sir,\" said the constable, apologetically; \"but I must have him out.\"  \"The sooner the better,\" said Uncle Josiah, grimly.  \"I am ready to go, uncle,\" said Don, quietly.  \"I am not afraid.\"  \"Hold your tongue, sir!\" said the merchant, sternly; \"and stand out of the way.\"  \"Now, Mike,\" said the constable, \"this is the third time of asking. Will you come quiet?\"  \"Take him too,\" cried Mike.  \"Ready with those ropes, Wimble.  You two, ready with that there.  Now, Mike Bannock, you've been asked three times, and now you've got to mount that ladder.\"  \"Any man comes a-nigh me,\" roared Mike, \"I'll--\"  He did not say what, for the constable dashed at him, and by an ingenious twist avoided a savage kick, threw the scoundrel over on his face, as he lay on the floor, and sat upon him, retaining his seat in spite of his struggles.  \"Step the first,\" said the constable, coolly.  \"Now, Wimble, I want that ladder passed under me, so as to lie right along on his back.  Do you see?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" cried Jem, eagerly; and taking the ladder as the constable sat astride the prostrate scoundrel, holding down his shoulders, and easing himself up, the ladder was passed between the officer's legs, and, in spite of a good deal of heaving, savage kicking, and one or two fierce attempts to bite, right along till it was upon Mike's back, projecting nearly two feet beyond his head and feet.  \"Murder!\" yelled Mike, hoarsely.  \"What?  Does it hurt, my lad?  Never mind; you'll soon get used to it.\"  The constable seated himself upon the ladder, whose sides and rounds thoroughly imprisoned the scoundrel in spite of his yells and struggles to get free.  \"Now then, Wimble, I've got him.  You tie his ankles, one each side, tightly to the ladder, and one of you bind his arms same way to the ladder sides.  Cut the rope.  Mr Christmas will not mind.\"  The men grinned, and set to work so handily that in a few moments Mike was securely bound.  \"Now then,\" said the constable, \"I'll have one round his middle; give me a piece of rope; I'll soon do that.\"  He seized the rope, and, without rising, rapidly secured it to one side of the ladder.  \"Now,\" he said, \"raise that end.\"  This was done, the rope passed under Mike, drawn up on the other side, hauled upon till Mike yelled for mercy, and then knotted twice.  \"There, my lads,\" said the constable, rising; \"now turn him over.\"  The ladder was seized, turned, and there lay Mike on his back, safely secured.  \"Here, undo these,\" he said, sullenly.  \"I'll walk.\"  \"Too late, Mike, my boy.  Now then, a couple of men head and tail.  Let the ladder hang at arm's length.  Best have given in quietly, and not have made yourself a show, Mike.\"  \"Don't I tell you I'll walk?\" growled the prisoner.  \"And let us have all our trouble for nothing?  No, my lad, it's too late.  Ready there! Up with him.  Good morning, sir.  March!\"  The men lent themselves"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],["title","The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#5)"],["body","to the task, for Mike was thoroughly disliked; and a few minutes later there was a crowd gathering and following Mike Bannock as he was borne off, spread-eagled and half tipsy, to ponder on the theft and his chances in the cold damp place known in Bristol as the lock-up.  Don Lavington stood in the office, waiting for his uncle to speak.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A STUBBORN DISPOSITION.  \"Stop!\"  Don had taken his hat, and, seeing his uncle apparently immersed in a letter, was about to yield to his curiosity and follow the constable, when, as he reached the door, his uncle's word thundered out and made him turn and go on with his writing in response to a severe look and a pointing finger.  From time to time the boy looked up furtively as he sat, and wondered why his uncle did not say anything more about the money.  But the time glided on, and the struggle between his desire to speak out frankly and his indignant wounded pride continued.  A dozen times over he was on the point of crossing to the stern-looking old man, and begging him to listen and believe, but Uncle Josiah sat there with the most uncompromising of expressions on his face, and Don dared not speak.  He dared not trust himself for very shame, as the incident had so upset him, that he felt sure that he must break down and cry like a child if he attempted to explain.  After a time there was the sound of voices talking and laughing, and the click of the heavy latch of the gate.  Then through the open windows came the deep _burr burr_ of Jem's bass, and the shrill inquiring tones of Sally Wimble, as she eagerly questioned her lord.  Then there were steps, some of which passed the office door; and Don, as he sat with his head bent over a ledger, knew exactly whose steps those were, and where the makers of those steps were going to the different warehouses in the great yard.  Directly after Jem's foot was heard, and he tapped at the door, pushed it a little way, and waited.  \"Come in,\" said Uncle Josiah, sharply.  Jem entered, doffing his cocked hat, and casting a sympathising look at Don, who raised his head.  Then seeing that his employer was deeply immersed in the letter he was writing, Jem made a series of gesticulations with his hat, supplemented by some exceedingly queer grimaces, all meant as a kind of silent language, which was very expressive, but quite incomprehensible to Don.  \"Well?\" said Uncle Josiah, sharply.  \"Beg pardon, sir!  Thought you'd like to hear how we got on?\"  \"Well?\"  \"Went pretty quiet, sir, till we got about half-way there, and then he begun kicking like mad--leastways he didn't kick, because his legs was tied, but he let go all he could, and it was hard work to hold the ladder.\"  \"And he is now safely locked up?\"  \"Yes, sir, and I've been thinking, sir, as he must have took that money when Master Don here was up in the warehouse along o' me.\"  \"I daresay we shall find all out by-and-by, Wimble,\" said the old merchant, coldly.  \"That will do, now.\"  Jem looked uneasily at Don, as he turned his hat round to make sure which was the right way on, and moved slowly toward the door.  \"Which, begging your pardon, sir, you don't think now as--\"  \"Well?\" said the old merchant, sharply, for Jem had stopped.  \"Think as Mrs Wimble picked up any of the money, sir?\"  \"No, no, my man, of course not.\"  \"Thankye, sir, I'm glad of that; and if I might make so bold, sir, about Master Don--\"  \"What do you wish to say, man?\"  \"Oh, nothing, sir, only I'm quite sure, sir, as it was all Mike Bannock's doing, and--\"  \"I think you had better go on with your work, Wimble, which you do understand, and not meddle with things that are beyond you.\"  \"Certainly, sir, certainly,\" said Jem, quickly.  \"Just going, sir;\" and giving Don a sympathetic look, he hurried out, but had hardly closed the door before he opened it again.  \"Beg pardon, sir, Mrs Lavington, sir, and Miss Kitty.\"  Don started from his stool, crimson with mortification.  His mother! What would Uncle Josiah say?  Jem Wimble gave Don another look full of condolence before he closed the door, leaving Mrs Lavington and her niece in the office.  Mrs Lavington's face was full of anxiety and care, as she glanced from her son to her brother and back again, while Kitty's was as full of indignant reproof as she darted an angry look at Don, and then frowned and looked straight down at the floor.  \"Well?\" said the old merchant, coldly, \"why have you come?  You know I do not like you to bring Kitty here to the business place.\"  \"I--I heard--\" faltered Mrs Lavington, who stood in great awe of her brother when he was in one of his stern moods.  \"Heard?  Well, what did you hear?\"  \"Such terrible news, Josiah.\"  \"Well, well, what?\"  \"Oh, my brother!\" she exclaimed, wildly, as she stepped forward and caught his hand, \"tell me it is not true.\"  \"How can I tell you what is not true when I don't know what you are talking about,\" cried the old man, impatiently.  \"My dear Laura, do you think I have not worries enough without your coming here?\"  \"Yes, yes; I know, dear.\"  \"And you ought to know that I shall do what is just and right.\"  \"I am sure of that, Josiah, but I felt obliged to come.  Kitty and I were out shopping, and we met a crowd.\"  \"Then you should have turned down a side street.\"  \"But they were your men in the midst, and directly after I saw little Sally Wimble following.\"  \"Oh, she was, was she?\" cried the old man, glad of some one on whom to vent his spleen.  \"That woman goes.  How dare she leave the gates when her husband is out?  I shall be having the place robbed again.\"  \"Yes, that is what she said, Josiah--that you had been robbed, and that Don--my boy--oh, no, no, no; say it is not true.\"  Mrs Lavington looked wildly from one to the other, but there was a dead silence, and in a few minutes the poor woman's manner had entirely changed.  When she first spoke it was as the timid, shrinking, affectionate woman; now it was as the mother speaking in defence of her child.  \"I say it is not true,\" she cried.  \"You undertook to be a father to my poor boy, and now you charge him with having robbed you.\"  \"Laura, be calm,\" said the old merchant, quietly; \"and you had better take Kitty back home and wait.\"  \"You have always been too stern and harsh with the poor boy,\" continued Mrs Lavington, without heeding him.  \"I was foolish ever to come and trust to you.  How dare you charge him with such a crime?\"  \"I did not charge him with any crime, my dear Laura,\" said the old merchant, gravely.  \"Then it is not true?\"  \"It is true that I have been robbed, and that the man whom Lindon has persisted in making his companion, in spite of all I have said to the contrary, has charged him with the base, contemptible crime of robbing the master who trusted him.\"  \"But it is not true, Josiah; and that is what you always do, treat my poor boy as if he were your servant instead of your nephew--your sister's boy.\"  \"I treat Lindon as if he were my son when we are at home,\" said the old man, quietly.  \"When we are here at the office I treat him as my clerk, and I trust him to look after my interests, and to defend me from dishonest people.\"  Don looked up, and it was on his lips to say, \"Indeed, uncle, I always have done so,\" when the old man's next words seemed to chill and harden him.  \"But instead of doing his duty by me, I have constantly had to reprove him for making a companion of a man whom I weakly, and against my better judgment, allowed in the yard; and the result is I have been robbed, and this man accuses Lindon of committing the robbery, and bribing him to silence.\"  \"But it is not true, Josiah.  My son could not be guilty of such a crime.\"  \"He will have every opportunity of disproving it before the magistrates,\" said Uncle Josiah, coldly.  \"Magistrates!--my boy?\" exclaimed Mrs Lavington, wildly.  \"Oh, no, no, no, brother; you will not proceed to such extremities as these.  My boy before the magistrates.  Impossible!\"  \"The matter is out of my hands, now,\" said the old merchant, gravely. \"I was bound to charge that scoundrel labourer with the theft.  I could not tell that he would accuse your son of being the principal in the crime.\"  \"But you will stop it now for my sake, dear.  Don, my boy, why do you not speak, and beg your uncle's forgiveness?\"  Don remained silent, with his brow wrinkled, his chin upon his breast, and a stubborn look of anger in his eyes, as he stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning back against his desk.  \"Do you hear me, Don?  Tell your uncle it is not true, and beg him to help you clear yourself from this disgrace.\"  The lad made no reply, merely crossing his legs, and made his shoe-buckles rasp together as he slowly moved his feet.  \"Don!\"  He looked up strangely, met his mother's earnest appealing gaze, and for the moment his better nature prevailed; but as he looked from her to his uncle, and saw the old man's grey eyes fixed upon him searchingly, a feeling of obstinate anger swept over him again, and made him set his teeth, as something seemed to whisper to him, \"No; you told the truth, and he would not believe you.  Let him prove you guilty if he can!\"  It was not the first time in history that a boy had stubbornly fought against his better self, and allowed the worst part of his nature to prevail.  \"Do you not hear me, Don?\" cried his mother.  \"Why do you not speak?\"  Don remained silent, and Kitty, as she looked at him, angrily uttered an impatient ejaculation.  \"Don, my son, for my sake speak to your uncle.  Do you not hear me?\"  \"Yes, mother.\"  \"Then appeal to him to help you.  Ask him to forgive you if you have done wrong.\"  \"And she believes me guilty, too,\" thought Don, as he scowled at his feet.  \"But you have not done wrong, my boy.  I, your mother, will not believe it of you.\"  Don's better self began to force down that side of his mental scale.  \"You may have been weak and foolish, Don, but nothing worse.\"  The evil scale went down now in turn, and with it the"]]]
