Probably it gave entrance to the room from which faces had stared out on the drive; probably the same curious faces were peering forth through that crack at this very moment.  The bedroom bore a bleak look, despite the fact that the furniture was all in threes--three narrow beds, three washstands, three chests of drawers--topped by miniature mirrors--and three small cane-seated chairs.  Each of the three inmates had a portion of the room to herself, and against the wall stood two folding screens, evidently designed to insure privacy.  Dreda noted with dismay that the two ends of the room, the one next the window and the one next the door, already bore signs of occupation.  Her brow clouded, and instead of the usual polite remarks of approval, out shot an impetuous question:  \"Have I to take the middle?  I'd rather have an end!\"  \"Susan and Nancy have occupied the same beds for the last year.  All are equally comfortable.\"  \"There ought to be three screens.  I want two to shut myself in. Suppose one of the others didn't want hers up!\"  \"Why suppose disagreeables, my dear?  It is a great mistake.  I feel sure your companions will consider your comfort as thoughtfully as their own.  Hang your jacket on the pegs; then you can come to your classroom, to be introduced to your companions.  Take off your hat.\"  Dreda pulled a face in the mirror.  She felt cross and ill-used.  At home she was accustomed to a big, beautiful room all to herself; she did not at all enjoy the prospect of owning a third of this chill grey dormitory.  She took off her hat--conscious that Miss Bretherton's eyes were regarding the tomato-topped pin with silent disapproval--wriggled out of her coat, and bestowed a series of pats and pulls to hair, necktie, and blouse.  Being one of the happy people who feel cheered rather than depressed by the sight of her own reflection in the glass, she followed the head mistress downstairs without any of the trepidations of nervousness which afflict most new girls, and was by no means surprised when that lady made straight for the doorway of Number 5.  It opened, and six girls were discovered seated before a table, wearing expressions of preternatural solemnity.  One of the number wore spectacles; a second had a broad band of metal over her front teeth; a third had red hair and a thick powdering of freckles; \"The Currant Buns\" wore dresses of yellowy-brown tweed, which in Dreda's eyes made them appear \"bunnier\" than ever.  So much was taken in by the first lightning glance, as at the appearance of Miss Bretherton the girls leapt mechanically to their feet and stood stolidly at attention.  \"Girls, this is your new companion, Etheldreda Saxon.  She is to share Number 20 with Susan and Nancy, and I expect will be in the fourth form. You had better leave your books and have a little chat beside the fire, until Miss Drake is ready.  You may tell her that I gave you permission.\"  She left the room and shut the door behind her, and Dreda was left face to face with her new companions.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  For a moment the six girls retained their former positions, staring with blank, expressionless faces at the new comer.  Then Mary Webster, the eldest of the \"Currant Buns,\" advanced with outstretched hand, followed by her two younger sisters.  \"How do you do?\"  \"How do you do?\"  \"How do you do?\"  \"So glad to see you.\"  \"So glad--\"  \"Very glad--\"  The murmurs died into silence, while Dreda smiled a radiant encouragement.  \"Quite well, thank you.  But rather cold.  May we poke the fire?  My feet--\"  She tapped expressively on the floor, whereupon Mary Webster poked discreetly at the fire and Susan, the youngest of the sisters, pushed a chair into the cosiest corner.  The other three girls had come forward by this time, and introduced themselves in due form.  \"How do you do?  I'm Barbara Moore.  It's hateful to be a new girl!\"  \"How do you do?  I'm Norah Grey.  Sorry you're cold.\"  \"How do you do?  I'm Nancy.  Tell me truthfully--_Do you snore_?\"  Dreda laughed gaily.  \"Sometimes--when I lie on my back.  I do it on purpose, because you dream such thrilling dreams.  And I yell horribly when I come to the bad bits.\"  \"Something will have to be done!\" said Nancy, darkly.  She was the girl with the band over her front teeth.  It was ugly, but fascinating; one felt constrained to look at it, and looking at it could not help noticing how curved and red were the lips, how darkly lashed the long grey eyes.  Nancy was evidently a person to be reckoned with.  She sat herself down by the fire, stretched out her feet to the blaze, and appeared to be lost in thought.  Dreda longed to talk to her, to inquire what she meant by that mysterious \"something,\" but the \"Currant Buns\" were clustering round her, regarding her with anxiously proprietary airs as if, having the honour of a personal acquaintance, it was their due to receive the first attention.  Dreda felt quite like a celebrity, on the point of being interviewed by a trio of reporters; but as usual she preferred to play the part of questioner herself.  \"Were you doing prep when I came in?  What classes are you taking to- day?  I feel as if I've forgotten everything.  One always does in the holidays, doesn't one?  Such a bore having to grind through it all again.  Seems such a waste of time.\"  \"Have you a bad memory?  Miss Drake, our English governess, is especially clever at developing the powers of memory.  And holiday tasks are so useful, too; don't you find them so?  It is impossible to forget, if one has to study for an elaborate thesis.\"  \"The--what?\" questioned Dreda blankly.  \"But whoever _does_ study in the holidays?  I don't!  If you did, they wouldn't be holidays.  So stupid! Holidays are for rest and fun.  Bad enough to have lessons for two- thirds of the year.  One's brain must have _some_ rest!\"  She ended on quite an indignant note, and her companions stared at her with a mingling of admiration and dismay.  Such a vivid bit of colouring had not been seen for many a long day in that neutral-tinted room. Yellow hair, pink cheeks, red lips, blue dress--she was positively dazzling to behold.  The two younger Miss Websters appeared absorbed in admiration, but the eldest and cleverest-looking of the three pursed up her lips with an air of disapproval and said primly:  \"It depends upon one's _idea_ of rest, doesn't it?  Leisure may mean only a time of amusement, but it's a rather poor conception of the word. The ancient Greeks understood by it a time of _congenial_ work, as distinguished from work which they were obliged to do.  Their necessary work was undertaken in order that they might obtain a time of leisure, but when it came, instead of wasting it in foolish and passing amusement, they used it to strengthen their intellect and to store up ennobling thoughts.\"  \"How did they do that, pray?\"  Dreda put the question with the air of one launching a poser, but Mary Webster showed no signs of discomfiture.  \"They used to meet together in little companies, and discuss the deepest and most important topics of the day--\"  \"I expect they gossiped horribly!\"  \"And they watched the dramas--\"  \"I call that amusement!  I wouldn't mind doing that myself.\"  \"But the Greek dramas were not light and vapid like modern plays.  They dealt with serious subjects, and the audience often used to commit the words to memory as a mental exercise.\"  Dreda yawned.  \"Ah, well,\" she conceded indulgently, \"it's a long while ago!  One mustn't be hard on them, poor dears, for they knew no better.  I don't approve of girls bothering their heads about ancient Greeks.  Boys have to, for examinations, but if we want to grow up nice, domesticated women it's better to learn modern things, and leave those old fusties alone. They do one no good.\"  The girls stared at her in stunned surprise.  Agnes, the second Webster, dropped her chin to an abnormal length; the youngest, Susan, bit nervously at her lips; Mary cleared her throat and showed signs of returning to the attack, but Dreda was already tired of the subject, and made a diversion by leaping from her seat and approaching the table where piles of blue-covered exercise books were neatly arranged at intervals of about a yard apart.  \"Let me look at your books, and see what you are doing!  I didn't bring any books till I saw what you used.  I expect they will be the same. All school books are.  I've got the ones Rowena used.\"  She broke off, staring with dismay at the underlined questions which met her eye in one of Agnes's neatly written books:  \"_Characterise the work of Praxiteles, comparing it with that of Phidias_.\"  \"_Describe the Caryatids of the Erectheum_.\"  \"_More_ Greeks!  How awful!  You seem saturated in Greece.\"  She threw down the book impatiently and took up another.  \"Write a short essay on Chaucer (I know Chaucer!) and his times (When did he live?  Ages ago, I know, for he couldn't spell), dwelling on (1) the state of society as shown by the attitude of Wycliffe to the Pope, and the higher clergy; (2) the peasants' revolt\"--Dreda looked round with horrified eyes. \"_What_ a thing!  Do you often have essays like that?  Your governess must be a man in disguise!\"  \"She is exceedingly clever and well read, and a most interesting and original teacher.\"  \"Humph!--I prefer the old school!  Our governess gives us essays on Spring, and Happiness, and quotations from poetry.  They are far better, for if you don't know anything, you can make it up.  You know the sort of thing.  `One has often felt--' `Should we not all--' `At this season of the year our hearts overflow--' I assure you I have often sat down not knowing what on earth I was going to say, and have written _pages_! That's far better for you than learning dull facts about people who were dead and buried hundreds of years ago, because it exercises your imagination and resource, and they are so useful for a woman.

If so, you know how the rocky shores stretch out now and then clear into the ocean, and fret the salt waves till they are all in a foam. Old Ocean is not to be so set at defiance and have his rightful territory wrung from him, without taking his revenge after his own fashion. Far up into the land he sends his arms, and crooks and bends and makes his way amid the rocks, and finally falls asleep in some quiet harbor, where the tall pines stand by the shore to sing him a lullaby.  In just such a spot as this the town we shall call Fairport was built. Axe in one hand and Bible in the other, stern settlers here found a home. Strong hard-featured sons, and fair rosy-cheeked daughters made glad the rude cabins that were soon scattered along the shore. The axe was plied in the woods, and the needle by the fireside, and yet grim Poverty was ever shaking her fist in the very faces of the settlers, and whispering sad things of what the uncertain future might have in store for them.  Cheerily they bore the hardships of the present hour, and a deaf ear they turned to all such whispers. Yet those settlers were sensible, matter-of-fact men; and it was soon plain to them, that healthful as were the breezes that made so rosy the cheeks of their daughters, Fairport was not the very best site in the world for a settlement, at least if its people were to depend on the thin and rocky soil won from the forest, which scarcely produced the bare necessaries of life.  Was Fairport given up in despair? No, no. Her settlers were not the men to be so daunted and foiled. If the land was unkindly, they could take to the water; and so they did, to a man. Some were off to the Newfoundland Banks, tossing about the codfish, and piling them up into stacks that were more profitable than any hay of their own raising. Some were on board swift vessels, doing a good share of the carrying trade between the West Indies and the New England cities. Some were seeking the whale far in the northern seas; while others, less enterprising, were content to fish nearer home for all sorts of eatable dwellers in the sea, from halibut to herring.  Now a new day had begun for Fairport. The original cabins began to tower in the air or encroach on the submissive gardens, as building after building was added by the prosperous owners. Miniature villas, with a wealth of useless piazzas, appeared in the neighborhood of the town, and substantial wharves bordered one side of the quiet harbor, and gave a welcome to the shipping that seemed to grow and cluster there like the trees of a forest.  Fairport had passed the struggles of its early youth when our story begins, though there were gray-haired citizens yet within its borders who could tell how the bears had once looked in at their cabin windows, and the pine-trees had stood thick in what was now the main street of the rising town.     CHAPTER II.  THE YOUNG ORATOR.   The boys of Fairport were an amphibious set, who could live on land truly, but were happiest when in or near the water. To fish and swim, row, trim the sail, and guide the rudder, were accomplishments they all could boast. A bold, hardy, merry set they were; and but for the schoolmaster's rod and the teaching of their pious mothers, might have been as ignorant as oysters and merciless as the sharks. Master Penrose had whipped into most of them the elements of a plain English education, and gentle mothers had power to soften and rule these rough boys, when perhaps a stronger hand would have failed.  Master Penrose always gave a full holiday on Saturday. Then the wharves were sure to swarm with the mischievous little chaps, all eager to carry out some favorite plan for amusement, in which old Ocean was sure to be engaged as a play-fellow. Poor indeed was the lad who had not a fish-hook and line with which to try his skill. The very youngest had his tiny boat to be launched, while his elders were planning sailing-parties, or jumping and leaping in the water like so many dolphins.  Boys like to have a leader, some one they look up to as superior to the rest, and capable of deciding knotty questions, and \"going ahead\" in all times of doubt and difficulty. Blair Robertson occupied this position among the youngsters of Fairport. He had lawfully won this place among his fellows and \"achieved greatness,\" by being the best scholar at the academy, as well as the boldest swimmer, most skilful fisherman, and most experienced sailor among all the boys for miles along the coast. It was Blair Robertson's boast that he belonged to the nineteenth century, and grew old with it. It was doubtful whether the bold lad considered this age of progress as honored by his playing his part in its drama, or whether he claimed a reflected glory, as having been born at the very dawn of that century which promised so much for the thronging millions of our world.  Be that as it may, Joe Robertson the pilot and Margaret his wife rejoiced, in the year 1800, over their first and only child. Thirteen years had swept by, and the honest couple were now as proud of that brave, strong boy as they had been of their baby, and with better reason.  Troublous times had come upon their native land. War had been declared with England. All Fairport was ablaze at the idea of American seamen being forced to serve on English ships, and of decks whose timber grew in the free forests of Maine or North Carolina, being trodden by the unscrupulous feet of British officers with insolent search-warrants in their hands.  Blair Robertson had his own views on these subjects--views which we find him giving forth to his devoted followers one sunny Saturday afternoon.  Blair was mounted on a sugar hogshead which stood in front of one of the warehouses on the wharf. From this place of eminence he looked down on a constantly increasing crowd of youthful listeners. A half hour before, a row of little legs had been hanging over the side of the wharf, while their owners were intent upon certain corks and lines that danced or quivered amid the waves below. Now the lines were made fast to stone and log, while the small fishermen stood agape to listen to the fluent orator.  This was but the nucleus of the gathering crowd. Every boy who came near the eager circle must of course stop to find out what was going on; and it was with no little pride that Blair beheld the dozens of faces soon upturned to his.  Blair might have remembered that if there had been but a dead dog in the centre of the group, there would have been an equal gathering and pushing to know the cause of the meeting; but he, like many an older"]]]
