Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,     But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,    And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,     And off into the mountain scrub they flew.     Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black     Resounded to the thunder of their tread,    And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back     From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.    And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,     Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;    And the old man muttered fiercely, 'We may bid the mob good day,     _NO_ man can hold them down the other side.'     When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull,     It well might make the boldest hold their breath,    The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full     Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.    But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,     And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,    And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,     While the others stood and watched in very fear.     He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,     He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,    And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat --     It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.    Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,     Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;    And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,     At the bottom of that terrible descent.     He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill,     And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,    Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,     As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.    Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met     In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals    On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,     With the man from Snowy River at their heels.     And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.     He followed like a bloodhound on their track,    Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,     And alone and unassisted brought them back.    But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,     He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;    But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,     For never yet was mountain horse a cur.     And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise     Their torn and rugged battlements on high,    Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze     At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,    And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway     To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,    The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day,     And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.     Old Pardon, the Son of Reprieve       You never heard tell of the story?     Well, now, I can hardly believe!    Never heard of the honour and glory     Of Pardon, the son of Reprieve?    But maybe you're only a Johnnie     And don't know a horse from a hoe?    Well, well, don't get angry, my sonny,     But, really, a young un should know.     They bred him out back on the 'Never',     His mother was Mameluke breed.    To the front -- and then stay there -- was ever     The root of the Mameluke creed.    He seemed to inherit their wiry     Strong frames -- and their pluck to receive --    As hard as a flint and as fiery     Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.     We ran him at many a meeting     At crossing and gully and town,    And nothing could give him a beating --     At least when our money was down.    For weight wouldn't stop him, nor distance,     Nor odds, though the others were fast,    He'd race with a dogged persistence,     And wear them all down at the last.     At the Turon the Yattendon filly     Led by lengths at the mile-and-a-half,    And we all began to look silly,     While _HER_ crowd were starting to laugh;    But the old horse came faster and faster,     His pluck told its tale, and his strength,    He gained on her, caught her, and passed her,     And won it, hands-down, by a length.     And then we swooped down on Menindie     To run for the President's Cup --    Oh! that's a sweet township -- a shindy     To them is board, lodging, and sup.    Eye-openers they are, and their system     Is never to suffer defeat;    It's 'win, tie, or wrangle' -- to best 'em     You must lose 'em, or else it's 'dead heat'.     We strolled down the township and found 'em     At drinking and gaming and play;    If sorrows they had, why they drowned 'em,     And betting was soon under way.    Their horses were good 'uns and fit 'uns,     There was plenty of cash in the town;    They backed their own horses like Britons,     And, Lord! how _WE_ rattled it down!     With gladness we thought of the morrow,     We counted our wagers with glee,    A simile homely to borrow --     'There was plenty of milk in our tea.'    You see we were green; and we never     Had even a thought of foul play,    Though we well might have known that the clever     Division would 'put us away'.     Experience 'docet', they tell us,     At least so I've frequently heard,    But, 'dosing' or 'stuffing', those fellows     Were up to each move on the board:    They got to his stall -- it is sinful     To think what such villains would do --    And they gave him a regular skinful     Of barley -- green barley -- to chew.     He munched it all night, and we found him     Next morning as full as a hog --    The girths wouldn't nearly meet round him;     He looked like an overfed frog.    We saw we were done like a dinner --     The odds were a thousand to one    Against Pardon turning up winner,     'Twas cruel to ask him to run.     We got to the course with our troubles,     A crestfallen couple were we;    And we heard the 'books' calling the doubles --     A roar like the surf of the sea;    And over the tumult and louder     Rang 'Any price Pardon, I lay!'    Says Jimmy, 'The children of Judah     Are out on the warpath to-day.'     Three miles in three heats: -- Ah, my sonny,     The horses in those days were stout,    They had to run well to win money;     I don't see such horses about.    Your six-furlong vermin that scamper     Half-a-mile with their feather-weight up;    They wouldn't earn much of their damper     In a race like the President's Cup.     The first heat was soon set a-going;     The Dancer went off to the front;    The Don on his quarters was showing,     With Pardon right out of the hunt.    He rolled and he weltered and wallowed --     You'd kick your hat faster, I'll bet;    They finished all bunched, and he followed     All lathered and dripping with sweat.     But troubles came thicker upon us,     For while we were rubbing him dry    The stewards came over to warn us:     'We hear you are running a bye!    If Pardon don't spiel like tarnation     And win the next heat -- if he can --    He'll earn a disqualification;     Just think over _THAT_, now, my man!'     Our money all gone and our credit,     Our horse couldn't gallop a yard;    And then people thought that _WE_ did it!     It really was terribly hard.    We were objects of mirth and derision     To folk in the lawn and the stand,    And the yells of the clever division     Of 'Any price Pardon!' were grand.     We still had a chance for the money,     Two heats still remained to be run;    If both fell to us -- why, my sonny,     The clever division were done.    And Pardon was better, we reckoned,     His sickness was passing away,    So he went to the post for the second     And principal heat of the day.     They're off and away with a rattle,     Like dogs from the leashes let slip,    And right at the back of the battle     He followed them under the whip.    They gained ten good lengths on him quickly     He dropped right away from the pack;    I tell you it made me feel sickly     To see the blue jacket fall back.     Our very last hope had departed --     We thought the old fellow was done,    When all of a sudden he started     To go like a shot from a gun.    His chances seemed slight to embolden     Our hearts; but, with teeth firmly set,    We thought, 'Now or never!  The old 'un     May reckon with some of 'em yet.'     Then loud rose the war-cry for Pardon;     He swept like the wind down the dip,    And over the rise by the garden,     The jockey was done with the whip    The field were at sixes and sevens --     The pace at the first had been fast --    And hope seemed to drop from the heavens,     For Pardon was coming at last.     And how he did come!  It was splendid;     He gained on them yards every bound,    Stretching out like a greyhound extended,     His girth laid right down on the ground.    A shimmer of silk in the cedars     As into the running they wheeled,    And out flashed the whips on the leaders,     For Pardon had collared the field.     Then right through the ruck he came sailing --     I knew that the battle was won --    The son of Haphazard was failing,     The Yattendon filly was done;    He cut down the Don and the Dancer,     He raced clean away from the mare --    He's in front!  Catch him now if you can, sir!     And up went my hat in the air!     Then loud from the lawn and the garden     Rose offers of 'Ten to one _ON!_'    'Who'll bet on the field?  I back Pardon!'     No use; all the money was gone.    He came for the third heat light-hearted,     A-jumping and dancing about;    The others were done ere they started     Crestfallen, and tired, and worn out.     He won it, and ran it much faster     Than even the first, I believe    Oh, he was the daddy, the master,     Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.    He showed 'em the method to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/213"],["title","The Man from Snowy River (#2)"],["body","--     The boy sat as still as a stone --    They never could see him for gravel;     He came in hard-held, and alone.         .   .   .   .   .     But he's old -- and his eyes are grown hollow;      Like me, with my thatch of the snow;    When he dies, then I hope I may follow,     And go where the racehorses go.    I don't want no harping nor singing --     Such things with my style don't agree;    Where the hoofs of the horses are ringing     There's music sufficient for me.     And surely the thoroughbred horses     Will rise up again and begin    Fresh races on far-away courses,     And p'raps they might let me slip in.    It would look rather well the race-card on     'Mongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things,    'Angel Harrison's black gelding Pardon,     Blue halo, white body and wings.'     And if they have racing hereafter,     (And who is to say they will not?)    When the cheers and the shouting and laughter     Proclaim that the battle grows hot;    As they come down the racecourse a-steering,     He'll rush to the front, I believe;    And you'll hear the great multitude cheering     For Pardon, the son of Reprieve.     Clancy of the Overflow       I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better     Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,    He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,     Just 'on spec', addressed as follows, 'Clancy, of The Overflow'.     And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,     (And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)    'Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:     'Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are.'         .   .   .   .   .     In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy     Gone a-droving 'down the Cooper' where the Western drovers go;    As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,     For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.     And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him     In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,    And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,     And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.         .   .   .   .   .     I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy     Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,    And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city     Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all     And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle     Of the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street,    And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,     Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.     And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me     As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,    With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,     For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.     And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,     Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,    While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal --     But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of 'The Overflow'.     Conroy's Gap       This was the way of it, don't you know --     Ryan was 'wanted' for stealing sheep,    And never a trooper, high or low,     Could find him -- catch a weasel asleep!    Till Trooper Scott, from the Stockman's Ford --     A bushman, too, as I've heard them tell --    Chanced to find him drunk as a lord     Round at the Shadow of Death Hotel.     D'you know the place?  It's a wayside inn,     A low grog-shanty -- a bushman trap,    Hiding away in its shame and sin     Under the shelter of Conroy's Gap --    Under the shade of that frowning range,     The roughest crowd that ever drew breath --    Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange,     Were mustered round at the Shadow of Death.     The trooper knew that his man would slide     Like a dingo pup, if he saw the chance;    And with half a start on the mountain side     Ryan would lead him a merry dance.    Drunk as he was when the trooper came,     To him that did not matter a rap --    Drunk or sober, he was the same,     The boldest rider in Conroy's Gap.     'I want you, Ryan,' the trooper said,     'And listen to me, if you dare resist,    So help me heaven, I'll shoot you dead!'     He snapped the steel on his prisoner's wrist,    And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click,     Recovered his wits as they turned to go,    For fright will sober a man as quick     As all the drugs that the doctors know.     There was a girl in that rough bar     Went by the name of Kate Carew,    Quiet and shy as the bush girls are,     But ready-witted and plucky, too.    She loved this Ryan, or so they say,     And passing by, while her eyes were dim    With tears, she said in a careless way,     'The Swagman's round in the stable, Jim.'     Spoken too low for the trooper's ear,     Why should she care if he heard or not?    Plenty of swagmen far and near,     And yet to Ryan it meant a lot.    That was the name of the grandest horse     In all the district from east to west    In every show ring, on every course     They always counted the Swagman best.     He was a wonder, a raking bay --     One of the grand old Snowdon strain --    One of the sort that could race and stay     With his mighty limbs and his length of rein.    Born and bred on the mountain side,     He could race through scrub like a kangaroo,    The girl herself on his back might ride,     And the Swagman would carry her safely through.     He would travel gaily from daylight's flush     Till after the stars hung out their lamps,    There was never his like in the open bush,     And never his match on the cattle-camps.    For faster horses might well be found     On racing tracks, or a plain's extent,    But few, if any, on broken ground     Could see the way that the Swagman went.     When this girl's father, old Jim Carew,     Was droving out on the Castlereagh    With Conroy's cattle, a wire came through     To say that his wife couldn't live the day.    And he was a hundred miles from home,     As flies the crow, with never a track,    Through plains as pathless as ocean's foam,     He mounted straight on the Swagman's back.     He left the camp by the sundown light,     And the settlers out on the Marthaguy    Awoke and heard, in the dead of night,     A single horseman hurrying by.    He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo,     And many a mile of the silent plain    That lonely rider behind him threw     Before they settled to sleep again.     He rode all night and he steered his course     By the shining stars with a bushman's skill,    And every time that he pressed his horse     The Swagman answered him gamely still.    He neared his home as the east was bright,     The doctor met him outside the town:    'Carew!  How far did you come last night?'     'A hundred miles since the sun went down.'     And his wife got round, and an oath he passed,     So long as he or one of his breed    Could raise a coin, though it took their last     The Swagman never should want a feed.    And Kate Carew, when her father died,     She kept the horse and she kept him well:    The pride of the district far and wide,     He lived in style at the bush hotel.     Such was the Swagman; and Ryan knew     Nothing about could pace the crack;    Little he'd care for the man in blue     If once he got on the Swagman's back.    But how to do it?  A word let fall     Gave him the hint as the girl passed by;    Nothing but 'Swagman -- stable-wall;     'Go to the stable and mind your eye.'     He caught her meaning, and quickly turned     To the trooper:  'Reckon you'll gain a stripe    By arresting me, and it's easily earned;     Let's go to the stable and get my pipe,    The Swagman has it.'  So off they went,     And soon as ever they turned their backs    The girl slipped down, on some errand bent     Behind the stable, and seized an axe.     The trooper stood at the stable door     While Ryan went in quite cool and slow,    And then (the trick had been played before)     The girl outside gave the wall a blow.    Three slabs fell out of the stable wall --     'Twas done 'fore ever the trooper knew --    And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall,     Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through.     The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring     In the stable yard, and he slammed the gate,    But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring     At the fence, and the trooper fired too late,    As they raced away and his shots flew wide     And Ryan no longer need care a rap,    For never a horse that was lapped in hide     Could catch the Swagman in Conroy's Gap.     And that's the story.  You want to know     If Ryan came back to his Kate Carew;    Of course he should have, as stories go,     But the worst of it is, this story's true:    And in real life it's a certain rule,     Whatever poets and authors say    Of high-toned robbers and all their school,     These horsethief fellows aren't built that way.     Come back!  Don't hope it -- the slinking hound,     He sloped across to the Queensland side,    And sold the Swagman for fifty pound,     And stole the money, and more beside.    And took to drink, and by some good chance     Was killed -- thrown out of a stolen trap.    And that was the end of this small romance,     The end of the story of Conroy's Gap.     Our New Horse       The boys had come back from the races     All silent and down on their luck;    They'd backed 'em, straight out and for places,     But never a winner they struck.    They lost their good money on Slogan,     And fell, most uncommonly flat,    When Partner, the pride of the Bogan,     Was beaten by Aristocrat.     And one said, 'I move that"]]]
