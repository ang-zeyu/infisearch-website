Not very much, I am afraid; for I cannot restore to you the property of which you are robbed.  That appears to be gone beyond recall.  But I can do this for you--and it may possibly help you a little--I can give you a letter of introduction to a man who is under very heavy obligations to me, and who--being a thoroughly good fellow--will be more than glad to discharge those obligations if I will only afford him the opportunity to do so. You shall go to him and give him full and complete particulars of this terrible misfortune that has befallen you; and if there is anything at all to be saved out of the wreckage, he will save it for you, without fee and without reward--for my sake.  He, too, is a solicitor, but an honest one, as many still are, thank God; and it is a solicitor whose aid will be most useful to you in the unravelling of this tangled skein.\"  \"I say, Doctor, that is awfully good of you,\" exclaimed Dick, struggling to conceal his emotion of gratitude, after the manner of the Englishman, but not altogether succeeding.  \"If the matter concerned myself alone,\" he continued, \"I would not let you do this thing for me; but I must think of my poor mother, and for her sake must humble my pride and suppress the assertion of my independence so far as to accept your help, so kindly and generously offered.  And here let me say that there is no man on earth whose help I would so willingly accept as yours,\" he blundered on, dimly conscious that there had been something of ungraciousness in his speech; and so stopped dead, overcome with shame and confusion.  \"That is all right, my dear boy,\" returned Humphreys, smilingly laying his hand on Dick's shoulder; \"I know exactly how you feel, and very heartily respect your sense of sturdy independence, which is very estimable in its way, so long as it is not carried too far.  But, as a matter of fact, Dick, none of us is absolutely independent in this world, for almost every moment of our lives we are dependent upon somebody for assistance, in one shape or another, and it is not until that assistance is withheld that we are brought to realise the extent to which we are individually dependent upon our fellow creatures.  But I am moralising again--a habit which seems to be growing upon me since I came among these poor folk down here, and have been brought face to face with such a vast amount of misery that can be directly traced to ignorance and crime.  Just pass me over that stationery cabinet, will you? Thanks!  Now I will write to my friend Graham at once, and you had better call upon him at his chambers in Lincoln's Inn to-morrow morning at ten o'clock sharp, which is about the only hour of the day when you can be reasonably certain of finding him.\"  When Dick called upon Humphreys' friend Graham, upon the following morning, and sent in his letter of introduction, he soon had abundant evidence that the rising young solicitor was quite as busy a man as the Doctor had represented him to be; yet he was not too busy to respond promptly to his friend's claim upon him, actually leaving an important- looking client waiting in his outer office while he interviewed Dick and listened with the utmost patience to the story which the latter had to tell, questioning him occasionally, and making notes of his answers upon a writing pad.  At length, after an interview of over half an hour's duration, Graham closed the pad sharply and, rising, extended his hand to Dick, saying:  \"Thank you, Mr Maitland.  I believe I have now all the essential facts; and you may assure my friend Humphreys that I will take up the case with the utmost pleasure, and without loss of time; also that I will do my best for you and your mother.  From what you tell me I am inclined to imagine that the wreck of Cuthbertson's affairs will prove to be pretty complete, therefore I very strongly advise you not to reckon upon my being able to save anything for you out of the wreckage; but if there should by any chance be anything, you shall have it.  And now, good morning!  I am very pleased to have made your acquaintance; and as soon as I have anything definite to communicate I will write to you. Remember me very kindly to Humphreys.  Good morning!\"  The interview was certainly not very encouraging; but on the other hand it was by no means disappointing; for Dick had already quite made up his mind that every penny of his mother's money was lost.  It was, therefore, a very pleasant surprise to him when, about a fortnight later, a letter came from Graham announcing that he had succeeded in rescuing close upon five hundred pounds for Mrs Maitland from the ruins of Cuthbertson's estate, and that the good lady could have the money by presenting herself at the writer's office and going through certain formalities.    CHAPTER TWO.  DICK MAKES UP HIS MIND.  It was late in the evening of the day upon which Mrs Maitland, having fulfilled the formalities required of her by Graham, had received from him a cheque for the sum of four hundred and eighty-seven pounds, seventeen shillings, and eightpence, which, apart from the house in which she lived, represented all that remained to her of the very comfortable fortune left to her by her late husband.  Dick had escorted his mother up to town, and, upon the conclusion of the transaction, had taken her back to The Cedars; after which he had made the best of his way to 19 Paradise Street; for the moment had now arrived when he must come to an understanding with his friend Dr Julian Humphreys, and consult with him respecting the future.  Ten o'clock had struck a few minutes ago, a belated patient had been attended to and dismissed, the surgery had been closed by the simple process of drawing down the blind and locking the outer door, and now the two friends were sitting opposite each other in that same drug-scented apartment, conversing earnestly together, as Humphreys pulled contemplatively, yet somewhat vexedly, at a brier pipe which had seen so much service that it was now charred down to about half its original size.  \"The fact is,\" remarked Dick, in continuance of their conversation, \"that there is no other course open to me; for I am resolved that I will not touch a farthing of the money that your friend Graham has so cleverly rescued from the ruins of Cuthbertson's estate; every stiver of it will be required for the maintenance of the poor Mater while I am away.  And I must go away, because, as you yourself have admitted, there is no employment or occupation of any kind here at home to which, in my present condition of unpreparedness, I could turn my hand with any hope of earning a sufficient income to maintain her and myself, though ever so modestly; even if posts were to be had for the asking, which--in this country, at all events--they are not.  You know that to be the plain, unvarnished truth, do you not?\"  \"Yes,\" Humphreys answered unhesitatingly, \"it is true--unfortunately.\"  \"Very well, then,\" Dick resumed; \"that being the case, the next question is: Where am I to go, and what am I to do, in order to earn enough money to maintain myself and my mother in the meantime, and eventually to restore her to that position of security of which she was robbed by that rascal Cuthbertson?\"  \"_De mortuis nil nisi bonum_!\" reproved Humphreys gravely.  \"The poor chap has gone to answer for his sins, whatever they may have been, and there is an end of him, so far as you are concerned.  To rail at him now, and speak of him disparagingly, will not hurt him, or do you any good, Dick, my friend, so do not unnecessarily bespatter his memory. This by the way.  And now to return to our muttons.  The problem that you propound is indeed a hard one to solve; to many it would probably appear an impossibility.  But, although I am by no means an old man, I have been long enough in this world to have recognised that what many people deem impossibilities are nothing of the sort, if only one has the grit to face and tackle them.  It is grit, my boy, that makes impossibilities possible, and I believe you possess that quality in sufficient measure to enable you to accomplish great things.  The question is: What is the particular great thing which will meet your case?  What is the work which you are best fitted to do?  You are already very well up in the profession which you have chosen.  There is many a man in successful practice to-day who knows less about it than you do; but, unfortunately, you are not yet `qualified', therefore you cannot set up for yourself, even if you could afford the time to create a practice--which you cannot.  And as to becoming an unqualified assistant, that of course is out of the question; the pay is altogether too poor to justify the entertainment of that idea.  But there are countries where the restrictions are not nearly so great as they are in England; and there are others--beyond the pale of civilisation--where no restrictions at all exist, and where a clever man, with plenty of grit to back him up, might perhaps do remarkably well.  Still, to penetrate to such countries a man must take his life in his hands, and, even then, all his courage may prove insufficient to save him from an unspeakable, horrible death.  Now, what can you do besides doctoring?\"  \"Nothing that will help me in my present strait,\" answered Maitland.  \"I can sail a boat, swim, ride, or drive a horse, and I can shoot straight; consequently if I possessed sufficient influence I might be able to get a job as groom, stableman, or even under-gamekeeper.  But none of those things is good enough for me; I am capable of better things than grooming horses, cleaning harness, or looking after pheasants; I want employment that will bring me in good money, and I mean to have it too.\"  \"That's right, Dick; that's the way to talk,\" returned Humphreys approvingly.  \"Modesty is all right, a very desirable and admirable quality in every young man's character, and one which is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],["title","The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#3)"],["body"," far too seldom nowadays.  Modesty, however, is one thing, and self-depreciation quite another.  It is a mistake for anyone to underrate his own value, and, as you very truly say, you are capable of doing much better work than that needed in either of the occupations that you have named; therefore you are justified in insisting upon having it.  A man has a perfect right to the very best and most profitable work he is capable of doing; but he must get it for himself; it is no use for him to sit down supinely and demand that Providence shall put it into his hands.  The man who is worth his salt will get up and `hustle'--as the Americans tersely express it--and not rest until he has secured what he wants. Now, you, my boy, are very heavily handicapped.  You have neither money nor influence to help you to what you want, therefore you will have to depend upon `hustle' and grit alone; also you have no time to waste in looking about in this country for the kind of thing you want, which, even with all the `hustle' and grit imaginable, may take you months, or even years, to find.  No, as you said at the beginning of this conversation, you must go somewhere abroad to get what you want; and in a foreign land you may find even such despised accomplishments as riding, swimming, and straight shooting of the utmost value to you.  But in my opinion your mainstay must be the medical and surgical knowledge which you have acquired.  Now, whereabout on the face of this old globe of ours are you likely to be able to employ your knowledge to the best and most profitable account?  It should be where wealth is abundant, and where medical and surgical skill is pretty frequently in demand, also where there is plenty of scope for a young fellow who, like yourself, is imbued with the spirit of adventure.  Now, let me consider for a moment--where is the country which most nearly answers to these conditions?  What do you say to South Africa?  It is the land of gold and diamonds; it is not, I believe, overrun with medical men; and as to adventure--\" Humphreys shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands abroad expressively.  Dick's eyes sparkled and his face lit up with enthusiasm.  \"South Africa is the place for me, without a doubt,\" he exclaimed with animation.  \"It is, as you say, rich; it is also a land of unbounded possibilities; and-- But how am I to get there?  The passage money amounts to something considerable, and I have no money to spare for that sort of thing; also, as I have said, I will not take a penny from the Mater.\"  \"What about borrowing?\" suggested Humphreys.  \"As you know, Dick, I am not a rich man, but I have no doubt I could manage to--\"  \"No!\" interrupted Dick emphatically; \"a thousand times no.  It is like you, Doctor, to offer to help me out of your own exceedingly limited means, and I am more grateful to you than I have words to express; but I simply will not avail myself of your kindness, or that of anybody else indeed, for I should be starting with a millstone of debt hanging round my neck.  No, I have thought of a better way than that; I will work my passage out.\"  \"Work your passage out!\" ejaculated the Doctor, staggered, in spite of his whole-hearted belief in the virtues of self-help, at this bold suggestion on Dick's part.  \"In what capacity, pray?\"  \"Oh, as anything!\" returned Dick buoyantly; \"as ordinary seaman, cook's mate, stoker--what does it matter?  I will find a way, never fear.  I'll take a trot round the docks to-morrow, and it will be strange indeed if I cannot somewhere find a market for my labour.  Why, even the elementary knowledge of nautical matters that I have acquired in sailing my little single-handed cutter during holiday time will be of service to me.  I can steer, I can box the compass, I know the name of every sail on a full-rigged ship; and I will guarantee that before I have been forty-eight hours out I will know the function of every bit of running rigging, and where to lay my hand upon it in the dark.\"  \"Ay, I'll bet that you will, Dick,\" answered Humphreys, with enthusiasm as great as Dick's own.  \"And I have not much doubt as to your being able to get a berth as ordinary seaman; for you are a big strong fellow, and for mere pulling and hauling purposes any skipper ought to be glad to get hold of you.  Yes, I think we may consider that part of your problem solved.  But what about after your arrival in South Africa?  How do you propose to proceed at the end of the voyage when you have safely landed?  For you must remember that in all probability you will have no wages to draw; people who work their passages are usually shipped at the princely rate of pay of one shilling per month.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" said Dick.  \"Still, I shall have reached the scene of my great endeavour without cost, and that is the important thing.  After that I shall of course be obliged to trust to my own push and `hustle', as you call it, for it is impossible to make any definite plans at this distance from the scene of operations.\"  \"Quite so,\" agreed Humphreys.  \"And you must also remember that there is always the element of luck, or chance, or whatever you please to call it, in the background, and to be watched for.  Opportunity often presents itself literally at a moment's notice and in the most unexpected fashion, and the one who profits by it is he who is alert enough to seize it as it passes.  But there is one thing you must do, Dick; you must take with you a well-stocked chest of drugs, as well as your case of surgical instruments; and, since you will not let me lend you any money to help you on your way, you must allow me to make you a present of that medicine chest just as a token of my appreciation of the way in which you have conducted yourself as my pupil-- Nay, boy, you must not refuse me, for if you do I shall be deeply hurt as well as seriously offended.\"  \"Very well, then,\" acquiesced Dick, \"since you put it in that way, and so very strongly, I will accept your generous gift with a thousand most hearty thanks, not only for the gift itself, but also for the kindly feeling that prompts it.\"  \"My dear Dick,\" protested Humphreys, \"there is really no reason at all why you should feel so extraordinarily grateful, for in doing what I propose to do I shall only be very inadequately repaying you for much valuable assistance rendered, and much very pleasant companionship during the time of your pupilage with me.  And do not think that because I have not expressed much voluble regret at this abrupt severance of our connection I do not feel it, for I do very keenly, I assure you; but I see quite clearly that the thing is inevitable, therefore to complain about it would be both useless and foolish.  \"Now, there is one other way in which I can help you; and when I have explained to you how tremendous is the power which I propose to place in your hands you will understand, more clearly than I could show you in any other way, the absolute trust that I repose in you.  For I tell you this, Dick, in all sincerity, there is not another person in the whole circle of my acquaintance--and it is pretty wide--whom I feel I could safely trust with this power, so potent is it for evil as well as good. But I am convinced that I can trust you; and that is why I have determined to endow you with the ability to perform deeds which to many people will seem positively miraculous.  \"You have often expressed amazement at the uniform success which attends my treatment of even my most difficult cases, both medical and surgical, but especially the surgical; and I know, from the remarks you have made, that you attribute those successes purely to the extent of my knowledge. Well, of course, knowledge has something to do with it; but the true secret of my success lies in the free use which I make of hypnotism. Yes, no doubt you are surprised; for you have never seen me employ any of the well-known methods of the ordinary hypnotist.  Very true.  But my method is not the ordinary method at all; it is one which I claim as my own exclusive discovery, and it is as far in advance of ordinary hypnotism as that is in advance of the methods of the stage hypnotist.  \"Almost at the outset of my professional career I directed my attention to the investigation of hypnotism, determined to ascertain whether or not there was anything in the claims set up by its exponents; and I soon discovered that there was something in it, despite the disrepute cast upon it by the grotesque performances of certain so-called entertainers. There is no need for me to detail to you the successive steps by which I at length attained my present knowledge of the marvellous powers of the science.  Let it suffice me to say that by diligent study of it I eventually acquired such a mastery of it that it has enabled me to-- well, to put it mildly--succeed where but for it I must have failed. And a large measure of this success is due to the fact that I have discovered an infallible method of instantly hypnotising a patient without that patient's knowledge.  They are hypnotised, but they don't know it; haven't the remotest suspicion of it.  Then I convey to them a powerful suggestion that my treatment of them is going to be absolutely successful, and--there you have the whole secret.\"  Humphreys paused for a moment, as if considering whether or not he should say more; then he gazed abstractedly at his carefully kept finger nails, and his right hand wandered to his waistcoat pocket.  Then, looking up, he extended the hand toward Dick, saying:  \"Just lend me your penknife a moment, will you?\"  Dick produced the knife and held it out to Humphreys, who looked at it, then shrank back.  \"Good heavens, man,\" he exclaimed, \"I asked for a penknife, not for an adder!  Where did you get that brute from?\"  With an inarticulate cry, and an expression of unutterable disgust and loathing, Maitland dropped the penknife to the floor, and then stamped on it savagely, grinding the heel of his"]]]
