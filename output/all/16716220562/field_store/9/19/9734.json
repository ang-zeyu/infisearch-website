Then the smoke of the great fires under the melting pots begrimed the masts, sails, and cordage with soot.  The faces and hands of the men got so covered with oil and soot that it would have puzzled anyone to say whether they were white or black.  Their clothes, too, became so dirty that it was impossible to clean them.  But, indeed, whalemen do not much mind this.  In fact, they take a pleasure in all the dirt that surrounds them, because it is a sign of success in the main object of their voyage.  The men in a _clean_ whale ship are never happy.  When everything is filthy, and dirty, and greasy, and smoky, and black--decks, rigging, clothes, and person--it is then that the hearty laugh and jest and song are heard as the crew work busily, night and day, at their rough but profitable labour.  The operations of \"cutting in\" and \"trying out\" were matters of great interest to me the first time I saw them.  After having towed our whale to the ship, cutting in was immediately begun.  First, the carcass was secured near the head and tail with chains, and made fast to the ship; then the great blocks and ropes fastened to the main and fore mast for hoisting in the blubber were brought into play.  When all was ready, the captain and the two mates with Tom Lokins got upon the whale's body, with long-handled sharp spades or digging-knives.  With these they fell to work cutting off the blubber.  I was stationed at one of the hoisting ropes, and while we were waiting for the signal to \"hoist away\", I peeped over the side, and for the first time had a good look at the great fish.  When we killed it, so much of its body was down in the water that I could not see it very clearly, but now that it was lashed at full length alongside the ship, and I could look right down upon it, I began to understand more clearly what a large creature it was.  One thing surprised me much; the top of its head, which was rough and knotty like the bark of an old tree, was swarming with little crabs and barnacles, and other small creatures. The whale's head seemed to be their regular home!  This fish was by no means one of the largest kind, but being the first I had seen, I fancied it must be the largest fish in the sea.  Its body was forty feet long, and twenty feet round at the thickest part.  Its head, which seemed to me a great, blunt, shapeless thing, like a clumsy old boat, was eight feet long from the tip to the blowholes or nostrils; and these holes were situated on the back of the head, which at that part was nearly four feet broad.  The entire head measured about twenty-one feet round.  Its ears were two small holes, so small that it was difficult to discover them, and the eyes were also very small for so large a body, being about the same size as those of an ox.  The mouth was very large, and the under jaw had great ugly lips.  When it was dying, I saw these lips close in once or twice on its fat cheeks, which it bulged out like the leather sides of a pair of gigantic bellows.  It had two fins, one on each side, just behind the head.  With these, and with its tail, the whale swims and fights.  Its tail is its most deadly weapon.  The flukes of this one measured thirteen feet across, and with one stroke of this it could have smashed our largest boat in pieces.  Many a boat has been sent to the bottom in this way.  I remember hearing our first mate tell of a wonderful escape a comrade of his had in the Greenland Sea Fishery.  A whale had been struck, and, after its first run, they hauled up to it again, and rowed so hard that they ran the boat right against it.  The harpooner was standing on the bow all ready, and sent his iron cleverly into the blubber.  In its agony the whale reared its tail high out of the water, and the flukes whirled for a moment like a great fan just above the harpooner's head. One glance up was enough to show him that certain death was descending. In an instant he dived over the side and disappeared.  Next moment the flukes came down on the part of the boat he had just left, and cut it clean off; the other part was driven into the waves, and the men were left swimming in the water.  They were all picked up, however, by another boat that was in company, and the harpooner was recovered with the rest.  His quick dive had been the saving of his life.  I had not much time given me to study the appearance of this whale before the order was given to \"hoist away!\" so we went to work with a will.  The first part that came up was the huge lip, fastened to a large iron hook, called the blubber hook.  It was lowered into the blubber-room between decks, where a couple of men were stationed to stow the blubber away.  Then came the fins, and after them the upper jaw, with the whalebone attached to it.  The \"right\" whale has no teeth like the sperm whale.  In place of teeth it has the well-known substance called whalebone, which grows from the roof of its mouth in a number of broad thin plates, extending from the back of the head to the snout.  The lower edges of these plates of whalebone are split into thousands of hairs like bristles, so that the inside roof of a whale's mouth resembles an enormous blacking brush!  The object of this curious arrangement is to enable the whale to catch the little shrimps and small sea-blubbers, called \"medusa;\", on which it feeds.  I have spoken before of these last as being the little creatures that gave out such a beautiful pale-blue light at night.  The whale feeds on them.  When he desires a meal he opens his great mouth and rushes into the midst of a shoal of medusae; the little things get entangled in thousands among the hairy ends of the whalebone, and when the monster has got a large enough mouthful, he shuts his lower jaw and swallows what his net has caught.  The wisdom as well as the necessity of this arrangement is very plain. Of course, while dashing through the sea in this fashion, with his mouth agape, the whale must keep his throat closed, else the water would rush down it and choke him.  Shutting his throat then, as he does, the water is obliged to flow out of his mouth as fast as it flows in; it is also spouted up through his blowholes, and this with such violence that many of the little creatures would be swept out along with it but for the hairy-ended whalebone which lets the sea-water out, but keeps the medusae in.  Well, let us return to our \"cutting in\".  After the upper jaw came the lower jaw and throat, with the tongue.  This last was an enormous mass of fat, about as large as an ox, and it weighed fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds.  After this was got in, the rest of the work was simple.  The blubber of the body was peeled off in great strips, beginning at the neck and being cut spirally towards the tail.  It was hoisted on board by the blocks, the captain and mates cutting, and the men at the windlass hoisting, and the carcass slowly turning round until we got an unbroken piece of blubber, reaching from the water to nearly as high as the mainyard-arm.  This mass was nearly a foot thick, and it looked like fat pork.  It was cut off close to the deck, and lowered into the blubber-room, where the two men stationed there attacked it with knives, cut it into smaller pieces, and stowed it away.  Then another piece was hoisted on board in the same fashion, and so on we went till every bit of blubber was cut off; and I heard the captain remark to the mate when the work was done, that the fish was a good fat one, and he wouldn't wonder if it turned out to be worth 300 pounds.  Now, when this process was going on, a new point of interest arose which I had not thought of before, although my messmate, Tom Lokins, had often spoken of it on the voyage out.  This was the arrival of great numbers of sea-birds.  Tom had often told me of the birds that always keep company with whalers; but I had forgotten all about it until I saw an enormous albatross come sailing majestically through the air towards us.  This was the largest bird I ever saw, and no wonder, for it is the largest bird that flies.  Soon after that, another arrived, and although we were more than a thousand miles from any shore, we were speedily scented out and surrounded by hosts of gonies, stinkards, haglets, gulls, pigeons, petrels, and other sea-birds, which commenced to feed on pieces of the whale's carcass with the most savage gluttony.  These birds were dreadfully greedy.  They had stuffed themselves so full in the course of a short time, that they flew heavily and with great difficulty.  No doubt they would have to take three or four days to digest that meal!  Sharks, too, came to get their share of what was going.  But these savage monsters did not content themselves with what was thrown away; they were so bold as to come before our faces and take bites out of the whale's body.  Some of these sharks were eight and nine feet long, and when I saw them open their horrid jaws, armed with three rows of glistening white sharp teeth, I could well understand how easily they could bite off the leg of a man, as they often do when they get the chance.  Sometimes they would come right up on the whale's body with a wave, bite out great pieces of the flesh, turn over on their bellies, and roll off.  While I was looking over the side during the early part of that day, I saw a very large shark come rolling up in this way close to Tom Lokins's legs.  Tom made a cut at him with his blubber-spade, but the shark rolled off in time to escape the blow.  And after all it would not have done him much damage, for it is not easy to frighten or take the life out of a shark.  \"Hand me an iron and line, Bob,\" said Tom, looking up at me.  \"I've got a spite agin that feller.  He's been up twice already.  Ah! hand it down here, and two or three of ye stand by to hold on by the line. There he comes, the big villain!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21202"],["title","Fighting the Whales (#5)"],["body","shark came close to the side of the whale at that moment, and Tom sent the harpoon right down his throat.  \"Hold on hard,\" shouted Tom.  \"Aye, aye,\" replied several of the men as they held on to the line, their arms jerking violently as the savage fish tried to free itself. We quickly reeved a line through a block at the fore yard-arm, and hauled it on deck with much difficulty.  The scene that followed was very horrible, for there was no killing the brute.  It threshed the deck with its tail, and snapped so fiercely with its tremendous jaws, that we had to keep a sharp look-out lest it should catch hold of a leg.  At last its tail was cut off, the body cut open, and all the entrails' taken out, yet even after this it continued to flap and thresh about the deck for some time, and the heart continued to contract for twenty minutes after it was taken out and pierced with a knife.  I would not have believed this had I not seen it with my own eyes.  In case some of my readers may doubt its truth, I would remind them how difficult it is to kill some of those creatures with which we are all familiar.  The common worm, for instance, may be cut into a number of small pieces, and yet each piece remains alive for some time after.  The skin of the shark is valued by the whalemen, because, when cleaned and dry, it is as good as sand-paper, and is much used in polishing the various things they make out of whales' bones and teeth.  When the last piece of blubber had been cut off our whale, the great chain that held it to the ship's side was cast off, and the now useless carcass sank like a stone, much to the sorrow of some of the smaller birds, which, having been driven away by their bigger comrades, had not fed so heartily as they wished perhaps!  But what was loss to the gulls was gain to the sharks, which could follow the carcass down into the deep and devour it at their leisure.  \"Now, lads,\" cried the mate, when the remains had vanished, \"rouse up the fires, look alive, my hearties!\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" was the ready reply, cheerfully given, as every man sprang to his appointed duty.  And so, having \"cut in\" our whale, we next proceeded to \"try out\" the oil.     CHAPTER V  A STORM, A MAN OVERBOARD, AND A RESCUE  The scenes in a whaleman's life are varied and very stirring. Sometimes he is floating on the calm ocean, idling about the deck and whistling for a breeze, when all of a sudden the loud cry is heard, \"There she blows!\" and in a moment the boats are in the water, and he is engaged in all the toils of an exciting chase.  Then comes the battle with the great leviathan of the deep, with all its risks and dangers.  Sometimes he is unfortunate, the decks are clean, he has nothing to do.  At other times he is lucky, \"cutting in\" and \"trying out\" engage all his energies and attention.  Frequently storms toss him on the angry deep, and show him, if he will but learn the lesson, how helpless a creature he is, and how thoroughly dependent at all times for life, safety, and success, upon the arm of God.  \"Trying out\" the oil, although not so thrilling a scene as many a one in his career, is, nevertheless, extremely interesting, especially at night, when the glare of the fires in the try-works casts a deep-red glow on the faces of the men, on the masts and sails, and even out upon the sea.  The try-works consisted of two huge melting-pots fixed upon brick-work fireplaces between the fore and main masts.  While some of the men were down in the blubber-room cutting the \"blanket-pieces\", as the largest masses are called, others were pitching the smaller pieces on deck, where they were seized by two men who stood near a block of wood, called a \"horse\", with a mincing knife, to slash the junks so as to make them melt easily.  These were then thrown into the melting-pots by one of the mates, who kept feeding the fires with such \"scraps\" of blubber as remain after the oil is taken out.  Once the fires were fairly set agoing no other kind of fuel was required than \"scraps\" of blubber.  As the boiling oil rose it was baled into copper cooling-tanks.  It was the duty of two other men to dip it out of these tanks into casks, which were then headed up by our cooper, and stowed away in the hold.  As the night advanced the fires became redder and brighter by contrast, the light shone and glittered on the bloody decks, and, as we plied our dirty work, I could not help thinking, \"what would my mother say, if she could get a peep at me now?\"  The ship's crew worked and slept by watches, for the fires were not allowed to go out all night.  About midnight I sat down on the windlass to take a short rest, and began talking to one of the men, Fred Borders by name.  He was one of the quietest and most active men in the ship, and, being quite a young man, not more than nineteen, he and I drew to one another, and became very intimate.  \"I think we're goin' to have a breeze, Bob,\" said he, as a sharp puff of wind crossed the deck, driving the black smoke to leeward, and making the fire flare up in the try-works.  \"I hope it won't be a storm, then,\" said I, \"for it will oblige us to put out the fires.\"  Just then Tom Lokins came up, ordered Fred to go and attend to the fires, sat down opposite to me on the windlass, and began to \"lay down the law\" in regard to storms.  \"You see, Bob Ledbury,\" said he, beginning to fill his pipe, \"young fellers like you don't know nothin' about the weather--'cause why? you've got no experience.  Now, I'll put you up to a dodge consarning this very thing.\"  I never found out what was the dodge that Tom, in his wisdom, was to have put me up to, for at that moment the captain came on deck, and gave orders to furl the top-gallant sails.  Three or four of us ran up the rigging like monkeys, and in a few minutes the sails were lashed to the yards.  The wind now began to blow steadily from the nor'-west; but not so hard as to stop our tryworks for more than an hour.  After that it blew stiff enough to raise a heavy sea, and we were compelled to slack the fires.  This was all the harm it did to us, however, for although the breeze was stiffish, it was nothing like a gale.  As the captain and the first mate walked the quarter-deck together, I heard the former say to the latter, \"I think we had as well take in a reef in the topsails.  All hereabouts the fishing-ground is good, we don't need to carry on.\"  The order was given to reduce sail, and the men lay out on the topsail yards.  I noticed that my friend Fred Borders was the first man to spring up the shrouds and lay out on the main-topsail yard.  It was so dark that I could scarcely see the masts.  While I was gazing up, I thought I observed a dark object drop from the yard; at the same moment there was a loud shriek, followed by a plunge in the sea.  This was succeeded by the sudden cry, \"man overboard!\" and instantly the whole ship was in an uproar.  No one who has not heard that cry can understand the dreadful feelings that are raised in the human breast by it.  My heart at first seemed to leap into my mouth and almost choke me.  Then a terrible fear, which I cannot describe, shot through me, when I thought it might be my comrade Fred Borders.  But these thoughts and feelings passed like lightning--in a far shorter time than it takes to write them down.  The shriek was still ringing in my ears when the captain roared--  \"Down your helm! stand by to lower away the boats.\"  At the same moment he seized a light hen-coop and tossed it overboard, and the mate did the same with an oar in the twinkling of an eye. Almost without knowing what I did, or why I did it, I seized a great mass of oakum and rubbish that lay on the deck saturated with oil, I thrust it into the embers of the fire in the try-works, and hurled it blazing into the sea.  [Illustration: \"HURLED IT BLAZING INTO THE SEA\"]  The ship's head was thrown into the wind, and we were brought to as quickly as possible.  A gleam of hope arose within me on observing that the mass I had thrown overboard continued still to burn; but when I saw how quickly it went astern, notwithstanding our vigorous efforts to stop the ship, my heart began to sink, and when, a few moments after, the light suddenly disappeared, despair seized upon me, and I gave my friend up for lost.  At that moment, strange to say, thoughts of my mother came into my mind, I remembered her words, \"Call upon the Lord, my dear boy, when you are in trouble.\"  Although I had given but little heed to prayer, or to my Maker, up to that time, I did pray, then and there, most earnestly that my messmate might be saved.  I cannot say that I had much hope that my prayer would be answered--indeed I think I had none,--still, the mere act of crying in my distress to the Almighty afforded me a little relief, and it was with a good deal of energy that I threw myself into the first boat that was lowered, and pulled at the oar as if my own life depended on it.  A lantern had been fastened to the end of an oar and set up in the boat, and by its faint light I could see that the men looked very grave.  Tom Lokins was steering, and I sat near him, pulling the aft oar.  \"Do you think we've any chance, Tom?\" said I.  A shake of the head was his only reply.  \"It must have been here away,\" said the mate, who stood up in the bow with a coil of rope at his feet, and a boat-hook in his hand.  \"Hold on, lads, did anyone hear a cry?\"  No one answered.  We all ceased pulling, and listened intently; but the noise of the waves and the whistling of the winds were all the sounds we heard.  \"What's that floating on the water?\" said one of the men, suddenly.  \"Where away?\" cried everyone eagerly.  \"Right off the lee-bow--there, don't you see it?\"  At that moment a faint cry came floating over the black water, and died away in the breeze.  The single word \"Hurrah!\" burst from our throats with all the power of our lungs, and we bent to our oars till we wellnigh tore the rollicks out of the boat."]]]
