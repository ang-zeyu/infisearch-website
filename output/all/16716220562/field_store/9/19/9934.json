Having put on his across-country boots, a short pair of loose trousers, and taken in his belt a hole or so, grasping a trusty stick in his hand, he set off by himself to have a look over the country.  The whole party of hounds numbered upwards of forty.  There were some very good runners among them; and, what was of more consequence, several who knew the country thoroughly; so that Ernest knew that he must put forth all his energies.  This, however, was what he took delight in doing.  No people but those who have played at hare and hounds, can fully appreciate the excitement, the interest, and the pleasure of the game; or the proud feeling of the hare, who finds that he is successfully baffling his pursuers when he is distancing them by the rapidity of his pace, or by the artfulness of his dodges; still all the time, whatever twists and turns he may make, knowing that he is bound to leave traces of his scent sufficiently strong to lead on the hounds.  The greater part of the day was consumed in preparations for the hunt. Everybody engaged looked out their easiest shoes, and their thickest worsted socks.  Still a huntsman and a whipper-in were to be chosen: Buttar proposed asking Lemon, and Bouldon seconded the motion.  But then it was suggested, that Ernest had consulted him as to the course he should pursue.  One or two cried out for Blackall.  \"No, no; let us ask Lemon,\" said Buttar again; \"if he knows too much about the course Bracebridge is to take, he will not go; but if he thinks it is right, he will.  We can always trust Lemon's honour, you know.\"  No one dissented from this opinion.  Probably Lemon himself was scarcely aware how popular he really was; and certainly he would have been fully satisfied with the grounds on which his popularity was founded.  At last, Lemon was met coming into the playground.  Several voices assailed him with \"Will you be huntsman?\"  \"Will you be huntsman, Lemon?\"  \"I must take time to consider; it is a serious undertaking,\" he answered, laughing.  \"I will see what Tommy and Buttar have to say.\"  They expressed their own opinions, and mentioned all that had been said. \"Very well, I can take the part very conscientiously,\" he added; \"I merely advised Bracebridge in a general way, what course to take; and when he knows that I am to be huntsman, he will deviate sufficiently to prevent me from being able to follow him, unless I get hold of the scent.\"  In the evening, when Ernest came back, he expressed his perfect readiness to have Lemon as huntsman.  Bouldon was chosen as whipper-in.  \"And I'll try to be one of the fleetest hounds,\" said Dawson, \"since I'm neither hare, nor huntsman, nor whipper-in.\"  Lemon possessed many qualifications for his office; and, among others, a capital horn, on which he could play very well.  We always got up our games of hare and hounds in first-rate style.  The huntsman, besides his horn, was furnished with a white flag, fastened to a staff shod with iron; while the whipper-in had a red flag.  The hare had as large a bag as he could carry of white paper, torn into very small pieces. Frequently, too, the hounds dressed in blue or red caps and jackets, which gave the field a very animated appearance; far better in one respect than a real hunt with harriers, because we were certain that the hare was enjoying the fun as much as the hunters, and whether he was caught or escaped, would sit down afterwards to a capital dinner or tea with them, and \"fight his battles o'er again.\"  The morning for the hunt arrived.  It broke, bright and beautiful! with just enough frost in the air to give it freshness and briskness.  The boys were up soon after daybreak, and had breakfast at once, that they might be ready to start at an early hour, and have the whole day before them.  They assembled, just outside the school-grounds, in a small wood, which would conceal the hare from them, when he broke cover, and enable him to get a good start.  The hunt was to be longer than any that had ever been run, and as there was every probability that all the scent would be expended, it was arranged that Buttar should accompany Ernest to carry an additional bag of paper.  The huntsman sounded his horn cheerily, and all the hounds came pouring into the woodland glade, accompanied by the Doctor, who seemed as eager as any one to see the sport.  \"Now, Buttar, are you all ready?\" said Ernest, as they buckled up their waist-belts, and grasped their leaping-poles.  \"Too--too--too,\" went the huntsman's horn.  \"Off hare, off hare,\" cried the Doctor.  \"Ten minutes law will give you a fine start; you'll make play with it--away, away!\"  He clapped his hands.  Off flew Ernest and Buttar, fleet as greyhounds, and very unlike the timid hares they pretended to represent.  The Doctor held his watch in his hand.  The hounds meantime were getting ready to start; one pressing before the other, taking a last look at shoe-strings, tightening in their belts, rubbing their hands, in their eagerness to rush out of the wood and commence the pursuit.  They kept looking up at the Doctor's countenance, to endeavour to ascertain by the expression it wore whether time was nearly up.  Those who had watches were continually pulling them out for the same object.  At last the Doctor was seen to put his into his pocket.  Lemon gave a cheerful sound with his horn.  \"Away, lads, away!\" cried the Doctor, full of animation.  The instant the order was issued, the hounds made a magnificent burst out of the wood, in full cry, led on by the huntsman, waving his flag, and followed by Tom Bouldon, as whipper-in; an office he performed most effectually. The Doctor stalked after them, enjoying the sport as much as anybody; and, I have no doubt, longing to enter more fully into it, and to run along with them.  Away went the pack, cheering each other on, across a field in which they had found the scent.  At the bottom of it ran a rapid brook, as they all well knew.  There were stepping-stones across it.  It required a firm foot and a steady eye not to fall in.  It was a clever dodge of the hare to gain time, for only one could cross at a time.  There was scent on each stone, to show he had crossed.  Two or three slipped in, but were speedily picked out again by their companions; and forming rapidly, continued the chase on the other side, up a long green lane, with high hedges on either side.  They had to keep their eyes about them to ascertain whether he had gone through the hedge, or kept up the lane. On, on they went! at last a pathway, over a stile, appeared on the right, leading through a thick copse.  They dashed into it, but soon found that the pathway had not been kept; and through briar and underwood they had to force a passage; now losing the scent, now catching it again; a wide, dry, sunny field lay before them; along it, and two or three others of a similar character they had to go; and then across another brook, over which, one after the other, they boldly leapt.  Once more they were in a green lane, with deep cart ruts in it. Before them was a mud cottage, with thatched roof, and a small, fully cultivated garden, enclosed by rough palings, in front of it.  An old couple looked out, surprised at the noise.  \"Oh, they be the young gentlemen from Grafton Hall.  What can they be after?\" they observed to one another.  \"I say, good dame, have you seen a couple of hares running along this way?\" exclaimed Tom Bouldon, striking his staff into the ground, for the hounds had lost the scent.  \"No; but we seed two young gentlemen a scampering along here, and up that there lane.  Bees they demented?  We didn't like to stop them, though somehow we thought as how we ought.\"  \"Lucky you didn't; they'd have kicked up a great row, let me tell you,\" answered Tommy, laughing heartily.  He had not time to say more.  The shout of \"Tally ho!\" and the merry sound of the huntsman's horn, put all the pack in motion.  The lane led up hill, and then widened out on some wild open rounded downs, with here and there a white chalk-pit, showing the character of the soil.  Up it they tore--for the scent was strong, and they were eager to make up for the time they had lost.  Every one was well warmed up now, and would have leaped across a chasm or down a precipice, or performed any other desperate achievement which they would not have attempted to do in their cooler moments.  They breasted the steep downs in magnificent style.  The scent led up some of the most difficult parts.  For half a mile or more it led along the very summit of the ridge, but a fresh sweet breeze came playing around them, invigorating their muscles, and making them insensible to fatigue.  The scent led over a high mound, along the edge of a chalk cliff.  As they reached the summit, two figures were seen on the top of a similar height.  All were of opinion that they were Ernest and Buttar.  They looked scarcely half a mile off.  The figures took off their caps, and waved them: this act dispelled all doubts on the subject.  Some began to fear that they should catch the hares too easily, but Lemon assured them that there was no fear of that, and so they soon found.  Down the steep they dashed, till he shouted to them to stop, and to turn off to the left.  A long line of chalk cliffs intervened between them and the opposite height, and the scent led along their edge.  Ernest and Buttar had, in the meantime, disappeared; after a run of a quarter of a mile, once more the scent was lost.  \"Lost, lost!\" shouted Lemon; and the hounds as they came up, went off in every direction to try and find it.  In vain, for a long time, they hunted about, till a white spot was seen at the edge of the cliff, a little farther on.  The cliff was here more practicable.  They looked over; several pieces of paper appeared scattered on little green patches down the precipice.  Fearlessly they began to descend, though to some people it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21452"],["title","Ernest Bracebridge: School Days (#8)"],["body","have been nervous work.  The difficulty they found showed that Ernest and his companion had in no way lost ground, but had probably gained on them.  Now they all reached a ledge, beyond which the descent seemed utterly impracticable.  Still Ernest and Buttar evidently had got down.  \"Where the hares have gone, we must follow,\" cried Lemon, to encourage his party.  \"Hunt about for a path--where there's a will there's a way! Hurra, now!\"  The hounds kept examining the ledge in every direction, and at a distance they must have looked like a swarm of ants, so busy did they appear.  Still without success; and some of the more fainthearted declared that they should have to climb up the cliff again, and find some other way down, or give up the chase.  \"No, no, nonsense,\" said the huntsman.  \"There is a way down, and the way must be found.\"  I must now go back to describe the progress of the hare and his friend.  I have read of \"the hare and many friends,\" but they were very unlike young Buttar; no one could desire a stouter or a stauncher friend. Before starting they had well laid their plans, and determined to give the hounds a good run.  Ernest had provided himself with a good pocket compass, so that he could steer as direct a course as the ground would allow to the point he had selected to round before turning back towards home.  \"Let us go along over the smooth ground at a good pace--we shall save time to spare when we come to the difficult places,\" observed Ernest to Buttar, as they were waiting for the Doctor's signal to start.  It was given--and away they went; steady at first, but gradually increasing their speed as they found that they could easily draw breath.  They met with no impediments in the way.  They easily leaped the brooks they encountered.  The old couple in Ashby-lane stared at them, and wondered where they could be going, leaving little bits of paper behind them. Then they came to Ashby-downs: it was hot work toiling up the steep side, with the hot sun striking down on them; but when they got to the summit, a fresh breeze and a clear blue air revived their strength, and they went along merrily, every now and then looking back to try and catch sight of the hounds, judiciously dropping their scent in places where it could be seen, and not blown away by the breeze.  They had several points to attend to.  They had been especially charged by the Doctor to avoid trespassing on any private ground; they had to select an interesting course, and one not too difficult, at the same time with every possible variety of country.  On they went, making good play over the short smooth turf of the downs. At last they came to the cliff.  Buttar was for descending again, and crossing the ravine where it opened into the plain country.  \"No, no,\" said Ernest, \"we shall increase our distance if we can manage to get down the highest part of the cliff.  Let us try what we can do before we give it up.\"  Down the cliff they began to descend.  There were plenty of craggy, rugged spots, which facilitated their descent, but in most places there was only room for one person to descend at a time, so, as in the instance of the stepping-stones, their pursuers had to form in Indian file.  They easily reached the ledge.  Below it the way was, indeed, difficult.  At the very end, however, Ernest observed several points of rock jutting out.  By climbing up to them he saw that he could drop down on a broader ledge, well covered with soft turf, and could then descend under the very ledge on which they were standing.  Buttar agreed to make the attempt, feeling certain that Lemon would find that or some other means of overcoming the difficulty.  Ernest clutched the rock, and got along bravely, followed by Buttar. \"Take care that you do not sprain your ankle as you drop,\" cried the latter, as Ernest prepared to let go so as to descend to the ledge.  He reached it in safety.  He caught his companion in his arms so as to break his fall, and sprinkling some paper under the long ledge, they pursued their way.  Once Buttar had to let down Ernest with their handkerchiefs tied together, while Ernest again caught him.  Safely they reached the bottom, and away they went across valleys, over streams, and up hills, never once dreaming of fatigue.  I need not follow them in the whole of their course.  They were much delighted, on reaching a high mound, to see the hounds in hot pursuit of them, and still more when all the pack were assembled on the ledge trying to find a way down.  \"I hope none of them will come to grief,\" said Buttar.  \"Do you know, I think that it would have been safer to have taken some other course: that is a difficult place.\"  \"The very reason I was glad to find it,\" replied Ernest; \"one of these days some of them may have a whole tribe of Red Indians or Caffres after them, and then they may be thankful that they learned how to get down a place of the sort.  See!  I think they are finding out the way.  Let us push on.\"  They rose up into view, and waving their caps, on they went. Next they found a descent, down which they trotted quickly, and then another cliff appeared before them; at the top some fine views were to be obtained.  They did not hesitate; up they climbed Fairway Tower was in sight; a wide valley full of streams and rather difficult country was, however, between them and it.  They pushed on along the downs; then they descended another steep hill, and on reaching the plain a rapid wide stream was before them.  Ernest had expected to come down near a bridge, which he proposed crossing.  He and Buttar looked at the broad stream with a puzzled expression.  They were not quite certain whether the bridge was to the right or left.  They decided on taking the left, going down the stream.  At last they met a countryman.  They inquired of him about the bridge.  \"Oh; 'tis the other way, lads,\" he answered.  \"But, I say, young measters, bees you runnin' away from school in such a hurry?\"  \"No, no,\" answered Ernest, laughing.  \"We are running for the pleasure of making the school run after us.  If we could get across the stream it may puzzle them to follow us.  Can you show us any place where we may cross?\"  \"Yes; that I can,\" was the answer.  \"There bees a place with a sort of an island loike in the middle.  There's a plank athwart one place, and a tree hangs over t'other.  If ye be as active as ye looks, ye'll make no odds a getting over.\"  \"Oh, thank you, thank you, my man, we shall be much obliged to you, and as your time is your money? here is what is your due,\" answered Ernest, handing the countryman a small coin.  \"But lead on; we have no time to lose.\"  \"Noa, ma young ones, I'll no take your money.  It's too much by half for just ten minutes' work.  Come along though, if ye bees in a hurry,\" said the good-natured fellow, putting back the coin, and leading the way down the stream.  \"If so be when we gets wages, we never has them, ye know, till the work is done.\"  He trudged on with his arms swinging before him, getting quickly over the ground, though his legs did not appear to move half so fast as those of the young gentlemen.  He did not utter a word all the time, but seemed to concentrate all his energies in getting over the ground as rapidly as he could.  Ernest and Buttar ran on by his side, dropping the paper here and there sufficiently thick to indicate their course.  At last they reached the spot mentioned by the countryman.  He showed them a narrow plank, partly hid by bushes, by which they crossed to a green island surrounded by willows, which hung over into the stream.  \"A grand place for fishing, this,\" observed Buttar, as he looked into the dark, clear water which went whirling by in eddies, and here and there formed deep calm pools and little bays, in which they could not help feeling sure many a trout lay hid.  \"No time to think about it, though,\" answered Ernest.  \"We will come here, by all means, another day and try what we can do.  Let us now see how we are to get across the river.  Lay the scent thickly, that the hounds may not be in fault, or they may lose it altogether and give the chase up in despair.\"  While they were speaking they were following the countryman through the reeds and grass, which was already high in that moist situation.  He stopped at the base of a fine large willow, which they saw bent very much over the water, though the bushes prevented them from seeing how far.  There were some notches in its trunk, and up these he climbed. They followed him closely, and saw him descend on the opposite bank by means of a knotted rope which hung from the end of one of the limbs. They were delighted with the plan.  \"Capital!\" exclaimed Buttar.  \"What fun it will be to have all the hounds come scrambling over the old trunk, and letting themselves down by the rope, one after the other.\"  The countryman looked at the speaker with a puzzled gaze.  \"The owndes!\" he exclaimed.  \"They'll ne'er trouble the rope, I'm thinking.\"  He evidently could not settle it in his mind that his young companions were not mad.  Buttar and Ernest laughed heartily at his look of astonishment.  \"We speak of our schoolfellows, who pretend to be hounds, and we are hares leading them on,\" exclaimed Buttar.  The countryman clapped his hands and rubbed them together to express his delight at the notion, while he joined in their laughter at his mistake.  \"Well, that there be a jolly good game, I do think,\" he exclaimed.  \"I loikes it, that I do--No, no--I'll not take your money, young measters. I gets a good day's pay for a good day's work, and that's all I asks, and all I wishes for.\"  Ernest, on hearing this sentiment, put out his hand and warmly shook that of the countryman.  \"I like to hear you say that, friend.  It is what all of us should alone desire, and I am sure the world would be much happier if everybody in it were like you; but good-bye, good-bye; I've no time to talk now.  I should like to fall in with you and "]]]
