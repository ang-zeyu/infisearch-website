Prater, Bertall, etc.,   From Original Sketches.     London:   Ward, Lock, and Co., Salisbury Square.   1879.     This little book scarcely needs a preface, as it speaks sufficiently for itself. It is for the most part the result of studies on the spot of everything of interest connected with the various sparkling wines which it professes to describe. Neither pains nor expense have been spared to render it both accurate and complete, and the large number of authentic engravings with which it is illustrated will conduce, it is hoped, to its value.

Illustrated with 80 Engravings from Original Sketches.     CONTENTS.                                                                     PAGE. I.--THE ORIGIN OF CHAMPAGNE.
