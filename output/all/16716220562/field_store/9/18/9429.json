At three thousand feet I started the air-rocket engines. They came on with a gentle purring. The fluorescence from them streamed along our hull and down past the stern, like twin rocket tails.  With gathering speed we slid smoothly upward through the highest traffic lanes, out of the atmosphere, through the stratosphere and into space.  Leaving the stratosphere, I cut off the air-rocket engines, slid the stern gravity-plates for the Earth's repulsion and the bow plates for the attraction of the Moon and Sun. The firmament swung, in a slow arc, and steadied with the Earth behind us and the Sun and Moon in advance of our bow. We were on our course, plunging through space with accelerating velocity toward the unknown enemy ship hovering two hundred thousand miles ahead of us. My orders were to find the ship and maneuver us close to it; and Grantline's orders were to assail it.  I gazed down at the convex North Atlantic with the reddening coastline of North America spread like a map.  What was the nature of this strange enemy whom we sought? That opalescent beam from Greater New York mounted with its radiance into the dome-like starfield; the one from Venus and the other from Mars seemed crossing overhead amid the stars.  Three swords crossing the sky! What did they mean?         *       *       *       *       *  \"Will you swing east or west of the Moon?\"  \"We haven't decided.\"  Drac Davidson and I were alone in the _Cometara's_ control turret.  We were some ten hours out from Earth. Over such short astronomical distances it was impossible to attain any great velocity. When once we were clear of the Earth's atmospheric envelope, the rocket-stream engines were useless. The _Cometara_ was equipped also with tail-streamers of electronic nature. They exerted a slight pressure, useful for sudden curving and turning; but they had only negligible influence upon the main velocity of the vehicle.  I used the repulsion of the Earth upon our negatively charged stern gravity-plates; and with those of the bow electronified to the positive reaction, we were drawn forward by the Sun and the Moon.  For three or four hours I held to this combination with steady acceleration; but then I had to retard. In close quarters such as this, the retarding velocity must be calculated with a nicety many hours in advance.  We hung now, very nearly poised, within some forty thousand miles of the surface of the Moon. Bleak and cold, sharply black and white, it hung in a gigantic crescent in advance of our bow. The Sun, whose attraction I had ceased using some hours back, was visible sharply to one side now. Its great gas streams of giant flame licked up into the blackness of the firmament. The sunlight caught the lunar mountains with a white glare, and left the valleys black with shadow; moonlight and the mingled sunlight painted our bow. Behind our stem the great disk of Earth hung somber and glowing.  And everywhere else was the great black enclosing firmament. The stars blazed with a new white glory never seen through the haze of an atmosphere. Like a little world in the vastness of this awesome void, we hung poised.  Grantline came into the turret. \"I've got everything ready, Gregg. By the gods, once you can lay telescope upon that accursed enemy ship, I'm ready to open fire on it.\"  \"Good,\" I said.  But the thought of hurling our bolts at this enemy ship had struck terror into my heart for hours past. I was convinced that the three who in all the world were dearest to me--Anita, Venza, and Snap--were upon that enemy vessel.  Grantline asked, \"Are you going closer to the Moon?\"  \"No.\"  \"The ship couldn't be between us and the Moon. Waters and I have been in the helio room for the past hour, searching with the 'scope there. Nothing doing, Gregg. Not a sign.\"  \"I know. Our instruments here show that.\"  \"There might be a way of sighting them,\" Drac put in.  \"I'll try the Zed-ray,\" I suggested. \"Drac and I have it corrected. But I doubt if it would penetrate the sort of invisibility this enemy would use.\"  Grantline nodded. \"Or the Benson curve-light. You think the ship went behind the Moon? Or landed on the Moon?\"  \"It could have done either. Has Waters still got contact with the Earth? Have they seen it?\"  \"No.\"  I made a sudden decision. It would take us two hours at least to make a careful scanning with the Zed-ray; and to take an elaborate series of spectro-heliographs of the Moon's surface, which might show the enemy vessel if it had landed there, was a laborious process.  After brief thought, I discarded the idea. \"We'll go to the helio room,\" I told Grantline. \"I'm going to try the Benson curve-light.\"  Grantline and I left the turret, heading along the catwalk under the glassite dome toward the helio cubby where the rotund, middle-aged Waters was in charge. It made my heart sink to think of the helio room. Snap should have been there.  We crossed the transverse catwalk. The superstructure roof was under us. Farther down, the narrow decks showed with Grantline's men grouped at the firing ports, where his weapons were mounted and ready. As I saw those grouped men loitering on the deck, waiting for me to give them a sighting, I prayed I could do so; and yet there was the shuddering fear that the first blast would bring death to Anita.  Waters met us at the door of his cubby. His face was red; he mopped the perspiration from his bald head. \"I'm so glad you came! Will you want the Benson-light? I say, I've lost connection with the Earth. I had the Washington transmitter. Five minutes ago they sent me a flash of the Mars and Venus news. They both sent ships, out.\"  He gasped for breath, then added in a rush: \"Both the Mars and Venus ships were destroyed and the enemy escaped!\"  Grantline and I gasped with horror.  \"Destroyed?\" I said. \"How?\"  Waters did not know. The news came; then, immediately after, the Washington transmitter changed its wavelength and he lost connection.  \"But why, in heaven's name, man, didn't you ring and tell us?\" Grantline demanded. \"Destroyed--only that! Just destroyed.\"  \"I was afraid to leave my instruments,\" Waters said. \"How could I tell? I might be able to renew connections with Washington any minute. Come on in. Do you want to try the Benson curve-light, Mr. Haljan?\"  \"Yes,\" I said. \"I do.\" We entered the dim helio cubby. \"See here, Waters, what about the projectile that ascended from Earth last night? Did the Washington observatory report what happened to it?\"  \"No, not a word. They lost it, evidently.\"  Our 'scopes on the _Cometara_ had not been able to locate the projectile. The large instruments of Earth had lost it. Was that because, with tremendous velocity, it had sped directly for the new planet out beyond Mars?  Or, with some form of invisibility, might it be close to us now, just as the lurking ship might be somewhere around here?  From the little circular helio cubby, perched here under the dome like an eagle's nest, I could see down all the length of the ship, and out the side ports of the dome to the blazing firmament. The Sun, Moon and Earth and all the starfield were silently turning as Drac swung us upon our new course.  Waters bent over the projector of the Benson curve-light, making connections. The cubby was silent and dim, with only a tiny spotlight where Waters was working, and a glow upon his table where his recent messages from Earth were filed. Grantline and I glanced at them.  Panic in Greater New York, Grebhar, and Ferrok-Shahn. The three strange beams which the enemy had planted on Earth, Venus and Mars still remained unchanged. I could see them now plainly from the helio cubby windows, great shafts of radiance sweeping the firmament.  Waters straightened from his task. \"That will do it, Mr. Haljan.\" He met me in the center of the cubby. \"When you locate the enemy, do you think they'll destroy us as they did those other ships?\"  Grantline laughed grimly. \"Maybe so, Waters. But let's hope not.\"  Fat little Waters was anything but a coward, but being closed up here all these hours with a stream of dire messages from Earth had shaken him.  \"What I mean, Mr. Grantline, is that prudence is sometimes better than reckless valor. The _Cometara_ is no warship. If Earth had sent an international patrol vessel....\"  Grantline did not answer. He joined me at the Benson projector. \"Can we operate it from here, Gregg, or will you mount it in the bow?\"  \"From here. Drac's swinging. When he's on the course I gave him, I can throw the Benson-ray through the bow dome-port. Waters, you're all done in. Go below and sleep awhile.\"  But he stood his ground. \"No, sir; I don't want to sleep.\"  \"We've had ours,\" said Grantline. \"We'll call you if anything shows up.\"  We sent Waters away. \"Ready, Gregg?\"  \"Yes. I've got the range.\"  The coils hummed and heated with the current, and in a moment the Benson curve-beam leaped from the projector.  The Benson curve-light was similar to an ordinary white searchlight beam, except that its path, instead of being straight could be bent at will into various curves--hyperbola, parabola, and for its extreme curve, the segment of an ellipse--gradually straightening as it left its source. It was effective for police work, with hand torches for seeing around opaque obstructions. It had also another advantage, especially when used at long range: the enemy, when gazing back at its source, would under normal circumstances conceive it to be a straight beam and thus be misled as to the location of its source. Or even realizing it to be curved, one had no means of judging the angle of the curve.  A narrow white stream of light, it flung through our window-oval, forward under the dome and through the bow dome bullseye, into space. I saw the men on the deck spring into sudden alertness with the realization we were using it. The bow lookout on the forward observation bridge crouched at his 'scope-finder to help "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20860"],["title","The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast (#0)"],["body","ONE SHILLING.

MDCCCLXXXIII     INTRODUCTION.   Early in the present century John Harris--one of the successors to the business of \"Honest John Newbery,\" now carried on by Messrs Griffith & Farran at the old corner of St. Paul's Churchyard--began the publication of a series of little books, which for many years were probably among the most famous of the productions of the House. Now, however, according to the fate which usually overtakes books for children, nearly all of them are forgotten or unknown.  The first book in this series which was known as _Harris's Cabinet_ was \"The Butterfly's Ball,\" and was published in January 1807. This was followed in the same year by \"The Peacock at Home\" (a sequel to \"The Butterfly's Ball\"), \"The Elephant's Ball,\" and \"The Lion's Masquerade;\" and then (prompted no doubt by the success of these, for we learn on the publisher's authority that of the two first 40,000 copies were sold within twelve months) Mr Harris brought out a torrent of little books of a like kind, of which the titles were: \"The Lioness's Ball,\" \"The Lobster's Voyage to the Brazils,\" \"The Cat's Concert,\" \"The Fishes' Grand Gala,\" \"Madame Grimalkin's Party,\" \"The Jackdaw's Home,\" \"The Lion's Parliament,\" \"The Water King's Levée;\" and in 1809, by which time, naturally enough, the idea seems to have become quite threshed out and exhausted, the last of the Series was published; this was entitled, \"The Three Wishes, or Think before you Speak.\"  Of this long list of books a few of the titles are still familiar, and one of them, \"The Butterfly's Ball,\" may certainly claim to have become a Nursery Classic. It is still in regular demand; the edition now in sale being illustrated by Harrison Weir; it has been published in various forms, and has figured in most of the collections of prose and verse for the young that have been issued during this century. Probably to the minds of hundreds of people past middle age few lines are more familiar than the opening couplet--    \"Come take up your hats, and away let us haste    To the Butterfly's Ball and Grasshopper's Feast\"--   and many no doubt by a little effort of memory could repeat the whole poem.  Hardly less famous were the three books which next followed in order of issue--\"The Peacock at Home,\" \"The Elephant's Ball,\" and \"The Lion's Masquerade.\" Their original size was 5 by 4 inches, and they were issued in a simple printed paper wrapper. It is of these first four books that the reprint is here given, and in order to present both pictures and text with greater effect this reprint has been made upon considerably larger paper; the text and illustrations are fac-simile reproductions of originals from the celebrated Flaxman collection recently dispersed at a sale by Messrs Christie, Manson, & Woods, when Mr Tuer, to whom I am indebted for their loan, became their fortunate possessor. \"The Butterfly's Ball\" is not a reproduction of the first edition, which, as will be shown later on, would be considered by those who are familiar with the poem as incomplete. Moreover, the illustrations in the edition here presented are obviously by the same hand as that which embellished the other three books, and it was felt that for these reasons it would possess a greater interest.  \"The Butterfly's Ball\" first appeared in the November number of the _Gentleman's Magazine_, where it is said to have been written by William Roscoe--M.P. for Liverpool, the author of \"The Life of Leo X.,\" and well known in the literary circles of his day--for the use of his children, and set to music by order of their Majesties for the Princess Mary. When the verses were subsequently published in book form, the text and pictures were engraved together on copperplates. An edition, with pictures on separate pages, appeared early in the next year, which is the one here reproduced.  In this edition there are many variations from the previous one. The allusions to \"little Robert\"--evidently William Roscoe's son--do not occur in the former, and many slight improvements, tending to make the verses more rhythmical and flowing, are introduced. The whole passage, \"Then close on his haunches\" (p. 7) to \"Chirp his own praises the rest of the night,\" &c. (p. 10), is an interpolation in this later edition. It is, I believe, certain that the verses were written by Roscoe for his children on the occasion of the birthday of his son Robert, who was nearly the youngest of his seven sons. No doubt when they were copied out for setting to music the allusions to his own family were omitted by the author. A correspondent of _Notes and Queries_--who is, I believe, a niece of the late Sir George Smart--says, in reference to the question of the setting of the verses to music, that--       \"The MS., in Roscoe's own handwriting, as sent to Sir G. Smart     for setting to music, is in a valuable collection of autographs     bequeathed by the musician to his daughter. The glee was written     for the three princesses--Elizabeth, Augusta, and Mary--daughters     of George III, and pupils of Sir George, and was performed by them     during one of their usual visits to Weymouth.\"   \"The Peacock at Home\" and \"The Lion's Masquerade\" were, as the title-page puts it, written \"by a Lady,\" and we should most likely have remained in ignorance as to who the lady was if there had not been published in 1816 another little book of a somewhat similar character, entitled \"The Peacock and Parrot on their Tour to discover the Author of 'The Peacock at Home,'\" which, the Preface tells us, was written immediately after the appearance of \"The Peacock at Home,\" but from various circumstances was laid aside. \"In the opinion of the publishers,\" the Preface goes on to say, \"it is so nearly allied in point of merit to that celebrated trifle that it is introduced at this late period.\"  The book relates in verse how the peacock and parrot--          \"... far as England extends   Then together did travel to visit their friends,   Endeavour to find out the name of our poet,   And ere we return ten to one that we know it.\"   After long travelling--    \"A path strewed with flowers they gaily pursued,    And in fancy their long-sought Incognita viewed.    Till all their cares over in Dorset they found her,    And plucking a wreath of green bay-leaves they crowned her.\"   In a footnote is added, \"Mrs Dorset was the authoress of 'The Peacock at Home.'\"  Mrs Dorset, according to a note by Mr Dyce which appears on the fly-leaf of a copy of \"The Peacock at Home,\" in the Dyce and Forster Collection at South Kensington, was sister to Charlotte Smith. Their maiden name was Turner.  The British Museum Catalogue says Mrs Dorset also wrote \"The Three Wishes, or Think before you Speak,\" which is the last on the list of"]]]
