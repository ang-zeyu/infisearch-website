There are in the world several very famous glass vases--this is one; the Auldjo Vase, also from Pompeii and now in the British Museum, is another; and the Portland Vase, which is there too, makes a third. The design on the Portland Vase is considered even finer than this. We shall see it and I will tell you its history when we get to London.\"  What weren't they to see!  Jean's head was a jumble of fairy anticipations--of Crown Jewels, palaces, gondolas, famous pictures, and scenes of undreamed of beauty. The Tower of London merged itself with visions of Napoleon's Tomb, while in and out of her mind flitted fragmentary pictures of Notre Dame and the Vatican. Everything seemed so old!  \"At first I stood with my mouth open when I was told things were built, or dug up, or made hundreds of years ago,\" laughed Jean. \"But now I find I am growing fussy, and unless a thing is thousands of years old it scarcely seems worth looking at. How horribly new they must think us in America! Even Bunker Hill and the State House, Hannah, are very modern,\" she added teasingly.  \"Now, Jean, if this trip to Europe is going to make you turn up your nose at your native land the best thing you can do is to face round and go straight back home,\" was Hannah's severe reply.  \"There, there, you dear old thing! Don't worry. I love my America, but you should have learned by this time that I never can resist seeing you bristle. But even you, bigoted as you are, must admit that a great deal seems to have happened in the world before we on the other side of the sea were alive at all.\"  \"Much of it,\" observed Hannah with dignity, \"was nothing to be proud of, and it's as well they kept it on this side of the ocean.\"  From Naples Uncle Bob whirled his bewildered charges to Rome and then to Florence, and while he was busy transacting business Hannah and Jean were put in charge of a courier and taken to see so many pictures and churches that Hannah begged never to be shown another masterpiece or another spire so long as she lived.  \"Bless your heart, Mr. Bob, if you were to lean the Sistine Madonna right up against the table in my room I wouldn't turn my head to look at it. And as for churches--I wouldn't accept Westminster Abbey as a gift. Tell 'em not to urge it on me, for I wouldn't take it even if I could get it through the customs free of duty. The things I'd like best at this very minute would be an east wind and some baked beans.\"  But when they reached Venice and saw their first gondola even Hannah was forced to admit that it far outshone the Boston swan-boats. The travelers arrived late at night, and on passing through the station came out on a broad platform where, instead of cabs and cars, numberless gondolas floated, illumined by twinkling lights.  \"Oh!\" murmured Jean in a hushed whisper.  It was indeed a beautiful sight. Before them a stretch of water flooded by the full moon wandered off into a multitude of tiny canals shut in on either side by murky dwellings of stone or brick. In and out of these dim little avenues plied boatmen who shouted a warning in shrill Italian as they rounded the turns.  Uncle Bob lost no time in summoning a gondolier, and soon the party were being swept along by the sturdy strokes of a swarthy Venetian who, Hannah declared in an undertone, looked like nothing so much as a full-fledged brigand. She could not be persuaded to take her hand off her luggage, but sat clutching it with all her strength until she arrived at the hotel. Jean, on the other hand, was too excited by the novelty of the scene to know or care what the boatman looked like. Her one fear seemed to be that if she went to bed and allowed herself to fall asleep the wonderful water streets might vanish forever. It took all Uncle Bob's pleading to make her close her eyes. At last, however, she did and when she opened them in the morning her very first thought was to fly to the window and see if the canals were still there.  No, it was not a dream!  There were the moving gondolas, the narrow water streets, and the glorious dome of Del Salute directly opposite across the sparkling expanse of the Grand Canal.  Jean suppressed a cry of delight, and scurried into her clothes.  \"Now, Uncle Bob,\" she announced at breakfast, \"I want to go straight out in a gondola the minute I have finished my chocolate and rolls. I think I am pretty good to stop for them at all. I want to go and stay until noon. May I?\"  \"Well, let me think a second, little girl,\" replied Uncle Bob. \"I am afraid I must run over to the bankers' directly after breakfast, so I won't be able to start right away; I can, however, take you later.\" Then as he saw Jean's face fall he added, \"You and Hannah may go early if you like and come back for me at eleven. How will that do?\"  \"It will do beautifully only I wish you could be with us. How shall we know how to get a boatman, or tell him where to take us? I am sure I couldn't, and Hannah's Italian is not very good, although,\" with a mischievous smile, \"I suppose she could use her dictionary.\"  \"I will arrange everything with a gondolier before I leave for the bankers',\" Uncle Bob answered. \"Now I must be running along. Suppose the gondola is here at half-past nine.\"  \"The earlier the better,\" cried Jean.  Promptly at the hour set the gondola glided up to the steps of the Grand Canal Hotel where Jean and Hannah were waiting. It was an unusually beautiful gondola, with scarlet curtains and a gilded prow carved in the shape of a woman's head.  Jean sprang forward, all eagerness, her eyes on the magic apparition. Then suddenly her foot slipped on the slime left by the tide on the marble step, and she would have fallen into the water had not a young boy, with rare presence of mind, leaped forward and caught her.  Another moment and Hannah, white with fright, had the girl in her arms.  \"Oh, my dear child!\" she wailed. \"My precious lamb! Thank goodness, you are safe. Think if you'd been drowned before you had had a chance to see Venice at all! But you are quite safe now, honey. Don't be frightened. Young man,\" and she turned to the boy, \"that was a good deed of yours. What is your name? But there--how silly to be asking him when he can't understand a word I'm saying. I forgot no one could understand anything in this queer, upside-down town where the streets are water when they ought to be land.\"  To her utter astonishment, however, the boy answered in English, which, although slightly broken, was perfectly intelligible.  \"My name is Giusippe Cicone.\"  \"Say it again,\" demanded Hannah. \"Say it more slowly.\"  \"Giusippe Cicone.\"  \"Giusippe,\" echoed Hannah, \"Giusippe Cicone. There! Giusippe Cicone. I got it better that time. Giusippe Cicone. Now I have it! Well, Master Giusippe Cicone, it was very good of you to save this little lady from a ducking in your canal which, if I may be permitted to say so, is not as clean as it might be. We are very much obliged to you, and here is some money to pay you for being so quick.\"  The boy shook his head.  \"I could not take money for saving the señorita from the water,\" protested he proudly. \"I was glad to do it. I could not take pay.\"  \"Well, I thank you very much,\" Jean ventured shyly.  He helped Hannah and the girl into the waiting gondola and then stood on the steps shading his eyes with his brown hand as the gondolier made his way to the oar.  \"Perhaps you can tell us where we can find you if we should want to see you again,\" called Hannah as the distance between them widened.  \"Certainly. I am at Murano.\" He pointed across the lagoon to a distant island.  \"Murano?\"  \"Yes, I work there. Every one knows me at the glass works.\"  [Illustration: \"EVERY ONE KNOWS ME AT THE GLASS WORKS\"]  He waved his hand and was soon lost to sight.  \"I do wonder who he is,\" speculated Jean, who had now quite recovered from her fright and could smile at the memory of the episode. \"And how strange that he understood English!\"  \"I don't call it strange,\" Hannah responded. \"English is the only sensible language, and probably this boy realizes it. I think it speaks well for his discrimination.\"  \"Anyway, he was a gentleman not to take the money; and yet he looked poor,\" reflected the girl.  \"One may be a gentleman despite poverty, thank goodness,\" Hannah said. \"Your uncle will probably insist upon hunting him up and thanking him. I can't see, Jean, how you came to slip that way. Wasn't the boatman holding on to you?\" and for the tenth time every detail of the disaster had to be gone over.  \"Well, all I can say is that if anything had happened to you I never should have dared show my face to your Uncle Bob. And think of your Uncle Tom at home--he would have things to say! They would both blame me even if it was not my fault,\" sighed Hannah.  \"Of course it wasn't your fault. How could you possibly be to blame if I was so heedless as to rush ahead without looking where I was going? I'm always doing that, Hannah; you know I am. I am always in such a hurry to enjoy the things I like that I never can wait a moment. This is a good lesson for me. I just hope the salt water won't spoil my new tan shoes. Come! Let us talk of something pleasanter. Isn't it too perfectly lovely out here? Look back at the shore and see how St. Mark's and the Campanile stand out. I know those already, because I remember seeing pictures of them in my geography. Oh, I am so glad we are here! I am sure we shall have a wonderful time in Venice even if I did begin by nearly drowning myself in the canal.\"  \"It is all very well to laugh about it now,\" Hannah answered solemnly, \"but it was no laughing matter when it happened--no laughing matter!\"     CHAPTER III  GIUSIPPE TELLS A STORY   When Uncle Bob heard of Jean's adventure he lost no time, you may be sure, in hunting up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20698"],["title","The Story of Glass (#4)"],["body","Cicone. A note was sent to Murano asking that the lad call at the hotel; and as the following day chanced to be a festa day the glass works were closed and Giusippe presented himself directly after breakfast. He was neatly although poorly clothed, and had he had no other claim to Mr. Cabot's good will than his frank face that would have won him a welcome. Perhaps added to Uncle Bob's gratitude there was, too, a measure of the artist's joy in the beautiful; for Giusippe was handsome. Thick brown hair clustered about the well-formed head; his eyes were of soft hazel; and into his round olive cheek was steeped the rich crimson of the southern sun. More than all this, he was a well bred lad--manly, courteous, and proud. When Mr. Cabot began to thank him for his service to Jean the boy made light of what he had done and once more refused to accept any reward.  Uncle Bob's curiosity was aroused.  Never before had he met an Italian who would not take money when it was offered him.  \"Perhaps you would be willing, young man, to tell us more about yourself,\" said he at last. \"You work in the glass factory, you say. Have you been long there?\"  Giusippe smiled, showing two rows of dazzling white teeth.  \"So long, señor, that I cannot remember when I was not there. And before me was my father, and my grandfather; and before that his father; and so on back for years and years. There was always a Cicone at Murano. For you must know, señor, that glass-making has ever been the great art of Venice. When paintings began to take the place of the glass mosaics then came the height of fame for Venetian glass. For you will remember that for many years before artists could paint people made pictures out of bits of glass, and in this way represented to those who had no books scenes from the Bible or from history. Then wonderful painters were born in Italy and they crowded out the mosaic makers, who had previously decorated the churches, palaces, and public buildings. The making of glass mosaics died out and it was then that the Venetian artisans turned their attention and their skill to the making of other glass things--beads, mirrors, drinking cups, and ornaments. In fact,\" went on Giusippe, \"there soon became so many glass houses in Venice that the Great Council feared a terrible fire might sweep the island, and in 1291, with the exception of a few factories for small articles, all the glass houses were banished to the island of Murano a mile distant where, if fire came, no destruction could be done to the city of Venice itself. Those factories which were allowed to remain had to have a space of fifteen paces around them. By the decree of the Council the other glass houses were torn down.\"  \"And it was thus that your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was driven to Murano, was it?\" queried Mr. Cabot.  \"Yes. He was a member of the guild of bead-makers. For you know, señor, that in those days workmen were banded together in guilds, and kept the mysteries of their trade to themselves. The precious secret was handed down from father to son. So it was with my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.\"  Giusippe drew himself up.  \"Oh, it was a grand thing to be a glass-maker in those days, señor!\" continued the boy, his eyes glowing. \"The members of the guilds were so honored in Venice that they were considered equal in birth to the noblest families. They were gentlemen. A titled woman felt only pride in uniting herself with a glass-maker's family.\"  \"Perhaps that is what your great-great-great-great-great-grandmother did,\" Jean said, half aloud.  \"Yes, señorita,\" was Giusippe's simple answer. \"And they say, too, she was beautiful. My ancestor was of the _pater-nostereri_; he was a maker of beads for rosaries. Then there were the _margaritai_, who made small beads; and the _fuppialume_, who made large blown beads. Each man was a skilled artist, you see, and did some one special thing. The _phiolari_ made vases, cups, and glass for windows; the _cristallai_ optical glass; and the _specchiai_ mirrors. No strangers were allowed to visit the glass works, and all apprentices must pass a rigid examination not only as to their skill, but as to their previous personal history. In 1495 the glass houses at Murano extended for a mile along a single street and the great furnaces roared night and day, so you can imagine how much glass was made on the island.\"  \"My!\" gasped Jean breathlessly.  \"Absolute loyalty to the art was demanded of every man engaged in it,\" Giusippe said. \"And you can see, señor, that this was necessary. Any workman carrying the secrets elsewhere was first warned to return to Venice; then, if he refused, his nearest relative was imprisoned; if he still refused to obey he was tracked down and killed. Often glass-makers were found in Padua, Ravenna, and other places stabbed through the heart, and the word _Traitor_ was fastened to the dagger.\"  Jean shuddered.  \"Do not tremble, señorita,\" Giusippe said. \"It was a just punishment. You see the Council of Ten felt that the prosperity of the Venetians depended upon keeping their art away from all the outside world which was so eager to learn it. All knew the penalty for disloyalty. The decree read:      \"'_If any workman conveys his art to a strange country to the     detriment of the Republic he shall be sent an order to return to     Venice. Failing to obey his nearest of kin shall be imprisoned. If     he still persists in remaining abroad and plying his art an     emissary shall be charged to kill him._'  \"In this way the secrets of glass-making were kept in Venice and the Republic soon became famous and prosperous. As the reputation of the Venetian glass-makers spread an immense trade was established. My grandfather has often told me of the great numbers of beads which were sent everywhere throughout the East--sometimes to Africa and even to India. In 1764 twenty-two great furnaces were kept busy supplying the beads that were demanded. Frequently, they say, as many as forty-four thousand barrels were turned out in a single week.\"  \"Why, I should think that everybody in the world would have been covered with beads!\" Jean exclaimed, smiling.  \"Ah, I can tell you something stranger than that, señorita. So popular did Venetian glass of every variety become that a foreign prince created a great sensation by appearing in Paris with curls of finely spun black glass.\"  Jean and Uncle Bob laughed merrily.  \"I think myself he was silly,\" Giusippe declared, echoing their amusement. \"He, however, was not alone in his admiration for the beautiful and ingenious workmanship of the people of my country, for even as far back as 1400 Richard the Second of England gave permission to our Venetian merchants to sell glass aboard their galleys, duty free; and King Henry the Eighth owned as many as four or five hundred Venetian drinking goblets, vases, dishes, and plates, some of which, they say, are still in the British Museum.\"  \"We must see them when we go to London, mustn't we, Uncle Bob?\" cried Jean eagerly.  \"We surely must. All this is very interesting, Giusippe. You do well to remember so much of your country's history,\" said Mr. Cabot.  \"I am proud of it, señor. Besides I have heard it many, many times. My people were never tired of telling over and over the story of the old days; the golden days of Venice, my father called them. The Republic might have retained its fame much longer had not some of our countrymen been persuaded to go to other lands and sell their secrets for gold. It was thus that the art of making mirrors was taken into France and Germany.\"  \"Tell us about it, Giusippe,\" pleaded Jean.  \"Why, as I think I told you, the Venetians began to make mirrors as early as 1300. Of course, señorita, they were crude affairs--not at all like the fine ones of to-day, but to people who had nothing better they were marvels. And indeed they were both clever and beautiful. For you must remember that ages ago there was no such thing as a looking-glass. Men and women could only see their reflections in streams, pools, and fountains. Then the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans began to make mirrors of burnished metal, using bits of brass or bronze often beautifully decorated on the back with classic Grecian figures. Rich women carried such mirrors fastened to their girdles or sometimes instead had them fitted into small, shallow boxes of carved ivory; sometimes too the mirror was set in a case of gold, silver, enamel, or ebony with intricate decoration on the outside. That was the first of mirror-making.\"  \"How curious!\"  \"Later the Venetians experimented and began backing pieces of glass with mercury or tin. The surface was first covered with tinfoil and then rubbed down until smooth; then the whole was coated with quicksilver, which formed an amalgam with the tin. It does no harm to tell you about it now, señorita,\" added Giusippe a little sadly, \"for every one knows. This process was slow and unsatisfactory, but it was the best the workmen then knew. These mirrors they set in elaborate frames of glass, silver, carved wood, mother-of-pearl, coral, tarsi, or into frames of painted wood. Some of them were sent by Venetian nobles as gifts to kings and queens of other countries; often they were purchased by royalties themselves. You can see many in the museums of France, Germany, or England.\"  \"We will hunt them up, Jean,\" Uncle Bob declared.  \"I'd love to see them,\" replied the girl.  \"My father has told me that there were frequent quarrels between the glass-makers and the mirror-framers because, you see, the framers wanted to learn the secret of making the mirrors, and the mirror-makers were jealous of the skill of the framers and feared the frame would be more beautiful than the mirror itself and so overshadow it. Then in 1600 the French stole from our people the secret of mirror-making and began turning out mirrors not only as good, but in some respects better than the Venetian ones.\" "]]]
