George straightened himself out and looked up the hill. \"Well, I am going for that flag whether it blows or not,\" and he started for the hill. Angel, who was in the loft, swung down and made his way out of the door, and before George had gone fifty feet, was at his heels. \"And you are going, too? Good boy!\" and George actually hugged Angel. He understood.  Arriving at the hill he made an examination, and found that the halliards had been broken and the wind carried away the flag, halliards and all. As the wind came from the sea, the flag must be inland somewhere. Search was made in every direction, but to no purpose. Every rock and lodging place was examined, but it had disappeared. Angel was an interested searcher. He really seemed to divine George's mission. At every bush, or rock, or other possible landing place, he would be the first, and peer around, and look up and down, just as he had seen George do.  The quest kept up for over an hour, and, sadly disappointed, he returned with the news of his failure. The Professor took the loss lightly. \"I presume it is intended that we should work out our own rescue. After all, I think that is the proper thing to do. If we depend on others we are sure to meet with disappointment and failure. Cheer up, boys; flag or no flag, let us do our duty.\"  \"I don't mind the loss of the flag so much because it prevents us from having a signal, but I hate to think that we lost so much good time in making and putting it up.\"  The flag alluded to was sixteen feet long, laboriously made out of ramie fiber, which was woven, and then dyed, and it was a hard task to haul the pole, which was over fifty feet long, from the forest ten miles away, to say nothing of the labor required to raise it.  As soon as the thoroughly drenched material at the boathouse could be brought out and dried in the sun, which now came out bright and warm, the work proceeded with renewed vigor. Late that evening the Professor appeared at the rear of the laboratory, and called loudly to the boys.  When they appeared at the laboratory he was laughing immoderately, and Angel stood on one of the tables with a simian grin.  \"What is the matter? Has Angel been experimenting again?\"  Before the Professor could answer, George caught sight of the flag.  \"What! The flag! Where did you get it?\"  \"Ask Angel.\"  The boys laughed, and George actually hugged the animal, in his delight. Did Angel know what he had done? Ask those delvers into the mysterious realms of thought, what prompted him to search for and restore the flag? Is that any more remarkable than the recorded tricks of dogs and many other animals?  You know just how boys can laugh when they are really happy. Angel imitated that laugh, and he had not been taught to do it, either. It came without teaching.  When the Professor had wiped away some of the tears which had come from the excess of laughter at the imitating efforts of the animal, he said:  \"Did it ever occur to you why Angel has always had a solemn look? The facial expression seldom, if ever, changes, and they rarely ever exhibit mirth. You may imagine the condition of those animals, living in the forests, with enemies all about them, and the struggle for existence an everlasting one. They have never known amusing incidents as we understand them. Naturally, the muscles of mobility in the face, which express pleasure, never have been exercised, and those indicating fear and anger unduly developed. Here is Angel, in a new atmosphere, where he sees delight depicted on the countenance, and, gifted as he is, with wonderful powers of imitation, has learned to actually laugh, and to enjoy the scene.\"  \"Well, Professor, as we have one of the guns polished up and completed, wouldn't it be well to make the bullets?\"  \"For that purpose I suggest that we make the molds out of a metal or alloy which has a higher fusing point than lead.\"  \"What is best for the purpose?\"  \"We might make an alloy of copper and zinc.\"  \"Oh! You mean brass?\"  \"Yes; that is readily cast and easily worked.\"  \"But what shape shall we make the bullets?\"  \"They should be made long, with a pointed forward end.\"  \"Why is a long bullet better than a round or globe-shaped ball?\"  \"There are several very important reasons. First, momentum is a prime element in a missile. A long one contains double the metal of a spherical one. Second, it can be made so that it will expand when the explosion of the powder takes place.\"  \"In what way does it expand?\"  \"You have noticed that the rear end of the bullet has a cavity. When the explosion takes place the thin shell at the rear end of the bullet expands, so that it tightly hugs the bore of the gun.\"  \"What is the object of having it do that?\"  \"To give the ball the benefit of the charge of powder exploded. If it does not fit tightly in the bore, more or less of the powder will pass the ball, and thus the ball loses part of its force.\"  \"What is the object of rifling the gun?\"  \"The object is to impart to the bullet a spiral motion, as it moves through the air. Metals have not the same density on all sides and this is particularly true of molded balls. As a result, when projected from the gun, the heaviest side has a tendency to divert the ball and make it more or less erratic in its motion, and, therefore, inaccurate. The spiral motion has the effect of minimizing this difficulty. The cavity formed at the rear of the projectile was devised particularly to cause the thin lip of the bullet to be driven into the grooves formed in the gun barrel, and by that means the boring motion was transmitted to the bullet.\"  \"But as we have no means of rifling our guns, there will be no necessity of putting the cavity in the rear end of our bullets.\"  \"We must have the cavity there, by all means.\"  \"What for?\"  \"Simply because we do not want the bullet to turn around and travel end over end after it leaves the gun.\"  \"How does the cavity prevent this?\"  \"You have probably forgotten that a body travels through the air with its heaviest end foremost. When a cavity is made it is lighter at that end. Without the cavity, if the forward end is pointed, it will, on leaving the gun, turn around and go through the air with the blunt end foremost.\"  The molds were made, as directed, of a hard brass composition, and when they were ready to cast them the Professor cautioned against making any castings with the molds in any position except upright, so that any inequality in the density of the metal would not form itself on the side of the cast article.  [Illustration: _Fig. 11. THE BULLET_]  Quite a time had now elapsed since the last exploration of the cave beyond Observation Hill. The Professor had spoken about it on several occasions. For some reason he was intensely interested in doing that. In fact, he appeared to be more concerned about that than any other of the unknown things about the island.  The boys could not understand this peculiarity. He had never been questioned on the subject directly, but it was evident he had a reason for this predominating wish to continue the exploration.  George was just as much interested, but, as the sequel will show, for an entirely different reason. Ever restless, and always willing to undertake anything which promised to delve into hidden things, he approached the Professor one day with the suggestion about the cave.  \"I think we ought to take one day off and go to the cave.\"  The Professor was interested at once. \"It will not do to attempt it now.\"  \"And why not?\"  \"I am afraid we could not get in very far, unless we had a boat.\"  \"Then why not use our lifeboat?\"  This suggestion met with instant favor.  \"True, I had forgotten about that.\"  It did not take George long to reach Harry with the news that the cave was to be explored by means of the boat. After considering the matter for some time it was decided to put off the trip for several days at least, principally because the late heavy rains had, in all probability, so filled the cave that they might be stopped in their progress before going very far.  It should be stated that when they entered the cave the first time, water was found about two hundred feet from its mouth and that barred their further progress. On the second trip the water had receded, so they could go in six hundred feet before coming to the water's edge. The late rains may have filled the cavities, thus making progress still more difficult.  Harry was carrying forward the boat construction, and by the occasional aid of George was bringing the hull to a completed state. While this was being done, George was at work with the loom, slowly weaving out the fabric for the sails. As the mast had been stepped back over six feet from the prow, it was concluded to make a mainsail and a jib, a small triangular sail which is attached to the forwardly projecting jib-boom. The two sails would afford greater speed than a single sail, and that was one consideration. The other was, that with two sails the mast would not need to be so long, and the dimension of the mainsail could be reduced, and still get the same efficiency.  [Illustration: _Fig. 12. THE SEA-GOING BOAT_]  The weaving of a large sail in one piece was impossible, as the loom could turn out goods only thirty inches wide, and as it could be operated by hand power solely, it will be seen that the sails required not only time, but an immense amount of patience. It is no wonder that George was anxious to take a day off at the cave, or anywhere else that afforded a change.  While at work Angel was his constant companion. It is remarkable what a degree of friendship and companionship grew up between the two. In the course of time the weaving process became so familiar to Angel that whenever George would throw the bobbin, containing the weft, through the opening of the woof threads, the animal stood ready to pull the heddles forward, so as to force the last weft thread"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20614"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: The Mysteries of the Caverns (#8)"],["body","against the one previously threaded across.     CHAPTER V  THE VOYAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANGEL, AND THE DISCOVERY   Within the next week the boat hull was practically completed, and now needed caulking. For this purpose the hemp, which had been found, as previously stated, was broken up, and as much of the woody portions removed as could be taken out, so as to make it available for filling in the crevices between the planking.  The mast was stepped in, and a sufficient quantity of manilla rope twisted for the sails, and also a supply put aboard for other needs. The sails were not yet completed, but they would doubtless be ready by the time the other parts were.  In one of their evening conferences George expressed his concern about the future of Angel.  \"For my part I do not want to leave him behind.\"  \"Then why not take him with us?\" asked the Professor.  Harry had some doubts on this point, but George was too insistent to brook any thought of leaving him behind.  \"I make this suggestion, George: Before the time of sailing it would be advisable for you to make several trips with Angel in the small boat, and see how he behaves. In some respects he would be an acquisition to us.\"  The boys had not forgotten how the animal, during their various trips, had been of material assistance, nor the times when nutting how Angel understood what they were after, and would climb trees and shower them down, and then gravely help to load them into the wagon; and they remembered the recovery of the flag. Such service was appreciated.  As it was, Angel was invited to take a sail. The lifeboat recovered in South River had been named No. 2, as they insisted on calling their own wrecked vessel No. 1.  No. 2 was launched. A small sail, had been rigged up, and two good oars provided for it. Angel was completely at the command of George, and when he was called and taken down to the landing in front of the boathouse, he went without any hesitancy. But to induce him to enter the boat was another matter.  Suspecting there would be some difficulty, George pulled a small jar of honey from his pocket, and silently began to eat it. Angel's eyes blinked. It was such an unheard of thing for George to do this without extending an invitation to join. He shambled over, but George walked to the boat and sat down in it, not appearing to notice the eager look on the animal's face.  Without further urging he stepped aboard, and George put his arm around him, as Harry, with oar in hand, pushed the boat from the shore. Angel was startled, and tried to get away, but soothing words soon quieted him, and before they reached the mouth of the Cataract he was leaning over the gunwale and playing with the water in the most approved boy-like fashion.  When, however, they had passed the comparatively calm waters in the estuary, and were rounding the cliffs, poor Angel forgot his sport, and sat as one paralyzed, gazing at the sight of the waves beating against the shore line. George went up to him, and spoke encouragingly, and it was fully a half hour before he was restored to his usual calm. Then, apparently, he noticed for the first time the peculiar rocking motion of the vessel. Every time it swayed to the right or to the left he would give that peculiar chuckle which always indicated delight.  They went around the point to the east, and passed down the coast in a southerly direction, going as far as the cape north and east of the mouth of South River.  \"Steer for the shore, George; steer for the shore; what is that to the right?\" said Harry, pointing to the beach.  \"It looks like a boat, sure enough.\"  As the wind was coming directly from the shore they had to depend on the oars to bring the vessel around, and as they came in could distinctly make out the side of a boat lying among debris, in an inclined position, against a rather steep beach.  \"It is our boat, Harry.\" The moment their vessel came alongside, Angel jumped off and leaped over to the boat on the shore. Evidently he also had recognized it.  \"Well, isn't this a find?\"  \"How long do you suppose this has been here? I am glad we gave Angel an outing.\"  \"Shall we take it with us?\"  \"Yes; if we have to carry it overland,\" was Harry's reply.  \"Let us float it.\"  It was not much of a task to do this, and with a short rope it was hitched to the stern of No. 2. Angel remained in the recovered boat, and when No. 2 was pushed from the shore, and the sail set, its movement did not seem to perturb him in the least, but when the oscillations again began to be perceptible, he commenced to gurgle, and George knew they had a good sailor to take with them.  The sail took a little over three hours, and as they passed up the Cataract River, and approached their home, the boys set up a welcoming shriek, in imitation of incoming steamers, which so delighted Angel that he scampered in a delirium of joy from one end of the craft to the other. It is doubtful whether he had ever in his short life had such a glorious time, and that he remembered it his subsequent history furnishes the best evidence.  The Professor was just as much delighted as the boys at the sight of their first marine production, which had gotten away from them and stranded them on the cliffs three months before. \"I am sorry now that you named the other boats, because this is really No. 1.\"  \"Never mind; this is good enough to be No. 3. Just look at our navy!\"  \"Where did you find it?\"  \"Near the point, south of the bay.\"  \"Then it must have been washed there during the late storms, because I do not think it is possible that it could have gone there at the time it escaped you, as the wind was blowing directly to the west at that time.\"  The boys now remembered the circumstance, and as they recalled the condition of the driftwood around it when they found it on the beach, it was plain that the storm had been their friend in this case.  \"Have you been using oars on the boat?\" was the Professor's inquiry, as he bent over the side and examined the notches which were made for the oars.  \"No; why do you ask?\"  \"This boat has been used by some one, and not very long ago, at that. Notice how the forward sides of these notches are worn. It also seems that civilized people have been using the boat.\"  The information was so startling that neither of the boys could answer for a moment. Did they have another mystery to contend with?  But George was alert on the questioning end of any proposition. \"Do you really think white people have had the boat? I do not see anything that would make you think so.\"  \"If they were savages they wouldn't use the oarlocks or notches, as they row free-hand, almost without exception; but get a white man in a boat, and the first thing he looks for is a place to put his oars in. This incident in itself shows one of the distinguishing features between the civilized and the uncivilized people.\"  \"In what way is one civilized and the other not?\"  \"I did not say one was civilized and the other uncivilized. The most wonderful thing in the advancement of the human race from a state of savagery to civilization, was the discovery and utilization of a fulcrum. Whenever man, in an advanced state, undertakes to do anything, he uses a fulcrum of some kind.\"  \"In what way is it so useful?\"  \"Primarily, in the form of a wedge, a pulley, a wheel and axle, an inclined plane, a screw or a lever. All these forms do the same thing as the simple lever; and what sort of mechanism could be made without some of these elements? The row-lock is simply the fulcrum for the oar, is it not? When Archimedes discovered the principles of the lever, he was so excited that he declared he could move the earth if he could find a fulcrum.\"  A careful examination of the notched gunwale showed conclusively that it had been used to a considerable extent. George sat and pondered over this. \"I am sure we never used the boat enough with the oars to wear it in this way. Had you examined this when you said that the boat had not been long at the point where we found it?\"  \"No,\" answered the Professor; \"I simply remembered that on the day you lost it the wind was blowing to the west, and as you found it to the east of the cliffs, I inferred it must have been carried around since that time.\"  \"It is evident then that the people who used this boat live to the west of us?\"  \"That is my only conclusion.\"  \"Then you think the fire in the forest, and the light which we saw that night beyond the West River, were made by those people?\"  \"I am sure the fire we saw was made by savages, but I am not so certain about the lights having been made by them.\"  Harry looked at the Professor, and then at George, and slowly shook his head. \"Wasn't it lucky we didn't meet them when we made our trip to the river?\"  That evening the inevitable subject of their forthcoming voyage was again discussed, and to the surprise of the boys, the Professor urged delay. His reasons were expressed as follows:  \"While we have had some very severe storms of the kind which may be expected, we are not sure that the weather is yet fully settled. That is the only reason I urge delay. If, on the other hand, we should decide to take an overland journey, we could set out at once.\"  Harry was opposed to taking another trip by land. \"We have really found out more by the water route than going by land. For that reason it would be well for us to make at least one adventure by sea.\"  These arguments prevailed in the minds of all, and while it would take some time before all preparations could be made, all were happy at the thought that when they did undertake the journey something definite would be learned to clear up a few of the mysteries of Wonder Island.  The Professor did find some samples of tourmaline, in a finely divided state, and this gem was used to polish the gun barrels, so that all the weapons were finally put into condition where they could be used.
