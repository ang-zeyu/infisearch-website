But it was small wonder that the King asked; small wonder, for the man's face had changed in the last ten seconds to a strange leaden colour; a terror like that of a wild beast that sees itself trapped had leapt into his eyes.  He shot a furtive glance round him, and I saw him slide his hand behind him.  But I was prepared for that, and as the King moved off a space I slipped to the man's side, as if to give him some directions about his game.  \"Listen,\" I said, in a voice heard only by him; \"take the dressing off your hand, and I have you broken on the wheel.  You understand?  Now play.\"  Assuring myself that he did understand, and that Maignan and La Trape were at hand if he should attempt anything, I went back to my place, and sitting down by De Vic began to watch that strange game; while Mademoiselle's laughter and Madame de Lude's gibes floated across the court, and mingled with the eager applause and more dexterous criticisms of the courtiers.  The light was beginning to sink, and for this reason, perhaps, no one perceived the Spaniard's pallor; but De Vic, after a rally or two, remarked that he was not playing his full strength.  \"Wise man!\"  he added.  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"Who plays well against kings plays ill.\"  De Vic laughed.  \"How he sweats!\"  he said, \"and he never turned a hair when he played Colet.  I suppose he is nervous.\"  \"Probably,\" I said.  And so they chattered and laughed--chattered and laughed, seeing an ordinary game between the King and a marker; while I, for whom the court had grown sombre as a dungeon, saw a villain struggling in his own toils, livid with the fear of death, and tortured by horrible apprehensions.  Use and habit were still so powerful with the man that he played on mechanically with his hands, but his eyes every now and then sought mine with the look of the trapped beast; and on these occasions I could see his lips move in prayer or cursing.  The sweat poured down his face as he moved to and fro, and I, fancied that his features were beginning to twitch.  Presently--I have said that the light was failing, so that it was not in my imagination only that the court was sombre--the King held his ball.  \"My friend, your man is not well,\" he said, turning to me.  \"It is nothing, sire; the honour you do him makes him nervous,\" I answered.  \"Play up, sirrah,\" I continued; \"you make too good a courtier.\"  Mademoiselle d'Entragues clapped her hands and laughed at the hit; and I saw Diego glare at her with an indescribable look, in which hatred and despair and a horror of reproach were so nicely mingled with something as exceptional as his position, that the whole baffled words. Doubtless the gibes and laughter he heard, the trifling that went on round him, the very game in which he was engaged, and from which he dared not draw back, seemed in his eyes the most appalling mockery; but ignorant who were in the secret, unable to guess how his diabolical plot had been discovered, uncertain even whether the whole were not a concerted piece, he went on playing his part mechanically; with starting eyes and labouring chest, and lips that, twitching and working, lost colour each minute.  At length he missed a stroke, and staggering leaned against the wall, his-face livid and ghastly. The King took the alarm at that, and cried out that something was wrong. Those who were sitting rose.  I nodded to Maignan to go to the man.  \"It is a fit,\" I said.  \"He is subject to them, and doubtless the excitement--but I am sorry that it has spoiled your Majesty's game.  \"It has not,\" Henry answered kindly.  \"The light is gone.  But have him looked to, will you, my friend?  If La Riviere were here he might do something for him.\"  While he spoke, the servants had gathered round the man, but with the timidity which characterises that class in such emergencies, they would not touch him.  As I crossed the court, and they made way for me, the Spaniard, who was still standing, though in a strange and distorted fashion, turned his bloodshot eyes on me.  \"A priest!\"  he muttered, framing the words with difficulty, \"a priest!\"  I directed Maignan to fetch one.  \"And do you,\" I continued to the other servants, \"take him into a room somewhere.\"  They obeyed, reluctantly.  As they carried him out, the King, content with my statement, was giving his hand to Mademoiselle to descend the stairs; and neither he nor any, save the two men in my confidence, had the slightest suspicion that aught was the matter beyond a natural illness.  But I shuddered when I considered how narrow had been the King's escape, how trifling the circumstance which had led to suspicion, how fortuitous the inspiration by which I had chanced on discovery.  The delay of a single day, the occurrence of the slightest mishap, might have been fatal not to him only but to the best interests of France; which his death at a time when he was still childless must have plunged into the most melancholy of wars.  Of the wretched Spaniard I need say little more.  Caught in his own snare, he was no sooner withdrawn from the court than he fell into violent convulsions, which held him until midnight when he died with symptoms and under circumstances so nearly resembling those which had attended the death of Madame de Beaufort at Easter, that I have several times dwelt on the strange coincidence, and striven to find the connecting link.  But I never hit on it; and the King's death, and that unexplained tendency to imitate great crimes under which the vulgar labour, prevailed with me to keep the matter secret.  Nay, as I believed that d'Evora had played the part of an unconscious tool, and as a hint pressed home sufficed to procure the withdrawal of the chaplain whom Maignan had named, I did not think it necessary to disclose the matter even to the King my master.     III.  TWO MAYORS OF BOTTITORT.   Believing that I have now set down all those particulars of the treaty with Epernon and the consequent pacification of Brittany in the year 1598 which it will be of advantage to the public to know, that it may the better distinguish in the future those who have selfishly impoverished the State from those who, in its behalf, have incurred obloquy and high looks, I proceed next to the events which followed the King's return to Paris.  But, first, and by way of sampling the diverting episodes that will occur from time to time in the most laborious existence, and for the moment reduce the minister to the level of the man, I am tempted to narrate an adventure that befell me on my return, between Rennes and Vitre; when the King having preceded me at speed under the pretext of urgency, but really that he might avoid the prolix addresses that awaited him in every town, I found myself no more minded to suffer. Having sacrificed my ease, therefore, in two of the more important places, and come within as many stages of Vitre, I determined also on a holiday. Accordingly, directing my baggage and the numerous escort and suite that attended me to the full tale of four-score horses--to keep the high road, I struck myself into a byway, intending to seek hospitality for the night at a house of M. de Laval's; and on the second evening to render myself with a good grace to the eulogia and tedious mercies of the Vitre townsfolk.  I kept with me only La Font and two servants.  The day was fine, and the air brisk; the country open, affording many distant prospects which the sun rendered cheerful.  We rode for some time, therefore, with the gaiety of schoolboys released from their tasks, and dining at noon in the lee of one of the great boulders that there dot the plain, took pleasure in applying to the life of courts every evil epithet that came to mind.  For a little time afterwards we rode as cheerfully; but about three in the afternoon the sky became overcast, and almost at the same moment we discovered that we had strayed from the track.  The country in that district resembles the more western parts of Brittany, in consisting of huge tracts of bog and moorland strewn with rocks and covered with gorse; which present a cheerful aspect in sunshine, but are savage and barren to a degree when viewed through sheets of rain or under a sombre sky.  The position, therefore, was not without its discomforts.  I had taken care to choose a servant who was familiar with the country, but his knowledge seemed now at fault.  However, under his direction we retraced our steps, but still without regaining the road; and as a small rain presently began to fall and the day to decline, the landscape which in the morning had flaunted a wild and rugged beauty, changed to a brown and dreary waste set here and there with ghost-like stones.  Once astray on this, we found our path beset with sloughs and morasses; among which we saw every prospect of passing the night, when La Font espied at a little distance a wind-swept wood that, clothing a low shoulder of the moor, promised at least a change and shelter.  We made towards it, and discovered not only all that we had expected to see, but a path and a guide.  The latter was as much surprised to see us as we to see her, for when we came upon her she was sitting on the bank beside the path weeping bitterly.  On hearing us, however, she sprang up and discovered the form of a young girl, bare-foot and bareheaded, wearing only a short ragged frock of homespun.  Nevertheless, her face was neither stupid nor uncomely; and though, at the first alarm, supposing us to be either robbers or hobgoblins--of which last the people of that country are peculiarly fearful--she made as if she would escape across the moor, she stopped as soon as she heard my voice.  I asked her gently where we were.  At first she did not understand, but the servant who had played the guide so ill, speaking to her in the PATOIS of the country, she answered that we were near St. Brieuc, a hamlet not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2079"],["title","From the Memoirs of a Minister of France (#7)"],["body"," from Bottitort, and considerably off our road.  Asked how far it was to Bottitort, she answered--between two and three leagues, and an indifferent road.  We could ride the distance in a couple of hours, and there remained almost as much daylight.  But the horses were tired, so, resigning myself to the prospect of some discomfort, I asked her if there was an inn at St. Brieuc.  \"A poor place for your honours,\" she answered, staring at us in innocent wonder, the forgotten tears not dry on her cheeks.  \"Never mind; take us to it,\" I answered.  She turned at the word and tripped on before us.  I bade the servant ask her, as we went, why she had been crying, and learned through him that she had been to her uncle's two leagues away to borrow money for her mother; that the uncle would not lend it, and that now they would be turned out of their house; that her father was lately dead, and that her mother kept the inn, and owed the money for meal and cider.  \"At least, she says that she does not owe it,\" the man corrected himself, \"for her father paid as usual at Corpus Christi; but after his death M. Grabot said that he had not paid, and--\"  \"M. Grabot?\"  I said.  \"Who is he?\"  \"The Mayor of Bottitort.\"  \"The creditor?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And how much is owing?\"  I asked.  \"Nothing, she says.\"  \"But how much does he say?\"  \"Twenty crowns.\"  Doubtless some will view my conduct on this occasion with surprise; and wonder why I troubled myself with inquiries so minute upon a matter so mean.  But these do not consider that ministers are the King's eyes; and that in a State no class is so unimportant that it can be safely overlooked.  Moreover, as the settlement of the finances was one of the objects of my stay in those parts--and I seldom had the opportunity of checking the statements made to me by the farmers and lessees of the taxes, the receivers, gatherers, and, in a word, all the corrupt class that imparts such views of a province as suit its interests--I was glad to learn anything that threw light on the real condition of the country:  the more, as I had to receive at Vitre a deputation of the notables and officials of the district.  Accordingly, I continued to put questions to her until, crossing a ridge, we came at last within sight of the inn, a lonely house of stone, standing in the hollow of the moor and sheltered on one side by a few gnarled trees that took off in a degree from the bleakness of its aspect.  The house was of one story only, with a window on either side of the door, and no other appeared in sight; but a little smoke rising from the chimney seemed to promise a better reception than the desolate landscape and the girl's scanty dress had led us to expect.  As we drew nearer, however, a thing happened so remarkable as to draw our attention in a moment from all these points, and bring us, gaping, to a standstill.  The shutters of the two windows were suddenly closed before our eyes with a clap that came sharply on the wind.  Then, in a twinkling, one window flew open again and a man, seemingly naked, bounded from it, fled with inconceivable rapidity across the front of the house and vanished through the other window, which opened to receive him.  He had scarcely gained that shelter before a coal-black figure followed him, leaping out of the one window and in at the other with the same astonishing swiftness--a swiftness which was so great that before any of us could utter more than an exclamation, the two figures appeared again round the corner of the house, in the same order, but this time with so small an interval that the fugitive barely saved himself through the window.  Once more, while we stared in stupefaction, they flashed out and in; and this time it seemed to me that as they vanished the black spectre seized its victim.  When I say that all this time the two figures uttered no sound, that there was no other living being in sight, and that on every side of the solitary house the moor, growing each minute more eerie as the day waned, spread to the horizon, the more superstitious among us may be pardoned if they gave way to their fears.  La Font was the first to speak.  \"MON DIEU!\"  he cried--while the girl moaned in terror, the Breton crossed himself, and La Trape looked uncomfortable--\"the place is bewitched!\"  \"Nonsense!\"  I said.  \"Who is in the house, girl?\"  \"Only my mother,\" she wailed.  \"Oh, my poor mother!\"  I silenced her, scolding them all for fools, and her first; and La Font, recovering himself, did the same.  But this was the year of that strange appearance of the spectre horseman at Fontainebleau of which so much has been said; and my servants, when we had approached the house a little nearer, and it still remained silent and, as it were, dead to the eye, would go no farther, but stood in sheer terror and permitted me to go on alone with La Font.  I confess that the loneliness of the house, and the dreary waste that surrounded it (which seemed to exclude the idea of trickery) were not without their effect on my spirits; and that as I dismounted and approached the door, I felt a kind of chill not remarkable under the circumstances.  But the courage of the gentleman differs from that of the vulgar in that he fears yet goes; and I lifted the latch, and entered boldly. The scene which met my eyes inside was sufficiently commonplace to reassure me.  At the farther end of a long bare room, draughty, half-lighted, and having an earthen floor, yet possessing that air of homeliness which a wood fire never fails to impart, sat a single traveller; who had drawn his small table under the open chimney, and there, with his feet almost in the fire, was partaking of a poor meal of black bread and onions.  He was a tall, spare man, with sloping shoulders and a long sour face, of which, as I entered, he gave me the full benefit.  I looked round the room, but look as I might I could see no one else, nor anything that explained what we had witnessed and I accosted the man civilly, wishing him good evening.  He made an answer, but indistinctly, and, this done, went on with his meal like one who viewed our arrival with little pleasure; while I, puzzled and astonished by the ordinary look of things and the stillness of the house, affected to warm my feet at the logs.  At length, espying no signs of disturbance anywhere, I asked him if he was alone.  \"I was, sir,\" he answered gravely.  I was going on to tell him, though reluctantly, what we had seen outside, and to question him upon it, when on a sudden, before I could speak again, he leaned towards me and accosted me with startling abruptness.  \"Sir,\" he said, \"I should like to have your opinion of Louis Eleven.\"  I stared at him in the most perfect astonishment; and was for a moment so completely taken aback that I mechanically repeated his words.  For answer, he did so also.  \"The Eleventh Louis?\"  I said.  \"Yes,\" he rejoined, turning his pale visage full upon me.  \"What is your opinion of him, sir?  He was a man?\"  \"Well,\" I said, shrugging my shoulders, \"I take that for granted.\"  I began to think that the traveller was demented.  \"And a king?\"  \"Yes, I suppose so,\" I answered contemptuously.  \"I never heard it doubted.\"  He leaned towards me, and spoke with the most eager impressiveness.  \"A man--and a king!\"  he said.  \"Yet neither a manly king, nor a kingly man!  You take me?\"  \"Yes,\" I said impatiently.  \"I see what you mean.  \"Neither a kingly man, nor a manly king!\"  he repeated with solemn gusto.  \"You take me clearly, I think?\"  I had no stomach for further fooleries, and I was about to answer him with some sharpness--though I could not for the life of me tell whether he was mad or an eccentric when a harsh voice shrieked in my ear, \"Bob!\"  and in a twinkling a red figure appeared bounding and whirling in the middle of the kitchen; now springing into the air until its head touched the rafters, now eddying round and round the floor in the giddiest gyrations.  At the first glance, startled by the voice in my ear, I recoiled; but a second disclosing what it was, and the secret of our alarm outside, I masked my movement; and when the man brought his performance to a sudden stop, and falling on one knee in an attitude of exaggerated respect held out his cap, I was ready for him.  \"Why, you knave,\" I said, \"you should be whipped, not rewarded. Who gave you leave to play pranks on travellers?\"  He looked at me with a droll smile on his round merry face, which at its gravest was a thing to laugh at.  \"Let him whip who is scared,\" he said, with roguish impudence.  \"Or if there is to be whipping, my lord, whip Louis XI.\"  Thus reminded, I turned to the solemn traveller; but my eyes had no sooner met his than he twisted his visage into so wry a smile--if smile it could be called--that wherever there was a horse collar he must have won the prize.  To hide my amusement, I asked them what they were. \"Mountebanks?\"  I said curtly.  \"Your lordship has pricked the garter offhand,\" the merry man answered cheerfully.  \"You see before you the renowned Pierre Paladin VOILA!--and Philibert Le Grand!  of the Breton fairs, monsieur.\"  \"But why this foolery--here?\"  I said.  \"We took you for another, monsieur,\" he answered.  \"Whom you intended to frighten?\"  \"Precisely, your grace.\"  \"Well, you are nice rogues,\" I said, looking at him.  \"So is he,\" he answered, undaunted.  I left the matter there for a moment, while I summoned La Font and the servants; whose rage, when, entering a-tiptoe and with some misgiving, they discovered how they had been deceived, and by whom, was scarcely to be restrained even by my presence. However, aided by Philibert's comicalities, I presently secured a truce, and the two strollers vacating in my honour the table by the fire--though they had not the slightest notion who I was we were soon on terms.  I had taken the precaution to bring a meal with me, and while La Trape and his companion unpacked it, and I dried my riding boots, I asked the"]]]
