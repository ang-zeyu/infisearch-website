The smile had gone from his lips and eyes. His face was haggard--he was a man at bay.  \"That is what I said,\" said Lyne watching him. \"Isn't that the fact?\"  There was a long pause, and presently Milburgh nodded.  \"That is the fact, sir,\" he said in a low voice.  \"And you have told me that you suspected Miss Rider of defalcations?\"  Again the pause and again the man nodded.  \"Do you hear?\" asked Lyne triumphantly.  \"I hear,\" said Tarling quietly. \"Now what do you wish me to do? Isn't this a matter for the police? I mean the regular police.\"  Lyne frowned.  \"The case has to be prepared first,\" he said. \"I will give you full particulars as to the girl's address and her habits, and it will be your business to collect such information as will enable us to put the case in the hands of Scotland Yard.\"  \"I see,\" said Tarling and smiled again. Then he shook his head. \"I'm afraid I can't come into this case, Mr. Lyne.\"  \"Can't come in?\" said Lyne in astonishment. \"Why not?\"  \"Because it's not my kind of job,\" said Tarling. \"The first time I met you I had a feeling that you were leading me to one of the biggest cases I had ever undertaken. It shows you how one's instincts can lead one astray,\" he smiled again, and picked up his hat.  \"What do you mean? You're going to throw up a valuable client?\"  \"I don't know how valuable you're likely to be,\" said Tarling, \"but at the present moment the signs are not particularly encouraging. I tell you I do not wish to be associated with this case, Mr. Lyne, and I think there the matter can end.\"  \"You don't think it's worth while, eh?\" sneered Lyne. \"Yet when I tell you that I am prepared to give you a fee of five hundred guineas----\"  \"If you gave me a fee of five thousand guineas, or fifty thousand guineas, I should still decline to be associated with this matter,\" said Tarling, and his words had the metallic quality which precludes argument.  \"At any rate, I am entitled to know why you will not take up this case. Do you know the girl?\" asked Lyne loudly.  \"I have never met the lady and probably never shall,\" said Tarling. \"I only know that I will not be concerned with what is called in the United States of America a 'frame up.'\"  \"Frame up?\" repeated the other.  \"A frame up. I dare say you know what it means--I will put the matter more plainly and within your understanding. For some reason or other you have a sudden grudge against a member of your staff. I read your face, Mr. Lyne, and the weakness of your chin and the appetite of your mouth suggest to me that you are not over scrupulous with the women who are in your charge. I guess rather than know that you have been turned down with a dull, sickening thud by a decent girl, and in your mortification you are attempting to invent a charge which has no substance and no foundation.  \"Mr. Milburgh,\" he turned to the other, and again Mr. Milburgh ceased to smile, \"has his own reasons for complying with your wishes. He is your subordinate, and moreover, the side threat of penal servitude for him if he refuses has carried some weight.\"  Thornton Lyne's face was distorted with fury.  \"I will take care that your behaviour is widely advertised,\" he said. \"You have brought a most monstrous charge against me, and I shall proceed against you for slander. The truth is that you are not equal to the job I intended giving you and you are finding an excuse for getting out.\"  \"The truth is,\" replied Tarling, biting off the end of a cigar he had taken from his pocket, \"that my reputation is too good to be risked in associating with such a dirty business as yours. I hate to be rude, and I hate just as much to throw away good money. But I can't take good money for bad work, Mr. Lyne, and if you will be advised by me, you will drop this stupid scheme for vengeance which your hurt vanity has suggested--it is the clumsiest kind of frame up that was ever invented--and also you will go and apologise to the young lady, whom, I have no doubt, you have grossly insulted.\"  He beckoned to his Chinese satellite and walked leisurely to the door. Incoherent with rage, shaking in every limb with a weak man's sense of his own impotence, Lyne watched him until the door was half-closed, then, springing forward with a strangled cry, he wrenched the door open and leapt at the detective.  Two hands gripped his arm and lifting him bodily back into the room, pushed him down into a chair. A not unkindly face blinked down at him, a face relieved from utter solemnity by the tiny laughter lines about the eyes.  \"Mr. Lyne,\" said the mocking voice of Tarling, \"you are setting an awful example to the criminal classes. It is a good job your convict friend is in gaol.\"  Without another word he left the room.     CHAPTER III  THE MAN WHO LOVED LYNE   Two days later Thornton Lyne sat in his big limousine which was drawn up on the edge of Wandsworth Common, facing the gates of the gaol.  Poet and _poseur_ he was, the strangest combination ever seen in man.  Thornton Lyne was a store-keeper, a Bachelor of Arts, the winner of the Mangate Science Prize and the author of a slim volume. The quality of the poetry therein was not very great--but it was undoubtedly a slim volume printed in queerly ornate type with old-fashioned esses and wide margins. He was a store-keeper because store-keeping supplied him with caviare and peaches, a handsome little two-seater, a six-cylinder limousine for state occasions, a country house and a flat in town, the decorations of which ran to a figure which would have purchased many stores of humbler pretensions than Lyne's Serve First Emporium.  To the elder Lyne, Joseph Emanuel of that family, the inception and prosperity of Lyne's Serve First Emporium was due. He had devised a sale system which ensured every customer being attended to the moment he or she entered one of the many departments which made up the splendid whole of the emporium. It was a system based upon the age-old principle of keeping efficient reserves within call.  Thornton Lyne succeeded to the business at a moment when his slim volume had placed him in the category of the gloriously misunderstood. Because such reviewers as had noticed his book wrote of his \"poetry\" using inverted commas to advertise their scorn, and because nobody bought the volume despite its slimness, he became the idol of men and women who also wrote that which nobody read, and in consequence developed souls with the celerity that a small boy develops stomachache.  For nothing in the wide world was more certain to the gloriously misunderstood than this: the test of excellence is scorn. Thornton Lyne might in different circumstances have drifted upward to sets even more misunderstood--yea, even to a set superior to marriage and soap and clean shirts and fresh air--only his father died of a surfeit, and Thornton became the Lyne of Lyne's Serve First.  His first inclination was to sell the property and retire to a villa in Florence or Capri. Then the absurdity, the rich humour of an idea, struck him. He, a scholar, a gentleman and a misunderstood poet, sitting in the office of a store, appealed to him. Somebody remarked in his hearing that the idea was \"rich.\" He saw himself in \"character\" and the part appealed to him. To everybody's surprise he took up his father's work, which meant that he signed cheques, collected profits and left the management to the Soults and the Neys whom old Napoleon Lyne had relied upon in the foundation of his empire.  Thornton wrote an address to his 3,000 employees--which address was printed on decided antique paper in queerly ornate type with wide margins. He quoted Seneca, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius and the \"Iliad.\" The \"address\" secured better and longer reviews in the newspapers than had his book.  He had found life a pleasant experience--all the more piquant because of the amazement of innumerable ecstatic friends who clasped their hands and asked awefully: \"How _can_ you--a man of your temperament...!\"  Life might have gone on being pleasant if every man and woman he had met had let him have his own way. Only there were at least two people with whom Thornton Lyne's millions carried no weight.  It was warm in his limousine, which was electrically heated. But outside, on that raw April morning, it was bitterly cold, and the shivering little group of women who stood at a respectful distance from the prison gates, drew their shawls tightly about them as errant flakes of snow whirled across the open. The common was covered with a white powder, and the early flowers looked supremely miserable in their wintry setting.  The prison clock struck eight, and a wicket-gate opened. A man slouched out, his jacket buttoned up to his neck, his cap pulled over his eyes. At sight of him, Lyne dropped the newspaper he had been reading, opened the door of the car and jumped out, walking towards the released prisoner.  \"Well, Sam,\" he said, genially \"you didn't expect me?\"  The man stopped as if he had been shot, and stood staring at the fur-coated figure. Then:  \"Oh, Mr. Lyne,\" he said brokenly. \"Oh, guv'nor!\" he choked, and tears streamed down his face, and he gripped the outstretched hand in both of his, unable to speak.  \"You didn't think I'd desert you, Sam, eh?\" said Mr. Lyne, all aglow with consciousness of his virtue.  \"I thought you'd given me up, sir,\" said Sam Stay huskily. \"You're a gentleman, you are, sir, and I ought to be ashamed of myself!\"  \"Nonsense, nonsense, Sam! Jump into the car, my lad. Go along. People will think you're a millionaire.\"  The man gulped, grinned sheepishly, opened the door and stepped in, and sank with a sigh of comfort into the luxurious depths of the big brown cushions.  \"Gawd! To think that there are men like you in the world, sir! Why, I believe in angels, I do!\"  \"Nonsense Sam. Now you come along to my flat, and I'm going to give you a good breakfast and start you fair again.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],["title","The Daffodil Mystery (#3)"],["body","  \"I'm going to try and keep straight, sir, I am s'help me!\"  It may be said in truth that Mr. Lyne did not care very much whether Sam kept straight or not. He might indeed have been very much disappointed if Sam had kept to the straight and narrow path. He \"kept\" Sam as men keep chickens and prize cows, and he \"collected\" Sam as other men collect stamps and china. Sam was his luxury and his pose. In his club he boasted of his acquaintance with this representative of the criminal classes--for Sam was an expert burglar and knew no other trade--and Sam's adoration for him was one of his most exhilarating experiences.  And that adoration was genuine. Sam would have laid down his life for the pale-faced man with the loose mouth. He would have suffered himself to be torn limb from limb if in his agony he could have brought ease or advancement to the man who, to him, was one with the gods.  Originally, Thornton Lyne had found Sam whilst that artist was engaged in burgling the house of his future benefactor. It was a whim of Lyne's to give the criminal a good breakfast and to evince an interest in his future. Twice had Sam gone down for a short term, and once for a long term of imprisonment, and on each occasion Thornton Lyne had made a parade of collecting the returned wanderer, driving him home, giving him breakfast and a great deal of worldly and unnecessary advice, and launching him forth again upon the world with ten pounds--a sum just sufficient to buy Sam a new kit of burglar's tools.  Never before had Sam shown such gratitude; and never before had Thornton Lyne been less disinterested in his attentions. There was a hot bath--which Sam Stay could have dispensed with, but which, out of sheer politeness, he was compelled to accept, a warm and luxurious breakfast; a new suit of clothes, with not two, but four, five-pound notes in the pocket.  After breakfast, Lyne had his talk.  \"It's no good, sir,\" said the burglar, shaking his head. \"I've tried everything to get an honest living, but somehow I can't get on in the straight life. I drove a taxicab for three months after I came out, till a busy-fellow[A] tumbled to me not having a license, and brought me up under the Prevention of Crimes Act. It's no use my asking you to give me a job in your shop, sir, because I couldn't stick it, I couldn't really! I'm used to the open air life; I like being my own master. I'm one of those fellows you've read about--the word begins with A.\"  [Footnote A: Detective.]  \"Adventurers?\" said Lyne with a little laugh. \"Yes, I think you are, Sam, and I'm going to give you an adventure after your own heart.\"  And then he began to tell a tale of base ingratitude--of a girl he had helped, had indeed saved from starvation and who had betrayed him at every turn. Thornton Lyne was a poet. He was also a picturesque liar. The lie came as easily as the truth, and easier, since there was a certain crudeness about truth which revolted his artistic soul. And as the tale was unfolded of Odette Rider's perfidy, Sam's eyes narrowed. There was nothing too bad for such a creature as this. She was wholly undeserving of sympathy.  Presently Thornton Lyne stopped, his eyes fixed on the other to note the effect.  \"Show me,\" said Sam, his voice trembling. \"Show me a way of getting even with her, sir, and I'll go through hell to do it!\"  \"That's the kind of stuff I like to hear,\" said Lyne, and poured out from the long bottle which stood on the coffee-tray a stiff tot of Sam's favourite brandy. \"Now, I'll give you my idea.\"  For the rest of the morning the two men sat almost head to head, plotting woe for the girl, whose chief offence had been against the dignity of Thornton Lyne, and whose virtue had incited the hate of that vicious man.     CHAPTER IV  MURDER   Jack Tarling lay stretched upon his hard bed, a long cigarette-holder between his teeth, a book on Chinese metaphysics balanced on his chest, at peace with the world. The hour was eight o'clock, and it was the day that Sam Stay had been released from gaol.  It had been a busy day for Tarling, for he was engaged in a bank fraud case which would have occupied the whole of his time had he not had a little private business to attend to. This private matter was wholly unprofitable, but his curiosity had been piqued.  He lay the book flat on his chest as the soft click of the opening door announced the coming of his retainer. The impassive Ling Chu came noiselessly into the room, carrying a tray, which he placed upon a low table by the side of his master's bed. The Chinaman wore a blue silk pyjama suit--a fact which Tarling noticed.  \"You are not going out to-night then, Ling Chu?\"  \"No, Lieh Jen,\" said the man.  They both spoke in the soft, sibilant patois of Shantung.  \"You have been to the Man with the Cunning Face?\"  For answer the other took an envelope from an inside pocket and laid it in the other's hand. Tarling glanced at the address.  \"So this is where the young lady lives, eh? Miss Odette Rider, 27, Carrymore Buildings, Edgware Road.\"  \"It is a clan house, where many people live,\" said Ling Chu. \"I myself went, in your honourable service, and saw people coming in and going out interminably, and never the same people did I see twice.\"  \"It is what they call in English a 'flat building,' Ling,\" said Tarling with a little smile. \"What did the Man with the Cunning Face say to my letter?\"  \"Master, he said nothing. He just read and read, and then he made a face like this.\" Ling gave an imitation of Mr. Milburgh's smile. \"And then he wrote as you see.\"  Tarling nodded. He stared for a moment into vacancy, then he turned on his elbow and lifted the cup of tea which his servant had brought him.  \"What of Face-White-and-Weak Man, Ling?\" he asked in the vernacular. \"You saw him?\"  \"I saw him, master,\" said the Chinaman gravely. \"He is a man without a heaven.\"  Again Tarling nodded. The Chinese use the word \"heaven\" instead of \"God,\" and he felt that Ling had very accurately sized up Mr. Thornton Lyne's lack of spiritual qualities.  He finished the tea, and swung his legs over the edge of the bed.  \"Ling,\" he said, \"this place is very dull and sad. I do not think I shall live here.\"  \"Will the master go back to Shanghai?\" asked the other, without any display of emotion.  \"I think so,\" nodded Tarling. \"At any rate, this place is too dull. Just miserable little taking-money-easily cases, and wife-husband-lover cases and my soul is sick.\"  \"These are small matters,\" said Ling philosophically. \"But The Master\"--this time he spoke of the great Master, Confucius--\"has said that all greatness comes from small things, and perhaps some small-piece man will cut off the head of some big-piece man, and then they will call you to find the murderer.\"  Tarling laughed.  \"You're an optimist, Ling,\" he said. \"No, I don't think they'll call me in for a murder. They don't call in private detectives in this country.\"  Ling shook his head.  \"But the master must find murderers, or he will no longer be Lieh Jen, the Hunter of Men.\"  \"You're a bloodthirsty soul, Ling,\" said Tarling, this time in English, which Ling imperfectly understood, despite the sustained efforts of eminent missionary schools. \"Now I'll go out,\" he said with sudden resolution. \"I am going to call upon the small-piece woman whom White-Face desires.\"  \"May I come with you?\" asked Ling.  Tarling hesitated.  \"Yes, you may come,\" he said, \"but you must trail me.\"  Carrymore Mansions is a great block of buildings sandwiched between two more aristocratic and more expensive blocks of flats in the Edgware Road. The ground floor is given up to lock-up shops which perhaps cheapened the building, but still it was a sufficiently exclusive habitation for the rents, as Tarling guessed, to be a little too high for a shop assistant, unless she were living with her family. The explanation, as he was to discover, lay in the fact that there were some very undesirable basement flats which were let at a lower rental.  He found himself standing outside the polished mahogany door of one of these, wondering exactly what excuse he was going to give to the girl for making a call so late at night. And that she needed some explanation was clear from the frank suspicion which showed in her face when she opened the door to him.  \"Yes, I am Miss Rider,\" she said.  \"Can I see you for a few moments?\"  \"I'm sorry,\" she said, shaking her head, \"but I am alone in the flat, so I can't ask you to come in.\"  This was a bad beginning.  \"Is it not possible for you to come out?\" he asked anxiously, and in spite of herself, she smiled.  \"I'm afraid it's quite impossible for me to go out with somebody I have never met before,\" she said, with just a trace of amusement in her eyes.  \"I recognise the difficulty,\" laughed Tailing. \"Here is one of my cards. I'm afraid I am not very famous in this country, so you will not know my name.\"  She took the card and read it.  \"A private detective?\" she said in a troubled voice. \"Who has sent you? Not Mr.----\"  \"Not Mr. Lyne,\" he said.  She hesitated a moment, then threw open the door wider.  \"You must come in. We can talk here in the hall. Do I understand Mr. Lyne has not sent you?\"  \"Mr. Lyne was very anxious that I should come,\" he said. \"I am betraying his confidence, but I do not think that he has any claim upon my loyalty. I don't know why I've bothered you at all, except that I feel that you ought to be put on your guard.\"  \"Against what?\" she asked.  \"Against the machinations of a gentleman to whom you have been----\" he hesitated for a word.  \"Very offensive,\" she finished for him.  \"I don't know how offensive you've been,\" he laughed, \"but I gather you have annoyed Mr. Lyne for some reason or other, and that he is determined to annoy you. I do not ask your confidence in this respect, because I realise that you would hardly like to tell me. But what I want to tell you is this, that Mr. Lyne is probably framing up a charge against you--that is to say,"]]]
