It was known beforehand that the monarchs were to be crowned laureates; but when the show was over, and an honest man was suffered to depart quietly, he took out his laughter which he had stifled, with a firm resolution never more to see an emperor's play, though he had been ten years a-making it.  In the meantime the true poets were they who made the best markets:  for they had wit enough to yield the prize with a good grace, and not contend with him who had thirty legions.  They were sure to be rewarded, if they confessed themselves bad writers, and that was somewhat better than to be martyrs for their reputation.  Lucan's example was enough to teach them manners; and after he was put to death, for overcoming Nero, the emperor carried it without dispute for the best poet in his dominions. No man was ambitious of that grinning honour; for if he heard the malicious trumpeter proclaiming his name before his betters, he knew there was but one way with him.  Maecenas took another course, and we know he was more than a great man, for he was witty too:  But finding himself far gone in poetry, which Seneca assures us was not his talent, he thought it his best way to be well with Virgil and with Horace; that at least he might be a poet at the second hand; and we see how happily it has succeeded with him; for his own bad poetry is forgotten, and their panegyrics of him still remain.  But they who should be our patrons are for no such expensive ways to fame; they have much of the poetry of Maecenas, but little of his liberality. They are for prosecuting Horace and Virgil, in the persons of their successors; for such is every man who has any part of their soul and fire, though in a less degree.  Some of their little zanies yet go further; for they are persecutors even of Horace himself, as far as they are able, by their ignorant and vile imitations of him; by making an unjust use of his authority, and turning his artillery against his friends.  But how would he disdain to be copied by such hands!  I dare answer for him, he would be more uneasy in their company, than he was with Crispinus, their forefather, in the Holy Way; and would no more have allowed them a place amongst the critics, than he would Demetrius the mimic, and Tigellius the buffoon;       ------- Demetri, teque, Tigelli,      Discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras.  With what scorn would he look down on such miserable translators, who make doggerel of his Latin, mistake his meaning, misapply his censures, and often contradict their own?  He is fixed as a landmark to set out the bounds of poetry--       ------- Saxum antiquum, ingens,--      Limes agro positus, litem ut discerneret arvis.  But other arms than theirs, and other sinews are required, to raise the weight of such an author; and when they would toss him against enemies--       Genua labant, gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis.      Tum lapis ipse viri, vacuum per inane volatus,      Nec spatium evasit totum, nec pertulit ictum.  For my part, I would wish no other revenge, either for myself, or the rest of the poets, from this rhyming judge of the twelve-penny gallery, this legitimate son of Sternhold, than that he would subscribe his name to his censure, or (not to tax him beyond his learning) set his mark:  For, should he own himself publicly, and come from behind the lion's skin, they whom he condemns would be thankful to him, they whom he praises would choose to be condemned; and the magistrates, whom he has elected, would modestly withdraw from their employment, to avoid the scandal of his nomination. The sharpness of his satire, next to himself, falls most heavily on his friends, and they ought never to forgive him for commending them perpetually the wrong way, and sometimes by contraries.  If he have a friend, whose hastiness in writing is his greatest fault, Horace would have taught him to have minced the matter, and to have called it readiness of thought, and a flowing fancy; for friendship will allow a man to christen an imperfection by the name of some neighbour virtue--       Vellem in amicitia sic erraremus; et isti      Errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.  But he would never allowed him to have called a slow man hasty, or a hasty writer a slow drudge, as Juvenal explains it--       ------- Canibus pigris, scabieque vestusta      Laevibus, et siccae lambentibus ora lucernae,      Nomen erit, Pardus, Tigris, Leo; si quid adhuc est      Quod fremit in terris violentius.  Yet Lucretius laughs at a foolish lover, even for excusing the imperfections of his mistress--       Nigra <melichroos> est, immunda et foetida <akosmos>      Balba loqui non quit, <traylizei>; muta pudens est, etc.  But to drive it ad Aethiopem cygnum is not to be endured.  I leave him to interpret this by the benefit of his French version on the other side, and without further considering him, than I have the rest of my illiterate censors, whom I have disdained to answer, because they are not qualified for judges.  It remains that I acquiant the reader, that I have endeavoured in this play to follow the practice of the ancients, who, as Mr. Rymer has judiciously observed, are and ought to be our masters.  Horace likewise gives it for a rule in his art of poetry--       ------- Vos exemplaria Graeca      Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.  Yet, though their models are regular, they are too little for English tragedy; which requires to be built in a larger compass.  I could give an instance in the Oedipus Tyrannus, which was the masterpiece of Sophocles; but I reserve it for a more fit occasion, which I hope to have hereafter.  In my style, I have professed to imitate the divine Shakespeare; which that I might perform more freely, I have disencumbered myself from rhyme.  Not that I condemn my former way, but that this is more proper to my present purpose.  I hope I need not to explain myself, that I have not copied my author servilely: Words and phrases must of necessity receive a change in succeeding ages; but it is almost a miracle that much of his language remains so pure; and that he who began dramatic poetry amongst us, untaught by any, and as Ben Jonson tells us, without learning, should by the force of his own genius perform so much, that in a manner he has left no praise for any who come after him.  The occasion is fair, and the subject would be pleasant to handle the difference of styles betwixt him and Fletcher, and wherein, and how far they are both to be imitated.  But since I must not be over-confident of my own performance after him, it will be prudence in me to be silent. Yet, I hope, I may affirm, and without vanity, that, by imitating him, I have excelled myself throughout the play; and particularly, that I prefer the scene betwixt Antony and Ventidius in the first act, to anything which I have written in this kind.     PROLOGUE    What flocks of critics hover here to-day,   As vultures wait on armies for their prey,   All gaping for the carcase of a play!   With croaking notes they bode some dire event,   And follow dying poets by the scent.   Ours gives himself for gone; y' have watched your time:   He fights this day unarmed,--without his rhyme;--   And brings a tale which often has been told;   As sad as Dido's; and almost as old.   His hero, whom you wits his bully call,   Bates of his mettle, and scarce rants at all;   He's somewhat lewd; but a well-meaning mind;   Weeps much; fights little; but is wond'rous kind.   In short, a pattern, and companion fit,   For all the keeping Tonies of the pit.   I could name more:  a wife, and mistress too;   Both (to be plain) too good for most of you:   The wife well-natured, and the mistress true.     Now, poets, if your fame has been his care,   Allow him all the candour you can spare.   A brave man scorns to quarrel once a day;   Like Hectors in at every petty fray.   Let those find fault whose wit's so very small,   They've need to show that they can think at all;   Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow;   He who would search for pearls, must dive below.   Fops may have leave to level all they can;   As pigmies would be glad to lop a man.   Half-wits are fleas; so little and so light,   We scarce could know they live, but that they bite.   But, as the rich, when tired with daily feasts,   For change, become their next poor tenant's guests;   Drink hearty draughts of ale from plain brown bowls,   And snatch the homely rasher from the coals:   So you, retiring from much better cheer,   For once, may venture to do penance here.   And since that plenteous autumn now is past,   Whose grapes and peaches have indulged your taste,   Take in good part, from our poor poet's board,   Such rivelled fruits as winter can afford.

Portents and prodigies have grown so frequent,   That they have lost their name.  Our fruitful Nile   Flowed ere the wonted season, with a torrent   So unexpected, and so wondrous fierce,   That the wild deluge overtook the haste   Even of the hinds that watched it:  Men and beasts   Were borne above the tops of trees, that grew   On the utmost margin of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2062"],["title","All for Love; Or, The World Well Lost: A Tragedy (#4)"],["body","ter-mark.   Then, with so swift an ebb the flood drove backward,   It slipt from underneath the scaly herd:   Here monstrous phocae panted on the shore;   Forsaken dolphins there with their broad tails,   Lay lashing the departing waves:  hard by them,   Sea horses floundering in the slimy mud,   Tossed up their heads, and dashed the ooze about them.         Enter ALEXAS behind them    MYRIS.  Avert these omens, Heaven!    SERAPION.  Last night, between the hours of twelve and one,   In a lone aisle of the temple while I walked,   A whirlwind rose, that, with a violent blast,   Shook all the dome:  the doors around me clapt;   The iron wicket, that defends the vault,   Where the long race of Ptolemies is laid,   Burst open, and disclosed the mighty dead.   From out each monument, in order placed,   An armed ghost starts up:  the boy-king last   Reared his inglorious head.  A peal of groans   Then followed, and a lamentable voice   Cried, Egypt is no more!  My blood ran back,   My shaking knees against each other knocked;   On the cold pavement down I fell entranced,   And so unfinished left the horrid scene.    ALEXAS.  And dreamed you this? or did invent the story,        [Showing himself.]   To frighten our Egyptian boys withal,   And train them up, betimes, in fear of priesthood?    SERAPION.  My lord, I saw you not,   Nor meant my words should reach you ears; but what   I uttered was most true.    ALEXAS.  A foolish dream,   Bred from the fumes of indigested feasts,   And holy luxury.    SERAPION.  I know my duty:   This goes no further.    ALEXAS.  'Tis not fit it should;   Nor would the times now bear it, were it true.   All southern, from yon hills, the Roman camp   Hangs o'er us black and threatening like a storm   Just breaking on our heads.    SERAPION.  Our faint Egyptians pray for Antony;   But in their servile hearts they own Octavius.    MYRIS.  Why then does Antony dream out his hours,   And tempts not fortune for a noble day,   Which might redeem what Actium lost?    ALEXAS.  He thinks 'tis past recovery.    SERAPION.  Yet the foe   Seems not to press the siege.    ALEXAS.  Oh, there's the wonder.   Maecenas and Agrippa, who can most   With Caesar, are his foes.  His wife Octavia,   Driven from his house, solicits her revenge;   And Dolabella, who was once his friend,   Upon some private grudge, now seeks his ruin:   Yet still war seems on either side to sleep.    SERAPION.  'Tis strange that Antony, for some days past,   Has not beheld the face of Cleopatra;   But here, in Isis' temple, lives retired,   And makes his heart a prey to black despair.    ALEXAS.  'Tis true; and we much fear he hopes by absence   To cure his mind of love.    SERAPION.  If he be vanquished,   Or make his peace, Egypt is doomed to be   A Roman province; and our plenteous harvests   Must then redeem the scarceness of their soil.   While Antony stood firm, our Alexandria   Rivalled proud Rome (dominion's other seat),   And fortune striding, like a vast Colossus,   Could fix an equal foot of empire here.    ALEXAS.  Had I my wish, these tyrants of all nature,   Who lord it o'er mankind, rhould perish,--perish,   Each by the other's sword; But, since our will   Is lamely followed by our power, we must   Depend on one; with him to rise or fall.    SERAPION.  How stands the queen affected?    ALEXAS.  Oh, she dotes,   She dotes, Serapion, on this vanquished man,   And winds herself about his mighty ruins;   Whom would she yet forsake, yet yield him up,   This hunted prey, to his pursuer's hands,   She might preserve us all:  but 'tis in vain--   This changes my designs, this blasts my counsels,   And makes me use all means to keep him here.   Whom I could wish divided from her arms,   Far as the earth's deep centre.  Well, you know   The state of things; no more of your ill omens   And black prognostics; labour to confirm   The people's hearts.         Enter VENTIDIUS, talking aside with a Gentleman of ANTONY'S    SERAPION.  These Romans will o'erhear us.   But who's that stranger?  By his warlike port,   His fierce demeanour, and erected look,   He's of no vulgar note.    ALEXAS.  Oh, 'tis Ventidius,   Our emperor's great lieutenant in the East,   Who first showed Rome that Parthia could be conquered.   When Antony returned from Syria last,   He left this man to guard the Roman frontiers.    SERAPION.  You seem to know him well.    ALEXAS.  Too well.  I saw him at Cilicia first,   When Cleopatra there met Antony:   A mortal foe was to us, and Egypt.   But,--let me witness to the worth I hate,--   A braver Roman never drew a sword;   Firm to his prince, but as a friend, not slave,   He ne'er was of his pleasures; but presides   O'er all his cooler hours, and morning counsels:   In short the plainness, fierceness, rugged virtue,   Of an old true-stampt Roman lives in him.   His coming bodes I know not what of ill   To our affairs.  Withdraw to mark him better;   And I'll acquaint you why I sought you here,   And what's our present work.        [They withdraw to a corner of the stage; and VENTIDIUS,         with the other, comes forward to the front.]    VENTIDIUS.  Not see him; say you?   I say, I must, and will.    GENTLEMAN.  He has commanded,   On pain of death, none should approach his presence.    VENTIDIUS.  I bring him news will raise his drooping spirits,   Give him new life.    GENTLEMAN.  He sees not Cleopatra.    VENTIDIUS.  Would he had never seen her!    GENTLEMAN.  He eats not, drinks not, sleeps not, has no use   Of anything, but thought; or if he talks,   'Tis to himself, and then 'tis perfect raving:   Then he defies the world, and bids it pass,   Sometimes he gnaws his lips, and curses loud   The boy Octavius; then he draws his mouth   Into a scornful smile, and cries, \"Take all,   The world's not worth my care.\"    VENTIDIUS.  Just, just his nature.   Virtue's his path; but sometimes 'tis too narrow   For his vast soul; and then he starts out wide,   And bounds into a vice, that bears him far   From his first course, and plunges him in ills:   But, when his danger makes him find his faults,   Quick to observe, and full of sharp remorse,   He censures eagerly his own misdeeds,   Judging himself with malice to himself,   And not forgiving what as man he did,   Because his other parts are more than man.--   He must not thus be lost.        [ALEXAS and the Priests come forward.]    ALEXAS.  You have your full instructions, now advance,   Proclaim your orders loudly.    SERAPION.  Romans, Egyptians, hear the queen's command.   Thus Cleopatra bids:  Let labour cease;   To pomp and triumphs give this happy day,   That gave the world a lord:  'tis Antony's.   Live, Antony; and Cleopatra live!   Be this the general voice sent up to heaven,   And every public place repeat this echo.    VENTIDIUS.  Fine pageantry!        [Aside.]    SERAPION.  Set out before your doors   The images of all your sleeping fathers,   With laurels crowned; with laurels wreath your posts,   And strew with flowers the pavement; let the priests   Do present sacrifice; pour out the wine,   And call the gods to join with you in gladness.    VENTIDIUS.  Curse on the tongue that bids this general joy!   Can they be friends of Antony, who revel   When Antony's in danger?  Hide, for shame,   You Romans, your great grandsires' images,   For fear their souls should animate their marbles,   To blush at their degenerate progeny.    ALEXAS.  A love, which knows no bounds, to Antony,   Would mark the day with honours, when all heaven   Laboured for him, when each propitious star   Stood wakeful in his orb, to watch that hour   And shed his better influence.  Her own birthday   Our queen neglected like a vulgar fate,   That passed obscurely by.    VENTIDIUS.  Would it had slept,   Divided far from his; till some remote   And future age had called it out, to ruin   Some other prince, not him!    ALEXAS.  Your emperor,   Though grown unkind, would be more gentle, than   To upbraid my queen for loving him too well.    VENTIDIUS.  Does the mute sacrifice upbraid the priest!   He knows him not his executioner.   Oh, she has decked his ruin with her love,   Led him in golden bands to gaudy slaughter,   And made perdition pleasing:  She has left him   The blank of what he was.   I tell thee, eunuch, she has quite unmanned him.   Can any Roman see, and know him now,   Thus altered from the lord of half mankind,   Unbent, unsinewed, made a woman's toy,   Shrunk from the vast extent of all his honours,   And crampt within a corner of the world?   O Antony!   Thou bravest soldier, and thou best of friends!   Bounteous as nature; next to nature's God!   Couldst thou but make new worlds, so wouldst thou give them,   As bounty were thy being! rough in battle,   As the first Romans when they went to war;   Yet after victory more pitiful   Than all their praying virgins left at home!    ALEXAS.  Would you could add, to those more shining virtues,   His truth to her who loves him.    VENTIDIUS.  Would I could not!   But wherefore waste I precious hours with thee!   Thou art her darling mischief, her chief engine,   Antony's other fate.  Go, tell thy queen,   Ventidius is arrived, to end her charms.   Let your Egyptian timbrels play alone,   Nor mix effeminate sounds with Roman trumpets,   You dare not fight for Antony; go pray   And keep your cowards' holiday in temples.        [Exeunt ALEXAS, SERAPION.]         Re-enter the Gentleman of M. ANTONY    2 Gent.  The emperor approaches, and commands,   On pain of death, that none presume to stay.    1 Gent.  I dare not disobey him.        [Going out with the other.]    VENTIDIUS.  Well, I dare.   But I'll observe him first unseen, and find   Which way his humour drives:  The rest I'll venture.        [Withdraws.]         Enter ANTONY, walking with a disturbed motion before        he speaks    ANTONY.  They tell me, 'tis my birthday, and I'll keep it   With double pomp of sadness.   'Tis what the day deserves, which gave"]]]
