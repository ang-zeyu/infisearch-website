Neither he nor old Mr. Crow could understand it.     XXII  THE UNWELCOME GUEST   Ferdinand Frog did not like Timothy Turtle. But he always said he thought Mr. Turtle could be _trusted_.  \"You can _depend_ on him,\" Mr. Frog often remarked. \"Yes, you can depend on him to grab you if he ever gets a chance.\"  And all the rest of the musical Frog family agreed with him.  It is not surprising, therefore, that they never invited Timothy Turtle to attend their singing parties in Cedar Swamp. It made no difference how much Timothy Turtle hinted. Though he frequently took pains to tell Ferdinand Frog how fond he was of music, Mr. Frog never once asked him to come to a concert.  In private Mr. Frog and his friends often spoke of Mr. Turtle--and giggled. And one of the Frog family even made up a song about Timothy Turtle, which the whole company loved to chant in Cedar Swamp, safe--as they thought--from Timothy's snapping jaws.  But one fine summer's evening they had a great surprise. They had scarcely begun their nightly concert when Timothy Turtle appeared, out of the water and crawled upon an old stump, right in their midst.  \"Good evening!\" he cried. \"I was just passing on my way home; and hearing the singing, I thought I'd stop and enjoy it.\"  For a few moments none of the Frog family said a word. And then Ferdinand Frog spoke up and asked Mr. Turtle a question:  \"Have you had your dinner?\"  \"No, I haven't,\" Timothy answered. \"But you needn't trouble yourselves on my account. Go on with your singing. And if I feel faint no doubt I can find a bite to eat hereabouts.\"  Now, Mr. Turtle hoped that his speech would put the singers quite at their ease. But they looked at one another and rolled their eyes as if to say, \"This Timothy Turtle is a dangerous person. Look out for him!\"  At the same time they did not wish to appear frightened. And Ferdinand Frog's mother's uncle even made a short speech, saying that he hoped Mr. Turtle would enjoy the singing half as much as everybody else enjoyed his company.  He was about to make some further remark. But no one knew what. For Timothy Turtle wheeled about to look at the old gentleman. And the moment Timothy moved, Ferdinand Frog's mother's uncle jumped hastily into the water from the hummock where he had been sitting, and swam away.  The rest of the company then sang a song. And their listener said that he had never heard anything like it.  \"I wish you'd sing it again,\" he said, \"with your mouths open and your eyes shut.\"  But the musical Frog family objected that they were not used to singing in that fashion.  \"Why don't you keep your own eyes shut?\" Ferdinand Frog asked Mr. Turtle. \"Then you wouldn't know whether ours were open or closed.\"  \"Let us _all_ shut our eyes!\" Timothy Turtle then suggested. And when the Frog family began another song, a few of the younger and more foolish singers followed Mr. Turtle's advice.  So, too, did Mr. Turtle himself--_for a few moments_.  But he soon opened his eyes slyly. And he became very angry when he saw that most of the singers were watching him.  \"You aren't doing as I asked you!\" he shouted.     XXIII  A MERRY SONG   Timothy Turtle made such a noise that the Frog family had to stop singing.  \"It's not fair!\" he cried. \"You're peeping!\"  \"Well, so are you!\" Ferdinand Frog retorted.  \"I only opened my eyes to make sure that you were doing as I asked you to,\" Mr. Turtle replied with an injured air.  \"And we didn't shut ours, because we wanted to watch _you_,\" said Mr. Frog.  \"Can't you trust me?\" Timothy snapped.  \"Certainly!\" Ferdinand Frog replied.  \"Oh, yes! We can trust you!\" And he winked at his friends.  \"You don't want to hurt my feelings, do you?\" Timothy Turtle went on.  \"No, indeed!\" everybody exclaimed.  And then Ferdinand Frog told Timothy that they would sing a special song in his honor.  \"Fire away!\" Timothy ordered them. And the whole company knew, when he said that, that if he really cared anything at all for singing he never would have spoken of it in that fashion.  They were just about to begin the song when Timothy Turtle stopped them.  \"What's this thing called?\" he demanded.  \"It's known,\" Ferdinand Frog explained, \"as 'A Merry Song.'\"  And then the whole Frog family began to bellow their loudest:      Come let us sing a merry song!      To you it may sound sad.     And if you think it loud and long      _We_ think that it's not bad.      \"We'll sing about a grumpy one      Who snaps and bites all day.     And if you call that \"having fun\"      We make reply, \"Go 'way!\"      He has a glittering, wicked eye      And also cruel jaws.     And if you ask the reason why,      We'll answer you, _\"Because!\"_      He'll stretch his neck and grab you quick--      Don't let him come too near!     And if you poke him with a stick      He'll seize that too--oh, dear!      Now, we'll admit he swims quite well      And that he's slow ashore.     Don't ask us if he wears a shell      Until we tell you more.      Don't ask us if he's fond of fish      Nor seek to learn his age.     And kindly don't express a wish      To see him in a rage!      Don't ask us if his claws are strong      And if he has a tail.     It might be short and blunt, or long      And pointed like a nail.      We do not want to cause you pain.      We would not give offense--     But, sir, you'll not come here again      If you have any sense.  After the last echo of the song had lost itself in the depths of Cedar Swamp, the singers all turned, smiling, to their listener.  But his face wore no smile. On the contrary, Timothy Turtle frowned darkly.  \"You can't fool me!\" he cried. \"You don't like me! You don't want me here!\"  Ferdinand Frog swallowed a few times.  \"Well,\" said he, \"of course my manners are so elegant that I simply _couldn't_ dispute one of my elders. And anyhow, Mr. Turtle, you'd find that our singing sounded twice as well if you were half a mile away.\"  \"It certainly couldn't sound any worse than it does here,\" Timothy Turtle declared--a remark which made the Frog family grin broadly.  He said no more, but slipped into the water and struck out towards home.  There was a lively scattering of those who found themselves in Timothy Turtle's path. And for a time it looked as if the singing party had broken up in disorder.  But after a while everybody came back again--that is, everybody but Timothy Turtle. He hurried away and spent most of the whole night buried in the mud at the bottom of Black Creek. For even until daybreak that merry song came floating now and then across Pleasant Valley.  And Timothy Turtle did not like it. He thought it not only loud and long, but most unpleasant as well.

A HALF STORY.   When La Motte Cadillac first sailed up the Strait of Detroit he kept his impressions for after travelers and historians, by transcribing them in his journal. It was not only the romantic side, but the usefulness of the position that appealed to him, commanding the trade from Canada to the Lakes, \"and a door by which we can go in and out to trade with all our allies.\" The magnificent scenery charmed the intrepid explorer. The living crystal waters of the lakes, the shores green with almost tropical profusion, the natural orchards bending their branches with fruit, albeit in a wild state, the bloom, the riotous, clinging vines trailing about, the great forests dense and dark with kingly trees where birds broke the silence with songs and chatter, and game of all kinds found a home; the rivers, sparkling with fish and thronged with swans and wild fowl, and blooms of a thousand kinds, made marvelous pictures. The Indian had roamed undisturbed, and built his temporary wigwam in some opening, and on moving away left the place again to solitude.  Beside its beauty was the prospect of its becoming a mart of commerce. But these old discoverers had much enthusiasm, if great ignorance of individual liberty for anyone except the chief rulers. There was a vigorous system of repression by both the King of France and the Church which hampered real advance. The brave men who fought Indians, who struggled against adverse fortunes, who explored the Mississippi valley and planted the nucleus of towns, died one after another. More than half a century later the English, holding the substantial theory of colonization, that a wider liberty was the true soil in which advancement progressed, after the conquest of Canada, opened the lake country to newcomers and abolished the restrictions the Jesuits and the king had laid upon religion.  The old fort at Detroit, all the lake country being ceded, the French relinquishing the magnificent territory that had cost them so much in precious lives already, took on new life. True, the French protested, and many of them went to the West and made new settlements. The most primitive methods were still in vogue. Canoes and row boats were the methods of transportation for the fur trade; there had been no printing press in all New France; the people had followed the Indian expedients in most matters of household supplies. For years there were abortive plots and struggles to recover the country, affiliation with the Indians by both parties, the Pontiac war and numerous smaller skirmishes.  And toward the end of the century began the greatest struggle for liberty America had yet seen. After the war of the Revolution was ended all the country south of the Lakes was ceded to the United Colonies. But for some years England seemed disposed to hold on to Detroit, disbelieving the colonies could ever establish a stable government. As the French had supposed they could reconquer, so the English looked forward to repossession. But Detroit was still largely a French town or settlement, for thus far it had been a military post of importance.  So it might justly be called old this afternoon, as almost two centuries had elapsed since the French had built their huts and made a point for the fur trade, that Jeanne Angelot sat outside the palisade, leaning against the Pani woman who for years had been a slave, from where she did not know herself, except that she had been a child up in the fur country. Madame De Longueil had gone back to France with her family and left the Indian woman to shift for herself in freedom. And then had come a new charge.  The morals of that day were not over-precise. But though the woman had had a husband and two sons, one boy had died in childhood, the other had been taken away by the husband who repudiated her. She was the more ready to mother this child dropped mysteriously into her lap one day by an Indian woman whose tongue she did not understand.  \"Tell it over again,\" said Jeanne with an air of authority, a dainty imperiousness.  She was leaning against one knee, the woman's heels being drawn up close to her body, making a back to the seat of soft turf, and with her small hand thumping the woman's brown one against the other knee.  \"Mam'selle, you have heard it so many times you could tell it yourself in the dark.\"  \"But perhaps I could not tell it in the daylight,\" said the girl, with mischievous laughter that sent musical ripples on the sunny air.  The woman looked amazed.  \"Why should you be better able to do it at night?\"  \"O, you foolish Pani! Why, I might summon the _itabolays_--\"  \"Hush! hush! Do not call upon such things.\"  \"And the _shil loups_, though they cannot talk. And the _windigoes_--\"  \"Mam'selle!\" The Indian woman made as if she would rise in anger and crossed herself.  \"O, Pani, tell the story. Why, it was night you always say. And so I ought to have some night-sight or knowledge. And you were feeling lonely and miserable, and--why, how do you know it was not a _windigo_?\"  \"Child! child! you set one crazy! It was flesh and blood, a squaw with a blanket about her and a great bundle in her arms. And I did not go in the palisade that night. I had come to love Madame and the children, and it was hard to be shoved out homeless, and with no one to care. There is fondness in the Indian blood, Mam'selle.\"  The Indian's voice grew forceful and held a certain dignity. The child patted her hand and pressed it up to her cheek with a caressing touch.  \"The De Bers wanted to buy me, but Madame said no. And Touchas, the Outawa woman, had bidden me to her wigwam. I heard the bell ring and the gates close, and I sat down under this very oak--\"  \"Yes, this is _my_ tree!\" interrupted the girl proudly.  \"I thought it some poor soul who had lost her brave, and she came close up to me, so close I heard the beads and shells on her leggings shake with soft sound. But I could not understand what she said. And when I would have risen she pushed me back with her knee and dropped something heavy in my lap. I screamed, for I knew not what manner of evil spirit it might be. But she pressed it down with her two hands, and the child woke and cried, and reaching up flung its arms around my neck, while the woman flitted swiftly away. And I tried to hush the sobbing little thing, who almost strangled me with her soft arms.\"  \"O Pani!\" The girl sprang up and encircled her again.  \"I felt bewitched. I did not know what to do, but the poor, trembling little thing was alive, though I did not know whether you were human or not, for there are strange shapes that come in the night, and when once they fasten on you--\"  \"They never let go,\" Jeanne laughed gayly. \"And I shall never let go of you, Pani. If I had money I should buy you. Or if I were a man I would get the priest to marry us.\"  \"O Mam'selle, that is sinful! An old woman like me! And no one can be bought to-day.\"  Jeanne gave her another hug. \"And you sat here and held me--\" forwarding the story.  \"I did not dare stir. It grew darker and all the air was sweet with falling dews and the river fragrance, and the leaves rustled together, the stars came out for there was no moon to check them. On the Beaufeit farm they were having a dance. Susanne Beaufeit had been married that noon in St. Anne. The sound of the fiddles came down like strange voices from out the woods and I was that frightened--\"  \"Poor Pani!\" caressing the hand tenderly.  \"Then you stopped sobbing but you had tight hold of my neck. Suddenly I gathered you up and ran with all my might to Touchas' hut. The curtain was up and the fire was burning, and I had grown stiff with cold and just stumbled on the floor, laying you down. Touchas was so amazed.  \"'Whose child is that?' she said. 'Why, your eyes are like moons. Have you seen some evil thing?'\"  \"And you thought me an evil thing, Pani!\" said the child reproachfully.  \"One never can tell. There are strange things,\" and the woman shook her head. \"And Touchas was so queer she would not touch you at first. I unrolled the torn piece of blanket and there you were, a pretty little child with rings of shining black hair, and fair like French babies, but not white like the English. And there was no sign of Indian about you. But you slept and slept. Then we undressed you. There was a name pinned to your clothes, and a locket and chain about your neck and a tiny ring on one finger. And on your thigh were two letters, 'J. A."]]]
