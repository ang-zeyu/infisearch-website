But he has done these things because he was endowed with a memory which enabled him to retain a consciousness of things, and to follow up the stored knowledge, or the accumulated essences of events which materialized in his remarkable works. Would it make any difference if the being which does these wonderful things should be in the form of a dog or a horse? If Red Angel could remember all that is told him, and could thereby do the next day what he had learned the day before, he would compare favorably with many human beings who possess our forms, and are called human beings.\"  No attack was made that night, and the next morning all were relieved at the rest afforded them. The savages had too much respect to venture near the camp, and a consultation was held as to a wise course to follow. The captive was of no use to them, but it would have been inhuman to turn him adrift, so that he should fall into the hands of the besieging party. Eventually he might be of service to them.  The main river to the west of them was fully two hundred feet broad, and the stream which bounded the other side of their position was, at its mouth, over a hundred and fifty feet in width, and it appeared to be entirely too deep to attempt fording.  No doubt the savages knew this, and counted on an easy capture when their provisions should give out. Thus the second day neared its close, and near evening there was an evident addition to the besieging force. A close watch was kept during the night, but no attempt made to force the situation.  This inaction became most monotonous. It was exceedingly trying, and the condition after the third day was now made plain; that they intended to starve them into submission.  During the early part of the evening, the Professor, realizing that something must be done, decided on a novel plan to relieve them of the savages. If, by any possibility, they could get some logs, sufficient to build a raft to help sustain the wagon, he believed the yaks would be able to swim the river and thus take the rafted wagon with them.  The boys, when the idea was broached, were heartily in favor of the scheme. Harry looked at John. \"I only wish we could make our desires known to him.\"  The Professor took John by the hand, and led him to the brink of the river, and then pointing to the stream and to the wagon, and motioning in the direction across the river, he seemed to comprehend the meaning.  When they returned to the wagon, the Professor said to Harry: \"Do you think you and John could cross the stream to the north of us, and find sufficient poles and driftwood for the purpose?\"  Harry jumped at the opportunity. The moon was shining, but was occasionally hidden by clouds. Motioning to John they took their guns and bolos, and at the instance of the Professor, a quantity of rope. Some driftwood had caught at the shore to their left, and this was recovered, and from that a small raft was built sufficient to carry both across the narrowest stream.  To the north of them, less than a quarter of a mile away, was a quantity of small timber, and the Professor suggested that it would be advisable to go a considerable distance so the cutting of the logs would not be heard by their watchers.  They pushed the raft silently across the water, and drew it up for safety, and then stole down to the water's edge to make their way beyond the sight of the savages on the opposite side. All along the shore advantage was taken of every piece of wood available to serve as a floating structure, and when the wood was reached a few of convenient size were selected and cut up into lengths which would enable them to be readily rolled down to the river.  This work occupied them until midnight, and four large trees were thus prepared and lashed together, and one, wading in the water along the beach, using a pole, the other, with the rope, they held it within poling distance of the shore. In this manner the logs and detached pieces were floated down to the mouth of the stream, and having tied the small raft to the stern, it was finally poled across and landed at the water's edge not far from the wagon.  It was fortunate that the water was shallow and that the beach was shelving at this point, as it materially aided in effecting the launching. The moon went down before four o'clock that morning, and the yaks were yoked up and led to the river.  When Harry returned he was surprised at what he saw in their camp. The Professor and George had been at work also. Several uprights had been put up on the side of the wagon facing the besiegers, and over this had been stretched an old canvas and parts of such goods as could be dispensed with, so as to imitate the wagon, as nearly as possible.  Their ramie fiber top was of a light yellowish color, which looked bright in the moonlight. This had been removed and stored in the wagon, so that when the wagon was driven away the sham arrangement did not disclose the disappearance of the vehicle.  The wagon was driven into the water nearly hub deep, and two of the largest logs were then floated in under the axles, and the smaller ones lashed inside, so that the sustaining power of the combined logs, together with the wooden portion of the wagon and body, would be sufficient to sustain their weights.  Harry worked liked a hero, and took personal charge of the handling of the team, which was his especial delight. His presence near the yaks always gave them confidence, and on this occasion he took his position on the pole between them and near the yoke, and thus gently urged them forward.  For twenty-five feet or more the wheels kept on the ground, but soon thereafter the wheels were free, and they were delighted to find that the timbers did not permit the body to go down very low into the water, and this saved their bedding from becoming soaked.  The yaks performed their work nobly. Some months before they had forded the South River, at the time the flagpole for Observation Hill was cut, so they had ample reason to believe that they would be dependable under these circumstances. It did not require much urging on the part of Harry, and the opposite bank was soon reached, and the cattle scrambled up the beach, but were stopped before the wagon emerged from the water so the logs could be cut adrift.  [Illustration: _Fig. 4. The Wagon Raft._]  The passage was made without a single mishap, and all wondered why this plan had not been thought of before.  \"Let us move on into the interior a short distance, so as to deceive them as to our direction. It is conceivable that they may have boats of some kind which they have sent for, and we should, therefore, try to put them off the track.\"  All were now tired and needed rest. They had not slept a moment during the night, and it was not yet daylight. Beyond was an elevation, toward which the Professor directed them. There the wagon could be concealed, and from that point they would also have a view of the future movements of their enemies.  When the sun arose the savages could be seen standing guard over the sham wagon, at their old camp ground, and the boys enjoyed this bit of humor in the extreme. \"I feel so jolly at the trick that I want to go down to the river and laugh at them,\" exclaimed George.  Up to nine o'clock there was no indication that the ruse had been discovered. The Professor was in his happiest mood at the good imitation, and John had an unmistakable smile, and, as the boys' laughter grew more boisterous, he broke into a laugh that actually startled them.  It was no less amusing to the captive. Beyond question it pleased him, but whether on account of his own safety or because of the ludicrous attitude of the besiegers, was beyond their comprehension. In his short captivity he had taken a fancy to the Professor, on whom he kept his eyes constantly. It was evident that more than the usual interest was displayed in watching his movements. From the first there was no sulkiness in the chief, nor did he exhibit any moroseness, or anything which indicated a spirit of revenge.  The kind and simple act of binding his wounds and making him comfortable seemed to amend for everything. Occasionally the Professor would go to him, and examine the wound, and sometimes pat him on the back--actions which he seemed to understand. No doubt the Professor had a motive in all this, as we shall probably see. The boys knew that he understood human nature in all its aspects, and that in this, as in other things, they felt he was merely preparing the way to utilize him in the future.  They were now on the western shore of West River, and when they had their full share of laughter at the deluded enemies, preparations were made for a start. But where to? Directly to the east were the three hostile tribes, and that direction was impossible. The Professor attempted another conversation with the chief. As all were preparing for the start, he pointed to the north, and at this the chief shook his head to indicate disapproval. When he motioned toward the south it was even a more vigorous negative. Here was a dilemma. What did he mean by such peculiar actions?  The start was delayed to give them an opportunity to discuss the evident meaning of their captive. While this was going on Harry's attention was directed to their old camp. Their late enemies had discovered the ruse, and were now rushing to beat down the pretended wagon.  \"See the party on the north side of the river. I suppose that is a scouting party and they found out our little joke,\" and George again burst into laughter at the scene.  The chief was interested now. The party from the north came into view, and after passing up the river for a quarter of a mile or more, dashed across, and came back on the same side of the stream that the late besiegers occupied.  \"See, they are fighting each other. What does"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20753"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys:  The Tribesmen (#8)"],["body","all mean?\"  \"It simply means,\" answered the Professor, \"that the other tribe, or one of the other tribes on the island, sent for reinforcements, and are now taking a hand.\"  The chief was consulted and asked by signs whether the attacking party from the north side was his own people, and he shook his head in the negative. This proved, beyond doubt, that at least three different people inhabited the island to the south and southeast.  \"What puzzles me,\" said the Professor, \"is the fact that our chief opposes our traveling to the north and to the south as well.\"  \"Do you think there are any tribes on this side of the river?\"  \"That is the only inference I can draw from his actions.\"  A battle was in progress in the underbrush beyond the river. The attacking forces were numerically superior, and within an hour had driven their opponents far to the south, and the successful tribe could be plainly seen, as they searched the hills to find the bodies of victims, and to gather the trophies of their victory.  \"We might as well go north on our way home, as directly to the east,\" was the final remark of the Professor.  The boys were actually startled at this sudden announcement. But when he pointed out that their ammunition was very low, owing to the fierce resistance which they had to make, the wisdom of the course appealed to them.  \"I am glad to go,\" was Harry's immediate response, \"because when we come back next time we'll have something that will give the whole lot a better argument than we offered them this time.\"  [Illustration: _Fig. 5. Savage's Hut._]  The yaks started for the north, and the chief's eyes gave a warning look, which they did not heed at that time. They afterwards remembered how portentous that look was. All that day, over broken ground, and a rough, hilly country, the team laboriously made its way. The best that could be done over such a country was two and a half miles an hour.  Late in the afternoon the party were startled on coming in sight of numerous small huts, and a larger hut at one side of the cluster of smaller ones. The approach was so unexpected that in spite of their efforts, the team could not be turned around before their approach was heralded throughout the tribal village.  Here was the first view of the homes of the natives. The huts were very crude, and were devoid of windows, all of them built round with more or less pointed or conical tops.  \"Those huts don't look like the ones we saw to the south on the day we had our first fight,\" was George's opinion.  \"You are correct in that, and if you notice, the people look differently, as well. What is that? I believe they have firearms.\" The Professor's brow gathered, as he said this, because now, that the alarm had been given, the warriors were running to and fro, and among them were several who carried guns.  The wagon was hurriedly put into a posture of defense, and the cattle protected as best they could. They approached cautiously, and the Professor walked forward and held out his hand in token of friendliness. They withdrew a short distance for consultation. This gave the party an opportunity to study the new people.  The first thing noticed was the entire difference in the clothing worn. The other tribes had nothing but the breech clout, but these had other garments, and their skin was darker in color.  \"I am afraid we shall have trouble in a fight with these people, because their guns are first-class make,\" said Harry.  \"You need have no fear of their guns,\" answered the Professor.  The boys looked at him wonderingly, as he continued: \"They may have had ammunition in the past, but it is evident that they have none now. See how the fellows who have the guns carry them. They use them like spears.\"  They finally turned from their conference, and without a word or sign opened hostilities with a volley of arrows. The gage of battle had been thrown down. It was fortunate that the warriors were few in comparison with their last enemies. Not more than twenty were counted as they were waiting for the result of the consultation.  This challenge could not well be misunderstood, and the Professor gave the word to fire. Every shot took effect, and the result was a startling one for the savages. Without waiting for the second round they broke and fled, rushing down past the large hut and through the village, gathering, as they went, the women and children which had previously grouped together to witness the fight. This was too much for the boys, who rushed down after them, followed by John and the Professor, until the large hut was reached.     CHAPTER V  THE RESCUE OF THE CAPTIVE BOYS   The boys were chattering and whooping as they ran, to the immense amusement of the Professor. They had converted themselves into regular American Indians for the occasion, and tried to imitate the yells of the savages who had attacked them the previous day.  Passing the large hut which stood in the foreground, the boys imagined they heard a cry from within. Possibly it was a lure, and the Professor advised them not to be too rash.  \"Here we are; inside the hut; hurrah for the United States.\" The boys looked at each other in amazement. The Professor, too, was puzzled. Cautiously approaching the opening, the Professor called out: \"Who is there!\"  Instantly came the cry from two voices: \"We are American boys who were captured by the savages.\" Nothing more was needed for the impetuosity of George and Harry. With the bolos the enclosure was soon cut away, and they rushed in, but the Professor and John remained outside.  In one corner, and tied to stanchions which had been driven in the ground, were two boys, badly emaciated, and covered with filth and rags. When the ropes that bound them were cut away and assisted to rise they were too weak to stand without support.  \"We are so hungry.\"  \"How long have you been here?\" asked Harry, excitedly.  \"We don't know, but more than two weeks. We were captured by another tribe and in the last fight were taken from the ones who first captured us.\"  \"Come out into the light,\" and Harry and George each put his arms around one of the boys, and as they came out looked at the Professor and John in astonishment too strong for words.  In the excitement they broke down and wept, and well they might. Our boys were touched beyond description, and John went up to them and put his arms around them, and this act so affected Harry and George that they too joined the boys in tears that could not be kept back.  The Professor was moved, as he turned away to hide his feelings, but he recovered, and with a great show of unconcern, exclaimed: \"Back to the wagon, as quickly as possible.\" This brought them to a realization of their position, and Harry and George almost carried the boys toward the wagon, while John and the Professor lingered behind.  He had anticipated the return of the savages, and surmising that a still larger force might be within calling distance, did not consider it prudent to tarry long at that spot. It was well that they did not remain, as the rescued boys informed the Professor that the main body was beyond the ridge, and not more than several miles away unless they were on the warpath.  [Illustration: \"'_Come out into the light,' and Harry and George each put his arms around one of the boys_\" [See p. 62]]  There was no time for many words. When the poor boys reached the wagon another surprise was in store for them, as they gazed on the wounded chief, who was bound in the wagon.  The savages did not go far beyond the village, and this was observed by the Professor, and was the moving cause of his sharp order when the boys were brought out. While Harry and John were engaged in turning the team around, George hurriedly set food before the famished boys, and they were cautioned against taking too much. They were really almost starved, and their appearance plainly showed the treatment they had received.  The Professor called out: \"They are coming; have all the guns ready.\" Before they had fully taken all of the food the boys begged to be allowed to assist in the defense, and George was thoughtful enough to recognize the fact that the guns they had were not like the breech-loaders, and without wasting time told the boys how they were manipulated.  \"Where did you get these funny-looking guns?\" asked one of the boys.  \"We made them,\" was the reply, and the boys looked at each other and gasped in surprise.  Beyond, the savages were gathering, and moving forwardly, evidently with a view of attacking. The Professor turned to the boys and asked them whether the natives had guns, and they answered that when they were captured they saw a half dozen old weapons, but had never used them, as, apparently, there was no ammunition. Where the savages obtained them was a mystery. They believed the weapons were used as charms, to aid them against their enemies, and that belief gained ground from the fact that thus far the tribes, in whose territory they now were, had been victorious in every battle that had been fought for the past year.  This was indeed interesting news, and probably the actions of the wounded chief, in appearing to discourage the trip to the north, had some relation to this belief.  The gathering warriors could be seen plainly, coming over the hill, beyond the village, and gathered in a mass near the hut from which the boys had been taken. A conference was in progress, which did not appear to be harmonious, but eventually the party moved forward and divided into three sections, with the view of enveloping the position of the Professor and his party.  \"They will attempt to surround us, and we shall now have to attack them by assaulting one party at a time. As suggested in our previous encounters, the five guns must always be kept as a reserve for the last emergency. Fire and then reload, and we should attack one of the parties at a time, so the greatest execution at any one point will be most likely to cause the greatest"]]]
