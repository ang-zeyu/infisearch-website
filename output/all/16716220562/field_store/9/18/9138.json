An aged clerk appeared.  \"Did the bell ring?\" he asked.  \"I think it did,\" said the Lawyer. \"Be good enough, Atkinson, to fetch me the papers of the estate of the late Major Clair defunct.\"  \"I have them here,\" said the clerk, and he laid upon the table a bundle of faded blue papers, and withdrew.  \"Miss Winnifred,\" resumed the Old Lawyer, \"I will now proceed to give you an account of the disposition that has been made of your property. This first document refers to the sum of two thousand pounds left to you by your great uncle. It is lost.\"  Winnifred bowed.  \"Pray give me your best attention and I will endeavour to explain to you how I lost it.\"  \"Oh, sir,\" cried Winnifred, \"I am only a poor girl unskilled in the ways of the world, and knowing nothing but music and French; I fear that the details of business are beyond my grasp. But if it is lost, I gather that it is gone.\"  \"It is,\" said Mr. Bonehead. \"I lost it in a marginal option in an undeveloped oil company. I suppose that means nothing to you.\"  \"Alas,\" sighed Winnifred, \"nothing.\"  \"Very good,\" resumed the Lawyer. \"Here next we have a statement in regard to the thousand pounds left you under the will of your maternal grandmother. I lost it at Monte Carlo. But I need not fatigue you with the details.\"  \"Pray spare them,\" cried the girl.  \"This final item relates to the sum of fifteen hundred pounds placed in trust for you by your uncle. I lost it on a horse race. That horse,\" added the Old Lawyer with rising excitement, \"ought to have won. He was coming down the stretch like blue--but there, there, my dear, you must forgive me if the recollection of it still stirs me to anger. Suffice it to say the horse fell. I have kept for your inspection the score card of the race, and the betting tickets. You will find everything in order.\"  \"Sir,\" said Winnifred, as Mr. Bonehead proceeded to fold up his papers, \"I am but a poor inadequate girl, a mere child in business, but tell me, I pray, what is left to me of the money that you have managed?\"  \"Nothing,\" said the Lawyer. \"Everything is gone. And I regret to say, Miss Clair, that it is my painful duty to convey to you a further disclosure of a distressing nature. It concerns your birth.\"  \"Just Heaven!\" cried Winnifred, with a woman's quick intuition. \"Does it concern my father?\"  \"It does, Miss Clair. Your father was not your father.\"  \"Oh, sir,\" exclaimed Winnifred. \"My poor mother! How she must have suffered!\"  \"Your mother was not your mother,\" said the Old Lawyer gravely. \"Nay, nay, do not question me. There is a dark secret about your birth.\"  \"Alas,\" said Winnifred, wringing her hands, \"I am, then, alone in the world and penniless.\"  \"You are,\" said Mr. Bonehead, deeply moved. \"You are, unfortunately, thrown upon the world. But, if you ever find yourself in a position where you need help and advice, do not scruple to come to me. Especially,\" he added, \"for advice. And meantime let me ask you in what way do you propose to earn your livelihood?\"  \"I have my needle,\" said Winnifred.  \"Let me see it,\" said the Lawyer.  Winnifred showed it to him.  \"I fear,\" said Mr. Bonehead, shaking his head, \"you will not do much with that.\"  Then he rang the bell again.  \"Atkinson,\" he said, \"take Miss Clair out and throw her on the world.\"     CHAPTER II  A RENCOUNTER   As Winnifred Clair passed down the stairway leading from the Lawyer's office, a figure appeared before her in the corridor, blocking the way. It was that of a tall, aristocratic-looking man, whose features wore that peculiarly saturnine appearance seen only in the English nobility. The face, while entirely gentlemanly in its general aspect, was stamped with all the worst passions of mankind.  Had the innocent girl but known it, the face was that of Lord Wynchgate, one of the most contemptible of the greater nobility of Britain, and the figure was his too.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the dissolute Aristocrat, \"whom have we here? Stay, pretty one, and let me see the fair countenance that I divine behind your veil.\"  \"Sir,\" said Winnifred, drawing herself up proudly, \"let me pass, I pray.\"  \"Not so,\" cried Wynchgate, reaching out and seizing his intended victim by the wrist, \"not till I have at least seen the colour of those eyes and imprinted a kiss upon those fair lips.\"  With a brutal laugh, he drew the struggling girl towards him.  In another moment the aristocratic villain would have succeeded in lifting the veil of the unhappy girl, when suddenly a ringing voice cried, \"Hold! stop! desist! begone! lay to! cut it out!\"  With these words a tall, athletic young man, attracted doubtless by the girl's cries, leapt into the corridor from the street without. His figure was that, more or less, of a Greek god, while his face, although at the moment inflamed with anger, was of an entirely moral and permissible configuration.  \"Save me! save me!\" cried Winnifred.  \"I will,\" cried the Stranger, rushing towards Lord Wynchgate with uplifted cane.  But the cowardly Aristocrat did not await the onslaught of the unknown.  \"You shall yet be mine!\" he hissed in Winnifred's ear, and, releasing his grasp, he rushed with a bound past the rescuer into the street.  \"Oh, sir,\" said Winnifred, clasping her hands and falling on her knees in gratitude. \"I am only a poor inadequate girl, but if the prayers of one who can offer naught but her prayers to her benefactor can avail to the advantage of one who appears to have every conceivable advantage already, let him know that they are his.\"  \"Nay,\" said the stranger, as he aided the blushing girl to rise, \"kneel not to me, I beseech. If I have done aught to deserve the gratitude of one who, whoever she is, will remain for ever present as a bright memory in the breast of one in whose breast such memories are all too few, he is all too richly repaid. If she does that, he is blessed indeed.\"  \"She does. He is!\" cried Winnifred, deeply moved. \"Here on her knees she blesses him. And now,\" she added, \"we must part. Seek not to follow me. One who has aided a poor girl in the hour of need will respect her wish when she tells him that, alone and buffeted by the world, her one prayer is that he will leave her.\"  \"He will!\" cried the Unknown. \"He will. He does.\"  \"Leave me, yes, leave me,\" exclaimed Winnifred.  \"I will,\" said the Unknown.  \"Do, do,\" sobbed the distraught girl. \"Yet stay, one moment more. Let she, who has received so much from her benefactor, at least know his name.\"  \"He cannot! He must not!\" exclaimed the Indistinguishable. \"His birth is such--but enough!\"  He tore his hand from the girl's detaining clasp and rushed forth from the place.  Winnifred Clair was alone.     CHAPTER III  FRIENDS IN DISTRESS   Winnifred was now in the humblest lodgings in the humblest part of London. A simple bedroom and sitting-room sufficed for her wants. Here she sat on her trunk, bravely planning for the future.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the Landlady, knocking at the door, \"do try to eat something. You must keep up your health. See, I've brought you a kippered herring.\"  Winnifred ate the herring, her heart filled with gratitude. With renewed strength"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20633"],["title","Winsome Winnie and other New Nonsense Novels (#1)"],["body"," sallied forth on the street to resume her vain search for employment. For two weeks now Winnifred Clair had sought employment even of the humblest character. At various dress-making establishments she had offered, to no purpose, the services of her needle. They had looked at it and refused it.  In vain she had offered to various editors and publishers the use of her pen. They had examined it coldly and refused it.  She had tried fruitlessly to obtain a position of trust. The various banks and trust companies to which she had applied declined her services. In vain she had advertised in the newspapers offering to take sole charge of a little girl. No one would give her one.  Her slender stock of money which she had in her purse on leaving Mr. Bonehead's office was almost consumed.  Each night the unhappy girl returned to her lodging exhausted with disappointment and fatigue.  Yet even in her adversity she was not altogether friendless.  Each evening, on her return home, a soft tap was heard at the door.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the voice of the Landlady, \"I have brought you a fried egg. Eat it. You must keep up your strength.\"  Then one morning a terrible temptation had risen before her.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the manager of an agency to which she had applied, \"I am glad to be able at last to make you a definite offer of employment. Are you prepared to go upon the stage?\"  The stage!  A flush of shame and indignation swept over the girl. Had it come to this? Little versed in the world as Winnifred was, she knew but too well the horror, the iniquity, the depth of degradation implied in the word.  \"Yes,\" continued the agent, \"I have a letter here asking me to recommend a young lady of suitable refinement to play the part of Eliza in _Uncle Tom's Cabin._ Will you accept?\"  \"Sir,\" said Winnifred proudly, \"answer me first this question fairly. If I go upon the stage, can I, as Eliza, remain as innocent, as simple as I am now?\"  \"You can not,\" said the manager.  \"Then, sir,\" said Winnifred, rising from her chair, \"let me say this. Your offer is doubtless intended to be kind. Coming from the class you do, and inspired by the ideas you are, you no doubt mean well. But let a poor girl, friendless and alone, tell you that rather than accept such a degradation she will die.\"  \"Very good,\" said the manager.  \"I go forth,\" cried Winnifred, \"to perish.\"  \"All right,\" said the manager.  The door closed behind her. Winnifred Clair, once more upon the street, sank down upon the steps of the building in a swoon.  But at this very juncture Providence, which always watches over the innocent and defenceless, was keeping its eye direct upon Winnifred.  At that very moment when our heroine sank fainting upon the doorstep, a handsome equipage, drawn by two superb black steeds, happened to pass along the street.  Its appearance and character proclaimed it at once to be one of those vehicles in which only the superior classes of the exclusive aristocracy are privileged to ride. Its sides were emblazoned with escutcheons, insignia and other paraphernalia. The large gilt coronet that appeared up its panelling, surmounted by a bunch of huckleberries, quartered in a field of potatoes, indicated that its possessor was, at least, of the rank of marquis. A coachman and two grooms rode in front, while two footmen, seated in the boot, or box at the rear, contrived, by the immobility of their attitude and the melancholy of their faces, to inspire the scene with an exclusive and aristocratic grandeur.  The occupants of the equipage--for we refuse to count the menials as being such--were two in number, a lady and gentleman, both of advanced years. Their snow-white hair and benign countenances indicated that they belonged to that rare class of beings to whom rank and wealth are but an incentive to nobler things. A gentle philanthropy played all over their faces, and their eyes sought eagerly in the passing scene of the humble street for new objects of benefaction.  Those acquainted with the countenances of the aristocracy would have recognized at once in the occupants of the equipage the Marquis of Muddlenut and his spouse, the Marchioness.  It was the eye of the Marchioness which first detected the form of Winnifred Clair upon the doorstep.  \"Hold! pause! stop!\" she cried, in lively agitation.  The horses were at once pulled in, the brakes applied to the wheels, and with the aid of a powerful lever, operated by three of the menials, the carriage was brought to a standstill.  \"See! Look!\" cried the Marchioness. \"She has fainted. Quick, William, your flask. Let us hasten to her aid.\"  In another moment the noble lady was bending over the prostrate form of Winnifred Clair, and pouring brandy between her lips.  Winnifred opened her eyes. \"Where am I?\" she asked feebly.  \"She speaks!\" cried the Marchioness. \"Give her another flaskful.\"  After the second flask the girl sat up.  \"Tell me,\" she cried, clasping her hands, \"what has happened? Where am I?\"  \"With friends!\" answered the Marchioness. \"But do not essay to speak. Drink this. You must husband your strength. Meantime, let us drive you to your home.\"  Winnifred was lifted tenderly by the menservants into the aristocratic equipage. The brake was unset, the lever reversed, and the carriage thrown again into motion.  On the way Winnifred, at the solicitation of the Marchioness, related her story.  \"My poor child!\" exclaimed the lady, \"how you must have suffered. Thank Heaven it is over now. To-morrow we shall call for you and bring you away with us to Muddlenut Chase.\"  Alas, could she but have known it, before the morrow should dawn, worse dangers still were in store for our heroine. But what these dangers were, we must reserve for another chapter.     CHAPTER IV  A GAMBLING PARTY IN ST. JAMES'S CLOSE   We must now ask our readers to shift the scene--if they don't mind doing this for us--to the apartments of the Earl of Wynchgate in St. James's Close. The hour is nine o'clock in the evening, and the picture before us is one of revelry and dissipation so characteristic of the nobility of England. The atmosphere of the room is thick with blue Havana smoke such as is used by the nobility, while on the green baize table a litter of counters and cards, in which aces, kings, and even two spots are heaped in confusion, proclaim the reckless nature of the play.  Seated about the table are six men, dressed in the height of fashion, each with collar and white necktie and broad white shirt, their faces stamped with all, or nearly all, of the baser passions of mankind.  Lord Wynchgate--for he it was who sat at the head of the table--rose with an oath, and flung his cards upon the table.  All turned and looked at him, with an oath. \"Curse it, Dogwood,\" he exclaimed, with another oath, to the man who sat beside him. \"Take the money. I play no more to-night. My luck is out.\"  \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Lord Dogwood, with a third oath, \"your mind is not on the cards. Who is the latest young beauty, pray, who so absorbs you? I hear a whisper in town of a certain misadventure of yours----\"  \"Dogwood,\" said Wynchgate, clenching his fist, \"have a care, man, or you shall measure the length of my sword.\"  Both noblemen faced each other, their hands upon their swords.  \"My lords, my lords!\" pleaded a distinguished-looking man of more advanced years, who sat at one side of the table, and in whose features the habitués of diplomatic circles would have recognized the handsome lineaments of the Marquis of Frogwater, British Ambassador to Siam, \"let us have no quarrelling. Come, Wynchgate, come, Dogwood,\" he continued, with a mild oath, \"put up your swords. It were a shame to waste time in private quarrelling. They may be needed all too soon in Cochin China, or, for the matter of that,\" he added sadly, \"in Cambodia or in Dutch Guinea.\"  \"Frogwater,\" said young Lord Dogwood, with a generous flush, \"I was wrong. Wynchgate, your hand.\"  The two noblemen shook hands.  \"My friends,\" said Lord Wynchgate, \"in asking you to abandon our game, I had an end in view. I ask your help in an affair of the heart.\"  \"Ha! excellent!\" exclaimed the five noblemen. \"We are with you heart and soul.\"  \"I propose this night,\" continued Wynchgate, \"with your help, to carry off a young girl, a female!\"  \"An abduction!\" exclaimed the Ambassador somewhat sternly. \"Wynchgate, I cannot countenance this.\"  \"Mistake me not,\" said the Earl, \"I intend to abduct her. But I propose nothing dishonourable. It is my firm resolve to offer her marriage.\"  \"Then,\" said Lord Frogwater, \"I am with you.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" concluded Wynchgate, \"all is ready. The coach is below. I have provided masks, pistols, and black cloaks. Follow me.\"  A few moments later, a coach, with the blinds drawn, in which were six noblemen armed to the teeth, might have been seen, were it not for the darkness, approaching the humble lodging in which Winnifred Clair was sheltered.  But what it did when it got there, we must leave to another chapter.     CHAPTER V  THE ABDUCTION   The hour was twenty minutes to ten on the evening described in our last chapter.  Winnifred Clair was seated, still fully dressed, at the window of the bedroom, looking out over the great city.  A light tap came at the door.  \"If it's a fried egg,\" called Winnifred softly, \"I do not need it. I ate yesterday.\"  \"No,\" said the voice of the Landlady. \"You are wanted below.\"  \"I!\" exclaimed Winnifred, \"below!\"  \"You,\" said the Landlady, \"below. A party of gentlemen have called for you.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" exclaimed Winnifred, putting her hand to her brow in perplexity, \"for me! at this late hour! Here! This evening! In this house?\"  \"Yes,\" repeated the Landlady, \"six gentlemen. They arrived in a closed coach. They are all closely masked and heavily armed. They beg you will descend at once.\"  \"Just Heaven!\" cried the Unhappy Girl. \"Is it possible that they mean to abduct me?\"  \"They do,\" said the Landlady. \"They said so!\"  \"Alas!\" cried Winnifred, \"I"]]]
