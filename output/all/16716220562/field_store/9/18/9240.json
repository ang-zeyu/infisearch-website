And that car of Juggernaut, and drowning their poor little babies! They do not seem to make much of girl children.\"  \"Indeed, they do not, only as in some families they are wanted for wives. But the devotion of mothers to their sons is wonderful.\"  Rachel had laid aside a silk coat that filled Eunice with a sort of wonder, being brocaded with beautiful leaves and roses that seemed as if they must have been worked by hand, they stood out so clearly. The child appeared fantastically attired to her plainer eyes, and her slim arms were weighted with bracelets. In her dainty ears were some splendid sapphires.  \"I do hope you will soon feel at home,\" Eunice said from a full heart, if there was a rather awkward feeling about it. Yet she liked Miss Winn's face. It had a kindly and intelligent aspect and was medium in all respects. The social lines in the town, indeed in all the Eastern towns, were not sharply defined as to mistress and maid. True, many households preferred black servants; in not a few some elderly relative looked after the household, or a bound-out girl was trained in industrious ways.  There had been some discussion as to what sphere this Miss Winn would occupy. If she was simply the attendant on an over-indulged child, an uneducated person, as many of the English maids were who came over to better their conditions or get husbands, it might be rather awkward. But the woman was certainly well-bred and used her English in a correct manner.  \"Perhaps you will get to feeling more at home if you come down to the sitting-room, since there is nothing to unpack;\" with a faint smile.  Cynthia had been looking out of the window. \"How queer it all is!\" she said. \"I think I do not quite like it. And how funny one feels. I want to go this way;\" and she swayed from side to side.  \"The motion of the vessel,\" interposed Rachel. \"I have heard it took days to get over it.\"  Meanwhile, downstairs Elizabeth had studied her Cousin Chilian.  \"The child is not at all pretty,\" she began rather sharply. \"And her mother was considered a beautiful young woman, I believe.\"  \"Yes; but a long voyage and shipboard living may not be conducive to the development of beauty. And children seldom are at that age.\"  \"The Goodell children are pretty, I am sure, with their fine complexions. And the Bates girls. She has a furtive sort of look. Oh, I hope she isn't deceitful and untrue. Those heathen nations, I believe, are given largely to falsehood, and she has lived among them so long without any mother's care. It seems as if a pretty girl like Alletta Orne might have found some one at home to marry and reared her child in a Christian land.\"  \"Do not let us begin by borrowing trouble. It always comes fast enough.\"  \"And I can foresee that we shall have plenty of it. Well, I suppose it must be endured. There! my bread is light enough to go in the oven--running over, likely as not.\"  So, when they came downstairs, Miss Elizabeth was in the kitchen, immersed in her baking interest.  A large gray cat lay curled up on a cushion. Cynthia went straight over to it, but it glanced at her with wild eyes, jumped down, and disappeared through the doorway.  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed in accents of disappointment, glancing up at Chilian.  \"Pussy is not used to children. He always runs away from them. But I think he will like you when he gets acquainted.\"  She turned to the window with a swelling heart. It seemed so cold and strange. It was better on shipboard, she thought. She had come to know the sailors quite well and Missy had grown to be a great favorite with them. There was always something cheerful going on. They sang songs in their loud clear voices, or whistled merry tunes. They danced as well. She was quite used to the dancing-girls at Calcutta, and when they were at Hong Kong or other ports. But the Indian girls pleased her best.  The sailors seemed always full of fun, even in the worst of times. During some fearful storms she was safely housed in the cabin, and it amused her to see the things pitch and roll as far as their chains would allow them. Sometimes, too, they had to hold the food in their hands, but she never knew the danger of the worst storms. Rachel would not admit that she was afraid, and the captain said, \"Yes, we're having a stiff blow, but the _Flying Star_ has weathered many a gale before.\" And here it was so very quiet. It looked dreary outside, with the leafless trees. She liked the toss and tumult of the waves with their snowy, jewelled crests, and the clouds scudding along the sky, which she imagined was another sea full of ships. Often they went in port and there was nothing left but the blue sky above--a great hollow vault. And when the sun shone the real sea and ocean was in flames of such splendid colors. There was no end of curious people at ports where they stopped for supplies, there was always something strange, even when they were days alone on the water. For the sunset and sunrise were never twice alike. Then the moon from its tiny crescent to the great round globe that illumined the world with her fairy richness and scattered jewels on every crested wave. She had watched it turn the other way and grow smaller and smaller until you saw it vaguely in the morning.  She was so interested in the stories they told about it, the signs and wonders they ascribed to it.  \"And was it ever a real world like that we have left behind?\" she asked of the captain. \"Were there people in it? And land, and rivers, and growing things, and flowers?\" and her wondering eyes grew larger.  \"No one can tell now. Some astronomers believe it a burned-out world and the things we take for a man,\" laughing, \"and the cow ready to jump off, are remnants of roads, and forests, and mountains.\"  \"You _can_ see the man in the moon,\" she returned decisively. \"Sometimes he laughs. And the cow has great horns. I should be afraid of them if I met such a cow. Ours are so small and tame.\"  \"You will see large ones in Salem. But I think, for the most part, they are gentle.\"  She never wearied talking over the strange things. And so she came to have her head filled with wonderful lore that indeed cropped out now and then all her life long until she felt as if she had really been in fairyland.  It seemed stranger here than on shipboard. The others were going through the ceremony of getting acquainted. Rachel Winn's voice had a soft sound, with an almost foreign accent. Eunice's, though low-pitched, had a clear resonance. Now and then Chilian Leverett made a comment, or asked a question, but she was not heeding them. Her heart and mind had wandered back to her father and that wonderful land where nothing ever seemed bleak, though in long hot droughts it was arid. But there were always temples, and palaces, and picturesque huts, and women and children in gay attire, old men kneeling somewhere, praying but keeping a sharp lookout for alms.  Chilian Leverett had been watching the small face and wondering at the changes passing over it. Now he saw some tears slowly coursing down the pale cheeks, and his heart was moved with infinite pity.  Suddenly a robin alighted on the limb of a tree and began picking at the buds. Then he held his head up straight, swelled out his brownish red breast, and poured forth such a volume of melody that the effort fairly made him dance with joy. Spring had surely come! It was the time of love and joy, and all things made over new.  She turned a trifle. Her face was transfigured with delight. Her eyes shone, though the tears were still wet on her cheek.     CHAPTER III  A STRANGER, YET AT HOME   Rachel Winn settled herself to the new order of things more readily than the Leveretts. Or rather she seemed to take the lead in arrangements for herself and her charge. She was after all a sort of nurse and waiting-maid, though she had a fine dignity about it that even Elizabeth could not gainsay. She was to be one of the family, there could be no objection to that in the simple New England living. Though it was true, times were changing greatly since the days of war and privation, and perhaps the mingling of people from other states, the growing responsibility of being part of a great commonwealth. Servants were being relegated to a different position. Boston in a certain fashion set the pace, though Salem held up her head proudly. Were not her seaports the busy mart of the Eastern shore? Stores of finery, silks and laces, and marvellous Indian embroidery went down to Boston and the houses were enriched with choice china that in the next hundred years was to be handed down as heirlooms. Fine houses were being built, choice woods came from southern ports by vessels that believed they could find fortunes nearer home than China or India. But they could grow no spices, or coffees, or teas, and they must come from the Orient. No looms could turn out such exquisite fabrics as yet, though housewives were to be proud of their home-made drapery for a generation or two.  Chilian spent a large part of that first night inspecting his box of papers. There was a journal-like letter in which Anthony Leverett had jotted down many things he hardly dared say in his letter; indeed, there was not sufficient space. As soon as he had learned the serious nature of his disease, he had begun to put his house in order and consider the future welfare of his child. Some lines touched Chilian deeply, the trust and dependence he was not at all sure he could fulfil, but he felt he _must_ rouse himself to the earnest endeavor. The father had a passionate love for his child, he was making a fortune for her, counting the years when he should return and have a home of his own, when Cynthia would grow up and marry and there would be grandchildren to climb his knees. India was no place for a woman child to grow up in, there were no chances for education or accomplishment, and next to no society. After all there was not, and never"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20722"],["title","A Little Girl in Old Salem (#5)"],["body","be, such a country as the new world that had struggled so long and bravely for her independence, and now had only to go on developing her grand theories. Crowned heads might look on doubtingly, but the foundation had been laid in justice and truth and equality of right. It quite thrilled him that this man, amassing money in a far-away land, could see so clearly and have no doubts about its future greatness.  To Captain Corwin, his good, trusty friend, he had willed half the value of the _Flying Star_. The money from his part was to be invested, as the payments came in, in real estate in Salem, which was to be the shipping mart of the New England coast, at least, and run a race with New York, he thought. So with the stations at Calcutta and Hong Kong in the hands of the Bannings. And there were treasures that would answer for a wedding dowry when the time came. If possible, he would like Rachel Winn retained; he had the highest confidence in her, and she had no relatives to call her back to England. He had given her much of the family history, and described the town and the people, so that it would not seem so new and strange to her.  He was not asking all this as a favor. Chilian was touched by the provision made for himself, which it would be quite impossible to decline, he saw. True it would break in upon his leisurely, student life, yet he felt he could not in honor refuse to accept the trust.  Rachel Winn studied the arrangements of the rooms at their disposal. Her young mistress was not a child taken out of benevolence or relationship. She must have her standing from the very beginning, and she fancied Elizabeth was inclined to consider her a sort of interloper.  \"If it makes no difference, I will take the small room,\" she announced to her. \"There are some pieces of furniture on the vessel that Captain Leverett particularly wished her to keep, and as she grows older she will cherish them----\"  \"That great room for such a child!\" In her amazement, Elizabeth spoke without thought. She was not used to seeing children set in the very forefront. In her day, indeed, yet in some families the large open garret was considered the place for children.  \"You see, she was used to it at home--over there, I mean;\" with a nod of the head. \"Her father's room was one side, mine on the other. Of course, in a way I shall share it with her. I will keep it in order and look after her clothes, and sew for her. But I prefer the smaller one.\"  Elizabeth was aghast. One of the best spare chambers, with the furnishings that had come from England a hundred years before. On the other side she and Eunice shared a plainly appointed room with some of their very own belongings. There was still another, but the closet was small. She had asked Chilian where they should be placed and he had chosen this. It was his house, of course----  Whether it would have ended in a discussion could not to be told, for at that moment a dray drove up with some boxes and a piece of furniture so wrapped and protected that it was quite impossible to guess at its name.  Chilian came out and ran lightly down the stairs; and then called Elizabeth.  \"Where had the boxes better go? They will have to be unpacked, I suppose;\" helplessly.  \"There are more to come,\" announced the man. \"Enough to set up housekeeping, if the right sort of things are in them;\" and he gave a short laugh.  Miss Winn came downstairs. \"Isn't there a garret to the house?\" she asked, looking from one to the other. \"I packed them up, but I can hardly tell----\"  \"Yes; we could store half the vessel's contents in it. Well, not exactly that. A ship's hold is a capacious place. Yes, the boxes might go there. Have you any idea what this is?\"  \"A sort of desk and bookcase. A very handsome thing the captain set great store by.\"  The men shouldered the boxes and Elizabeth convoyed them. Silas was spading up the garden and came at the call.  It was a work of some labor to get the article out of its secure casings. It disclosed a very handsome piece of furniture in the escritoire style, carved and inlaid not only with beautiful woods, but much silver. Chilian surveyed it with admiration.  \"That must stand in the parlor,\" he decided. \"But some one must come and help. I'm afraid I am not sufficiently robust. Silas, see if you can't find the Uphams' man. He was working there a short time ago.\"  \"If there's more to come, it is hardly worth while to clear up,\" began Elizabeth. \"I hope it will soon follow.\"  Chilian directed the two men, who found it still quite a burthen. Elizabeth opened the parlor shutter unwillingly, and the men set it in the middle of the floor.  There were two large rooms held almost sacred by both sisters. They were separated by an archway, apparently upheld on each end by a fluted column. Both rooms had a wide chimney-piece, the mantel and its supports elaborately carved and painted white. Two windows were in each end, draped with soft crimson curtains. The floor was polished, with a rug laid down in the centre. It was furnished in a manner that would have delighted a connoisseur, but Elizabeth did not admire the conglomeration. They were family relics and seemed to have little relation with one another, yet they were harmonious. There was a thin-legged spinet, with a Latin legend running across the front of the cover, which was always down. The chairs were not made for lounging, that was plain; and the sofa, with its rolling ends and claw feet, had been polished until the haircloth looked like satin. A dead and gone Leverett bride had imported that from London.  When the East Indian article had been consigned to an appropriate space, it looked as much at home as if it had lived there half a century. Then the parlor was shut up again, the mat in the hall shaken out, the front door bolted. Miss Winn had asked for a hammer and chisel that she might open one of the boxes.  \"Take Silas. That is a man's work,\" said Chilian.  Cynthia was in the sitting-room, where it was still chilly enough to have a fire. Eunice was knotting fringe for a bedspread, and it interested the child wonderfully. She was not a little shocked to find a child of nine knew nothing about sewing, had never hemmed ruffles, nor done overseam, or knit, or it seemed anything useful.  \"Why, when I was a little girl of your age I could spin in the little wheel.\"  \"What did you spin?\"  \"Why, thread, of course, linen thread made from flax.\"  \"Were you a truly little girl?\" in surprise.  \"Why, child, don't you know anything?\" Then Miss Eunice laughed softly and patted the small shoulder, looking kindly into the wondering eyes. There was no hurt in her tone and the words rather amused.  \"I know a great many things. I can read some Latin, and I know about Greece and its splendid heroes who conquered a good deal of the world. There was Alexander the Great and Philip of Macedon. And Tamerlane, who conquered nearly all Asia. And--and Confucius, the great man of China, who was a wise philosopher, and wrote a bible----\"  \"Oh, no; not a bible!\" interrupted Miss Eunice, horrified. \"There is only one Bible, my dear, and that is the Word of God.\"  \"But the other is the bible of the Chinese, and some of them believe Confucius was a god.\"  \"That is quite impossible, my dear;\" in a rather decisive, but still gentle tone.  \"And there is Brahma, and Vishnu, and there are ever so many gods in India. The people pray to them. And temples. When they want anything very much, they go and pray for it. There was a woman whose little son was very ill, and if he lived he was going to be a great prince, or something, and she gathered up her precious stones and her necklace and took them to the temple for the god. Father sent an English doctor, but they wouldn't let him see the little boy. He was so pretty, too. I used to see him in the court.\"  \"And did he live?\" Miss Eunice asked, much interested.  \"No; he didn't. And the father beat her for losing the jewels.\"  \"You see, those gods have no power.\"  \"Did you ever pray for anything you wanted very much?\"  Cynthia's bright eyes studied the placid face before her.  \"Yes,\" the lips murmured faintly.  \"And did you get it?\"  A flush stole over the puzzled countenance.  \"My dear, God doesn't see as we do. And He knows what is best for us, and gives us that. Maybe our prayer wasn't right.\"  \"How can you tell when a prayer is right or wrong?\" inquired the young theologian.  \"Why, you have to leave that to God;\" in a low, resigned tone.  \"I didn't want to come here. I wanted to stay with father. I didn't know there was any one beside, and I do not believe any one will ever love me so well. But he promised to come when the business was all done. So I prayed to the God of father's Bible, and I went to the temple with Nalla and put down a half-crown--it was all the money I had. But\"--her eyes filled with tears and her voice had a break in it--\"father begged so, and I came. But if Captain Corwin does not bring him next time I shall go back. I can't live without him.\"  The mild blue eyes of Miss Eunice filled with tears as well. She was not sure this had been the wisest course. The absolute truth was always best. But she temporized also in a vague fashion.  \"Yes; you can tell then. And you may come to like us so well you may stay content.\"  \"Oh, if he comes! Then it will be all right. And you think I ought to pray for that?\"  It was a cruel strait for Miss Eunice and staggered her faith. She was not to lead astray or harm \"one of the least of these.\" But the child _was_ a heathen with no real knowledge of the true God. Like a vision almost, Miss Eunice looked back at her own childhood, and the awful, overshadowing power she believed was God, who wrote down every wicked thought and wrong deed, and would confront her with them at the Judgment Day. She prayed nightly, often in the night, when she woke up, and she was no surer of God's love than this little heathen child.  \"It is right to pray for the things we want,"]]]
