I met Jonah that day on the wharf.  He looked like he had passed through a terrible spell of sickness.  His cheeks were hollow.  His eyes were red with sleeplessness.  He had a haggard, worn, hounded look about him.  \"Are you on the way home, Jonah?\"  And he shook his head and said, \"No.  I am going to Tarshish.\"  Tarshish was the most far away place of which the Jew had any conception.  \"Tarshish!\" I say in astonishment.  \"What are you going to do over at Tarshish?\"  \"Oh,\" he said, \"I hadn't thought about that.  I do not know what the future has in store for me.  What I am trying to do is to get away from God.\" \"And Jonah arose to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.\"  I wonder why the text did not say \"And Jonah arose to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of his duty\" instead of \"from the presence of the Lord.\"  The writer of this story had real spiritual insight.  He was far clearer in his thinking than many of us.  He knew that to flee from duty was to flee from God.  Whenever you make up your mind to refuse to go where God wants you to go and to do what God wants you to do, you must make up your mind at the same time to renounce the friendship of God.  You cannot walk with Him and at the same time be in rebellion against Him.  God has no possible way of entering into fellowship with the soul that is disobedient to His will.  Believe me, it is absolutely useless, it is mere mockery, to say \"Lord, Lord\" and then refuse to do the things that He commands you to do.  Now, when Jonah saw the spaces of water growing wider between him and the shore a kind of deadly calm came upon him.  A man with his mind made up to do wrong is far more at rest than the man whose mind is not made up at all.  So when Jonah had fully decided that he would rebel against God and give up all claim to God, a dreadful restfulness came to his troubled spirit.  He went down into the sides of the ship and went fast asleep.  The days before had been troubled days.  The nights had been restless nights.  But the battle was over now, even though it had been lost, and he was able at last to sleep.  This period marks, I am sure, the period of greatest danger in the life of Jonah.  Jonah had been a rebel before, but he had been a restless rebel.  He had been disobedient before, but his disobedience had tortured him.  It had put strands of gray into his hair and wrinkles upon his brow.  But now he is not only in rebellion, but he is content to be so.  He is not only without God, but he is, in a measure, satisfied to be without Him.  No greater danger can come to any man than that.  As long as your sin breaks your heart, as long as your disobedience makes you lie awake nights and wet your pillow in tears there is hope for you.  But when you become contented with your wickedness, when you come to believe that it is the best possible for you, then you are in danger indeed.  Now, I am fully convinced that Jonah's danger is the danger of a great many, both in the Church and out.  You who are listening to me at this moment are kindly and cultured men and women.  You are full of good will toward the Church.  You love it and desire its prosperity.  Yet many of you are doing practically nothing to make its desired prosperity a reality.  One of the most discouraging features about the Church to-day is the large number of utterly useless people within its fold.  And these are not only useless, but saddest of all, they are content with their uselessness.  They seem to feel that it is God's best for them; that it is all that God expects or has a right to expect.  Did you ever make out your religious program and look at it?  What does discipleship cost you?  What is involved in your allegiance to the Lord?  Coming to church once or twice a month on Sunday mornings and making a small contribution.  Only this and nothing more.  The Sunday School is not your burden.  The prayer meeting is not your burden. Visiting the new members that have recently come into our Church and into the Kingdom and need your help is not your responsibility. Helping by your presence and by your prayers to give spiritual fervor to all the services, is not your responsibility.  Yours is to make your way up to the doors of the House of Many Mansions by and by without ever having made one single costly sacrifice in order to follow the Lord.  Are you running away from your duty this morning?  You know what it is. At least you may know it.  This is a needy world.  This is a needy Church.  It has an opportunity to touch the uttermost parts of the earth if it is spiritually alive and spiritually mighty.  Are you making your contribution?  Are you accepting your responsibility or have you turned your back upon it for no other reason than just this, that it is too much trouble?  If that is true of me and if that is true of you, may the Lord wake us up this morning and give us to see our deadly danger.  So Jonah turned his back on his duty and turned his back on God.  He took ship for Tarshish and went to sleep.  Surely his situation is critical indeed.  But though he has forgotten God, God in His mercy has not forgotten him.  God still loves Jonah, still longs for him and still hopes for him.  And so in mercy He sends a storm after him.  That was dangerous cargo that that ship had on board.  It had better have had gasoline or T N T than a rebellious prophet.  It was in mercy, I say, that the Lord sent the storm after Jonah. Coverdale translates it, \"The Lord hurled a storm into the sea.\"  Let us thank God for the storms that rouse us, that wake us up, that keep us from sleeping our way into the pit.  May the Lord send us any kind of storm rather than allow us to fling ourselves eternally away from His presence.  I am so glad God will never allow a man to go comfortably and peacefully to eternal death.  He never allows any man to be lost until He has done His best to save him.  I read some years ago of a New England farmer who was driving to town on a cold winter's day.  He overtook a woman on the way who was walking and carrying a baby in her arms.  He took her up on the seat beside him.  The cold became more bitter.  He noticed after a while that the woman replied to his questions drowsily.  A little later he saw that she was asleep.  Ho knew that unless awakened she would sleep the sleep of death.  So he did what at first seemed a cruel thing.  He sprang from the wagon, dragged her out into the snow and took the child from her clinging arms.  With the child he sprang into the wagon and started his team down the road at a trot.  The woman roused herself and began to totter feebly forward.  A little later she quickened her pace.  At last she broke into a run.  And as she caught up with the wagon a little later and the farmer put the baby back into her arms, life had come back to the mother.  A temporal loss was a blessing to this woman. Let us thank God for any losses that may come to us that will keep us from sleeping our way to ruin.  So Jonah was down in the sides of the boat asleep.  Meanwhile the tempest was raging.  Meanwhile the fear-filled crew was rubbing elbows with death.  Then a hand is clapped on Jonah's shoulder and he is being given a vigorous shaking and a voice is calling to him.  And though it is a heathen voice it is full of rebuke.  \"What meanest thou, O sleeper?  How is it that you can sleep amidst all the agony, amidst all the danger that is about us?  When the situation is as it is, how is it that you are not on your knees?  Else and call upon thy God.\"  I wish through this message that I might take some of you who are sleeping so soundly and peacefully and shake you awake.  I wish that God might speak through my voice to my heart and yours and say to us, \"What meanest thou, O sleeper?  What do you mean by sitting idly and stupidly in the House of God Sunday after Sunday and never doing anything?  What do you mean by having children growing up about you and not being enough interested in their spiritual welfare to even have a family altar?  How is it that amidst the tremendous issues of moral life and moral death that you can be as complacent and as undisturbed as the dead?  Why in the name of all that is reasonable will you continue to 'lie like huge stones across the mouth of the sepulcher where God is trying to raise some Lazarus from the dead?'\"  That shake and that message got Jonah awake.  He sprang out of his berth and rushed upon the deck.  And the sight that met him there made a new man out of him.  It changed him from a provincial Jew into a world citizen and a missionary.  What did he realize as he looked into the pallid faces of those death threatened men about him?  He forgot all about their being heathen.  He only remembered that they were one with himself in their common danger and their common need.  They were all threatened with death.  They all needed somebody to save.  And, men and women, that is true still.  We folks differ in many respects, but we are all alike in this: We have all sinned and we all need a Savior.  He not only saw that they were one in their needs but that they were also one in their hopes.  He realized what we have been so long in realizing, and that is the oneness of the race.  He came to know, even in that distant day, that since we are one body, one member could not suffer without all members suffering with it.  He faced the fact that his own wicked rebellion against God had not only brought wretchedness upon himself, but that it was bringing it upon all that sailed with him.  No man ever flees from duty without incalculable hurt, not only to himself, but to others as well.  But, thank God, the reverse is also true.  If my disobedience hurts my obedience helps.  If my sin carries a curse my righteousness brings a blessing.  Here is another vessel lashed by a tempest.  But the preacher on board this time is on good terms"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20578"],["title","Sermons on Biblical Characters (#4)"],["body"," his God.  Therefore he puts one hand into the hand of his Lord and with the other he saves the whole company of two hundred and seventy-six souls that sail with him.  \"Be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.  For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.\"  \"How may the sea become calm for us,\" is the question.  Jonah does not offer an easy suggestion.  \"Cast me overboard,\" is the reply.  The man who a few days ago despised the heathen is now ready to die for them. That shows that God had made him a new man.  I know he backslides a bit later, but he comes out all right in the end.  And, my brethren, God has no other method for stilling seas than that employed by Jonah.  When the tempest of this world's sin was to be stilled there was no cheaper way than for Christ to allow himself to be thrown overboard.  When Livingstone wanted to still the tempest of Africa he did not undertake the task from long distance.  He allowed himself to be thrown overboard.  And that is the price you and I have to pay for real service.  \"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\"  So Jonah was cast into the sea.  But by losing his life he found it.  A friend of mine told recently of an experience of his in dealing with a British soldier in India.  This soldier was seeking salvation.  They prayed together.  But as they were about to separate, the soldier was not satisfied.  He staggered against the wall and prayed after this fashion: \"Lord, my sins are many.  I am unworthy of thy salvation.  I am unworthy of a vision of thy face.  But if there is any place that you want some man to die for you I would count it as a great favor if you would let me be that man.\"  \"And then suddenly,\" said my friend, \"the light came into his face and he was conscious of the presence of Christ.\"  If you will do this to-day, stop running from God and turn and walk with Him, you will find that Nineveh is not a city of restlessness and wretchedness.  But you will find that it is a city rich in fellowship with God and in the blessed experience of that peace that passeth all understanding.  Which way are you going to travel from this hour?  Out of that door you will go in a moment facing toward Nineveh or toward Tarshish.  Which way will you face?  May God grant that every step you take from this hour may be toward Nineveh.     III  THE ROMANCE OF FAITH--PETER  _Matthew 14:28_  \"Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.\"  I could not tell you how many times I have read this fascinating story.  I have turned to it again and again.  But in spite of its familiarity it always grips me.  I can never read it thoughtfully without a thrill.  I can never expose my soul to the vital truth of it without being helped and made a little bit more hopeful and I trust a little bit better.  Look at the picture.  Here is a little ship in the midst of a storm at sea.  A dozen men are manning the oars, battling with the tempest, fighting through the long hours of the night with the storm-whipped sea, fisticuffing with death, and yet getting nowhere.  It has been long hours since they left the shore.  It is now three o'clock in the morning, but they have made very little progress.  I have a fancy that they have become very tired and very discouraged. And more than once has one said to the other, \"I wish the Master were here.  If He were here He would know what to do.\"  And then, to add to their terror, they suddenly see their master walking from wave to wave toward them across the sea.  But he is not recognized.  They take him for a ghost and they cry out in fear.  This is not an altogether unique experience.  Many times Jesus comes to us in a way that makes us rather dread than welcome His approach. Sometimes He comes with demands for the giving up of certain sins or certain pleasures that we do not wish to give up.  Sometimes He asks us for services that we do not wish to render.  He demands surrenders that we do not at all desire to make.  Sometimes He comes to us in the guise of a great disappointment.  He comes in the garb of a heartache that wets our faces with tears.  The disciples, I say, were at first afraid.  But Jesus calmed their fears by saying, \"It is I.  Be not afraid.\"  The Bible seems to have been written in large measure just to still the fears of our timid hearts.  Over and over again is that message directed to us, \"Fear not.\"  And at once fear was driven from these hearts.  And in the place of fear came, to one at least, a glorious and buoyant faith.  \"Lord, if it be thou,\" shouted Peter, \"bid me come to thee on the water.\"  You see the effect the presence of Christ had upon Peter.  As soon as he recognized Jesus he ceased to fear and began to hope.  As soon as he realized the presence of Christ he gave up doubt and despair and began to believe.  The presence of Christ always makes for faith. Peter was gripped by a firm conviction that now that Christ had come impossibilities were transmuted into possibilities.  \"Bid me come to thee on the water.\"  Peter had no disposition to climb out of that boat before Jesus came.  He had no desire to undertake this seemingly mad task while Christ was yonder on the mountain side and the little boat was being battered by the storm.  But Christ had begotten within him a beautiful and seemingly utterly reckless faith.  That which a moment ago was an impossibility is now altogether capable of being accomplished.  Christ always inspires such faith in the hearts of those who really know Him.  In such faith He takes the keenest delight.  There is nothing that so pleases Him as the most daring and reckless and romantic faith.  He is never so joyed as when men trust Him with mad abandon.  Never once did He praise a prudent and conservative faith. All His encomiums are for those who trust Him with a romantic recklessness.  Did you happen to meet the woman with the issue of blood as she set out to see Jesus?  Well, it is good that you did not or you would have done your best to have discouraged her.  Of course you would and so would I. \"Sarah,\" I would have said, \"are you going to ask Jesus to help you? Are you going to seek him out and fall on your face before Him in prayer?\"  \"No,\" she would have answered, \"I am not going to pray.  I am not going to ask the Master to do anything for me at all.  I am simply going to slip up behind Him when the crowd is thronging Him, and touch His garment.  I have a shamefaced disease.  I want as little attention as possible.  Hence I am not going to say a single word to Jesus.\"  Then, I would have answered with conviction, \"You will never be cured. The Master has made no promise that He will honor a mad faith like yours.  When did He say He would heal if you merely slipped up in a mob and touched the fringe of His garment?\"  But I was not there to throw dashes of cold water upon the fire.  She went on her reckless way.  And wonder of wonders, she was healed.  \"Lord, bid me come,\" said Peter.  And what was the reply of Jesus?  Did He say, \"Peter, I am astonished at you.  Why do you want to do this foolish and insane and impossible thing?  Don't you know that the storm is against you?  Don't you know that the law of gravitation is against you?  Don't you know that the whole experience of the race is against you?  You have been about the sea all your life.  When did you ever see anybody walk on the waves?  Why do you request, then, to do this absurd and ridiculous and impossible thing?\"  But Jesus did not say that.  I never read where He told a single trusting heart that his request was impossible.  I do read where He said the very opposite.  He said, \"All things are possible to him that believeth.\"  He makes all things possible.  That is what he is for.  He ever attacks men at the point of their impossibilities.  He calls on the selfish man to love his neighbor as himself.  He calls on the paralytics to rise and walk.  And never does He have a rebuke for the man who dares to fling himself blindly upon His power.  And instead of rebuking Peter He approved him.  He encouraged him.  He set His sanction upon his request.  He said to him, \"Come.\"  I am sure if you or I had been there we would have wanted Him to have said far more.  We would have wanted Him to explain to us how He would hold us and enable us to walk.  But the invitation, \"Come,\" that one word was enough for Peter.  \"Come,\" said Jesus.  What would you have done under those circumstances?  What would I?  I suppose I know.  I would have said, \"Lord, I'd like to.  I wish I could.  I've always wanted to do something magnificent.  It has occurred to me again and again as I have read the record of thy dealings with thy saints that the Christian life is not to be a dull and drab and unromantic thing.  I have felt a thousand times that the faith of the saints ought to have far more of buoyancy and enthusiasm and daring and romantic adventure in it than it has.  So since you have bid me come, Lord, I'd like to come.  I'll think it over.  Who knows but that I may try it some day?\"  But Peter was made out of more heroic stuff.  The spirit of adventure had not died within him.  His faith is full of the finest romance. \"Come,\" said Jesus and immediately I see Peter drop his oar and begin to climb down out of the boat to go to Jesus.  Some of the commentators are very hard on Peter for his boldness and seeming foolhardiness here.  But I am frank to say that I like Peter here very much.  I suppose most of the critics would have sat very still in the boat.  I shouldn't wonder if they would not have put a restraining hand upon Peter.  In fact, it would not surprise me if some of his fellow disciples did not do that very thing.  I can imagine that Andrew might have"]]]
