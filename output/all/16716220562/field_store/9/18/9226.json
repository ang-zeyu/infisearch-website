The footprints were plain in the soft sand; if he had stood back a little further, and had been more careful where he stepped, we might not have found the tracks so easily; but he had stepped on some soft sand and mud. We knew that he was not a large man, because we had seen him; and we didn't believe that he was a prospector or a miner, because his soles were not hobbed--or a cow-puncher, because he had no high heels to sink in; he may have been a rancher, out looking about.  \"He must be left-handed,\" said Fitz.  \"Why?\" I asked.  \"Because, see?\" and then he told me.  Sure enough. That was smart of Fitz, I thought. But he's splendid to read sign.  Now we followed the tracks back. The man had come down and had returned by the same route. And up in the timber about fifty yards he had had a horse. We read how he had been riding through, and had stopped, and got off and walked down to the pond, and stood, and walked back and mounted again and ridden on. All that was easy for Fitz, and I could read most of it myself.  We trailed the horse until the tracks surely went away from the pond into the timber country; then we let it go, and met General Ashley, to report. General Ashley and Kit Carson also examined the prints in the sand, and we all agreed that the man probably was left-handed.  Now, why had he come down to the edge of the pond, on purpose, and looked at it and at us, and then turned up at a trot into the timber? It would seem as if he might have been afraid that we had seen him, and he didn't want to be seen. But all our guesses here and after we reached camp again didn't amount to much, of course.  We decided to stay for the night. It was a good camp place, and we wouldn't gain anything, maybe, by starting on, near night, and getting caught in the timber in the dark. And this would give the burros a good rest and a fill-up before their climb.  The burned stretch where we were was plumb full of live things--striped chipmunks, and pine squirrels, and woodpecker families. Fitzpatrick started in to take chipmunk pictures--and you ought to see how he can manage a camera with one hand. He holds it between his knees or else under his left arm, to draw the bellows out, and the rest is easy.  He scouted about and got some pictures of chipmunks real close, by waiting, and a picture of a woodpecker feeding young ones, at a hole in a dead pine stump. This was a good place for bear to come, after the berries; and we were hoping that one would amble in while we were there so that Fitz could take a picture of it, too. Bears don't hurt people unless people try to hurt them; and a bear would sooner have raspberries than have a man or boy, any day. Fitzpatrick thought that if he could get a good picture of a bear, out in the open, that would bring him a Scout's honor. Of course, chipmunk pictures help, too. But while we were resting and fooling and taking pictures, and General Ashley was bringing his diary and his map up to date, for record, we had another visitor. (Note 20.)  A man came riding a dark bay horse, with white nose and white right fore foot, along our side of the beaver pond, and halted at our camp. The horse had left ear swallow-tailed and was branded with a Diamond Five on the right shoulder. The man wasn't the man we had seen across the pond, for he wore a sombrero, and was taller and had on overalls, and cow-puncher boots.  [Illustration]  \"Howdy?\" he said.  \"How are you?\" we answered.  He sort of lazily dismounted, and yawned--but his sharp eyes were taking us and our camp all in.  \"Out fishing?\" he asked.  \"No, sir. Passing through,\" said General Ashley.  \"Going far?\"  \"Over to Green Valley.\"  \"Walking?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Good place for beaver, isn't it?\"  \"A bad place.\"  \"That so? Used to be some about here. Couldn't catch any, eh?\"  \"We aren't trying. But it seems a bad place for beaver because the only one we have seen is a dead one in a trap.\"  The man waked up. \"Whose trap?\"  \"We don't know.\" And the general went on to explain.  The man nodded. \"I'm a deputy game warden,\" he said at last. \"Somebody's been trapping beaver in here, and it's got to stop. Haven't seen any one pass through?\"  We had. The general reported.  \"Smallish man?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Roan hoss branded quarter circle D on the left hip? Brass-bound stirrups?\"  \"We didn't see the horse; but we think the man was left-handed,\" said the general.  \"Why?\"  \"He was left-footed, because there was a hole in the sole of the left shoe, and that would look as though he used his left foot more than his right. So we think he may be left-handed, too.\" (Note 21.)  The game warden grunted. He eyed our flag.  \"You kids must be regular Boy Scouts.\"  \"We are.\"  \"Then I reckon you aren't catching any beaver. All right, I'll look for a left-footed man, maybe left-handed. But it's this fellow on the roan hoss I'm after. He's been trying to sell pelts. There's no use my trailing him, to-day. But I'll send word ahead, and if you lads run across him let somebody know. Where are you bound for?\"  The general told him.  \"By way of Pilot Peak?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, I'll tell you a short cut. You see that strip of young timber running up over the ridge? That's an old survey trail. It crosses to the other side. Over beyond you'll strike Dixon's Park and a ruined saw-mill. After that you can follow up Dixon's Creek.\"  We thanked him and he mounted and rode away.     CHAPTER V  TWO RECRUITS   When we got up in the morning, the mountains still had their night-caps on. White mist was floating low about their tips, and lying in the gulches like streams and lakes. Above timber-line, opposite us, was a long layer of cloud, with the top of old Pilot Peak sticking through.  This was a weather sign, although the sun rose clear and the sky was blue. Nightcaps are apt to mean a showery day. (Note 22.) We took our wet rub, ate breakfast, policed the camp and killed the fire, and General Ashley put camphor and cotton against little Jed Smith's back tooth, to stop some aching. Maybe there was a hole in the tooth, or maybe Jed had just caught cold in it, after being wet; but he ought to have had his teeth looked into before he started out on the scout. (Note 23.) Anyway, the camphor stopped the ache--and made him dance, too.  We crossed the creek, above the beaver pond, and struck off into the old survey trail that cut over the ridge. The brush was thick, and the trees had sprung up again, so that really it wasn't a regular trail unless you had known about it. The blazes on the side trees had closed over. But all the same, by watching the scars, and by keeping in the line where the trees always opened out, and by watching the sky as it showed before, we followed right along.  After we had been traveling about two hours, we heard thunder and that made us hustle the more, to get out of the thin timber, so that we would not be struck by lightning. (Note 24.) The wind moaned through the trees. The rain was coming, sure.  The trail was diagonally up-hill, all the way, and if we had been cigarette smokers we wouldn't have had breath enough to hit the fast pace that General Ashley set. The burros had to trot, and it made little Jed Smith, who is kind of fat, wheeze; but we stuck it out and came to a flat place of short dried grass and bushes, with no trees. Here we stopped. We were about nine thousand feet up.  From where we were we could see the storm. It was flowing down along a bald-top mountain back from our camp at the beaver pond, and looked like gray smoke. The sun was just being swallowed. Well, all we could do was to wait and take it, and see how bad it was. We tied Sally and Apache to some bushes, but we didn't unpack them, of course. The tarps on top would keep the grub from getting wet.  The storm made a grand sight, as it rolled toward us, over the timber. And soon it was raining below us, down at the beaver pond--and then, with a drizzle and a spatter, the rain reached us, too.  We sat hunched, under our hats, and took it. We might have got under blankets--but that would have given us soaked blankets for night, unless we had stretched the tarps, too; and if we had stretched the tarps then the rest of our packs would have suffered. The best way is to crawl under a spruce, where the limbs have grown close to the ground. But not in a thunder storm. And it is better to be wet yourself and have a dry camp for night, than to be dry yourself and have a wet camp for night.  Anyway, the rain didn't hurt us. While it thundered and lightened and the drops pelted us well, we sang our Patrol song--which is a song like one used by the Black feet Indians:      \"The Elk is our Medicine,     He makes us very strong.     The Elk is our Medicine,     The Elk is our Medicine,     The Elk is our Medicine,     He makes us very strong.     Ooooooooooooooooooooooo!\"  And when the thunder boomed we sang at it:      \"The _Thunder_ is our Medicine--\"  to show that we weren't afraid of it.  The squall passed on over us, and when it had about quit we untied the burros and started on again. In just a minute we were warm and sweating and could shed our coats; and the sun came out hot to dry us off.  We crossed the ridge, and on the other side we saw Dixon's Park. We knew it was Dixon's Park, because the timber had been cut from it, and Dixon's Park had had a saw-mill twenty years ago.  Once this park had been grown over with trees, like the side of the ridge where we had been climbing; but that saw-mill had felled everything in sight, so that now there were only old stumps and dead logs. It looked like a graveyard. If the mill had been watched, as most mills are to-day, and had been made to leave part of the trees, then the timber would have grown again.  Down through the graveyard we went, and stopped for nooning at the little creek which ran through the bottom. There weren't any fish in this creek; the mill had killed the timber, and it had driven out the fish with sawdust. It was just a dead place,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20710"],["title","Pluck on the Long Trail; Or, Boy Scouts in the Rockies (#6)"],["body"," and there didn't seem to be even chipmunks.  We had nooning at the ruins of the mill. Tin cans and old boot soles and rusted pipe were still scattered about. We were a little tired, and more rain was coming, so we made a fire by finding dry wood underneath slabs and things, and had tea and bread and butter. That rested us. Little Jed Smith was only twelve years old, and we had to travel to suit him and not just to suit us bigger boys. I'm fourteen and Major Henry is sixteen. All the afternoon was showery; first we were dry, then we were wet; and there wasn't much fun about sloshing and slipping along; but we pegged away, and climbed out of Dixon's Park to the ridge beyond it. Now we could see old Pilot Peak plain, and keeping to the high ground we made for it. It didn't look to be very far away; but we didn't know, now, all the things that lay between.  The top of this ridge was flat, and the forest reserve people had been through and piled up the brush, so that a fire would not spread easily. That made traveling good, and we hiked our best. Down in a gulch beside us there was a stream: Dixon's Creek. But we kept to the high ground, with our eyes open for a good camping spot, for the dark would close in early if the rain did not quit. And nobody can pick a good camping place in the dark.  Regular rest means a great deal when you are traveling across country. Even cowboys will tell you that. They bed down as comfortably as they can, every time, on the round-up.  After a while we came to a circular little spot, hard and flat, where the timber had opened out. And General Ashley stopped and with a whirl dug in his heel as sign that we would camp here. There was wood and drainage and grass for the burros, and no danger of setting fire to the trees if we made a big fire. We had to carry water up from the creek below, but that was nothing.  Now we must hustle and get the camp in shape quick, before the things get wet. While Fitzpatrick picked out a spot for his fire and Major Henry chopped wood, two of us unpacked each burro. We put the things under a tarp, and I started to bring up the water, but General Ashley spoke.  \"We're out of meat,\" he said. \"You take the rifle and shoot a couple of rabbits. There ought to be rabbits about after the rain.\"  This suited me. He handed me the twenty-two rifle and five cartridges; out of those five cartridges I knew I could get two rabbits or else I wasn't any good as a hunter. The sun was shining once more, and the shadows were long in the timber, so I turned to hunt against the sun, and put my shadow behind me. Of course, that wouldn't make _very_ much difference, because rabbits usually see you before you see them; but I was out after meat and must not miss any chances. There always is a right way and a wrong way.  This was a splendid time to hunt for rabbits, right after a rain. They come out then before dark, and nibble about. And you can walk on the wetness without much noise. Early morning and the evening are the best rabbit hours, anyway.  I walked quick and straight-footed, looking far ahead, and right and left, through the timber, to sight whatever moved. Yet I might be passing close to a rabbit, without seeing him, for he would be squatting. So I looked behind, too. And after I had walked about twenty minutes, I did see a rabbit. He was hopping, at one side, through the bushes; he gave only about three hops, and squatted, to let me pass. So I stopped stock-still, and drew up my rifle. He was about thirty yards away, and was just a bunch like a stone; but I held my breath and aimed at where his ears joined his head, and fired quick. He just kicked a little. That was a pretty good shot and I was glad, for I didn't want to hurt him and we had to have meat.  I hunted quite a while before I saw another rabbit. The next one was a big old buck rabbit, because his hind quarters around his tail were brown; young rabbits are white there. He hopped off, without stopping, and I whistled at him--wheet! Then he stopped, and I missed him. I shot over him, because I was in a hurry. I went across and saw where the bullet had hit. And he had ducked.  He hopped out of sight, through the brush; so I must figure where he probably would go. On beyond was a hilly place, with rocks, and probably he lived here--and rabbits usually make up-hill when they're frightened. So I took a circle, to cut him off; and soon he hopped again and squatted. This time I shot him through the head, where I aimed; so I didn't hurt him, either. I picked him up and was starting back for camp, because two rabbits were enough, when I heard somebody shouting. It didn't sound like a Scout's shout, but I answered and waited and kept answering, and in a few minutes a strange boy came running and walking fast through the trees. He carried a single-barrel shotgun.  He never would have seen me if I hadn't spoken; but when he wasn't more than ten feet from me I said: \"What's the matter?\"  He jumped and saw me standing. \"Hello,\" he panted. \"Was it you who was shooting and calling?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Why didn't you come on, then?\" he scolded. He was angry.  \"Because you were coming,\" I said. \"I stood still and called back, to guide you.\"  \"What did you shoot at?\"  \"Rabbits.\"  He hadn't seen them before, but now he saw them on the ground. \"Aw, jiminy!\" he exclaimed. \"We've got something better than that, but we can't make a fire and our matches are all wet and so are our blankets, and we don't know what to do. There's another fellow with me. We're lost.\"  He was a sight; wet and dirty and sweaty from running, and scared.  \"What are you doing? Camping?\" I asked.  He nodded. \"We started for Duck Lake, with nothing but blankets and what grub we could carry; but we got to chasing around and we missed the trail and now we don't know where we are. Gee, but we're wet and cold. Where's your camp?\"  \"Back on the ridge.\"  \"Got a fire?\"  \"Uh huh,\" I nodded. \"Sure.\"  \"Come on,\" he said. \"We'll go and get the other fellow and then we'll camp near you so as to have some fire.\"  \"All right,\" I said.  He led off, and I picked up the rabbits and followed. He kept hooting, and the other boy answered, and we went down into the gulch where the creek flowed. Now, that was the dickens of a place to camp! Anybody ought to know better than to camp down at the bottom of a narrow gulch, where it is damp and nasty and dark. They did it because it was beside the water, and because there was some soft grass that they could lie on. (Note 25.)  The other boy was about seventeen, and was huddled in a blanket, trying to scratch a match and light wet paper. He wore a big Colt's six-shooter on a cartridge belt about his waist.  \"Come out, Bat,\" called the boy with me. \"Here's a kid from another camp, where they have fire and things.\"  Bat grunted, and they gathered their blankets and a frying-pan and other stuff.  \"Lookee! This beats rabbit,\" said the first boy (his name was Walt); and he showed me what they had killed. It was four grouse!  Now, that was mean.  \"It's against the law to kill grouse yet,\" I told him.  \"Aw, what do we care?\" he answered. \"Nobody knows.\"  \"It's only a week before the season opens, anyhow,\" spoke Bat. \"We got the old mother and all her chickens. If we hadn't, somebody would, later.\"  Fellows like that are as bad as a forest fire. Just because of them, laws are made, and they break them and the rest of us keep them.  We climbed out of the gulch, and I was so mad I let them carry their own things. The woods were dusky, and I laid a straight course for camp. It was easy to find, because I knew that I had hunted with my back to it, in sound of the water on my left. All we had to do was to follow through the ridge with the water on our right, and listen for voices.  I tell you, that camp looked good. The boys had two fires, a big one to dry us by and a little one to cook by. (Note 26.) One of the tarps had been laid over a pole in crotched stakes, about four feet high, and tied down at the ends (Note 27), for a dog-tent, and spruce trimmings and brush had been piled behind for a wind-break and to reflect the heat. Inside were the spruce needles that carpeted the ground and had been kept dry by branches, and a second tarp had been laid to sleep on, with the third tarp to cover us, on top of the blankets. The flags had been set up. Fitzpatrick was cooking, Major Henry was dragging more wood to burn, the fellows were drying damp stuff and stacking it safe under the panniers, or else with their feet to the big blaze were drying themselves, the burros were grazing close in. It was as light as day, with the flames reflected on the trees and the flags, and it seemed just like a trappers' bivouac.  Then we walked into the circle; and when the fellows saw the rabbits they gave a cheer. After I reported to General Ashley and turned the two boys over to him, I cleaned the rabbits for supper.  The two new boys, Bat and Walt, threw down their stuff and sat by the fire to get warm. Bat still wore his big six-shooter. They dropped their grouse in plain sight, but nobody said a word until Bat (he was the larger one) spoke up, kind of grandly, when I was finishing the rabbits:  \"There's some birds. If you'll clean 'em we'll help you eat 'em.\"  \"No, thanks. We don't want them,\" answered General Ashley.  \"Why not?\"  \"It's against the law.\"  \"Aw, what difference does that make now?\" demanded Walt. \"There aren't any game wardens 'round. And it's only a week before the law goes out, anyway.\"  \"But the grouse are dead, just the same,\" retorted General Ashley. \"They couldn't be any deader, no matter how long it is before the law opens, or if a game warden was right here!\" He was getting angry, and when he's angry he isn't afraid to say anything, because he's red-headed.  \"You'd like to go and tell, then; wouldn't you!\" they sneered.  \"I'd tell if it would do any good.\" And he would, too; and so would any of us. \"The game laws are made to be kept. Those were our"]]]
