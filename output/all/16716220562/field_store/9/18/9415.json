The sequel of the story forms the poem called _Lara_.--Byron, _The Corsair_ (1814).   =Medo´ro=, a Moorish youth of extraordinary beauty, but of humble race; page to Agramante. Being wounded, Angelica dressed his wounds, fell in love with him, married him, and retired with him to Cathay, where, in right of his wife, he became a king. This was the cause of Orlando’s madness.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).       When Don Roldan [_Orlando_] discovered in a fountain proofs of      Angelica’s dishonorable conduct with Medoro, it distracted him to      such a degree that he tore up huge trees by the roots, sullied the      purest streams, destroyed flocks, slew shepherds, fired their huts,      pulled houses to the ground, and committed a thousand other most      furious exploits worthy of being reported in fame’s      register.--Cervantes, _Don Quixote_, I. iii. 11 (1605).   =Medu´sa= (_The soft_), Mary Stuart, queen of Scots (1545-1577).

(1839).   =Meeta=, the “maid of Mariendorpt,” a true woman and a true heroine. She is the daughter of Mahldenau, minister of Mariendorpt, whom she loves almost to idolatry.

(1748).   =Megingjard=, the belt of Thor, whereby his strength was doubled.   =Megissog´won= (“_the great pearl feather_”), a magician, and the Manĭto of wealth. It was Megissogwon who sent the fiery fever on man, the white fog, and death. Hiawatha slew him, and taught man the science of medicine. This great Pearl-Feather slew the father of Niko´mis (the grandmother of Hiawatha). Hiawatha all day long fought with the magician without effect; at nightfall the woodpecker told him to strike at the tuft of hair on the magician’s head, the only vulnerable place; accordingly, Hiawatha discharged his three remaining arrows at the hair tuft, and Megissogwon died.      “Honor be to Hiawatha!      He hath slain the great Pearl-Feather;      Slain the mightiest of magicians--      Him that sent the fiery fever, ...      Sent disease and death among us.”       Longfellow, _Hiawatha_, ix.

An association of master tradesmen to revive the national minstrelsy, which had fallen into decay with the decline of the minnesingers, or love minstrels (1350-1523). Their subjects were chiefly moral or religious, and constructed according to rigid rules. The three chief were Hans Rosenblüt (armorial painter, born 1450), Hans Folz (surgeon, born 1479), and Hans Sachs (cobbler, 1494-1574). The next best were Heinrich von Mueglen, Konrad Harder, Master Altschwert, Master Barthel Regenbogen (the blacksmith), Muscablüt (the tailor), and Hans Blotz (the barber).   =Mej´noun and Lei´lah= (2 _syl._), a Persian love tale, the Romeo and Juliet of Eastern romance. They are the most beautiful, chaste, and impassionate of lovers; the models of what lovers would be if human nature were perfect.

Beckford, _Vathek_      (1786).   =Mela Dryfoos.= Loud young lady of the gilded period, “physically too amiable and too well corporeally ever to be quite cross,” but selfish and coarse and reposing confidently upon the importance given her by her father’s money.--W. D. Howells, _A Hazard of New Fortunes_ (1889).   =Melan´chates= (4 _syl._), the hound that killed Actæon, and was changed into a hart.      Melanchates, that hound     That plucked Actæon to the grounde,     Gaue him his mortal wound, ...     Was chaungéd to a harte.      J. Skelton, _Philip Sparow_ (time, Henry VIII).   =Melantius=, a rough, honest soldier, who believes every one is true till convicted of crime, and then is he a relentless punisher. Melantius and Diph´ilus are brothers of Evadnê.--Beaumont and Fletcher, _The Maid’s Tragedy_ (1610).  ⁂ The master scene between Antony and Ventidius in Dryden’s _All for Love_ is copied from _The Maid’s Tragedy_. “Ventidius” is in the place of Melantius.   =Melchior=, one of the three kings of Cologne. He was the “Wise Man of the East” who offered to the infant Jesus _gold_, the emblem of royalty. The other two were Gaspar and Balthazar. Melchior means “king of light.”  _Melchior_, a monk attending the black priest of St. Paul’s.--Sir W. Scott, _Anne of Geierstein_ (time, Edward IV.).  _Melchior_ (_i.e. Melchior Pfinzing_), a German poet who wrote the _Teuerdank_, an epic poem which has the kaiser Maximilian (son of Frederick III.) for its hero.

Longfellow, _Nuremberg_.   =Melea´ger=, son of Althæa, who was doomed to live while a certain log remained unconsumed. Althæa kept the log for several years, but being one day angry with her son, she cast it on the fire, where it was consumed. Her son died at the same moment.--Ovid, _Metam._, viii. 4.  Sir John Davies uses this to illustrate the immortality of the soul. He says that the life of the soul does not depend on the body as Meleager’s life depended on the fatal brand.      Again, if by the body’s prop she stand--       If on the body’s life her life depend,     As Meleager’s on the fatal brand;       The body’s good she only would intend.      _Reason_, iii. (1622).   =Melesig´enes= (5 _syl._). Homer is so called from the river Melês (2 _syl._), in Asia Minor, on the banks of which some say he was born.              ... various measured verse,     Æolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,     And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,     Blind Melesigēnês, thence Homer called,     Whose poem Phœbus challenged for his own.

Meli is called “The Sicilian Theocritus” (1740-1815).      Much it pleased him to peruse     The songs of the Sicilian Muse--     Bucolic songs by Meli sung.      Longfellow, _The Wayside Inn_ (prelude, 1863).   =Meliadus=, father of Sir Tristan; prince of Lyonnesse, and one of the heroes of Arthurian romance.--_Tristan de Leonois_ (1489).  ⁂ Tristan, in the _History of Prince Arthur_, compiled by Sir T. Malory (1470), is called “Tristram;” but the old minnesingers of Germany (twelfth century) called the name “Tristan.”   =Mel´ibe= (3 _syl._), a rich young man married to Prudens. One day, when Melibê was in the fields, some enemies broke into his house, beat his wife, and wounded his daughter Sophie in her feet, hands, ears, nose and mouth. Melibê was furious and vowed vengeance, but Prudens persuaded him “to forgive his enemies, and to do good to those who despitefully used him.” So he called together his enemies, and forgave them, to the end that “God of His endeles mercie wole at the tyme of oure deyinge forgive us oure giltes that we have trespased to Him in this wreeched world.”--Chaucer, _Canterbury Tales_ (1388).  ⁂ This prose tale is a liberal translation of a French story.--See _MS. Reg._, xix. 7; and _MS. Reg._, xix. 11, British Museum.   =Melibee=, a shepherd, and the reputed father of Pastorella. Pastorella married Sir Calidore.--Spenser, _Faëry Queen_, vi. 9 (1596).  “Melibee” is Sir Francis Walsingham. In the _Ruins of Time_, Spenser calls him “Melibœ.” Sir Philip Sidney (the “Sir Calidore” of the _Faëry Queen_) married his daughter Frances. Sir Francis Walsingham died in 1590, so poor that he did not leave enough to defray his funeral expenses.   =Melibœus=, one of the shepherds in _Eclogue_ i. of Virgil.  Spenser, in the _Ruins of Time_ (1591), calls Sir Francis Walsingham “the good Melibœ;” and in the last book of the _Faëry Queen_ he calls him “Melibee.”   =Melin´da=, cousin of Sylvia. She loves Worthy, whom she pretends to dislike, and coquets with him for twelve months. Having driven her modest lover to the verge of distraction, she relents, and consents to marry him.--G. Farquhar, _The Recruiting Officer_ (1705).   =Mel´ior=, a lovely fairy, who carried off, in her magic bark,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],["title","Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#8)"],["body","en´opex, of Blois, to her secret island.--_Parthenopex de Blois_ (a French romance, twelfth century).   =Melisen´dra= (_The princess_), natural daughter of Marsilio, and the “supposed daughter of Charlemagne.” She eloped with Don Gayferos. The king, Marsilio, sent his troops in pursuit of the fugitive. Having made Melisendra his wife, Don Gayferos delivered her up captive to the Moors at Saragossa. This was the story of the puppet-show of Master Peter, exhibited to Don Quixote and his squire at “the inn beyond the hermitage.”--Cervantes, _Don Quixote_, II. ii. 7 (1615).   =Melissa=, a prophetess who lived in Merlin’s cave. Bradamant gave her the enchanted ring to take to Roge´ro; so, under the form of Atlantês, she went to Alcīna’s isle, delivered Rogēro, and disenchanted all the captives in the island.  In bk. xix. Melissa, under the form of Rodŏmont, persuaded Agramant to break the league which was to settle the contest by single combat, and a general battle ensued.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).  ⁂ This incident of bk. xix. is similar to that in Homer’s _Iliad_, iii. iv., where Paris and Menelāos agree to settle the contest by single combat; but Minerva persuades Pandăros to break the truce, and a general battle ensues.   =Me´lita= (now _Malta_). The point to which the vessel that carried St. Paul was driven was the “Porto de San Paolo,” and according to tradition, the cathedral of Citta Vecchia stands on the site of the house of Publius, the Roman governor. St. Paul’s grotto, a cave in the vicinity, is so named in honor of this great apostle.   =Meli´tus=, a gentleman of Cyprus, in the drama called _The Laws of Candy_, by Beaumont and Fletcher (1647).   =Melizyus=, king of Thessaly, in the golden era of Saturn. He was the first to tame horses for the use of man.  _Melizyus_ (_King_) held his court in the Tower of Chivalry, and there knighted Graunde Amoure, after giving him the following advice:      And first _Good Hope_ his legge harneyes should be;     His habergion, of _Perfect Ryhteousnes_,     Gird first with the girdle of _Chastitie_;     His rich placarde should be good busines,     Brodred with _Alms_ ...     The helmet _Mekenes_, and the shelde _Good Fayeth_,     His swerde _God’s Word_, as St. Paule sayeth.      Stephen Hawes, _The Passe-tyme of Plesure_, xxviii. (1515).   =Mell= (_Mr._), the poor, down-trodden second master at Salem House, the school of Mr. Creakles. Mr. Mell played the flute.

Mell emigrated to Australia, and succeeded well in the new country.--C. Dickens, _David Copperfield_ (1849).   =Melle´font= (2 _syl._), in love with Cynthia, daughter of Sir Paul Pliant. His aunt, Lady Touchwood, had a criminal fondness for him, and, because he repelled her advances, she vowed his ruin. After passing several hair-breadth escapes from the “double dealing” of his aunt and his “friend,” Maskwell, he succeeded in winning and marrying the lady of his attachment.--W. Congreve, _The Double Dealer_ (1700).   =Mellifluous Doctor= (_The_), St. Bernard, whose writings were called “a river of paradise” (1091-1153).   =Melnotte= (_Claude_), a gardener’s son, in love with Pauline, “the Beauty of Lyons,” but treated by her with contempt. Beauseant and Glavis, two other rejected suitors, conspired with him to humble the proud fair one. To this end, Claude assumed to be the prince of Como, and Pauline married him, but was indignant when she discovered how she had been duped. Claude left her to join the French army, and, under the name of Morier, rose in two years and a half to the rank of colonel. He then returned to Lyons, and found his father-in-law on the eve of bankruptcy, and Pauline about to be sold to Beauseant to pay the creditors. Claude paid the money required, and claimed Pauline as his loving and truthful wife.--Lord L. B. Lytton, _Lady of Lyons_ (1838).   =Melo= (_Juan de_), born at Castile in the fifteenth century. A dispute having arisen at Esalo´na upon the question whether Achillês or Hector were the braver warrior, the Marquis de Ville´na called out, “Let us see if the advocates of Achillês can fight as well as prate.” At the word, there appeared in the assembly a gigantic fire-breathing monster, which repeated the same challenge. Every one shrank back except Juan de Melo, who drew his sword and placed himself before King Juan II. to protect him, “tide life, tide death.” The king appointed him alcaydê of Alcala la Real, in Grana´da, for his loyalty.--_Chronica de Don Alvaro de Luna._   =Melrose= (_Violet_), an heiress, who marries Charles Middlewick. This was against the consent of his father, because Violet had the bad taste to snub the retired tradesman, and considered vulgarity as the “unpardonable sin.”  _Mary Melrose_, Violet’s cousin, but without a penny. She marries Talbot Champneys; but his father, Sir Geoffrey, wanted him to marry Violet, the heiress.--H. J. Byron, _Our Boys_ (a comedy, 1875).   =Melusi´na=, the most famous of the _fées_ of France. Having enclosed her father in a mountain for offending her mother, she was condemned to become a serpent every Saturday. When she married the count of Lusignan, she made her husband vow never to visit her on that day, but the jealousy of the count made him break his vow. Melusina was, in consequence, obliged to leave her mortal husband, and roam about the world as a ghost till the day of doom. Some say the count immured her in the dungeon wall of his castle.--_Jean d’Arras_ (fourteenth century).  ⁂ The cry of despair given by the _fée_ when she discovered the indiscreet visit of her husband, is the origin of the phrase, _Un cri de Mélusine_ (“A shriek of despair”).   =Melvil= (_Sir John_), a young baronet, engaged to be married to Miss Sterling, the elder daughter of a City merchant, who promises to settle on her £800,000. A little before the marriage, Sir John finds that he has no regard for Miss Sterling, but a great love for her younger sister, Fanny, to whom he makes a proposal of marriage. His proposal is rejected; and it is soon brought to light that Miss Fanny had been clandestinely married to Lovewell for four months.--Colman and Garrick, _The Clandestine Marriage_ (1766).   =Melville= (_Major_), a magistrate at Cairnvreckan village.--Sir W.

Macklin, _The Man of the World_ (1764).  _Melville_ (_Julia_), a truly noble girl, in love with Faulkland, who is always jealous of her without a shadow of cause. She receives his innuendos without resentment, and treats him with sincerity and forbearance (see act i. 2).--Sheridan, _The Rivals_ (1775).   =Melyhalt= (_The Lady_), a powerful subject of King Arthur, whose domains Sir Galiot invaded; notwithstanding which the lady chose Sir Galiot as her fancy knight and chevalier.   =Memnon=, king of the Ethiopians. He went to the assistance of his uncle, Priam, and was slain by Achillês. His mother, Eos, inconsolable at his death, weeps for him every morning, and her tears constitute what we call dew.  _Memnon_, the black statue of King Amen´ophis III., at Thebes, in Egypt, which, being struck with the rays of the morning sun, gives out musical sounds. Kircher says these sounds are due to a sort of clavecin or Æolian harp enclosed in the statue, the cords of which are acted upon by the warmth of the sun. Cambyses, resolved to learn the secret, cleft the statue from head to waist; but it continued to utter its morning melody notwithstanding.  _Memnon_, “the mad lover,” general of As´torax, king of Paphos.--Beaumont and Fletcher, _The Mad Lover_ (1617).  _Memnon_, the title of a novel by Voltaire, the object of which is to show the folly of aspiring to too much wisdom.   =Memnon’s Sister.= He´mera, mentioned by Dictys Cretensis.      Black, but such as in esteem     Prince Memnon’s sister might beseem.      Milton, _Il Penseroso_ (1638).   =Memorable= (_The Ever-_), John Hales, of Eton (1584-1656).   =Memory.= The persons most noted for their memory are:  Magliabecchi, of Florence, called “The Universal Index and Living Cyclopædia” (1633-1714).  P. J. Beronicius, the Greek and Latin improvisator, who knew by heart Horace, Virgil, Cicero, Juvenal, both the Plinys, Homer, and Aristophănês. He died at Middleburgh, in 1676.  Andrew Fuller, after hearing 500 lines twice, could repeat them without a mistake. He could also repeat verbatim a sermon or speech; could tell either backwards or forwards every shop sign from the Temple to the extreme end of Cheapside, and the articles displayed in each of the shops.  “Memory” Woodfall could carry in his head a debate, and repeat it a fortnight afterwards.  “Memory” Thompson could repeat the names, trades, and particulars of every shop from Ludgate Hill to Piccadilly.  William Ratcliff, the husband of the novelist, could repeat a debate the next morning.  _Memory_ (_The Bard of_), Samuel Rogers, author of the _Pleasures of Memory_ (1762-1855).   =Men of Prester John’s Country.= Prester John, in his letter to Manuel Comnēnus, says his land is the home of men with horns; of one-eyed men (the eye being in some cases before the head, and in some cases behind it); of giants, forty ells in height (_i.e._ 120 feet); of the phœnix, etc.; and of ghouls who feed on premature children. He gives the names of fifteen different tributary states, amongst which are those of Gog and Magog (now shut in behind lofty mountains); but at the end of the world these fifteen states will overrun the whole earth.   =Menalcas=, any shepherd or rustic. The name occurs in the _Idylls_ of Theoc´ritos, the _Eclogues_ of Virgil, and the _Shepheardes Calendar_ of Spenser.   =Men´cia of Mosquera= (_Donna_) married Don Alvaro de Mello. A"]]]
