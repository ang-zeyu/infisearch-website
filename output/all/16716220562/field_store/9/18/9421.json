[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20857"],["title","Spacehounds of IPC (#1)"],["body"," are having one sweet time--we're being growled at on every trip. The management squawks if we're thirty seconds plus or minus at the terminals, and the passenger department squalls if we change acceleration five centimeters total en route--claims it upsets the dainty customers and loses business for the road. They're tightening up on us all the time. A couple of years ago, you remember, it didn't make any difference what we did with the acceleration as long as we checked in somewhere near zero time--we used to spin 'em dizzy when we reversed at the half-way station--but that kind of stuff doesn't go any more. We've got to hold the acceleration constant and close to normal, got to hold our schedule on zero, _plus_ or _minus_ ten seconds, and yet we've got to make any detours they tell us to, such as this seven-million kilometer thing they handed us just now. To make things worse, we've got to take orders at every check-station, and yet _we_ get the blame for everything that happens as a consequence of obeying those orders! Of course, I know as well as you do that it's rotten technique to change acceleration at every check-station; but we've told 'em over and over that we can't do any better until they put a real computer on every ship and tell the check-stations to report meteorites and other obstructions to us and then to let us alone. So you'd better recommend us some computers!\"  \"You're getting rotten computation, that's a sure thing, and I don't blame you pilots for yelling, but I don't believe that you've got the right answer. I can't help but think that the astronomers are lying down on the job. They are so sure that you pilots are to blame that it hasn't occurred to them to check up on themselves very carefully. However, we'll know pretty quick, and then we'll take steps.\"  \"I hope so--but say, Steve, I'm worried about using that much plus equilibrium power. Remember, we've got to hit M14 in absolutely good shape, or plenty heads will drop.\"  \"I'll say they will. I know just how the passengers will howl if we hold them weightless for half an hour, waiting for those two moons to get out of the way, and I know just what the manager will do if we check in minus thirty-one minutes. Wow! He'll swell up and bust, sure. But don't worry, Breck--if we don't check in all right, anybody can have my head that wants it, and I'm taking full responsibility, you know.\"  \"You're welcome to it.\" Breckenridge shrugged and turned the conversation into a lighter vein. \"Speaking of weightlessness, it's funny how many weight-fiends there are in the world, isn't it? You'd think the passengers would enjoy a little weightlessness occasionally--especially the fat ones--but they don't. But say, while I think of it, how come you were here and loose to make this check-up? I thought you were out with the other two of the Big Three, solving all the mysteries of the Universe?\"  \"Had to stay in this last trip--been doing some work on the ether, force-field theory, and other advanced stuff that I had to go to Mars and Venus to get. Just got back last week. As for solving mysteries, laugh while you can, old hyena. You and a lot of other dim bulbs think that Roeser's Rays are the last word--that there's nothing left to discover--are going to get jarred loose from your hinges one of these days. When I came in nine months ago they were hot on the trail of something big, and I'll bet they bring it in....\"  Out upon the dock an insistent siren blared a crescendo and diminuendo blast of sound, and two minutes remained. In every stateroom and in every lounge and saloon speakers sounded a warning:  \"For a short time, while we are pulling clear of the gravitational field of the Earth, walking will be somewhat difficult, as everything on board will apparently increase in weight by about one-fifth of its present amount. Please remain seated, or move about with caution. In about an hour weight will gradually return to normal. We start in one minute.\"  \"Hipe!\" barked the chief pilot as a flaring purple light sprang into being upon his board, and the assistants came to attention at their stations. \"Seconds! Four! Three! Two! One! LIFT!\" He touched a button and a set of plunger switches drove home, releasing into the forty-five enormous driving projectors the equilibrium power--the fifteen-thousand-and-odd kilofranks of energy that exactly counterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the mass of the cruiser. Simultaneously there was added from the potentiometer, already set to the exact figure given by the computer, the _plus_-equilibrium power--which would not be changed throughout the journey if the ideal acceleration curve were to be registered upon the recorders--and the immense mass of the cruiser of the void wafted vertically upward at a low and constant velocity. The bellowing, shrieking siren had cleared the air magically of the swarm of aircraft in her path, and quietly, calmly, majestically, the _Arcturus_ floated upward.         *       *       *       *       *  Breckenridge, sixty seconds after the initial lift, actuated the system of magnetic relays which would gradually cut in the precisely measured \"starting power,\" which it would be necessary to employ for sixty-nine minutes--for, without the acceleration given by this additional power, they would lose many precious hours of time in covering merely the few thousands of miles during which Earth's attraction would operate powerfully against their progress.  Faster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as more and more of the starting power was released, and heavier and heavier the passengers felt themselves become. Soon the full calculated power was on and the acceleration became constant. Weight no longer increased, but remained constant at a value of plus twenty three and six-tenths percent. For a few moments there had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers--perhaps a few of the first-trippers had been made ill--but it was not much worse than riding in a high-speed elevator, particularly since there was no change from positive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in express elevators.  The computer, his calculations complete, watched the pilot with interest, for, accustomed as he was to traversing the depths of space, there was a never-failing thrill to his scientific mind in the delicacy and precision of the work which Breckenridge was doing--work which could be done only by a man who had had long training in the profession and who was possessed of instantaneous nervous reaction and of the highest degree of manual dexterity and control. Under his right and left hands were the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-speed drives of the flight-angle directors in the hour and declination ranges; before his eyes was the finely marked micrometer screen upon which the guiding goniometer threw its needle-point of light; powerful optical systems of prisms and lenses revealed to his sight the director-angles, down to fractional seconds of arc. It was the task of the chief pilot to hold the screened image of the cross-hairs of the two directors in such position relative to the ever-moving point of light as to hold the mighty vessel precisely upon its course, in spite of the complex system of forces acting upon it.  For almost an hour Breckenridge sat motionless, his eyes flashing from micrometer screen to signal panel, his sensitive fingers moving the potentiometers through minute arcs because of what he saw upon the screen and in instantaneous response to the flashing, multi-colored lights and tinkling signals of his board. Finally, far from earth, the moon's attraction and other perturbing forces comparatively slight, the signals no longer sounded and the point of light ceased its irregular motion, becoming almost stationary. The chief pilot brought both cross-hairs directly upon the brilliant point, which for some time they had been approaching more and more nearly, adjusted the photo-cells and amplifiers which would hold them immovably upon it, and at the calculated second of time, cut out the starting power by means of another set of automatically timed relays. When only the regular driving power was left, and the acceleration had been checked and found to be exactly the designated value of 981.286 centimeters, he stood up and heaved a profound sigh of relief.  \"Well, Steve, that's over with--we're on our way. I'm always glad when this part of it is done.\"  \"It's a ticklish job, no fooling--even for an expert,\" the mathematician agreed. \"No wonder the astronomers think you birds are the ones who are gumming up their dope. Well, it's about time to plug in on E2. Here's where the fireworks start!\" He closed the connections which transferred the central portion of the upper lookout screen to a small micrometer screen at Breckenridge's desk and plugged it into the first check-station. Instantly a point of red light, surrounded by a vivid orange circle, appeared upon the screen, low down and to the left of center, and the timing galvanometer showed a wide positive deflection.  \"Hashed again!\" growled Breckenridge. \"I must be losing my grip, I guess. I put everything I had on that sight, and missed it ten divisions. I think I'll turn in my badge--I've cocked our perfect curve already, before we got to the first check-station!\" His hands moved toward the controls, to correct their course and acceleration.  \"As you were--hold everything! Lay off those controls!\" snapped the computer. \"There's something screwy, just as I thought--and it isn't you, either. I'm no pilot, of course, but I do know good compensation when I see it, and if you weren't compensating that point I never saw it done. Besides, with your skill and my figures I know darn well that we aren't off more than a tenth of one division. He's cuckoo! Don't call him--let him start it, and refer him to me.\"  \"All x--I'll be only too glad to pass the buck. But I still think, Steve, that you're playing with dynamite."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20857"],["title","Spacehounds of IPC (#2)"],["body"," Who ever heard of an astronomer being wrong?\"  \"You'd be surprised,\" grinned the physicist, \"Since this fuss has just started, nobody has tried to find out whether they were wrong or not....\"  \"IPV _Arcturus_, attention!\" came from the speaker curtly.  \"IPV _Arcturus_, Breckenridge,\" from the chief pilot.  \"You have been on my ray almost a minute. Why are you not correcting course and acceleration?\"  \"Doctor Stevens is computing us and has full control of course and acceleration,\" replied Breckenridge. \"He will answer you.\"  \"I am changing neither course nor acceleration because you are not in position,\" declared Stevens, crisply, \"Please give me your present supposed location, and your latest precision goniometer bearings on the sun, the moon, Mars, Venus, and your Tellurian reference limb, with exact time of observations, gyroscope zero-planes, and goniometer factors!\"  \"Correct at once or I shall report you to the Observatory,\" E2 answered loftily, paying no attention to the demand for proof of position.  \"Be sure you do that, guy--and while you're at it report that your station hasn't taken a precision bearing in a month. Report that you've been muddling along on radio loop bearings, and that you don't know where you are, within seven thousand kilometers. And speaking of reporting--I know already that a lot of you astronomical guessers have only the faintest possible idea of where you really are, _plus_, _minus_, or lateral; and if you don't get yourselves straightened out before we get to W41, I'm going to make a report on my own account that will jar some of you birds loose from your upper teeth!\" He unplugged with a vicious jerk, and turned to the pilot with a grin.  \"Guess that'll hold him for a while, won't it?\"  \"He'll report us, sure,\" remonstrated Breckenridge. The older man was plainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible check-stations.  \"Not that baby,\" returned the computer confidently. \"I'll bet you a small farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his goniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back into position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's always been there.\"  \"The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to them?\"  \"Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody anything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?\"  \"Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?\"  \"Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are altogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you. Another thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x. If so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all off on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every check-station. See?\"         *       *       *       *       *  True to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact center of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he began really to enjoy the trip.  \"How do we check on chronometers?\" asked P6 when Stevens had been introduced. \"By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds _plus_?\"  \"All x--two points four seconds plus--we're riding on 981.286 centimeters, to allow for the reversal and for minor detours. Bye.\"  \"All this may have been coincidence, Breck, but we'll find out pretty quick now,\" the computer remarked when the flying vessel was nearing the third check-station. \"Unless I'm all out of control we'll check in almost fourteen seconds minus on W41, and we may not even find him on the center block of the screen.\"  When he plugged in W41 was on the block, but was in the extreme upper right corner. They checked in thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on the station, and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned the accuracy of the location of the station and refused point-blank to correct his course.  \"Well, Breck, old onion, that tears it,\" Stevens declared as he unplugged. \"No use going any further on these bum reference points. I'm going to report to Newton--he'll rock the Observatory on its foundations!\" He plugged into the telegraph room. \"Have you got a free high-power wave?... Please put me on Newton, in the main office.\"  Moving lights flashed and flickered for an instant upon the communicator screen, settling down into a white glow which soon resolved itself into the likeness of a keen-eyed, gray-haired man, seated at his desk in the remote office of the Interplanetary Corporation. Newton smiled as he recognized the likeness of Stevens upon his own screen, and greeted him cordially.  \"Have you started your investigation, Doctor Stevens?\"  \"Started it? I've finished it!\" and Stevens tersely reported what he had learned, concluding: \"So you see, you don't need special computers on these ships any more than a hen needs teeth. You've got all the computers you need, in the observatories--all you've got to do is make them work at their trade.\"  \"The piloting was all x, then?\"  \"Absolutely--our curve so far is exactly flat ever since we cut off the starting power. Of course, all the pilots can't be as good as Breckenridge, but give them good computation and good check points and you shouldn't get any humps higher than about half a centimeter.\"  \"They'll get both, from now on,\" the director assured him. \"Thanks. If your work for the trip is done, you might show my little girl, Nadia, around the _Arcturus_. She's never been out before, and will be interested. Would you mind?\"  \"Glad to, Mr. Newton--I'll be a regular uncle to her.\"  \"Thanks again, Operator, I'll speak to Captain King, please.\"  \"Pipe down that guff, you unlicked cub, or I'll crown you with a proof-bar!\" the chief pilot growled, as soon as Stevens had unplugged.  \"You and who else?\" retorted the computer, cheerfully. \"Pipe down yourself, guy--if you weren't so darn dumb and didn't have such a complex, you'd know that you're the crack pilot of the outfit and wouldn't care who else knew it.\" Stevens carefully covered and put away the calculating machine and other apparatus he had been using and turned again to the pilot.  \"I didn't know Newton had any kids, especially little ones, or I'd have got acquainted with them long ago. Of course I don't know him very well, since I never was around the office much, but the old tiger goes over big with me.\"  \"Hm--m. Think you'll enjoy playing nursemaid all the rest of the trip?\" Breckenridge asked caustically, but with an enigmatic smile.  \"Think so? I _know_ so!\" replied Stevens, positively. \"I always did like kids, and they always did like me--we fall for each other like ten thousand bricks falling down a well. Why, a kid--_any_ kid--and I team up just like grace and poise.... What's gnawing on you anyway, to make you turn Cheshire cat all of a sudden? By the looks of that grin I'd say you had swallowed a canary of mine some way or other; but darned if I know that I've lost any,\" and he stared at his friend suspiciously.  \"To borrow your own phrase, Steve, 'You'd be surprised,'\" and Breckenridge, though making no effort to conceal his amusement, would say no more.  In a few minutes the door opened, and through it there stepped a grizzled four-striper. Almost hidden behind his massive form there was a girl, who ran up to Breckenridge and seized both his hands, her eyes sparkling.  \"Hi, Breckie, you old darling! I knew that if we both kept after him long enough Dad would let me ride with you sometime. Isn't this _gorgeous_?\"  Stevens was glad indeed that the girl's enthusiastic greeting of the pilot was giving him time to recover from his shock, for Director Newton's \"little girl, Nadia\" was not precisely what he had led himself to expect. Little she might be, particularly when compared with the giant frame of Captain King, or with Steve's own five-feet-eleven of stature and the hundred and ninety pounds of rawhide and whalebone that was his body, but child she certainly was not. Her thick, fair hair, cut in the square bob that was the mode of the moment, indicated that Nature had intended her to be a creamy blonde, but as she turned to be introduced to him, Stevens received another surprise--for she was one of those rare, but exceedingly attractive beings, a natural blonde with brown eyes and black eyebrows. Sun and wind had tanned her satin skin to a smooth and even shade of brown, and every movement of her lithe and supple body bespoke to the discerning mind a rigidly-trained physique.  \"Doctor Stevens, you haven't met Miss Newton, I hear,\" the captain introduced them informally. \"All the officers who are not actually tied down at their posts are anxious to do the honors of the vessel, but as I have received direct orders from the owners, I am turning her over to you--you are to show her around.\"  \"Thanks, Captain, I won't mutiny a bit against such an order. I'm mighty glad to know you, Miss Newton.\"  \"I've heard a lot about you, Doctor. Dad and Breckie here are always talking about the Big Three--what you have done and what you are going to do. I want to meet Doctor Brandon and Doctor Westfall, too,\" and her hand met his in a firm and friendly clasp. She turned to the captain, and Stevens, noticing that the pilot, with a quizzical expression, was about to say something, silenced him with a fierce aside.  \"Clam it, ape, or I'll climb up you like a squirrel!\" he hissed, and the grinning Breckenridge nodded assent to this demand for silence concerning children and nursemaids.  \"Since you've never been out, Miss Newton, you'll want to see the whole works,\" Stevens addressed the girl. \"Where do you want to begin? Shall we start at the top and work down?\"  \"All right with me,\" she agreed, and fell into step beside him. She was dressed in dove-gray from head to foot--toque, blouse, breeches, heavy stockings, and shoes were of the one shade of smooth, lustrous silk; and as they strolled together down the passage-way, "]]]
