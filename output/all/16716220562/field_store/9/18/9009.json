It showed a curious tendency to creep into the conversation.  \"I want you to give me your undivided attention for a moment,\" said Ukridge. \"I was saying to my wife only the other day: 'Garnet's the man. Clever man, Garnet. Full of ideas.' Didn't I, Millie?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, smiling.  \"Well?\" said Garnet.  \"The fact is,\" said Ukridge, with a Micawber-like burst of candor, \"we are going to keep fowls.\"  He stopped and looked at Garnet in order to see the effect of the information. Garnet bore it with fortitude.  \"Yes?\" he said.  Ukridge shifted himself farther on to the table and upset the inkpot.  \"Never mind,\" he said, \"it'll soak in. Don't you worry about that, you keep listening to me. When I said we meant to keep fowls, I didn't mean in a small sort of way--two cocks and a couple of hens and a ping-pong ball for a nest egg. We are going to do it on a large scale. We are going to keep,\" he concluded impressively, \"a chicken farm!\"  \"A chicken farm,\" echoed Mrs. Ukridge with an affectionate and admiring glance at her husband.  \"Ah,\" said Garnet, who felt his responsibilities as chorus.  \"I've thought it all out,\" continued Ukridge, \"and it's as clear as mud. No expenses, large profits, quick returns. Chickens, eggs, and no work. By Jove, old man, it's the idea of a lifetime. Just listen to me for a moment. You buy your hen--\"  \"One hen?\" inquired Garnet.  \"Call it one for the sake of argument. It makes my calculations clearer. Very well, then. You buy your hen. It lays an egg every day of the week. You sell the eggs--say--six for fivepence. Keep of hen costs nothing. Profit at least fourpence, three farthings on every half-dozen eggs. What do you think of that, Bartholomew?\"  Garnet admitted that it sounded like an attractive scheme, but expressed a wish to overhaul the figures in case of error.  \"Error!\" shouted Ukridge, pounding the table with such energy that it groaned beneath him. \"Error? Not a bit of it. Can't you follow a simple calculation like that? The thing is, you see, you get your original hen for next to nothing. That's to say, on tick. Anybody will let you have a hen on tick. Now listen to me for a moment. You let your hen set, and hatch chickens. Suppose you have a dozen hens. Very well, then. When each of the dozen has a dozen chickens, you send the old hens back with thanks for the kind loan, and there you are, starting business with a hundred and forty-four free chickens to your name. And after a bit, when the chickens grow up and begin to lay, all you have to do is to sit back in your chair and gather in the big checks. Isn't that so, Millie?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge with shining eyes.  \"We've fixed it all up. Do you know Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire? On the borders of Devon. Quiet little fishing village. Bathing. Sea air. Splendid scenery. Just the place for a chicken farm. I've been looking after that. A friend of my wife's has lent us a jolly old house with large grounds. All we've got to do is to get in the fowls. That's all right. I've ordered the first lot. We shall find them waiting for us when we arrive.\"  \"Well,\" said Garnet, \"I'm sure I wish you luck. Mind you let me know how you get on.\"  \"Let you know!\" roared Ukridge. \"Why, old horse, you've got to come, too. We shall take no refusal. Shall we, Millie?\"  \"No, dear,\" murmured Mrs. Ukridge.  \"Of course not,\" said Ukridge. \"No refusal of any sort. Pack up to-night, and meet us at Waterloo to-morrow.\"  \"It's awfully good of you--\" began Garnet a little blankly.  \"Not a bit of it, not a bit of it. This is pure business. I was saying to my wife when we came in that you were the very man for us. 'If old Garnet's in town,' I said, 'we'll have him. A man with his flow of ideas will be invaluable on a chicken farm.' Didn't I, Millie?\"  Mrs. Ukridge murmured the response.  \"You see, I'm one of these practical men. I go straight ahead, following my nose. What you want in a business of this sort is a touch of the dreamer to help out the practical mind. We look to you for suggestions, Montmorency. Timely suggestions with respect to the comfort and upbringing of the fowls. And you can work. I've seen you. Of course you take your share of the profits. That's understood. Yes, yes, I must insist. Strict business between friends. We must arrange it all when we get down there. My wife is the secretary of the firm. She has been writing letters to people, asking for fowls. So you see it's a thoroughly organized concern. There's money in it, old horse. Don't you forget that.\"  \"We should be so disappointed if you did not come,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, lifting her childlike eyes to Garnet's face.  Garnet stood against the mantelpiece and pondered. In after years he recognized that that moment marked an epoch in his life. If he had refused the invitation, he would not have--but, to quote the old novelists, we anticipate. At any rate, he would have missed a remarkable experience. It is not given to everyone to see Mr. Stanley Ukridge manage a chicken farm.  \"The fact is,\" he said at last, \"I was thinking of going somewhere where I could get some golf.\"  Ukridge leaped on the table triumphantly.  \"Lyme Regis is just the place for you, then. Perfect hotbed of golf. Fine links at the top of the hill, not half a mile from the farm. Bring your clubs. You'll be able to have a round or two in the afternoons. Get through serious work by lunch time.\"  \"You know,\" said Garnet, \"I am absolutely inexperienced as regards fowls.\"  \"Excellent!\" said Ukridge. \"Then you're just the man. You will bring to the work a mind entirely unclouded by theories. You will act solely by the light of your intelligence.\"  \"Er--yes,\" said Garnet.  \"I wouldn't have a professional chicken farmer about the place if he paid to come. Natural intelligence is what we want. Then we can rely on you?\"  \"Very well,\" said Garnet slowly. \"It's very kind of you to ask me.\"  \"It's business, Cuthbert, business. Very well, then. We shall catch the eleven-twenty at Waterloo. Don't miss it. You book to Axminster. Look out for me on the platform. If I see you first, I'll shout.\"  Garnet felt that that promise rang true.  \"Then good-by for the present. Millie, we must be off. Till to-morrow, Garnet.\"  \"Good-by, Mr. Garnet,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.  Looking back at the affair after the lapse of years, Garnet was accustomed to come to the conclusion that she was the one pathetic figure in the farce. Under what circumstances she had married Ukridge he did not learn till later. He was also uncertain whether at any moment in her career she regretted it. But it was certainly pathetic to witness her growing bewilderment during the weeks that followed, as the working of Ukridge's giant mind was unfolded to her little by little. Life, as Ukridge understood the word, must have struck her as a shade too full of incident to be really comfortable. Garnet was wont to console himself by the hope that her very genuine love for her husband, and his equally genuine love for her, was sufficient to smooth out the rough places of life.  As he returned to his room, after showing his visitors to the door, the young man upstairs, who had apparently just finished breakfast, burst once more into song:      \"We'll never come back no more, boys,       We'll never come back no more.\"  Garnet could hear him wedding appropriate dance to the music.  \"Not for a few weeks, at any rate,\" he said to himself, as he started his packing at the point where he had left off.     A GIRL WITH BROWN HAIR  III   Waterloo station is one of the things which no fellow can understand. Thousands come to it, thousands go from it. Porters grow gray-headed beneath its roof. Buns, once fresh and tender, become hard and misanthropic in its refreshment rooms, and look as if they had seen the littleness of existence and were disillusioned. But there the station stands, year after year, wrapped in a discreet gloom, always the same, always baffling and inscrutable. Not even the porters understand it. \"I couldn't say, sir,\" is the civil but unsatisfying reply with which research is met. Now and then one, more gifted than his colleagues, will inform the traveler that his train starts from \"No. 3 or No. 7,\" but a moment's reflection and he hedges with No. 12.  Waterloo is the home of imperfect knowledge. The booking clerks cannot state in a few words where tickets may be bought for any station. They are only certain that they themselves cannot sell them.         *       *       *       *       *  The gloom of the station was lightened on the following morning at ten minutes to eleven when Mr. Garnet arrived to catch the train to Axminster, by several gleams of sunshine and a great deal of bustle and movement on the various platforms. A cheery activity pervaded the place. Porters on every hand were giving their celebrated imitations of the car of Juggernaut, throwing as a sop to the wounded a crisp \"by your leave.\" Agitated ladies were pouring forth questions with the rapidity of machine guns. Long queues surged at the mouths of the booking offices, inside which soured clerks, sending lost sheep empty away, were learning once more their lesson of the innate folly of mankind. Other crowds collected at the bookstalls, and the bookstall keeper was eying with dislike men who were under the impression that they were in a free library.  An optimistic porter had relieved Garnet of his portmanteau and golf clubs as he stepped out of his cab, and had arranged to meet him on No. 6 platform, from which, he asserted, with the quiet confidence which has made Englishmen what they are, the eleven-twenty would start on its journey to Axminster. Unless, he added, it went from No. 4.  Garnet, having bought a ticket, after drawing blank at two booking offices, made his way to the bookstall. Here he inquired, in a loud, penetrating voice, if they had got \"Mr. Jeremy Garnet's last novel, 'The Maneuvers of Arthur.'\" Being informed that they had not, he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],["title","Love Among the Chickens (#3)"],["body","his tongue cynically, advised the man in charge to order that work, as the demand for it might be expected shortly to be large, and spent a shilling on a magazine and some weekly papers. Then, with ten minutes to spare, he went off in search of Ukridge.  He found him on platform No. 6. The porter's first choice was, it seemed, correct. The eleven-twenty was already alongside the platform, and presently Garnet observed his porter cleaving a path toward him with the portmanteau and golf clubs.  \"Here you are!\" shouted Ukridge. \"Good for you. Thought you were going to miss it.\"  Garnet shook hands with the smiling Mrs. Ukridge.  \"I've got a carriage,\" said Ukridge, \"and collared two corner seats. My wife goes down in another. She dislikes the smell of smoke when she's traveling. Let's pray that we get the carriage to ourselves. But all London seems to be here this morning. Get in, old horse. I'll just see her ladyship into her carriage and come back to you.\"  Garnet entered the compartment, and stood at the door, looking out in order, after the friendly manner of the traveling Briton, to thwart an invasion of fellow-travelers. Then he withdrew his head suddenly and sat down. An elderly gentleman, accompanied by a girl, was coming toward him. It was not this type of fellow-traveler whom he hoped to keep out. He had noticed the girl at the booking office. She had waited by the side of the line, while the elderly gentleman struggled gamely for the tickets, and he had plenty of opportunity of observing her appearance. For five minutes he had debated with himself as to whether her hair should rightly be described as brown or golden. He had decided finally on brown. It then became imperative that he should ascertain the color of her eyes. Once only had he met them, and then only for a second. They might be blue. They might be gray. He could not be certain. The elderly gentleman came to the door of the compartment and looked in.  \"This seems tolerably empty, my dear Phyllis,\" he said.  Garnet, his glance fixed on his magazine, made a note of the name. It harmonized admirably with the hair and the eyes of elusive color.  \"You are sure you do not object to a smoking carriage, my dear?\"  \"Oh, no, father. Not at all.\"  Garnet told himself that the voice was just the right sort of voice to go with the hair, the eyes, and the name.  \"Then I think--\" said the elderly gentleman, getting in. The inflection of his voice suggested the Irishman. It was not a brogue. There were no strange words. But the general effect was Irish. Garnet congratulated himself. Irishmen are generally good company. An Irishman with a pretty daughter should be unusually good company.  The bustle on the platform had increased momently, until now, when, from the snorting of the engine, it seemed likely that the train might start at any minute, the crowd's excitement was extreme. Shrill cries echoed down the platform. Lost sheep, singly and in companies, rushed to and fro, peering eagerly into carriages in the search for seats. Piercing cries ordered unknown \"Tommies\" and \"Ernies\" to \"keep by aunty, now.\" Just as Ukridge returned, the dreaded \"Get in anywhere\" began to be heard, and the next moment an avalanche of warm humanity poured into the carriage. A silent but bitter curse framed itself on Garnet's lips. His chance of pleasant conversation with the lady of the brown hair and the eyes that were either gray or blue was at an end.  The newcomers consisted of a middle-aged lady, addressed as aunty; a youth called Albert, subsequently described by Garnet as the rudest boy on earth--a proud title, honestly won; lastly, a niece of some twenty years, stolid and seemingly without interest in life.  Ukridge slipped into his corner, adroitly foiling Albert, who had made a dive in that direction. Albert regarded him fixedly for a space, then sank into the seat beside Garnet and began to chew something grewsome that smelled of aniseed.  Aunty, meanwhile, was distributing her weight evenly between the toes of the Irish gentleman and those of his daughter, as she leaned out of the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw hat and hair curlers. Phyllis, he noticed, was bearing it with angelic calm. Her profile, when he caught sight of it round aunty, struck him as a little cold, even haughty. That, however, might be due to what she was suffering. It is unfair to judge a lady's character from her face, at a moment when she is in a position of physical discomfort. The train moved off with a jerk in the middle of a request on the part of the straw-hatted lady that her friend would \"remember that, you know, about _him_,\" and aunty, staggering back, sat down on a bag of food which Albert had placed on the seat beside him.  \"Clumsy!\" observed Albert tersely.  \"Al_bert_, you mustn't speak to aunty so.\"  \"Wodyer want sit on my bag for, then?\" inquired Albert.  They argued the point.  Garnet, who should have been busy studying character for a novel of the lower classes, took up his magazine and began to read. The odor of aniseed became more and more painful. Ukridge had lighted a cigar, and Garnet understood why Mrs. Ukridge preferred to travel in another compartment. For \"in his hand he bore the brand which none but he might smoke.\"  Garnet looked stealthily across the carriage to see how his lady of the hair and eyes was enduring this combination of evils, and noticed that she, too, had begun to read. And as she put down the book to look out of the window at the last view of London, he saw with a thrill that it was \"The Maneuvers of Arthur.\" Never before had he come upon a stranger reading his work. And if \"The Maneuvers of Arthur\" could make the reader oblivious to surroundings such as these, then, felt Garnet, it was no common book--a fact which he had long since suspected.  The train raced on toward the sea. It was a warm day, and a torpid peace began to settle down on the carriage.  Soon only Garnet, the Irishman, and the lady were awake.  \"What's your book, me dear?\" asked the Irishman.  \"'The Maneuvers of Arthur,' father,\" said Phyllis. \"By Jeremy Garnet.\"  Garnet would not have believed without the evidence of his ears that his name could possibly have sounded so well.  \"Dolly Strange gave it to me when I left the abbey,\" continued Phyllis. \"She keeps a shelf of books for her guests when they are going away. Books that she considers rubbish and doesn't want, you know.\"  Garnet hated Dolly Strange without further evidence.  \"And what do you think of it, me dear?\"  \"I like it,\" said Phyllis decidedly. The carriage swam before Garnet's eyes. \"I think it is very clever. I shall keep it.\"  \"Bless you,\" thought Garnet, \"and I will write my precious autograph on every page, if you want it.\"  \"I wonder who Jeremy Garnet is?\" said Phyllis. \"I imagine him rather an old young man, probably with an eyeglass and conceited. He must be conceited. I can tell that from the style. And I should think he didn't know many girls. At least, if he thinks Pamela Grant an ordinary sort of girl.\"  \"Is she not?\" asked her father.  \"She's a cr-r-reature,\" said Phyllis emphatically.  This was a blow to Garnet, and demolished the self-satisfaction which her earlier criticisms had caused to grow within him. He had always looked on Pamela as something very much out of the ordinary run of feminine character studies. That scene between her and the curate in the conservatory.... And when she finds Arthur at the meet of the Blankshire.... He was sorry she did not like Pamela. Somehow it lowered Pamela in his estimation.  \"But I like Arthur,\" said Phyllis, and she smiled--the first time Garnet had seen her do so.  Garnet also smiled to himself. Arthur was the hero. He was a young writer. Ergo, Arthur was himself.  The train was beginning to slow down. Signs of returning animation began to be noticeable among the sleepers. A whistle from the engine, and the train drew up in a station. Looking out of the window, Garnet saw that it was Yeovil. There was a general exodus. Aunty became instantly a thing of dash and electricity, collected parcels, shook Albert, replied to his thrusts with repartee, and finally headed a stampede out of the door.  To Garnet's chagrin the Irish gentleman and his daughter also rose. Apparently this was to be the end of their brief acquaintanceship. They alighted and walked down the platform.  \"Where are we?\" said Ukridge sleepily, opening his eyes. \"Yeovil? Not far now, old horse.\"  With which remark he closed his eyes again and returned to his slumbers.  Garnet's eye, roving disconsolately over the carriage, was caught by something lying in the far corner. It was the criticized \"Maneuvers of Arthur.\" The girl had left it behind.  What follows shows the vanity that obsesses our young and rising authors. It did not enter into his mind that the book might have been left behind of set purpose, as being of no further use to the owner. It only occurred to him that if he did not act swiftly the lady of the hair and eyes would suffer a loss beside which the loss of a purse or a hand bag were trivial.  He acted swiftly.  Five seconds later he was at the end of the platform, flushed but courteous.  \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"I think--\"  \"Thank you,\" said the girl.  Garnet made his way back to his carriage.  \"They are blue,\" he said.     THE ARRIVAL  IV   From Axminster to Lyme Regis the line runs through country as pretty as any that can be found in the island, and the train, as if in appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. It was late afternoon by the time the chicken farmers reached their destination.  The arrangements for the carrying of luggage at Lyme Regis border on the primitive. Boxes are left on the platform, and later, when he thinks of it, a carrier looks in and conveys them down into the valley and up the hill on the opposite side to the address written on the labels. The owner walks. Lyme Regis is not a place for the halt and maimed.  Ukridge led"]]]
