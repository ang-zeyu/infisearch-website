And do you know just what God is?\"  \"My dear!\" in a shocked tone, \"no one can tell. It is one of the mysteries to be revealed when we see Him as He truly is at the last day. A little girl cannot understand it. I do not, and I have sought the truth many years. Now I am trusting, because I feel assured He will do what is right. Tell me something about your life with your father.\"  \"Oh, things were so different there. Houses, and there were always servants, so you didn't ever need to fan yourself. Babo and Nalla were always about. Babo used to take me out in a chair that had curtains around and a big umbrella overhead. Sometimes Chandra went with him. And the streets were funny and crooked, and houses set anywhere in them. I liked going up in the mountains best, it wasn't so hot. And the trees were splendid, and beautiful vines and flowers of all sorts. Mrs. Dallas went the last time. She had two girls and a big boy. I did not like him. He would pinch my arms and then say he didn't. I liked the girls, one was larger than I. And we swung in the hammocks the vines made. Only I was afraid of the snakes, and there are so many everywhere. Alfred liked to kill them.\"  She shuddered a little and glanced about the room with dilated eyes.  \"They come into your houses sometimes. Nalla used to catch them and sling them hard on the ground, and that stunned them. And we used to make wreaths of the beautiful flowers. Agnes Dallas knew so many stories about fairies, little people who come out at night, when the moon shines, and dance round in rings. They slip in houses, and the nice ones do some work, but the wicked ones sour the milk, and spoil the bread, and hide things. And, sometimes, they change children into a cat, or a rabbit, or something, and it is seven years before you can get your own shape again. Do you have them here?\"  \"There is no such thing. That is all falsehood,\" was the decisive comment.  \"But--Agnes knew of their coming. And she had seen them dancing on the grass. But if you speak or go near them, they disappear.\"  Miss Winn came out to the sitting-room.  \"Oh, you are here,\" she said. \"I thought you were out of doors. You ought to take a run. What a wonderful garret you have upstairs, Miss Eunice. But I am afraid we shall fill it up sadly. There were so many things to bring. I do not believe we shall find use for half of them. I want a few mouthfuls of fresh air. I suppose I can walk up the street without danger of getting lost if I turn square around when I return? Don't you want to come, Cynthia?\"  Cynthia was ready.  \"You had better wrap up warm. It gets chilly towards night.\"  \"It was a long stretch on shipboard. We stopped at several ports, however. But I am glad to be on solid ground. Come, child.\"  She had brought down a wrap and hood. Cynthia was glad of something new, though she liked Miss Eunice.  They turned a rather rounding corner and went on to a sort of market-place, where sweepers were gathering up the d√©bris after the day's sales. They glanced about the city. Salem had made rapid strides since the grand declaration of peace, but at the end of the century it was far from the grandeur the next twenty years would give it.  \"There are no palaces and no temples,\" said Cynthia, rather complainingly. \"And how white all the people are. Do you suppose they have been ill?\"  \"Oh, no; they have been housed up during the winter, and the climate is cold. And, you know, they are of a different race. This part, New England, was settled mostly from old England.\"  \"Are you going to like it, Rachel?\"  \"Why--I don't quite know. You can't tell at once about a strange place.\"  \"Miss Eunice is nice. But she has some queer ideas.\"  \"Or is it a little girl, named Cynthia Leverett, who has queer ideas that she has brought largely from a far-off country?\"  The child laughed. Then she saw some girls and boys playing tag in the street, laughing and squealing when they were caught, or when they narrowly missed. And some empty carts went rattling by, with now and then a stately coach, or a man on horseback, attired in the fashion of the times. The sun suddenly dropped down.  \"We had better turn about,\" declared Miss Winn. \"It will not do to be late for supper.\"  The walk had not been straight, but her gift of locality was good. They passed the market-place again, made the winding turn, and found the lighted lamps gave the house a cheerful aspect.  Miss Eunice had put away her knotting and begun to lay the cloth when Elizabeth entered, her face clouded over.  \"I'm sure I don't see why Providence should send this avalanche upon us to destroy our peace and comfort,\" she began almost angrily. \"The Thatchers' visit was pleasant, though that made a sight of clearing up afterward. And we had hardly gotten over that when this must happen. I was going to put that white quilt in the frame, but the garret will be turned upside down for no one knows how long! Such a mess of stuff, and more coming. There's enough in this house without any more being added to it.\"  \"But it was natural Captain Anthony should want his child to have something belonging to him, maybe her mother, too. And goodness knows there's room enough in the garret. It isn't half full with his traps, and there's some of ours. And there's the loft over the kitchen.\"  \"Well, we want some place to dry clothes in rainy weather. And when I sweep I want to move things about, not sweep just in front of them, and have the dust settle in rows behind. Chilian didn't know what a lot there would be, though he might have looked it over on the ship. When it is all through, the house will need a thorough cleaning again. And what _do_ you think, Eunice! She's going to put the child in that big bed and she sleep in the little one! The best room in the house! I'm sorry they have it.\"  Eunice was roused a little.  \"That doesn't seem the proper thing. But maybe she thought--I do suppose the child has had the best of everything.\"  \"I don't believe in pampering children. And I don't altogether like the woman. I do wonder if we will have to keep her. A girl of nine is old enough to look after herself, and begin to keep her own clothes and her room in order.\"  \"It's been very different out in India. And I do suppose Anthony was over-indulgent, she having no mother to train her.\"  \"We'll have our hands full, Eunice, when the tussle really begins.\"  \"Oh, I do not think she will be hard to manage. She seems rather shy----\"  \"Those eyes of hers ain't so deep for nothing. She hasn't the Leverett mouth, and those full lips are wilful and saucy, generally speaking. Letty Orne was a pretty girl, as I remember. Strange, now, when you come to think of it, that the child should have been born in this house. But she'll never have any beauty to spare, that's certain. For the land sakes, Eunice, look at the time and you dawdling over the table. I'm tired as a dog after a long race.\"  Elizabeth dropped into a chair. In her secret heart Eunice knew that when her sister was tired out she was fractious; she loved her too well to say cross words.  \"Shall we have fish or cold meat?\" she asked mildly.  \"Oh, I don't care! Well, fish. There will be meat enough for to-morrow's dinner if it isn't meddled with.\"  The fish was salted down in the season, soaked a little, laid in spiced vinegar for a few hours, cut in thin slices, and was very appetizing. Eunice went about with no useless flutter, she stepped lightly and never made any clatter with dishes. The tea china, thin and lovely, the piles of white bread and brown, molasses gingerbread and frosted sugar cake, stewed dried fruit and rich preserves, made an inviting-looking table. Chilian came in and made himself neat, as usual, then the guests.  Cynthia was very quiet. Twice Miss Winn answered a question for her. She scarcely ate anything. Then she said wearily:  \"I am so tired and sleepy. Can't I go to bed?\"     CHAPTER IV  UNWELCOME   Miss Winn and her charge went down to the ship the next morning with Chilian Leverett. Elizabeth inspected the rooms. She was not meddlesome, nor over-curious generally, but with a feeling of possessorship and responsibility in the house, she wanted to know how far she could trust the newcomers. The beds were well made, but closets and drawers were rather awry. She did begrudge the best chamber, and wondered whether it would not be possible to change them about presently. True, they seldom had guests.  Then a new load of boxes came, with two trunks, and several more pieces of furniture. The latter were left standing in the hall. The garret had been a sort of fetich with Elizabeth. There were dried herbs hanging to the rafters in their muslin bags, so as not to make a litter and mostly for the fragrance. There was not a cobweb anywhere. On one side of the sloping roof were ranged their own trunks and chests, two of cedar, in which woollen clothes and blankets passed the summer, securely hidden from moths. In one gable were miscellaneous household articles, a few chairs good enough to be repaired, a more than century-old cherry table, spinning-wheels, a bedstead piled high with a feather bed, and numberless pillows, for Elizabeth thought it her duty to make a new pair every year, as they kept a flock of geese that spent their days in a small cove on South River.  The interloper boxes could make a row down the cleared side. That left the centre, the highest part, clear for drying clothes, which probably would not be needed until winter. But careful Elizabeth planned ahead for every emergency. True, the emergency did not always fit the plans, but it gave her tense spirit a rest.  The Salem air was fragrant, with all manner of sweet springtime odors--the ship was not. Things that had been stored in the hold came up with a certain old smell and a little mustiness. First, Cynthia held her nose and made a wry face. But it was delightful to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20722"],["title","A Little Girl in Old Salem (#7)"],["body","about and exchange greetings with the sailors, who seemed merry enough over their work.  \"Well, missy,\" said the captain, catching her in his arms as she ran, \"how do you like living on dry land? You haven't lost your sea legs yet, that's plain.\"  \"It's very queer. There are just tiny leaves coming out on the trees, and a few curious white flowers, little bells, coming up in the garden, and crocus in pretty colors. But I don't like it very much. Miss Eunice is nice and has such a soft voice. And the houses are so funny and shut up, and there are no servants about, nor any one praying on the corners and holding out a basin for rice; and no piles of fruit for sale.\"  \"No; this isn't the time of year for fruit;\" and there was a funny twinkle in the captain's eye. \"Just wait until August and September.\"  Cynthia considered. \"That is three and four months away. Father will be here then;\" with a child's confidence.  \"And there are berries earlier, and cherries, and then some sugar pears. Oh, you will be feasted. And you'll like Cousin Leverett, when you come to get acquainted with him. You will go to school, too, and know lots of little girls. You won't want to go back to India.\"  \"Unless father shouldn't come. Oh, he surely will, because, you see, I'm praying ever so many times a day.\"  \"That's right;\" with a cheerful nod.  \"When are you going back?\"  \"In about a month, I calculate.\"  She sighed and looked out over the great stretch of waters. \"What is that long point down there?\" she asked suddenly.  \"That's Salem Neck, and there is Winter Island. They are always building ships down there and turn out some mighty fine ones. And fishing; there's a sight of cod, and haddock, and mackerel, and all the other fish in season. They salt them and take them half over the world. And there's a rope-walk you'd enjoy seeing, leastways you would if you were a boy. And there are some stores. We have lots of goods consigned to the Merrits. Salem's a big place, now I tell you!\"  \"Bigger than Calcutta?\"  \"Sho' now! Calcutta can't hold a candle to it.\"  The captain's cabin was being dismantled for repairs and cleaning. She glanced in it. How many days she had spent here! Everything was in disorder, yet there was a certain home remembrance that touched the child's heart, and brought tears to her eyes.  \"Oh, are you here?\" It was Chilian Leverett's voice, and he held out his hand. She looked so bright now and there was a little color in her cheeks, an eager interest about her. He was afraid she was going to be a rather dull child.  \"Yes; it's almost like home, you know; only when we lived here it wasn't so topsy-turvy.\"  \"Did you feel queer when you woke up this morning?\" thinking it his duty to smile.  \"Oh, I didn't know where I was. It seemed as if I was being smothered in something. And it didn't toss and rock. Oh, there were some birds singing.\" She laughed gleefully. \"Then I saw Rachel, and it came to me in little bits, but it seems such a long, long while since yesterday morning.\"  \"Where is Miss Winn? I want to see her a moment.\"  \"She has been looking over some things as they came up from the hold,\" said the captain. \"Oh, here she is!\"  Chilian took her aside for a moment. It was necessary for him to go in to Boston and he wanted to make a few suggestions, so that any of Elizabeth's strictures might not offend. He began to perceive the child and her attendant were not exactly welcome guests.  \"How long do you suppose she will stay?\" Elizabeth had asked of him rather sharply. \"For, when we are once settled, I do not think there will be any real necessity for keeping Miss Winn.\"  She had been considering it at intervals through the night, and was impatient for what she called an understanding.  Chilian had often given in to her on points that did not really affect him. He hated to bicker with any one, especially women.  \"My dear Elizabeth,\" he began, \"the child has been consigned to my charge until she comes of age. I should not have chosen the guardianship, but it seems there is no other relative who can attend to all matters as well. She is to be no dependent, only for whatever love we choose to give her. Anthony has made an ample allowance for her, indeed such a generous one that it irks me to accept it. If it makes too much work for you and Eunice, we will have some help. Miss Winn is to look after her, that was her father's wish; so there will be no change. Of course, it alters our quiet mode of living, but perhaps we were getting in too much of a rut and needed some shaking up;\" smiling gravely. \"Try and make it as comfortable for them as you can. There is plenty of room in the house for us all.\"  Then there was nothing before them but acceptance. In a way she had known it, but there was a vague idea seething in her mind that if the maid could be dismissed, she and her sister could train the child in a better manner, and instil some Salem virtues in her that yet held a little of the old Puritanic leaven; like industry, economy, forethought. She still believed in the strait and narrow pathway.  That Chilian should take the matter so philosophically _did_ surprise her. To him there seemed something so pitiful in the hope held out to the little girl, yet after all could it have been managed any more wisely? She would not know what the acute pang of death was. And her longing would become less, there would be a vagueness in her sorrow that would help to heal it. This would be her home. He had been living all these years for himself, was it not time that he espoused some other motive? That he began to be of real service?  He finished his talk with Miss Winn. Cynthia was hopping over some coils of cable, and he watched her agile, graceful movements, half smiling.  \"Come and tell me good-bye,\" he said, holding out his hand. \"I am going in to Boston.\"  \"In a vessel?\"  \"No; though I suppose that would be possible. I am late for the stage, and must go on horseback.\"  \"Where is Boston?\"  \"Oh, some eighteen miles--rather southerly. It is a big city, and the capital.\"  \"When are you coming back?\" with a daintily anxious air.  \"Oh, by supper-time.\"  \"Well;\" nodding.  \"What shall I bring you?\"  \"Nothing at all. We have twice too much now, Rachel says. Only--be sure to come back.\"  \"If I did not, what then?\"  \"If you did not come back, I should go to India with Captain Corwin. I like Miss Eunice a little, but your other lady doesn't want me,\" she replied with a frankness that was amusing, it was so free from malice.  \"Good-bye until to-night, then.\"  She put her hand in his. Then she reached up tiptoe. \"Kiss me,\" she said. \"Father always did and he said, 'Be a good girl.'\"  \"Be a good girl.\" Chilian kissed the soft red lips and then went his way. There was not much caressing in the restrained New England nature of that day, especially among those who had grown up with few family ties. His mother had died while he was yet quite a boy.  \"Let us go back now,\" said Rachel presently. \"I believe I have found all our goods. Miss Leverett will be appalled.\"  The child repeated the word. \"What does it mean?\" she asked.  \"Astonished, surprised.\"  \"Why, _they_ have a houseful of things;\" in protest.  \"Then there is the less room for ours.\"  \"But there is ever so much room in the garret.\"  \"I almost wish we were going to live by ourselves in a little house, like some we saw yesterday.\"  \"Who would cook the dinner and wash the dishes?\"  \"Oh, I could;\" laughing.  \"Only us two? It would be lonesome.\"  \"We are not likely to.\"  \"Don't go straight home. Let us find the market again. I didn't half see it last night.\"  \"It wasn't night exactly. Yes--we must learn to find our way about, for we cannot stay in all the time. This is Essex Street. Let us turn here.\"  The market was in its glory this morning. The stalls were ornamented with branches of evergreens, the floors sifted over with sawdust. There were vegetables and meats, but no great variety. There was no sunny south, no swift train to send in delicious luxuries. The cold storage of that day was being buried in pits and being brought out to light as occasion required.  There were other stalls, with various household stores. Iron-holders, tin kettles, whiskbrooms, pins (which were quite a luxury), crockery ware even. Wagons had come in from country places and customers were thronging about them.  The people interested Miss Winn, and the chaffering, the beating down in prices, was quite amusing. Here a woman was measuring some cotton goods from her chin to the ends of her fingers; here sat a cobbler doing odd jobs while some one waited. Altogether it was very entertaining, and it was dinner-time when they reached home.  \"Mr. Leverett has gone to Boston,\" announced Miss Leverett. \"We must have our dinner without him.\"  \"Yes, he was down on the ship,\" said Miss Winn. \"Do you often go to Boston?\"  \"I am much too busy to be gadding about,\" returned Elizabeth sharply; \"though we have connections there, and I once spent several years in the city.\"  \"I don't suppose it is at all like London. Eastern cities are so different--and dirty,\" she added.  \"Boston is very nice, quite a superior place, but we do not consider it much above Salem,\" Miss Elizabeth said, with an air. \"We have nearly all of the East India trade. To be sure, there is Harvard at Cambridge, and that calls students and professors. Cousin Chilian is a graduate. He could have been an accepted professor if he had chosen.\"  Then the conversation languished. They were hardly through dinner when the next relay of goods arrived.  \"Cynthia's desk must go upstairs, I suppose. Her father had it made for her birthday. Will Silas unpack again? There is a small cabinet of teakwood that is beautifully carved. If you could find room in the parlor for that. There were many other fine pieces that will no doubt be sold, and it seems a great pity.\"  Elizabeth acquiesced rather frigidly, adding, \"It is fortunate the house is large, but one seems to accumulate a "]]]
