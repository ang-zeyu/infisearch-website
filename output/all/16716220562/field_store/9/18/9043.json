Before 1801, however much he may have brooded over the matter, we have no utterances in print on the transformation theory. His studies on the lower animals, and his general knowledge of the vertebrates derived from the work of his contemporaries and his observations in the Museum and menagerie, gave him a broad grasp of the entire animal kingdom, such as no one before him had. As the result, his comprehensive mind, with its powers of rapid generalization, enabled him to appreciate the series from monad (his _ébauche_) to man, the range of forms from the simple to the complex. Even though not a comparative anatomist like Cuvier, he made use of the latter's discoveries, and could understand and appreciate the gradually increasing complexity of forms; and, unlike Cuvier, realize that they were blood relations, and not separate, piece-meal creations. Animal life, so immeasurably higher than vegetable forms, with its highly complex physiological functions and varied means of reproduction, and the relations of its forms to each other and to the world around, affords facts for evolution which were novel to Lamarck, the descriptive botanist.  [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK. REAR VIEW, FROM THE WEST]  [Illustration: MAISON DE BUFFON, IN WHICH LAMARCK LIVED IN PARIS. 1793-1829]  In accordance with the rules of the Museum, which required that all the professors should be lodged within the limits of the Jardin, the choice of lodgings being given to the oldest professors, Lamarck, at the time of his appointment, took up his abode in the house now known as the Maison de Buffon, situated on the opposite side of the Jardin des Plantes from the house afterwards inhabited by Cuvier, and in the angle between the Galerie de Zoologie and the Museum library.[37] With little doubt the windows of his study, where his earlier addresses, the _Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivans_, and the _Philosophie Zoologique_, were probably written, looked out upon what is now the court on the westerly side of the house, that facing the Rue Geoffroy St. Hilaire.  At the time of his entering on his duties as professor of zoölogy, Lamarck was in his fiftieth year. He had married twice and was the father of six children, and without fortune. He married for a third, and afterwards for a fourth time, and in all, seven children were born to him, as in the year (1794) the minute referring to his request for an indemnity states: \"Il est chargé de sept enfans dont un est sur les vaisseaux de la République.\" Another son was an artist, as shown by the records of the Assembly of the Museum for September 23, 1814, when he asked for a chamber in the lodgings of Thouin, for the use of his son, \"_peintre_.\"  Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in 1829, spoke of one of his sons, M. Auguste de Lamarck, as a skilful and highly esteemed engineer of Ponts-et-Chaussées, then advantageously situated.  But man cannot live by scientific researches and philosophic meditations alone. The history of Lamarck's life is painful from beginning to end. With his large family and slender salary he was never free from carking cares and want. On the 30 fructidor, an II. of the Republic, the National Convention voted the sum of 300,000 livres, with which an indemnity was to be paid to citizens eminent in literature and art. Lamarck had sacrificed much time and doubtless some money in the preparation and publication of his works, and he felt that he had a just claim to be placed on the list of those who had been useful to the Republic, and at the same time could give proof of their good citizenship, and of their right to receive such indemnity or appropriation.  Accordingly, in 1795 he sent in a letter, which possesses much autobiographical interest, to the Committee of Public Instruction, in which he says:    \"During the twenty-six years that he has lived in Paris the citizen   Lamarck has unceasingly devoted himself to the study of natural   history, and particularly botany. He has done it successfully, for   it is fifteen years since he published under the title of _Flore   Française_ the history and description of the plants of France, with   the mention of their properties and of their usefulness in the arts;   a work printed at the expense of the government, well received by   the public, and which now is much sought after and very rare.\" He   then describes his second great botanical undertaking, the   _Encyclopædia and Illustration of Genera_, with nine hundred plates.   He states that for ten years past he has kept busy \"a great number   of Parisian artists, three printing presses for different works,   besides delivering a course of lectures.\"  The petition was granted. At about this period a pension of twelve hundred francs from the Academy of Sciences, and which had increased to three thousand francs, had ceased eighteen months previously to be paid to him. But at the time (an II.) Lamarck was \"chargé de sept enfans,\" and this appropriation was a most welcome addition to his small salary.  The next year (an III.) he again applied for a similar allowance from the funds providing an indemnity for men of letters and artists \"whose talents are useful to the Republic.\" Again referring to the _Flore Française_, and his desire to prepare a second edition of it, and his other works and travels in the interest of botanical science, he says:    \"If I had been less overburdened by needs of all kinds for some   years, and especially since the suppression of my pension from the   aforesaid Academy of Sciences, I should prepare the second edition   of this useful work; and this would be, without doubt, indeed, the   opportunity of making a new present to my country.    \"Since my return to France I have worked on the completion of my   great botanical enterprises, and indeed for about ten years past my   works have obliged me to keep in constant activity a great number of   artists, such as draughtsmen, engravers, and printers. But these   important works that I have begun, and have in a well-advanced   state, have been in spite of all my efforts suspended and   practically abandoned for the last ten years. The loss of my pension   from the Academy of Sciences and the enormous increase in the price   of articles of subsistence have placed me, with my numerous family,   in a state of distress which leaves me neither the time nor the   freedom from care to cultivate science in a fruitful way.\"  Lamarck's collection of shells, the accumulation of nearly thirty years,[38] was purchased by the government at the price of five thousand livres. This sum was used by him to balance the price of a national estate for which he had contracted by virtue of the law of 28 ventôse de l'an IV.[39] This little estate, which was the old domain of Beauregard, was a modest farm-house or country-house at Héricourt-Saint-Samson, in the Department of Seine-et-Oise, not far to the northward of Beauvais, and about fifty miles from Paris. It is probable that as a proprietor of a landed property he passed the summer season, or a part of it, on this estate.  This request was, we may believe, made from no unworthy or mercenary motive, but because he thought that such an indemnity was his due. Some years after (in 1809) the chair of zoölogy, newly formed by the Faculté des Sciences in Paris, was offered to him. Desirable as the salary would have been in his straitened circumstances, he modestly refused the offer, because he felt unable at that time of life (he was, however, but sixty-five years of age) to make the studies required worthily to occupy the position.  One of Lamarck's projects, which he was never able to carry out, for it was even then quite beyond the powers of any man single-handed to undertake, was his _Système de la Nature_. We will let him describe it in his own words, especially since the account is somewhat autobiographical. It is the second memoir he addressed to the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, dated 4 vendémiaire, l'an III. (1795):    \"In my first memoir I have given you an account of the works which I   have published and of those which I have undertaken to contribute to   the progress of natural history; also of the travels and researches   which I have made.    \"But for a long time I have had in view a very important   work--perhaps better adapted for education in France than those I   have already composed or undertaken--a work, in short, which the   National Convention should without doubt order, and of which no part   could be written so advantageously as in Paris, where are to be   found abundant means for carrying it to completion.    \"This is a _Système de la Nature_, a work analogous to the _Systema   naturæ_ of Linnæus, but written in French, and presenting the   picture complete, concise, and methodical, of all the natural   productions observed up to this day. This important work (of   Linnæus), which the young Frenchmen who intend to devote themselves   to the study of natural history always require, is the object of   speculations by foreign authors, and has already passed through   thirteen different editions. Moreover, their works, which, to our   shame, we have to use, because we have none written expressly for   us, are filled (especially the last edition edited by Gmelin) with   gross mistakes, omissions of double and triple occurrence, and   errors in synonymy, and present many generic characters which are   inexact or imperceptible and many series badly divided, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20559"],["title","R.

THE ADVENTURE OF ROOM 407 X.    THE MAJOR-GENERAL'S PEPPERPOTS    R. HOLMES & CO.    I INTRODUCING MR. RAFFLES HOLMES  It was a blistering night in August. All day long the mercury in the thermometer had been flirting with the figures at the top of the tube, and the promised shower at night which a mendacious Weather Bureau had been prophesying as a slight mitigation of our sufferings was conspicuous wholly by its absence. I had but one comfort in the sweltering hours of the day, afternoon and evening, and that was that my family were away in the mountains, and there was no law against my sitting around all day clad only in my pajamas, and otherwise concealed from possibly intruding eyes by the wreaths of smoke that I extracted from the nineteen or twenty cigars which, when there is no protesting eye to suggest otherwise, form my daily allowance. I had tried every method known to the resourceful flat-dweller of modern times to get cool and to stay so, but alas, it was impossible. Even the radiators, which all winter long had never once given forth a spark of heat, now hissed to the touch of my moistened finger. Enough cooling drinks to float an ocean greyhound had passed into my inner man, with no other result than to make me perspire more profusely than ever, and in so far as sensations went, to make me feel hotter than before. Finally, as a last resource, along about midnight, its gridiron floor having had a chance to lose some of its stored-up warmth, I climbed out upon the fire-escape at the rear of the Richmere, hitched my hammock from one of the railings thereof to the leader running from the roof to the area, and swung myself therein some eighty feet above the concealed pavement of our backyard--so called, perhaps, because of its dimensions which were just about that square. It was a little improvement, though nothing to brag of. What fitful zephyrs there might be, caused no doubt by the rapid passage to and fro on the roof above and fence-tops below of vagrant felines on Cupid's contentious battles bent, to the disturbance of the still air, soughed softly through the meshes of my hammock and gave some measure of relief, grateful enough for which I ceased the perfervid language I had been using practically since sunrise, and dozed off. And then there entered upon the scene that marvelous man, Raffles Holmes, of whose exploits it is the purpose of these papers to tell.  I had dozed perhaps for a full hour when the first strange sounds grated upon my ear. Somebody had opened a window in the kitchen of the first-floor apartment below, and with a dark lantern was inspecting the iron platform of the fire-escape without. A moment later this somebody crawled out of the window, and with movements that in themselves were a sufficient indication of the questionable character of his proceedings, made for the ladder leading to the floor above, upon which many a time and oft had I too climbed to home and safety when an inconsiderate janitor had locked me out. Every step that he took was stealthy--that much I could see by the dim starlight. His lantern he had turned dark again, evidently lest he should attract attention in the apartments below as he passed their windows in his upward flight.  \"Ha! ha!\" thought I to myself. \"It's never too hot for Mr. Sneak to get in his fine work. I wonder whose stuff he is after?\"  Turning over flat on my stomach so that I might the more readily observe the man's movements, and breathing pianissimo lest he in turn should observe mine, I watched him as he climbed. Up he came as silently as the midnight mouse upon a soft carpet--up past the Jorkins apartments on the second floor; up stealthily by the Tinkletons' abode on the third; up past the fire-escape Italian garden of little Mrs. Persimmon on the fourth; up past the windows of the disagreeable Garraways' kitchen below mine, and then, with the easy grace of a feline, zip! he silently landed within reach of my hand on my own little iron veranda, and craning his neck to one side, peered in through the open window and listened intently for two full minutes.  \"Humph!\" whispered my inner consciousness to itself. \"He is the coolest thing I've seen since last Christmas left town. I wonder what he is up to? There's nothing in my apartment worth stealing, now that my wife and children are away, unless it be my Jap valet, Nogi, who might make a very excellent cab driver if I could only find words to convey to his mind the idea that he is discharged.\"  And then the visitor, apparently having correctly assured himself that there was no one within, stepped across the window sill and vanished into the darkness of my kitchen. A moment later I too entered the window in pursuit, not so close a one, however, as to acquaint him with my proximity. I wanted to see what the chap was up to; and also being totally unarmed and ignorant as to whether or not he carried dangerous weapons, I determined to go slow for a little while. Moreover, the situation was not wholly devoid of novelty, and it seemed to me that here at last was abundant opportunity for a new sensation. As he had entered, so did he walk cautiously along the narrow bowling alley that serves for a hallway connecting my drawing-room and library with the dining-room, until he came to the library, into which he disappeared. This was not reassuring to me, because, to tell the truth, I value my books more than I do my plate, and if I were to be robbed I should much have preferred his taking my plated plate from the dining-room than any one of my editions-deluxe sets of the works of Marie Corelli, Hall Caine, and other standard authors from the library shelves. Once in the library, he quietly drew the shades at the windows thereof to bar possible intruding eyes from without, turned on the electric lights, and proceeded to go through my papers as calmly and coolly as though they were his own. In a short time, apparently, he found what he wanted in the shape of a royalty statement recently received by me from my publishers, and, lighting one of my cigars from a bundle of brevas in front of him, took off his coat and sat down to peruse the statement of my returns. Simple though it was, this act aroused the first feeling of resentment in my breast, for the relations between the author and his publishers are among the most sacred confidences of life, and the peeping Tom who peers through a keyhole at the courtship of a young man engaged in wooing his fiancée is no worse an intruder than he who would tear aside the veil of secrecy which screens the official returns of a \"best seller\" from the public eye. Feeling, therefore, that I had permitted matters to proceed as far as they might with propriety, I instantly entered the room and confronted my uninvited guest, bracing myself, of course, for the defensive onslaught which I naturally expected to sustain. But nothing of the sort occurred, for the intruder, with a composure that was nothing short of marvelous under the circumstances, instead of rising hurriedly like one caught in some disreputable act, merely leaned farther back in the chair, took the cigar from his mouth, and greeted me with:  \"Howdy do, sir. What can I do for you this beastly hot night?\"  The cold rim of a revolver-barrel placed at my temple could not more effectually have put me out of business than this nonchalant reception. Consequently I gasped out something about its being the sultriest 47th of August in eighteen years, and plumped back into a chair opposite him. \"I wouldn't mind a Remsen cooler myself,\" he went on, \"but the fact is your butler is off for to-night, and I'm hanged if I can find a lemon in the house. Maybe you'll join me in a smoke?\" he added, shoving my own bundle of brevas across the table. \"Help yourself.\"  \"I guess I know where the lemons are,\" said I. \"But how did you know my butler was out?\"  \"I telephoned him to go to Philadelphia this afternoon to see his brother Yoku, who is ill there,\" said my visitor. \"You see, I didn't want him around to-night when I called. I knew I could manage you alone in case you turned up, as you see you have, but two of you, and one a Jap, I was afraid might involve us all in ugly complications. Between you and me, Jenkins, these Orientals are pretty lively fighters, and your man Nogi particularly has got jiu-jitsu down to a pretty fine point, so I had to do something to get rid of him. Our arrangement is a matter for two, not three, anyhow.\"  \"So,\" said I, coldly. \"You and I have an arrangement, have we? I wasn't aware of it.\"  \"Not yet,\" he answered. \"But there's a chance that we may have. If I can only satisfy myself that you are the man I'm looking for, there is no earthly reason that I can see why we should not come to terms. Go on out and get the lemons and the gin and soda, and let's talk this thing over man to man like a couple of good fellows at the club. I mean you no harm, and you certainly don't wish to do any kind of injury to a chap who, even though appearances are against him, really means to do you a good turn.\"  \"Appearances certainly are against you, sir,\" said I, a trifle warmly, for the man's composure was irritating. \"A disappearance would be more likely to do you credit at this moment.\"  \"Tush, Jenkins!\" he answered. \"Why waste breath saying self-evident things? Here you are on the verge of a big transaction, and you delay proceedings by making statements of fact, mixed in with a cheap wit which, I"]]]
