Behind a low counter he saw ceiling-high shelves stocked with labeled bottles, cans and cartons, and square glass jars containing odd bits of leaves, twigs, and fungus. In back of the counter was a small shelf of books with titles like _Quick Diagnosis in Acute Poisoning Cases_; _The Arsenic Family_; and _The Permutations of Henbane_.  It was quite obvious that poisoning played a large part in the daily life of Omega. Here was a store--and presumably there were others--whose sole purpose was to dispense antidotes. Barrent thought about this and decided that he had inherited a strange but honorable business. He would study the books and find out how an antidote shop was run.  The store had a back apartment with a living room, bedroom, and kitchen. In one of the closets, Barrent found a badly made suit of Citizen black, into which he changed. He took the girl's weapon from the pocket of his prison ship uniform, weighed it in his hand for a moment, then put it into a pocket of his new suit. He left the store and found his way back to the Victim's Protective Society.         *       *       *       *       *  The door was still open, and the three ragged men were still sitting on the bench. They weren't laughing now. Their long wait seemed to have tired them. At the other end of the room, Mr. Frendlyer was seated behind his desk, reading through a thick pile of papers. There was no sign of the girl.  Barrent walked to the desk, and Frendlyer stood up to greet him.  \"My congratulations!\" Frendlyer said. \"Dear fellow, my very warmest congratulations. That was a splendid bit of shooting. And in motion, too!\"  \"Thank you,\" Barrent said. \"The reason I came back here--\"  \"I know why,\" Frendlyer said. \"You wished to be advised of your rights and obligations as a Free Citizen. What could be more natural? If you take a seat on that bench, I'll be with you in--\"  \"I didn't come here for that,\" Barrent said. \"I want to find out about my rights and obligations, of course. But right now, I want to find that girl.\"  \"Girl?\"  \"She was sitting on the bench when I came in. She was the one who gave me the gun.\"  Mr. Frendlyer looked astonished. \"Citizen, you must be laboring under a misapprehension. There has been no woman in this office all day.\"  \"She was sitting on the bench near those three men. A very attractive dark-haired girl. You must have noticed her.\"  \"I would certainly have noticed her if she had been here,\" Frendlyer said, winking. \"But as I said before, no woman has entered these premises today.\"  Barrent glared at him and pulled the gun out of his pocket. \"In that case, how did I get this?\"  \"I lent it to you,\" Frendlyer said. \"I'm glad you were able to use it successfully, but now I would appreciate its return.\"  \"You're lying,\" Barrent said, taking a firm grip on the weapon. \"Let's ask those men.\"  He walked over to the bench with Frendlyer close behind him. He caught the attention of the man who had been sitting nearest the girl and asked him, \"Where did the girl go?\"  The man lifted a sullen, unshaven face and said, \"What girl you talking about, Citizen?\"  \"The one who was sitting right here.\"  \"I didn't notice nobody. Rafeel, you see a female on this bench?\"  \"Not me,\" Rafeel said. \"And I been sitting here continuous since ten this morning.\"  \"I didn't see her neither,\" the third man said. \"And I got sharp eyes.\"  Barrent turned back to Frendlyer. \"Why are you lying to me?\"  \"I've told you the simple truth,\" Frendlyer said. \"There has been no girl in here all day. I lent you the gun, as is my privilege as President of the Victim's Protective Society. I would now appreciate its return.\"  \"No,\" Barrent said. \"I'm keeping the gun until I find the girl.\"  \"That might not be wise,\" Frendlyer said. He hastily added, \"Thievery, I mean, is not condoned under these circumstances.\"  \"I'll take my chances on that,\" Barrent said. He turned and left the Victim's Protective Society.     Chapter Five   Barrent needed time to recuperate from his violent entry into Omegan life. Starting from the helpless state of a newborn, he had moved through murder to the ownership of an antidote shop. From a forgotten past on a planet called Earth, he had been catapulted into a dubious present in a world full of criminals. He had gotten a glimpse of a complex class structure, and a hint of an institutionalized program of murder. He had discovered in himself a certain measure of self-reliance, and a surprising quickness with a gun. He knew there was a great deal more to find out about Omega, Earth, and himself. He hoped he would live long enough to make the necessary discoveries.  First things first. He had to earn a living. To do so, he had to find out about poisons and antidotes.  He moved into the apartment in back of his store and began reading the books left by the late Hadji Draken.  The literature on poisons was fascinating. There were the vegetable poisons known on Earth, such as hellebore, setterwort, deadly nightshade, and the yew tree. He learned about the action of hemlock--its preliminary intoxication and its final convulsions. There was prussic acid poisoning from almonds and digitalin poisoning from purple foxglove. There was the awesome efficiency of wolfsbane with its deadly store of aconite. There were the fungi such as the amanita toadstools and fly agaric, not to mention the purely Omegan vegetable poisons like redcup, flowering lily, and amortalis.  But the vegetable poisons, although dismayingly numerous, were only one part of his studies. He had to consider the animals of Earth, sea, and air, the several species of deadly spiders, the snakes, scorpions, and giant wasps. There was an imposing array of metallic poisons such as arsenic, mercury, and bismuth. There were the commoner corrosives--nitric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, and sulphuric acid. And there were the poisons distilled or extracted from various sources, among which were strychnine, formic acid, hyoscyamine, and belladonna.  Each of the poisons had one or more antidotes listed; but those complicated, cautiously worded formulas, Barrent suspected, were frequently unsuccessful. To make matters more difficult, the efficacy of an antidote seemed to depend upon a correct diagnosis of the poisoning agent. And too often the symptoms produced by one poison resembled those of another.  Barrent pondered these problems while he studied his books. In the meantime, with considerable nervousness, he served his first customers.  He found that many of his fears were ungrounded. In spite of the dozens of lethal substances recommended by the Poison Institute, most poisoners stuck single-mindedly to arsenic or strychnine. They were cheap, sure, and very painful. Prussic acid had a readily discernible odor, mercury was difficult to introduce into the system, and the corrosives, although gratifyingly spectacular, were dangerous to the user. Wolfsbane and fly agaric were excellent, of course; deadly nightshade could not be discounted, and the amanita toadstool had its own macabre charm. But these were the poisons of an older, more leisurely age. The impatient younger generation--and especially the women, who made up nearly 90 per cent of the poisoners on Omega--were satisfied with plain arsenic or strychnine, as the occasion and opportunity demanded.  Omegan women were conservatives. They simply weren't interested in the never-ending refinements of the poisoner's art. Means didn't interest them; only ends, as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Omegan women were noted for their common sense. Although the eager theoreticians at the Poison Institute tried to sell dubious mixtures of Contact Poison or Three Day Mold, and worked hard to put across complex, haywire schemes involving wasps, concealed needles, and double glasses, they found few takers among women. Simple arsenic and fast-acting strychnine continued to be the mainstays of the poison trade.  This quite naturally simplified Barrent's work. His remedies--immediate regurgitation, lavage, neutralizing agent--were easy enough to master.  He encountered some difficulty with men who refused to believe they had been poisoned by anything so commonplace as arsenic or strychnine. For those cases, Barrent prescribed a variety of roots, herbs, twigs, leaves, and a minute homeopathic dose of poison. But he invariably preceded these with regurgitation, lavage, and neutralizing agent.  After he was settled, Barrent received a visit from Danis Foeren and Joe. Foeren had a temporary job on the docks unloading fishing boats. Joe had organized a nightly pokra game among the government workers of Tetrahyde. Neither man had moved much in status; with no kills to their credit, they had progressed only as far as Second Class Resident. They were nervous about meeting socially with a Free Citizen, but Barrent put them at ease. They were the only friends he had on Omega, and he had no intention of losing them over a question of social position.  Barrent was unable to learn very much from them about the laws and customs of Tetrahyde. Even Joe hadn't been able to find out anything definite from his friends in government service. On Omega, the law was kept secret. Older residents used their knowledge of the law to enforce their rule over the newcomers. This system was condoned and reinforced by the doctrine of the inequality of all men, which lay at the heart of the Omegan legal system. Through planned inequality and enforced ignorance, power and status remained in the hands of the older residents.  Of course, all social movement upward couldn't be stopped. But it could be retarded, discouraged, and made exceedingly dangerous. The way one encountered the laws and customs of Omega was through a risky process of trial and error.  Although the Antidote Shop took up most of his time, Barrent persisted in his efforts to locate the girl. He was unable to find a hint that she even existed.  He became friendly with the shopkeepers on either"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20919"],["title","The Status Civilization (#5)"],["body","of him. One of them, Demond Harrisbourg, was a jaunty, moustached young man who operated a food store. It was a mundane and slightly ridiculous line of work; but, as Harrisbourg explained, even criminals must eat. And this necessitated farmers, processors, packagers, and food stores. Harrisbourg contended that his business was in no way inferior to the more indigenous Omegan industries centered around violent death. Besides, Harrisbourg's wife's uncle was a Minister of Public Works. Through him, Harrisbourg expected to receive a murder certificate. With this all-important document, he could make his six-months kill and move upward to the status of Privileged Citizen.  Barrent nodded his agreement. But he wondered if Harrisbourg's wife, a thin, restless woman, wouldn't decide to poison him first. She appeared to be dissatisfied with her husband; and divorce was forbidden on Omega.  His other neighbor, Tem Rend, was a lanky, cheerful man in his early forties. He had a heat scar which ran from just beneath his left ear down almost to the corner of his mouth, a souvenir given him by a status-seeking hopeful. The hopeful had picked on the wrong man. Tem Rend owned a weapon shop, practiced constantly, and always carried the articles of his trade with him. According to witnesses, he had performed the counterkill in exemplary fashion. Tem's dream was to become a member of the Assassin's Guild. His application was on file with that ancient and austere organization, and he had a chance of being accepted within the month.  Barrent bought a sidearm from him. On Rend's advice, he chose a Jamiason-Tyre needlebeam. It was faster and more accurate than any projectile weapon, and it transmitted the same shock-power as a heavy caliber bullet. To be sure, it hadn't the spread of heat weapons such as the Hadjis used, which could kill within six inches of their target. But wide-range beamers encouraged inaccuracy. They were messy, careless weapons which reinforced careless traits. Anyone could fire a heat gun; but to use a needlebeam effectively, you had to practice constantly. And practice paid off. A good needlebeam man was more than a match for any two widebeam gunmen.  Barrent took this advice to heart, coming, as it did, from an apprentice assassin and the owner of a weapon shop. He put in long hours on Rend's cellar firing range, sharpening his reflexes, getting used to the Quik-Thro holster.  There was a lot to do and a tremendous amount to learn, just in order to survive. Barrent didn't mind hard work as long as it was for a worthwhile goal. He hoped things would stay quiet for a while so he could catch up to the older inhabitants.  But things never stayed quiet in Omega.  One day, late in the afternoon as he was closing up, Barrent received an unusual-looking caller. He was a man in his fifties, heavy-set, with a stern, swarthy face. He wore a red ankle-length robe and sandals. Around his waist was a rawhide belt from which dangled a small black book and a red-handled dagger. There was an air of unusual force and authority about him. Barrent was unable to tell his status.  Barrent said, \"I was just closing up, sir. But if there's anything you wish to buy--\"  \"I did not come here to buy,\" the caller said. He permitted himself a faint smile. \"I came here to sell.\"  \"Sell?\"  \"I am a priest,\" the man said. \"You are a newcomer to my district. I haven't noticed you at services.\"  \"I hadn't known anything about--\"  The priest held up his hand. \"Under both the sacred and the profane law, ignorance is no excuse for nonperformance of one's duties. Indeed, ignorance can be punished as an act of willful neglect, based upon the Total Personal Responsibility Act of '23, to say nothing of the Lesser Codicil.\" He smiled again. \"However, there is no question of chastisement for you as yet.\"  \"I'm glad to hear that, sir,\" Barrent said.  \"'Uncle' is the proper form of address,\" the priest said. \"I am Uncle Ingemar, and I have come to tell you about the orthodox religion of Omega, which is the worship of that pure and transcendent spirit of Evil which is our inspiration and our comfort.\"  Barrent said, \"I'll be very happy to hear about the religion of Evil, Uncle. Shall we go into the living room?\"  \"By all means, Nephew,\" the priest said, and followed Barrent to the apartment in back of the store.     Chapter Six   \"Evil,\" the priest said, after he had settled comfortably into Barrent's best chair, \"is that force within us which inspires men to acts of strength and endurance. The worship of Evil is essentially the worship of oneself, and therefore the only true worship. The self which one worships is the ideal social being; the man content in his niche in society, yet ready to grasp any opportunity for advancement; the man who meets death with dignity, who kills without the demeaning vice of pity. Evil is cruel, since it is a true reflection of the uncaring and insensate universe. Evil is eternal and unchanging, although it comes to us in the many forms of protean life.\"  \"Would you care for a little wine, Uncle?\" Barrent asked.  \"Thank you, that's very thoughtful,\" Uncle Ingemar said. \"How is business?\"  \"Fair. A little slow this week.\"  \"People don't take the same interest in poisoning,\" the priest said, moodily sipping his drink. \"Not like when I was a boy, newly unfrocked and shipped out from Earth. However. I was speaking to you about Evil.\"  \"Yes, Uncle.\"  \"We worship Evil,\" Uncle Ingemar said, \"in the incarnate form of The Black One, that horned and horrid specter of our days and nights. In The Black One we find the seven cardinal sins, the forty felonies, and the hundred and one misdemeanors. There is no crime that The Black One has not performed--faultlessly, as befits his nature. Therefore we imperfect beings model ourselves upon his perfections. And sometimes, The Black One rewards us by appearing before us in the awful beauty of his fiery flesh. Yes, Nephew, I have actually been privileged to see him. Two years ago he appeared at the conclusion of the Games, and he also appeared the year before that.\"  The priest brooded for a moment over the divine appearance. Then he said, \"Since we recognize in the State man's highest potential for Evil, we also worship the State as a suprahuman, though less than divine, creation.\"  Barrent nodded. He was having a difficult time staying awake. Uncle Ingemar's low, monotonous voice lecturing about so commonplace a thing as Evil had a soporific effect on him. He struggled to keep his eyes open.  \"One might well ask,\" Uncle Ingemar droned on, \"if Evil is the highest attainment of the nature of man, why then did The Black One allow any Good to exist in the universe? The problem of Good has bothered the unenlightened for ages. I will now answer it for you.\"  \"Yes, Uncle?\" Barrent said, surreptitiously pinching himself on the inside of the thigh in an effort to stay awake.  \"But first,\" Uncle Ingemar said, \"let us define our terms. Let us examine the nature of Good. Let us boldly and fearlessly stare our great opponent in the face and discover the true lineaments of his features.\"  \"Yes,\" Barrent said, wondering if he should open a window. His eyes felt incredibly heavy. He rubbed them hard and tried to pay attention.  \"Good is a state of illusion,\" said Uncle Ingemar in his even, monotonous voice, \"which ascribes to man the nonexistent attributes of altruism, humility, and piety. How can we recognize Good as being an illusion? Because there is only man and The Black One in the universe, and to worship The Black One is to worship the ultimate expression of oneself. Thus, since we have proven Good to be an illusion, we necessarily recognize its attributes as nonexistent. Understood?\"  Barrent didn't answer.  \"Do you understand?\" the priest asked more sharply.  \"Eh?\" Barrent said. He had been dozing with his eyes open. He forced himself awake and managed to say, \"Yes, Uncle, I understand.\"  \"Excellent. Understanding that, we ask, why did The Black One allow even the illusion of Good to exist in an Evil universe? And the answer is found in the Law of Necessary Opposites; for Evil could not be recognized as such without something to contrast it with. The best contrast is an opposite. And the opposite of Evil is Good.\" The priest smiled triumphantly. \"It's so simple and clear-cut, isn't it?\"  \"It certainly is, Uncle,\" Barrent said. \"Would you like a little more wine?\"  \"Just the tiniest drop,\" the priest said.  He talked to Barrent for another ten minutes about the natural and charming Evil inherent in the beasts of the field and forest, and counseled Barrent to pattern his behavior on those simple-minded creatures. At last he rose to leave.  \"I'm very glad we could have this little chat,\" the priest said, warmly shaking Barrent's hand. \"Can I count on your appearance at our Monday night services?\"  \"Services?\"  \"Of course,\" Uncle Ingemar said. \"Every Monday night--at midnight--we hold Black Mass at the Wee Coven on Kirkwood Drive. After services, the Ladies Auxiliary usually puts out a snack, and we have community dancing and choir singing. It's all very jolly.\" He smiled broadly. \"You see, the worship of evil _can_ be fun.\"  \"I'm sure it can,\" Barrent said. \"I'll be there, Uncle.\"  He showed the priest to the door. After locking up, he thought carefully about what Uncle Ingemar had said. No doubt about it, attendance at services was necessary. Compulsory, in fact. He just hoped that the Black Mass wouldn't be as infernally dull as Ingemar's exposition of Evil.  That was Friday. Barrent was kept busy over the next two days. He received a shipment of homeopathic herbs and roots from his agent in the Bloodpit district. It took the better part of a day to sort and classify them, and another day to store them in the proper jars.  On Monday, returning to his shop after lunch, Barrent thought he saw the girl. He hurried after her, but lost her in the crowd.  When he got back to his store, Barrent found "]]]
