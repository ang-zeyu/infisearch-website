But I am afraid, boys, you are going to be very much disappointed if you expect that your parents will consent. I think it very unlikely that you'll get any such permission. I will send your thanks to Mrs. Dexter, and will also tell her what I have told you about the use of the camp. As to-morrow will be Christmas, I shall not be back here to-day. If you go camping, boys--which I don't believe you will--don't burn the old cabin down unless you find it necessary in order to keep warm enough.\"  As Lawyer Ripley now made it plain that he was about to leave, the boys hastily repeated their thanks and left the office.  Not until they got down into the street did any of them feel like speaking.  \"Say, fellows, if that isn't the grandest----\" suddenly blazed forth Greg.  \"It's all right,\" nodded Tom.  \"I'm going camping, if I can get any of you fellows to go with me,\" announced Dave Darrin.  \"If your folks will let you, you mean,\" interrupted Hazelton.  \"They will,\" Dave contended. \"And so will yours, Dick.\"  \"I--I hope so,\" sighed Dick, his eyes dancing. \"I never before in my life wanted to do anything as much as I now want to go camping.\"  \"With the still woods, all snow-covered!\" cried Dan enthusiastically.  \"And the cold nights, with the great fire roaring up the chimney!\" supplied Greg.  \"And some hunting!\"  \"And the jolly fun of cooking our own food!\"  These youngsters, as they hurried along the street, were in grave danger of being lost in the depths of their own excitement.  \"Say, I wonder if there'd be any fishing out there--through the ice?\" demanded Harry Hazelton.  \"There'd be some rabbit hunting, anyway,\" supplied Dan.  \"If we can only get leave to go!\" groaned Greg anxiously.  \"See here, fellows,\" muttered Dick, halting suddenly. \"We've simply got to get that leave from our parents!\"  \"But how?\" challenged Dan.  \"That's what we've got to think out right now. And, by hookey! I believe I have an idea. Fellows, we have ten dollars apiece.\"  \"My mother will say that I must put that in bank,\" grunted Dan.  \"Wait! Of course, with ten dollars apiece, we've got to consult our parents as to how the money is to be spent,\" Dick went on. \"Now, that is a matter that will call for a little diplomacy. Some of what our principal, Old Dut, calls 'finish'--no, '_finesse_.'\"  \"What's that?\" Dan wanted to know.  \"Oh, it's a Latin or a Greek word, or something of the sort, meaning to put a fine edge on a piece of business,\" Dick explained tranquilly. \"What I mean is this, fellows: Each one of us will go home and show the money to his father--his father only. Then each one of us will ask permission to spend five dollars of the money on a present for his mother, to be given to her to-morrow morning as a surprise. Then we'll ask our dads for leave to use the other five dollars towards provisioning our camp. Fellows, if you go about it the right way, I'm sure you can each get leave for the camping expedition! I feel just about sure on my own account.\"  \"But how about our mothers?\" inquired Dan dubiously.  \"Don't you think the present will smooth the way with the mothers?\" laughed Dave Darrin.  \"It ought to,\" smiled Tom Reade.  \"Don't you think we could get our mothers something pretty nice with two dollars apiece?\" asked Harry Hazelton speculatively.  \"I couldn't get anything nice enough for my mother with two dollars, when I have more money,\" Dick replied promptly.  Hazelton's money-saving plan was promptly voted down.  \"So now,\" proposed Dick, \"all we have to do is to hurry home and hustle! Beat your way to it, fellows!\"  \"Hurrah!\" Greg gasped.  Hurrying along Main Street, through the crowds of Christmas shoppers, the Grammar School boys were on the point of parting, to go their several ways homeward, when they came upon a scene that halted them.  More than two dozen people, mostly women, had gathered around a shabby-looking man who was clutching wildly at a lamp post, and yet seemed in momentary danger of falling. His lips were thickly covered with foam, his eyes glaring, and the fellow was talking wildly, in low tones, as though to himself.  \"Come away and leave him. He's intoxicated,\" announced one woman shrilly.  \"He's not intoxicated,\" responded another matron indignantly. \"There is no odor of liquor about the poor man. And drunken men don't froth at the mouth. This poor fellow is ill--very ill. It must be a fit--maybe epilepsy. Some of you women who have a little more brains and heart than others help me to take this poor fellow to the drug store.\"  There were willing hands enough, now, among the women. Three or four tried to take hold of the sufferer at once. That victim of an unknown malady clutched and gripped at the good Samaritans as they tried to steer him along the street toward the drug store. To hold him up was all four women could do together, so progress along the street was slow indeed.  \"Here comes Dr. Bentley in his auto. Stop him, some one!\"  The doctor quickly ran his car in toward the curb and leaped out. A fine man and a busy physician, Dr. Bentley was never too much occupied to stop and help an unfortunate man.  Dr. Bentley's big frame and broad shoulders loomed up in the crowd.  \"Let me have the man on one side,\" urged the doctor. \"One of you ladies might help hold him on the other side.\"  \"What's the matter with the man, doctor?\" cried several.  \"Really, ladies, I can't tell until I've had a chance to examine the man. It may be a fit of some sort. I think likely it is. But we will get him to the drug store first, and into the back room. Then I can examine the poor chap comfortably.\"  Though seemingly \"out of his head,\" the sufferer succeeded in throwing his arms about a great deal.  Then, suddenly, Dick, who had been following and watching with wide-open eyes, called out lustily:  \"Dr. Bentley, your overcoat is open, your chain is hanging with no watch on it, and your scarf pin is gone!\"  That announcement electrified the situation. Dr. Bentley glanced down swiftly, then threw one hand up to his necktie.  \"My purse is gone from my chatelaine!\" cried one of the women who had been helping.  \"My purse is gone, too!\"  It was amazing to see how quickly the sufferer from the fit galvanized into action. He straightened up suddenly, gave himself a violent wrench and shook himself free of those who had sought to aid him.  With a bound the fellow was off and away. As he sprang he spat from his mouth the piece of soap that had supplied the foam to his lips.  \"Catch him, fellows!\" yelled Dick.  But only Tom and young Prescott were near enough to the path of flight. Tom Reade leaped valiantly in, but was shoved off and sent spinning by one of the burly fists of the rough.  It was up to Dick to make the catch.  Dick had his skates, strapped together, swinging from his right wrist. He swung the skates back to strike at the fugitive. Ere he could do it the man drove a big, hammer-like fist straight between Dick Prescott's eyes in a way that sent that boy down like a log.  The impact of that blow was heard by all.     CHAPTER III  THE CAMPAIGN TO COAX PARENTS   In another moment the fleeing one had darted around the corner.  Five members of Dick & Co., angry all the way through, were the first to reach that corner.  \"There he goes, down the alley-way to the livery stable!\" roared Dave Darrin. \"After him, fellows!\"  But by the time that the five reached the stable yard the fugitive was out of sight. Men hurried up, and a quick search was made of the neighborhood. It was soon certain, however, that the fellow had made good use of his time and had gotten away. Two policemen who were among the latest arrivals on the scene gave it as their opinion that further chase would be worse than useless.  So Dick's chums turned back, to see how their leader had fared.  Dr. Bentley was leaning over the boy, who, white and lifeless, lay at the edge of the sidewalk.  \"Take him to the drug store, doctor,\" urged one of the women.  \"He'll revive quicker in the open air, madam,\" answered the physician.  \"Is young Prescott very badly hurt?\"  \"I can't tell yet,\" said Dr. Bentley. \"There doesn't seem to be any fracture of the bone at the point where he was struck. And the back of his head seems to be sound and whole. I think Master Dick is simply stunned.\"  Dr. Bentley stepped over to his auto, took out a drug case and selected a vial from it.  \"Get me a glass of water, someone, and promptly,\" he directed.  The water was quickly brought. After pouring a few drops from the vial into it, the medical man supported Dick's head and poured some of the stuff into his mouth.  After a short time Dick opened his eyes.  \"Wh-what kicked me?\" he asked slowly.  \"The fist of that gentleman with soap-made fits,\" replied the physician dryly. \"Take a few deep breaths, Prescott. Now, a little more from the glass. Breathe hard again. There, do you feel as though you'd like to get on your feet?\"  \"Certainly,\" Dick replied.  Dr. Bentley helped him to his feet, supporting him and urging him to try to walk a little. At about this time Dave and the others returned at a trot.  \"Dick, I guess you saved some of us from losing more in the way of valuables,\" smiled the medical man grimly. \"For one, I'm ashamed of myself. A man who has been practising medicine more than twenty years should know too much to be taken in by sham fits on the part of a thief who plays his trick in order to rob a crowd of Christmas shoppers.\"  \"You think he meant to rob us, then, doctor?\" pressed a woman in the crowd.  \"That fellow certainly did mean to do it,\" replied Dr. Bentley with emphasis. \"It's an old trick in a crowd--this sort of sham sickness.\"  \"And he got all my Christmas money--every cent of it--and carried it off with him!\" wailed one woman, who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20789"],["title","The Grammar School Boys Snowbound; or, Dick & Co. at Winter Sports (#4)"],["body"," as though she could not afford to lose much money.  \"He snatched my locket with the diamond in it!\" vengefully exclaimed another woman, exhibiting the broken ends of a neck chain.  \"My purse is gone. I had forty-two dollars in it.\"  \"I didn't get off very lightly, ladies,\" replied Dr. Bentley. \"My scarf pin wasn't so extremely valuable, but I feel badly about the watch, and I shall feel worse when I realize its loss more fully. That was my father's watch, and I valued it above money.\"  \"The police ought to catch that scoundrel,\" declared one of the women losers.  \"Of course they ought,\" cried another. \"If they don't catch the thief what good are the police, anyway?\"  \"I don't care much about their finding him, unless they also find my forty-two dollars on him,\" mournfully proclaimed another of the losers.  \"I am sorry for you, ladies. I don't deserve any sympathy, or very little, for myself. Well, as the scoundrel has gotten away, and as young Prescott is growing stronger, I shall go on my way to other patients who need me.\"  Dick was still rather dizzy and weak, but Dave's right arm supported him.  \"Does your head ache?\" inquired Greg.  \"Guess,\" advised Dick dryly.  As the two policemen had given up looking for the fugitive, and had gone back to their posts, the crowd was melting. It was nearly noon, and most people on the streets were moving homeward.  \"Guess you won't have a large appetite for the coming meal,\" observed Tom Reade to Dick. \"Whew! What a crack that sounded like when the scoundrel struck you! It must have jarred away some of your appetite.\"  \"I can't tell about that until I try to eat,\" Dick answered.  \"No matter whether you eat much or not, but you want to be sure to ask your mother for two cups of strong coffee with your dinner,\" advised Darrin, with all the readiness of the amateur physician.  \"I guess I'll go home, fellows,\" announced Dick, as the noon whistles blew. \"I advise the rest of you to hustle, too. Remember what you've got to spring on your fathers when you get home. We want to have the whole thing settled when we meet this afternoon. Try to put it through, all of you, won't you?\"  \"I'm going to see you as far as your door, Dick, old fellow,\" Dave insisted.  \"Oh, I'll be feeling fine in another hour,\" Dick protested. \"It just knocked my senses for a minute or two.\"  Shortly after one o'clock the chums gathered again on Main Street. Dick now looked as keen as ever, and his eyes were shining.  \"It's all settled for me,\" he announced. \"I can go camping.\"  \"So can I,\" Dave reported with satisfaction.  \"Dad almost as good as said I could go,\" Tom declared. \"He'll agree to it by to-night.\"  \"How about you, Dan?\" queried Dick.  \"I can go--_not_,\" groaned Dalzell.  \"I hope to go,\" announced Greg. \"All I could get out of my father was that he was in a rush, but that he'd talk it over with me to-morrow and let me know what he had to say.\"  Hazelton admitted that he was in the same plight, as to a delayed decision, but he did not speak as though he were very hopeful of being permitted to go.  \"It'll just be a shame if we can't all go,\" Dave declared seriously. \"It won't be a quarter as much fun unless we have the whole crowd.\"  \"Say, watch that slim, well-dressed fellow with the brown derby,\" whispered Hazelton. \"See him coming along behind the two women. I'm sure I saw him, earlier this morning, talking with the same fit-thrower that bumped Dick.\"  \"Humph! So did I,\" muttered Dick. \"I remember. This slim fellow was with a short, thick-set man with a black moustache.\"  \"Right!\" nodded Harry.  \"They must all be members of the same gang of thieves, then,\" flashed Dick. \"I've read in the newspapers that the thieves who work the Christmas trade generally go in gangs. By crackey! Did you see that?\"  \"Yes!\" muttered Tom Reade excitedly.  \"What?\" questioned Greg.  \"Why,\" explained Dick, \"Mr. Slim put his hand in a woman's skirt pocket. He slipped a wallet from her pocket to his.\"  \"That's what he did,\" nodded Tom.  \"Come along,\" urged Dick. \"We'll see if we can come across a policeman before Mr. Slim gets all the money in the town.\"  Falling in by twos the Grammar School boys, full of excitement, trailed after the slim, neatly dressed thief.  Two blocks lower down the boys ran across Policeman Whalen, who, in citizen's clothes, had been turned out to watch for thieves.  In an undertone Dick called attention to the slim fellow, who was still moving along in the moving crowds of shopping women. Whalen cautiously took up the trail, while Dick & Co. fell back somewhat.  Two minutes later Whalen made a sudden leap forward, seizing the suspected young man by the coat collar.  \"Stand by, till I shake ye down!\" roared the policeman, thrashing the thief about until the slim one's teeth chattered. A small morocco purse fell to the sidewalk.  \"Why, that's mine!\" cried a woman.  \"I know it, ma'am. I saw this spalpeen take it from your pocket,\" nodded Policeman Whalen. \"Come along with me, lad! And ye come, too, ma'am, and claim your pocketbook.\"  \"Oh, I'm so glad you saw him do it,\" quivered the young woman, her face white from the shock caused by the thought of losing her Christmas money.  \"I wouldn't have seen him do it,\" admitted Whalen honestly, \"only Dick Prescott called my attention to the spalpeen.\"  The prisoner, who realized that he could not twist himself away from the strong clutch of the policeman, scowled at Dick as the young woman thanked him.  A crowd formed in an instant, but Whalen broke up the excitement by starting promptly along with his captive.  Dick & Co. turned and followed a little way. The crowd that kept in the wake of the policeman was soon a dense one.  \"You'll be sorry for this, youngster!\" growled a low, angry voice just behind Dick.  Like a flash Prescott wheeled. It was not plain, however, who, in all that throng, had spoken to him. But Dick's roving gaze soon made out, several yards away, a man in brown, wearing a gray overcoat. The fellow was marching along with the throng as though he, too, were an idle spectator.  \"That's the fit-thrower's other friend,\" flashed through Dick's mind. \"He must have been the fellow who spoke behind me just now, too.\"  \"Oh, let's not go any further,\" proposed Tom Reade. \"We've seen folks arrested before this.\"  \"Come along,\" said Dick shortly, not caring to explain his reasons just at this moment.  So the chums kept on in the wake of the crowd. A block further on a uniformed policeman stepped forward to have a look at Whalen's prisoner.  \"Moll-buzzer,\" explained Policeman Whalen briefly to his brother of the force. A \"moll-buzzer\" is a thief who robs women in crowds.  The uniformed policeman fell back and the crowd moved forward, but Dick seized the second policeman's coat sleeve.  \"There's another of the gang,\" whispered Dick, pointing to the black-moustached man in the gray overcoat.  \"Are you sure?\" demanded officer number two.  \"Positive,\" whispered Dick. \"At least, we saw them talking together early this morning.\"  At this moment the man in the gray overcoat turned. He saw Dick and the policeman talking in low tones. Without waiting an instant the man in the gray overcoat darted forward, trying to break through the crowd.  \"Grab him!\" shouted the policeman.  Three or four men moved closer to obey.  \"Look out!\" yelled some one frantically. \"He's got a pistol.\"  The citizen helpers drew away quickly at that information, but the delay had been enough to enable the policeman to close in on his man. With his locust stick the officer struck down the pistol hand and snatched away the weapon. An instant later two prisoners were marching toward the police station, the second one having been taken only on suspicion.  \"Bully for you, Dick Prescott!\" cried Grocer Smith, laying a heavy but approving hand across Dick's shoulders.  \"Oh, we all recognized the pair,\" Prescott answered modestly. \"They were together this morning, and the fit-thrower was with them.\"  \"You boys will be sorry for making unfounded charges of this sort,\" called back the black-moustached prisoner angrily. \"Wait and see if you're not.\"  \"Cut out the gloom, man!\" ordered the uniformed policeman, giving his captive a twist that hurt. \"Don't be trying to frighten small boys.\"  At the station house the crowd hung about outside.  \"Going inside, Dick!\" asked Dave eagerly.  \"No one has asked us to. I guess we'd better wait out here unless we're invited inside.\"  The young woman, whose pocketbook had been taken, went inside. She identified her property and made a charge against the pick-pocket. Both prisoners again heard the name of Dick Prescott mentioned.  The crowd melted after a little. Later the two prisoners were taken before Justice Lee. Mr. Slim was sent away for six months on the charge of pocket picking. The thick set captive in the gray overcoat, because he could not give a good account of himself, was sentenced to ninety days in the workhouse for vagrancy. Police and court were determined to do all in their power to protect the Christmas shoppers.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Now, as to our camping plans,\" Dick resumed, a little later in the afternoon. \"You fellows who aren't yet sure that you can get leave to go, will have to keep right on the trail until that permission is given. You can say that some of us are going, and that may help you some at home.\"  \"It may help the rest,\" suggested Dan Dalzell mournfully, \"but nothing will do me any good. I'm dished. No camping out in winter is going to come my way.\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't be too sure,\" urged Dick. \"But, at least, you can be sure you won't go if you don't try some more coaxing.\"  \"Say, you come and do the coaxing yourself to-night, when dad is home,\" begged Dan.  \"I will, if you think it will do any good, Danny,\" Prescott agreed.  \"At any rate, your little speech can't put the matter any further back than it stands right now,\" Dalzell declared. \"And, oh, dear! I do want so badly to go with you fellows! I"]]]
