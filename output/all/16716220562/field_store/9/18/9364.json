SOMETIME LORD BISHOP OF DURHAM.     \"I am more indebted to his writings than to those of any other    _uninspired_ writer, for the insight which I have been enabled to    attain into the motives of the Divine Economy and the grounds of moral    obligation.\"  _From a Letter of the late Bishop Kaye_, _of Lincoln_.  LONDON: RIVINGTONS, WATERLOO PLACE. 1853.  LONDON: GILBERT AND RIVINGTON, PRINTERS, ST. JOHN'S SQUARE     PREFACE.   It has long been a subject of regret that we should have so few remains of so great a writer as the author of the \"Analogy,\" not only the greatest thinker of his day, but one almost equally remarkable for his personal religion and amiability.  The few fragments and letters which remain unpublished, derive from this circumstance a value wholly incommensurate with their extent, though, as to the few I have been able to recover, they seem to me worthy of notice even for their own sake.  There can, I suppose, be no doubt but that many letters on subjects connected with their common pursuit,--the defence of religion by rational arguments,--must have passed between Dr. Clarke and the \"Gentleman in Gloucestershire,\" even up to the time of the former's decease; and the specimen I am now able to exhibit certainly excites a wish that one could recover more of a series which it is most likely that Dr. Clarke at least carefully preserved.  The three letters now printed were all addressed to Dr. Clarke; the first and last, though little known, were published many years ago in the European Magazine.  The second and third Fragments are printed as they were written, having apparently been noted down from time to time as the ideas occurred to their author; thus at the end of the first paragraph of the third Fragment, the word \"direction\" was originally written \"advice,\" but was subsequently altered in a different ink, being the same with that in which the sentences immediately following were written.  I have not thought myself at liberty to make any attempt to reduce these Fragments to better consistency; indeed, their present disordered state seems to me rather to add to their interest, as showing the mode in which the stones were gathered for building up such works as the \"Analogy\" and the \"Sermons.\"  It will be observed that I have found a difficulty in reading the last part of the third Fragment, and I am by no means sure that I have quite hit the sense intended; I should like it to apply either to the Cross set up at Bristol, or to the famous Charge delivered at Durham.  I have added a cotemporary notice of the buildings at Bristol, and an anecdote showing how they were thought of, as well as a statement, made after the Bishop's death, of his proceedings with regard to the church, which is now St. George's, near Bristol, in order to establish the fact of the separation of the property there mentioned from the bulk of his estate;--showing his desire to do something for the benefit of the people of Kingswood, a district the moral degradation of which had already attracted the attention of Whitefield and Wesley.  The following extract has been kindly communicated to me from the Diary of Dr. Thomas Wilson, the son of the great Bishop of Sodor and Man; and I print it here more especially to invite the attention of all who take an interest in these things to the fact, that a copy may have been made for the King of the sermon there mentioned, and may possibly even yet be in existence somewhere; if so, it cannot but be worth the trouble of recovery and publication.     1737, December, Friday, 23rd.  \"The Master [_i.e._ Sir Joseph Jekyll,    Master of the Rolls] told me that the King desired that Dr. Butler,    Clerk of the Closet to the late Queen, might preach before him in the    Princess Amelia's apartments.  He preached upon the subject of being    bettered by afflictions, which affected His Majesty so much that he    desired the sermon, and assured him that he would do something very    good for him.  The Master desired that it might be known publicly, it    was told him by the Bishop of Oxford [Seeker].  The Master seemed    mightily pleased, and was in hopes it would be of great service to the    public as well as his private family, which will be a pleasure to    every body, and make even the death of Her Majesty (so great a seeming    loss) of advantage to the nation.\"  I have been mainly induced to publish these Remains by the pleasure with which some copies I had given away privately have been received, and I confess that the fruit I should be most gratified to see, would be the recovery of some longer work, not less worthy of its Author's reputation.  EDWARD STEERE, LL.D.  University College, London, 1st September, 1853.     FRAGMENTS.   From the autographs of Bp. Butler now in the library at the British Museum.  [Add. MS. 9815.]    I.   God cannot approve of any thing but what is in itself Right, Fit, Just. We should worship and endeavour to obey Him with this Consciousness and Recollection.  To endeavour to please a man merely, is a different thing from endeavouring to please him as a wise and good man, _i.e._ endeavouring to please him in the particular way, of behaving towards him as we think the relations we stand in to him, and the intercourse we have with him, require.  Almighty God is to be sure infinitely removed from all those human weaknesses which we express by the words, captious, apt to take offence, &c.  But an unthinking world does not consider what may be absolutely due to Him from all Creatures capable of considering themselves as His Creatures.  Recollect the idea, inadequate as it is, which we have of God, and the idea of ourselves, and carelessness with regard to Him, whether we are to worship Him at all, whether we worship Him in a right manner, or conceited confidence that we do so, will seem to imply unspeakable Presumption.  Neither do we know what necessary, unalterable connexion there may be, between moral right and happiness, moral wrong and misery.  Sincerity is doubtless the thing, and not whether we hit the right manner, &c.  But a sense of the imperfection of our worship, apprehension that it may be, and a degree of fear that it is, in some respects erroneous, may perhaps be a temper of mind not unbecoming such poor creatures as we are, in our addresses to God.  In proportion as we are assured that we are honest and sincere, we may rest satisfied that God cannot be offended with us, but indifference whether what we do be materially, or in the nature of the thing abstracted from our way of considering it, Good and Right,--such indifference is utterly inconsistent with Sincerity.  No person who has just notions of God can be afraid of His displeasure any further than as he is afraid of his own Character, whether it be what it ought: but so far as a man has reason to fear his own character, so far there must be reason to fear God's displeasure, or disapprobation; not from any doubt of His Perfection and Goodness, but merely from the belief of it.  Is it possible that people can be Scepticks in _Opinion_, and yet without any doubtfulness, or solicitude about their _Actions_ and _Behaviour_?    II.   What a wonderful incongruity it is for a man to see the doubtfulness in which things are involved, and yet be impatient out of action, or vehement in it!  Say a man is a Sceptick, and add what was said of Brutus, _quicquid vult valde vult_, and you say, there is the greatest Contrariety between his Understanding and his Temper that can be expressed in words.  * * * * *  In general a man ought not to do other people's duty for them; for their duty was appointed them for their exercise; and besides, who will do it in case of his death?  Nor has a man any right to raise in others such a dependance upon him as that they must be miserable in case of his death, tho' whilst he lives he answers that dependance.  * * * * *  Hobbs' definition of Benevolence, that 'tis the love of power is base and false, but there is more of truth in it than appears at first sight; the real Benevolence of men being, I think, for the most part, not indeed the single love of power, but the love of power to be exercised in the way of doing good; that is a different thing from the love of the good or happiness of others by whomsoever effected, which last I call single or simple Benevolence.  How little there is of this in the world may appear by observing, how many persons can bear with great tranquillity that a friend or child should live in misery, who yet cannot bear the thought of their death.  Good men surely are not treated in this world as they deserve, yet 'tis seldom, very seldom their goodness which makes them disliked, even in cases where it may seem to be so: but 'tis some behaviour or other, which however excusable, perhaps infinitely overbalanced by their virtues, yet is offensive, possibly wrong; however such, it may be, as would pass off very well in a man of the world.    III.   Shall I not be faithful to God?  If He puts a part upon me to do, shall I neglect or refuse it?  A part to suffer, and shall I say I would not if I could help it?  Can words more ill-sorted, more shocking be put together? And is not the thing expressed by them more so, tho' not expressed in words?  What then shall I prefer to the sovereign Good, supreme Excellence, absolute Perfection?  To whom shall I apply for direction in opposition to Infinite Wisdom?  To whom for protection against Almighty Power?  Sunday Evening, June 13, 1742.  Hunger and thirst after Righteousness till filled with it by being made partaker of the Divine nature.

From a Copy formerly belonging to Dr. Birch, and now in the library at the British Museum.  [Add. MS. 4370.]  REV. DR.  'Twas but last night I received your letter from Gloucester, having left that place three weeks since.  It revived in my mind some very melancholy thoughts I had upon my being obliged to quit those studies, that had a direct tendency to divinity, that being what I should chuse for the business of my life, it being, I think, of all other studies the most suitable to a reasonable nature.  I say my being obliged, for there is every encouragement (whether one regards interest or usefulness) now-a- days for any to enter that profession, who has not got a way of commanding his assent to received opinions without examination.  I had some thoughts, Sir, of paying you my acknowledgments in person for that surprising air of candour and affability with which you have treated me in the Letters that have passed between us.  But really I could not put on so bold a face, as to intrude into a gentleman's company with no other excuse but that of having received an obligation from him.  I have not the least prospect of ever being in a capacity of giving any more than a verbal declaration of my gratitude: so I hope you'l accept that, and believe it's with the utmost sincerity I subscribe myself,  Sir,  Your most obliged, most obedient humble servant,  J. BUTLER.  Hamlin's Coffee-house, Tuesday Morning.    II.   The original of this Letter with the answer, which is roughly written on the blank leaf, is, I believe, now in the library of Oriel College, Oxford.  I am indebted for my copy to the kindness of the Rev. J. H. Newman, D.D., formerly of that College.  REV. SIR,  I had long resisted an Inclination to desire your Thoughts upon the difficulty mentioned in my last, till I considered that the trouble in answering it would be only carrying on the general purpose of your Life, and that I might claim the same right to your Instructions with others; notwithstanding which, I should not have mentioned it to you had I not thought (which is natural when one fancies one sees a thing clearly) that I could easily express it with clearness to others.  However I should by no means have given you a second trouble upon the subject had I not had your particular leave.  I thought proper just to mention these things that you might not suspect me to take advantage from your Civility to trouble you with any thing, but only such objections as seem to me of Weight, and which I cannot get rid of any other way.  A disposition in our natures to be influenced by right motives is as absolutely necessary to render us moral Agents, as a Capacity to discern right motives is. These two are I think quite _distinct_ perceptions, the _former_ proceeding from a desire inseparable from a Conscious Being of its own happiness, the _latter_ being only our Understanding, or Faculty of seeing Truth.  Since a _disposition_ to be influenced by right motives is a _sine qua non_ to Virtuous Actions, an Indifferency to right motives must _incapacitate_ us for Virtuous Actions, or render us in that particular not moral agents.  I do indeed think that no Rational Creature is _strictly speaking Indifferent_ to Right Motives, but yet there seems to be somewhat which to all intents of the present question is the same, viz. _a stronger disposition to be influenced by contrary or wrong motives_, and this I take to be always the Case when any vice is committed.  But since it may be said, as you hint, that this stronger disposition to be influenced by Vicious Motives may have been contracted by repeated Acts of Wickedness, we will pitch upon the _first Vicious Action_ any one is guilty of.  No man would have committed this first Vicious Action if he had not had a _stronger_ (at least as strong) _disposition_ in him to be influenced by the _Motives of the Vicious Action_, than by the _motives of the contrary Virtuous Action_; from whence I infallibly conclude, that since every man has committed some first Vice, every man had, _antecedent_ to the commission of it, a _stronger disposition_ to be influenced by the _Vicious_ than the _Virtuous_ motive.  My difficulty upon this is, that a _stronger natural disposition_ to be influenced by the Vicious than the Virtuous Motive (which every one has antecedent to his first vice), seems, to all purposes of the present question, to put the Man in the same condition as though he was _indifferent to the Virtuous Motive_; and since an _indifferency to the Virtuous Motive_ would have _incapacitated_ a Man from being a _moral Agent_, or _contracting guilt_, is not a _stronger disposition_ to be influenced by the _Vicious_ Motive as great an _Incapacity_?  Suppose I have two diversions offered me, _both_ of which I could not enjoy, I like both of them, but yet have a _stronger_ inclination to one than to the other, I am not indeed strictly _indifferent_ to either, because I should be glad to _enjoy both_; but am I not exactly _in the same case_, _to all intents and purposes of acting_, as though I was _absolutely indifferent_ to that diversion which I have the _least_ inclination to?  You suppose Man to be endued naturally with a _disposition to be influenced by Virtuous Motives_, and that _this Disposition is a sine qua non to Virtuous Actions_, both which I fully believe; but then you _omit_ to consider the natural Inclination to be influenced by Vicious Motives, which, _whenever a Vice is committed_, is at least _equally strong_ with the other, and in the first Vice _is not affected by Habits_, but is as _natural_, and as much _out of a man's power_ as the other.  I am much obliged to your offer of writing to Mr. Laughton, which I shall very thankfully accept of, but am not certain when I shall go to Cambridge; however, I believe it will be about the middle of the next month.  I am, Rev. Sir, Your most obliged humble Servant,  J. BUTLER.  Oriel, Oct. the 6th.   THE ANSWER.   Your objection seems indeed very dexterous, and yet I really think that there is at bottom nothing in it.  But of this you are to judge, not from my assertion, but from the reason I shall endeavour to give to it.  I think then, that a _disposition to be influenced by right motives_ being what we call _rationality_, there cannot be on the contrary (properly speaking) any such thing naturally in rational creatures as a _disposition to be influenced by wrong motives_.  This can be nothing but mere _perverseness of will_; and whether even that can be said to amount to a disposition to be influenced by wrong motives, _formally_, and as such, may (I think) well be doubted.  Men have by nature strong inclinations to certain objects.  None of these inclinations are vicious, but vice consists in pursuing the inclination towards any object in certain circumstances, notwithstanding _reason_, or the natural disposition to be influenced by right motives, declares to the man's conscience at the same time (or would do, if he attended to it) that the object ought not to be pursued in those circumstances.  Nevertheless, where the man commits the crime, the _natural disposition_ was only towards the _object_, not formally towards the doing it upon wrong motives; and generally the very essence of the crime consists in the liberty of the will forcibly overruling the _actual disposition towards being influenced by right motives_, and not at all (as you suppose) in the man's having any _natural disposition to be influenced by wrong motives_, as such.    III.   From the original, now in the library at the British Museum.  [Add. MS. 12,101.]  REV. SIR,  I had the honour of your kind letter yesterday, and must own that I do now see a _difference_ between the nature of _that disposition which we have to be influenced by virtuous motives_, and _that contrary disposition_, (or whatever else it may _properly_ be called,) which is the _occasion_ of our committing _sin_; and hope in time to get a thorough insight into this Subject by means of those helps you have been pleased to afford me.  I find it necessary to consider such very abstruse questions at different times and in different dispositions; and have found particular use of this method upon that abstract subject of _Necessity_: for tho' I did not see the force of your argument for the _unity of the Divine Nature_ when I had done writing to you upon that subject, I am now _fully satisfied_ that it is conclusive.  I will only just add that I suppose somewhat in my last letter was not clearly expressed, for I did not at all _design_ to say, that _the essence of any crime consisted in the man's having a natural disposition to be influenced by wrong motives_.  I was fully resolved to have gone to Cambridge some time in this Term, not in the least expecting but that I might have the Terms allowed there which I have kept here, but I am informed by one who has been there that it is not at all to be depended upon; but that it's "]]]
