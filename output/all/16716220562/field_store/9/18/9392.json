And he was only a boy, about Callie’s age, his black hair flopping over eyes wide with shock and fright. Drew’s hand moved, and the lantern light glinted plainly on the barrel of the Colt. For a moment they were all still as if sight of the weapon had frozen them.  The attacker faced Drew directly. He was young and handsome, if you discounted a darkening bruise already puffing under one eye, a lip cut and swelling, a scowl twisting rather heavy brows and making an ugly square of his mistreated mouth.  \"An’ who th’ devil are you?\"  His voice was thick and slurred. Drew guessed that he had not only been in a fight but that he was partly drunk. Yet, as he faced the stranger eye to eye, the Kentuckian was as wary as he had been when bellying down a Tennessee ridge crest to scout a Yankee railroad blockhouse. He knew what he fronted; this was more than a drunken bully—a really dangerous man.  That queer little moment of silence lengthened, shutting the two of them up—alone. Drew could not really name the emotion he felt. Deliberately he tried to subdue the sensation as he turned to the girl.  \"What’s the matter?\"  At first glance he might have thought her a boy, for she wore hide breeches and boots, a man’s shirt now hanging loosely about her hips. She jerked her head, and a thick braid flopped from under her wide-brimmed hat.  \"_Señor, por favor_—please—we have done no wrong. We are the Trinfans—Teodoro and me. Teodoro, he finds _Señor_ Juanito’s purse in the road, he follows to give it back. He is not a _bandido_—he is not _espía_, a spy one. We are mustangers. Ask of _Don_ Reese, of _Señor_ Kells. Why, _Señor_ Juanito, do you say Teodoro spy on you, why you hit him with the whip?\"  \"Not thief, not spy!\" The boy beside Drew dropped a wealed hand from his face. \"The man who says Teodoro Trinfan is _ladrón_—bad one—him I kill!\"  Drew’s left arm swept out across the boy’s chest, pinning him back against the stable.  \"Now, what’s your story?\" the Kentuckian asked the man he fronted.  \"An’ jus’ what’s all this smokin’ ’bout?\" Kells came out. \"You, Shannon, what’re you doin’ here? Been drinkin’ again, fightin’, too, by th’ look of you.\"  \"_Señor_ Kells.\" The girl caught at the older man’s arm. \"_Por favor, señor_, we are not thieves, not spies. We come after _Señor_ Juanito because he dropped his purse. Then he see Teodoro coming, he not listen—he beat on him with quirt. You know, we are honest peoples!\"  \"Now then, Faquita, don’t you git so upset, gal!\" She was wailing aloud, making no effort to wipe away the tears running down her cheeks. \"Johnny, what kinda game you tryin’? You know these kids are straight; them an’ their ol’ man’s come to work th’ Range for wild ones on Rennie’s own askin’. Takin’ a quirt to th’ kid, eh?\" Kells’ voice slid up the scale. \"You sure have yourself a snootful tonight! Now you jus’ walk yourself outta here on th’ bounce. I’m doin’ th’ sayin’ of what goes on, on my own property.\"  \"You do a lotta sayin’, Kells.\" The scowl was gone; Shannon’s battered mouth was actually smiling. But, Drew decided, he liked the scowl better than the smile and the tone of the voice accompanying it. \"Some men oughtta put a hobble on their tongues. Sure, I know these young whelps an’ their pa too. Sniffin’ round where they ain’t wanted. An’ mustangers ain’t above throwin’ a sticky loop when they see a hoss worth it. We ain’t blind on th’ Range.\" His head swung a little so he was looking at the girl. \"You’d better hold that in mind, gal. Double R hosses have come up missin’ lately. It’s easy to run a few prime head south to do some moonlight tradin’ at th’ border. An’ we don’t take kindly to losin’ good stock!\"  The boy lunged against Drew’s pinioning arm. \"Now he says we are horse thieves! Tell that to us before the _Don_ Cazar!\"  Shannon curled the quirt lash about his wrist. \"Don’t think I won’t, Mex! He don’t like havin’ his colt crop whittled down. You—\" Those blue eyes, brilliant, yet oddly shallow and curtained, met Drew’s for the second time. \"Don’t know who you are, stranger, but you had no call to mix in. I’ll be seein’ you. Kinda free with a gun, leastwise at showin’ it. As quick to back up your play?\"  \"Try me!\" The words came out of Drew before he thought.  Why had he said that? He had never been one to pick a fight or take up a challenge. What was there about Shannon that prodded Drew this way? He’d met the gamecock breed before and had never known the need to bristle at their crowing. Now he was disturbed that Shannon could prick him so.  Odd, the other had been successfully turned from his purpose here. Yet now as he swung around and walked away down the alley Drew was left with a nagging doubt, a feeling that in some way or other Shannon had come off even in this encounter.... But how and why?  Teodoro spat. His sister tugged at Kells’ sleeve. \"It is not true what he said. Why does he wish to make trouble?\"  \"Lissen, gal, an’ you, too, Teodoro—jus’ keep clear of Johnny Shannon when he’s on th’ prod that way. I’ve knowed that kid since he didn’t have muscle enough to pull a gun ’less he took both hands to th’ job. But he’s not needin’ any two hands to unholster now. An’ he’s drinkin’ a lot—mean, ugly drunk, he is. Somethin’ must have riled him good tonight—\"  \"In the cantina there was a soldier from the camp,\" Faquita volunteered. \"They call names. He and _Señor_ Juanito fight. _Don_ Reese, he put them both out in the street. _Señor_ Juanito he falls, drops purse. Teodoro picks it up, and we follow. When we try to give it back _Señor_ Juanito yell, ’spy,’ hit with whip. That is the truth, _por Dios_, the truth!\"  \"Yeah, sounds jus’ like Johnny these days. Him with a snootful an’ somebody yellin’ Reb and Yank. Some men can’t forgit an’ don’t seem to want to. Johnny sure takes it hard bein’ on th’ losin’ side—turned him dirt mean. Now, you kids, you stayin’ in town?\"  \"_Sí._\" Faquita nodded vigorously. \"With Tía María.\"  \"Then you git there an’ stay clear of Johnny Shannon, _sabe_? No more trouble.\"  \"_Sí, Señor_ Kells. You, _señor_,\" she spoke to Drew, \"to you we owe a big debt. Come, Teodoro!\" She caught at her brother and pulled him away.  \"What makes a kid go sour?\" Kells asked of the shadows beyond rather than of Drew. \"Johnny warn’t no real trouble ’fore he skinned off to ride with Howard. Sure he was always a wild one, but no more’n a lotta kids. An’ he’d answer th’ lead rein. ’Course we don’t know what happened to him in Texas after th’ big retreat th’ Rebs made outta here. Could be he larned a lot what was no good. Now he sops up whisky when he hits town an’ picks fights, like he didn’t git his belly full of that in th’ war. You can’t never tell how a kid’s gonna turn out.\"  \"Hey! Mister Kirby, you better git in here!\" Callie hailed from the stable. \"Th’ mare ... she’s....\"  Drew jammed the Colt under his belt and ran.    The scent of hay, of grain, of horse.... Drew’s head rolled on the pillow improvised from hay and blanket as sun lay hot across his face. He rubbed the back of his hand over his eyes and then came fully awake to remember the night before.  It took only a minute to get down the ladder into Shadow’s stall where a broom tail jiggled up and down above absurdly long baby legs and small rounded haunches. Shadow’s small daughter breakfasted. Callie squatted on his heels near-by watching the process benignly.  \"Ain’t she ’bout th’ best-favored filly you ever saw?\" he asked. \"How come all your hosses is grays? Shiloh her pa?\"  Drew shook his head. \"No, her sire’s Storm Cloud. But all that line are grays.\"  \"This Storm Cloud, he’s a runnin’ hoss?\"  \"About the runnin’est horse in his part of the country, Callie. This filly ought to pick up her heels some, if she takes after her dam and sire.\"  \"What you namin’ her?\"  Up to that moment Drew had not really thought about it. The crisp air blowing into the stable, carrying something beside the scents of the town, gave him a suggestion.  \"How about Sage, Callie?\"  The boy thought seriously and then nodded. \"Yeah—Sage. That’s gray an’ it’s purty, smells good, too.\"  Drew pulled up his shirt, dug into the pocket of the money belt for the horse papers. \"Got a pencil—or better—pen and ink around here anywhere?\"  \"Mister Kells, he keeps ledgers over in th’ tack room. Got some ink an’ a pen there. How come you need that? You ain’t makin’ out no bill of sale on her already, are you?\" Callie was shocked.  \"Hardly. Just want to put her down right and proper on the tally sheet.\"  The boy followed to watch Drew make the record on the margin of Shadow’s papers. As the Kentuckian explained, Callie was deeply interested.  \"You mean as how you can tell way back jus’ what hosses bred your hosses? That’s sure somethin’! Round here we knows a good hoss, but we ain’t always sure of his pa, not if he’s wild stuff.\"  \"Lots of wild horses hereabouts then?\"  \"Sure. Some’re jus’ mustangs; other’s good stuff gone wild—run off by th’ ’Paches an’ broke loose, or got away from a ’wet hoss’ band—\"  \"’Wet horse’ band?\"  Callie glanced at him a little sharply. \"How come you ain’t knowin’ ’bout ’wet hosses’? Heard tell as how they have ’em that same trouble down Texas way—\"  \"But I don’t come from the border country.\"  \"Well, Texas sure is a great big piece o’ country, so maybe you don’t know ’bout them river tricks. Wet hosses—they’s hosses what is run off up here, driven down to th’ border where they’s swapped for hosses what some Mex _bandidos_ have thrown a sticky loop over. Then th’ Mexes take them Anglo hosses south an’ sell ’em, where their brands ain’t gonna git nobody into noose trouble. An’ th’ stolen Mex hosses, they’s drove up here an’ maybe sold to some of th’ same fellas what lost th’ others. Hosses git themselves lost ’long them back-country trails, specially if they’s pushed hard. So them strays join up with th’ wild ones. Iffen a mustanger can rope him one an’ bring it in ... well, if it’s a good one, maybe so he’ll git a reward"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],["title","Rebel Spurs (#4)"],["body"," th’ man what’s lost him. Heard tell that _Don_ Cazar, he’s set some good rewards on a coupla studs as was run off th’ Range this summer.\"  \"_Don_ Cazar has good horses?\"  \"’Bout th’ best in these here parts. He runs ’em on th’ Range th’ old style—stud an’ twenty—twenty-five mares together in a _manada_, all one color to a band. They sure is a grand sight: band o’ roans, then one o’ duns, an’ some blacks. He’s got one _manada_ all of grullas. Sells some to th’ army, drives more clear to Californy. An’ th’ old _Dons_ down in Sonora come up once in a while to pick them out some fancy saddle stock. He sure would enjoy seem’ these grays o’ yours. Iffen you ever want to sell, _Don_ Cazar’d give you top price.\"  \"But I’m not sellin’.\" Drew folded the piece of paper he had been waving to dry the ink and put it back in the belt pocket. \"What’s that?\"  He could almost believe he heard an army bugle, but the call it sounded was unlike any cavalry signal he had known. Callie was already on his way to the door.  \"Wagon train’s comin’!\" he cried as he ran out.  Drew lingered by Shadow’s box. The filly was resting in the straw, her match-stick legs folded under her, and the mare was munching the extra feed of oats the Kentuckian had tipped in for her. He could hear the sound of other running feet outside. It would seem that all Tubacca was turning out to welcome the wagon train of traders from the south. Drew’s curiosity got the better of him. He went on out to the plaza.      3   Only a well-armed and convoyed set of wagons with a highly experienced and competent master could dare travel the Apache-infested trails these days. The first of the freighters, pulled by a sixteen-mule team, fairly burst into the plaza, outriders fanning about it. One of the mounted men was dressed in fringed buckskin, his shoulder-length hair and bushy black beard the badge of a frontier already passing swiftly into history. He rode a big black mule and carried a long-barreled rifle, not in the saddle boot, but resting across the horn as if even here in Tubacca there might be reason for instant action.  The mule trotted on to the middle of the plaza. Then the weapon pointed skyward as its owner fired into the air, voicing a whoop as wild as the Rebel Yell from the throat of a charging Texas trooper.  He was answered by cries and shouts from the gathering crowd as five more wagons, each with a trailer hooked to its main bulk, pulled in around the edge of the open area, until the center of the town was full and the din of braying mules was deafening.  Drew retreated to the roofed entrance of the Four Jacks. The extra step of height there enabled him to get a good look at two more horsemen pushing past the end wagon. Both wore the dress of Mexican gentlemen, their short jackets glinting with silver braid and embroidery; their bridles, horse gear, and saddles were rich in scrolls and decorations of the same metal. Navajo blankets lay under the saddles, and serapes were folded over the shoulder of one rider, tied behind the cantle of the other.  They pulled up before the cantina, and one man took the reins of both mounts. If the riders’ clothing and horse furnishings were colorful, the horses themselves were equally striking. One was a chestnut, a warm, well-groomed red. But the other ... Drew stared. In all his years about the stables and breeding farms of Kentucky, and throughout his travels since, he had never seen a horse like this. Its coat was pure gold, a perfect match to one of the eagles in his money belt. But the silky locks of mane and tail were night black. Its breeding was plainly Arab, and it walked with a delicate pride as gracefully as a man might foot a dance measure.  Drew had a difficult time breaking his gaze from the horse to the man dismounting. The ranchero was tall, perhaps an inch or so taller than Drew, and his body had the leanness of the men who worked the range country, possessing, too, a lithe youthfulness of carriage. Until one looked directly into his sun-browned face he could pass as a man still in his late twenties.  But he was older, perhaps a decade older than that, Drew thought. Too high and prominent cheekbones with slight hollows below them, and a mouth tight set, made more for strength of will and discipline of feeling than conventional good looks. Yet his was a face not easily forgotten, once seen. Black hair was pepper-salted for a finger-wide space above his ears, which were fronted by long sideburns, and black brows were straight above dark eyes. In spite of his below-the-border dress and his coloring, he was unmistakably Anglo, just as the man looping both horses’ reins to the rack was Mexican.  \"So, you’re still wearing your hair in good order? No trouble this trip?\" Topham had come to the door of the cantina, his hand outstretched. \"Welcome back, Hunt!\"  \"Paugh!\" The Mexican spat. \"Where is there one Indio who is able to face _Don_ Cazar on his own ground? The folly of that they learned long ago.\"  _Don_ Cazar smiled. That mask of aloofness was wiped away as if he were ten years younger and twenty years less responsible than he had been only seconds earlier. \"And if they did not beware our rifles, Bartolomé here would talk them to death! Is that not so, _amigo_?\" His speech was oddly formal, as if he were using a language other than his own, but there was a warmth to the tone which matched that sudden and surprising smile.  Topham’s arm went about the shoulders under the black-and-silver jacket, drawing _Don_ Cazar into the light, music, and excitement of the cantina. While Drew watched, the stouter back of Bartolomé cut off his first good look at his father.  So ... _that_ was _Don_ Cazar—Hunt Rennie! Drew did not know what he had expected of their first meeting. Now he could not understand why he felt so chilled and lost. He had planned it this way—no demands, no claims on a stranger, freedom to make the decision of when or how he would see his father; that was the only path he could take. But now he turned slowly away from that open door, the light, the laughter and singing, and walked back toward the stable, loneliness cutting into him.  Tubacca had slumbered apathetically before; now the town was wide awake. In a couple of days the wagon train would head on north to Tucson, but now the activity in the plaza was a mixture of market day and fiesta. Small traders from Sonora took advantage of the protection afforded by _Don_ Cazar’s outriders and had trailed along with their own products, now being spread out and hawked.  Parrots shrieked from homemade cages; brightly woven fabrics were draped to catch the eye. As he wandered about viewing cactus syrup, sweet, brown panocha-candy, fruit, dried meat, blankets, saddles, Drew was again aware of the almost strident color of this country. He fingered appreciatively a horn goblet carved with intricate figures of gods his Anglo eyes did not recognize. The hum of voices, the bray of mules, the baa-ing and naa-ing of sheep and goats, kept up a roar to equal surf on a seacoast. Afternoon was fast fading into evening, but Tubacca, aroused from the post-noon siesta, was in tumult.  A fighting cock tethered to a cart wheel stretched its neck to the utmost in an attempt to peck at Drew’s spurs. He laughed, attracted, wrenched out of his own private world. The smell of spicy foods, of fruit, of animals and people ... the clamor ... the sights....  Drew rounded one end of a wagon and stepped abruptly into yet another world and time. All the stories which had been dinned warningly into his ears since he had left the Mississippi now brought his hand to one of the Colts at his belt. Most of the half-dozen men squatting on their heels about a fire were three-quarters bare, showing dusty, brown bodies. Two had dirty calico shirts loose above hide breech-clouts. Dark-brown eyes, as unreadable as Johnny Shannon’s, surveyed Drew, but none of the Indians moved or spoke.  Common sense took over, and Drew’s hand dropped from the gun butt. Hostiles would not be camping peacefully here in the heart of town. He could not be facing wild Apaches or Navajos. But they were the first Indians he had seen this close since he had ridden out of Texas.  \"Somethin’ buggin’ you, boy?\"  Drew’s war-trained muscles took over. He was in a half crouch, the Colt flipped over and out, pointing into the shadows where the newcomer emerged. Then the Kentuckian flushed and slammed his weapon back into the holster. This was the buckskinned man who had whooped the train into town that morning.  \"Mite quick to show your iron, ain’t you?\" There was a chill in the question, and Drew saw that the long rifle was still held at alert by its owner.  \"Cat-footin’ up on a man ought to make you expect somethin’ of a reception,\" Drew countered.  \"Yep, guess some men has sure got ’em a bellyful of lead doin’ that.\" To Drew’s surprise the other was now grinning. \"You huntin’ someone?\"  \"No, just lookin’ around.\" Drew longed to ask some things himself, but hesitated. Frontier etiquette was different from Kentucky custom; it was safer to be quiet when not sure.  \"Wal, thar’s aplenty to see tonight, right enough. Me—I’m Crow Fenner; I ride scout fur th’ train. An’ these here—they’re Rennie’s Pimas, what o’ ’em is runnin’ th’ trail this trip.\"  So these were the famous Pima Scouts! No wonder they took their ease in the Tubacca plaza. Every man, woman, and child in those adobe buildings had reason to be thankful for their skill and cunning—the web of protection Rennie’s Pima Scouts had woven in this river valley.  \"I’m Kirby, Drew Kirby.\" He hastened to match one introduction with another. \"This is my first time in the valley—\"  \"From th’ east, eh?\"  \"Texas.\"  \"Texas....\" Something in the way Fenner repeated that made it sound not like a confirmation but a question. Or was Drew overly suspicious? After all, as Callie had agreed last night, the late Republic of Texas was a very large strip of country, housing a multitude of "]]]
