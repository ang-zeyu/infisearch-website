I could not but wonder whether John's love for me was what it had been. Was it cooling? I asked myself. And what was cooling it? It hardly seemed possible, when I looked back to the wild passion with which he had proposed to me on the garden bench, that John's love was waning. But I kept noticing different little things. One day in the spring-time I saw John getting out a lot of fishing tackle from a box and fitting it together. I asked him what he was going to do, and he said that he was going to fish. I went to my room and had a good cry. It seemed dreadful that he could neglect his wife for a few worthless fish.  So I decided to put John to the test. It had been my habit every morning after he put his coat on to go to the office to let John have one kiss, just one weeny kiss, to keep him happy all day. So this day when he was getting ready I bent my head over a big bowl of flowers and pretended not to notice. I think John must have been hurt, as I heard him steal out on tiptoe.  Well, I realized that things had come to a dreadful state, and so I sent over to Mother, and Mother came, and we had a good cry together. I made up my mind to force myself to face things and just to be as bright as ever I could. Mother and I both thought that things would be better if I tried all I could to make something out of John. I have always felt that every woman should make all that she can out of her husband. So I did my best first of all to straighten up John's appearance. I shifted the style of collar he was wearing to a tighter kind that I liked better, and I brushed his hair straight backward instead of forward, which gave him a much more alert look. Mother said that John needed waking up, and so we did all we could to wake him up. Mother came over to stay with me a good deal, and in the evenings we generally had a little music or a game of cards.  About this time another difficulty began to come into my married life, which I suppose I ought to have foreseen--I mean the attentions of other gentlemen. I have always called forth a great deal of admiration in gentlemen, but I have always done my best to act like a lady and to discourage it in every possible way. I had been innocent enough to suppose that this would end with married life, and it gave me a dreadful shock to realize that such was not the case. The first one I noticed was a young man who came to the house, at an hour when John was out, for the purpose, so he said at least, of reading the gas meter. He looked at me in just the boldest way and asked me to show him the way to the cellar. I don't know whether it was a pretext or not, but I just summoned all the courage I had and showed him to the head of the cellar stairs. I had determined that if he tried to carry me down with him I would scream for the servants, but I suppose something in my manner made him desist, and he went alone. When he came up he professed to have read the meter and he left the house quite quietly. But I thought it wiser to say nothing to John of what had happened.  There were others too. There was a young man with large brown eyes who came and said he had been sent to tune the piano. He came on three separate days, and he bent his ear over the keys in such a mournful way that I knew he must have fallen in love with me. On the last day he offered to tune my harp for a dollar extra, but I refused, and when I asked him instead to tune Mother's mandoline he said he didn't know how. Of course I told John nothing of all this.  Then there was Mr. McQueen, who came to the house several times to play cribbage with John. He had been desperately in love with me years before--at least I remember his taking me home from a hockey match once, and what a struggle it was for him not to come into the parlour and see Mother for a few minutes when I asked him; and, though he was married now and with three children, I felt sure when he came to play cribbage with John that it _meant_ something. He was very discreet and honourable, and never betrayed himself for a moment, and I acted my part as if there was nothing at all behind. But one night, when he came over to play and John had had to go out, he refused to stay even for an instant. He had got his overshoes off before I told him that John was out, and asked him if he wouldn't come into the parlour and hear Mother play the mandoline, but he just made one dive for his overshoes and was gone. I knew that he didn't dare to trust himself.  Then presently a new trouble came. I began to suspect that John was drinking. I don't mean for a moment that he was drunk, or that he was openly cruel to me. But at times he seemed to act so queerly, and I noticed that one night when by accident I left a bottle of raspberry vinegar on the sideboard overnight, it was all gone in the morning. Two or three times when McQueen and John were to play cribbage, John would fetch home two or three bottles of bevo with him and they would sit sipping all evening.  I think he was drinking bevo by himself, too, though I could never be sure of it. At any rate he often seemed queer and restless in the evenings, and instead of staying in his den he would wander all over the house. Once we heard him--I mean Mother and I and two lady friends who were with us that evening--quite late (after ten o'clock) apparently moving about in the pantry. \"John,\" I called, \"is that you?\" \"Yes, Minn,\" he answered, quietly enough, I admit. \"What are you doing there?\" I asked. \"Looking for something to eat,\" he said. \"John,\" I said, \"you are forgetting what is due to me as your wife. You were fed at six. Go back.\"  He went. But yet I felt more and more that his love must be dwindling to make him act as he did. I thought it all over wearily enough and asked myself whether I had done everything I should to hold my husband's love. I had kept him in at nights. I had cut down his smoking. I had stopped his playing cards. What more was there that I could do?         *       *       *       *       *  So at last the conviction came to me that I must go away. I felt that I must get away somewhere and think things out. At first I thought of Palm Beach, but the season had not opened and I felt somehow that I couldn't wait. I wanted to get away somewhere by myself and just face things as they were. So one morning I said to John, \"John, I think I'd like to go off somewhere for a little time, just to be by myself, dear, and I don't want you to ask to come with me or to follow me, but just let me go.\" John said, \"All right, Minn. When are you going to start?\" The cold brutality of it cut me to the heart, and I went upstairs and had a good cry and looked over steamship and railroad folders. I thought of Havana for a while, because the pictures of the harbour and the castle and the queer Spanish streets looked so attractive, but then I was afraid that at Havana a woman alone by herself might be simply persecuted by attentions from gentlemen. They say the Spanish temperament is something fearful. So I decided on Bermuda instead. I felt that in a beautiful, quiet place like Bermuda I could think everything all over and face things, and it said on the folder that there were always at least two English regiments in garrison there, and the English officers, whatever their faults, always treat a woman with the deepest respect.  So I said nothing more to John, but in the next few days I got all my arrangements made and my things packed. And when the last afternoon came I sat down and wrote John a long letter, to leave on my boudoir table, telling him that I had gone to Bermuda. I told him that I wanted to be alone: I said that I couldn't tell when I would be back--that it might be months, or it might be years, and I hoped that he would try to be as happy as he could and forget me entirely, and to send me money on the first of every month.         *       *       *       *       *  Well, it was just at that moment that one of those strange coincidences happen, little things in themselves, but which seem to alter the whole course of a person's life. I had nearly finished the letter to John that I was to leave on the writing-desk, when just then the maid came up to my room with a telegram. It was for John, but I thought it my duty to open it and read it for him before I left. And I nearly fainted when I saw that it was from a lawyer in Bermuda--of all places--and it said that a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars had been left to John by an uncle of his who had died there, and asking for instructions about the disposition of it.  A great wave seemed to sweep over me, and all the wicked thoughts that had been in my mind--for I saw now that they _were_ wicked--were driven clean away. I thought how completely lost poor old John would feel if all this money came to him and he didn't have to work any more and had no one at his side to help and guide him in using it.  I tore up the wicked letter I had written, and I hurried as fast as I could to pack up a valise with John's things (my own were packed already, as I said). Then presently John came in, and I broke the news to him as gently and as tenderly as I could about his uncle having left him the money and having died. I told him that I had found out all about the trains and the Bermuda steamer, and had everything all packed and ready for us to leave at once. John seemed a little dazed about it all, and kept saying that his uncle had taught him to play tennis when he was a little boy, and he was very grateful and thankful to me for having everything arranged, and thought it wonderful.  I had time to telephone to a few of my women friends, and they just managed to rush round for a few minutes to say good-bye. I couldn't help crying a little when I told them about John's uncle dying so far away with none of us near him, and I told them about the legacy, and they cried a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20633"],["title","Winsome Winnie and other New Nonsense Novels (#5)"],["body","to hear of it all; and when I told them that John and I might not come back direct from Bermuda, but might take a run over to Europe first, they all cried some more.  We left for New York that evening, and after we had been to Bermuda and arranged about a suitable monument for John's uncle and collected the money, we sailed for Europe.  All through the happy time that has followed, I like to think that through all our trials and difficulties affliction brought us safely together at last.     III  THE SPLIT IN THE CABINET  OR, THE FATE OF ENGLAND  (_A political novel of the Days that Were_)     _III.--The Split in the Cabinet; or, The Fate of England._     CHAPTER I   \"The fate of England hangs upon it,\" murmured Sir John Elphinspoon, as he sank wearily into an armchair. For a moment, as he said \"England,\" the baronet's eye glistened and his ears lifted as if in defiance, but as soon as he stopped saying it his eye lost its brilliance and his ears dropped wearily at the sides of his head.  Lady Elphinspoon looked at her husband anxiously. She could not conceal from herself that his face, as he sank into his chair, seemed somehow ten years older than it had been ten years ago.  \"You are home early, John?\" she queried.  \"The House rose early, my dear,\" said the baronet.  \"For the All England Ping-Pong match?\"  \"No, for the Dog Show. The Prime Minister felt that the Cabinet ought to attend. He said that their presence there would help to bind the colonies to us. I understand also that he has a pup in the show himself. He took the Cabinet with him.\"  \"And why not you?\" asked Lady Elphinspoon.  \"You forget, my dear,\" said the baronet, \"as Foreign Secretary my presence at a Dog Show might be offensive to the Shah of Persia. Had it been a Cat Show----\"  The baronet paused and shook his head in deep gloom.  \"John,\" said his wife, \"I feel that there is something more. Did anything happen at the House?\"  Sir John nodded.  \"A bad business,\" he said. \"The Wazuchistan Boundary Bill was read this afternoon for the third time.\"  No woman in England, so it was generally said, had a keener political insight than Lady Elphinspoon.  \"The third time,\" she repeated thoughtfully, \"and how many more will it have to go?\"  Sir John turned his head aside and groaned.  \"You are faint,\" exclaimed Lady Elphinspoon, \"let me ring for tea.\"  The baronet shook his head.  \"An egg, John--let me beat you up an egg.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" murmured Sir John, still abstracted, \"beat it, yes, do beat it.\"  Lady Elphinspoon, in spite of her elevated position as the wife of the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, held it not beneath her to perform for her husband the plainest household service. She rang for an egg. The butler broke it for her into a tall goblet filled with old sherry, and the noble lady, with her own hands, beat the stuff out of it. For the veteran politician, whose official duties rarely allowed him to eat, an egg was a sovereign remedy. Taken either in a goblet of sherry or in a mug of rum, or in half a pint of whisky, it never failed to revive his energies.  The effect of the egg was at once visible in the brightening of his eye and the lengthening of his ears.  \"And now explain to me,\" said his wife, \"what has happened. What _is_ this Boundary Bill?\"  \"We never meant it to pass,\" said Sir John. \"It was introduced only as a sop to public opinion. It delimits our frontier in such a way as to extend our suzerainty over the entire desert of El Skrub. The Wazoos have claimed that this is their desert. The hill tribes are restless. If we attempt to advance the Wazoos will rise. If we retire it deals a blow at our prestige.\"  Lady Elphinspoon shuddered. Her long political training had taught her that nothing was so fatal to England as to be hit in the prestige.  \"And on the other hand,\" continued Sir John, \"if we move sideways, the Ohulîs, the mortal enemies of the Wazoos, will strike us in our rear.\"  \"In our rear!\" exclaimed Lady Elphinspoon in a tone of pain. \"Oh, John, we must go forward. Take another egg.\"  \"We cannot,\" groaned the Foreign Secretary. \"There are reasons which I cannot explain even to you, Caroline, reasons of State, which absolutely prevent us from advancing into Wazuchistan. Our hands are tied. Meantime if the Wazoos rise, it is all over with us. It will split the Cabinet.\"  \"Split the Cabinet!\" repeated Lady Elphinspoon in alarm. She well knew that next to a blow in the prestige the splitting of the Cabinet was about the worst thing that could happen to Great Britain. \"Oh, John, they _must_ be held together at all costs. Can nothing be done?\"  \"Everything is being done that can be. The Prime Minister has them at the Dog Show at this moment. To-night the Chancellor is taking them to moving pictures. And to-morrow--it is a State secret, my dear, but it will be very generally known in the morning--we have seats for them all at the circus. If we can hold them together all is well, but if they split we are undone. Meantime our difficulties increase. At the very passage of the Bill itself a question was asked by one of the new labour members, a miner, my dear, a quite uneducated man----\"  \"Yes?\" queried Lady Elphinspoon.  \"He asked the Colonial Secretary\"--Sir John shuddered--\"to tell him where Wazuchistan is. Worse than that, my dear,\" added Sir John, \"he defied him to tell him where it is.\"  \"What did you do? Surely he has no right to information of that sort?\"  \"It was a close shave. Luckily the Whips saved us. They got the Secretary out of the House and rushed him to the British Museum. When he got back he said that he would answer the question a month from Friday. We got a great burst of cheers, but it was a close thing. But stop, I must speak at once with Powers. My despatch box, yes, here it is. Now where is young Powers? There is work for him to do at once.\"  \"Mr. Powers is in the conservatory with Angela,\" said Lady Elphinspoon.  \"With Angela!\" exclaimed Sir John, while a slight shade of displeasure appeared upon his brow. \"With Angela again! Do you think it quite proper, my dear, that Powers should be so constantly with Angela?\"  \"John,\" said his wife, \"you forget, I think, who Mr. Powers is. I am sure that Angela knows too well what is due to her rank, and to herself, to consider Mr. Powers anything more than an instructive companion. And I notice that, since Mr. Powers has been your secretary, Angela's mind is much keener. Already the girl has a wonderful grasp on foreign policy. Only yesterday I heard her asking the Prime Minister at luncheon whether we intend to extend our Senegambian protectorate over the Fusees. He was delighted.\"  \"Oh, very well, very well,\" said Sir John. Then he rang a bell for a manservant.  \"Ask Mr. Powers,\" he said, \"to be good enough to attend me in the library.\"     CHAPTER II   Angela Elphinspoon stood with Perriton Powers among the begonias of the conservatory. The same news which had so agitated Sir John lay heavy on both their hearts.  \"Will the Wazoo rise?\" asked Angela, clasping her hands before her, while her great eyes sought the young man's face and found it. \"Oh, Mr. Powers! Tell me, will they rise? It seems too dreadful to contemplate. Do you think the Wazoo will rise?\"  \"It is only too likely,\" said Powers. They stood looking into one another's eyes, their thoughts all on the Wazoo.  Angelina Elphinspoon, as she stood there against the background of the begonias, made a picture that a painter, or even a plumber, would have loved. Tall and typically English in her fair beauty, her features, in repose, had something of the hauteur and distinction of her mother, and when in motion they recalled her father.  Perriton Powers was even taller than Angela. The splendid frame and stern features of Sir John's secretary made him a striking figure. Yet he was, quite frankly, sprung from the people, and made no secret of it. His father had been simply a well-to-do London surgeon, who had been knighted for some mere discoveries in science. His grandfather, so it was whispered, had been nothing more than a successful banker who had amassed a fortune simply by successful banking. Yet at Oxford young Powers had carried all before him. He had occupied a seat, a front seat, in one of the boats, had got his blue and his pink, and had taken a double final in Sanscrit and Arithmetic.  He had already travelled widely in the East, spoke Urdu and Hoodoo with facility, while as secretary to Sir John Elphinspoon, with a seat in the House in prospect, he had his foot upon the ladder of success.  \"Yes,\" repeated Powers thoughtfully, \"they may rise. Our confidential despatches tell us that for some time they have been secretly passing round packets of yeast. The whole tribe is in a ferment.\"  \"But our sphere of influence is at stake,\" exclaimed Angela.  \"It is,\" said Powers. \"As a matter of fact, for over a year we have been living on a mere _modus vivendi_.\"  \"Oh, Mr. Powers,\" cried Angela, \"what a way to live.\"  \"We have tried everything,\" said the secretary. \"We offered the Wazoo a condominium over the desert of El Skrub. They refused it.\"  \"But it's our desert,\" said Angela proudly.  \"It is. But what can we do? The best we can hope is that El Boob will acquiesce in the _status quo_.\"  At that moment a manservant appeared in the doorway of the conservatory.  \"Mr. Powers, sir,\" he said, \"Sir John desires your attendance, sir, in the library, sir.\"  Powers turned to Angela, a new seriousness upon his face.  \"Miss Elphinspoon,\" he said, \"I think I know what is coming. Will you wait for me here? I shall be back in half an hour.\"  \"I will wait,\" said the girl. She sat down and waited among the begonias, her mind still on the Wazoo, her whole intense nature strung to the highest pitch. \"Can the _modus vivendi_ hold?\" she murmured.  In half an hour Powers returned. He was wearing now his hat and light overcoat, and carried on a strap round his neck a tin box with a white painted label, \"_British Foreign "]]]
