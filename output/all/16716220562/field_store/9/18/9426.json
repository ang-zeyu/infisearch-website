There were three Earthwomen in the party. There was nothing peculiar about them. They were rather handsome, dissolute in appearance, all of them obviously befuddled by alcholite. There was a man who could have been Anglo-Saxon. A wastrel, probably, with more money than wit; he wore a black dinner suit edged with white.  Our attention focussed upon the other two. They were tall, as are all Martians. The young woman, _Setta_ Meka, seemed perhaps twenty or twenty-five years of age, by Earth reckoning, in stature perhaps very nearly my own height, which is six feet two. It is difficult to tell a Martian's age, but she was very handsome, even by Earth standards; and in Ferrok-Shahn she would be considered a beauty. Her gray-black hair was parted and tied at the back with a plaited metal rope. Her short dark cloak, so luminous a fabric that it caught and reflected the sheen of all the gaudy restaurant lights, was parted, its ends thrown back over her shoulders. Beneath it she wore the characteristic Martian leather jacket, and short, wide leather trousers ornamented with spun metal fringes and tassels. Most Martian women have an amazonian aspect, but I saw now that _Setta_ Meka was an exception.  Her brother, who sat beside her, was a full seven feet or more. A hulking sort of fellow, far less spindly than most of his race, he might have come from the polar outposts beyond the Martian Union. He was bare-headed, his gray-black hair clipped close upon a round bullet head, with the familiar Martian round eyes.  I gazed into the face of Molo, as momentarily he turned his head. It was a rough-hewn, strongly masculine face with a hawk-like nose, bushy black brows frowning above deepset round eyes. The face of a keen scoundrel, I could not doubt, though the smooth-plucked gray skin was flushed now with alcholite, and the wide, thin-lipped mouth was leering at the woman across the table from him.  Like his sister, he had thrown back his cloak, disclosing a brawny, powerful figure, leather clad, with a wide belt of dangling ornaments, some of which probably were weapons.  How long we gazed at this silent colored image of the restaurant table I do not know. I was aware of Halsey's quiet voice: \"Look him over, Miss Venza. It depends on you.\"  Another interval passed. It seemed, as we watched, that Molo's interest in his party was very slight. I got the impression, too, that though at first he had seemed to be intoxicated, actually he was not. Nor was his sister. Anxiety seemed upon her; the smile she had for jests seemed forced; and at intervals she would cast a swift, furtive glance across the gay restaurant scene.  More drinks arrived. The Earthpeople at the table here seemed upon the verge of stupor; and suddenly it appeared that Molo had completely lost interest in them. With a gesture to his sister, he abruptly rose from his seat. She joined him. They left the table, and a red-clad floor manager of the restaurant came at their call. Then in a moment they were moving across the room.  Halsey called sharply into his audiphone: \"Francis! Hold us to them if you can.\"  They were standing now by the opened door of one of the Red Spark's private insulated rooms. We caught a glimpse of its interior, a gaily set table with a bank of colored lights over it.  The figure of a man was in there. He was on his feet, as though he had just arrived to meet the Martians here, and a hooded long cloak enveloped him. It may have been a magnetic \"invisible\" cloak, with the current now off.  We caught only the fleetest of impressions before the insulated door closed and barred our vision. The glimpse was an accident. Molo, taken by surprise at this appearance of his visitor, could hardly have guarded against it. The waiting figure was very tall, some ten feet, and very thin. The hood shrouded his face and head. In his hand he held a large circular box of black shiny leather, of the sort in which women carry wide-brimmed hats. As Molo joined him he put the box gently on the floor. He handled it as though it were extraordinarily heavy; and as he took a step or two, he seemed weighted down. Just as the room door was hastily closing, Meka sliding it from the inside, we caught a fleeting glimpse of horror.  The lid of the hat box had lifted up. Inside was a great round thing of gray-white, a living thing; a distended ball of membrane, with a network of veins and blood-vessels showing beneath the transparent skin.  For the instant we gazed, stricken. The ball was palpitating, breathing! I saw convolutions of inner tissue under the transparent skin of membrane; a little tentacle, like an arm with a flat-webbed hand, was holding up the lid of the box. The lid rose a trifle higher; the colored lights overhead gave us a brief but clear view of it.  The thing in the box was a huge living brain. I saw goggling, protruding eyes; an orifice that could have been a nose, and a gash upended for a vertical mouth. It was a face. And the little tentacle arm holding up the box-lid was joined to where the ear should have been.  Was this something human? A huge distended human brain, with the body withered to that tiny arm?  The palpitating thing sank down in the box and the lid dropped. And upon our horrified gaze the insulated door of the room slid too.  \"By the gods!\" exclaimed Halsey. \"One of them dares come to the Red Spark. Here, almost in public.\"  So Halsey knew what this meant. His eyes were blazing now; his face was white, with an intensity of emotion that transfigured it.  \"Francis, tell Foley I'll be in the manager's office in five minutes.\"  He snapped off; our image connection with the Red Spark went dead.  \"We're going to the Red Spark,\" he announced. \"This changes everything, yet I don't know. Venza, I may need you more than ever, now.\"  Halsey herded us to the office door. From his desk he had snatched up a few portable instruments, and he flung on a cloak.  It was a brief trip to the Red Spark, on foot through the sub-cellar arcade to where, under Park Circle 29, we went up in a vertical lift to the roof. We were in the side entrance oval of the restaurant in five minutes.  In the dim metal room of Orentino, the Red Spark's manager, a barrage was up and Foley was waiting for us. We could hear it faintly humming. Now we could talk.  Halsey slammed the door down. He said swiftly, \"My men caught one of these things this morning. They have it now and I think Molo does not yet know we captured it. A brain; we're convinced it understands English and can talk, but no one has been able to make it talk yet. Foley, order that damned Orentino to de-insulate the room Molo is in. Now, by the gods, we may see and hear something.\"  The frightened manager of the Red Spark was in the control room. Halsey killed our barrage to let the outside connections get through to us. We all crowded around the mirror-grid which stood on Orentino's desk. Foley gave us connection with the control room. We saw Orentino's face, his eyes nearly popping with fright. \"Colonel Halsey, I will do whatever you tell me.\"  \"What room is that Martian occupying?\"  \"Insulated 39.\"  \"Break off the insulation. Do it slowly and he may not notice. Then give us connection, audio and vision.\"  \"But I have no image-finders in the insulated rooms.\"  \"Cut off the barrage. I'll get connection there.\"  Foley was already setting up his eavesdropper on the desk. The mirror blurred a little; then it clarified. We had the interior of the secret room, and voices were coming out of Foley's tiny receiver.  The image showed the box on the floor, with its lid down. The tall hooded shape of the stranger stood with Molo and his sister by the table. They were talking in swift, vehement undertones. The language was Martian, a dialect principally used in Ferrok-Shahn. Our equipment brought it in and I could understand it.  Molo was saying: \"But you are the fool to have dared to come here!\"  \"The master knows that there is danger. Something is wrong.\" The hooded stranger spoke like a foreigner, but not a Martian, nor an Earthman, and not like any person of Venus I had ever heard. It was a strange, indescribable intonation, a flat, hollow voice.  \"I say the master is concerned.\"  \"Let him be.\"  \"And he demanded I bring him here to find you. He is displeased that you are here.\"  What gruesome thing was this? Their glances seemed to go to the box on the floor at their feet, as though the master were in there. But the lid of the box did not rise.  \"Well, you have found me,\" Molo declared impatiently. \"When you know me better, always you will find I have my wits. The thing is for tomorrow night, not tonight.\"  \"But that, my master is not sure.\" The hollow voice was deferential but insistent. \"He fears danger; something has gone wrong. He is working on it now, striving to receive the message! There is a message. He knows that much. Perhaps from our world, Wandl, itself.\"  For a moment Molo had no answer. His sister had not spoken. I noticed that her gaze seemed roving the room.  \"What is it I should do?\" Molo asked at last.  \"Come with us to your home-room.\"  \"But I have everything ready there. The contact is ready for tomorrow night. Your world will control Earth.\"  \"But if it be tonight?\"  Again Molo was silent. My breath stopped. On our mirror I saw the stranger's hood part just a little. There seemed to be no face; just the blur of something brownish.  \"But if it be tonight?\" the voice insisted.  \"I will go,\" Molo said abruptly, \"but your coming here was dangerous. Suppose we cannot get out undetected? You know I will never go to where all our instruments are set up and have some damnable spy follow me. Is all going well on Venus and Mars?\"  \"Yes. My master feels so. He seems to get messages. The contacts will be made simultaneously.\" A gruesome chuckle. \"The capture of these three worlds. We shall have all three enchained at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20859"],["title","Wandl the Invader (#3)"],["body","nce. Helpless.\"  The lid of the black box seemed again about to rise when there came a sharp cry from Meka. \"This room is not insulated!\"  Our eavesdropping was discovered. Beside me, I heard Halsey give a low curse. On our mirror we saw sudden action. The ten-foot, cloaked figure laboriously lifted the black box, and swung with it toward the outer wall of the room. I saw now clearly with what a dragging, heavy tread that giant shape moved, as though it weighed, here on Earth, far more than the normal weight to which it was accustomed.  \"Over there!\" Molo gasped. \"The escape-port; this room has one. Meka, go with him. I will join you. You know where.\"  Foley cried, \"Colonel, I may be able to stop them!\"  But Halsey saw on our image that Molo was staying. \"Wait. Let them go. If we have the Martian here, that's better.\"  I saw the room's escape-port swing open as Meka and the hooded shape carrying the box moved for it. The moonlit darkness of the outer catwalk enveloped the disappearing figures.  Molo was left alone. He closed the port swiftly. His detector now was in his hand, but Halsey anticipated him by a second or two. Our listener went dead; our mirror darkened. Doubtless Molo was never sure whether he had been spied on or not.  Halsey was on his feet. \"Foley, get out into the main room. Stay with him.\"  But there was no need to follow Molo. He had sent his visitor and sister out by the escape-port, which was usual enough; now he was back in the main room as though nothing of importance had happened, with an appearance of intoxication about him. He wavered jovially across the room, threading his way through the gay diners, and reached the table where his party still sat carousing.  Again Halsey shut us off.  \"He's got a base somewhere in the city; you heard what they said about it. We've got to trick him into going there, unsuspecting.\"  Halsey seized the audiphone. \"Your chance, Venza. It's the only way. Foley, keep away from that Martian. Shut off all contacts. I'll meet you out there in a moment. I'm sending a girl; she'll go after him.\"  \"Now?\" Venza asked.  \"Yes. It's the only way. Perhaps you can get him drinking. Venza, use all the wiles you possess now.\"  \"No!\" gasped Snap. \"It's too dangerous!\"  Anita was clinging to Venza. \"Colonel Halsey, I'm going too.\"  Halsey stared, then made a swift decision. \"Right. That is still better.\"  I jumped to my feet. \"Colonel, I should prefer that one of us men....\"  He gripped me by the shoulders. \"Gregg Haljan, I take no suggestions from you!\" His blazing eyes bored into me. \"There isn't a second to lose. Don't you realize this means destruction of our three inhabited planets? I'll sacrifice myself, you, or these girls! Venza, take Anita outside. I'll join you immediately, give you last instructions. Take a portable audiphone with you.\"  He turned to Snap. \"This is the only way. These demons can't be forced. You know that.\"  The girls were moving toward the door. I met Snap's anguished gaze.  \"Gregg, don't let them go!\"  \"No! No, I won't!\"  I made a lunge past Halsey, with Snap after me. Halsey did not move, but one of his rays struck us. With all senses numbed, I felt myself falling.  \"Gregg--don't--let them....\"  Snap had tumbled upon me. My senses did not quite fade. I was aware of Anita's and Venza's horrified cries, but Halsey pushed them toward the door. It slid up. I vaguely saw the two girls going out with Halsey after them; and the door coming down.     3   I have no idea how long it was before Halsey came back. Snap and I were seated on a low metal bench against the wall. The effect of the paralysing ray was wearing off. We were tingling all over, our senses still confused.  Halsey stalked in upon us. \"So you are recovered?\"  Snap stammered, \"We--I say, we're sorry as hell we acted like that.\"  \"I know you are.\" His voice softened. \"If I could have done anything else, believe me, I would have. But I don't think harm will come to them. They're clever.\"  \"Are they outside?\" I asked. \"Did they find a way of meeting the Martians? How long have you been gone?\"  Halsey merely stared at me as though he had no intention of answering. And then the audiphone on the desk buzzed.  \"This is Halsey,\" he said. \"Yes, I have them here. Bring them--did you say bring them?\"  We could not hear the answering voice, for Halsey had the muffler in contact.  \"No, I would prefer not to come. I'm watching something. I'm at the Red Spark Cafe. Well, I'm going back to my office presently to wait there.\"  He continued in code. Like Snap, I had never had occasion to learn it. The words were a strange sounding staccato gibberish. He ended, \"I will send them, Grantline. Very well, I'll tell them to locate him. At once, yes.\" He closed off the audiphone.  Halsey swung on us. \"You're all right now?\"  \"Yes.\" I stood up, drawing Snap up with me. \"What is wanted of us Colonel?\"  \"That's better, Gregg.\" He smiled, but he was still grim. \"I wanted you here to wait for this call from the Conclave of Public Safety. It met at midnight. They have ordered both of you there.\"  \"That's a secret meeting, isn't it?\" asked Snap. \"There was no report of it over the air tonight.\"  \"Yes. Secret.\" He was leading us to the door. \"They won't need you for more than half an hour. When they finish, come back to my office. You can come openly.\" He stood with his finger on the door lever. \"Good-by, lads. Foley will lead you to the service room. You are to take a mail cylinder for Postal Switch-station 20. They'll re-route you from there to the conclave auditorium.\"  The door slid up. \"When you disembark,\" he added, \"Ask for Johnny Grantline. You are to sit with him.\"  He showed us out and the door slid down before him. We trudged the corridor, and Snap gripped me.  \"For myself,\" he whispered swiftly, \"I'll go to the damnable conclave because I'm ordered. But I won't stay there long. Once we get out of it, if I don't route myself back to the Red Spark, I'm a motor-oiler.\"  I agreed with him. We had a mental picture of Anita and Venza in the Red Spark's public room. Doubtless Orentino had created a way for them to meet Molo. They would sit there in the Red Spark with that drinking party, and in less than an hour we would be back.  But as we crossed diagonally across an end of the main room with Foley leading us, we caught a glimpse of Molo's table. The party was still there, but Molo, Anita, and Venza were gone!  We had no time to get any information. Foley abruptly left us and another man took his place. In the service room a passenger cylinder was waiting. Our guide entered it with us.  At the switch station we had the breath knocked out of us. After another ten minutes in the vacuum tube, we reached our unknown destination. The cylinder-slide opened. We found ourselves with a lone guard; and through a gloomy arcade opening, Johnny Grantline was advancing, to greet us.  \"Well, so here you are, Gregg. Hell to pay heaven, going on here. Come on in; I'll tell you.\"  \"We were sent for,\" Snap said.  \"Yes, but they don't want you yet. Come in here.\"  He waved away the guard and led us through a padded arcade into a low-vaulted audience room, windowless and gloomy. Across it, a doorway panel stood ajar. Grantline peered through it. There was the glow of light from the adjoining room and the distant murmur of many voices.  Grantline closed the door. \"Sit down and I'll tell you....\"  \"Where are we?\" I asked.  \"The ninth Conclave Hall.\"  I knew its location: Lower Manhattan, high under the city roof.  Grantline produced little cigarette cylinders. \"Steady your nerves, lads; you'll need it.\"  He grinned at us. The hand with which he lighted my cylinder was steady as a tower-base, but he was excited. I could see it by the glint in his eyes, and hear it in his voice.  \"What's going on?\" Snap demanded.  \"It's about this invading planet. By the gods, when you hear what's really been learned about it!\"  \"Well, what?\" I asked.  He sketched what he had heard this night at the conclave. The mysterious invader was inhabited.  \"How do they know that?\" Snap put in.  \"Wait. I'll tell you the rest of it. The accursed thing changes its orbit. It banks and turns like a spaceship! It stopped out in space; it's poised out there now between Mars and Jupiter. A world about a fifth the size of the Moon, and the beings on it can control its movements. They've brought it in from interstellar space, into our solar system. Evidently the point they've reached now is far as they want to come. They've poised out there, getting ready to attack, not only us, but Mars and Venus simultaneously.\"  Grantline gazed at us through the smoke of his cigarette. He was much like Snap, small, wiry, brisk of movement and manner, but older. His hair was graying at the temples; his voice carried the authority of one accustomed to commanding men.  \"Don't ask me for the technicalities of how they reached these conclusions. I'm no astronomer. I'm only telling you their conclusions and what their discussions have been here for the past hour.\"  Heaven knows, we had no inclination to dispute him. What we had seen and heard at the Red Spark tallied with his words.  He went on swiftly, \"The attack, of whatever nature it may be, is impending at once. Not next month, or next week, but now. Lord, Gregg, I don't blame you for staring like that. You don't know what's been going on for the past two days on Earth, and Venus and Mars. It's all been suppressed. Neither did I, until I heard it here tonight. The U.S.W., the Martian Union, the Venus Free State, are all preparing for war. Every government spaceship on Earth is being commissioned. We're not going to sit around and wait for invaders to land; the war won't be fought on Earth if we can help it.\"  We stared. Snap asked, \"What makes them so sure?\"  \"That war is coming? Plenty. This new planet has sent out spaceships. The planet itself is hovering sixty million miles away from us, about forty million miles from Mars and"]]]
