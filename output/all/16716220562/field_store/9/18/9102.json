Ax' heem de nort' win' w'at he see     Of de Voyageur long ago,   An' he 'll say to you w'at he say to me,     So lissen hees story well--   \"I see de track of hees botte sau-vage[2]   On many a hill an' long portage   Far far away from hees own vill-age     An' soun' of de parish bell--  [Illustration: \"Far, far away from hees own vill-age                  An' soun' of de parish bell.\"]    \"I never can play on de Hudson Bay     Or mountain dat lie between   But I meet heem singin' hees lonely way     De happies' man I know--   I cool hees face as he 's sleepin' dere   Under de star of de Red Rivière,   An' off on de home of de great w'ite bear,     I 'm seein' hees dog traineau.[3]    \"De woman an' chil'ren 's runnin' out     On de wigwam of de Cree--   De leetle papoose dey laugh an' shout     W'en de soun' of hees voice dey hear--   De oldes' warrior of de Sioux   Kill hese'f dancin' de w'ole night t'roo,   An de Blackfoot girl remember too     De ole tam Voyageur.    \"De blaze of hees camp on de snow I see,     An' I lissen hees 'En Roulant'   On de lan' w'ere de reindeer travel free,     Ringin' out strong an' clear--   Offen de grey wolf sit before   De light is come from hees open door,   An' caribou foller along de shore     De song of de Voyageur.    \"If he only kip goin', de red ceinture,[4]     I 'd see it upon de Pole   Some mornin' I 'm startin' upon de tour     For blowin' de worl' aroun'--   But w'erever he sail an' w'erever he ride,   De trail is long an' de trail is wide,   An' city an' town on ev'ry side     Can tell of hees campin' groun'.\"    So dat 's 'de reason I drink to-night     To de man of de Grand Nor' Wes',   For hees heart was young, an' hees heart was light     So long as he 's leevin' dere--   I 'm proud of de sam' blood in my vein   I 'm a son of de Nort' Win' wance again--   So we 'll fill her up till de bottle 's drain     An' drink to de Voyageur.

[Illustration: Flower]     [Illustration: Moose]  BRUNO THE HUNTER    You never hear tell, Marie, ma femme,     Of Bruno de hunter man,   Wit' hees wild dogs chasin' de moose an' deer,   Every day on de long, long year,   Off on de hillside far an' near,     An' down on de beeg savane?    Not'ing can leev' on de woods, Marie,     W'en Bruno is on de track,   An' young caribou, an' leetle red doe   Wit' baby to come on de spring, dey know   De pity dey get w'en hees bugle blow     An' de black dogs answer back.    No bird on de branch can finish hees song,     De squirrel no longer play--   De leaf on de maple don't need to wait   Till fros' of October is at de gate   'Fore de blood drops come: an' de fox sleeps late     W'en Bruno is pass dat way.    So de devil ketch heem of course at las'     Dat 's w'at de ole folk say,   An' spik to heem, \"Bruno, w'at for you kill   De moose an' caribou of de hill   An' fill de woods wit' deir blood until     You could run a mill night an' day?\"  [Illustration: \"So de devil ketch heem of course at las'.\"]    \"Mebbe you lak to be moose youse'f,     An' see how de hunter go,   So I 'll change your dogs into loup garou,[1]   An' wance on de year dey 'll be chasin' you--   An' res' of de tam w'en de sport is troo,     You 'll pass wit' me down below.\"    An' dis is de night of de year, Marie,     Bruno de hunter wake:   Soon as de great beeg tonder cloud   Up on de mountain 's roarin' loud--   He 'll come from hees grave w'ere de pine tree crowd     De shore of de leetle lake.    You see de lightning zig, zig, Marie,     Spittin' lak' loup cervier,[2]   Ketch on de trap?  Oh! it won't be long   Till mebbe you lissen anoder song,   For de sky is dark an' de win' is strong,     An' de chase is n't far away.    W'y shiver so moche, Marie, ma femme,     For de log is burnin' bright?   Ah! dere she's goin', \"Hulloo!  Hulloo!\"   An' oh! how de tonder is roarin' too!   But it can't drown de cry of de loup garou     On Bruno de hunter's night.    Over de mountain an' t'roo de swamp,     Don't matter how far or near,   Every place hees moccasin know   Bruno de hunter he 's got to go   'Fore de grave on de leetle lake below     Close up for anoder year.    But dey say de ole feller watch all night,     So you need n't be scare, Marie,   For he 'll never stir from de rocky cave   W'ere door only open beneat' de wave,   Till Bruno come back to hees lonely grave--     An' de devil he turn de key.    Dat 's way for punish de hunter man     W'en murder is on hees min'--   So he better stop w'ile de work is new,   Or mebbe de devil will ketch heem too,   An' chase heem aroun' wit' de loup garou     Gallopin' close behin'.
