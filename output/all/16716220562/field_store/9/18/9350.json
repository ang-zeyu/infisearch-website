They were not very willing to tell me, but at length confessed, to my astonishment, that it was M. Grabot.  \"Grabot--Grabot!\"  I said, striving to recollect where I had heard the name.  \"The Mayor of Bottitort?\"  The solemn man made an atrocious grimace.  Then, \"Yes, monsieur, the Mayor of Bottitort,\" he said frankly.  \"A year ago he put Philibert in the stocks for a riddle; that is his affair.  And the woman of this house has more than once befriended me, and he is for turning her out for a debt she does not owe; and that is my affair.  However, your lordship's arrival has saved him for this time.\"  \"You expected him here this evening, then?\"  \"He is coming,\" he answered, with more than his usual gloom.  \"He passed this way this morning, and announced that on his return he should spend the night here.  We found the goodwife all of a tremble when we arrived.  He is a hard man, monsieur,\" the mountebank continued bitterly.  \"She cried after him that she hoped that God would change his heart, but he only answered that even if St. Brieuc changed his body--you know the legend, monseigneur, doubtless--he should be here.\"  \"And here he is,\" the other, who had been looking out of one of the windows, cried.  \"I see his lanthorn coming down the hill. And by St. Brieuc, I have it!  I have it,\" the droll continued, suddenly spinning round in a wild dance of triumph on the floor, and then as suddenly stopping and falling into an attitude before us.  \"Monsieur, if you will help us, I have the richest jest ever played.  Pierre, listen. You, gentlemen all, listen!  We will pretend that he is changed.  He is a pompous man; he thinks the Mayor of Bottitort equal to the Saint Pere.  Well, Pierre shall be M. Grabot, Mayor of Bottitort.  You, monsieur, that we may give him enough of mayors, shall be the Mayor of Gol, and I will be the Mayor of St. Just.  This gentleman shall swear to us, so shall the servants.  For him, he does not exist.  Oh, we will punish him finely.\"  \"But,\" I said, astounded by the very audacity of the rogue's proposition, \"you do not flatter yourself that you will deceive him?\"  \"We shall, monsieur, if you will help,\" he answered confidently. \"I will be warrant for it we shall.\"  The thing had little of dignity in it, and I wonder now that I complied; but I have always shared with the King, my master, a taste for drolleries of the kind suggested; while nothing that I had as yet heard of this Grabot was of a nature to induce me to spare him.  Seeing that La Font was tickled with the idea, and that the servants were a-grin, and the more eager to trick others as they had just been tricked themselves, I was tempted to consent.  After this, the preparations took not a minute.  Philibert covered his fool's clothes with a cloak, and their table was drawn nearer to the fire, so as, with mine, to take up the whole hearth.  La Trape fell into an attitude behind me; and the Breton, adopting a refinement suggested at the last moment, was sent out to intercept Grabot before he entered, and tell him that the inn was full, and that he had better pass on.  The knave did his business so well that Grabot, being just such a man as the stroller had described to us, the altercation on the threshold was of itself the most amusing thing in the world. \"Who?\"  we heard a loud, coarse voice exclaim.  \"Who d'ye say are here, man?\"  \"The Mayor of Bottitort.\"  \"MILLE DIABLES!\"  \"The Mayor of Bottitort and the Mayors of Gol and St. Just,\" the servant repeated as if he noticed nothing amiss.  \"That is a lie!\"  the new comer replied, with a snort of triumph, \"and an impudent one.  But you have got the wrong sow by the ear this time.\"  \"Why, man,\" a third voice, somewhat nasal and rustical, struck in, \"don't you know the Mayor of Bottitort?\"  \"I should,\" my Breton answered bluntly, and making, as we guessed, a stand before them.  \"For I am his servant, and he is this moment at his meat.\"  \"The Mayor of Bottitort?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"M. Grabot?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And you are his servant?\"  \"I have thought so for some time,\" the Breton answered contemptuously.  The Mayor fairly roared in his indignation.  \"You--his servant! The Mayor of Bottitort's?\"  he cried in a voice of thunder. \"I'll tell you what you are; you are a liar!--a liar, man, that is what you are!  Why, you fool, I am the Mayor of Bottitort myself. Now, do you see how you have wasted yourself?  Out of my way!  Jehan, follow me in.  I shall look into this.  There is some knavery here, but if Simon Grabot cannot get to the bottom of it the Mayor of Bottitort will.  Follow me, I say. My servant indeed?  Come, come!\"  And, still grumbling, he flung open the door, which the Breton had left ajar, and stalked in upon us, fuming and blowing out his cheeks for all the world like a bantam cock with its feathers erect.  He was a short, pursy man; with a short nose, a wide face, and small eyes.  But had he been Caesar and Alexander rolled into one, he could not have crossed the threshold with a more tremendous assumption of dignity.  Once inside, he stood and glared at us, somewhat taken aback, I think, for the moment by our numbers; but recovering himself almost immediately, he strutted towards us, and, without uncovering or saluting us, he asked in a deep voice who was responsible for the man outside.  \"I am,\" the graver mountebank answered, looking at the stranger with a sober air of surprise.  \"He is my servant.\"  \"Ah!\"  the Mayor exclaimed, with a withering glance.  \"And who, may I ask, are you?\"  \"You may ask, certainly,\" the player answered drily.  \"But until you take off your hat I shall not answer.\"  The Mayor gasped at this rebuff, and turned, if it were possible, a shade redder; but he uncovered.  \"Now I do not mind telling you,\" Pierre continued, with a mild dignity admirably assumed, \"that I am Simon Grabot, and have the honour to be Mayor of Bottitort.\"  \"You!\"  \"Yes, monsieur, I; though perhaps unworthy.\"  I looked to see an explosion, but the Mayor was too far gone. \"Why, you swindling impostor,\" he said, with something that was almost admiration in his tone.  \"You are the very prince of cheats!  The king of cozeners!  But for all that, let me tell you, you have chosen the wrong ROLE this time.  For I--I, sir, am the Mayor of Bottitort, the very man whose name you have taken!\"  Pierre stared at him in composed silence, which his comrade was the first to break.  \"Is he mad?\"  he said in a low voice.  The grave man shook his head.  The Mayor heard and saw; and getting no other answer, began to tremble between passion and a natural, though ill-defined, misgiving, which the silent gaze of so large a party--for we all looked at him compassionately--was well calculated to produce. \"Mad?\"  he cried. \"No, but some one is, Sir,\" he continued, turning to La Font with a gesture in which appeal and impatience were curiously blended, \"Do you know this man?\"  \"M. Grabot?  Certainly,\" he answered, without blushing.  \"And have these ten years.\"  \"And you say that he is M. Grabot?\"  the poor Mayor retorted, his jaw falling ludicrously.  \"Certainly.  Who should he be?\"  The Mayor looked round him, sudden beads of sweat on his brow. \"MON DIEU!\" he cried.  \"You are all in it.  Here, you, do you know this person?\"  La Trape, to whom he addressed himself, shrugged his shoulders. \"I should,\" he said.  \"The Mayor is pretty well known about here.\"  \"The Mayor?\"  \"Ay.\"  \"But I am the Mayor--I,\" Grabot answered eagerly, tapping himself on the breast in the most absurd manner.  \"Don't you know me, my friend?\"  \"I never saw you before, to my knowledge,\" the rascal answered contemptuously; \"and I know this country pretty well.  I should think that you have been crossing St. Brieuc's brook, and forgotten to say your--\"  \"Hush!\"  the stout player interposed with some sharpness.  \"Let him alone.  LE BON DIEU knows that such a thing may happen to the best of us.\"  The Mayor clapped his hand to his head.  \"Sir,\" he said almost humbly, addressing the last speaker, \"I seem to know your voice. Your name, if you please?\"  \"Fracasse,\" he answered pleasantly.  \"I am Mayor of Gol.\"  \"You--Fracasse, Mayor of Gol?\"  Grabot exclaimed between rage and terror.  \"But Fracasse is a tall man.  I know him as well as I know my brother.\"  The pseudo-Fracasse smiled, but did not contradict him.  The Mayor wiped the moisture from his brow.  He had all the characteristics of an obstinate man; but if there is one thing which I have found in a long career more true than another, it is that no one can resist the statements of his fellows.  So much, I verily believe, is this the case, that if ten men maintain black to be white, the eleventh will presently be brought into their opinion.  Besides, the Mayor had a currish side.  He looked piteously from one to another of us, his cheeks seemed to grow in a moment pale and flabby, and he was on the point of whimpering, when at the last moment he bethought him of his servant, and turned to him in a spurt of sudden thankfulness. \"Why, Jehan, man, I had forgotten you,\" he said.  \"Are these men mad, or am I?\"  But Jehan, a simple rustic, was in a state of ludicrous bewilderment. \"Dol, master, I don't know,\" he stuttered, rubbing his head.  \"But I am myself,\" the Mayor cried, in a most ridiculous tone of remonstrance.  \"Dol, and I don't know,\" the man whimpered.  \"I do believe that there is a change in you.  I never saw you look the like before. And I never said any PATER either.  Holy saints!\"  the poor fool continued piteously, \"I wish I were at home.  And there, for all I know, my wife has got another man.\"  He began to blubber at this; which to us was the most ludicrous thought, so that it was all we could do to restrain our laughter. But the Mayor saw things in another light.  Shaken by our steady persistence in our story, and astounded by our want of respect, the defection of his follower utterly cowed him.

NEW YORK  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS  1908     Copyright, 1898,  BY CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS   _All rights reserved._     TO THE  Society of the Sons of the Revolution,     _And those kindred organizations whose chief function is to   cultivate a spirit of patriotism and love of country   in the present by recalling the struggles and   sacrifices of the past._     PREFACE  Since the action of this story falls during the periods, and the book deals with personages and incidents, which are usually treated of in the more serious pages of history, it is proper that some brief word of explanation should be written by which I might confirm some of the romantic happenings hereafter related, which to the casual reader may appear to draw too heavily upon his credulity for acceptance.  The action between the Randolph and the Yarmouth really happened, the smaller ship did engage the greater for the indicated purpose, much as I have told it; and if I have ventured to substitute another name for that of the gallant sailor and daring hero, Captain Nicholas Biddle, who commanded the little Randolph, and lost his life, on that occasion, I trust this paragraph may be considered as making ample amends.  The remarkable fight between those two ships is worthy of more extended notice than has hitherto been given it, in any but the larger tones (and not even in some of those) of the time.  As far as my information permits me to say, there never was a more heroic battle on the seas.  Again, it is evident to students of history that the character of Washington has not been properly understood hitherto, by the very people who revere his name, though the excellent books of Messrs. Ford, Wilson, Lodge, Fiske, and others are doing much to destroy the popular canonization which made of the man a saint; in defence of my characterization of him I am able to say that the incidents and anecdotes and most of the conversations in which he appears are absolutely historical.  If I have dwelt too long and too circumstantially upon the Trenton and Princeton campaigns for a book so light in character as is this one, it may be set down to an ardent admiration for Washington as man and soldier, and a design again to exhibit him as he was at one of the most critical and brilliant points of his career.  Furthermore, I find that the school and other histories commonly accessible to ordinary people are not sufficiently awake to the importance and brilliancy of the campaign, and I cherish the hope that this book may serve, in some measure, to establish its value.  I have freely used all the histories and narratives to which I had access, without hesitation; and if I have anticipated a distinguished arrival, or hastened the departure of a ship, or altered the date of a naval battle, or changed its scene, I plead the example of the distinguished masters of fiction, to warrant me.  In closing I cannot refrain from thanking those who have so kindly assisted me with advice and correction during the writing of this story and the reading of the proof, especially the Rev. A. J. P.

It was not the scenery of Virginia either, the landscape on the Potomac, of which he would have spoken so enthusiastically, though even that were a thing not to be disdained by such a lover of the beautiful as Seymour had shown himself to be,--the dry brown hills rising in swelling slopes from the edge of the wide quiet river; the bare and leafless trees upon their crests, now scarce veiling the comfortable old white house, which in the summer they quite concealed beneath their masses of foliage; and all the world lying dreamy and calm and still, in the motionless haze of one of those rare seasons in November which so suggests departed days that men name it summer again.  For all that he then saw in nature was but a setting for a woman; even the sun itself, low in the west, robbed of its glory, and faded into a dull red ball seeking to hide its head, but served to throw into high relief the noble and beautiful face of the girl upon whom he gazed,--the girl who was sun and life and light and world for him.  The most confirmed misogynist would have found it difficult to challenge her claim to beauty; and yet it would require a more severe critic or a sterner analyst than a lover would be likely to prove, to say in just what point could be found that which would justify the claim.  Was it in the mass of light wavy brown hair, springing from a low point on her forehead and gently rippling back, which she wore plaited and tied with a ribbon and destitute of powder?  How sweetly simple it looked to him after the bepowdered and betowered misses of the town with whom he was most acquainted!  Was it in the broad low brow, or the brown, almost black eyes which laughed beneath it; or the very fair complexion, which seemed to him a strangely delightful and unusual combination?  Or was it in the perfection of a faultless, if somewhat slender and still undeveloped figure, half concealed by the vivid \"Cardinal\" cloak she wore, which one little hand held loosely together about her, while the other dabbled in the water by her side?  Be this as it may, the whole impression she produced was one which charmed and fascinated to the last degree, and Mistress Katharine Wilton's sway among the young men of the colony was-well-nigh undisputed.  A toast and a belle in half Virginia, Seymour was not the first, nor was he destined to be the last, of her adorers.  The strong, steady, practised stroke, denoting the accomplished oarsman, with which he had urged the little boat through the water, had given way to an idle and purposeless drift.  He longed to cast himself down before the little feet, in their smart high-heeled buckled shoes and clocked stockings, which peeped out at him from under her embroidered camlet petticoat in such a maliciously coquettish manner; he longed to kneel down there in the skiff, at the imminent risk of spoiling his own gay attire, and declare the passion which consumed him; but something--he did not know what it was, and she did not tell him--constrained him, and he sat still, and felt himself as far away as if she had been in the stars.  In his way he was quite as good to look at as the young maiden; tall, blond, stalwart, blue-eyed, pleasant-featured, with the frank engaging air which seems to belong to those who go down to the sea in ships, Lieutenant John Seymour Seymour was an excellent specimen of that hardy, daring, gallant class of men who in this war and in the next were to shed such imperishable lustre upon American arms by their exploits in the naval service.  Born of an old and distinguished Philadelphia family, so proud of its name that in his instance they had doubled it, the usual bluntness and roughness of the sea were tempered by this gentle birth and breeding, and by frequent attrition with men and women of the politest society of the largest and most important city of the colonies.  Offering his services as soon as the news of Lexington precipitated the conflict with the mother country, he had already made his name known among that gallant band of seamen among whom Jones, Biddle, Dale, and Conyngham were pre-eminent.  The delicious silence which he had been unwilling to break, since it permitted him to gaze undisturbed upon his fair shipmate, was terminated at last by that lady herself.  She looked up from the water with which she had been playing, and then appearing to notice for the first time his steady ardent gaze, she laughed lightly and said,--  \"Well, sir, it grows late.  When you have finished contemplating the scenery, perhaps you will turn the boat, and take me home; then you can feast your eyes upon something more attractive.\"  \"And what is that, pray?\" he asked.  \"Your supper, sir.  You must be very anxious for "]]]
