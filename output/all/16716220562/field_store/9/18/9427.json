Perhaps its leaders think that's the most strategic spot.  \"Then it sent out spaceships, three of them. One is hovering close to Venus. Another is near Mars, and the third is some 200,000 miles off Earth. Several of our interplanetary freighters are overdue; it seems now that they must have encountered these invading ships and been destroyed.  \"Still more, and worse: these three hovering ships have already landed the enemy on Mars and Venus. The helio-reports mention mysterious encounters in Ferrok-Shahn and Grebhar. For three or four days, Mars has been in a panic of apprehension; Venus almost as bad. And some have landed here. Not many, perhaps; but one has been captured. A thing--God, it's almost beyond description.\"  We could well agree with that, since Snap and I had just seen one.  \"They've got it here,\" Grantline was saying. \"They've tried to make it talk. They can't but they're going to try again.\"  He jumped to his feet and went to the door. \"They're bringing it in.\" Upon his face was a look of awed horror.  We stood crowding the small door-oval. It gave onto a darkened balcony of the conclave hall. The girders of the city roof were over us. There were a few official spectators sitting up here in the dark on the balcony, but none noticed us.  The lower floor of the hall was lighted. Around the polished oblong tables perhaps a hundred scientists and high governmental officials of the three worlds were seated. Near the center of the hall was a small dais-platform. On a table there, someone had just placed a circular black box, similar to the one we had seen previously.  The hall was hushed and tense. On the dais stood a group of Earth officials. One of them spoke. \"Here it is, gentlemen. And this time, by God, we'll make it speak.\"  Grantline whispered, \"That's the War Secretary from Greater London.\"  I recognized him: Brayley, Commander in Chief of the land, air, water and space armies of the United States of the World. He was gigantic in stature, with a great shock of gray-white hair. A commanding figure, if there ever was one.  Beside him, Nippor, the Japanese representative in Greater New York, seemed a pigmy. The acoustics of the silent hall carried his soft voice up to us. \"I would be afraid of drugs. Will we use force? It is vital.\"  \"Yes, by God! Anything.\"  It seemed that everyone in the hall must be shuddering: I could feel it like an aura pounding up at me. Brayley lifted the box-lid, reached in and raised the horrible thing. He held it up, a two-foot ball of palpitating gray-white membrane. Another living brain.  \"Now, damn you, you're going to talk to us! Understand that? We're going to make you talk. Get that box out of the way.\"  They flung the box to the floor, and Brayley placed the brain on the table.  A glare of light, focussed on it, showed beneath the stretched taut membrane the convolutions of the brain, like tangled purple worms. The blood-vessels seemed distended almost to bursting now. The gruesome face, with popping eyes and that gaping mouth, showed a horrible travesty of terror. From where its ears should have been, a crooked little arm of flabby, gray-white flesh came down, one on each side and braced the table. And I saw now that it had a shriveled body, or at least little legs, bent, almost crushed under by its weight.  \"Now, damn you,\" Brayley said, rubbing off his hands on a rough towel, \"for the last time: will you talk?\"  The goggling eyes held a terrified but baleful gaze upon Brayley's face. Did it understand? The eyes were fronted our way, and suddenly their glance swung up so that I seemed for an instant to see down into them. And it struck me then: this was a thing of greater intelligence than my own. A humanoid, with brain so developed that through myriad generations the body was shriveled, almost gone. A mind was housed here, an intelligence housed in this monstrous brain.  Were these the beings of the new planet which had come to attack us? But how could this helpless creature, incapable of almost everything, obviously, save thought, do the work of its world?  Then I recalled again that insulated room of the Red Spark Cafe: the thin, ten-foot hooded shape which was carrying the box. Was that, perhaps, an opposite type of being with the brain submerged, dwarfed, and the body paramount? Were there, on this mysterious planet, two co-existing types, each a specialist, one for the physical work and the other for the mental?  I stood with Snap and Grantline in that dark balcony doorway, gazing down to where the giant brain stood braced upon its shriveled arms and legs, and realized why we of Earth and Venus and Mars are all cast in the same mould we call human. It is a little family of planets, here in our solar system; for countless eons we have been close neighbors. The same sunlight, the same general conditions of life, the same seed, were strewn here by a wise Creator. A man from the Orient is different from an Anglo-Saxon; a man of Mars differs a little more. But basically they are the same.  Yet, confronting us now was a new type, from realms of interstellar space, far beyond our solar system.  \"For the last time, will you talk?\" snapped Brayley.  There was another interval of silence. The eyes of the brain were very watchful. Its gaze roved the hall as though it were seeking for help. It shifted its little arms on the table, seemingly exhausted from the physical effort of supporting itself.  Brayley's voice came again. \"Doubtless you can feel pain acutely. We shall see.\"  With what effort of will to overcome his revulsion we may only guess, he reached forward and pinched the little arm. The result was electrifying. From the upended slit of mouth in that goggling face, came a scream. It pierced the heavy tense silence of the hall, ghastly in its timbre, like nothing any of us had ever heard before. And in it was conveyed agony as though Brayley had not merely pinched that flabby arm, but had thrust a red-hot knife into its vitals.  The brain could feel pain indeed. It crouched with stiffened arms and legs. The membrane of its great head seemed to bulge with greater distension; the knotted blood-vessels were gorged with purple blood. The eyes rolled. Then it closed its mouth. Its gaze steadied upon Brayley's face, so baleful a gaze that as I could see the reflection of its luminous purple glow a shudder of fear and revulsion swept me.  \"So you did not like that?\" Brayley steadied his voice. \"If you don't want more, you had better speak. How did you get here on Earth? What are you trying to do here?\"  There seemed an interminable silence; then Nippor took a menacing step forward. \"Speak! We will force it from you!\"  And then it spoke. \"Do--not--touch--me--again.\"  Indescribable voice! Human, animal or monster no one could say. But the words were clear, precise; and for all their terror, they seemed to hold an infinite command.  A wave of excitement swept the hall, but Brayley's gesture silenced it. He leaped forward and bent low over the palpitating brain.  \"So you can talk. You came as an enemy. We have given you every chance today for friendship, and you have refused. What are you trying to do to us?\"  It only glared.  \"Speak!\"  \"I will not tell you anything.\"  \"Oh, yes, you will.\"  \"No!\"  All the men on the platform were crowding close to it now.  \"Speak!\" ordered Brayley again. \"Here in Greater New York is a hiding place. Where is it?\"  No answer.  \"Where is it? You are perhaps a leader of your world. I lead ours, and I'm going to master you now. Where is this hiding place?\"  The thing suddenly laughed, a gruesome, eerie cackle. \"You will know when it is too late. I think it is too late already.\"  \"Too late for what?\"  \"To save your world. Doomed, your three worlds! Don't touch--me!\"  It ended with a scream of apprehension as Nippor grasped the crooked little arm. \"Tell us!\"  \"No!\" It screamed again. \"Let--me--go!\"  \"Tell us!\" Nippor strengthened his squeezing grip. The thing was writhing, the thin ball of membrane palpitating, heaving. And suddenly it burst. Over all its purpled surface, blood came with a gush.  Nippor and Brayley staggered backward. The scream of the brain ended in a choking gurgle. The little legs and tiny body wilted under it; the round ball of membrane sank to the table. It rolled sidewise upon one arm and ear, and in a moment its palpitation ceased. A purple-red mass of blood, it lay deflated and flabby.  It was dead.     4   \"But see here,\" I said, \"did they mention the Martian, Molo, at all?\"  \"They were discussing Molo before you arrived,\" Grantline told us.  We had drawn back from the doorway. The conference, with the dead thing removed, was proceeding. Snap and I had momentarily forgotten Anita and Venza; but now we were in a panic to get back to the Red Spark.  \"But you can't go,\" said Grantline. \"Brayley ordered you here. He'll want to see you in a moment.\"  \"Well, why doesn't he see us now?\" Snap protested. \"I'm not going to cool myself off sitting here.\"  \"Oh yes, you are.\"  Grantline sent word to Brayley that we were here. In a moment the answer came. We were to wait a short time; he would want to see us.  We swiftly told Grantline what had happened at the Red Spark, and found that already he knew. Francis had relayed it to the conference, and Halsey was in constant communication with the officials here.  \"Then what is happening?\" I demanded. \"Where are the girls? Has Halsey heard from them?\"  Again Grantline went to a nearby room.  \"Anita sent a message,\" he said, when he returned. \"They are with Molo. Halsey is ordering a squad of men to be ready.\"  Grantline told us what had been happening in the Red Spark. Anita and Venza, simulating drunkenness with a skill for acting which I knew both of them possessed, had joined Molo's party. Perhaps if Meka had been there she would have seen through them.  But Molo did not. And they have since told me that the Martian himself was far from sober,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20859"],["title","Wandl the Invader (#5)"],["body","he was probably not aware of it. He yielded to their demands to leave the restaurant with him. He wanted, as we know, to leave unobtrusively; and Venza threatened a scene unless she could go.  He took them, leaving openly in a public fare-car. Doubtless he at first intended to de-rail them somewhere, but they convinced him that he was not being followed. Twice he used his detector, and Anita and Halsey were clever enough to throw off their rays in time to avoid it. Then Halsey lost connection with the fleeing car, and after that Molo changed his mind about ditching the girls.  \"But where are they now?\" I demanded.  \"You,\" said Grantline sternly, \"are out of it. Do you think that Halsey, under Brayley's orders, will neglect any chance to find out where Molo is hiding? Something is about to happen. This conference is wrestling with it. In Grebhar and Ferrok-Shahn they're striving to find out what it is. Something impending _now_. Helios are pouring in here from Venus and Mars. They're mobilizing their spaceships, just as we are.\"  Grantline at last was letting out all his apprehensions on us, with this burst. \"Halsey didn't tell you that the entire resources of his organization are out upon this thing tonight. Here at this conclave there's a room of information-sorters. That's just where I came from a moment ago. Every country on our Earth is making ready--for what, nobody knows!  \"He's had two fragmentary calls from Anita. He has a hundred men ready to rush to their aid, and to capture Molo's lair. He expects another message from Anita any moment. This conference here knows every movement that is being made, within ten or twenty seconds of its making. Perhaps upon Anita and Venza the whole outcome of this thing may hang.\"  We had no answer to that. \"Do you know who Molo is? He's an interplanetary pirate; his ship is the _Star-Streak_.\"  \"Good Lord!\"  We had heard of him. For five years past, a gray spaceship, with a base supposedly hidden in the Polar deserts of Mars, had been terrorizing interplanetary shipping.  \"They think,\" Grantline went on, \"that Molo was cruising with his pirate ship. He has, as you know, a band of criminals drawn from all the three worlds. There are about fifty of them, commanded by his sister and himself. We think that Molo encountered the three ships which that new planet sent out. The _Star-Streak_ was captured, perhaps destroyed. Molo and his band, joined with this new enemy, to save themselves, and because they have been promised rewards.\"  \"But why should these brains want their help?\" Snap demanded.  \"Wouldn't you say it was because, in Ferrok-Shahn, Grebhar and here in Greater New York, simultaneously tonight, something has to be accomplished, something the brains themselves could not do? Molo and his band know all three cities. How they landed here in Greater New York nobody knows; the enemy spaceship is 200,000 miles out. Obviously they came from it, landed secretly with some smaller ship somewhere on Earth and made their way here.\"  A buzzer sounded beside us. A voice commanded: \"Grantline, bring Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean to room six at once.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In room six we stood before the War Secretary, who had arrived there a moment ahead of us.  \"Ah, Haljan and Dean. I'm glad to see you.\"  He was still white and shaken. Beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead. He mopped them off.  \"I've just had a rather terrible experience.\" He did not suggest that we sit down. He went on crisply: \"Grantline no doubt has told you of what's going on. Disturbing, terrifying. Haljan, we have a ship being rushed into commission tonight. You know her, the _Cometara_.\"  \"I know her,\" I said.  \"Quite so. She is taking off as soon as we can ready her. She will carry about fifty men. Grantline is in charge of the armament and men. You, Dean, we want to handle her radio-helio.\"  \"Right,\" said Snap.  \"And you, Haljan, we can think of no one better to navigate her.\"  He waved away my appreciation. \"Within a brief time we shall have thirty such ships in space. Mars and Venus also are mobilizing.\"  He stood up. \"We feel, Haljan, that if anyone can handle the _Cometara_ with skill enough to combat this lurking enemy, it will be you.\"  \"I'll do my best, sir.\"  \"We know that. The ship is leaving from the Tappan Interplanetary Stage shortly after dawn. When have you and Dean last slept?\"  \"Last night,\" we both said.  \"Quite so. Then you need sleep now. I want you to go at once to the Tappan Fieldhouse. The commander there will make you comfortable. Eat, and sleep if you can. We want you in good shape. You're to keep out of this night's activities here in the city; you understand?\"  \"Yes sir.\"  An orderly was approaching behind Brayley. \"I'll be back in a moment, Rollins.\"  He shook hands with us. \"I may not see you again before it's over. Good luck, lads. Grantline, they need you for a moment in the hall; something about electronic space weapons, further equipment for the _Cometara_. Then you'd better go to Tappan House too, and get some sleep.\"  We were dismissed. Snap and I regarded each other hesitantly. I said impulsively, \"Mr. Brayley, Detective-Colonel Halsey is using two girls.\"  \"Yes, we're watching that, Haljan.\"  \"They're the girls we're to marry,\" I added. \"May we communicate with Colonel Halsey?\"  \"Yes. Call him from here.\" He smiled wanly. \"But keep out of it; we need you at dawn.\"  The Tappan departure-stage was only a few miles up the Hudson; we could get there in half an hour. It was now nearly trinight, halfway between midnight and dawn. I had my portable audiphone and got Halsey at once.  \"You Gregg?\"  \"Yes. They're through with us at the Conclave. Where is Anita?\"  \"We heard from her twice. I'm expecting....\"  We could hear someone interrupting him. Then he came back. \"Gregg? Molo took them somewhere. I didn't dare fling after them. He had his detector going, and Anita warned me not to try it. She had to stop connection herself. God knows how she was able to whisper to me at all.\"  His voice, like Brayley's, had the ring of a man strained to the breaking point. I could appreciate how Halsey must feel, forced to remain at his desk with its encircling banks of instruments; holding all the network of his farflung activities centralized; his decisions, his commands in a hundred places almost simultaneously, while his body sat there inactive.  \"Gregg, the girls must have arrived at Molo's place by now. If only they know where they are! I have lookouts throughout the city with intricate and complete connecting equipment. Gregg, I must disconnect.\"  \"Colonel, give me Anita's frequency. Maybe Snap or I can pick up the message.\"  He named the oscillating frequency, then disconnected.  \"Try that frequency,\" Snap suggested. \"We've got to do something.\"  The door-slide opened suddenly and an orderly appeared. \"Haljan?\"  \"Get the hell away,\" roared Snap. \"We've had our orders; we don't want any from you.\"  \"Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean are paged on the mirrors.\"  Someone in the city wanted us; our names were appearing on the various mirror-grids publicly displayed throughout the city in the hope that we would answer.  \"That's different,\" said Snap. \"Answer it for us, that's a good fellow. We're busy.\"  \"It must be important,\" the orderly insisted. \"The caller registered a fee at the Search Bureau; that's how they located you here. He paid the highest fee to search you. An emergency call.\"  It was against the law to invoke the services of the Search Bureau unless based upon actual impending danger. \"We'll take it,\" I said.  \"Come with me.\" He turned to the left and down the corridor.  We hastened with him to a corridor cubby. Upon the audiphone there I was at once connected with a voice, and an anxious man's face with a two-day growth upon it.  \"Haljan! Thank God you answered. This is Dud Ardley. Me and Shac are here. Listen, this is the lower cellar corridor, Lateral 3, under Broadway. Me and Shac just have seen your girls down here.\"  News of Anita and Venza! I could see in the mirror-image, behind Dud's head the outlines of the little public cubby from which he was calling. He and his brother, on some illicit errand of their own in East Side lower Manhattan, had seen figures alighting from a fare-car. They had caught a glimpse of the faces of Anita and Venza. The girls were hooded and cloaked; a hooded man was with them. The fare-car quickly rolled away, and the hooded figures, suddenly becoming invisible within their magnetic cloaks, had vanished.  \"S'elp me, we couldn't do nothin'. You know we take no chances with the police by carryin' cylinders. So I paged you in a hurry.\"  \"Dud, that's damn nice of you. Where are you now? Tell me again.\"  The Ardleys, knowing nothing of the events of this night, supposed that the girls were being abducted, and decided I should be informed.  \"Damn right, Dud. We'll come at once. You two wait for us?\"  \"Sure. If you got instruments, maybe we can track 'em. It wasn't a quarter of a mile from here, over toward the river. Plenty of rotten dumps down there.\"  \"Wait for us, Dud. We'll come in a rush.\"  I slammed shut the audiphone. Snap, beside me, had heard it all. He shoved the astonished orderly out of the way.  \"What's the nearest exit-route out of here?\"  \"To the city roof, sir. Up this incline.\"  We dashed up the spiral incline, through a low exit-port, and were in the starlight of the city roof.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Connect it, Gregg! You can't tell; her message might come over any minute.\"  I tuned my coils to the seldom used oscillation frequency which Halsey had told us Anita's transmitter was sending.  \"Anything, Gregg?\"  \"No. Dead channel.\"  The air, in Anita's channel, was bafflingly silent.  We had been challenged by a roof-guard when we appeared from the upper port of the Conclave Hall; the city roof was not open to public traffic. But with our identifications, he found us a single-seat"]]]
