The old man must have been walking along that path, and whoever did it must have sprung out on him there--where all those marks are--and when he'd strangled him dragged him here. That's how I figure it, Mr. Cotherstone.\"  Lights were coming up through the wood beneath them, glancing from point to point amongst the trees. Then followed a murmur of voices, and three or four men came into view--policemen, carrying their lamps, the man whom Garthwaite had sent into the town, and a medical man who acted as police surgeon.  \"Here!\" said Bent, as the newcomers advanced and halted irresolutely. \"This way, doctor--there's work for you here--of a sort, anyway. Of course, he's dead?\"  The doctor had gone forward as soon as he caught sight of the body, and he dropped on his knees at its side while the others gathered round. In the added light everybody now saw things more clearly. Kitely lay in a heap--just as a man would lie who had been unceremoniously thrown down. But Brereton's sharp eyes saw at once that after he had been flung at the foot of the mass of rock some hand had disarranged his clothing. His overcoat and under coat had been torn open, hastily, if not with absolute violence; the lining of one trousers pocket was pulled out; there were evidences that his waistcoat had been unbuttoned and its inside searched: everything seemed to indicate that the murderer had also been a robber.  \"He's not been dead very long,\" said the doctor, looking up. \"Certainly not more than three-quarters of an hour. Strangled? Yes!--and by somebody who has more than ordinary knowledge of how quickly a man may be killed in that way! Look how this cord is tied--no amateur did that.\"  He turned back the neckcloth from the dead man's throat, and showed the others how the cord had been slipped round the neck in a running-knot and fastened tightly with a cunning twist.  \"Whoever did this had done the same thing before--probably more than once,\" he continued. \"No man with that cord round his neck, tightly knotted like that, would have a chance--however free his hands might be. He'd be dead before he could struggle. Does no one know anything about this? No more than that?\" he went on, when he had heard what Garthwaite could tell. \"Well, this is murder, anyway! Are there no signs of anything about here?\"  \"Don't you think his clothing looks as if he had been robbed?\" said Brereton, pointing to the obvious signs. \"That should be noted before he's moved.\"  \"I've noted that, sir,\" said the police-sergeant, who had bent over the body while the doctor was examining it. \"There's one of his pockets turned inside out, and all his clothing's been torn open. Robbery, of course--that's what it's been--murder for the sake of robbery!\"  One of the policemen, having satisfied his curiosity stepped back and began to search the surroundings with the aid of his lamp. He suddenly uttered a sharp exclamation.  \"Here's something!\" he said, stooping to the foot of a pine-tree and picking up a dark object. \"An old pocket-book--nothing in it, though.\"  \"That was his,\" remarked Cotherstone. \"I've seen it before. He used to carry it in an inner pocket. Empty, do you say?--no papers?\"  \"Not a scrap of anything,\" answered the policeman, handing the book over to his sergeant, and proceeding to search further. \"We'd best to see if there's any footprints about.\"  \"You'd better examine that path, then,\" said Garthwaite. \"You'll find no prints on all this pine-needle stuff--naught to go by, anyway--it's too thick and soft. But he must have come along that path, one way or another--I've met him walking in here of an evening, more than once.\"  The doctor, who had exchanged a word or two with the sergeant, turned to Cotherstone.  \"Wasn't he a tenant of yours?\" he asked. \"Had the cottage at the top of the Shawl here. Well, we'd better have the body removed there, and some one should go up and warn his family.\"  \"There's no family,\" answered Cotherstone. \"He'd naught but a housekeeper--Miss Pett. She's an elderly woman--and not likely to be startled, from what I've seen of her.\"  \"I'll go,\" said Bent. \"I know the housekeeper.\" He touched Brereton's elbow, and led him away amongst the trees and up the wood. \"This is a strange affair!\" he continued when they were clear of the others. \"Did you hear what Dr. Rockcliffe said?--that whoever had done it was familiar with that sort of thing!\"  \"I saw for myself,\" replied Brereton. \"I noticed that cord, and the knot on it, at once. A man whose neck was tied up like that could be thrown down, thrown anywhere, left to stand up, if you like, and he'd be literally helpless, even if, as the doctor said, he had the use of his hands. He'd be unconscious almost at once--dead very soon afterwards. Murder?--I should think so!--and a particularly brutal and determined one. Bent!--whoever killed that poor old fellow was a man of great strength and of--knowledge! Knowledge, mind you!--he knew the trick. You haven't any doubtful character in Highmarket who has ever lived in India, have you?\"  \"India! Why India?\" asked Bent.  \"Because I should say that the man who did that job has learned some of the Indian tricks with cords and knots,\" answered Brereton. \"That murder's suggestive of Thuggeeism in some respects. That the cottage?\" he went on, pointing to a dim light ahead of him. \"This housekeeper, now?--is she the sort who'll take it quietly?\"  \"She's as queer a character as the old fellow himself was,\" replied Bent, as they cleared the wood and entered a hedge-enclosed garden at the end of which stood an old-fashioned cottage. \"I've talked to her now and then when calling here--I should say she's a woman of nerve.\"  Brereton looked narrowly at Miss Pett when she opened the door. She carried a tallow candle in one hand and held it high above her head to throw a light on the callers; its dim rays fell more on herself than on them. A tall, gaunt, elderly woman, almost fleshless of face, and with a skin the colour of old parchment, out of which shone a pair of bright black eyes; the oddity of her appearance was heightened by her head-dress--a glaring red and yellow handkerchief tightly folded in such a fashion as to cover any vestige of hair. Her arms, bare to the elbow, and her hands were as gaunt as her face, but Brereton was quick to recognize the suggestion of physical strength in the muscles and sinews under the parchment-like skin. A strange, odd-looking woman altogether, he thought, and not improved by the fact that she appeared to have lost all her teeth, and that a long, sharp nose and prominent chin almost met before her sunken lips.  \"Oh, it's you, is it, Mr. Bent?\" she said, before either of the young men could speak. \"Mr. Kitely's gone out for his regular bedtime constitution--he will have that, wet or fine, every night. But he's much longer than usual, and----\"  She stopped suddenly, seeing some news in Bent's face, and her own contracted to a questioning look.  \"Is there aught amiss?\" she asked. \"Has something happened him? Aught that's serious? You needn't be afraid to speak, Mr. Bent--there's naught can upset or frighten me, let me tell you--I'm past all that!\"  \"I'm afraid Mr. Kitely's past everything, too, then,\" said Bent. He looked steadily at her for a moment, and seeing that she understood, went on. \"They're bringing him up, Miss Pett--you'd better make ready. You won't be alarmed--I don't think there's any doubt that he's been murdered.\"  The woman gazed silently at her visitors; then, nodding her turbaned head, she drew back into the cottage.  \"It's what I expected,\" she muttered. \"I warned him--more than once. Well--let them bring him, then.\"  She vanished into a side-room, and Bent and Brereton went down the garden and met the others, carrying the dead man. Cotherstone followed behind the police, and as he approached Bent he pulled him by the sleeve and drew him aside.  \"There's a clue!\" he whispered. \"A clue, d'ye hear--a strong clue!\"     CHAPTER V  THE CORD   Ever since they had left the house at the foot of the pine wood, Brereton had been conscious of a curious psychological atmosphere, centring in Cotherstone. It had grown stronger as events had developed; it was still stronger now as they stood outside the dead man's cottage, the light from the open door and the white-curtained window falling on Cotherstone's excited face. Cotherstone, it seemed to Brereton, was unduly eager about something--he might almost be said to be elated. All of his behaviour was odd. He had certainly been shocked when Garthwaite burst in with the news--but this shock did not seem to be of the ordinary sort. He had looked like fainting--but when he recovered himself his whole attitude (so, at any rate, it had seemed to Brereton) had been that of a man who has just undergone a great relief. To put the whole thing into a narrow compass, it seemed as if Cotherstone appeared to be positively pleased to hear--and to find beyond doubt--that Kitely was dead. And now, as he stood glancing from one young man to the other, his eyes glittered as if he were absolutely enjoying the affair: he reminded Brereton of that type of theatre-goer who will insist on pointing out stage effects as they occur before his eyes, forcing his own appreciation of them upon fellow-watchers whose eyes are as keen as his own.  \"A strong clue!\" repeated Cotherstone, and said it yet again. \"A good 'un! And if it's right, it'll clear matters up.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Bent. He, too, seemed to be conscious that there was something odd about his prospective father-in-law, and he was gazing speculatively at him as if in wonder. \"What sort of a clue?\"  \"It's a wonder it didn't strike me--and you, too--at first,\" said Cotherstone, with a queer sound that was half a chuckle. \"But as long as it's struck somebody, eh? One's as good as another. You can't think of what it is, now?\"  \"I don't know what you're thinking about,\" replied Bent, half impatiently.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20630"],["title","The Borough Treasurer (#6)"],["body","gave vent to an unmistakable chuckle at that, and he motioned them to follow him into the cottage.  \"Come and see for yourselves, then,\" he said. \"You'll spot it. But, anyway--Mr. Brereton, being a stranger, can't be expected to.\"  The three men walked into the living-room of the cottage--a good-sized, open-raftered, old-fashioned place, wherein burnt a bright fire, at either side of which stood two comfortable armchairs. Before one of these chairs, their toes pointing upwards against the fender, were a pair of slippers; on a table close by stood an old lead tobacco-box, flanked by a church-warden pipe, a spirit decanter, a glass, and a plate on which were set out sugar and lemon--these Brereton took to be indicative that Kitely, his evening constitutional over, was in the habit of taking a quiet pipe and a glass of something warm before going to bed. And looking round still further he became aware of an open door--the door into which Miss Pett had withdrawn--and of a bed within on which Kitely now lay, with Dr. Rockcliffe and the police-sergeant bending over him. The other policemen stood by the table in the living-room, and one of them--the man who had picked up the pocket-book--whispered audibly to Cotherstone as he and his companions entered.  \"The doctor's taking it off him,\" he said, with a meaning nod of his head. \"I'll lay aught it's as I say, Mr. Cotherstone.\"  \"Looks like it,\" agreed Cotherstone, rubbing his hands. \"It certainly looks like it, George. Sharp of you to notice it, though.\"  Brereton took this conversation to refer to the mysterious clue, and his suspicion was confirmed a moment later. The doctor and the sergeant came into the living-room, the doctor carrying something in his hand which he laid down on the centre table in full view of all of them. And Brereton saw then that he had removed from the dead man's neck the length of grey cord with which he had been strangled.  There was something exceedingly sinister in the mere placing of that cord before the eyes of these living men. It had wrought the death of another man, who, an hour before, had been as full of vigorous life as themselves; some man, equally vigorous, had used it as the instrument of a foul murder. Insignificant in itself, a mere piece of strongly spun and twisted hemp, it was yet singularly suggestive--one man, at any rate, amongst those who stood looking at it, was reminded by it that the murderer who had used it must even now have the fear of another and a stronger cord before him.  \"Find who that cord belongs to, and you may get at something,\" suddenly observed the doctor, glancing at the policemen. \"You say it's a butcher's cord?\"  The man who had just whispered to Cotherstone nodded.  \"It's a pig-killer's cord, sir,\" he answered. \"It's what a pig-killer fastens the pig down with--on the cratch.\"  \"A cratch?--what's that?\" asked Brereton, who had gone close to the table to examine the cord, and had seen that, though slender, it was exceedingly strong, and of closely wrought fibre. \"Is it a sort of hurdle?\"  \"That's it, sir,\" assented the policeman. \"It is a sort of hurdle--on four legs. They lay the pig on it, don't you see, and tie it down with a cord of this sort--this cord's been used for that--it's greasy with long use.\"  \"And it has been cut off a longer piece, of course,\" said the doctor. \"These cords are of considerable length, aren't they?\"  \"Good length, sir--there's a regular coil, like,\" said the man. He, too, bent down and looked at the length before him. \"This has been cut off what you might call recent,\" he went on, pointing to one end.  \"And cut off with a sharp knife, too.\"  The police sergeant glanced at the doctor as if asking advice on the subject of putting his thoughts into words.  \"Well?\" said the doctor, with a nod of assent. \"Of course, you've got something in your mind, sergeant?\"  \"Well, there is a man who kills pigs, and has such cords as that, lives close by, doctor,\" he answered. \"You know who I mean--the man they call Gentleman Jack.\"  \"You mean Harborough,\" said the doctor. \"Well--you'd better ask him if he knows anything. Somebody might have stolen one of his cords. But there are other pig-killers in the town, of course.\"  \"Not on this side the town, there aren't,\" remarked another policeman.  \"What is plain,\" continued the doctor, looking at Cotherstone and the others, \"is that Kitely was strangled by this rope, and that everything on him of any value was taken. You'd better find out what he had, or was likely to have, on him, sergeant. Ask the housekeeper.\"  Miss Pett came from the inner room, where she had already begun her preparations for laying out the body. She was as calm as when Bent first told her of what had occurred, and she stood at the end of the table, the cord between her and her questioners, and showed no emotion, no surprise at what had occurred.  \"Can you tell aught about this, ma'am?\" asked the sergeant. \"You see your master's met his death at somebody's hands, and there's no doubt he's been robbed, too. Do you happen to know what he had on him?\"  The housekeeper, who had her arms full of linen, set her burden down on a clothes-horse in front of the fire before she replied. She seemed to be thinking deeply, and when she turned round again, it was to shake her queerly ornamented head.  \"Well, I couldn't say exactly,\" she answered. \"But I shouldn't wonder if it was a good deal--for such as him, you know. He did carry money on him--he was never short of money ever since I knew him, and sometimes he'd a fair amount in his pockets--I know, of course, because he'd pull it out, loose gold, and silver, and copper, and I've seen him take bank-notes out of his pocket-book. But he'd be very like to have a good deal more than usual on him tonight.\"  \"Why?\" asked the sergeant.  \"Because he'd been to the bank this morning to draw his pension money,\" replied Miss Pett. \"I don't know how much that would be, any more than I know where it came from. He was a close man--he'd never tell anybody more than he liked, and he never told me aught about that. But I do know it was what you'd call a fair amount--for a man that lives in a cottage. He went to the bank this noon--he always went once a quarter--and he said this afternoon that he'd go and pay his rent to Mr. Cotherstone there--\"  \"As he did,\" muttered Cotherstone, \"yes--he did that.\"  \"Well, he'd have all the rest of his money on him,\" continued the housekeeper. \"And he'd have what he had before, because he'd other money coming in than that pension. And I tell you he was the sort of man that carried his money about him--he was foolish that way. And then he'd a very valuable watch and chain--he told me they were a presentation, and cost nearly a hundred pounds. And of course, he'd a pocket-book full of papers.\"  \"This pocket-book?\" asked the sergeant.  \"Aye, that's it, right enough,\" assented Miss Pett. \"But he always had it bursting with bits of letters and papers. You don't mean to say you found it empty? You did?--very well then, I'm no fool, and I say that if he's been murdered, there's been some reason for it altogether apart from robbing him of what money and things he had on him! Whoever's taken his papers wanted 'em bad!\"  \"About his habits, now?\" said the sergeant, ignoring Miss Pett's suggestion. \"Did he go walking on the Shawl every night?\"  \"Regular as clock-work,\" answered the housekeeper. \"He used to read and write a deal at night--then he'd side away all his books and papers, get his supper, and go out for an hour, walking round and about. Then he'd come in, put on his slippers--there they are, set down to warm for him--smoke one pipe, drink one glass of toddy--there's the stuff for it--and go to bed. He was the regularest man I ever knew, in all he did.\"  \"Was he out longer than usual tonight?\" asked Bent, who saw that the sergeant had no more to ask. \"You seemed to suggest that, when we came.\"  \"Well, he was a bit longer,\" admitted Miss Pett. \"Of course, he varied. But an hour was about his time. Up and down and about the hill-side he'd go--in and out of the coppices. I've warned him more than once.\"  \"But why?\" asked Brereton, whose curiosity was impelling him to take a part in this drama. \"What reason had you for warning him?\"  Miss Pett turned and looked scrutinizingly at her last questioner. She took a calm and close observation of him and her curious face relaxed into something like a smile.  \"I can tell what you are, mister,\" she said. \"A law gentleman! I've seen your sort many a time. And you're a sharp 'un, too! Well--you're young, but you're old enough to have heard a thing or two. Did you never hear that women have got what men haven't--instinct?\"  \"Do you really tell me that the only reason you had for warning him against going out late at night was--instinct?\" asked Brereton. \"Come, now!\"  \"Mostly instinct, anyhow,\" she answered. \"Women have a sort of feeling about things that men haven't--leastways, no men that I've ever met had it. But of course, I'd more than that. Mr. Kitely, now, he was a townsman--a London man. I'm a countrywoman. He didn't understand--you couldn't get him to understand--that it's not safe to go walking in lonely places in country districts like this late at night. When I'd got to know his habits, I expostulated with him more than once. I pointed out to him that in spots like this, where there's naught nearer than them houses at the foot of the hill one way, and Harborough's cottage another way, and both of 'em a good quarter of a mile off, and where there's all these coverts and coppices and rocks, it was not safe for an elderly man who sported a fine gold watch and chain to go wandering about in the darkness. There's always plenty of bad characters in country places who'd knock the King himself on the head for the sake of as much as Mr. Kitely had on him, even if it was no more than the chain which every Tom and Dick could see! And it's turned out just as I prophesied."]]]
