A devilish neat piece of work.\"  I thanked him. He deprecated the thanks. He had, he said, only done his duty, as a man is bound to do. He then introduced me to the elderly Irishman, who was, it seemed, a professor--of what I do not know--at Dublin University. By name, Derrick. He informed me that he always spent the summer at Lyme Regis.  \"I was surprised to see you at Lyme Regis,\" I said. \"When you got out at Yeovil, I thought I had seen the last of you.\"  I think I am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate turning of sentences.  \"I meant,\" I added speedily, \"I was afraid I had.\"  \"Ah, of course,\" he said, \"you were in our carriage coming down. I was confident I had seen you before. I never forget a face.\"  \"It would be a kindness,\" said Mr. Chase, \"if you would forget Garnet's as now exhibited. You'll excuse the personality, but you seem to have collected a good deal of the professor's property coming through that hedge.\"  \"I was wondering,\" I said with gratitude. \"A wash--if I might?\"  \"Of course, me boy, of course,\" said the professor. \"Tom, take Mr. Garnet off to your room, and then we'll have some lunch. You'll stay to lunch, Mr. Garnet?\"  I thanked him for his kindness and went off with my friend, the lieutenant, to the house. We imprisoned the hen in the stables, to its profound indignation, gave directions for lunch to be served to it, and made our way to Mr. Chase's room.  \"So you've met the professor before?\" he said, hospitably laying out a change of raiment for me--we were fortunately much of a height and build.  \"I have never spoken to him,\" I said. \"We traveled down together in a very full carriage, and I saw him next day on the beach.\"  \"He's a dear old boy, if you rub him the right way.\"  \"Yes?\" I said.  \"But--I'm telling you this for your good and guidance--he can cut up rough. And when he does, he goes off like a four point seven. I think, if I were you--you don't mind my saying this?--I think, if I were you, I should _not_ mention Mr. Tim Healy at lunch.\"  I promised that I would try to resist the temptation.  \"And if you _could_ manage not to discuss home rule--\"  \"I will make an effort.\"  \"On any other topic he will be delighted to hear your views. Chatty remarks on bimetallism would meet with his earnest attention. A lecture on what to do with the cold mutton would be welcomed. But not Ireland, if you don't mind. Shall we go down?\"  We got to know one another very well at lunch.  \"Do you hunt hens,\" asked Mr. Chase, who was mixing the salad--he was one of those men who seem to do everything a shade better than anyone else, \"for amusement or by your doctor's orders?\"  \"Neither,\" I said, \"and particularly not for amusement. The fact is I have been lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a chicken farm--\"  I was interrupted. All three of them burst into laughter. Mr. Chase in his emotion allowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth, missing the salad bowl by a clear two inches.  \"You don't mean to tell us,\" he said, \"that you really come from the one and only chicken farm?\"  I could not deny it.  \"Why, you're the man we've all been praying to meet for days past. Haven't we, professor?\"  \"You're right, Tom,\" chuckled Mr. Derrick.  \"We want to know all about it, Mr. Garnet,\" said Phyllis Derrick.  \"Do you know,\" continued Mr. Chase, \"that you are the talk of the town? Everybody is discussing you. Your methods are quite new and original, aren't they?\"  \"Probably,\" I replied. \"Ukridge knows nothing about fowls. I know less. He considers it an advantage. He said our minds ought to be unbiased by any previous experience.\"  \"Ukridge!\" said the professor. \"That was the name old Dawlish, the grocer, said. I never forget a name. He is the gentleman who lectures on the breeding of poultry, is he not? You do not?\"  I hastened to disclaim any such feat.  \"His lectures are very popular,\" said Phyllis with a little splutter of mirth.  \"He enjoys them,\" I said.  \"Look here, Garnet,\" said Mr. Chase, \"I hope you won't consider all these questions impertinent, but you've no notion of the thrilling interest we all take--at a distance--in your farm. We have been talking of nothing else for a week. I have dreamed of it three nights running. Is Mr. Ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation, or is he an eccentric millionaire?\"  \"He's not a millionaire. I believe he intends to be, though, before long, with the assistance of the fowls. But I hope you won't look on me as in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm. I am merely a laborer. The brain work of the business lies in Ukridge's department.\"  \"Tell me, Mr. Garnet,\" said Phyllis, \"do you use an incubator?\"  \"Oh, yes, we have an incubator.\"  \"I suppose you find it very useful?\"  \"I'm afraid we use it chiefly for drying our boots when they get wet,\" I said.  Only that morning Ukridge's spare pair of tennis shoes had permanently spoiled the future of half-a-dozen eggs which were being hatched on the spot where the shoes happened to be placed. Ukridge had been quite annoyed.  \"I came down here principally,\" I said, \"in search of golf. I was told there were links, but up to the present my professional duties have monopolized me.\"  \"Golf,\" said Professor Derrick. \"Why, yes. We must have a round or two together. I am very fond of golf. I generally spend the summer down here improving my game.\"  I said I should be delighted.         *       *       *       *       *  There was croquet after lunch--a game at which I am a poor performer. Miss Derrick and I played the professor and Chase. Chase was a little better than myself; the professor, by dint of extreme earnestness and care, managed to play a fair game; and Phyllis was an expert.  \"I was reading a book,\" said she, as we stood together watching the professor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn, \"by an author of the same surname as you, Mr. Garnet. Is he a relation of yours?\"  \"I am afraid I am the person, Miss Derrick,\" I said.  \"You wrote the book?\"  \"A man must live,\" I said apologetically.  \"Then you must have--oh, nothing.\"  \"I could not help it, I'm afraid. But your criticism was very kind.\"  \"Did you know what I was going to say?\"  \"I guessed.\"  \"It was lucky I liked it,\" she said with a smile.  \"Lucky for me,\" I said.  \"Why?\"  \"It will encourage me to write another book. So you see what you have to answer for. I hope it will not trouble your conscience.\"  At the other end of the lawn the professor was still patting the balls about, Chase the while advising him to allow for windage and elevation and other mysterious things.  \"I should not have thought,\" she said, \"that an author cared a bit for the opinion of an amateur.\"  \"It all depends.\"  \"On the author?\"  \"On the amateur.\"  It was my turn to play at this point. I missed--as usual.  \"I didn't like your heroine, Mr. Garnet.\"  \"That was the one crumpled rose leaf. I have been wondering why ever since. I tried to make her nice. Three of the critics liked her.\"  \"Really?\"  \"And the modern reviewer is an intelligent young man. What is a 'creature,' Miss Derrick?\"  \"Pamela in your book is a creature,\" she replied unsatisfactorily, with the slightest tilt of the chin.  \"My next heroine shall be a triumph,\" I said.  She should be a portrait, I resolved, from life.  Shortly after, the game came somehow to an end. I do not understand the intricacies of croquet. But Phyllis did something brilliant and remarkable with the balls, and we adjourned for tea, which had been made ready at the edge of the lawn while we played.  The sun was setting as I left to return to the farm, with the hen stored neatly in a basket in my hand. The air was deliciously cool and full of that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a broiling midsummer afternoon. Far away--the sound seemed almost to come from another world--the tinkle of a sheep bell made itself heard, deepening the silence. Alone in a sky of the palest blue there twinkled a small bright star.  I addressed this star.  \"She was certainly very nice to me,\" I said. \"Very nice, indeed.\"  The star said nothing.  \"On the other hand,\" I went on, \"I don't like that naval man. He is a good chap, but he overdoes it.\"  The star winked sympathetically.  \"He calls her Phyllis,\" I said.  \"Charawk,\" said the hen satirically from her basket.     A LITTLE DINNER  VIII   \"Edwin comes to-day,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.  \"And the Derricks,\" said Ukridge, sawing at the bread in his energetic way. \"Don't forget the Derricks, Millie.\"  \"No, dear. Mrs. Beale is going to give us a very nice dinner. We talked it over yesterday.\"  \"Who is Edwin?\" I asked.  We were finishing breakfast on the second morning after my visit to the Derricks. I had related my adventures to the staff of the farm on my return, laying stress on the merits of our neighbors and their interest in our doings, and the hired retainer had been sent off next morning with a note from Mrs. Ukridge, inviting them to look over the farm and stay to dinner.  \"Edwin?\" said Ukridge. \"Beast of a cat.\"  \"O Stanley!\" said Mrs. Ukridge plaintively. \"He's not. He's such a dear, Mr. Garnet. A beautiful, pure-bred Persian. He has taken prizes.\"  \"He's always taking something--generally food. That's why he didn't come down with us.\"  \"A great, horrid _beast_ of a dog bit him, Mr. Garnet.\" Mrs. Ukridge's eyes became round and shining. \"And poor Edwin had to go to a cats' hospital.\"  \"And I hope,\" said Ukridge, \"the experience will do him good. Sneaked a dog's bone, Garnet, under his very nose, if you please. Naturally, the dog lodged a protest.\"  \"I'm so afraid that he will be frightened of Bob. He will be very timid, and Bob's so exceedingly boisterous. Isn't he, Mr. Garnet?\"  I owned that Bob's manner was not that of a Vere de Vere.  \"That's all right,\" said Ukridge; \"Bob won't hurt him, unless he tries to steal his bone. In that case we will have Edwin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20533"],["title","Jill the Reckless (#0)"],["body","THE                                RECKLESS                                      BY                             P.

Through a gleaming eye-glass he inspected the revolting object which Barker, his faithful man, had placed on a plate before him.  \"Barker!\" His voice had a ring of pain.  \"Sir?\"  \"What's this?\"  \"Poached egg, sir.\"  Freddie averted his eyes with a silent shudder.  \"It looks just like an old aunt of mine,\" he said. \"Remove it!\"  He got up, and, wrapping his dressing-gown about his long legs, took up a stand in front of the fireplace. From this position he surveyed the room, his shoulders against the mantelpiece, his calves pressing the club fender. It was a cheerful oasis in a chill and foggy world, a typical London bachelor's breakfast-room. The walls were a restful grey, and the table, set for two, a comfortable arrangement in white and silver.  \"Eggs, Barker,\" said Freddie solemnly, \"are the acid test!\"  \"Yes, sir?\"  \"If, on the morning after, you can tackle a poached egg, you are all right. If not, not. And don't let anybody tell you otherwise.\"  \"No, sir.\"  Freddie pressed the palm of his hand to his brow, and sighed.  \"It would seem, then, that I must have revelled a trifle whole-heartedly last night. I was possibly a little blotto. Not whiffled, perhaps, but indisputably blotto. Did I make much noise coming in?\"  \"No, sir. You were very quiet.\"  \"Ah! A dashed bad sign!\"  Freddie moved to the table, and poured himself a cup of coffee.  \"The cream jug is to your right, sir,\" said the helpful Barker.  \"Let it remain there. _Café noir_ for me this morning. As _noir_ as it can jolly well stick!\" Freddie retired to the fireplace and sipped delicately. \"As far as I can remember, it was Ronny Devereux' birthday or something....\"  \"Mr. Martyn's, I think you said, sir.\"  \"That's right. Algy Martyn's birthday, and Ronny and I were the guests. It all comes back to me. I wanted Derek to roll along and join the festivities--he's never met Ronny--but he gave it a miss. Quite right! A chap in his position has responsibilities. Member of Parliament and all that. Besides,\" said Freddie earnestly, driving home the point with a wave of his spoon, \"he's engaged to be married. You must remember that, Barker!\"  \"I will endeavour to, sir.\"  \"Sometimes,\" said Freddie dreamily, \"I wish I were engaged to be married. Sometimes I wish I had some sweet girl to watch over me and.... No, I don't, by Jove. It would give me the utter pip! Is Sir Derek up yet, Barker?\"  \"Getting up, sir.\"  \"See that everything is all right, will you? I mean as regards the food-stuffs and what not. I want him to make a good breakfast. He's got to meet his mother this morning at Charing Cross. She's legging it back from the Riviera.\"  \"Indeed, sir?\"  Freddie shook his head.  \"You wouldn't speak in that light, careless tone if you knew her! Well, you'll see her to-night. She's coming here to dinner.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Miss Mariner will be here, too. A foursome. Tell Mrs. Barker to pull up her socks and give us something pretty ripe. Soup, fish, all that sort of thing. _She_ knows. And let's have a stoup of malvoisie from the oldest bin. This is a special occasion!\"  \"Her ladyship will be meeting Miss Mariner for the first time, sir?\"  \"You've put your finger on it! Absolutely the first time on this or any stage! We must all rally round and make the thing a success.\"  \"I am sure Mrs. Barker will strain every nerve, sir.\" Barker moved to the door, carrying the rejected egg, and stepped aside to allow a tall, well-built man of about thirty to enter. \"Good morning, Sir Derek.\"  \"Morning, Barker.\"  Barker slid softly from the room. Derek Underhill sat down at the table. He was a strikingly handsome man, with a strong, forceful face, dark, lean and cleanly shaven. He was one of those men whom a stranger would instinctively pick out of a crowd as worthy of note. His only defect was that his heavy eyebrows gave him at times an expression which was a little forbidding. Women, however, had never been repelled by it. He was very popular with women, not quite so popular with men--always excepting Freddie Rooke, who worshipped him. They had been at school together, though Freddie was the younger by several years.  \"Finished, Freddie?\" asked Derek.  Freddie smiled wanly.  \"We are not breakfasting this morning,\" he replied. \"The spirit was willing, but the jolly old flesh would have none of it. To be perfectly frank, the Last of the Rookes has a bit of a head.\"  \"Ass!\" said Derek.  \"A bit of sympathy,\" said Freddie, pained, \"would not be out of place. We are far from well. Some person unknown has put a threshing-machine inside the old bean and substituted a piece of brown paper for our tongue. Things look dark and yellow and wobbly!\"  \"You shouldn't have overdone it last night.\"  \"It was Algy Martyn's birthday,\" pleaded Freddie.  \"If I were an ass like Algy Martyn,\" said Derek, \"I wouldn't go about advertising the fact that I'd been born. I'd hush it up!\"  He helped himself to a plentiful portion of kedgeree, Freddie watching him with repulsion mingled with envy. When he began to eat the spectacle became too poignant for the sufferer, and he wandered to the window.  \"What a beast of a day!\"  It was an appalling day. January, that grim month, was treating London with its usual severity. Early in the morning a bank of fog had rolled up off the river, and was deepening from pearly white to a lurid brown. It pressed on the window-pane like a blanket, leaving dark, damp rivulets on the glass.  \"Awful!\" said Derek,  \"Your mater's train will be late.\"  \"Yes. Damned nuisance. It's bad enough meeting trains in any case, without having to hang about a draughty station for an hour.\"  \"And it's sure, I should imagine,\" went on Freddie, pursuing his train of thought, \"to make the dear old thing pretty tolerably ratty, if she has one of those slow journeys.\" He pottered back to the fireplace, and rubbed his shoulders reflectively against the mantelpiece. \"I take it that you wrote to her about Jill?\"  \"Of course. That's why she's coming over, I suppose. By the way, you got those seats for that theatre to-night?\"  \"Yes. Three together and one somewhere on the outskirts. If it's all the same to you, old thing, I'll have the one on the outskirts.\"  Derek, who had finished his kedgeree and was now making himself a blot on Freddie's horizon with toast and marmalade, laughed.  \"What a rabbit you are, Freddie! Why on earth are you so afraid of mother?\"  Freddie looked at him as a timid young squire might have gazed upon St. George when the latter set out to do battle with the dragon. He was of the amiable type which makes heroes of its friends. In the old days when he had fagged for him at Winchester he had thought Derek the most wonderful person in the world, and this view he still retained. Indeed, subsequent events had strengthened it. Derek had done the most amazing things since leaving school. He had had a brilliant career at Oxford, and now, in the House of Commons, was already looked upon by the leaders of his party as one to be watched and encouraged. He played polo superlatively well, and was a fine shot. But of all his gifts and qualities the one that extorted Freddie's admiration in its intensest form was his lion-like courage as exemplified by his behaviour in the present crisis. There he sat, placidly eating toast and marmalade, while the boat-train containing Lady Underhill already sped on its way from Dover to London. It was like Drake playing bowls with the Spanish Armada in sight.  \"I wish I had your nerve!\" he said awed. \"What I should be feeling, if I were in your place and had to meet your mater after telling her that I was engaged to marry a girl she had never seen, I don't know. I'd rather face a wounded tiger!\"  \"Idiot!\" said Derek placidly.  \"Not,\" pursued Freddie, \"that I mean to say anything in the least derogatory and so forth to your jolly old mater, if you understand me, but the fact remains she scares me pallid. Always has, ever since the first time I went to stay at your place when I was a kid. I can still remember catching her eye the morning I happened by pure chance to bung an apple through her bedroom window, meaning to let a cat on the sill below have it in the short ribs. She was at least thirty feet away, but, by Jove, it stopped me like a bullet!\"  \"Push the bell, old man, will you? I want some more toast.\"  Freddie did as he was requested, with growing admiration.  \"The condemned man made an excellent breakfast,\" he murmured. \"More toast, Barker,\" he added, as that admirable servitor opened the door. \"Gallant! That's what I call it. Gallant!\"  Derek tilted his chair back.  \"Mother is sure to like Jill when she sees her,\" he said.  \"_When_ she sees her! Ah! But the trouble is, young feller-me-lad, that"]]]
