His frequent use metaphorically of the expressions, \"contrivance,\" for example, and \"purpose,\" has elicited, from the Duke of Argyll and others, criticisms which fail to tell against their         {15} opponent, because such expressions are, in Mr. Darwin's writings, merely figurative--metaphors, and nothing more.  It may be hoped, then, that a similar looseness of expression will account for passages of a directly opposite tendency to that of his theistic metaphors.  Moreover, it must not be forgotten that he frequently uses that absolutely theological term, \"the Creator,\" and that he has retained in all the editions of his \"Origin of Species\" an expression which has been much criticised. He speaks \"of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms, or into one.\"[9] This is merely mentioned in justice to Mr. Darwin, and by no means because it is a position which this book is intended to support. For, from Mr. Darwin's usual mode of speaking, it appears that by such divine action he means a supernatural intervention, whereas it is here contended that throughout the whole process of physical evolution--the first manifestation of life included--_supernatural_ action is assuredly not to be looked for.  Again, in justice to Mr. Darwin, it may be observed that he is addressing the general public, and opposing the ordinary and common objections of popular religionists, who have inveighed against \"Evolution\" and \"Natural Selection\" as atheistic, impious, and directly conflicting with the dogma of creation.  Still, in so important a matter, it is to be regretted that he did not take the trouble to distinguish between such merely popular views and those which repose upon some more venerable authority. Mr. John Stuart Mill has replied to similar critics, and shown that the assertion that his philosophy is irreconcilable with theism is unfounded; and it would have been better if Mr. Darwin had dealt in the same manner with some of his assailants, and shown the futility of certain of their objections when {16} viewed from a more elevated religious standpoint. Instead of so doing, he seems to adopt the narrowest notions of his opponents, and, far from endeavouring to expand them, appears to wish to endorse them, and to lend to them the weight of his authority. It is thus that Mr. Darwin seems to admit and assume that the idea of \"creation\" necessitates a belief in an interference with, or dispensation of, natural laws, and that \"creation\" must be accompanied by arbitrary and unorderly phenomena. None but the crudest conceptions are placed by him to the credit of supporters of the dogma of creation, and it is constantly asserted that they, to be consistent, must offer \"creative fiats\" as explanations of physical phenomena, and be guilty of numerous other such absurdities. It is impossible, therefore, to acquit Mr. Darwin of at least a certain carelessness in this matter; and the result is, he has the appearance of opposing ideas which he gives no clear evidence of having ever fully appreciated. He is far from being alone in this, and perhaps merely takes up and reiterates, without much consideration, assertions previously assumed by others. Nothing could be further from Mr. Darwin's mind than any, however small, intentional misrepresentation; and it is therefore the more unfortunate that he should not have shown any appreciation of a position opposed to his own other than that gross and crude one which he combats so superfluously--that he should appear, even for a moment, to be one of those, of whom there are far too many, who first misrepresent their adversary's view, and then elaborately refute it; who, in fact, erect a doll utterly incapable of self-defence and then, with a flourish of trumpets and many vigorous strokes, overthrow the helpless dummy they had previously raised.  This is what many do who more or less distinctly oppose theism in the interests, as they believe, of physical science; and they often represent, amongst other things, a gross and narrow anthropomorphism as the necessary consequence of views opposed to those which they themselves advocate.  {17} Mr. Darwin and others may perhaps be excused if they have not devoted much time to the study of Christian philosophy; but they have no right to assume or accept, without careful examination, as an unquestioned fact, that in that philosophy there is a necessary antagonism between the two ideas, \"creation\" and \"evolution,\" as applied to organic forms.  It is notorious and patent to all who choose to seek, that many distinguished Christian thinkers have accepted and do accept both ideas, _i.e._ both \"creation\" and \"evolution.\"  As much as ten years ago, an eminently Christian writer observed: \"The creationist theory does not necessitate the perpetual search after manifestations of miraculous powers and perpetual 'catastrophes.' Creation is not a miraculous interference with the laws of nature, but the very institution of those laws. Law and regularity, not arbitrary intervention, was the patristic ideal of creation. With this notion, they admitted without difficulty the most surprising origin of living creatures, provided it took place by _law_. They held that when God said, 'Let the waters produce,' 'Let the earth produce,' He conferred forces on the elements of earth and water, which enabled them naturally to produce the various species of organic beings. This power, they thought, remains attached to the elements throughout all time.\"[10] The same writer quotes St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, to the effect that, \"in the institution of nature we do not look for miracles, but for the laws of nature.\"[11] And, again, St. Basil,[12] speaks of the continued operation of natural laws in the production of all organisms. [Page 18]  So much for writers of early and mediæval times. As to the present day, the Author can confidently affirm that there are many as well versed in theology as Mr. Darwin is in his own department of natural knowledge, who would not be disturbed by the thorough demonstration of his theory. Nay, they would not even be in the least painfully affected at witnessing the generation of animals of complex organization by the skilful artificial arrangement of natural forces, and the production, in the future, of a fish, by means analogous to those by which we now produce urea.  And this because they know that the possibility of such phenomena, though by no means actually foreseen, has yet been fully provided for in the old philosophy centuries before Darwin, or even before Bacon, and that their place in the system can be at once assigned them without even disturbing its order or marring its harmony.  Moreover, the old tradition in this respect has never been abandoned, however much it may have been ignored or neglected by some modern writers. In proof of this it may be observed that perhaps no post-mediæval theologian has a wider reception amongst Christians throughout the world than Suarez, who has a separate section[13] in opposition to those who maintain the distinct creation of the various kinds--or substantial forms--of organic life.  But the consideration of this matter must be deferred for the present, and the question of evolution, whether Darwinian or other, be first gone into. It is proposed, after that has been done, to return to this subject (here merely alluded to), and to consider at some length the bearing of \"Evolution,\" whether Darwinian or non-Darwinian, upon \"Creation and Theism.\"  Now we will revert simply to the consideration of the theory of \"Natural Selection\" itself.                                                                         {19} Whatever may have hitherto been the amount of acceptance that this theory has met with, all, I think, anticipated that the appearance of Mr. Darwin's large and careful work on \"Animals and Plants under Domestication\" could but further increase that acceptance. It is, however, somewhat problematical how far such anticipations will be realized. The newer book seems to add after all but little in support of the theory, and to leave most, if not all, its difficulties exactly where they were. It is a question, also, whether the hypothesis of \"Pangenesis\"[14] may not be found rather to encumber than to support the theory it was intended to subserve. However, the work in question treats only of domestic animals, and probably the next instalment will address itself more vigorously and directly to the difficulties which seem to us yet to bar the way to a complete acceptance of the doctrine.  If the theory of Natural Selection can be shown to be quite insufficient to explain any considerable number of important phenomena connected with the origin of species, that theory, as _the_ explanation, must be considered as provisionally discredited.  If other causes than Natural (including sexual) Selection can be proved to have acted--if variation can in any cases be proved to be subject to certain determinations in special directions by other means than Natural Selection, it then becomes probable _a priori_ that it is so in others, and that Natural Selection depends upon, and only supplements, such means, {20} which conception is opposed to the pure Darwinian position.  Now it is certain, _a priori_, that variation is obedient to some law and therefore that \"Natural Selection\" itself must be capable of being subsumed into some higher law; and it is evident, I believe, _a posteriori_, that Natural Selection is, at the very least, aided and supplemented by some other agency.  Admitting, then, organic and other evolution, and that new forms of animals and plants (new species, genera, &c.) have from time to time been evolved from preceding animals and plants, it follows, if the views here advocated are true, that this evolution has not taken place by the action of \"Nat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20818"],["title","On the Genesis of Species (#5)"],["body","Selection\" _alone_, but through it (amongst other influences) aided by the concurrent action of some other natural law or laws, at present undiscovered; and probably that the genesis of species takes place partly, perhaps mainly, through laws which may be most conveniently spoken of as special powers and tendencies existing in each organism; and partly through influences exerted on each by surrounding conditions and agencies organic and inorganic, terrestrial and cosmical, among which the \"survival of the fittest\" plays a certain but subordinate part.  The theory of \"Natural Selection\" may (though it need not) be taken in such a way as to lead men to regard the present organic world as formed, so to speak, _accidentally_, beautiful and wonderful as is confessedly the hap-hazard result. The same may perhaps be said with regard to the system advocated by Mr. Herbert Spencer, who, however, also relegates \"Natural Selection\" to a subordinate _rôle_. The view here advocated, on the other hand, regards the whole organic world as arising and going forward in one harmonious development similar to that which displays itself in the growth and action of each separate individual organism. It also regards each such separate organism as the expression of powers and tendencies not to be {21} accounted for by \"Natural Selection\" alone, or even by that together with merely the direct influence of surrounding conditions.  The difficulties which appear to oppose themselves to the reception of \"Natural Selection\" or \"the survival of the fittest,\" as the one explanation of the origin of species, have no doubt been already considered by Mr. Darwin. Nevertheless, it may be worth while to enumerate them, and to state the considerations which appear to give them weight; and there is no doubt but that a naturalist so candid and careful as the author of the theory in question, will feel obliged, rather than the reverse, by the suggestion of all the doubts and difficulties which can be brought against it.  What is to be brought forward may be summed up as follows:--  That \"Natural Selection\" is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful structures.  That it does not harmonize with the co-existence of closely similar structures of diverse origin.  That there are grounds for thinking that specific differences may be developed suddenly instead of gradually.  That the opinion that species have definite though very different limits to their variability is still tenable.  That certain fossil transitional forms are absent, which might have been expected to be present.  That some facts of geographical distribution supplement other difficulties.  That the objection drawn from the physiological difference between \"species\" and \"races\" still exists unrefuted.  That there are many remarkable phenomena in organic forms upon which \"Natural Selection\" throws no light whatever, but the explanations of which, if they could be attained, might throw light upon specific origination. [Page 22]  Besides these objections to the sufficiency of \"Natural Selection,\" others may be brought against the hypothesis of \"Pangenesis,\" which, professing as it does to explain great difficulties, seems to do so by presenting others not less great--almost to be the explanation of _obscurum per          {23} obscurius_.         *       *       *       *       *   CHAPTER II.  THE INCOMPETENCY OF \"NATURAL SELECTION\" TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INCIPIENT STAGES OF USEFUL STRUCTURES.      Mr. Darwin supposes that natural selection acts by slight     variations.--These must be useful at once.--Difficulties as to the     giraffe; as to mimicry; as to the heads of flat-fishes; as to the     origin and constancy of the vertebrate limbs; as to whalebone; as to     the young kangaroo; as to sea-urchins; as to certain processes of     metamorphosis; as to the mammary gland; as to certain ape characters;     as to the rattlesnake and cobra; as to the process of formation of the     eye and ear; as to the fully developed condition of the eye and ear; as     to the voice; as to shell-fish; as to orchids; as to ants.--The     necessity for the simultaneous modification of many     individuals.--Summary and conclusion.  \"Natural Selection,\" simply and by itself, is potent to explain the maintenance or the further extension and development of favourable variations, which are at once sufficiently considerable to be useful from the first to the individual possessing them. But Natural Selection utterly fails to account for the conservation and development of the minute and rudimentary beginnings, the slight and infinitesimal commencements of structures, however useful those structures may afterwards become.  Now, it is distinctly enunciated by Mr. Darwin, that the spontaneous variations upon which his theory depends are individually slight, minute, and insensible. He says,[15] \"Slight individual differences, however,  {24} suffice for the work, and are probably the sole differences which are effective in the production of new species.\" And again, after mentioning the frequent sudden appearances of domestic varieties, he speaks of \"the false belief as to the similarity of natural species in this respect.\"[16] In his work on the \"Origin of Species,\" he also observes, \"Natural Selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications.\"[17] And \"Natural Selection, if it be a true principle, will banish the belief ... of any great and sudden modification in their structure.\"[18] Finally, he adds, \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\"[19]  Now the conservation of minute variations in many instances is, of course, plain and intelligible enough; such, _e.g._, as those which tend to promote the destructive faculties of beasts of prey on the one hand, or to facilitate the flight or concealment of the animals pursued on the other; provided always that these minute beginnings are of such a kind as really to have a certain efficiency, however small, in favour of the conservation of the individual possessing them; and also provided that no unfavourable peculiarity in any other direction accompanies and neutralizes, in the struggle for life, the minute favourable variation.  But some of the cases which have been brought forward, and which have met with very general acceptance, seem less satisfactory when carefully analysed than they at first appear to be. Amongst these we may mention \"the neck of the giraffe.\"  At first sight it would seem as though a better example in support of \"Natural Selection\" could hardly have been chosen. Let the fact of the {25} occurrence of occasional, severe droughts in the country which that animal has inhabited be granted. In that case, when the ground vegetation has been consumed, and the trees alone remain, it is plain that at such times only those individuals (of what we assume to be the nascent giraffe species) which were able to reach high up would be preserved, and would become the parents of the following generation, some individuals of which would, of course, inherit that high-reaching power which alone preserved their parents. Only the high-reaching issue of these high-reaching individuals would again, _cæteris paribus_, be preserved at the next drought, and would again transmit to their offspring their still loftier stature; and so on, from period to period, through æons of time, all the individuals tending to revert to the ancient shorter type of body, being ruthlessly destroyed at the occurrence of each drought.  (1.) But against this it may be said, in the first place, that the argument proves too much; for, on this supposition, many species must have tended to undergo a similar modification, and we ought to have at least several forms, similar to the giraffe, developed from different Ungulata.[20] A careful observer of animal life, who has long resided in South Africa, explored the interior, and lived in the giraffe country, has assured the Author that the giraffe has powers of locomotion and endurance fully equal to those possessed by any of the other Ungulata of that continent. It would seem, therefore, that some of these other Ungulates ought to have developed in a similar manner as to the neck, under pain of being starved, when the long neck of the giraffe was in its incipient stage.  To this criticism it has been objected that different kinds of animals are preserved, in the struggle for life, in very different ways, and even  {26} that \"high reaching\" may be attained in more modes than one--as, for example, by the trunk of the elephant. This is, indeed, true, but then none of the African Ungulata[21] have, nor do they appear ever to have had, any proboscis whatsoever; nor have they acquired such a development as to allow them to rise on their hind limbs and graze on trees in a kangaroo-attitude, nor a power of climbing, nor, as far as known, any other modification tending to compensate for the comparative shortness of the neck. Again, it may perhaps be said that leaf-eating forms are exceptional, and that therefore the struggle to attain high branches would not affect many Ungulates. But surely, when these severe droughts necessary for the theory occur, the ground vegetation is supposed to be exhausted; and, indeed, the giraffe is quite capable of feeding from off the ground. So that, in these cases, the other Ungulata _must_ have taken to leaf eating or have starved, and thus must have had any accidental long-necked varieties favoured and preserved exactly as the long-necked varieties of the giraffe are supposed to have been favoured and preserved.  The argument as to the different modes of preservation has been very well put by Mr. Wallace,[22] in reply to the objection that \"colour, being dangerous, should not exist in nature.\" This objection appears similar to"]]]
