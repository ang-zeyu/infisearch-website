The mansion was a handsome sandstone residence, standing in its own grounds. On Kent's arrival he found that the police had already drawn a cordon around it with cords. Groups of morbid curiosity-seekers hung about it in twos and threes, some of them in fours and fives. Policemen were leaning against the fence in all directions. They wore that baffled look so common to the detective force of the metropolis. \"It seems to me,\" remarked one of them to the man beside him, \"that there is an inexorable chain of logic about this that I am unable to follow.\" \"So do I,\" said the other.  The Chief Inspector of the Detective Department, a large, heavy-looking man, was standing beside a gate-post. He nodded gloomily to Transome Kent.  \"Are you baffled, Edwards?\" asked Kent.  \"Baffled again, Mr. Kent,\" said the Inspector, with a sob in his voice. \"I thought I could have solved this one, but I can't.\"  He passed a handkerchief across his eyes.  \"Have a cigar, Chief,\" said Kent, \"and let me hear what the trouble is.\"  The Inspector brightened. Like all policemen, he was simply crazy over cigars. \"All right, Mr. Kent,\" he said, \"wait till I chase away the morbid curiosity-seekers.\"  He threw a stick at them.  \"Now, then,\" continued Kent, \"what about tracks, footmarks? Had you thought of them?\"  \"Yes, first thing. The whole lawn is covered with them, all stamped down. Look at these, for instance. These are the tracks of a man with a wooden leg\"--Kent nodded--\"in all probability a sailor, newly landed from Java, carrying a Singapore walking-stick, and with a tin-whistle tied round his belt.\"  \"Yes, I see that,\" said Kent thoughtfully. \"The weight of the whistle weighs him down a little on the right side.\"  \"Do you think, Mr. Kent, a sailor from Java with a wooden leg would commit a murder like this?\" asked the Inspector eagerly. \"Would he do it?\"  \"He would,\" said the Investigator. \"They generally do--as soon as they land.\"  The Inspector nodded. \"And look at these marks here, Mr. Kent. You recognize them, surely--those are the footsteps of a bar-keeper out of employment, waiting for the eighteenth amendment to pass away. See how deeply they sink in----\"  \"Yes,\" said Kent, \"he'd commit murder.\"  \"There are lots more,\" continued the Inspector, \"but they're no good. The morbid curiosity-seekers were walking all over this place while we were drawing the cordon round it.\"  \"Stop a bit,\" said Kent, pausing to think a moment. \"What about thumb-prints?\"  \"Thumb-prints,\" said the Inspector. \"Don't mention them. The house is full of them.\"  \"Any thumb-prints of Italians with that peculiar incurvature of the ball of the thumb that denotes a Sicilian brigand?\"  \"There were three of those,\" said Inspector Edwards gloomily. \"No, Mr. Kent, the thumb stuff is no good.\"  Kent thought again.  \"Inspector,\" he said, \"what about mysterious women? Have you seen any around?\"  \"Four went by this morning,\" said the Inspector, \"one at eleven-thirty, one at twelve-thirty, and two together at one-thirty. At least,\" he added sadly, \"I think they were mysterious. All women look mysterious to me.\"  \"I must try in another direction,\" said Kent. \"Let me reconstruct the whole thing. I must weave a chain of analysis. Kivas Kelly was a bachelor, was he not?\"  \"He was. He lived alone here.\"  \"Very good, I suppose he had in his employ a butler who had been with him for twenty years----\"  Edwards nodded.  \"I suppose you've arrested him?\"  \"At once,\" said the Inspector. \"We always arrest the butler, Mr. Kent. They expect it. In fact, this man, Williams, gave himself up at once.\"  \"And let me see,\" continued the Investigator. \"I presume there was a housekeeper who lived on the top floor, and who had been stone deaf for ten years?\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"She had heard nothing during the murder?\"  \"Not a thing. But this may have been on account of her deafness.\"  \"True, true,\" murmured Kent. \"And I suppose there was a coachman, a thoroughly reliable man, who lived with his wife at the back of the house----\"  \"But who had taken his wife over to see a relation on the night of the murder, and who did not return until an advanced hour. Mr. Kent, we've been all over that. There's nothing in it.\"  \"Were there any other persons belonging to the establishment?\"  \"There was Mr. Kelly's stenographer, Alice Delary, but she only came in the mornings.\"  \"Have you seen her?\" asked Kent eagerly. \"What is she like?\"  \"I have seen her,\" said the Inspector. \"She's a looloo.\"  \"Ha,\" said Kent, \"a looloo!\" The two men looked into one another's eyes.  \"Yes,\" repeated Edwards thoughtfully, \"a peach.\"  A sudden swift flash of intuition, an inspiration, leapt into the young reporter's brain.  This girl, this peach, at all hazards he must save her life.     CHAPTER III  I MUST BUY A BOOK ON BILLIARDS   Kent turned to the Inspector. \"Take me into the house,\" he said. Edwards led the way. The interior of the handsome mansion seemed undisturbed. \"I see no sign of a struggle here,\" said Kent.  \"No,\" answered the Inspector gloomily. \"We can find no sign of a struggle anywhere. But, then, we never do.\"  He opened for the moment the door of the stately drawing-room. \"No sign of a struggle there,\" he said. The closed blinds, the draped furniture, the covered piano, the muffled chandelier, showed absolutely no sign of a struggle.  \"Come upstairs to the billiard-room,\" said Edwards. \"The body has been removed for the inquest, but nothing else is disturbed.\"  They went upstairs. On the second floor was the billiard-room, with a great English table in the centre of it. But Kent had at once dashed across to the window, an exclamation on his lips. \"Ha! ha!\" he said, \"what have we here?\"  The Inspector shook his head quietly. \"The window,\" he said in a monotonous, almost sing-song tone, \"has apparently been opened from the outside, the sash being lifted with some kind of a sharp instrument. The dust on the sill outside has been disturbed as if by a man of extraordinary agility lying on his stomach----Don't bother about that, Mr. Kent. It's _always_ there.\"  \"True,\" said Kent. Then he cast his eyes upward, and again an involuntary exclamation broke from him. \"Did you see that trap-door?\" he asked.  \"We did,\" said Edwards. \"The dust around the rim has been disturbed. The trap opens into the hollow of the roof. A man of extraordinary dexterity might open the trap with a billiard cue, throw up a fine manila rope, climb up the rope and lie there on his stomach.  \"No use,\" continued the Inspector. \"For the matter of that, look at this huge old-fashioned fireplace. A man of extraordinary precocity could climb up the chimney. Or this dumb-waiter on a pulley, for serving drinks, leading down into the maids' quarters. A man of extreme indelicacy might ride up and down in it.\"  \"Stop a minute,\" said Kent. \"What is the meaning of that hat?\"  A light gossamer hat, gay with flowers, hung on a peg at the side of the room.  \"We thought of that,\" said Edwards, \"and we have left it there. Whoever comes for that hat has had a hand in the mystery. We think----\"  But Transome Kent was no longer listening. He had seized the edge of the billiard table.  \"Look, look!\" he cried eagerly. \"The clue to the mystery! The positions of the billiard balls! The white ball in the very centre of the table, and the red just standing on the verge of the end pocket! What does it mean, Edwards, what does it mean?\"  He had grasped Edwards by the arm and was peering into his face.  \"I don't know,\" said the Inspector. \"I don't play billiards.\"  \"Neither do I,\" said Kent, \"but I can find out. Quick! The nearest book-store. I must buy a book on billiards.\"  With a wave of the arm, Kent vanished.  The Inspector stood for a moment in thought.  \"Gone!\" he murmured to himself (it was his habit to murmur all really important speeches aloud to himself). \"Now, why did Throgton telephone to me to put a watch on Kent? Ten dollars a day to shadow him! Why?\"     CHAPTER IV  THAT IS NOT BILLIARD CHALK   Meantime at the _Planet_ office Masterman Throgton was putting on his coat to go home.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" said an employé, \"there's a lot of green billiard chalk on your sleeve.\"  Throgton turned and looked the man full in the eye.  \"That is not billiard chalk,\" he said, \"it is face powder.\"  Saying which this big, imperturbable, self-contained man stepped into the elevator and went to the ground floor in one drop.     CHAPTER V  HAS ANYBODY HERE SEEN KELLY?   The inquest upon the body of Kivas Kelly was held upon the following day. Far from offering any solution of what had now become an unfathomable mystery, it only made it deeper still. The medical testimony, though given by the most distinguished consulting expert of the city, was entirely inconclusive. The body, the expert testified, showed evident marks of violence. There was a distinct lesion of the oesophagus and a decided excoriation of the fibula. The mesodenum was gibbous. There was a certain quantity of flab in the binomium and the proscenium was wide open.  One striking fact, however, was decided from the testimony of the expert, namely, that the stomach of the deceased was found to contain half a pint of arsenic. On this point the questioning of the district attorney was close and technical. Was it unusual, he asked, to find arsenic in the stomach? In the stomach of a club man, no. Was not half a pint a large quantity? He would not say that. Was it a small quantity? He should not care to say that it was. Would half a pint of arsenic cause death? Of a club man, no, not necessarily. That was all.  The other testimony submitted to the inquest jury brought out various facts of a substantive character, but calculated rather to complicate than to unravel the mystery. The butler swore that on the very day of the murder he had served his master a half-pint of arsenic at lunch."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20638"],["title","From Plotzk to Boston (#0)"],["body","Plotzk to Boston   BY MARY ANTIN   WITH A FOREWORD BY  ISRAEL ZANGWILL     BOSTON, MASS.

HECHT  WITH THE LOVE AND GRATITUDE OF THE AUTHOR          *       *       *       *       *   FOREWORD   The \"infant phenomenon\" in literature is rarer than in more physical branches of art, but its productions are not likely to be of value outside the doting domestic circle. Even Pope who \"lisped in numbers for the numbers came,\" did not add to our Anthology from his cradle, though he may therein have acquired his monotonous rocking-metre. Immaturity of mind and experience, so easily disguised on the stage or the music-stool--even by adults--is more obvious in the field of pure intellect. The contribution with which Mary Antin makes her d嶵ut in letters is, however, saved from the emptiness of embryonic thinking by being a record of a real experience, the greatest of her life; her journey from Poland to Boston. Even so, and remarkable as her description is for a girl of eleven--for it was at this age that she first wrote the thing in Yiddish, though she was thirteen when she translated it into English--it would scarcely be worth publishing merely as a literary curiosity. But it happens to possess an extraneous value. For, despite the great wave of Russian immigration into the United States, and despite the noble spirit in which the Jews of America have grappled with the invasion, we still know too little of the inner feelings of the people themselves, nor do we adequately realize what magic vision of free America lures them on to face the great journey to the other side of the world.  Mary Antin's vivid description of all she and her dear ones went through, enables us to see almost with our own eyes how the invasion of America appears to the impecunious invader. It is thus \"a human document\" of considerable value, as well as a promissory note of future performance. The quick senses of the child, her keen powers of observation and introspection, her impressionability both to sensations and complex emotions--these are the very things out of which literature is made; the raw stuff of art. Her capacity to handle English--after so short a residence in America--shows that she possesses also the instrument of expression. More fortunate than the poet of the Ghetto, Morris Rosenfeld, she will have at her command the most popular language in the world, and she has already produced in it passages of true literature, especially in her impressionistic rendering of the sea and the bustling phantasmagoria of travel.  What will be her development no one can say precisely, and I would not presume either to predict or to direct it, for \"the wind bloweth where it listeth.\" It will probably take lyrical shape. Like most modern Jewesses who have written, she is, I fear, destined to spiritual suffering: fortunately her work evidences a genial talent for enjoyment and a warm humanity which may serve to counterbalance the curse of reflectiveness. That she is growing, is evident from her own Introduction, written only the other day, with its touches of humor and more complex manipulation of groups of facts. But I have ventured to counsel delay rather than precipitation in production--for she is not yet sixteen--and the completion of her education, physical no less than intellectual; and it is to this purpose that such profits as may accrue from this publication will be devoted. Let us hope this premature recognition of her potentialities will not injure their future flowering, and that her development will add to those spiritual and intellectual forces of which big-hearted American Judaism stands sorely in need. I should explain in conclusion, that I have neither added nor subtracted, even a comma, and that I have no credit in \"discovering\" Mary Antin. I did but endorse the verdict of that kind and charming Boston household in which I had the pleasure of encountering the gifted Polish girl, and to a member of which this little volume is appropriately dedicated.  I. ZANGWILL.     PREFATORY   In the year 1891, a mighty wave of the emigration movement swept over all parts of Russia, carrying with it a vast number of the Jewish population to the distant shores of the New World--from tyranny to democracy, from darkness to light, from bondage and persecution to freedom, justice and equality. But the great mass knew nothing of these things; they were going to the foreign world in hopes only of earning their bread and worshiping their God in peace. The different currents that directed the course of that wave cannot be here enumerated. Suffice it to say that its power was enormous. All over the land homes were broken up, families separated, lives completely altered, for a common end.  The emigration fever was at its height in Plotzk, my native town, in the central western part of Russia, on the Dvina River. \"America\" was in everybody's mouth. Business men talked of it over their accounts; the market women made up their quarrels that they might discuss it from stall to stall; people who had relatives in the famous land went around reading their letters for the enlightenment of less fortunate folks; the one letter-carrier informed the public how many letters arrived from America, and who were the recipients; children played at emigrating; old folks shook their sage heads over the evening fire, and prophesied no good for those who braved the terrors of the sea and the foreign goal beyond it;--all talked of it, but scarcely anybody knew one true fact about this magic land. For book-knowledge was not for them; and a few persons--they were a dressmaker's daughter, and a merchant with his two sons--who had returned from America after a long visit, happened to be endowed with extraordinary imagination, (a faculty closely related to their knowledge of their old country-men's ignorance), and their descriptions of life across the ocean, given daily, for some months, to eager audiences, surpassed anything in the Arabian Nights. One sad fact threw a shadow over the splendor of the gold-paved, Paradise-like fairyland. The travelers all agreed that Jews lived there in the most shocking impiety.  Driven by a necessity for bettering the family circumstances, and by certain minor forces which cannot now be named, my father began to think seriously of casting his lot with the great stream of emigrants. Many family councils were held before it was agreed that the plan must be carried out. Then came the parting; for it was impossible for the whole family to go at once. I remember it, though I was only eight. It struck me as rather interesting to stand on the platform before the train, with a crowd of friends weeping in sympathy with us, and father waving his hat for our special benefit, and saying--the last words we heard him speak as the train moved off--  \"Good-bye, Plotzk, forever!\"  Then followed three long years of hope and doubt for father in America and us in Russia. There were toil and suffering and waiting and anxiety for all. There were--but to tell of all that happened in those years I should have to write a separate history. The happy day came when we received the long-coveted summons. And what stirring times followed! The period of preparation was one of constant delight to us children. We were four--my two sisters, one brother and myself. Our playmates looked up to us in respectful admiration; neighbors, if they made no direct investigations, bribed us with nice things for information as to what was going into every box, package and basket. And the house was dismantled--people came and carried off the furniture; closets, sheds and other nooks were emptied of their contents; the great wood-pile was taken away until only a few logs remained; ancient treasures such as women are so loath to part with, and which mother had carried with her from a dear little house whence poverty had driven us, were brought to light from their hiding places, and sacrificed at the altar whose flames were consuming so much that was fraught with precious association and endeared by family tradition; the number of bundles and boxes increased daily, and our home vanished hourly; the rooms became quite uninhabitable at last, and we children glanced in glee, to the anger of the echoes, when we heard that in the evening we were to start upon our journey.  But we did not go till the next morning, and then as secretly as possible. For, despite the glowing tales concerning America, people flocked to the departure of emigrants much as they did to a funeral; to weep and lament while (in the former case only, I believe) they envied. As everybody in Plotzk knew us, and as the departure of a whole family was very rousing, we dared not brave the sympathetic presence of the whole township, that we knew we might expect. So we gave out a false alarm.  Even then there was half the population of Plotzk on hand the next morning. We were the heroes of the hour. I remember how the women crowded around mother, charging her to deliver messages to their relatives in America; how they made the air ring with their unintelligible chorus; how they showered down upon us scores of suggestions and admonitions; how they made us frantic with their sympathetic weeping and wringing of hands; how, finally, the ringing of the signal bell set them all talking faster and louder than ever, in desperate efforts to give the last bits of advice, deliver the last messages, and, to their credit let it be said, to give the final, hearty, unfeigned good-bye kisses, hugs and good wishes.  Well, we lived through three years of waiting, and also through a half hour of parting. Some of our relatives came near being carried off, as, heedless of the last bell, they lingered on in the car. But at last they, too, had to go, and we, the wanderers, could"]]]
