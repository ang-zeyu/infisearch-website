All this is detailed in the confidential report that will be handed to you when you leave. The report, incidentally, is slanted in a way that obscures its vital nature, but on the basis of what has been said at this meeting, I'm sure you'll find all your answers.\"  Brent paused, waiting for questions. When none came, he said, \"I guess that about covers it, gentlemen--at least, all that we have at the moment. You'll be kept informed. The meeting is adjourned.\"  He glanced around. \"Oh, by the way, as you'll note in the confidential report, this project will be identified as 'Operation Blue Sky.'\"  \"Where did they get that one?\" Jones snorted.  \"I don't know. The term originated higher up. Possibly,\" Brent murmured, \"because somewhere out in the blue sky lies the answer.\" His manner changed and he glanced briskly around. \"Would anyone care for a cup of coffee?\"  No one was interested in coffee and the group filed out.         *       *       *       *       *  Ten minutes later, the white-coated waiter came to pick up the things. He crossed to the coffeepot, lifted it, and took a tiny device out of the hidden space formed by the pot's legs and its bottom. This, he slipped into his pocket before picking up the tray and going out as he'd come.     3   Frank Corson got what was possibly the greatest shock of his life when he walked into Ward Five and saw William Matson lying in bed. It wasn't so much that he hadn't expected it. He had, because he was too firmly locked in reality to believe the man he saw on the Upper East Side could possibly have been the broken-legged Matson. Still, seeing Matson in bed had the effect of bringing unreality into a realm where he had to cope with it. Perhaps, during the trip back to the hospital, he'd been mystically apprised of what lay ahead and wanted subconsciously to avoid it. Perhaps his shock was a cringing away from facing a problem.  At the moment, of course, he didn't know what the problem was. There was a mystery here, but only that, and his first thought was to report it to higher authority--the business about the two hearts--and have it investigated. With this thought in mind, he walked down the corridor and reached for the knob of the door marked _Superintendent_.  But quite suddenly he stopped, reversed himself, and went back to Ward Five. He approached Matson's bed and looked down at him. Matson, empty of expression, stared back, and again Frank Corson sensed rather than saw the emptiness behind the eyes.  \"How are you feeling?\"  \"I feel very--well.\"  \"It wasn't a bad break. How would you like to leave the hospital?\"  \"I would like to leave the--hospital.\"  Frank felt an odd, inner frustration. What in the devil was wrong with the man? He sounded like a child just learning the language. Yet there was nothing else to indicate backwardness. He looked pretty much like a self-sufficient, self-contained adult.  \"I can sign you out--get you a pair of crutches. By the way, I don't think the hospital got your home address.\"  \"My home--address?\"  \"Yes. The place you live.\" There was a pause, and finally Frank realized the man wasn't going to answer. \"Your home, man. Where you live.\"  \"I'm looking for a--home.\"  \"Oh, I see. New in town?\"  \"Yes, new in--town.\"  \"I have a place,\" Frank said, and it seemed to him as though someone else were talking from within him--that he was only a listener. \"You can crowd in with me until you get settled somewhere.\"  \"I can crowd in with--you?\"  \"Okay?\"  \"Okay.\"  \"Fine, I'll see that you're signed out. Ever walk on crutches before?\"  \"I never walked on--crutches.\"  \"Nothing much to it. You'll get the knack.\"  Frank left the bed and headed toward the office, asking himself as he went, _Why in hell did I do that?_ Then he found the reason--or at least a reason that would suffice.  The discovery of a man with two hearts might be worth something. At least, it would put Frank Corson, unknown intern, into the spotlight for a while. This was pretty vague thinking but it made a kind of sense and Frank settled for it in lieu of trying to analyze the strange compulsion, the odd foreboding deep within him.  _Here's a thing that might do me some good_, he told himself. _Why not take advantage of it?_  Perhaps he was rigidly blocking out the cause of his unrest--that he was more or less dependent upon Rhoda Kane for the luxuries that were involved in seeing her, having a relationship with her. He could neither ask her to dine with him on his level, at some place like Nedick's, nor could he refuse to go with her to The Forum or the Four Seasons. He could not take her to his miserable furnished room on East 13th Street, nor refuse rendezvous in her Upper East Side apartment.  He was trapped and was thus desperately looking for a way out.  And somehow, grotesquely, there were indications that a man with two hearts might help to provide the answer.         *       *       *       *       *  The tape recorder stuck to the bottom of the Taber conference coffeepot had cost Senator Crane a hundred dollars. He had now listened to it four times and was pacing the floor of his office, scowling darkly at the walls. An android! What in hell was an android? What kind of a stupid, impossible thing was this?  In a flash of panic, Crane wondered if it was all a diabolical machination of Brent Taber's. Maybe Taber knew all about the recorder. Maybe the whole meeting was an elaborate plant to maneuver an earnest, alert senator into making a public fool of himself. Taber was certainly capable of such a thing.  And that was how it had begun to look. Still, that was ridiculous. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force--they were all involved. Only Congress--the true representatives of the people--had been ignored. And, by God, he'd do something about it!  Crane stopped pacing but continued to scowl at the wall. Now, what department of research could find him some data on androids?         *       *       *       *       *  Les King was awakened by a knock on his door. He rolled over, blinked and looked at his watch. A little after two in the afternoon, which was equivalent to midnight for Les. He pulled on his robe and went to the door and opened it.  He blinked.  Sure, no doubt about it. The man standing there was the one he'd snapped on Park Avenue the other A.M., lying among a bunch of pigeons, with a broken leg. But evidently that hadn't been the case because his legs were okay now. It couldn't even have been a sprain, judging by the way he was standing there. He was a fairly tall, good-looking guy in his middle forties maybe--brown hair, blue eyes with a kind of vacant look about them.  And there was something else, goddamn it; something that kept evading Les; something that had bothered him when he'd first developed the print. _Let's see, what is this guy's name? The ambulance intern found it in his jacket pocket on a half-torn identification card. William Matson._  But, damn it, there was something else.  \"Mr. Lester--King?\"  \"Right. What can I do for you?\"  \"I had trouble in locating--you. I wish to make a--purchase.\"  Queer duck. Damned queer. \"What can I sell you?\"  \"You are a--photographer. You took a picture of a man injured on Park--Avenue. I wish to buy that--picture.\"  Les knotted his robe and stepped back. \"Sure. Come on in.\"  The man entered the room and stood silent while Les got out his file. \"What do you want it for?\" he asked.  \"It is for my personal--use.\"  \"Sure.\" Les handed the glossy to the man he identified in his own mind as Matson. \"That the one?\"  After a grave inspection, the other replied, \"Yes. How much does it cost--me?\"  \"Ten bucks?\"  Without comment, the man sorted a ten-dollar bill from a skimpy roll he took from his pocket and handed it to Les. With that, he turned and walked out, closing the door after him and leaving several questions in Les King's mind. Was this a vanity operation? Had the guy merely wanted a glossy of himself? He hadn't impressed Les as being that kind of man. Was there a reason for wanting the pic off the market? That didn't make sense either because he hadn't asked for the negative.  Quite suddenly, in answer to the really important, the nagging, question, Les snapped his fingers. The hem of his dressing gown flapped around his skinny legs as he dived to his old file rack and went back where the dust was thick. He brought out an envelope, dug into it, and found what he was looking for--an old newspaper clipping dated some ten years back. It consisted of a headline:    LOCAL POLITICIAN DISAPPEARS  The clipping was from the Kenton, New York, _Chronicle_, an upstate weekly, and the news story told how Judge Sam Baker had vanished on a fishing trip to a nearby lake. Accidental drowning had been the verdict but, as yet, the body had not been recovered.  Les King stared at the clipping. The body, as he remembered it, never was recovered, either, but the drowning verdict stood intact and the judge had been gradually forgotten.  Les King's interest in the affair had been financial. He'd gone to Kenton, talked Baker's widow out of a couple of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20856"],["title","Ten From Infinity (#5)"],["body","photographs, and had hiked back to New York, hoping for a sale to a big daily.  But the story hadn't caught on even though it well might have, because Baker's power extended into Albany and could thus have interested New York City. All in all, it had been a profitless speculation on Les King's part.  Now, however, it seemed to be coming to life again. Les stared at the photo under the headline. It was a good one--exceptionally clear.  And beyond a shadow of a doubt, it was the man who had just come to Les King's room to purchase a glossy of himself for ten dollars. No wonder the sight of that stranger had nagged at Les. He'd seen that face before.  \"Now just what in the hell have we got here?\" Les mused. Something definitely worth looking into, that was for sure.  He reached for his pants.     4   Dr. Rudolph Entman, one of the world's foremost neurologists, stripped off his rubber gloves and scowled at the strange body that lay on the table before him.  \"Goddamn it,\" he fumed, \"it's artificially constructed. It's been hand-made--manufactured. And there's one thing I'd give a few years of my life to know.\"  Brent Taber stared moodily into Entman's myopic little eyes and asked, \"What's that, Doctor?\"  \"How in hell did they do it?\"  \"Who do you suppose _they_ are?\"  Entman looked ceilingward in a manner that indicated he might either be hunting for _them_ somewhere out beyond, or sending a prayer heavenward in a plea for Divine counsel and guidance.  \"Some form of entity with far greater intelligence than we possess.\"  \"You can tell me more than that, can't you?\" Brent asked sharply. And when Doctor Entman looked up in surprise, he added, \"Sorry for the tone. My nerves have gotten a little edgy lately.\"  Entman smiled understandingly. \"I don't wonder. As to this living machine--no ... it's not a machine because it did _live_. Let's see what we can figure out. What's it made of? The material used in its construction is--oh, hell--how can I put it? This way, maybe. Take a wool blanket and call it genuine flesh, blood and bone. Now, take a blanket made of one of the new synthetics--Dacron or any one of the other equally serviceable materials--call that the material this creature is made of. Figuring it that way--\"  \"You mean our visitor's body is constructed of things that feel and look like flesh, blood and bone--work as well, but aren't. Right?\"  \"Right. But, of course, that doesn't tell you anything you didn't know before.\"  \"But what about their potentials, their capabilities? They're _human_--in the sense that they're exact duplicates of humans--and they _live_, but what about emotions? If we accept the somewhat unscientific theory that it's a soul which is responsible for feelings and emotions, these ... these ... creatures would be handicapped.\" Brent paused as if uncertain of his ground. \"Wouldn't they?\" he asked lamely. \"I mean, they couldn't--theoretically, at least--react to situations ... or other people's emotions.\"  Doctor Entman nodded his head and murmured, \"I would be inclined to agree. Except that we're obviously dealing with superior intelligence--I'm speaking about the \"people\" responsible for these androids--and we have no idea how far they might have progressed in duplicating that indefinable something we call a soul.\"  For a moment he lapsed into silence. Then looked up at Brent abruptly. \"Have you read anything on Kendrick's experiments with synthetic emotion?\"  \"Can't say that I have.\"  \"Kendrick, down at Penton Technological Institute, has done some remarkable things in drawing the stuff of human emotion from one person, holding it on a tape, and transferring it to another person.\"  \"On the face of it, that sounds ridiculous.\"  \"Doesn't it? Nevertheless, the vibrations set up, or created you might say, by a person in anger, consist of some sort of _stuff_--in the sense of an incredibly high frequency wave. Radio or television waves are the best comparisons.  \"Kendrick, in one demonstration, took a young man who was very much in love with a certain young lady. A really love-sick lad. He placed him in the recording unit gave him the young lady's picture, and told him to let his mind dwell on her to the exclusion of all else.\"  Doctor Entman smiled briefly. \"This, I imagine, wasn't difficult for the lad to do. Entman then put another young man, one who was unacquainted with the girl, into a receiving unit and exposed him, after giving him the girl's picture, to the vibrations created by the lovelorn chap. Later, they saw to it that the second lad was introduced to the girl. The results were rather startling, in that the young lady suddenly had two ardent suitors in place of one.\"  Brent Taber scratched his ear and looked dubious. \"That sounds pretty sensational. But maybe the second lad just plain happened to fall in love with the girl by natural processes.\"  \"True, but the experiments tended to eliminate that possibility. Other emotions were tested. How about a man walking up to a man he'd never seen before in his life and busting him in the nose?\"  \"Okay, okay. Then you think--\"  \"I think a lot of things. Here, I see the possibility of a race with superior science, having moved far ahead of us in the directions Kendrick is pointing toward in his research. For instance, with more advanced knowledge and know-how, they've probably been able to charge a synthetic body with a complete set of functioning emotional responses. Grant them that and we can also concede a tailor-made ego.\"  \"I don't mind admitting I'm scared, Doctor,\" Brent Taber said.  \"I think it's a time to be scared.\"  \"But if a race of people were that advanced, if their intention is hostile, why do they pussyfoot around this way? Why don't they just come down and take us over?\"  \"I've wondered that, too. And yet, a race on some planet out there in the universe might not evolve according to what we consider a logical pattern.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean that while they can create a synthetic man, their interests, and therefore their progress, may have stayed in peaceful channels. For instance, they may not have bothered with anything as elementary as the atom bomb.\"  \"It's a thought.\"  \"A wishful thought, I'll admit. But it does have some validity. Also, it has a fact of some possible value to back it up.\"  \"What fact?\"  \"That they _haven't_ come down and taken us over.\"  \"You almost cheer me, Doctor. Almost, but not quite.\"  \"Actually,\" Entman said, \"I've been wondering about something else.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"When and how they came here before.\"  \"You mean, where did they get the model for the ten androids?\"  \"Yes. They had to have not only a model, but also some knowledge concerning our geographical and atmospheric conditions. The two hearts indicate that they knew the elements contained in our air--the pressures and so forth necessary to our existence--and were unable to construct a working model that would function under our conditions with a single heart. So they put in two.\"  \"It looks as though they missed on some other things, too. Seven of the androids have expired.\"  Entman shrugged. \"Still--a remarkable job, particularly since they would have no chance for a trial-and-error test under the conditions that would prevail. It's surprising that _any_ of the androids were able to keep functioning.\"  \"The eighth one is pretty sick. He may be gone by now. And about their earlier coming, I can give you one point. They came quietly, probably at night, grabbed their model, and moved out fast.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  \"Because, obviously, they think all men on earth look alike. Or, at least, we can assume that. Else how did they expect to get away with ten identical androids?\"  Entman's eyes widened. \"I never thought of that,\" he muttered.         *       *       *       *       *  Senator Crane, a doggedly determined man, had listened to the replay of Brent Taber's top-secret conference again and again. In the comfortable rationalization of which he was capable, his whole zeal and hostility were fashioned around Brent's \"arrogant disregard of democratic processes.\" Who did this bureaucrat think he was? Did he consider himself smarter than the People? Did he feel they couldn't be trusted with revelations affecting their survival? Well, by God, they'd been trusted with word of the bomb and its implications, and they'd reacted admirably. So they were entitled to frankness concerning this new threat to their security.  Of course, Senator Crane reserved the right to enlighten them in his own time and in his own way. After all, hadn't they elected him and thus given him leeway to use his own judgment in their best interests?  But who the hell had elected Brent Taber?  Nobody.  So Crane listened to the recording and picked out what he classified as the key lines.       _A routine autopsy revealed some peculiar things ... The man had      two hearts...._       _The blood? Could it have been a new kind of plasma?..._       _All in all, gentlemen, eight identical specimens have been picked      up in various American cities ...       Exactly alike...._   Crane ran through the rest of it and threw himself moodily into a chair. The idiots! The stupid unelected, self-appointed guardians of democracy! Not once--not _once_, mind you--had a single one of these great brains referred to the obvious.  It was a Russian plot!  All those allusions to the extraterrestrial was so much bilge. The Russians were infiltrating the country with synthetic men. This meant--oh, God--it meant that in a short time Russia would be able to create an army of these monsters and overwhelm the world.  Senator Crane sprang to his feet and measured his indignation in long strides across the thick, expensive carpeting on his floor. The traitor! The sheer, compulsive opportunist! That was certainly all that Brent Taber could be called. Using this deadly situation as a means of furthering his own interests.  Senator Crane deliberately stilled his rage and"]]]
