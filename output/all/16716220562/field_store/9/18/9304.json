We cannot see stars fainter than the sixth magnitude with the naked eye.  [Illustration: PISCES]     TRIANGULUM (trī-an´-gū-lum)--THE TRIANGLE. (Face East.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from the star γ Pegasi to Algol in Perseus passes through β Trianguli.  The triangle is clearly defined and a beautiful figure. It lies just below Andromeda, and above Aries.  Triangulum is a very ancient constellation, being formerly named Deltoton, from the Greek letter Delta Δ.  It was in this locality that Piazzi discovered the asteroid Ceres, January 1, 1800.  α Trianguli is sometimes called \"Caput Trianguli.\"  α and β Trianguli were known as \"The Scale Beam.\" According to Argelander the constellation contains fifteen stars.  The Triangle has been likened to the Trinity, and the Mitre of St. Peter.  [Illustration: TRIANGULUM]     AQUARIUS (a-kwā´ri-us)--THE WATER CARRIER. (Face Southwest.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from β Pegasi to α of the same constellation, and prolonged as far again, ends just east of the so-called water jar of Aquarius, which is formed by a group of four stars in the form of a \"Y,\" as indicated in the diagram. The Arabians called these four stars a tent.  The jar is represented as inverted, allowing a stream of water represented by dim stars in pairs and groups of three stars, to descend, ending in the bright star Fomalhaut, the mouth of the Southern Fish.  A rough map of South America can be traced in the stars θ, λ, τ, δ, 88, ι.  A rude dipper can be made out in the western part of the constellation, formed of the stars α, β, ν, ε.  The stars τ and ζ are doubles. Of the former pair, one is white, the other orange in color. Fomalhaut was the object of sunrise worship in the temple of Demeter at Eleusis in 500 B.C. The ancients called this region of the sky \"the Sea.\"  In the vicinity of δ, Mayer observed in 1756 what he termed a fixed star. Herschel thought it a comet. It proved to be the planet Uranus.  ζ is almost exactly on the celestial equator.  λ is a red star, the most prominent of the first stars in the stream. The stars in Piscis Australis can be traced out with an opera-glass.  Fomalhaut and Capella, in Auriga, rise almost exactly at the same minute.  Fomalhaut is one of the four \"royal stars\" of astrology. The others are Regulus, Antares, and Aldebaran.  [Illustration: AQUARIUS]     CAPRICORNUS (kap-ri-kôr´-nus)--THE SEA GOAT. (Face Southwest.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from α Pegasi through ζ and θ in the same constellation, and projected about 25°, strikes α and β in Capricornus.  This constellation contains three principal stars--α and β mentioned above, and δ about 20° east of them.  The water jar of Aquarius is about the same distance northeast of δ Capricorni that Fomalhaut, in the Southern Fish, is southeast of it.  α has a companion which can be seen by the naked eye. It is a fine sight in an opera-glass. These two stars are gradually separating.  β is a double star, one being blue, the other yellow.  The constellation resembles a chapeau, or peaked hat, upside down.  The stars in the head of the Sea Goat, α and β are only 2° apart, and can hardly be mistaken by an observer facing the southwestern sky during the early evening in autumn.  Five degrees east of δ is the point announced by Le Verrier as the position of his predicted new planet, Neptune.  Flammarion claims that the Chinese astronomers noted the five planets in conjunction in Capricornus, in the year 2449 B.C.  The sign of the Goat was called by the ancient Orientalists \"The Southern Gate of the Sun.\"  [Illustration: CAPRICORNUS]     ARIES (ā´-ri-ēz)--THE RAM. (Face Southeast.)   LOCATION.--The star α in Aries, known as Hamal, and sometimes as Arietis, a star of the second magnitude, is about 7° south of α Trianguli. A line drawn from the Pole Star to γ Andromedæ, and prolonged about 20°, ends at Hamal.  Aries contains three principal stars, forming a characteristic obtuse-angled triangle.  The star γ Arietis was one of the first double stars discovered. A telescope is required to split it. Hamal lies near the path of the moon, and is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned.  Below Aries may be seen the characteristic pentagon in the head of Cetus, the Whale.  More than two thousand years ago Aries was the leading constellation of the zodiac, and now stands first in the list of zodiacal signs.  The Arabians knew this constellation as Al Hamal, the sheep.  β and γ are one instance out of many where stars of more than ordinary brightness are seen together in pairs, the brightest star being generally on the east.  [Illustration: ARIES]     CETUS (sē´-tus)--THE WHALE. (Face Southeast.)   LOCATION.--A line drawn from Polaris, to δ Cassiopeiæ, and prolonged two and one third times its original length, reaches the centre of this constellation.  It lies just below Aries and the Triangle, and resembles the figure of the prehistoric icthyosaurus, while some see in the outline an easy chair. The head of the beast is characterized by a clearly traced pentagon, about 20° southeast of Aries. The brightest star in the constellation is α of the second magnitude. It is at one apex of the pentagon, about 15° east of Al Rischa in Pisces, and 37° directly south of Algol.  The noted variable Mira also known as ο Ceti is the chief object of interest in this constellation.  It was discovered by Fabricius in 1596 and varies from the ninth magnitude to the third or fourth in a period of 334 days. It can be observed during its entire range with a 3\" glass.  In 1779 Mira is reported to have been as bright as the first-magnitude star Aldebaran. It lies almost exactly on a line joining γ and ζ Ceti a little nearer the former. Ten degrees south of it are four faint stars about 3° apart forming a square.  τ Ceti is one of our nearest neighbors at a distance of nine light years.  ζ is a naked-eye double star.  [Illustration: CETUS]     MUSCA (mus´-kä)--THE FLY. (Face Southeast.)   LOCATION.--Musca lies between Triangulum and Aries, the diagram clearly defining its position.  The four stars composing it form a group shaped like the letter \"Y.\"  There is nothing of particular interest to be noted in this asterism. It does not appear on modern star charts and is considered obsolete.  So great is the distance that separates us from the stars that as for the great majority had they been blotted out of existence before the Christian era, we of to-day should still receive their light and seem to see them just as we do. When we scan the nocturnal skies we study ancient history. We do not see the stars as they are but as they were centuries on centuries ago.  [Illustration: MUSCA]     METEORIC SHOWERS.

Brilliant displays were seen in 1872 and 1885.  The Leonids are characterized by their exceedingly swift flight. They are of a greenish or bluish tint and leave behind them a vivid and persistent train. In most years the display is not especially noteworthy. Once in thirty-three years they afford an exhibition grand beyond description as in 1833 and 1866.     THE CONSTELLATIONS OF WINTER.  [Illustration: Map showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40° N. at 9 o'clock, January first.]     TAURUS (tâ´-rus)--THE BULL. (Face Southwest.)   LOCATION.--Taurus contains the well-known and unmistakable group the Pleiades, on the right shoulder of the Bull. A \"V\" shaped group known as the Hyades is just to the southeast of the Pleiades, in the face of the Bull, forming one of the most beautiful objects in the sky.  The brightest star in Taurus is Aldebaran, a ruddy-hued star known as \"The Follower.\" It is at the beginning of the \"V\" in the Hyades, and is at the apex of a triangle formed by Capella, in Auriga, and α Persei, and equally distant from them both.  The star β called Nath, is peculiarly white, and is common to Taurus and Auriga. It represents the tip of one of the Bull's horns, and the right foot of the Charioteer. The Pleiades are mentioned in Chinese annals in 2357 B.C. On a photograph of the group over 2000 stars have been counted.  The ecliptic passes a little south of a point midway between the two horns, where a scattered and broken stream of minute stars can be seen.  Note two pretty pairs in the Hyades, one south of Aldebaran, the other northwest of it.  There are rich clusters below the tip of the horn over Orion's head.  Taurus was an important object of worship by the Druids.  Aldebaran is near one eye of the Bull, and used to be called \"The Bull's Eye.\" An occultation of it by the moon, which not infrequently occurs, is a striking phenomenon.  The Eskimos regard the Pleiades as a team of dogs in pursuit of a bear. The group is receding from us at the rate of thirteen miles a second and has a common eastward motion of about ten seconds a century.  [Illustration: TAURUS]     ORION (ŏ-rī´-on)--THE GIANT HUNTER. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Orion is considered the finest constellation in the heavens. A line drawn from Nath to ζ Tauri (the tips of the Bull's horns), and extended 15°, strikes the brilliant Betelgeuze in Orion, known as the martial star. It forms the northeast corner of a conspicuous parallelogram. The splendid first-magnitude star Rigel is diagonally opposite Betelgeuze, and the girdle and sword of the Hunter lie within the parallelogram, a very striking group. The former is represented by three bright stars in a line 3° long known as the \"Three Stars,\" because there are no other stars in the heavens that exactly resemble them in position and brightness.  In the sword there is the most remarkable nebula in the heavens. It may be seen with an opera-glass and in a telescope it is a wonderful sight. Bellatrix is called the Amazon star. Note the contrasting colours of α and β.  About 9° west of Bellatrix are eight stars in a curved line running north and south. These point out the Lion's skin held in the Hunter's left hand.  Below λ there are two stars forming a triangle with it. Flammarion calls this region the California of the sky.  The celestial equator passes nearly through δ.  Orion was worshipped in China during the one thousand years before our era, and was known to the Chinese as the \"White Tiger.\"  The Eskimos see in the Belt stars the three steps cut by some celestial Eskimo in a steep snow bank to enable him to reach the top.  [Illustration: ORION]     LEPUS (lē´-pus)--THE HARE. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Lepus crouches under Orion's feet. Four stars in the constellation form an irregular and conspicuous quadrilateral.  γ is a beautiful double of a greenish hue.  Four or five degrees south of Rigel are four faint stars which are in the ear of the hare. They can be seen on a clear night with the naked eye.  The curved line of three stars θ, η, and ζ, are in the back of the hare.  Lepus is about 18° west of Canis Major, and, by reason of the earth's motion, the Great Dog seems to be pursuing the Hare around the heavens.  The first-magnitude stars that are visible in the winter season in this latitude present a fine contrast in color. Even the untrained eye can see a decided difference between the bluish white color of the brilliant Sirius, the Dog star that the Belt stars point south to, and Rigel, and the ruddy Betelgeuze. Procyon has a yellowish tinge and resembles the condition of our sun, while Betelgeuze is surrounded by heavy metallic vapors and is thought to be approaching extinction.  R marks the location of \"Hind's crimson star,\" a famous variable.  [Illustration: LEPUS]     COLUMBA NOACHI (co-lum´-bä nō-ä´-ki)--NOAH'S DOVE. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Columba is situated just south of Lepus. A line drawn from Rigel, in Orion, to β Leporis, and prolonged as far again, ends near α and β, the two brightest stars in Columba.  A line drawn from the easternmost star in the belt of Orion, 32° directly south, will point out Phaet, in Columba. It makes with Sirius, in Canis Major, and Naos, in the Ship, a large equilateral triangle.  The star β Columbæ may be known by means of a smaller star just east of it, marked γ.  The Chinese call α Chang Jin, the old Folks. Lockyer thinks it was of importance in Egyptian temple worship, and observed from Edfu and Philæ as far back as 6400 B.C.  On a clear starlight night there are not more than a thousand stars visible to the naked eye at one time. The largest telescope reveals nearly a hundred million.  [Illustration: COLUMBA]     CANIS MAJOR (kā´-nis mā-jor)--THE GREATER DOG. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--The three stars in Orion's girdle point southeast to Sirius, the dog star, in Canis Major, the most brilliant star in the heavens. It was connected in the minds of the Egyptians with the rising of the Nile, and is receding from the earth at the rate of twenty miles a second.  The star ν is a triple. The cluster (41 M.) can be seen with an opera-glass, just below it.  Between δ and ο¹ note a remarkable array of minute stars, also the very red star 22.  δ and ζ are doubles for an opera-glass.  Below η there is a fine group.  Betelgeuze, in Orion, Procyon, in Canis Minor, and Sirius form a nearly equilateral triangle. These stars with Naos, in the Ship, and Phaet, in the Dove, form a huge figure known as the Egyptian \"X.\"  From earliest times Sirius has been known as the Dog of Orion. It is 324 times brighter than the average sixth-magnitude star, and is the nearest to the earth of all the stars in this latitude, its distance being 8.7 light years. At this distance the Sun would appear as a star a little brighter than the Pole Star.  [Illustration: CANIS MAJOR]     ARGO NAVIS (är´-go nā´-vis)--THE SHIP ARGO. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Argo is situated southeast of Canis Major. If a line joining Betelgeuze and Sirius be prolonged 18° southeast, it will point out Naos, a star of the second magnitude in the rowlock of the Ship. This star is in the southeast corner of the Egyptian \"X.\"  The star π is of a deep yellow or orange hue. It has three little stars above it, two of which form a pretty pair.  The star ζ has a companion, which is a test for an opera-glass.  The star κ is a double for an opera-glass.  Note the fine star cluster (46 M.).  The star Markeb forms a small triangle with two other stars near it.  The Egyptians believed that this was the ark that bore Osiris and Isis over the Deluge.  The constellation contains two noted objects invisible in this latitude, Canopus, the second brightest star, and the remarkable variable star η.  [Illustration: PUPPIS]     MONOCEROS (mō-nos´-e-ros)--THE UNICORN. (Face South.)   LOCATION.--Monoceros is to be found east of Orion between Canis Major and Canis Minor. Three of its stars of the fourth magnitude form a straight line northeast and southwest, about 9° east of Betelgeuze, and about the same distance south of Alhena, in Gemini.  The region around the stars 8, 13, 17 is particularly rich when viewed with an opera-glass.  Note also a beautiful field about the variable S, and a cluster about midway between α and β.  Two stars about 7° apart in the tail of the Unicorn are pointer stars to Procyon. These stars are known as 30 and 31. The former is about 16° east of Procyon, and is easily identified as it has a sixth-magnitude star on either side of it. About 4° southwest of this star a good field-glass will reveal a beautiful star cluster.  [Illustration: MONOCEROS] "]]]
