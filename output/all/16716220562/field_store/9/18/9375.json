CHAPTER I.  _INTRODUCTORY._      The problem of the genesis of species stated.--Nature of its probable     solution.--Importance of the question.--Position here     defended.--Statement of the DARWINIAN THEORY.--Its applicability to     details of geographical distribution; to rudimentary structures; to     homology; to mimicry, &c.--Consequent utility of the theory.--Its wide     acceptance.--Reasons for this, other than, and in addition to, its     scientific value.--Its simplicity.--Its bearing on religious     questions.--_Odium theologicum_ and _odium antitheologicum_.--The     antagonism supposed by many to exist between it and theology neither     necessary nor universal.--Christian authorities in favour of     evolution.--Mr. Darwin's \"Animals and Plants under     Domestication.\"--Difficulties of the Darwinian theory enumerated.  The great problem which has so long exercised the minds of naturalists, namely, that concerning the origin of different kinds of animals and plants, seems at last to be fairly on the road to receive--perhaps at no very distant future--as satisfactory a solution as it can well have.  But the problem presents peculiar difficulties. The birth of a \"species\" has often been compared with that of an \"individual.\" The origin, however, of even an individual animal or plant (that which determines an embryo to evolve itself,--as, _e.g._, a spider rather than a beetle, a rose-plant {2} rather than a pear) is shrouded in obscurity. _A fortiori_ must this be the case with the origin of a \"species.\"  Moreover, the analogy between a \"species\" and an \"individual\" is a very incomplete one. The word \"individual\" denotes a concrete whole with a real, separate, and distinct existence. The word \"species,\" on the other hand, denotes a peculiar congeries of characters, innate powers and qualities, and a certain nature realized indeed in individuals, but having no separate existence, except ideally as a thought in some mind.  Thus the birth of a \"species\" can only be compared metaphorically, and very imperfectly, with that of an \"individual.\"  Individuals as _individuals_, actually and directly produce and bring forth other individuals; but no \"congeries of characters\" no \"common nature\" _as such_, can directly bring forth another \"common nature,\" because, _per se_, it has no existence (other than ideal) apart from the individuals in which it is manifested.  The problem then is, \"by what combination of natural laws does a new 'common nature' appear upon the scene of realized existence?\" _i.e._ how is an individual embodying such new characters produced?  For the approximation we have of late made towards the solution of this problem, we are mainly indebted to the invaluable labours and active brains of Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace.  Nevertheless, important as has been the impulse and direction given by those writers to both our observations and speculations, the solution will not (if the views here advocated are correct) ultimately present that aspect and character with which it has issued from the hands of those writers.  Neither, most certainly, will that solution agree in appearance or substance with the more or less crude conceptions which have been put forth by most of the opponents of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace. [Page 3]  Rather, judging from the more recent manifestations of thought on opposite sides, we may expect the development of some _tertium quid_--the resultant of forces coming from different quarters, and not coinciding in direction with any one of them.  As error is almost always partial truth, and so consists in the exaggeration or distortion of one verity by the suppression of another which qualifies and modifies the former, we may hope, by the synthesis of the truths contended for by various advocates, to arrive at the one conciliating reality.  Signs of this conciliation are not wanting: opposite scientific views, opposite philosophical conceptions, and opposite religious beliefs, are rapidly tending by their vigorous conflict to evolve such a systematic and comprehensive view of the genesis of species as will completely harmonize with the teachings of science, philosophy, and religion.  To endeavour to add one stone to this temple of concord, to try and remove a few of the misconceptions and mutual misunderstandings which oppose harmonious action, is the aim and endeavour of the present work. This aim it is hoped to attain, not by shirking difficulties, but analysing them, and by endeavouring to dig down to the common root which supports and unites diverging stems of truth.  It cannot but be a gain when the labourers in the three fields above mentioned, namely, science, philosophy, and religion, shall fully recognize this harmony. Then the energy too often spent in futile controversy, or withheld through prejudice, may be profitably and reciprocally exercised for the mutual benefit of all.  Remarkable is the rapidity with which an interest in the question of specific origination has spread. But a few years ago it scarcely occupied the minds of any but naturalists. Then the crude theory put forth by Lamarck, and by his English interpreter the author of the \"Vestiges of Creation,\" had rather discredited than helped on a belief in organic evolution--a belief, that is, in new kinds being produced from older    {4} ones by the ordinary and constant operation of natural laws. Now, however, this belief is widely diffused. Indeed, there are few drawing-rooms where it is not the subject of occasional discussion, and artisans and schoolboys have their views as to the permanence of organic forms. Moreover, the reception of this doctrine tends actually, though by no means necessarily, to be accompanied by certain beliefs with regard to quite distinct and very momentous subject-matter. So that the question of the \"Genesis of Species\" is not only one of great interest, but also of much importance.  But though the calm and thorough consideration of this matter is at the present moment exceedingly desirable, yet the actual importance of the question itself as to its consequences in the domain of theology has been strangely exaggerated by many, both of its opponents and supporters. This is especially the case with that form of the evolution theory which is associated with the name of Mr. Darwin; and"]]]
