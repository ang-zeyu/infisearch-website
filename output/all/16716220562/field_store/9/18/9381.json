Lucienne is yours, Madame, for was it not your beneficence which gave it to me? All I possess has come to me through the royal family. I have too much loyalty to forget it.\"  But negro Zamor became a citizen like Mirabeau. It was Zamor who took to Du Barry her lover's head. It was Zamor who denounced her at the club of the Jacobins. \"The fealty (faith) of the black man is white,\" said the negro. But he learned how to make it red. Jeanne was imprisoned and tried before Dumas.  \"Your age?\"  \"Forty-two years.\" She was really forty-seven. Coquetry even at the guillotine.  The public accuser, Fouquier Tinville, was not disarmed by the sweet voluptuousness still possessed by this pale and already fading beauty. He accused her of treason against the nation. Could the defender of Du Barry, who had also defended Marie Antoinette, find an eloquent word? No; Fouquier Tinville was more eloquent than Chauveau-Lagarde. So the mistress of Louis was condemned. It was eleven o'clock in the evening--the hour for supper at Versailles when she was queen!  She passed the night in prayer and weeping, or rather in a frenzy of fright. In the morning she said it was \"too early to die\"; she wished to have a little time in order to make some disclosures. The Comité sent someone to listen to her. What did she say? She revealed all that was hidden away at Lucienne; she gave word by word an inventory of the treasures she had concealed, forgetting nothing, for did not each word give her a second of time?  \"Have you finished?\" said the inquisitor. \"No,\" said Jeanne. \"I have not mentioned a silver syringe concealed under the staircase!\"  Meanwhile the horses of destiny stamped with impatience, and spectators were knocking at the prison gate. When they put her, already half dead, on the little cart, she bent her head and grew pale. The Du Barry alone--a sinner without redemption.  She saw the people in the square of Louis XV; she struck her breast three times and murmured: \"It is my fault!\" But this Christian resignation abandoned her when she mounted the scaffold--there where the statue of Louis XV had been--and she implored of the executioner:  \"One moment, Mr. Executioner! One moment more!\"  But the executioner was pitiless Sanson. It was block and the knife--without the \"one moment!\"  Such was the last bed of the Du Barry. Had the almanac of Liège only predicted to her that the one who would lead her to her bed for the last time would not be a King but a citizen executioner, it might have been--but why moralize?  Robert Arnot _To the Reader_  _As the early part of Madame du Barry's career had little to differentiate it from the life of an ordinary courtezan, the editor has deemed it best to confine the memoirs to the years in her life which helped to make history._  _--Editor*_       *\"Editor\" here means the author, who is assuming      the persona of the editor of the Comtesse's memoirs.    CHAPTER I   Letter from Lebel--Visit from Lebel--Nothing conclusive--Another visit from Lebel--Invitation to sup with the king--Instructions of the comte Jean to the comtesse  One morning comte Jean entered my apartment, his face beaming with delight.  \"Read,\" said he, giving me a letter, \"read, Jeannette: victory is ours. News from Morand. Lebel is coming to Paris, and will dine with us. Are we alone?\"  \"No, there are two of your countrymen whom you invited yesterday.\"  \"I will write and put them off. Morand alone must dine with Lebel; he ought to have a place at the feast which he furnishes with such good music. Come, my dear girl, we touch the moment of importance, it is in your beauty and power of pleasing that I place all my hopes. I think I may rely on you; but, above all, do not forget that you are my sister-in-law.\"  \"Brother-in-law,\" said I, laughing, \"it is not unnecessary that I should know decidedly to which of family I am married? The custom in France is not that a woman be the undivided property of three brothers.\"  \"That only happens in Venice,\" replied the comte; \"my brother Elie is too young, you must be the wife of Guillaume, my second brother.\"  \"Very well; I am the comtesse Guillaume du Barry; that does famously well; we like to know whom we are married to.\"  After this conversation, comte Jean insisted on presiding at my toilette. He acquitted himself of the task, with a most laughable attention. During two good hours, at least, he tormented first Henriette, and then the female hairdresser, for I had not yet followed the mode, which began to be very general, of having my hair dressed by a man. Comte Jean passed alternately from my dressing-room to the kitchen. He knew Lebel was a gallant and a gourmand*, and he was anxious to please him in all senses at once.        *He seems to mean \"gourmet\" rather than \"gourmand.\"       --Transcriber  At one o'clock I was under arms, and prepared to receive him on whom my destiny depended. As soon as I reached the drawing-room, comte Jean compelled me to submit to the test of a rigid examination.  His serious air amused me much as he gazed at me some time in solemn silence. At length his forehead relaxed, a smile of satisfaction played on his lips, and extending his arms to me, without venturing to touch me, \"You are charming, divine,\" he said; \"Lebel ought to go and hang himself if he does not fall down at your knees.\"  Soon afterwards the folding-doors were hastily opened, and a servant announced M. Lebel, _premier de sa Majesté_, with M. Morand. The comte went to meet the arrivals, and as I now saw Lebel for the first time, he presented him to me formally.  \"Sister, this is M. Lebel, _premier de sa Majesté _, who has done us the honor to come and dine with us.\"  \"And he confers a real pleasure on us,\" said I, looking smilingly on M. Lebel. My look had its effect, for Lebel remained mute and motionless from admiration at my person. At length he stammered out a few incoherent words, which I imagined to be compliments. The comte watched Lebel anxiously, and Morand began to rub his hands, saying:  \"Well, sir, what think you of our celestial beauty?\"  \"She is worthy of a throne,\" replied Lebel, bending his head before me, and taking my hand, which he pressed respectfully to his lips. This reply was, perhaps, inadvertently made, but I took it as a good augury. \"Yes,\" added Lebel, \"you are the most lovely creature I ever met, though no one is more in the habit of seeing handsome females than myself.\"  \"And of causing them to be seen by others,\" replied comte Jean.  This was an opening which was not followed up by Lebel. His first enthusiasm having passed, he measured me from head to foot, as if he would take an accurate description of my person.  For my part I began to support the looks of Lebel with more assurance. He was a man of no particular \"mark or likelihood,\" but had made his way. Living at Versailles had given him a certain air of easy impertinence, but you could not discover anything distinguished in his manners, nothing which concealed his humble extraction. The direction of the _Parc aux Cerfs_ gave him much influence with the king, who found the convenience of such a man, who was willing to take upon himself all the disagreeable part of his clandestine amours. His duties placed him in contact with the ministers, the lieutenant of police, and the comptroller-general. The highest nobility sought his friendship with avidity. They all had a wife, a sister, a daughter, whom they wished to make the favorite sultana; and for this it was necessary to get the ear of Lebel. Thus, under a libertine prince, the destinies of France were at the mercy of a _valet de chambre_.  I should tell you, however, that I never had occasion but to speak well of him, and that I have the utmost gratitude for all he did for me. The attachment he testified on our first meeting has never been altered. He gave me his protection as far as it was necessary for me, and when the favor of the king had accorded to me a station, whence all the court sought to hurl me, Lebel seconded me with all his power in my efforts to preserve it. I will say, that it is to his vigilance that I owe the overthrow of more than one conspiracy against me. He was a warm and sincere friend, and not at all interested in the services he rendered. He did a great deal of good, as well as harm, in private. I know poor families whom he has assisted with his own purse, when he could obtain nothing for them from the king, for Louis was only prodigal in his pleasures.  However, we dined, and Lebel praised me incessantly to the very skies, and that with so much warmth, that I was fearful at one time he would fall in love with me himself, and would not resign me to another. Thank heaven, Lebel was a faithful servant.  After dinner, when we left the table, Lebel paid me some compliments; then pulling out his watch, he spoke of an appointment at the Marais, and left without saying a word of seeing us again.  At this abrupt departure, comte Jean and I looked at each other with astonishment. As for Morand, he was overjoyed.  \"Well, comtesse,\" said he, \"behold the number of your slaves increased by an illustrious adorer. You have made a conquest of M. Lebel, and I am certain he has gone away deeply smitten.\"  \"I hope we shall see him again,\" said comte Jean.  \"Do you doubt it?\"  \"Assure him,\" said I, \"of the pleasure it will afford us to receive him as he merits.\"  Several persons entered, and M. Morand, profiting by the bustle which their entrance occasioned, approached me, and said, in a low tone,  \"You are in possession of his heart, will you charge me with any message to him?\"  \"M. Morand,\" was my reply, \"what are you thinking of? A woman of my rank throw herself at any person's head?\"  \"No, certainly not; but you can send him a kind word, or some affectionate token.\"  \"I could not think of it; M. Lebel appeared to me a most agreeable man, and I shall be at all times delighted to see him.\"  Morand asked nothing more than this, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],["title","Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#4)"],["body"," our conversation ended.  Two days elapsed without being marked by any event. Comte Jean had spent them with much anxiety. He was absent, when, on the third morning, Henriette came hastily into my room. \"Madame,\" she said, \"the _valet de chambre_ of the king is in the drawing-room, and inquires if you will receive him.\"  At this news I was surprised and vexed. M. Lebel took me unawares; my toilette was not begun. I gave a hasty glance at my mirror, \"Let M. Lebel come in\"; and M. Lebel, who was on the heels of my maid, entered instantly. After having saluted me, he said,  \"It is only you, Madame, whom one might thus surprise. Your beauty needs no ornament, your charms are decoration sufficient.\"  I replied to this compliment with (of course) much modesty, according to custom. We entered into conversation, and I found that Lebel really thought me the sister-in-law of comte Jean; and I remarked the involuntary respect that attended even his familiarity. I left him in his error, which was material to my interests. He talked to me some time of my attractions, of the part which a female like myself might assume in France. But fearing to compromise myself, I made no reply, but preserved the reserve which my character imposed upon me. I am not clever, my friend, I never could conduct an intrigue: I feared to speak or do wrong; and whilst I kept a tranquil appearance, I was internally agitated at the absence of comte Jean.  Fortune sent him to me. He was passing the street, when he saw at our door a carriage with the royal livery. Lebel always used it when his affairs did not demand a positive incognito. This equipage made him suspect a visit from Lebel, and he came in opportunely to extricate me from my embarrassment.  \"Sir,\" said Lebel to him, when he entered, \"here is the lady whose extreme modesty refuses to listen to what I dare not thus explain to her.\"  \"Is it anything I may hear for her?\" said the comte, with a smiling air.  \"Yes, I am the ambassador of a mighty power: you are the minister plenipotentiary of the lady, and with your leave, we will go into your private room to discuss the articles of the secret treaty which I have been charged to propose to you. What says madame?\"  \"I consent to anything that may come from such an ambassador.\"  Comte Jean instantly led him into another room, and when they were alone, Lebel said to him, \"Do you know that your sister-in-law is a most fascinating creature? She has occupied my thoughts since I have known her, and in my enthusiasm I could not help speaking of her in a certain quarter. So highly have I eulogized her, that his majesty desires an interview with her, that he may judge with his own eyes if I am an appreciator of beauty.\"  At these words comte Jean felt a momentary agitation, but soon recovering himself, he replied:  \"I am exceedingly obliged to you, sir, for the favorable disposition you have evinced towards the comtesse du Barry. She and I have as much respect as love for his majesty; but my sister-in-law has not been presented, and, consequently, I can scarcely see how she can be allowed to pay her respects to his majesty.\"  \"Do not let that disturb you; it is not intended that she shall go and partake of the magnificence of Versailles, but be admitted to an intimacy much more flattering. Would you refuse to grant him that pleasure?\"  \"It would be a crime of _lèse-majesté _,\" said the comte Jean, laughing, \"and my family have too much respect for their monarch. We should not be content with a fugitive favor.\"  \"You may expect everything from the charms of the comtesse; I am certain they will have the utmost success; but for me, I can give you no guarantee. You must run the chance.\"  \"Your protection, however, is the only thing which encourages my sister-in-law in this affair. But tell me when is this meeting to take place?\"  \"Instantly. The king is impatient to see the comtesse and I have promised that she will sup with him to-morrow evening in my apartment at Versailles.\"  \"How is she to be introduced to the king?\"  \"I am to entertain four of my friends.\"  \"Who are they?\"  \"'First, the baron de Gonesse.\"  \"Who is he?\"  \"The king himself.\"  \"Well, who next?\"  \"The duc de Richelieu.\"  \"Who else?\"  \"The marquis de Chauvelin.\"  \"Well?\"  \"The duc de la Vauguyon.\"  \"What, the devotee?\"  \"The hypocrite. But never mind: the main point is, that you must not appear to recognize the king. Instruct your sister-in-law to this effect.\"  \"Certainly; if she must sin, she had better do so with some reason.\"  While these gentlemen were thus disposing of me, what was I doing? Alone, in my room, I waited the result of their conference with mortal impatience. The character I had to play was a superb one, and at the moment was about to enter on the stage, I felt all the difficulties of my part. I feared I should not succeed, but fail amid the insulting hisses of the Versailles party.  My fears at once disappeared, and then I pictured myself sitting on a throne, magnificently attired; my imagination wandered in all the enchantments of greatness;--then, as if from remorse, I recalled my past life. The former lover of Nicholas blushed before the future mistress of Louis XV. A thousand different reflections crowded upon me, and mingled in my brain. If to live is to think, I lived a whole age in one quarter of an hour. At length I heard some doors open, a carriage rolled away, and comte Jean entered my chamber.  \"Victory!\" cried he, embracing me with transport. \"Victory! my dear Jeanne, to-morrow you sup with the king.\"  On this information I turned pale, my strength forsook me, and I was compelled to sit down, or rather to fall into a chair; for, according to Jean Jacques Rousseau, my legs shook under me (_flageolaient_). This, however, was the only movement of weakness which I betrayed. When I recovered a little, the comte Jean told me the conversation he had had with Lebel. I joked about the title of baron de Gonesse, and I promised to treat the king as if ignorant of his incognito. One thing only made me uneasy, and that was supping with the duc de Richelieu, who had seen me before at madame de Lagarde's; but the idea that he would not remember me gave me renewed courage.  On so important an occasion, comte Jean did not forget to repeat his instructions over again. These are nearly his words, for I think I learnt them by heart.  \"Remember that it is on your first interview that your safety depends. Let him learn, through you, those utter tendernesses which have been sought for him in vain heretofore. He is like the monarch of old, who was willing to pay the half of his crown for an unknown pleasure. Lebel is wearied in seeking every week for new fruit. He is quite disposed to serve you, and will second you in the best manner. You are about to become the centre of attraction to all courtiers, and noble _courtisanes_. You must expect that they will endeavor to cry you down, because you will have carried off from them a gem to which every family has its pretensions. You must at first stand firmly before the storm, but afterward you will find all enlist themselves under your banner, who have no wife, sister, nor daughter; that is, all who have no mistress to offer to the king. You must attach these to you by place and favor: they must be first thought of, and then you must think of yourself and me, my dear girl.\"  \"All this is well enough,\" I replied, \"but as yet I am nothing.\"  \"_Morbleu_! to-morrow you will be everything,\" cried comte Jean, with his determined energy. \"But we must think about this morrow. Make haste, noble comtesse; go to all the milliners, seek what is elegant rather than what is rich. Be as lovely, pleasing, and gay as possible; this is the main point, and God will do all the rest.\"  He pronounced this blasphemy in a laughing tone, and I confess I could not help joining in the laugh, and then hastened to comply with his directions.    CHAPTER II   A slight preface--Arrival at Versailles--_\"La toilette\"_--Portrait of the king--The duc de Richelieu--The marquis de Chauvelin--The duc de la Vauguyon-Supper with the king--The first night--The following day--The curiosity of comte Jean--Presents from the king--How disposed of  The chances against our succeeding in our enterprise were at least a thousand to one. The sea upon which, trusting to the favorable influence of my leading star, we were about to venture, was filled with rocks and shoals which threatened the poor mariner who should direct his bark near them. In the first place, I had to dread my obscure birth, as well as the manner in which my life had been passed; and still more had I to fear the indifferent reputation of comte Jean. There was more than sufficient in all this to disturb a head far stronger than I could boast. However, thanks to my thoughtfulness, no troublesome thoughts interfered to break my rest on the night preceding a day so important to me, and I slept as tranquilly as though upon waking I had no other occupation for my time than a walk on the boulevards, or a drive to the Bois de Boulogne.  Comte Jean, however, had passed a very different night; for once, the whisperings of ambition had overcome even his natural indifference and carelessness, and tired of tossing upon a sleepless pillow, he arose at the first break of day, reproached me for slumbering so long, and allowed me neither peace nor rest till I joined him dressed for our journey. At length, we set out according to our agreement with Lebel; I was closely muffled up in my large _calèche_--the carriage rolled along till we reached Versailles, where we had for the last month engaged a lodging, which might be useful to us in all events; we alighted, and after vainly seeking a few moments' repose, proceeded on foot to Lebel, in whose apartments we were to attire ourselves in a suitable manner.  \"You are welcome,\" said the comte, \"pray consider yourself as at home.\"  \"I accept your augury,\" replied I, \"it would be amusing enough"]]]
