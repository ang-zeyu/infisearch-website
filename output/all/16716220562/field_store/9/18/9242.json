Here was the cradle in which Leverett babies had been rocked, an old bit of mahogany nearly black with age.  \"How funny!\" cried Cynthia, springing into it, and making a clatter on the floor.  \"Don't, dear! Miss Elizabeth may not like it,\" said Miss Winn.  \"As if I should hurt it!\" indignantly.  \"It is not ours.\"  \"But we sit on their chairs, and sleep in their beds, and eat at their table,\" returned the child. \"Do you suppose they do not want us?\"  \"Our coming is Mr. Leverett's affair, and he is your guardian, so whatever home he provides is right.\"  \"Well, we can have a home of our own when father comes?\"  \"Oh, yes; when he comes.\"  \"Well, then I shall not mind;\" decisively.  Still she peered about among the old things. There were some iron fire-dogs, a much-tarnished frame, with a cracked glass that cut her face in a grotesque fashion, old dishes and kitchen furniture past using, or that had been supplanted by a newer and better kind.  \"Oh, dear! this is an undertaking!\" declared Miss Winn, with a sigh. \"I do not believe you will ever use half these things; there are stuffs enough to dress a queen.\"  It was beginning to grow dusky before she was through, though the sky was overcast, and there would be no fine sunset. Indeed, the wind blew up stormily. Cynthia had been viewing the place from the windows in the four gables, though she had to stand on a box. There were South River and the Neck and the shipping--the men, hurrying to and fro, looking so much smaller that it puzzled Cynthia. And there was North River winding about, and over beyond the great ocean she had crossed. There was old St. Peter's Church, the new one was not built until long afterward, and smaller places of worship. There was the small beginning of things to be famous later on.  The wind began to whistle about and it grew cool, so they were glad to go down to the cheerful sitting-room, where a fire was blazing on the hearth.  \"We shall have a storm to-night,\" said Miss Eunice, \"our three days' storm that usually makes its appearance about this time. Didn't you 'most perish upstairs? And what did you find to interest you?\"  Cynthia had brought a stool and sat close to Miss Eunice, leaning one arm on her knee.  \"Oh, so many queer things. You don't mind if I call them queer, do you?\"  \"Oh, no; they _are_ queer. And when we are dead and gone some one will call ours queer, no doubt. But we haven't many. When father died we were on a farm just out of Marblehead. Things were mostly sold at a vendue, for the two boys were going in the army. That was back in '78. Mother and we two girls went to her mother's at Danvers. Elizabeth took up sewing, but there were hard times, for the war stretched out so long, and it did seem as if the Colonies would never gain their cause. But they did. Brother Linus was killed, and later on I had a dear friend lost at sea. Mother died, and we were sort of scattered about till we came here. Cousin Chilian was very good to us. So you see we haven't much to leave, but then we haven't any descendant;\" and she gave a soft little laugh. \"Elizabeth has mother's gold comb, set with amethysts, and a brooch, and I have the string of gold beads and some rings. A cousin in London sent them to grandmother.\"  \"Eunice, you might set the table,\" said Elizabeth, rather sharply. \"I'm making some fritters. They will taste good this cold night.\"  \"Couldn't I help?\" asked Rachel.  \"Oh, you must be tired enough without doing any more. It's a good thing you have all your belongings housed. The garret doesn't leak.\"  \"Yes, I am thankful. I really did not think there was so much.\"  There was a savory fragrance in the sitting-room. Chilian came in, looking weary with his long ride.  \"It is almost wintry cold,\" he said, holding his hands to the fire. \"Have you had a nice day, little girl?\"  \"Yes;\" glancing up with a smile.  They did justice to Bessy's nice supper. Chilian had seen Cousin Giles, who sent remembrances to them all, and was coming up some day to see Letty Orne's little girl. Chilian found there was a good deal of business to do. For a while his days of leisure and ease would be over.  Then he brought out a Boston paper and read them some of the news. Miss Eunice went on with her fringe. Elizabeth was knitting a sock for Chilian out of fine linen yarn, spun by herself, and she put pretty open-work stitches all up the instep. For imported articles were still dear, and there was a pride in the women to do all for themselves that they could. Cynthia leaned her head on Rachel's lap and went asleep.  \"Do hear that rain! The storm has begun in good earnest.\"  It was rushing like a tramp of soldiers, flinging great sheets against the closed shutters, and the wind roared in the chimney like some prisoned spirit.  \"Wake up, Cynthia, and say good-night.\"  Elizabeth watched the child. Her theory was that children should be put to bed early and not allowed to lie around on any one's lap. There was always a tussle of wills when you roused them. She drew herself up with a kind of severe mental bracing and awaited the result, glad Chilian was there.  Rachel toyed with the hair, patted the soft flushed cheek, and took the hands in hers.  \"Cynthia,\" she said gently, \"Cynthia, dear, wake up.\"  The child roused, opened her eyes. \"I'm so tired,\" she murmured. \"Will we never be done crossing the wide, wide ocean? And where is Salem?\"  \"We are there, dear, safe and housed from the storm. You have been asleep on my knee. Come to bed now. Say good-night.\"  She stood the little girl up on her feet and put one arm around her.  It was against Elizabeth Leverett's theories that any child should go off peaceably, with no snarling protest. Chilian raised his book a little, hoping in the depths of his soul there would be no scene.  \"Say good-night.\"  No child of Puritan training, with the fear of the rod before her eyes, could have done better. She said good-night in a very sleepy tone, and slipped her arm about Rachel's waist as they left the room together.  No one made any comment at first. Then Eunice said, in what she made a casual tone:  \"She seems a very tractable child.\"  \"You can't tell by one instance. Children of that age are always self-willed. And allowing a child to lie around one's lap, when she should have said her prayers and gone to bed at the proper hour, is a most reprehensible habit. And I don't suppose she ever says a prayer.\"  Eunice thought of the daily prayers for her father's safe journey. Would that be set down as a sort of idolatry?  Chilian picked up his papers; he had grown fastidious, and rarely left his belongings about to annoy Elizabeth. Eunice rolled up her work and dropped it in the bag that hung on the post of her chair, straightened up a few things, stood the logs in the corner and put up the wire fender, so there should be no danger of fire; while Elizabeth set all things straight in the kitchen.  Cynthia meanwhile was undressed and mounted the steps to the high bed. Then she flung her arms about Rachel's neck.  \"Oh, come and sleep in my bed to-night!\" she cried pleadingly. \"It's so big and lonesome, that I am afraid. I wish it was like your little bed. They were so cunning on the ship. I don't like this one, where you have to go upstairs to get in it. Oh, do come!\"  And Elizabeth Leverett would have been shocked if she could have seen the child cuddled up in her attendant's arms. Theoretically, she believed Holy Writ--\"He hath made of one blood all nations.\" Practically she made many exceptions.     CHAPTER V  MAKING FRIENDS WITH THE LITTLE GIRL   The northeast storm was terrific. The wind lashed the ocean until it writhed and groaned and sent great billows up on the land. The trees bent to the fierce blasts; many storms had toughened them and perhaps taught them the wisdom of yielding, since it must be break or bend. Silas sat in the barn mending tools and harness and clearing up generally; Elizabeth spent most of the first day clearing up the garret again, and looking with a grudging eye on the new accession of boxes, and sniffing up the queer smell disdainfully.  \"One can't have the windows open,\" she ruminated, \"and the smell must go through the house. I don't believe it will ever get out.\"  More than one family in Salem had stores from the Orient. Many of them liked the fragrance of sandalwood and strange perfumes. \"God's fresh air was good enough for her,\" said Elizabeth.  Eunice had finished her fringe and brought out some patchwork in the afternoon--a curious pattern, called basket-work. The basket was made of green chintz, with a small yellow figure here and there. It had a handle from side to side, neatly hemmed on a white half square. The upper edge of the basket was cut in points and between each one was a bit of color to represent or suggest a possible bud of some kind. One had pink, different shades of red, and a bright yellow. She had seven blocks finished and they were in the bottom of the box. Eunice took them out for the little girl, who spread them on the floor.  No one was thinking at that day of the mills that would dot New England, where cotton cloths, calicoes, and cambrics would be turned out by the bale. These things had to be imported and were costly. One could dye plain colors that were used for frocks and gowns, and some of the hand looms wove ginghams that were dyed in the thread beforehand.  \"It will take forty-two blocks,\" said Miss Eunice. \"Six one way, seven the other.\"  \"Then what are you going to do with it?\" asked the child eagerly.  \"Why, quilt it. Put some cotton between this and the lining, and sew them together with fine stitches.\"  \"And then----\"  \"Why\"--Eunice wondered herself. There were chests of them piled away in the garret--Chilian's mother's, and those they had made to fill in the moments when housework was finished. She had a quiet sense of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20726"],["title","A Slave is a Slave (#0)"],["body","SLAVE IS A SLAVE  BY H.

Could it possibly have been misplaced...?   Jurgen, Prince Trevannion, accepted the coffee cup and lifted it to his lips, then lowered it. These Navy robots always poured coffee too hot; spacemen must have collapsium-lined throats. With the other hand, he punched a button on the robot's keyboard and received a lighted cigarette; turning, he placed the cup on the command-desk in front of him and looked about. The tension was relaxing in Battle-Control, the purposeful pandemonium of the last three hours dying rapidly. Officers of both sexes, in red and blue and yellow and green coveralls, were rising from seats, leaving their stations, gathering in groups. Laughter, a trifle loud; he realized, suddenly, that they had been worried, and wondered if he should not have been a little so himself. No. There would have been nothing he could have done about anything, so worry would not have been useful. He lifted the cup again and sipped cautiously.  \"That's everything we can do now,\" the man beside him said. \"Now we just sit and wait for the next move.\"  Like all the others, Line-Commodore Vann Shatrak wore shipboard battle-dress; his coveralls were black, splashed on breast and between shoulders with the gold insignia of his rank. His head was completely bald, and almost spherical; a beaklike nose carried down the curve of his brow, and the straight lines of mouth and chin chopped under it enhanced rather than spoiled the effect. He was getting coffee; he gulped it at once.  \"It was very smart work, Commodore. I never saw a landing operation go so smoothly.\"  \"Too smooth,\" Shatrak said. \"I don't trust it.\" He looked suspiciously up at the row of viewscreens.  \"It was absolutely unnecessary!\"  That was young Obray, Count Erskyll, seated on the commodore's left. He was a generation younger than Prince Trevannion, as Shatrak was a generation older; they were both smooth-faced. It was odd, how beards went in and out of fashion with alternate generations. He had been worried, too, during the landing, but for a different reason from the others. Now he was reacting with anger.  \"I told you, from the first, that it was unnecessary. You see? They weren't even able to defend themselves, let alone....\"  His personal communication-screen buzzed; he set down the coffee and flicked the switch. It was Lanze Degbrend. On the books, Lanze was carried as Assistant to the Ministerial Secretary. In practice, Lanze was his chess-opponent, conversational foil, right hand, third eye and ear, and, sometimes, trigger-finger. Lanze was now wearing the combat coveralls of an officer of Navy Landing-Troops; he had a steel helmet with a transpex visor shoved up, and there was a carbine slung over his shoulder. He grinned and executed an exaggeratedly military salute. He chuckled.  \"Well, look at you; aren't you the perfect picture of correct diplomatic dress?\"  \"You know, sir, I'm afraid I am, for this planet,\" Degbrend said. \"Colonel Ravney insisted on it. He says the situation downstairs is still fluid, which I take to mean that everybody is shooting at everybody. He says he has the main telecast station, in the big building the locals call the Citadel.\"  \"Oh, good. Get our announcement out as quickly as you can. Number Five. You and Colonel Ravney can decide what interpolations are needed to fit the situation.\"  \"Number Five; the really tough one,\" Degbrend considered. \"I take it that by interpolations you do not mean dilutions?\"  \"Oh, no; don't water the drink. Spike it.\"  Lanze Degbrend grinned at him. Then he snapped down the visor of his helmet, unslung his carbine, and presented it. He was still standing at present arms when Trevannion blanked the screen.         *       *       *       *       *  \"That still doesn't excuse a wanton and unprovoked aggression!\" Erskyll was telling Shatrak, his thin face flushed and his voice quivering with indignation. \"We came here to help these people, not to murder them.\"  \"We didn't come here to do either, Obray,\" he said, turning to face the younger man. \"We came here to annex their planet to the Galactic Empire, whether they wish it annexed or not. Commodore Shatrak used the quickest and most effective method of doing that. It would have done no good to attempt to parley with them from off-planet. You heard those telecasts of theirs.\"  \"Authoritarian,\" Shatrak said, then mimicked pompously: \"'Everybody is commanded to remain calm; the Mastership is taking action. The Convocation of the Lords-Master is in special session; they will decide how to deal with the invaders. The administrators are directed to reassure the supervisors; the overseers will keep the workers at their tasks. Any person disobeying the orders of the Mastership will be dealt with most severely.'\"  \"Static, too. No spaceships into this system for the last five hundred years; the Convocation--equals Parliament, I assume--hasn't been in special session for two hundred and fifty.\"  \"Yes. I've taken over planets with that kind of government before,\" Shatrak said. \"You can't argue with them. You just grab them by the center of authority, quick and hard.\"  Count Erskyll said nothing for a moment. He was opposed to the use of force. Force, he believed, was the last resort of incompetence; he had said so frequently enough since this operation had begun. Of course, he was absolutely right, though not in the way he meant. Only the incompetent wait until the last extremity to use force, and by then, it is usually too late to use anything, even prayer.  But, at the same time, he was opposed to authoritarianism, except, of course, when necessary for the real good of the people. And he did not like rulers who called themselves Lords-Master. Good democratic rulers called themselves Servants of the People. So he relapsed into silence and stared at the viewscreens.  One, from an outside pickup on the _Empress Eulalie_ herself, showed the surface of the planet, a hundred miles down, the continent under them curving away to a distant sun-reflecting sea; beyond the curved horizon, the black sky was spangled with unwinking stars. Fifty miles down, the sun glinted from the three thousand foot globes of the two transport-cruisers, _Canopus_ and _Mizar_.  Another screen, from _Mizar_, gave a clearer if more circumscribed view of the surface--green countryside, veined by rivers and wrinkled with mountains; little towns that were mere dots; a scatter of white clouds. Nothing that looked like roads. There had been no native sapient race on this planet, and in the thirteen centuries since it had been colonized the Terro-human population had never completely lost the use of contragravity vehicles. In that screen, farther down, the four destroyers, _Irma_, _Irene_, _Isobel_ and _Iris_, were tiny twinkles.         *       *       *       *       *  From _Irene_, they had a magnified view of the city. On the maps, none later than eight hundred years old, it was called Zeggensburg; it had been built at the time of the first colonization under the old Terran Federation. Tall buildings, rising from wide interspaces of lawns and parks and gardens, and, at the very center, widely separated from anything else, the mass of the Citadel, a huge cylindrical tower rising from a cluster of smaller cylinders, with a broad circular landing stage above, topped by the newly raised flag of the Galactic Empire.  There was a second city, a thick crescent, to the south and east. The old maps placed the Zeggensburg spaceport there, but not a trace of that remained. In its place was what was evidently an industrial district, located where the prevailing winds would carry away the dust and smoke. There was quite a bit of both, but the surprising thing was the streets, long curved ones, and shorter ones crossing at regular intervals to form blocks. He had never seen a city with streets before, and he doubted if anybody else on the Empire ships had. Long boulevards to give unobstructed passage to low-level air-traffic, of course, and short winding walkways, but not things like these. Pictures, of course, of native cities on planets colonized at the time of the Federation, and even very ancient ones of cities on pre-Atomic Terra. But these people had contragravity; the towering, wide-spaced city beside this cross-gridded anachronism proved that.  They knew so little about this planet which they had come to bring under Imperial rule. It had been colonized thirteen centuries ago, during the last burst of expansion before the System States War and the disintegration of the Terran Federation, and it had been named Aditya, in the fashion of the times, for some forgotten deity of some obscure and ancient polytheism. A century or so later, it had seceded from or been abandoned by the Federation, then breaking up. That much they had gleaned from old Federation records still existing on Baldur. After that, darkness, lighted only by a brief flicker when more records had turned up on Morglay.  Morglay was one of the Sword-Worlds, settled by refugee rebels from the System States planets. Mostly they had been soldiers and spacemen; there had been many women with them, and many were skilled technicians, engineers, scientists. They had managed to carry off considerable equipment with them, and for"]]]
