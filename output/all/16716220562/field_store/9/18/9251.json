Men were straggling out of the administration building, lighting pipes and cigarettes; they all wore new but work-soiled infantry battle dress. All of them waved and shouted greetings; one, about Conn's own age, approached. As he got out, Conn saw the resemblance to Lester Dawes, the banker, before he recognized Anse Dawes, who had been one of his closest friends six years ago. They shook hands and pounded each other on the back.  \"Hey, you're looking great, Conn!\" They all told him that; he'd begin to believe it pretty soon. \"Sorry I couldn't make the party, but somebody had to sit on the lid here, and Jerry Rivas and I cut cards for it and Jerry won.\"  \"You didn't tell me Anse was with you,\" he reproached his father. Rodney Maxwell said he'd been saving that for a surprise.  When Conn asked Anse what was the matter with the bank, he said: \"For the birds; I'd as soon count sheets of toilet paper as this stuff we're using for money. Sooner. Toilet paper can be used for something, and this paper money's too stiff. Maybe some of this stuff we're digging here isn't worth much, but at least it's real.\"  That was something else the Maxwell Plan would have to take care of. Gresham's Law was running hog-wild on Poictesme. A Planetary Government sol was worth about ten centisols, Federation, and aside from deposit boxes, woolen socks under the mattress, and tin cans buried in the corner of the cellar, Federation currency was nonexistent.  \"Had breakfast yet?\" Rodney Maxwell asked.  \"Oh, hours ago. I was out and shot another spikenose; it's hanging up back of the kitchen, waiting for the cook to skin it and cut it up.\" He grinned at Conn. \"You don't get this kind of hunting in a bank, either.\"  \"Jerry still inside? I want to see him. Suppose you take Conn around and show him the sights. And don't worry about him bumping you out of a job. Worry about the six or eight extra jobs you'll have to do besides your own, from now on.\"  Conn and Anse crossed the yard and entered one of the office buildings, through a big breach in the wall. Anse said: \"I did that myself; 90-mm tank gun. When we want a wall out of the way, we get it out of the way.\" Inside were a lot of lifters and skids and power shovels and things; laborers were assembling for work assignments. Most of them had been with his father six years ago and he knew them. They hadn't done any growing up in the meantime. They climbed into an airjeep and floated out over the edge of the plateau, letting down past the sheer cliff to where the lower lateral shaft had been opened. A great deal of rock had been shoveled and bulldozed away to expose it; it was twenty feet high and forty wide. Anse simply steered the jeep inside and up the tunnel.  There were occasional lights on at the ceiling. Anse said they were all powered from their own nuclear-electric conversion units. \"We don't have the central power on here; there's a big mass-energy converter, but we're tearing it down to ship out.\"  That was something they could get a good price for. Maybe even one-tenth of what it was worth. At least they wouldn't have to sell it by the ton.  The tunnel ended in an enormous room a couple of hundred feet square and fifty high. There was a wide aisle up the middle; on either side, contragravity equipment was massed. Tanks with long 90-mm guns. Combat cars. Small airboats. Rank on rank of air-cavalry single-mounts, egg-shaped things just big enough for a man to sit in, with quadruple machine guns in front and flame-jets behind. Ambulances armored against radiation; decontamination units; mobile workshops; mobile kitchens. Troop carriers, jeeps, staff cars; power shovels, manipulators, lifters. All waiting, for forty years, to swarm out as soon as the bombs that never came stopped falling.  They floated the jeep along hallways beyond, and got down to look into rooms. Work was already going on in the power plant; a gang under a slim young man whom Anse introduced as Mohammed Matsui were using repair-robots to get canisters of live plutonium out of a reactor. Workshops. Laundries. Storerooms. Kitchens, some stripped and a few still intact. A hospital. Guardhouse and lockup.  More storerooms on the level above, reached by returning to the vehicle hangar and lifting to an upper entrance. By this time, gangs were at work there, too, moving contragravity skids in empty and out loaded.  \"The CO here must have had squirrel blood,\" Anse said. \"I think when the evacuation orders came through he just gathered up everything there was topside and crammed it down here, any old way. Honest to Ghu, this place was packed solid when we found it. Nobody'd believe it.\"  \"Wait till you see the next one.\"  \"You mean there's another place like this?\"  \"You can say so. You can say a twenty-megaton thermonuclear is like a hand grenade, too.\"  Anse Dawes simply didn't believe that.  When they got back to the Administration Building on top, they found Rodney Maxwell, Jerry Rivas, the general foremen, and half a dozen gang foremen, in consultation.  \"We're getting a hundred and fifty more men and ten farm scows from Litchfield,\" his father said. \"Dave McCade's coming out from our yard, and Tom Brangwyn's sending one of his deputies to help boss them. Well have to keep an eye on this crowd; they're all Tramptown hoodlums, but that's the best we can get. We're going to have to get this place cleaned out in a hurry. We only have about two weeks till the wine-pressing's over, and then we want to start the next operation. Conn, did you see all that engineering equipment, down on the bottom level?\"  \"Yes. I think we ought to leave a lot of that here--the shovels and bulldozers and manipulators and so on. We can move it direct to Force Command. How are we fixed for blasting explosives?\"  \"Name it and we have it. Cataclysmite, FJ-7, anything you want.\"  \"We'll need a lot of it.\"  \"We're going to have to get a ship. I mean a contragravity ship, a freighter; first, to move this stuff out of here, and then to move the stuff out of Force Command. And we want it mounted with heavy armament, too. We not only want a freighter, we want a fighting ship.\"  \"You think so?\"  \"I'm sure of it,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"Where we're going is full of outlaws; there must be hundreds of them holing up over there. That's where all the trouble on the east coast comes from. Now, outlaws are sure-thing players. They want to be alive to spend their loot, and they won't tackle anything that's too tough for them. A lot of guards and combat equipment may look like a loss on the books, but the books won't show how much of a loss you might take if you didn't have them. I want this operation armed till it'll be too much for all the outlaws on the planet to tackle.\"  That made sense. It also made sense out of the billions of sols the Federation had spent preparing for an invasion that never came. If it had come and found them unprepared, the loss might have been the war itself.  The scows and the newly hired workers began arriving a little after noon. The scows had been borrowed from plantations where the crop had been gotten in; there were melon leaves and bits of vine in the bottoms. The workers were a bleary-eyed and unsavory lot; Conn had a suspicion, which Brangwyn's deputy confirmed, that they had been collected by mass vagrancy arrests in Tramptown. As soon as they started arriving, Jerry Rivas hurried down to the old provost-marshal's headquarters and came back with a lot of rubber billy-clubs, which he issued to his gang-bosses, regular and temporary. A few times they had to be used. By evening, however, the insubordinate and troublesome had been quieted. They would all steal anything they could put in their pockets, but that was to be expected. By evening, too, the contents of the underground treasure trove was moving out in a steady stream, and scows were shuttling to and from Litchfield.  Rodney Maxwell was going back to town after lunch the next day. Conn wanted to know if he should go along.  \"No, you stay here; help keep things moving. Remember what I told you about the older and wiser heads? Let me handle them. I've been around them, heaven pity me, longer than you have. Just give me an audiovisual of your proxy and I'll vote your stock.\"  \"How much stock do I have, by the way?\"  \"The same as I have--ten thousand five hundred shares of common, at twenty centisols a share. But watch where it goes after we open Force Command.\"  His father was back, two days later, to report:  \"We're organized. Kurt Fawzi's president, of course, and does he love it. That'll keep him out of mischief. Dolf Kellton's secretary; he has an office force at the Academy and can conscript students to help. He's organizing a research team from his seniors and post-grad students to work in the Planetary Library at Storisende. There are a lot of old Third Force records there; he may find something useful. Of course, Lester Dawes is treasurer.\"  \"What are you?\"  \"Vice-president in charge of operations. That's what I spent all yesterday log-rolling, baby-kissing and cigar-passing to get.\"  \"And what am I, if it's a fair question?\"  \"You have a very distinguished position; you are a non-office-holding stockholder. The only other one is Judge Ledue; as a member of the judiciary, he did not feel it proper to accept official position in a private corporation. Tom Brangwyn's Chief of Company Police; Klem Fawzi is Commander of the Company Guards. And we have a law firm in Storisende lined up to handle our charter application. Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong. Sterber's married to Jake Vyckhoven's sister, Flynn's son is married to the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury, and Chen-Wong is a nephew of the Chief Justice. All of them are directly descended from members of Genji Gartner's original crew.\"  \"You don't anticipate any trouble about getting the charter?\"  \"Not exactly."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20728"],["title","Space Viking (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's note: This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact--Science Fiction November 1962, December 1962, January 1963, February 1963.

Beam Piper  Illustrated by Schoenherr  They stood together at the parapet, their arms about each other's waists, her head against his cheek. Behind, the broad leaved shrubbery gossiped softly with the wind, and from the lower main terrace came music and laughing voices. The city of Wardshaven spread in front of them, white buildings rising from the wide spaces of green treetops, under a shimmer of sun-reflecting aircars above. Far away, the mountains were violet in the afternoon haze, and the huge red sun hung in a sky as yellow as a ripe peach.  His eye caught a twinkle ten miles to the southwest, and for an instant he was puzzled. Then he frowned. The sunlight on the two thousand-foot globe of Duke Angus' new ship, the _Enterprise_, back at the Gorram shipyards after her final trial cruise. He didn't want to think about that, now.  Instead, he pressed the girl closer and whispered her name, \"Elaine,\" and then, caressing every syllable, \"Lady Elaine Trask of Traskon.\"  \"Oh, no, Lucas!\" Her protest was half joking and half apprehensive. \"It's bad luck to be called by your married name before the wedding.\"  \"I've been calling you that in my mind since the night of the Duke's ball, when you were just home from school on Excalibur.\"  She looked up from the corner of her eye.  \"That was when I started calling me that, too,\" she confessed.  \"There's a terrace to the west at Traskon New House,\" he told her. \"Tomorrow, we'll have our dinner there, and watch the sunset together.\"  \"I know. I thought that was to be our sunset-watching place.\"  \"You have been peeking,\" he accused. \"Traskon New House was to be your surprise.\"  \"I always was a present-peeker, New Year's and my birthdays. But I only saw it from the air. I'll be very surprised at everything inside,\" she promised. \"And very delighted.\"  And when she'd seen everything and Traskon New House wasn't a surprise any more, they'd take a long space trip. He hadn't mentioned that to her, yet. To some of the other Sword-Worlds--Excalibur, of course, and Morglay and Flamberge and Durendal. No, not Durendal; the war had started there again. But they'd have so much fun. And she would see clear blue skies again, and stars at night. The cloud-veil hid the stars from Gram, and Elaine had missed them, since coming home from Excalibur.  The shadow of an aircar fell briefly upon them and they looked up and turned their heads, in time to see it sink with graceful dignity toward the landing-stage of Karval House, and he glimpsed its blazonry--sword and atom-symbol, the badge of the ducal house of Ward. He wondered if it were Duke Angus himself, or just some of his people come ahead of him. They should get back to their guests, he supposed. Then he took her in his arms and kissed her, and she responded ardently. It must have been all of five minutes since they'd done that before.         *       *       *       *       *  A slight cough behind them brought them apart and their heads around. It was Sesar Karvall, gray-haired and portly, the breast of his blue coat gleaming with orders and decorations and the sapphire in the pommel of his dress-dagger twinkling.  \"I thought I'd find you two here,\" Elaine's father smiled. \"You'll have tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow together, but need I remind you that today we have guests, and more coming every minute.\"  \"Who came in the Ward car?\" Elaine asked.  \"Rovard Grauffis. And Otto Harkaman; you never met him, did you, Lucas?\"  \"No; not by introduction. I'd like to, before he spaces out.\" He had nothing against Harkaman personally; only against what he represented. \"Is the Duke coming?\"  \"Oh, surely. Lionel of Newhaven and the Lord of Northport are coming with him. They're at the Palace now.\" Karvall hesitated. \"His nephew's back in town.\"  Elaine was distressed; she started to say: \"Oh, dear! I hope he doesn't--\"  \"Has Dunnan been bothering Elaine again?\"  \"Nothing to take notice of. He was here, yesterday, demanding to speak with her. We got him to leave without too much unpleasantness.\"  \"It'll be something for me to take notice of, if he keeps it up after tomorrow.\"  For his seconds and Andray Dunnan's, that was; he hoped it wouldn't come to that. He didn't want to have to shoot a kinsman to the house of Ward, and a crazy man to boot.  \"I'm terribly sorry for him,\" Elaine was saying. \"Father, you should have let me talk to him. I might have made him understand.\"  Sesar Karvall was shocked. \"Child, you couldn't have subjected yourself to that! The man is insane!\" Then he saw her bare shoulders, and was even more shocked. \"Elaine, your shawl!\"  Her hands went up and couldn't find it; she looked about in confused embarrassment. Amused, Lucas picked it from the shrub onto which she had tossed it and draped it over her shoulders, his hands lingering briefly. Then he gestured to the older man to precede them, and they entered the arbored walk. At the other end, in an open circle, a fountain played; white marble girls and boys bathing in the jade-green basin. Another piece of loot from one of the Old Federation planets; that was something he'd tried to avoid in furnishing Traskon New House. There'd be a lot of that coming to Gram, after Otto Harkaman took the _Enterprise_ to space.  \"I'll have to come back, some time, and visit them,\" Elaine whispered to him. \"They'll miss me.\"  \"You'll find a lot of new friends at your new home,\" he whispered back. \"You wait till tomorrow.\"  \"I'm going to put a word in the Duke's ear about that fellow,\" Sesar Karvall, still thinking of Dunnan, was saying. \"If he speaks to him, maybe it'll do some good.\"  \"I doubt it. I don't think Duke Angus has any influence over him at all.\"  Dunnan's mother had been the Duke's younger sister; from his father he had inherited what had originally been a prosperous barony. Now it was mortgaged to the top of the manor-house aerial-mast. The Duke had once assumed Dunnan's debts, and refused to do so again. Dunnan had gone to space a few times, as a junior officer on trade-and-raid voyages into the Old Federation. He was supposed to be a fair astrogator. He had expected his uncle to give him command of the _Enterprise_, which had been ridiculous. Disappointed in that, he had recruited a mercenary company and was seeking military employment: It was suspected that he was in correspondence with his uncle's worst enemy, Duke Omfray of Glaspyth.  And he was obsessively in love with Elaine Karvall, a passion which seemed to nourish itself on its own hopelessness. Maybe it would be a good idea to take that space trip right away. There ought to be a ship leaving Bigglersport for one of the other Sword-Worlds, before long.         *       *       *       *       *  They paused at the head of the escalators; the garden below was thronged with guests, the bright shawls of the ladies and the coats of the men making shifting color-patterns among the flower-beds and on the lawns and under the trees. Serving-robots, flame-yellow and black in the Karvall colors, floated about playing soft music and offering refreshments. There was a continuous spiral of changing costume-color around the circular robo-table. Voices babbled happily like a mountain river.  As they stood looking down, another aircar circled low; green and gold, lettered PANPLANET NEWS SERVICE. Sesar Karvall swore in irritation.  \"Didn't there use to be something they called privacy?\" he asked.  \"It's a big story, Sesar.\"  It was; more than the marriage of two people who happened to be in love with each other. It was the marriage of the farming and ranching barony of Traskon and the Karvall steel mills. More, it was public announcement that the wealth and fighting-men of both baronies were now aligned behind Duke Angus of Wardshaven. So it was a general holiday. Every industry had closed down at noon today, and would be closed until morning-after-next, and there would be dancing in every park and feasting in every tavern. To Sword-Worlders, any excuse for a holiday was better than none.  \"They're our people, Sesar; they have a right to have a good time with us. I know everybody at Traskon is watching this by screen.\"  He raised his hand and waved to the news car, and when it swung its pickup around, he waved again. Then they went down the long escalator.  Lady Lavina Karvall was the center of a cluster of matrons and dowagers, around which tomorrow's bridesmaids fluttered like many-colored butterflies. She took possession of her daughter and dragged her into the feminine circle. He saw Rovard Grauffis, small and saturnine, Duke Angus' henchman, and Burt Sandrasan, Lady Lavina's brother. They spoke, and then an upper-servant, his tabard blazoned with the yellow flame and black hammer of Karvall mills, approached his master with some tale of domestic crisis, and the two went away together.  \"You haven't met Captain Harkaman, Lucas,\" Rovard Grauffis said. \"I wish you'd come over and say hello and have a drink with him. I know your attitude, but he's a good sort. Personally, I wish we had a few like him around here.\"  That was his main objection. There were fewer and fewer men of that sort on any of the Sword-Worlds.     II   A dozen men clustered around the bartending robot--his cousin and family lawyer, Nikkolay Trask; Lothar Ffayle, the banker; Alex Gorram, the shipbuilder, and his son Basil; Baron"]]]
