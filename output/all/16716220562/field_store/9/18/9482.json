They had been buried in their brocades, as has been pithily remarked, and forgotten. The condition of the survivors was also precarious.  They were starving in their silks and satins.  Pedrarias, however, did not lack courage.  He sent the survivors hunting for treasures.  Under different captains he dispatched them far and wide through the Isthmus to gather gold, pearls, and food.  They turned its pleasant valleys and its noble hills into earthly hells. Murder, outrage and rapine flourished unchecked, even encouraged and rewarded.  All the good work of Balboa in pacifying the natives and laying the foundation for a wise and kindly rule was undone in a few months.  Such cruelties had never before been practised in any part of the New World settled by the Spaniards.  I do not suppose the men under Pedrarias were any worse than others.  Indeed, they were better than some of them, but they took their cue from their terrible commander. Fiske calls him \"a two-legged tiger.\"  That he was an old man seems to add to the horror which the story of his course inspires.  The recklessness of an unthinking young man may be better understood than the cold, calculating fury and ferocity of threescore and ten.  To his previous appellations, a third was added.  Men called him, \"_Furor Domini_\"--\"The Scourge of God.\"  Not Attila himself, to whom the title was originally applied, was more ruthless and more terrible.  Balboa remonstrated, but to no avail.  He wrote letter after letter to the king, depicting the results of Pedrarias' actions, and some tidings of his successive communications, came trickling back to the {44} governor, who had been especially cautioned by the King to deal mercifully with the inhabitants and set them an example of Christian kindness and gentleness that they might be won to the religion of Jesus thereby!  Pedrarias was furious against Balboa, and would have withheld the King's dispatches acknowledging the discovery of the South Sea by appointing him adelantado; but the Bishop of Darien, whose friendship Balboa had gained, protested and the dispatches were finally delivered. The good Bishop did more.  He brought about a composition of the bitter quarrel between Balboa and Pedrarias.  A marriage was arranged between the eldest daughter of Pedrarias and Balboa.  Balboa still loved his Indian wife; it is evident that he never intended to marry the daughter of Pedrarias, and that he entered upon the engagement simply to quiet the old man and secure his countenance and assistance for the undertaking he projected to the mysterious golden land toward the south.  There was a public betrothal which effected the reconciliation. And now Pedrarias could not do enough for Balboa, whom he called his \"dear son.\"   IV. The End of Balboa  Balboa, therefore, proposed to Pedrarias that he should immediately set forth upon the South Sea voyage.  Inasmuch as Pedrarias was to be supreme in the New World and as Balboa was only a provincial governor under him, the old reprobate at last consented.  Balboa decided that four ships, brigantines, would be needed for his expedition.  The only timber fit for shipping, of which the Spaniards were aware, {45} grew on the eastern side of the Isthmus.  It would be necessary, therefore, to cut and work up the frames and timbers of the ships on the eastern side, then carry the material across the Isthmus, and there put it together.  Vasco Nuñez reconnoitered the ground and decided to start his ship-building operations at a new settlement called Ada.  The timber when cut and worked had to be carried sixteen miles away to the top of the mountain, then down the other slope, to a convenient spot on the river Valsa, where the keels were to be laid, the frames put together, the shipbuilding completed, and the boats launched on the river, which was navigable to the sea.  This amazing undertaking was carried out as planned.  There were two setbacks before the work was completed.  In one case, after the frames had been made and carried with prodigious toil to the other side of the mountain, they were discovered to be full of worms and had to be thrown away.  After they had been replaced, and while the men were building the brigantines, a flood washed every vestige of their labor into the river.  But, as before, nothing could daunt Balboa.  Finally, after labors and disappointments enough to crush the heart of an ordinary man, two of the brigantines were launched in the river.  Most of the carrying had been done by Indians, over two thousand of whom died under the tremendous exactions of the work.  Embarking upon the two brigantines, Balboa soon reached the Pacific, where he was presently joined by the two remaining boats as they were completed.  He had now four fairly serviceable ships and three hundred of the best men of the New World under his command.  He was well equipped and well provisioned {46} for the voyage and lacked only a little iron and a little pitch, which, of course, would have to be brought to him from Ada on the other side of the Isthmus.  The lack of that little iron and that little pitch proved the undoing of Vasco Nuñez.  If he had been able to obtain them or if he had sailed away without them, he might have been the conqueror of Peru; in which case that unhappy country would have been spared the hideous excesses and the frightful internal brawls and revolutions which afterward almost ruined it under the long rule of the ferocious Pizarros.  Balboa would have done better from a military standpoint than his successors, and as a statesman as well as a soldier the results of his policy would have been felt for generations.  History goes on to state that while he was waiting for the pitch and iron, word was brought to him that Pedrarias was to be superseded in his government.  This would have been delightful tidings under any other circumstances, but now that a reconciliation had been patched up between him and the governor, he rightly felt that the arrival of a new governor might materially alter the existing state of affairs. Therefore, he determined to send a party of four adherents across the mountains to Ada to find out if the rumours were true.  If Pedrarias was supplanted the messengers were to return immediately, and without further delay they would at once set sail.  If Pedrarias was still there, well and good.  There would be no occasion for such precipitate action and they could wait for the pitch and iron.  He was discussing this matter with some friends on a rainy day in 1517--the month and the date not being determinable now.  The sentry attached to the governor's quarters, driven to the shelter of the {47} house by the storm, overheard a part of this harmless conversation.  There is nothing so dangerous as a half-truth; it is worse than a whole lie. The soldier who had aforetime felt the weight of Balboa's heavy hand for some dereliction of duty, catching sentences here and there, fancied he detected treachery to Pedrarias and thought he saw an opportunity of revenging himself, and of currying favor with the governor, by reporting it at the first convenient opportunity.  Now, there lived at Ada at the time one Andres Garavito.  This man was Balboa's bitter enemy.  He had presumed to make dishonorable overtures to Balboa's Indian wife.  The woman had indignantly repulsed his advances and had made them known to her husband.  Balboa had sternly reproved Garavito and threatened him with death.  Garavito had nourished his hatred, and had sought opportunity to injure his former captain.  The men sent by Balboa to Ada to find out the state of affairs were very maladroit in their manoeuvres, and their peculiar actions awakened the suspicions of Pedrarias.  The first one who entered the town was seized and cast into prison.  The others thereupon came openly to Ada and declared their purposes.  This seems to have quieted, temporarily, the suspicions of Pedrarias; but the implacable Garavito, taking opportunity, when the governor's mind was unsettled and hesitant, assured him that Balboa had not the slightest intention whatever of marrying Pedrarias's daughter; that he was devoted to his Indian wife, and intended to remain true to her; that it was his purpose to sail to the South Sea, establish a kingdom and make himself independent of Pedrarias.  {48} The old animosity and anger of the governor awoke on the instant. There was no truth in the accusations except in so far as it regarded Vasco Nuñez's attachment to his Indian wife, and indeed Balboa had never given any public refusal to abide by the marital engagement which he had entered into; but there was just enough probability in Garavito's tale to carry conviction to the ferocious tyrant.  He instantly determined upon Balboa's death.  Detaining his envoys, he sent him a very courteous and affectionate letter, entreating him to come to Ada to receive some further instructions before he set forth on the South Sea.  Among the many friends of Balboa was the notary Arguello who had embarked his fortune in the projected expedition.  He prepared a warning to Vasco Nuñez, which unfortunately fell into the hands of Pedrarias and resulted in his being clapped into prison with the rest. Balboa unsuspiciously complied with the governor's request, and, attended by a small escort, immediately set forth for Ada.  He was arrested on the way by a company of soldiers headed by Francisco Pizarro, who had nothing to do with the subsequent transactions, and simply acted under orders, as any other soldier would have done. Balboa was thrown into prison and heavily ironed; he was tried for treason against the King and Pedrarias.  The testimony of the soldier who had listened in the rainstorm was brought forward, and, in spite of a noble"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],["title","South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#8)"],["body","ense, Balboa was declared guilty.  Espinosa, who was his judge, was so dissatisfied with the verdict, however, that he personally besought Pedrarias to mitigate the sentence.  The stern old tyrant refused to interfere, nor would he entertain {49} Balboa's appeal to Spain.  \"He has sinned,\" he said tersely; \"death to him!\"  Four of his companions--three of them men who had been imprisoned at Ada, and the notary who had endeavored to warn him--were sentenced to death.  It was evening before the preparations for the execution were completed.  Balboa faced death as dauntlessly as he had faced life. Pedrarias was hated in Ada and Darien; Balboa was loved.  If the veterans of Antigua had not been on the other side of the Isthmus, Balboa would have been rescued.  As it was, the troops of Pedrarias awed the people of Ada and the judicial murder went forward.  Balboa was as composed when he mounted the scaffold as he had been when he welcomed Pedrarias.  A proclamation was made that he was a traitor, and with his last breath he denied this and asserted his innocence. When the axe fell that severed his head, the noblest Spaniard of the time, and one who ranks with those of any time, was judicially murdered.  One after the other, the three companions, equally as dauntless, suffered the unjust penalty.  The fourth execution had taken place in the swift twilight of the tropical latitude and the darkness was already closing down upon the town when the last man mounted the scaffold.  This was the notary, Arguello, who had interfered to save Balboa.  He seems to have been beloved by the inhabitants of the town, for they awakened from their horror, and some of consideration among them appealed personally to Pedrarias, who had watched the execution from a latticed window, to reprieve the last victim.  \"He shall die,\" said the governor sternly, \"if I have to kill him with my own hand.\"  So, to the future sorrow of America, and to the {50} great diminution of the glory and peace of Spain, and the world, passed to his death the gallant, the dauntless, the noble-hearted Balboa.  Pedrarias lived until his eighty-ninth year, and died in his bed at Panama; which town had been first visited by one of his captains, Tello de Guzman, founded by Espinosa and upbuilt by himself.  There are times when a belief in an old-fashioned Calvinistic hell of fire and brimstone is an extremely comforting doctrine, irrespective of theological bias.  Else how should we dispose of Nero, Tiberius, Torquemada, and gentlemen of their stripe?  Wherever such a company may be congregated, Pedro Arias de Avila is entitled to a high and exclusive place.    [1] In the English chronicles he is often spoken of as Davila, which is near enough to Diabolo to make one wish that the latter sobriquet had been his own.  It would have been much more apposite.  [2] It was Magellan who gave it the inappropriate name of \"Pacific.\"  [3] To-day not one foot of territory bordering on that sea belongs to Spain.  The American flag flies over the Philippines--shall I say forever?     {53}  III  Peru and the Pizarros   A Study in Retribution  \"They that take the sword shall perish by the sword.\"   I. The Chief Scion of a Famous Family  The reader will look in vain on the map of modern Spain for the ancient province of Estremadura, yet it is a spot which, in that it was the birthplace of the conquerors of Peru and Mexico--to say nothing of the discoverer of the Mississippi--contributed more to the glory of Spain than any other province in the Iberian peninsula.  In 1883, the ancient territory was divided into the two present existing states of Badajoz and Caceres.  In the latter of these lies the important mountain town of Trujillo.  Living there in the last half of the fifteenth century was an obscure personage named Gonzalo Pizarro.  He was a gentleman whose lineage was ancient, whose circumstances were narrow and whose morals were loose. By profession he was a soldier who had gained some experience in the wars under the \"Great Captain,\" Gonsalvo de Cordova.  History would take no note of this vagrom and obscure cavalier had it not been for his children.  Four sons there were whose qualities and opportunities were such as to have enabled them to play a somewhat large part in the world's affairs {54} in their day.  How many unconsidered other progeny, male or female, there may have been, God alone knows--possibly, nay probably, a goodly number.  The eldest son was named Francisco.  His mother, who was not married to his father--indeed not married to anybody at any time so far as I can find out--was a peasant woman named Francisca Gonzales.  Francisco was born about the year 1471.  His advent was not of sufficient importance to have been recorded, apparently, and the exact date of his terrestrial appearance is a matter of conjecture, with the guesses ranging between 1470 and 1478.  A few years after the arrival of Francisco, there was born to Gonzales, and this time by his lawful wife, name unknown, a second son, Hernando.  By the woman Gonzales, a score of years later, this promiscuous father had two more illegitimate sons, one of whom he named Gonzalo after himself, and the third he called Juan.  Francisca Gonzales also bore a fourth son, of whom Gonzalo Pizarro was not the father, who was known as Martin de Alcántara.  Thus Hernando, the second, was legitimate; Gonzalo and Juan were his illegitimate half-brethren, having the same father but a different mother; while Alcántara was a uterine brother to the three illegitimate Pizarros, having the same mother but a different father. There must have been marvelous qualities in the original Pizarro, for such a family is rarely to be met with in history.  Such a mixed state of affairs was not so shocking in those days as it would be at present.  I do not find that anybody cast any stones at the Pizarros on account of these irregularities in their birth.  In fact, they had plenty of companions in their anomalous social relations, and it is a speaking commentary on the {55} times that nobody seemed to consider it as especially disgraceful or even very remarkable.  Hernando, the second son, received a good education for the day.  The others were thrown mainly on their own resources.  Legend says that Francisco was suckled by a sow.  The statement may be dismissed as a fable, but it is more than probable that the assertion that he was a swineherd is correct.  It is certain that to the day of his death he could neither read nor write.  He never even learned to sign his own name, yet he was a man of qualities who made a great figure in history in spite of these disabilities, leaving behind him an immortal if unenviable name.  His career was humble and obscure to the vanishing point for forty years, of which practically nothing is known.  It is alleged that he made a campaign in Italy with his father, but this is doubtful.  A father who left him to tend the swine, who did nothing for his education, would not have bothered to take him a-soldiering.  We leave the field of conjecture, however, and meet him in far-off America in 1510 as an officer under Alonzo de Ojeda--that Don Quixote among discoverers.  His qualities had obtained for him some preferment, for when Ojeda left the miserable remnants of his colony at San Sebastian on the Gulf of Darien, and returned to Cuba for help, Pizarro was put in charge, with instructions to wait a certain time, and if succour did not reach him to leave.  He waited the required time, indeed waited longer, until enough people died to enable the brigantine that had been left with them to carry the survivors, and then sailed away.  He was a member of Encisco's expedition to Darien, in which he fell in with the youthful and {56} romantic Vasco Nuñez de Balboa. With Balboa he marched across the Isthmus, and was the second white man to look upon the Great South Sea in 1513.  Subsequently, he was an officer under that American Nero, Pedro Arias de Avila, commonly called Pedrarias, the founder and Governor of Panama, the conqueror of Nicaragua and parts adjacent.  Oviedo says that between his seventieth year, which was his age when he came to America, and his eighty-sixth year, when he died, the infamous Pedrarias caused more than two million Indians to be put to death, besides a numerous lot of his own countrymen.  If we lop off two ciphers, the record is still bad enough.  In 1515, Pizarro and Morales, by direction of Pedrarias, made an expedition to the south of the Gulf of San Miguel, into the territory of a chieftain named Biru, from whom they early got into the habit of calling the vague land believed to exist in the South Sea, the \"Land of Biru,\" or Peru.  It was on this expedition that the Spaniards, hotly pursued by the natives, stabbed their captives one by one and left them dying at intervals in the pathway to check pursuit.  The practice was effective enough and the action throws an interesting light on the Spanish conquistador in general and Pizarro in particular.  It fell to the lot of Pizarro also to arrest his old captain, Balboa, just as the latter was about to sail on a voyage of discovery to the fabulous gold country of Peru in 1517.[1]  When Balboa and Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus six years before, the son of the Cacique Comagre, observing their avidity for gold, told them {57} that it abounded in a mysterious land far toward the south, and the young Indian made a little clay image of a llama further to describe the country.  To conquer that El Dorado had been Balboa's cherished dream.  Well would it have been for the country had not the jealousy of Pedrarias cut short Balboa's career by taking off his head, thus forcing the enterprise to be undertaken by men of coarser mould and meaner clay. It does not appear that Pizarro had any hand in the judicial murder of Balboa, and no reflection can be made on his conduct for the arrest, which was simply a matter of military duty, probably as"]]]
