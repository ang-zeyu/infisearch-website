Thorvald's was bleak, hard, his eyes on the stream behind them as if he expected at any moment to see a Throg emerge from the surface of the water.  \"Suppose that thing--\" Shann pointed upstream with his chin--\"follows us? What is it anyway?\" Hound suggested Terran dog, but he couldn't stretch his imagination to believe in a working co-operation between Throg and any mammal.  \"A rather spectacular combination of toad and lizard, with a few other grisly touches, is about as close as you can get to a general description. And that won't be too accurate, because like the Throgs its remote ancestors must have been of the insect family. If the thing follows us, and I think we can be sure that it will, we'll have to take steps. There is always this advantage--those hounds cannot be controlled from a flyer, and the beetle-heads never take kindly to foot slogging. So we won't have to expect any speedy chase. If it slips its masters in rough country, we can try to ambush it.\" In the dim light Thorvald was frowning. \"I flew over the territory ahead on two sweeps, and it is a queer mixture. If we can reach the rough country bordering the sea, we'll have won the first round. I don't believe that the Throgs will be in a hurry to track us in there. They'll try two alternatives to chasing us on foot. One, use their energy beams to rake any suspect valley, and since there are hundreds of valleys all pretty much alike, that will take some time. Or they can attempt to shake us out with a dumdum should they have one here, which I doubt.\"  Shann tensed. The stories of the effects of the Throg's dumdum weapon were anything but pretty.  \"And to get a dumdum,\" Thorvald continued as if he were discussing a purely theoretical matter and not a threat of something worse than death, \"They'll have to bring in one of their major ships. Which they will hesitate to do with a cruiser near at hand. Our own danger spot now is the section we should strike soon after dawn tomorrow if the rate of this current is what I have timed it. There is a band of desert on this side of the mountains. The river gorge deepens there and the land is bare. Let them send a ship over and we could be as visible as if we were sending up flares----\"  \"How about taking cover now and going on only at night?\" suggested Shann.  \"Ordinarily, I'd say yes. But with time pressing us now, no. If we keep straight on, we could reach the foothills in about forty hours, maybe less. And we have to stay with the river. To strike across country there without good supplies and on foot is sheer folly.\"  Two days. With perhaps the Throgs unleashing their hound on land, combing from their flyers. With a desert.... Shann put out his hands to the wolverines. The prospect certainly didn't seem anywhere near as simple as it had the night before when Thorvald had planned this escape. But then the Survey officer had left out quite a few points which were not pertinent. Was he also leaving out other essentials? Shann wanted to ask, but somehow he could not.  After a while he dozed, his head resting on his knees. He awoke, roused out of a vivid dream, a dream so detailed and so deeply impressed in a picture on his mind that he was confused when he blinked at the riverbank visible in the half-light of early dawn.  Instead of that stretch of earth and ragged vegetation now gliding past him as the raft angled along, he should have been fronting a vast skull stark against the sky--a skull whose outlines were oddly inhuman, from whose eyeholes issued and returned flying things while its sharply protruding lower jaw was lapped by water. In color that skull had been a violent clash of blood-red and purple. Shann blinked again at the riverbank, seeing transposed on it still that ghostly haze of bone-bare dome, cavernous eyeholes and nose slit, fanged jaws. That skull was a mountain, or a mountain was a skull--and it was important to him; he must locate it!  He moved stiffly, his legs and arms cramped but not cold. The wolverines stirred on either side of him. Thorvald continued to sleep, curled up beyond, the pole still clasped in his hands. A flat map case was slung by a strap about his neck, its thin envelope between his arm and his body as if for safekeeping. On the smooth flap was the Survey seal, and it was fastened with a finger lock.  Thorvald had lost some of the bright hard surface he had shown at the spaceport where Shann had first sighted him. There were hollows in his cheeks, sending into high relief those bone ridges beneath his eye sockets, giving him a faint resemblance to the skull of Shann's dream. His face was grimed, his field uniform stained and torn. Only his hair was as bright as ever.  Shann smeared the back of his hand across his own face, not doubting that he must present an even more disreputable appearance. He leaned forward cautiously to look into the water, but that surface was not quiet enough to act as a mirror.  Getting to his feet as the raft bobbed under his shift of weight, Shann studied the territory now about them. He could not match Thorvald's inches, just as he must have a third less bulk than the officer, but standing, he could sight something of what now lay beyond the rising banks of the cut. That grass which had been so thick in the meadowlands around the camp had thinned into separate clumps, pale lavender in color. And the scrawniness of stem and blade suggested dehydration and poor soil. The earth showing between those clumps was not of the usual blue, but pallid, too, bleached to gray, while the bushes along the stream's edge were few and smaller. They must have crossed the line into the desert Thorvald had promised.  Shann edged around to face west. There was light enough in the sky to sight tall black pyramids waiting. They had to reach those distant mountains, mountains whose feet on the other side were resting in sea water. He studied them carefully, surveying each peak he could separate from its fellows.  Did the skull lie among them? The conviction that the place he had seen in his dream was real, that it was to be found on Warlock, persisted. Not only was it a definite feature of the landscape somewhere in the wild places of this world, but it was also necessary for him to locate it. Why? Shann puzzled over that, with a growing uneasiness which was not quite fear, not yet, anyway.  Thorvald moved. The raft tilted and the wolverines became growly. Shann sat down, one hand out to the officer's shoulder in warning. Feeling that touch Thorvald shifted, one hand striking out blindly in a blow which Shann was just able to avoid while with the other he pinned the map case yet tighter to him.  \"Take it easy!\" Shann urged.  The other's eyelids flicked. He looked up, but not as if he saw Shann at all.  \"The Cavern of the Veil----\" he muttered. \"Utgard....\" Then his eyes did focus and he sat up, gazing around him with a frown.  \"We're in the desert,\" Shann announced.  Thorvald got up, balancing on feet planted a little apart, looking to the faded expanse of the waste spreading from the river cut. He stared at the mountains before he squatted down to fumble with the lock of the map case.  The wolverines were growing restless, though they still did not try to move about too freely on the raft, greeting Shann with vocal complaint. He and Thorvald could satisfy their hunger with a handful of concentrates from the survival kit. But those dry tablets could not serve the animals. Shann studied the terrain with more knowledge than he had possessed a week earlier. This was not hunting land, but there remained the bounty of the river.  \"We'll have to feed Taggi and Togi,\" he broke the silence abruptly. \"If we don't, they'll be into the river and off on their own.\"  Thorvald glanced up from one of the tough, thin sheets of map skin, again as if he had been drawn back from some distance. His eyes moved from Shann to the unpromising shore.  \"How? With what?\" he wanted to know. Then the real urgency of the situation must have penetrated his mental isolation. \"You have an idea--?\"  \"There's those fish we found them eating back by the mountain stream,\" Shann said, recalling an incident of a few days earlier. \"Rocks here, too, like those the fish were hiding under. Maybe we can locate some of them here.\"  He knew that Thorvald would be reluctant to work the raft in shore, to spare time for such hunting. But there would be no arguing with hungry wolverines, and he did not propose to lose the animals for the officer's whim.  However, Thorvald did not protest. They poled the raft out of the main pull of the current, sending it in toward the southern shore in the lee of a clump of light-willows. Shann scrambled ashore, the wolverines after him, sniffling along at his heels while he overturned likely looking rocks to unroof some odd underwater dwellings. The fish with the rudimentary legs were present and not agile enough even in their native element to avoid well-clawed paws which scooped them neatly out of the river shallows. There was also a sleek furred creature with a broad flat head and paddle-equipped forepaws, rather like a miniature seal, which Taggi appropriated before Shann had a chance to examine it closely. In fact, the wolverines wrought havoc along a half-mile section of bank before the Terran could coax them back to the raft.  As they hunted, Shann got a better idea of the land about the river. It was sere, the vegetation dwindling except for some rough spikes of things pushing through the parched ground like flayed fingers, their puffed redness in contrast to the usual amethystine coloring of Warlock's growing things.

You fellows think you're some smart on fancy skating, don't you?\" he demanded rather scornfully.  \"No,\" replied Dave Darrin shortly.  \"You been showing off a lot, then.\"  \"Hen,\" grimaced Dave, \"I'm afraid you're going to miss your calling in life.\"  \"Didn't know I had any,\" grunted Hen.  \"Yes, you have; one of your own choosing, too.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Hen curiously.  \"You're a walking anvil chorus.\"  \"An anvil chorus?\" repeated Hen Dutcher, the puzzled expression deepening in his face.  \"Yes; wherever you go the fellows are sure to hear the sounds of 'hammering' and 'knocking.'\"  A score of boys grinned, a dozen laughed outright. But Hen wasn't bright enough to see the point.  \"What's an anvil got to do with it all?\" demanded Hen in a puzzled tone. \"An anvil belongs in a blacksmith shop.\"  \"And that's where you ought to go, to do all your 'hammering' and 'knocking,'\" explained Dave, as he skated slowly away.  \"Huh! You think you're smart!\" growled Hen, who still couldn't see why the other fellows had laughed.  \"Hen,\" remarked Dick Prescott, \"I'm afraid you're not up to concert pitch.\"  \"Concert pitch?\" repeated the dense one. \"No, I know I'm not. Did I ever make any claim to being musical?\"  \"You see,\" hinted Greg Holmes, \"the trouble with the Dutcher kid is that he's all ivory, from his collar-button up.\"  Another laugh greeted this assertion, but Hen only glared stupidly.  \"Ivory is all white, anyway,\" Hen muttered. \"So am I.\"  He swelled out his chest, did one or two fancy little things on skates, and tried to look important. But none of the other fellows in the group on the ice seemed inclined to take young Dutcher at his own valuation.  Hen Dutcher was a peculiar chap, at any rate. His worst fault, probably--but one that led to other faults--was his egotism. He was always thinking about himself and his own puny little interests. For the life of him, Hen couldn't understand why he wasn't popular with other fellows. He sometimes realized that he wasn't, but charged the fact up to the other fellows being \"too stuck on themselves, or on those 'boobs,' Dick Prescott and Dave Darrin.\"  \"Let's run Hen ashore and rub his face in the snow!\" proposed one boy gleefully.  \"You dassent!\" flared up Hen. But half a dozen boys uttered a whoop and skated toward him. Hen wobbled on his skates an instant, then turned, intent on escape.  \"Oh, say, fellows,\" called Dick, \"don't be all the time picking on poor old Hen.\"  \"We'll just wash his face,\" shouted back one of the pursuers.  Hen knew they meant it, and he was traveling down the ice, now, under full steam.  \"Come on, fellows,\" called Dick, to Greg and to Tom Reade. \"We don't want to see Hen abused.\"  \"Why does he get so fresh, then?\" demanded Greg, but he started, as did Tom. Dick & Co. were all fleet skaters. They surged to the front of the pursuers, who took it for granted that Dick and his friends were going to aid them, and therefore set up a shout of joy.  Hen Dutcher was traveling with so much effort that he panted hard as he skated.  \"Get him, Dick!\" sang out Ben Alvord, as Prescott shot ahead of the others.  Hen, looking back, saw Dick gaining on him swiftly, while Greg and Tom were just behind.  \"They're mean as all-git-out!\" sputtered panting Hen. \"Why can't they let a fellow alone? Don't they think I've got as much right to talk as the rest of 'em? Well, I'll show 'em that I have!\"  At this moment Dick overtook the fugitive, linking arms with him.  \"You let me alone!\" snarled Hen. \"You're meaner'n poison!\"  \"Am I?\" smiled Dick. \"See here, Hen, face about and don't let the fellows bluff you out of a week's growth. Just turn on them. They won't do anything to you.\"  \"If they try it on, I'll fix 'em, no matter what desperate thing I have to do to get square,\" snarled Hen.  \"Oh, cut out all the war talk,\" Dick advised him gently. \"Now, wheel about.\"  \"You lemme alone! I know where I'm going,\" snapped Hen, making a big effort to break loose from Dick's hold. The effort proved a disastrous one, for Hen tripped himself, slid along for a few feet and then sat down with a jarring bump on the ice. Dick Prescott all but shared the same fate.  \"Now, we've got him!\" chuckled Ben Alvord, racing in and reaching out for the luckless Dutcher.  The unexpected happened. Hen swung around, as on a pivot, extending a foot in such a way as to trip Ben and send him down on his own face.  In the gasp of astonishment that followed Hen got upon his feet, gave a swift push with his left skate and was away.  \"After him, fellows!\" roared Toby Ross. \"We'll hold him and let Ben do the face-washing.\"  Dick, Tom and Greg had shot past the scene. Now they circled and came back, their faces aglow with the fast sport and the keen air.  Hen tried to make for the shore, but got in where the surface of the ice was rough and choppy. Ned Allen and Toby reached out to grasp Hen as they neared him. Young Dutcher made a switching-away movement, and the next instant he had fallen flat on his face. He let out a howl.  \"We've got him!\" declared Toby, as he and Allen pounced on the prostrate one.  \"Yes, but let him alone, fellows,\" urged Dick, reaching the scene and halting. \"Hen may have his faults, but it's time we chose another fellow to pick on for a while.\"  \"We're going to wash his face,\" insisted Ben Alvord, skating up and looking belligerent. \"Don't you interfere, Dick Prescott!\"  Hen, making no effort to do more than sit up, was blubbering softly.  \"Lemme alone, fellows,\" he pleaded. \"Can't you see I'm hurt?\"  Hen had his right mitten off, and was gingerly applying that hand to the narrow stretch of upper lip. There was blood there. Hen, catching only an imperfect view as he gazed down past the end of his nose, was sure that he had been badly injured by his fall.  Some of the other boys set up a yell of laughter.  \"Why, you big baby!\" blurted Toby. \"You've only scratched your lip on the ice.\"  \"A handful of snow will heal it!\" asserted Ben Alvord. \"Come, get up, bone-head! Come on to your dousing.\"  \"You lemme alone, I tell you!\" screamed Dutcher, blubbering. \"I've got to go home and get myself attended to.\"  \"Come on, booby!\" jeered Alvord, forcing a hand under one of Hen's shoulders and trying to lift him.  \"Lemme alone. Can't you see I'm badly hurt?\"  \"Let Hen alone,\" broke in Dick quietly.  \"He's got to come ashore and have his face washed in the snow,\" insisted Alvord. \"Come, fellows, help me take him there.\"  \"You'd better step back and let him alone, Ben!\" spoke Dick, more quietly than before, but there was a sound of command in his voice as he moved over between Hen and Alvord.  \"Get out of the way,\" growled Ben. \"This ivory-top has got to have his face washed in the snow.\"  \"And I say you're not going to do it,\" warned Dick.  \"He's too fresh, Hen is.\"  \"No committee of citizens has asked you to reform any one, Ben,\" Dick went on good-humoredly. \"You've got a few faults of your own that you might remedy, and I guess we all have.\"  \"Come on, fellows, and rush Dutcher,\" called Ben Alvord. Ross, Allen and others moved as though to help, but Dick was flanked by Tom and Greg. In the distance Dave Darrin could be seen skating back.  \"All right, if you fellows insist on it,\" partly agreed Dick. \"But if trouble starts Hen is going to have some backing on his side, too.\"  \"I guess that's right,\" nodded Tom Reade.  \"Now, who's fresh?\" challenged Ben Alvord hotly. \"You, Dick Prescott.\"  \"Well, if I am,\" sighed Dick, \"I'm ready to take my punishment for it. At all events, I'll look after myself.\"  \"Yah, you will!\" growled Ben angrily. \"I notice that, just as soon as anything starts, your gang always jump in on the scene!\"  \"Dick will fight you, all"]]]
