When he popped his head out again he was just his usual saucy little self.  \"Say, Striped Chipmunk,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, rushing over to him, \"tell us how you happen to have pockets in your cheeks.\"  But Striped Chipmunk just snapped his bright eyes at them and said \"Busy! busy! busy!\" as he scuttled over to the hollow chestnut tree.  The Merry Little Breezes saw that it was no use at all to try to tempt Striped Chipmunk to play with them or to answer questions.  \"I tell you what,\" cried one, \"let's go ask Great-Grandfather Frog how Striped Chipmunk happens to have pockets in his cheeks.  He'll know.\"  So away they started, after they had raced over to the big hollow chestnut tree and sent a shower of brown nuts rattling down to Striped Chipmunk from the burrs that Jack Frost had opened the night before.  \"Good-bye, Striped Chipmunk,\" they shouted as they romped across the Green Meadows.  And Striped Chipmunk stopped long enough to shout \"Good-bye\" before he filled his pockets with the brown nuts.  Old Grandfather Frog sat on his big green lily pad blinking in the sun. It was very still, very, very still indeed.  Suddenly out of the brown bulrushes burst the Merry Little Breezes and surrounded old Grandfather Frog.  And every one of them had brought to him a fat, foolish, green fly.  Grandfather's big goggly eyes sparkled and he gave a funny little hop up into the air as he caught each foolish green fly.  When the last one was safely inside his white and yellow waistcoat he settled himself comfortably on the big green lily pad and folded his hands over the foolish green flies.  \"Chug-a-rum!\"  said  Grandfather Frog.  \"What is it you want this morning?\"  \"Oh, Grandfather Frog,\" cried the Merry Little Breezes, \"tell us how it happens that Striped Chipmunk has pockets in his cheeks.  Do tell us, Grandfather Frog.  Please do!\"  \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"How should I know?\"  \"But you do know, Grandfather Frog, you know you do.  Please tell us!\" cried the Merry Little Breezes as they settled themselves among the rushes.  And presently Grandfather Frog began:  \"Once upon a time--a long, long while ago--\"  \"When the world was young?\" asked a mischievous little Breeze.  Grandfather Frog pretended to be very much put out by the interruption, and tried to look very severe.  But the Merry Little Breezes were all giggling, so that presently he had to smile too.  \"Yes,\" said he, \"it was when the world was young, before old King Bear became king.  Mr. Chipmunk, Striped Chipmunk's great-great-great-grandfather a thousand times removed, was the smallest of the squirrels, just as Striped Chipmunk is now.  But he didn't mind that, not the least little bit.  Mr. Gray Squirrel was four times as big and had a handsome tail, Mr. Fox Squirrel was four times as big and he also had a handsome tail, Mr. Red Squirrel was twice as big and he thought his tail was very good to see.  But Mr. Chipmunk didn't envy his big cousins their fine tails; not he!  You see he had himself a beautiful striped coat of which he was very proud and which he thought much more to be desired than a big tail.  \"So Mr. Chipmunk went his way happy and contented and he was such a merry little fellow and so full of fun and cut such funny capers that everybody loved Mr. Chipmunk.  \"One day, when the nights were cool and all the trees had put on their brilliant colors, old Mother Nature sent word down across the Green Meadows that every squirrel should gather for her and store away until she came a thousand nuts.  Now the squirrels had grown fat and lazy through the long summer, all but Mr. Chipmunk, who frisked about so much that he had no chance to grow fat.  \"Mr. Gray Squirrel grumbled.  Mr. Fox Squirrel grumbled.  Mr. Red Squirrel grumbled.  But they didn't dare disobey old Mother Nature, so they all set out, each to gather a thousand nuts.  And Mr. Chipmunk alone was pleasant and cheerful.  \"When they reached the nut trees, what do you suppose they discovered? Why, that they had been so greedy that they had eaten most of the nuts and it was going to be hard work to find and store a thousand nuts for old Mother Nature.  Then they began to hurry, did Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, each trying to make sure of his thousand nuts.  They quarreled and they fought over the nuts on the ground and even up in the trees.  And because they were so big and so strong, they pushed Mr. Chipmunk this way and they pushed him that way and often just as he was going to pick up a fat nut one of them would knock him over and make off with the prize.  \"Poor Mr. Chipmunk kept his temper and was as polite as ever, but how he did work!  His cousins are great climbers and could get the nuts still left on the trees, but Mr. Chipmunk is a poor climber, so he had to be content with those on the ground.  Of course he could carry only one nut at a time and his legs were so short that he had to run as fast as ever he could to store each nut in his secret store-house and get back for another.  And while the others quarreled and fought, he hurried back and forth, back and forth, from early morning until jolly, round, red Mr. Sun pulled his night cap on behind the Purple Hills, hunting for nuts and putting them away in his secret store-house.  \"But the nuts grew scarcer and scarcer on the ground and harder to find, for the other squirrels were picking them up too, and then they did not have so far to carry them.  \"Sometimes one of his cousins up in the trees would drop a nut, but Mr. Chipmunk never would take it, not even when he was having hard work to find any, 'for,' said he to himself, 'if my cousin drops a nut, it is his nut just the same.'  \"Finally Mr. Gray Squirrel announced that he had got his thousand nuts. Then Mr. Fox Squirrel announced that he had got his thousand nuts.  The next day Mr. Red Squirrel stopped hunting because he had his thousand nuts.  \"But Mr. Chipmunk had hardly more than half as many.  And that night he made a dreadful discovery--some one had found his secret store-house and had _stolen_ some of his precious nuts.  \"'It's of no use to cry over what can't be helped,' said Mr. Chipmunk, and the next morning he bravely started out again.  He had worked so hard that he had grown thinner and thinner until now he was only a shadow of his old self.  But he was as cheerful as ever and kept right on hunting and hunting for stray nuts.  Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel sat around and rested and made fun of him.  Way up in the tops of the tallest trees a few nuts still clung, but his cousins did not once offer to go up and shake them down for Mr. Chipmunk.  \"And then old Mother Nature came down across the Green Meadows.  First Mr. Gray Squirrel took her to his storehouse and she counted his thousand nuts.  Then Mr. Fox Squirrel led her to his storehouse and she counted his thousand nuts.  Then Mr. Red Squirrel showed her his store-house and she counted his thousand nuts.  \"Last of all Mr. Chipmunk led her to his secret store-house and showed her the pile of nuts he had worked so hard to get.  Old Mother Nature didn't need to count them to see that there were not a thousand there.  \"'I've done the best I could,' said Mr. Chipmunk bravely, and he trembled all over, he was so tired.  \"Old Mother Nature said never a word but went out on the Green Meadows and sent the Merry Little Breezes to call together all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks.  When they had all gathered before her she suddenly turned to Mr. Gray Squirrel.  \"'Go bring me a hundred nuts from your store-house,' said she.  \"Then she turned to Mr. Fox Squirrel.  \"'Go bring me a hundred nuts from your store-house,' said she.  \"Last of all she called Mr. Red Squirrel out where all could see him. Mr. Red Squirrel crept out very slowly.  His teeth chattered and his tail, of which he was so proud, dragged on the ground, for you see Mr. Red Squirrel had something on his mind.  \"Then old Mother Nature told how she had ordered each squirrel to get and store for her a thousand nuts.  She told just how selfish Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel had been.  She told just how hard Mr. Chipmunk had worked and then she told how part of his precious store had been stolen.  \"'And there,' said old Mother Nature in a loud voice so that every one should hear, 'there is the thief!'  \"Then she commanded Mr. Red Squirrel to go to his store-house and bring her half of the biggest and best nuts he had there!  \"Mr. Red Squirrel sneaked off with his head hanging, and began to bring the nuts.  And as he tramped back and forth, back and forth, all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks pointed their fingers at him and cried 'Thief!  Thief!  Thief!'  \"When all the nuts had been brought to her by Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, old Mother Nature gathered them all up and put them in the secret store-house of Mr. Chipmunk.  Then she set Mr. Chipmunk up on an old stump where all could see him and she said:  \"'Mr. Chipmunk, because you have been faithful, because you have been cheerful, because you have done your best, henceforth you shall have two pockets, one in each cheek, so that you can carry two nuts at once, that you may not have to work so hard the next time I tell you to store a thousand nuts.'  \"And all the little meadow people and all the little forest folks shouted 'Hurrah for Mr. Chipmunk!'  All but his cousins, Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, who hid themselves for shame.  \"And ever since that time long ago, when the world was young, the Chipmunks have had pockets in their cheeks.  \"You can't fool old Mother Nature,\" concluded Great-Grandfather Frog. \"No, Sir, you can't fool old Mother Nature and it's no use to try.\"  \"Thank you, thank you,\" cried the Merry Little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20877"],["title","Mother West Wind's Children (#6)"],["body","s, clapping their hands.  Then they all raced across the Green Meadows to shake down some more nuts for Striped Chipmunk.     VI  REDDY FOX, THE BOASTER  Johnny Chuck waddled down the Lone Little Path across the Green Meadows.  Johnny Chuck was very fat and rolly-poly.  His yellow brown coat fitted him so snugly that it seemed as if it must burst.  Johnny Chuck was feeling very happy--very happy indeed, for you see Johnny Chuck long ago found the best thing in the world, which is contentment.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, looking down from the sky, smiled and smiled to see Johnny Chuck waddling down the Lone Little Path, for he loved the merry-hearted little fellow, as do all the little meadow people--all but Reddy Fox, for Reddy Fox has not forgotten the surprise Johnny Chuck once gave him and how he called him a \"'fraid cat.\"  Once in a while Johnny Chuck stopped to brush his coat carefully, for he is very particular about his appearance, is Johnny Chuck.  By and by he came to the old butternut tree down by the Smiling Pool.  He could see it a long time before he reached it, and up in the top of it he could see Blacky the Crow flapping his wings and cawing at the top of his voice.  \"There must be something going on,\" said Johnny Chuck to himself, and began to waddle faster.  He looked so very queer when he tried to hurry that jolly round, red Mr. Sun smiled more than ever.  When he was almost to the old butter-nut tree Johnny Chuck sat up very straight so that his head came just above the tall meadow grasses beside the Lone Little Path.  He could see the Merry Little Breezes dancing and racing under the old butternut tree and having such a good time!  And he could see the long ears of Peter Rabbit standing up straight above the tall meadow grasses.  One of the Merry Little Breezes spied Johnny Chuck.  \"Hurry up, Johnny Chuck!\" he shouted, and Johnny Chuck hurried.  When he reached the old butternut tree he was all out of breath.  He was puffing and blowing and he was so warm that he wished just for a minute, a single little minute, that he could swim like Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter, so that he could jump into the Smiling Pool and cool off.  \"Hello, Johnny Chuck!\" shouted Peter Rabbit.  \"Hello yourself, and see how you like it!\" replied Johnny Chuck.  \"Hello myself!\" said Peter Rabbit.  And then because it was so very foolish everybody laughed.  It is a good thing to feel foolishly happy on a beautiful sunshiny day, especially down on the Green Meadows.  Jimmy Skunk was there.  He was feeling very, very good indeed, was Jimmy Skunk, for he had found some very fine beetles for his breakfast.  Little Joe Otter was there, and Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Happy Jack Squirrel, and of course Reddy Fox was there.  Oh my, yes, of course Reddy Fox was there!  Reddy Fox never misses a chance to show off.  He was wearing his very newest red coat and his whitest waistcoat.  He had brushed his tail till it looked very handsome, and every few minutes he would turn and admire it.  Reddy Fox thought himself a very fine gentleman.  He admired himself and he wanted every one else to admire him.  \"Let's do stunts,\" said Peter Rabbit.  \"I can jump farther than anybody here!\"  Then Peter Rabbit jumped a tremendously long jump.  Then everybody jumped, everybody but Reddy Fox.  Even Johnny Chuck jumped, and because he was so rolly-poly he tumbled over and over and everybody laughed and Johnny Chuck laughed loudest of all.  And because his hind legs are long and meant for jumping Peter Rabbit had jumped farther than any one else.  \"I can climb to the top of the old butternut tree quicker than anybody else,\" cried Happy Jack Squirrel, and away he started with Bobby Coon and Billy Mink after him, for though Billy Mink is a famous swimmer and can run swiftly, he can also climb when he has to.  But Happy Jack Squirrel was at the top of the old butternut tree almost before the others had started.  The Merry Little Breezes clapped their hands and everybody shouted for Happy Jack Squirrel, everybody but Reddy Fox.  \"I can swim faster than anybody here,\" shouted Little Joe Otter.  In a flash three little brown coats splashed into the Smiling Pool so suddenly that they almost upset Great-Grandfather Frog watching from his big green lily pad.  They belonged to Little Joe Otter, Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat.  Across the Smiling Pool and back again they raced and Little Joe Otter was first out on the bank.  \"Hurrah for Little Joe Otter!\" shouted Blacky the Crow.  And everybody shouted \"Hurrah!\"  Everybody but Reddy Fox.  \"What can you do, Jimmy Skunk?\" asked Peter Rabbit, dancing up and down, he was so excited.  Jimmy Skunk yawned lazily.  \"I can throw a wonderful perfume farther than anybody here,\" said Jimmy Skunk.  \"We know it!  We know it!\" shouted the Merry Little Breezes as everybody tumbled heels over head away from Jimmy Skunk, even Reddy Fox.  \"But please don't!\"  And Jimmy Skunk didn't.  Then they all came back, Reddy Fox carefully brushing his handsome red coat which had become sadly mussed, he had fled in such a hurry.  Now for the first time in his life Johnny Chuck began to feel just a wee, wee bit discontented.  What was there he could do better than any one else?  He couldn't jump and he couldn't climb and he couldn't swim. He couldn't even run fast, because he was so fat and round and rolly-poly.  He quite forgot that he was so sunny-hearted and good-natured that everybody loved him, everybody but Reddy Fox.  Just then Reddy Fox began to boast, for Reddy Fox is a great boaster. \"Pooh!\" said Reddy Fox, \"pooh!  Anybody could jump if their legs were made for jumping.  And what's the good of climbing trees anyway?  Now I can run faster than anybody here--faster than anybody in the whole world!\" said Reddy Fox, puffing himself out.  \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"You can't beat Spotty the Turtle.\"  Then everyone shouted and rolled over and over in the grass, they were so tickled, for every one remembered how Spotty the Turtle had once won a race from Reddy Fox.  For a minute Reddy Fox looked very foolish.  Then he lost his temper, which is a very unwise thing to do, for it is hard to find again.  He swelled himself out until every hair stood on end and he looked twice as big as he did before.  He strutted up and down and glared at each in turn.  \"And I'm not afraid of any living thing on the Green Meadows!\" boasted Reddy Fox.  \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"Do I see Bowser the Hound?\"  Every hair on Reddy Fox suddenly fell back into place.  He whirled about nervously and anxiously looked over the Green Meadows.  Then everybody shouted again and rolled over and over in the grass and held on to their sides, for you see Bowser the Hound wasn't there at all.  But everybody took good care to keep away from Reddy Fox, everybody but Johnny Chuck.  He just sat still and chuckled and chuckled till his fat sides shook.  \"What are you laughing at?\" demanded Reddy Fox.  \"I was just thinking,\" said Johnny Chuck, \"that though you can run so fast, you can't even catch me.\"  Reddy Fox just glared at him for a minute, he was so mad.  Then he sprang straight at Johnny Chuck.  \"I'll show you!\" he snarled.  Now Johnny Chuck had been sitting close beside a hole that Grandfather Chuck had dug a long time before and which was empty.  In a flash Johnny Chuck disappeared head first in the hole.  Now the hole was too small for Reddy Fox to enter, but he was so angry that he straightway began to dig it larger.  My, how the sand did fly!  It poured out behind Reddy Fox in a stream of shining yellow.  Johnny Chuck ran down the long tunnel underground until he reached the end.  Then when he heard Reddy Fox digging and knew that he was really coming, Johnny Chuck began to dig, too, only instead of digging down he dug up towards the sunshine and the blue sky.  My, how his short legs did fly and his stout little claws dug into the soft earth!  His little forepaws flew so fast that if you had been there you could hardly have seen them at all.  And with his strong hind legs he kicked the sand right back into the face of Reddy Fox.  All the little meadow people gathered around the hole where Johnny Chuck and Reddy Fox had disappeared.  They were very anxious, very anxious indeed.  Would Reddy Fox catch Johnny Chuck?  And what would he do to him?  Was all their fun to end in something terrible to sunny-hearted, merry Johnny Chuck, whom everybody loved?  All of a sudden, pop! right out of the solid earth among the daisies and buttercups, just like a jack-in-the-box, came Johnny Chuck!  He looked very warm and a little tired, but he was still chuckling as he scampered across to another hole of Grandfather Chuck's.  By and by something else crawled out of the hole Johnny Chuck had made. Could it be Reddy Fox?  Where were his white waistcoat and beautiful red coat?  And was that thing dragging behind him his splendid tail?  He crept out of the hole and then just lay down and panted for breath. He was almost too tired to move.  Then he began to spit sand out of his mouth and blow it out of his nose and try to wipe it out of his eyes. The long hair of his fine coat was filled full of sand and no one would ever have guessed that this was Reddy Fox.  \"Haw! haw! haw!\" shouted Blacky the Crow.  Then everybody shouted \"Haw! haw! haw!\" and began to roll in the grass and hold on to their sides once more; everybody but Reddy Fox.  When he could get his breath he didn't look this way or that way, but just sneaked off to his home under the big hickory.  [Illustration: Then everybody shouted \"Haw! haw! haw!\"]  And when Old Mother West Wind came with her big bag to take the Merry Little Breezes to their home behind the Purple Hills, Johnny Chuck waddled back up the Lone Little Path chuckling to himself, for that little feeling of discontent was all gone.  He had found that after all he could do something better than anybody else on the Green"]]]
