FIRST FEW WEEKS THEY ARE ALL JUST COMPLIMENTING EACH OTHER. WAIT TILL THEY GO TO DIVIDE UP SOMETHING. (What a truth that turned out to be)  Well by this time Congress was getting pretty rough so Pres W grabbed his boat and commuted back home,  Said I think I will land in BOSTON the old Pilgrim Fathers had pretty fair luck, and _nobody has ever landed there since_,  Germany couldent figure out how America could get troops over there and get them trained so quick they dident know that in our manual there is nothing about RETREATING and when you only got to teach an Army to go one way you can do it in half the time,  I feel pretty proud over that last little gag, As I used it before Pres Wilson in Washington and he repeated it in his Boston speech, Saying \"as one of our AMERICAN HUMORISTS says,\" Up to then I had only been an ordinary Rope thrower,  _Pretty tough when the Pres cops your act,_  Pres had pretty good luck on that 1st trip they saw his 14 points and raised him -------- ---- more  Says in there, \"There is to be no more wars\" and then there was a Paragraph a little further down told you where to get your AMMUNITION in case there was one,  Now he come's back to Washington to explain the _LEAGUE OF NATIONS_ to Congress You know those guys cant read anything and understand it,  But after eating out of 15 million dollar Gold Plates and hobnobbing with Kings and Dukes can you imagine how Congress looked to him when he come back,  Had All the Senators up to dinner at White House Took Ham Lewis three days to dress for it,  _Not much news from the Dinner Burleson copped the Phones,_  On last day went up to Capitol to sign all the bills Congress had passed Well after he had signed the _bill_,  Then he went before Congress and balled out the WILFUL 37, he was busier than Mcadoo with a new train,  HE and Taft both spoke on same stage first time Pres and x-pres ever _agreed_,  I still wanted to go along but he said: \"wait Will till some other trip and I will take you,\"  You know _13_ is his lucky number if they dont sign this up on this trip he knows they will on his 13th trip,  You see Congress got sore cause he did not call them in extra session, You know the next Con, is _Republican_, Be a good joke on them if he dident call them at all wouldent it,  Back to Paris to meet Col House the only man the Pres ever listened too,  MR DANIELS went over. First time they have ever taken Josephus anywhere, He will be allright in a crowd,  Made Mr Hoover food DICTATOR for all the Allies That means that _BELG FRANCE_ and _ENG_, are not going to get any _more_ to eat than we do,  Conference at 1st gave America Japan Italy France 5 deligates each and England including her Colonies fourteen, Thats all right to allow England for each one of her _Foreign Relations_, But they did not allow us a single one for _Wisconsin_,  _How would you like to have been on a committee of_ Englishman _to inform Ireland they dident get any Deligates_, OH BOY,  Finally got it down to the big TEN now theres only FOUR, speaking to each other,  America dident know till they got over there that those European Nations have had a disease for years called the Gimmes.  England and Japan had a secret Treaty where England was to get everything south of the equator and Japan everything North, Guess they were going to leave the equator for Ireland,  Japan wanted it put in the contract that she was as good as anybody else If she _admitted_ it why put it in, If a man is a Gentleman he don't have a _sign_ on him telling it,  Tell Japan we will recognize them as soon as they recognize China,  =Peace Table is turning out like all Banquets the speeches are too long,=  Everybody at the Table wants a second helping, And Germany the cook hasent got enough to go around,  They agreed on one of the 14 points that was that America went in for _nothing_ and _expects nothing_ they are all UNANIMOUS WE GET IT,  Wanted to put the LEAGUE of nations in with Peace Treaty, thats like a fellow going into a store and the Merchant wont sell him a Suit unless he uses a Gillette Razor,  Its been a great thing for these Senators if it had not been for this to _knock_ they would not have gotten all these Lecture Dates,  The way a lot Of Senators talk you would think Pres W was going to trade America off for a couple of Golf Clubs,  They seem to think the Pres took the =Monroe Doctrine= in his pocket and is liable to lose it over there,  Pres Wilson threatened he would start the war over again, Be terrible if they found out this war was fixed and they had to fight it over again,  They cant let the Russians in this league or they would make a Bush League out of it,  _Best time to have formed this League of Nations was during the war when all these Nations needed each other,_  Everybody is for something to prevent war, but they are afraid it is like Prohibition it dont prohibit,  League of Nations just as clear as the Income Tax blanks,  One thing we got to be thankful for our Soldiers can win wars faster than our Diplomats can talk us into them,  Pres Wilson finally got discouraged at the stalling and told them that if they dident hurry up and do something the Americans would pick up their Wives and come home,  Pres says \"JAMES BRING MY BOAT\"  They then got busy and decided that Belgium could try the Kaiser, Belgium said \"how do we get him,\" Allies said \"thats it if we could get him we would try him ourselves,\"  Some Nations got so tired waiting for Peace they went back to fighting again,  Been working on this League of Nations all winter, Finally one of the deligates said \"What about Peace with Germany\" The others all said \"thats right we never thought of that,\"  Went to call in Germany and they said \"Why we had give you all up thought you wasent coming, We got a better offer from the Bolsheveki\"  =They offer us no indemnities and no Baths,=  If they ever have another war lets have it understood before they start what each Nation wants at the finish,  All those Nations claim they were fighting for freedom, But of course a little more land would make a little more Freedom,  One thing about this League, The last war there were only 10 or 15 nations in it now if they all sign this they can all be in the next one, It wont be near so exclusive,  _Course its hard to please everybody Taft tried that,_  If Pres Wilson had any doubts about this League of Nations being put through he should have taken some of these Prohibitionist. They would have shown him how to get it through whether people wanted it or not,  France says they would have more confidence in this League if they would slip a couple of Nations in between them and Germany,  I WONDER IF WE QUIT FIGHTING TOO QUICK AND DIDENT SIGN PEACE QUICK ENOUGH,  Dont get impatient. It has been just this hard at the end of every war to try and prevent another one,  Pres on his last voyage home said the Monroe Doctrine was fully protected already And to show them that it was, He has now put it in,  This Monroe thing the Republicans talk so much of and know so little about, Protects us against everything but VILLA.  And in the whole History of America he is the only _Nation_ that ever attacked us,  Italy says they will pick up their Marbles and go home  Pres Wilson says you may Fiume, But you will never get it,  Today is Japans day to threaten to pack their kimonas and leave,  Italy bases her claim on an old treaty, She cant afford to trace her Treatys back too far, _If I remember she originally was signed up with Germany_,  Pres Wilson certainly used good judgement in visiting Italy when he first went over,  Sectry BAKER has gone back over to France again think old Newt, kinder likes PARIS,  _They wanted Mcadoo to go but the salary wasent right,_  Can you imagine a guy that couldent make a living out of all the jobs he held, I would love to have just half what one Republican would have made out of all that,  Lot of Reps dont want this League Gag to pass they are jealous cause the Democrats ran the last war, And they want to have another one to show how much better they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20566"],["title","Rogers-isms, the Cowboy Philosopher on the Peace Conference (#2)"],["body","run one than the Democrats,  Even the Big 4 seem to be losing confidence, They have removed the words High Contracting Parties, which appeared 418 times in the original and now speak of it meekly as members of the League,  We know Pres Wilson had a lot to do with drafting it, Cause it has so many WORDS  Now it will take longer to explain it than it did to write it,  If Mr Lodge and Mr Lowell debate on these new amendments Boston has applied for a change of Venue,  _Only debate ever held where both men agreed,_  Pres is up to his old tricks has sent a NOTE to Italy,  His appeal to the Italian People caused as much of a furore as the one to the voters last fall,  Italy says they know Fiume was not in their secret treaty with other Allies But its a nice town and they hate to see it fall into bad hands,  Get all those Nations sore enough to start telling the truth about each other, We will hear something,  Italy claims Fiume because there is more Italians there than anybody else, according to that Look whod get NEW YORK  Japans claims are sorter novel \"They want pay for capturing part of China one of our own Allies\"  They have offered to protect Siberia if they have to stay there forever to do it,  If Japan gets all her claims China will pay more indemnities than Germany who lost the war,  Imagine Japan, Pres Wilson, and Italy, All talking at once, Good thing they cant understand each other or this Conference would never have lasted this long,  AND THEY CALL THAT A PEACE CONFERENCE,  Guess those CZECHO POLOKS have gotten their freedom, I see where they are at _war_.  Wish I could find a man who had read this LEAGUE OF NATIONS, And could tell which was the _Assembly_ and which was the _Council_,  Thats a good clause in there \"where any Allied Nation must give three months notice before it jumps onto any other Allied Nation,\"  _Now the Women want to send Deligates, They forget this is a_ Peace Conference,  See where the German Deligates to the Peace Table brought their Golf Clubs We can see now how Admiral Graysons Pupil stacks up against opposition,  See where Pres Wilson and Italy have compromised on that town down there _Italy got it_,  Its kinder new wrinkle in Diplomacy, The Slovaks can play with it four years till they begin to like it, And then they take it away from them,  AS I UNDERSTAND IT ITALY IS TO HAVE IT TUESDAYS AND SATURDAYS,  But they are going to build those other People (_with that terrible name_) A little young town just as much like this one as they can, down the river aways  Guess the reason they put a four year limit on it, Was that they figured that would about cover the existence of any of those new Nations,  The Idea over there now seems to be lets get something ready to sign up, Whether its any good or not,  See where Pres Wilson and Japan _compromised_ on that CHOW CHOW PLACE JAPAN GETS IT,  I dont know how much money Indemnity Japan will demand from China,  _You know_ CHINA _has one of the best_ JAPANESE _Armies in the World_,  See where Pres Wilson and England compromised on Freedom of the Seas England got it,  Italy left the Conference and got what she wanted, Japan threatened to leave and got what she wanted, If Pres Wilson had left some Republican Senators would have gotten what they wanted,  _Seems several Nations were like_ Jesse Willard _they wanted to know what they were to get before they entered the Arena_,  Well they finally handed Germany the Peace terms 80 thousand words only thing ever written longer than a Lafollette Speech,  HAD TO BE THAT LONG TO TELL THE GERMANS WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THEM  Imagine what a document for Lawers to pick flaws in,  Could have settled the whole thing in one sentence, \"IF YOU BIRDS START ANYTHING AGAIN WE WILL GIVE YOU THE OTHER BARREL,\"  RUSSIA cant get in on this Peace There is not enough Paper in the World to print 80 thousand Russian words on,  If they want to get even with Germany they ought to let them keep their Cables And appoint Burleson to run them  _I thought the Armistace terms read like a second Mortgage, But this reads like a_ FORECLOSURE,  If Germany ever wants to go to war again she will have to fight with _BEER STEINS_  If Germany stops to read those 80 thousand words before they sign them, We needent expect Peace to be signed for years yet,  Now Folks with all this kidding and foolishness aside, for I just say in here whatever I think anybody might laugh at, But of course my real sentiments are the same as everybody else, anything to prevent war If He puts this thing through and there is no more wars, His address will be WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON D C till his whiskers are as long as the Peace Treaty If it should be a Fliv, (which it wont) Why then a letter would reach him at ALABI NEW JERSEY. So all Credit to Pres Wilson it took some game Guy to go through with it,  THE END     Transcriber's Note  The spelling, punctuation and formatting in this project greatly varies.
