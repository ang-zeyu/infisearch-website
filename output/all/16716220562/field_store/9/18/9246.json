Everybody on the Adityan side seemed uneasy with these strange hermaphrodite creatures who were neither slaves nor Lords-Master.  \"Well, gentlemen,\" Count Erskyll began, \"I suppose you have been informed by your former Lords-Master of how relations between them and you will be in the future?\"  \"Oh, yes, Lord Proconsul,\" Khreggor Chmidd replied happily. \"Everything will be just as before, except that the Lords-Master will be called Lords-Employer, and the slaves will be called freedmen, and any time they want to starve to death, they can leave their Employers if they wish.\"  Count Erskyll frowned. That wasn't just exactly what he had hoped Emancipation would mean to these people.  \"Nobody seems to understand about this money thing, though,\" Zhorzh Khouzhik, Sesar Martwynn's chief-freedman said. \"My Lord-Master--\" He slapped himself across the mouth and said, \"Lord-Employer!\" five times, rapidly. \"My Lord-_Employer_ tried to explain it to me, but I don't think he understands very clearly, himself.\"  \"None of them do.\"  The speaker was a small man with pale eyes and a mouth like a rat-trap; Yakoop Zhannar, chief-freedman to Ranal Valdry, the Provost-Marshal.  \"Its really your idea, Prince Trevannion,\" Erskyll said. \"Perhaps you can explain it.\"  \"Oh, it's very simple. You see....\"  At least, it had seemed simple when he started. Labor was a commodity, which the worker sold and the employer purchased; a \"fair wage\" was one which enabled both to operate at a profit. Everybody knew that--except here on Aditya. On Aditya, a slave worked because he was a slave, and a Master provided for him because he was a Master, and that was all there was to it. But now, it seemed, there weren't any more Masters, and there weren't any more slaves.  \"That's exactly it,\" he replied, when somebody said as much. \"So now, if the slaves, I mean, freedmen, want to eat, they have to work to earn money to buy food, and if the Employers want work done, they have to pay people to do it.\"  [Illustration]  \"Then why go to all the trouble about the money?\" That was an elderly chief-freedman, Mykhyl Eschkhaffar, whose Lord-Employer, Oraze Borztall, was Manager of Public Works. \"Before your ships came, the slaves worked for the Masters, and the Masters took care of the slaves, and everybody was content. Why not leave it like that?\"  \"Because the Galactic Emperor, who is the Lord-Master of these people, says that there must be no more slaves. Don't ask me why,\" Tchall Hozhet snapped at him. \"I don't know, either. But they are here with ships and guns and soldiers; what can we do?\"  \"That's very close to it,\" he admitted. \"But there is one thing you haven't considered. A slave only gets what his master gives him. But a free worker for pay gets money which he can spend for whatever he wants, and he can save money, and if he finds that he can make more money working for somebody else, he can quit his employer and get a better job.\"  \"We hadn't thought of that,\" Khreggor Chmidd said. \"A slave, even a chief-slave, was never allowed to have money of his own, and if he got hold of any, he couldn't spend it. But now....\" A glorious vista seemed to open in front of him. \"And he can accumulate money. I don't suppose a common worker could, but an upper slave.... Especially a chief-slave....\" He slapped his mouth, and said, \"Freedman!\" five times.  \"Yes, Khreggor.\" That was Ridgerd Schferts (Fedrig Daffysan; Fiscal Management). \"I am sure we could all make quite a lot of money, now that we are freedmen.\"  Some of them were briefly puzzled; gradually, comprehension dawned. Obray, Count Erskyll, looked distressed; he seemed to be hoping, vainly, that they weren't thinking of what he suspected they were.  \"How about the Mastership freedmen?\" another asked. \"We, here, will be paid by our Lords-Mas- ... Lords-Employer. But everybody from the green robes down were provided for by the Mastership. Who will pay them, now?\"  \"Why, the Mastership, of course,\" Ridgerd Schferts said. \"My Management--my Lord-Employer's, I mean--will issue the money to pay them.\"  \"You may need a new printing-press,\" Lanze Degbrend said. \"And an awful lot of paper.\"  \"This planet will need currency acceptable in interstellar trade,\" Erskyll said.  Everybody looked blankly at him. He changed the subject:  \"Mr. Chmidd, could you or Mr. Hozhet tell me what kind of a constitution the Mastership has?\"  \"You mean, like the paper you read in the Convocation?\" Hozhet asked. \"Oh, there is nothing at all like that. The former Lords-Master simply ruled.\"  No. They reigned. This servile _tammanihal_--another ancient Terran word, of uncertain origin--ruled.  \"Well, how is the Mastership organized, then?\" Erskyll persisted. \"How did the Lord Nikkolon get to be Chairman of the Presidium, and the Lord Javasan to be Chief of Administration?\"  That was very simple. The Convocation, consisting of the heads of all the Masterly families, actually small clans, numbered about twenty-five hundred. They elected the seven members of the Presidium, who drew lots for the Chairmanship. They served for life. Vacancies were filled by election on nomination of the surviving members. The Presidium appointed the Chiefs of Managements, who also served for life.  At least, it had stability. It was self-perpetuating.  \"Does the Convocation make the laws?\" Erskyll asked.  Hozhet was perplexed. \"_Make_ laws, Lord Proconsul? Oh, no. We have laws.\"  There were planets, here and there through the Empire, where an attitude like that would have been distinctly beneficial; planets with elective parliaments, every member of which felt himself obligated to get as many laws enacted during his term of office as possible.  \"But this is dreadful; you _must_ have a constitution!\" Obray of Erskyll was shocked. \"We will have to get one drawn up and adopted.\"  \"We don't know anything about that at all,\" Khreggor Chmidd admitted. \"This is something new. You will have to help us.\"  \"I certainly will, Mr. Chmidd. Suppose you form a committee--yourself, and Mr. Hozhet, and three or four others; select them among yourselves--and we can get together and talk over what will be needed. And another thing. We'll have to stop calling this the Mastership. There are no more Masters.\"  \"The Employership?\" Lanze Degbrend dead-panned.  Erskyll looked at him angrily. \"This is something,\" he told the chief-freedmen, \"that should not belong to the Employers alone. It should belong to everybody. Let us call it the Commonwealth. That means something everybody owns in common.\"  \"Something everybody owns, nobody owns,\" Mykhyl Eschkhaffar objected.  \"Oh, no, Mykhyl; it will belong to everybody,\" Khreggor Chmidd told him earnestly. \"But somebody will have to take care of it for everybody. That,\" he added complacently, \"will be you and me and the rest of us here.\"  \"I believe,\" Yakoop Zhannar said, almost smiling, \"that this freedom is going to be a wonderful thing. For us.\"  \"I don't like it!\" Mykhyl Eschkhaffar said stubbornly. \"Too many new things, and too much changing names. We have to call slaves freedmen; we have to call Lords Master Lords-Employer; we have to call the Management of Servile Affairs the Management for Freedmen. Now we have to call the Mastership this new name, Commonwealth. And all these new things, for which we have no routine procedures and no directives. I wish these people had never heard of this planet.\"  \"That makes at least two of us,\" Patrique Morvill said, _sotto voce_.  \"Well, the planetary constitution can wait just a bit,\" Prince Trevannion suggested. \"We have a great many items on the agenda which must be taken care of immediately. For instance, there's this thing about finding a proconsular palace....\"         *       *       *       *       *  A surprising amount of work had been done at the small tables where Erskyll's staff of political and economic and technological experts had been conferring with the subordinate upper-freedmen. It began coming out during the pre-dinner cocktails aboard the _Empress Eulalie_, continued through the meal, and was fully detailed during the formal debriefing session afterward.  Finding a suitable building for the Proconsular Palace would present difficulties. Real estate was not sold on Aditya, any more than slaves were. It was not only un-Masterly but illegal; estates were all entailed and the inalienable property of Masterly families. What was wanted was one of the isolated residential towers in Zeggensburg, far enough from the Citadel to avoid an appearance of too close supervision. The last thing anybody wanted was to establish the Proconsul in the Citadel itself. The Management of Business of the Mastership, however, had promised to do something about it. That would mean, no doubt, that the _Empress Eulalie_ would be hanging over Zeggensburg, serving as Proconsular Palace, for the next year or so.  The Servile Management, rechristened Freedmen's Management, would undertake to safeguard the rights of the newly emancipated slaves. There would be an Employment Code--Count Erskyll was invited to draw that up--and a force of investigators, and an enforcement agency, under Zhorzh Khouzhik.  One of Commander Douvrin's men, who had been at the Austragonia nuclear-industries establishment, was present and reported:  \"Great Ghu, you ought to see that place! They've people working in places I wouldn't send an unshielded robot, and the hospital there is bulging with radiation-sickness cases. The equipment must have been brought here by the Space Vikings. What's left of it is the damnedest mess of goldbergery I ever saw. The whole thing ought to be shut down and completely rebuilt.\"  Erskyll wanted to know who owned it. The Mastership, he was told.  \"That's right,\" one of his economics men agreed. \"Management of Public Works.\" That would be Mykhyl Eschkhaffar, who had so bitterly objected to the new"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20726"],["title","A Slave is a Slave (#8)"],["body","menclature. \"If anybody needs fissionables for a power-reactor or radioactives for nuclear-electric conversion, his chief business slave gets what's needed. Furthermore, doesn't even have to sign for it.\"  \"Don't they sell it for revenue?\"  \"Nifflheim, no! This government doesn't need revenue. This government supports itself by counterfeiting. When the Mastership needs money, they just have Ridgerd Schferts print up another batch. Like everybody else.\"  \"Then the money simply isn't worth anything!\" Erskyll was horrified, which was rapidly becoming his normal state.  \"Who cares about money, Obray,\" he said. \"Didn't you hear them, last evening? It's un-Masterly to bother about things like money. Of course, everybody owes everybody for everything, but it's all in the family.\"  \"Well, something will have to be done about that!\"  That was at least the tenth time he had said that, this evening.         *       *       *       *       *  It came practically as a thunderbolt when Khreggor Chmidd screened the ship the next afternoon to report that a Proconsular Palace had been found, and would be ready for occupancy in a day or so. The chief-freedmen of the Management of Business of the Mastership and of the Lord Chief Justiciar had found one, the Elegry Palace, which had been unoccupied except for what he described as a small caretaking staff for years, while two Masterly families disputed inheritance rights and slave lawyers quibbled endlessly before a slave judge. The chief freedman of the Lord Chief Justiciar had simply summoned judge and lawyers into his office and ordered them to settle the suit at once. The settlement had consisted of paying both litigants the full value of the building; this came to fifty million stellies apiece. Arbitrarily, the stelly was assigned a value in Imperial crowns of a hundred for one. A million crowns was about what the building would be worth, with contents, on Odin. It would be paid for with a draft on the Imperial Exchequer.  \"Well, you have some hard currency on the planet, now,\" he told Count Erskyll, while they were having a pre-dinner drink together that evening. \"I hope it doesn't touch off an inflation, if the term is permissible when applied to Adityan currency.\"  Erskyll snapped his fingers. \"Yes! And there's the money we've been spending for supplies. And when we start compensation payments.... Excuse me for a moment.\"  He dashed off, his drink in his hand. After a long interval, he was back, carrying a fresh one he had gotten from a bartending robot en route.  \"Well, that's taken care of,\" he said. \"My fiscal man's getting in touch with Ridgerd Schferts; the Elegry heirs will be paid in Adityan stellies, and the Imperial crowns will be held in the Commonwealth Bank, or, better, banked in Asgard, to give Aditya some off-planet credit. And we'll do the same with our other expenditures, and with the slave-compensation. This is going to be wonderful; this planet needs everything in the way of industrial equipment; this is how they're going to get it.\"  \"But, Obray; the compensations are owing to the individual Masters. They should be paid in crowns. You know as well as I do that this hundred-for-one rate is purely a local fiction. On the interstellar exchange, these stellies have a crown value of precisely zero-point-zero.\"  \"You know what would happen if these ci-devant Masters got hold of Imperial crowns,\" Erskyll said. \"They'd only squander them back again for useless imported luxuries. This planet needs a complete modernization, and this is the only way the money to pay for it can be gotten.\" He was gesturing excitedly with the almost-full glass in his hand; Prince Trevannion stepped back out of the way of the splash he anticipated. \"I have no sympathy for these ci-devant Masters. They own every stick and stone and pinch of dust on this planet, as it is. Is that fair?\"  \"Possibly not. But neither is what you're proposing to do.\"  Obray, Count Erskyll, couldn't see that. He was proposing to secure the Greatest Good for the Greatest Number, and to Nifflheim with any minorities who happened to be in the way.         *       *       *       *       *  The Navy took over the Elegry Palace the next morning, ran up the Imperial Sun and Cogwheel flag, and began transmitting views of its interior up to the _Empress Eulalie_. It was considerably smaller than the Imperial Palace at Asgard on Odin, but room for room the furnishings were rather more ornate and expensive. By the next afternoon, the counter-espionage team that had gone down reported the Masterly living quarters clear of pickups, microphones, and other apparatus of servile snooping, of which they had found many. The _Canopus_ was recalled from her station over the northern end of the continent and began sending down the proconsulate furnishings stowed aboard, including several hundred domestic robots.  The skeleton caretaking staff Chmidd had mentioned proved to number five hundred.  \"What are we going to do about them?\" Erskyll wanted to know. \"There's a limit to the upkeep allowance for a proconsulate, and we can't pay five hundred useless servants. The chief-freedman, and about a dozen assistants, and a few to operate the robots, when we train them, but five hundred...!\"  \"Let Zhorzh do it,\" Prince Trevannion suggested. \"Isn't that what this Freedmen's Management is for; to find employment for emancipated slaves? Just emancipate them and turn them over to Khouzhik.\"  Khouzhik promptly placed all of them on the payroll of his Management. Khouzhik was having his hands full. He had all his top mathematical experts, some of whom even understood the use of the slide-rule, trying to work up a scale of wages. Erskyll loaned him a few of his staff. None of the ideas any of them developed proved workable. Khouzhik had also organized a corps of investigators, and he was beginning to annex the private guard-companies of the Lords-ex-Master, whom he was organizing into a police force.         *       *       *       *       *  The nuclear works on Austragonia were closed down. Mykhyl Eschkhaffar ordered a programme of rationing and priorities to conserve the stock of plutonium and radioactive isotopes on hand, and he decided that henceforth nuclear-energy materials would be sold instead of furnished freely. He simply found out what the market quotations on Odin were, translated that into stellies, and adopted it. This was just a base price; there would have to be bribes for priority allocations, rakeoffs for the under-freedmen, and graft for the business-freedmen of the Lords-ex-Masters who bought the stuff. The latter were completely unconcerned; none of them even knew about it.  The Convocation adjourned until the next regular session, at the Midyear Feasts, an eight-day intercalary period which permitted dividing the 358-day Adityan year into ten months of thirty-five days each. Count Erskyll was satisfied to see them go. He was working on a constitution for the Commonwealth of Aditya, and was making very little progress with it.  \"It's one of these elaborate check-and-balance things,\" Lanze Degbrend reported. \"To begin with, it was the constitution of Aton, with an elective president substituted for a hereditary king. Of course, there are a lot of added gadgets; Atonian Radical Democrat stuff. Chmidd and Hozhet and the other chief-slaves don't like it, either.\"  \"Slap your mouth and say, 'Freedmen,' five times.\"  \"Nuts,\" his subordinate retorted insubordinately. \"I know a slave when I see one. A slave is a slave, with or without a gorget; if he doesn't wear it around his neck, he has it tattooed on his soul. It takes at least three generations to rub it off.\"  \"I could wish that Count Erskyll....\" he began. \"What else is our Proconsul doing?\"  \"Well, I'm afraid he's trying to set up some kind of a scheme for the complete nationalization of all farms, factories, transport facilities, and other means of production and distribution,\" Degbrend said.  \"He's not going to try to do that himself, is he?\" He was, he discovered, speaking sharply, and modified his tone. \"He won't do it with Imperial authority, or with Imperial troops. Not as long as I'm here. And when we go back to Odin, I'll see to it that Vann Shatrak understands that.\"  \"Oh, no. The Commonwealth of Aditya will do that,\" Degbrend said. \"Chmidd and Hozhet and Yakoop Zhannar and Zhorzh Khouzhik and the rest of them, that is. He wants it done legitimately and legally. That means, he'll have to wait till the Midyear Feasts, when the Convocation assembles, and he can get his constitution enacted. If he can get it written by then.\"  Vann Shatrak sent two of the destroyers off to explore the moons of Aditya, of which there were two. The outer moon, Aditya-_Ba'_, was an irregular chunk of rock fifty miles in diameter, barely visible to the naked eye. The inner, Aditya-_Alif_, however, was an eight-hundred-mile sphere; it had once been the planetary ship-station and shipyard-base. It seemed to have been abandoned when the Adityan technology and economy had begun sagging under the weight of the slave system. Most of the installations remained, badly run down but repairable. Shatrak transferred as many of his technicians as he could spare to the _Mizar_ and sent her to recondition the shipyard and render the underground city inhabitable again so that the satellite could be used as a base for his ships. He decided, then, to send the _Irma_ back to Odin with reports of the annexation of Aditya, a proposal that Aditya-_Alif_ be made a permanent Imperial naval-base, and a request for more troops.  Prince Trevannion taped up his own reports, describing the general situation on the newly annexed planet, and doing nothing to minimize the problems facing its Proconsul.  \"Count Erskyll\" he finished, \"is doing the best possible under circumstances from which I myself would feel inclined to shrink.
