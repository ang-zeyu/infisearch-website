My past is not smirched with anything like that.\"  \"Would I remember your name if you told me?\"  \"I don't know. I've forgotten yours. Your surname, that is. Of course, I remember that your Christian name was Jill. It has always seemed to me the prettiest monosyllable in the language.\" He looked at her thoughtfully. \"It's odd how little you've altered in looks. Freddie's just the same, too, only larger. And he didn't wear an eye-glass in those days, though I can see he was bound to later on. And yet I've changed so much that you can't place me. It shows what a wearing life I must have led. I feel like Rip van Winkle. Old and withered. But that may be just the result of watching this play.\"  \"It is pretty terrible, isn't it?\"  \"Worse than that. Looking at it dispassionately, I find it the extreme, ragged, outermost edge of the limit. Freddie had the correct description of it. He's a great critic.\"  \"I really do think it's the worst thing I have ever seen.\"  \"I don't know what plays you have seen, but I feel you're right.\"  \"Perhaps the second act's better,\" said Jill optimistically.  \"It's worse. I know that sounds like boasting, but it's true. I feel like getting up and making a public apology.\"  \"But ... Oh!\"  Jill turned scarlet. A monstrous suspicion had swept over her.  \"The only trouble is,\" went on her companion, \"that the audience would undoubtedly lynch me. And, though it seems improbable just at the present moment, it may be that life holds some happiness for me that's worth waiting for. Anyway, I'd rather not be torn limb from limb. A messy finish! I can just see them rending me asunder in a spasm of perfectly justifiable fury. 'She loves me!' Off comes a leg. 'She loves me not!' Off comes an arm. No, I think on the whole I'll lie low. Besides, why should I care? Let 'em suffer. It's their own fault. They _would_ come!\"  Jill had been trying to interrupt the harangue. She was greatly concerned.  \"Did you _write_ the play?\"  The man nodded.  \"You are quite right to speak in that horrified tone. But between ourselves and on the understanding that you don't get up and denounce me, I did.\"  \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\"  \"Not half so sorry as I am, believe me!\"  \"I mean, I wouldn't have said....\"  \"Never mind. You didn't tell me anything I didn't know.\" The lights began to go down. He rose. \"Well, they're off again. Perhaps you will excuse me? I don't feel quite equal to assisting any longer at the wake. If you want something to occupy your mind during the next act, try to remember my name.\"  He slid from his seat and disappeared. Jill clutched at Derek.  \"Oh, Derek, it's too awful. I've just been talking to the man who wrote this play, and I told him it was the worst thing I had ever seen!\"  \"Did you?\" Derek snorted. \"Well, it's about time somebody told him!\" A thought seemed to strike him. \"Why, who is he? I didn't know you knew him.\"  \"I don't. I don't even know his name.\"  \"His name, according to the programme, is John Grant. Never heard of him before. Jill, I wish you would not talk to people you don't know,\" said Derek with a note of annoyance in his voice. \"You can never tell who they are.\"  \"But....\"  \"Especially with my mother here. You must be more careful.\"  The curtain rose. Jill saw the stage mistily. From childhood up, she had never been able to cure herself of an unfortunate sensitiveness when sharply spoken to by those she loved. A rebuking world she could face with a stout heart, but there had always been just one or two people whose lightest word of censure could crush her. Her father had always had that effect upon her, and now Derek had taken his place.  But if there had only been time to explain.... Derek could not object to her chatting with a friend of her childhood, even if she had completely forgotten him and did not remember his name even now. John Grant? Memory failed to produce any juvenile John Grant for her inspection.  Puzzling over this problem, Jill missed much of the beginning of the second act. Hers was a detachment which the rest of the audience would gladly have shared. For the poetic drama, after a bad start, was now plunging into worse depths of dullness. The coughing had become almost continuous. The stalls, supported by the presence of large droves of Sir Chester's personal friends, were struggling gallantly to maintain a semblance of interest, but the pit and gallery had plainly given up hope. The critic of a weekly paper of small circulation, who had been shoved up in the upper circle, grimly jotted down the phrase \"apathetically received\" on his programme. He had come to the theatre that night in an aggrieved mood, for managers usually put him in the dress-circle. He got out his pencil again. Another phrase had occurred to him, admirable for the opening of his article. \"At the Leicester Theatre,\" he wrote, \"where Sir Chester Portwood presented 'Tried by Fire,' dullness reigned supreme....\"  But you never know. Call no evening dull till it is over. However uninteresting its early stages may have been that night was to be as animated and exciting as any audience could desire--a night to be looked back to and talked about, for just as the critic of _London Gossip_ wrote those damning words on his programme, guiding his pencil uncertainly in the dark, a curious yet familiar odour stole over the house.  The stalls got it first, and sniffed. It rose to the dress-circle, and the dress-circle sniffed. Floating up, it smote the silent gallery. And, suddenly, coming to life with a single-minded abruptness, the gallery ceased to be silent.  \"Fire!\"  Sir Chester Portwood, ploughing his way through a long speech, stopped and looked apprehensively over his shoulder. The girl with the lisp, who had been listening in a perfunctory manner to the long speech, screamed loudly. The voice of an unseen stage-hand called thunderously to an invisible \"Bill\" to commere quick. And from the scenery on the prompt side there curled lazily across the stage a black wisp of smoke.  \"Fire! Fire! Fire!\"  \"Just,\" said a voice at Jill's elbow, \"what the play needed!\" The mysterious author was back in his seat again.     CHAPTER III  JILL AND THE UNKNOWN ESCAPE  I   In these days when the authorities who watch over the welfare of the community have taken the trouble to reiterate encouragingly in printed notices that a full house can be emptied in three minutes and that all an audience has to do in an emergency is to walk, not run, to the nearest exit, fire in the theatre has lost a good deal of its old-time terror. Yet it would be paltering with the truth to say that the audience which had assembled to witness the opening performance of the new play at the Leicester was entirely at its ease. The asbestos curtain was already on its way down, which should have been reassuring: but then asbestos curtains never look the part. To the lay eye they seem just the sort of thing that will blaze quickest. Moreover, it had not yet occurred to the man at the switchboard to turn up the house-lights, and the darkness was disconcerting.  Portions of the house were taking the thing better than other portions. Up in the gallery a vast activity was going on. The clatter of feet almost drowned the shouting. A moment before it would have seemed incredible that anything could have made the occupants of the gallery animated, but the instinct of self-preservation had put new life into them.  The stalls had not yet entirely lost their self-control. Alarm was in the air, but for the moment they hung on the razor-edge between panic and dignity. Panic urged them to do something sudden and energetic; dignity counselled them to wait. They, like the occupants of the gallery, greatly desired to be outside, but it was bad form to rush and jostle. The men were assisting the women in their cloaks, assuring them the while that it was \"all right\" and that they must not be frightened. But another curl of smoke had crept out just before the asbestos curtain completed its descent, and their words lacked the ring of conviction. The movement towards the exits had not yet become a stampede, but already those with seats nearest the stage had begun to feel that the more fortunate individuals near the doors were infernally slow in removing themselves.  Suddenly, as if by mutual inspiration, the composure of the stalls began to slip. Looking from above, one could have seen a sort of shudder run through the crowd. It was the effect of every member of that crowd starting to move a little more quickly.  A hand grasped Jill's arm. It was a comforting hand, the hand of a man who had not lost his head. A pleasant voice backed up its message of reassurance.  \"It's no good getting into that mob. You might get hurt. There's no danger; the play isn't going on.\"  Jill was shaken; but she had the fighting spirit and hated to show that she was shaken. Panic was knocking at the door of her soul, but dignity refused to be dislodged.  \"All the same,\" she said, smiling a difficult smile, \"it would be nice to get out, wouldn't it?\"  \"I was just going to suggest something of that very sort,\" said the man beside her. \"The same thought occurred to me. We can stroll out quite comfortably by our own private route. Come along.\"  Jill looked over her shoulder. Derek and Lady Underhill were merged into the mass of refugees. She could not see them. For an instant a little spasm of pique stung her at the thought that Derek had deserted her. She groped her way after her companion, and presently they came by way of a lower box to the iron pass-door leading to the stage.  As it opened, smoke blew through, and the smell of burning was formidable. Jill recoiled involuntarily.  \"It's all right,\" said her companion. \"It smells worse than it really is. And, anyway, this is the quickest way out.\"  They passed through on to the stage, and found themselves in a world of noise and confusion compared with which the auditorium which they had left had been a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20533"],["title","Jill the Reckless (#8)"],["body","place. Smoke was everywhere. A stage-hand, carrying a bucket, lurched past them, bellowing. From somewhere out of sight on the other side of the stage there came a sound of chopping. Jill's companion moved quickly to the switchboard, groped, found a handle, and turned it. In the narrow space between the corner of the proscenium and the edge of the asbestos curtain lights flashed up: and simultaneously there came a sudden diminution of the noise from the body of the house. The stalls, snatched from the intimidating spell of the darkness and able to see each other's faces, discovered that they had been behaving indecorously and checked their struggling, a little ashamed of themselves. The relief would be only momentary, but, while it lasted, it postponed panic.  \"Go straight across the stage,\" Jill heard her companion say, \"out along the passage and turn to the right, and you'll be at the stage-door. I think, as there seems no one else around to do it, I'd better go out and say a few soothing words to the customers. Otherwise they'll be biting holes in each other.\"  He squeezed through the narrow opening in front of the curtain.  \"Ladies and gentlemen!\"  Jill remained where she was, leaning with one hand against the switchboard. She made no attempt to follow the directions he had given her. She was aware of a sense of comradeship, of being with this man in this adventure. If he stayed, she must stay. To go now through the safety of the stage-door would be abominable desertion. She listened, and found that she could hear plainly in spite of the noise. The smoke was worse than ever, and hurt her eyes, so that the figures of the theatre-firemen, hurrying to and fro, seemed like Brocken spectres. She slipped a corner of her cloak across her mouth, and was able to breathe more easily.  \"Ladies and gentlemen, I assure you that there is absolutely no danger. I am a stranger to you, so there is no reason why you should take my word, but fortunately I can give you solid proof. If there were any danger, _I_ wouldn't be here. All that has happened is that the warmth of your reception of the play has set a piece of scenery alight....\"  A crimson-faced stage-hand, carrying an axe in blackened hands, roared in Jill's ear.  \"'Op it!\" shouted the stage-hand. He cast his axe down with a clatter. \"Can't you see the place is afire?\"  \"But--but I'm waiting for....\" Jill pointed to where her ally was still addressing an audience that seemed reluctant to stop and listen to him.  The stage-hand squinted out round the edge of the curtain.  \"If he's a friend of yours, miss, kindly get 'im to cheese it and get a move on. We're clearing out. There's nothing we can do. It's got too much of an 'old. In about another two ticks the roof's going to drop on us.\"  Jill's friend came squeezing back through the opening.  \"Hullo! Still here?\" He blinked approvingly at her through the smoke. \"You're a little soldier! Well, Augustus, what's on your mind?\"  The simple question seemed to take the stage-hand aback.  \"Wot's on my mind? I'll tell you wot's on my blinking mind....\"  \"Don't tell me. Let me guess. I've got it! The place is on fire!\"  The stage-hand expectorated disgustedly. Flippancy at such a moment offended his sensibilities.  \"We're 'opping it,\" he said.  \"Great minds think alike! _We_ are hopping it, too.\"  \"You'd better! And damn quick!\"  \"And, as you suggest, damn quick. You think of everything!\"  Jill followed him across the stage. Her heart was beating violently. There was not only smoke now, but heat. Across the stage little scarlet flames were shooting, and something large and hard, unseen through the smoke, fell with a crash. The air was heavy with the smell of burning paint.  \"Where's Sir Chester Portwood?\" enquired her companion of the stage-hand, who hurried beside them.  \"'Opped it!\" replied the other briefly, and coughed raspingly as he swallowed smoke.  \"Strange,\" said the man in Jill's ear, as he pulled her along. \"This way. Stick to me. Strange how the drama anticipates life! At the end of Act Two there was a scene where Sir Chester had to creep sombrely out into the night, and now he's gone and done it! Ah!\"  They had stumbled through a doorway and were out in a narrow passage, where the air, though tainted, was comparatively fresh. Jill drew a deep breath. Her companion turned to the stage-hand and felt in his pocket.  \"Here.\" A coin changed hands. \"Go and get a drink. You need it after all this.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  \"Don't mention it. You've saved our lives. Suppose you hadn't come up and told us, and we had never noticed there was a fire!\" He turned to Jill. \"Here's the stage-door. Shall we creep sombrely out into the night?\"  The guardian of the stage-door was standing in the entrance of his little hutch, plainly perplexed. He was a slow thinker and a man whose life was ruled by routine, and the events of the evening had left him uncertain how to act.  \"Wot's all this about a fire?\" he demanded.  Jill's friend stopped.  \"A fire?\" He looked at Jill. \"Did _you_ hear anything about a fire?\"  \"They all come bustin' past 'ere yelling there's a fire,\" persisted the door-man.  \"By George! Now I come to think of it, you're perfectly right! There _is_ a fire! If you wait here a little longer you'll get it in the small of the back. Take the advice of an old friend who means you well and vanish. In the inspired words of the lad we've just parted from, 'op it!\"  The stage-door man turned this over in his mind for a space.  \"But I'm supposed to stay 'ere till eleven-thirty and lock up!\" he said. \"That's what I'm supposed to do. Stay 'ere till eleven-thirty and lock up! And it ain't but ten forty-five now.\"  \"I see the difficulty,\" said Jill's companion thoughtfully.  \"Well, Casabianca, I'm afraid I don't see how to help you. It's a matter for your own conscience. I don't want to lure you from the burning deck; on the other hand, if you stick on here you'll most certainly be fired on both sides.... But, tell me. You spoke about locking up something at eleven-thirty. What are you supposed to lock up?\"  \"Why, the theatre.\"  \"Then that's all right. By eleven-thirty there won't _be_ a theatre. If I were you, I should leave quietly and unostentatiously now. To-morrow, if you wish it, and if they've cooled off sufficiently, you can come and sit on the ruins. Good night!\"   II  Outside, the air was cold and crisp. Jill drew her warm cloak closer. Round the corner there was noise and shouting. Fire-engines had arrived. Jill's companion lit a cigarette.  \"Do you wish to stop and see the conflagration?\" he asked.  Jill shivered. She was more shaken than she had realized.  \"I've seen all the conflagration I want.\"  \"Same here. Well, it's been an exciting evening. Started slow, I admit, but warmed up later! What I seem to need at the moment is a restorative stroll along the Embankment. Do you know, Sir Chester Portwood didn't like the title of my play. He said 'Tried by Fire' was too melodramatic. Well, he can't say now it wasn't appropriate.\"  They made their way towards the river, avoiding the street which was blocked by the crowds and the fire-engines. As they crossed the Strand, the man looked back. A red glow was in the sky.  \"A great blaze!\" he said. \"What you might call--in fact what the papers _will_ call--a holocaust. Quite a treat for the populace.\"  \"Do you think they will be able to put it out?\"  \"Not a chance. It's got too much of a hold. It's a pity you hadn't that garden-hose of yours with you, isn't it?\"  Jill stopped, wide-eyed.  \"Garden-hose?\"  \"Don't you remember the garden-hose? I do! I can feel that clammy feeling of the water trickling down my back now!\"  Memory, always a laggard by the wayside that redeems itself by an eleventh-hour rush, raced back to Jill. The Embankment turned to a sun-lit garden, and the January night to a July day. She stared at him. He was looking at her with a whimsical smile. It was a smile which, pleasant to-day, had seemed mocking and hostile on that afternoon years ago. She had always felt then that he was laughing at her, and at the age of twelve she had resented laughter at her expense.  \"You surely can't be Wally Mason!\" \"I was wondering when you would remember.\" \"But the programme called you something else--John something.\"  \"That was a cunning disguise. Wally Mason is the only genuine and official name. And, by Jove! I've just remembered yours. It was Mariner. By the way,\"--he paused for an almost imperceptible instant--\"is it still?\"     CHAPTER IV  THE LAST OF THE ROOKES TAKES A HAND  I   Jill was hardly aware that he had asked her a question. She was suffering that momentary sense of unreality which comes to us when the years roll away and we are thrown abruptly back into the days of our childhood. The logical side of her mind was quite aware that there was nothing remarkable in the fact that Wally Mason, who had been to her all these years a boy in an Eton suit, should now present himself as a grown man. But for all that the transformation had something of the effect of a conjuring-trick. It was not only the alteration in his appearance that startled her: it was the amazing change in his personality. Wally Mason had been the _bête noire_ of her childhood. She had never failed to look back at the episode of the garden-hose with the feeling that she had acted well, that--however she might have strayed in those early days from the straight and narrow path--in that one particular crisis she had done the right thing. And now she had taken an instant liking for him. Easily as she made friends, she had seldom before felt so immediately drawn to a strange man. Gone was the ancient hostility, and in its place a soothing sense of comradeship. The direct effect of this was to make Jill feel suddenly old. It was as if some link that joined her to her childhood had been snapped.  She glanced down the Embankment. Close by, to the left, Waterloo Bridge loomed up, dark and massive against the"]]]
