[Illustration: Border]  THE DEVIL    Along de road from Bord à Plouffe     To Kaz-a-baz-u-a   W'ere poplar trees lak sojers stan',   An' all de lan' is pleasan' lan',   In off de road dere leev's a man     Call Louis Desjardins.    An' Louis, w'en he firse begin     To work hees leetle place,   He work so hard de neighbors say,   \"Unless he tak's de easy way   Dat feller 's sure to die some day,     We see it on hees face.\"    'T was lak a swamp, de farm he got,     De water ev'ryw'ere--   Might drain her off as tight as a drum.   An' back dat water is boun' to come   In less 'n a day or two--ba Gum!     'T would mak' de angel swear.    So Louis t'ink of de bimeby,     If he leev' so long as dat,   W'en he 's ole an' blin' an' mebbe deaf,   All alone on de house hese'f,   No frien', no money, no not'ing lef',     An' poor--can't kip a cat.    So wan of de night on winter tam,     W'en Louis is on hees bed,   He say out loud lak a crazy man,   \"I 'm sick of tryin' to clear dis lan',   Work any harder I can't stan',     Or it will kill me dead.    \"Now if de devil would show hese'f     An' say to me, 'Tiens! Louis!   Hard tam an' work she 's at an' en',   You 'll leev' lak a Grand Seigneur ma frien',   If only you 'll be ready w'en     I want you to come wit' me.'    \"I 'd say, 'Yass, yass--'maudit! w'at 's dat?'     An' he see de devil dere--   Brimstone, ev'ryt'ing bad dat smell,   You know right away he 's come from--well,   De place I never was care to tell--     An' wearin' hees long black hair,    Lak election man, de kin' I mean     You see aroun' church door,   Spreadin' hese'f on great beeg speech   'Bout poor man 's goin' some day be reech,   But dat 's w'ere it alway come de heetch,     For poor man 's alway poor.    De only diff'rence--me--I see     'Tween devil an' long-hair man   It 's hard to say, but I know it 's true,   W'en devil promise a t'ing to do   Dere 's no mistak', he kip it too--     I hope you understan'.    So de devil spik, \"You 're not content,     An' want to be reech, Louis--   All right, you 'll have plaintee, never fear,   No wan can beat you far an' near,   An' I 'll leave you alone for t'orty year,     An' den you will come wit' me.    \"Be careful now--it 's beeg contrac',     So mebbe it 's bes' go slow;   For me--de promise I mak' to you   Is good as de bank Rivière du Loup   For you--w'enever de tam is due,     Ba tonder! you got to go.\"    Louis try hard to tak' hees tam     But w'en he see de fall   Comin' along in a week or so,   All aroun' heem de rain an' snow   An' pork on de bar'l runnin' low,     He don't feel good at all.    An' w'en he t'ink of de swampy farm     An' gettin' up winter night,   Watchin' de stove if de win' get higher   For fear de chimley go on fire,   It's makin' poor Louis feel so tire     He tell de devil, \"All right.\"    \"Correct,\" dat feller say right away,     \"I 'll only say, Au revoir,\"   An' out of de winder he 's goin' pouf!   Beeg nose, long hair, short tail, an' hoof,   Off on de road to Bord à Plouffe     Crossin' de reever dere.    W'en Louis get up nex' day, ma frien',     Dere 's lot of devil sign--   Bar'l o' pork an' keg o' rye,   Bag o' potato ten foot high,   Pile o' wood nearly touch de sky,     Was some o' de t'ing he fin'.    Suit o' clothes would have cos' a lot     An' ev'ryt'ing I dunno,   Trotter horse w'en he want to ride   Eatin' away on de barn outside,   Stan' all day if he 's never tied,     An' watch an' chain also.    An' swamp dat's bodder heem many tam,     W'ere is dat swamp to-day?   Don't care if you 're huntin' up an' down   You won't fin' not'ing but medder groun',   An' affer de summer come aroun'     W'ere can you see such hay?    Wall! de year go by, an' Louis leev'     Widout no work to do,   Rise w'en he lak on winter day,   Fin' all de snow is clear away,   No fuss, no not'ing, dere 's de sleigh     An' trotter waitin' too.    W'en t'orty year is nearly t'roo     An' devil 's not come back   'Course Louis say, 'Wall! he forget   Or t'ink de tam 's not finish yet;   I 'll tak' ma chance an' never fret,\"     But dat 's w'ere he mak' mistak'.    For on a dark an' stormy night     W'en Louis is sittin' dere,   After he fassen up de door   De devil come as he come before,   Lookin' de sam' only leetle more,     For takin' heem--you know w'ere.    \"Asseyez vous, sit down, ma frien',     Bad night be on de road;   You come long way an' should be tire--   Jus' wait an' mebbe I feex de fire--   Tak' off your clothes for mak' dem drier,     Dey mus' be heavy load.\"    Dat 's how poor Louis Desjardins     Talk to de devil, sir--   Den say, \"Try leetle w'isky blanc,   Dey 're makin' it back on St. Laurent--   It 's good for night"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20609"],["title","The Voyageur and Other Poems (#2)"],["body"," 's cole an' raw,\"     But devil never stir,    Until he smell de smell dat come     W'en Louis mak' it hot   Wit' sugar, spice, an' ev'ryt'ing.   Enough to mak' a man's head sing--   For winter, summer, fall an' spring--     It 's very bes' t'ing we got.    An' so de devil can't refuse     To try de w'isky blanc,   An' say, \"I 'm tryin' many drink,   An' dis is de fines' I don't t'ink,   De firse, ba tonder! mak' me wink--     Hooraw, pour Canadaw!\"    \"Merci--non, non--I tak' no more,\"     De devil say at las',   \"For tam is up wit' you, Louis,   So come along, ma frien', wit' me,   So many star I 'm sure I see,     De storm she mus' be pas'.\"    \"No hurry--wait a minute, please,\"     Say Louis Desjardins,   \"We 'll have a smoke before we 're t'roo,   'T will never hurt mese'f or you   To try a pipe, or mebbe two,     Of tabac Canayen.\" [1]    \"Wan pipe is all I want for me--     We 'll finish our smoke downstair,\"   De devil say, an' it was enough,   For w'en he tak' de very firse puff   He holler out, \"Maudit! w'at stuff!     Fresh air! fresh air!! fresh air!!!\"    An' oh! he was never sick before     Till he smoke tabac Bruneau--   Can't walk or fly, but he want fresh air,   So Louis put heem on rockin' chair   An' t'row heem off on de road out dere--     An' tole heem go below.    An' he shut de door an' fill de place     Wit' tabac Canayen,   An' never come out, an' dat 's a fac'--   But smoke away till hees face is black--   So dat 's w'y de devil don't come back     For Louis Desjardins.    An' dere he 's yet, an' dere he 'll stay--     So weech of de two 'll win   Can't say for dat--it 's kin' of a doubt,   For Louis, de pipe never leave hees mout',   An' night or day can't ketch heem out,     An' devil 's too scare go in.

Wit' pole on de han' lak de lumberman,     A-shovin' along canoe.   Dere 's purty strong current behin' de stove,     W'ere it 's passin' de chimley-stone,   But he 'll come roun' yet, if he don't upset,     So long he was lef' alone.    Dat 's way ev'ry boy on de house begin     No sooner he 's twelve mont' ole;   He 'll play canoe up an' down de Soo     An' paddle an' push de pole,   Den haul de log all about de place,     Till dey 're fillin' up mos' de room,   An' say it 's all right, for de storm las' night     Was carry away de boom.    Mebbe you see heem, de young loon bird,     Wit' half of de shell hangin' on,   Tak' hees firse slide to de water side,     An' off on de lake he 's gone.   Out of de cradle dey 're goin' sam' way     On reever an' lake an' sea;   For born to de trade, dat 's how dey 're made,     De familee Laramie.    An' de reever she 's lyin' so handy dere     On foot of de hill below,   Dancin' along an' singin' de song     As away to de sea she go,   No wonder I never can lak dat song,     For soon it is comin', w'en   Dey 'll lissen de call, leetle Pierre an' Paul,     An' w'ere will de moder be den?    She 'll sit by de shore w'en de evenin's come,     An' spik to de reever too:   \"O reever, you know how dey love you so,     Since ever dey 're seein' you,   For sake of dat love bring de leetle boy home     Once more to de moder's knee.\"   An' mebbe de prayer I be makin' dere     Will help bring dem back to me.     [Illustration: Border]  Yankee Families    You s'pose God love de Yankee     An' de Yankee woman too,   Lak he love de folk at home on Canadaw?     I dunno--'cos if he do,   W'at 's de reason he don't geev' dem familee   Is dere anybody hangin' roun' can answer me   Wile I wait an' smoke dis pipe of good tabac?    An' now I 'll tole you somet'ing     Mebbe help you bimeby,   An' dere 's no mistak' it 's w'at dey call sure sign--     W'en you miss de baby's cry   As you 're goin' mak' some visit on de State   Dat 's enough--you need n't ax if de train 's on tam or late,   You can bet you 're on de Yankee side de line.    Unless dere 's oder folk dere,     Mebbe wan or two or t'ree,   Canayen is comin' workin' on de State--     Den you see petite Marie   Leetle Joe an' Angelique, Hormisdas an' Dieudonné,   But you can't tole half de nam'--it don't matter any way--   'Sides de fader he don't t'ink it's not'ing great.    De moder, you can see her     An' she got de basket dere   Wit' de fine t'ing for de chil'ren nice an' slick--     For dey can't get fat on air--   Cucumber, milk, an' onion, some leetle cake also   De ole gran'moder 's makin' on de farm few days ago--   W'at 's use buy dollar dinner mak' dem sick?    But look de Yankee woman     Wit' de book upon her han',   Readin', readin', an' her husban', he can't get     Any chance at all, poor man,   For sit down, de way de seat's all pile up wit' magazine--   De t'ing lak dat on Canadaw is never, never seen.   Would n't she be better wit' some chil'ren?  Wall! you bet!    No wonder dey was bringin'     For helpin' dem along   So many kin' of feller I dunno--     Chinee washee from Kong Kong   An' w'at dey call Da-go, was work for dollar a day,   But w'en dey mak' some money, off dey 're goin', right away--   Dat 's de reason dey was get de nam' Da-go.    Of course so long dey 're comin'     From ev'ry place dey can,   Not knowin' moche, dere 's not'ing fuss about     Only boss de stranger man--   But now dem gang of feller dat 's come across de sea--   He 's gettin' leetle smarter, an' he got de familee--   So Uncle Sam mus' purty soon look out.    I wonder he don't know it--     It 's funny he don't see   Dere 's somet'ing else dan money day an' night--     Non--he 'll work hese'f cra-zee,   Den travel roun' de worl', an' use de money too--   De King hese'f can't spen' lak de Yankee man is do--   But w'ere 's de leetle chil'ren? dat's not right!    W'at 's use of all de money     If dere ain't some boy an' girl   Mak' it pleasan' for de Yankee an' hees wife     W'en dey travel on de worl'?   For me an' Eugenie dere 's not'ing we lak bes'   Dan gader up de chil'ren an' get dem nicely dress--   W'y it 's more dan half de pleasure of our life.    I love de Yankee woman     An' de Yankee man also,   An' mebbe dey 'll be wiser bimeby--     But I lak dem all to know   If dey want to kip deir own, let dem raise de familee--   An' den dey 'll boss de contree from de mountain to de sea,   For dey 're smart enough to do it if dey try.
