He died from the exposure of that night.  But a smile was on his face as I sat beside him.\"  Now, why did the soldier smile?  You know.  He was rejoicing that he was able to spare and to share the suffering of his friend.  \"I long to share in His sufferings.\"  That is the language of love.  To one who does not know love it will forever be a mystery.  But to the lover it is easily comprehensible.  Any real mother can understand it. Down in Tennessee a few years ago a mother was out riding with her little boy.  The horse took fright and ran away.  The buggy was wrecked.  The mother escaped without injury.  But the little lad was so crippled that he was never able to sit up again.  Now, before this tragic accident the mother of this little wounded boy had been very active in the life of her Church and community.  But with the coming of this great sorrow she had to give up all outside work. She gave herself instead night and day to the nursing of her boy.  At times she would hold the little fellow in her arms for almost the whole night through.  At last, after three years, the angel of release came and the patient sufferer went home.  And there were those in the community who said, \"I know that his mother will grieve.  Yet his home-going must be a bit of a relief.\"  But what said the mother when the minister went to see her?  She met the preacher at the door and as love's sweet rain ran down her face she did not say anything about being relieved at all.  But this is what she said: \"Oh, Brother, my little boy is gone and I can't get to do anything for him any more.\"  Why, it was the grief of her heart that the little fellow had gone out beyond the reach of her hand where she could no longer have the joy of offering herself a living sacrifice upon the altar of his need.  She longed to continually share in his suffering.  So Paul wanted to share in the sufferings of Christ because he loved Christ.  Then he wanted to share in the sufferings of Christ, in the second place, because he knew that suffering was involved in being like Christ.  You may suffer and yet be un-Christlike, but no man can be Christlike and fail to suffer.  If you ever, by the grace of God, become a partaker of the divine nature you must also inevitably become a partaker of His sufferings.  To be Christlike is to suffer for the very simple reason that Christ cannot be what He is and fail to suffer in and for a world like ours. What is the nature of Christ?  Christ is like God.  Christ is God.  \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"  But what is God?  There are many definitions.  There is only one all comprehensive and all inclusive definition.  That is that sentence of pure gold that fell from the lips of the apostle that leaned upon the bosom of his Lord. \"What is God?\" I ask this man who had such a wonderful knowledge of Him.  And he answers, \"God is love.\"  Now since God is love He must suffer.  He cannot look upon the lost and ruined of this world without grief.  He cannot behold the tragic quarrel of man with Himself without taking it to heart.  There is nothing more true nor, in the deepest sense, more reasonable than this tender sentence: \"In all their afflictions He was afflicted.\"  Our afflictions must afflict Him because \"His nature and His name is love.\"  J. Wilbur Chapman tells how he one night explored the slums of New York with Sam Hadley.  About one o'clock in the morning they separated to go to their own homes.  Dr. Chapman said he had not gone far before he heard Mr. Hadley saying, \"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!\"  And he looked back to see his friend wringing his hands in deepest agony.  He hurried to his side thinking that he had been taken suddenly ill.  \"What is the matter?\" he asked.  And the great mission worker turned his pain-pinched face back toward the slums out of which they had come and said, \"Oh, the sin! Oh, the heartache!  Oh, the wretchedness!  It will break my heart.  It has broken my heart.\"  Now, just as Christ cannot be Christ and not suffer in a world like ours, so He cannot be Himself and fail to make a sacrificial effort to save this world.  What says the gem of the Gospel?  \"God so loved the world that He gave.\"  What was the song that abidingly made Paul's heart to pulsate with heavenly hallelujahs?  Just this: \"He loved me and gave Himself for me.\"  Love grieves.  It does more.  It serves. Love beholds the city and weeps over it.  But it is not satisfied with that.  It also goes to the Cross for that city over which it weeps. Sam Hadley wrings his hands in grief over the wretched in New York's slums, but he does more.  He goes to their rescue.  So when Paul said, \"I long to share His sufferings\" he meant, \"I long to be, in the truest sense, like Him.  I long to see the world through His eyes.  I long to feel toward men as Christ feels toward them.  I long to sacrifice for them in my finite way as He sacrificed for them.\" And what was the outcome of this longing?  There are some ambitions that God cannot gratify.  To do so would only mean our impoverishment and our ruin.  But such is not the case here.  God graciously granted the satisfying of this longing of Saint Paul.  Listen to the testimony to the truth of that fact from his own lips. \"I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live.  Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\"  Again he says, \"For to me to live is Christ.\" That is, \"For to me to live is to reproduce Christ.  For to me to live is for Christ to live over again in me.\"  In a most profound and vital sense he has come to share in the divine nature.  Having come to share in the divine nature he is privileged also to share in His sufferings.  His ministry is a daily dying.  He is a man of great heaviness and continual sorrow.  The secret of his pain is this: \"I fill up that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ in my body.\"  In sharing thus his Master's sufferings he shared with him in His work of bringing salvation to men.  To-day we could better spare many a nation than we could spare this one single man.  And now we are going to gather about this altar where we shall remember together the suffering love of Jesus Christ.  As we take the bread and wine we are going to be reminded of the broken body and shed blood of our Lord.  And I trust that as we think upon His love and upon His sacrifice for ourselves we shall come to be possessed with the holy longing of this great apostle.  May we too be able to say, \"I long to share in His suffering.\"  This high longing is possible for every one of us through the riches of His grace.  And it is possible in no other way.  Therefore, let us gather round this table with this song within our hearts:    \"Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;     Come quickly from above,   Write thy new name upon my heart,     Thy new, best name of Love.\"     V  GOING VISITING--JONATHAN  _I Samuel 23:16_  \"And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in God.\"  \"Going visiting\" is a very commonplace occurrence.  Oftentimes the visits we make are thoroughly trivial and unimportant.  But there are other times when our visits take on a profound significance.  There are times when they mark a crisis.  There are times when they set in motion influences that tell on the entire future of those whom we visit.  There are times when they mean the making or the marring of a human soul.  Now, this visit about which we are to study to-day is no ordinary visit.  I think it is one of the most beautiful stories to be found in literature.  This visit was made many centuries ago.  It was made in an obscure corner of the earth, and yet it has never been forgotten.  It never will be.  The Inspirer of the Word saw in it too much of worth and winsomeness to allow it to slip out of the memories of men.  It is remembered to-day, not because Jonathan left his calling card on David's center table.  It is remembered because the visit was so blessedly beautiful.  It is a great privilege that God has given us in allowing us to visit each other.  We can help so much by it if we will.  Wasn't that a lovely visit that the old school master made to Marget that time in \"Beside the Bonny Briar Bush\" when he came to tell her that she had a \"laddie of parts\"?  And wasn't it still more beautiful when he came later, rugged old Scotchman that he was, to burst into tears of wild joy over the good news he brought her that her son had won first prize in the great university?  Wasn't that a lovely series of visits that a kindly old man made to the room of the little laddie who had swept the street crossing before he had been crippled in the discharge of his duty?  A city missionary went in to see him and asked him if he had had anybody to visit him.  \"Oh, yes,\" was the answer.  \"A good man comes every day and talks to me, and sometimes he reads the Bible to me and prays.\"  \"What is his name?\" asked the missionary.  And the little fellow studied a moment and said, \"I think he said his name was Gladstone.\"  England's grand old man appears to us in many a charming role, but in none is he more manly and commanding than in this of visiting a little crippled waif in a London attic.  Florence Nightingale was a lovely visitor.  Do you recall that exquisite bit of poetry in conduct on the field of Crimea?  A soldier was to go through a painful operation.  An anaesthetic could not be administered and the doctor said the patient could not endure the operation.  \"Yes, I can,\" said the patient, \"under one condition: if you will get the 'Angel of the Crimea' to hold my hand.\"  And she came out to the little hospital at the front and held his hand.  Glorious visit.  No wonder the man went through the operation without a tremor.  But the visit of our text,--to me it is more wonderful still.  The truth of the matter is, I know of but one other visit that ever took place that is finer and more beautiful.  You know"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20578"],["title","Sermons on Biblical Characters (#8)"],["body","visit that was. It was the visit that One made to a manger in Bethlehem nineteen centuries ago.  That was a visit that remade the world.  It was so wonderful that a star pointed it out with finger of silver, and our discordant old earth was serenaded with the music of that land of eternal melody.  But aside from that one visit, I think this the most beautiful one ever recorded.  What is the secret of its beauty?  First, it was beautiful in its courageous loyalty.  You know who Jonathan was.  He was the King's son. He was popular, handsome and courageous.  So lithe, athletic and graceful he was that they called him \"the gazelle.\"  He was a prince. He was heir-apparent to the throne of Israel.  And you know, also, who David was.  He was at that time in disgrace. He was under the frown of the King.  He was being hunted from one refuge to another like a wild beast.  To be his friend was to be the enemy of the King.  To smile upon him was to meet the frown of the King.  But notwithstanding the fact that these men were so far apart, one a favorite prince and the other an outcast peasant, yet we find the prince visiting the peasant.  You say they were friends.  Yes, that is true, deeply true.  But their friendship had started in other days. When David and Jonathan first met they met under altogether different circumstances.  You know when Jonathan first saw David.  It was when David returned from his fight with Goliath, with the bloody head of the giant in his hand.  He met him amidst the hurrahs and the wild enthusiasm of the people.  He met him on one of the great red letter days of David's life, when he sprang suddenly from obscurity to be a national hero.  It does not seem so surprising, therefore, when we read that on this day \"the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David.\"  David was courageous.  David had shown himself a hero.  David was a favorite with the King and a favorite with the people.  It took no great effort to love him then.  It took no great courage to be his friend.  But all is changed now.  The King no longer loves him, but hates him and seeks his life.  The sun of his popularity has gone into eclipse.  We wonder if Jonathan's friendship will stand the test.  And again we turn and read the text: \"And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in God.\" What beautiful loyalty.  What fine fidelity.  How blessed is David in the friendship of a man who can love him in the sunshine and who can love him no less in the midst of the shadows.  How blessed he is in the friendship of one who can stand by him when many lips praise him and who can also stand by him when many abuse him, and many criticise him and many lift their hands against him.  Truly this man loves David for himself alone.  Second, this visit is beautiful because of its fine and costly sympathy.  Jonathan really sympathized with David in his trials and his difficulties.  He did not express that sympathy in any cheap and distant way.  He might have sent David word that if he needed anything just to let him know.  He might have dispatched a servant to comfort David in his sore trials.  But he did not try to express his sympathy at long distance.  He went to David.  He came to handclasp with the man that he wished to help.  Now, I am perfectly aware of the fact that much of our sympathy must be expressed at a distance.  For instance, we cannot all go to the foreign field.  We must express our interest in those who have not had our opportunities by our gifts.  Much of the service we render in our own land must be rendered in the same way.  But when that is said, the fact still remains that there is nothing that will take the place of our hand-to-hand dealing with those who need us.  We cannot perform all our charities by proxy.  We must come in personal contact with those whom we would help.  There is one poem I think that we have a bit overworked:    \"Let me live in my house by the side of the road,   Where the race of men go by.   They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,   Wise, foolish--and so am I.   So why should I sit in the scorner's seat,   Or hurl the cynic's ban?   Let me live in my house by the side of the road,   And be a friend to man.    \"I see from my house by the side of the road,   By the side of the highway of life,   The men that press on with the ardor of hope,   And the men who are faint in the strife.   But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears,   Both parts of an infinite plan.   Let me live in my house by the side of the road,   And be a friend to man.    \"I know there are brook gladdened meadows ahead,   And mountains of wearisome height.   And the road passes on through the long afternoon,   And stretches away to the night.   But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,   And weep with the strangers that moan,   Nor live in my house by the side of the road,   Like one who dwells alone.\"   Now that is good, but after all,--    \"It's only a half truth the poet has sung   Of the house by the side of the way.   Our Master had neither a house nor a home,   But He walked with the crowd day by day.   I think when I read of the poet's desire   That a house by the road would be good,   But service is found in its tenderest form   As we walk with the crowd in the road.    \"So I say let me walk with the men in the road,   Let me seek out the burdens that crush;   Let me speak a kind word of good cheer to the weak   Who are falling behind in the rush.   There are wounds to be healed, there are breaks we must mend,   There are cups of cold water to give,   And the man in the road by the side of his friend,   Is the man who has learned how to give.    \"Then tell me no more of the house by the road,   There is only one place I can live.   It is there where the men are toiling along,   Who are needing the help I can give.   'Tis pleasant to dwell in the house by the road,   And be a friend, as the poet has said,   But the Master is bidding us, Bear ye their load,   Your rest waiteth yonder ahead.    \"So I can not remain in the house by the road,   And watch as the toilers pass on,   Their faces beclouded with pain and with shame,   So burdened, their strength nearly gone.   I will go to their side, I will speak in good cheer,   I will help them to carry their load.   And I'll smile at the man in the house by the way,   While I walk with the crowd in the road.    \"Out there in the road that runs by the house   Where the poet is singing his song,   I'll walk and I'll work midst the heat of the day,   And I'll help falling brothers along.   Too busy to dwell in the house by the way,   Too happy for such an abode,   And my glad heart will sing to the Master of all,   Who is helping me serve in the road.\"   And the beauty and glory of this lovely visit that Prince Jonathan made to David, the outcast, was that he walked with him in the road.  He did not dwell in his princely palace and send him some money.  He did not allow him, as Dives allowed Lazarus, to gather up the crumbs.  He went to him.  And because he went to him he helped him.  Oh, heart, that is the secret of the salvation wrought by our Lord.  He came to us.  Had He merely come for the day and gone back to Heaven at night, He would never have saved us.  He came into personal contact with us.  That is how He lifts us.  This visit was beautiful, in the third place, because of its high and holy purpose.  I see Jonathan as he is turning his face toward the forest where David is hiding.  I say to him, \"Prince Jonathan, you are going down to see David, I understand.  Why are you going?\"  This is his answer: \"I am going down to strengthen his hand in God.  You know David has had a hard time recently.  He has been sorely tried.  He has been bitterly disappointed.  He has passed through one great sorrow after another.  I am afraid his faith is going to be destroyed.  I am afraid he will lose his grip of God unless I go to see him and help him and strengthen his hand in the Lord.  And that is why I am going.\"  And so Jonathan hurries on.  And the angels must have crowded the windows of heaven to behold him as he walked upon this glorious errand. I would go a bit out of my way any time to get to see a man who is going to see his friend, not to ask for help, but going for the one big purpose of making the man whom he is to visit a little stronger, a little better, a little more loyal to his Lord.  And not only did Jonathan go for that purpose, but he succeeded in it. When he left David, he left him a stronger man.  I do not know what he said to him.  That is not recorded.  I do not know that he quoted scripture to him or even prayed with him.  He may have.  He may not have.  It is not absolutely necessary to have prayer always in order to strengthen our friend in the Lord.  Sometimes all we need to do is just to talk to him and let him talk, and convince him that we sympathize with him, that we are interested in him.  And having done that, somehow he comes more and more to believe in God's interest.  But whatever Jonathan said, David was stronger and better and braver after he had gone.  I think I can hear him as he looks after the retreating figure going through the forest.  And what he is saying to himself is this, \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name.\"  And I think when the books are balanced in Heaven that Jonathan will get quite a bit of credit for David's exquisite music.  There are terrible clashes in his songs.  \"He that did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me.\"  Jonathan did not inspire that.  But there is many a blessed passage that might never have been written but for the loyal and loving and constant friendship of Prince Jonathan.  And last of all, this visit was beautiful in its self-forgetfulness. Its beauty reached its climax here.  Just think of the circumstances. Samuel, the prophet, has declared that David is to be king.
