Biographers have differed as to the date of the birth of Lamarck.[2] Happily the exact date had been ascertained through the researches of M. Philippe Salmon; and M. Duval kindly showed us in the thin volume of records, with its tattered and torn leaves, the register of the _Acte de Naissance_, and made a copy of it, as follows:    _Extrait du Registre aux Actes de Baptême de la Commune de Bazentin,   pour l'Année 1744._    L'an mil sept cent quarante-quatre, le premier août est né en   légitime mariage et le lendemain a été baptisé par moy curé   soussigné Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine, fils de Messire Jacques   Philippe de Monet, chevalier de Lamarck, seigneur des Bazentin grand   et petit et de haute et puissante Dame Marie Françoise de Fontaine   demeurant en leur château de Bazentin le petit, son parrain a été   Messire Jean Baptiste de Fossé, prêtre-chanoine de l'église   collégiale de St. Farcy de Péronne, y demeurant, sa marraine Dame   Antoinette Françoise de Bucy, nièce de Messire Louis Joseph   Michelet, chevalier, ancien commissaire de l'artillerie de France   demeurante au château de Guillemont, qui ont signé avec mon dit   sieur de Bazentin et nous.    Ont signé: De Fossé, De Bucy Michelet, Bazentin. Cozette, curé.  [Illustration: ACT OF BIRTH]  Of Lamarck's parentage and ancestry there are fortunately some traces. In the _Registre aux Actes de Baptême pour l'Année 1702_, still preserved in the _mairie_ of Bazentin-le-Petit, the record shows that his father was born in February, 1702, at Bazentin. The infant was baptised February 16, 1702, the permission to the _curé_ by Henry, Bishop of Amiens, having been signed February 3, 1702. Lamarck's grandparents were, according to this certificate of baptism, Messire Philippe de Monet de Lamarck, Ecuyer, Seigneur des Bazentin, and Dame Magdeleine de Lyonne.  The family of Lamarck, as stated by H. Masson,[3] notwithstanding his northern and almost Germanic name of Chevalier de Lamarck, originated in the southwest of France. Though born at Bazentin, in old Picardy, it is not less true that he descended on the paternal side from an ancient house of Béarn, whose patrimony was very modest. This house was that of Monet.  Another genealogist, Baron C. de Cauna,[4] tells us that there is no doubt that the family of Monet in Bigorre[5] was divided. One of its representatives formed a branch in Picardy in the reign of Louis XIV. or later.  Lamarck's grandfather, Philippe de Monet, \"seigneur de Bazentin et autres lieux,\" was also \"chevalier de l'ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Louis, commandant pour le roi en la ville et château de Dinan, pensionnaire de sa majesté.\"  The descendants of Philippe de Lamarck were, adds de Cauna, thus thrown into two branches, or at least two offshoots or stems (_brisures_), near Péronne. But the actual posterity of the Monet of Picardy was reduced to a single family, claiming back, with good reason, to a southern origin. One of its scions in the maternal line was a brilliant officer of the military marine and also son-in-law of a very distinguished naval officer.  The family of Monet was represented among the French nobility of 1789 by Messires de Monet de Caixon and de Monet de Saint-Martin. By marriage their grandson was connected with an honorable family of Montant, near Saint-Sever-Cap.  Another authority, the Abbé J. Dulac, has thrown additional light on the genealogy of the de Lamarck family, which, it may be seen, was for at least three centuries a military one.[6] The family of Monet, Seigneur de Saint-Martin et de Sombran, was maintained as a noble one by order of the Royal Council of State of June 20, 1678. He descended (I) from Bernard de Monet, esquire, captain of the château of Lourdes, who had as a son (II) Étienne de Monet, esquire, who, by contract dated August 15, 1543, married Marguerite de Sacaze. He was the father of (III) Pierre de Monet, esquire, \"Seigneur d'Ast, en Béarn, guidon des gendarmes de la compagnie du roi de Navarre.\" From him descended (IV) Étienne de Monet, esquire, second of the name, \"Seigneur d'Ast et Lamarque, de Julos.\" He was a captain by rank, and bought the estate of Saint-Martin in 1592. He married, in 1612, Jeanne de Lamarque, daughter of William de Lamarck, \"Seigneur de Lamarque et de Bretaigne.\" They had three children, the third of whom was Philippe, \"chevalier de Saint-Louis, commandant du château de Dinan, Seigneur de Bazentin, en Picardy,\" who, as we have already seen, was the father of the naturalist Lamarck, who lived from 1744 to 1829. The abbé relates that Philippe, the father of the naturalist, was born at Saint-Martin, in the midst of Bigorre, \"_in pleine Bigorre_,\" and he very neatly adds that \"the Bigorrais have the right to claim for their land of flowers one of the glories of botany.\"[7]  The name was at first variously spelled de Lamarque, de la Marck, or de Lamarck. He himself signed his name, when acting as secretary of the Assembly of Professors-administrative of the Museum of Natural History during the years of the First Republic, as plain Lamarck.  The inquiry arises how, being the eleventh child, he acquired the title of chevalier, which would naturally have become extinct with the death of the oldest son. The Abbé Dulac suggests that the ten older of the children had died, or that by some family arrangement he was allowed to add the domanial name to the patronymic one. Certainly he never tarnished the family name, which, had it not been for him, would have remained in obscurity.  As to his father's tastes and disposition, what influence his mother had in shaping his character, his home environment, as the youngest of eleven children, the nature of his education in infancy and boyhood, there are no sources of information. But several of his brothers entered the army, and the domestic atmosphere was apparently a military one.  Philippe de Lamarck, with his large family, had endowed his first-born son so that he could maintain the family name and title, and had found situations for several of the others in the army. Jean Lamarck did not manifest any taste for the clerical profession. He lived in a martial atmosphere. For centuries his ancestors had borne arms. His eldest brother had been killed in the breach at the siege of Berg-op-Zoom; two others were still in the service, and in the troublous times at the beginning of the war in 1756, a young man of high spirit and courage would naturally not like to relinquish the prospect of renown and promotion. But, yielding to the wishes of his father, he entered as a student at the college of the Jesuits at Amiens.[8]  His father dying in 1760, nothing could induce the incipient abbé, then seventeen years of age, to longer wear his bands. Immediately on returning home he bought himself a wretched horse, for want of means to buy a better one, and, accompanied by a poor lad of his village, he rode across the country to join the French army, then campaigning in Germany.  [Illustration: AUTOGRAPH OF LAMARCK, JANUARY 25, 1802  je prie le Citoyen qui assemble dans le Magazin de l'imprimerie du Citoyen Agasse de remettre à Madame chevalier Cent exemplaires de mon hydrogeologie, pour les Brocher.  Paris le 5 pluviose an dix  Lamarck]  He carried with him a letter of recommendation from one of his neighbors on an adjoining estate in the country, Madame de Lameth, to M. de Lastic, colonel of the regiment of Beaujolais.[9]    \"We can imagine [says Cuvier] the feelings of this officer on thus   finding himself hampered with a boy whose puny appearance made him   seem still younger than he was. However, he sent him to his   quarters, and then busied himself with his duties. The period indeed   was a critical one. It was the 16th of July, 1761. The Marshal   de Broglie had just united his army with that of the Prince   de Soubise, and the next day was to attack the allied army commanded   by the Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the break of day M.   de Lastic rode along the front of his corps, and the first man that   met his gaze was the new recruit, who, without saying anything to   him, had placed himself in the front rank of a company of   grenadiers, and nothing could induce him to quit his post.    \"It is a matter of history that this battle, which bears the name of   the little village of Fissingshausen, between Ham and Lippstadt, in   Westphalia, was lost by the French, and that the two generals,   mutually accusing each other of this defeat, immediately separated,   and abandoned the campaign.    \"During the movement of the battle, de Lamarck's company was   stationed in a position exposed to the direct fire of the enemy's   artillery. In the confusion of the retreat he was forgotten. Already   all the officers and non-commissioned officers had been killed;   there remained only fourteen men, when the oldest grenadier, seeing   that there were no more of the French troops in sight, proposed to   the young volunteer, become so promptly commander, to withdraw his   little troop. 'But we are assigned to this post,' said the boy, 'and   we should not withdraw from it until we are relieved.' And he made   them remain there until the colonel, seeing that the squad did not   rally, sent him an orderly, who crept by all sorts of covered ways   to reach him. This bold stand having been reported to the marshal,   he promoted him on the field to the rank of an officer, although his   order had prescribed that he should be very chary of these kinds of   promotions.\"  His physical courage shown at this age was paralleled by his moral courage in later years. The staying power he showed in immovably adhering to his views on evolution through many years, and under the direct and raking fire of harsh and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],["title","Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#3)"],["body","criticism and ridicule from friend and foe, affords a striking contrast to the moral timidity shown by Buffon when questioned by the Sorbonne. We can see that Lamarck was the stuff martyrs are made of, and that had he been tried for heresy he would have been another Tycho Brahe.  Soon after, de Lamarck was nominated to a lieutenancy; but so glorious a beginning of his military career was most unexpectedly checked. A sudden accident forced him to leave the service and entirely change his course of life. His regiment had been, during peace, sent into garrison, first at Toulon and then at Monaco. While there a comrade in play lifted him by the head; this gave rise to an inflammation of the lymphatic glands of the neck, which, not receiving the necessary attention on the spot, obliged him to go to Paris for better treatment.    \"The united efforts [says Cuvier] of several surgeons met with no   better success, and danger had become very imminent, when our   _confrère_, the late M. Tenon, with his usual sagacity, recognized   the trouble, and put an end to it by a complicated operation, of   which M. de Lamarck preserved deep scars. This treatment lasted for   a year, and, during this time, the extreme scantiness of his   resources confined him to a solitary life, when he had the leisure   to devote himself to meditations.\"   FOOTNOTES:  [1] In the little chapel next the church lies buried, we were told by M. Duval, a Protestant of the family of de Guillebon, the purchaser (_acquéreur_) of the _château_. Whether the estate is now in the hands of his heirs we did not ascertain.  [2] As stated by G. de Mortillet, the date of his birth is variously given. Michaud's _Dictionnaire Biographique_ gives the date April 1; other authors, April 11; others, the correct one, August 1, 1744. (_Lamarck. Par un Groupe de Transformistes, ses Disciples._ _L'Homme_, iv. p. 289, 1887.)

[7] The abbé attempts to answer the question as to what place gave origin to the name of Lamarck, and says:  \"The author of the history of Béarn considered the cradle of the race to have been the freehold of Marca, parish of Gou (Basses-Pyrénées). A branch of the family established in le Magnoac changed its name of Marca to that of La Marque.\" It was M. d'Ossat who gave rise to this change by addressing his letters to M. de Marca (at the time when he was preceptor of his nephew), sometimes under the name of M. Marca, sometimes _M. la Marqua_, or of _M. de la Marca_, but more often still under that of _M. de la Marque_, \"with the object, no doubt, of making him a Frenchman\" (\"_dans la vue sans doute de le franciser_\"). (_Vie du Cardinal d'Ossat_, tome i., p. 319.)  \"To recall their origin, the branch of Magnoac to-day write their name _Marque-Marca_. If the Marca of the historian belongs to Béarn, the Lamarque of the naturalist, an orthographic name in principle, proceeds from Bigorre, actually chosen (_désignée_) by _Lamarcq, Pontacq, or Lamarque près Béarn_. That the _Lamarque_ of the botanist of the royal cabinet distinguished himself from all the _Lamarques_ of Béarn or of Bigorre, which it bears (_qu'il gise_) to this day in the Hautes-Pyrénées, Canton d'Ossun, we have many proofs: Aast at some distance, Bourcat and Couet all near l'Abbaye Laïque, etc. The village so determined is called in turn _Marca_, _La Marque_, _Lamarque_; names predestined to several destinations; judge then to the mercy of a botanist, _Lamarck_, _La Marck_, _Delamarque_, _De Lamarck_, who shall determine their number? As to the last, I only explain it by a fantasy of the man who would de-Bigorrize himself in order to Germanize himself in the hope, apparently, that at the first utterance of the name people would believe that he was from the _outre Rhin_ rather than from the borders of Gave or of Adour. Consequently a hundred times more learned and a hundred times more worthy of a professorship in the Museum, where Monet would seem (_entrevait_) much less than Lamarque.\"  It may be added that Béarn was an ancient province of southern France nearly corresponding to the present Department of Basses-Pyrénées. Its capital was Pau.  [8] We have been unable to ascertain the date when young Lamarck entered the seminary. On making inquiries in June, 1899, at the Jesuits' Seminary in Amiens, one of the faculty, after consultation with the Father Superior, kindly gave us in writing the following information as to the exact date: \"The registers of the great seminary were carried away during the French Revolution, and we do not know whither they have been transported, and whether they still exist to-day. Besides, it is very doubtful whether Lamarck resided here, because only ecclesiastics preparing for receiving orders were received in the seminary. Do you not confound the seminary with the ancient college of Rue Poste de Paris, college now destroyed?\"  [9] We are following the _Éloge_ of Cuvier almost verbatim, also reproduced in the biographical notice in the _Revue biographique de la Société Malacologique de France_, said to have been prepared by J. R. Bourguignat.     CHAPTER II  STUDENT LIFE AND BOTANICAL CAREER   The profession of arms had not led Lamarck to forget the principles of physical science which he had received at college. During his sojourn at Monaco the singular vegetation of that rocky country had attracted his attention, and Chomel's _Traité des Plantes usuelles_ accidentally falling into his hands had given him some smattering of botany.  Lodged at Paris, as he has himself said, in a room much higher up than he could have wished, the clouds, almost the only objects to be seen from his windows, interested him by their ever-changing shapes, and inspired in him his first ideas of meteorology. There were not wanting other objects to excite interest in a mind which had always been remarkably active and original. He then realized, to quote from his biographer, Cuvier, what Voltaire said of Condorcet, that solid enduring discoveries can shed a lustre quite different from that of a commander of a company of infantry. He resolved to study some profession. This last resolution was but little less courageous than the first. Reduced to a pension (_pension alimentaire_) of only 400 francs a year, he attempted to study medicine, and while waiting until he had the time to give to the necessary studies, he worked in the dreary office of a bank.  The meditations, the thoughts and aspirations of a contemplative nature like his, in his hours of work or leisure, in some degree consoled the budding philosopher during this period of uncongenial labor, and when he did have an opportunity of communicating his ideas to his friends, of discussing them, of defending them against objection, the hardships of his workaday life were for the time forgotten. In his ardor for science all the uncongenial experiences of his life as a bank clerk vanished. Like many another rising genius in art, literature, or science, his zeal for knowledge and investigation in those days of grinding poverty fed the fires of his genius, and this was the light which throughout his long poverty-stricken life shed a golden lustre on his toilsome existence. He did not then know that the great Linné, the father of the science he was to illuminate and so greatly to expand, also began life in extreme poverty, and eked out his scanty livelihood by mending over again for his own use the cast-off shoes of his fellow-students. (Cuvier.)  Bourguin[10] tells us that Lamarck's medical course lasted four years, and this period of severe study--for he must have made it such--evidently laid the best possible foundation that Paris could then afford for his after studies. He seems, however, to have wavered in his intentions of making medicine his life work, for he possessed a decided taste for music. His eldest brother, the Chevalier de Bazentin, strongly opposed, and induced him to abandon this project, though not without difficulty.  At about this time the two brothers lived in a quiet village[11] near Paris, and there for a year they studied together science and history. And now happened an event which proved to be the turning point, or rather gave a new and lasting impetus to Lamarck's career and decided his vocation in life. In one of their walks they met the philosopher and sentimentalist, Jean Jacques Rousseau. We know little about Lamarck's acquaintance with this genius, for all the details of his life, both in his early and later years, are pitifully scanty. Lamarck, however, had attended at the Jardin du Roi a botanical course, and now, having by good fortune met Rousseau, he probably improved the acquaintance, and, found by Rousseau to be a congenial spirit, he was soon invited to accompany him in his herborizations.  Still more recently Professor Giard[12] has unearthed from the works of Rousseau the following statement by him regarding species: \"Est-ce qu'à proprement parler il n'existerait point d'espèces dans la nature, mais seulement des individus?\"[13] In his _Discours sur l'Inégalité parmi les Hommes_ is the following passage, which shows, as Giard says, that Rousseau perfectly understood the influence of the _milieu_ and of wants on the organism; and this brilliant writer seems to have been the first to suggest natural selection, though only in the case of man, when he says that the weaker in Sparta were eliminated in order that the superior and stronger of the race might survive and be maintained.    \"Accustomed from infancy to the severity of the weather and the   rigors of the seasons, trained to undergo fatigue, and obliged to   defend naked"]]]
