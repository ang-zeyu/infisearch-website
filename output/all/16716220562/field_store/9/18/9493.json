Gentlemen, I couldn't help overhearing your conversation, and I agree most heartily with our red-haired friend. Consider the possibilities! Earth has cast us aside? Excellent! We are better off without her. We are all equal here, free men in a free society. No uniforms, no guards, no soldiers. Just repentant former criminals who want to live in peace.\"  \"What did they get you for?\" Barrent asked.  \"They said I was a credit thief,\" Joe said. \"I'm ashamed to admit that I can't remember what a credit thief is. But perhaps it'll come back to me.\"  \"Maybe the authorities have some sort of memory retraining system,\" Foeren said.  \"Authorities?\" Joe said indignantly. \"What do you mean, authorities? This is _our_ planet. We're all equal here. By definition, there can't be any authorities. No, friends, we left all that nonsense behind on Earth. Here we--\"  He stopped abruptly. The barracks' door had opened and a man walked in. He was evidently an older resident of Omega since he lacked the gray prison uniform. He was fat, and dressed in garish yellow and blue clothing. On a belt around his ample waist he carried a holstered pistol and a knife. He stood just inside the doorway, his hands on his hips, glaring at the new arrivals.  \"Well?\" he said. \"Don't you new men recognize a Quaestor? Stand up!\"  None of the men moved.  The Quaestor's face went scarlet. \"I guess I'll have to teach you a little respect.\"  Even before he had taken his weapon from its holster, the new arrivals had scrambled to their feet. The Quaestor looked at them with a faintly regretful air and pushed the weapon back in its holster.  \"The first thing you men better learn,\" the Quaestor said, \"is your status on Omega. Your status is _nowhere_. You're peons, and that means you're _nothing_.\"  He waited a moment and then said, \"Now pay attention, peons. You are about to be instructed in your duties.\"     Chapter Three   \"The first thing you new men should understand,\" the Quaestor said, \"is just exactly what you are. That's very important. And I'll tell you what you are. You're _peons_. You're the lowest of the low. You're _statusless_. There's nothing lower except mutants, and they aren't really human. Any questions?\"  The Quaestor waited. When there were no questions, he said, \"I've defined what _you_ are. From that, we'll proceed to a basic understanding of what everybody else on Omega is. First of all, _everybody_ is more important than you; but some are more important than others. Next above you in rank is the Resident, who hardly counts for more than any of you, and then there's the Free Citizen. He wears a gray finger ring of status, and his clothes are black. He isn't important either, but he's much more important than you. With luck, some of you may become Free Citizens.  \"Next are the Privileged Classes, all distinguished by various recognition symbols according to rank--such as the golden earrings, for example, of the Hadji class. Eventually you'll learn all the marks and prerogatives of the various ranks and degrees. I might also mention the priests. Even though they're not of Privileged rank, they're granted certain immunities and rights. Have I made myself clear?\"  Everyone in the barracks mumbled assent. The Quaestor continued, \"Now we come to the subject of deportment when meeting anyone of superior rank. As peons, you are obliged to greet a Free Citizen by his full title, in a respectful manner. With Privileged ranks such as Hadjis you speak only when spoken to, and then you stand with eyes downcast and hands clasped in front of you. You do not leave the presence of a Privileged Citizen until permission has been granted. You do not sit in his company under any circumstances. Understood? There is much more to be learned. My office of Quaestor, for example, comes under the classification of Free Citizen, but carries certain of the prerogatives of Privilege.\"  The Quaestor glared at the men to make sure they understood. \"This barracks is your temporary home. I have drawn up a chart to show which men sweep, which wash, and so forth. You may question me at anytime; but foolish or impertinent questions can be punished by mutilation or death. Just remember that you are the lowest of the low. If you bear that in mind, you might be able to stay alive.\"  The Quaestor stood in silence for a few moments. Then he said, \"Over the next few days, you'll all be given various assignments. Some of you will go to the germanium mines, some to the fishing fleet, some will be apprenticed to various trades. In the meantime, you're free to look around Tetrahyde.\"  When the men looked blank, the Quaestor explained, \"Tetrahyde is the name of the city you're in. It's the largest city on Omega.\" He thought for a moment. \"In fact, it's the only city on Omega.\"  \"What does the name Tetrahyde mean?\" Joe asked.  \"How should I know?\" the Quaestor said, scowling. \"I suppose it's one of those old Earth names the skrenners are always coming up with. Anyhow, just watch your step when you enter it.\"  \"Why?\" Barrent asked.  The Quaestor grinned. \"That, peon, is something you'll have to find out for yourself.\" He turned and strode from the barracks.  When he had gone, Barrent went to the window. From it he could see a deserted square and, beyond, the streets of Tetrahyde.  \"You thinking of going out there?\" Joe asked.  \"Certainly I am,\" Barrent said. \"Coming with me?\"  The little credit thief shook his head. \"I don't think it's safe.\"  \"Foeren, how about you?\"  \"I don't like it either,\" Foeren said. \"Might be better to stay around the barracks for a while.\"  \"That's ridiculous,\" Barrent said. \"It's _our_ city now. Isn't anyone coming with me?\"  Looking uncomfortable, Foeren hunched his big shoulders and shook his head. Joe shrugged and lay back on his cot. The rest of the new men didn't even look up.  \"Very well,\" Barrent said. \"I'll give you a full report later.\" He waited a moment longer in case someone changed his mind, then went out the door.         *       *       *       *       *  The city of Tetrahyde was a collection of buildings sprawled along a narrow peninsula which jutted into a sluggish gray sea. The peninsula's landward side was contained by a high stone wall, pierced with gates and guarded by sentries. Its largest building was the Arena, used once a year for the Games. Near the Arena was a small cluster of government buildings.  Barrent walked along the narrow streets, staring around him, trying to get some idea of what his new home was like. The winding, unpaved roads and dark, weatherbeaten houses stirred an elusive tag-end of memory in him. He had seen a place like this on Earth, but he couldn't remember anything about it. The recollection was as tantalizing as an itch; but he couldn't locate its source.  Past the Arena, he came into the main business district of Tetrahyde. Fascinated, he read the store signs: UNLICENSED DOCTOR--ABORTIONS PERFORMED WHILE-U-WAIT. Further on, DISBARRED LAWYER. POLITICAL PULL!  This seemed vaguely wrong to Barrent. He walked further, past stores advertising stolen goods, past a little shop that announced: MIND READING! FULL STAFF OF SKRENNING MUTANTS! YOUR PAST ON EARTH REVEALED!  Barrent was tempted to go in. But he remembered that he hadn't any money; and Omega seemed like the sort of place that put a high value on money.  He turned down a side street, walked by several restaurants, and came to a large building called THE POISON INSTITUTE (_Easy Terms. Up to 3 Years to Pay. Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back_). Next door to it was THE ASSASSIN'S GUILD, _Local 452_.  On the basis of the indoctrination talk on the prison ship, Barrent had expected Omega to be dedicated to the rehabilitation of criminals. To judge by the store signs, this simply wasn't so; or if it was, rehabilitation took some very strange forms. He walked on more slowly, deep in thought.  Then he noticed that people were moving out of his way. They glanced at him and ducked in doorways and stores. An elderly woman took one look at him and ran.  What was wrong? Could it be his prison uniform? No, the people of Omega had seen many of those. What was it, then?  The street was almost deserted. A shopkeeper near him was hurriedly swinging steel shutters over his display of fencing equipment.  \"What's the matter?\" Barrent asked him. \"What's going on?\"  \"Are you out of your head?\" the shopkeeper said. \"It's Landing Day!\"  \"I beg your pardon?\"  \"Landing Day!\" the shopkeeper said. \"The day the prison ship landed. Get back to your barracks, you idiot!\"  He slammed the last steel shutter into place and locked it. Barrent felt a sudden cold touch of fear. Something was very wrong. He had better get back in a hurry. It had been stupid of him not to find out more about Omegan customs before....  Three men were walking down the street toward him. They were well dressed, and each wore the small golden Hadji earring in his left ear. All three men carried sidearms.  Barrent started to walk away from them. One of the men shouted, \"Stop, peon!\"  Barrent saw that the man's hand was dangling near his gun. He stopped and said, \"What's the matter?\"  \"It's Landing Day,\" the man said. He looked at his friends. \"Well, who gets him first?\"  \"We'll choose.\"  \"Here's a coin.\"  \"No, a show of fingers.\"  \"Ready? One, two, three!\"  \"He's mine,\" said the Hadji on the left. His friends moved back as he drew his sidearm.  \"Wait!\" Barrent called out. \"What are you doing?\"  \"I'm going to shoot you,\" the man said.  \"But why?\"  The man smiled. \"Because it's a Hadji privilege. On every Landing Day, we have the right to shoot down any new peon who leaves his barracks area.\"  \"But I wasn't told!\"  \"Of course not,\" the man said. \"If you new men were told, none of you would leave your barracks on Landing Day. And that would spoil all the fun.\"  He took aim.  Barrent reacted instantaneously. He threw himself to the ground as the Hadji fired, heard a hiss,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20919"],["title","The Status Civilization (#3)"],["body"," saw a jagged heatburn score the brick building next to which he had been standing.  \"My turn now,\" one of the men said.  \"Sorry, old man, I believe it's mine.\"  \"Seniority, dear friend, has its privileges. Stand clear.\"  Before the next man could take aim, Barrent was on his feet and running. The sharply winding street protected him for the moment, but he could hear the sounds of his pursuers behind him. They were running at an easy stride, almost a fast walk, as if they were completely sure of their prey. Barrent put on a burst of speed, turned down a side street, and knew immediately he had made a mistake. He was facing a dead end. The Hadjis, moving at an easy pace, were coming up behind him.  Barrent looked wildly around. Store fronts here were all locked and shuttered. There was nowhere he could climb to, no place to hide.  And then he saw an open door halfway down the block in the direction of his pursuers. He had run right by it. A sign protruding from the building above the doorway said THE VICTIM'S PROTECTIVE SOCIETY. That's for me, Barrent thought.  He sprinted for it, running almost under the noses of the startled Hadjis. A single gun blast scorched the ground under his heels; then he had reached the doorway and flung himself inside.  He scrambled to his feet. His pursuers had not followed him; he could still hear their voices in the street, amiably arguing questions of precedence. Barrent realized he had entered some sort of sanctuary.  He was in a large, brightly lighted room. Several ragged men were sitting on a bench near the door, laughing at a private joke. A little further down, a dark-haired girl sat and watched Barrent with wide, unblinking green eyes. At the far end of the room was a desk with a man sitting behind it. The man beckoned to Barrent.  He walked up to the desk. The man behind it was short and bespectacled. He smiled encouragingly, waiting for Barrent to speak.  \"This is the Victim's Protective Society?\" Barrent asked.  \"Quite correct, sir,\" the man said. \"I am Rondolp Frendlyer, president of this nonprofit organization. Could I be of service?\"  \"You certainly could,\" Barrent said. \"I'm practically a victim.\"  \"I knew that just by looking at you,\" Frendlyer said, smiling warmly. \"You have a certain _victim_ look; a mixture of fear and uncertainty with just a suggestion of vulnerability thrown in. It's quite unmistakable.\"  \"That's very interesting,\" Barrent said, glancing toward the door and wondering how long his sanctuary would be respected. \"Mr. Frendlyer, I'm not a member of your organization--\"  \"That doesn't matter,\" Frendlyer said. \"Membership in our group is necessarily spontaneous. One joins when the occasion arises. Our intention is to protect the inalienable rights of all victims.\"  \"Yes, sir. Well, there are three men outside trying to kill me.\"  \"I see,\" Mr. Frendlyer said. He opened a drawer and took out a large book. He flipped through it quickly and found the reference he wanted. \"Tell me, did you ascertain the status of these men?\"  \"I believe they were Hadjis,\" Barrent said. \"Each of them had a little gold earring in his left ear.\"  \"Quite right,\" Mr. Frendlyer said. \"And today is Landing Day. You came off the ship that landed today, and have been classified a peon. Is that correct?\"  \"Yes, it is,\" Barrent said.  \"Then I'm happy to say that everything is in order. The Landing Day Hunt ends at sundown. You can leave here with knowledge that everything is correct and that your rights are in no way being violated.\"  \"Leave here? After sundown, you mean.\"  Mr. Frendlyer shook his head and smiled sadly. \"I'm afraid not. According to the law, you must leave here at once.\"  \"But they'll kill me!\"  \"That's very true,\" Frendlyer said. \"Unfortunately, it can't be helped. A victim, by definition, is one who is to be killed.\"  \"I thought this was a protective organization.\"  \"It is. But we protect _rights_, not victims. Your rights are not being violated. The Hadjis have the privilege of killing you on Landing Day, at any time before sundown, if you are not in your barracks area. You, I might add, have the right to kill anyone who tries to kill you.\"  \"I don't have a weapon,\" Barrent said.  \"Victims never do,\" Frendlyer said. \"It makes all the difference, doesn't it? But weapon or not, I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.\"  Barrent could still hear the Hadjis' lazy voices in the street. He asked, \"Have you a rear door?\"  \"Sorry.\"  \"Then I'll simply not leave.\"  Still smiling, Mr. Frendlyer opened a drawer and took out a gun. He pointed it at Barrent, and said, \"You really must leave. You can take your chances with the Hadjis, or you can die right here with no chance at all.\"  \"Lend me your gun,\" Barrent said.  \"It isn't allowed,\" Frendlyer told him. \"Can't have victims running around with weapons, you know. It would upset things.\" He clicked off the safety. \"Are you leaving?\"  Barrent calculated his chances of diving across the desk for the gun, and decided he would never make it. He turned and walked slowly to the door. The ragged men were still laughing together. The dark-haired girl had risen from the bench and was standing near the doorway. As he came close to her, Barrent noticed that she was very lovely. He wondered what crime had dictated her expulsion from Earth.  As he passed her, he felt something hard pressed into his ribs. He reached for it, and found he was holding a small, efficient-looking gun.  \"Luck,\" the girl said. \"I hope you know how to use it.\"  Barrent nodded his thanks. He wasn't sure he knew how; but he was going to find out.     Chapter Four   The street was deserted except for the three Hadjis, who stood about twenty yards away, conversing quietly. As Barrent came through the doorway, two of the men moved back; the third, his sidearm negligently lowered, stepped forward. When he saw that Barrent was armed he quickly brought his gun into firing position.  Barrent flung himself to the ground and pressed the trigger of his unfamiliar weapon. He felt it vibrate in his hand, and saw the Hadji's head and shoulders turn black and begin to crumble. Before he could take aim at the other men, Barrent's gun was wrenched violently from his hand. The Hadji's dying shot had creased the end of the muzzle.  Desperately Barrent dived for the gun, knowing he could never reach it in time. His skin pricked in expectation of the killing shot. He rolled to his gun, still miraculously alive, and took aim at the nearest Hadji.  Just in time, he checked himself from firing. The Hadjis had holstered their weapons. One of them was saying, \"Poor old Draken. He simply could not learn to take quick aim.\"  \"Lack of practice,\" the other man said. \"Draken never spent much time on the firing range.\"  \"Well, if you ask me, it's a very good object lesson. One mustn't get out of practice.\"  \"And,\" the other man said, \"one mustn't underestimate even a peon.\" He looked at Barrent. \"Nice shooting, fellow.\"  \"Yes, very nice indeed,\" the other man said. \"It's difficult to fire a handgun accurately while in motion.\"  Barrent got to his feet shakily, still holding the girl's weapon, prepared to fire at the first suspicious movement from the Hadjis. But they weren't moving suspiciously. They seemed to regard the entire incident as closed.  \"What happens now?\" Barrent asked.  \"Nothing,\" one of the Hadjis said. \"On Landing Day, one kill is all that any man or hunting party is allowed. After that, you're out of the hunt.\"  \"It's really a very unimportant holiday,\" the other man said. \"Not like the Games or the Lottery.\"  \"All that remains for you to do,\" the first man said, \"is to go to the Registration Office and collect your inheritance.\"  \"My _what_?\"  \"Your inheritance,\" the Hadji said patiently. \"You're entitled to the entire estate of your victim. In Draken's case, I'm sorry to say, it doesn't amount to very much.\"  \"He never was a good businessman,\" the other said sadly. \"Still, it'll give you a little something to start life with. And since you've made an authorized kill--even though a highly unusual one--you move upward in status. You become a Free Citizen.\"  People had come back into the streets, and shopkeepers were unlocking their steel shutters. A truck marked BODY DISPOSAL UNIT 5 drove up, and four uniformed men took away Draken's body. The normal life of Tetrahyde had begun again. This, more than any assurances from the Hadjis, told Barrent that the moment for murder was over. He put the girl's weapon in his pocket.  \"The Registration Office is over this way,\" one of the Hadjis told him. \"We'll act as your witnesses.\"  Barrent still had only a limited understanding of the situation. But since things were suddenly going his way, he decided to accept whatever happened without question. There would be plenty of time later to find out where he stood.  Accompanied by the Hadjis, he went to the Registration Office on Gunpoint Square. There a bored clerk heard the entire story, produced Draken's business papers, and pasted Barrent's name over Draken's. Barrent noticed that several other names had been pasted over. There seemed to be a fast turnover of businesses in Tetrahyde.  He found that he was now the owner of an antidote shop at 3 Blazer Boulevard.  The business papers also officially recognized Barrent's new rank as a Free Citizen. The clerk gave him a ring of status, made of gunmetal, and advised him to change into Citizen's clothing as soon as possible if he wished to avoid unpleasant incidents.  Outside, the Hadjis wished him luck. Barrent decided to see what his new business was like.         *       *       *       *       *  Blazer Boulevard was a short alley running between two streets. Near the middle of it was a store front with a sign which read: ANTIDOTE SHOP. Beneath that it read: _Specifics for every poison, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral.
