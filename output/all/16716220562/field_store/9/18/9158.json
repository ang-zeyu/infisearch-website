On the other hand, she was EETA which was bad, and had a master's in sociography from Adelaide, which was worse. \"When can I look for her?\"  \"Well, the governor general's going to screen me and find out when you'll have the shoonoon on hand.\"  Doesn't want to talk to me at all, Miles thought. Afraid he might say something and get quoted.  \"For your information, they'll be here inside an hour. They will have to eat, and they're all tired and sleepy. I should say 'bout oh-eight-hundred. Oh, and will you tell the governor general to tell Miss Shaw to bring an overnight kit with her. She's going to need it.\"   He was up at 0400, just a little after Beta-rise. He might be a civilian big-wheel in an Army psychological warfare project, but he still had four newscasts a day to produce. He spent a couple of hours checking the 0600 'cast and briefing Harry Walsh for the indeterminate period in which he would be acting chief editor and producer. At 0700, Foxx Travis put in an appearance. They went down to the fourth floor, to the little room they had fitted out as command-post, control room and office for Operation Shoonoo.  There was a rectangular black traveling-case, initialed E. S., beside the open office door. Travis nodded at it, and they grinned at one another; she'd come early, possibly hoping to catch them hiding something they didn't want her to see. Entering the office quietly, they found her seated facing the big viewscreen, smoking and watching a couple of enlisted men of the First Kwannon Native Infantry at work in another room where the pickup was. There were close to a dozen lipstick-tinted cigarette butts in the ashtray beside her. Her private face wasn't particularly happy. Maybe she was being earnest and concerned about the betterment of the underpriviledged, or the satanic maneuvers of the selfish planters.  Then she realized that somebody had entered; with a slight start, she turned, then rose. She was about the height of Foxx Travis, a few inches shorter than Miles, and slender. Light blond; green suit costume. She ditched her private face and got on her public one, a pleasant and deferential smile, with a trace of uncertainty behind it. Miles introduced Travis, and they sat down again facing the screen.  It gave a view, from one of the long sides and near the ceiling, of a big room. In the center, a number of seats--the drum-shaped cushions the natives had adopted in place of the seats carved from sections of tree trunk that they had been using when the Terrans had come to Kwannon--were arranged in a semicircle, one in the middle slightly in advance of the others. Facing them were three armchairs, a remote-control box beside one and another Kwann cushion behind and between the other two. There was a large globe of Kwannon, and on the wall behind the chairs an array of viewscreens.  \"There'll be an interpreter, a native Army sergeant, between you and Captain Travis,\" he said. \"I don't know how good you are with native languages, Miss Shaw; the captain is not very fluent.\"  \"Cushions for them, I see, and chairs for the lordly Terrans,\" she commented. \"Never miss a chance to rub our superiority in, do you?\"  \"I never deliberately force them to adopt our ways,\" he replied. \"Our chairs are as uncomfortable for them as their low seats are for us. Difference, you know, doesn't mean inferiority or superiority. It just means difference.\"  \"Well, what are you trying to do, here?\"  \"I'm trying to find out a little more about the psychology back of these frenzies and swarmings.\"  \"It hasn't occurred to you to look for them in the economic wrongs these people are suffering at the hands of the planters and traders, I suppose.\"  \"So they're committing suicide, and that's all you can call these swarmings, and the fire-frenzies in the south, from economic motives,\" Travis said. \"How does one better oneself economically by dying?\"  She ignored the question, which was easier than trying to answer it.   \"And why are you bothering to talk to these witch doctors? They aren't representative of the native people. They're a lot of cynical charlatans, with a vested interest in ignorance and superstition--\"  \"Miss Shaw, for the past eight centuries, earnest souls have been bewailing the fact that progress in the social sciences has always lagged behind progress in the physical sciences. I would suggest that the explanation might be in difference of approach. The physical scientist works _with_ physical forces, even when he is trying, as in the case of contragravity, to nullify them. The social scientist works _against_ social forces.\"  \"And the result's usually a miserable failure, even on the physical-accomplishment level,\" Foxx Travis added. \"This storm shelter project that was set up ten years ago and got nowhere, for instance. Ram√≥n Gonzales set up a shelter project of his own seventy-five hours ago, and he's half through with it now.\"  \"Yes, by forced labor!\"  \"Field surgery's brutal, too, especially when the anaesthetics run out. It's better than letting your wounded die, though.\"  \"Well, we were talking about these shoonoon. They are a force among the natives; that can't be denied. So, since we want to influence the natives, why not use them?\"  \"Mr. Gilbert, these shoonoon are blocking everything we are trying to do for the natives. If you use them for propaganda work in the villages, you will only increase their prestige and make it that much harder for us to better the natives' condition, both economically and culturally--\"  \"That's it, Miles,\" Travis said. \"She isn't interested in facts about specific humanoid people on Kwannon. She has a lot of high-order abstractions she got in a classroom at Adelaide on Terra.\"  \"No. Her idea of bettering the natives' condition is to rope in a lot of young Kwanns, put them in Government schools, overload them with information they aren't prepared to digest, teach them to despise their own people, and then send them out to the villages, where they behave with such insufferable arrogance that the wonder is that so few of them stop an arrow or a charge of buckshot, instead of so many. And when that happens, as it does occasionally, Welfare says they're murdered at the instigation of the shoonoon.\"  \"You know, Miss Shaw, this isn't just the roughneck's scorn for the egghead,\" Travis said. \"Miles went to school on Terra, and majored in extraterrestrial sociography, and got a master's, just like you did. At Montevideo,\" he added. \"And he spent two more years traveling on a Paula von Schlicten Fellowship.\"   Edith Shaw didn't say anything. She even tried desperately not to look impressed. It occurred to him that he'd never mentioned that fellowship to Travis. Army Intelligence must have a pretty good _dossier_ on him. Before anybody could say anything further, a Terran captain and a native sergeant of the First K.N.I. came in. In the screen, the four sepoys who had been fussing around straightening things picked up auto-carbines and posted themselves two on either side of a door across from the pickup, taking positions that would permit them to fire into whatever came through without hitting each other.  What came through was one hundred and eighty-four shoonoon. Some wore robes of loose gauze strips, and some wore fire-dance cloaks of red and yellow and orange ribbons. Many were almost completely naked, but they were all amulet-ed to the teeth. There must have been a couple of miles of brass and bright-alloy wire among them, and half a ton of bright scrap-metal, and the skulls, bones, claws, teeth, tails and other components of most of the native fauna. They debouched into the big room, stopped, and stood looking around them. A native sergeant and a couple more sepoys followed. They got the shoonoon over to the semicircle of cushions, having to chase a couple of them away from the single seat at front and center, and induced them to sit down.  The native sergeant in the little room said something under his breath; the captain laughed. Edith Shaw gaped for an instant and said, \"_Muggawsh_!\" Travis simply remarked that he'd be damned.  \"They do look kind of unusual, don't they?\" Miles said. \"I wouldn't doubt that this is the biggest assemblage of shoonoon in history. They aren't exactly a gregarious lot.\"  \"Maybe this is the beginning of a new era. First meeting of the Kwannon Thaumaturgical Society.\"  A couple more K.N.I. privates came in with serving-tables on contragravity floats and began passing bowls of a frozen native-food delicacy of which all Kwanns had become passionately fond since its introduction by the Terrans. He let them finish, and then, after they had been relieved of the empty bowls, he nodded to the K.N.I. sergeant, who opened a door on the left. They all went through into the room they had been seeing in the screen. There was a stir when the shoonoon saw him, and he heard his name, in its usual native mispronunciation, repeated back and forth.  \"You all know me,\" he said, after they were seated. \"Have I ever been an enemy to you or to the People?\"  \"No,\" one of them said. \"He speaks for us to the other Terrans. When we are wronged, he tries to get the wrongs righted. In times of famine he has spoken of our troubles, and gifts of food have come while the Government argued about what to do.\"  [Illustration]  He wished he could see Edith Shaw's face.  \"There was a sickness in our village, and my magic could not cure it,\" another said. \"Mailsh Heelbare gave me oomphel to cure it, and told me how to use it. He did this privately, so that I would not be made to look small to the people of the village.\"  And that had infuriated EETA; it was a question whether unofficial help to the natives or support of the prestige of a shoonoo had angered them more.  \"His father was a trader; he gave good oomphel, and did not cheat. Mailsh Heelbare grew up among us; he took the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20649"],["title","Oomphel in the Sky (#5)"],["body","Test with the boys of the village,\" another oldster said. \"He listened with respect to the grandfather-stories. No, Mailsh Heelbare is not our enemy. He is our friend.\"  \"And so I will prove myself now,\" he told them. \"The Government is angry with the People, but I will try to take their anger away, and in the meantime I am permitted to come here and talk with you. Here is a chief of soldiers, and one of the Government people, and your words will be heard by the oomphel machine that remembers and repeats, for the Governor and the Great Soldier Chief.\"  They all brightened. To make a voice recording was a wonderful honor. Then one of them said:  \"But what good will that do now? The Last Hot Time is here. Let us be permitted to return to our villages, where our people need us.\"  \"It is of that that I wish to speak. But first of all, I must hear your words, and know what is in your minds. Who is the eldest among you? Let him come forth and sit in the front, where I may speak with him.\"   Then he relaxed while they argued in respectfully subdued voices. Finally one decrepit oldster, wearing a cloak of yellow ribbons and carrying a highly obscene and ineffably sacred wooden image, was brought forward and installed on the front-and-center cushion. He'd come from some village to the west that hadn't gotten the word of the swarming; Gonzales' men had snagged him while he was making crop-fertility magic.  Miles showed him the respect due his advanced age and obviously great magical powers, displaying, as he did, an understanding of the regalia.  \"I have indeed lived long,\" the old shoonoo replied. \"I saw the Hot Time before; I was a child of so high.\" He measured about two and a half feet off the floor; that would make him ninety-five or thereabouts. \"I remember it.\"  \"Speak to us, then. Tell us of the Gone Ones, and of the Sky Fire, and of the Last Hot Time. Speak as though you alone knew these things, and as though you were teaching me.\"  Delighted, the oldster whooshed a couple of times to clear his outlets and began:  \"In the long-ago time, there was only the Great Spirit. The Great Spirit made the World, and he made the People. In that time, there were no more People in the World than would be in one village, now. The Gone Ones dwelt among them, and spoke to them as I speak to you. Then, as more People were born, and died and went to join the Gone Ones, the Gone Ones became many, and they went away and build a place for themselves, and built the Sky Fire around it, and in the Place of the Gone Ones, at the middle of the Sky Fire, it is cool. From their place in the Sky Fire, the Gone Ones send wisdom to the people in dreams.  \"The Sky Fire passes across the sky, from east to west, as the Always-Same does, but it is farther away than the Always-Same, because sometimes the Always Same passes in front of it, but the Sky Fire never passes in front of the Always-Same. None of the grandfather-stories, not even the oldest, tell of a time when this happened.  \"Sometimes the Sky Fire is big and bright; that is when the Gone Ones feast and dance. Sometimes it is smaller and dimmer; then the Gone Ones rest and sleep. Sometimes it is close, and there is a Hot Time; sometimes it goes far away, and then there is a Cool Time.  \"Now, the Last Hot Time has come. The Sky Fire will come closer and closer, and it will pass the Always-Same, and then it will burn up the World. Then will be a new World, and the Gone Ones will return, and the People will be given new bodies. When this happens, the Sky Fire will go out, and the Gone Ones will live in the World again with the People; the Gone Ones will make great magic and teach wisdom as I teach to you, and will no longer have to send dreams. In that time the crops will grow without planting or tending or the work of women; in that time, the game will come into the villages to be killed in the gathering-places. There will be no more hunger and no more hard work, and no more of the People will die or be slain. And that time is now here,\" he finished. \"All the People know this.\"  \"Tell me, Grandfather; how is this known? There have been many Hot Times before. Why should this one be the Last Hot Time?\"  \"The Terrans have come, and brought oomphel into the World,\" the old shoonoo said. \"It is a sign.\"  \"It was not prophesied beforetime. None of the People had prophesies of the coming of the Terrans. I ask you, who were the father of children and the grandfather of children's children when the Terrans came; was there any such prophesy?\"   The old shoonoo was silent, turning his pornographic ikon in his hands and looked at it.  \"No,\" he admitted, at length. \"Before the Terrans came, there were no prophesies among the People of their coming. Afterward, of course, there were many such prophesies, but there were none before.\"  \"That is strange. When a happening is a sign of something to come, it is prophesied beforetime.\" He left that seed of doubt alone to grow, and continued: \"Now, Grandfather, speak to us about what the People believe concerning the Terrans.\"  \"The Terrans came to the World when my eldest daughter bore her first child,\" the old shoonoo said. \"They came in great round ships, such as come often now, but which had never before been seen. They said that they came from another world like the World of People, but so far away that even the Sky Fire could not be seen from it. They still say this, and many of the People believe it, but it is not real.  \"At first, it was thought that the Terrans were great shoonoon who made powerful magic, but this is not real either. The Terrans have no magic and no wisdom of their own. All they have is the oomphel, and the oomphel works magic for them and teaches them their wisdom. Even in the schools which the Terrans have made for the People, it is the oomphel which teaches.\" He went on to describe, not too incorrectly, the reading-screens and viewscreens and audio-visual equipment. \"Nor do the Terrans make the oomphel, as they say. The oomphel makes more oomphel for them.\"  \"Then where did the Terrans get the first oomphel?\"  \"They stole it from the Gone Ones,\" the old shoonoo replied. \"The Gone Ones make it in their place in the middle of the Sky Fire, for themselves and to give to the People when they return. The Terrans stole it from them. For this reason, there is much hatred of the Terrans among the People. The Terrans live in the Dark Place, under the World, where the Sky Fire and the Always-Same go when they are not in the sky. It is there that the Terrans get the oomphel from the Gone Ones, and now they have come to the World, and they are using oomphel to hold back the Sky-Fire and keep it beyond the Always-Same so that the Last Hot Time will not come and the Gone Ones will not return. For this reason, too, there is much hatred of the Terrans among the People.\"  \"Grandfather, if this were real there would be good reason for such hatred, and I would be ashamed for what my people had done and were doing. But it is not real.\" He had to rise and hold up his hands to quell the indignant outcry \"Have any of you known me to tell not-real things and try to make the People act as though they were real? Then trust me in this. I will show you real things, which you will all see, and I will give you great secrets, which it is now time for you to have and use for the good of the People. Even the greatest secret,\" he added.  There was a pause of a few seconds. Then they burst out, in a hundred and eighty-four--no, three hundred and sixty eight--voices:  _\"The Oomphel Secret, Mailsh Heelbare?\"_  He nodded slowly. \"Yes. The Oomphel Secret will be given.\"  He leaned back and relaxed again while they were getting over the excitement. Foxx Travis looked at him apprehensively.  \"Rushing things, aren't you? What are you going to tell them?\"  \"Oh, a big pack of lies, I suppose,\" Edith Shaw said scornfully.  Behind her and Travis, the native noncom interpreter was muttering something in his own language that translated roughly as: \"This better be good!\"  The shoonoon had quieted, now, and were waiting breathlessly.  \"But if the Oomphel Secret is given, what will become of the shoonoon?\" he asked. \"You, yourselves, say that we Terrans have no need for magic, because the oomphel works magic for us. This is real. If the People get the Oomphel Secret, how much need will they have for you shoonoon?\"  Evidently that hadn't occurred to them before. There was a brief flurry of whispered--whooshed, rather--conversation, and then they were silent again. The eldest shoonoo said:  \"We trust you, Mailsh Heelbare. You will do what is best for the People, and you will not let us be thrown out like broken pots, either.\"  \"No, I will not,\" he promised. \"The Oomphel Secret will be given to you shoonoon.\" He thought for a moment of Foxx Travis' joking remark about the Kwannon Thaumaturgical Society. \"You have been jealous of one another, each keeping his own secrets,\" he said. \"This must be put away. You will all receive the Oomphel Secret equally, for the good of all the People. You must all swear brotherhood, one with another, and later if any other shoonoo comes to you for the secret, you must swear brotherhood with him and teach it to him. Do you agree to this?\"   The eldest shoonoo rose to his feet, begged leave, and then led the others to the rear of the room, where they went into a huddle. They didn't stay huddled long; inside of ten minutes they came back and took their seats.  \"We are agreed, Mailsh Heelbare,\" the spokesman said.  Edith Shaw was impressed, more than by anything else she had seen. \"Well, that was a quick decision!\" she whispered.  \"You have done well, Grandfathers. You will not be thrown out by the People like broken pots; you will be greater among them than ever. I will show you how this will be.  \"But first, I must speak around the Oomphel Secret.\" He groped briefly for a comprehensible analogy, and thought of a native vegetable, layered like an"]]]
