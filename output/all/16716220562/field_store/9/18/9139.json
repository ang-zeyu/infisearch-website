Tell them\"--she hesitated--\"tell them I will be down immediately. Let them not come up. Keep them below on any pretext. Show them an album. Let them look at the goldfish. Anything, but not here! I shall be ready in a moment.\"  Feverishly she made herself ready. As hastily as possible she removed all traces of tears from her face. She threw about her shoulders an opera cloak, and with a light Venetian scarf half concealed the beauty of her hair and features. \"Abducted!\" she murmured, \"and by six of them! I think she said six. Oh, the horror of it!\" A touch of powder to her cheeks and a slight blackening of her eyebrows, and the courageous girl was ready.  Lord Wynchgate and his companions--for they it was, that is to say, they were it--sat below in the sitting-room looking at the albums. \"Woman,\" said Lord Wynchgate to the Landlady, with an oath, \"let her hurry up. We have seen enough of these. We can wait no longer.\"  \"I am here,\" cried a clear voice upon the threshold, and Winnifred stood before them. \"My lords, for I divine who you are and wherefore you have come, take me, do your worst with me, but spare, oh, spare this humble companion of my sorrow.\"  \"Right-oh!\" said Lord Dogwood, with a brutal laugh.  \"Enough,\" exclaimed Wynchgate, and seizing Winnifred by the waist, he dragged her forth out of the house and out upon the street.  But something in the brutal violence of his behaviour seemed to kindle for the moment a spark of manly feeling, if such there were, in the breasts of his companions.  \"Wynchgate,\" cried young Lord Dogwood, \"my mind misgives me. I doubt if this is a gentlemanly thing to do. I'll have no further hand in it.\"  A chorus of approval from his companions endorsed his utterance. For a moment they hesitated.  \"Nay,\" cried Winnifred, turning to confront the masked faces that stood about her, \"go forward with your fell design. I am here. I am helpless. Let no prayers stay your hand. Go to it.\"  \"Have done with this!\" cried Wynchgate, with a brutal oath. \"Shove her in the coach.\"  But at the very moment the sound of hurrying footsteps was heard, and a clear, ringing, manly, well-toned, vibrating voice cried, \"Hold! Stop! Desist! Have a care, titled villain, or I will strike you to the earth.\"  A tall aristocratic form bounded out of the darkness.  \"Gentlemen,\" cried Wynchgate, releasing his hold upon the frightened girl, \"we are betrayed. Save yourselves. To the coach.\"  In another instant the six noblemen had leaped into the coach and disappeared down the street.  Winnifred, still half inanimate with fright, turned to her rescuer, and saw before her the form and lineaments of the Unknown Stranger, who had thus twice stood between her and disaster. Half fainting, she fell swooning into his arms.  \"Dear lady,\" he exclaimed, \"rouse yourself. You are safe. Let me restore you to your home!\"  \"That voice!\" cried Winnifred, resuming consciousness. \"It is my benefactor.\"  She would have swooned again, but the Unknown lifted her bodily up the steps of her home and leant her against the door.  \"Farewell,\" he said, in a voice resonant with gloom.  \"Oh, sir!\" cried the unhappy girl, \"let one who owes so much to one who has saved her in her hour of need at least know his name.\"  But the stranger, with a mournful gesture of farewell, had disappeared as rapidly as he had come.  But, as to why he had disappeared, we must ask our reader's patience for another chapter.     CHAPTER VI  THE UNKNOWN   The scene is now shifted, sideways and forwards, so as to put it at Muddlenut Chase, and to make it a fortnight later than the events related in the last chapter.  Winnifred is now at the Chase as the guest of the Marquis and Marchioness. There her bruised soul finds peace.  The Chase itself was one of those typical country homes which are, or were till yesterday, the glory of England. The approach to the Chase lay through twenty miles of glorious forest, filled with fallow deer and wild bulls. The house itself, dating from the time of the Plantagenets, was surrounded by a moat covered with broad lilies and floating green scum. Magnificent peacocks sunned themselves on the terraces, while from the surrounding shrubberies there rose the soft murmur of doves, pigeons, bats, owls and partridges.  Here sat Winnifred Clair day after day upon the terrace recovering her strength, under the tender solicitude of the Marchioness.  Each day the girl urged upon her noble hostess the necessity of her departure. \"Nay,\" said the Marchioness, with gentle insistence, \"stay where you are. Your soul is bruised. You must rest.\"  \"Alas,\" cried Winnifred, \"who am I that I should rest? Alone, despised, buffeted by fate, what right have I to your kindness?\"  \"Miss Clair,\" replied the noble lady, \"wait till you are stronger. There is something that I wish to say to you.\"  Then at last, one morning when Winnifred's temperature had fallen to ninety-eight point three, the Marchioness spoke.  \"Miss Clair,\" she said, in a voice which throbbed with emotion, \"Winnifred, if I may so call you, Lord Muddlenut and I have formed a plan for your future. It is our dearest wish that you should marry our son.\"  \"Alas,\" cried Winnifred, while tears rose in her eyes, \"it cannot be!\"  \"Say not so,\" cried the Marchioness. \"Our son, Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, is young, handsome, all that a girl could desire. After months of wandering he returns to us this morning. It is our dearest wish to see him married and established. We offer you his hand.\"  \"Indeed,\" replied Winnifred, while her tears fell even more freely, \"I seem to requite but ill the kindness that you show. Alas, my heart is no longer in my keeping.\"  \"Where is it?\" cried the Marchioness.  \"It is another's. One whose very name I do not know holds it in his keeping.\"  But at this moment a blithe, gladsome step was heard upon the flagstones of the terrace. A manly, ringing voice, which sent a thrill to Winnifred's heart, cried \"Mother!\" and in another instant Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, for he it was, had folded the Marchioness to his heart.  Winnifred rose, her heart beating wildly. One glance was enough. The newcomer, Lord Mordaunt, was none other than the Unknown, the Unaccountable, to whose protection she had twice owed her life.  With a wild cry Winnifred Clair leaped across the flagstones of the terrace and fled into the park.     CHAPTER VII  THE PROPOSAL   They stood beneath the great trees of the ancestral park, into which Lord Mordaunt had followed Winnifred at a single bound. All about them was the radiance of early June.  Lord Mordaunt knelt on one knee on the greensward, and with a touch in which respect and reverence were mingled with the deepest and manliest emotion, he took between his finger and thumb the tip of the girl's gloved hand.  \"Miss Clair,\" he uttered, in a voice suffused with the deepest yearning, yet vibrating with the most profound respect, \"Miss Clair--Winnifred--hear me, I implore!\"  \"Alas,\" cried Winnifred, struggling in vain to disengage the tip of her glove from the impetuous clasp of the young nobleman, \"alas, whither can I fly? I do not know my way through the wood, and there are bulls in all directions. I am not used to them! Lord Mordaunt, I implore you, let the tears of one but little skilled in the art of dissimulation----\"  \"Nay, Winnifred,\" said the Young Earl, \"fly not. Hear me out!\"  \"Let me fly,\" begged the unhappy girl.  \"You must not fly,\" pleaded Mordaunt. \"Let me first, here upon bended knee, convey to you the expression of a devotion, a love, as ardent and as deep as ever burned in a human heart. Winnifred, be my bride!\"  \"Oh, sir,\" sobbed Winnifred, \"if the knowledge of a gratitude, a thankfulness from one whose heart will ever treasure as its proudest memory the recollection of one who did for one all that one could have wanted done for one--if this be some poor guerdon, let it suffice. But, alas, my birth, the dark secret of my birth forbids----\"  \"Nay,\" cried Mordaunt, leaping now to his feet, \"your birth is all right. I have looked into it myself. It is as good--or nearly as good--as my own. Till I knew this, my lips were sealed by duty. While I supposed that you had a lower birth and I an upper, I was bound to silence. But come with me to the house. There is one arrived with me who will explain all.\"  Hand in hand the lovers, for such they now were, returned to the Chase. There in the great hall the Marquis and the Marchioness were standing ready to greet them.  \"My child!\" exclaimed the noble lady, as she folded Winnifred to her heart. Then she turned to her son. \"Let her know all!\" she cried.  Lord Mordaunt stepped across the room to a curtain. He drew it aside, and there stepped forth Mr. Bonehead, the old lawyer who had cast Winnifred upon the world.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the Lawyer, advancing and taking the girl's hand for a moment in a kindly clasp, \"the time has come for me to explain all. You are not, you never were, the penniless girl that you suppose. Under the terms of your father's will, I was called upon to act a part and to throw you upon the world. It was my client's wish, and I followed it. I told you, quite truthfully, that I had put part of your money into options in an oil-well. Miss Clair, that well is now producing a million gallons of gasolene a month!'  \"A million gallons!\" cried Winnifred. \"I can never use it.\"  \"Wait till you own a motor-car, Miss Winnifred,\" said the Lawyer.  \"Then I am rich!\" exclaimed the bewildered girl.  \"Rich beyond your dreams,\" answered the Lawyer. \"Miss Clair, you own in your own right about half of the State of Texas--I think it is in Texas, at any rate either Texas or Rhode Island, or one of those big states in America. More than this, I have invested your property since your father's death so wisely that even after paying the income tax and the property tax, the inheritance tax, the dog tax and the tax on amusements, you will still have one half of one per cent to spend.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20633"],["title","Winsome Winnie and other New Nonsense Novels (#3)"],["body"," clasped her hands.  \"I knew it all the time,\" said Lord Mordaunt, drawing the girl to his embrace, \"I found it out through this good man.\"  \"We knew it too,\" said the Marchioness. \"Can you forgive us, darling, our little plot for your welfare? Had we not done this Mordaunt might have had to follow you over to America and chase you all around Newport and Narragansett at a fearful expense.\"  \"How can I thank you enough?\" cried Winnifred. Then she added eagerly, \"And my birth, my descent?\"  \"It is all right,\" interjected the Old Lawyer. \"It is A 1. Your father, who died before you were born, quite a little time before, belonged to the very highest peerage of Wales. You are descended directly from Claer-ap-Claer, who murdered Owen Glendower. Your mother we are still tracing up. But we have already connected her with Floyd-ap-Floyd, who murdered Prince Llewellyn.\"  \"Oh, sir,\" cried the grateful girl. \"I only hope I may prove worthy of them!\"  \"One thing more,\" said Lord Mordaunt, and stepping over to another curtain he drew it aside and there emerged Lord Wynchgate.  He stood before Winnifred, a manly contrition struggling upon features which, but for the evil courses of he who wore them, might have been almost presentable.  \"Miss Clair,\" he said, \"I ask your pardon. I tried to carry you off. I never will again. But before we part let me say that my acquaintance with you has made me a better man, broader, bigger and, I hope, deeper.\"  With a profound bow, Lord Wynchgate took his leave.     CHAPTER VIII  WEDDED AT LAST   Lord Mordaunt and his bride were married forthwith in the parish church of Muddlenut Chase. With Winnifred's money they have drained the moat, rebuilt the Chase, and chased the bulls out of the park. They have six children, so far, and are respected, honoured and revered in the countryside far and wide, over a radius of twenty miles in circumference.     II  JOHN AND I  OR, HOW I NEARLY LOST MY HUSBAND  (_Narrated after the approved fashion of the best Heart and Home Magazines_)     _II.--John and I; or, How I Nearly Lost My Husband._   It was after we had been married about two years that I began to feel that I needed more air. Every time I looked at John across the breakfast-table, I felt as if I must have more air, more space.  I seemed to feel as if I had no room to expand. I had begun to ask myself whether I had been wise in marrying John, whether John was really sufficient for my development. I felt cramped and shut in. In spite of myself the question would arise in my mind whether John really understood my nature. He had a way of reading the newspaper, propped up against the sugar-bowl, at breakfast, that somehow made me feel as if things had gone all wrong. It was bitter to realize that the time had come when John could prefer the newspaper to his wife's society.  But perhaps I had better go back and tell the whole miserable story from the beginning.  I shall never forget--I suppose no woman ever does--the evening when John first spoke out his love for me. I had felt for some time past that it was there. Again and again, he seemed about to speak. But somehow his words seemed to fail him. Twice I took him into the very heart of the little wood beside Mother's house, but it was only a small wood, and somehow he slipped out on the other side. \"Oh, John,\" I had said, \"how lonely and still it seems in the wood with no one here but ourselves! Do you think,\" I said, \"that the birds have souls?\" \"I don't know,\" John answered, \"let's get out of this.\" I was sure that his emotion was too strong for him. \"I never feel a bit lonesome where you are, John,\" I said, as we made our way among the underbrush. \"I think we can get out down that little gully,\" he answered. Then one evening in June after tea I led John down a path beside the house to a little corner behind the garden where there was a stone wall on one side and a high fence right in front of us, and thorn bushes on the other side. There was a little bench in the angle of the wall and the fence, and we sat down on it.  \"Minnie,\" John said, \"there's something I meant to say----\"  \"Oh, John,\" I cried, and I flung my arms round his neck. It all came with such a flood of surprise.  \"All I meant, Minn----\" John went on, but I checked him.  \"Oh, don't, John, don't say anything more,\" I said. \"It's just too perfect.\" Then I rose and seized him by the wrist. \"Come,\" I said, \"come to Mother,\" and I rushed him along the path.  As soon as Mother saw us come in hand in hand in this way, she guessed everything. She threw both her arms round John's neck and fairly pinned him against the wall. John tried to speak, but Mother wouldn't let him. \"I saw it all along, John,\" she said. \"Don't speak. Don't say a word. I guessed your love for Minn from the very start. I don't know what I shall do without her, John, but she's yours now; take her.\" Then Mother began to cry and I couldn't help crying too. \"Take him to Father,\" Mother said, and we each took one of John's wrists and took him to Father on the back verandah. As soon as John saw Father he tried to speak again--\"I think I ought to say,\" he began, but Mother stopped him. \"Father,\" she said, \"he wants to take our little girl away. He loves her very dearly, Alfred,\" she said, \"and I think it our duty to let her go, no matter how hard it is, and oh, please Heaven, Alfred, he'll treat her well and not misuse her, or beat her,\" and she began to sob again.  Father got up and took John by the hand and shook it warmly.  \"Take her, boy,\" he said. \"She's all yours now, take her.\"  So John and I were engaged, and in due time our wedding day came and we were married. I remember that for days and days before the wedding day John seemed very nervous and depressed; I think he was worrying, poor boy, as to whether he could really make me happy and whether he could fill my life as it should be filled. But I told him that he was not to worry, because I _meant_ to be happy, and was determined just to make the best of everything.  Father stayed with John a good deal before the wedding day, and on the wedding morning he went and fetched him to the church in a closed carriage and had him there all ready when we came. It was a beautiful day in September, and the church looked just lovely. I had a beautiful gown of white organdie with _tulle_ at the throat, and I carried a great bunch of white roses, and Father led John up the aisle after me.  I remember that Mother cried a good deal at the wedding, and told John that he had stolen her darling and that he must never misuse me or beat me. And I remember that the clergyman spoke very severely to John, and told him he hoped he realized the responsibility he was taking and that it was his duty to make me happy. A lot of our old friends were there, and they all spoke quite sharply to John, and all the women kissed me and said they hoped I would never regret what I had done, and I just kept up my spirits by sheer determination, and told them that I had made up my mind to be happy and that I was going to be so.  So presently it was all over and we were driven to the station and got the afternoon train for New York, and when we sat down in the compartment among all our bandboxes and flowers, John said, \"Well, thank God, that's over.\" And I said, \"Oh, John, an oath! on our wedding day, an oath!\" John said, \"I'm sorry, Minn, I didn't mean----\" but I said, \"Don't, John, don't make it worse. Swear at me if you must, but don't make it harder to bear.\"         *       *       *       *       *  We spent our honeymoon in New York. At first I had thought of going somewhere to the great lonely woods, where I could have walked under the great trees and felt the silence of nature, and where John should have been my Viking and captured me with his spear, and where I should be his and his alone and no other man should share me; and John had said all right. Or else I had planned to go away somewhere to the seashore, where I could have watched the great waves dashing themselves against the rocks. I had told John that he should be my cave man, and should seize me in his arms and carry me whither he would. I felt somehow that for my development I wanted to get as close to nature as ever I could--that my mind seemed to be reaching out for a great emptiness. But I looked over all the hotel and steamship folders I could find and it seemed impossible to get good accommodation, so we came to New York. I had a great deal of shopping to do for our new house, so I could not be much with John, but I felt it was not right to neglect him, so I drove him somewhere in a taxi each morning and called for him again in the evening. One day I took him to the Metropolitan Museum, and another day I left him at the Zoo, and another day at the aquarium. John seemed very happy and quiet among the fishes.  So presently we came back home, and I spent many busy days in fixing and arranging our new house. I had the drawing-room done in blue, and the dining-room all in dark panelled wood, and a boudoir upstairs done in pink and white enamel to match my bedroom and dressing-room. There was a very nice little room in the basement next to the coal cellar that I turned into a \"den\" for John, so that when he wanted to smoke he could go down there and do it. John seemed to appreciate his den at once, and often would stay down there so long that I had to call to him to come up.  When I look back on those days they seem very bright and happy. But it was not very long before a change came. I began to realize that John was neglecting me. I noticed it at first in small things. I don't know just how long it was after our marriage that John began to read the newspaper at breakfast. At first he would only pick it up and read it in little bits, and only on the front page. I tried not to be hurt at it, and would go on talking just as brightly as I could, without seeming to notice anything. But presently he went on to reading the inside part of the"]]]
