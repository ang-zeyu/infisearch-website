So hush-hush, in fact, was this mission that when Brent Taber arrived at his office that morning and found Senator Crane pacing his reception-room carpet, his heavy eyebrows gathered and he began mentally checking his \"tight ship\" for a leak.  Senator Crane was the exact opposite of Brent, in that he looked to be exactly what he was; a figure rigidly type-cast to the role of a blustering, tactless servant of the people. Which, in Crane's case, meant that he was a servant of Crane's career and any faction of his supporters that could further it. Still, the Senator could not be called dishonest. He was merely a flexible rationalizer. He sincerely believed that what was good for Crane was good for the \"folks back home.\"  And just now, he felt that a knowledge of what the hell was going on in Brent Taber's orbit was probably not good for anybody and had better be aired.  As Brent entered, Crane came right to the point. \"Goddamn it, Taber, just what in blazes is going on around here?\"  Brent's thick lips hardly moved, a characteristic that Crane found infuriating because that was the way shady characters talked into Senatorial investigation microphones and it looked pretty bad. But Brent's words came quite clear: \"Routine business, Senator--an honest effort to get a day's work done.\"  \"You mean to tell me the meeting that's been set up here is routine?\"  Brent shrugged. \"Meetings are meetings, Senator.\"  Crane ticked it off on his fat fingers. \"Pender of the Army, Bright of the Navy, Jones of the Air Force, Hagen of the FBI, Wilson from Treasury--they all trooped through here into your private conference room.\" He pointed pompously at his own chest. \"But Crane of the Senate--\"  \"You forgot Birch of the State Department,\" Brent cut in. \"Or hasn't he arrived yet?\"  \"--Crane of the Senate is barred! Now just what in the hell--?\"  There are times for tact and times for bluntness, and this was a time, Brent decided, for the latter. \"What goes on here, Senator,\" he said, \"is none of your business. Otherwise, you would have been invited.\"  Crane's face darkened and Brent thought pleasantly of a brain hemorrhage blowing the top of his fat head off. But this was too much to hope for.  \"Brent,\" Crane exploded, \"I'll get you! So help me, I'll get you! Just who the hell do you think you are--demeaning the dignity of the United States Senate? Just who are you to say what the people should or should not know?\"  \"Decisions of that nature are made upstairs, Senator. I don't presume to possess the judgment needed in such matters.\"  \"You're an arrogant bureaucrat! Your kind comes and goes because when you get too goddamned arrogant the people rise up in their wrath and knock you off.\"  Marcia Holly, Brent's secretary, was studiously transcribing some notes and Brent turned his scowl on her because, damn it, she was laughing like hell at the whole thing. And, by God, a secretary didn't have the right to laugh at a United States Senator, even with her eyes, no matter how much a congenital idiot he was.  \"I'm sorry, Senator,\" Brent said. \"If you have a complaint, please take it up with my superiors. Just now I--\"  \"Your superiors? And who the devil are they? Who can find them? Where do they have offices? Go around trying to find your superiors and nobody ever heard of you.\"  Brent half smiled as he felt a sneaking admiration for Crane. The son-of-a-bitch had a disarming quality of honesty. If he planned to knife you, he drove straight in, the knife held high.  \"One of the disadvantages of being a negative personality, Senator,\" Brent murmured.  \"Sure! You're about as negative as a charging grizzly,\" Crane snorted and headed for the door as though his air had been cut off.  After his bulk had vanished into the corridor, Brent turned a scowl on Marcia Holly. \"And what are you snickering about.\"  She raised large blue, innocent eyes. \"Me? I? Oh, golly. I just found a cute little Freudian slip in these notes and--\"  \"Shut up. Are they all here?\"  \"Birch of the State Department sent regrets. A duty call on the Tasmanian Embassy or something.\"  \"Okay--and next week he'll be screaming to high heaven about being left out.\"  Marcia's laughing eyes agreed. \"Ain't it the truth?\" she marveled.  Brent strode past her and expertly mussed her sleek hairdo in a quick gesture. As he entered his private conference room, he turned and grinned at her silent fury.  Inside, they were all waiting for him, seated around a teakwood table. The wall-to-wall carpeting was wine-red. The chairs were deep and upholstered. And the men who sat in them were distinguished only by their surroundings and their uniforms. Their metal and their worth were hidden inside.  Brent moved to the end of the table and scanned them moodily. \"Okay, gentlemen. I'll talk. Then if you have any questions--shoot them.\" He took a deep breath and began:  \"We are faced with a situation that must be kept top secret for two reasons: First, it may be the first move in an attempt to subjugate or destroy our planet; two, it is so utterly ridiculous on its face that a public announcement would be greeted by hoots of laughter from pole to pole.\" Brent's ugly scowl deepened at what he seemed to feel was an injustice. \"Even the Eskimos would get a yack out of it.\"  The group waited, withholding judgment, evidently waiting to see whether or not it was a laughing matter. They were conceding nothing. Brent studied them for a moment and then went on.  \"Last week, in Denver, early in the morning,\" he said, \"a man was found dead on a residential-section street. There was no apparent cause of death. A routine autopsy revealed some peculiar things about the man's insides. For one thing, he had two hearts--\"  Jones of the Air Force, a dignified, gray-haired man, paused in firing his cigar and gave the impression he was lighting his way through the darkness. Bright of the Navy, a thin man with a huge Adam's apple, allowed it to bob three times in deference to the startling nature of Brent's statement. Pender of the Army raised one eyebrow and let it fall. To a keen observer, Hagen of the FBI would have revealed prior knowledge by reacting not at all.  His mind was on the kid. He was thinking, _Christ! With all the damned miracle drugs and characters orbiting the earth in crazy capsules, they still haven't figured out a way to keep a six-year-old from getting a cold._ He remembered the kid waving from the window yesterday morning--when he'd been ordered East to attend this clambake--standing there beside Miriam, waving good-bye and barking like a sea lion. _What the hell was wrong with doctors? Why didn't they get with it on a stupidly simple thing like the common cold?_  \" ... two hearts and--\" Brent reached to the left and pulled down a chart on a window shade-type rack that stood beside his chair, \"--a rather interesting arrangement of the internal organs.\" He pointed with a thick finger. \"You'll notice that the liver is exceptionally small, while the kidneys are large enough to service a horse. You'll note also that while the man had testicles, there is no prostrate gland.\"  The group waited in a kind of guarded abeyance that could be easily sensed. Their silence gave the impression that they were asking: _Is somebody kidding us?_  But there was certainly no lightness in Brent's manner. His arm dropped and he scowled at the far end of the table as he said, \"Now, the blood. There was something strange about the blood--\"  The door from Marcia Holly's reception room-office opened and she came in silently, followed by a white-coated waiter who set a tray on the table. The coffeepot on the tray was silver; the cups, fine china; the napkins, linen.  \"--something very strange about the blood in that it conformed to all necessary specifications and yet it had a synthetic quality about it ...\"  Goose pimples formed on Hagen's neck and walked gently down his spine. Nothing was missing in this setup--synthetic blood, two hearts, oversize kidneys. Hagen got a quick mental flash of a barker outside a circus sideshow: _He walks like a man. He talks like a man. But for a thin dime, folks, you can see--_  It was something to think and wonder about. And back in Chicago, he'd had lots of company. Everybody in the office that night had wondered, and you could see the vague uneasiness in their eyes as the creature sat, acting like a human being and, at the same time, like nothing from this world. You could see a vague revulsion in the people surrounding the creature. There was also uncertainty, and this from men who were required by their profession to be fairly certain about most things.  \"The blood,\" Jones of the Air Force said. \"Could it have been a--well, a new kind of plasma?\"  \"Hardly. You see, the variation was almost theoretical, if you can understand the term as I'm using it. Drawn from an ordinary human being, it would not have been questioned. It was just that in the light of other oddities in his man, it didn't seem right, somehow.\"  \"Pretty vague,\" Bright of the Army said.  \"This I'll grant you.\" Brent said. \"Anybody for coffee?\"  Nobody was for coffee so Marcia and the waiter retired and Brent said, \"Vague, I'll grant you. But let's get on with it. Two days later, a man, in every way identical, was found lying in the street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was alive, but in a dying condition, and he succumbed on the way to the hospital. Cause of death, as in the first place, undeterminable. But the medics think it was some malfunctioning of the lungs.  \"All in all, gentlemen, eight identical specimens have been picked up in various American cities. Five are dead, two more are now in a comatose condition, at last report, and may very well be dead at this time. One is still alive and relatively healthy....\"  Alive and relatively healthy. The son-of-a-bitch! Hagen felt an odd senseless rage against the creature they'd picked up in a Chicago bar.  Ordinarily it would have been a simple"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20856"],["title","Ten From Infinity (#3)"],["body","-pen, night-court case--a loud-mouth drunk refusing to pay for a drink. But much of his talk, anent enemy invasion, internal destruction, and civilian chaos, had been a little too rough for the other barflies to swallow, and complaints had been made. Later, when Bureau men went around trying to get something tangible in the way of evidence, they found themselves dealing in frustration. The complainants had left without giving their names. The barkeep really hadn't heard anything. The actual charges had gone up in smoke. But by that time, Washington was very much interested. The man was questioned and it was the damnedest thing Hagen had ever gone through ...  \"By identical,\" Jones of the Air Force said, \"you of course mean--\"  Brent's dark, knifelike eyes sliced out at Jones. \"By identical, I mean just that.\"  Bright's throat bobbed as the astonishing implication came home to him. \"Hell, man! You mean--\"  \"I mean these specimens do not merely bear a resemblance to each other. They were not just similar as to organisms and physical structure. They were all _exactly_ alike; as alike as eight new cars of the same make and model lined up side by side ...\"  _Identical._ Hagen didn't know anything about that. He hadn't seen the others. But he knew that there was something frightening about the one they'd picked up in Chicago. At first glance he could have been Mr. Anybody, from Anywhere, U.S.A. A youngish-looking forty, you would have figured, with a sprinkling of gray at the temples and a face women could have found interesting. He had the unpaunched figure of a man who had taken good care of himself; he was quietly dressed in a blue suit; he looked like a decent-enough guy who just happened to have gotten stiff on the double hooker he'd ordered and sounded off without meaning to.  In fact, he was still sounding off when they got him into the interrogation room. And when the barflies called his talk treasonable, they hadn't been fooling.  Brent said, \"Identical, gentlemen, even to the finger-prints; to the very last ridge.\"  Pender's eyebrows tried to crawl up his forehead and disappear into his hairline. \"That's utterly and completely ridiculous.\"  Brent smiled. \"Then, at least, I've gotten one idea over to you--that a public release on this thing would be greeted with hoots of derision by the realistic American public.\"  \"And perhaps deservedly so?\"  \"I think not,\" Brent said gravely.  _Is it some incredibly ingenious hoax?_ Hagen asked himself the question and found no answer. He only remembered the words and the eyes and the tone of the creature that walked like a man ...  \"He was our--father. They had him a long time before we--came. He was our father, and after we came they told us what we were to know and we knew--it.\"  There it was--that odd little break, cutting off the word at the end of each sentence. It gave the impression of a mind groping, yet not really groping; a mind sure of itself, yet wondering.  \"What did you know?\"  \"We knew what we were--for. Our--reason. We knew what we were created to do--here.\"  \"How many of you were there?\"  \"Ten of--us.\"  \"You said, 'created to do here.' Where do you come from?\"  \"There.\"  \"Where is _there_?\"  At this point the man or the creature, or whatever you wanted to call him, pointed upward.  At this point, Cantrell, another of the interrogation group, turned away in disgust. \"A kook! A kook with a religious compulsion. A character, and we got called out of bed to--\"  \"--to get you ready to be destroyed,\" the creature cut in.  \"By fire and brimstone on judgment day?\" Cantrell asked sarcastically.  \"No. By rendering you helpless by--\"  Here the creature swallowed, blinked and looked surprised--and changed magically. He--if it really was a he--didn't jump up and kick a hole in the ceiling or anything like that. In fact, nothing tangible happened. There just seemed to be an invisible barrier that rose suddenly around him.  Then there was the thing that chilled every man in the room; a thing as tangible as the walls and the furniture; yet a thing no man could define in words.  This was when Cantrell, a high-strung individual at best, reacted violently to the change in the creature. In an instinctive blaze of anger and frustration, Cantrell reached out and slapped him brutally across the face.  Velie, the agent in charge, also acted instinctively as he lunged forward to restrain Cantrell. But then he froze, as did all the men in the room, to stare.  It was not what the prisoner did; it was what he did not do. There was absolutely no reaction to the blow--no reaction physically, emotionally, or mentally. It was as though the blow had not been struck; as though this were some kind of a moving, breathing zombie.  So tangible, so seemingly sourceless was this feeling of loathing, that Hagen would have been sure it had affected only himself if he had not seen its effect on the others.  Yet none of them referred to it. Nor was this strange, because there just weren't any words to describe the feeling one gets from contact with a pleasant-faced, quietly dressed example of the walking dead.  Backing away from this powerful emotional reaction, Hagen forced himself onto an intellectual level, and asked himself what had brought about the change in the creature. Why had it--Hagen now had to regard the strange, walking enigma as neuter--after functioning to some extent as a human, reverted suddenly to what seemed to be its natural state?  He conceded that if he knew the answer to that one, he could be of great service to the FBI and the nation--and, no doubt to the world ...  Pender of the Army now had a question. \"What information have you gotten from the surviving man?\"  \"Not a great deal, as yet. However, in our experiments we've learned something rather frightening.\"  \"And what's that?\"  \"He is totally impervious to drugs of any description whatever.\"  \"That's impossible!\"  \"So it would seem. But the sodium pentathol injection he was given could just as well have been so much water.\"  The group pondered this information, each after his own fashion. Then Birch of the State Department made a precise, scholarly observation. \"Incredible!\"  Brent smiled faintly. \"One point of vital importance. We do know that there were, originally, ten of these creatures roaming the country. Eight are accounted for. The other two are still at large.\"  Jones of the Air Force asked, \"Were all eight apprehended in large cities?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Shouldn't that mean something to us?\"  \"Well, it's a pattern, all right, but no one's been able to give it any meaning--so far.\"  No one had any further comment on that point. Brent waited a moment and then threw the bombshell. \"We are quite sure that these creatures are of extraterrestrial origin.\"  For a time it seemed as though Brent's bombshell had been a dud. There was no comment from around the table--no sound of any kind. But each man was evaluating the information after his own fashion. The key thought, no doubt, other than a natural and instinctive moment of sheer unbelief, was that this marked a giant, forward lunge in world history. And also, no doubt, in this group of responsible men, there was a common question: It would appear that our world had at last come to grips with the universe around it. Was our world ready?  And there was general doubt.  Now the questions came. From whence? To what purpose? Hostile? Benign? Dangerous? Harmless?  \"What other information was gained from the creature?\"  \"Very little. He knows our language. He is here for a definite and clear-cut purpose. Probably hostile. But what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to accomplish it we do not know.\"  \"Do you think you will eventually get these answers?\"  \"I think,\" and there was an ominous note in Brent's voice, \"that we will. If not from the creature himself, then in some sudden and far more violent manner.\"  This statement also had impact. It seemed that the group had overlooked Brent's previous revelation that ten of the creatures had arrived and only eight had been accounted for.  \"Perhaps,\" Jones said hopefully, \"whatever their plan, it required the participation of all ten.\"  \"In that case,\" Brent said quietly, \"we have nothing to worry about. At least, at the moment.\"  \"Are you of the opinion that these creatures have been dropped anywhere else on earth?\"  \"All I can say on that score is that all seems quiet around the world. Of course, if Russia has rounded up a quota of these two-hearted characters they wouldn't be likely to tell us. They certainly haven't shown up in the European countries with whom we consult. All I can say about the situation behind the Iron Curtain is that they have made no inquiries of us relative to the matter--and we certainly have made no inquiries of them. Also, our people in the sensitive Eastern areas report nothing indicative.\"  Pender bobbed his throat and said, \"You told us you're sure the creatures are from outer space. That makes our interests with Russia mutual. Therefore, why shouldn't open inquiry be made?\"  Brent frowned. \"An entirely logical question. As a matter of fact, I recommended that course. Nothing has been down in that direction, however. At least, not to my knowledge.\"  \"I assume the White House knows about this.\"  Brent nodded but did not elaborate, perhaps because to have done so would have tended to clarify his own connection with the top spot in the nation; a relationship accepted but not thoroughly understood by any man present.  \"May I inquire as to Senator Crane?\" Bright asked.  \"I see no reason why you shouldn't.\"  \"He was in your anteroom when I entered. Obviously he was mad. I assume that was because you excluded him from this meeting.\"  \"Correct.\" Brent Taber's eyes turned a trifle steely. \"In fact, I'd like to know exactly how he found out about the meeting.\"  No one offered any data on this point and Bright asked, \"Is it wise to keep information of this vital nature from the United States Senate?\"  \"Th"]]]
