Do you know?\"  \"Where we are? Surely. Looking at it in one way, we're less than a mile from my laboratory.\"  \"But, Vic!\" I protested. \"Do you really mean that we're less than a mile from your laboratory; from our own world? If we were, we could see it; we'd bump into our own trees and houses and people; we'd be knocked down by automobiles, and--\"  \"Two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Old law of simple physics. Is that what you mean?\" interrupted Vic.  \"Why, yes.\"  \"And a body; what's that?\"  \"A body? Why, matter, I suppose.\"  \"And matter is what?\"  \"Anything that occupies space,\" I replied triumphantly. I had remembered that much from my physics classes.  \"True,\" smiled Vic. \"But let's see. It is possible to have sound and light in the same place, isn't it? We can even add other things: heat and electricity, for example. Speaking of electricity, a tremendous current of it adds nothing to the weight of the wire carrying it, and nothing to its bulk, unless we have a heating overload. Current enough to kill a thousand men, or to do the work of a million horses, weighs nothing, is invisible, and actually does nothing until released in some form or other, either by accident or design.\"  \"True, but electricity isn't matter. Our old world is matter; I'm matter, and you're matter. Why don't we bump into things?\"  \"Our old world is matter, true enough, but for the rest, you're wrong, Pete, old son. You're _not_ matter, any more. You're something else. In terms of our own being, you do not exist in your present form. This world does not exist. And the reverse is just as true.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I stared at him, bewildered.  \"What am I, then--a ghost?\"  \"Nothing of the sort. You're old Pete Grahame, a darned good half-back, and the world's rottenest scientist. Only you've been passed into another form of being, through the action of four little quartz bulbs whose periods of vibrations form a beat--but that's over your head, Pete, old son, and we'll have time to talk over details when we get back. Right now, we're in somewhat of a jam.\" Instinctively, he glanced at Hope; it was her danger, and not his own, that had brought that haggard pallor to his face in so short a time.  \"That's what I don't understand. What do these people--if you can call them that--want of us?\"  Vic looked down, frowning.  \"I'm not sure I'm right,\" he replied after a moment, \"but if I am--they wish us to kill them. As many as possible.  \"When I found myself here, I wandered nearly to the city before I was molested. When they did appear, and tried to lay hands on me, I warned them back, and finally shot one of them.  \"The effect was magical. They seemed unable to believe the evidence of their eyes. They rushed me eagerly, each seeming to beg for a bullet.  \"I gave them what they wanted, still hoping I could frighten them away. A great crowd formed around me, and the rabble was sent flying by a number of the men who seem to hold some office, distinguished by a jewel-like emblem around their throats. If I read their actions correctly, they claimed the privilege of death by virtue of their greater authority.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, I finally decided that my gun did anything but frighten them. They were angry when I refused to do any more slaughtering, and led me here. Every once in a while one of the captains would come in and command me to kill him. I refused, for that's the only trump card I held.  \"When Hope, here, acted like the foolish little kid she is, she was not even armed, and they rushed her here without delay. My theory is that these people live in a dreary world in which there is no pleasure. Their faces seem to show that. Apparently they live a very long time, and have no means of shortening that life. They are not intelligent. Things that would kill a man of our own world have no effect on them, for remember that they are not physical beings. You have seen them appear out of thin air, and dissolve in the same fashion?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That is simply their mode of transportation. They pass invisibly through the air, just as electricity passes through a wire; quickly, invisibly, silently. Then they assume their original form where they will--just, again, as electricity passes from the end of the wire exactly the same as it entered it, allowing only for voltage drops and some other factors that aren't pertinent here.  \"What we must do, and right now, is to settle upon some means of getting to the proper spot at the proper time. You marked the moment of your departure, I suppose?\"  \"Exactly.\" I glanced down at my wrist watch, and noted with relief that it was still running. I observed then, for the first time, that the watch, my clothing, and even my hand, were not real; they were like the rest of the things in this monstrous state that Vic called Infra-Media. \"I left at three after ten. It's now fourteen minutes of eleven--Good Lord! Less than an hour since I stood there in your laboratory!\"  \"Then our next chance to get back will be at three minutes after one,\" nodded Vic. \"I wonder if there is any chance of--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Before he could complete the sentence the door was flung open, and five of the older men, led by a sixth with a larger jewel at his throat, filed solemnly into the room and motioned that we were to leave.  At the doorway, a double file of creatures closed in about us, and we were led, by long corridors and mighty winding ramps, toward the top of the building.  \"Now what?\" I whispered to Vic.  \"I don't know. That chap with the big stone at his throat seems to be the head man of the city. I think his name is Ee-pay; the others seem to call him that. Maybe it's just a title. But what they're up to now, I can't even guess. Keep your eyes open for a chance to get away, though. How are you feeling, Hope?\"  \"All excited!\" She tried to smile, and almost succeeded. Hope was game all the way through. \"What an adventure this will be to talk about when we're old and rheumatic!\"  \"Good kid!\" said Vic, and I pressed her hand as comfortably as I could. We turned a bend in the long ramp we had been climbing, and came out upon the vast, level top of the building.  Thousands of the unreal creatures of this world were crowded around a vast, hideous image that rose from the center of the space; a monster so terrible that Hope cried out at the sight, and Vic exclaimed under his breath.  For myself, I seemed stricken dumb; I could only stare at this black and ghastly god of these people.         *       *       *       *       *  The carven image was perhaps thirty feet in height, and represented a figure crouched upon its knees, its head bent very low and at the same time tilted at a grotesque angle so that the face smiled heavenward; the hands, palms upward, extended invitingly just below the chin.  As our party appeared, an aisle opened, and we were marched through the assembled crowd, directly toward the idol. A high-pitched, sibilant chant arose from the multitude, and a procession of very ancient beings, whom I took to be the priests of this god, came in single file from behind the black god, directing the chanting with movements of their arms. They were lighter in color than the others, and much more intelligent, to judge by their faces. Their eyes held none of the sadness which was the most marked characteristic of the others. Each wore upon his forehead a gleaming scarlet stone, bound in place by a circlet of black metal, or what looked like metal.  We paused, and the chanting went on and on, until I began to wonder if anything would ever happen. And then, at last the chanting ceased, and three of the priests moved toward us, followed by an elderly being who wore the same symbol of power or authority that I had already noted upon the creature Vic called Ee-pay.  One of the priests spoke sharply, commandingly, to Ee-pay, and the latter nodded--not agreeably it seemed to me.  \"The old boy doesn't like these other chaps; priests, I take it,\" whispered Vic. \"I think they've been messing up his plans. See; he's motioning us to watch.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The priests led the old man back to the idol. Eagerly, he clambered upon the outstretched hands, and stood there facing the grinning face, stroking the polished cheeks with beseeching fingers. The priests sank to the floor, bending themselves in mockery of the image. Four times they touched their foreheads to the ground, and as the fourth gesture was completed something moved swiftly behind the lips of the image, as though a plate had lifted for a moment and dropped again.  There was a sharp, murmuring sound, as of a harp-string softly plucked. A scarlet haze of light shot forth from the mouth of the black god, and the old man stepped back sharply as though struck by some invisible agent. He would have fallen, but as he crumpled, his body seemed to soften and shatter into a scintillating cloud. An instant later there was no trace of him anywhere.  \"Hm-m! The great reward for some notable service rendered, I imagine,\" whispered Vic. \"Those priests are wiser than the rest of this crew. They deal death sparingly, and that makes them great. They love life like a man of our earth; perhaps because they've found out how to enjoy it.\"  \"But what does the work; what killed him?\" I asked breathlessly.  \"Can't say, Pete. You can't name things here in terms of our own world. Some natural force they've corraled, I imagine. They control it with that shutter behind the lips of the image. Did you notice it?\"  \"Yes. I suppose one of the priests operates it from some hidden room. Whatever it is, it certainly does the work. And what do you suppose they want us to do now?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The three priests were coming toward us, smiling. I didn't like"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20838"],["title","The Infra-Medians (#3)"],["body","smiles; they were meant to be benign, but there was a cruel and vindictive twist to their lips which chilled me through and through.  \"Keep your hand on your gun,\" said Vic swiftly. \"I don't like the looks of these chaps.\"  The priests stopped before us and their leader began a long harangue in a screechy voice which set my nerves on edge. When he had finished he held out his hands toward me, and motioned toward the waiting idol.  Ee-pay spoke up in sharp protest, and thrust himself between me and the priest. For a moment, due to this obviously unexpected interruption, everything was in confusion.  \"Pete!\" Vic was whispering excitedly in my ear. \"Listen, Pete, I think I see through this. These priests have heard about us and our death-dealing ability. They're jealous; they want a corner on that. Old Ee-pay figures maybe we could do him a favor in that line, and that's why he's arguing. The priests want to honor us for the good we've done--by giving us the reward we've just seen. So--\"  Before he could finish, Ee-pay was thrust aside by a group of angry guards, and I was jerked away. Hope screamed, and out of the tail of my eye I saw both Vic and Hope struggling frantically to free themselves from an overwhelming number of guards. Vic tried to shout something, but a claw-like brown hand was immediately thrust over his mouth.         *       *       *       *       *  The guards who held me, followed by the priests, made their way toward the extended palms which formed the altar of this strange black god whose favor was death. At a command from the priests, the guards lifted me to the altar and then stood watchfully below, gazing up at me with puzzled, mournful, envious eyes.  I saw the priests crouch low, and make their first beseeching bow, in imitation of the black god. Frantically, I looked about me, seeking some avenue of escape.  Below me, hemming me in, were the guards; a triple ring of them, through which I knew I could not escape. Behind me, for I was facing the multitude, was the hideous, grinning face of the idol.  The priests bowed a second time.  Both Hope and Vic were fighting desperately, but there were at least ten guards to each of them. I lifted my hand and waved a farewell, hoping that one of them at least would see the gesture and know that my last thought was of them.  Then, as the priests completed their third bow, I turned and faced the statue.  As my eyes fell upon the shutter behind the thick, grinning lips, the shutter which released the lethal force, a wild and desperate idea came to me. With a shout, I jerked the gun from my pocket and leaped aside. As I did so, I fired twice into the gaping mouth, and saw the bullets shatter the heavy shutter. Then, with the humming sound ringing in my ears like a note of death, I leaped clear, into the midst of the waiting guards.         *       *       *       *       *  For an instant, there was no movement, no sound, from all that vast crowd. Even the guards seemed stunned, and I tore my way through them with hardly a pause in my stride.  Then a shrill cry went up; a cry that drowned utterly the humming sound that issued from the shattered mouth of the idol. Blindly, the multitude surged towards the scarlet ray that dealt death, fighting their way toward the oblivion they so highly prized.  Those who had been holding Hope and Vic were surging forward with the rest, their erstwhile prisoners forgotten in their mad greed for death. The crowd jostling about me seemed blind to my presence; every eye was fixed on the altar-like hands of the idol, and the death that blew across them.  \"Pete!\" yelled Vic. \"Coming, boy?\" He was waiting for me, staving off as best he could the rush of bodies around him; shielding Hope from the savage jostling.  \"Coming!\" I leaned forward, butting with my head, both doubled fists working like pistons to clear a way to my companions.  \"Nice work, Pete!\" shouted Vic, as I joined them, breathless but triumphant. \"Now for a break! Gun loaded?\"  I snapped open the action and dropped in six cartridges.  \"It is now. I'll go ahead; you bring up the rear with Hope in the middle. Ready?\"  \"Let's go!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I plunged on, Hope's fingers gripping my belt. Fresh multitudes were pouring up the ramp, brushing aside the five or six priests that had hurried there in an effort to stem the tide.  One of the priests saw us, and cried out shrilly to his companions. With one accord they came toward us, obviously intent upon blocking our way. I have never seen in any other eyes such anger and hatred as blazed in the eyes of those strange beings.  \"Watch them, Pete!\" roared Vic. \"We can't take chances!\" His gun roared twice from behind me, and two of the priests fell writhing, to be instantly trampled into pulp. Another reached out long arms toward Hope, and I let him have it. There was nothing else to do. He went the way of the two others.  Twice again, before we reached the ramp they guarded, the angry attendants of the idol fell before our guns. Then, hurrying down ramp after ramp, corridor after corridor, fighting the rushing mob all the way, we came at last, shaking with weariness and gasping for breath, to the deserted streets of this black and terrible city.  \"Are we free?\" whispered Hope, holding tightly to my arm. \"Are we really free?\"  \"I hope so, dear. We seem to be. If we can only reach the spot where we entered this insane world before something happens--\"  \"How much time have we?\" interrupted Vic.  I glanced down at my watch, fearful, for a moment, that it had been broken or lost in the melée. It was still running, apparently undamaged.  \"Let's see; it's four minutes of one. That gives us seven minutes. Can we make it?\"  \"I think so. It's not so far, and we're nearly out of the city. We _have_ to make it!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Vic led the way, Hope and I following. Anxiously, I watched the minute hand of the watch slide toward the \"XII\" of the dial ... touch it ... move on....  It was not far, as Vic had said, but we were weary from our battle with the crazed mob, and the best we could force from our legs was a sort of dog-trot.  One minute after ... two....  \"Here's the spot! I marked it with these three pieces of stone. Quick!\" Vic swept both arms about Hope and me, holding us in a close embrace, so that we all stood within the triangle formed by the three bits of black rock.  I glanced down at my watch. It lacked but a few seconds of the moment when the machine back in Vic's laboratory would function--provided my watch was correct, and the equipment worked according to schedule.  Suddenly, Hope screamed, and I followed her eyes. A score or more of the strange beings had suddenly materialized but a few yards away, and they were closing in on us swiftly.  I tried to draw my gun. Hands reached out to grasp me; to grasp all three of us. Then darkness closed in swiftly; I was whisked upward, on and on, breathlessly. I was suddenly very heavy; I was dropping in the blackness ... there was something solid beneath my feet ... a glare of light in my eyes.  \"Nicely timed, I'll say that,\" chuckled Vic. \"How does our own material little old world look?\"  \"Great!\" I stepped quickly away from the machine, drawing Hope with me. \"Doesn't it, Hope?\"  She sighed, a long, shuddering sigh, and snuggled into my arms. Vic glanced towards us and grinned.  \"Come to think of it,\" he remarked, \"I believe I'll run along and see if I can find Mrs. Perrin. I haven't had a thing to eat since noon yesterday, and I've just realized I'm hungry. Will you join me?\"  \"In a moment,\" I nodded, and Vic, being the good scout he was, hurried away.         *       *       *       *       *  \"And the machine?\" I asked a few nights later. \"Still experimenting with it?\" I had really come out to see Hope, of course, but she was still upstairs, putting on the finishing touches.  Vic shook his head quite gravely.  \"No, old son; I had enough. Off on another tangent now. Why--would you like to go back?\"  \"Not me! It doesn't seem real now; more like a nightmare, but it was terrible enough at the time.\"  \"I can prove it wasn't a nightmare,\" chuckled Vic. \"Come along, and I'll show you something you missed.\" He led the way to the laboratory, and unlocked a drawer, one of several, beneath the work table.  \"I found this on the floor of the machine,\" he said. \"Didn't notice it until later. The rays of the machine caught it and brought it back with us; made it solid matter, as we know it here. Do you recognize it?\"  I nodded, shuddering. There was no possibility of mistake.  In a squat, clear bottle of alcohol that Vic had taken from the drawer was a sinister, claw-like brown hand, severed cleanly at the wrist."]]]
