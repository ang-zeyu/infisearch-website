He jerked away, as if he expected to be struck. \"Girl--I--I\"--he gasped in amaze and sudden-dawning contrition--\"I kissed you--but I swear it wasn't intentional--I never thought....\"  The anger that Jean anticipated failed to materialize.  He stood, breathing hard, with a hand held out in unconscious appeal.  By the same magic, perhaps, that had transfigured her a moment past, she was now invested again by the older character.  \"Shore I reckon my callin' y'u a gentleman was a little previous,\" she said, with a rather dry bitterness.  \"But, stranger, yu're sudden.\"  \"You're not insulted?\" asked Jean, hurriedly.  \"Oh, I've been kissed before.  Shore men are all alike.\"  \"They're not,\" he replied, hotly, with a subtle rush of disillusion, a dulling of enchantment.  \"Don't you class me with other men who've kissed you.  I wasn't myself when I did it an' I'd have gone on my knees to ask your forgiveness.... But now I wouldn't--an' I wouldn't kiss you again, either--even if you--you wanted it.\"  Jean read in her strange gaze what seemed to him a vague doubt, as if she was questioning him.  \"Miss, I take that back,\" added Jean, shortly.  \"I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to be rude.  It was a mean trick for me to kiss you.  A girl alone in the woods who's gone out of her way to be kind to me!  I don't know why I forgot my manners.  An' I ask your pardon.\"  She looked away then, and presently pointed far out and down into the Basin.  \"There's Grass Valley.  That long gray spot in the black.  It's about fifteen miles.  Ride along the Rim that way till y'u cross a trail. Shore y'u can't miss it.  Then go down.\"  \"I'm much obliged to you,\" replied Jean, reluctantly accepting what he regarded as his dismissal.  Turning his horse, he put his foot in the stirrup, then, hesitating, he looked across the saddle at the girl. Her abstraction, as she gazed away over the purple depths suggested loneliness and wistfulness.  She was not thinking of that scene spread so wondrously before her.  It struck Jean she might be pondering a subtle change in his feeling and attitude, something he was conscious of, yet could not define.  \"Reckon this is good-by,\" he said, with hesitation.  \"ADIOS, SENOR,\" she replied, facing him again.  She lifted the little carbine to the hollow of her elbow and, half turning, appeared ready to depart.  \"Adios means good-by?\" he queried.  \"Yes, good-by till to-morrow or good-by forever.  Take it as y'u like.\"  \"Then you'll meet me here day after to-morrow?\"  How eagerly he spoke, on impulse, without a consideration of the intangible thing that had changed him!  \"Did I say I wouldn't?\"  \"No.  But I reckoned you'd not care to after--\" he replied, breaking off in some confusion.  \"Shore I'll be glad to meet y'u.  Day after to-morrow about mid-afternoon.  Right heah.  Fetch all the news from Grass Valley.\"  \"All right.  Thanks.  That'll be--fine,\" replied Jean, and as he spoke he experienced a buoyant thrill, a pleasant lightness of enthusiasm, such as always stirred boyishly in him at a prospect of adventure. Before it passed he wondered at it and felt unsure of himself. He needed to think.  \"Stranger shore I'm not recollectin' that y'u told me who y'u are,\" she said.  \"No, reckon I didn't tell,\" he returned.  \"What difference does that make?  I said I didn't care who or what you are.  Can't you feel the same about me?\"  \"Shore--I felt that way,\" she replied, somewhat non-plussed, with the level brown gaze steadily on his face.  \"But now y'u make me think.\"  \"Let's meet without knowin' any more about each other than we do now.\"  \"Shore.  I'd like that.  In this big wild Arizona a girl--an' I reckon a man--feels so insignificant.  What's a name, anyhow?  Still, people an' things have to be distinguished.  I'll call y'u 'Stranger' an' be satisfied--if y'u say it's fair for y'u not to tell who y'u are.\"  \"Fair!  No, it's not,\" declared Jean, forced to confession.  \"My name's Jean--Jean Isbel.\"  \"ISBEL!\" she exclaimed, with a violent start.  \"Shore y'u can't be son of old Gass Isbel.... I've seen both his sons.\"  \"He has three,\" replied Jean, with relief, now the secret was out. \"I'm the youngest.  I'm twenty-four.  Never been out of Oregon till now.  On my way--\"  The brown color slowly faded out of her face, leaving her quite pale, with eyes that began to blaze.  The suppleness of her seemed to stiffen.  \"My name's Ellen Jorth,\" she burst out, passionately.  \"Does it mean anythin' to y'u?\"  \"Never heard it in my life,\" protested Jean.  \"Sure I reckoned you belonged to the sheep raisers who 're on the outs with my father. That's why I had to tell you I'm Jean Isbel.... Ellen Jorth. It's strange an' pretty.... Reckon I can be just as good a--a friend to you--\"  \"No Isbel, can ever be a friend to me,\" she said, with bitter coldness. Stripped of her ease and her soft wistfulness, she stood before him one instant, entirely another girl, a hostile enemy.  Then she wheeled and strode off into the woods.  Jean, in amaze, in consternation, watched her swiftly draw away with her lithe, free step, wanting to follow her, wanting to call to her; but the resentment roused by her suddenly avowed hostility held him mute in his tracks.  He watched her disappear, and when the brown-and-green wall of forest swallowed the slender gray form he fought against the insistent desire to follow her, and fought in vain.    CHAPTER II  But Ellen Jorth's moccasined feet did not leave a distinguishable trail on the springy pine needle covering of the ground, and Jean could not find any trace of her.  A little futile searching to and fro cooled his impulse and called pride to his rescue.  Returning to his horse, he mounted, rode out behind the pack mule to start it along, and soon felt the relief of decision and action.  Clumps of small pines grew thickly in spots on the Rim, making it necessary for him to skirt them; at which times he lost sight of the purple basin.  Every time he came back to an opening through which he could see the wild ruggedness and colors and distances, his appreciation of their nature grew on him. Arizona from Yuma to the Little Colorado had been to him an endless waste of wind-scoured, sun-blasted barrenness.  This black-forested rock-rimmed land of untrodden ways was a world that in itself would satisfy him. Some instinct in Jean called for a lonely, wild land, into the fastnesses of which he could roam at will and be the other strange self that he had always yearned to be but had never been.  Every few moments there intruded into his flowing consciousness the flashing face of Ellen Jorth, the way she had looked at him, the things she had said.  \"Reckon I was a fool,\" he soliloquized, with an acute sense of humiliation.  \"She never saw how much in earnest I was.\"  And Jean began to remember the circumstances with a vividness that disturbed and perplexed him.  The accident of running across such a girl in that lonely place might be out of the ordinary--but it had happened.  Surprise had made him dull. The charm of her appearance, the appeal of her manner, must have drawn him at the very first, but he had not recognized that.  Only at her words, \"Oh, I've been kissed before,\" had his feelings been checked in their heedless progress.  And the utterance of them had made a difference he now sought to analyze.  Some personality in him, some voice, some idea had begun to defend her even before he was conscious that he had arraigned her before the bar of his judgment.  Such defense seemed clamoring in him now and he forced himself to listen.  He wanted, in his hurt pride, to justify his amazing surrender to a sweet and sentimental impulse.  He realized now that at first glance he should have recognized in her look, her poise, her voice the quality he called thoroughbred.  Ragged and stained apparel did not prove her of a common sort.  Jean had known a number of fine and wholesome girls of good family; and he remembered his sister.  This Ellen Jorth was that kind of a girl irrespective of her present environment.  Jean championed her loyally, even after he had gratified his selfish pride.  It was then--contending with an intangible and stealing glamour, unreal and fanciful, like the dream of a forbidden enchantment--that Jean arrived at the part in the little woodland drama where he had kissed Ellen Jorth and had been unrebuked.  Why had she not resented his action?  Dispelled was the illusion he had been dreamily and nobly constructing.  \"Oh, I've been kissed before!\"  The shock to him now exceeded his first dismay.  Half bitterly she had spoken, and wholly scornful of herself, or of him, or of all men.  For she had said all men were alike.  Jean chafed under the smart of that, a taunt every decent man hated.  Naturally every happy and healthy young man would want to kiss such red, sweet lips.  But if those lips had been for others--never for him!  Jean reflected that not since childish games had he kissed a girl--until this brown-faced Ellen Jorth came his way. He wondered at it.  Moreover, he wondered at the significance he placed upon it.  After all, was it not merely an accident?  Why should he remember?  Why should he ponder?  What was the faint, deep, growing thrill that accompanied some of his thoughts?  Riding along with busy mind, Jean almost crossed a well-beaten trail, leading through a pine thicket and down over the Rim.  Jean's pack mule led the way without being driven.  And when Jean reached the edge of the bluff one look down was enough to fetch him off his horse. That trail was steep, narrow, clogged with stones, and as full of sharp corners as a crosscut saw.  Once on the descent with a packed mule and a spirited horse, Jean had no time for mind wanderings and very little for occasional glimpses out over the cedar tops to the vast blue hollow asleep under a westering sun.  The stones rattled, the dust rose, the cedar twigs snapped, the little avalanches of red earth slid down, the iron-shod"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],["title","To the Last Man (#5)"],["body"," hoofs rang on the rocks. This slope had been narrow at the apex in the Rim where the trail led down a crack, and it widened in fan shape as Jean descended. He zigzagged down a thousand feet before the slope benched into dividing ridges.  Here the cedars and junipers failed and pines once more hid the sun.  Deep ravines were black with brush.  From somewhere rose a roar of running water, most pleasant to Jean's ears.  Fresh deer and bear tracks covered old ones made in the trail.  Those timbered ridges were but billows of that tremendous slope that now sheered above Jean, ending in a magnificent yellow wall of rock, greened in niches, stained by weather rust, carved and cracked and caverned.  As Jean descended farther the hum of bees made melody, the roar of rapid water and the murmur of a rising breeze filled him with the content of the wild.  Sheepmen like Colter and wild girls like Ellen Jorth and all that seemed promising or menacing in his father's letter could never change the Indian in Jean.  So he thought.  Hard upon that conclusion rushed another--one which troubled with its stinging revelation.  Surely these influences he had defied were just the ones to bring out in him the Indian he had sensed but had never known.  The eventful day had brought new and bitter food for Jean to reflect upon.  The trail landed him in the bowlder-strewn bed of a wide canyon, where the huge trees stretched a canopy of foliage which denied the sunlight, and where a beautiful brook rushed and foamed.  Here at last Jean tasted water that rivaled his Oregon springs.  \"Ah,\" he cried, \"that sure is good!\"  Dark and shaded and ferny and mossy was this streamway; and everywhere were tracks of game, from the giant spread of a grizzly bear to the tiny, birdlike imprints of a squirrel.  Jean heard familiar sounds of deer crackling the dead twigs; and the chatter of squirrels was incessant.  This fragrant, cool retreat under the Rim brought back to him the dim recesses of Oregon forests.  After all, Jean felt that he would not miss anything that he had loved in the Cascades.  But what was the vague sense of all not being well with him--the essence of a faint regret--the insistence of a hovering shadow?  And then flashed again, etched more vividly by the repetition in memory, a picture of eyes, of lips--of something he had to forget.  Wild and broken as this rolling Basin floor had appeared from the Rim, the reality of traveling over it made that first impression a deceit of distance.  Down here all was on a big, rough, broken scale.  Jean did not find even a few rods of level ground.  Bowlders as huge as houses obstructed the stream bed; spruce trees eight feet thick tried to lord it over the brawny pines; the ravine was a veritable canyon from which occasional glimpses through the foliage showed the Rim as a lofty red-tipped mountain peak.  Jean's pack mule became frightened at scent of a bear or lion and ran off down the rough trail, imperiling Jean's outfit.  It was not an easy task to head him off nor, when that was accomplished, to keep him to a trot.  But his fright and succeeding skittishness at least made for fast traveling.  Jean calculated that he covered ten miles under the Rim before the character of ground and forest began to change.  The trail had turned southeast.  Instead of gorge after gorge, red-walled and choked with forest, there began to be rolling ridges, some high; others were knolls; and a thick cedar growth made up for a falling off of pine.  The spruce had long disappeared.  Juniper thickets gave way more and more to the beautiful manzanita; and soon on the south slopes appeared cactus and a scrubby live oak.  But for the well-broken trail, Jean would have fared ill through this tough brush.  Jean espied several deer, and again a coyote, and what he took to be a small herd of wild horses.  No more turkey tracks showed in the dusty patches.  He crossed a number of tiny brooklets, and at length came to a place where the trail ended or merged in a rough road that showed evidence of considerable travel.  Horses, sheep, and cattle had passed along there that day.  This road turned southward, and Jean began to have pleasurable expectations.  The road, like the trail, led down grade, but no longer at such steep angles, and was bordered by cedar and pinyon, jack-pine and juniper, mescal and manzanita.  Quite sharply, going around a ridge, the road led Jean's eye down to a small open flat of marshy, or at least grassy, ground.  This green oasis in the wilderness of red and timbered ridges marked another change in the character of the Basin.  Beyond that the country began to spread out and roll gracefully, its dark-green forest interspersed with grassy parks, until Jean headed into a long, wide gray-green valley surrounded by black-fringed hills.  His pulses quickened here.  He saw cattle dotting the expanse, and here and there along the edge log cabins and corrals.  As a village, Grass Valley could not boast of much, apparently, in the way of population.  Cabins and houses were widely scattered, as if the inhabitants did not care to encroach upon one another.  But the one store, built of stone, and stamped also with the characteristic isolation, seemed to Jean to be a rather remarkable edifice.  Not exactly like a fort did it strike him, but if it had not been designed for defense it certainly gave that impression, especially from the long, low side with its dark eye-like windows about the height of a man's shoulder.  Some rather fine horses were tied to a hitching rail. Otherwise dust and dirt and age and long use stamped this Grass Valley store and its immediate environment.  Jean threw his bridle, and, getting down, mounted the low porch and stepped into the wide open door.  A face, gray against the background of gloom inside, passed out of sight just as Jean entered.  He knew he had been seen.  In front of the long, rather low-ceiled store were four men, all absorbed, apparently, in a game of checkers.  Two were playing and two were looking on.  One of these, a gaunt-faced man past middle age, casually looked up as Jean entered.  But the moment of that casual glance afforded Jean time enough to meet eyes he instinctively distrusted. They masked their penetration.  They seemed neither curious nor friendly. They saw him as if he had been merely thin air.  \"Good evenin',\" said Jean.  After what appeared to Jean a lapse of time sufficient to impress him with a possible deafness of these men, the gaunt-faced one said, \"Howdy, Isbel!\"  The tone was impersonal, dry, easy, cool, laconic, and yet it could not have been more pregnant with meaning.  Jean's sharp sensibilities absorbed much.  None of the slouch-sombreroed, long-mustached Texans--for so Jean at once classed them--had ever seen Jean, but they knew him and knew that he was expected in Grass Valley.  All but the one who had spoken happened to have their faces in shadow under the wide-brimmed black hats.  Motley-garbed, gun-belted, dusty-booted, they gave Jean the same impression of latent force that he had encountered in Colter.  \"Will somebody please tell me where to find my father, Gaston Isbel?\" inquired Jean, with as civil a tongue as he could command.  Nobody paid the slightest attention.  It was the same as if Jean had not spoken.  Waiting, half amused, half irritated, Jean shot a rapid glance around the store.  The place had felt bare; and Jean, peering back through gloomy space, saw that it did not contain much.  Dry goods and sacks littered a long rude counter; long rough shelves divided their length into stacks of canned foods and empty sections; a low shelf back of the counter held a generous burden of cartridge boxes, and next to it stood a rack of rifles.  On the counter lay open cases of plug tobacco, the odor of which was second in strength only to that of rum.  Jean's swift-roving eye reverted to the men, three of whom were absorbed in the greasy checkerboard.  The fourth man was the one who had spoken and he now deigned to look at Jean.  Not much flesh was there stretched over his bony, powerful physiognomy.  He stroked a lean chin with a big mobile hand that suggested more of bridle holding than familiarity with a bucksaw and plow handle.  It was a lazy hand.  The man looked lazy.  If he spoke at all it would be with lazy speech, yet Jean had not encountered many men to whom he would have accorded more potency to stir in him the instinct of self-preservation.  \"Shore,\" drawled this gaunt-faced Texan, \"old Gass lives aboot a mile down heah.\"  With slow sweep of the big hand he indicated a general direction to the south; then, appearing to forget his questioner, he turned his attention to the game.  Jean muttered his thanks and, striding out, he mounted again, and drove the pack mule down the road.  \"Reckon I've ran into the wrong folds to-day,\" he said.  \"If I remember dad right he was a man to make an' keep friends.  Somehow I'll bet there's goin' to be hell.\"  Beyond the store were some rather pretty and comfortable homes, little ranch houses back in the coves of the hills.  The road turned west and Jean saw his first sunset in the Tonto Basin.  It was a pageant of purple clouds with silver edges, and background of deep rich gold.  Presently Jean met a lad driving a cow.  \"Hello, Johnny!\" he said, genially, and with a double purpose.  \"My name's Jean Isbel.  By Golly! I'm lost in Grass Valley.  Will you tell me where my dad lives?\"  \"Yep.  Keep right on, an' y'u cain't miss him,\" replied the lad, with a bright smile.  \"He's lookin' fer y'u.\"  \"How do you know, boy?\" queried Jean, warmed by that smile.  \"Aw, I know.  It's all over the valley thet y'u'd ride in ter-day. Shore I wus the one thet tole yer dad an' he give me a dollar.\"  \"Was he glad to hear it?\" asked Jean, with a queer sensation in his throat.  \"Wal, he plumb was.\"  \"An' who told you I was goin' to ride in to-day?\"  \"I heerd it at the store,\" replied the lad, with an air of"]]]
