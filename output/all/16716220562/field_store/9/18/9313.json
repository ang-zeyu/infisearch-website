The little bars which intersect each square crossways, are made in two divisions, by carrying the thread to the opposite bar and back. In the same way, the second thread is carried over the first. The damask stitches are described in the next chapter, in figs. 143 and 144.  [Illustration: FIG. 103. LATTICE-GROUND WITH A PORTION OF SQUARE, FIG. 105.]  LATTICE-GROUND AND DAMASK STITCHES FOR SQUARE, FIG. 105 (fig. 104).—Damask, or gobelin stitches, are given in figs. 152, 153, 154. The ground of this part of the square (fig. 104) is adorned with narrow bars, worked in darning stitch. From the centre of one bar, proceed three bars made on three foundation-threads, and a fourth made on two, on account of the passage to the next bar.  [Illustration: FIG. 104. LATTICE-GROUND AND DAMASK STITCH FOR SQUARE, FIG. 105.]  QUARTER OF THE SQUARE IN SINGLE AND CUT OPEN-WORK, AND DAMASK-STITCH (fig. 105).—Original size 48 c/m. square. This handsome square is worked in unbleached cotton on a white ground; it may also be worked in colours. A very good effect is produced by using Chiné d’or D.M.C[A] red, blue, or green for the gobelin stitch, and a uniform pale tint for the cut open-work.  Figs. 101, 102, 103, 104 illustrate in detail, one quarter of the square, which is represented here one third of the original size. The centre piece (fig. 104) is bordered by four stripes, two long and two short; the former containing two lozenge-shaped open-work figures separated and finished off by damask stitches; the latter, only one such figure. For the insertion in single open-work, that recurs three times, you will find a variety of designs in figs. 81, 82, 83, 84, 87, 88.  [Illustration: FIG. 105. QUARTER OF THE SQUARE IN SINGLE AND CUT OPEN-WORK, AND DAMASK STITCH.  Original size 48 c/m. square.  MATERIALS suitable for Holbein linen: Fil à pointer D.M.C No. 15 or 20, and Coton à repriser D.M.C No. 25.[A]  For antique linen: Fil à dentelle D.M.C No. 25 or 30, or Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C No. 50, 60, or 70, and Coton à repriser D.M.C No. 50 or, in place of the latter, Coton à broder surfin D.M.C No. 190.[A]]  DRAWING IN THE PATTERN (fig. 106).—Darning in the threads, as you do into a net foundation is a slower process and one that requires greater skill than drawing them in. The illustration shows the proper order and direction of stitches for Fig. 108. In this case likewise, the little bars must be finished, before the actual pattern is filled in.  [Illustration: FIG. 106. DRAWING IN THE PATTERN. (Explanation of fig. 108)]  DARNING IN THE THREADS (fig. 107)—In old needle-work we often find the pattern reserved, that is, left blank and outlined by the grounding. As it is difficult, especially in executing minute, and delicate figures, to withdraw the threads partially, without injuring the linen foundation, they are withdrawn throughout, and new ones drawn in, to form the pattern. To explain this more clearly, the original threads of the material are represented in a lighter shade than the new ones that are drawn in; the course of the stitches is indicated in a darker shade.  [Illustration: FIG. 107. DARNING IN THE THREADS. (Explanation of fig. 109).]  BROAD INSERTION IN CUT OPEN-WORK, WITH THE PATTERN DRAWN IN (fig. 108).—This insertion, suitable according to the foundation it is worked on, for the decoration either of curtains, table-covers, bed-linen or underclothing, is made as shown in fig. 106. If intended for the decoration of any article made of white linen, we recommend unbleached materials for the lattice-work, and bleached for the pattern, to bring it out in strong relief.  [Illustration: FIG. 108. BROAD INSERTION IN CUT OPEN-WORK, WITH PATTERN DRAWN IN.]  INSERTION IN CUT OPEN-WORK, WITH PATTERN DARNED IN (fig. 109).—This insertion can be introduced into any kind of linen material, and used for ornamenting towels, aprons, bed-linen and table-linen. When it is used to connect bands of cross-stitch embroidery, the open-work should be of the same colour as the embroidery, and the pattern worked in white or unbleached cotton, to correspond with the foundation. In fig. 109, the pattern is half as large again as in the original.  [Illustration: FIG. 109. INSERTION IN CUT OPEN-WORK, WITH PATTERN DARNED IN.  MATERIALS—For Holbein linen: Fil à pointer D.M.C No. 15 or 20, Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C No. 8, 10 or 15 for the bars.—Coton à tricoter D.M.C No. 16 or Coton à repriser D.M.C No. 12 or 25 for darning or drawing in the pattern.  For finer linens: Fil à dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 30, or Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 25 to 40 for the bars and Coton à repriser D.M.C No. 50 for darning or drawing in the pattern.]  CUT OPEN-WORK PATTERN (figs. 110 and 111).—This pattern, more of the nature of lace than any of the former, is well adapted for trimming, not only household articles but also church furniture, altar-cloths and the like, which are required to wash, as it can be worked in any width.  Fig. 110, a magnified representation of the work in process of execution, shows alternately, ten threads withdrawn each way and six left, with open spaces between. The arcs are worked over three carefully laid threads, carried across from the middle of one bar to the middle of the bar at right angles to it, the wheels on the other hand are begun and finished at the same corner. Overcast the cut edges, and hem-stitch the outside layer of stuff (figs. 61 and 62).  [Illustration: FIG. 110. CUT OPEN-WORK PATTERN. Fig. 111 in process of execution.]  [Illustration: FIG. 111. CUT OPEN-WORK PATTERN. MATERIALS: Fil à pointer D.M.C No. 20 or 30, Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 15 to 50 or Fil à dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50.]  GREEK CUT OPEN-WORK PATTERN (fig. 112).—After the foregoing explanations, no difficulty will be found in copying the beautiful Greek cut open-work pattern, illustrated in fig. 112. Here, we have in the original, 48 threads drawn out in the middle, both ways, from one straight bar to another, (these bars being darned) with open spaces between; and in the lower and narrower division, 21 threads drawn out each way. The cut edges, from bar to bar, are hem-stitched on both sides, leaving four threads of the stuff between.  The long bars, in the second figure, are button holed on both sides, those with the picots, on one side only.  [Illustration: FIG. 112. GREEK CUT OPEN-WORK PATTERN. MATERIALS: Cordonnet 6 fils D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50, Fil d’Alsace D.M.C Nos. 20 to 100 or Fil à dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50.]  FOOTNOTES:  [A] See, at the end of the concluding chapter, the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the D.M.C threads and cottons.     [Illustration: NET STRIPE, IN IMITATION OF BRUSSELS LACE.]     Net and damask stitches.   Many net embroidery patterns and damask stitches consist of a combination of ordinary running and darning, others of chain, stem and cross stitch.  NET EMBROIDERY.—All these kinds of stitches can be worked on the coarse Greek net, as it is called, as well as on the finest quality of real Brussels net.  Stripes of net, finished off with button-hole edging, and ornamented with one or other of the following patterns, make very pretty washing laces and the like; net laid upon Irish point and converted by needlework into a lace ground, makes an excellent substitute for a hand-made ground, which demands much labour and time.  MATERIALS SUITABLE FOR NET EMBROIDERY.—The choice of material must be determined by the quality of the net and the effect to be produced. For a coarse make of net and a very marked pattern, the lowest numbers of D.M.C cottons, or the narrowest braids, such as Soutache D.M.C Nos. 1, 2, 3 should be used; if the net be fine and the pattern a delicate one, then the higher numbers of the following are preferable: Coton à tricoter D.M.C Nos. 8 to 20, Coton à repriser D.M.C Nos. 25 to 70, Coton à broder D.M.C Nos. 16 to 50, Fil à dentelle D.M.C Nos. 25 to 50, Coton à broder surfin D.M.C Nos. 100, 120, 150. The latter must be adjusted to the required size before being used, that is to say as many strands of it removed, as is necessary in order to reduce it to the proper thickness.  TRACING WITH RUNNING STITCHES (fig. 113).—Have your pattern traced on linen or paper; tack the net upon it, and copy it carefully on the net with running stitches. As in darning, the stitches must run first above and then beneath, alternating in each succeeding row. At the turn of the lines, the stitches cross each other, as shown in the illustration.  [Illustration: FIG. 113. TRACING WITH RUNNING STITCHES.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 114).—Here too the pattern is traced with running stitches, which are run in on both sides of each row of meshes. The thread is carried first to the right, and then to the left, under every alternate bar of the net and out again. Between the first and second rows, one thread of the foundation must be left uncovered. In the next row, the thread is carried back again, so that it encircles each mesh. In the third row, the thread passes under the same bar of net as in the second, the threads touching each other. The fourth row is a repetition of the first.  [Illustration: FIG. 114. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 115).—This consists of two rows of stitches. In the first, the single stitches run diagonally from left to right, over and under a mesh; in the second row the triple stitches, also carried diagonally across a mesh, lie from right to left.  [Illustration: FIG. 115. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 116).—Begin with a double row, as in fig. 114; this is followed by a row of cross-stitch, touching the others, for which the thread has to be carried, first under one of the straight bars of the mesh and then diagonally, across it. A second, similar row of stitches backwards, completes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20776"],["title","Encyclopedia of Needlework (#7)"],["body"," crosses. This can be further varied by the introduction of a row of triple stitches, after the double row, as in fig. 115, and the repetition of the two first only.  [Illustration: FIG. 116. NET PATTERN.]  These rows can also be worked in two colours, or in white thread and washing gold.  NET PATTERN (fig. 117).—Begin at the top, carrying the thread, first under and then over two bars and a mesh, and then underneath as before. In the second as in the first row, the threads must be drawn in, so that 4 threads always meet in one mesh, and two run parallel to each other through the same mesh.  [Illustration: FIG. 117. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 118).—This pattern, which resembles fig. 117 in the execution, is thickened by triple stitches. Above, where in the preceding row three threads were laid, the thread should be single.  [Illustration: FIG. 118. NET PATTERN.]  Very pretty varieties are to be obtained by the introduction of several colours. Take white, for instance, for the first row, and different shades of the same colour for the second, third, fourth and fifth rows; such as, Bleu-Lapis 345, 344, 343, 333, 342, [A] or Rouge-Cardinal 348, 305, 304, 347, 346, [A] or Rouge-Géranium, Brun-Caroubier or any other colour that is absolutely fast.  NET PATTERN (fig. 119).—After one row of cross-stitch, such as was described in fig. 116, add a second, carrying the thread under the bar that lies between the first stitches, so that the two rows only cover three threads of the net. The close bands of cross-stitch must be divided from each other by one row of net bars.  [Illustration: FIG. 119. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 120).—Draw the thread twice backwards and forwards, as in darning, through one row of meshes. In the next, make four stitches over one mesh and two bars. After the fourth stitch, the thread is carried forward under two bars to the next group. The meshes filled in thus are divided from each other by two double rows of darning stitches. Here you may introduce a variety in the colour, using either white and unbleached, or unbleached and pale blue, or some other combination of the kind.  [Illustration: FIG. 120. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 121).—Make three diagonal stitches over three bars and two meshes, then returning to the mesh out of which the first stitches come, make three more in the opposite direction. In the second row, the stitches meet in the same mesh as those of the first.  [Illustration: FIG. 121. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 122).—Carry the thread upwards from below, over a bar of the net, then pass it horizontally under another bar and carrying it downwards, pass it under a diagonal bar and cover the other three. In the second row, your loops must be turned the opposite way. When the whole foundation is finished, run a thread over the whole surface and overcast it. A good effect is produced by using white and unbleached cottons, in alternate rows.  [Illustration: FIG. 122. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 123).—This pattern consists of one row of overcasting, one of stitches like those described in fig. 114, and one of cross-stitch, as in fig. 39, running diagonally across the stuff. Besides the cottons already mentioned, washing gold thread (Or fin D.M.C pour la broderie), may be used for the overcasting. Dead gold introduced into simple needlework of this kind enlivens it extremely.  [Illustration: FIG. 123. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 124).—Three kinds of stitches are required for this pattern. In the first row the stitch lies crossed underneath the net; in the second, 3 stitches are made over one mesh, the first and the last of which are carried across three meshes. In the third row, button-hole stitches are carried from right to left over two diagonal bars, in such a manner that the thread is drawn through the mesh facing the loops, and the next stitch comes out under the loop of the preceding one.  [Illustration: FIG. 124. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 125).—Fill in every other diagonal row of meshes with chain stitch, inserting the needle into the same mesh it came out of, so that the thread lies in front of the needle, in a loop. The rows of chain stitch may be made with two or three rows of meshes between them. Even the diagonal lines by themselves, make a very pretty foundation for other stitches.  [Illustration: FIG. 125. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 126).—The first row worked from left to right, consists of three loop stitches upwards and three downwards, each over one bar. In the second row, divided from the first by one row of stitches, the inner loops must be turned towards each other; in the third, the outer ones. Any of the stitches, already described, can be introduced into this pattern to enliven it.  [Illustration: FIG. 126. NET PATTERN.]  NET INSERTIONS (figs. 127 and 128).—These two, as well as the subsequent patterns, are most of them worked in darning stitch and simple overcasting.  The scallops in fig. 127 are formed of darning stitches, over 4, 3, 2 and 1 mesh, respectively. In the intervening space, which is five meshes wide, the stitch shown in fig. 118, may be introduced.  [Illustration: FIG. 127. NET INSERTION.]  In repeating the pattern, the stitches forming the scallops, must be made to run in the opposite direction. Instead of the thread, simply drawn through the middle, little stars like those described in fig. 134, have a very pretty effect.  In fig. 128, the thread is first carried round one mesh and then on to the next scallop. In the second scallop, which turns the opposite way, the thread is carried once more round the last mesh after the pyramid is completed, and then on, to the next figure.  [Illustration: FIG. 128. NET INSERTION.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 129).—This checked pattern is also worked in darning stitch. Carry the thread, as in fig. 125, through every second row of meshes. When the bottom rows are all finished, the upper ones are worked across them in the same way. Here the stitches may, if preferred, be distributed more sparingly. But if they are set wider apart, the spaces between should be filled up in some way. Little dots, made of Coton à repriser D.M.C, will answer the purpose best.  [Illustration: FIG. 129. NET PATTERN.]  NET INSERTIONS (figs. 130, 131, 132).—These three patterns are specially suitable, for insertions, neck-tie lappets and the like, in the place of crochet, pillow, and other kinds of lace. Both design and stitch are clearly enough represented in the subjoined figure for further explanation to be unnecessary. All three should be worked with rather coarse cotton, and Soutache D.M.C[A] (braid) drawn in, produces an excellent effect.  [Illustration: FIG. 130. NET INSERTION.]  [Illustration: FIG. 131. NET INSERTION.]  [Illustration: FIG. 132. NET INSERTION.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 133).—These delicate little figures can be worked into a close pattern, or can be strewn singly over the surface. The closer you set the stitches, the more clear and distinct the stars will be. The thread must be drawn in to the centre mesh from without, so as to be invisible if possible, and then back again to the outside when the stitches are finished.  [Illustration: FIG. 133. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 134).—These flowerets have a very pretty effect, set either singly, or in double or triple rows, and are very useful for filling up gaps or supplementing rows.  [Illustration: FIG. 134. NET PATTERN.]  NET PATTERN (fig. 135).—These star-shaped figures, their longest stitch covering three straight bars and two meshes, the shortest, three diagonal bars and two meshes, may like the above flowerets, be ranged closely together in rows, so that four stitches, two horizontal and two vertical ones, meet in one mesh. Cotton of two colours should be used, in order that the figures may be distinct from each other: white and unbleached are the best, in cases where bright colours would be unsuitable.  [Illustration: FIG. 135. NET PATTERN.]  NET INSERTION (fig. 136).—These diamonds make a very pretty grounding either set separately, or in a continuous pattern. The design is slight, nevertheless, when it is worked in coarse cotton, the effect is exceedingly handsome, especially if the inside, in addition to the star here given, be enriched with ordinary darning-stitches, worked in fine gold thread, as we have already mentioned.  [Illustration: FIG. 136. NET INSERTION.]  NET TRACERY WITH BORDER (fig. 137).—In order to bring out the pattern and the colours, use instead of cotton, Soutache D.M.C, or Lacets surfins D.M.C. Both are to be had in all the colours, given in the list of colours of the D.M.C threads and cottons. The little border can be used in conjunction with any of the preceding patterns, but care must be taken not to let it get twisted in the working. To prevent this, slip a coarse needle under the last stitch, and draw the braid flat over it.  [Illustration: FIG. 137. NET TRACERY WITH BRAIDS. MATERIALS: Soutache D.M.C No. 2 in Bleu-Indigo 334 and Rouge-Turc 321.]  BROAD NET LACE TRACERY (fig. 138).—The pattern of this pretty lace must first be transferred to stout paper, or oil-cloth. All the leaves and stalks, and the button-holing round the open centres of the flowers, are worked in a pale green, the two bottom flowers in Turkey red, the star-shaped one in blue, the calyx in which the stalks unite, in dark red, and the little bells, in the lightest green.  [Illustration: FIG. 138. BROAD NET LACE TRACERY. MATERIALS: Coton à broder D.M.C No. 30, 35 or 40.—COLOURS: Rouge-Turc 321, Rouge-Cardinal 346, Bleu-Indigo 322, Gris-Tilleul 393 and Vert-Pistache 369.]  NET DARNING.—We conclude with some directions for darning net, a valuable art, by means of which many a curious piece of old needlework is preserved. Coarse and fine net are all darned in the same way.  Laying the first thread (fig. 139).—Tack the net which is to be darned, closely to the defective part, upon either oil-cloth or coloured paper and cut the edges"]]]
