The letter read:       Dear Citizen, We take this opportunity of welcoming you into      the neighborhood and extending to you the services of what we      believe to be the finest Dream on Omega.       All manner and type of dreams are available to you--and at a      surprisingly low cost. We specialize in memory-resurrecting      dreams of Earth. You can be assured that your neighborhood      Dream Shop offers you only the finest in vicarious living.       As a Free Citizen, you will surely wish to avail yourself of      these services. May we hope that you do so within the week?       The Proprietors.  Barrent put down the letter. He had no idea what a Dream Shop was, or how the dreams were produced. He would have to find out. Even though the invitation was graciously worded, it had a peremptory tone to it. Past a doubt, a visit to a Dream Shop was one of the obligations of a Free Citizen.  But of course, an obligation could be a pleasure, too. The Dream Shop sounded interesting. And a genuine memory-resurrection dream of Earth would be worth almost any price the proprietors wished to ask.  But that would have to wait. Tonight was Black Mass, and his attendance there was definitely required.  Barrent left his store at eleven o'clock in the evening. He wanted time for a stroll around Tetrahyde before going to the service, which began at midnight.  He started his walk with a definite sense of well-being. And yet, because of the irrational and unexpecting nature of Omega, he almost died before reaching the Wee Coven on Kirkwood Drive.     Chapter Seven   It had turned into a hot, almost suffocatingly humid night when Barrent began his walk. Not the faintest breath of air stirred along the darkened streets. Although he was wearing only a black mesh shirt, shorts, gunbelt, and sandals, Barrent felt as if he were wrapped in a thick blanket. Most of the people of Tetrahyde, except for those already at the Covens, had retired to the coolness of their cellars. The dark streets were nearly deserted.  Barrent walked on, more slowly. The few people he met were running to their homes. There was a sense of panic in that silent, dogged sprint through heat which made walking difficult. Barrent tried to find out what the matter was, but no one would stop. One old man shouted over his shoulder, \"Get off the street, idiot!\"  \"Why?\" Barrent asked him.  The old man snarled something unintelligible and hurried on.  Barrent kept on walking, nervously fingering the butt of his needlebeam. Something was certainly wrong, but he had no idea what it was. His nearest shelter now was the Wee Coven, about half a mile away. It seemed best to keep on moving in that direction, staying alert, waiting to see what was wrong.  In a few minutes, Barrent was alone in a tightly shuttered city. He moved into the center of the street, loosened the needlebeam in its holster, and prepared for attack from any side. Perhaps this was some special holiday like Landing Day. Perhaps Free Citizens were fair game tonight. Anything seemed possible on a planet like Omega.  He thought he was ready for any possibility. But when the attack came, it was from an unexpected quarter.  A faint breeze stirred the stagnant air. It faded and returned, stronger this time, perceptibly cooling the hot streets. Wind rolled off the mountains of the interior and swept through the streets of Tetrahyde, and Barrent could feel the perspiration on his chest and back begin to dry.  For a few minutes, the climate of Tetrahyde was as pleasant as anything he could imagine.  Then the temperature continued to fall.  It dropped rapidly. Frigid air swept in from the distant mountain slopes, and the temperature fell through the seventies into the sixties.  This is ridiculous, Barrent thought to himself. I'd better get to the Coven.  He walked more rapidly, while the temperature plummeted. It passed through the forties into the low thirties. The first glittering signs of frost appeared on the streets.  It can't go much lower, Barrent thought.  But it could. An angry winter wind blew through the streets, and the temperature dropped into the twenties. Moisture in the air began forming into sleet.  Chilled to the bone, Barrent ran down the empty streets, and the wind, rising to gale force, pulled and tugged at him. The streets glittered with ice, making the footing dangerous. He skidded and fell, and had to run at a slower pace to keep his footing. And still the temperature dropped, and the wind growled and snapped like an angry beast.  He saw light through a heavily shuttered window. He stopped and pounded at the shutters, but no sound came from inside. He realized that the people of Tetrahyde never helped anyone; the more who died, the more chance there was for the survivors. So Barrent continued running, on feet that felt like chunks of wood.  The wind shrieked in his ear, and hailstones the size of his fist pelted the ground. He was getting too tired to run. All he could do now was walk, through a frozen white world, and hope he would reach the Wee Coven.  He walked for hours or for years. At one corner he passed the bodies of two men huddled against a wall and covered with frost. They had stopped running and had frozen to death.  Barrent forced himself to run again. A stitch in his side felt like a knife wound, and the cold was creeping up his arms and down his legs. Soon the cold would reach his chest, and that would be the end.  A flurry of hailstones stunned him. Without conscious transition he found that he was lying on the icy ground, and a monstrous wind was whirling away the tiny warmth his body was able to generate.  At the far end of the block he could see the tiny red light of the Coven. He crept toward it on hands and knees, moving mechanically, not really expecting to get there. He crawled forever, and the beckoning red light always remained the same distance from him.  But he kept on crawling, and at last he reached the door of the Coven. He pulled himself to his feet and turned the doorknob.  The door was locked.  He pounded feebly on the door. After a moment, a panel slid back. He saw a man staring at him; then the panel slid shut. He waited for the door to open. It didn't open. Minutes passed, and still it didn't open. What were they waiting for inside? What was wrong? Barrent tried to pound on the door again, lost his balance and fell to the ground. He rolled over and looked despairingly at the locked door. Then he lost consciousness.         *       *       *       *       *  When he came to, Barrent found himself lying on a couch. Two men were massaging his arms and legs, and beneath him he could feel the warmth of heating pads. Peering anxiously at him was the broad, swarthy face of Uncle Ingemar.  \"Feeling better now?\" Uncle Ingemar asked.  \"I think so,\" Barrent said. \"Why did you take so long opening the door?\"  \"We almost didn't open it at all,\" the priest told him. \"It's against the law to aid strangers in distress. Since you hadn't as yet joined the Coven, you were technically still a stranger.\"  \"Then why did you let me in?\"  \"My assistant noticed that we had an even number of worshipers. We require an odd number, preferably ending in three. Where the sacred and the profane laws are in conflict, the profane must yield. So we let you in despite the government ruling.\"  \"It's a ridiculous ruling,\" Barrent said.  \"Not really. Like most of the laws of Omega, it is designed to keep the population down. Omega is an extremely barren planet, you know. The constant arrival of new prisoners keeps swelling the population, to the enormous disadvantage of the older inhabitants. Ways and means must be sought to dispose of the excess newcomers.\"  \"It isn't fair,\" Barrent said.  \"You'll change your mind when you become an older inhabitant,\" Ingemar said. \"And by your tenacity, I'm sure you'll become one.\"  \"Maybe,\" Barrent said. \"But what happened? The temperature must have dropped nearly a hundred degrees in fifteen minutes.\"  \"A hundred and eight degrees to be exact,\" Uncle Ingemar said. \"It's really very simple. Omega is a planet which revolves eccentrically around a double star system. Further instability, I'm told, comes from the planet's peculiar physical make-up--the placement of mountains and seas. The result is a uniformly and dramatically bad climate characterized by sudden violent temperature changes.\"  The assistant, a small, self-important fellow, said, \"It has been calculated that Omega is at the outer limits of the planets which can support human life without gross artificial aids. If the fluctuations between hot and cold were any more violent, all human life here would be wiped out.\"  \"It's the perfect punitive world,\" Uncle Ingemar said proudly. \"Experienced residents sense when a temperature change is about to take place and get indoors.\"  \"It's--hellish,\" Barrent said, at a loss for words.  \"That describes it perfectly,\" the priest said. \"It _is_ hellish, and therefore perfect for the worship of The Black One. If you're feeling better now, Citizen Barrent, shall we proceed with services?\"  Except for a touch of frostbite on his toes and fingers, Barrent was all right. He nodded, and followed the priest and the worshipers into the main part of the Coven.         *       *       *       *       *  After what he had been through, the Black Mass was necessarily an anticlimax. In his warmly heated pew, Barrent drowsed through Uncle Ingemar's sermon on the necessary performance of everyday evil.  The worship of Evil, Uncle Ingemar said, should not be reserved solely for Monday nights. On the contrary! The knowledge and performance of evil should suffuse one's daily life. It was not given to everyone to be a great sinner; but no one should be discouraged by that. Little acts of badness performed over a lifetime accumulated into a sinful whole most pleasing to The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20919"],["title","The Status Civilization (#7)"],["body","One. No one should forget that some of the greatest sinners, even the demoniac saints themselves, often had humble beginnings. Did not Thrastus start as a humble shopkeeper, cheating his customers of a portion of rice? Who would have expected that simple man to develop into the Red Slayer of Thorndyke Lane? And who could have imagined that Dr. Louen, son of a dockhand, would one day become the world's foremost authority on the practical applications of torture? Perseverance and piety had allowed those men to rise above their natural handicaps to a pre-eminent position at the right hand of The Black One. And it proved, Uncle Ingemar said, that Evil was the business of the poor as well as the rich.  That ended the sermon. Barrent awoke momentarily when the sacred symbols were brought out and displayed to the reverent congregation--a red-handled dagger, and a plaster toad. Then he dozed again through the slow inscribing of the magical pentagon.  At last the ceremony neared its end. The names of the interceding evil demons were read--Bael, Forcas, Buer, Marchocias, Astaroth, and Behemoth. A prayer was read to ward off the effects of Good. And Uncle Ingemar apologized for not having a virgin to sacrifice on the Red Altar.  \"Our funds were not sufficient,\" he said, \"for the purchase of a government-certified peon virgin. However, I am sure we will be able to perform the full ceremony next Monday. My assistant will now pass among you....\"  The assistant carried around the black-rimmed collection plate. Like the other worshipers, Barrent contributed generously. It seemed wise to do so. Uncle Ingemar was clearly annoyed at not having a virgin to sacrifice. If he became a little angrier, he might take it into his head to sacrifice one of the congregation, virgin or not.  Barrent didn't stay for the choir singing or the community dancing. When the evening worship was finished, he poked his head cautiously out the door. The temperature had gone up to the seventies, and the frost was already melted from the ground. Barrent shook hands with the priest and hurried home.     Chapter Eight   Barrent had had enough of Omega's shocks and surprises. He stayed close to his store, worked at his business, and kept alert for trouble. He was beginning to develop the Omegan look: a narrow, suspicious squint, a hand always near gun butt, feet ready to sprint. Like the older inhabitants, he was acquiring a sixth sense for danger.  At night, after the doors and windows were barred and the triplex alarm system had been set, Barrent would lie on his bed and try to remember Earth. Probing into the misty recesses of his memory, he found tantalizing hints and traces, and fragments of pictures. Here was a great highway curving toward the sun; a fragment of a huge, multi-level city; a closeup view of a starship's curving hull. But the pictures were not continuous. They existed for the barest fraction of a second, then vanished.  On Saturday, Barrent spent the evening with Joe, Danis Foeren, and his neighbor Tem Rend. Joe's pokra had prospered, and he had been able to bribe his way to the status of Free Citizen. Foeren was too blunt and straightforward for that; he had remained at the Residency level. But Tem Rend promised to take the big forger as an assistant if the Assassin's Guild accepted his application.  The evening started pleasantly enough; but it ended, as usual, with an argument about Earth.  \"Now look,\" Joe said, \"we all know what Earth is like. It's a complex of gigantic floating cities. They're built on artificial islands in the various oceans--\"  \"No, the cities are on land,\" Barrent said.  \"On water,\" Joe said. \"The people of Earth have returned to the sea. Everyone has special oxygen adaptors for breathing salt water. The land areas aren't even used any more. The sea provides everything that--\"  \"It isn't like that,\" Barrent said. \"I remember huge cities, but they were all on land.\"  Foeren said, \"You're both wrong. What would Earth want with cities? She gave them up centuries ago. Earth is a landscaped park now. Everyone has his own home and several acres of land. All the forests and jungles have been allowed to grow back. People live _with_ nature instead of trying to conquer it. Isn't that right, Tem?\"  \"Almost but not quite,\" Tem Rend said. \"There are still cities, but they're underground. Tremendous underground factories and production areas. The rest is like Foeren said.\"  \"There aren't any more factories,\" Foeren insisted stubbornly. \"There's no need of them. Any goods which a man requires can be produced by thought-control.\"  \"I'm telling you,\" Joe said, \"I can remember the floating cities! I used to live in the Nimui sector on the island of Pasiphae.\"  \"You think that proves anything?\" Rend asked. \"I remember that I worked on the eighteenth underground level of Nueva Chicaga. My work quota was twenty days a year. The rest of the time I spent outdoors in the forests--\"  Foeren said, \"That's wrong, Tem. There aren't any underground levels. I can remember distinctly that my father was a Controller, Third Class. Our family used to trek several hundred miles every year. When we needed something, my father would _think_ it, and there it'd be. He promised to teach me how, but I guess he never did.\"  Barrent said, \"Well, a couple of us are certainly having false recall.\"  \"That's certain,\" Joe said. \"But the question is, which of us is right?\"  \"We'll never find out,\" Rend said, \"unless we can return to Earth.\"  That ended the discussion.  Toward the end of the week, Barrent received another invitation from the Dream Shop, more strongly worded than the first. He decided to discharge the obligation that evening. He checked the temperature, and found that it had risen into the high nineties. Wiser now in Omegan ways, he packed a small satchel full of cold-weather clothing, and started out.  The Dream Shop was located in the exclusive Death's Row section. Barrent went in, and found himself in a small, sumptuously furnished waiting room. A sleek young man behind a polished desk gave him an artificial smile.  \"Could I be of service?\" the young man asked. \"My name is Nomis J. Arkdragen, assistant manager in charge of nightside dreams.\"  \"I'd like to know something about what happens,\" Barrent said. \"How one gets dreams, what kind of dreams, all that sort of thing.\"  \"Of course,\" Arkdragen said. \"Our service is easily explained, Citizen--\"  \"Barrent. Will Barrent.\"  Arkdragen nodded and checked a name from a list in front of him. He looked up and said, \"Our dreams are produced by the action of drugs upon the brain and the central nervous system. There are many drugs which produce the desired effect. Among the most useful are heroin, morphine, opium, coca, hemp, and peyote. All those are Earth products. Found only on Omega are Black Slipper, nace, manicee, tri-narcotine, djedalas, and the various products of the carmoid group. Any and all of these are dream-inducers.\"  \"I see,\" Barrent said. \"Then you sell drugs.\"  \"Not at all!\" Arkdragen said. \"Nothing so simple, nothing so crude. In ancient times on Earth, men administered drugs to themselves. The dreams which resulted were necessarily random in nature. You never knew what you would dream about, or for how long. You never knew if you would have a dream or a nightmare, a horror or a delight. This uncertainty has been removed from the modern Dream Shop. Nowadays, our drugs are carefully measured, mixed, and metered for each individual. There is an absolute precision in dream-making, ranging from the Nirvana-like calm of Black Slipper through the multicolored hallucinations of peyotl and tri-narcotine, to the sexual fantasies induced by nace and morphine, and at last to the memory-resurrecting dreams of the carmoid group.\"  \"It's the memory-resurrecting dreams I'm interested in,\" Barrent said.  Arkdragen frowned. \"I wouldn't recommend it for a first visit.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Dreams of Earth are apt to be more unsettling than any imaginary productions. It's usually advisable to build up a tolerance for them. I would advise a nice little sexual fantasy for your first visit. We have a special sale on sexual fantasies this week.\"  Barrent shook his head. \"I think I'd prefer the real thing.\"  \"You wouldn't,\" the assistant manager said, with a knowing smile. \"Believe me, once one becomes accustomed to vicarious sex experiences, the real thing is pallid by comparison.\"  \"Not interested,\" Barrent said. \"What I want is a dream about Earth.\"  \"But you haven't built up a tolerance!\" Arkdragen said. \"You aren't even addicted.\"  \"Is addiction necessary?\"  \"It's important,\" Arkdragen told him, \"as well as being inescapable. All our drugs are habit-forming, as the law requires. You see, to really appreciate a drug, you must build up a need for it. It heightens pleasure enormously, to say nothing of the increase in toleration. That's why I suggest that you begin with--\"  \"I want a dream about Earth,\" Barrent said.  \"Very well,\" Arkdragen said grudgingly. \"But we will not be responsible for any traumas which accrue.\"  He led Barrent into a long passageway. It was lined with doors, and behind some of them Barrent could hear dull moans and gasps of pleasure.  \"Experiencers,\" Arkdragen said, without further explanation. He took Barrent to an open room near the end of the corridor. Within sat a cheerful-looking bearded man in a white coat reading a book.  \"Good evening, Doctor Wayn,\" Arkdragen said. \"This is Citizen Barrent. First visit. He insists upon an Earth dream.\" Arkdragen turned and left.  \"Well,\" the doctor said, \"I guess we can manage that.\" He put down his book. \"Just lie down over there, Citizen Barrent.\"  In the center of the room was a long, adjustable table. Above it hung a complicated-looking instrument. At the end of the room were glass-sided cabinets filled with square jars; they reminded Barrent of his antidotes.  He lay down. Doctor Wayn put him through a general examination, then a"]]]
