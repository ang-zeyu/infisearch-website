It seems to be clear that the same lady wrote \"The Lion's Masquerade\" as \"The Peacock at Home,\" for in \"The Lioness's Ball\" (a companion to \"The Lion's Masquerade\") the dedication begins thus--    \"I do not, fair Dorset, I do not aspire,      With notes so unhallowed as mine,    To touch the sweet strings of thy beautiful lyre,      Or covet the praise that is thine.\"   I regret that I am unable to offer any conjecture here as to the \"W. B.\" who wrote \"The Elephant's Ball:\" the same initials appear to an appendix to an edition of \"Goody Two Shoes,\" published some time before 1780, but this may be a coincidence only.         *       *       *       *       *  Besides the interest and merit of these little books on literary grounds, these earlier editions are especially noteworthy because they were illustrated by the painter William Mulready, and the drawings he made for them are amongst the earliest efforts of his genius: they were executed before he had reached man's estate. It is not a little curious to observe in this connection how many artists who have risen to eminence have at the outset of their career been employed in illustrating books for children; it would indeed appear that until comparatively recent years the veriest tiro was considered capable of furnishing the necessary embellishments for books for the nursery--a state of things which, we need not say, happily does not obtain in the present day. Notwithstanding this, however, these and many other little books of a bygone time abound in instructive indications of the beginnings of genius which has subsequently delighted the world with its masterpieces.  In connection with Mulready and children's books it may be interesting to note that in 1806 a little book called \"The Looking Glass\" was published, said to be written by William Godwin under the name of \"Theophilus Markliffe.\" This work is the history and early adventures of a young artist, and it is known that it was compiled from a conversation with Mulready, who was then engaged in illustrating some juvenile books for the author, and the facts in it relate to the painter's early life. It contains illustrations of the talent of the subject done at three, five, and six years old, which are presumed to be imitations of Mulready's own drawings at the same ages.         *       *       *       *       *  I cannot more fitly close these few words of Introduction than by quoting the quaint and curious announcement with which Mr Harris was wont to commend these little books to the public. \"It is unnecessary,\" says he, \"for the publisher to say anything more of these little productions than that they have been purchased with avidity and read with satisfaction by persons in all ranks of life.\" No doubt the public of to-day will be curious to see what manner of book it was that was so eagerly sought after by the children of the early days of the present century, and interested in comparing it with the more finished but often showy and sensational productions of our own time.

The Trumpeter, _Gad-fly_, has summon'd the Crew,   And the Revels are now only waiting for you.    So said little Robert, and pacing along,   His merry Companions came forth in a Throng.   And on the smooth Grass, by the side of a Wood,   Beneath a broad Oak that for Ages had stood,  [Illustration: _\"Saw the children of earth & the tenants of air,\"_]    Saw the Children of Earth, and the Tenants of Air,   For an Evening's Amusement together repair.   And there came the _Beetle_, so blind and so black,   Who carried the _Emmet_, his Friend, on his Back.    And there was the _Gnat_ and the _Dragon-fly_ too,   With all their Relations, Green, Orange, and Blue.   And there came the _Moth_, with his Plumage of Down,   And the _Hornet_ in Jacket of Yellow and Brown;    Who with him the _Wasp_, his Companion, did bring,   But they promis'd, that Evening, to lay by their Sting.   And the sly little _Dormouse_ crept out of his Hole,   And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the _Mole_.  [Illustration: _\"And the sly little dormouse crept out of his hole.\"_]    And the _Snail_, with his Horns peeping out of his Shell,   Came from a great Distance, the Length of an Ell.   A Mushroom their Table, and on it was laid   A Water-dock Leaf, which a Table-cloth made.  [Illustration: _\"And the Bee brought her honey,\" &c._]    The Viands were various, to each of their Taste,   And the _Bee_ brought her Honey to crown the Repast.   Then close on his Haunches, so solemn and wise,   The _Frog_ from a Corner, look'd up to the Skies.    And the _Squirrel_ well pleas'd such Diversions to see,   Mounted high over Head, and look'd down from a Tree.   Then out came the _Spider_, with Finger so fine,   To shew his Dexterity on the tight Line.    From one Branch to another, his Cobwebs he slung,   Then quick as an Arrow he darted along,   But just in the Middle,--Oh! shocking to tell,   From his Rope, in an Instant, poor Harlequin fell.  [Illustration: _\"Hung suspended in air,\" &c._]    Yet he touch'd not the Ground, but with Talons outspread,   Hung suspended in Air, at the End of a Thread.   Then the _Grasshopper_ came with a Jerk and a Spring,   Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing;    He took but three Leaps, and was soon out of Sight,   Then chirp'd his own Praises the rest of the Night.   With Step so majestic the _Snail_ did advance,   And promis'd the Gazers a Minuet to dance.  [Illustration: _\"With step so Majestic the snail did advance,\"_]    But they all laugh'd so loud that he pull'd in his Head,   And went in his own little Chamber to Bed.   Then, as Evening gave Way to the Shadows of Night,   Their Watchman, the _Glow-worm_, came out with a Light.  [Illustration: _\"So said little Robert, & pacing along,\" &c._]    Then Home let us hasten, while yet we can see,   For no Watchman is waiting for you and for me,   So said little Robert, and pacing along,   His merry Companions returned in a Throng.

For as soon as he had removed the beaker the heavy bath had jumped endwise from under his hand as though it were alive. It had flown with terrific speed over the table, smashing apparatus and bottles of chemicals on its way, and was even now disappearing through the open window. He seized his prism binoculars and focused them upon the flying vessel, a speck in the distance. Through the glass he saw that it did not fall to the ground, but continued on in a straight line, only its rapidly diminishing size showing the enormous velocity with which it was moving. It grew smaller and smaller, and in a few moments disappeared utterly.  The chemist turned as though in a trance. How was this? The copper bath he had used for months was gone--gone like a shot, with nothing to make it go. Nothing, that is, except an electric cell and a few drops of the unknown solution. He looked at the empty space where it had stood, at the broken glass covering his laboratory table, and again stared out of the window.  He was aroused from his stunned inaction by the entrance of his colored laboratory helper, and silently motioned him to clean up the wreckage.  \"What's happened, Doctah?\" asked the dusky assistant.  \"Search me, Dan. I wish I knew, myself,\" responded Seaton, absently, lost in wonder at the incredible phenomenon of which he had just been a witness.  Ferdinand Scott, a chemist employed in the next room, entered breezily.  \"Hello, Dicky, thought I heard a racket in here,\" the newcomer remarked. Then he saw the helper busily mopping up the reeking mass of chemicals.  \"Great balls of fire!\" he exclaimed. \"What've you been celebrating? Had an explosion? How, what, and why?\"  \"I can tell you the 'what,' and part of the 'how',\" Seaton replied thoughtfully, \"but as to the 'why,' I am completely in the dark. Here's all I know about it,\" and in a few words he related the foregoing incident. Scott's face showed in turn interest, amazement, and pitying alarm. He took Seaton by the arm.  \"Dick, old top, I never knew you to drink or dope, but this stuff sure came out of either a bottle or a needle. Did you see a pink serpent carrying it away? Take my advice, old son, if you want to stay in Uncle Sam's service, and lay off the stuff, whatever it is. It's bad enough to come down here so far gone that you wreck most of your apparatus and lose the rest of it, but to pull a yarn like that is going too far. The Chief will have to ask for your resignation, sure. Why don't you take a couple of days of your leave and straighten up?\"  Seaton paid no attention to him, and Scott returned to his own laboratory, shaking his head sadly.  Seaton, with his mind in a whirl, walked slowly to his desk, picked up his blackened and battered briar pipe, and sat down to study out what he had done, or what could possibly have happened, to result in such an unbelievable infraction of all the laws of mechanics and gravitation. He knew that he was sober and sane, that the thing had actually happened. But why? And how? All his scientific training told him that it was impossible. It was unthinkable that an inert mass of metal should fly off into space without any applied force. Since it had actually happened, there must have been applied an enormous and hitherto unknown force. What was that force? The reason for this unbelievable manifestation of energy was certainly somewhere in the solution, the electrolytic cell, or the steam-bath. Concentrating all the power of his highly-trained analytical mind upon the problem--deaf and blind to everything else, as was his wont when deeply interested--he sat motionless, with his forgotten pipe clenched between his teeth. Hour after hour he sat there, while most of his fellow-chemists finished the day's work and left the building and the room slowly darkened with the coming of night.  Finally he jumped up. Crashing his hand down upon the desk, he exclaimed:  \"I have liberated the intra-atomic energy of copper! Copper, 'X,' and electric current!  \"I'm sure a fool for luck!\" he continued as a new thought struck him. \"Suppose it had been liberated all at once? Probably blown the whole world off its hinges. But it wasn't: it was given off slowly and in a straight line. Wonder why? Talk about power! Infinite! Believe me, I'll show this whole Bureau of Chemistry something to make their eyes stick out, tomorrow. If they won't let me go ahead and develop it, I'll resign, hunt up some more 'X', and do it myself. That bath is on its way to the moon right now, and there's no reason why I can't follow it. Martin's such a fanatic on exploration, he'll fall all over himself to build us any kind of a craft we'll need ... we'll explore the whole solar system! Great Cat, what a chance! A fool for luck is right!\"  He came to himself with a start. He switched on the lights and saw that it was ten o'clock. Simultaneously he recalled that he was to have had dinner with his fiancée at her home, their first dinner since their engagement. Cursing himself for an idiot he hastily left the building, and soon his motorcycle was tearing up Connecticut Avenue toward his sweetheart's home.     CHAPTER II  Steel Becomes Interested   Dr. Marc DuQuesne was in his laboratory, engaged in a research upon certain of the rare metals, particularly in regard to their electrochemical properties. He was a striking figure. Well over six feet tall, unusually broad-shouldered even for his height, he was plainly a man of enormous physical strength. His thick, slightly wavy hair was black. His eyes, only a trifle lighter in shade, were surmounted by heavy black eyebrows which grew together above his aquiline nose.  Scott strolled into the room, finding DuQuesne leaning over a delicate electrical instrument, his forbidding but handsome face strangely illuminated by the ghastly glare of his mercury-vapor arcs.  \"Hello, Blackie,\" Scott began. \"I thought it was Seaton in here at first. A fellow has to see your faces to tell you two apart. Speaking of Seaton, d'you think that he's quite right?\"  \"I should say, off-hand, that he was a little out of control last night and this morning,\" replied DuQuesne, manipulating connections with his long, muscular fingers. \"I don't think that he's insane, and I don't believe that he dopes--probably overwork and nervous strain. He'll be all right in a day or two.\"  \"I think he's a plain nut, myself. That sure was a wild yarn he sprung on us, wasn't it? His imagination was hitting on all twelve, that's sure. He seems to believe it himself, though, in spite of making a flat failure of his demonstration to us this morning. He saved that waste solution he was working on--what was left of that carboy of platinum residues after he had recovered all the values, you know--and got them to put it up at auction this noon. He resigned from the Bureau, and he and M. Reynolds Crane, that millionaire friend of his,"]]]
