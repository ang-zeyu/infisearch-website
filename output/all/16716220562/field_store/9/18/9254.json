How are you going to do it, Lord Trask?\"  \"I haven't started thinking about how; all I know is that I have to do it. There are planets in the Old Federation where Space Vikings come and go; raid-and-trade bases, like the one Duke Angus planned to establish on Tanith. At one or another of them, I'll pick up word of Dunnan, sooner or later.\"  \"We'll hear where he was a year ago, and by the time we get there, he'll be gone for a year and a half to two years. We've been raiding the Old Federation for over three hundred years, Lord Trask. At present, I'd say there are at least two hundred Space Viking ships in operation. Why haven't we raided it bare long ago? Well, that's the answer: distance and voyage-time. You know, Dunnan could die of old age--which is not a usual cause of death among Space Vikings--before you caught up with him. And your youngest ship's-boy could die of old age before he found out about it.\"  \"Well, I can go on hunting for him till I die, then. There's nothing else that means anything to me.\"  \"I thought it was something like that. I won't be with you, all your life. I want a ship of my own, like the _Corisande_, that I lost on Durendal. Some day, I'll have one. But till you can command your own ship, I'll command her for you. That's a promise.\"  Some note of ceremony seemed indicated. Summoning a robot, he had it pour wine for them, and they pledged each other.  Rovard Grauffis had recovered his aplomb by the time he returned accompanied by the Duke. If Angus had ever lost his, he gave no indication of it. The effect on everybody else was literally seismic. The generally accepted view was that Lord Trask's reason had been unhinged by his tragic loss; there might, he conceded, be more than a crumb of truth in that. At first, his cousin Nikkolay raged at him for alienating the barony from the family, and then he learned that Duke Angus was appointing him vicar-baron and giving him Traskon New House for his residence. Immediately he began acting like one at the death-bed of a rich grandmother. The Wardshaven financial and industrial barons, whom he had known only distantly, on the other hand, came flocking around him, offering assistance and hailing him as the savior of the duchy. Duke Angus' credit, almost obliterated by the loss of the _Enterprise_, was firmly re-established, and theirs with it.  There were conferences at which lawyers and bankers argued interminably; he attended a few at first, found himself completely uninterested, and told everybody so. All he wanted was a ship; the best ship possible, as soon as possible. Alex Gorram had been the first to be notified; he had commenced work on the unfinished sister-ship of the _Enterprise_ immediately. Until he was strong enough to go to the shipyard himself, he watched the work on the two-thousand-foot globular skeleton by screen, and conferred either in person or by screen with engineers and shipyard executives. His rooms at the ducal palace were converted, almost overnight, from sickrooms to offices. The doctors, who had recently been urging him to find new interests and activities, were now warning of the dangers of overexertion. Harkaman finally added his voice to theirs.  \"You take it easy, Lucas.\" They had dropped formality and were on a first-name basis now. \"You got hulled pretty badly; you let damage-control work on you, and don't strain the machinery till it's fixed. We have plenty of time. We're not going to get anywhere chasing Dunnan. The only way we can catch him is by interception. The longer he moves around in the Old Federation before he hears we're after him, the more of a trail he'll leave. Once we can establish a predictable pattern, we'll have a chance. Then, some time, he'll come out of hyperspace somewhere and find us waiting for him.\"  \"Do you think he went to Tanith?\"  Harkaman heaved himself out of his chair and prowled about the room for a few minutes, then came back and sat down again.  \"No. That was Duke Angus' idea, not his. He couldn't put in a base on Tanith, anyhow. You know the kind of a crew he has.\"  There had been an extensive inquiry into Dunnan's associates and accomplices; Duke Angus was still hoping for positive proof to implicate Omfray of Glaspyth in the piracy. Dunnan had with him a dozen and a half employees of the Gorram shipyards whom he had corrupted. There was some technical ability among them, but for the most part they were agitators and trouble-makers and incompetent workmen. Even under the circumstances, Alex Gorram was glad to see the last of them. As for Dunnan's own mercenary company, there were about a score of former spacemen among them; the rest graded down from bandits through thugs and sneak-thieves to barroom bums. Dunnan himself was an astrogator, not an engineer.  \"That gang aren't even good enough for routine raiding,\" Harkaman said. \"They'd never under any circumstances be able to put in a base on Tanith. Unless Dunnan's completely crazy, which I doubt, he's gone to some regular Viking base planet, like Hoth or Nergal or Dagon or Xochitl, to recruit officers and engineers and able spacemen.\"  \"All that machinery and robotic equipment and so on that was going to Tanith--was that aboard when he took the ship?\"  \"Yes, and that's another reason why he'd go to some planet like Hoth or Nergal or Xochitl. On a Viking-occupied planet in the Old Federation, that stuff's almost worth its weight in gold.\"  \"What's Tanith like?\"  \"Almost completely Terra-type, third of a Class-G sun. Very much like Haulteclere or Flamberge. It was one of the last planets the Federation colonized before the Big War. Nobody knows what happened, exactly. There wasn't any interstellar war; at least, you don't find any big slag-puddles where cities used to be. They probably did a lot of fighting among themselves, after they got out of the Federation. There's still some traces of combat-damage around. Then they started to decivilize, down to the pre-mechanical level--wind and water power and animal power. They have draft-animals that look like introduced Terran carabaos, and a few small sailboats and big canoes and bateaux on the rivers. They have gunpowder, which seems to be the last thing any people lose.  \"I was there, five years ago. I liked Tanith for a base. There's one moon, almost solid nickel iron, and fissionable-ore deposits. Then, like a fool, I hired out to the Elmersans on Durendal and lost my ship. When I came here, your Duke was thinking about Xipototec. I convinced him that Tanith was a better planet for his purpose.\"  \"Dunnan might go there, at that. He might think he was scoring one on Duke Angus. After all, he has all that equipment.\"  \"And nobody to use it. If I were Dunnan, I'd go to Nergal, or Xochitl. There are always a couple of thousand Space Vikings on either, spending their loot and taking it easy between raids. He could sign on a full crew on either. I suggest we go to Xochitl, first. We might pick up news of him, if nothing else.\"         *       *       *       *       *  All right, they'd try Xochitl first. Harkaman knew the planet, and was friendly with the Haulteclere noble who ruled it.  The work went on at the Gorram shipyard; it had taken a year to build the _Enterprise_, but the steel-mills and engine-works were over the preparatory work of tooling up, and material and equipment was flowing in a steady stream. Lucas let them persuade him to take more rest, and day by day grew stronger. Soon he was spending most of his time at the shipyard, watching the engines go in--Abbot lift-and-drive for normal space, Dillingham hyperdrive, power-converters, pseudograv, all at the center of the globular ship.  Living quarters and workshops went in next, all armored in collapsium-plated steel. Then the ship lifted out to an orbit a thousand miles off-planet, followed by swarms of armored work-craft and cargo-lighters; the rest of the work was more easily done in space. At the same time, the four two-hundred-foot pinnaces that would be carried aboard were being finished. Each of them had its own hyperdrive engines, and could travel as far and as fast as the ship herself.  Otto Harkaman was beginning to be distressed because the ship still lacked a name. He didn't like having to speak of her as \"her,\" or \"the ship,\" and there were many things soon to go on that should be name-marked. _Elaine_, Trask thought, at once, and almost at once rejected it. He didn't want her name associated with the things that ship would do in the Old Federation. _Revenge_, _Avenger_, _Retribution_, _Vendetta_; none appealed to him. A news-commentator, turgidly eloquent about the nemesis which the criminal Dunnan had invoked against himself, supplied it, _Nemesis_ it was.  Now he was studying his new profession of interstellar robbery and murder against which he had once inveighed. Otto Harkaman's handful of followers became his teachers. Vann Larch, guns-and-missiles, who was also a painter; Guatt Kirbey, sour and pessimistic, the hyperspatial astrogator who tried to express his science in music; Sharll Renner, the normal-space astrogator. Alvyn Karffard, the exec, who had been with Harkaman longest of all. And Sir Paytrik Morland, a local recruit, formerly guard-captain to Count Lionel of Newhaven, who commanded the ground-fighters and the combat contragravity. They were using the farms and villages of Traskon for drill and practice, and he noticed that while the _Nemesis_ would carry only five hundred ground and air fighters, over a thousand were being trained.  He commented to Rovard Grauffis.  \"Yes. Don't mention it outside,\" the Duke's henchman said. \"You and Sir Paytrik and Captain Harkaman will pick the five hundred best. The Duke will take the rest into his service. Some of these days, Omfray of Glaspyth will find out what a Space Viking raid is really like.\"  And Duke Angus would tax his new subjects of Glaspyth to redeem the pledges on his new barony of Traskon. Some old Pre-Atomic writer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20728"],["title","Space Viking (#6)"],["body","was fond of quoting had said, \"Gold will not always get you good soldiers, but good soldiers can get you gold.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The _Nemesis_ came back to the Gorram yards and settled onto her curved landing legs like a monstrous spider. The _Enterprise_ had borne the Ward sword and atom-symbol; the _Nemesis_ should bear his own badge, but the bisonoid head, tawny on green, of Traskon, was no longer his. He chose a skull impaled on an upright sword, and it was blazoned on the ship when he and Harkaman took her out for her shakedown cruise.  When they landed again at the Gorram yards, two hundred hours later, they learned that a tramp freighter from Morglay had come into Bigglersport in their absence with news of Andray Dunnan. Her captain had come to Wardshaven at Duke Angus' urgent invitation and was waiting for them at the Ducal Palace.  They sat, a dozen of them, around a table in the Duke's private apartments. The freighter captain, a small, precise man with a graying beard, alternately puffed at a cigarette and sipped from a beaker of brandy.  \"I spaced out from Morglay two hundred hours ago,\" he was saying. \"I'd been there twelve local days, three hundred Galactic Standard hours, and the run from Curtana was three hundred and twenty. This ship, the _Enterprise_, spaced out from there several days before I did. I'd say she's twelve hundred hours out of Windsor, on Curtana, now.\"  The room was still. The breeze fluttered curtains at the open windows; from the garden below, winged night-things twittered.  [Illustration]  \"I never expected it,\" Harkaman said. \"I thought he'd take the ship out to the Old Federation at once.\" He poured wine for himself. \"Of course, Dunnan's crazy. A crazy man has an advantage, sometimes, like a left-handed knife-fighter. He does unexpected things.\"  \"That wasn't such a crazy move,\" Rovard Grauffis said. \"We have very little direct trade with Curtana. It's only an accident we heard about this when we did.\"  The freighter captain's beaker was half empty. He filled it to the brim from the decanter.  \"She was the first Gram ship there for years,\" he agreed. \"That attracted notice, of course. And his having the blazonry changed, from the sword and atom-symbol to the blue crescent. And the ill-feeling on the part of other captains and planet-side employers about the men he'd lured away from them.\"  \"How many men and what kind?\"  The man with the gray beard shrugged. \"I was too busy getting a cargo together for Morglay, to pay much attention. Almost a full spaceship complement, officers and spacemen of every kind. And a lot of industrial engineers and technicians.\"  \"Then he is going to use that equipment that was aboard, and put in a base somewhere,\" somebody said.  [Illustration]  \"If he left Curtana twelve hundred hours ago, he's still in hyperspace,\" Guatt Kirbey said. \"It's over two thousand from Curtana to the nearest Old Federation planet.\"  \"How far to Tanith?\" Duke Angus asked. \"I'm sure that's where he's gone. He'd expect me to finish the other ship and equip her like the _Enterprise_ and send her out; he'd want to get there first.\"  \"I'd thought that Tanith would be the last place he'd go,\" Harkaman said, \"but this changes the whole outlook. He could have gone to Tanith.\"  \"He's crazy, and you're trying to apply sane logic to him,\" Guatt Kirbey said. \"You're figuring what you'd do, and you aren't crazy. Of course, I've had my doubts, at times, but--\"  \"Yes, he's crazy, and Captain Harkaman's allowing for that,\" Rovard Grauffis said. \"Dunnan hates all of us. He hates his Grace, here. He hates Lord Lucas, and Sesar Karvall; of course, he may think he killed both of them. He hates Captain Harkaman. So how could he score all of us off at once? By taking Tanith.\"  \"You say he was buying supplies and ammunition?\"  \"That's right. Gun ammunition, ship's missiles, and a lot of ground-defense missiles.\"  \"What was he buying them with? Trading machinery?\"  \"No. Gold.\"  \"Yes. Lothar Ffayle found out that a lot of gold was transferred to Dunnan from banks in Glaspyth and Didreksburg,\" Grauffis said. \"He got that aboard when he took the ship, evidently.\"  \"All right,\" Trask said. \"We can't be sure of anything, but we have some reasons for thinking he went to Tanith, and that's more than we have for any other planet in the Old Federation. I won't try to estimate the odds against our finding him there, but they're a good deal bigger anywhere else. We'll go there, first.\"     VII   The outside viewscreen, which had been vacantly gray for over three thousand hours, was now a vertiginous swirl of color, the indescribable color of a collapsing hyperspatial field. No two observers ever saw it alike, and no imagination could vision the actuality. Trask found that he was holding his breath. So, he noticed, was Otto Harkaman, beside him. It was something, evidently, that nobody got used to. Even Guatt Kirbey, the astrogator, was sitting with his pipe clenched in his mouth, staring at the screen.  Then, in an instant, the stars, which had literally not been there before, filled the screen with a blaze of splendor against the black velvet backdrop of normal space. Dead in the center, brighter than all the rest, Ertado's Star, the sun of Tanith, burned yellowly. The light from it was ten hours old.  \"Pretty good, Guatt,\" Harkaman said, picking up his cup.  \"Good, Gehenna; it was perfect,\" somebody else said.  Kirbey was relighting his pipe. \"Oh, I suppose it'll have to do,\" he grudged, around the stem. He had gray hair and an untidy mustache, and nothing was ever quite good enough to satisfy him. \"I could have made it a little closer. Need three microjumps, now, and I'll have to cut the last one pretty fine. Now don't bother me.\" He began punching buttons for data and fiddling with setscrews and verniers.  For a moment, in the screen, Trask could see the face of Andray Dunnan. He blinked it away and reached for his cigarettes, and put one in his mouth wrong-end-to. When he reversed it and snapped his lighter, he saw that his hand was trembling. Otto Harkaman must have seen that, too.  \"Take it easy, Lucas,\" he whispered. \"Keep your optimism under control. We only think he might be here.\"  \"I'm sure he is. He has to be.\"  No; that was the way Dunnan, himself, thought. Let's be sane about this.  \"We have to assume he is. If we do, and he isn't it's a disappointment. If we don't, and he is, it's a disaster.\"  Others, it seemed, thought the same way. The battle-stations board was a solid blaze of red light for full combat readiness.  \"All right,\" Kirbey said. \"Jumping.\"  Then he twisted the red handle to the right and shoved it in viciously. Again the screen boiled with colored turbulence; again dark and mighty forces stalked through the ship like demons in a sorcerer's tower. The screen turned featureless gray as the pickups stared blindly into some dimensionless noplace. Then it convulsed with color again, and this time Ertado's Star, still in the center, was a coin-sized disk, with the little sparks of its seven planets scattered around it. Tanith was the third--the inhabitable planet of a G-class system usually was. It had a single moon, barely visible in the telescopic screen, five hundred miles in diameter and fifty thousand off-planet.  \"You know,\" Kirbey said, as though he was afraid to admit it, \"that wasn't too bad. I think we can make it in one more microjump.\"  Some time, Trask supposed, he'd be able to use the expression \"micro-\" about a distance of fifty-five million miles, too.  \"What do you think about it?\" Harkaman asked him, as deferentially as though seeking expert guidance instead of examining his apprentice. \"Where should Guatt put us?\"  \"As close as possible, of course.\" That would be a light-second at the least; if the _Nemesis_ came out of hyperspace any closer to anything the size of Tanith, the collapsing field itself would kick her back. \"We have to assume Dunnan's been there at least nine hundred hours. By that time, he could have put in a detection-station, and maybe missile-launchers, on the moon. The _Enterprise_ carries four pinnaces, the same as the _Nemesis_; in his place, I'd have at least two of them on off-planet patrol. So let's accept it that we'll be detected as soon as we come out of the last jump, and come out with the moon directly between us and the planet. If it's occupied, we can knock it off on the way in.\"  \"A lot of captains would try to come out with the moon masked off by the planet,\" Harkaman said.  \"Would you?\"  The big man shook his tousled head. \"No. If they have launchers on the moon, they could launch at us in a curve around the planet, by data relayed from the other side, and we'd be at a disadvantage replying. Just go straight in. You hearing this, Guatt?\"  \"Yeah. It makes sense. Sort of. Now, stop pestering me. Sharll, look here a minute.\"  The normal-space astrogator conferred with him; Alvyn Karffard, the executive officer, joined them. Finally Kirbey pulled out the big red handle, twisted it, and said, \"All right, jumping.\" He shoved it in. \"I suppose I cut it too fine; now we'll get kicked back half a million miles.\"  The screen convulsed again; when it cleared the third planet was directly in the center; its small moon, looking almost as large, was a little above and to the right, sunlit on one side and planetlit on the other. Kirbey locked the red handle, gathered up his tobacco and lighter and things from the ledge, and pulled down the cover of the instrument-console, locking it.  \"All yours, Sharll,\" he told Renner.  \"Eight hours to atmosphere,\" Renner said. \"That's if we don't have to waste a lot of time shooting up Junior, there.\"  Vann Larch was looking at the moon in the six hundred power screen.  \"I don't see anything to shoot. Five hundred miles; one planetbuster, or four or five thermonuclears,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  It wasn't right, Trask thought indignantly. Minutes"]]]
