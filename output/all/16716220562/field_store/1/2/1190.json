This is no formal History of the War in the strict or scientific sense of the phrase; no detailed record of naval and military operations. There have been many occasions on which silence or reticence seemed the only way to maintain the national composure. It is _Mr. Punch's_ History of the Great War, a mirror of varying moods, month by month, but reflecting in the main how England remained steadfastly true to her best traditions; how all sorts and conditions of men and women comported themselves throughout the greatest ordeal that had ever befallen their race.     Mr. PUNCH'S HISTORY of the GREAT WAR    _August, 1914._   Four weeks ago we stood on the verge of the great upheaval and knew it not. We were thinking of holidays; of cricket and golf and bathing, and then were suddenly plunged in the deep waters of the greatest of all Wars. It has been a month of rude awakening, of revelation, of discovery--of many moods varying from confidence to deep misgiving, yet dominated by a sense of relief that England has chosen the right course. Sir Edward Grey's statement that we meant to stand by France and fulfil our obligations to Belgium rallied all parties. \"Thrice armed is he that hath his quarrel just.\" The Fleet \"stands fast\" and the vigil of the North Sea has begun. Lord Kitchener has gone to the War Office, and in twelve days from the declaration of War our Expeditionary Force, the best trained and equipped army that England has ever put into the field, landed in France. The Dominions and India are staunch. Every able-bodied public school boy and under-graduate of military age has joined the colours. The Admiralty is crowded with living counterparts of Captain Kettle, offering their services in any capacity, linking up the Merchant Marine with the Royal Navy in one great solidarity of the sea.  The Empire is sound and united. So far the omens are good. But as the days pass the colossal task of the Allies becomes increasingly apparent. Peace-loving nations are confronted by a Power which has prepared for war for forty years, equipped in every detail as no Power has ever been equipped before, with a docile and well-disciplined people trained to arms, fortified by a well-founded belief in their invincibility, reinforced by armies of spies in every country, hostile or neutral. We are up against the mightiest War-machine of all time, wonderful in organisation, joining the savagery of the barbarian to the deadliest resources of modern science. The revelation of the black soul of Germany is the greatest and the most hideous surprise of this month of months, crowning long years of treachery and the abuse of hospitality with an orgy of butchery and devastation--the torture and massacre of old men, women and children, the shooting of hostages, the sack and burning of towns and the destruction of ancient seats of learning. Yet we feel that in trampling upon heroic Belgium, who dared to bar the gate, Germany has outraged the conscience of the world and sealed her ultimate doom.  The month closes in gloom, the fall of Li√©ge, Namur and Brussels, the sack of Louvain, and the repulse of the Russian raid into East Prussia at Tannenberg following in rapid succession. Against these disasters we have to set the brilliant engagement in the Heligoland Bight. But the onrush of the Germans on the Western front is not stayed, though their time-table has been thrown out by the self-sacrifice of the Belgians, the steadfast courage of French's \"contemptible little army\" in the retreat from Mons, and the bold decision of Smith-Dorrien, who saved the situation at Le Cateau. In these days of apprehension and misgiving, clouded by alarming rumours of a broken and annihilated army, it sometimes seems as though we should never smile again. Where, in a world of blood and tears, can _Punch_ exercise his function without outraging the fitness of things? These doubts have been with us from the beginning, but they are already being resolved by the discovery--another of the wonders of the time--that on the very fringes of tragedy there is room for cheerfulness. When our fighting men refuse to be downhearted in the direst peril, we at home should follow their high example, note where we can the humours of the fray, and \"bear in silence though our hearts may bleed.\"  [Illustration:  BRAVO, BELGIUM!]  [Illustration: MEDICAL OFFICER: \"Sorry I must reject you on account of your teeth.\"  WOULD-BE-RECRUIT: \"Man, ye're making a gran' mistake. I'm no wanting to bite the Germans, I'm wanting to shoot 'em.\"]  Germany in one brief month has given us a wonderful exhibition of conscienceless strength, of disciplined ferocity. She has shown an equally amazing failure to read the character of her foes aright. We now know what German Kultur means: but of the soul and spirit of England she knows nothing. Least of all does she understand that formidable and incorrigible levity which refuses to take hard knocks seriously. It will be our privilege to assist in educating our enemies on these and other points, even though, as Lord Kitchener thinks, it takes three years to do it. The Mad Dog of Europe is loose, but we remember the fate of the dog who \"to serve some private ends went mad and bit the man.\" \"The man recovered from his bite, the dog it was that died.\" Meanwhile the Official Press Bureau has begun its operations, the Prince of Wales's Relief Fund for the relief of those who may suffer distress through the war is started, and in the City    Because beneath grey Northern Skies     Some grey hulls heave and fall,   The merchants sell their merchandise     All just as usual.    _September, 1914._   Another month of revelations and reticences, of carnage and destruction, loss and gain, with the miracle of the Marne as the first great sign of the turning of the tide. On September 3 the Paris Government moved to Bordeaux, on the 5th the retreat from Mons ended, on the 13th Joffre, always unboastful and laconic, announced the rolling back of the invaders, on the 15th the battle of the Aisne had begun. What an Iliad of agony, endurance and heroism lies behind these dates--the ordeal and deliverance of Paris, the steadfastness of the \"Contemptibles,\" the martyrdom of Belgium!  Day by day Germany unmasks herself more clearly in her true colours from highest to lowest. The Kaiser reveals himself as a blasphemer and hypocrite, the Imperial crocodile with the bleeding heart, the Crown Prince as a common brigand, the High Command as chief instigators to ferocity, the rank and file as docile instruments of butchery and torture, content to use Belgium women as a screen when going into action.    THE TWO GERMANIES    Marvellous the utter transformation   Of the spirit of the German nation!    Once the land of poets, seers and sages,   Who enchant us in their deathless pages,    Holding high the torch of Truth, and earning   Endless honour by their zeal for learning.    Such the land that in an age uncouther   Bred the soul-emancipating LUTHER.    Such the land that made our debt the greater   By the gift of _Faust_ and _Struwwelpeter_.    Now the creed of Nietzsche, base, unholy,   Guides the nation's brain and guides it solely.    Now Mozart's serene and joyous magic   Yields to RICHARD STRAUSS, the haemorrhagic.[A]    Now the eagle changing to the vulture   Preaches rapine in the name of culture.    Now the Prussian _Junker_, blind with fury,   Claims to be God's counsel, judge and jury,    While the authentic German genius slumbers,   Cast into the limbo of back numbers.  [Footnote A: Great play is made in Strauss's _Elektra_ with the \"slippery blood\" motive.]  The campaign of lies goes on with immense energy in all neutral countries, for the Kaiser is evidently of opinion that the pen is perhaps mightier than the sword.  At home the great improvisation of the New Armies, undertaken by Lord Kitchener in the teeth of much expert criticism, goes steadily on. Lord Kitchener asked for 500,000 men, and he has got them. On September 10 the House voted another half million. The open spaces in Hyde Park are given over to training; women are beginning to take the place of men. Already the spirit of the new soldiers is growing akin to that of the regulars. One of Mr. Punch's brigade, who has begun to send his impressions of the mobilised Territorials, sums it up very well when he says that, amateurs or professionals, they are all very much alike. \"Feed them like princes and pamper them like babies, and they'll complain all the time. But stand them up to be shot at and they'll take it as a joke, and rather a good joke, too.\" Lord Roberts maintains a dignified reticence, but that is \"Bobs' way\":    He knew, none better, how 'twould be,     And spoke his warning far and wide:   He worked to save us ceaselessly,     Setting his well-earned ease aside.    We smiled and shrugged and went our way,     Blind to the swift approaching blow:   His every word proves true to-day,     But no man hears, \"I told you so!\"  Meanwhile General Botha, Boer and Briton too, is on the war-path, and we can, without an undue stretch of imagination, picture him composing a telegram to the Kaiser in these terms: \"Just off to repel another raid. Your customary wire of congratulations should be addressed, 'British Headquarters, German South-West Africa.'\"  [Illustration: GOD (AND THE WOMEN) OUR SHIELD  Study of a German Gentleman going into Action]  The rigours of the Censorship are pressing hard on war correspondents. Official news of importance trickles in in driblets: for the rest, newspaper men, miles from the front, are driven to eke out their dispatches with negligible trivialities. We know that Rheims Cathedral is suffering wanton bombardment. And a great many of us believe that at least a quarter of a million Russians have passed through England on their way to France. The number of people who have seen them is large: that of those who have seen people"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11571"],["title","Mr. Punch's History of the Great War (#2)"],["body","have seen them is enormous.  [Illustration: PORTER: \"Do I know if the Rooshuns has really come to England? Well, sir, if this don't prove it, I don't know what do. A train went through here full, and when it came back I knowed there'd been Rooshuns in it, 'cause the cushions and floors was covered with snow.\"]  We gather that the Press Bureau has no notion whether the rumour is true or not, and cannot think of any way of finding out. But it consents to its publication in the hope that it will frighten the Kaiser. Apropos of the Russians we learn that they have won a pronounced victory (though not by us) at Przemysl.  Motto for the month: _Grattez le Prusse et vous trouverez le barbare_.  [Illustration: UNCONQUERABLE  THE KAISER: \"So, you see--you've lost everything.\"  THE KING OF THE BELGIANS: \"Not my soul.\"]    _October, 1914._   Antwerp has fallen and the Belgian Government removed to Havre. But the spirit of the King and his army is unshaken.  Unshaken, too, is the courage of Burgomaster Max of Brussels, \"who faced the German bullies with the stiffest of stiff backs.\" The Kaiser has been foiled in his hope of witnessing the fall of Nancy, the drive for the Channel ports has begun at Ypres, and German submarines have retorted to Mr. Churchill's threat to \"dig out\" the German Fleet \"like rats\" by torpedoing three battleships. Trench warfare is in full and deadly swing, but \"Thomas of the light heart\" refuses to be downhearted:    He takes to fighting as a game,   He does no talking through his hat   Of holy missions: all the same   He has his faith--be sure of that:   He'll not disgrace his sporting breed   Nor play what isn't cricket. There's his creed.  Last month Lord Kitchener paid a high tribute to the growing efficiency of the \"Terriers\" and their readiness to go anywhere. _Punch's_ representative with the \"Watch Dogs\" fully bears out this praise. They have been inoculated and are ready to move on. Some suggest India, others Egypt. \"But what tempted the majority was the thought of a season's shooting without having to pay for so much as a gun licence, and so we decided for the Continent.\"  News from the front continues scanty, and Joffre's laconic _communiqu√©s_ might in sum be versified as follows:    On our left wing the state of things remains   Unaltered on a general review,   Our losses in the centre match our gains,   And on our right wing there is nothing new.  Nor do we gain much enlightenment from the \"Eyewitness\" with G.H.Q., though his literary skill in elegantly describing the things that do not matter moves our admiration.  [Illustration: THE BULL-DOG BREED  OFFICER: \"Now, my lad, do you know what you are placed here for?\"  RECRUIT: \"To prevent the henemy from landin', sir.\"  OFFICER: \"And do you think you could prevent him landing all by yourself?\"  RECRUIT: \"Don't know, sir, I'm sure. But I'd have a damn good try!\"]  The Kaiser's sons continue to distinguish themselves as first-class looters, and the ban laid on the English language, including very properly the word \"gentleman,\" has been lifted in favour of Wilhelm Shakespeare.  The prophets are no longer so optimistic in predicting when the War will end. One of Mr. Punch's young men suggests Christmas, 1918. But 500 German prisoners have arrived at Templemore, co. Tipperary. It's a long, long way, but they've got there at last.    _November, 1914_.   The miracle of the Marne has been followed by another miracle--that of Ypres. Outgunned and outnumbered, our thin line has stemmed the rush to the sea.  The road to Calais has been blocked like that to Paris. Heartening news comes from afar of the fall of Tsing-tau before our redoubtable Japanese allies, and with it the crumbling of Germany's scheme of an Oriental Empire; of the British occupation of Basra; and of the sinking of the _Emden_, thanks to the \"good hunting\" of the _Sydney_--the first fruits of Australian aid. A new enemy has appeared in Turkey, but her defection has its consolations. It is something to be rid of an \"unspeakable\" incubus full of promises of reform never fulfilled, \"sick\" but unrepentant, always turning European discord to bloody account at the expense of her subject nationalities: in all respects a fitting partner for her ally and master.  At sea our pain at the loss of the _Good Hope_ and _Monmouth_ off Coronel is less than our pride in the spirit of the heroic Cradock, true descendant of Grenville and Nelson, prompt to give battle against overwhelming odds. The soul of the \"Navy Eternal\" draws fresh strength from his example. So, too, does the Army from the death of Lord Roberts, the \"happy warrior,\" who passed away while visiting the Western front. The best homage we can pay him is not grief or      Vain regret for counsel given in vain,   But service of our lives to keep her free     The land he served: a pledge above his grave   To give her even such a gift as he,     The soul of loyalty, gave.  Even the Germans have paid reluctant tribute to one who, as Bonar Law said in the House, \"was in real life all, and more than all, that Colonel Newcome was in fiction.\" He was the exemplar _in excelsis_ of those \"bantams,\" \"little and good,\" who, after being rejected for their diminutive stature, are now joining up under the new regulations:    Apparently he's just as small,     But since his size no more impedes him   In spirit he is six foot tall--     Because his country needs him.  [Illustration: THE EXCURSIONIST  TRIPPER WILHELM: \"First Class to Paris.\"  CLERK: \"Line blocked.\"  WILHELM: \"Then make it Warsaw.\"  CLERK: \"Line blocked.\"  WILHELM: \"Well, what about Calais?\"  CLERK: \"Line blocked.\"  WILHELM: \"Hang it! I _must_ go _somewhere_! I promised my people I would.\"]  We have begun to think in millions. The war is costing a million a day. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has launched a war loan of 230 millions and doubled our income tax. The Prime Minister asks for an addition of a million men to the Regular Army. But the country has not yet fully awakened to the realities of war. Football clubs are concerned with the \"jostling of the ordinary patrons\" by men in uniform. \"Business as usual\" is interpreted as \"pleasure as usual\" in some quarters. Rumour is busy with stories of mysterious prisoners in the Tower, with tales of huge guns which are to shell us from Calais when the Germans get there; with reports (from neutral sources) of the speedy advent of scores of Zeppelins and hundreds of aeroplanes over London. But though    Old England's dark o' nights and short     Of 'buses: still she's much the sort   Of place we always used to know.  [Illustration: T.B.D.  OFFICER'S STEWARD: \"Will you take your bath, sir, before or after haction?\"]  It is otherwise with Belgium, with its shattered homes and wrecked towns. The great Russian legend is still going strong, in spite of the statements of the Under-Secretary for War, and, after all, why should the Germans do all the story telling? By the way, a \"German Truth Society\" has been founded. It is pleasant to know that it is realised over there at last that there is a difference between Truth and German Truth. The British Navy, we learn from the _K√∂lnische Zeitung_, \"is in hiding.\" But our fragrant contemporary need not worry. In due course the Germans shall have the hiding.  In some ways the unchanged spirit of our people is rather disconcerting. One of Mr. Punch's young men, happening to meet a music-hall acquaintance, asked him how he thought the war was going, and met with the answer: \"Oh, I think the managers will have to give in.\" And the proposal to change the name of Berlin Road at Lewisham has been rejected by the residents.    _December, 1914_.   In less than six weeks Coronel has been avenged at the battle of the Falkland Islands:    Hardened steel are our ships;     Gallant tars are our men;   We never are wordy     (STURDEE, boys, STURDEE!),   But quietly conquer again and again.  Here at least we can salute the vanquished. Admiral von Spee, who went down with his doomed squadron, was a gallant and chivalrous antagonist, like Captain M√ºller, of the _Emden_. Germany's retort, eight days later, by bombarding Scarborough and Whitby, reveals the normal Hun:   Come where you will--the seas are wide;     And choose your Day--they're all alike;   You'll find us ready when we ride     In calm or storm and wait to strike;   But--if of shame your shameless Huns     Can yet retrieve some casual traces--   Please fight our men and ships and guns,     Not womenfolk and watering places.  Austria's \"punitive expedition\" has ended in disaster for the Austrians. They entered Belgrade on the 2nd, and were driven out twelve days later by the Serbs. King George has paid his first visit to the front, and made General Foch a G.C.B. We know that the General is a great authority on strategy, and that his name, correctly pronounced, rhymes with Boche, as hero with Nero. He is evidently a man likely to be heard of again. Another hitherto unfamiliar name that has cropped up is that of Herr Lissauer, who, for writing a \"Hymn of Hate\" against England, has been decorated by the Kaiser. This shows true magnanimity on the part of the Kaiser, in his capacity of King of Prussia, since the \"Hymn of Hate\" turns out to be a close adaptation of a poem composed by a Saxon patriot, in which Prussia, not England, was held up to execration.  Kitchener's great improvisation is already bearing fruit, and the New Armies are flocking to the support of the old. Indian troops are fighting gallantly in three continents. King Albert \"the unconquerable,\" in the narrow strip of his country that still belongs to him, waits in unshaken faith for the coming of the dawn. And as Christmas draws on the thoughts of officers and men in the waterlogged trenches turn fondly homeward to mothers, wives and sweethearts:    Cheer up! I'm calling far away;     And wireless you can hear.   Cheer up! You know you'd have me stay   And keep on trying day by day;     We're"]]]
