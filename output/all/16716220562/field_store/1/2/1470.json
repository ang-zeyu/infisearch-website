You were breakfasting together--the table proves that.\"  \"Well, what of it? I explained his presence to the judge. Am I obliged to account for all my actions to every one I meet?\"  The officer, evidently acquainted with the lady's disposition, and aware that driving would never do, changed his tone, crossing the room toward her, and lowering his voice.  \"No, not to every one, Billie, but surely you cannot deny I have some right to this information. Would you wish me to be riding the country at night with a strange woman?\"  \"If it became part of your duty--yes. I have no remembrance of ever interfering with your freedom, Captain Le Gaire.\"  I could hear the man's teeth click, as though in an effort to restrain an oath.  \"By God, but you are irritating!\" he burst forth impetuously. \"One would think I were no more to you than a stranger. This is no light affair to be laughed away. Have you forgotten our engagement already?\"  \"That is scarcely probable. You remind me of it often enough. Don't crush my hand so.\"  Her provoking coldness was all that was needed to overcome the slight restraint the captain still exercised. Instantly his real nature came to the fore.  \"Then I'll make him do the explaining,\" he threatened fiercely. \"I know how to deal with men. Where is the fellow? In that room?\"  There was a brief silence. I could distinguish his rapid breathing, and the slight rustle of her skirts as she sank back into a chair.  \"Well, are you going to tell me? Or must I hunt for myself?\"  \"Captain Le Gaire,\" she began quietly, without even a tremor in the soft voice, \"possibly you forget whom I am. The gentlemen of my acquaintance have never been accustomed to question the motives actuating my conduct. You imagine yourself talking to some darky on your Louisiana plantation. Is this the manner in which you propose treating me after marriage?\"  He laughed uneasily.  \"Why, I meant nothing, Billie. Don't take it in that way. Surely you understand I have a right to be curious as to your companion.\"  \"Yes; but not to carry your curiosity to the point of discourtesy. I have not the slightest objection to answering your questions, if you only ask with some respect.\"  \"You always hold me at arm's length.\"  \"Do I? Well, this is hardly the best time to discuss that. What was it you wished to know?\"  \"Who is the fellow travelling with you?\"  \"Didn't the judge tell you?\"  \"He said he was a Confederate spy dressed in the uniform of a Yankee lieutenant whom you had brought through the lines.\"  \"Well, isn't that information sufficient?\"  The gallant captain again smothered an oath, evidently tried to the limit by the girl's cool indifference.  \"Of course it isn't. That might answer for Moran, for he has no personal interest in the affair. But it's altogether different with me. It's merely accident that I rode in here this morning, and I immediately discover the woman I am engaged to marry was out all night riding around with a stranger, eating breakfast with him when I arrive. Do you suppose that is pleasant?\"  \"No; yet my explanation ought to be sufficient.\"  \"Explanation! You have made none.\"  \"Oh, yes; Judge Moran told you the circumstances.\"  I heard him stomp roughly across the floor, his spurs clanking.  \"Explanation, nothing! Who is the fellow?\"  \"Really I don't know.\"  \"Don't know? Do you mean to say you rode with him alone all night, and took breakfast with him this morning, without even learning his name?\"  \"He said his name was Galesworth, but I don't know that he told the truth.\"  \"You pretend indifference well,\" the man sneered.  \"It is no pretence; I am indifferent. Why should I be otherwise? I am not interested in spies. I may assist one through the lines to serve the Confederacy, but that is no evidence that I feel any personal interest in the man. Anyhow that is the extent of my knowledge in this case, and I haven't the slightest desire to increase it. When are you going to ride on?\"  \"Not until I know more than I do now,\" he retorted savagely. \"There is something hidden here. You are pretending all this indifference so as to give that fellow sufficient time to get away. I'm damned if I put up with it.\"  \"Captain Le Gaire,\" and she was upon her feet, \"do you venture to address such language to me? Do you dare--\"  \"I am no dupe of yours or of any other woman,\" he broke in, too angry now to restrain his words. \"There is something wrong here, and I mean to know what it is. If you won't tell, I'll find out myself.\" He strode across to the window and called to some one below. \"Slade, come in here.\"  There was a moment of waiting, during which neither stirred, nor spoke. Then the trooper entered, his heels clicking together as he saluted just within the doorway.  \"Sergeant,\" said Le Gaire shortly. \"I have reason to suspect there is a man hidden in that room yonder. I'll keep an eye on this young lady, while you find out.\"  Slade took a step forward, and the girl's dress rustled.  \"Wait just a minute, Sergeant,\" she said briefly. \"Am I to understand from this, Captain Le Gaire, that you are not only a bully, but also a coward?\"  \"A coward!--\"  \"Yes, a coward. You order the sergeant to open that door--why do you not open it yourself?\"  He laughed rather unpleasantly.  \"So that's the trouble? Well, it's merely a way we have in the army, but if it will greatly oblige you I'll do the job.\"  It was useless waiting longer; the room offered me no possible hiding-place, the two windows looked down on the waiting cavalrymen. Beyond doubt boldness was the best card to play. Before the rather reluctant captain could take a second step I flung open the concealing door, and came forth into the breakfast room.    CHAPTER VII  A WOMAN'S PRISONER  The scene before me, the expression on the three faces, caused me to smile. I came forth with no definite plan of action, trusting, as one must at such times, wholly to luck. There was no means of escape apparent, yet my mind was cool, and I was prepared to take advantage of any opportunity. I saw the flash of the sergeant's revolver, the captain's sudden recoil, his hand tugging at his sword-hilt, and glimpsed something in the depths of Billie's eyes that puzzled me.  \"Good-morning, gentlemen,\" I said easily.  So far as Slade was concerned it was evident that all he saw was the uniform, his revolver instantly covering me, held in a hand steady as rock; he even grinned amiably across the barrel. But the expression on Le Gaire's face changed from startled surprise to relief. He was a tall man, with dark hair and eyes, a black moustache shading his lip, and his hand fell from the hilt of the sword as he took an uncertain step toward me.  \"Drop that gun-play, Sergeant,\" he exclaimed sharply. \"This man _is_ all right; I know him.\"  Too astounded myself for speech, I could only stare back into the captain's face, seeking vainly to recall ever having seen the fellow before. Not the slightest recollection came to me, but Le Gaire blundered on, blinded by his discovery.  \"Didn't know you had gone into this sort of thing,\" he exclaimed cordially, holding out his hand. \"Last I heard your regiment was in New Orleans. Don't remember me, do you?\"  I shook my head, so completely puzzled by this unexpected turn of affairs that speech became dangerous. Perhaps he would give me some clue to my new identity, which would enable me to carry out the masquerade.  \"Your face is familiar,\" I ventured, \"but--\"  \"Oh, no excuses,\" he broke in cordially. \"I was a guest at your mess one night when we were garrisoning Memphis. I am Le Gaire, of the Third Louisiana. I sang you fellows some French songs, you may remember.\"  \"Oh, yes!\" and my face visibly brightened, as I grasped his fingers, wondering who the devil I might be, yet exceedingly overjoyed at this sudden change of fortune. \"We had a gay night of it. I wonder you recognize me in these rags.\"  \"Well, I don't suppose I should,\" he exclaimed, \"only you happened to be pointed out to me specially that evening. It was just after your duel with Major Gillette of ours. Between us, I don't mind admitting I was glad you punctured that fellow--it saved me the trouble.\"  \"Perhaps if you gentlemen are through with reminiscences,\" broke in the girl quietly, \"Captain Le Gaire might present me to his new friend.\"  \"But I thought you knew him already!\"  She laughed lightly, her eyes aglow with merriment.  \"Oh, no, indeed! It is all a most wonderful mix-up.\"  \"Then it will be a pleasure for me to bring order out of confusion--Miss Hardy, Major Atherton of General Pemberton's staff.\"  \"Atherton!\" she gasped. \"I--I thought your name was Galesworth.\"  \"Hardy!\" I retorted, simulating equal surprise, \"and I supposed your name to be Gray.\"  Le Gaire looked at us, vastly amused, all his former jealousy and suspicion instantly dissipated by this evidence of misunderstanding.  \"You certainly must have had a merry night of it, you two--trying to outlie each other, and with honors about even. However, the tangle is straightened out now, and we must be on our way. What are you trying to do, Atherton,--get to the rear of the Yanks?\"  \"Yes,\" I answered, with some hesitation, and glancing aside at the girl. I could not determine how much of all this she actually believed, or how far I might venture to carry forward the deceit. Her eyes were upon me, but their shaded depths revealed nothing. I determined to take the chance. \"Johnston requires more exact information as to the Yankee artillery, and thought I might get in around the right flank. I saw a dust cloud across the river as we came into town.\"  \"A foraging party; they went west; we have the bridge guarded.\"  \"Beauregard's advance may hurry Johnston,\" I continued, eager to draw out of him some information of value. \"How came he to move without orders?\"  \"He concluded so wide a gap was dangerous, and that Johnston's despatch-carriers must have been unable to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12015"],["title","Love under Fire (#7)"],["body","through, so he began feeling his way east. The orders Billie brought will undoubtedly hurry the advance.\"  \"They have gone forward then?\"  \"Certainly--I sent a man with them at once.\"  I shot an inquiring glance toward her, but she had found a seat at the table, and was toying idly with a spoon, her eyes cast down.  \"And Beauregard is marching along this road, I presume?\"  \"No; back behind the hills where he runs no risk of being seen by any prowling Yankee scouts. We are in advance on the left flank.\"  I understood the movement clearly enough now, and realized the importance of getting this news to our headquarters. A swift advance of troops would throw a column between these two forces of Confederates, and hold them apart for separate battle. But there was no time for delay. Le Gaire failed to comprehend my anxious glance out the open window.  \"We all better be at it,\" he said quickly. \"By the way, with that cavalry uniform you ought to have a horse. We're leading one with Yankee accoutrements you can use. Come on, Slade. Miss Hardy, I hope to see you at your own home in a few days.\"  He bowed, hat in hand, the girl rising to her feet, as the sergeant left the room. She did not smile, her eyes flashing from his face to mine.  \"I may remain here until the armies leave this section,\" she replied quietly. \"There is too much risk in travelling alone.\"  \"You might ride with us,\" he suggested gallantly. She shook her head, her lips smiling.  \"I think I better not.\"  \"Does that mean you are still angry?\"  \"I didn't know I had been, Captain. Perhaps I spoke rather hastily, but you must forgive that.\"  Her hand was extended, and he came a step back from the door to grasp it, and lift the fingers to his lips. With a fierce throbbing of the heart I turned my back to them, staring out the window. There was a low murmur of voices, and then the door clicked. I never moved, watching Le Gaire go down the steps, his men swing into their saddles, at a sharp order, and ride away in column of fours. When they had all disappeared a single horse remained, tied to the railing of the veranda. I turned about, and picked up my hat from the floor. Miss Hardy was seated again at the table, her head resting upon one hand. I could see the round, white arm where the sleeve fell away, and her cheeks were flushed. She did not lift her eyes at my movement, and, half angry at her studied indifference, I advanced straight toward the door. But there I hesitated, unable to part without at least another word. She was looking at me now.  \"May I hope ever to meet you again?\" I asked.  \"I can promise nothing as to the future,\" she returned soberly. \"But I wish to speak to you now, before you go. Sit down here, just a moment.\"  I hesitated, keen as to the value of time, yet curious as to what she would say, and swayed strongly by her influence.  \"You surely must understand how anxious I am to get away--\" I began, but she broke in impulsively.  \"Of course I do, but you must listen to me first.\" She had risen, and was leaning forward, speaking earnestly. \"It is true we shall probably never meet again, yet I am not willing you should think me altogether a despicable character. I wish you to know whom I am, and why deceit was necessary.\"  \"My dear girl,\" I exclaimed, hastily crossing the room, \"there is nothing to explain. I understand the circumstances.\"  \"No, not entirely,\" she insisted, \"but it is my desire you should. I--I hardly know why, but--but I would rather have you think well of me. Listen, please; I will be very brief. I am Willifred Gray Hardy, and it was my father whom you overheard talking with General Johnston. Our home is south on the pike road, and was used as headquarters until a few days ago. I have known General Johnston ever since I was a little girl, and everybody--all my friends--call me Billie. Of course you thought the courier was a man--it was only natural you should--and it was, therefore, easy for me to keep up the deceit--they trusted me, and I had to get those papers through.\"  \"Of course you did,\" heartily. \"Surely you do not suppose I would think less of you for your loyalty?\"  \"I hoped not; nor did I mean to let you go away thinking me a fool.\"  \"A fool!\" thrown entirely from my guard. \"How could I think that?\"  \"By imagining that I believe you Major Atherton of Pemberton's staff,\" with a little, nervous laugh, and quick uplifting of the eyes. \"I was glad Captain Le Gaire made the mistake, for I had no wish to see you a prisoner, but your quick pretending did not in the least deceive me, Lieutenant Galesworth.\" She paused, evidently amused at the surprise expressed in my face, yet with the lines of her lips setting firmly. \"Your questions regarding the movements of Beauregard were most ingenuous, but I was able to comprehend your purpose.\"  \"You mean--\"  \"That you propose bearing the news direct to Federal headquarters. That is why you are in such a desperate hurry to get away.\"  I took a step backward, reading the meaning of her eyes.  \"And you intend to prevent--\"  \"Exactly,\" her voice as quiet as ever. \"I am a Confederate still.\"  She had changed her position, standing now between me and the closed door, the expression upon her face sufficient evidence of her determination. Hers was no idle threat--this daughter of a soldier was ready for the struggle and the sacrifice. I recognized all this at a glance, bewildered by the swift change in attitude, unable to decide my own course of action. Argument was useless, a resort to force repugnant. Above all else the one overpowering feeling was admiration for the girl. She must have read all this in my eyes, yet her own never wavered, nor changed expression.  \"Please do not make the mistake, Lieutenant Galesworth, of thinking me not sufficiently in earnest,\" she said firmly, \"or that I am unprepared.\"  \"I do not; if you were only a man I should know exactly what to do.\"  \"Your courtesy is misplaced; at least I do not ask it. This is war, and you are upon one side, I on the other. You will remain in this room until I say you may go.\"  \"What will hold me?--your eyes?--the mere threat of your lips?\"  \"Something rather more to the purpose than either,\" she answered coldly. Her right hand, concealed by the folds of her skirt, was uplifted, the fingers grasping the black butt of a Colt. Her lips smiled. \"I suppose you know the efficacy of this weapon, Lieutenant, and that it is loaded.\"  My hand dropped instinctively to my belt--the revolver holster was empty! It was my own weapon the girl held.    CHAPTER VIII  THE COMING OF THE ENEMY  No matter how charming she may be, a man can never enjoy being outplayed at his own game by a woman. The piquant face fronting me swam in a mist as a sudden rush of anger swept from me all admiration. I had been played with, outwitted from the start, every movement checkmated--even now she was actually laughing at my helplessness. My first wild impulse was to spring forward, and wrest the revolver from her hand; yet there was that in her attitude, in the expression of her eyes, which made me hesitate. Would she shoot? Would the sense of duty to her cause actually induce her to fire at me? A moment before, I should not have deemed it possible, but now, it seemed to me, she was desperate enough to do even this. And that was a hair-trigger she fingered so recklessly! Instead of leaping forward, I stood motionless, outwardly cool, yet with every nerve throbbing. She read all this in my face, no doubt, for her lips half smiled, her manner exhibited confidence.  \"Oh, I can shoot,\" she said pleasantly enough, \"so I wouldn't try that if I were you. Now will you do exactly as I say?\"  I remained silent, my hands clinched. So this was the gentle creature I had been riding with, had even been falling in love with! This woman, now threatening me with death, was the same happy-hearted, laughing girl whose hand I had held, and to whom I had talked in words of friendship. I could scarcely realize the change, or comprehend this new development of character.  The unpleasant situation was broken by the sound of steps in the hall. The door opened, and Judge Moran entered. Miss Hardy stepped instantly aside, concealing the revolver within the folds of her skirt, yet with watchful eyes on my face. Moran glanced at us both without suspicion, and approached me with outstretched hand.  \"Captain Le Gaire explained to me who you are, Major,\" he said with new cordiality, \"and I am very glad to receive you as my guest. Are you one of the Mobile Athertons?\"  \"No,\" I answered, flushing, and avoiding her amused eyes, yet not daring to blurt out the truth, \"I come from farther north.\"  \"Exactly; I recall now there are Athertons in Memphis and Nashville, delightful people, the real, old Southern stock. I regret greatly to learn from Le Gaire that duty compels you to leave at once.\"  \"Major Atherton has changed his plans,\" broke in the girl, before I could respond. \"The advance of Beauregard's forces makes it safer for him to remain quiet for a few hours,--until night comes. I was just suggesting that he go up to the red room and lie down--he is nearly dead from fatigue.\"  \"The red room!\" in surprise. \"Surely you jest, Miss Willifred! That is hardly considered a guest chamber.\"  \"No; but the safest place in the house, if, by any chance, it is searched by a scouting party.\"  The old gentleman nodded, as if in approval.  \"Possibly it would be safer, although I hardly anticipate any such calls from the enemy with our own people so near. You will not be the first Confederate to lie hidden there, sir,\" with a bow to me, and a quick glance toward the smiling girl. \"Would you mind showing him the way, my dear?--it is becoming difficult for me to mount the stairs.\"  \"With pleasure; indeed, I was about to propose doing so. Major, you will go first, please.\"  However cheerily these words were spoken I understood their quiet threat, and the full meaning of that motionless hand held"]]]
