At King's-Norton, this canal is conveyed under ground, by means of a tunnel, two miles in length, which is in width 16 feet and in height 18 feet, yet it is so admirably constructed, that any person by looking in at one end, may perceive day-light at the other extremity. The pound of water extends on a level for the space of fourteen miles, when it descends into the river Severn by means of fifty-eight locks.  _The Warwick Canal_  Was opened for the passage of boats, by forming a junction with the Birmingham canal, in the year 1800.  A communication being opened between the Birmingham and Worcester canals, in the year 1815, there are now two different routes by which goods may be conveyed from this town to London, by water; one of them is, by an immediate junction of the Birmingham canal with the Warwick, which is accomplished by means of nineteen locks; the other is, by passing into the Worcester canal, on the same level; from thence into the Stratford canal, which is also on the same level, and from thence into the Warwick canal.  Boats from the wharfs within the town; Bird's, White-house's, Robinson's, and Crowley's, are capable of delivering goods in London one whole day sooner by the latter route than they can do by the other, and the merchants and ironmongers in the metropolis are hereby informed of that circumstance. The boat-owners by proceeding on this route, are necessitated to advance a small sum of immediate money, for tonnage, more than they do on the other route; to counterbalance that, the boats are exempt from the wear and tear of passing through twelve locks, and an extra day's expense; therefore, when both circumstances are taken into consideration, the expenses cannot vary much either way, and to the London merchant one day is, at times, of the utmost importance.--On that account, there is no doubt that those who are apprised of this circumstance, will order their goods to be conveyed by way of the Stratford canal.  The trade of this town has within the last fifteen years increased in an astonishing manner; for in the year 1803, six weekly boats were sufficient to convey all the merchandize to and from this town to Manchester and Liverpool, but at the present time, there are at least twenty boats weekly employed in that trade.  At the same period, the competition was so great between the carriers to London, that they procured a number of boats, but it was with difficulty they could find lading for five or six in a week; whereas, at the present time, there are at least eighteen boats per week, constantly employed at the different wharfs in that traffic.  _The Theatre._  This superb pile of building was erected in 1774, and an additional portico in 1780, the whole together forming one of the most elegant theatres in Europe. There are in the front of it, over the attic windows, two busts, in bas relief, of exquisite workmanship; one representing Shakespear, and the other Garrick.  In the month of August, 1792, the interior of this building was in a malicious manner set on fire, which consumed all the scenery, dresses, &c. and although liberal rewards were offered for the discovery of the incendiaries, no proof could be established, though suspicions were very strong. Thus circumstanced, the proprietors purchased several adjoining houses, and in the space of four years re-erected the theatre, upon an enlarged scale, so that it will contain more than 2000 people. In the centre building, towards the front, is an elegant assembly room, which is fitted up in a sumptuous style, and the two wings are occupied as a tavern, which, from the great author of the drama, is called the Shakespear. In the year 1807, it was made a royal theatre, and on that account the proprietors are entitled to let it for such performances as other royal theatres are, without being under controul of the magistrates.  As a theatre, it opens in June and closes in September.  This substantial and well-constructed pile of building, being on a line with the street, it cannot be seen to any advantage, except you ascend the roof of St. Philip's church. This theatre is now lighted by means of gas, in a most brilliant manner.  _Musical Festival._  Once in three years, during the month of October, the vocal and instrumental performers of the first class are assembled here in greater numbers than any other part of the kingdom can boast. They are collected together at a prodigious expense, for the purpose of performing oratorios, three successive mornings, in the church of St. Philip. In the evening of each day, select concerts are performed in the theatre; and when those performances are closed, the company who are assembled, whilst they are under the same roof, are ushered into an elegant and well-furnished ball room, where they amuse themselves for the remainder of the evening; refreshments being provided upon the spot. These performances are conducted in such a superior style, that great numbers of the nobility and gentry who reside at a considerable distance, are induced to attend. The profits arising from these musical entertainments being appropriated to the benefit of the General Hospital, many of them contribute in a very liberal manner by donations to that institution. The last performances took place in October, 1817, when the committee of managers, after they had defrayed all incidental expences, paid to the treasurers of the general hospital the sum of £4296. 10s. 10d. the total receipts being £8476. 6s. 9d.  The next festival is intended to be celebrated in October, 1820.  There being two rooms of large dimensions, that are each of them fitted up in a style of elegance, as ball rooms, one at the hotel in Temple-row, and the other adjoining the theatre in New-street, there are during winter, subscription concerts and assemblies held at each of them.  Independant of these, private concerts are occasionally held at each of them; those at the hotel being of some years' establishment, the room, although eighty feet in length and thirty-three in breadth, is so completely occupied, that any person who is desirous of becoming a member must probably wait two or three years before they can obtain admission.  _Panorama._  A pile of building was erected in New-street, for the purpose of exhibiting paintings of this description, which has lately been converted into an auction room.  _Deritend House._  This stone-fronted mansion was erected in 1786, as a tavern, under the name of the Apollo, and in consequence of its bowling green, was for several years much frequented. It was afterwards divided into two private houses; but in 1816 being purchased by Wm. Hamper, Esq. that gentleman greatly improved the premises and again converted it into one dwelling, which he makes his residence, and which, from its extensive gardens and pleasant situation, is much admired.  _Duddeston or Vauxhall,_  So called after that place of fashionable resort near London, is little more than a mile from the centre of the town.  This was the ancient residence of the Holt family, and within memory contained some good paintings, as the gardens did a number of lead statues, large as life, and some smaller ones; but depredations being committed by stealing some of them, the others were removed.  These delightful gardens, which contain a very spacious bowling green, an orchestra, a great number of commodious gravel walks, on the borders of which are numerous lofty trees, of various kinds, together with parterres, where flowers of different sorts were accustomed to be seen, were, till of late years, resorted to by none but the genteeler sort of people, and from their retired situation, are every way capable of being made one of the most rural retreats for public amusement of any in the kingdom. Times are now completely changed, it being turned into an alehouse, where persons of all descriptions may be accommodated with that or any other liquor, on which account the upper classes of the inhabitants have entirely absented themselves.  By adopting this method, the editor is of opinion, that the present occupier is accumulating more money than any of his predecessors.--There are, during summer, fire works occasionally exhibited, and sometimes concerts of vocal and instrumental music.  _The Crescent._  Several years have now elapsed since a plot of ground, 1182 feet in length, forming a terrace seventeen feet above the wharfs, was laid out for the purpose of erecting some superior buildings in that form, and the wings were soon after constructed according to the plan; but as yet very little progress has been made in the central buildings.  _The Barracks._  In the year 1793, government took a lease of five acres of land, near Ashsted chapel, at the rate of one penny per square yard, whereon they expended the sum of thirteen thousand pounds, in the erection of barracks to accommodate one hundred and sixty-two men, with their horses.  _Birmingham Fire Office._  In the month of March, 1805, the monied interest in this town opened an institution under the above title; there being three hundred subscribers, at £1000. each. Their office is in Union-street, which for chasteness of design is equal to any other building in the town.  _The Inland Commercial Society._  The merchants, and others, who were accustomed to send goods to, or receive them from Liverpool, having experienced, not only great delays, but the packages being pilfered, to their great prejudice, established this concern, in order to counteract such proceedings in future.  _Theological"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11431"],["title","Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1 (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]  CHARACTER SKETCHES OF ROMANCE, FICTION AND THE DRAMA  A REVISED AMERICAN EDITION OF THE READER'S HANDBOOK  BY  THE REV.

AA'RON, a Moor, beloved by Tam'ora, queen of the Goths, in the tragedy of _Titus Andron'icus_, published among the plays of Shakespeare (1593).  (The classic name is _Andronicus_, but the character of this play is purely fictitious.)  _Aaron (St.)_, a British martyr of the City of Legions (_Newport_, in South Wales). He was torn limb from limb by order of Maximian'us Hercu'lius, general in Britain, of the army of Diocle'tian. Two churches were founded in the City of Legions, one in honor of St. Aaron and one in honor of his fellow-martyr, St. Julius. Newport was called Caerleon by the British.    ... two others ... sealed their doctrine with   their blood;   St. Julius, and with him St. Aaron, have their   room   At Carleon, suffering death by Diocletian's doom. Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xxiv, (1622).  AAZ'IZ (3 _syl._), so the queen of Sheba or Saba is sometimes called; but in the Koran she is called Balkis (ch. xxvii.).  ABAD'DON, an angel of the bottomless pit (_Rev_. ix. 11). The word is derived from the Hebrew, _abad_, \"lost,\" and means _the lost one_. There are two other angels introduced by Klopstock in _The Messiah_ with similar names, but must not be confounded with the angel referred to in _Rev_.; one is Obaddon, the angel of death, and the other Abbad'ona, the repentant devil.  AB'ARIS, to whom Apollo gave a golden arrow, on which to ride through the air.--See _Dictionary of Phrase and Fable_.  ABBAD'ONA, once the friend of Ab'diel, was drawn into the rebellion of Satan half unwillingly. In hell he constantly bewailed his fall, and reproved Satan for his pride and blasphemy. He openly declared to the internals that he would take no part or lot in Satan's scheme for the death of the Messiah, and during the crucifixion lingered about the cross with repentance, hope, and fear. His ultimate fate we are not told, but when Satan and Adramelech are driven back to hell, Obaddon, the angel of death, says--  \"For thee, Abbadona, I have no orders. How long thou art permitted to remain on earth I know not, nor whether thou wilt be allowed to see the resurrection of the Lord of glory ... but be not deceived, thou canst not view Him with the joy of the redeemed.\" \"Yet let me see Him, let me see him!\"--Klopstock, _The Messiah_, xiii.  ABBERVILLE (_Lord_), a young nobleman, 23 years of age, who has for travelling tutor a Welshman of 65, called Dr. Druid, an antiquary, wholly ignorant of his real duties as a guide of youth. The young man runs wantonly wild, squanders his money, and gives loose to his passions almost to the verge of ruin, but he is arrested and reclaimed by his honest Scotch bailiff or financier, and the vigilance of his father's executor, Mr. Mortimer. This \"fashionable lover\" promises marriage to a vulgar, malicious city minx named Lucinda Bridgemore, but is saved from this pitfall also.--Cumberland, _The Fashionable Lover_ (1780).  ABBOT (_The_), the complacent churchman in Aldrich's poem of _The Jew's Gift_, who hanged a Jew \"just for no crime,\" and pondered and smiled and gave consent to the heretic's burial--  \"Since he gave his beard to the birds.\" (1881.)  ABDAL-AZIS, the Moorish governor of Spain after the overthrow of king Roderick. When the Moor assumed regal state and affected Gothic sovereignty, his subjects were so offended that they revolted and murdered him. He married Egilona, formerly the wife of Roderick.-- Southey, _Roderick, etc_., xxii. (1814).  AB'DALAZ'IZ (_Omar ben_), a caliph raised to \"Mahomet's bosom\" in reward of his great abstinence and self-denial.--_Herbelot_, 690.  He was by no means scrupulous; nor did he think with the caliph Omar ben Abdalaziz that it was necessary to make a hell of this world to enjoy paradise in the next.--W. Beckford, _Vathek_ (1786).  ABDAL'DAR, one of the magicians in the Domdaniel caverns, \"under the roots of the ocean.\" These spirits were destined to be destroyed by one of the race of Hodei'rah (3 _syl_.), so they persecuted the race even to death. Only one survived, named Thal'aba, and Abdaldar was appointed by lot to find him out and kill him. He discovered the stripling in an Arab's tent, and while in prayer was about to stab him to the heart with a dagger, when the angel of death breathed on him, and he fell dead with the dagger in his hand. Thalaba drew from the magician's finger a ring which gave him command over the spirits. --Southey, _Thalaba the Destroyer_, ii. iii. (1797).  ABDALLA, one of sir Brian de Bois Guilbert's slaves.--Sir W. Scott, _Ivanhoe_ (time, Richard I.).  _Abdal'lah_, brother and predecessor of Giaf'fer (2 _syl_.), pacha of Aby'dos. He was murdered by the pacha.--Byron, _Bride of Abydos_.  ABDALLAH EL HADGI, Saladin's envoy.--Sir W. Scott, _The Talisman_ (time, Richard I.).  ABDALS or _Santons_, a class of religionists who pretend to be inspired with the most ravishing raptures of divine love. Regarded with great veneration by the vulgar.--_Olearius_, i. 971.  AB'DIEL, the faithful seraph who withstood Satan when he urged those under him to revolt.    ... the seraph Abdiel,"]]]
