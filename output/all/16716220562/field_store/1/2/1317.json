Yes, of exalted people, and even of their near associates, life, because it aims more high than the aforementioned Aristotle, demands upon occasion a more great catharsis, which would purge any audience of unmanliness, through pity and through terror, because, by a quaint paradox, the players have been purged of humanity. For a moment Destiny has thrust her scepter into the hands of a human being and Chance has exalted a human being to decide the issue of many human lives. These two--with what immortal chucklings one may facilely imagine--have left the weakling thus enthroned, free to direct the heavy outcome, free to choose, and free to evoke much happiness or age-long weeping, but with no intermediate course unbarred. _Now prove thyself_! saith Destiny; and Chance appends: _Now prove thyself to be at bottom a god or else a beast, and now eternally abide that choice. And now_ (O crowning irony!) _we may not tell thee clearly by which choice thou mayst prove either_.  In this little book about the women who intermarried, not very enviably, with an unhuman race (a race predestinate to the red ending which I have chronicled elsewhere, in _The Red Cuckold_), it is of ten such moments that I treat.  You alone, I think, of all persons living, have learned, as you have settled by so many instances, to rise above mortality in such a testing, and unfailingly to merit by your conduct the plaudits and the adoration of our otherwise dissentient world. You have often spoken in the stead of Destiny, with nations to abide your verdict; and in so doing have both graced and hallowed your high vicarship. If I forbear to speak of this at greater length, it is because I dare not couple your well-known perfection with any imperfect encomium. Upon no plea, however, can any one forbear to acknowledge that he who seeks to write of noble ladies must necessarily implore at outset the patronage of her who is the light and mainstay of our age.  _Therefore to you, madame--most excellent and noble lady, to whom I love to owe both loyalty and love--I dedicate this little book._     I  _THE STORY OF THE SESTINA_     \"Armatz de fust e de fer e d'acier, Mos ostal seran bosc, fregz,   e semdier, E mas cansos sestinas e descortz, E mantenrai los frevols   contra 'ls fortz.\"  THE FIRST NOVEL.--ALIANORA OF PROVENCE, COMING IN DISGUISE AND IN ADVERSITY TO A CERTAIN CLERK, IS BY HIM CONDUCTED ACROSS A HOSTILE COUNTRY; AND IN THAT TROUBLED JOURNEY ARE MADE MANIFEST TO EACH THE SNARES WHICH HAD BEGUILED THEM AFORETIME.     The Story of the Sestina   In this place we have to do with the opening tale of the Dizain of Queens. I abridge, as afterward, at discretion; and an initial account of the Barons' War, among other superfluities, I amputate as more remarkable for veracity than interest. The result, we will agree at outset, is that to the Norman cleric appertains whatever these tales may have of merit, whereas what you find distasteful in them you must impute to my delinquencies in skill rather than in volition.  Within the half hour after de Giars' death (here one overtakes Nicolas mid-course in narrative) Dame Alianora thus stood alone in the corridor of a strange house. Beyond the arras the steward and his lord were at irritable converse.  First, \"If the woman be hungry,\" spoke a high and peevish voice, \"feed her. If she need money, give it to her. But do not annoy me.\"  \"This woman demands to see the master of the house,\" the steward then retorted.  \"O incredible Boeotian, inform her that the master of the house has no time to waste upon vagabonds who select the middle of the night as an eligible time to pop out of nowhere. Why did you not do so in the beginning, you dolt?\" The speaker got for answer only a deferential cough, and very shortly continued: \"This is remarkably vexatious. _Vox et praeterea nihil_--which signifies, Yeck, that to converse with women is always delightful. Admit her.\" This was done, and Dame Alianora came into an apartment littered with papers, where a neat and shriveled gentleman of fifty-odd sat at a desk and scowled.  He presently said, \"You may go, Yeck.\" He had risen, the magisterial attitude with which he had awaited her entrance cast aside. \"Oh, God!\" he said; \"you, madame!\" His thin hands, scholarly hands, were plucking at the air.  Dame Alianora had paused, greatly astonished, and there was an interval before she said, \"I do not recognize you, messire.\"  \"And yet, madame, I recall very clearly that some thirty years ago the King-Count Raymond BÃ©renger, then reigning in Provence, had about his court four daughters, each one of whom was afterward wedded to a king. First, Meregrett, the eldest, now regnant in France; then Alianora, the second and most beautiful of these daughters, whom troubadours hymned as the Unattainable Princess. She was married a long while ago, madame, to the King of England, Lord Henry, third of that name to reign in these islands.\"  Dame Alianora's eyes were narrowing. \"There is something in your voice,\" she said, \"which I recall.\"  He answered: \"Madame and Queen, that is very likely, for it is a voice which sang a deal in Provence when both of us were younger. I concede with the Roman that I have somewhat deteriorated since the reign of Cynara. Yet have you quite forgotten the Englishman who made so many songs of you? They called him Osmund Heleigh.\"  \"He made the Sestina of Spring which won the violet crown at my betrothal,\" the Queen said; and then, with eagerness: \"Messire, can it be that you are Osmund Heleigh?\" He shrugged assent. She looked at him for a long time, rather sadly, and demanded if he were the King's man or of the barons' party.  The nervous hands were raised in deprecation. \"I have no politics,\" Messire Heleigh began, and altered it, gallantly enough, to, \"I am the Queen's man, madame.\"  \"Then aid me, Osmund,\" she said.  He answered with a gravity which singularly became him, \"You have reason to understand that to my fullest power I will aid you.\"  \"You know that at Lewes these swine overcame us.\" He nodded assent. \"Now they hold the King, my husband, captive at Kenilworth. I am content that he remain there, for he is of all the King's enemies the most dangerous. But, at Wallingford, Leicester has imprisoned my son, Prince Edward. The Prince must be freed, my Osmund. Warren de Basingbourne commands what is left of the royal army, now entrenched at Bristol, and it is he who must liberate my son. Get me to Bristol, then. Afterward we will take Wallingford.\" The Queen issued these orders in cheery, practical fashion, and did not admit opposition into the account, for she was a capable woman.  \"But you, madame?\" he stammered. \"You came alone?\"  \"I come from France, where I have been entreating--and vainly entreating--succor from yet another monkish king, the holy Lewis of that realm. Eh, what is God about when He enthrones these whining pieties! Were I a king, were I even a man, I would drive these smug English out of their foggy isle in three days' space! I would leave alive not one of these curs that dare yelp at me! I would--\" She paused, anger veering into amusement. \"See how I enrage myself when I think of what your people have made me suffer,\" the Queen said, and shrugged her shoulders. \"In effect, I skulked back in disguise to this detestable island, accompanied by Avenel de Giars and Hubert Fitz-Herveis. To-night some half-dozen fellows--robbers, thorough knaves, like all you English,--attacked us on the common yonder and slew the men of our party. While they were cutting de Giars' throat I slipped away in the dark and tumbled through many ditches till I spied your light. There you have my story. Now get me an escort to Bristol.\"  It was a long while before Messire Heleigh spoke. Then, \"These men,\" he said--\"this de Giars and this Fitz-Herveis--they gave their lives for yours, as I understand it,--_pro caris amicis_. And yet you do not grieve for them.\"  \"I shall regret de Giars,\" the Queen acknowledged, \"for he made excellent songs. But Fitz-Herveis?--foh! the man had a face like a horse.\" Again her mood changed. \"Many persons have died for me, my friend. At first I wept for them, but now I am dry of tears.\"  He shook his head. \"Cato very wisely says, 'If thou hast need of help, ask it of thy friends.' But the sweet friend that I remember was a clean eyed girl, joyous and exceedingly beautiful. Now you appear to me one of those ladies of remoter times--Faustina, or Jael, or Artemis, the King's wife of Tauris,--they that slew men, laughing. I am somewhat afraid of you, madame.\"  She was angry at first; then her face softened. \"You English!\" she said, only half mirthful. \"Eh, my God! you remember me when I was a high hearted young sorceress. Now the powers of the Apsarasas have departed from me, and time has thrust that Alianora, who was once the Unattainable Princess, chin deep in misery. Yet even now I am your Queen, messire, and it is not yours to pass judgment upon me.\" \"I do not judge you,\" he returned. \"Rather I cry with him of old, _Omnia incerta ratione!_ and I cry with Salomon that he who meddles with the strife of another man is like to him that takes a hound by the ears. Yet listen, madame and Queen. I cannot afford you an escort to Bristol. This house, of which I am in temporary charge, is Longaville, my brother's manor. Lord Brudenel, as you doubtless know, is of the barons' party and--scant cause for grief!--is with Leicester at this moment. I can trust none of my brother's people, for I believe them to be of much the same opinion as those Londoners who not long ago stoned you and would have sunk your barge in Thames River. Oh, let us not blink the fact that you are not overbeloved in England. So an escort is out of the question. Yet I, madame, if you so elect, will see you safe to Bristol.\"  \"You? Singly?\" the Queen demanded.  \"My plan is this:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11752"],["title","Chivalry: Dizain des Reines (#3)"],["body","folk alone travel whither they will. We will go as jongleurs, then. I can yet manage a song to the viol, I dare affirm. And you must pass as my wife.\"  He said this with simplicity. The plan seemed unreasonable, and at first Dame Alianora waved it aside. Out of the question! But reflection suggested nothing better; it was impossible to remain at Longaville, and the man spoke sober truth when he declared any escort other than himself to be unprocurable. Besides, the lunar madness of the scheme was its strength; that the Queen would venture to cross half England unprotected--and Messire Heleigh on the face of him was a paste-board buckler--was an event which Leicester would neither anticipate nor on report credit. There you were! these English had no imagination. The Queen snapped her fingers and said: \"Very willingly will I be your wife, my Osmund. But how do I know that I can trust you? Leicester would give a deal for me; he would pay any price for the pious joy of burning the Sorceress of Provence. And you are not wealthy, I suspect.\"  \"You may trust me, mon bel esper,\"--his eyes here were those of a beaten child--\"because my memory is better than yours.\" Messire Osmund Heleigh gathered his papers into a neat pile. \"This room is mine. To-night I keep guard in the corridor, madame. We will start at dawn.\"  When he had gone, Dame Alianora laughed contentedly. \"Mon bel esper! my fairest hope! The man called me that in his verses--thirty years ago! Yes, I may trust you, my poor Osmund.\"  So they set out at cockcrow. He had procured for himself a viol and a long falchion, and had somewhere got suitable clothes for the Queen; and in their aging but decent garb the two approached near enough to the appearance of what they desired to be thought. In the courtyard a knot of servants gaped, nudged one another, but openly said nothing. Messire Heleigh, as they interpreted it, was brazening out an affair of gallantry before the countryside; and they esteemed his casual observation that they would find a couple of dead men on the common exceedingly diverting.  When the Queen asked him the same morning, \"And what will you sing, my Osmund? Shall we begin the practise of our new profession with the Sestina of Spring?\"--old Osmund Heleigh grunted out: \"I have forgotten that rubbish long ago. _Omnis amans, amens_, saith the satirist of Rome town, and with reason.\"  Followed silence.  One sees them thus trudging the brown, naked plains under a sky of steel. In a pageant the woman, full-veined and comely, her russet gown girded up like a harvester's might not inaptly have prefigured October; and for less comfortable November you could nowhere have found a symbol more precise than her lank companion, humorously peevish under his white thatch of hair, and constantly fretted by the sword tapping at his ankles.  They made Hurlburt prosperously and found it vacant, for the news of Falmouth's advance had driven the villagers hillward. There was in this place a child, a naked boy of some two years, lying on a doorstep, overlooked in his elders' gross terror. As the Queen with a sob lifted this boy the child died.  \"Starved!\" said Osmund Heleigh; \"and within a stone's throw of my snug home!\"  The Queen laid down the tiny corpse, and, stooping, lightly caressed its sparse flaxen hair. She answered nothing, though her lips moved.  Past Vachel, scene of a recent skirmish, with many dead in the gutters, they were overtaken by Falmouth himself, and stood at the roadside to afford his troop passage. The Marquess, as he went by, flung the Queen a coin, with a jest sufficiently high flavored. She knew the man her inveterate enemy, knew that on recognition he would have killed her as he would a wolf; she smiled at him and dropped a curtsey.  \"This is remarkable,\" Messire Heleigh observed. \"I was hideously afraid, and am yet shaking. But you, madame, laughed.\"  The Queen replied: \"I laughed because I know that some day I shall have Lord Falmouth's head. It will be very sweet to see it roll in the dust, my Osmund.\"  Messire Heleigh somewhat dryly observed that tastes differed.  At Jessop Minor befell a more threatening adventure. Seeking food at the _Cat and Hautbois_ in that village, they blundered upon the same troop at dinner in the square about the inn. Falmouth and his lieutenants were somewhere inside the house. The men greeted the supposed purveyors of amusement with a shout; and one of these soldiers--a swarthy rascal with his head tied in a napkin--demanded that the jongleurs grace their meal with a song.  Osmund tried to put him off with a tale of a broken viol.  But, \"Haro!\" the fellow blustered; \"by blood and by nails! you will sing more sweetly with a broken viol than with a broken head. I would have you understand, you hedge thief, that we gentlemen of the sword are not partial to wordy argument.\" Messire Heleigh fluttered inefficient hands as the men-at-arms gathered about them, scenting some genial piece of cruelty. \"Oh, you rabbit!\" the trooper jeered, and caught at Osmund's throat, shaking him. In the act this rascal tore open Messire Heleigh's tunic, disclosing a thin chain about his neck and a handsome locket, which the fellow wrested from its fastening. \"Ahoi!\" he continued. \"Ahoi, my comrades, what sort of minstrel is this, who goes about England all hung with gold like a Cathedral Virgin! He and his sweetheart\"--the actual word was grosser--\"will be none the worse for an interview with the Marquess.\"  The situation smacked of awkwardness, because Lord Falmouth was familiar with the Queen, and to be brought specifically to his attention meant death for two detected masqueraders. Hastily Osmund Heleigh said:  \"Messire, the locket contains the portrait of a lady whom in my youth I loved very greatly. Save to me, it is valueless. I pray you, do not rob me of it.\"  But the trooper shook his head with drunken solemnity. \"I do not like the looks of this. Yet I will sell it to you, as the saying is, for a song.\"  \"It shall be the king of songs,\" said Osmund,--\"the song that Arnaut Daniel first made. I will sing for you a Sestina, messieurs,--a Sestina in salutation of Spring.\"  The men disposed themselves about the dying grass, and presently he sang.  Sang Messire Heleigh:    \"Awaken! for the servitors of Spring   Proclaim his triumph! ah, make haste to see   With what tempestuous pageantry they bring   The victor homeward! haste, for this is he   That cast out Winter and all woes that cling   To Winter's garments, and bade April be!    \"And now that Spring is master, let us be   Content, and laugh, as anciently in spring   The battle-wearied Tristan laughed, when he   Was come again Tintagel-ward, to bring   Glad news of Arthur's victory--and see   Ysoude, with parted lips, that waver and cling.    \"Not yet in Brittany must Tristan cling   To this or that sad memory, and be   Alone, as she in Cornwall; for in spring   Love sows against far harvestings,--and he   Is blind, and scatters baleful seed that bring   Such fruitage as blind Love lacks eyes to see!\"  Osmund paused here for an appreciable interval, staring at the Queen. You saw his flabby throat a-quiver, his eyes melting, saw his cheeks kindle, and youth seeping into the lean man like water over a crumbling dam. His voice was now big and desirous.  Sang Messire Heleigh:    \"Love sows, but lovers reap; and ye will see   The loved eyes lighten, feel the loved lips cling,   Never again when in the grave ye be   Incurious of your happiness in spring,   And get no grace of Love there, whither he   That bartered life for love no love may bring.    \"No braggart Heracles avails to bring   Alcestis hence; nor here may Roland see   The eyes of Aude; nor here the wakening spring   Vex any man with memories: for there be   No memories that cling as cerements cling,   No force that baffles Death, more strong than he.    \"Us hath he noted, and for us hath he   An hour appointed; and that hour will bring   Oblivion.--Then, laugh! Laugh, dear, and see   The tyrant mocked, while yet our bosoms cling,   While yet our lips obey us, and we be   Untrammeled in our little hour of spring!    \"Thus in the spring we jeer at Death, though he   Will see our children perish and will briny   Asunder all that cling while love may be.\"  Then Osmund put the viol aside and sat quite silent. The soldiery judged, and with cordial frankness stated, that the difficulty of his rhyming scheme did not atone for his lack of indecency, but when the Queen of England went among them with Messire Heleigh's faded green hat she found them liberal. Even the fellow with the broken head admitted that a bargain was proverbially a bargain, and returned the locket with the addition of a coin. So for the present these two went safe, and quitted the _Cat and Hautbois_ fed and unmolested.  \"My Osmund,\" Dame Alianora said, presently, \"your memory is better than I had thought.\"  \"I remembered a boy and a girl,\" he returned. \"And I grieved that they were dead.\"  Afterward they plodded on toward Bowater, and the ensuing night rested in Chantrell Wood. They had the good fortune there to encounter dry and windless weather and a sufficiency of brushwood, with which Osmund constructed an agreeable fire. In its glow these two sat, eating bread and cheese.  But talk languished at the outset. The Queen had complained of an ague, and Messire Heleigh was sedately suggesting three spiders hung about the neck as an infallible corrective for this ailment, when Dame Alianora rose to her feet. \"Eh, my God!\" she said; \"I am wearied of such ungracious aid! Not an inch of the way but you have been thinking of your filthy books and longing to be back at them! No; I except the moments when you were frightened into forgetfulness--first by Falmouth, then by the trooper. O Eternal Father! afraid of a single dirty soldier!\"  \"Indeed, I was very much afraid,\" said Messire Heleigh, with perfect simplicity; \"_timidus perire, madame._\"  \"You have not even"]]]
