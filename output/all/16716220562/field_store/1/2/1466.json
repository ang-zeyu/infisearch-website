During his residence in the university, he contracted an intimate friendship with Charles Montague, esq; afterwards earl of Hallifax, in conjunction with whom he wrote a very humorous piece, entitled The Hind and Panther transversed to the story of the Country Mouse, and the City Mouse, printed 1687 in 4to. in answer to Mr. Dryden's Hind and the Panther, published the year before.  Upon the revolution Mr. Prior was brought to court by his great patron the earl of Dorset, by whose interest he was introduced to public employment, and in the year 1690 was made secretary to the earl of Berkley, plenipotentiary to King William and Queen Mary at the Congress at the Hague.  In this station he acquitted himself so well, that he was afterwards appointed secretary to the earls of Pembroke, and Jersey, and Sir Joseph Williamson, ambassadors, and plenipotentiaries, at the treaty of Ryswick 1697, as he was likewise in 1698 to the earl of Portland, ambassador to the court of France. While he was in that kingdom, one of the officers of the French King's houshold, shewing him the royal apartments, and curiosities at Versailles, especially the paintings of Le Brun, wherein the victories of Lewis XIV. are described, asked him, whether King William's actions are to be seen in his palace? 'No Sir, replied Mr. Prior, the monuments of my master's actions are to be seen every where, but in his own house.'  In the year 1697 Mr. Prior was made secretary of state for Ireland, and in 1700 was created master of arts by Mandamus, and appointed one of the lords commissioners of trade and plantations, upon the resignation of Mr. Locke. He was also Member of Parliament for East-Grimstead in Sussex. In 1710 he was supposed to have had a share in writing the Examiner, and particularly a Criticism in it upon a Poem of Dr. Garth to the earl of Godolphin, taken notice of in the life of Garth.  About this time, when Godolphin was defeated by Oxford, and the Tories who had long been eclipsed by the lustre of Marlborough, began again to hold up their heads, Mr. Prior and Dr. Garth espoused opposite interests; Mr. Prior wrote for, and Garth against the court. The Dr. was so far honest, that he did not desert his patron in distress; and notwithstanding the cloud which then hung upon the party, he addressed verses to him, which, however they may fail in the poetry, bear strong the marks of gratitude, and honour.  While Mr. Prior was thus very early initiated in public business, and continued in the hurry of affairs for many years, it must appear not a little surprizing, that he should find sufficient opportunities to cultivate his poetical talents, to the amazing heights he raised them. In his preface to his poems, he says, that poetry was only the product of his leisure hours; that he had commonly business enough upon his hands, and, as he modestly adds, was only a poet by accident; but we must take the liberty of differing from him in the last particular, for Mr. Prior seems to have received from the muses, at his nativity, all the graces they could well bestow on their greatest favourite.  We must not omit one instance in Mr. Prior's conduct, which will appear very remarkable: he was chosen a member of that Parliament which impeached the Partition Treaty, to which he himself had been secretary; and though his share in that transaction was consequently very considerable, yet he joined in the impeachment upon an honest principle of conviction, that exceptionable measures attended it.  The lord Bolingbroke, who, notwithstanding many exceptions made both to his conduct, and sentiments in other instances, yet must be allowed to be an accomplished judge of fine talents, entertained the highest esteem for Mr. Prior, on account of his shining abilities. This noble lord, in a letter dated September 10, 1712, addressed to Mr. Prior, while he was the Queen's minister, and plenipotentiary at the court of France, pays him the following compliment; 'For God's sake, Matt. hide the nakedness of thy country, and give the best turn thy fertile brain will furnish thee with, to the blunders of thy countrymen, who are not much better politicians, than the French are poets.' His lordship thus concludes his epistle; 'It is near three o'clock in the morning, I have been hard at work all day, and am not yet enough recovered to bear much fatigue; excuse therefore the confusedness of this scroll, which is only from Harry to Matt, and not from the secretary to the minister. Adieu, my pen is ready to drop out of my hand, it being now three o'clock in the morning; believe that no man loves you better, or is more faithfully yours, &c.  'BOLINGBROKE.'  There are several other letters from Bolingbroke to Prior, which, were it necessary, we might insert as evidences of his esteem for him; but Mr. Prior was in every respect so great a man, that the esteem even of lord Bolingbroke cannot add much to the lustre of his reputation, both as a statesman, and a poet. Mr. Prior is represented by those who knew, and have wrote concerning him, as a gentleman, who united the elegance and politeness of a court, with the scholar, and the man of genius. This representation, in general, may be just, yet it holds almost invariably true, that they who have risen from low life, still retain some traces of their original. No cultivation, no genius, it seems, is able entirely to surmount this: There was one particular in which Mr. Prior verified the old proverb.  The same woman who could charm the waiter in a tavern, still maintained her dominion over the embassador at France. The Chloe of Prior, it seems, was a woman in this station of life; but he never forsook her in the heighth of his reputation. Hence we may observe, that associations with women are the most lasting of all, and that when an eminent station raises a man above many other acts of condescension, a mistress will maintain her influence, charm away the pride of greatness, and make the hero who fights, and the patriot who speaks, for the liberty of his country, a slave to her. One would imagine however, that this woman, who was a Butcher's wife, must either have been very handsome, or have had something about her superior to people of her rank: but it seems the case was otherwise, and no better reason can be given for Mr. Prior's attachment to her, but that she was his taste. Her husband suffered their intrigue to go on unmolested; for he was proud even of such a connexion as this, with so great a man as Prior; a singular instance of good nature.  In the year 1715 Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and upon his arrival was taken up by a warrant from the House of Commons; shortly after which, he underwent a very strict examination by a Committee of the Privy Council. His political friend, lord Bolingbroke, foreseeing a storm, took shelter in France, and secured Harry, but left poor Matt. in the lurch.  On the 10th of June Robert Walpole, esq; moved the House against him, and on the 17th Mr. Prior was ordered into close custody, and no person was admitted to see him without leave from the Speaker. For the particulars of this procedure of the Parliament, both against Mr. Prior, and many others concerned in the public transactions of the preceding reign, we refer to the histories of that time. In the year 1717 an Act of Grace was passed in favour of those who had opposed the Hanoverian succession, as well as those who had been in open rebellion, but Mr. Prior was excepted out of it. At the close of this year, however, he was discharged from his confinement, and retired to spend the residue of his days at Downhall in Essex.  The severe usage which Mr. Prior met with, perhaps was the occasion of the following beautiful lines, addressed to his Chloe;    From public noise, and factious strife,   From all the busy ills of life,   Take me, my Chloe, to thy breast;   And lull my wearied soul to rest:   For ever, in this humble cell,   Let thee and I, my fair one, dwell;   None enter else, but Love----and he   Shall bar the door, and keep the key.      To painted roofs, and shining spires   (Uneasy feats of high desires)   Let the unthinking many croud,   That dare be covetous, and proud;   In golden bondage let them wait,   And barter happiness for state:   But oh! my Chloe when thy swain   Desires to see a court again;   May Heav'n around his destin'd head   The choicest of his curses shed,   To sum up all the rage of fate.   In the two things I dread, and hate,   May'st thou be false, and I be great.  In July 1721, within two months of his death, Mr. Prior published the following beautiful little tale on the falshood of mankind, entitled The Conversation, and applied it to the truth, honour, and justice of his grace the duke of Dorset.    The CONVERSATION. A Tale.     It always has been thought discreet   To know the company you meet;   And sure, there may be secret danger   In talking much before a stranger.   Agreed: what then? then drink your ale;   I'll pledge you, and repeat my tale.      No matter where the scene is fix'd,   The persons were but odly mix'd,   When sober Damon thus began:   (And Damon is a clever man)      I now grow old; but still from youth,   Have held for modesty and truth,   The men, who by these sea-marks steer,   In life's great voyage, never err;   Upon this point I dare defy   The world; I pause for a reply.

The Stagyrite   Says thus, and says extremely right;   Strict justice is the sovereign guide,   That o'er our actions should preside;   This queen of virtue is confess'd   To regulate and bind the rest.   Thrice happy, if you can but find   Her equal balance poise your mind:   All diff'rent graces soon will enter,   Like lines concurrent to their center.      'Twas thus, in short, these two went on,   With yea and nay, and pro and con,   Thro' many points divinely dark,   And Waterland assaulting Clarke;   'Till, in theology half lost,   Damon took up the Evening-Post;   Confounded Spain, compos'd the North,   And deep in politics held forth.      Methinks, we're in the like condition,   As at the treaty of partition;   That stroke, for all King William's care,   Begat another tedious war.   Matthew, who knew the whole intrigue,   Ne'er much approv'd that mystic league;   In the vile Utrecht treaty too,   Poor man! he found enough to do.   Sometimes to me he did apply;   But downright Dunstable was I,   And told him where they were mistaken,   And counsell'd him to save his bacon:   But (pass his politics and prose)   I never herded with his foes;   Nay, in his verses, as a friend,   I still found something to commend.   Sir, I excus'd his Nut-brown maid;   Whate'er severer critics said:   Too far, I own, the girl was try'd:   The women all were on my side.   For Alma I return'd him thanks,   I lik'd her with her little pranks;   Indeed, poor Solomon, in rhime,   Was much too grave to be sublime.   Pindar and Damon scorn transition,   So on he ran a new division;   'Till, out of breath, he turn'd to spit:   (Chance often helps us more than wit)   T'other that lucky moment took,   Just nick'd the time, broke in, and spoke.      Of all the gifts the gods afford   (If we may take old Tully's word)   The greatest is a friend, whose love   Knows how to praise, and when reprove;   From such a treasure never part,   But hang the jewel on your heart:   And pray, sir (it delights me) tell;   You know this author mighty well--   Know him! d'ye question it? ods fish!   Sir, does a beggar know his dish?   I lov'd him, as I told you, I   Advis'd him--here a stander-by   Twitch'd Damon gently by the cloke,   And thus unwilling silence broke:   Damon, 'tis time we should retire,   The man you talk with is Matt. Prior.      Patron, thro' life, and from thy birth my friend,   Dorset, to thee this fable let me send:   With Damon's lightness weigh thy solid worth;   The foil is known to set the diamond forth:   Let the feign'd tale this real moral give,   How many Damons, how few Dorsets live!  Mr. Prior, after the fatigue of a length of years past in various services of action, was desirous of spending the remainder of his days in rural tranquility, which the greatest men of all ages have been fond of enjoying: he was so happy as to succeed in his wish, living a very retired, and contemplative life, at Downhall in Essex, and found, as he expressed himself, a more solid, and innocent satisfaction among woods, and meadows, than he had enjoyed in the hurry, and tumults of the world, the courts of Princes, or the conducting foreign negotiations; and where as he melodiously sings,    The remnant of his days he safely past,   Nor found they lagg'd too slow, nor flew too fast;   He made his wish with his estate comply,   Joyful to live, yet not afraid to die.  This great man died on the 18th of September, 1721, at Wimple in Cambridgshire, the seat of the earl of Oxford, with whose friendship he had been honoured for some years. The death of so distinguished a person was justly esteemed an irreparable loss to the polite world, and his memory will be ever dear to those, who have any relish for the muses in their softer charms. Some of the latter part of his life was employed in collecting materials for an History of the Transactions of his own Times, but his death unfortunately deprived the world of what the touches of so masterly a hand, would have made exceeding valuable.  Mr. Prior, by the suffrage of all men of taste, holds the first rank in poetry, for the delicacy of his numbers, the wittiness of his turns, the acuteness of his remarks, and, in one performance, for the amazing force of his sentiments. The stile of our author is likewise so pure, that our language knows no higher authority, and there is an air of original in his minutest performances.  It would be superfluous to give any detail of his poems, they are in the hands of all who love poetry, and have been as often admired, as read. The performance however, for which he is most distinguished, is his Solomon; a Poem in three Books, the first on Knowledge, the second on Pleasure, and the third on Power. We know few poems to which this is second, and it justly established his reputation as one of the best writers of his age.  This sublime work begins thus,    Ye sons of men, with just regard attend,   Observe the preacher, and believe the friend,   Whose serious muse inspires him to explain,   That all we act, and all we think is vain:   That in this pilgrimage of seventy years,   O'er rocks of perils, and thro' vales of tears   Destin'd to march, our doubtful steps we tend,   Tir'd of the toil, yet fearful of its end:   That from the womb, we take our fatal shares,   Of follies, fashions, labours, tumults, cares;   And at approach of death shall only know,   The truths which from these pensive numbers flow,   That we pursue false joy, and suffer real woe.  After an enquiry into, and an excellent description of the various operations, and effects of nature, the system of the heavens, &c. and not being fully informed of them, the first Book concludes,    How narrow limits were to wisdom given?   Earth she surveys; she thence would measure Heav'n:   Thro' mists obscure, now wings her tedious way;   Now wanders dazl'd, with too bright a day;   And from the summit of a pathless coast   Sees infinite, and in that sight is lost.  In the second Book the uncertainty, disappointment, and vexation attending pleasure in general, are admirably described; and in the character of Solomon is sufficiently shewn, that nothing debases majesty, or indeed any man, more than ungovernable passion.    When thus the gath'ring storms of wretched love   In my swoln bosom, with long war had strove;   At length they broke their bounds; at length their force   Bore down whatever met its stronger course:   Laid all the civil bounds of manhood waste.   And scatter'd ruin, as the torrent past.  The third Book treats particularly of the trouble and instability of greatness and power, considers man through the several stages and conditions of life, and has excellent reasoning upon life and death. On the last are these lines;    Cure of the miser's wish, and cowards fear,   Death only shews us, what we knew was near.   With courage therefore view the 'pointed hour;   Dread not death's anger, but expect its power;   Nor nature's laws, with fruitless sorrow mourn;   But die, O mortal man! for thou wast born.  The poet has likewise these similies on life;    As smoke that rises from the kindling fires   Is seen this moment, and the next expires:   As empty clouds by rising winds are tost,   Their fleeting forms no sooner found than lost:   So vanishes our state; so pass our days;   So life but opens now, and now decays;   The cradle, and the tomb, alas! so nigh;   To live is scarce distinguished from to die.  We shall conclude this account of Mr. Prior's life with the following copy of verses, written on his Death by Robert Ingram, esq; which is a very successful imitation of Mr. Prior's manner.    1.    Mat. Prior!--(and we must submit)     Is at his journey's end;   In whom the world has lost a wit,     And I, what's more, a friend.    2.    Who vainly hopes long here to stay,     May see with weeping eyes;   Not only nature posts away,     But e'en good nature dies!   3.    Should grave ones count these praises light,     To such it may be said:   A man, in this lamented wight,     Of business too is dead.    4.    From ancestors, as might a fool!     He trac'd no high-fetch'd stem;   But gloriously revers'd the rule,     By dignifying them.    5.    O! gentle Cambridge! sadly say,     Why fates are so unkind   To snatch thy giant sons away,     Whilst pigmies stay behind?    6.    Horace and he were call'd, in haste,     From this vile earth to heav'n;   The cruel year not fully past,     Ætatis, fifty seven.    7.    So, on the tops of Lebanon,     Tall cedars felt the sword,   To grace, by care of Solomon,     The temple of the Lord.    8.    A tomb amidst the learned may     The western abbey give!   Like theirs, his ashes must decay,     Like theirs, his fame shall live.   9.    Close, carver, by some well cut books,     Let a thin busto tell,   In spite of plump and pamper'd looks,     How scantly sense can dwell!    10.    No epitaph of tedious length     Should overcharge the stone;   Since loftiest verse would lose its strength,     In mentioning his own.    11.    At once! and not verbosely tame,     Some brave Laconic pen   Should smartly touch his ample name,     In form of--O rare Ben!         *       *       *       *       *     Mrs. SUSANNA CENTLIVRE,   This lady was daughter of one Mr. Freeman, of Holbeack in Lincolnshire. There was formerly an estate in the family of her father, but being a Dissenter, and a zealous parliamentarian, he was so very much persecuted at the restoration, that he was laid under a necessity to fly into Ireland, and his estate was confiscated; nor was the family of our authoress's mother free from the severity of those times, they being likewise parliamentarians. Her education was in the country, and her father dying when she was but three years of age, and her mother not living 'till she was twelve, the improvements our poetess made were merely by her own industry and application. She was married before the age of fifteen, to a nephew of "]]]
