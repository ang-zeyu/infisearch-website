Meanwhile, good luck and good-bye.\"  He sat erect upon his horse, watching as we clattered past, appearing scarcely more than a dim shadow, yet I thought he held his hat in his hand. Billie laid on the gad, however, as if to make up for lost time, and the pony trotted off at such a burst of speed as to keep me busy clinging to my perch. It was an exceedingly rough road, rutty and stony, up hill and down, while the pony condescended to walk on the steepest grades only, and occasionally took the declines at a gallop, the carryall bounding from side to side as though mad. Apparently no fear of possible disaster disturbed Billie, however, for I could hear every few moments the slash of a whip on the animal's flank. I knew that, by this time, we must certainly be well between the lines, but, for the life of me, could not determine where. I thought I knew the surrounding country as I had scouted over it for months, tracing roads and bridle-paths, yet I was puzzled now. If this road continued to run north and south, as it had back yonder, then we should have forded the river long before this, yet we had splashed through no water, nor did I recall our making any turn.  One fact alone seemed certain: as I knew neither where we were, nor whither bound, and as we were already assuredly beyond the last Confederate outpost, it behooved me to act as quickly as possible. Billie was headed somewhere, and the sooner I stopped him the better--besides, my position was neither comfortable nor safe. I rolled off from the edge of the canvas, and, gripping the chains tightly, managed to sit up, in spite of the vicious pitching of the vehicle. Billie's evident eagerness to arrive at his unknown destination only added to my own recklessness, and I hung on desperately, swearing a little, I fear, under my breath.    CHAPTER III  A FRIEND RATHER THAN AN ENEMY  There was only one way in which I could hope to get in--through the back. That was an exceedingly ticklish job, yet I had tackled many a ticklish job before during the two years of my scouting service, and the knowledge of danger was merely the prick of a spur. The rusty buckles holding the flap in place resisted the grip of my fingers, and, opening a knife with my teeth, I cut the leather, severing enough of the straps so the entire flap could be thrown back, yet holding it down closely to its place until I was ready for action. Through a narrow opening I could perceive a dim outline of the driver. He was at the right of the seat, leaning forward, so as to peer out from under the hood, loosened reins in one hand, a whip in the other. The darkness of the night enabled me to perceive little except a vague sense of shape, a head crowned by a soft hat, and an apparently slender figure.  Whatever slight noise I made was lost in the rattle of the wheels, while the driver, utterly thoughtless as to any danger menacing him from behind, concentrated his entire attention upon the road, and his efforts to accelerate the speed of the pony. The present opportunity was as good as I could ever hope for. I grasped the back of the seat with one hand, a revolver in the other, pressed back the flap with my shoulder, and inserted my head within. Not until my voice sounded at his very ear did the fellow realize my presence.  \"Pull up!\" I said sternly. \"Not a movement now; this is a gun at your ear.\"  There was a sharp catch of the breath, a half turning of the head in the surprise of the shock, but his hands held to reins and whip. Tossed about as I was the fellow's coolness angered me.  \"Pull up,\" I said; \"do you think I'm playing with you?\"  He drew in on the reins, letting the whip drop between his feet, and the pony slowed down to a walk, and finally stopped. I could catch merely a glimpse of the man's profile beneath the broad brim of the hat, but his coolness and silence aroused my suspicions.  \"No tricks now,\" I threatened. \"If you value your life do exactly as I say.\"  \"Who are you?\" It was a rich contralto voice, that of a boy rather than a man, the slight blur of the South distinguishable even in those few words.  \"Only a Yankee, son,\" I replied, satisfied I held the upper hand, and clambering in over the back of the seat. He shrank back from contact with me farther into the corner, but there was nothing in the slight movement to cause alarm. I laughed softly.  \"Don't exactly admire my color of uniform, do you?\" I asked easily. \"Well, I can't help that, and you'll not find me such a bad fellow if you act right. Where were you going in such a hurry?\"  There was no answer. I could hear his rapid breathing, and catch a glimpse of a beardless cheek.  \"Don't you intend to tell me?\"  Still silence, the shapeless figure motionless.  \"Come, Billie,\" I urged, \"what is the use of keeping up this game?\"  He straightened up in surprise, startled into speech.  \"You--you call me what? Why do you say 'Billie'?\"  \"Because I'm on. I haven't been hanging to the back of this outfit for the last eight miles just for fun, or exercise either. I'm after those despatches you're taking to Beauregard.\"  \"Oh!\"  \"That's the state of affairs, and the sooner you hand over those particular papers, Billie, the quicker this revolver play ends. Where are they?\"  \"I haven't any,\" the slightly tremulous note had gone out of the voice. It was firm with purpose now, even a bit sarcastic. \"You've merely got on the wrong trail, Yank. I reckon you mistook me for Billie Hardy.\"  \"I reckon I did,\" I returned, mocking him, \"and I 'm still satisfied I've got the right party. You don't get out that easy, son; come now, produce.\"  \"Suppose I don't.\"  \"Then there won't be much argument,\" I returned sharply, beginning to lose patience. \"I'll simply take them, if I have to shoot you first. Come now, which shall it be?\"  He straightened up, convinced apparently of my intentions.  \"Neither, Mr. Yankee,\" indignantly. \"I told you once you were mistaken. Now I'll prove it--see here!\" The soft hat was whipped off the head, and the slender figure leaned forward to where the slight gleam of the stars rendered the face visible. \"Do you make war on women?\"  I was too astounded for reply; dumfounded, dazed by this evidence of my stupidity. This was a woman beyond all doubt--her hair, released by the sudden removal of the hat, swept in a dark wave over her shoulders, and she flung it back with a movement of the hand. The gleam of the stars gave me the contour of her face, and the sparkle of her eyes. A woman, young, pretty--and actually laughing at me, her white teeth clearly visible. Whatever of conceit or audacity may be part of my nature, deserted me in a flash, and I could only stare in helpless amazement.  \"My God! I believe you are!\" I ejaculated at last, the words bursting forth unconsciously. \"How could I have made--who are you anyhow?\"  The restrained laughter rippled forth, as though the expression of my face appealed to her sense of humor. Evidently the lady was no longer afraid of me, nor greatly distressed over the situation.  \"Isn't it too funny,\" she exclaimed cheerfully, \"and won't Billie laugh about this when I tell him!\"  \"Maybe he will,\" I acknowledged rather regretfully, \"but it doesn't make me laugh.\" Then a vague suspicion gripped me. \"Why did you think I took you for Billie?\"  \"Why, that was what you called me, wasn't it? The officer who escorted me past the pickets said Billie Hardy was going to try to run the lines to-night. So it was easy enough to guess who you were after, Mr. Yankee. It was lucky for Billie you got me instead--or for you,\" she added doubtfully.  \"Oh, I guess I would have pulled through.\"  \"Maybe,\" the tone decidedly provoking, \"but I reckon you don't know Billie.\"  She began to gather up her hair, coiling the strands about her head carelessly, and I watched the simple operation, all the life gone out of me, unable to decide what to do. It was useless to go back; almost equally useless to go forward. I had no information to take into our lines of any value, and had failed utterly in my efforts to intercept the important despatches for Beauregard. The knowledge of my mistake stung me bitterly, yet I could blame no one for the failure except myself. The apparent carelessness of the girl puzzled me--why should she be so completely at her ease in this adventure? Only at the first had she exhibited the slightest excitement. This seemed hardly natural--alone, thus suddenly attacked by a stranger, an enemy, and openly threatened.  \"You seem perfectly contented,\" I said. \"Are you not frightened?\"  \"Frightened!\" and she paused in her hair-dressing to bend slightly forward so as to look into my shadowed face. \"Why, of course not; why should I be?\"  \"But I am a stranger to you--a Yank. You are on the other side, are you not?\"  \"Oh, of course,\" her lips revealing again the white teeth. \"But I don't think all Yankees are demons. I don't believe you are. I like your voice. You see, I was educated in the North, and so am not prejudiced. Please won't you take off your hat, just for a minute?\"  I did so, almost mechanically, not even realizing why she asked, until she bent forward, her eyes on my face.  \"No, I am not frightened with you. I was just a little, at first, of course, but not now. You look as though you would fight too, but not with a woman.\" She stopped with an odd little shrug of the shoulders. \"What do you expect me to do--sit here all night?\"  I looked about into the darkness, suddenly recalled to the absurdity of our situation by this question. The stars were glittering overhead, yielding a dim light, yet nothing around us afforded any guess as to where we were. The pony stood with drooping head, his flanks still heaving from his late run. To the right the ground appeared open and level, a cultivated field, while upon the other side was a sharp rise of land covered with brush. It was a lonely, silent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12015"],["title","Love under Fire (#3)"],["body","t, and my eyes turned back inquiringly to my companion.  \"Why, no,\" I replied rather foolishly. \"But I confess I am all at sea just now; where are we?\"  It seemed very easy for her to laugh, and evidently my confession was amusing.  \"You must pardon me,\" she excused herself, \"but I thought you were a scout.\"  \"I am,\" vexed at her propensity to poke fun. \"I have been detailed for that service for more than two years. Moreover, I was a good enough scout to pass within the lines of your army to-night, and to travel the whole length of your camp--\"  \"And then get lost an hour later,\" she interrupted archly. \"Tell me, do you know the points of the compass?\"  \"Certainly; that is north, and this road runs west, but I have no recollection of it. What puzzled me was our failure to cross the river.\"  \"Oh,\" with a quick glance toward me. \"That is easily explained; we turned the corner of the bluff instead. This is the old road to Jonesboro, and has been used very little since the new road was opened. I chose it because I thought I would be less likely to meet with any chance travellers.\"  I began to comprehend more clearly where we were. The extreme right of the position held by our army would be, at least, ten miles east, and the Confederate left scarcely nearer. Beauregard was off in here somewhere,--at Bird's Ferry according to our camp reports the evening previous. This knowledge prompted me to ask,  \"Which way is the river?\"  \"To the right about three miles.\"  \"And Bird's Ferry?\"  I could not be certain she smiled, yet I thought so.  \"Yonder,\" pointing. \"The river curves to the south, and this road comes down to it at Jonesboro; there is a bridge there. The ferry is fifteen miles farther up.\"  The apparent innocence of her answer completely disarmed me. Indeed these facts were exactly as I remembered them now that I had our present position in mind. The peculiar winding course of the river would leave me nearer our lines at Jonesboro than where we then were. Indeed foraging parties were covering much of the territory between, and it was the nearest point where I could cross the stream otherwise than by swimming.  \"Are you going to Jonesboro?\" I asked.  She nodded silently.  \"Then may I ride that far with you?\" I asked, rather doubtful of what she would say to such a request. \"Of course you will be aiding the enemy, for I expect to discover some of our troops in that neighborhood.\"  \"How can I help myself?\" banteringly. \"You are a man, and armed. Practically I am your prisoner.\"  \"Oh, I don't want you to feel that way toward me. I have acted as a gentleman, have I not, ever since I understood?\"  \"You certainly have, and I am not ungrateful. Then you do not order me to take you; you merely ask if I will?\"  \"That is all.\"  \"And that sounds so much better, I think. I don't mind your being a Yankee if you continue to act that way. Shall I drive?\"  \"If you will; you know the road, and the tricks of the pony.\"  She laughed again, gathering up the reins, and reaching down after the whip. At the first movement the little animal broke into a brisk trot as though he understood his driver.    CHAPTER IV  THE COMING OF DAWN  The road was rough, apparently little travelled, and our lively passage over it not greatly conducive to conversation. Besides I hardly knew what to say. The consciousness of total failure in all my plans, and the knowledge that I would be received at headquarters in anything but honor, weighed heavily upon me, yet this depression did not seal my lips half as much as the personality of the young woman at my side. Pleasant and free as her manner had been, yet I was clearly made to realize there was a distinct limit to any familiarity. I could not define the feeling, but it had taken possession of me, and I knew the slightest overstepping of the boundaries would result in trouble. We were neither enemies nor friends; merely acquaintances under a temporary flag of truce. No doubt, trusting me as an honorable soldier, even though wearing an enemy's uniform, she was almost glad to have my protection along this lonely road, but, when the time came to part, she would be equally relieved to have me go. I was nothing to her; if ever remembered again it would be merely to laugh over my discomfiture in mistaking her for another. It hurt my pride to think this, to thus realize her complete indifference. She was a young woman, and I a young man, and nothing in my nature made surrender easy. I desired, at least, to leave behind me some different impression of my own personality. I was not a fool, nor a failure, and I could not bear to have her conceive me as a mere blundering block-head, a subject for subsequent laughter. The silence in which she drove stirred me to revolt. Apparently she felt no overwhelming curiosity as to whom I was, no special desire to exchange further speech. The flapping of the loosened curtain was annoying, and I leaned over and fastened it down securely into place. She merely glanced aside to observe what I was doing, without even opening her lips.  \"This is a miserably gloomy road,\" I ventured desperately. \"I wonder you dared to travel it alone at night.\"  \"Its very loneliness makes it safe,\" was the response, rather indifferently uttered. \"Meeting others was the very thing I was most anxious to avoid.\"  \"Indeed! You are tantalizing; you cannot expect me to be devoid of curiosity.\"  \"Of course not,\" turning her face toward me, \"neither can you expect me to gratify it.\"  \"You mean you could not trust me?\"  \"Rather that you would not believe me, if I did. The reason for this trip is so simple and commonplace that if I were to confess its purpose to you, you would suppose I were attempting deceit. Oh, yes, you would, so I might just as well remain still. Besides it can make no difference anyway. When we reach Jonesboro this morning you will go back to your army, and I shall meet friends. There is scarcely one chance in a thousand we shall ever see each other again. We are the merest strangers--enemies, indeed, for I am a Rebel clear through. We don't even know each others' names.\"  \"Do you care to know mine?\"  She hesitated, and I thought her eyes dropped.  \"I--I hardly know,\" doubtfully. \"Yet you have been very kind, and, perhaps, sometime I might serve you. Yes, you may tell me.\"  \"Robert Galesworth.\"  \"Of what rank?\"  \"Lieutenant, Ninth Illinois Cavalry, but detailed for special service.\"  \"Thank you. I--I am rather glad you told me.\"  \"And you,\" I insisted, determined this confidence should be mutual. \"May I not, in return, be told your name?\"  \"I am Willifred Gray,\" she said quietly. \"That is all--just Willifred Gray.\"  There was something about the manner in which she said this which held me silent. I should have liked to ask more, a second question trembling on my lips, but the words would not come. It was altogether new to me, this fear of offending a woman, so new it almost angered, and yet something about her positively held me as though in bonds. To this day I do not know the secret of it, but I sat there silently staring out into the night.  I could see a little now, becoming aware that dawn was approaching, the sky shading to a dull gray in the east, and casting a weird light over the landscape. It was a gloomy scene of desolation, the road a mere ribbon, overgrown with grass and weeds, a soggy marsh on one side, and a line of sand-hills on the other, sparsely covered by some stunted growth. Far away, across the level, my eyes caught a glimmer of water, locating the river, but in no direction was there any sign of a house, or curl of smoke. The unproductive land--barren and swampy--sufficiently accounted for lack of inhabitants, and told why it had been avoided by the foragers of both armies. Seeking safety the girl had chosen her course wisely--here was desolation so complete as to mock even at the ravages of war. The gray in the east changed to pink, delicately tinting the whole upper sky, objects taking clearer form, a light breeze rustling the long grass. Tirelessly the pony trotted, his head down, the lines lying loose. I turned to gaze at my companion, and our eyes met. Hers were either gray or blue; I could not be certain which, so quickly were they lowered, and so shadowed by long lashes. And they were merry eyes, smiling, and deep with secrets no man could hope to solve. Perhaps she deemed it only fair that I should look at her as she had been observing me; perhaps it was but the coquetry of the \"eternal feminine\" conscious of her own attraction, but she sat there silent, the lashes shading her eyes, the clear light of the dawn upon her face. I cannot describe what I saw, only it was a young face, the skin clear and glowing with health, the nose beautifully moulded, the throat white and round, the red lips arched like a bow, and a broad forehead shadowed by dark hair. She had a trooper's hat on, worn jauntily on one side, crossed sabres in front, and her shoulders were concealed by a gray cavalry cape. Suddenly she flashed a glance at me, her eyes full of laughter.  \"Well, Mr. Lieutenant Galesworth, have you looked long enough?\"  The swift question confused me, but I found answer.  \"No; but as long as I dare. You were observing me also.\"  \"Naturally--womanly curiosity is my excuse. Would you like to know what conclusion I came to?\"  \"From your eyes it may not prove altogether flattering.\"  \"Oh, my eyes are not to be trusted. I warn you frankly of that at the very start. All I shall say is you appear better than I had expected--only, really, you need a shave.\"  \"Better how? In what way?\"  \"Well, younger for one thing; somehow your statement that you were a lieutenant made me suspect your age--or possibly it was your voice.\"  \"I am twenty-four.\"  \"And look to be scarcely twenty. How did you ever gain a commission? Were you in battle?\"  The question decidedly hurt my pride, yet I managed to control my tongue.  \"I have met colonels in both armies no older than I,\" I returned"]]]
