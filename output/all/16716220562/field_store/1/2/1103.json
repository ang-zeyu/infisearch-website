Plutarch tells us that Agesilaus, king of Sparta, was one day discovered riding cock-horse on a long stick, to please and amuse his children.  A'GIB (_King_), \"The Third Calender\" (_Arabian Nights' Entertainments_). He was wrecked on the loadstone mountain, which drew all the nails and iron bolts from his ship; but he overthrew the bronze statue on the mountain-top, which was the cause of the mischief. Agib visited the ten young men, each of whom had lost the right eye, and was carried by a roc to the palace of the forty princesses, with whom he tarried a year. The princesses were then obliged to leave for forty days, but entrusted him with the keys of the palace, with free permission to enter every room but one. On the fortieth day curiosity induced him to open this room, where he saw a horse, which he mounted, and was carried through the air to Bag dad. The horse then deposited him, and knocked out his right eye with a whisk of its tail, as it had done the ten \"young men\" above referred to.  AGITATOR (_The Irish_), Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847).  AGLAE, the unwedded sister in T. B. Aldrich's poem, _The Sisters' Tragedy_ (1891).    Two sisters loved one man. He being dead,   Grief loosed the lips of her he had not wed,   And all the passion that through heavy years,   Had masked in smiles, unmasked itself in tears.  AGNEI'A (3 _syl_.), wifely chastity, sister of Parthen'ia or maiden chastity. Agneia is the spouse of Encra'tês or temperance. Fully described in canto x. of _The Purple Island_, by Phineas Fletcher (1633). (Greek, _agneia_, \"chastity.\")  AG'NES, daughter of Mr. Wickfield the solicitor, and David Copperfield's second wife (after the death of Dora, \"his child wife\"). Agnes is a very pure, self-sacrificing girl, accomplished, yet domestic.--C. Dickens, _David Copperfield_ (1849).  AGNES, in Molière's _L'École des Femmes_, the girl on whom Arnolphe tries his pet experiment of education, so as to turn out for himself a \"model wife.\" She is brought up in a country convent, where she is kept in entire ignorance of the difference of sex, conventional proprieties, the difference between the love of men and women, and that of girls for girls, the mysteries of marriage, and so on. When grown to womanhood she quits the convent, and standing one evening on a balcony a young man passes and takes off his hat to her, she returns the salute; he bows a second and third time, she does the same; he passes and repasses several times, bowing each time, and she does as she has been taught to do by acknowledging the salute. Of course, the young man (_Horace_) becomes her lover, whom she marries, and M. Arnolphe loses his \"model wife.\" (See PINCH-WIFE.)  _Elle fait l'Agnès._ She pretends to be wholly unsophisticated and verdantly ingenuous.--_French Proverb_ (from the \"Agnes\" of Molière, _L'École des Femmes_, 1662).  _Agnes_ (_Black_), the countess of March, noted for her defence of Dunbar against the English.  _Black Agnes_, the palfry of Mary queen of Scots, the gift of her brother Moray, and so called from the noted countess of March, who was countess of Moray (Murray) in her own right.  _Agnes_ (_St._), a young virgin of Palermo, who at the age of thirteen was martyred at Rome during the Diocletian persecution of A.D. 304. Prudence (Aurelius Prudentius Clemens), a Latin Christian poet of the fourth century, has a poem on the subject. Tintoret and Domenichi'no have both made her the subject of a painting.--_The Martyrdom of St. Agnes_.  _St. Agnes and the Devil_. St. Agnes, having escaped from the prison at Rome, took shipping and landed at St. Piran Arwothall. The devil dogged her, but she rebuked him, and the large moor-stones between St. Piran and St. Agnes, in Cornwall, mark the places where the devils were turned into stone by the looks of the indignant saint.--Polwhele, _History of Cornwall_.  _Agnes of Sorrento_, heroine of novel of same name, by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The scene of the story is laid in Sorrento, Italy.  AGRAMAN'TE (4 _syl_.) or AG'RAMANT, king of the Moors, in _Orlando Innamorato_, by Bojardo, and _Orlando Furioso_, by Ariosto.  AGRAWAIN (_Sir_) or SIR AGRAVAIN, surnamed \"The Desirous,\" and also \"The Haughty.\" He was son of Lot (king of Orkney) and Margawse half-sister of king Arthur. His brothers were sir Gaw'ain, sir Ga'heris, and sir Gareth. Mordred was his half-brother, being the son of king Arthur and Margawse. Sir Agravain and sir Mordred hated sir Launcelot, and told the king he was too familiar with the queen; so they asked the king to spend the day in hunting, and kept watch. The queen sent for sir Launcelot to her private chamber, and sir Agravain, sir Mordred, and twelve others assailed the door, but sir Launcelot slew them all except sir Mordred, who escaped.--Sir T. Malory, _History of Prince Arthur_, iii. 142-145 (1470).  AGRICA'NE (4 _syl._), king of Tartary, in the _Orlando Innamorato_, of Bojardo. He besieges Angelica in the castle of Albracca, and is slain in single combat by Orlando. He brought into the field 2,200,000 troops.    Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,   When Agrican, with all his northern powers,   Besieged Albracca.    Milton, _Paradise Regained_, iii. (338).  AGRICOLA FUSILIER, a pompous old creole, a conserver of family traditions, and patriot who figures in George W. Cable's _Grandissimes_ (1880).    He seemed to fancy himself haranguing a   crowd; made another struggle for intelligence,   tried once, twice to speak, and the third time   succeeded: \"Louis--_Louisian--a--for--ever!_\"   and lay still. They put those two words on his   tomb.  AG'RIOS, Lumpishness personified; a \"sullen swain, all mirth that in himself and others hated; dull, dead, and leaden.\" Described in canto viii. of _The Purple Island_, by Phineas Fletcher (1635).

AGUE-CHEEK _(Sir Andrew_), a silly old fop with \"3000 ducats a year,\" very fond of the table, but with a shrewd understanding that \"beef had done harm to his wit.\" Sir Andrew thinks himself \"old in nothing but in understanding,\" and boasts that he can cut a caper, dance the coranto, walk a jig, and take delight in masques, like a young man.--Shakespeare, _Twelfth Night_ (1614).  Woodward (1737-1777) always sustained \"sir Andrew Ague-cheek\" with infinite drollery, assisted by that expression of \"rueful dismay,\" which gave so peculiar a zest to his _Marplot_.--Boaden, _Life of Siddons_ Charles Lamb says that \"Jem White saw James Dodd one evening in _Ague-cheek_, and recognizing him next day in Fleet Street, took off his hat, and saluted him with 'Save you, sir Andrew!' Dodd simply waved his hand and exclaimed, 'Away, fool!'\"  A'HABACK AND DES'RA, two enchanters, who aided Ahu'bal in his rebellion against his brother Misnar, sultan of Delhi. Ahu'bal had a magnificent tent built, and Horam the vizier had one built for the sultan still more magnificent. When the rebels made their attack, the sultan and the best of the troops were drawn off, and the sultan's tent was taken. The enchanters, delighted with their prize, slept therein, but at night the vizier led the sultan to a cave, and asked him to cut a rope. Next morning he heard that a huge stone had fallen on the enchanters and crushed them to a mummy. In fact, this stone formed the head of the bed, where it was suspended by the rope which the sultan had severed in the night.--James Ridley, _Tales of the Genii_ (\"The Enchanters' Tale,\" vi.).  AHASUE'RUS, the cobbler who pushed away Jesus when, on the way to execution. He rested a moment or two at his door. \"Get off! Away with you!\" cried the cobbler. \"Truly, I go away,\" returned Jesus, \"and that quickly; but tarry thou till I come.\" And from that time Ahasuerus became the \"wandering Jew,\" who still roams the earth, and will continue so to do till the \"second coming of the Lord.\" This is the legend given by Paul von Eitzen, bishop of Schleswig (1547).--Greve, _Memoir of Paul von Eitzen_ (1744).  AHER'MAN AND AR'GEN, the former a fortress, and the latter a suite of immense halls, in the realm of Eblis, where are lodged all creatures of human intelligence before the creation of Adam, and all the animals that inhabited the earth before the present races existed.--W. Beckford, _Vathek_ (1786).  AH'MED _(Prince)_, noted for the tent given him by the fairy Pari-banou, which would cover a whole army, and yet would fold up so small that it might be carried in one's pocket. The same good fairy also gave him the apple of Samarcand', a panacea for all diseases.--_Arabian Nights' Entertainments_ (\"Prince Ahmed, etc.\").  AHOLIBA'MAH, granddaughter of Cain, and sister of Anah. She was loved by the seraph Samias'a, and like her sister was carried off to another planet when the Flood came.--Byron, _Heaven and Earth_.

AH'RIMAN OR AHRIMA'NES (4 _syl_.), the angel of darkness and of evil in the Magian system, slain by Mithra.  AIKWOOD (_Ringan_), the forester of sir Arthur Wardour, of Knockwinnock Castle.--Sir W. Scott, _The Antiquary_.  AIMEE, the prudent sister, familiarly known as \"the wise one\" in the Bohemian household described by Francis Hodgson Burnett in _Vagabondia_ (1889).  AIM'WELL _(Thomas, viscount_), a gentleman of broken fortune, who pays his addresses to Dorin'da, daughter of Lady Bountiful. He is very handsome and fascinating, but quite \"a man of the world.\" He and Archer are the two beaux of _The Beaux' Stratagem_, a comedy by George Farquhar (1705).  I thought it rather odd that Holland should be the only \"mister\" of the party, and I said to myself, as Gibbet said when he heard that \"Aimwell\" had gone to church, \"That looks suspicions\" (act ii. sc. 2).--James Smith, _Memoirs, Letters, etc_. (1840).  AIRCASTLE, in the _Cozeners_, by S. Foote. The original of this rambling talker was Gahagan, whose method of conversation is thus burlesqued:  _Aircastle_: \"Did I not tell you what parson Prunello said? I remember, Mrs. Lightfoot was by. She had-been brought to bed that day was a month of a very fine boy--a bad birth; for Dr. Seeton, who served his time with Luke Lancet, of Guise's.--There was also a talk about him and Nancy the daughter. She afterwards married Will Whitlow, another apprentice, who had great expectations from an old uncle in the Grenadiers; but he left all to a distant relation, Kit Cable, a midshipman aboard the _Torbay_. She was lost coming home in the channel. The captain was taken up by a coaster from Eye, loaded with cheese--\" [Now, pray, what did parson Prunello say? This is a pattern of Mrs. Nickleby's rambling gossip.]  AIR'LIE (_The earl of_), a royalist in the service of king Charles I.--Sir W. Scott, _Legend of Montrose_.  AIRY (_Sir George_), a man of fortune, in love with Miran'da, the ward of sir Francis Gripe.--Mrs. Centlivre, _The Busylody_ (1709).  A'JAX, son of Oïleus [_O.i'.luce_], generally called \"the less.\" In conseqnence of his insolence to Cassan'dra, the prophetic daughter of Priam, his ship was driven on a rock, and he perished at sea.--Homer, _Odyssey_, iv. 507; Virgil, _Æneid_, i. 41.  A'JAX TEL'AMON. Sophoclês has a tragedy called _Ajax_, in which \"the madman\" scourges a ram he mistakes for Ulysses. His encounter with a flock of sheep, which he fancied in his madness to be the sons of Atreus, has been mentioned at greater or less length by several Greek and Roman poets. Don Quixote had a similar adventure. This Ajax is introduced by Shakespeare in his drama called _Troilus and Cressida._ (See ALIFANFARON).    The Tuscan poet [_Ariosto_] doth advance   The frantic paladin of France [_Orlando Furioso_];   And those more ancient [_Euripides_ and _Seneca_] do enhance   Alcidês in his fury [_Herculês Furens_];   And others, Ajax Telamon;--   But to this time there hath been none   So bedlam as our Oberon;   Of whom I dare assure you.  M. Drayton, _Nymphidia_ (1536-1631).  AJUT AND ANNINGAIT, in _The Rambler_.    Part, like Ajut, never to return.   Campbell, _Pleasures of Hope_, ii. (1799).

ALADDIN, son of Mustafa, a poor tailor, of China, \"obstinate, disobedent, and mischievous,\" wholly abandoned \"to indolence and licentiousness.\" One day an African magician accosted him, pretending to be his uncle, and sent him to bring up the \"wonderful lamp,\" at the same time giving him a \"ring of safety.\" Aladdin secured the lamp, but would not hand it to the magician till he was out of the cave, whereupon the magician shut him up in the cave, and departed for Africa. Aladdin, wringing his hands in despair, happened to rub the magic ring, when the genius of the ring appeared before him, and asked him his commands. Aladdin requested to be delivered from the cave, and he returned home. By means of his lamp, he obtained untold wealth, built a superb palace, and married Badroul'boudour, the sultan's daughter. After a time, the African magician got possession of the lamp, and caused the palace, with all its contents, to be transported into Africa. Aladdin was absent at the time, was arrested and ordered to execution, but was rescued by the populace, with whom he was an immense favorite, and started to discover what had become of his palace. Happening to slip, he rubbed his ring, and when the genius of the ring appeared and asked his orders, was instantly posted to the place where his palace was in Africa. He poisoned the magician, regained the lamp, and had his palace restored to its original place in China.  Yes, ready money is Aladdin's lamp.  Byron, _Don Juan_, xii. 12.  _Aladdin's Lamp_, a lamp brought from an underground cavern in \"the middle of China.\" Being in want of food, the mother of Aladdin began to scrub it, intending to sell it, when the genius of the lamp appeared, and asked her what were her commands. Aladdin answered, \"I am hungry; bring me food;\" and immediately a banquet was set before him. Having thus become acquainted with the merits of the lamp, he became enormously rich, and married the sultan's daughter. By artifice the African magician got possession of the lamp, and transported the palace with its contents to Africa. Aladdin poisoned the magician, recovered the lamp, and retranslated the palace to its original site.  _Aladdin's Palace Windows_. At the top of the palace was a saloon, containing tweny-four windows (six on each side), and all but one enriched with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. One was left for the sultan to complete, but all the jewellers in the empire were unable to make one to match the others, so Aladdin commanded \"the slaves of the lamp\" to complete their work.  _Aladdin's Ring_, given him by the African magician, \"a preservative against every evil.\"--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp\").  AL'ADINE, the sagacious but cruel king of Jerusalem, slain by Raymond.--Tasso, _Jerusalem Delivered_ (1575).  _Al'adine_ (3 _syl_.), son of Aldus, \"a lusty knight.\"--Spenser, _Faëry Queen_, vi. 3 (1596).  ALAFF, ANLAF, or OLAF, son of Sihtric, Danish king of Northumberland (died 927). When Aethelstan [_Athelstan_] took possession of Northumberland, Alaff fled to Ireland, and his brother Guthfrith or Godfrey to Scotland.    Our English Athelstan,   In the Northumbrian fields, with most victorious might,   Put Alaff and his powers to more inglorious flight.  Drayton, _Potyolbion_, xii. (1612).  ALAIN, cousin of Eos, the artist's wife, in _Desert Sands_, by Harriet Prescott Spofford (1863).  ALAR'CON, king of Barca, who joined the armament of Egypt against the crusaders, but his men were only half armed.--Tasso, _Jerusalem Delivered_ (1575).  ALARIC COTTIN. Frederick the Great of Prussia was so called by Voltaire. \"Alaric\" because, like Alaric, he was a great warrior, and \"Cottin\" because, like Cottin, satirized by Boileau, he was a very indifferent poet.  ALAS'CO, _alias_ DR. DEMETRIUS DOBOOBIE, an old astrologer, consulted by the earl of Leicester.--Sir W. Scott, _Kenilworth_ (time, Elizabeth).  ALAS'NAM (_Prince Zeyn_) possessed eight statues, each a single diamond on a gold pedestal, but had to go in search of a ninth, more valuable than them all. This ninth was a lady, the most beautiful and virtuous of women, \"more precious than rubies,\" who became his wife.  One pure and perfect _[woman]_ is ... like Alasnam's lady, worth them all.--Sir Walter Scott.  _Alasnam's Mirror_. When Alasnam was in search of his ninth statue, the king of the Genii gave him a test mirror, in which he was to look when he saw a beautiful girl; \"if the glass remained pure and unsullied, the damsel would be the same, but if not, the damsel would not be wholly pure in body and in mind.\" This mirror was called \"the touchstone of virtue.\"--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Prince Zeyn Alasnam\").  ALAS'TOR, a surname of Zeus as \"the Avenger.\" Or, in general, any deity or demon who avenges wrong done by man. Shelley wrote a poem, _Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude_.  Cicero says he meditated killing himself that he might become the Alastor of Augustus, whom he hated.--Plutarch, _Cicero, etc._ (\"Parallel Lives.\")  God Almighty mustered up an army of mice against the archbishop [_Hatto_], and sent them to persecute him as his furious Alastors.--Coryat, _Crudities_, 571.  AL'BAN (_St._) of Ver'ulam, hid his confessor, St. Am'phibal, and changing clothes with him, suffered death in his stead. This was during the frightful persecution of Maximia'nus Hercu'lius, general of Diocle'tian's army in Britain, when 1000 Christians fell at Lichfield.    Alban--our proto-martyr called.   Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xxiv. [1622].  AL'BERICK OF MORTEMAR, the same as Theodorick the hermit of Engaddi, an exiled nobleman. He tells king Richard the history of his life, and tries to dissuade him from sending a letter of defiance to the archduke of Austria.--Sir W. Scott, _The Talisman_ (time, Richard I.).  _Al' berick_, the squire of prince Richard, one of the sons of Henry II. of England.--Sir W. Scott, _The Betrothed_ (time, Henry II.).  ALBERT, commander of the _Britannia_. Brave, liberal, and just, softened and refined by domestic ties and superior information. His ship was dashed against the projecting verge of Cape Colonna, the most southern point of Attica, and he perished in the sea because Rodmond (second in command) grasped one of his legs and could not be shaken off.
