Jim Travers was a good runner; and when it is stated that he was certain Tippo Sahib was skurrying at his heels, it need not be added that he \"surpassed himself\" in the way of fleetness. Finding, after running a short way, that the beast was not after him, Jim flung aside the torch and went through the window like a cannon shot, rolling over and striking the other side of the room before his flight was checked. A lad of his years, however, rarely suffers from hard knocks and bumps, and he was on his feet the next moment.  \"Shet the window quick!\" he called, \"or he'll be in here.\"  No need of the appeal, for the mother with deft fingers quickly secured the shutter as before; and but for the lamp, all would have been in darkness again.  Jim darted up-stairs to learn how his playmate was making out.  \"Why don't you shoot, Tom?\" he called, hurrying to his side.  \"'Cause I don't see anything to shoot at,\" was the answer.  \"What's become of the tiger?\"  \"I guess you scared him off.\"  Jim peeped cautiously out of the window.  \"That's so; he isn't anywhere round, but he was out there a few minutes ago.\"  \"So was you; but you aren't there now.\"  \"I thought he chased me clean up to the winder.\"  \"He didn't foller you a single step; when you struck out for the window, he stopped short and laughed ready to die to see you run.\"  \"The tiger laughed at me!\" exclaimed Jim angrily; \"who ever heard of such a thing?\"  \"Well, he looked as though he wanted to laugh, and then trotted down the road; I seen him jump over the fence and make for the woods.\"  \"That's where he's gone! I guess I'll go home now, while I have the chance.\"  \"Better wait, Jim, till you're sure he isn't round.\"  Jim followed this sensible advice, staying to supper, to which he was always welcome.  The women had received so great a shock, that they could not recover from it as quickly as the volatile youngsters. The shutters and doors were kept fastened, and every few minutes they peeped out in quest of the tiger that showed so much enmity toward them. When darkness closed in, however, not the first glimpse had been caught of him, and all began to hope he had taken his final departure. Mrs. Gordon gave her consent that Jimmy Travers should start homeward; and, promising to keep a sharp lookout for the creature, he departed. It may as well be added that he saw nothing more of Tippo Sahib, nor did the animal pay any visit to his home.  \"_Helloa! the house there!_\"  This was the startling summons that rang out in the stillness of the night, about two hours after the departure of Jimmy Travers. Mrs. Gordon stepped to the door, and with some misgiving drew it open. The full moon was shining brightly, and she saw two horsemen who had halted in the highway opposite the gate.  \"Good-evening!\" said the spokesman, lifting his hat in salutation when he observed the woman; \"have you seen anything of a strange animal in this neighborhood, madam? We have traced him almost to this spot, but have lost track of him.\"  \"Do you refer to the tiger that escaped from the menagerie this afternoon?\"  \"That's the animal we're looking for.\"  \"Yes; he was here late in the afternoon, and tried to jump through the window.\"  \"Did he hurt any one?\" asked the man in alarm.  \"No; we did not receive a scratch. My son shot him.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed the other; \"did he kill the animal?\"  \"Oh, no,\" answered Mrs. Gordon (who was joined by Aunt Cynthia and Tom), smiling at the fear of the visitors; \"my boy is quite young, and isn't much of a marksman; he thinks he hit the beast\"--  \"And I did too,\" interjected the lad, not pleased with this slur upon his skill with the gun.  \"Possibly he did; but he was not injured much.\"  \"I am glad to learn that. The tiger is one of the most valuable animals we have in the menagerie; I should be very sorry to lose him.\"  \"But,\" interposed Aunt Cynthia, \"it may become necessary to shoot him in self-defense.\"  \"Not likely; he is not apt to injure any one if he is let alone.\"  Tom had not forgotten the appalling stories told by Jim Travers on his arrival from the exhibition.  \"I heered he chawed up Sam Harper, Jack Habersham, Bill Dunham, and a whole lot of folks that was at the circus.\"  The laughter of the two horsemen was hearty.  \"Those youngsters are alive and well. The boy who punched the tiger in the eye, and caused all this rumpus, was knocked down and scratched somewhat, but not half as much as he deserved. No one else, so far as we can learn, has been injured; though, as I remarked just now, Tippo Sahib will fight if he is driven into a corner.\"  \"He tried to jump through our window,\" said Aunt Cynthia.  \"Before or after you fired at him?\"  \"Afterward.\"  \"I suppose it was caused by the hullabaloo of the people, frightened out of their wits. It is the same as when a hue and cry is raised about a dog. If he isn't mad, he will soon become so. But, madam, we are very anxious to secure the animal before he is killed or seriously injured. We will pay a good reward for his recapture.\"  \"How much?\" asked Tom, to the surprise of his relatives.  \"One hundred dollars to any one who will secure him without injury, or fixes it so we can recapture him. May I ask where the tiger seemed to be going when you last saw him?\"  \"The last we seen of him,\" replied Tom, \"he was cutting 'cross the field toward the woods over yonder.\"  Thanking the boy and the ladies for their information, the horsemen rode off, soon disappearing up the highway.  The fact that these men, experienced in their knowledge of wild animals, were searching for the escaped tiger, naturally lifted much of the fear of the beast from the hearts of the Gordon family. They believed the keepers would recapture him before he could do much harm in the community. They were convinced, too, that they were not the only ones looking for him.  The shutters of all the windows were never more carefully barred than before the three inmates retired to their beds.  Tom Gordon, being a rugged, healthy boy, generally passed the night in refreshing slumber. Not a trace of the ague which kept him from the circus showed itself in his system when he went up-stairs to his room; but, somehow or other, after he lay down he could not sleep.  No doubt the excitement through which he had gone so wrought upon his nerves as to drive away all drowsiness; but the thought that was running through his brain found expression in the words:--  \"A hundred dollars! What a fortune that is! It would make us comfortable for life. I wonder if there is any way of catching Tippo Sahib before the men find him.  \"I don't believe there's anything in what Jim said about looking the creature in the eye. S'pose I should meet him in the woods, and fix him that way, what good would it do? I'd have to stand there till the keepers come along, and they might not do that for a week or two. By that time I'd be starved to death, and so would the tiger, and they want him alive.  \"Jim must be mistaken, too, 'bout shooting off his tail. Jim and me haven't got any tails, and we don't have any trouble in walking. I can't see how it would make any difference with the tiger, either. I wonder where Jim got all them ideas,--I guess where he got the stories 'bout so many people being chawed up.\"  The lad lay for a while on one side, and then flung himself on the other. Several times he was on the point of dropping into an uneasy slumber, but some slight noise always came at the critical moment to make him wider awake than he was in the first instance.  What is more disturbing than the occasional rattle of a window sash when we are trying to woo sleep? By and by Tom discovered it was that which had played the mischief with his rest. He sprang impatiently out of bed, and hurried to the window, with the intention of righting matters.  The bright moon shining from an unclouded sky made it almost as light as day. He stood a minute, looking out upon the beautiful scene; for, young as he was, he could not fail to be impressed by the striking loveliness of everything out-doors.  \"I wonder whether they've catched Tippo Sahib\"--  The lad caught his breath, for just then he saw something moving in the shadow of the woodshed. A second look showed it to be some sort of quadruped, and the third--could he believe his eyes?--revealed the tiger himself!  Yes, it was the terrible brute and no mistake. The boy rubbed his eyes and looked again. Some unaccountable attraction seemed to have brought Tippo Sahib back to the dwelling where he had met with so interesting an experience that afternoon.  But all this being so, Tom Gordon might well ask himself what good the presence of the animal promised to be to him. Hitherto, he and his friends had counted themselves lucky in being able to keep out of his way when he showed a desire to explore the interior of the house. How, then, could he expect to get the hundred dollars offered for the capture of the brute?  Mingled with the eager wish of the lad to earn the munificent sum, was a slight misgiving as to the meaning of this return of the tiger. Having eluded the men sent after him, had he come back to revenge himself upon those who had treated him so ill?  This discomforting thought was dissipated by the action of Tippo Sahib. He did not move around as on his former visit, but seemed to be prowling about the woodshed, as if in quest of something. Surely he would not act thus if he meditated an attack upon the inmates of the home!  But Tom had learned from his aunt and mother that if the tiger chose, he could readily leap from the ground to the windows of the upper story, and, therefore, would have little difficulty in entering, if he was bent on doing so.  \"I'll get my gun, so as to be ready to shoot him. But if I shoot him, I won't get the reward that was promised; but it's better to kill him than to have him chaw us to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11978"],["title","Brave Tom; Or, The Battle That Won (#4)"],["body","ces.\"  Just then the animal worked his way round the corner of the structure, out of the shadow, into the bright moonlight. He showed no interest in the house itself, but confined his attention to the woodshed,--a fact which lessened the lad's fear, and held him at the window, closely watching the beast.  His change of location brought him to the front of the strong wooden building, and near the partially open door.  The heart of the lad gave a great bound.  \"S'pose he goes inside, and I slip up and shut him in!\"  All the indications pointed to the tiger entering the structure, though it was impossible to imagine his purpose, unless he scented the waste food kept there in a barrel for the pigs belonging to the Widow Gordon.  The attempt the lad had in mind involved a fearful risk; for there could be no doubt that if the beast detected him, he would make him serve for supper.  Probably if Tom had been given a few more minutes to think over the matter, he would have abandoned the design in his mind; but that one hundred dollars looked as big to him as a million does to most people. Hastily drawing on his trousers, he began stealthily descending the stairs. Fortunately for him, his aunt and mother were asleep, else they would have put an emphatic veto on his foolhardy scheme. The bolts of the door were softly slid back, the door itself silently drawn inward an inch or two, and the lad peeped out. His position gave a full view of the front of the woodshed, and the sight was an interesting one. The tiger had partially entered. Indeed, little was seen more than his tail, which, projecting from the darkness of the structure, swayed slowly from side to side, as if he had detected something not altogether pleasing.  \"If he goes in, I'll slip out and hook the door; but, if he comes back, it won't do to let him see me.\"  This was the thought that stirred Tom Gordon, as he peered stealthily out of the crack made by the door. Could he have thought of any way by which to drive the tiger inside, he would have done so; but there was none. He could only wait and watch, and hope for a favorable issue of the undertaking.  It struck him as strange that the beast should stand so long with only his tail in the outer air. The lad fancied it had disappeared entirely; but at the moment he was about to slip forward, he detected the tuft agitating the chips and dirt about the entrance. He therefore held back and still watched and waited.  There! the brute must have taken another step farther, for no part of his appendage was visible. He was wholly within the shed.  It was now or never.  Tom left the door open a few inches, so that if he should find it necessary to retreat, he would meet with no trouble in re-entering his home. In that event, however, it wasn't likely Tippo Sahib would meet with any trouble in following him.  The heart of the youth throbbed violently when he stepped out in the moonlight and comprehended the perilous nature of the business.  \"If he comes out tail first,\" was his thought, \"I'll have a chance to dodge him; but if he comes head first, I'll be a goner.\"  He was not idle while these imaginings were passing through his mind. Step by step, and on tiptoe, he stole forward, until he stood within a couple of paces of the fastening. Then it was that his courage almost deserted him, and the desire to turn about and make a dash for the door behind him was well-nigh irresistible.  But the thought of that magnificent hundred dollars restrained and nerved him to push on. Another step and he had but to lean forward with outstretched arm, seize the door, and snap it toward him. He was in the act of doing so, when he heard a guttural growl from within. Had this reached his ears when he was a few feet farther off, Tom would have turned and fled for life. He would have done so now but for his belief that it was too late. He could only save himself by shutting that door before the beast came through it.  Holding his breath, the lad seized the handle, and with a quick flirt drew the door toward him. The strong iron hook was slipped into the staple, and he had done all he could. Yielding then to the panic which had been struggling so long within him, he bounded upon the front porch, shot through the door, and closed and fastened it in a twinkling. Not even then did Tom feel safe, but bounded up-stairs with so much haste and noise, that the wonder was he did not awaken his aunt and mother. They slept too soundly, however, to be disturbed.  He ran to the window of his bedroom, and looked out again, fearing that the royal prisoner had already freed himself and would proceed to punish the one that had taken such liberties with him. Strange to say, everything looked as if there was no tiger within a score of miles. The door of the woodshed was fastened as it had been many times; but no noise or disturbance, so far as the lad could judge, sounded from within the structure. The prisoner seemed to have accepted his misfortune philosophically, and, perhaps, had lain down to rest himself after his stirring experiences of the afternoon.  \"I wonder if he can get out of there. It's pretty strong, and there isn't any back-door or window that he can use.\"  The youth was so deeply interested in the question that he brought his chair beside the window and sat down to await results. It was not strange, perhaps, considering the lateness of the hour, that the sleep which he had long sought in vain now came to him. By and by his head began nodding, and, despite the cramped position, he slumbered soundly until awakened by the call of his mother.  As soon as Tom could collect his senses, he looked at the woodshed. So far as he saw, no change had taken place. Then he hurried down-stairs and told the astounding tidings.  \"Mercy!\" gasped Aunt Cynthia, \"I was just about going to the shed for some wood, you were so long coming down. Suppose I had!\"  \"It would have been all over with you,\" replied Tom, hardly less startled than they; \"I meant to stay awake all night, but forgot myself.\"  \"Perhaps he has got out,\" suggested the mother; \"I don't understand why he has kept so quiet.\"  While they were talking, a call came from the roadway again. When they looked out, four horsemen were seen.  \"We find it impossible to locate that beast,\" explained the one that had done the talking the night before; \"I hardly suppose you have seen anything more of him.\"  Before Mrs. Gordon or Aunt Cynthia could reply, Tom asked,--  \"Did you say you would give a hundred dollars to any one that gets that tiger without hurting him?\"  \"We'll be glad to do that, sonny, or if he will show us where he is so we can capture him.\"  \"Will you give a hundred dollars to have him in the woodshed there?\"  \"Indeed we will.\"  \"Very well; _he's there!_\"     Chapter V.    The men looked at Tom Gordon as if doubting his words.  \"Are you in earnest?\" asked one of them.  \"Look for yourselves.\"  The horseman was out of the saddle in a twinkling, and walked quickly to the woodshed, whose cracks were so numerous that it was easy to see every part of the interior. Placing his eyes at one of these openings, he peered through.  \"By George, boys!\" he exclaimed, turning about, \"the youngster's right; Tippo is in there.\"  The others hastily dismounted, tied their horses, and joined him. All took a look before they were satisfied no mistake had been made.  The tiger was stretched out in one corner, and had been asleep, when he was awakened by the noise. He raised his head, opened his eyes and growled, but showed no special anger at being disturbed.  While the men were debating as to the best means of securing him, Jack Durrick, who had done most of the talking, explained to the ladies and Tom what must have puzzled them concerning the action of the beast.  Durrick, it should be stated, figured on the stupendous posters as \"Professor De La Cordova, Successor of the Renowned Van Amberg, and Fully his Equal in his Amazing Power and Control over the Wild Beasts of the Forest and Jungle.\" In this case, it must be added, the professor possessed fair claim to this distinction. He displayed great skill in the management of wild animals. No one could handle Tippo Sahib as did he. Had he been near the cage when Sam Harper angered him, he never would have permitted the beast to escape.  He said Tippo was frightened and nervous through his suddenly acquired freedom. He suffered pain from the jab in his eye, and was made more restless and fidgety by the excitement and his strange surroundings. The slight wound received by him renewed his anger; but, when he withdrew from the immediate vicinity, he undoubtedly made a raid on some farmer's live-stock, and had devoured a calf, pig, or sheep. He had eaten his fill, and thereupon became so docile as to be comparatively harmless, provided he was treated with consideration.  His return to the scene of his most stirring experience was one of those whims which his species sometimes show. Tired from his flight and filled to satiety, he had lain down to rest in the woodshed, so satisfied with his quarters that he offered no objection when Tom Gordon slipped up and fastened the door. So powerful and active an animal, had he chosen, could have broken out of the place in a twinkling; but he was content to stay where he was until fully rested.  \"I assure you,\" added the professor, \"you wouldn't have kept him much longer; when he awoke, hungry and thirsty, he would have placed himself on the outside before you could say Jack Robinson, and _then_ there would have been trouble.\"  The actions of the professor proved his faith in his own words. He coolly unhooked the door, gently pushed it back, and stepped within the structure. Tippo Sahib uttered a growl, and Tom and his friends shrank farther away. The men, however, one of whom carried a coil of rope, held their places.  Professor De La Cordova displayed admirable coolness and tact. He was not rough in manner, but acted like one who felt "]]]
