Yet I am shamed, messire, that Osmund Heleigh should have become the book-muddled pedant you are. For I loved young Osmund Heleigh.\"  He also had risen in the firelight, and now its convulsive shadows marred two dogged faces. \"I think it best not to recall that boy and girl who are so long dead. And, frankly, madame and Queen, the merit of the business I have in hand is questionable. It is you who have set all England by the ears, and I am guiding you toward opportunities for further mischief. I must serve you. Understand, madame, that ancient folly in Provence yonder has nothing to do with the affair. Count Manuel left you: and between his evasion and your marriage you were pleased to amuse yourself with me--\"  \"You were more civil then, my Osmund--\"  \"I am not uncivil, I merely point out that this old folly constitutes no overwhelming obligation, either way. I cry _nihil ad Andromachen!_ For the rest, I must serve you because you are a woman and helpless; yet I cannot forget that he who spares the wolf is the sheep's murderer. It would be better for all England if you were dead. Hey, your gorgeous follies, madame! Silver peacocks set with sapphires! Cloth of fine gold--\"  \"Would you have me go unclothed?\" Dame Alianora demanded, pettishly.  \"Not so,\" Osmund retorted; \"again I say to you with Tertullian, 'Let women paint their eyes with the tints of chastity, insert into their ears the Word of God, tie the yoke of Christ about their necks, and adorn their whole person with the silk of sanctity and the damask of devotion.' I say to you that the boy you wish to rescue from Wallingford, and make King of England, is freely rumored to be not verily the son of Sire Henry but the child of tall Manuel of Poictesme. I say to you that from the first you have made mischief in England. And I say to you--\"  But Dame Alianora was yawning quite frankly. \"You will say to me that I brought foreigners into England, that I misguided the King, that I stirred up strife between the King and his barons. Eh, my God! I am sufficiently familiar with the harangue. Yet listen, my Osmund: They sold me like a bullock to a man I had never seen. I found him a man of wax, and I remoulded him. They asked of me an heir for England: I provided that heir. They gave me England as a toy; I played with it. I was the Queen, the source of honor, the source of wealth--the trough, in effect, about which swine gathered. Never since I came into England, Osmund, has any man or woman loved me; never in all my English life have I loved man or woman. Do you understand, my Osmund?--the Queen has many flatterers, but no friends. Not a friend in the world, my Osmund! And so the Queen made the best of it and amused herself.\"  Somewhat he seemed to understand, for he answered without asperity:  \"Mon bel esper, I do not find it anywhere in Holy Writ that God requires it of us to amuse ourselves; but upon many occasions we have been commanded to live righteously. We are tempted in divers and insidious ways. And we cry with the Psalmist, 'My strength is dried up like a potsherd.' But God intends this, since, until we have here demonstrated our valor upon Satan, we are manifestly unworthy to be enregistered in God's army. The great Captain must be served by proven soldiers. We may be tempted, but we may not yield. O daughter of the South! we must not yield!\"  \"Again you preach,\" Dame Alianora said. \"That is a venerable truism.\"  \"Ho, madame,\" he returned, \"is it on that account the less true?\"  Pensively the Queen considered this. \"You are a good man, my Osmund,\" she said, at last, \"though you are very droll. Ohimé! it is a pity that I was born a princess! Had it been possible for me to be your wife, I would have been a better woman. I shall sleep now and dream of that good and stupid and contented woman I might have been.\" So presently these two slept in Chantrell Wood.  Followed four days of journeying. As Messer Dante had not yet surveyed Malebolge, Osmund Heleigh and Dame Alianora lacked a parallel for that which they encountered; their traverse discovered England razed, charred, and depopulate--picked bones of an island, a vast and absolute ruin about which passion-wasted men skulked like rats. Messire Heleigh and the Queen traveled without molestation; malice and death had journeyed before them on this road, and had swept it clear.  At every trace of these hideous precessors Osmund Heleigh would say, \"By a day's ride I might have prevented this.\" Or, \"By a day's ride I might have saved this woman.\" Or, \"By two days' riding I might have fed this child.\"  The Queen kept Spartan silence, but daily you saw the fine woman age. In their slow advance every inch of misery was thrust before her for inspection; meticulously she observed and evaluated her handiwork. Enthroned, she had appraised from a distance the righteous wars she set afoot; trudging thus among the débris of these wars, she found they had unsuspected aspects. Bastling the royal army had recently sacked. There remained of this village the skeletons of two houses, and for the rest a jumble of bricks, rafters half-burned, many calcined fragments of humanity, and ashes. At Bastling, Messire Heleigh turned to the Queen toiling behind.  \"Oh, madame!\" he said, in a dry whisper, \"this was the home of so many men!\"  \"I burned it,\" Dame Alianora replied. \"That man we passed just now I killed. Those other men and women--my folly slew them all. And little children, my Osmund! The hair like flax, blood-dabbled!\"  \"Oh, madame!\" he wailed, in the extremity of his pity.  For she stood with eyes shut, all gray. The Queen demanded: \"Why have they not slain me? Was there no man in England to strangle the proud wanton? Are you all cowards here?\"  He said: \"I detect only one coward in the affair. Your men and Leicester's men also ride about the world, and draw sword and slay and die for the right as they see it. And you and Leicester contend for the right as ye see it. But I, madame! I! I, who sat snug at home spilling ink and trimming rose-bushes! God's world, madame, and I in it afraid to speak a word for Him! God's world, and a curmudgeon in it grudging God the life He gave!\" The man flung out his soft hands and snarled: _\"We are tempted in divers and insidious ways._ But I, who rebuked you! behold, now, with how gross a snare was I entrapped!\" \"I do not understand, my Osmund.\"  \"I was afraid, madame,\" he returned, dully. \"Everywhere men fight, and I am afraid to die.\"  So they stood silent in the ruins of Bastling.  \"Of a piece with our lives,\" Dame Alianora said at last. \"All ruin, my Osmund.\"  But Messire Heleigh threw back his head and laughed, new color in his face. \"Presently men will build here, my Queen. Presently, as in legend was re-born the Arabian bird, arises from these ashes a lordlier and more spacious town.\"  They went forward. The next day chance loosed upon them Gui Camoys, lord of Bozon, Foliot, and Thwenge, who, riding alone through Poges Copse, found there a man and a woman over their limited supper. The woman had thrown back her hood, and Camoys drew rein to stare at her. Lispingly he spoke the true court dialect.  \"Ma belle,\" said this Camoys, in friendly condescension, \"n'estez vous pas jongleurs?\"  Dame Alianora smiled up at him. \"Ouais, messire; mon mary faict les chançons--\" She paused, with dilatory caution, for Camoys had leaped from his horse, giving a great laugh.  \"A prize! ho, an imperial prize!\" Camoys shouted. \"A peasant woman with the Queen's face, who speaks French! And who, madame, is this? Have you by any chance brought pious Lewis from oversea? Have I bagged a brace of monarchs?\"  Here was imminent danger, for Camoys had known the Queen some fifteen years. Messire Heleigh rose, his five days' beard glinting like hoar-frost as his mouth twitched.  \"I am Osmund Heleigh, messire, younger brother to the Earl of Brudenel.\"  \"I have heard of you, I believe--the fellow who spoils parchment. This is odd company, however, Messire Osmund, for Brudenel's brother.\"  \"A gentleman must serve his Queen, messire. As Cicero very justly observes--\"  \"I am inclined to think that his political opinions are scarcely to our immediate purpose. This is a high matter, Messire Heleigh. To let the sorceress pass is, of course, out of the question; upon the other hand, I observe that you lack weapons of defence. Yet if you will have the kindness to assist me in unarming, your courtesy will place our commerce on more equal footing.\"  Osmund had turned very white. \"I am no swordsman, messire--\"  \"Now, this is not handsome of you,\" Camoys began. \"I warn you that people will speak harshly of us if we lose this opportunity of gaining honor. And besides, the woman will be burned at the stake. Plainly, you owe it to all three of us to fight.\"  \"--But I refer my cause to God. I am quite at your service.\" \"No, my Osmund!\" Dame Alianora then cried. \"It means your death.\"  He spread out his hands. \"That is God's affair, madame.\"  \"Are you not afraid?\" she breathed.  \"Of course I am afraid,\" said Messire Heleigh, irritably.  After that he unarmed Camoys, and presently they faced each other in their tunics. So for the first time in the journey Osmund's long falchion saw daylight. He had thrown away his dagger, as Camoys had none.  The combat was sufficiently curious. Camoys raised his left hand. \"So help me God and His saints, I have upon me neither bone, stone, nor witchcraft wherethrough the power and the word of God might be diminished or the devil's power increased.\"  Osmund made similar oath. \"Judge Thou this woman's cause!\" he cried, likewise.  Then Gui Camoys shouted, as a herald might have done, \"Laissez les aller, laissez les aller, laissez les aller, les bons combatants!\" and warily each moved toward the other.  On a sudden Osmund attacked, desperately apprehensive of his own cowardice. Camoys lightly eluded him and slashed at Osmund's undefended thigh, drawing much blood. Osmund gasped."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11752"],["title","Chivalry: Dizain des Reines (#5)"],["body"," He flung away his sword, and in the instant catching Camoys under the arms, threw him to the ground. Messire Heleigh fell with his opponent, who in stumbling had lost his sword, and thus the two struggled unarmed, Osmund atop. But Camoys was the younger man, and Osmund's strength was ebbing rapidly by reason of his wound. Now Camoys' tethered horse, rearing with nervousness, tumbled his master's flat-topped helmet into the road. Osmund caught up this helmet and with it battered Camoys in the face, dealing severe blows.  \"God!\" Camoys cried, his face all blood.  \"Do you acknowledge my quarrel just?\" said Osmund, between horrid sobs.  \"What choice have I?\" said Gui Camoys, very sensibly.  So Osmund rose, blind with tears and shivering. The Queen bound up their wounds as best she might, but Camoys was much dissatisfied.  \"For private purposes of His own, madame,\" he observed, \"and doubtless for sufficient reasons, God has singularly favored your cause. I am neither a fool nor a pagan to question His decision, and you two may go your way unhampered. But I have had my head broken with my own helmet, and this I consider to be a proceeding very little conducive toward enhancing my reputation. Of your courtesy, messire, I must entreat another meeting.\"  Osmund shrank as if from a blow. Then, with a short laugh, he conceded that this was Camoys' right, and they fixed upon the following Saturday, with Poges Copse as the rendezvous.  \"I would suggest that the combat be to the death,\" Gui Camoys said, \"in consideration of the fact it was my own helmet. You must undoubtedly be aware, Messire Osmund, that such an affront is practically without any parallel.\"  This, too, was agreed upon.  Then, after asking if they needed money, which was courteously declined, Gui Camoys rode away, and sang as he went. Osmund Heleigh remained motionless. He raised quivering hands to the sky.  \"Thou hast judged!\" he cried. \"Thou hast judged, O puissant Emperor of Heaven! Now pardon! Pardon us twain! Pardon for unjust stewards of Thy gifts! Thou hast loaned this woman dominion over England, with all instruments to aid Thy cause, and this trust she has abused. Thou hast loaned me life and manhood, agility and wit and strength, all instruments to aid Thy cause. Talents in a napkin, O God! Repentant we cry to Thee. Pardon for unjust stewards! Pardon for the ungirt loin, for the service shirked, for all good deeds undone! Pardon and grace, O King of kings!\"  Thus he prayed, while Gui Camoys sang, riding deeper into the tattered, yellowing forest. By an odd chance Camoys had lighted on that song made by Thibaut of Champagne, beginning _Signor, saciez, ki or ne s'en ira_, which denounces all half-hearted servitors of Heaven; and this he sang with a lilt gayer than his matter countenanced. Faintly there now came to Osmund and the Queen the sound of Camoys' singing, and they found it, in the circumstances, ominously apt.  Sang Camoys:    \"Et vos, par qui je n'ci onques aïe,   Descendez luit en infer le parfont.\"  Dame Alianora shivered. But she was a capable woman, and so she said: \"I may have made mistakes. But I am sure I never meant any harm, and I am sure, too, that God will be more sensible about it than are you poets.\"  They slept that night in Ousley Meadow, and the next afternoon came safely to Bristol. You may learn elsewhere with what rejoicing the royal army welcomed the Queen's arrival, how courage quickened at sight of the generous virago. In the ebullition Messire Heleigh was submerged, and Dame Alianora saw nothing more of him that day. Friday there were counsels, requisitions, orders signed, a memorial despatched to Pope Urban, chief of all a letter (this in the Queen's hand throughout) privily conveyed to the Lady Maude de Mortemer, who shortly afterward contrived Prince Edward's escape from her husband's gaolership. There was much sowing of a seed, in fine, that eventually flowered victory. There was, however, no sign of Osmund Heleigh, though by Dame Alianora's order he was sought.  On Saturday at seven in the morning he came to her lodging, in complete armor. From the open helmet his wrinkled face, showing like a wizened nut in a shell, smiled upon her questionings.  \"I go to fight Gui Camoys, madame and Queen.\"  Dame Alianora wrung her hands. \"You go to your death.\"  He answered: \"That is true. Therefore I am come to bid you farewell.\"  The Queen stared at him for a while; on a sudden she broke into a curious fit of deep but tearless sobbing, which bordered upon laughter, too.  \"Mon bel esper,\" said Osmund Heleigh, gently, \"what is there in all this worthy of your sorrow? The man will kill me; granted, for he is my junior by some fifteen years, and is in addition a skilled swordsman. I fail to see that this is lamentable. Back to Longaville I cannot go after recent happenings; there a rope's end awaits me. Here I must in any event shortly take to the sword, since a beleaguered army has very little need of ink-pots; and shortly I must be slain in some skirmish, dug under the ribs perhaps by a greasy fellow I have never seen. I prefer a clean death at a gentleman's hands.\"  \"It is I who bring about your death!\" she said. \"You gave me gallant service, and I have requited you with death, and it is a great pity.\"  \"Indeed the debt is on the other side. The trivial services I rendered you were such as any gentleman must render a woman in distress. Naught else have I afforded you, madame, save very anciently a Sestina. Ho, a Sestina! And in return you have given me a Sestina of fairer make,--a Sestina of days, six days of manly common living.\" His eyes were fervent.  She kissed him on either cheek. \"Farewell, my champion!\"  \"Ay, your champion. In the twilight of life old Osmund Heleigh rides forth to defend the quarrel of Alianora of Provence. Reign wisely, my Queen, so that hereafter men may not say I was slain in an evil cause. Do not, I pray you, shame my maiden venture at a man's work.\"  \"I will not shame you,\" the Queen proudly said; and then, with a change of voice: \"O my Osmund! My Osmund, you have a folly that is divine, and I lack it.\"  He caught her by each wrist, and stood crushing both her hands to his lips, with fierce staring. \"Wife of my King! wife of my King!\" he babbled; and then put her from him, crying, \"I have not failed you! Praise God, I have not failed you!\"  From her window she saw him ride away, a rich flush of glitter and color. In new armor with a smart emblazoned surcoat the lean pedant sat conspicuously erect; and as he went he sang defiantly, taunting the weakness of his flesh.  Sang Osmund Heleigh:    \"Love sows, but lovers reap; and ye will see   The loved eyes lighten, feel the loved lips cling   Never again when in the grave ye be   Incurious of your happiness in spring,   And get no grace of Love, there, whither he   That bartered life for love no love may bring.\"  So he rode away and thus out of our history. But in the evening Gui Camoys came into Bristol under a flag of truce, and behind him heaved a litter wherein lay Osmund Heleigh's body.  \"For this man was frank and courteous,\" Camoys said to the Queen, \"and in the matter of the reparation he owed me acted very handsomely. It is fitting that he should have honorable interment.\"  \"That he shall not lack,\" the Queen said, and gently unclasped from Osmund's wrinkled neck the thin gold chain, now locketless. \"There was a portrait here,\" she said; \"the portrait of a woman whom he loved in his youth, Messire Camoys. And all his life it lay above his heart.\"  Camoys answered stiffly: \"I imagine this same locket to have been the object which Messire Heleigh flung into the river, shortly before we began our combat. I do not rob the dead, madame.\"  \"Well,\" the Queen said, \"he always did queer things, and so, I shall always wonder what sort of lady he picked out to love, but it is none of my affair.\"  Afterward she set to work on requisitions in the King's name. But Osmund Heleigh she had interred at Ambresbury, commanding it to be written on his tomb that he died in the Queen's cause.  How the same cause prospered (Nicolas concludes), how presently Dame Alianora reigned again in England and with what wisdom, and how in the end this great Queen died a nun at Ambresbury and all England wept therefor--this you may learn elsewhere. I have chosen to record six days of a long and eventful life; and (as Messire Heleigh might have done) I say modestly with him of old, _Majores majora sonent._ Nevertheless, I assert that many a forest was once a pocketful of acorns.

Before this he had lodged for three months in the district of Ponthieu; and the object of his southern journey was to assure the tenth Alphonso, then ruling in Castile, that the latter's sister Ellinor, now resident at Entréchat, was beyond any reasonable doubt the transcendent lady whose existence old romancers had anticipated, however cloudily, when they fabled in remote time concerning Queen Heleine of Sparta.  There was a postscript to this news. The world knew that the King of Leon and Castile desired to be King of Germany as well, and that at present a single vote in the Diet would decide between his claims and those of his competitor, Earl Richard of Cornwall. De Gâtinais chaffered fairly; he had a vote, Alphonso had a sister. So that, in effect--ohé, in effect, he made no question"]]]
