In order however to make some amends for the loss, Isis   consecrated the Phallus made in imitation of it, and instituted a   solemn festival to its memory, which is even, to this day observed by   the Egyptians.    \"After these things, Osiris returning from the other world, appeared   to his son Orus, encouraged him to the battle, and at the same time   instructed him in the exercise of arms. He then asked him, 'what he   thought was the moat glorious action a man could perform?' to which   Orua replied, 'to revenge the injuries offered to his father and   mother.' He then asked him, 'what animal he thought most serviceable   to a soldier?' and being answered 'a horse'; this raised the wonder of   Osiris, so that he farther questioned him, 'why he preferred a horse   before a lion?' because, adds Orus, 'tho' the lion be the more   serviceable creature to one who stands in need of help, yet is the   horse [Footnote: The horse does not appear to have been known in Egypt   before the XVIIIth dynasty; this portion of Plutarch's version of the   history of Osiris must, then, be later than B.C. 1500.] more useful in   overtaking and cutting off a flying adversary.' These replies much   rejoiced Osiris, as they showed him that his son was sufficiently   prepared for his enemy--We are moreover told, that among the great   numbers who were continually deserting from Typho's party was his   concubine Thueris, and that a serpent pursuing her as she was coming   over to Orus, was slain by her soldiers--the memory of which action,   say they, is still preserved in that cord which is thrown into the   midst of their assemblies, and then chopt into pieces--Afterwards it   came to a battle between, them which lasted many days; but victory at   length inclined to Orus, Typho himself being taken prisoner. Isis   however, to whose custody he was committed, was so far from putting   him to death, that she even loosed his bonds and set him at liberty.   This action of his mother so extremely incensed Orus, that he laid   hands upon her, and pulled off the ensign of royalty which she wore on   her head; and instead thereof Hermes clapt on an helmet made in the   shape of an oxe's head--After this, Typho publicly accused Orus of   bastardy; but by the assistance of Hermes (Thoth) his legitimacy was   fully established by the judgment of the Gods themselves--After this;   there were two other battles fought between them, in both of which   Typho had the worst. Furthermore, Isis is said to have accompanied   with Osiris after his death, and in consequence hereof to have brought   forth Harpocrates, who came into the world before his time, and lame   in his lower limbs.\"  When we examine this story by the light of the results of hieroglyphic decipherment, we find that a large portion of it is substantiated by Egyptian texts: _e.g._, Osiris was the son of Seb and Nut; the Epact is known in the Calendars as \"the five additional days of the year\"; the five gods, Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys, were born on the days mentioned by Plutarch; the 17th day of Athyr (Hathor) is marked as triply unlucky in the Calendars; the wanderings and troubles of Isis are described, and \"lamentations\" which she is supposed to have uttered are found in the texts; lists of the shrines of Osiris are preserved in several inscriptions; the avenging of his father by Horus is referred to frequently in papyri and other documents; the conflict between Set and Horus is described fully in a papyrus in the British Museum (No. 10,184); a hymn in the papyrus of Hunefer relates all that Thoth performed for Osiris; and the begetting of Horus by Osiris after death is mentioned in a hymn to Osiris dating from the XVIIIth dynasty in the following passage:--    \"Thy sister put forth her protecting power for thee, she scattered   abroad those who were her enemies, she drove away evil hap, she   pronounced mighty words of power, she made cunning her tongue, and her   words failed not. The glorious Isis was perfect in command and in   speech, and she avenged her brother. She sought him without ceasing,   she wandered round and round the earth uttering cries of pain, and she   rested (_or_ alighted) not until she had found him. She overshadowed   him with her feathers, she made air (_or_ wind) with her wings, and   she uttered cries at the burial of her brother. She raised up the   prostrate form of him whose heart was still, she took from him of his   essence, she conceived and brought forth a child, she suckled it in   secret, and none knew the place thereof; and the arm of the child hath   waxed strong in the great house of Seb. The company of the gods   rejoice, and are glad at the coming of Osiris's son Horus, and firm of   heart and triumphant is the son of Isis, the heir of Osiris.\"   [Footnote: This remarkable hymn was first made known by Chabas, who   published a translation of it, with notes, in _Revue Archéologique_,   Paris, 1857, t. xiv. p. 65 ff.]  [Illustration: 1.

There is, however, good reason for assuming that in the earliest dynastic times he occupied the position of god and judge of those who had risen from the dead by his help, for already in the IVth dynasty, about B.C. 3800, king Mea-kau-R[=a] (the Mycerinus of the Greeks) is identified with him, and on his coffin not only is he called \"Osiris, King of the South and North, Men-kau-R[=a], living for ever,\" but the genealogy of Osiris is attributed to him, and he is declared to be \"born of heaven, offspring of Nut, flesh and bone of Seb.\" It is evident that the priests of Heliopolis \"edited\" the religious texts copied and multiplied in the College to suit their own views, but in the early times when they began their work, the worship of Osiris was so widespread, and the belief in him as the god of the resurrection so deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Egyptians, that even in the Heliopolitan system of theology Osiris and his cycle, or company of gods, were made to hold a very prominent position. He represented to men the idea of a man who was both god and man, and he typified to the Egyptians in all ages the being who by reason of his sufferings and death as a man could sympathize with them in their own sickness and death. The idea of his human personality also satisfied their cravings and yearnings for intercourse with a being who, though he was partly divine, yet had much in common with themselves. Originally they looked upon Osiris as a man who lived on the earth as they lived, who ate and drank, who suffered a cruel death, who by the help of certain gods triumphed over death, and attained unto everlasting life. But what Osiris did they could do, and what the gods did for Osiris they must also do for them, and as the gods brought about his resurrection so they must bring about theirs, and as they made him the ruler of the underworld so they must make them to enter his kingdom and to live there as long as the god himself lived. Osiris, in some of his aspects, was identified with the Nile, and with R[=a], and with several other \"gods\" known to the Egyptians, but it was in his aspect as god of the resurrection and of eternal life that he appealed to men in the valley of the Nile; and for thousands of years men and women died believing that, inasmuch as all that was done for Osiris would be done for them symbolically, they like him would rise again, and inherit life everlasting. However far back we trace religious ideas in Egypt, we never approach a time when it can be said that there did not exist a belief in the Resurrection, for everywhere it is assumed that Osiris rose from the dead; sceptics must have existed, and they probably asked their priests what the Corinthians asked Saint Paul, \"How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?\" But beyond doubt the belief in the Resurrection was accepted by the dominant classes in Egypt. The ceremonies which the Egyptians performed with the view of assisting the deceased to pass the ordeal of the judgment, and to overcome his enemies in the next world, will be described elsewhere, as also will be the form in which the dead were raised up; we therefore return to the theological history of Osiris.  The centre and home of the worship of Osiris in Egypt under the early dynasties was Abydos, where the head of the god was said to be buried. It spread north and south in the course of time, and several large cities claimed to possess one or other of the limbs of his body. The various episodes in the life of the god were made the subject of solemn representations in the temple, and little by little the performance of the obligatory and non-obligatory services in connection with them occupied, in certain temples, the greater part of the time of the priests. The original ideas concerning the god were forgotten and new ones grew up; from being the _example_ of a man who had risen from the dead and had attained unto life everlasting, he became the _cause_ of the resurrection of the dead; and the power to bestow eternal life upon mortals was transferred from the gods to him. The alleged dismemberment of Osiris was forgotten in the fact that he dwelt in a perfect body in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11278"],["title","Folk-Tales of Napoleon (#0)"],["body","FOLK-TALES OF NAPOLEON  NAPOLEONDER   From the Russian  THE NAPOLEON OF THE PEOPLE   From the French of Honoré de Balzac   Translated With Introduction By GEORGE KENNAN   1902   CONTENTS  NAPOLEONDER THE NAPOLEON OF THE PEOPLE     INTRODUCTION  Most of the literature that has its origin in the life and career of a great man may be grouped and classified under two heads: history and biography. The part that relates to the man's actions, and to the influence that such actions have had in shaping the destinies of peoples and states, belongs in the one class; while the part that derives its interest mainly from the man's personality, and deals chiefly with the mental and moral characteristics of which his actions were the outcome, goes properly into the other. The value of the literature included in these two classes depends almost wholly upon truth; that is, upon the precise correspondence of the statements made with the real facts of the man's life and career. History is worse than useless if it does not accurately chronicle and describe events; and biography is valueless and misleading if it does not truly set forth individual character.  There is, however, a kind of great-man literature in which truth is comparatively unimportant, and that is the literature of popular legend and tradition. Whether it purports to be historical or biographical, or both, it derives its interest and value from the light that it throws upon the temperament and character of the people who originate it, rather than from the amount of truth contained in the statements that it makes about the man.  The folk-tales of Napoleon Bonaparte herewith presented, if judged from the viewpoint of the historian or the biographer, are absurdly and grotesquely untrue; but to the anthropologist and the student of human nature they are extremely valuable as self-revelations of national character; and even to the historian and the biographer they have some interest as evidences of the profoundly deep impression made by Napoleon's personality upon two great peoples--the Russians and the French.  The first story, which is entitled \"Napoleonder,\" is of Russian origin, and was put into literary form, or edited, by Alexander Amphiteatrof of St. Petersburg. It originally appeared as a feuilleton in the St. Petersburg \"Gazette\" of December 13, 1901. As a characteristic specimen of Russian peasant folk-lore, it seems to me to have more than ordinary interest and value. The treatment of the supernatural may seem, to Occidental readers, rather daring and irreverent, but it is perfectly in harmony with the Russian peasant's anthropomorphic conception of Deity, and should be taken with due allowance for the educational limitations of the story-teller and his auditors. The Russian muzhik often brings God and the angels into his folk-tales, and does so without the least idea of treating them disrespectfully. He makes them talk in his own language because he has no other language; and if the talk seems a little grotesque and irreverent, it is due to the low level of the narrator's literary culture, and not to any intention, on his part, of treating God and the angels with levity. The whole aim of the story is a moral and religious one. The narrator is trying to show that sympathy and mercy are better than selfish ambition, and that war is not only immoral but irrational. The conversation between God, the angels, and the Devil is a mere prologue, intended to bring Napoleon and Ivan-angel on the stage and lay the foundation of the plot. The story-teller's keen sense of fun and humor is shown in many little touches, but he never means to be irreverent. The whole legend is set forth in the racy, idiomatic, highly elliptical language of the common Russian muzhik, and is therefore extremely difficult of translation; but I have tried to preserve, as far as possible, the spirit and flavor of the original.  The French story was first reduced to writing--or at least put into literary form--by Honoré de Balzac, and appeared under the title of \"The Napoleon of the People\" in the third chapter of Balzac's \"Country Doctor.\" It purports to be the story of Napoleon's life and career as related to a group of French peasants by one of his old soldiers--a man named Goguelat. It covers more time chronologically than the Russian story does, and deals much more fully and circumstantially with historical incidents and events: but it seems to me to be distinctly inferior to the Russian tale in power of creative imagination, unity of conception, skill of artistic treatment, and depth of human interest. The French peasant regards Napoleon merely as a great leader and conqueror, \"created to be the father of soldiers,\" and aided, if not directly sent, by God, to show forth the power and the glory of France. The Russian peasant, more thoughtful by nature as well as less excitable and combative in temperament, admits that Napoleon was sent on earth by God, but connects him with one of the deep problems of life by using him to show the divine nature of sympathy and pity, and the cruelty, immorality, and unreasonableness of aggressive war. The only feature that the two tales have in common is the recognition of the supernatural as a controlling factor in Napoleon's life. The French peasant believes that he had a guiding star; that he was advised and directed by a familiar spirit in the shape of a \"Red Man\"; and that he was saved from dangers and death by virtue of a secret compact with the Supreme Being. The Russian peasant asserts that he was created by the Devil, and that God, after having given him a soul by accident, first used him as a means of punishing the Russian people for their sins, and then made him really a man by inspiring him with the human feelings of sympathy and compassion. In the French story Napoleon appears as a great military leader, whose life and career reflect honor and glory upon France. In the Russian story he is merely the leading actor in a sort of moral drama, or historical mystery-play, intended to show the divine nature of sympathy and compassion, the immorality of war, and the essential solidarity and brotherhood of all mankind.

The final syllable \"der\" has perhaps been added because to the ear of the peasant \"Napoleon\" sounds clipped and incomplete, as \"Alexan\" would sound to us without the \"der.\"]  Long ago--but not so very long ago; our grandfathers remember it--the Lord God wanted to punish the people of the world for their wickedness. So he began to think how and by what means he could punish them, and he called a council of his angels and archangels to talk about it. Says the archangel Michael to the Lord God: \"Shake them up, the recreants, with an earthquake.\"  \"We've tried that,\" says the Lord God. \"Once upon a time we jolted to pieces Sodom and Gomorrah, but it didn't teach them anything. Since then pretty much all the towns have become Sodoms and Gomorrahs.\"  \"How about famine?\" says the archangel Gabriel.  \"It would be too bad for the babies,\" replies the Lord God. \"Famine would kill the babies. And, besides that, the cattle must have food--they're not to blame.\"  \"Drown them with a flood,\" suggests Raphael.  \"Clean impossible!\" says the Lord God. \"Because, in the first place, I took an oath once that there should be no more floods, and I set the rainbow in the sky for an assurance. In the second place, the rascally sinners have become cunning; they'll get on steamboats and sail all over the flood.\"  Then all the archangels were perplexed, and began to screw about in their seats, trying to invent or think of some calamity that would bring the wicked human race to its senses and stir up its conscience. But they had been accustomed, time out of mind, to do good rather than evil; they had forgotten all about the wickedness of the world; and they couldn't think of a single thing that would be of any use.  Then suddenly up comes Ivan-angel, a simple-minded soul whom the Lord God had appointed to look after the Russian muzhiks. He comes up and reports: \"Lord, Satan is outside there, asking for you. He doesn't dare to come in, because he smells bad [Footnote 2: That is, he brings with him the sulphurous odor of hell.]; so he's waiting in the entry.\"  Then the Lord God was rejoiced. \"Call Satan in!\" he ordered. \"I know that rogue perfectly well, and he has come in the very nick of time. A scamp like that will be sure to think of something.\"  Satan came in. His face was as black as tanned calfskin, his voice was hoarse, and a long tail hung down from under his overcoat.  \"If you so order,\" he says, \"I'll distribute your calamities for you with my own hands.\"  \"Go ahead with your distribution,\" says the Lord God; \"nobody shall hinder you.\"  \"Will you permit me,\" Satan says, \"to bring about an invasion of foreigners?\"  The Lord God shook his finger at Satan and cried: \"Is that all you can think of? And you so wise!\"  \"Excuse me,\" Satan says. \"Why doesn't my plan show wisdom?\"  \"Because,\" replies the Lord God, \"you propose to afflict the people with war, and war is just what they want. They're all the time fighting among themselves, one people with another, and that's the very thing I want to punish them for.\"  \"Yes,\" says Satan, \"they re greedy for war, but that's only because they have never yet seen a real warrior. Send them a regular conqueror, and they'll soon drop their tails between their legs and cry, 'Have mercy, Lord! Save us from the man of blood!'\"  The Lord God was surprised. \"Why do you say, my little brother, that the people have never seen a real warrior? The Tsar Herod was a conqueror; the Tsar Alexander subdued a wonderful lot of people; Ivan-Tsar destroyed Kazan; Mamai-Tsar the furious came with all his hordes; and the Tsar Peter, and the great fighter Anika--how many more conquerors do you want?\"  \"I want"]]]
