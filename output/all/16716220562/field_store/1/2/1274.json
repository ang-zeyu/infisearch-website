Because pockets have been used by men to carry tobacco, pipes, whiskey flasks, chewing gum and compromising letters. We see no reason to suppose that women would use them more wisely.     Fashion Notes: Past and Present   1880--Anti-suffrage arguments are being worn long, calm and flowing this year, with the dominant note that of woman's intellectual inferiority.  1890--Violence is very evident in this season's modes, and our more conservative thinkers are saying that woman suffrage threatens the home, the Church and the Republic.  1900--A complete change of style has taken place. Everything is being worn _a l'aristocrate_, with the repeated assertion that too many people are voting already.  1915--The best line of goods shown by the leading anti-suffrage houses this spring is the statement that woman suffrage is the same thing as free love. The effect is extremely piquant and surprising.     Why We Oppose Women Travelling in Railway Trains   1. Because travelling in trains is not a natural right.  2. Because our great-grandmothers never asked to travel in trains.  3. Because woman's place is the home, not the train.  4. Because it is unnecessary; there is no point reached by a train that cannot be reached on foot.  5. Because it will double the work of conductors, engineers and brakemen who are already overburdened.  6. Because men smoke and play cards in trains. Is there any reason to believe that women will behave better?     Why We Oppose Schools for Children   (_By the Children's Anti-School League_.)  1. Because education is a burden, not a right.  2. Because not one-tenth of one per cent. of the children of this country have demanded education.  3. Because if we are educated we should have to behave as if we were and we don't want to.  4. Because it is essentially against the nature of a child to be educated.  5. Because we can't see that it has done so much for grown-ups, and there is no reason for thinking it will make children perfect.  6. Because the time of children is already sufficiently occupied without going to school.  7. Because it would make dissension between parent and child. Imagine the home life of a parent who turned out to be more ignorant than his (or her) child?  8. Because we believe in the indirect education of the theatre, the baseball field and the moving picture. We believe that schools would in a great measure deprive us of this.  9. Because our parents went to school. They love us, they take care of us, they tell us what to do. We are content that they should be educated for us.     But Then Who Cares for Figures   An argument sometimes used against paying women as highly as men for the same work is that women are only temporarily in industry.  Forty-four per cent of the women teachers in the public schools of New York have been more than ten years in the service, while only twenty-six per cent of the men teachers have served as long.         *       *       *       *       *  The Bundesrath of Germany has decided to furnish medical and financial assistance to women at the time of childbirth, in order \"to alleviate the anxiety of husbands at the front.\"  How strange this would sound: \"The Bundesrath has decided to furnish medical assistance to the wounded at the front, in order to alleviate the anxiety of wives and mothers at home.\"  When a benefit is suggested for men, the question asked is: \"Will it benefit men?\"  When a benefit is suggested for women, the question is: \"Will it benefit men?\"     Why We Oppose Votes for Men   1. Because man's place is the armory.  2. Because no really manly man wants to settle any question otherwise than by fighting about it.  3. Because if men should adopt peaceable methods women will no longer look up to them.  4. Because men will lose their charm if they step out of their natural sphere and interest themselves in other matters than feats of arms, uniforms and drums.  5. Because men are too emotional to vote. Their conduct at baseball games and political conventions shows this, while their innate tendency to appeal to force renders them peculiarly unfit for the task of government.     The Logic of the Law   In 1875 the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in denying the petition of women to practise before it said:  \"It would be shocking to man's reverence for womanhood and faith in woman ... that woman should be permitted to mix professionally in all the nastiness which finds its way into courts of justice.\"  It then names thirteen subjects as unfit for the attention of women--three of them are crimes committed against women.     Consistency   (\"Vile insults, lewd talk and brutal conduct were used by the indicted men to frighten respectable women who went to the polls in Terre Haute at the last election, asserted District Attorney Dailey.\"--_Press Dispatch_.)  Are the polls unfit for decent women?  No, sir, they are perfectly orderly.  Tut, tut! Go there at once and swear and be brutal, or what will become of our anti-suffrage argument?     Sometimes We're Ivy, and Sometimes We're Oak   Is it true that the English government is calling on women to do work abandoned by men?  Yes, it is true.  Is not woman's place the home?  No, not when men need her services outside the home.  Will she never be told again that her place is the home?  Oh, yes, indeed.  When?  As soon as men want their jobs back again.     Do You Know   That in 1869 Miss Jex-Blake and four other women entered for a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh?  That the president of the College of Physicians refused to give the women the prizes they had won?  That the undergraduates insulted any professor who allowed women to compete for prizes?  That the women were stoned in the streets, and finally excluded from the medical school?  That in 1877 the British Medical Association declared women ineligible for membership?  That in 1881 the International Medical Congress excluded women from all but its \"social and ceremonial meetings\"?  That the Obstetrical Society refused to allow a woman's name to appear on the title page of a pamphlet which she had written with her husband?  That according to a recent dispatch from London, many hospitals, since the outbreak of hostilities, have asked women to become resident physicians, and public authorities are daily endeavoring to obtain women as assistant medical officers and as school doctors?     Interviews With Celebrated Anti-Suffragists   \"Woman's place is in my home.\"--Appius Claudius.  \"I have never felt the need of the ballot.\"--Cleopatra.  \"Magna Charta merely fashionable fad of ye Barons.\"--King John.  \"Boston Tea Party shows American colonists to be hysterical and utterly incapable of self-government.\"--George III.  \"Know of no really good slaves who desire emancipation.\"--President of the United Slaveholders' Protective Association.     Another of Those Curious Coincidences   On February 15, the House of Representatives passed a bill making it unlawful to ship in interstate commerce the products of a mill, cannery or factory which have been produced by the labor of children under fourteen years.  Forty-three gentlemen voted against it.  Forty-one of those forty-three had also voted against the woman suffrage bill.  Not one single vote was cast against it by a representative from any state where women vote for Congressmen.     The New Freedom   \"The Michigan commission on industrial relations has discovered,\" says \"The Detroit Journal,\" \"that thousands of wives support their husbands.\"  Woman's place is the home, but under a special privilege she is sometimes allowed to send her wages as a substitute.     To the Great Dining Out Majority   The New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage is sending out leaflets to its members urging them to \"tell every man you meet, your tailor, your postman, your grocer, as well as your _dinner partner_, that you are opposed to woman suffrage.\"  We hope that the 90,000 sewing machine operatives, the 40,000 saleswomen, the 32,000 laundry operatives, the 20,000 knitting and silk mill girls, the 17,000 women janitors and cleaners, the 12,000 cigar-makers, to say nothing of the 700,000 other women and girls in industry in New York State, will remember when they have drawn off their long gloves and tasted their oysters to tell their dinner partners that they are opposed to woman suffrage because they fear it might take women out of the home.     WOMEN'S SPHERE     Many Men to Any Woman       If you have beauty, charm, refinement, tact,     If you can prove that should I set you free,     You would not contemplate the smallest act     That might annoy or interfere with me.     If you can show that women will abide     By the best standards of their womanhood--     (And I must be the person to decide     What in a woman is the highest good);     If you display efficiency supreme     In philanthropic work devoid of pay;     If you can show a clearly thought-out scheme     For bringing the millennium in a day:       Why, then, dear lady, at some time remote,     I might consider giving you the vote.     A Sex Difference       When men in Congress come to blows at something someone said,     I always notice that it shows their blood is quick and red;     But if two women disagree, with very little noise,     It proves, and this seems strange to me, that women have no poise.     Advice to Heroines   I      A heroine must shrink and cling       When heroes are about,     And thus the watching world will think:       \"How brave his heart and stout!\"     But if he chance to be away       When bright-faced dangers shine,     It will be best for her to play       The oak-tree, not the vine.     In fact the most important thing     Is knowing when it's time to cling.   II  _With apologies to R.L.S._      A heroine must be polite     And do what others say is right,     And think men wise and formidable--     At least as far as she is able.     Mutual Vows       \"My dear,\" he said, \"observe this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11689"],["title","Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times (#3)"],["body","bill,     Run up, I think you'll own, against my will.     If you will recollect our wedding day     You vowed on that occasion to obey.\"     \"I do recall the day,\" said she, \"and how     Me with your worldly goods you did endow.\"     \"That,\" he replied, \"is palpably absurd----\"     \"You mean you did not mean to keep your word?\"     \"O, yes,\" he answered, \"in a general way.\"     \"And that,\" said she, \"is how I meant obey.\"     If They Meant All They Said       Charm is a woman's strongest arm;     My charwoman is full of charm;     I chose her, not for strength of arm     But for her strange elusive charm.      And how tears heighten woman's powers!     My typist weeps for hours and hours:     I took her for her weeping powers--     They so delight my business hours.      A woman lives by intuition.     Though my accountant shuns addition     She has the rarest intuition.     (And I myself can do addition.)      Timidity in girls is nice.     My cook is so afraid of mice.     Now you'll admit it's very nice     To feel your cook's afraid of mice.     Democracy       Democracy is this--to hold       That all who wander down the pike       In cart or car, on foot or bike,     Or male or female, young or old,       Are much alike--are much alike.      Feminism       \"Mother, what is a Feminist?\"       \"A Feminist, my daughter,     Is any woman now who cares     To think about her own affairs       As men don't think she oughter.\"     The Warning       No, it isn't home neglecting     If you spend your time selecting       Seven blouses and a jacket and a hat;     Or to give your day to paying     Needless visits, or to playing       Auction bridge. What critic could object to that?     But to spend two precious hours     At a lecture! Oh, my powers,       The home is all a woman needs to learn.     And an hour, or a quarter,     Spent in voting! Why, my daughter,       You could not find your home on your return.     Evolution       Said Mr. Jones in 1910:     \"Women, subject yourselves to men.\"     Nineteen-Eleven heard him quote:     \"They rule the world without the vote.\"     By Nineteen-Twelve, he would submit     \"When all the women wanted it.\"     By Nineteen-Thirteen, looking glum,     He said that it was bound to come.     This year I heard him say with pride:     \"No reasons on the other side!\"     By Nineteen-Fifteen, he'll insist     He's always been a suffragist.     And what is really stranger, too,     He'll think that what he says is true.     Intercepted       \"Only the worst of them vote.\"       \"Are not the suffragists frights?\"     \"Nietzsche's the person to quote.\"       \"I prefer love to my rights.\"      \"Are not the suffragists frights?\"       \"Sex is their only appeal.\"     \"I prefer love to my rights.\"       \"No, we don't think, but we feel.\"      \"Sex is their only appeal.\"       \"Woman belongs at the loom.\"     \"No, we don't think, but we feel.\"       \"Doesn't it rub off the bloom?\"      \"Woman belongs at the loom.\"       \"Isn't the speaker a bore!\"     \"Doesn't it rub off the bloom?\"       \"Oh, it's a fad--nothing more.\"      \"Isn't the speaker a bore!\"       \"Nietzsche's the person to quote.\"     \"Oh, it's a fad--nothing more.\"       \"Only the worst of them vote.\"     The Universal Answer             Oh, there you go again,           Invading man's domain!     It's Nature's laws, you know, you are defying.           Don't fancy that you can           Be really like a man,     So what's the use of all this fuss and trying?           It seems to me so clear,           That women's highest sphere     Is being loving wives and patient mothers.           Oh, can't you be content           To be as you were meant?         {souls     For {books belong to husbands and to brothers.         {votes     Candor   (_By an admirer of the late H.C. Bunner_.)       \"I know what you're going to say,\" she said,       And she stood up, causing him some alarm;       \"You're going to tell me I'll lose my charm,     And what is a woman when charm has fled?       And you're going to say that you greatly fear       I don't understand a woman's sphere;     Now aren't you honestly?\" \"Yes,\" he said.      \"I know what you're going to say,\" she said,       \"You're going to ask what I hope to gain       By stepping down to the dusty plain,     By seeking a stone when I might have bread;       You're going to say: 'Can a vote replace       The tender force of a woman's grace?'     Now, aren't you honestly?\" \"Yes,\" he said.      \"I know what you're going to do,\" he said,       \"You're going to talk to me all day long       Trying to make me see I'm wrong;     And other men who are less misled       Will pale with jealousy when they see       The time you give to converting me;     Now, aren't you honestly?\" \"Ye-es,\" she said.     What Every Woman Must Not Say       \"I don't pretend I'm clever,\" he remarked, \"or very wise,\"     And at this she murmured, \"Really,\" with the right polite surprise.     \"But women,\" he continued, \"I must own I understand;     Women are a contradiction--honorable and underhand--     Constant as the star Polaris, yet as changeable as Fate,     Always flying what they long for, always seeking what they hate.\"     \"Don't you think,\" began the lady, but he cut her short: \"I see     That you take it personally--women always do,\" said he.     \"You will pardon me for saying every woman is the same,     Always greedy for approval, always sensitive to blame;     Sweet and passionate are women; weak in mind, though strong in soul;     Even you admit, I fancy, that they have no self-control?\"     \"No, I don't admit they haven't,\" said the patient lady then,     \"Or they could not sit and listen to the nonsense talked by men.\"     Chivalry       It's treating a woman politely       As long as she isn't a fright:     It's guarding the girls who act rightly,       If you can be judge of what's right;     It's being--not just, but so pleasant;       It's tipping while wages are low;     It's making a beautiful present,       And failing to pay what you owe.       _From Our Own Nursery Rhymes_      \"Chivalry, Chivalry, where have you been?\"     \"I've been out seeking a beautiful queen.\"     \"Chivalry, Chivalry, what did you find?\"     \"Commonplace women, not much to my mind.\"     Women  (_With rather insincere apologies to Mr. Rudyard Kipling_.)       I went to ask my government if they would set me free,     They gave a pardoned crook a vote, but hadn't one for me;     The men about me laughed and frowned and said: \"Go home, because     We really can't be bothered when we're busy making laws.\"      Oh, it's women this, and women that and women have no sense,     But it's pay your taxes promptly when it comes to the expense,     It comes to the expense, my dears, it comes to the expense,     It's pay your taxes promptly when it comes to the expense.      I went into a factory to earn my daily bread:     Men said: \"The home is woman's sphere.\" \"I have no home,\" I said.     But when the men all marched to war, they cried to wife and maid,     \"Oh, never mind about the home, but save the export trade.\"      For it's women this and women that, and home's the place for you,     But it's patriotic angels when there's outside work to do,     There's outside work to do, my dears, there's outside work to do,     It's patriotic angels when there's outside work to do.      We are not really senseless, and we are not angels, too,     But very human beings, human just as much as you.     It's hard upon occasions to be forceful and sublime     When you're treated as incompetents three-quarters of the time.      But it's women this and women that, and woman's like a hen,     But it's do the country's work alone, when war takes off the men,     And it's women this and women that and everything you please,     But woman is observant, and be sure that woman sees.     Beware!       In the days that are gone when a statue was wanted       In park or museum where statues must be,     A chivalrous male would come forward undaunted       And say: \"If you must have one, make it of me.     Bad though they be, yet I'll agree     If you must make them, why make them of me.\"      But chivalry's dead, as I always expected       Since women would not let things stay as they were;     So now, I suppose, when a statue's erected       Men will say brutally: \"Make it of her.\"     She may prefer things as they were     When they start making the statues of her.     Male Philosophy       Men are very brave, you know,     That was settled long ago;     Ask, however, if you doubt it,     Any man you meet about it;     He will say, I think, like me,     Men are brave as they can be.      Women think they're brave, you say?     Do they really? Well, they may,     But such biased attestation     Is not worth consideration,     For a legal judgment shelves     What they say about themselves.     From a Man's Point of View       Women love self-sacrifice     Suffering and good advice;     If they don't love these sincerely     Then they're not true women really.     Oh, it shocks me so to note     Women pleading for the vote!     Saying publicly it would     Educate and do them good.     Such a selfish reason trips     Oddly from a woman's lips.     But it must not be supposed     I am in the least opposed.     If they want it let them try it.     For I think we'll profit by it.     Glory       I went to see old Susan Gray,     Whose soldier sons had marched away,     And this is what she had to say:      \"It isn't war I hate at all--       'Tis likely men must fight--     But, oh, these flags and uniforms,       It's them that isn't right!     If war must come, and come it does       To take our boys from play,     It isn't right to make it seem       So beautiful and gay.\"      I left old Susan with a sigh;     A famous band was marching by     To make men glad they had to die.
