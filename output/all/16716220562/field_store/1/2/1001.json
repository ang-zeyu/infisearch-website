Teta hath seen his body in the Semketet boat, he knoweth the uraeus which is in the M[=a]ntchet boat, and God hath called him in his name...and hath taken him in to R[=a].\" And again [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 150.] we have: \"Thou hast received the form (_or_ attribute) of God, and thou hast become great therewith before the gods\"; and of Pepi I., who reigned about B.C. 3000, it is said, \"This Pepi is God, the son of God.\" [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 222.] Now in these passages the allusion is to the supreme Being in the next world, the Being who has the power to invoke and to obtain a favourable reception for the deceased king by R[=a], the Sun-god, the type and symbol of God. It may, of course, be urged that the word _neter_ here refers to Osiris, but it is not customary to speak of this god in such a way in the texts; and even if we admit that it does, it only shows that the powers of God have been attributed to Osiris, and that he was believed to occupy the position in respect of R[=a] and the deceased which the supreme Being himself occupied. In the last two extracts given above we might read \"a god\" instead of \"God,\" but there is no object in the king receiving the form or attribute of a nameless god; and unless Pepi becomes the son of God; the honour which the writer of that text intends to ascribe to the king becomes little and even ridiculous.  Passing from religious texts to works containing moral precepts, we find much light thrown upon the idea of God by the writings of the early sages of Egypt. First and foremost among these are the \"Precepts of Kaqemna\" and the \"Precepts of Ptah-hetep,\" works which were composed as far back as B.C. 3000. The oldest copy of them which we possess is, unfortunately, not older than B.C. 2500, but this fact in no way affects our argument. These \"precepts\" are intended to form a work of direction and guidance for a young man in the performance of his duty towards the society in which he lived and towards his God. It is only fair to say that the reader will look in vain in them for the advice which is found in writings of a similar character composed at a later period; but as a work intended to demonstrate the \"whole duty of man\" to the youth of the time when the Great Pyramid was still a new building, these \"precepts\" are very remarkable. The idea of God held by Ptah-hetep is illustrated by the following passages:--    1. \"Thou shalt make neither man nor woman to be afraid, for God is   opposed thereto; and if any man shall say that he will live thereby,   He will make him to want bread.\"    2. \"As for the nobleman who possesseth abundance of goods, he may act   according to his own dictates; and he may do with himself that which   he pleaseth; if he will do nothing at all, that also is as he   pleaseth. The nobleman by merely stretching out his hand doeth that   which mankind (_or_ a person) cannot attain to; but inasmuch as the   eating of bread is according to the plan of God, this cannot be   gainsaid.\"    3. \"If thou hast ground to till, labour in the field which God hath   given thee; rather than fill thy mouth with that which belongeth to   thy neighbours it is better to terrify him that hath possessions [to   give them unto thee].\"    4. \"If thou abasest thyself in the service of a perfect man, thy   conduct shall be fair before God.\"    5. \"If thou wouldst be a wise man, make thou thy son to be pleasing   unto God.\"    6. \"Satisfy those who depend upon thee as far as thou art able so to   do; this should be done by those whom God hath favoured.\"    7. \"If, having been of no account, thou hast become great; and if,   having been poor, thou hast become rich; and if thou hast become   governor of the city, be not hard-hearted on account of thy   advancement, because thou hast become merely the guardian of the   things which God hath provided.\"    8. \"What is loved of God is obedience; God hateth disobedience.\"    9. \"Verily a good son is of the gifts of God.\" [Footnote: The text was   published by Prisse d'Avennes, entitled _Facsimile d'un papyrus   égyptien en caractères hieratiques_, Paris, 1847. For a translation of   the whole work, see Virey, _études sur le Papyrus Prisse_, Paris,   1887.]  The same idea of God, but considerably amplified in some respects, may be found in the _Maxims of Khensu-Hetep_, a work which was probably composed during the XVIIIth dynasty. This work has been studied in detail by a number of eminent Egyptologists, and though considerable difference of opinion has existed among them in respect of details and grammatical niceties, the general sense of the maxims has been clearly established. To illustrate the use of the word _neter_, the following passages have been chosen from it:[Footnote: They are given with interlinear transliteration and translation in my _Papyrus of Ani_, p. lxxxv. ff., where references to the older literature on the subject will be found.]--    1. \"God magnifieth his name.\"    2. \"What the house of God hateth is much speaking. Pray thou with a   loving heart all the petitions which are in secret. He will perform   thy business, he will hear that which thou sayest and will accept   thine offerings.\"    3. \"God decreeth the right.\"    4. \"When thou makest an offering unto thy God, guard thou against the   things which are an abomination unto him. Behold thou his plans with   thine eye, and devote thyself to the adoration of his name. He giveth   souls unto millions of forms, and him that magnifieth him doth he   magnify.\"    5. \"If thy mother raise her hands to God he will hear her prayers [and   rebuke thee].\"    7. \"Give thyself to God, and keep thou thyself daily for God.\"  Now, although the above passages prove the exalted idea which the Egyptians held of the supreme Being, they do not supply us with any of the titles and epithets which they applied to him; for these we must have recourse to the fine hymns and religious meditations which form so important a part of the \"Book of the Dead.\" But before we quote from them, mention must be made of the _neteru_, _i.e._, the beings or existences which in some way partake of the nature or character of God, and are usually called \"gods.\" The early nations that came in contact with the Egyptians usually misunderstood the nature of these beings, and several modern Western writers have done the same. When we examine these \"gods\" closely, they are found to be nothing more nor less than forms, or manifestations, or phases, or attributes, of one god, that god being R[=a] the Sun-god, who, it must be remembered, was the type and symbol of God. Nevertheless, the worship of the _neteru_ by the Egyptians has been made the base of the charge of \"gross idolatry\" which has been brought against them, and they have been represented by some as being on the low intellectual level of savage tribes. It is certain that from the earliest times one of the greatest tendencies of the Egyptian religion was towards monotheism, and this tendency may be observed in all important texts down to the latest period; it is also certain that a kind of polytheism existed in Egypt side by side with monotheism from very early times. Whether monotheism or polytheism be the older, it is useless in our present state of knowledge to attempt to enquire. According to Tiele, the religion of Egypt was at the beginning polytheistic, but developed in two opposite directions: in the one direction gods were multiplied by the addition of local gods, and in the other the Egyptians drew nearer and nearer to monotheism. [Footnote: _Geschiedenis van den Godedienst in de Oudheid_, Amsterdam, 1893, p. 25. A number of valuable remarks on this subject are given by Lieblein in _Egyptian Religion_, p. 10.] Dr. Wiedemann takes the view that three main elements may be recognized in the Egyptian religion: (1) A solar monotheism, that is to say one god, the creator of the universe, who manifests his power especially in the sun and its operations; (2) A cult of the regenerating power of nature, which expresses itself in the adoration of ithyphallic gods, of fertile goddesses, and of a series of animals and of various deities of vegetation; (3) A perception of an anthropomorphic divinity, the life of whom in this world and in the world beyond this was typical of the ideal life of man [Footnote: _Le Livre dei Moris_ (Review in _Muséon_, Tom. xiii. 1893).]--this last divinity being, of course, Osiris. But here again, as Dr. Wiedemann says, it is an unfortunate fact that all the texts which we possess are, in respect of the period of the origin of the Egyptian religion, comparatively late, and therefore in them we find these three elements mixed together, along with a number of foreign matters, in such a way as to make it impossible to discover which of them is the oldest. No better example can be given of the loose way in which different ideas about a god and God are mingled in the same text than the \"Negative Confession\" in the hundred and twenty-fifth chapter of the Book of the Dead. Here, in the oldest copies of the passages known, the deceased says, \"I have not cursed God\" (1. 38), and a few lines after (1. 42) he adds, \"I have not thought scorn of the god living in my city.\" It seems that here we have indicated two different layers of belief, and that the older is represented by the allusion to the \"god of the city,\" in which case it would go back to the time when the Egyptian lived in a very primitive fashion. If we assume that God (who is mentioned in line 38) is Osiris, it does not do away with the fact that he was regarded as a being entirely different from the \"god of the city\" and that he was of sufficient importance to have one line of the \"Confession\" devoted to him. The Egyptian saw no incongruity in setting references to the \"gods\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11277"],["title","Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life (#3)"],["body","by side with allusions to a god whom we cannot help identifying with the Supreme Being and the Creator of the world; his ideas and beliefs have, in consequence, been sadly misrepresented, and by certain writers he has been made an object of ridicule. What, for example, could be a more foolish description of Egyptian worship than the following? \"Who knows not, O Volusius of Bithynia, the sort of monsters Egypt, in her infatuation, worships. One part venerates the crocodile; another trembles before an ibis gorged with serpents. The image of a sacred monkey glitters in gold, where the magic chords sound from Memnon broken in half, and ancient Thebes lies buried in ruins, with her hundred gates. In one place they venerate sea-fish, in another river-fish; there, whole towns worship a dog: no one Diana. It is an impious act to violate or break with the teeth a leek or an onion. O holy nations! whose gods grow for them in their gardens! Every table abstains from animals that have wool: it is a crime there to kill a kid. But human flesh is lawful food.\"  [Footnote: Juvenal, Satire XV. (Evans' translation in Bohn's Series, p. 180). Led astray by Juvenal, our own good George Herbert (_Church Militant_) wrote:--    \"At first he (_i.e._, Sin) got to Egypt, and did sow   Gardens of gods, which every year did grow   Fresh and fine deities. They were at great cost,   Who for a god clearly a sallet lost.   Ah, what a thing is man devoid of grace,   Adoring garlic with an humble face,   Begging his food of that which he may eat,   Starving the while he worshippeth his meat!   Who makes a root his god, how low is he,   If God and man be severed infinitely!   What wretchedness can give him any room,   Whose house is foul, while he adores his broom?\"]  The epithets which the Egyptians applied to their gods also bear valuable testimony concerning the ideas which they held about God. We have already said that the \"gods\" are only forms, manifestations, and phases of R[=a], the Sun-god, who was himself the type and symbol of God, and it is evident from the nature of these epithets that they were only applied to the \"gods\" because they represented some qualify or attribute which they would have applied to God had it been their custom to address Him. Let us take as examples the epithets which are applied to H[=a]pi the god of the Nile. The beautiful hymn [Footnote: The whole hymn has been published by Maspero in _Hymns au Nil_, Paris, 1868.] to this god opens as follows:--    \"Homage to thee, O H[=a]pi! Thou comest forth in this land, and dost   come in peace to make Egypt to live, O thou hidden one, thou guide of   the darkness whensoever it is thy pleasure to be its guide. Thou   waterest the fields which R[=a] hath created, thou makest all animals   to live, thou makest the land to drink without ceasing; thou   descendest the path of heaven, thou art the friend of meat and drink,   thou art the giver of the grain, and thou makest every place of work   to flourish, O Ptah! ... If thou wert to be overcome in heaven the   gods would fall down headlong, and mankind would perish. Thou makest   the whole earth to be opened (_or_ ploughed up) by the cattle, and   prince and peasant lie down to rest.... His disposition (_or_ form) is   that of Khnemu; when he shineth upon the earth there is rejoicing, for   all people are glad, the mighty man (?) receiveth his meat, and every   tooth hath food to consume.\"  After praising him for what he does for mankind and beasts, and for making the herb to grow for the use of all men, the text says:--    \"He cannot be figured in stone; he is not to be seen in the sculptured   images upon which men place the united crowns of the South and the   North furnished with uraei; neither works nor offerings can be made to   him; and he cannot be made to come forth from his secret place. The   place where he liveth is unknown; he is not to be found in inscribed   shrines; there existeth no habitation which can contain him; and thou   canst not conceive his form in thy heart.\"  First we notice that Hapi is addressed by the names of Ptah and Khnemu, not because the writer thought these three gods were one, but because Hapi as the great supplier of water to Egypt became, as it were, a creative god like Ptah and Khnemu. Next we see that it is stated to be impossible to depict him in paintings, or even to imagine what his form may be, for he is unknown and his abode cannot be found, and no place can contain him. But, as a matter of fact, several pictures and sculptures of H[=a]pi have been preserved, and we know that he is generally depicted in the form of two gods; one has upon his head a papyrus plant, and the other a lotus plant, the former being the Nile-god of the South, and the latter the Nile-god of the North. Elsewhere he is portrayed in the form of a large man having the breasts of a woman. It is quite clear, then, that the epithets which we have quoted are applied to him merely as a form of God. In another hymn, which was a favourite in the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties, H[=a]pi is called \"One,\" and is said to have created himself; but as he is later on in the text identified with R[=a] the epithets which belong to the Sun-god are applied to him. The late Dr. H. Brugsch collected [Footnote: _Religion and Mythologie_, pp. 96-99.] a number of the epithets which are applied to the gods, from texts of all periods; and from these we may see that the ideas and beliefs of the Egyptians concerning God were almost identical with those of the Hebrews and Muhammadans at later periods. When classified these epithets read thus:--    \"God is One and alone, and none other existeth with Him; God is the   One, the One Who hath made all things.    \"God is a spirit, a hidden spirit, the spirit of spirits, the great   spirit of the Egyptians, the divine spirit.    \"God is from the beginning, and He hath been from the beginning; He   hath existed from of old and was when nothing else had being. He   existed when nothing else existed, and what existeth He created after   He had come into being. He is the father of beginnings.    \"God is the eternal One, He is eternal and infinite; and endureth for   ever and aye; He hath endured for countless ages, and He shall endure   to all eternity.    \"God is the hidden Being, and no man hath known His form. No man hath   been able to seek out His likeness; He is hidden, from gods and men,   and He is a mystery unto His creatures.    \"No man knoweth how to know Him, His name remaineth hidden; His name   is a mystery unto His children. His names are innumerable, they are   manifold and none knoweth their number.    \"God is truth, and He liveth by truth, and he feedeth thereon. He is   the King of truth, He resteth upon truth, He fashioneth truth, and He   executeth truth throughout all the world.    \"God is life, and through Him only man liveth, He giveth life to man,   and He breatheth the breath of life into his nostrils.    \"God is father and mother, the father of fathers, and the mother of   mothers. He begetteth, but was never begotten; He produceth, but was   never produced He begat Himself and produced Himself. He createth, but   was never created; He is the maker of His own form, and the fashioner   of His own body.    \"God Himself is existence He liveth in all things, and liveth upon all   things. He endureth without increase or diminution, He multiplieth   Himself millions of times, and He possesseth multitudes of forms and   multitudes of members.    \"God hath made the universe, and He hath created all that therein is:   He is the Creator of what is in this world, of what was, of what is,   and of what shall be. He is the Creator of the world, and it was He   Who fashioned it with His hands before there was any beginning; and He   stablished it with that which went forth from Him. He is the Creator   of the heavens and the earth; the Creator of the heavens, and the   earth, and the deep; the Creator of the heavens, and the earth, and   the deep, and the waters, and the mountains. God hath stretched out   the heavens and founded the earth. What His heart conceived came to   pass straightway, and when He had spoken His word came to pass, and it   shall endure for ever.    \"God is the father of the gods, and the father of the father of all   deities; He made His voice to sound, and the deities came into being,   and the gods sprang into existence after He had spoken with His mouth.   He formed mankind and fashioned the gods. He is the great Master, the   primeval Potter Who turned men and gods out of His hands, and He   formed men and gods upon a potter's table.    \"The heavens rest upon His head, and the earth supporteth His feet;   heaven hideth His spirit, the earth hideth His form, and the   underworld shutteth up the mystery of Him within it. His body is like   the air, heaven resteth upon His head, and the new inundation [of the   Nile] containeth His form.    \"God is merciful unto those who reverence Him, and He heareth him that   calleth upon Him. He protecteth the weak against the strong, and He   heareth the cry of him that is bound in fetters; He judgeth between   the mighty and the weak, God knoweth him that knoweth Him, He   rewardeth him that serveth Him, and He protecteth him that followeth   Him.\"  We have now to consider the visible emblem, and the type and symbol of God, namely the Sun-god R[=a], who was worshipped in Egypt in prehistoric times. According to the writings of the Egyptians, there was a time when neither heaven nor earth existed, and when nothing had being except the boundless primeval [Footnote: See Brugsch, _Religion_, p. 101.] water, which was, however, shrouded with thick darkness. In this condition the primeval water remained for a considerable time, notwithstanding that it contained within it the germs of the things which afterwards came into existence in this world, and the world itself. At length the spirit of the primeval water felt the"]]]
