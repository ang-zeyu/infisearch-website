Phil Abingdon came forward quite naturally--and quite naturally Paul Harley discovered her little gloved hand to lie clasped between both his own. It was more like a reunion than a first meeting and was so laden with perfect understanding that, even yet, speech seemed scarcely worth while.  Thinking over that moment, in later days, Paul Harley remembered that he had been prompted by some small inner voice to say: “So you have come back?” It was recognition. Of the hundreds of men and women who came into his life for a while, and ere long went out of it again, he knew, by virtue of that sixth sense of his, that Phil Abingdon had come to stay--whether for joy or sorrow he could not divine.  It was really quite brief--that interval of silence--although perhaps long enough to bridge the ages.  “How brave of you, Miss Abingdon!” said Harley. “How wonderfully brave of you!”  “She’s an Abingdon,” came the deep tones of Doctor McMurdoch. “She arrived only two hours ago and here she is.”  “There can be no rest for me, Doctor,” said the girl, and strove valiantly to control her voice, “until this dreadful doubt is removed. Mr. Harley”--she turned to him appealingly--“please don’t study my feelings in the least; I can bear anything--now; just tell me what happened. Oh! I had to come. I felt that I had to come.”  As Paul Harley placed an armchair for his visitor, his glance met that of Doctor McMurdoch, and in the gloomy eyes he read admiration of this girl who could thus conquer the inherent weakness of her sex and at such an hour and after a dreadful ordeal set her hand to the task which fate had laid upon her.  Doctor McMurdoch sat down on a chair beside the door, setting his silk hat upon the floor and clasping his massive chin with his hand.  “I will endeavour to do as you wish, Miss Abingdon,” said Harley, glancing anxiously at the physician.  But Doctor McMurdoch returned only a dull stare. It was evident that this man of stone was as clay in the hands of Phil Abingdon. He deprecated the strain which she was imposing upon her nervous system, already overwrought to the danger point, but he was helpless for all his dour obstinacy. Harley, looking down at the girl’s profile, read a new meaning into the firm line of her chin. He was conscious of an insane desire to put his arms around this new acquaintance who seemed in some indefinable yet definite way to belong to him and to whisper the tragic story he had to tell, comforting her the while.  He began to relate what had taken place at the first interview, when Sir Charles had told him of the menace which he had believed to hang over his life. He spoke slowly, deliberately, choosing his words with a view to sparing Phil Abingdon’s feelings as far as possible.  She made no comment throughout, but her fingers alternately tightened and relaxed their hold upon the arms of the chair in which she was seated. Once, at some reference to words spoken by her father, her sensitive lips began to quiver and Harley, watching her, paused. She held the chair arms more tightly. “Please go on, Mr. Harley,” she said.  The words were spoken in a very low voice, but the speaker looked up bravely, and Harley, reassured, proceeded uninterruptedly to the end of the story. Then:  “At some future time, Miss Abingdon,” he concluded, “I hope you will allow me to call upon you. There is so much to be discussed--”  Again Phil Abingdon looked up into his face. “I have forced myself to come to see you to-day,” she said, “because I realize there is no service I can do poor dad so important as finding out--”  “I understand,” Harley interrupted, gently. “But--”  “No, no.” Phil Abingdon shook her head rebelliously. “Please ask me what you want to know. I came for that.”  He met the glance of violet eyes, and understood something of Doctor McMurdoch’s helplessness. He found his thoughts again wandering into strange, wild byways and was only recalled to the realities by the dry, gloomy voice of the physician. “Go on, Mr. Harley,” said Doctor McMurdoch. “She has grand courage.”    CHAPTER VII. CONFESSIONS  Paul Harley crossed the room and stood in front of the tall Burmese cabinet. He experienced the utmost difficulty in adopting a judicial attitude toward his beautiful visitor. Proximity increased his mental confusion. Therefore he stood on the opposite side of the office ere beginning to question her.  “In the first place, Miss Abingdon,” he said, speaking very deliberately, “do you attach any particular significance to the term ‘Fire-Tongue’?”  Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly at Doctor McMurdoch. “None at all, Mr. Harley,” she replied. “The doctor has already told me of--”  “You know why I ask?” She inclined her head.  “And Mr. Nicol Brinn? Have you met this gentleman?”  “Never. I know that Dad had met him and was very much interested in him.”  “In what way?”  “I have no idea. He told me that he thought Mr. Brinn one of the most singular characters he had ever known. But beyond describing his rooms in Piccadilly, which had impressed him as extraordinary, he said very little about Mr. Brinn. He sounded interesting and “--she hesitated and her eyes filled with tears--“I asked Dad to invite him home.” Again she paused. This retrospection, by making the dead seem to live again, added to the horror of her sudden bereavement, and Harley would most gladly have spared her more. “Dad seemed strangely disinclined to do so,” she added.  At that the keen investigator came to life within Harley. “Your father did not appear anxious to bring Mr. Brinn to his home?” he asked, eagerly.  “Not at all anxious. This was all the more strange because Dad invited Mr. Brinn to his club.”  “He gave no reason for his refusal?”  “Oh, there was no refusal, Mr. Harley. He merely evaded the matter. I never knew why.”  “H’m,” muttered Harley. “And now, Miss Abingdon, can you enlighten me respecting the identity of the Oriental gentleman with whom he had latterly become acquainted?”  Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly at Doctor McMurdoch and then lowered her head. She did not answer at once. “I know to whom you refer, Mr. Harley,” she said, finally. “But it was I who had made this gentleman’s acquaintance. My father did not know him.”  “Then I wonder why he mentioned him?” murmured Harley.  “That I cannot imagine. I have been wondering ever since Doctor McMurdoch told me.”  “You recognize the person to whom Sir Charles referred?”  “Yes. He could only have meant Ormuz Khan.”  “Ormuz Khan--” echoed Harley. “Where have I heard that name?”  “He visits England periodically, I believe. In fact, he has a house somewhere near London. I met him at Lady Vail’s.”  “Lady Vail’s? His excellency moves, then, in diplomatic circles? Odd that I cannot place him.”  “I have a vague idea, Mr. Harley, that he is a financier. I seem to have heard that he had something to do with the Imperial Bank of Iran.” She glanced naively at Harley. “Is there such a bank?” she asked.  “There is,” he replied. “Am I to understand that Ormuz Khan is a Persian?”  “I believe he is a Persian,” said Phil Abingdon, rather confusedly. “To be quite frank, I know very little about him.”  Paul Harley gazed steadily at the speaker for a moment. “Can you think of any reason why Sir Charles should have worried about this gentleman?”  he asked.  The girl lowered her head again. “He paid me a lot of attention,” she finally confessed.  “This meeting at Lady Vail’s, then, was the first of many?”  “Oh, no--not of many! I saw him two or three times. But he began to send me most extravagant presents. I suppose it was his Oriental way of paying a compliment, but Dad objected.”  “Of course he would. He knew his Orient and his Oriental. I assume, Miss Abingdon, that you were in England during the years that your father lived in the East?”  “Yes. I was at school. I have never been in the East.”  Paul Harley hesitated. He found himself upon dangerously delicate ground and was temporarily at a loss as to how to proceed. Unexpected aid came from the taciturn Doctor McMurdoch.  “He never breathed a word of this to me, Phil,” he said, gloomily. “The impudence of the man! Small wonder Abingdon objected.”  Phil Abingdon tilted her chin forward rebelliously.  “Ormuz Khan was merely unfamiliar with English customs,” she retorted. “There was nothing otherwise in his behaviour to which any one could have taken exception.”  “What’s that!” demanded the physician. “If a man of colour paid his heathen attentions to my daughter--”  “But you have no daughter, Doctor.”  “No. But if I had--”  “If you had,” echoed Phil Abingdon, and was about to carry on this wordy warfare which, Harley divined, was of old standing between the two, when sudden realization of the purpose of the visit came to her. She paused, and he saw her biting her lips desperately. Almost at random he began to speak again.  “So far as you are aware, then, Miss Abingdon, Sir Charles never met Ormuz Khan?”  “He never even saw him, Mr. Harley, that I know of.”  “It is most extraordinary that he should have given me the impression that this man--for I can only suppose that he referred to Ormuz Khan--was in some way associated with his fears.”  “I must remind you, Mr. Harley,” Doctor McMurdoch interrupted, “that poor Abingdon was a free talker. His pride, I take it, which was strong, had kept him silent on this matter with me, but he welcomed an opportunity of easing his mind to one discreet and outside the family circle. His words to you may have had no bearing upon the thing he wished to consult you about.”  “H’m,” mused Harley. “That’s possible. But such was not my impression.”  He turned again to Phil Abingdon. “This Ormuz Khan, I understood you to say, actually resides in or near London?”  “He is at present living at the Savoy, I believe. He also has a house somewhere outside London.”  There were a hundred other questions Paul Harley was anxious to ask: some that were professional but more that were personal.

No weasel was ever half so sensitive on that point as he was. Wherever he happened to be (and in the course of his adventurous life he had been to nearly all parts of the known world) he was the first awake in the morning and the last asleep at night; he always answered promptly to the first call; and was never known by any man living to have been seen with his eyes shut, except when he winked, and that operation he performed less frequently than other men.  John Buzzby was an old salt--a regular true-blue Jack tar of the old school, who had been born and bred at sea; had visited foreign ports innumerable; had weathered more storms than he could count, and had witnessed more strange sights than he could remember. He was tough, and sturdy, and grizzled, and broad, and square, and massive--a first-rate specimen of a John Bull, and according to himself, \"always kept his weather-eye open.\" This remark of his was apt to create confusion in the minds of his hearers; for John meant the expression to be understood figuratively, while, in point of fact, he almost always kept one of his literal eyes open and the other partially closed, but as he reversed the order of arrangement frequently, he might have been said to keep his lee-eye as much open as the weather one. This peculiarity gave to his countenance an expression of earnest thoughtfulness mingled with humour. Buzzby was fond of being thought old, and he looked much older than he really was. Men guessed his age at fifty-five, but they were ten years out in their reckoning; for John had numbered only forty-five summers, and was as tough and muscular as ever he had been--although not quite so elastic.  John Buzzby stood on the pier of the sea-port town of Grayton watching the active operations of the crew of a whaling-ship which was on the point of starting for the ice-bound seas of the Frozen Regions, and making sundry remarks to a stout, fair-haired boy of fifteen, who stood by his side gazing at the ship with an expression of deep sadness.  \"She's a trim-built craft and a good sea-boat, I'll be bound, Master Fred,\" observed the sailor; \"but she's too small by half, accordin' to my notions, and I _have_ seen a few whalers in my day. Them bow-timbers, too, are scarce thick enough for goin' bump agin the ice o' Davis' Straits. Howsom'iver, I've seen worse craft drivin' a good trade in the Polar Seas.\"  \"She's a first-rate craft in all respects; and you have too high an opinion of your own judgment,\" replied the youth indignantly. \"Do you suppose that my father, who is an older man than yourself and as good a sailor, would buy a ship, and fit her out, and go off to the whale-fishery in her, if he did not think her a good one?\"  \"Ah! Master Fred, you're a chip of the old block--neck or nothing--carry on all sail till you tear the masts out of her! Reef the t'gallant sails of your temper, boy, and don't run foul of an old man who has been all but a wet-nurse to ye--taught ye to walk, and swim, and pull an oar, and build ships, and has hauled ye out o' the sea when ye fell in--from the time ye could barely stump along on two legs, lookin' like as if ye was more nor half-seas-over.\"  \"Well, Buzzby,\" replied the boy, laughing, \"if you've been all that to me, I think you _have_ been a _wet_-nurse too! But why do you run down my father's ship? Do you think I'm going to stand that? No! not even from you, old boy.\"  \"Hallo! youngster,\" shouted a voice from the deck of the vessel in question, \"run up and tell your father we're all ready, and if he don't make haste he'll lose the tide, so he will, and that'll make us have to start on a Friday, it will, an' that'll not do for me, nohow it won't; so make sail and look sharp about it, do--won't you?\"  \"What a tongue he's got!\" remarked Buzzby. \"Before I'd go to sea with a first mate who jawed like that I'd be a landsman. Don't ever you git to talk too much, Master Fred, wotever ye do. My maxim is--and it has served me through life, uncommon--'Keep your weather-eye open and your tongue housed 'xcept when you've got occasion to use it.' If that fellow'd use his eyes more and his tongue less, he'd see your father comin' down the road there, right before the wind, with his old sister in tow.\"  \"How I wish he would have let me go with him!\" muttered Fred to himself sorrowfully.  \"No chance now, I'm afeard,\" remarked his companion. \"The gov'nor's as stiff as a nor'-wester. Nothin' in the world can turn him once he's made up his mind but a regular sou'-easter. Now, if you had been _my_ son, and yonder tight craft _my_ ship, I would have said, 'Come at once.' But your father knows best, lad; and you're a wise son to obey orders cheerfully, without question. That's another o' my maxims, 'Obey orders, an' ax no questions.'\"  Frederick Ellice, senior, who now approached, whispering words of consolation into the ear of his weeping sister, might, perhaps, have just numbered fifty years. He was a fine, big, bold, hearty Englishman, with a bald head, grizzled locks, a loud but not harsh voice, a rather quick temper, and a kind, earnest, enthusiastic heart. Like Buzzby, he had"]]]
