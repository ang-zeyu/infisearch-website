Under their tuition, and that of his father, Fred Whitney became a skilful horseman and rancher. He learned to lasso and bring down an obdurate steer, to give valuable help in the round-ups, to assist in branding the registered trademark of his father on the haunches of his animals.  This brand consisted of a cross, with two stars above, one below, the initial letter of his given name on the left, and that of his surname on the right. When this was burned into the flesh of the yearlings, it identified his property, no matter where wandering, and the honest rancher would no more disturb it than he would enter another's home and rob him of his clothing.  The first year was an enjoyable one to Jennie. Her father presented her with an excellent animal, of which she became very fond. A good horsewoman when in Maine, in Wyoming she acquired a skill which compelled the admiration of the cowmen themselves.  \"She's struck her callin',\" remarked Budd Hankinson one day, while watching her speeding like a courser across the open country.  \"What is that?\" asked the father, who was proud of his children, and especially of the pretty daughter.  \"Why, riding hosses like a streak of lightnin',\" was the somewhat indefinite response.  \"What particular profession can she fill by dashing over the country in that style?\" continued the parent with a smile.  \"Why, showing other persons how it is done. I've no doubt, colonel, that she could make good wages in breaking broncos and teaching young women like her how to ride in the right style; I advise you to think about it.\"  \"I will do so,\" replied the parent, with so much gravity that the cowman never suspected his sincerity, but felt the satisfaction of believing he had given his employer a valuable \"pointer.\"  Another pleasure which followed the removal of the Whitneys to Wyoming was that their friend Monteith Sterry followed them within a few months. He had shown some signs of running down in health while attending the high school in Boston, despite the fact that he was one of the best athletes in the institution; but he readily persuaded his wealthy father that a few months' experience in the bracing northwest would do him more good than anything and everything else in the world.  That he might have some pretext other than the one which could not wholly deceive the Whitneys, he engaged to serve the Live Stock Association, which was beginning to have trouble with the rustlers. Matters were not only going wrong, but were rapidly getting worse in Wyoming, and they were glad to secure the services of such a daring and honest youth, who seemed rather to welcome the fact that he could perform his duties faithfully only at personal risk to himself.  It need not be explained how it came about that young Sterry found it necessary to give a great deal of his attention to that section of Wyoming in which the Whitneys lived. There appeared to be more need of it there than in any of the other neighborhoods where the outlook was really threatening.  The natural consequence was that he became a frequent visitor at the home of his former friend, though he found other acquaintances engaged in the cattle business who were glad to have him take shelter under their roofs. Sometimes he engaged in hunting with them, and several times Fred Whitney and Jennie joined him. There was a spice of peril in these excursions which rendered them fascinating to all three.  The particular day to which we refer was a mild afternoon in May, 1892. Jennie was helping her mother with her household duties in their home, where they had lived since coming from their native State. The building was one of the long, low wooden structures common in that section, to which the fashions of the older civilization have not yet penetrated. It possessed all the comforts they required, though it took some time for the brother and sister to accustom themselves to the odd style of architecture.  Jennie, as usual, was in high spirits. She had been out for a ride during the forenoon, and was now trying to make up for it by taking the burden of most of the work upon her comely shoulders.  In the middle of one of her snatches of song she abruptly paused with the question:  \"Did you hear that, mother?\"  \"No; to what do you refer?\"  \"The sound of rifle-firing; something is wrong on the range.\"  The two paused and listened, looking in each other's pale countenances as they did so.  \"It _is_ rifle-firing!\" said Mrs. Whitney in a scared voice; \"what can it mean?\"  \"Trouble with the rustlers,\" replied Jennie, hurrying through the open door to the outside that she might hear the better. Her mother followed, and the two stood side by side, listening and peering across the wide stretch of undulating plain in the direction of the mountains, whose wooded crests were outlined against the clear spring sky.  There could be no mistaking the alarming sounds. They were made by rifles, fired sometimes in quick succession, often mingling with each other, and then showing comparatively long intervals between the discharges of the weapons.  \"Father said the rustlers were becoming bolder,\" remarked Jennie, \"and there was sure to be trouble with them before long.\"  \"It has come,\" was the comment of the parent, \"and who shall tell the result?\"  \"It cannot last long, mother.\"  \"A few minutes is a good while at such a time. A score of shots have already been fired, and some of them must have done execution.\"  \"Father, Fred and our two men are unerring shots.\"  \"And so are they,\" responded the mother, referring to the rustlers, who have made so much trouble for the cattlemen of Wyoming.     CHAPTER V.  LOOKING SOUTHWARD.   Mrs. Whitney and her daughter Jennie stood at the door of their ranch listening, with rapidly beating hearts, to the sounds of rifle-firing from the direction of the cattle-range where the beloved husband and son were looking after their property.  Three shots came in quick succession; then, after the interval of a full minute, two more followed, and then all was still.  Mother and daughter maintained their listening attitude a while longer, but nothing more reached their ears.  \"It is over,\" said the parent in an undertone.  Aye, the conflict was over. One party was beaten off, but which? And how many brave men, the finest horsemen and rifle-shots in the world, lay on the green sward, staring, with eyes that saw not, at the blue sky, or were being borne away by their comrades on the backs of their tough ponies?  A brief space and the story would be told.  Jennie Whitney shaded her eyes with her hand and gazed to the southward for the first sight of returning friends, whose coming could not be long delayed.  The mother was straining her vision in the same direction, watching for that which she longed and yet dreaded to see. But years had compelled her to use glasses, and her eyes were not the equal of those bright orbs of Jennie. She would be the first to detect the approaching horsemen.  A good field-glass was in the house, but neither thought of it; their attention was too deeply absorbed.  \"It is time they appeared,\" remarked Mrs. Whitney, her heart sinking under the dreadful fear of the possible reason why they remained invisible.  Suppose there was none to appear!  But those keen eyes of the maiden have detected something, and she starts and peers more intently than before.  Far to the southward, in the direction of the mountain spurs, and on the very boundary of her vision, a black speck seems to be quivering and flickering, so indistinct, so impalpable, that none but the experienced eye can guess its nature.  But the eye which is studying it is an experienced one. Many a time it has gazed across the rolling prairie, and identified the loved father and brother before another could discover a person at all.  \"Some one is coming,\" she says to her mother.  \"Some one!\" is the alarmed response; \"are there no more?\"  \"There may be, but this one is in advance.\"  \"But why should he be in advance of the rest?\" is the query, born of the fear in the heart of the parent.  \"It is not mine to answer for the present; he may be better mounted and is coming for--for--\"  \"For what?\"  \"Help.\"  \"Help! What help can we give them?\"  \"We have a gun in the house, and there is plenty of ammunition.\"  \"That means they have suffered--have been defeated. Look closely, Jennie; do you see no others?\"  She has been searching for them from the first. The approaching horseman is now fully defined against the dark-green of the mountains, and the country for half a mile is in clear view.  Over this broad expanse Jennie Whitney's eyes rove, and her heart seems to stand still as she answers:  \"He is alone; I see no others.\"  \"Then he brings evil tidings! Our people have been defeated; more than one has fallen.\"  The approaching horseman was riding furiously. His fleet animal was on a dead run, his neck outstretched, mane and tail streaming as he thundered through the hurricane created by his own tremendous speed.  The man who sat in the saddle was a perfect equestrian, as are all the cowmen and rustlers of the West. He leaned forward, as if he would help his horse to reach his goal at the earliest instant. His broad-brimmed hat fitted so well that it kept its place on his head without any fastening; but his own long, dark locks fluttered over his brawny shoulders, while the trusty Winchester was held in a firm grasp across the saddle in front, where it could be used on the second needed.  Jennie Whitney was studying him closely, for he must be father, brother, or one of the two hired men. She was praying that he was a relative, but it was not so.  The mother could now distinguish the horseman plainly, though not as much so as her daughter.  \"I think it is father,\" she said, speaking her hope rather than her conviction.  \"No; it is not he,\" replied the daughter.  \"Then it is Fred.\"  \"No; you are mistaken; it is Budd.\"  \"Alas "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11337"],["title","Cowmen and Rustlers: A Story of the Wyoming Cattle Ranges (#6)"],["body","alas! why should it be he, and neither my husband nor son?\" wailed the parent.  Jennie was right. The man was the veteran cowboy, Budd Hankinson, who had whirled the lasso on the arid plains of Arizona, the Llano Estacado of Texas and among the mountain ranges of Montana; who had fought Apaches in the southwest, Comanches in the south and Sioux in the north, and had undergone hardships, sufferings, wounds and privations before which many a younger man than he had succumbed.  No more skilful and no braver ranchman lived.  Budd had a way of snatching off his hat and swinging it about his head at sight of the ladies. It was his jocular salutation to them, and meant that all was well.  But he did not do so now. He must have seen the anxious mother and daughter almost as soon as they discerned him. Jennie watched for the greeting which did not come.  \"Something is amiss,\" was her conclusion.  The hoofs of the flying horse beat the hard ground with a regular rhythm, and he thundered forward like one who knew he was bringing decisive tidings which would make the hearts of the listeners stand still.  The black eyes of the cowman were seen gleaming under his hat-rim as he looked steadily at the couple, against whom his horse would dash himself the next minute, like a thunderbolt, unless checked.  No fear, however, of anything like that. He rounded to in front of the women, and halted with a suddenness that would have flung a less skilful rider over his head, but which hardly caused Budd Hankinson a jar.  He read the questioning eyes, and before the words could shape themselves on the pallid lips he called out:  \"The mischief is to pay!\"  \"What is it, Budd?\" asked Jennie, she and her mother stepping close to his box-stirrup.  \"We have had a fight with the rustlers--one of the worst I ever seed--there was eight of 'em.\"  \"Was anybody--hurt?\" faltered the mother.  \"Wal, I reckon; three of them rustlers won't rustle again very soon, onless that bus'ness is carried on below, where they've gone; two others have got holes through their bodies about the size of my hat.\"  \"But--but were any of our people injured?\" continued the parent, while Jennie tried to still the throbbing of her heart until the answer came.  \"Wal, yes,\" replied Budd, removing his hat and passing his handkerchief across his forehead, as though the matter was of slight account; \"I'm sorry to say some of us got it in the neck.\"  \"Who--who--how was it? Don't trifle!\"  \"Wal, you see Zip Peters rode over from Capt. Whiting's to tell us about the rustlers, and he hadn't much more'n arriv, when along come the others behind him with one of our branded steers. I made them give him up, and then the fight was on. Zip got a piece of lead through the body and the arm, and went out of the saddle without time to say good-by. My hip was grazed twice, but it didn't amount to nothin'; I'm as good as ever. Grizzly lost a piece of his ear, but he bored the rustler through that done it, so that account was squared.\"  \"Then father and Fred were not hurt?\" gasped Jennie, clasping her hands and gazing inquiringly into the face of the messenger.  \"Wal,\" he replied, with the same exasperating coolness he had shown after his first exclamation, \"I wish I could say that, but it ain't quite so good.\"  \"What--what of my husband?\" demanded Mrs. Whitney, stepping so close that she laid her hand on the knee of the sturdy horseman; \"tell me quick; and what of Fred, my son?\"  \"Fred fought like a house afire; he killed one of the rustlers, but his horse was shot and Fred got it through the arm, which ended his power to do much fighting, but he laid down behind his hoss and kept it up like the trump he is.\"  \"Then he isn't badly injured?\"  \"Bless your heart! of course not; he will be all right in a few days; his arm wants a little nursing, that's all. In the midst of the rumpus who should ride up but Mont Sterry, as he had heard the firing, and the way he sailed in was beautiful to behold. It reminded me of the times down in Arizona when Geronimo made it so lively. He hadn't much chance to show what he could do, for the rustlers found they had bitten off more than they could chaw, and they skyugled after he had dropped one.\"  The wife and mother drew a sigh of relief, but the daughter was far from satisfied. A dreadful fear in her heart had not yet been quelled.  Her quick perceptions noticed that Budd had said nothing more about her father than to mention the fact that he had been wounded. The mother, in her distress and anxiety, caught at a hope as an assurance which the daughter could not feel.  At the same time Jennie saw that, despite the apparent nonchalance of the messenger and his assumed gayety, he was stirred by some deep emotion.  \"He is keeping back something, because he fears to tell it,\" was her correct conclusion.     CHAPTER VI.  COWMEN AND RUSTLERS.   Jennie Whitney saw something else, which almost made her heart stop beating.  To the southward, whence Budd Hankinson had ridden, several horsemen were in sight, coming from the direction of the cattle-ranges. They were approaching at a walk, something they would not do unless serious cause existed.  The messenger had been sent ahead to break the news to the sad and anxious hearts.  \"Budd,\" she said, \"you have not told us about father.\"  \"Why, yes, my dear,\" interposed her mother, as if to shut out all evil tidings; \"nothing has happened to him.\"  \"Wal, I'm sorry to say that he has been hurt worse than Fred,\" was the alarming response, accompanied by a deep sigh.  \"How bad? How much worse? Tell us, tell us,\" insisted the wife.  \"Thar's no use of denyin' that he got it bad; fact is he couldn't have been hit harder.\"  The distressed fellow was so worked up that he turned his head and looked over his shoulder, as if to avoid those yearning eyes fixed upon him. That aimless glance revealed the approaching horsemen and nerved him with new courage.  \"Now, Mrs. Whitney and Jennie, you must be brave. Bear it as he would bear the news about you and Fred if he was--alive!\"  A shriek accompanied the words of the cowman, and Jennie caught her mother in time to save her from falling. Her own heart was breaking, but she did her utmost, poor thing, to cheer the one to whom the sunlight of happiness could never come again.  \"There, mother, try to bear it. We have Fred left to us, and I am with you. God will not desert us.\"  Hugh Whitney had never spoken after that first interchange of volleys with the rustlers. He died bravely at the post of duty and was tenderly borne homeward, where he was given a decent burial, his grave bedewed not only by the tears of the stricken widow and children, but by those of the stern, hardy cowmen to whom he had been an employer as kind and indulgent as he was brave.  A few paragraphs are necessary to explain the incidents that follow.  Wherever cattlemen have organized outfits and located ranches cattle-thieves have followed, and fierce fighting has resulted. These men are known as \"rustlers.\" The late troubles caused cattle and horse-thieves to unite against the legitimate owners, and the name now includes both classes of evil-doers. The troubles in Wyoming were the results of the efforts of the Wyoming State Live Stock Association to put a check upon rustlers who are tempted to steal by the vast profits afforded.  At the time the Association was formed the rustlers were few in number, and confined their acts to branding the mavericks or unbranded yearlings with their own brands. They did not act in concert, and since the laws of the State require every brand to be registered, in order to establish ownership, the rustlers had as much right to their own brands as the legitimate cowmen. As long as the mavericks were not openly branded there was no means of stopping them.  It happens quite often that the round-up fails to gather in all the cattle. The mavericks are allowed to go to the outfit with whose cattle they have run, and that outfit puts its own brand on them.  The rustlers grew more daring as their numbers increased, and, instead of confining their operations to the mavericks, began altering brands. Not only that, but they were often bold enough to leave the old brand and burn a new one and forge a bill of sale.  The rustlers were generally the owners of small ranches, or cowboys who had a few head of cattle on the range or running with some rancher's stock. The Association made a rule that no cow outfit should employ a cowman that had been guilty of branding a maverick, or of helping the rustlers, or of working with or for them. A blacklist was kept of such cowmen, with the result that a good many were unable to get employment from the Association outfits and were compelled to become rustlers themselves.  The association of rustlers became desperate because of the serious check given them by the Live Stock Association, which placed its inspectors at all the cattle-markets, Omaha, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and St. Paul. Every shipment of cattle was closely inspected, and if it came from a rustler he was obliged to prove his title to each steer, or they were confiscated and the proceeds sent to the owner of the brand. Sometimes a legal proof of ownership would not be accepted, for the owners were determined to stamp out the rustling business.  Deprived by this means of a market for their hoof cattle, the rustlers were compelled to butcher their cattle or drive to Montana. The latter recourse was not only difficult and dangerous, but there was no certainty of a market when accomplished, as the Live Stock Association kept a vigilant watch on all Wyoming cattle.  The other scheme was unsatisfactory, but it was all that was left to the rustlers. They employed a number of butchers at Buffalo to do their killing for them, but even then they were not sure of always getting their meat marketed.  In the summer of 1891 the rustlers ran waggons openly on all the three great round-ups, and worked the round-up "]]]
