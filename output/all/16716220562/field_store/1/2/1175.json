He got on his horse and started to ride up and find out what it was, riding way around it, through the hills and ravines, so that he would not be seen. He rode up in a ravine behind it, pretty near to it, and then he could see it was a person on foot. He got out his bow and arrows and held them ready to use, and then started to ride up to it. He rode toward the person, and at last he got near enough to see that it was his wife. When he saw this, he could not help crying; and as he rode up, the woman looked back, and knew first the horse, and then her husband, and she was so glad that she fell down and knew nothing.  After she had come to herself and they had talked together, they got on the horse and rode off toward camp. When he came over the hill in sight of camp, all the people began to say, \"Here comes the man\"; and at last they could see from a distance that he had some one on the horse behind him, and they knew that it must be his wife, and they were glad to see him bringing her back, for he was a man thought a great deal of, and everybody liked him and liked his wife and the way he was kind to her.  Then the handsome girl was given to the medicine man and became his wife.    ADVENTURES OF BULL TURNS ROUND   I  Once the camp moved, but one lodge stayed. It belonged to Wolf Tail; and Wolf Tail's younger brother, Bull Turns Round, lived with him. Now their father loved both his sons, but he loved the younger one most, and when he went away with the big camp, he said to Wolf Tail: \"Take care of your young brother; he is not yet a strong person. Watch him that nothing befall him.\"  One day Wolf Tail was out hunting, and Bull Turns Round sat in front of the lodge making arrows, and a beautiful strange bird lit on the ground before him. Then cried one of Wolf Tail's wives, \"Oh, brother, shoot that little bird.\" \"Don't bother me, sister,\" he replied, \"I am making arrows.\" Again the woman said, \"Oh, brother, shoot that bird for me.\" Then Bull Turns Round fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the bird, and the woman went and picked it up and stroked her face with it, and her face swelled up so big that her eyes and nose could not be seen. But when Bull Turns Round had shot the bird, he went off hunting and did not know what had happened to the woman's face.  Now when Wolf Tail came home and saw his wife's face, he said, \"What is the matter?\" and his wife replied: \"Your brother has pounded me so that I cannot see. Go now and kill him.\" But Wolf Tail said, \"No, I love my brother; I cannot kill him.\" Then his wife cried and said: \"I know you do not love me; you are glad your brother has beaten me. If you loved me, you would go and kill him.\"  Then Wolf Tail went out and looked for his brother, and when he had found him, he said: \"Come, let us get some feathers. I know where there is an eagle's nest;\" and he took him to a high cliff, which overhung the river, and on the edge of this cliff was a dead tree, in the top of which the eagles had built their nest. Then said Wolf Tail, \"Climb up, brother, and kill the eagles;\" and when Bull Turns Round had climbed nearly to the top, Wolf Tail called out, \"I am going to push the tree over the cliff, and you will be killed.\"  \"Oh, brother! oh, brother! pity me; do not kill me,\" said Bull Turns Round.  \"Why did you beat my wife's face so?\" said Wolf Tail.  \"I didn't,\" cried the boy; \"I don't know what you are talking about.\"  \"You lie,\" said Wolf Tail, and he pushed the tree over the cliff. He looked over and saw his brother fall into the water, and he did not come up again. Then Wolf Tail went home and took down his lodge, and went to the main camp. When his father saw him coming with only his wives, he said to him, \"Where is your young brother?\" And Wolf Tail replied: \"He went hunting and did not come back. We waited four days for him. I think the bears must have killed him.\"   II  Now when Bull Turns Round fell into the river, he was stunned, and the water carried him a long way down the stream and finally lodged him on a sand shoal. Near this shoal was a lodge of Under Water People (_S[=u]'-y[=e]-t[)u]p'-pi_), an old man, his wife, and two daughters. This old man was very rich: he had great flocks of geese, swans, ducks, and other water-fowl, and a big herd of buffalo which were tame. These buffalo always fed near by, and the old man called them every evening to come and drink. But he and his family ate none of these. Their only food was the bloodsucker.[1]  [Footnote 1: Blackfoot--_Est'-st[)u]k-ki_, suck-bite; from _Est-ah-tope_, suck, and _I-sik-st[)u]k-ki_, bite.]  Now the old man's daughters were swimming about in the evening, and they found Bull Turns Round lying on the shoal, dead, and they went home and told their father, and begged him to bring the person to life, and give him to them for a husband. \"Go, my daughters,\" he said, \"and make four sweat lodges, and I will bring the person.\" He went and got Bull Turns Round, and when the sweat lodges were finished, the old man took him into one of them, and when he had sprinkled water on the hot rocks, he scraped a great quantity of sand off Bull Turns Round. Then he took him into another lodge and did the same thing, and when he had taken him into the fourth sweat lodge and scraped all the sand off him, Bull Turns Round came to life, and the old man led him out and gave him to his daughters. And the old man gave his son-in-law a new lodge and bows and arrows, and many good presents.  Then the women cooked some bloodsuckers, and gave them to their husband, but when he smelled of them he could not eat, and he threw them in the fire. Then his wives asked him what he would eat. \"Buffalo,\" he replied, \"is the only meat for men.\"  \"Oh, father!\" cried the girls, running to the old man's lodge, \"our husband will not eat our food. He says buffalo is the only meat for men.\"  \"Go then, my daughters,\" said the old man, \"and tell your husband to kill a buffalo, but do not take nor break any bones, for I will make it alive again.\" Then the old man called the buffalo to come and drink, and Bull Turns Round shot a fat cow and took all the meat. And when he had roasted the tongue, he gave each of his wives a small piece of it, and they liked it, and they roasted and ate plenty of the meat.    III  One day Bull Turns Round went to the old man and said, \"I mourn for my father.\"  \"How did you come to be dead on the sand shoal?\" asked the old man. Then Bull Turns Round told what his brother had done to him.  \"Take this piece of sinew,\" said the old man. \"Go and see your father. When you throw this sinew on the fire, your brother and his wife will roll, and twist up and die.\" Then the old man gave him a herd of buffalo, and many dogs to pack the lodge, and other things; and Bull Turns Round took his wives, and went to find his father.  One day, just after sunset, they came in sight of the big camp, and they went and pitched the lodge on the top of a very high butte; and the buffalo fed close by, and there were so many of them that they covered the whole hill.  Now the people were starving, and some had died, for they had no buffalo. In the morning, early, a man arose whose son had starved to death, and when he went out and saw this lodge on the top of the hill, and all the buffalo feeding by it, he cried out in a loud voice; and the people all came out and looked at it, and they were afraid, for they thought it was _St[=o]n'-i-t[)a]p-i_.[1] Then said the man whose son had died: \"I am no longer glad to live. I will go up to this lodge, and find out what this is.\" Now when he said this, all the men grasped their bows and arrows and followed him, and when they went up the hill, the buffalo just moved out of their path and kept on feeding; and just as they came to the lodge, Bull Turns Round came out, and all the people said, \"Here is the one whom we thought the bears had killed.\" Wolf Tail ran up, and said, \"Oh, brother, you are not dead. You went to get feathers, but we thought you had been killed.\" Then Bull Turns Round called his brother into the lodge, and he threw the sinew on the fire; and Wolf Tail, and his wife, who was standing outside, twisted up and died.  [Footnote 1: There is no word in English which corresponds to this. It is used when speaking of things wonderful or supernatural.]  Then Bull Turns Round told his father all that had happened to him; and when he learned that the people were starving, he filled his mouth with feathers and blew them out, and the buffalo ran off in every direction, and he said to the people, \"There is food, go chase it.\" Then the people were very glad, and they came each one and gave him a present. They gave him war shirts, bows and arrows, shields, spears, white robes, and many curious things.     K[)U]T-O'-YIS  Long ago, down where Two Medicine and Badger Creeks come together, there lived an old man. He had but one wife and two daughters. One day there came to his camp a young man who was very brave and a great hunter. The old man said: \"Ah! I will have this young man to help me. I will give him my daughters for wives.\" So he gave him his daughters. He also gave this son-in-law all his wealth, keeping for himself only a little lodge, in which he lived with his old wife. The son-in-law lived in a lodge that was big and fine.  At first the son-in-law was very good to the old people. Whenever he killed anything, he gave them part of the meat, and furnished plenty of robes and skins for their bedding and clothing. But after a while he began to be very mean to them.  Now the son-in-law kept the buffalo hidden under a big log jam in the river. Whenever he wanted to kill anything, he would have the old man go to help him; and the old man would stamp on the log jam and frighten the buffalo, and when they ran out, the young man would shoot one or two, never killing wastefully. But often he gave the old"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547"],["title","Blackfoot Lodge Tales: The Story of a Prairie People (#6)"],["body","nothing to eat, and they were hungry all the time, and began to grow thin and weak.  One morning, the young man called his father-in-law to go down to the log jam and hunt with him. They started, and the young man killed a fat buffalo cow. Then he said to the old man, \"Hurry back now, and tell your children to get the dogs and carry this meat home, then you can have something to eat.\" And the old man did as he had been ordered, thinking to himself: \"Now, at last, my son-in-law has taken pity on me. He will give me part of this meat.\" When he returned with the dogs, they skinned the cow, cut up the meat and packed it on the dog travois, and went home. Then the young man had his wives unload it, and told his father-in-law to go home. He did not give him even a piece of liver. Neither would the older daughter give her parents anything to eat, but the younger took pity on the old people and stole a piece of meat, and when she got a chance threw it into the lodge to the old people. The son-in-law told his wives not to give the old people anything to eat. The only way they got food was when the younger woman would throw them a piece of meat unseen by her husband and sister.  Another morning, the son-in-law got up early, and went and kicked on the old man's lodge to wake him, and called him to get up and help him, to go and pound on the log jam to drive out the buffalo, so that he could kill some. When the old man pounded on the jam, a buffalo ran out, and the son-in-law shot it, but only wounded it. It ran away, but at last fell down and died. The old man followed it, and came to where it had lost a big clot of blood from its wound. When he came to where this clot of blood was lying on the ground, he stumbled and fell, and spilled his arrows out of his quiver; and while he was picking them up, he picked up also the clot of blood, and hid it in his quiver. \"What are you picking up?\" called out the son-in-law. \"Nothing,\" said the old man; \"I just fell down and spilled my arrows, and am putting them back.\" \"Curse you, old man,\" said the son-in-law, \"you are lazy and useless. Go back and tell your children to come with the dogs and get this dead buffalo.\" He also took away his bow and arrows from the old man.  The old man went home and told his daughters, and then went over to his own lodge, and said to his wife: \"Hurry now, and put the kettle on the fire. I have brought home something from the butchering.\" \"Ah!\" said the old woman, \"has our son-in-law been generous, and given us something nice?\" \"No,\" answered the old man; \"hurry up and put the kettle on.\" When the water began to boil, the old man tipped his quiver up over the kettle, and immediately there came from the pot a noise as of a child crying, as if it were being hurt, burnt or scalded. They looked in the kettle, and saw there a little boy, and they quickly took it out of the water. They were very much surprised. The old woman made a lashing to put the child in, and then they talked about it. They decided that if the son-in-law knew that it was a boy, he would kill it, so they resolved to tell their daughters that the baby was a girl. Then he would be glad, for he would think that after a while he would have it for a wife. They named the child K[)u]t-o'-yis (Clot of Blood).  The son-in-law and his wives came home, and after a while he heard the child crying. He told his youngest wife to go and find out whether that baby was a boy or a girl; if it was a boy, to tell them to kill it. She came back and told them that it was a girl. He did not believe this, and sent his oldest wife to find out the truth of the matter. When she came back and told him the same thing, he believed that it was really a girl. Then he was glad, for he thought that when the child had grown up he would have another wife. He said to his youngest wife, \"Take some pemmican over to your mother; not much, just enough so that there will be plenty of milk for the child.\"  Now on the fourth day the child spoke, and said, \"Lash me in turn to each one of these lodge poles, and when I get to the last one, I will fall out of my lashing and be grown up.\" The old woman did so, and as she lashed him to each lodge pole he could be seen to grow, and finally when they lashed him to the last pole, he was a man. After K[)u]t-o'-yis had looked about the inside of the lodge, he looked out through a hole in the lodge covering, and then, turning round, he said to the old people: \"How is it there is nothing to eat in this lodge? I see plenty of food over by the other lodge.\" \"Hush up,\" said the old woman, \"you will be heard. That is our son-in-law. He does not give us anything at all to eat.\" \"Well,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"where is your pis'kun?\" The old woman said, \"It is down by the river. We pound on it and the buffalo come out.\"  Then the old man told him how his son-in-law abused him. \"He has taken my weapons from me, and even my dogs; and for many days we have had nothing to eat, except now and then a small piece of meat our daughter steals for us.\"  \"Father,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"have you no arrows?\" \"No, my son,\" he replied; \"but I have yet four stone points.\"  \"Go out then and get some wood,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis. \"We will make a bow and arrows. In the morning we will go down and kill something to eat.\"  Early in the morning K[)u]t-o'-yis woke the old man, and said, \"Come, we will go down now and kill when the buffalo come out.\" When they had reached the river, the old man said: \"Here is the place to stand and shoot. I will go down and drive them out.\" As he pounded on the jam, a fat cow ran out, and K[)u]t-o'-yis killed it.  Meantime the son-in-law had gone out, and as usual knocked on the old man's lodge, and called to him to get up and go down to help him kill. The old woman called to him that her husband had already gone down. This made the son-in-law very angry. He said: \"I have a good mind to kill you right now, old woman. I guess I will by and by.\"  The son-in-law went on down to the jam, and as he drew near, he saw the old man bending over, skinning a buffalo. \"Old man,\" said he, \"stand up and look all around you. Look well, for it will be your last look.\" Now when he had seen the son-in-law coming, K[)u]t-o'-yis had lain down and hidden himself behind the buffalo's carcass. He told the old man to say to his son-in-law, \"You had better take your last look, for I am going to kill you, right now.\" The old man said this. \"Ah!\" said the son-in-law, \"you make me angrier still, by talking back to me.\" He put an arrow to his bow and shot at the old man, but did not hit him. K[)u]t-o'-yis told the old man to pick up the arrow and shoot it back at him, and he did so. Now they shot at each other four times, and then the old man said to K[)u]t-o'-yis: \"I am afraid now. Get up and help me.\" So K[)u]t-o'-yis got up on his feet and said: \"Here, what are you doing? I think you have been badly treating this old man for a long time.\"  Then the son-in-law smiled pleasantly, for he was afraid of K[)u]t-o'-yis. \"Oh, no,\" he said, \"no one thinks more of this old man than I do. I have always taken great pity on him.\"  Then K[)u]t-o'-yis said: \"You lie. I am going to kill you now.\" He shot him four times, and the man died. Then K[)u]t-o'-yis told the old man to go and bring down the daughter who had acted badly toward him. He did so, and K[)u]t-o'-yis killed her. Then he went up to the lodges and said to the younger woman, \"Perhaps you loved your husband.\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"I love him.\" So he killed her, too. Then he said to the old people: \"Go over there now, and live in that lodge. There is plenty there to eat, and when it is gone I will kill more. As for myself, I will make a journey around about. Where are there any people? In what direction?\" \"Well,\" said the old man, \"up above here on Badger Creek and Two Medicine, where the pis'kun is, there are some people.\"  K[)u]t-o'-yis went up to where the pis'kun was, and saw there many lodges of people. In the centre of the camp was a large lodge, with a figure of a bear painted on it. He did not go into this lodge, but went into a very small one near by, where two old women lived; and when he went in, he asked them for something to eat. They set before him some lean dried meat and some belly fat. \"How is this?\" he asked. \"Here is a pis'kun with plenty of fat meat and back fat. Why do you not give me some of that?\" \"Hush,\" said the old women. \"In that big lodge near by, lives a big bear and his wives and children. He takes all those nice things and leaves us nothing. He is the chief of this place.\"  Early in the morning, K[)u]t-o'-yis told the old women to get their dog travois, and harness it, and go over to the pis'kun, and that he was going to kill for them some fat meat. He reached there just about the time the buffalo were being driven in, and shot a cow, which looked very scabby, but was really very fat. Then he helped the old women to butcher, and when they had taken the meat to camp, he said to them, \"Now take all the choice fat pieces, and hang them up so that those who live in the bear lodge will notice them.\"  They did this, and pretty soon the old chief bear said to his children: \"Go out now, and look around. The people have finished killing by this time. See where the nicest pieces are, and bring in some nice back fat.\" A young bear went out of the lodge, stood up and looked around, and when it saw this meat close by, at the old women's lodge, it went over and began to pull it down. \"Hold on there,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis. \"What are you doing here, taking the old women's meat?\" and he hit him over the head with a stick that he had. The young bear ran home crying, and said to his father, \"A young man has hit me on the head.\" Then all the bears, the father and mother, and uncles and aunts, and all the relations, were very angry, and all rushed out toward the old women's lodge.  K[)u]t-o'-yis killed them all, except one little child bear, a female, which escaped."]]]
