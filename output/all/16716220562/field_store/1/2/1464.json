Not long after this a total change of the ministry ensued, the statesmen to whom she had been obnoxious were removed, and consequently all her fears upon that score dissipated; her native gaiety, and good humour returned, and she again employed herself in writing a tragedy for the stage, and resolved never more to deal in politics, as being much out of the natural sphere of a woman, she was persuaded it was folly in one in her station, to disoblige any party by a pen, equally qualified to divert all. Being advanced to the autumn of her charms, she conversed with the opposite sex, in a manner very delicate, sensible, and agreeable, and when she felt that time had left his impression upon her brow, she did not court praise and flattery. The greatest genius's of the times conversed freely with her, and gave her daily proofs of esteem, and friendship, except Sir Richard Steele, with whom it seems she was at variance; and indeed Sir Richard sufficiently exposed himself by his manner of taking revenge; for he published to the world that it was his own fault he was not happy with Mrs. Manley, for which omission he publickly, and gravely asked her pardon.  Those are the most material incidents in the life of our poetess; a lady, who was born with high powers from nature, which were afterwards cultivated by enjoying the brightest conversation; the early part of her life was unfortunate, she fell a sacrifice to a seducer, who laid the foundation for those errors she afterwards committed, and of those sufferings she underwent; she had a high relish for the pleasures of life; she was extremely susceptible of the passion of love, and treated it with a peculiar vivacity.  Her dramatic works are  1. The Lover, or The Jealous Husband; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1696. This play did not succeed in the representation.  2. The Royal Mischief, a Tragedy; acted by his Majesty's Servants in the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1696. This was exhibited with general applause.  3. Lucius, the First Christian King of Britain, a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane by his Majesty's Servants, and dedicated to Sir Richard Steele. She has written several poems, and we shall select, as a specimen, an Epistle to the Countess of Bristol, which will shew how much she possessed the power of delicate numbers; she has also in print a volume of Letters, the second edition of which was published in 1713. She died July 11, 1724.    To the Right Honourable the   Countess of BRISTOL.       Long had my mind, unknowing how to soar,   In humble prose been train'd, nor aim'd at more:   Near the fam'd sisters never durst aspire   To sound a verse, or touch the tuneful lyre.   'Till Bristol's charms dissolv'd the native cold;   Bad me survey her eyes, and thence be bold.   Thee, lovely Bristol! thee! with pride I chuse,   The first, and only subject of my muse;   That durst transport me like the bird of Jove,   To face th' immortal source of light above!   Such are thy kindred beams--   So blessings, with a bounteous hand they give,   So they create, and make creation live.      When charming Felton, of a beauteous race,   Adorn'd in blooming youth, with ev'ry grace;   First saw the lovely Suffolk Swain her prize,   The noblest conquest of the brightest eyes!   How many wretched nymphs that union made,   What cold despair the warmest hearts invade!   What crouds of lovers, hopeless and undone,   Deplore those charms which brought their ruin on!   Rich in themselves--all excellence they find,   Wit! beauty! wisdom! and a constant mind!   No vain desires of change disturb their joy;   Such sweets, like bliss divine, can never cloy:   Fill'd with that spirit which great souls inflame,   Their wondrous offspring start to early fame.   In their young minds, immortal sparkles rise!   And all their mother flashes from their eyes!   From thence such scenes of beauty charm the sight,   We know not where o fix the strong delight!   Hervey's soft features--next, Eliza bright!   Anna just dawning, like Aurora's light!   With all the smiling train of Cupids round,   Fond little loves, with flowing graces crown'd.      As some fair flowers, who all their bloom disclose,   The Spanish Jas'min, or the British Rose?   Arriv'd at full perfection, charm the sense,   Whilst the young blossoms gradual sweets dispense.   The eldest born, with almost equal pride;   The next appears in fainter colours dy'd:   New op'ning buds, as less in debt to time,   Wait to perform the promise of their prime!   All blest descendants of the beauteous tree,   What now their parent is, themselves shall be.      Oh! could I paint the younger Hervey's mind,   Where wit and judgment, fire and taste refin'd   To match his face, with equal art are join'd:   Oh best belov'd of Jove! to thee alone,   What would enrich the whole, he gives to one!      [A]In Titian's colours whilst Adonis glows,   See fairest Bristol more than Venus shows;   View well the valu'd piece, how nice each part;   Yet nature's hand surpasses Titian's art!   Such had his Venus and Adonis been,   The standard beauty had from thence been seen!   Whose arbitrary laws had fix'd the doom   To Hervey's form, and Bristol's ever bloom!      [B]As once Kazeia, now Eliza warms   The kindred-fair bequeath'd her all her charms;   Such were her darts, so piercing and so strong,   Endow'd by Phoebus both, with tuneful song;   But far from thee Eliza be her doom;   Snatch'd hence by death, in all her beauty's bloom.   Long may'st thou live, adorning Bristol's name,   With future heroes to augment his fame.      When haughty Niobe, with joy and pride,   Saw all her shining offspring grace her side;   She view'd their charms, exulting at each line,   And then oppos'd 'em to the race divine!   Enrag'd Latona urg'd the silver bow:   Immortal vengeance laid their beauties low.   No more a mother now--too much she mourn'd,   By grief incessant into marble turn'd.      But lovely Bristol, with a pious mind,   Owns all her blessings are from Heav'n assign'd.   Her matchless Lord--her beauteous numerous race!   Her virtue, modesty, and ev'ry grace!   For these, devoutly, to the gods she bows,   And offers daily praise, and daily vows:   Phoebus, well-pleas'd, the sacrifice regards;   And thus the grateful mother's zeal rewards:   'Beauty and wit, to all of Bristol's line!   But each in some peculiar grace shall shine!   Or to excel in courts, and please the fair!   Or Conquest gain thro' all the wat'ry war!   With harmony divine the ear to charm!   Or souls with more melodious numbers warm!   By wond'rous memory shall some excel   In awful senates, and in speaking well!   To hold Astr√¶a's scales with equal hand,   And call back justice to that happy land!   To teach mankind how best the gods to praise!   To fix their minds in truth's unerring ways!      'Thus all her honours, Bristol's sons shall wear,   Whilst each his country's good shall make his chiefest care!'

He was removed from thence in 1705, and in 1708 accepted a small place in a public office; where he continued the remainder of his days.  About this time contracting a friendship with a gentleman of a like taste, who furnished him with proper books, he applied himself at his intervals of leisure, to reading the dailies, and to the study of logic, metaphysics, and the mathematics, with which last he was peculiarly delighted. And in a few years by the force of his own happy genius, and unwearied diligence, without the assistance of any master, he acquired a considerable knowledge of the most difficult branches of those useful and entertaining studies.  By so close an application, he contracted a violent pain in his head, which notwithstanding the best advice, daily encreased. This, and other unfortunate circumstances concurring, so deeply affected him, who had besides in his constitution a strong tincture of melancholy, that he was at last brought under almost a total extinction of reason. In this condition he fell into a fever; and as there were before scarce any hopes of him, it may be said to have happily put an end to the deplorable bondage of so bright a mind, on the 21st of December, 1718, in the 29th year of his age. He was buried in the church of Friendsbury, near Rochester.  Mr. Needler's life was influenced by the principles of sincere, unaffected piety, and virtue.  On all occasions (says Mr. Duncomb) 'he was a strenuous advocate for universal toleration and forbearance in matters of religion; rightly supposing that no service can be acceptable to the supreme Being, unless it proceeds from the heart; and that force serves only to make hypocrites, but adds no new lights to the understanding. He was modest to a fault, entertaining the most humble opinion of his own performances; and was always ready to do justice to those of others. His affection for his friends indeed sometimes biassed his judgment, and led him to the commending their writings beyond their merit.'  In the volume of Mr. Needler's works, are printed some familiar Letters, upon moral, and natural subjects. They are written with elegance and taste; the heart of a good man may be traced in them all, and equally abound with pious notions, as good sense, and solid reasoning.--He seems to have been very much master of smooth versification, his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],["title","The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV.

Dress'd in the charms of wit and fancy, long   The muse has pleas'd us with her syren song;   But weak of reason, and deprav'd of mind,   Too oft on vile, ignoble themes we find   The wanton muse her sacred art debase,   Forgetful of her birth, and heavenly race;   Too oft her flatt'ring songs to sin intice,   And in false colours deck delusive vice;   Too oft she condescends, in servile lays,   The undeserving rich and great to praise.   These beaten paths, thy loftier strains refuse   With just disdain, and nobler subjects chuse:   Fir'd with sublimer thoughts, thy daring soul   Wings her aspiring flight from Pole to Pole,   Observes the foot-steps of a pow'r divine,   Which in each part of nature's system shine;   Surveys the wonders of this beauteous frame,   And sings the sacred source, whence all things came.      But Oh! what numbers shall I find to tell,   The mighty transports which my bosom swell,   Whilst, guided by thy tuneful voice, I stray   Thro' radiant worlds, and fields of native day,   Wasted from orb, to orb, unwearied fly   Thro' the blue regions of the yielding sky;   See how the spheres in stated courses roll,   And view the just composure of the whole!      Such were the strains, by antient Orpheus sung.   To such, Muf√¶us' heav'nly lyre was strung;   Exalted truths, in learned verse they told,   And nature's deepest secrets did unfold.   How at th' eternal mind's omnisic call,   Yon starry arch, and this terrestrial ball,   The briny wave, the blazing source of light,   And the wane empress of the silent night,   Each in it's order rose and took its place,   And filled with recent forms the vacant space;   How rolling planets trace their destin'd way,   Nor in the wastes of pathless √Üther stray;   How the pale moon, with silver beams adorn   Her chearful orb, and gilds her sharpened horns;   How the vast ocean's swelling tides obey   Her distant reign, and own her watr'y sway;   How erring floods, their circling course maintain,   Supplied by constant succours from the main;   Whilst to the sea, the refluent streams restore,   The liquid treasures which she lent before;   What dreadful veil obscures the solar light,   And Ph√¶be's darken'd face conceals from mortal sight.   Thy learned muse, I with like pleasure hear   The wonders of the lesser world declare,   Point out the various marks of skill divine,   Which thro' its complicated structure mine,   In tuneful verse, the vital current trace,   Thro' all the windings of its mazy race,   And tell hew the rich purple tide bestows,   Vigour, and kindly warmth where e'er it flows;   By what contrivance of mechanic art   The muscles, motions to the limbs impart;   How at th' imperial mind's impulsive nod,   Th' obedient spirits thro' the nervous road   Find thro' their fib'rous cells the ready way,   And the high dictates of the will obey;   From how exact and delicate a frame,   The channeled bones their nimble action claim;   With how much depth, and subtility of thought   The curious organ of the eye is wrought;   How from the brain their root the nerves derive,   And sense to ev'ry distant member give.      Th' extensive knowledge you of men enjoy,   You to a double use of man employ;   Nor to the body, is your skill confin'd,   Of error's worse disease you heal the mind.   No longer shall the hardy atheist praise   Lucretius' piercing wit, and philosophic lays;   But by your lines convinc'd, and charm'd at once,   His impious tenets shall at length renounce,   At length to truth and eloquence shall yield,   Confess himself subdu'd, and wisely quit the field.   [Footnote A: See his Life prefixed to his works, by William Duncomb Esq;]         *       *       *       *       *     JOHN HUGHES,   William Duncomb, esq; has obliged the world with an entire edition of this author's poetical and prose works, to which he has prefixed some account of his life, written with candour and spirit. Upon his authority we chiefly build the following narration; in which we shall endeavour to do as much justice as possible to the memory of this excellent poet.  Our author was the son of a worthy citizen of London, and born at Marlborough in the county of Wilts, on the 29th of January 1677; but received the rudiments of his learning at private schools in London.  In the earliest years of his youth, he applied himself with ardour to the pursuit of the sister arts, poetry, drawing and music, in each of which by turns, he made a considerable progress; but for the most part pursued these and other polite studies, only as agreeable amusements, under frequent confinement from indisposition, and a valetudinary state of health. He had some time an employment in the office of ordinance; and was secretary to two or three commissioners under the great-seal, for purchasing lands for the better securing the docks and harbours at Portsmouth, Chatham, and Harwich.  In the year 1717 the lord chancellor Cowper, (to whom Mr. Hughes was then but lately known) was pleased, without any previous sollicitation, to make him his secretary for the commissions of the peace, and to distinguish him with singular marks of his favour and affection: And upon his lordship's laying down the great-seal, he was at his particular recommendation, and with the ready concurrence of his successor, continued in the same employment under the earl of Macclesfield.  He held this place to the time of his decease, which happened on the 17th of February 1719, the very night in which his tragedy, entitled the Siege of Damascus, was first acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane.  He was cut off by a consumption, after a painful life, at the age of 42, when he had just arrived at an agreeable competence, and advancing in fame and fortune. So just is the beautiful reflexion of Milton in his Lycidas;    Fame is the spur, that the clear spirit doth raise,     (That last infirmity of noble mind)   To scorn delights, and live laborious days;     But the fair guerdon, when we hops to find,   And think to burst out into sudden blaze,     Comes the blind fury with th' abhorred shears,   And slits the thin-spun life.--  He was privately buried in the vault under the chancel of St. Andrew's Church in Holborn. Mr. Hughes, as a testimony of gratitude to his noble friend, and generous patron, earl Cowper, gave his lordship a few weeks before he died, his picture drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller, which he himself had received from that masterly painter. The value lord Cowper set upon it will be best shewn, by the letter he wrote upon this occasion to Mr. Hughes. As such a testimony from so eminent a person, was considered by himself as one of the highest honours he was capable of receiving, we shall therefore insert it.  24th Jan. 1719-20.  'Sir,  'I thank you for the most acceptable present of your picture, and assure you that none of this age can set a higher value on it than I do, and shall while I live, tho' I am sensible posterity will out-do me in that particular.'  I am with the greatest esteem, and sincerity  Your most affectionate, and oblig'd humble servant  COWPER.  Mr. Hughes was happy in the acquaintance and friendship of several of the greatest men, and most distinguished genius's of the age in which he lived; particularly of the nobleman just now mentioned, the present lord bishop of Winchester, lord chief baron Gilbert, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Addison, Sir Richard Steele, Mr. Southern, Mr. Rowe, &c. and might have justly boasted in the words of Horace    ----me   Cum magnis vixisse, invita fatebitu usque   Invidia.----  Having given this short account of his life, which perhaps is all that is preserved any where concerning him; we shall now consider him, first, as a poet, and then as a prose writer.  The Triumph of Peace was the earliest poem he wrote of any length, that appeared in public. It was written on occasion of the peace of Ryswick, and printed in the year 1677. A learned gentleman at Cambridge, in a letter to a friend of Mr. Hughes's, dated the 28th of February 1697-8, gives the following account of the favourable reception this poem met with there, upon its first publication.  'I think I never heard a poem read with so much admiration, as the Triumph of Peace was by our best critics here, nor a greater character given to a young poet, at his first appearing; no, not even to Mr. Congreve himself. So nobly elevated are his thoughts, his numbers so harmonious, and his turns so fine and delicate, that we cry out with Tully, on a like occasion,    'Nostr√¶ spes altera Rom√¶!'  The Court of Neptune, was written on king William's return from Holland, two years after the peace, in 1699. This Poem was admired for the verification, however, the musical flow of the numbers is its least praise; it rather deserves to be valued for the propriety, and boldness of the figures and metaphors, and the machinery.  The following lines have been justly quoted as an instance of the author's happy choice of metaphors.    As when the golden god, who rules the day,   Drives down his flaming chariot to the sea,   And leaves the nations here, involved in night,   To distant regions he transports his light;   So William's rays by turns, two rations cheer,   And when he sets to them, he rises here.  A friend of Mr. Hughes's soon after the publication of this poem, complimented him upon the choice of his subject, and for the moral sentiments contained in it. 'I am sure (says he) virtue is most for the interest of mankind; and those poets have ever obtained the most honour in the world, who have made that the end and design of their works. A wanton Sappho, or Anacreon, among the ancients, never had the same applause, as a Pindar, or Alexis; nor in the judgment of Horace "]]]
