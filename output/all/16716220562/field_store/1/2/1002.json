The next act of creation, was the formation of a germ, or egg, from which sprang R[=a], the Sun-god, within whose shining form was embodied the almighty power of the divine spirit.  Such was the outline of creation as described by the late Dr. H. Brugsch, and it is curious to see how closely his views coincide with a chapter in the _Papyrus of Nesi Amsu_ preserved in the British Museum. [Footnote: No. 10,188. See my transcript and translation of the whole papyrus in _Archaeologia_ vol. 52, London, 1801.] In the third section of this papyrus we find a work which was written with the sole object of overthrowing [=A]pep, the great enemy of R[=a], and in the composition itself we find two versions of the chapter which describes the creation of the earth and all things therein. The god Neb-er-tcher is the speaker, and he says:--    \"I evolved the evolving of evolutions. I evolved myself under the form   of the evolutions of the god Khepera, which were evolved at the   beginning of all time. I evolved with the evolutions of the god   Khepera; I evolved by the evolution of evolutions--that is to say, I   developed myself from the primeval matter which I made, I developed   myself out of the primeval matter. My name is Ausares (Osiris), the   germ of primeval matter. I have wrought my will wholly in this earth,   I have spread abroad and filled it, I have strengthened it [with] my   hand. I was alone, for nothing had been brought forth; I had not then   emitted from myself either Shu or Tefnut. I uttered my own name, as a   word of power, from my own mouth, and I straightway evolved myself. I   evolved myself under the form of the evolutions of the god Khepera,   and I developed myself out of the primeval matter which has evolved   multitudes of evolutions from the beginning of time. Nothing existed   on this earth then, and I made all things. There was none other who   worked with me at that time. I performed all evolutions there by means   of that divine Soul which I fashioned there, and which had remained   inoperative in the watery abyss. I found no place there whereon to   stand. But I was strong in my heart, and I made a foundation for   myself, and I made everything which was made. I was alone. I made a   foundation for my heart (_or_ will), and I created multitudes of   things which evolved themselves like unto the evolutions of the god   Khepera, and their offspring came into being from the evolutions of   their births. I emitted from myself the gods Shu and Tefnut, and from   being One I became Three; they [Illustration: THE CREATION. The god Nu   rising out of the primeval water and bearing in his hands the boat of   R[=a], the Sun-god, who is accompanied by a number of deities. In the   upper portion of the scene is the region of the underworld which is   enclosed by the body of Osiris, on whose head stands the goddess Nut   with arms stretched out to receive the disk of the sun.] sprang from   me, and came into existence in this earth. ...Shu and Tefnut brought   forth Seb and Nut, and Nut brought forth Osiris, Horus-khent-an-maa,   Sut, Isis, and Nephthya at one birth.\"  The fact of the existence of two versions of this remarkable Chapter proves that the composition is much older than the papyrus [Footnote: About B.C. 300.] in which it is found, and the variant readings which occur in each make it certain that the Egyptian scribes had difficulty in understanding what they were writing. It may be said that this version of the cosmogony is incomplete because it does not account for the origin of any of the gods except those who belong to the cycle of Osiris, and this objection is a valid one; but in this place we are only concerned to shew that R[=a], the Sun-god, was evolved from the primeval abyss of water by the agency of the god Khepera, who brought this result about by pronouncing his own name. The great cosmic gods, such as Ptah and Khnemu, of whom mention will be made later, are the offspring of another set of religious views, and the cosmogony in which these play the leading parts is entirely different. We must notice, in passing, that the god whose words we have quoted above declares that he evolved himself under the form, of Khepera, and that his name is Osiris, \"the primeval matter of primeval matter,\" and that, as a result, Osiris is identical with Khepera in respect of his evolutions and new births. The word rendered \"evolutions\" is _kheperu_, literally \"rollings\"; and that rendered \"primeval matter\" is _paut_, the original \"stuff\" out of which everything was made. In both versions we are told that men and women came into being from the tears which fell from the \"Eye\" of Khepera, that is to say from the Sun, which, the god says, \"I made take to up its place in my face, and afterwards it ruled the whole earth.\"  We have seen how R[=a] has become the visible type and symbol of God, and the creator of the world and of all that is therein; we may now consider the position which he held with, respect to the dead. As far back as the period of the IVth dynasty, about B.C. 3700, he was regarded as the great god of heaven, and the king of all the gods, and divine beings, and of the beatified dead who dwelt therein. The position of the beatified in heaven is decided by R[=a], and of all the gods there Osiris only appears to have the power to claim protection for his followers; the offerings which the deceased would make to R[=a] are actually presented to him by Osiris. At one time the Egyptian's greatest hope seems to have been that he might not only become \"God, the son of God,\" by adoption, but that R[=a] would become actually his father. For in the text of Pepi I, [Footnote: Ed. Maspero, line 570.] it is said: \"Pepi is the son of R[=a] who loveth him; and he goeth forth and raiseth himself up to heaven. R[=a] hath begotten Pepi, and he goeth forth and raiseth himself up to heaven. R[=a] hath conceived Pepi, and he goeth forth and raiseth himself up to heaven. R[=a] hath given birth, to Pepi, and he goeth forth and raiseth himself up to heaven.\" Substantially these ideas remained the same from the earliest to the latest times, and R[=a] maintained his position as the great head of the companies, notwithstanding the rise of Amen into prominence, and the attempt to make Aten the dominant god of Egypt by the so-called \"Disk worshippers.\" The following good typical examples of Hymns to R[=a] are taken from the oldest copies of the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead.   I. FROM THE PAPYRUS OF ANI. [Footnote: See _The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p. 3.]    \"Homage to thee, O thou who hast come as Khepera, Khepera the creator   of the gods. Thou risest and thou shinest, and thou makest light to be   in thy mother Nut (_i.e._, the sky); thou art crowned king of the   gods. Thy mother Nut doeth an act of homage unto thee with both her   hands. The laud of Manu (_i.e._, the land where the sun sets)   receiveth thee with satisfaction, and the goddess Ma[=a]t embraceth   thee both, at morn and at eve.

The god Thoth and the goddess Ma[=a]t have marked   out for thee [thy course] for each and every day. Thine enemy the   Serpent hath been given over to the fire, the serpent-fiend Sebau hath   fallen down headlong; his arms have been bound in chains, and thou   hast hacked off his legs; and the sons of impotent revolt shall   nevermore rise up against thee. The Temple of the Aged One [Footnote:   _i.e._, R[=a] of Heliopolis.] (_i.e._, R[=a]) keepeth festival, and   the voice of those who rejoice is in the mighty dwelling. The gods   exult when they see thy rising, O R[=a], and when thy beams flood the   world with light. The Majesty of the holy god goeth forth and   advanceth even unto the land of Manu; he maketh brilliant the earth at   his birth each day; he journeyeth on to the place where he was   yesterday.\"   II.

FROM THE PAPYRUS OF ANI. [Footnote: Plate 20.]  The following beautiful composition, part hymn and part prayer, is of exceptional interest.    \"Hail, thou Disk, thou lord of rays, who risest on the horizon day by   day! Shine thou with thy beams of light upon the face of Osiris Ani,   who is true of voice; for he singeth hymns of praise unto thee at   dawn, and he maketh thee to set at eventide with words of adoration,   May the soul of Ani come forth with thee into heaven, may he go forth   in the M[=a]tet boat, may he come into port in the Sektet boat, and   may he cleave his path among the never-resting stars in the heavens.    \"Osiris Ani, being in peace and triumph, adoreth his lord, the lord of   eternity, saying, 'Homage to thee, O Heru-Khuti (Harmachis), who art   the god Khepera, the self-created one; when thou risest on the horizon   and sheddest thy beams of light upon the lands of the North and of the   South, thou art beautiful, yea beautiful, and all the gods rejoice   when they behold thee, the king of heaven. The goddess Nebt-Unnut is   stablished upon thy head; and her uraei of the South and of the North   are upon thy brow; she taketh up her place before thee. The god. Thoth   is stablished in the bows of thy boat to destroy utterly all thy foes.   Those who are in the Tuat (underworld) come forth to meet thee, and   they bow low in homage as they come towards thee, to behold thy   beautiful form. And I have come before thee that I may be with thee to   behold thy Disk each day. May I not be shut up [in the tomb], may I   not be turned back, may the limbs of my body be made new again when I   view thy beauties, even as [are those of] all thy favoured ones,   because I am one of those who worshipped thee upon earth. May I come   unto the land of eternity, may I come even unto the everlasting land,   for behold, O my lord, this hast thou ordained for me.'    \"'Homage to thee, O thou who risest in thy horizon as R[=a], thou   restest upon Ma[=a]t, [Footnote: _i.e._, unchanging and unalterable   law.] Thou passest over the sky, and every face watcheth thee and thy   course, for thou hast been hidden from their gaze. Thou dost show   thyself at dawn and at eventide day by day. The Sektet boat, wherein,   is thy Majesty, goeth forth with might; thy beams are upon [all]   faces; thy rays of red and yellow cannot be known, and thy bright   beams cannot be told. The lands of the gods and the eastern lands of   Punt [Footnote: _i.e._, the east and west coasts of the Red Sea, and   the north-east coast of Africa.] must be seen ere that which, is   hidden [in thee] may be measured. [Footnote: I am doubtful about the   meaning of this passage.] Alone and by thyself thou, dost manifest   thyself [when] thou comest into being above Nu. May I advance, even as   thou dost advance; may I never cease [to go forward], even as thy   Majesty ceaseth not [to go forward], even though it be for a moment;   for with strides dost thou in one brief moment pass over spaces which   [man] would need hundreds of thousand; yea, millions of years to pass   over; [this] thou doest, and then thou dost sink to rest. Thou puttest   an end to the hours of the night, and thou dost count them, even thou;   thou endest them in thine own appointed season, and the earth,   becometh light, Thou settest thyself before thy handiwork in the   likeness of R[=a]; thou risest in the horizon.'    \"Osiris; the scribe Ani, declareth his praise of thee when thou   shinest, and when thou risest at dawn he crieth in his joy at thy   birth, saying:--    \"'Thou art crowned with the majesty of thy beauties; thou mouldest thy   limbs as thou dost advance, and thou bringest them forth without   birth-pangs in the form of R[=a], as thou dost rise up in the   celestial height. Grant thou that I may come unto the heaven which is   everlasting, and unto the mountain where dwell thy favoured ones. May   I be joined unto those shining beings, holy and perfect, who are in   the underworld; and may I come forth with them to behold thy beauties   when thou shinest at eventide, and goest to thy mother Nut. Thou dost   place thyself in the west, and my hands adore [thee] when thou settest   as a living being. [Footnote: _i.e._, \"because when thou settest thou   dost not die.\"] Behold, thou art the everlasting creator, and thou art   adored [as such when] thou settest in the heavens. I have given my   heart to thee without wavering, O thou who art mightier than the   gods.'    \"A hymn of praise to thee, O thou who risest like unto gold, and who   dost flood the world with light on the day of thy birth. Thy mother   giveth thee birth, and straightway thou dost give light upon the path   of [thy] Disk, O thou great Light who shinest in the heavens. Thou   makest the generations of men to flourish through the Nile-flood, and   thou dost cause gladness to exist in all lands, and in, all cities,   and in all temples. Thou art glorious by reason of thy splendours, and   thou makest strong thy KA (_i.e._ Double) with, divine foods, O thou   mighty one of victories, thou Power of Powers, who dost make strong   thy throne against evil fiends--thou who art glorious in Majesty in   the Sektet boat, and most mighty in the [=A]tet [Footnote: The Sun's   evening and morning boats respectively.] boat!\" This selection may be   fittingly closed by a short hymn [Footnote: From the Papyrus of Nekht   (Brit. Mus. No. 10,471).] which, though, of a later date, reproduces   in a brief form all the essentials of the longer hymns of the XVIIIth   dynasty (about B.C. 1700 to 1400).    \"Homage to thee, O thou glorious Being, thou who art dowered [with all   sovereignty]. O Temu-Harma-chis, [Footnote: The evening and morning   sun respectively.] when thou risest in the horizon of heaven, a cry of   joy cometh forth, to thee from the mouth of all peoples, O thou   beautiful Being, thou dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of   the Disk within thy mother Hathor; [Footnote: Like Nut, a goddess of   the sky, but particularly of that portion of it in which the sun   rises.] therefore in every place every heart swelleth with joy at thy   rising for ever. The regions of the North and South come to thee with   homage, and send forth, acclamations at thy rising in the horizon of   heaven; thou illuminest the two lands with rays of turquoise light.   Hail, R[=a], thou who art R[=a]-Harmachis, thou divine man-child, heir   of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king of the earth, prince of   the underworld, governor of the regions of Aukert (_i.e._ the   underworld)! Thou didst come forth, from the water, thou hast sprung   from the god Nu, who cherisheth thee and ordereth thy members. Hail,   god of life, thou lord of love, all men live when thou shinest; thou   art crowned king of the gods. The goddess Nut doeth homage unto thee,   and the goddess Ma[=a]t embraceth thee at all times. Those who are in   thy following sing unto thee with joy and bow down their foreheads to   the earth when they meet thee, thou lord of heaven, thou lord of   earth, thou king of Right and Truth, thou lord of eternity, thou   prince of everlastingness, thou sovereign of all the gods, thou god of   life, thou creator of eternity, thou maker of heaven, wherein thou art   firmly established. The company of the gods rejoice at thy rising, the   earth is glad when it beholdeth thy rays; the peoples that have been   long dead come forth with cries of joy to see thy beauties every day.   Thou goest forth each day over heaven and earth, and art made strong   each day by thy mother Nut. Thou passest through the heights of   heaven, thy heart swelleth with joy; the abyss of the sky is content   thereat. The"]]]
