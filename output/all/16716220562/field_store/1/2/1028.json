Let the pincers tear and burn. It is good for him. It will give him a chance to show how strong he is, and how a mighty warrior despises such little things as food and drink.\"  \"I'm not anxious to show myself a mighty warrior just now,\" retorted young Lennox. \"I'd be willing to sacrifice my pride in that respect if I could have carried off some of their bear steaks and venison.\"  \"Come on,\" said Willet, \"and I'll see that you're satisfied. I'm beginning to feel as you do, Robert.\"  Nevertheless he marshaled them forward pretty sternly and they pursued a westward course for many miles before he allowed a halt. Even then they hunted about among the rocks until they found a secluded place, no fire being permitted, at which it pleased Robert to grumble, although he did not mean it.  \"We were better off last night when we had our little fire in the hollow,\" he said.  \"So we were, as far as the body is concerned,\" rejoined Willet, \"but we didn't know then where the Indian camp lay. We've at least increased our knowledge. Now, I'm thinking that you two lads, who have been awake nearly all night and also the half of the morning that has passed, ought to sleep. Time we have to spare, but you know we should practice all the economy we can with our strength. This place is pretty well hidden, and I'll do the watching. Spread your blankets on the leaves, Robert. It's not well even for foresters to sleep on the bare ground. Now draw the other half of it over you. Tayoga has done so already. I'm wondering which of you will get to sleep first. Whoever does will be the better man, a question I've long wanted to decide.\"  But the problem was still left for the future. They fell asleep so nearly at the same time that Willet could tell no difference. He noticed with pleasure their long, regular breathing, and he said to himself, as he had said so often before, that they were two good and brave lads.  Then he made a very comfortable cushion of fallen leaves to sit upon, and remained there a long time, his rifle across his knees.  His eyes were wide open, but no part of his body stirred. He had acquired the gift of infinite patience, and with it the difficult physical art of remaining absolutely motionless for a long time. So thorough was his mastery over himself that the small wild game began to believe by and by that he was not alive. Birds sang freely over his head and the hare hopped through the undergrowth. Yet the hunter saw everything and his very stillness enabled him to listen with all the more acuteness.  The sun which had arisen great and brilliant, remained so, flooding the world with golden lights and making it wonderfully alluring to Willet, whose eyes never grew weary of the forest's varying shades and aspects. They were all peaceful now, but he had no illusions. He knew that the hostile force would send out many hunters. So many men must have much game and presently they would be prowling through the woods, seeking deer and bear. The chief danger came from them.  The hours passed and noon arrived. Willet had not stirred. He did not sleep, but he rested nevertheless. His great body was relaxed thoroughly, and strength, after weariness, flowed back into his veins. Presently his head moved forward a little and his attitude grew more intent. A slight sound that was not a part of the wilderness had come to him. It was very faint, few would have noticed it, but he knew it was the report of a rifle. He knew also that it was not a shot fired in battle. The hunters, as he had surmised, were abroad, and they had started up a deer or a bear.  But Willet did not stir nor did his eyelids flicker. He was used to the proximity of foes, and the distant report did not cause his heart to miss a single beat. Instead, he felt a sort of dry amusement that they should be so near and yet know it not. How Tandakora would have rejoiced if there had been a whisper in his ear that Willet, Robert and Tayoga whom he hated so much were within sound of his rifle! And how he would have spread his nets to catch such precious game!  He heard a second shot presently from the other side, and then the hunter began to laugh softly to himself. His faint amusement was turning into actual and intense enjoyment. The Indian hunters were obviously on every side of them but did not dream that the finest game of all was at hand. They would continue to waste their time on deer and bear while the three formidable rangers were within hearing of their guns.  But the hunter was still silent. His laughter was wholly internal, and his lips did not even move. It showed only in his eye and the general expression of his countenance. A third shot and a fourth came, but no anxiety marred his sense of the humorous.  Then he heard the distant shouts of warriors in pursuit of a wounded bear and still he was motionless.  Willet knew that the French and Tandakora suspected no pursuit. They believed that no American rangers would come among the lofty peaks and ridges south of the border, and he and his comrades could lie in safe hiding while the hunt went on with unabated zeal. But he was sure one day would be sufficient for the task. That portion of the wilderness was full of game, and, since the coming of the war, deer and bear were increasing rapidly. Willet often noted how quickly game returned to regions abandoned by man, as if the wild animals promptly told one another the danger had passed.  Joyous shouts came now and then and he knew that they marked the taking of game, but about the middle of the afternoon the hunt drifted entirely away. A little later Tayoga awoke and sat up. Then Willet moved slightly and spoke.  \"Tandakora's hunters have been all about us while you slept,\" he said, \"but I knew they wouldn't find us.\"  \"Dagaeoga and I were safe in the care of the Great Bear,\" said the Onondaga confidently. \"Tandakora will rage if we tell him some day that we were here, to be taken if he had only seen us. Now Lennox awakes also! O Dagaeoga, you have slept and missed all the great jest.\"  \"What do you mean, Tayoga?\"  \"Tandakora built his fire just beyond the big bush that grows ten feet away, and sat there two hours without suspecting our presence here.\"  \"Now I know you are romancing, Tayoga, because I can see the twinkle in your eyes. But I suspect that what you say bears some remote relation to the truth.\"  \"The hostile hunters passed while you slept, and while I slept also, but the Great Bear was all eyes and ears and he did not think it needful to awaken us.\"  \"What are we going to do now, Dave?\"  \"Eat more venison. We must never fail to keep the body strong.\"  \"And then?\"  \"I'm not sure. I thought once that we'd better go south to our army at Lake George with news of this big band, but it's a long distance down there, and it may be wiser to stay here and watch St. Luc. What do you say, Robert?\"  \"Stay here.\"  \"And you, Tayoga?\"  \"Watch St. Luc.\"  \"I was inclining to that view myself, and it's settled now. But we mustn't move from this place until dark; it would be too dangerous in the day.\"  The lads nodded and the three settled into another long period of waiting.     CHAPTER II   ON THE RIDGES  Late in the afternoon Willet went to sleep and Robert and Tayoga watched, although, as the hunter had done, they depended more upon ear than eye. They too heard now and then the faint report of distant shots from the hunt, and Robert's heart beat very fast, but, if the young Onondaga felt emotion, he did not show it. At twilight, they ate a frugal supper, and when the night had fully come they rose and walked about a little to make their stiffened muscles elastic again.  \"The hunters have all gone back to the camp now,\" said Tayoga, \"since it is not easy to pursue the game by dusk, and we need not keep so close, like a bear in its den.\"  \"And the danger of our being seen is reduced to almost nothing,\" said Robert.  \"It is so, Dagaeoga, but we will have another fight to make. We must strive to keep ourselves from freezing. It turns very cold on the mountains! The wind is now blowing from the north, and do you not feel a keener edge to it?\"  \"I do,\" replied Robert, sensitive of body as well as mind, and he shivered as he spoke. \"It's a most unfortunate change for us. But now that I think of it we've got to expect it up among the high mountains toward Canada. Shall we light another fire?\"  \"We'll talk of that later with the Great Bear when he comes out of his sleep. But it fast grows colder and colder, Dagaeoga!\"  Weather was an enormous factor in the lives of the borderers. Wilderness storms and bitter cold often defeated their best plans, and shelterless men, they were in a continual struggle against them. And here in the far north, among the high peaks and ridges, there was much to be feared, even with official winter yet several weeks away.  Robert began to rub his cold hands, and, unfolding his blanket, he wrapped it about his body, drawing it well up over his neck and ears. Tayoga imitated him and Willet, who was soon awakened by the cold blast, protected himself in a similar manner.  \"What does the Great Bear think?\" asked the Onondaga.  The hunter, with his face to the wind, meditated a few moments before replying.  \"I was testing that current of air on my face and eyes,\" he said, \"and, speaking the truth, Tayoga, I don't like it. The wind seemed to grow colder as I waited to answer you. Listen to the leaves falling before it! Their rustle tells of a bitter night.\"  \"And while we freeze in it,\" said Robert, whose imagination was already in full play, \"the French and Indians build as many and big fires as they please, and cook before them the juicy game they killed today.\"  The hunter was again very thoughtful.  \"It looks as if we would have to kindle a fire,\" he said, \"and tomorrow we shall have to hunt bear or deer for ourselves, because we have food enough left for only one more meal.\"  \"The face of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11311"],["title","The Masters of the Peaks: A Story of the Great North Woods (#4)"],["body","is turned from us,\" said Tayoga. \"We have done something to anger him, or we have failed to do what he wished, and now he sends upon us a hard trial to test us and purify us! A great storm with fierce cold comes!\"  The wind rose suddenly, and it began to make a sinister hissing among all the passes and gorges. Robert felt something damp upon his face, and he brushed away a melting flake of snow. But another and another took its place and the air was soon filled with white. And the flakes were most aggressive. Driven by the storm they whipped the cheeks and eyes of the three, and sought to insert themselves, often with success, under their collars, even under the edges of the protecting blankets, and down their backs. Robert, despite himself, shivered violently and even the hunter was forced to walk vigorously back and forth in the effort to keep warm. It was evident that the Onondaga had told the truth, and that the face of Areskoui was in very fact turned from them.  Robert awaited the word, looking now and then at Willet, but the hunter hung on for a long time. The leaves fell in showers before the storm, making a faint rustling like the last sigh of the departing, and the snow, driven with so much force, stung his face like hail when it struck. He was anxious for a fire, and its vital heat, but he was too proud to speak. He would endure without complaint as much as his comrades, and he knew that Tayoga, like himself, would wait for the older man to speak.  But he could not keep, meanwhile, from thinking of the French and Indians beside their vast heaps of glowing coals, fed and warmed to their hearts' content, while the three lay in the dark and bitter cold of the wilderness. An hour dragged by, then two, then three, but the storm showed no sign of abating. The sinister screaming of the wind did not cease and the snow accumulated upon their bodies. At last Willet said:  \"We must do it.\"  \"We have no other choice,\" said Tayoga. \"We have waited as long as we could to see if Areskoui would turn a favoring face upon us, but his anger holds. It will not avail, if in our endeavor to escape the tomahawk of Tandakora, we freeze to death.\"  The fire decided upon, they took all risks and went about the task with eagerness. Ordinary men could not have lighted it under such circumstances, but the three had uncommon skill upon which to draw. They took the bark from dead wood, and shaved off many splinters, building up a little heap in the lee of a cliff, which they sheltered on the windward side with their bodies. Then Willet, working a long time with his flint and steel, set to it the sparks that grew into a blaze.  Robert did not stop with the fire. Noticing the vast amount of dead wood lying about, as was often the case in the wilderness, he dragged up many boughs and began to build a wall on the exposed side of the flames. Willet and Tayoga approving of the idea soon helped him, and three pairs of willing hands quickly raised the barrier of trunks and brush to a height of at least a yard.  \"A happy idea of yours, Robert,\" said the hunter. \"Now we achieve two ends at once. Our wall hides the glow of the fire and at the same time protects us in large measure from the snow and wind.\"  \"I have bright thoughts now and then,\" said Robert, whose spirits had returned in full tide. \"You needn't believe you and Tayoga have all of 'em. I don't believe either of you would have ever thought of this fine wooden wall. In truth, Dave, I don't know what would become of you and Tayoga if you didn't have me along with you most all the time! How good the fire feels! The warmth touches my fingers and goes stealing up my arms and into my body! It reaches my face too and goes stealing down to meet the fine heat that makes a channel of my fingers! A glorious fire, Tayoga! I tell you, a glorious fire, Dave! The finest fire that's burning anywhere in the world!\"  \"The quality of a fire depends on the service it gives,\" said the hunter.  \"Dagaeoga has many words when he is happy,\" said the Onondaga. \"His tongue runs on like the pleasant murmur of a brook, but he does it because Manitou made him that way. The world must have talkers as well as doers, and it can be said for Lennox that he acts as well as talks.\"  \"Thanks, I'm glad you put in the saving clause,\" laughed Robert. \"But it's a mighty good thing we built our wooden wall. That wind would cut to the bone if it could get at you.\"  \"The wind at least will keep the warriors away,\" said Tayoga. \"They will all stay close in the camp on such a night.\"  \"And no blame to them,\" murmured the hunter. \"If we weren't in the Indian country I'd build our own fire five times as big. Now, Robert, suppose you go to sleep.\"  \"I can't, Dave. You know I slept all the morning, but I'm not suffering from dullness. I'm imagining things. I'm imagining how much worse off we'd be if we didn't have flint and steel. I can always find pleasure in making such contrasts.\"  But he crouched down lower against the cliff, drew his blanket closer and spread both hands over the fire, which had now died down into a glowing mass of coals. He was wondering what they would do on the morrow, when their food was exhausted. They had not only the storm to fight, but possible starvation in the days to come. He foresaw that instead of discovering all the plans of the enemy they would have a struggle merely to live.  \"Areskoui must truly be against us, Tayoga,\" he said. \"Who would have predicted such a storm so early in the season?\"  \"We are several thousand feet above the sea level,\" said Willet, \"and that will account for the violent change. I think the wind and snow will last all tonight, and probably all tomorrow.\"  \"Then,\" said Robert, \"we'd better gather more wood, build our wall higher and save ample fuel for the fire.\"  The other two found the suggestion good, and all three acted upon it promptly, ranging through the forest about them in search of brushwood, which they brought back in great quantities. Robert's blood began to tingle with the activity, and his spirits rose. Now the snow, as it drove against his face, instead of making him shiver, whipped his blood. He was the most energetic of the three, and went the farthest, in the hunt for fallen timber.  One of his trips took him into the mouth of a little gorge, and, as he bent down to seize the end of a big stick, he heard just ahead a rustling that caused him with instinctive caution to straighten up and spring back, his hand, at the same time, flying to the butt of the pistol in his belt. A figure, tall and menacing, emerged from the darkness, and he retreated two or three steps.  It was his first thought that a warrior stood before him, but reason told him quickly no Indian was likely to be there, and, then, through the thick dusk and falling snow, he saw a huge black bear, erect on his hind legs, and looking at him with little red eyes. The animal was so near that the lad could see his expression, and it was not anger but surprise and inquiry. He divined at once that this particular bear had never seen a human being before, and, having been roused from some warm den by Robert's advance, he was asking what manner of creature the stranger and intruder might be.  Robert's first impulse was one of friendliness. It did not occur to him to shoot the bear, although the big fellow, fine and fat, would furnish all the meat they needed for a long time. Instead his large blue eyes gave back the curious gaze of the little red ones, and, for a little space, the two stood there, face to face, with no thought of danger or attack on the part of either.  \"If you'll let me alone I'll let you alone,\" said the lad.  The bear growled, but it was a kindly, reassuring growl.  \"I didn't mean to disturb you. I was looking for wood, not for bear.\"  Another growl, but of a thoroughly placid nature.  \"Go wherever you please and I'll return to the camp with this fallen sapling.\"  A third growl, now ingratiating.  \"It's a cold night, with fire and shelter the chief needs, and you and I wouldn't think of fighting.\"  A fourth growl which clearly disclosed the note of friendship and understanding.  \"We're in agreement, I see. Good night, I wish you well.\"  A fifth growl, which had the tone of benevolent farewell, and the bear, dropping on all fours, disappeared in the brush. Robert, whose fancy had been alive and leaping, returned to the camp rather pleased with himself, despite the fact that about three hundred pounds of excellent food had walked away undisturbed.  \"I ran upon a big bear,\" he said to the hunter and the Onondaga.  \"I heard no shot,\" said Willet.  \"No, I didn't fire. Neither my impulse nor my will told me to do so. The bear looked at me in such brotherly fashion that I could never have sent a bullet into him. I'd rather go hungry.\"  Neither Willet nor Tayoga had any rebuke for him.  \"Doubtless the soul of a good warrior had gone into the bear and looked out at you,\" said the Onondaga with perfect sincerity. \"It is sometimes so. It is well that you did not fire upon him or the face of Areskoui would have remained turned from us too long.\"  \"That's just the way I felt about it,\" said Robert, who had great tolerance for Iroquois beliefs. \"His eyes seemed fully human to me, and, although I had my pistol in my belt and my hand when I first saw him flew to its butt, I made no attempt to draw it. I have no regrets because I let him go.\"  \"Nor have we,\" said Willet. \"Now I think we can afford to rest again. We can build our wall six feet high if we want to and have wood enough left over to feed a fire for several days.\"  The two lads, the white and the red, crouched once more in the lee of the cliff, while the hunter put two fresh sticks on the coals. But little of the snow reached them where they lay, wrapped well in their blankets, and all care disappeared from Robert's mind. Inured to the wilderness he ignored what would have been discomfort to others. The trails they had left in "]]]
