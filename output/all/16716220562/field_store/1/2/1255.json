There was no bowing and scraping to us in that flight into the mountains, I can tell you. It was everyone for himself then, and we were all in the same boat.\" Veronica closed her eyes for a moment and shuddered involuntarily as the horror of that remembered flight overcame her; she threw it off with an effort and presently proceeded in an entirely composed tone. The Winnebagos, looking on with sympathetic understanding, marveled at her perfect poise and great power of self-control.  \"It may seem strange to you girls,\" went on Veronica, \"you who are so patriotic about this American land of yours, that I should talk this way about the land of my birth, and maybe you will despise me. But since I have been in America and have learned that people can live together in a much sweeter, fairer, truer way than I ever dreamed of, I could never go back to the old way. I want to become an American and never wish to leave this country. I don't want to be called a Hungarian. I want to be an American girl like the rest of you. Oh, I think you are the most wonderful girls in the world!\"  She paused to squeeze Sahwah's hand, which rested on the arm of her chair.  \"My uncle feels the same way about it as I do,\" continued Sahwah. \"He became an American citizen ten years ago and is much more proud of his American citizenship than he ever was of his title.\"  \"Did your uncle have a title?\" asked Hinpoha breathlessly.  \"It was a sort of courtesy title,\" answered Veronica, \"because he was the youngest son of the baron, my grandfather, but, of course, he belonged in the family, which put him in the same class with the nobility.\"  \"Was your grandfather a baron?\" asked Hinpoha incredulously.  Veronica nodded casually and went on talking about her uncle.  \"My uncle ran away at the time he became of military age rather than go into the army. All he cared for was music. Of course there was quite a stir about it and he changed his name and took his grandmother's maiden name, which was Lehar. He has now adopted that name legally in this country, and is plain 'Mr. Lehar.'\"  \"Then isn't _your_ name Lehar either?\" asked Hinpoha, while a rustle of surprise went through the group.  \"No,\" replied Veronica in a perfectly matter-of-fact voice, \"I simply assumed that name at his suggestion. You see, as long as I intended to be an American, I wouldn't have any further use for _my_ title either----\"  \"Oh-h-h-h!\" exclaimed the Winnebagos in a long breath of astonishment. \"_Your_ title! Have you got one, too?\"  Veronica looked around with a little look of wonder at the sensation she had created. \"I _did_ have,\" she corrected gently. \"I haven't it any more. I left it behind me in Hungary. I'm just plain Veronica Lehar now.\"  She looked into the girls' faces with a half-questioning, half-pleading expression as if fearful that this confession of her possession of a title would raise a barrier between them.  \"What was your title?\" asked Hinpoha, leaning forward in her chair and immensely impressed.  \"My father was the Baron Szathmar-Vasarhély,\" replied Veronica. \"I was what would be called in English Lady Veronica Szathmar-Vasarhély.\"  \"Lady--what?\" asked Hinpoha in comical bewilderment.  Veronica laughed.  \"Do you wonder why I changed my name when I came to America and took the simple, sensible name of Lehar? Imagine going to school here under the name of Veronica Szathmar-Vasarhély! You can just hear the teachers pronouncing it, can't you? Why, I'd never have any friends at all, because people would rather avoid me than attempt to introduce me to anybody! Besides, it's extravagant to have such a name, it takes so much ink to sign it! Lehar is ever so much more convenient. You can't tell how light and airy I feel since I threw away that long name!\"  \"But Veronica, why didn't you tell us before about this?\" asked Hinpoha. \"We never _dreamed_ your name had ever been anything else but Lehar!\"  \"Because I was afraid you wouldn't take me into your group and treat me as one of yourselves,\" said Veronica simply. \"I did so want to be an American like the rest of you. I was afraid you might object to having a title in your midst. But now you really love me and won't let it make any difference?\" she pleaded wistfully.  \"Of course not, you goose,\" said Sahwah emphatically. \"We love you for yourself and it wouldn't make any difference to us if you had a title as long as a kite tail! Now do you believe it?\" and she bestowed a convincing hug on Veronica that nearly took her breath away.  \"But Veronica,\" said Nyoda, both amused and perplexed, \"is it possible to throw away a title like that? If you were born Lady Veronica Szathmar-Vasarhély can you deliberately say you 'won't be it'? I thought titles either had to be kept or formally transferred to someone else. Until this is done you are still the rightful owner of the title under the law of your country and no one else can claim it.\"  \"They can't make me go back, can they?\" cried Veronica, starting up in alarm.  \"Why, no,\" replied Nyoda reassuringly, \"and I suppose if you want to give up your claim to the title nobody will stop you. I was simply amused at the way you announced that you had 'thrown away' your title and proposed to have nothing further to do with it.\"  \"I won't go back!\" declared Veronica with kindling eyes, springing to her feet and clenching her little fists. \"I won't! I won't! I'm going to be an American, so there! I won't be a baroness!\" Her great black eyes flashed lightnings at the girls, who looked at her in consternation. Veronica, in a passion, was something to strike awe into the breast of the beholder.  \"There aren't any estates left, thank goodness!\" she declared. \"They were all destroyed in the shelling of the town. For all they know over there, I'm dead, too, killed along with dozens of others. How do they know that I escaped on horseback to the Carpathian Mountains and with other refugees traveled across Roumania to the Black Sea and finally found friends who sent me to my uncle in America? Nobody will ever know where all the people of our village went to. Many of them perished in the mountains, many are in other countries. How do they know but what I perished, too? How will they ever know that I am here in America when I go by the name of Lehar? Besides, who would ever take the trouble to look for me when our estates have been swept away by the Russians? I _will_ be an American!\" she finished stormily, and stood looking defiantly at the girls, her head thrown back, her breast heaving, her whole body quivering with passion.  Hinpoha broke up the tension with her usual chatter. \"Tell us about some of the people you knew in Hungary, I mean important ones,\" she asked curiously. Her romantic imagination saw Veronica hob-nobbing with royalty and surrounded by splendors. \"Did you ever see a real prince?\" she asked in a hushed tone.  \"Lots of times,\" replied Veronica in a matter-of-fact way. \"I have often seen royalty riding through the streets in Budapest and Debreczin. Everybody bows while the royal carriage is passing, but I don't believe many people fall in love with princes at first sight! They're hardly ever handsome, not at all like the princes in the fairy tales. They're generally fat and stupid looking.  \"I have met and talked to two princes, both occasions being when I had played at a private musicale at the home of Countess Mariska Esterhazy in Budapest, where I studied in the Conservatory.\"  There was a curious silence among the Winnebagos at these words, which fell so lightly, so conversationally from Veronica's lips. It suddenly seemed to them that although they had known her two years they really did not know her at all! How carelessly she spoke of playing in the home of a countess! And of meeting royalty!  \"Did you really play before the king?\" asked Hinpoha in an awestricken whisper.  Veronica laughed, a jolly, chummy laugh that swept away their momentary feeling of constraint and made her one of themselves again. \"Gracious, no!\" she replied, highly amused. \"I never could play well enough for that! The Countess Mariska was quite a democratic person, and had a great many pupils from the Conservatory as her protegés. Anybody who could play at all stood a good chance of playing at one of her musicales; you didn't need to be a genius at all.\"  Sahwah's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. Although she could play no musical instrument herself and knew less about music than any of the others, she realized, probably better than all the rest, the quality of Veronica's performance on the violin. Sahwah had a mysterious inner perception which made her sense things without knowing why or how. So she knew, although Veronica modestly laid no claim to distinction, that she must have won fame and favor by her playing to a much greater extent than she had ever divulged.  \"Tell us about the princes you met,\" said Hinpoha eagerly, and the Winnebagos leaned forward in an expectant circle.  Veronica's eyes danced as though at some amusing recollection.  \"The first prince I ever met,\" she began, dropping down on the floor beside the spinning wheel in the corner and leaning her head against it, \"was Prince Ferdinand of Negol, which is one of the small Eastern provinces of Hungary. He was an old man, seventy years of age, and he had both the gout and the asthma. He sat with one foot on a cushion on a footstool and when it hurt him he made the awfullest faces. Not a bit like a story book prince, Hinpoha. He was at the Countess Mariska's one afternoon when I played and when I was through he requested that I be presented to him.\"  \"Oh-h-h-h-h!\" exclaimed Hinpoha under her breath in a thrilled tone.  \"The Countess presented me,\" went on Veronica, \"and the prince conversed with me for a few minutes in a wheezy voice. He didn't say anything wonderful, just remarked that I was a good child and had played well and should make the most of my opportunities, and so on. Then his foot"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11664"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls Do Their Bit; Or, Over the Top with the Winnebagos (#6)"],["body"," him a twinge and he made a dreadful face, and the Countess took me by the arm and marched me away.\"  Veronica laughed at the recollection, and the Winnebagos laughed, too, at the picture of the gouty old prince wheezing out paternal advice to the lively Veronica.  \"Go on, tell us about the other one,\" said Hinpoha, plainly disappointed that royalty had turned out to be so ordinary.  \"The other one was a German prince,\" said Veronica, and then laughingly added, \"I don't suppose you care to hear about _him_?\"  \"Oh, come on, tell us about him,\" coaxed the Winnebagos.  \"He was Prince Karl Augustus of Hohenburg,\" replied Veronica. \"He was traveling in Hungary for his health, or rather, for his wife's, and he came to one of the Countess's musicales. He wasn't an ideal prince, either, although he was quite young. He was fat and red-faced and had little beady eyes that made you nervous when he looked at you. After the musicale was over Countess Mariska came to me in a great state of satisfaction and informed me that the prince had enjoyed one piece that I had played so much that he desired me to play it for his wife, who was ill in the hotel. The Countess packed me into her carriage and drove over to the hotel where the prince was staying informally, giving me minute instructions all the way over as to my conduct while there. I played for the princess, who was a thin, melancholy looking woman, and she seemed to enjoy it and thanked me quite graciously. A day or two afterward I received a package by messenger, and it was this little finger ring, a present from the prince and princess. I didn't like the prince, but the ring was very pretty and I have kept it, because the princess probably picked it out and it gave her pleasure to do so. His wife was a Hungarian.\"  She stretched out her hand to the Winnebagos, who crowded eagerly around to examine the small but brilliantly glowing ruby set in a dainty gold band. They had seen it hundreds of times before, but had never guessed it was the gift of a prince. Truly, Veronica was full of surprises!  \"It seems to me, Veronica,\" said Nyoda, \"that you were quite an honored little person in your country, and must have been greatly envied by your friends. How does it come that you are willing to throw away the precedence which you formerly enjoyed on account of your rank and station to become a plain citizen of another country where you have to carve out your place single handed? Don't you really ever have any regrets over it?\"  Veronica shook her head resolutely. \"Not at all,\" she replied in a firm voice. \"After once living in America I could never long to go back to the old life. Since I have become a Camp Fire Girl I have learned that the true nobility is not of birth but of worth, and there should be no other in any country. I promised, you know, when I became a Fire Maker, to tend    'The fire that is called the love of man for man,'  and one cannot do that and live luxuriously on money that one has wrung from the poor instead of earning honestly. No, thank you, I would rather be a democratic American girl and call everyone friend! It's lots more fun, even than being the protegé of a countess! I'd rather be a Torch Bearer than a princess!\"  Veronica's eyes shone with sincerity and fervor, and the Winnebagos were tremendously impressed.  \"Of course you're going to be an American,\" said Sahwah, drawing Veronica to her feet and encircling her with her arm, \"and you're going to be just as honored and distinguished here as you were over there, because you're so wonderful that people can't help making a fuss over you. You're going to become the most wonderful violinist in the country, and people are going to go just wild over you!\"  Sahwah would have poured out more brilliant prophecies, but she was cut short by the sound of a great disturbance without. There was a violent clatter on the brick walk outside, followed by a crashing thump, which was accompanied by the sound of splintering wood.  The Winnebagos started and looked at each other apprehensively. Nyoda sprang to her feet and ran for the door.  \"The Kaiser is out!\" she exclaimed, and seizing an umbrella from the rack in the hall, she disappeared into outer darkness.     CHAPTER V  ENTER THE KAISER   The Winnebagos streamed out after her, and in the moonlight they could see her running around the side of the house, brandishing the umbrella at a large white goat which was prancing before her on his hind legs. Sahwah picked up a good-sized stone from the driveway and rushed to Nyoda's side, ready to hurl it at the creature, under the impression that Nyoda was on the verge of being killed, but at that instant Nyoda suddenly opened the umbrella and the rampant Capricorn dropped to all fours and fled hastily in the direction of the stable.  Nyoda, flushed and laughing, returned to the girls, who were picking up the broken pieces of the white wooden trellis which had supported the rose vine over the front door. \"Is there anything left?\" she inquired, ruefully regarding the heap of kindling wood to which the slender laths had been reduced by the battering ram force of the Kaiser's onslaught.  \"What was it?\" asked Migwan, peering fearfully into the shadows behind the house. Migwan had not caught a clear glimpse of the creature and was still uncertain whether the house had been bombed or a wild elephant had broken loose.  \"That,\" announced Nyoda in a tone both humorous and tragic, and flinging out her hands in a helpless gesture, \"is Bill the Kaiser.\"  \"What is he, a rhinocerous?\" asked Migwan.  \"Would that he were!\" exclaimed Nyoda fervently. \"A rhinocerous, a wild rhinocerous, with an ivory toothpick on his nose, would be a simple problem compared to Kaiser Bill. No, my dears, Kaiser Bill is a goat, a William goat, with the disposition of a crab, the soul of a monkey and the constitution of a battle tank. We named him Kaiser Bill for reasons too numerous to mention. His diet is varied and fearful, and his motto, like Lord Nelson's, is 'a little more grape.' He ate the whole grape vine, roots, tendrils and all, and then he ate the grape arbor for good measure. He has also consumed two hammocks, a tennis racket and the tar paper roof of the auto shed. He is fond of launching offensives, and his favorite method of warfare is a sudden attack from the rear. He is bomb proof, bullet proof and gas proof, and the only thing in the universe he is afraid of is an open umbrella. Not a few worthy members of this stately community have gained the impression that I am not quite right mentally, because I never go abroad in the street without an umbrella, never knowing at what moment that goat is going to escape from the confines of the stable yard, follow my trail, and come charging down upon me.  \"One day I was sure he was out, and was walking along the street carrying my umbrella open, ready for instant emergency, when I met Mr. Carrington, the frigid rector of St. John's, the church to which all the leading families in Oakwood belong. It was a perfect day, not a cloud in the sky, nor was the sun so hot that protection from it was necessary. Mr. Carrington asked, 'Why the umbrella?' and I replied, 'Oh, I always carry that, because I'm afraid I might meet the Kaiser!' Whereupon he looked at me severely and walked off abruptly, and it didn't occur to me until later that he didn't know who the Kaiser was, and how absolutely idiotic my answer must have sounded.\"  \"Oh, Nyoda, how screamingly funny!\" cried the Winnebagos, laughing until they cried.  \"But why do you keep the goat if he is such a nuisance?\" asked Gladys wonderingly.  \"I can't help myself,\" replied Nyoda with another tragic gesture. \"I inherited him along with the house, and like the crown jewels, while I am to have full enjoyment of possession during lifetime, I can't dispose of him.\"  \"How queer!\" said Sahwah. \"I never heard of a will like that! What a strange man your uncle must have been!\"  \"Oh, Uncle Jasper had nothing whatever to do with it,\" replied Nyoda. \"He never even mentioned the Kaiser in his will.\"  \"Then why can't you get rid of him?\" asked Sahwah, mystified.  \"Because it would break old Hercules' heart,\" answered Nyoda. \"Hercules was Uncle Jasper's coachman all his life and grew old and white-haired in his service. When Uncle Jasper died he provided in his will that Hercules was to be retired on full wages and to continue living in the room over the stable that had been his home for fifty years. Hercules owned this goat, which he had brought up 'by hand,' and it was the delight of his heart. He begged me with tears in his eyes to let him keep it, so what could I do but give them both my blessing and submit meekly to the outrages of the beast? My poor rose vine!\" she finished ruefully, looking at the torn twigs and branches which lay on the ground in the ruins of the trellis.  Then she suddenly threw back her head and laughed loud and long. \"I was born under the sign of Capricornus, the Goat,\" she said, overcome with amusement. \"It's sheer fatality that I should be tied up to the Kaiser. Who shall dispute the will of the gods?  \"Come, Veronica, give us some music on the violin before we go to bed.\"  They returned to the long parlor where the mellow candle light shone softly on the harp and on an old-fashioned picture which hung above it. It was an oil painting, a portrait of a young girl in a short-waisted white satin dress, clasping in her hands a red rose. The face was small and vivacious, and the bright brown eyes seemed to look straight into the eyes of the girls as they stood before the picture.  \"Who is the girl in the picture, Nyoda?\" asked Sahwah, whose eyes had been drawn irresistibly to the portrait ever since she had been in the room.  \"That is the portrait of Elizabeth Carver,\" replied Nyoda. \"She was the daughter of Alexander Carver, the man who built this house. I was named after her. That harp was hers, likewise the bed in which you are going to sleep,"]]]
