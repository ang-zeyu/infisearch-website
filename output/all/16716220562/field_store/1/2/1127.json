There is a charm of light and shade and color that is to be absorbed slowly rather than swallowed at a single gulp. It is emphatically a place in which to dawdle. Let those who are obliged to do so, work and hurry; the visitor and the traveller should take it without haste. It is far better to see Havana and its vicinity slowly and enjoyably, and look at pictures of the rest of the country, than it is to rush through the island merely for the sake of doing so. In his essay on _The Moral of Landscape_, Mr. Ruskin said that \"all travelling becomes dull in exact proportion to its rapidity.\" Nowhere is that more true than it is in Cuba. There is very little in all the island that cannot be seen in Havana and its immediate vicinity. It is well to see the other places if one has ample time, but they should not be seen at the expense of a proper enjoyment of Havana and its neighborhood. In Havana are buildings as old and buildings as beautiful as any in the island. In its vicinity are sugar plantations, tobacco fields, pineapples, cocoanuts, mangoes, royal palms, ceibas, peasants' homes, typical towns and villages, all the life of the people in the city and country. The common American desire to \"see it all\" in a few days, is fatal to the greatest enjoyment, and productive mainly of physical fatigue and mental confusion. It is the misfortune of most travellers that they carry with them only the vaguest of ideas of what they want to see. They have heard of Cuba, of Havana, the Morro, the Prado, of a sunny island in the midst of a sapphire sea. While it is true that almost everything in Cuba is worth seeing, it is best to acquire, before going, some idea of the exhibition. That saves time and many steps. The old city wall, La Fuerza, and La Punta, are mere piles of masonry, more or less dull and uninteresting unless one knows something of their history. The manners and customs of any country become increasingly interesting if one knows something about them, the reason for them.  It is only a short trip to the Castillo del Principe, the fortress that crowns the hill to the west of the city. From that height, the city and the harbor are seen below, to the eastward. Across the bay, on the heights at the entrance, are the frowning walls of Morro Castle surmounted by the towering light-house, and the no less grim walls of La Cabaña. The bay itself is a sprawling, shapeless body of water with a narrow neck connecting it with the Florida Straits. Into the western side of the bay the city thrusts itself in a shape that, on a large map, suggests more than anything else the head and neck of an over-fed bulldog. Into this bay, in 1508, came Sebastian Ocampo, said to be the first white man to visit the spot. He entered for the purpose of careening his little vessels in order to remove the barnacles and accumulated weed-growth. It is possible that the spot was discovered earlier, but there is no record of the discovery if such was made. Ocampo gave it the name of Puerto de Carenas. The next record is of its occupation, in 1519. Four years earlier, Diego Velasquez had left a little colony near what is now called Batabano, on the south coast. He gave the place the name of San Cristobal de la Habana, in memory of the illustrious navigator and discoverer. Habana, or Havana, is a term of aboriginal origin. It proved to be an uncomfortable place of residence, and in 1519 the people moved across the island to the Puerto de Carenas, taking with them the name given to the earlier settlement, and substituting it for the name given by Ocampo. After a time, all was dropped except the present title, Habana, or more commonly by English-speaking people, Havana. It was not much of a place for a number of years, but in 1538 it was sacked and burned by a French pirate, one of the many, of different nations, who carried on a very lively buccaneering business in those and in later years in West Indian waters. Hernando de Soto was then governor of the island, with headquarters at the then capital city, Santiago de Cuba. He proceeded at once to the scene of destruction. On his arrival, he ordered the erection of a fortress. Some of the work then done still remains in the old structure near the Palace, at the foot of Calle O'Reilly, known as La Fuerza. A few years before this time, Hernan Cortes had conquered Mexico, then called New Spain, and a business between Old Spain and New Spain soon developed. The harbor of Havana made a convenient halting-place on the voyages between the two, and the settlement assumed a steadily increasing importance. A new governor, Gonzales Perez de Angulo, who arrived in 1549, decided to make it his place of residence. The year 1552 is generally given as the time of the creation of Havana as the capital city. It was at that time made the residence city of the Governors, by their own choice, but it was not officially established as the capital until 1589. The fortress erected by order of de Soto proved somewhat ineffective. In 1554, another French marauder attacked and destroyed the town. The principal industry of those early days was cattle-raising, a considerable market being developed for export to Mexico, and for the supply of vessels that entered the harbor for food and water.  The continuance of incursions by pirates made necessary some further provision for the defence of the city. In 1589, La Fuerza was enlarged and strengthened, and the construction of Morro Castle was begun. To this work was added La Punta, the little fortress on the western shore of the entrance, at the point of the angle now formed by the Prado and the Malecon. These ancient structures, of practically no value whatever in modern warfare, are now among the most picturesque points of interest in the neighborhood. Another, in the same class, of which only a little now remains, is of a later time. This is the old city wall, the construction of which was begun in 1671. Following the simile of the bull-dog's head, a tract of land, formerly known as the Arsenal yard, and now the central railway station, lies tucked away immediately under the animal's jaw. From there to a point on the north shore, near La Punta, in a slightly curving line, a high wall was erected for the purpose of defence on the western or landward side. The old city lay entirely in the area defined by this western wall and the shore of the harbor. At intervals, gates afforded exit to the country beyond, heavy gates that could be closed to exclude any possible attacking party. The fortifications erected from time to time were supposed to afford a system of effective defence for the city. They are now little else than picturesque features in the landscape, points of interest for visitors. Taking the chain in its order, El Morro stands on the point on the eastern side of the entrance to the harbor. Just beyond it is La Cabaña. About a half a mile to the east of this was the stone fort on the hill of San Diego. Three miles east of the Morro, on the shore at Cojimar, is a small and somewhat ancient fortification. This group constituted the defence system on the east. At the head of the bay, on an elevation a little to the south of the city, stands El Castillo de Atares, begun in 1763, immediately after the capture and occupation of the city by the British. This is supposed to protect the city on the south, as Castillo del Principe is supposed to defend it on the west. This stands on a hill on the western outskirts, a somewhat extensive structure, begun in 1774 and completed about twenty years later. A little further to the west, at the mouth of the Almendares river, stands a little fort, or tower, called Chorrera, serving as a western outpost as Cojimar serves as an eastern outpost. Both were erected about the year 1650. On the shore generally north of Principe was the Santa Clara battery, and between that and La Punta, at the foot of the Calzada de Belascoain, stood the Queen's battery. From any modern point of view, the system is little more than military junk, better fitted for its present use as barracks, asylums, and prisons than for military defence. But it is all highly picturesque.  In the beginning, most of the buildings of the city were doubtless of wood, with palm-thatched roofs. In time, these gave place to rows of abutting stone buildings with tiled roofs. Most of them were of one story, some were of two stories, and a few \"palaces\" had three. The city within the wall is today very much as it was a century and more ago. Its streets run, generally but not accurately, at right angles, one set almost due east and west, from the harbor front to the line of the old wall, and the other set runs southward from the shore of the entrance channel to the shore of the inner harbor. Several of these streets are practically continuous from north to south or from east to west. But most of them are rather passage-ways than streets. The houses come to their very edges, except for a narrow strip hardly to be classed as a sidewalk, originally left, presumably, only for the purpose of preventing the scraping of the front of the building by the wheels of passing carts and carriages. It is a somewhat inconvenient system nowadays, but one gets quite used to it after a little, threads the narrow walk a part of his way, takes to the street the rest of the way, and steps aside to avoid passing vehicles quite as did the carriageless in the old days. One excellent way to avoid the trouble is to take a carriage and let the other fellow step aside. Riding in the _coche_ is still one of the cheapest forms of convenience and entertainment in the city, excepting the afternoon drive around the Prado and the Malecon. That is not cheap. We used to pay a dollar an hour. My last experience cost me three times that.

HARVEY RALPHSON     CHAPTER I  BOY SCOUTS IN A STRANGE LAND   \"Fine country, this--to get out of!\"  \"What's the difficulty, kid?\"  Jimmie McGraw, the first speaker, turned back to the interior of the apartment in which he stood with a look of intense disgust on freckled face.  \"Oh, nothin' much,\" he replied, wrinkling his nose comically, \"only Broadway an' the Bowery are too far away from this town to ever amount to anythin'.  Say, how would you fellers like a chair in front of the grate in the little old Black Bear Patrol clubroom, in the village of N. Y.?  What?\"  The three boys lying, half covered with empty burlap bags, on the bare earth at the back of the apartment chuckled softly as Jimmie's face brightened at the small picture he drew verbally, of the luxurious Boy Scout clubroom in the City of New York.  \"New York is a barren island as compared with this place,\" one of the boys, Jack Bosworth by name, declared.  \"Just think of the odor of the Orient all around us!\"  Jimmie wrinkled his nose in disdain and turned back to the window out of which he had been looking.  The other boys, Ned Nestor, of the Wolf Patrol, and Jack Bosworth and Frank Shaw, of the Black Bear Patrol, all of New York, pulled their coarse covering closer under their chins and grinned at the impatient Jimmie, who was of the Wolf Patrol, and who was just then on guard.  It wasn't much of a window that the boy looked out of, just an irregular hole in a bare wall, innocent alike of sash and glass.  Away to the east rolled the restless waters of the Gulf of Pechili, which is little more than a round bay swinging west from the mystical Yellow Sea.  To the south ran the swift current of the Peiho river, on the opposite bank of which lay the twin of Taku, Chinese town where Jimmie stood guard. Tungku, as the twin village is named, looked every bit as forlorn and disreputable as Taku, where the boys had waited four days for important information which had been promised by the Secret Service department at Washington.  The gulf of Pechili and the Peiho river glistened under the October sun, which seemed to bring little warmth to the atmosphere.  Junks of all sizes and kinds were moving slowly through the waves, and farther out larger vessels lay at anchor, as if holding surveillance over the mouth of the stream which led to Tientsin, that famous city of the great Chinese nation.  \"Look at it!  Just look at it!\"  Jimmie pointed out of the opening, his hand swinging about to include the river and the gulf, the slowly moving boats and the picturesque streets.  \"'Tis a heathen land!\" the boy went on.  \"They wear their shirts outside of their trousers an' do their trucking on their shoulders.  Say, Ned,\" he added, \"why can't we cut it out?  I'm sick of it!\"  \"Cut it out?\" laughed Jack Bosworth, \"why, kid, we've just got to the land of promise!\"  \"Most all promise!\" replied Jimmie.  \"We've got nothin' but promises since we've been here.  Where's that Secret Service feller that was goin' to set the pace for us?\"  \"Perhaps he's lost in the jungle,\" laughed Frank Shaw.  \"He certainly ought to have been here three days ago.  What about it, Gulf of Pechili and the Peiho river Ned?\" he added, turning to a youth who lay at his side, almost shivering in spite of his shaggy burlap covering.  Ned Nestor yawned and threw aside his alleged protection from the growing chill of the October day.  The boys, fresh from a submarine in which they had searched an ocean floor for important documents as well as millions of dollars in gold, had arrived at Taku five days before this autumn afternoon.  After concluding the mission on the submarine, Ned had been invited to undertake a difficult errand to Peking, in the interest of the United States Secret Service.  Even after landing at Taku, he had confessed to his chums his utter ignorance of the work he was to do.  He had been requested by the Secret Service man who had engaged him for the duty to wait for instructions at the old house on the water front which, in company with Frank, Jack, and Jimmie, he now occupied.  The house was old and dilapidated, seemingly having been unoccupied for years, so the lads were really \"camping out\" there.  Their provisions were brought to them regularly by a Chinaman who did not seem to understand a word of English, and, as the boys knowledge of the Chinese tongue was exceedingly limited, no information had been gained from him.  The Secret Service man had not appeared, and Ned was becoming uneasy, especially as the curiosity of his neighbors was becoming annoying.  \"I guess this is a stall,\" Jimmie grumbled, as Ned arose and stood at his side.  \"You know how the Moores, father an' son, tried to get us on the submarine?  Well, I'll bet they've got loose, an' that we're bein' kept here until they can do us up proper without attractin' the attention of the European population.\"  Ned laughed at the boy's fears.  He had no doubt that the man who had promised to meet him there had been delayed in some unaccountable manner, and that the information he was awaiting would be supplied before another day had passed.  \"Anyway,\" Jimmie insisted, \"I don't like the looks of things hereabouts! There's always some pigtailed Chink watchin' this house from the street. I woke up last night an' saw a snaky-eyed Celestial peering in at this window.  I guess they've got rid of the man we are waitin' for.\"  \"If we only knew exactly what we were to do in Peking,\" Frank said, approaching the little group by the window, \"we might jog along and report to the American legation.  I'm like Jimmie.  I don't fancy this long wait here--not a little bit!\"  \"As I have told you before,\" Ned replied, \"I don't know the first thing about the work cut out for us by the United States Secret Service people. There was some talk about following a brace of conspirators to Peking, the conspirators who tried to discredit the United States in the matter of the gold shipment but that was only incidental, and I was ordered to come here and await instructions.  So I'm going to wait-- until the moon drops out of the sky, if necessary.\"  \"Oh, we'll stick around!\" Frank put in.  \"Don't think, for a minute, that any of us thought of quitting the game.  Still, I'd just like to know how much longer we have to remain here, and just what we are to do when we get to Peking, if we ever do.\"  \"Of course we'll stick!\" Jimmie exclaimed.  \"All I'm kickin' on is the delay.  We might have remained on board the submarine, where we had cozy quarters an' somethin' to eat besides this Chink stuff.\"  \"Whenever you want to bump Jimmie good and plenty,\" laughed Jack, \"all you need to do is to tamper with his rations.  What's the matter with this rice, kid, and this meat pie?\" he added, as the man who had served their food since their occupancy of the old house approached with a large, covered basket on his arm.  Jimmie wrinkled his freckled nose again and laid a hand on his stomach, as if in sympathy with that organ for the unutterable Chinese concoctions it had been called upon to assimilate of late.  \"Rat pie!\" he said, in a tone of disgust.  \"I'll bet a dollar to a rap on the nose that it's rat pie!  I can hear the rats squeal nights when I'm tryin' to sleep an' can't.\"  \"Say, Chink,\" Jack said, seizing the Chinaman by the shoulder and facing him about so that a good look into his slanty eyes might be had, \"what do you know about this chuck?\"  \"No chuck!  Pie!\"  \"Of course it's pie!\" answered Jack.  \"It would be pie if it was made of old shoes, if it had a crust on.  What I want to know is, where did you catch him, and who pays you to bring it to us, and who pays him to pay you to feed it to us?  Where does he live, and is he black, white, or red? Come on, old top.  You know a lot if you could only think of it.\"  The Chinaman, an evil-looking old fellow with a long cicatrice across his left cheekbone, shook his head and regarded his questioner craftily.  \"No spik English!\" he said.  \"You spoke it then,\" Jack retorted.  \"I'll bet a pan of pickles that you know what we were saying when you came in here.\"  \"Let him alone,\" Frank advised.  \"That head of his is solid bone.  He would think his foot hurt if he had the toothache.\"  \"What a filthy, yellow, toothless, wicked old devil it is!\" Jack went on. \"Some day when he comes here with that basket of rats I'm going to cut his pigtail off close behind his ears.\"  \"I think he's the foulest old geezer I've ever met,\" Frank went on.  \"If I had a dog with a mug like that I'd hire him out to the man who manufactures nightmares.\"  The Chinaman stood looking stupidly about for a minute before placing his basket on the floor, then dropped it with a jar which rattled the few dishes within and scuffled out of the door.  Jimmie followed to see that he did not loiter around the house listening, and came back with a mischievous grin on his face.  Long before the appearance of the Chinaman the boys had planned to use such uncomplimentary language in his presence as would be likely to excite his anger, if he understood what was being said.  They did not believe he was as ignorant of the English language as he pretended to be.  \"Well,\" Jimmie asked, of Ned, \"did he tumble?  What did you see?\"  \"I saw as evil a look as ever burned out of a  human eye,\" Ned replied. \"Looked to me like he would enjoy feeding Jack and Frank to the rats.\"  \"Then he understood, all right?\"  \"Of course he did,\" Jack, answered.  \"I could see that with one eye. He's been coming here with his grub for four days, and picking up a word here and there every time.  We ought to have had sense enough to have been on guard against such treachery.\"  \"What's the answer now?\" asked Jimmie, turning to Ned.  \"I'm afraid we're in a bad predicament,\" Ned replied.  \"This shows me new light.  The messenger we are expecting should have been here long ago, and I'm now sure that we've just got to do something.  "]]]
