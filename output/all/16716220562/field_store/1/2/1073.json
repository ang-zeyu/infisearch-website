Hence the Chou rulers were glad to call in the old priests as performers of ceremonies and teachers of morality similar to the ancient Indian rulers who needed the Brahmans for the correct performance of all rites. There thus came into existence in the early Chou empire a new social group, later called \"scholars\", men who were not regarded as belonging to the lower class represented by the subjugated population but were not included in the nobility; men who were not productively employed but belonged to a sort of independent profession. They became of very great importance in later centuries.  In the first centuries of the Chou dynasty the ruling house steadily lost power. Some of the emperors proved weak, or were killed at war; above all, the empire was too big and its administration too slow-moving. The feudal lords and nobles were occupied with their own problems in securing the submission of the surrounding villages to their garrisons and in governing them; they soon paid little attention to the distant central authority. In addition to this, the situation at the centre of the empire was more difficult than that of its feudal states farther east. The settlements around the garrisons in the east were inhabited by agrarian tribes, but the subjugated population around the centre at Sian was made up of nomadic tribes of Turks and Mongols together with semi-nomadic Tibetans. Sian lies in the valley of the river Wei; the riverside country certainly belonged, though perhaps only insecurely, to the Shang empire and was specially well adapted to agriculture; but its periphery--mountains in the south, steppes in the north--was inhabited (until a late period, to some extent to the present day) by nomads, who had also been subjugated by the Chou. The Chou themselves were by no means strong, as they had been only a small tribe and their strength had depended on auxiliary tribes, which had now spread over the country as the new nobility and lived far from the Chou. The Chou emperors had thus to hold in check the subjugated but warlike tribes of Turks and Mongols who lived quite close to their capital. In the first centuries of the dynasty they were more or less successful, for the feudal lords still sent auxiliary forces. In time, however, these became fewer and fewer, because the feudal lords pursued their own policy; and the Chou were compelled to fight their own battles against tribes that continually rose against them, raiding and pillaging their towns. Campaigns abroad also fell mainly on the shoulders of the Chou, as their capital lay near the frontier.  It must not be simply assumed, as is often done by the Chinese and some of the European historians, that the Turkish and Mongolian tribes were so savage or so pugnacious that they continually waged war just for the love of it. The problem is much deeper, and to fail to recognize this is to fail to understand Chinese history down to the Middle Ages. The conquering Chou established their garrisons everywhere, and these garrisons were surrounded by the quarters of artisans and by the villages of peasants, a process that ate into the pasturage of the Turkish and Mongolian nomads. These nomads, as already mentioned, pursued agriculture themselves on a small scale, but it occurred to them that they could get farm produce much more easily by barter or by raiding. Accordingly they gradually gave up cultivation and became pure nomads, procuring the needed farm produce from their neighbours. This abandonment of agriculture brought them into a precarious situation: if for any reason the Chinese stopped supplying or demanded excessive barter payment, the nomads had to go hungry. They were then virtually driven to get what they needed by raiding. Thus there developed a mutual reaction that lasted for centuries. Some of the nomadic tribes living between garrisons withdrew, to escape from the growing pressure, mainly into the province of Shansi, where the influence of the Chou was weak and they were not numerous; some of the nomad chiefs lost their lives in battle, and some learned from the Chou lords and turned themselves into petty rulers. A number of \"marginal\" states began to develop; some of them even built their own cities. This process of transformation of agro-nomadic tribes into \"warrior-nomadic\" tribes continued over many centuries and came to an end in the third or second century B.C.  The result of the three centuries that had passed was a symbiosis between the urban aristocrats and the country-people. The rulers of the towns took over from the general population almost the whole vocabulary of the language which from now on we may call \"Chinese\". They naturally took over elements of the material civilization. The subjugated population had, meanwhile, to adjust itself to its lords. In the organism that thus developed, with its unified economic system, the conquerors became an aristocratic ruling class, and the subjugated population became a lower class, with varied elements but mainly a peasantry. From now on we may call this society \"Chinese\"; it has endured to the middle of the twentieth century. Most later essential societal changes are the result of internal development and not of aggression from without.  4 _Limitation of the imperial power_  In 771 B.C. an alliance of northern feudal states had attacked the ruler in his western capital; in a battle close to the city they had overcome and killed him. This campaign appears to have set in motion considerable groups from various tribes, so that almost the whole province of Shensi was lost. With the aid of some feudal lords who had remained loyal, a Chou prince was rescued and conducted eastward to the second capital, Loyang, which until then had never been the ruler's actual place of residence. In this rescue a lesser feudal prince, ruler of the feudal state of Ch'in, specially distinguished himself. Soon afterwards this prince, whose domain had lain close to that of the ruler, reconquered a great part of the lost territory, and thereafter regarded it as his own fief. The Ch'in family resided in the same capital in which the Chou had lived in the past, and five hundred years later we shall meet with them again as the dynasty that succeeded the Chou.  The new ruler, resident now in Loyang, was foredoomed to impotence. He was now in the centre of the country, and less exposed to large-scale enemy attacks; but his actual rule extended little beyond the town itself and its immediate environment. Moreover, attacks did not entirely cease; several times parts of the indigenous population living between the Chou towns rose against the towns, even in the centre of the country.  Now that the emperor had no territory that could be the basis of a strong rule and, moreover, because he owed his position to the feudal lords and was thus under an obligation to them, he ruled no longer as the chief of the feudal lords but as a sort of sanctified overlord; and this was the position of all his successors. A situation was formed at first that may be compared with that of Japan down to the middle of the nineteenth century. The ruler was a symbol rather than an exerciser of power. There had to be a supreme ruler because, in the worship of Heaven which was recognized by all the feudal lords, the supreme sacrifices could only be offered by the Son of Heaven in person. There could not be a number of sons of heaven because there were not a number of heavens. The imperial sacrifices secured that all should be in order in the country, and that the necessary equilibrium between Heaven and Earth should be maintained. For in the religion of Heaven there was a close parallelism between Heaven and Earth, and every omission of a sacrifice, or failure to offer it in due form, brought down a reaction from Heaven. For these religious reasons a central ruler was a necessity for the feudal lords. They needed him also for practical reasons. In the course of centuries the personal relationship between the various feudal lords had ceased. Their original kinship and united struggles had long been forgotten. When the various feudal lords proceeded to subjugate the territories at a distance from their towns, in order to turn their city states into genuine territorial states, they came into conflict with each other. In the course of these struggles for power many of the small fiefs were simply destroyed. It may fairly be said that not until the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. did the old garrison towns became real states. In these circumstances the struggles between the feudal states called urgently for an arbiter, to settle simple cases, and in more difficult cases either to try to induce other feudal lords to intervene or to give sanction to the new situation. These were the only governing functions of the ruler from the time of the transfer to the second capital.  5 _Changes in the relative strength of the feudal states_  In these disturbed times China also made changes in her outer frontiers. When we speak of frontiers in this connection, we must take little account of the European conception of a frontier. No frontier in that sense existed in China until her conflict with the European powers. In the dogma of the Chinese religion of Heaven, all the countries of the world were subject to the Chinese emperor, the Son of Heaven. Thus there could be no such thing as other independent states. In practice the dependence of various regions on the ruler naturally varied: near the centre, that is to say near the ruler's place of residence, it was most pronounced; then it gradually diminished in the direction of the periphery. The feudal lords of the inner territories were already rather less subordinated than at the centre, and those at a greater distance scarcely at all; at a still greater distance were territories whose chieftains regarded themselves as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11381"],["title","Sermons for the Times (#0)"],["body","by David Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk     SERMONS FOR THE TIMES     Contents:    Fathers and Children    Salvation    A Good Conscience    Names    Sponsorship    Justification by Faith    Duty and Superstition    Sonship    The Lord's Prayer    The Doxology    Ahab and Naboth    The Light of God    Providence    England's Strength    The Life of God    God's Offspring    Death in Life    Shame    Forgiveness    The True Gentleman    Toleration    Public Spirit    SERMON I.  'FATHERS AND CHILDREN'    Malachi iv. 5, 6.  Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:  And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.  These words are especially solemn words.  They stand in an especially solemn and important part of the Bible.  They are the last words of the Old Testament.  I cannot but think that it was God's will that they should stand where they are, and nowhere else. Malachi, the prophet who wrote them, did not know perhaps that he was the last of the Old Testament prophets.  He did not know that no prophet would arise among the Jews for 400 years, till the time when John the Baptist came preaching repentance.  But God knew.  And by God's ordinance these words stand at the end of the Old Testament, to make us understand the beginning of the New Testament.  For the Old Testament ends by saying that God would send to the Jews Elijah the prophet.  And the New Testament begins by telling us of John the Baptist's coming as a prophet, in the spirit and power of Elias; and how the Lord Jesus himself declared plainly that John the Baptist was Elijah who was to come; that is, the Elijah of whom Malachi prophesies in my text.  Therefore, we may be certain that this text tells us what John the Baptist's work was; that John the Baptist came to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers; lest the Lord should come and smite the land with a curse.  Some may be ready to answer to this, 'Of course John the Baptist came to warn parents of behaving wrongly to their children, if they were careless or cruel; and children to their parents, if they were disobedient or ungrateful.  Of course he would tell bad parents and children to repent, just as he came to tell all other kinds of sinners to repent.  But that was only a part of John the Baptist's work.  He came to be the forerunner of the Messiah, the Saviour, the Redeemer.'  Be it so, my friends.  I only hope that you really do believe that John the Baptist did come to proclaim that a Saviour was born into the world--provided only that you remember all the while who that Saviour was.  John the Baptist tells you who He was.  If you will only remember that, and get the thought of it into your hearts, you will not be inclined to put any words of your own in place of the prophet Malachi's, or to fancy that you can describe better than Malachi what John the Baptist's work was to be; and that turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, was only a small part of John the Baptist's work, instead of being, as Malachi says it was, his principal work, his very work, the work which must be done, lest the Lord, instead of saving the land, should come and smite it with a curse.  Yes--you must remember who it was that John the Baptist came to bear record of, and to manifest or show to the Jews.  The Angels on the first Christmas Eve told us--they said it was _The Lord_, 'Unto you,' they said, 'is born a Saviour, who is Christ, _The Lord_.'  John the Baptist told you and all mankind who it was--that it was The Lord.  'The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of _the Lord_!'  _The Lord_.  What Lord--Which Lord?  John the Baptist knew.  Simeon, Anna, Nathaniel, all righteous and faithful hearts who waited for the salvation of the Lord, knew.  The Pharisees and Sadducees did not know.  The men who wrote our Creeds, our Prayer Book, our Church Catechism, knew.  The Pharisees and the Sadducees in our day, who fancy themselves wiser than the Creeds, and the Prayer Book, and the Church Catechism, do not know.  May God grant that we may all know, not only with our lips, but with our hearts, our faith, our love, our lives, who The Lord is.  Jesus Christ, the babe of Bethlehem, is The Lord.  But who is He? The Bible tells us; when we have heard what the Bible tells us we shall be able better to understand the text.  The Lord is He of whom it is written, 'And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.'  And who is God's image and God's likeness?  The New Testament tells us--Jesus Christ.  In Him man was made.  He is the Son of Man, who is in heaven--the true perfect pattern of man:  but He is also the image and likeness of God, the brightness of His Father's glory, and the express image of His person.  He is The Lord.  He is the Lord who instituted marriage, and said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help-meet for him.'  He is the Lord who said to man, 'Be fruitful and multiply: fill the earth and subdue it.'  He is the Lord who said to the first murderer, 'Thy brother's blood crieth against thee from the ground.' He is the Lord who talked with Abraham face to face as a man talks with his friend; who blest him by giving him a son in his old age, that he might be the father of many nations.  He is the Lord who, on Mount Sinai, gave those Ten Commandments, the foundation of all law and right order between man and God, between man and man:--'Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother.  Thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery.  Thou shalt not steal.  Thou shalt not bear false witness in courts of law or elsewhere.  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's property.'  This is The Lord.  Not a God far away from men; who does not feel for them, nor feel with them; not a God who despises men, or has an ill-will to men, and must be won over to change his mind, and have mercy on them, by many supplications and tears, and fear and trembling, and superstitious ceremonies.  But this is The Lord, this is the babe of Bethlehem, this is He whose way John the Baptist came to prepare--even He of whom it is written, that He possessed wisdom, the simple, practical human wisdom, useful for this everyday earthly life of ours, which Solomon sets forth in his Proverbs, in the beginning before His works of old; and that when He appointed the foundations of the earth, that Wisdom was by Him, as one brought up with Him, and she was daily His delight; rejoicing alway before Him; rejoicing in the _habitable_ parts of the earth; and her delights were _with the sons of men_.  In one word, He is the Lord, in whose likeness man is made.  Man's justice is a pattern of His; man's love is a pattern of His; man's industry a pattern of His; man's Sabbath-rest, in some unspeakable and eternal way, a pattern of His.  Man's family ties are patterns of His.  God the Father is He, said St. Paul, from whom every fathership in heaven and earth is named, that we may be such fathers to our children as God is to us.  God The Son is He who is not ashamed to call us brethren, and to declare to us the glorious news, that in Him we, too, are the sons of God, that we may be such sons to our heavenly Father--ay, and to our earthly fathers also, as the Lord Jesus was to His Father.  Yes--and even more wonderful still, and more blessed still, the Lord is not ashamed to call himself a husband.  Our human wedlock and married love is a pattern of some divine mystery.  'Husbands love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, but that it should be holy and without blemish.'  Blessed words, which we cannot pretend to explain or understand, but can only believe and adore, and find, as we shall find, in proportion as we are loving and faithful in wedlock, that God's Spirit bears witness with our spirit, that they are reasonable, blessed, true; true for ever.  This, then, was the Lord who was coming to judge these Jews; not merely a god, but _The_ God.  The Lord, in whose likeness man was made; who had appointed men to be fathers, sons, husbands, citizens of a nation, owners of property, subject to laws, and yet _makers_ of laws; because all these things, in some wonderful way, are parts of His likeness.  He was coming to this nation of the Jews first, and then to all the nations of the earth, to judge them, Malachi said, with a great and terrible day.  To lay the axe to the root of the tree; to cut down from the very root the evil principles which were working in society.  His fan was in His hand; and He would thoroughly purge His floor; and gather His wheat into the garner, for the use of future generations:  but the chaff, all that was empty, light, and useless, He would burn up and destroy utterly out of the way, with unquenchable fire.  He would inquire of every man, How have you kept my image; my likeness, in which I made you?  What sort of husbands, fathers, sons, neighbours, subjects, and governors, have you been?  And above all, Malachi says, the root question of all would be, what sort of fathers have you been to your children?  What sort of children to your fathers?  Does that seem to you a small question, my friends?  Would you have rather expected to hear John the Baptist ask, what sort of saints they had been?  What sort of doctrines they were professing?  A small question?  Look at these two little words, Father and Son. Father and Son!  Are they not the most deep and awful, as well as the most blessed and hopeful words on earth?  Do they not tell us the very mystery of God's being?  Are they not the very name of God, God The Father and God The Son, knit together by one Holy Spirit of"]]]
