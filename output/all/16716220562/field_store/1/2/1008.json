Common soldiers wouldn't have been mean enough to do that! Men who called themselves princes broke their word three times a day.  Well, then came the invasion. Wherever Napoleon showed his lion face the enemy retreated; and he worked more miracles in defending France than he had shown in conquering Italy, the East, Spain, Europe, and Russia. He wanted to bury all the invaders in France, and thus teach them to respect the country; so he let them come close to Paris, in order to swallow 'em all at a gulp and rise to the height of his genius in a battle greater than all the others--a regular mother of battles! But those cowardly Parisians were so afraid for their wretched skins and their miserable shops that they opened the gates of the city. Then the good times ended and the \"ragusades\" began. They fooled the Empress and hung white flags out of the palace windows. Finally the very generals whom Napoleon had taken for his best friends deserted him and went over to the Bourbons--of whom nobody had ever before heard. Then he bade us good-by at Fontainebleau. \"Soldiers!\"  I can hear him, even now. We were all crying like regular babies, and the eagles and flags were lowered as if at a funeral. And it was a funeral--the funeral of the Empire. His old soldiers, once so hale and spruce, were little more than skeletons. Standing on the portico of his palace, he said to us:  \"Comrades! We have been beaten through treachery; but we shall all see one another again in heaven, the country of the brave. Protect my child, whom I intrust to you. Long live Napoleon II!\"  Like Jesus Christ before his last agony, he believed himself deserted by God and his star; and in order that no one should see him conquered, it was his intention to die; but, although he took poison enough to kill a whole regiment, it never hurt him at all--another proof, you see, that he was more than man: he found himself immortal. As he felt sure of his business after that, and knew that he was to be Emperor always, he went to a certain island for a while, to study the natures of those people in Paris, who did not fail, of course, to do stupid things without end.  While he was standing guard down there, the Chinese and those animals on the coast of Africa--Moors and others, who are not at all easy to get along with--were so sure that he was something more than man that they respected his tent, and said that to touch it would be to offend God. So he reigned over the whole world, although those other fellows had sent him out of France.  Well, then, after a while he embarked again in the very same nut-shell of a boat that he had left Egypt in, passed right under the bows of the English vessels, and set foot once more in France. France acknowledged him; the sacred cuckoo flew from spire to spire; and all the people cried, \"Long live the Emperor!\"  In this vicinity the enthusiasm for the Wonder of the Ages was most hearty. Dauphiny behaved well; and it pleased me particularly to know that our own people here wept for joy when they saw again his gray coat.  On the 1st of March Napoleon landed, with two hundred men, to conquer the kingdom of France and Navarre; and on the 20th of the same month that kingdom became the French Empire. On that day THE MAN was in Paris. He had made a clean sweep--had reconquered his dear France, and had brought all his old soldiers together again by saying only three words: \"Here I am.\" 'Twas the greatest miracle God had ever worked. Did ever a man, before him, take an empire by merely showing his hat? They thought that France was crushed, did they? Not a bit of it! At sight of the Eagle a national army sprang up, and we all marched to Waterloo. There the Guard perished, as if stricken down at a single blow. Napoleon, in despair, threw himself three times, at the head of his troops, on the enemy's cannon, without being able to find death. The battle was lost.  That evening the Emperor called his old soldiers together, and, on the field wet with our blood, burned his eagles and his flags. The poor eagles, who had always been victorious, who had cried \"Forward!\" in all our battles, and who had flown over all Europe, were saved from the disgrace of falling into the hands of their enemies. All the treasure of England couldn't buy the tail of one of them. They were no more!  The rest of the story is well known to everybody. The Red Man went over to the Bourbons, like the scoundrel that he is; France was crushed; and the old soldiers, who were no longer of any account, were deprived of their dues and sent back to their homes, in order that their places might be given to a lot of nobles who couldn't even march--it was pitiful to see them try! Then Napoleon was seized, through treachery, and the English nailed him to a rock, ten thousand feet above the earth, on a desert island in the great ocean. There he must stay until the Red Man, for the good of France, gives him back his power. It is said by some that he is dead. Oh, yes! Dead! That shows how little they know him! They only tell that lie to cheat the people and keep peace in their shanty of a government. The truth of the matter is that his friends have left him there in the desert to fulfil a prophecy that was made about him--for I have forgotten to tell you that the name Napoleon really means \"Lion of the Desert.\"  This that I have told you is gospel truth; and all the other things that you hear about the Emperor are foolish stories with no human likeliness. Because, you see, God never gave to any other man born of woman the power to write his name in red across the whole world--and the world will remember him forever. Long live Napoleon, the father of the soldiers and the people!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11283"],["title","Plays of Gods and Men (#0)"],["body","Title: Plays of Gods and Men  Author: Lord Dunsany  [Note: this edition was prepared from the 1917 Unwin edition.

Scene: The jungle city of Thek in the reign of King Karnos.  Tharmia:  You know that my lineage is almost divine.  Arolind:  My father's sword was so terrible that he had to hide it with a cloak.  Tharmia:  He probably did that because there were no jewels in the scabbard.  Arolind:  There were emeralds in it that outstared the sea.  *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *  Tharmia:  Now I must leave you here and go down among the shops for I have not changed my hair since we came to Thek.  Ichtharion:  Have you not brought that from Barbul-el-Sharnak?  Tharmia:  It was not necessary. The King would not take his court where they could not obtain necessities.  Arolind:  May I go with your Sincerity?  Tharmia:  Indeed, Princely Lady, I shall be glad of your company.  Arolind:  [To Ludibras] I wish to see the other palaces in Thek, [To Tharmia] then we can go on beyond the walls to see what princes live in the neighbourhood.  Tharmia:  It will be delightful.      [Exeunt Tharmia and Arolind]  Ichtharion:  Well, we are here in Thek.  Ludibras:  How lucky we are that the King has come to Thek. I feared he would never come.  Ichtharion:  It is a most fair city.  Ludibras:  When he tarried year after year in monstrous Barbul-el-Sharnak, I feared that I would see the sun rise never more in the windy glorious country. I feared we should live always in Barbul-el-Sharnak and be buried among houses.  Ichtharion:  It is mountainous with houses: there are no flowers there. I wonder how the winds come into it.  Ludibras:  Ah. Do you know that it is I that brought him here at last? I gave him orchids from a far country. At last he noticed them. \"Those are good flowers,\" said he. \"They come from Thek,\" I said. \"Thek is purple with them. It seems purple far out on the sand to the camel men.\" Then...  Ichtharion:  No, it was not you brought him. He saw a butterfly once in Barbul-el-Sharnak. There had not been one there for seven years. It was lucky for us that it lived; I used to send for hundreds, but they all died but that one when they came to Barbul-el-Sharnak. The King saw it.  Ludibras:  It was since then that he noticed my purple orchids.  Ichtharion:  Something changed in his mind when he saw the butterfly. He became quite different. He would not have noticed a flower but for that.  Ludibras:  He came to Thek in order to see the orchids.  Ichtharion:  Come, come. We are here. Nothing else matters.  Ludibras:  Yes, we are here. How beautiful are the orchids.  Ichtharion:  What a beautiful thing the air is in the morning. I stand up very early and breathe it from my casement; not in order to nourish my body, you understand, but because it is the wild, sweet air of Thek.  Ludibras:  Yes, it is wonderful rising up in the morning. It seems all fresh from the fields.  Ichtharion:  It took us two days to ride out of Bar-el-Sharnak. Do you remember how men stared at our camels? No one had gone away from the city for years.  Ludibras:  I think it is not easy to leave a great city. It seems to grow thicker around you, and you forget the fields.  Ichtharion: [looking off]  The jungle is like a sea lying there below us. The orchids that blaze on it are like Tyrian ships, all rich with purple of that wonderful fish; they have even dyed their sails with it.  Ludibras:  They are not like ships because they do not move. They are like... They are like no tangible thing in all the world. They are like faint, beautiful songs of an unseen singer; they are like temptations to some unknown sin. They make me think of the tigers that slip through the gloom below them.      [Enter Harpagas and a Noble of the Court, with spears and leather     belts.]  Ichtharion:  Where are you going?  Harpagas:  We are going hunting.  Ichtharion:  Hunting! How beautiful!  Harpagas:  A little street goes down from the palace door; the other end of it touches the very jungle.  Ludibras:  O, heavenly city of Thek.  Ichtharion:  Have you ever before gone hunting?  Harpagas:  No; I have dreamed of it. In Barbul-el-Sharnak I nearly forgot my dream.  Ichtharion:  Man was not made for cities. I did not know this once.  Ludibras:  I will come with you.  Ichtharion:  I will come with you, too. We will go down by the little street, and there will be the jungle. I will fetch a spear as we go.  Ludibras:  What shall we hunt in the jungle?  Harpagas:  They say there are kroot and abbax; and tigers, some say, have been heard of.  Noble:  We must never go back to Barbul-el-Sharnak again.  Ichtharion:  You may rely on us.  Ludibras:  We shall keep the King in Thek.      [Exeunt, leaving two sentries standing beside the throne.]  1st Sentry:  They are all very glad to be in Thek. I, too, am glad.  2nd Sentry:  It is a very little city. Two hundred of these cities would not build Barbul-el-Sharnak.  1st Sentry:  No. But it is a finer palace, and Barbul-el-Sharnak is the centre of the world; men have drawn together there.  2nd Sentry:  I did not know there was a palace like this outside Barbul-el-Sharnak.  1st Sentry:  It was built in the days of the forefathers. They built palaces in those days.  2nd Sentry:  They must be in the jungle by now. It is quite close. How glad they were to go.  1st Sentry:  Yes, they were glad. Men do not hunt for tigers in Barbul-el-Sharnak.      [Enter Tharmia and Arolind weeping.]  Tharmia:  O it is terrible.  Arolind:  O! O! O!  1st Sentry: [To 2nd Sentry]  Something has happened.      [Enter Carolyx.]  Carolyx:  What is it, princely ladies?  [To Sentries] Go. Go away.      [Exeunt Sentries.]  What has happened?  Tharmia:  O. We went down a little street.  Carolyx:  Yes. Yes.  Arolind:  The main street of the city.      [Both weep quietly.]  Carolyx:  Yes? Yes? Yes?  Tharmia:  It ends in the jungle.  Carolyx:  You went into the jungle! There must be tigers there.  Tharmia:  No.  Arolind:  No.  Carolyx:  What did you do?  Tharmia:  We came back.  Carolyx: [in a voice of anguish]  What did you see in the street?  Tharmia:  Nothing.  Arolind:  Nothing.  Carolyx:  Nothing?  Tharmia:  There are no shops.  Arolind:  We cannot buy new hair.  Tharmia:  We cannot buy [sobs] gold-dust to put upon our hair.  Arolind:  There are no [sobs] neighbouring princes.      [Carolyx bursts bitterly into tears and continues to weep.]  Tharmia:  Barbul-el-Sharnak, Barbul-el-Sharnak. O why did the King leave Barbul-el-Sharnak?  Arolind:  Barbul-el-Sharnak. Its streets were all of agate.  Tharmia:  And there were shops where one bought beautiful hair.  Carolyx:  The King must go at once.  Tharmia: [calmer now.]  He shall go tomorrow. My husband shall speak to him.  Arolind:  Perhaps my husband might have more influence.  Tharmia and Arolind:  My husband brought him here.  Tharmia:  What!  Arolind:  Nothing. What did you say?  Tharmia:  I said nothing. I thought you spoke.  Carolyx:  It may be better for my husband to persuade him, for he was ever opposed to his coming to Thek.  Tharmia: [To Arolind]  He could have but little influence with His Majesty since the King _has_ come to Thek.  Arolind:  No. It will be better for our husbands to arrange it.  Carolyx:  I myself have some influence with the Queen.  Tharmia:  It is of no use. Her nerves are all a-quiver. She weeps if you speak with her. If you argue a matter with her she cries aloud and maidens must come and fan her and put scent on her hands.  Arolind:  She never leaves her chamber and the King would not listen to her.  Tharmia:  Hark, they are coming back. They are singing a hunting song.... why, they have killed a beast. All four of the men are bringing it on two branches.  Arolind: [bored]  What kind of beast is it?  Tharmia:  I do not know. It seems to have barbed horns.  Carolyx:  We must go and meet them.      [The song is loud and joyous.]      [Exeunt by the way that the Sentries went.]      [Enter Sentries.]  1st Sentry:  Whatever it is has passed away again for they were smiling.  2nd Sentry:  They feared that their husbands were lost and now they return in safety.  1st Sentry:  You do not know, for you do not understand women.  2nd Sentry:  I understand them quite as well as you.  1st Sentry:  That is what I say. You do not understand them. I do not understand them.  2nd Sentry:  ......Oh. [A pause.]  1st Sentry:  We shall never leave Thek now.  2nd Sentry:  Why shall we never leave it?  1st Sentry:  Did you not hear how glad they were when they sang the hunting song? They say a wild dog does not turn from the trail, they will go on hunting now.  2nd Sentry:  But will the King stay here?  1st Sentry:  He only does what Ichtharion and Ludibras persuade him. He does not listen to the Queen.  2nd Sentry:  The Queen is mad.  1st Sentry:  She is not mad but she has a curious sickness, she is always "]]]
