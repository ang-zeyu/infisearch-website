The dwarfs were contemptuous of all things savouring of heaven, and of everything that was even partly divine.  They were, so it has been said, of the seed of man; but, being squat and hairy like to the beasts; they praised all beastly things, and bestiality was shown reverence among them, so far as reverence was theirs to show.  So most of all they despised the discontent of the demi-gods, who dreamed of the courts of heaven and power over wind and snow; for what better, said the dwarfs, could demi-gods do than nose in the earth for roots and cover their faces with mire, and run with the cheerful goats and be even as they?  Now in their idleness caused by their discontent, the seed of the gods and the maidens grew more discontented still, and only spake of or cared for heavenly things; until the contempt of the dwarfs, who heard of all these doings, was bridled no longer and it must needs be war. They burned spice, dipped in blood and dried, before the chief of their witches, sharpening their axes, and made war on the demi-gods.  They passed by night over the Oolnar Mountains, each dwarf with his good axe, the old flint war-axe of his fathers, a night when no moon shone, and they went unshod, and swiftly, to come on the demi-gods in the darkness beyond the dells of Ulk, lying fat and idle and contemptible.  And before it was light they found the heathery lands, and the demi-gods lying lazy all over the side of a hill.  The dwarfs stole towards them warily in the darkness.  Now the art that the gods love most is the art of war: and when the seed of the gods and those nimble maidens awoke and found it was war it was almost as much to them as the godlike pursuits of heaven, enjoyed in the marble courts; or power over wind and snow.  They all drew out at once their swords of tempered bronze, cast down to them centuries since on stormy nights when their fathers, drew them and faced the dwarfs, and casting their idleness from them, fell on them, sword to axe.  And the dwarfs fought hard that night, and bruised the demi-gods sorely, hacking with those huge axes that had not spared the oaks.  Yet for all the weight of their blows and the cunning of their adventure, one point they had overlooked: _the demi-gods were immortal._  As the fight rolled on towards morning the fighters were fewer and fewer, yet for all the blows of the dwarfs men fell upon one side only.  Dawn came and the demi-gods were fighting against no more than six, and the hour that follows dawn, and the last of the dwarfs was gone.  And when the light was clear on that peak of the Bleaks of Eerie the eagle left his crag and flew grimly East, and found it was as he had hoped in the matter of blood.  But the demi-gods lay down in their heathery lands, for once content though so far from the courts of heaven, and even half forgot their heavenly rights, and sighed no more for power over wind and snow.     HOW THE GODS AVENGED MEOUL KI NING  Meoul Ki Ning was on his way with a lily from the lotus ponds of Esh to offer it to the Goddess of Abundance in her temple Aoul Keroon. And on the road from the pond to the little hill and the temple Aoul Keroon, Ap Ariph, his enemy, shot him with an arrow from a bow that he had made out of bamboo, and took his pretty lily up the hill and offered it to the Goddess of Abundance in her temple Aoul Keroon. And the Goddess was pleased with the gift, as all women are, and sent pleasant dreams to Ap Ariph for seven nights straight from the moon.  And on the seventh night the gods held conclave together, on the cloudy peaks they held it, above Narn, Ktoon, and Pti.  So high their peak arises that no man heard their voices.  They spake on that cloudy mountain (not the highest hamlet heard them).  \"What doth the Goddess of Abundance,\" (but naming her Lling, as they name her), \"what doth she sending sweet dreams for seven nights to Ap Ariph?\"  And the gods sent for their seer who is all eyes and feet, running to and fro on the Earth, observing the ways of men, seeing even their littlest doings, never deeming a doing too little, but knowing the web of the gods is woven of littlest things.  He it is that sees the cat in the garden of parakeets, the thief in the upper chamber, the sin of the child with the honey, the women talking indoors and the small hut's innermost things.  Standing before the gods he told them the case of Ap Ariph and the wrongs of Meoul Ki Ning and the rape of the lotus lily; he told of the cutting and making of Ap Ariph's bamboo bow, of the shooting of Meoul Ki Ning, and of how the arrow hit him, and the smile on the face of Lling when she came by the lotus bloom.  And the gods were wroth with Ap Ariph and swore to avenge Ki Ning.  And the ancient one of the gods, he that is older than Earth, called up the thunder at once, and raised his arms and cried out on the gods' high windy mountain, and prophesied on those rocks with runes that were older than speech, and sang in his wrath old songs that he had learned in storm from the sea, when only that peak of the gods in the whole of the earth was dry; and he swore that Ap Ariph should die that night, and the thunder raged about him, and the tears of Lling were vain.  The lightning stroke of the gods leaping earthward seeking Ap Ariph passed near to his house but missed him.  A certain vagabond was down from the hills, singing songs in the street near by the house of Ap Ariph, songs of a former folk that dwelt once, they say, in those valleys, and begging for rice and curds; it was him the lightning hit.  And the gods were satisfied, and their wrath abated, and their thunder rolled away and the great black clouds dissolved, and the ancient one of the gods went back to his age-old sleep, and morning came, and the birds and the light shone on the mountain, and the peak stood clear to see, the serene home of the gods.     THE GIFT OF THE GODS  There was once a man who sought a boon of the gods.  For peace was over the world and all things savoured of sameness, and the man was weary at heart and sighed for the tents and the warfields.  Therefore he sought a boon of the ancient gods.  And appearing before them he said to them, \"Ancient gods; there is peace in the land where I dwell, and indeed to the uttermost parts, and we are full weary of peace.  O ancient gods, grant us war!\"  And the ancient gods made him a war.  And the man went forth with his sword, and behold it was even war. And the man remembered the little things that he knew, and thought of the quiet days that there used to be, and at night on the hard ground dreamed of the things of peace.  And dearer and dearer grew the wonted things, the dull but easeful things of the days of peace, and remembering these he began to regret the war, and sought once more a boon of the ancient gods, and appearing before them he said: \"O ancient gods, indeed but a man loves best the days of peace. Therefore take back your war and give us peace, for indeed of all your blessedness peace is best.\"  And the man returned again to the haunts of peace.  But in a while the man grew weary of peace, of the things that he used to know, and the savour of sameness again; and sighing again for the tents, and appearing once more to the gods, he said to them: \"Ancient gods; we do not love your peace, for indeed the days are dull, and a man is best at war.\"  And the gods made him a war.  And there were drums again, the smoke of campfires again, wind in the waste again, the sound of horses of war, burning cities again, and the things that wanderers know; and the thoughts of that man went home to the ways of peace; moss upon lawns again, light in old spires again, sun upon gardens again, flowers in pleasant woods and sleep and the paths of peace.  And once more the man appeared to the ancient gods and sought from them one more boon, and said to them: \"Ancient gods; indeed but the world and we are a-weary of war and long for the ancient ways and the paths of peace.\"  So the gods took back their war and gave him peace.  But the man took counsel one day and communed long with himself and said to himself: \"Behold, the wishes I wish, which the gods grant, are not to be much desired; and if the gods should one day grant a wish and never revoke it, which is a way of the gods, I should be sorely tried because of my wish; my wishes are dangerous wishes and not to be desired.\"  And therefore he wrote an anonymous letter to the gods, writing: \"O ancient gods; this man that hath four times troubled you with his wishes, wishing for peace and war, is a man that hath no reverence for the gods, speaking ill of them on days when they do not hear, and speaking well of them on holy days and at the appointed hours when the gods are hearkening to prayer.  Therefore grant no more wishes to this impious man.\"  And the days of peace wore on and there arose again from the earth, like mist in the autumn from the fields that generations have ploughed, the savour of sameness again.  And the man went forth one morning and appeared once more to the gods, and cried: \"O ancient gods; give us but one war again, for I would be back to the camps and debateable borders of lands.\"  And the gods said: \"We hear not well of your way of life, yea ill things have come to our hearing, so that we grant no more the wishes you wish.\"     THE SACK OF EMERALDS  One bad October night in the high wolds beyond Wiltshire, with a north wind chaunting of winter, with the old leaves letting go their hold one by one from branches and dropping down to decay, with a mournful sound of owls, and in fearsome loneliness, there trudged in broken boots and in wet and windy rags an old man, stooping low under a sack of emeralds.  It were easy to see had you been travelling late on that inauspicious night, that the burden of the sack was far too great for the poor old man that bore it.  And had you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],["title","Tales of Three Hemispheres (#4)"],["body","a lantern in his face there was a look there of hopelessness and fatigue that would have told you it was no wish of his that kept him tottering on under that bloated sack.  When the menacing look of the night and its cheerless sounds, and the cold, and the weight of the sack, had all but brought him to the door of death, and he had dropped his sack onto the road and was dragging it on behind him, just as he felt that his final hour was come, and come (which was worse) as he held the accursed sack, just then he saw the bulk and the black shape of the Sign of the Lost Shepherd loom up by the ragged way.  He opened the door and staggered into the light and sank on a bench with his huge sack beside him.  All this you had seen had you been on that lonely road, so late on those bitter wolds, with their outlines vast and mournful in the dark, and their little clumps of trees sad with October.  But neither you nor I were out that night.  I did not see the poor old man and his sack until he sank down all of a heap in the lighted inn.  And Yon the blacksmith was there; and the carpenter, Willie Losh; and Jackers, the postman's son.  And they gave him a glass of beer. And the old man drank it up, still hugging his emeralds.  And at last they asked him what he had in his sack, the question he clearly dreaded; and he only clasped yet tighter the sodden sack and mumbled he had potatoes.  \"Potatoes,\" said Yon the blacksmith.  \"Potatoes,\" said Willie Losh.  And when he heard the doubt that was in their voices the old man shivered and moaned.  \"Potatoes, did you say?\" said the postman's son.  And they all three rose and tried to peer at the sack that the rain-soaked wayfarer so zealously sheltered.  And from the old man's fierceness I had said that, had it not been for that foul night on the roads and the weight he had carried so far and the fearful winds of October, he had fought with the blacksmith, the carpenter and the postman's son, all three, till he beat them away from his sack.  And weary and wet as he was he fought them hard.  I should no doubt have interfered; and yet the three men meant no harm to the wayfarer, but resented the reticence that he displayed to them though they had given him beer; it was to them as though a master key had failed to open a cupboard.  And, as for me, curiosity held me down to my chair and forbade me to interfere on behalf of the sack; for the old man's furtive ways, and the night out of which he came, and the hour of his coming, and the look of his sack, all made me long as much to know what he had, as even the blacksmith, the carpenter and the postman's son.  And then they found the emeralds.  They were all bigger than hazel nuts, hundreds and hundreds of them: and the old man screamed.  \"Come, come, we're not thieves,\" said the blacksmith.  \"We're not thieves,\" said the carpenter.  \"We're not thieves,\" said the postman's son.  And with awful fear on his face the wayfarer closed his sack, whimpering over his emeralds and furtively glancing round as though the loss of his secret were and utterly deadly thing.  And then they asked him to give them just one each, just one huge emerald each, because they had given him a glass of beer.  Then to see the wayfarer shrink against his sack and guard it with clutching fingers one would have said that he was a selfish man, were it not for the terror that was freezing his face.  I have seen men look sheer at Death with far less fear.  And they took their emerald all three, one enormous emerald each, while the old man hopelessly struggled till he saw his three emeralds go, and fell to the floor and wept, a pitiable, sodden heap.  And about that time I began to hear far off down the windy road, by which that sack had come, faintly at first and slowly louder and louder, the click clack clop of a lame horse coming nearer.  Click clack clop and a loose shoe rattling, the sound of a horse too weary to be out upon such a night, too lame to be out at all.  Click clack clop.  And all of a sudden the old wayfarer heard it; heard it above the sound of his won sobbing, and at once went white to the lips.  Such sudden fear as blanched him in a moment struck right to the hearts of all there.  They muttered to him that it was only their play, they hastily whispered excuses, they asked him what was wrong, but seemed scarcely to hope for an answer, nor did he speak, but sat with a frozen stare, all at once dry-eyed, a monument to terror.  Nearer and nearer came the click clack clop.  And when I saw the expression of that man's face and how its horror deepened as the ominous sound drew nearer, then I knew that something was wrong.  And looking for the last time upon all four I saw the wayfarer horror-struck by his sack and the other three crowding round to put their huge emeralds back then, even on such a night, I slipped away from the inn.  Outside the bitter wind roared in my ears, and close in the darkness the horse went click clack clop.  And as soon as my eyes could see at all in the night I saw a man in a huge hat looped up in front, wearing a sword in a scabbard shabby and huge, and looking blacker than the darkness, riding on a lean horse slowly up to the inn.  Whether his were the emeralds, or who he was, or why he rode a lame horse on such a night, I did not stop to discover, but went at once from the inn as he strode in his great black riding coat up to the door.  And that was the last that was ever seen of the wayfarer; the blacksmith, the carpenter or the postman's son.     THE OLD BROWN COAT  My friend, Mr. Douglas Ainslie, tells me that Sir James Barrie once told him this story.  The story, or rather the fragment, was as follows.  A man strolling into an auction somewhere abroad, I think it must have been France, for they bid in francs, found they were selling old clothes.  And following some idle whim he soon found himself bidding for an old coat.  A man bid against him, he bid against the man. Up and up went the price till the old coat was knocked down to him for twenty pounds.  As he went away with the coat he saw the other bidder looking at him with an expression of fury.  That's as far as the story goes.  But how, Mr. Ainslie asked me, did the matter develop, and why that furious look?  I at once made enquiries at a reliable source and have ascertained that the man's name was Peters, who thus oddly purchased a coat, and that he took it to the Rue de Rivoli, to a hotel where he lodged, from the little low, dark auction room by the Seine in which he concluded the bargain. There he examined it, off and on, all day and much of the next morning, a light brown overcoat with tails, without discovering any excuse, far less a reason, for having spent twenty pounds on so worn a thing.  And late next morning to his sitting room looking out on the Gardens of the Tuileries the man with the furious look was ushered in.  Grim he stood, silent and angry, till the guiding waiter went.  Not till then did he speak, and his words came clear and brief, welling up from deep emotions.  \"How did you dare to bid against me?\"  His name was Santiago.  And for many moments Peters found no excuse to offer, no apology, nothing in extenuation.  Lamely at last, weakly, knowing his argument to be of no avail, he muttered something to the intent that Mr. Santiago could have outbid him.  \"No,\" said the stranger.  \"We don't want all the town in this.  This is a matter between you and me.\"  He paused, then added in his fierce, curt way: \"A thousand pounds, no more.\"  Almost dumbly Peters accepted the offer and, pocketing the thousand pounds that was paid him, and apologizing for the inconvenience he had unwittingly caused, tried to show the stranger out.  But Santiago strode swiftly on before him, taking the coat, and was gone.  There followed between Peters and his second thoughts another long afternoon of bitter reproaches.  Why ever had he let go so thoughtlessly of a garment that so easily fetched a thousand pounds? And the more he brooded on this the more clearly did he perceive that he had lost an unusual opportunity of a first class investment of a speculative kind.  He knew men perhaps better than he knew materials; and, though he could not see in that old brown coat the value of so much as a thousand pounds, he saw far more than that in the man's eager need for it.  An afternoon of brooding over lost opportunities led to a night of remorse, and scarcely had day dawned when he ran to his sitting-room to see if he still had safe the card of Santiago. And there was the neat and perfumed _carte de visite_ with Santiago's Parisian address in the corner.  That morning he sought him out, and found Santiago seated at a table with chemicals and magnifying glasses beside him examining, as it lay spread wide before him, the old brown coat.  And Peters fancied he wore a puzzled air.  They came at once to business.  Peters was rich and asked Santiago to name his price, and that small dark man admitted financial straits, and so was willing to sell for thirty thousand pounds.  A little bargaining followed, the price came down and the old brown coat changed hands once more, for twenty thousand pounds.  Let any who may be inclined to doubt my story understand that in the City, as any respectable company promoter will tell them, twenty thousand pounds is invested almost daily with less return for it than an old tail coat.  And, whatever doubts Mr. Peters felt that day about the wisdom of his investment, there before him lay that tangible return, that something that may be actually fingered and seen, which is so often denied to the investor in gold mines and other Selected Investments.  Yet as the days wore on and the old coat grew no younger, nor any more wonderful, nor the least useful, but more and more like an ordinary old coat, Peters began once more to doubt his astuteness. Before the week was out his doubts had grown acute.  And then one morning, Santiago returned.  A man, he"]]]
