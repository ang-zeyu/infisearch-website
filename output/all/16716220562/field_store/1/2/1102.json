ADIC'IA, wife of the soldan, who incites him to distress the kingdom of Mercilla. When Mercilla sends her ambassador, Samient, to negotiate peace, Adicia, in violation of international law, thrusts her Samient out of doors like a dog, and sets two knights upon her. Sir Artegal comes to her rescue, attacks the two knights, and knocks one of them from his saddle with such force that he breaks his neck. After the discomfiture of the soldan, Adicia rushes forth with a knife to stab Samient, but, being intercepted by sir Artegal, is changed into a tigress.--Spenser, _Faery Queen_, v. 8 (1596).  [Illustration] The \"soldan\" is king Philip II. of Spain; \"Mercilla\" is queen Elizabeth; \"Adicia\" is Injustice personified, or the bigotry of popery; and \"Samient\" the ambassadors of Holland, who went to Philip for redress of grievances, and were most iniquitously detained by him as prisoners.

Shakespeare has a poem called _Venus and Adonis_. Shelley calls his elegy on the poet Keats _Adona'is_, under the idea that the untimely death of Keats resembled that of Adonis.  (_Adonis_ is an allegory of the sun, which is six months north of the horizon, and six months south. Thammuz is the same as Adonis, and so is Osiris).  ADONIRAM PENN, the obstinate and well-to-do farmer in Mary E. Wilkins's _Revolt of \"Mother_\".

Klopstock introduces him into _The Messiah_, and represents him as surpassing Satan in malice and guile, ambition and mischief. He is made to hate every one, even Satan, of whose rank he is jealous, and whom he hoped to overthrow, that by putting an end to his servitude he might become the supreme god of all the created worlds. At the crucifixion he and Satan are both driven back to hell by Obad'don, the angel of death.  ADRASTE' (_2 syl_.), a French gentleman, who inveigles a Greek slave named Isidore from don Pèdre. His plan is this: He gets introduced as a portrait-painter, and thus imparts to Isidore his love, and obtains her consent to elope with him. He then sends his slave Zaïde (_2 syl_.) to don Pèdre, to crave protection for ill treatment, and Pèdre promises to befriend her. At this moment Adraste appears, and demands that Zaïde be given up to him to punish as he thinks proper. Pèdre intercedes; Adraste seems to relent; and Pèdre calls for Zaïde. Out comes Isidore instead, with Zaïde's veil. \"There,\" says Pèdre, \"take her and use her well.\" \"I will do so,\" says the Frenchman, and leads off the Greek slave.--Molière, _Le Sicilien, ou L'Amour Peintre_ (1667).  ADRIAN'A, a wealthy Ephesian lady, who marries Antiph'olus, twin-brother of Antipholus of Syracuse. The abbess Aemilia is her mother-in-law, but she knows it not; and one day when she accuses her husband of infidelity, she says to the abbess, if he is unfaithful it is not from want of remonstrance, \"for it is the one subject of our conversation. In bed I will not let him sleep for speaking of it; at table I will not let him eat for speaking of it; when alone with him I talk of nothing else, and in company I give him frequent hints of it. In a word, all my talk is how vile and bad it is in him to love another better than he loves his wife\" (act v. sc. 1).--Shakespeare, _Comedy of Errors_ (1593).

According to Geoffrey of Monmouth \"Brutus,\" the first king of Britain (from whom the island was called _Britain_), was a descendant of Æneas.  AENE'ID, the epic poem of Virgil, in twelve books. When Troy was taken by the Greeks and set on fire, Aene'as, with his father, son, and wife, took flight, with the intention of going to Italy, the original birthplace of the family. The wife was lost, and the old father died on the way; but after numerous perils by sea and land, Æneas and his son Asca'nius reached Italy. Here Latïnus, the reigning king, received the exiles hospitably, and promised his daughter Lavin'ia in marriage to Æneas; but she had been already betrothed by her mother to prince Turnus, son of Daunus, king of Ru'tuli, and Turnus would not forego his claim.

AE'OLUS, god of the winds, which he keeps imprisoned in a cave in the Æolian Islands, and lets free as he wishes or as the over-gods command.

AFRICAN MAGICIAN (_The_), pretended to Aladdin to be his uncle, and sent the lad to fetch the \"wonderful lamp\" from an underground cavern. As Aladdin refused to hand it to the magician, he shut him in the cavern and left him there. Aladdin contrived to get out by virtue of a magic ring, and learning the secret of the lamp, became immensely rich, built a superb palace, and married the sultan's daughter. Several years after, the African resolved to make himself master of the lamp, and accordingly walked up and down before the palace, crying incessantly, \"Who will change old lamps for new!\" Aladdin being on a hunting excursion, his wife sent a eunuch to exchange the \"wonderful lamp\" for a new one; and forthwith the magician commanded \"the slaves of the lamp\" to transport the palace and all it contained into Africa.

AGAG, in Dryden's satire of _Absalom and Achit'ophel_, is sir Edmondbury Godfrey, the magistrate, who was found murdered in a ditch near Primrose Hill.

AGAMEMNON, king of the Argives and commander-in-chief of the allied Greeks in the siege of Troy. Introduced by Shakespeare in his _Troilus and Cres'sida_.  _Vixere fortes ante Agamem'nona_, \"There were brave men before Agamemnon;\" we are not to suppose that there were no great and good men in former times. A similar proverb is, \"There are hills beyond Pentland and fields beyond Forth.\"  AGANDECCA, daughter of Starno king of Lochlin [_Scandinavia_], promised in marriage to Fingal king of Morven [_north-west of Scotland_]. The maid told Fingal to beware of her father, who had set an ambush to kill him. Fingal, being thus forewarned, slew the men in ambush; and Starno, in rage, murdered his daughter, who was buried by Fingal in Ardven [_Argyll_].    The daughter of the snow overheard, and left   the hall of her secret sigh. She came in all her   beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the east.   Loveliness was around her as light. Her step   was like the music of songs. She saw the youth,   and loved him. He was the stolen sigh of her   soul. Her blue eyes rolled in secret on him, and   she blessed the chief of Morven.--_Ossian_ (\"Fingal,\"   iii.)  AGANIP'PE (4 syl.), fountain of the Muses, at the foot of mount Helicon, in Boeo'tia.    From Helicon's harmonious springs   A thousand rills their mazy progress take.  Gray, _Progress of Poetry_.  AG'APE (3 syl.) the fay. She had three sons at a birth, Primond, Diamond, and Triamond. Being anxious to know the future lot of her sons, she went to the abyss of Demogorgon, to consult the \"Three Fatal Sisters.\" Clotho showed her the threads, which \"were thin as those spun by a spider.\" She begged the fates to lengthen the life-threads, but they said this could not be; they consented, however, to this agreement--    When ye shred with fatal knife   His line which is the eldest of the three,   Eftsoon his life may pass into the next:   And when the next shall likewise ended be,   That both their lives may likewise be annext   Unto the third, that his may so be trebly wext.

AGAST'YA (3 _syl._), a dwarf who drank the sea dry. As he was walking one day with Vishnoo, the insolent ocean asked the god who the pigmy was that strutted by his side. Vishnoo replied it was the patriarch Agastya, who was going to restore earth to its true balance. Ocean, in contempt, spat its spray in the pigmy's face, and the sage, in revenge of this affront, drank the waters of the ocean, leaving the bed quite dry.--Maurice.  AG'ATHA, daughter of Cuno, and the betrothed of Max, in Weber's opera of _Der Freischütz._--See _Dictionary of Phrase and Fable._  AGATH'OCLES (4 _syl_.) tyrant of Sicily.

Voltaire has a tragedy called _Agathocle_, and Caroline Pichler has an excellent German novel entitled _Agathoclés_.  AGATHON, the hero and title of a philosophic romance, by C. M.

Personified in the being who presided over the Acrasian \"bowre of blis.\"    That is our selfe, whom though we do not see   Yet each doth in himselfe it well perceive to bee.    Therefore a God him sage Antiquity   Did wisely make, and good Agdistes call--    Spenser, _Faerie Queene_, ii. 12.  AGDISTIS, a genius of human form, uniting the two senses and born of an accidental union between Jupiter and Tellus. The story of Agdistis and Atys is apparently a myth of the generative powers of nature.  AGED (_The_), so Wemmick's father is called. He lived in \"the castle at Walworth.\" Wemmick at \"the castle\" and Wemmick in business are two \"different beings.\"    Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage,   in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of   it was cut out and"]]]
