A long and minute inspection of this bit of lace, which he was careful not to detach as yet from the place in which he found it, showed that it was ragged, and frayed, and fast caught where it hung. It could not have been blown there by any chance air; it must have been torn from the article to which it belonged, whatever that might be,--head-dress, nightcap, night-dress, or handkerchief. The lace was of a kind to serve any of these purposes.  Inspecting further, M. Floçon made a second discovery. On the small table under the window was a short length of black jet beading, part of the trimming or ornamentation of a lady's dress.  These two objects of feminine origin--one partly outside the car, the other near it, but quite inside--gave rise to many conjectures. It led, however, to the inevitable conclusion that a woman had been at some time or other in the berth. M. Floçon could not but connect these two finds with the fact of the open window. The latter might, of course, have been the work of the murdered man himself at an earlier hour. Yet it is unusual, as the detective imagined, for a passenger, and especially an Italian, to lie under an open window in a sleeping-berth when travelling by express train before daylight in March.  Who opened that window, then, and why? Perhaps some further facts might be found on the outside of the car. With this idea, M. Floçon left it, and passed on to the line or permanent way.  Here he found himself a good deal below the level of the car. These sleepers have no foot-boards like ordinary carriages; access to them is gained from a platform by the steps at each end. The Chief was short of stature, and he could only approach the window outside by calling one of the guards and ordering him to make the small ladder (_faire la petite echelle_). This meant stooping and giving a back, on which little M. Floçon climbed nimbly, and so was raised to the necessary height.  A close scrutiny revealed nothing unusual. The exterior of the car was encrusted with the mud and dust gathered in the journey, none of which appeared to have been disturbed.  M. Floçon reëntered the carriage neither disappointed nor pleased; his mind was in an open state, ready to receive any impressions, and as yet only one that was at all clear and distinct was borne in on him.  This was the presence of the lace and the jet beads in the theatre of the crime. The inference was fair and simple. He came logically and surely to this:  1. That some woman had entered the compartment.  2. That whether or not she had come in before the crime, she was there after the window had been opened, which was not done by the murdered man.  3. That she had leaned out, or partly passed out, of the window at some time or other, as the scrap of lace testified.  4. Why had she leaned out? To seek some means of exit or escape, of course.  But escape from whom? from what? The murderer? Then she must know him, and unless an accomplice (if so, why run from him?), she would give up her knowledge on compulsion, if not voluntarily, as seemed doubtful, seeing she (his suspicions were consolidating) had not done so already.  But there might be another even stronger reason to attempt escape at such imminent risk as leaving an express train at full speed. To escape from her own act and the consequences it must entail--escape from horror first, from detection next, and then from arrest and punishment.  All this would imperiously impel even a weak woman to face the worst peril, to look out, lean out, even try the terrible but impossible feat of climbing out of the car.  So M. Floçon, by fair process of reasoning, reached a point which incriminated one woman, the only woman possible, and that was the titled, high-bred lady who called herself the Contessa di Castagneto.  This conclusion gave a definite direction to further search. Consulting the rough plan which he had constructed to take the place of the missing train card, he entered the compartment which the Countess had occupied, and which was actually next door.  It was in the tumbled, untidy condition of a sleeping-place but just vacated. The sex and quality of its recent occupant were plainly apparent in the goods and chattels lying about, the property and possessions of a delicate, well-bred woman of the world, things still left as she had used them last--rugs still unrolled, a pair of easy-slippers on the floor, the sponge in its waterproof bag on the bed, brushes, bottles, button-hook, hand-glass, many things belonging to the dressing-bag, not yet returned to that receptacle. The maid was no doubt to have attended to all these, but as she had not come, they remained unpacked and strewn about in some disorder.  M. Floçon pounced down upon the contents of the berth, and commenced an immediate search for a lace scarf, or any wrap or cover with lace.  He found nothing, and was hardly disappointed. It told more against the Countess, who, if innocent, would have no reason to conceal or make away with a possibly incriminating possession, the need for which she could not of course understand.  Next, he handled the dressing-bag, and with deft fingers replaced everything.  Everything was forthcoming but one glass bottle, a small one, the absence of which he noted, but thought of little consequence, till, by and by, he came upon it under peculiar circumstances.  Before leaving the car, and after walking through the other compartments, M. Floçon made an especially strict search of the corner where the porter had his own small chair, his only resting-place, indeed, throughout the journey. He had not forgotten the attendant's condition when first examined, and he had even then been nearly satisfied that the man had been hocussed, narcotized, drugged.  Any doubts were entirely removed by his picking up near the porter's seat a small silver-topped bottle and a handkerchief, both marked with coronet and monogram, the last of which, although the letters were much interlaced and involved, were decipherable as S.L.L.C.  It was that of the Countess, and corresponded with the marks on her other belongings. He put it to his nostril, and recognized at once by its smell that it had contained tincture of laudanum, or some preparation of that drug.   CHAPTER V  M. Floçon was an experienced detective, and he knew so well that he ought to be on his guard against the most plausible suggestions, that he did not like to make too much of these discoveries. Still, he was distinctly satisfied, if not exactly exultant, and he went back towards the station with a strong predisposition against the Contessa di Castagneto.  Just outside the waiting-room, however, his assistant, Galipaud, met him with news which rather dashed his hopes, and gave a new direction to his thoughts.  The lady's maid was not to be found.  \"Impossible!\" cried the Chief, and then at once suspicion followed surprise.  \"I have looked, monsieur, inquired everywhere; the maid has not been seen. She certainly is not here.\"  \"Did she go through the barrier with the other passengers?\"  \"No one knows; no one remembers her; not even the conductor. But she has gone. That is positive.\"  \"Yet it was her duty to be here; to attend to her service. Her mistress would certainly want her--has asked for her! Why should she run away?\"  This question presented itself as one of infinite importance, to be pondered over seriously before he went further into the inquiry.  Did the Countess know of this disappearance?  She had asked imploringly for her maid. True, but might that not be a blind? Women are born actresses, and at need can assume any part, convey any impression. Might not the Countess have wished to be dissociated from the maid, and therefore have affected complete ignorance of her flight?  \"I will try her further,\" said M. Floçon to himself.  But then, supposing that the maid had taken herself off of her own accord? Why was it? Why had she done so? Because--because she was afraid of something. If so, of what? No direct accusation could be brought against her on the face of it. She had not been in the sleeping-car at the time of the murder, while the Countess as certainly was; and, according to strong presumption, in the very compartment where the deed was done. If the maid was afraid, why was she afraid?  Only on one possible hypothesis. That she was either in collusion with the Countess, or possessed of some guilty knowledge tending to incriminate the Countess and probably herself. She had run away to avoid any inconvenient questioning tending to get her mistress into trouble, which would react probably on herself.  \"We must press the Countess on this point closely; I will put it plainly to M. le Juge,\" said the detective, as he entered the private room set apart for the police authorities, where he found M. Beaumont le Hardi, the instructing judge, and the Commissary of the Quartier (arrondissement).  A lengthy conference followed among the officials. M. Floçon told all he knew, all he had discovered, gave his views with all the force and fluency of a public prosecutor, and was congratulated warmly on the progress he had made.  \"I agree with you, sir,\" said the instructing judge: \"we must have in the Countess first, and pursue the line indicated as regards the missing maid.\"  \"I will fetch her, then. Stay, what can be going on in there?\" cried M. Floçon, rising from his seat and running into the outer waiting-room, which, to his surprise and indignation, he found in great confusion.  The guard who was on duty was struggling, in personal conflict almost, with the English General. There was a great hubbub of voices, and the Countess was lying back half-fainting in her chair.  \"What's all this? How dare you, sir?\"  This to the General, who now had the man by the throat with one hand and with the other was preventing him from drawing his sword. \"Desist--forbear! You are opposing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11451"],["title","The Rome Express (#4)"],["body","authority; desist, or I will call in assistance and will have you secured and removed.\"  The little Chief's blood was up; he spoke warmly, with all the force and dignity of an official who sees the law outraged.  \"It is entirely the fault of this ruffian of yours; he has behaved most brutally,\" replied Sir Charles, still holding him tight.  \"Let him go, monsieur; your behaviour is inexcusable. What! you, a military officer of the highest rank, to assault a sentinel! For shame! This is unworthy of you!\"  \"He deserves to be scragged, the beast!\" went on the General, as with one sharp turn of the wrist he threw the guard off, and sent him flying nearly across the room, where, being free at last, the Frenchman drew his sword and brandished it threateningly--from a distance.  But M. Floçon interposed with uplifted hand and insisted upon an explanation.  \"It is just this,\" replied Sir Charles, speaking fast and with much fierceness: \"that lady there--poor thing, she is ill, you can see that for yourself, suffering, overwrought; she asked for a glass of water, and this brute, triple brute, as you say in French, refused to bring it.\"  \"I could not leave the room,\" protested the guard. \"My orders were precise.\"  \"So I was going to fetch the water,\" went on the General angrily, eying the guard as though he would like to make another grab at him, \"and this fellow interfered.\"  \"Very properly,\" added M. Floçon.  \"Then why didn't he go himself, or call some one? Upon my word, monsieur, you are not to be complimented upon your people, nor your methods. I used to think that a Frenchman was gallant, courteous, especially to ladies.\"  The Chief looked a little disconcerted, but remembering what he knew against this particular lady, he stiffened and said severely, \"I am responsible for my conduct to my superiors, and not to you. Besides, you appear to forget your position. You are here, detained--all of you\"--he spoke to the whole room--\"under suspicion. A ghastly crime has been perpetrated--by some one among you--\"  \"Do not be too sure of that,\" interposed the irrepressible General.  \"Who else could be concerned? The train never stopped after leaving Laroche,\" said the detective, allowing himself to be betrayed into argument.  \"Yes, it did,\" corrected Sir Charles, with a contemptuous laugh; \"shows how much you know.\"  Again the Chief looked unhappy. He was on dangerous ground, face to face with a new fact affecting all his theories,--if fact it was, not mere assertion, and that he must speedily verify. But nothing was to be gained--much, indeed, might be lost--by prolonging this discussion in the presence of the whole party. It was entirely opposed to the French practice of investigation, which works secretly, taking witnesses separately, one by one, and strictly preventing all intercommunication or collusion among them.  \"What I know or do not know is my affair,\" he said, with an indifference he did not feel. \"I shall call upon you, M. le Général, for your statement in due course, and that of the others.\" He bowed stiffly to the whole room. \"Every one must be interrogated. M. le Juge is now here, and he proposes to begin, madame, with you.\"  The Countess gave a little start, shivered, and turned very pale.  \"Can't you see she is not equal to it?\" cried the General, hotly. \"She has not yet recovered. In the name of--I do not say chivalry, for that would be useless--but of common humanity, spare madame, at least for the present.\"  \"That is impossible, quite impossible. There are reasons why Madame la Comtesse should be examined first. I trust, therefore, she will make an effort.\"  \"I will try, if you wish it.\" She rose from her chair and walked a few steps rather feebly, then stopped.  \"No, no, Countess, do not go,\" said Sir Charles, hastily, in English, as he moved across to where she stood and gave her his hand. \"This is sheer cruelty, sir, and cannot be permitted.\"  \"Stand aside!\" shouted M. Floçon; \"I forbid you to approach that lady, to address her, or communicate with her. Guard, advance, do your duty.\"  But the guard, although his sword was still out of its sheath, showed great reluctance to move. He had no desire to try conclusions again with this very masterful person, who was, moreover, a general; as he had seen service, he had a deep respect for generals, even of foreign growth.  Meanwhile the General held his ground and continued his conversation with the Countess, speaking still in English, thus exasperating M. Floçon, who did not understand the language, almost to madness.  \"This is not to be borne!\" he cried. \"Here, Galipaud, Block;\" and when his two trusty assistants came rushing in, he pointed furiously to the General. \"Seize him, remove him by force if necessary. He shall go to the _violon_--to the nearest lock-up.\"  The noise attracted also the Judge and the Commissary, and there were now six officials in all, including the guard, all surrounding the General, a sufficiently imposing force to overawe even the most recalcitrant fire-eater.  But now the General seemed to see only the comic side of the situation, and he burst out laughing.  \"What, all of you? How many more? Why not bring up cavalry and artillery, horse, foot, and guns?\" he asked, derisively. \"All to prevent one old man from offering his services to one weak woman! Gentlemen, my regards!\"  \"Really, Charles, I fear you are going too far,\" said his brother the clergyman, who, however, had been manifestly enjoying the whole scene.  \"Indeed, yes. It is not necessary, I assure you,\" added the Countess, with tears of gratitude in her big brown eyes. \"I am most touched, most thankful. You are a true soldier, a true English gentleman, and I shall never forget your kindness.\" Then she put her hand in his with a pretty, winning gesture that was reward enough for any man.  Meanwhile, the Judge, the senior official present, had learned exactly what had happened, and he now addressed the General with a calm but stern rebuke.  \"Monsieur will not, I trust, oblige us to put in force the full power of the law. I might, if I chose, and as I am fully entitled, commit you at once to Mazas, to keep you in solitary confinement. Your conduct has been deplorable, well calculated to traverse and impede justice. But I am willing to believe that you were led away, not unnaturally, as a gallant gentleman,--it is the characteristic of your nation, of your cloth,--and that on more mature consideration you will acknowledge and not repeat your error.\"  M. Beaumont le Hardi was a grave, florid, soft-voiced person, with a bald head and a comfortably-lined white waistcoat; one who sought his ends by persuasion, not force, but who had the instincts of a gentleman, and little sympathy with the peremptory methods of his more inflammable colleague.  \"Oh, with all my heart, monsieur,\" said Sir Charles, cordially. \"You saw, or at least know, how this has occurred. I did not begin it, nor was I the most to blame. But I was in the wrong, I admit. What do you wish me to do now?\"  \"Give me your promise to abide by our rules,--they may be irksome, but we think them necessary,--and hold no further converse with your companions.\"  \"Certainly, certainly, monsieur,--at least after I have said one word more to Madame la Comtesse.\"  \"No, no, I cannot permit even that--\"  But Sir Charles, in spite of the warning finger held up by the Judge, insisted upon crying out to her, as she was being led into the other room:  \"Courage, dear lady, courage. Don't let them bully you. You have nothing to fear.\"  Any further defiance of authority was now prevented by her almost forcible removal from the room.   CHAPTER VI  The stormy episode just ended had rather a disturbing effect on M. Floçon, who could scarcely give his full attention to all the points, old and new, that had now arisen in the investigation. But he would have time to go over them at his leisure, while the work of interrogation was undertaken by the Judge.  The latter had taken his seat at a small table, and just opposite was his _greffier_, or clerk, who was to write down question and answer, _verbatim_. A little to one side, with the light full on the face, the witness was seated, bearing the scrutiny of three pairs of eyes--the Judge first, and behind him, those of the Chief Detective and the Commissary of Police.  \"I trust, madame, that you are equal to answering a few questions?\" began M. le Hardi, blandly.  \"Oh, yes, I hope so. Indeed, I have no choice,\" replied the Countess, bravely resigned.  \"They will refer principally to your maid.\"  \"Ah!\" said the Countess, quickly and in a troubled voice, yet she bore the gaze of the three officials without flinching.  \"I want to know a little more about her, if you please.\"  \"Of course. Anything I know I will tell you.\" She spoke now with perfect self-possession. \"But if I might ask--why this interest?\"  \"I will tell you frankly. You asked for her, we sent for her, and--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"She cannot be found. She is not in the station.\"  The Countess all but jumped from her chair in her surprise--surprise that seemed too spontaneous to be feigned.  \"Impossible! it cannot be. She would not dare to leave me here like this, all alone.\"  \"_Parbleu_! she has dared. Most certainly she is not here.\"  \"But what can have become of her?\"  \"Ah, madame, what indeed? Can you form any idea? We hoped you might have been able to enlighten us.\"  \"I cannot, monsieur, not in the least.\"  \"Perchance you sent her on to your hotel to warn your friends that you were detained? To fetch them, perhaps, to you in your trouble?\"  The trap was neatly contrived, but she was not deceived.  \"How could I? I knew of no trouble when I saw her last.\"  \"Oh, indeed? and when was that?\"  \"Last night, at Amberieux, as I have already told that gentleman.\" She pointed to M. Floçon, who was obliged to nod his head.  \"Well, she has gone away somewhere. It does not much matter, still it is odd, and for your sake we should like to help you to"]]]
