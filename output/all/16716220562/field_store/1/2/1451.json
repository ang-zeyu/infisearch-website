If, instead of the glad tidings that      there exists a Being in whom all the excellences which the      highest human form can conceive, exist in a degree      inconceivable to us, I am informed that the world is ruled      by a being whose attributes are infinite, but what they are      we cannot learn, except that the highest human morality does      not sanction them--convince me of this and I will hear my      fate as I may. But when I am told that I must believe this,      and at the same time call this being by the names which      express and affirm the highest human morality, I say, in      plain terms, that I will not. Whatever power such a being      may have over me, there is one thing he shall not do; he      shall not compel me to worship him. I will call no being      good who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet to my      fellow-creatures; and if such a being can sentence me to      hell for not so calling him, to hell I will go.'  This concluding declaration is memorable in many ways. Mr Mill announces his resolution to determine for himself, and according to his own reason and conscience, what God he will worship, and what God he will not worship. For ourselves, we cordially sympathize with his resolution. But Mr Mill must be aware that this is a point on which society is equally resolved that no individual shall determine for himself, if they can help it.[6] Each new-born child finds his religious creed ready prepared for him. In his earliest days of unconscious infancy, the stamp of the national, gentile, phratric, God, or Gods, is imprinted upon him by his elders; and if the future man, in the exercise of his own independent reason, acquires such convictions as compel him to renounce those Gods, proclaiming openly that he does so--he must count upon such treatment as will go far to spoil the value of the present life to him, even before he passes to those ulterior liabilities which Mr Mill indicates in the distance. We are not surprised that a declaration so unusual and so impressive should have been often cited in critical notices of this volume; that during the month preceding the last Westminster election, it was studiously brought forward by some opponents of Mr Mill, and more or less regretted by his friends, as likely to offend many electors, and damage his chance of success; and that a conspicuous and noble-minded ecclesiastic, the Dean of Westminster, thought the occasion so grave as to come forward with his characteristic generosity, for the purpose of shielding a distinguished man suspected of heresy.  The sublime self-assertion, addressed by Prometheus to Zeus, under whose sentence he was groaning, has never before been put into such plain English.[7] Mr Mill's declaration reminds us also of Hippolytus, the chaste and pure youth, whose tragic fate is so beautifully described by Euripides. Hippolytus is exemplary in his devotions to the Goddess Artemis; but he dissents from all his countrymen, and determines for himself, in refusing to bestow the smallest mark of honour or worship upon Aphroditê, because he considers her to be a very bad Goddess.[8] In this refusal he persists with inflexible principle (even after having received, from an anxious attendant, warning of the certain ruin which it will bring upon him), until the insulted Aphroditê involves him, along with the unhappy Phædra and Theseus himself, in one common abyss of misery. In like manner Mr Mill's declaration stands in marked contrast with the more cautious proceeding of men like Herodotus. That historian, alike pious and prudent, is quite aware that all the Gods are envious and mischief-making, and expressly declares them to be so.[9] Yet, far from refusing to worship them on that account, he is assiduous in prayer and sacrifice--perhaps, indeed, all the more assiduous in consequence of what he believes about their attributes;[10] being persuaded (like the attendant who warned Hippolytus) that his only chance of mollifying their ungentle dispositions in regard to himself is, by honorific tribute in words and offerings.  When, however, after appreciating as we are bound to do Mr Mill's declaration of subjective sentiment, we pass to its logical bearing on the controversy between him and Mr Mansel, we are obliged to confess that in this point of view it has little objective relevancy. The problem was, how to reconcile the actual evil and suffering in the universe (which is recited as a fact by Mr Mansel, though in terms conveying a most inadequate idea of its real magnitude) with the goodness of God. Mr Mill repudiates the explanatory hypothesis tendered by Mr Mansel, as a solution, but without suggesting any better hypothesis of his own. For ourselves, we are far from endorsing Mr Mansel's solution as satisfactory; yet we can hardly be surprised if he considers it less unsatisfactory than no solution at all. And when we reflect how frequently and familiarly predicates applicable to man are applied to the Supreme Being, when they cannot possibly be understood about Him in the same sense--we see no ground for treating the proceeding as disingenuous, which Mr Mill is disposed to do. Indeed, it cannot easily be avoided: and Mr Mill himself furnishes us with some examples in the present volume. At page 491, he says:--       'It would be difficult to find a stronger argument in favour      of Theism, than that the eye must have been made by one who      sees, and the ear by one who hears.'  In the words here employed, _seeing_ and _hearing_ are predicted of God.  Now when we predicate of men, that they _see_ or _hear_, we affirm facts of extreme complexity, especially in the case of _seeing_; facts partly physical, partly mental, involving multifarious movements and agencies of nerves, muscles, and other parts of the organism, together with direct sensational impressions, and mental reconstruction of the past, inseparably associated therewith; all which, so far as they are known, are perspicuously enumerated in the work of Professor Bain[11] on the 'Senses and the Intellect,' Again, Mr Mill speaks (in p. 102 and elsewhere) of 'the veracity of God.' When we say of our neighbour that he is a veracious man, we ascribe to him a habit of speaking the truth; that is, of employing his physical apparatus of speech, and his mental power of recalling and recombining words lodged in the memory, for the purpose of asserting no other propositions except such as declare facts which he knows, or beliefs which he really entertains. But how either _seeing_, or _hearing_, or _veracity_, in these senses, can be predicated of God, we are at a loss to understand. And if they are to be predicated of God in a different sense, this admits the same license as Mr Mansel contends for in respect to Goodness, when he feels that undeniable facts preclude him from predicating that epithet univocally respecting God and respecting man.[12]  On the whole, it seems to us, that though Mr Mill will consent to worship only a God of perfect goodness, he has thrown no new light on the grave problem--frankly stated though imperfectly solved, by Mr Mansel--how such a conception of God is to be reconciled with the extent of evil and suffering actually pervading human life and animal life throughout the earth. We are compelled to say, respecting Mr Mill's treatment of this subject--what we should not say respecting his treatment of any other--that he has left an old perplexing problem not less perplexing than he found it.  Reverting, not unwillingly, from theology to philosophy, we now pass on to Mr Mill's ninth chapter (p. 128 seq.), of the Interpretation of Consciousness. There is assuredly no lesson more requiring to be taught than the proper mode of conducting such interpretation; for the number of different modes in which Consciousness has been interpreted is astonishing. Mr Mill begins by citing from Sir W. Hamilton's lectures a passage of some length, upon which he bestows considerable praise, regarding it as--       'One of the proofs that, whatever may be the positive value      of his (Sir W. Hamilton's) achievements in metaphysics, he      had a greater capacity for the subject than many      metaphysicians of high reputation; and particularly than      his two distinguished predecessors in the same school of      thought--\"Reid and Stewart.\"'--p. 131.  This is one of the greatest compliments to Sir W. Hamilton that the book contains, and as such we are glad to cite it.  On the subject of Consciousness, Mr Mill has cited from Sir W. Hamilton other good observations besides the one last alluded to; but, unfortunately, these are often neutralized by opposite or inconsistent opinions also cited from other parts of his works. The number of such inconsistencies produced is indeed one remarkable feature in Sir W. Hamilton's philosophical character. He seems to follow out energetically (as Plato in his various dialogues) the vein of thought pervading his mind at each particular moment, without troubling himself to look back upon his own prior speculations. Even compared with the best views of Sir W. Hamilton, however, Mr Mill's mode of handling the subject of Consciousness exhibits signal improvement. To some of his observations we shall call particular attention.  All philosophers agree that what Consciousness testifies is to be believed; but they differ much on the question--To what points Consciousness does testify? and even on the still deeper question--How shall we proceed to ascertain what _are_ these attested points? What is the proper method of studying or interrogating Consciousness? Upon this Mr Mill remarks (pp. 145--147):--       'Here emerges the distinction between two different methods      of studying the problems of metaphysics; forming the radical      difference between the two great schools into which      metaphysicians are divided. One of these I shall call for      distinction, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12002"],["title","Review of the Work of Mr John Stuart Mill Entitled, 'Examination of Sir William (#5)"],["body","method; the other, the      _psychological_. M. Cousin observes that Locke went wrong      from the beginning, by placing before himself, as the      question to be first resolved, the origin of our ideas.      This (he says) was commencing at the wrong end. The proper      course would have been to begin by determining what the      ideas now are; to ascertain what it is that Consciousness      now tells us; postponing till afterwards the attempt to      frame a theory concerning the origin of any of the mental      phenomena.       'I accept the question as M. Cousin states it; and I contend      that no attempt to determine what are the direct revelations      of Consciousness can be successful, or entitled to any      regard, unless preceded by what M. Cousin says ought only to      follow it--an inquiry into the origin of our acquired ideas.      For we have it not in our power to ascertain, by any direct      process, what Consciousness told us at the time when its      revelations were in their pristine purity. It only offers      itself to our inspection, as it exists now, when those      original revelations are overlaid and buried under a      mountainous heap of acquired notions and perceptions.       'It seems to M. Cousin, that if we examine with care and      minuteness our present states of Consciousness,      distinguishing and defining every ingredient which we find      to enter into them--every element that we seem to recognize      as real, and cannot \"by merely concentrating our attention      upon it analyze into anything simpler--we reach the ultimate      and primary truths, which are the sources of all our      knowledge, and which cannot be denied or doubted without      denying or doubting the evidence of Consciousness      itself--that is, the only evidence that there is for      anything. I maintain this to be a misconception of the      condition imposed on inquirers by the difficulties of      psychological investigation. To begin the inquiry at the      point where M. Cousin takes it up is, in fact, to beg the      question. For he must be aware, if not of the fact, at least      of the belief of his opponents, that the laws of the      mind--the Laws of Association, according to one class of      thinkers, the Categories of the Understanding, according to      another--are capable of creating, out of those data of      Consciousness which are uncontested, purely mental      conceptions, which become so identified in thought with all      our states of Consciousness, that _we seem, and cannot but      seem, to receive them by direct intuition_. For example, the      belief in matter in the opinion of these thinkers is, or at      least may be, thus produced:--       '\"The proof that any of the alleged Universal Beliefs, or      Principles of Common Sense, are affirmations of      Consciousness--supposes two things: that the beliefs exist,      and that they cannot possibly have been acquired. The first      is, in most cases, undisputed; but the second is a subject      of inquiry which often taxes the utmost resources of      psychologists. Locke was therefore right in believing that      'the origin of our ideas' is the main stress of the problem      of mental science, and the subject which must be first      considered in forming the theory of the Mind.\"'  This citation from Mr Mill's book is already almost too long, yet we could have wished to prolong it still more, from the importance of some of the succeeding paragraphs. It presents, in clear discrimination and contrast, two opposite points of view according to which the phenomena of mind are regarded by different philosophers, and the method of studying them determined: the _introspective_ method, adopted by M. Cousin and others--the _psychological_ or analytical method, pursued by Locke and by many other eminent men since Locke--'the known and approved method of physical science, adapted to the necessities of psychology'--(p. 148).  There are passages of Sir W. Hamilton's writings in which he appears to feel that the _introspective_ method alone is insufficient for the interpretation of Consciousness, and that the analytical method must be employed to reinforce it. But on this as on other points he is not always consistent with himself. For in laying down the principle upon which the primary truths of Consciousness, the original data of intelligence, are to be ascertained and distinguished from generalizations out of experience and custom, he declares that the one single and certain mark is Necessity--they must be beliefs which we are under the necessity of believing--of which we cannot get rid by any mental effort. He decides this, of course, for himself, by the _introspective_ method alone. He (with M. Cousin and other philosophers who take the same view) does not apply the analytical method to inquire whether his necessity of belief may not be a purely acquired necessity and nowise congenital. It is, indeed, remarkable that these philosophers do not even seek to apply the introspective method as far as that method will really go. They are satisfied with introspection of their own present minds; without collecting results of the like process as applied to other minds, in different times and places. They declare various beliefs to be necessary to the human mind universally, merely because such is the actual fact with their own minds and with those immediately around them; sometimes even in defiance of proof that there are (or have been) persons not sharing such beliefs, and occasionally even believing the contrary; therefore, when even the introspective method really disallows their affirmative instead of sustaining it. This is, in truth, an abuse of the introspective method; yet even if that method were employed in its fullest extent--if the same incapability of believing otherwise could be shown as common to all mankind--it might still be only the effect of a strong association. The analytical method must still be called in to ascertain whether we are forced to suppose such incapability to be an original fact of consciousness, or whether it may not have been generated in the mind by circumstances under the natural working of the laws of association. It is certain that these laws not only may, but must, give birth to artificial inconceivabilities in the mind--and that some of these may be equal in strength to such, if any, as are natural.       'The History of Science' (says Mr Mill, following out the      same train of reasoning which we read in the third Book of      his 'System of Logic') 'teems with inconceivabilities which      have been conquered; and with supposed necessary truths,      which have first ceased to be thought necessary, then to be      thought true, and have finally come to be deemed      impossible.'--p. 150.  After various observations, chiefly exhibiting the rashness of many censures bestowed by Sir W. Hamilton on Brown, Mr Mill gives us three valuable chapters (xi., xii., xiii.), wherein he analyzes the belief in an External World, the Belief in Mind as a separate substance or Noumenon, and the Primary Qualities of Matter. To each of these topics he applies what he calls the _psychological_ method, as contrasted with the simply _introspective_ method of Sir W. Hamilton (the Ego and Non-Ego affirmed to be given together in the primary deliverance of Consciousness) and so many other philosophers. He proves that these beliefs are no way intuitive, but acquired products; and that the known laws of Association are sufficient to explain how they are acquired; especially the Law of Inseparable Association, together with that of _Obliviscence_--a very useful, discriminating phrase, which we first find employed in this volume--(p. 259 et passim). He defines Matter to be a _permanent possibility of Sensation_; he maintains that this is really all which (apart from philosophical theories) mankind in general mean by it; he shows that mere possibilities of sensation not only may, but must, according to the known Laws of Association, come to present 'to our artificialized Consciousness' a character of objectivity--(pp. 198, 199). The correlative subject, though present in fact and indispensable, is eliminated out of conscious notice, according to the Law of Obliviscence.  These chapters will well repay the most careful perusal. We can only find room for one passage (pp. 214, 215):--       'Throughout the whole of our sensitive life, except its      first beginnings, we unquestionably refer our sensations to      a _me_ and _not-me_. As soon as I have formed, on the one      hand, the notion of Permanent Possibilities of Sensation,      and on the other, of that continued series of feelings which      I call my life--both these notions are, by an irresistible      association, recalled by every sensation I have. They      represent two things, with both of which the sensation of      the moment, be it what it may, stands in relation; and I      cannot be conscious of the sensation without being conscious      of it as related to these two things. They have accordingly      received relative names, expressive of the double relation      in question. The thread of consciousness which I apprehend      the relation as a part of, is called the _Subject_; the      group of Permanent Possibilities of Sensation to which I      refer it, and which is partially realized and actualized in      it, is called the _Object_ of the sensation. The sensation      itself ought to have a correlative name, or rather ought to      have two such names--one denoting the sensation as opposed      to its Subject, the other denoting it as opposed to its      Object; but it is a remarkable fact that this necessity has      not been felt, and that the need of a correlative name to      every relative one has been considered to be satisfied by      the terms Object and Subject themselves. It is true that      these two are related"]]]
