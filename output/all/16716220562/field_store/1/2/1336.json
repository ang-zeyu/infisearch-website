Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”  “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!”  “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said, “Let go!”  The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!”  “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.”  “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.  “Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”  “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”  A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.  “Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”  Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?”  “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”  “Then did you see him, Edmond?”  “Who?”  “The marshal.”  “Yes.”  Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—  “And how is the emperor?”  “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”  “You saw the emperor, then?”  “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”  “And you spoke to him?”  “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.  “And what did he say to you?”  “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”  “_Pardieu!_ and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.”  0027m    “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and said,—  “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo?”  “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”  “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.”  “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much. It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”  “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?”  “To me?—no—was there one?”  “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.”  “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”  “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”  “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”  Danglars turned very red.  “I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”  “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.”  Danglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been mistaken.”  At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.  “Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.  “Yes, sir.”  “You have not been long detained.”  “No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.”  “Then you have nothing more to do here?”  “No—everything is all right now.”  “Then you can come and dine with me?”  “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me.”  0029m    “Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.”  “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?”  “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”  “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”  “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.”  Dantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.”  “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.”  “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”  “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”  Dantès blushed.  “Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”  “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.”  “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.  “Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.  “Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”  “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”  “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”  “Say I have a poor father, sir.”  “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”  “Then I have your leave, sir?”  “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”  “Nothing.”  “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”  “He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.”  “To get married?”  “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”  “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the _Pharaon_,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.”  “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the _Pharaon_?”  “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—_Chi ha compagno ha padrone_—‘He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.”  “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercédès.”  “That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the deserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.”  “Shall I row you ashore?”  “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”  “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”  “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be glad to see Danglars remain?”  “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.”  “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you are.”  “Then I have leave?”  “Go, I tell you.”  “May I have the use of your skiff?”  “Certainly.”  “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”  “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”  The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184"],["title","The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated (#2)"],["body","the stern sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai d’Orléans.  The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantès.     Chapter 2. Father and Son  We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who, after having traversed La Canebière, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small house, on the left of the Allées de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room.  This room was occupied by Dantès’ father. The news of the arrival of the _Pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window. Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”  The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell into his arms, pale and trembling.  “What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?” inquired the young man, much alarmed.  “No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you; and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were going to die.”  “Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ’Tis I—really I! They say joy never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and we are going to be happy.”  “Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the old man; “but how shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.”  “God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”  “Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”  “Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?”  “’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the old man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.  “Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine, father, will revive you. Where do you keep your wine?”  “No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,” said the old man.  “Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or three cupboards.  “It is no use,” said the old man, “there is no wine.”  “What, no wine?” said Dantès, turning pale, and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. “What, no wine? Have you wanted money, father?”  “I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.  “Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his brow,—“yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.”  “Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see, lest he might do you an injury——”  “Well?”  “Why, I paid him.”  “But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Caderousse.”  “Yes,” stammered the old man.  “And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”  The old man nodded.  “So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,” muttered Edmond.  “You know how little I require,” said the old man.  “Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his father.  “What are you doing?”  “You have wounded me to the heart.”  “Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man; “and now it’s all over—everything is all right again.”  0035m    “Yes, here I am,” said the young man, “with a promising future and a little money. Here, father, here!” he said, “take this—take it, and send for something immediately.” And he emptied his pockets on the table, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six five-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dantès brightened.  “Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.  “To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and tomorrow we shall have more.”  “Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return, in order to be able to purchase them.”  “Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I will not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall have tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.”  “’Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return.”  “Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,” murmured Edmond. “But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time, so he’s welcome.”  As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.  “What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.  “Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility.  “Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès made a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no! I lent you money, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are quits.”  “We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”  “What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.  “‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’  “‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’  “‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And so I came,” added Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.”  0037m    “Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”  “Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the table.  The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”  “No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my living is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never has too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it.”  “It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.  “No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I hear,—you insinuating dog, you!”  “M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.  “Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”  “What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he invite you to dine?”  “Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.  “And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.  “That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the young man. “I was most anxious to see you.”  “But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse. “And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.”  “But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”  “Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s patrons.”  “I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès."]]]
