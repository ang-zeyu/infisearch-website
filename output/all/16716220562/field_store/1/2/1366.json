No bullet sped through the thickets, where the defenders lay, and Willet cried:  \"Tayoga! Tayoga and help! Ah, here they come!  The Mohawks!\"  Tayoga, panting from exertion, sprang into the bushes among them, and he was followed by a tall figure in war paint, lofty plumes waving from his war bonnet. Behind him came many warriors, and others were already on the flanks, spreading out like a fan, filing rapidly and shouting the war whoop. Robert recognized at once the great figure that stood before them. It was Daganoweda, the young Mohawk chief of his earlier acquaintance, whom he had met both on the war path and at the great council of the fifty sachems in the vale of Onondaga. Had his been the right to choose the man who was to come to their aid, the Mohawk would have been his first choice. Robert knew his intense hatred of the French and their red allies, and he also knew his fierce courage and great ability in battle.  The soldiers looked in some alarm at the painted host that had sprung among them, but Willet and Robert assured them insistently that these were friends, and the sound of the battle they were already waging on the flank with St. Luc's force, was proof enough.  \"Captain Colden,\" said Robert, not forgetful that an Indian likes the courtesies of life, and can take his compliments thick, \"this is the great young Mohawk Chief, Daganoweda, which in our language means 'The Inexhaustible' and such he is, inexhaustible in resource and courage in battle, and in loyalty to his friends.\"  Daganoweda smiled and extended his hand in the white man's fashion. Young Colden had the tact to shake it heartily at once and to say in English, which the young Mohawk chief understood perfectly:  \"Daganoweda, whatever praise of you Mr. Lennox has given it's not half enough. I confess now although I would not have admitted it before, that if you had not come we should probably have been lost.\"  He had made a friend for life, and then, without further words the two turned to the battle. But Robert remained for a minute beside Tayoga, whose chest was still heaving with his great exertions.  \"Where did you find them?\" he asked.  \"Many miles to the west, Lennox. After I descended the cliff I was pursued by Huron skirmishers, and I had to shake them off. Then I ran at full speed toward the point where the smoke had risen, knowing that the need was great, and I overtook Daganoweda and the Mohawks. Their first smoke was but that from a camp-fire, as being in strong force they did not care who saw them, but the last, just before the sunset, was sent up as a signal by two warriors whom we left behind for the purpose. We thought you might take it to mean that help was coming.\"  \"And so we did. How many warriors has Daganoweda?\"  \"Fifty, and that is enough. Already they push the Frenchman and his force before them. Come, we must join them, Dagaeoga. The breath has come back into my body and I am a strong man again!\"  The two now quickly took their places in the battle in the night and the forest, the position of the two forces being reversed. The soldiers and the Mohawks were pushing the combat at every point, and the agile warriors extending themselves on the flanks had already driven in St. Luc's skirmishers. Black Rifle, uttering fierce shouts, was leading a strong attack in the center. The firing was now rapid and much heavier than it had been at any time before. Flashes of flame appeared everywhere in the thicket. Above the crackle of rifles and muskets swelled the long thrilling war cry of the Mohawks, and back in fierce defiance came the yells of the Hurons and Abenakis.  Willet joined Robert and the two, with Tayoga, saw that the soldiers fought well under cover. The young Philadelphians, in the excitement of battle and of a sudden and triumphant reversal of fortune, were likely to expose themselves rashly, and the advice of the forest veterans was timely. Captain Colden saw that it was taken, although two more of his men were slain as they advanced and several were wounded. But the issue was no longer doubtful. The weight that the Mohawks had suddenly thrown into the battle was too great. The force of St. Luc was steadily driven northward, and Daganoweda's alert skirmishers on the flanks kept it compressed together.  Robert knew how bitter the defeat would be to St. Luc, but the knowledge did not keep his exultation from mounting to a high pitch. St. Luc might strive with all his might to keep his men in the battle, but the Frenchmen could not be numerous, and it was the custom of Indians, once a combat seemed lost, to melt away like a mist. They believed thoroughly that it was best to run away and fight another day, and there was no disgrace in escaping from a stricken field.  \"They run! They run! And the Frenchmen must run with them!\" exclaimed Black Rifle. As he spoke, a bullet grazed his side and struck a soldier behind him, but the force pressed on with the ardor fed by victory. Willet did not try any longer to restrain them, although he understood full well the danger of a battle in the dark. But he knew that Daganoweda and his Mohawks, experienced in every forest wile, would guard them against surprise, and he deemed it best now that they should strike with all their might.  Robert seldom saw any of the warriors before him, and he did not once catch a glimpse of a Frenchman. Whenever his rifle was loaded he fired at a flitting form, never knowing whether or not his bullet struck true, and glad of his ignorance. His sensitive and imaginative mind became greatly excited. The flashes of flame in the thickets were multiplied a hundred fold, a thousand little pulses beat heavily in his temples, and the shouts of the savages seemed to fill the forest. But he pressed on, conscious that the enemy was disappearing before them.  In his eagerness he passed ahead of Willet and Tayoga and came very near to St. Luc's retreating line. His foot became entangled in trailing vines and he fell, but he was up in an instant, and he fired at a shadowy figure not more than twenty feet in advance. In his haste he missed, and the figure, turning, raised a rifle. There was a fair moonlight and Robert saw the muzzle of the weapon bearing directly upon him, and he knew too that the rifle was held by firm hands. His vivid and sensitive imagination at once leaped into intense life. His own weapon was empty and his last moment had come. He saw the strong brown hands holding the rifle, and then his gaze passed on to the face of St. Luc. He saw the blue eyes of the Frenchman, as they looked down the sights, open wide in a kind of horror. Then he abruptly dropped the muzzle, waved one hand to Robert, and vanished in the thickets and the darkness.  The battle was over. There were a few dying shots, scattered beads of flame, an occasional shout of triumph from the Mohawks, a defiant yell or two in reply from the Hurons and the Abenakis, and then the trail of the combat swept out of the sight and hearing of Robert, who stood dazed and yet with a heart full of gratitude. St. Luc had held his life upon the pressure of a trigger, and the trigger would have been pulled had he not seen before it was too late who stood before the muzzle of his rifle. The moonlight was enough for Robert to see that look of horror in his eyes when he recognized the target. And then the weapon had been turned away and he had gone like a flash! Why? For what reason had St. Luc spared him in the heat and fury of a desperate and losing battle? It must have been a powerful motive for a man to stay his bullet at such a time!  \"Wake up, lad! Wake up! The battle has been won!\"  Willet's heavy but friendly hand fell upon his shoulder, and Robert came out of his daze. He decided at once that he would say nothing about the meeting with St. Luc, and merely remarked in a cryptic manner:  \"I was stunned for a moment by a bullet that did not hit me. Yes, we've won, Dave, thanks to the Mohawks.\"  \"Thanks to Daganoweda and his brave Mohawks, and to Tayoga, and to the gallant Captain Colden and his gallant men. All of us together have made the triumph possible. I understand that the bodies of only two Frenchmen have been found and that neither was that of St. Luc. Well, I'm glad. That Frenchman will do us great damage in this war, but he's an honorable foe, and a man of heart, and I like him.\"  A man of heart! Yes, truly! None knew it better than Robert, but again he kept his own counsel. He too was glad that his had not been one of the two French bodies found, but there was still danger from the pursuing Mohawks, who would hang on tenaciously, and he felt a sudden thrill of alarm. But it passed, as he remembered that the chevalier was a woodsman of experience and surpassing skill.  Tayoga came back to them somewhat blown. He had followed the fleeing French and Indian force two or three miles. But there was a limit even to his nerves and sinews of wrought steel. He had already run thirty miles before joining in the combat, and now it was time to rest.  \"Come, Tayoga,\" said the hunter, \"we'll go back to the ground our lads have defended so well, and eat, drink and sleep. The Mohawks will attend to all the work that's left, which isn't much. We've earned our repose.\"  Captain Colden, slightly wounded in the arm, appeared and Willet gave him the high compliments that he and his soldiers deserved. He told him it was seldom that men unused to the woods bore themselves so well in an Indian fight, but the young captain modestly disclaimed the chief merit, replying that he and his detachment would surely have been lost, had it not been for Willet and his comrades.  Then they went back to the ground near the cliff, where they had made their great fight, and Willet although the night was warm, wisely had a large fire built.

H. WOODS.     PREFACE  Among the fifty-eight regiments of Zouaves and the seven regiments of Lancers enlisted in the service of the United States between 1861 and 1865 it will be useless for the reader to look for any record of the 3d Zouaves or of the 8th Lancers.  The red breeches and red fezzes of the Zouaves clothed many a dead man on Southern battle-fields; the scarlet swallow-tailed pennon of the Lancers fluttered from many a lance-tip beyond the Potomac; the histories of these sixty-five regiments are known.  But no history of the 3d Zouaves or of the 8th Lancers has ever been written save in this narrative; and historians and veterans would seek in vain for any records of these two regiments--regiments which might have been, but never were.

Light from great crystal chandeliers dazzled him for a moment; the butler again confronted him but hesitated under the wicked glare from his eyes.  Then through the brilliant vista, the young fellow caught a glimpse of a dining-room, a table where silver and crystal glimmered, and a great gray man just lowering a glass of wine from his lips to gaze at him with quiet curiosity.  The next moment he traversed the carpeted interval between them and halted at the table's damask edge, gazing intently across at the solitary diner, who sat leaning back in an arm-chair, heavy right hand still resting on the stem of a claret glass, a cigar suspended between the fingers of his left hand.  \"Are you Colonel Arran?\"  \"I am,\" replied the man at the table coolly.  \"Who the devil are you?\"  \"By God,\" replied the other with an insolent laugh, \"that's what I came here to find out!\"   The man at the table laid both hands on the edge of the cloth and partly rose from his chair, then fell back solidly, in silence, but his intent gaze never left the other's bloodless face.  \"Send away your servants, Colonel Arran!\" said the young man in a voice now labouring under restraint.  \"We'll settle this matter now.\"  The other made as though to speak twice; then, with an effort, he motioned to the butler.  What he meant by the gesture perhaps he himself scarcely realised at the moment.  The butler instantly signalled to Pim, the servant behind Colonel Arran's chair, and started forward with a furtive glance at his master; and the young man turned disdainfully to confront him.  \"Will you retire peaceably, sir?\"  \"No, but you will retire permanently if you touch me.  Be very careful.\"  Colonel Arran leaned forward, hands still gripping the table's edge:  \"Larraway!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"You may go.\"  The small gray eyes in the pock-pitted face stole toward young Berkley, then were cautiously lowered.  \"Very well, sir,\" he said.  \"Close the drawing-room doors.  No--this way.  Go out through the pantry.  And take Pim with you.\"  \"Very well, sir.\"  \"And, Larraway!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"When I want you I'll ring.  Until then I don't want anybody or anything.  Is that understood?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"That is all.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  The great mahogany folding doors slid smoothly together, closing out the brilliant drawing-room; the door of the butler's pantry clicked.  Colonel Arran slowly wheeled in his place and surveyed his unbidden guest:  \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"continue.\"  \"I haven't yet begun.\"  \"You are mistaken, Berkley; you have made a very significant beginning.  I was told that you are this kind of a young man.\"  \"I _am_ this kind of a young man.  What else have you been told?\"  Colonel Arran inspected him through partly closed and heavy eyes; \"I am further informed,\" he said, that at twenty-four you have already managed to attain bankruptcy.\"  \"Perfectly correct.  What other items have you collected concerning me?\"  \"You can retrace your own peregrinations if you care to.  I believe they follow a vicious circle bisecting the semi-fashionable world, and the--other.  Shall we say that the expression, unenviable notoriety, summarises the reputation you have acquired?\"  \"Exactly,\" he said; \"both kinds of vice, Colonel Arran--respectable and disreputable.\"  \"Oh!  And am I correct in concluding that, at this hour, you stand there a financially ruined man--at twenty-four years of age----\"  \"I do stand here; but I'm going to sit down.\"  He did so, dropped both elbows on the cloth, and balancing his chin on the knuckles of his clasped hands, examined the older man with insolent, unchanging gaze.  \"Go on,\" he said coolly, \"what else do you conclude me to be?\"  \"What else is there to say to you, Berkley?  You have evidently seen my attorneys.\"  \"I have; the fat shyster and the bow-legged one.\" He reached over, poured himself a glass of brandy from a decanter, then, with an unpleasant laugh, set it aside untasted.  \"I beg your pardon.  I've had a hard day of it.  I'm not myself,\" he said with an insolent shrug of excuse.  \"At eleven o'clock this morning Illinois Central had fallen three more points, and I had no further interest in the market.  Then one of your brokers--\" He leaned farther forward on the table and stared brightly at the older man, showing an edge of even teeth, under the receding upper lip:  \"How long have your people been watching me?\"  \"Long enough to give me what information I required.\"  \"Then you really _have_ had me watched?\"  \"I have chosen to keep in touch with your--career, Berkley.\"  Berkley's upper lip again twitched unpleasantly; but, when at length he spoke, he spoke more calmly than before and his mobile features were in pallid repose.  \"One of your brokers--Cone--stopped me.  I was too confused to understand what he wanted of me.  I went with him to your attorneys--\"  Like lightning the snarl twitched his mouth again; he made as though to rise, and controlled himself in the act.  \"Where are the originals of those letters?\" he managed to say at last.  \"In this house.\"  \"Am I to have them?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"So do I,\" said the young man with a ghastly smile.  \"I'm quite sure of it.\"  Colonel Arran regarded him in surprise.  \"There is no occasion for violence in this house, Berkley.\"  \"Where are the letters?\"  \"Have you any doubts concerning what my attorneys have told you? The originals are at your immediate disposal if you wish.\"  Then Berkley struck the table fiercely, and stood up, as claret splashed and trembling crystal rang.  \"That's all I want of _you_!\" he said.  \"Do you understand what you've done?  You've killed the last shred of self-respect in me! Do you think I'd take anything at _your_ hands?  I never cared for anybody in the world except my mother.  If what your lawyers tell me is true--\"  His voice choked; he stood swaying a moment, face covered by his hands,  \"Berkley!\"  The young man's hands fell; he faced the other, who had risen to his heavy six-foot height, confronting him across the table.  \"Berkley, whatever claim you have on me--and I'm ignoring the chance that you have none----\"  \"By God, I tell you I have none!  I want none!  What you have done to her you have done to me!  What you and your conscience and your cruelty and your attorneys did to her twenty-four years ago, you have done this day to me!  As surely as you outlawed her, so have you outlawed me to-day.  That is what I now am, an outlaw!\"  \"It was insulted civilisation that punished, not I, Berkley----\"  \"It was you! You took your shrinking pound of flesh.  I know your sort.  Hell is full of them singing psalms!\"  Colonel Arran sat silently stern a moment.  Then the congested muscles, habituated to control, relaxed again.  He said, under perfect self-command:  \""]]]
