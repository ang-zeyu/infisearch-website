It was just dawn when old Anazeh ran the launch into a cove between high rocks.  Ahmed let out a shriek of anguish at the violence done the hull.  They pitched the sheep overboard to wade ashore without remembering to untie its legs;  it was almost drowned before it occurred to any one to rescue it. Perhaps it was dead.  I don't know.  Anyhow, one fellow prayed in a hurry while his companion cut the sheep's throat to make it lawful meat.  \"God is good,\" old Anazeh remarked to me, \"and blessed be His Prophet, who forbade us faithful, even though we hunger, to defile ourselves with the flesh of creatures whose blood did not flow from the knife of the slayer.\"  After that they all prayed, going first into the oily-feeling, asphaltic water for the ceremonial washing.  They were quite particular about it.  Then they spread prayer-mats, facing Mecca. Every single cut-throat had brought along his prayer-mat, and had treasured it as carefully as his rifle.  Ahmed and I sat on a rock and watched them.  Ahmed pretended he wanted to pray, too.  To impress me, he said he was a very devout Christian and that nothing should prevent the practice of his religion.  But he was very quick to take my advice not to start anything that might bring on a breach of the peace.  Old Anazeh's short preliminary sermon to his followers, about the need of always keeping God in mind, was not addressed to us.  Prayers finished, they proceeded to cut up and cook the sheep. Ahmed and I subdued the voice of conscience without noticeable effort and ate our share of the stolen goods.  Ahmed said that, seeing how little was left for him when the rest had all been served, he sinned only in small degree, but that my share, as an honoured guest, was huge, and the sin proportionate.  So I gave him some of my meat, and he ate it, and we were equally sinful-- one more bond cementing an \"eternal friendship!\"  We had hardly finished eating when an Arab on a gray horse came riding furiously down a ravine that looked like a dry water- course.  He was brought up all-standing fifty yards away.  Every man in the party leveled a rifle at him.  Anazeh beckoned me to come and get behind him for protection.  He was very angry when I refused.  He cursed the language and religion of whatever fool had taught me manners in a land where pigs are lawful food. However, after they had all had a good look at the horseman they let him draw near, and there followed a noisy conference, the man on the horse calling on Allah repeatedly with emphasis, and Anazeh and his followers all doing the same thing, but from an opposing viewpoint.  I persuaded Ahmed to go up close and listen.  \"The man is from El-Kerak,\" he said presently, while they all still fought with words, using tremendous oaths by way of artillery.  \"A council of the tribes has been summoned, to meet at El-Kerak, but each sheikh is only to take two men with him, because of the risk of fighting among themselves.  Anazeh says there can be no proper council without his being present, and that he will attend the council;  but as for taking only two men, he has pledged his word to escort you with twenty men to El- Kerak.  He swears that he will carry out that pledge, even should he have to fight the whole way there and back again!\"  Anazeh suddenly cut short the war of words.  His gesture suggested that of Joshua who made the sun stand still.  He tossed a curt order to one of his men, who went off at a run toward a village, whose morning smoke rose blue over a spur of the range a mile away.  Then Anazeh sat down to await events, and took no more notice of the horseman's arguments.  That did not worry the horseman much.  He kept on arguing.  Every few minutes one of Anazeh's men would go to him and repeat some tid-bit, as if the old sheikh had not heard it;  but all he got for his pains was a gesture of contemptuous dismissal.  Ahmed kept growing more and more uncomfortable all the time.  He had attended to his boat, making it properly fast and covering the engine, under the eyes of four men who were at pains to see that he did not crank up and desert.  Now he was back beside me, trying to bolster up his own courage by making me afraid.  \"They have determined to take me along with them to prevent me from escaping,\" he complained.  \"That man on the horse is saying that if more men go with Anazeh than you and two others, there will certainly be fighting.  And Anazeh answers, he has pledged his word.  Can you not say something to persuade Anazeh?\"  I would rather have tried to persuade a tiger.  Short of knocking the old raider on the head and standing off his twenty ruffians, I could not imagine a way of turning him from his set purpose. And at that, I had not a weapon of any kind.  I was the goods, and the game old sportsman intended to deliver me, right side up, perhaps, but all in one piece and to the proper consignee.   \"I don't see anything to worry about,\" said I.  \"Wait till you hear the bullets!\" Ahmed answered.  Nevertheless, bullets or no bullets, I did not see what I could do about it. Again I remembered Grim's advice:  \"Do what the leader of the escort tells you.\"  I had begun to feel sorry for Ahmed in spite of his self-pity, but his fear wasn't contagious and his advice wasn't worth listening to.  \"Effendi, you are Anazeh's guest.  He must do as you demand, if you ask in the Name of the Most High.  Tell him, therefore, that you have an urgent business in El-Kudz.  Demand that he send you back, with me, in my boat!\"  \"You are not his guest.  He would simply shoot you and destroy the boat,\" I answered.  It was not more than half-an-hour before I saw horses coming in our direction from the village.  At sight of them the man on the gray horse lost heart.  With a final burst of eloquence, in which he spread his breast to heaven and shook both fists in witness that he was absolved and no blood-guilt could rest on his head, he rode away at top speed straight up the ravine down which he originally came.  The horses proved to be a very mixed lot--some good, some very bad, and some indifferent.  But again they treated me as honoured guest and provided me a mare with four sound legs and nothing much the matter except vice.  She came at me with open teeth when I tried to mount, but four men held her and I climbed aboard, somehow or other.  As a horseman, I am a pretty good sack of potatoes.  That was the worst saddle I ever sat in--and Anazeh's second- best!  The stirrups swung amidships, so to speak, and whenever you tried to rest your weight on them for a moment they described an arc toward the rear.  Moreover, you could not sit well back on the saddle to balance matters, because of the high cantle.  The result, whether you did with stirrups or without them, was torture, for anybody but an Arab, who has notions of comfort all his own.  They put Ahmed on a wall-eyed scrub that looked unfit to walk, but proved well able to gallop under his light weight.  One of Anazeh's men took my bag, with a nod to reassure me, and without a word we were off full-pelt, Anazeh leading with four stalwarts who looked almost as hard-bitten as himself, six men crowding me closely, and the remainder bringing up the rear.  That is the Arab way of doing things--rush and riot to begin with.  The steepness of the stony ravine we rode up soon reduced the horses to a walk, after which there was a good deal of attention to rifle-bolts, and a settling down to the more serious aspects of the adventure.  The escort began to look sullenly ferocious, as only Arabs can.  There was a time, during the Turkish regime before the War, when Cook's Agency took tourists in parties to El-Kerak, and all the protection necessary was a handful of Turkish soldiers, whose thief employment on the trip was to gather fuel and pitch tents. Some one paid the Arabs to let tourists alone, and they normally did.  But the War changed all that.  A post-Armistice stranger in 1920, with leather boots, was fair quarry for whoever had rifle or knife.  We passed by a village or two, tucked into folds in the hills and polluting the blue sky with a smell of ageing dung, but nothing seemed disposed to happen.  A few men stood behind stone walls and stared at us sullenly.  The women looked up from their grindstones at the doors, covered their faces for convention's sake, and uncovered them again at once for curiosity.  There was nothing you could call a road between the villages, only a rocky cattle-track that seemed to take the longest possible way between two points;  and nobody seemed to own it, or to be there to challenge our right of way.  But suddenly, after we had passed the third village and were walking the horses up a shoulder of a steep hill-top, three shots cracked out from in front of us to left and right.  Nobody fell, but if ever there was instantaneous response it happened then. Anazeh and his four galloped forward up-hill, firing as they rode for the cover of a breast-high ridge.  One man on the off-side tipped me out of the saddle, so suddenly that I had no chance to prevent him;  another caught me, and two others flung me into a hole behind a stone.  I heard the rear-guard scatter and run. Two men pitched Ahmed down on top of me, for he was valuable, seeing he could run an engine;  and thirty seconds later I peered out around the rock to get a glimpse of what was happening.  There was not a man in sight.  I could see some of the horses standing under cover.  The firing was so rapid that it sounded almost like machine-gun practice.  A hairy arm reached out and pushed my head back, and after that, whenever I made the least movement, a man who was sniping from behind the sheltering rock swore furiously, and threatened to brain me with his butt-end. Beyond all doubt they regarded me as perishable freight;  so I hardly saw any of the fighting.  Judging by the sound, I should say they fought their way up-hill in skirmish order, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],["title","The Fern Lover's Companion (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders      [Illustration: A Fern Lover]  The Fern Lover's Companion   A Guide for the Northeastern States and Canada  BY  GEORGE HENRY TILTON, A.M.    \"This world's no blot for us   Nor blank; it means intensely and it means good   To find its meaning is my meat and drink.\"  [Illustration]     DEDICATION   To Alice D.

Beholding them in their native haunts, adorning the rugged cliffs, gracefully fringing the water-courses, or waving their stately fronds on the borders of woodlands, he feels their call to a closer acquaintance. Happy would he be to receive instruction from a living teacher: His next preference would be the companionship of a good fern book. Such a help we aim to give him in this manual. If he will con it diligently, consulting its glossary for the meaning of terms while he quickens his powers of observation by studying real specimens, he may hope to learn the names and chief qualities of our most common ferns in a single season.  Our most productive period in fern literature was between 1878, when Williamson published his \"Ferns of Kentucky,\" and 1905, when Clute issued, \"Our Ferns in Their Haunts.\" Between these flourished D.C. Eaton, Davenport, Waters, Dodge, Parsons, Eastman, Underwood, A.A. Eaton, Slosson, and others. All their works are now out of print except Clute's just mentioned and Mrs. Parsons' \"How to Know the Ferns.\" Both of these are valuable handbooks and amply illustrated. Clute's is larger, more scholarly, and more inclusive of rare species, with an illustrated key to the genera; while Mrs. Parsons' is more simple and popular, with a naive charm that creates for it a constant demand.  We trust there is room also for this unpretentious, but progressive, handbook, designed to stimulate interest in the ferns and to aid the average student in learning their names and meaning. Its geographical limits include the northeastern states and Canada. Its nomenclature follows in the main the seventh edition of Gray's Manual, while the emendations set forth in _Rhodora_, of October, 1919, and also a few terms of later adoption are embodied, either as synonyms or substitutes for the more familiar Latin names of the Manual, and are indicated by a different type. In every case the student has before him both the older and the more recent terms from which to choose. However, since the book is written primarily for lovers of Nature, many of whom are unfamiliar with scientific terms, the common English names are everywhere given prominence, and strange to say are less subject to change and controversy than the Latin. There is no doubt what species is meant when one speaks of the Christmas fern, the ostrich fern, the long beech fern, the interrupted fern, etc. The use of the common names will lead to the knowledge and enjoyment of the scientific terms.  A friend unfamiliar with Latin has asked for pointers to aid in pronouncing the scientific names of ferns. Following Gray, Wood, and others we have marked each accented syllable with either the grave (`) or acute (´) accent, the former showing that the vowel over which it stands has its long sound, while the latter indicates the short or modified sound."]]]
