He had gone perhaps fifty feet when the darkness was stabbed by the blaze of Slevin's gun. Three times the weapon spoke, at little more than arm's-length, and Black Jack spun on his heels, then rocked forward limply. It was a long time before the sound of his loud, slow breathing ceased. Not until then did Denny Slevin move. With a rattle in his throat the foreman crept out from hiding and went down the mountain-side upon his hands and knees.  It occasioned considerable speculation at the Aurora Borealis when neither the superintendent nor the foreman appeared for breakfast. Later, a telephone message to Doctor Slayforth having elicited the startling intelligence that neither man had been seen in town during the night, there came a flicker of excitement. This excitement blazed to white heat when Slayforth rode up on a muddy horse, accompanied by the town marshal and the chief of police. Followed more telephoning and some cross-examination. But the men were gone. They had disappeared.  It was a mystery baffling any attempt at explanation, for there were no ships in the roadstead, and hence it was impossible for the pair to have taken French leave. While a search party was being organized there came word that the missing saddle-horses had been found on the slope of Anvil Mountain, and by the time Slayforth's party had reached the ground more news awaited them. Up near the head of the draw some one had discovered the body of Denny Slevin. There was a rush thither, and thence on up the trail Slevin had left, to the scene of the twilight duel, to Black Jack Berg and the cache in the slide.  The story told itself down to the last detail; it was the story of a thieves' quarrel and a double killing. Doctor Slayforth fell upon his bag of gold as a mother falls upon her babe; he voiced loud, hysterical condemnation of the deed; he wept tears of mingled indignation and thanksgiving; he gabbled scriptural quotations about the wages of sin. Then, remembering that the wages of his men were going on, he sent them back to their work, and determined to dock half their morning's pay.  The story of the tragedy was still the sensation of Nome when, a fortnight later, Laughing Bill Hyde showed up in town with the cheerful announcement that he had been fired. Ponatah was at the cabin when he arrived, and she did not try to conceal her joy at seeing him again.  \"I've been so unhappy,\" she told him. \"You've never been out of my thoughts, Billy.\"  \"Ain't you got nothing better to think about than me?\" he asked, with a smile. \"Well, the psalm-shouter let me out--jerked the piller-slip from under me, you might say--and turned me adrift. He's got a high-chested, low-browed Swede in my place. It takes a guy with hair down to his eyebrows to be a buck chamber-maid.\"  \"The old rascal!\" Ponatah's face darkened with anger. \"No wonder those men robbed him. I wish they had taken all his gold, and escaped.\"  \"You're pretty sore on his heavenly nibs, ain't you?\" Ponatah clenched her hands and her eyes blazed. \"Well, you got this consolation, the Aurora ain't as rich as it was.\"  \"It would have been rich enough for us.\"  \"Us?\"  \"Yes. You'd marry me if I were rich, wouldn't you?\"  \"No, I wouldn't,\" Bill declared, firmly. \"What's the use to kid you?\"  \"Why wouldn't you? Are you ashamed of me?\"  Bill protested, \"Say, what is this you're giving me, the third degree?\"  \"If I were as rich as--well, as Reindeer Mary, wouldn't you marry me?\" Ponatah gazed at the unworthy object of her affections with a yearning that was embarrassing, and Laughing Bill was forced to spar for wind.  \"Ain't you the bold Mary Ann--makin' cracks like that?\" he chided. \"I'm ashamed of you, honest. I've passed up plenty of frills in my time, and we're all better off for it. My appetite for marriage ain't no keener than it used to be, so you forget it. Little Doc, he's the marrying kind.\"  \"Oh yes. He tells me a great deal about his Alice. He's very much discouraged. If--if I had the Aurora I wouldn't forget him; I'd give him half.\"  \"Would you, now? Well, he's the one stiffneck that wouldn't take it. He's funny that way--seems to think money 'll bite him, or something. I don't know how these pullanthrofists get along, with proud people always spurning their gifts. He's got my nan. You take my tip, Kid, and cling to your coin. Salt it down for winter. That's what I'm doing with mine.\"  \"Are you?\" Ponatah was not amused, she was gravely interested. \"I thought you were broke, Billy.\"  \"Where'd you get that at?\" he demanded. \"I've always got a pinch of change, I have. I'm lucky that way. Now then, you run along and don't never try to feint me into a clinch. It don't go.\"  Laughing Bill enjoyed a good rest in the days that followed. He rested hard for several weeks, and when he rested he lifted his hand to absolutely nothing. He was an expert idler, and with him indolence was but a form of suspended animation. In spite of himself, however, he was troubled by a problem; he was completely baffled by it, in fact, until, without warning and without conscious effort, the solution presented itself. Bill startled his cabin mate one day by the announcement that he intended to go prospecting.  \"Nonsense!\" said Thomas, when the first shock of surprise had passed. \"This country has been run over, and every inch is staked.\"  \"I bet I'll horn in somewhere. All I want is one claim where I got room to sling myself.\"  \"If that's all you want I'll give you a claim. It has twenty acres. Is that room enough?\"  \"Plenty. Where is it?\"  \"It's on Eclipse Creek, I believe. A patient gave it to me for a bill.\"  \"He won't call for a new deal if I strike it rich?\"  \"No. I paid his fare out of the country. But why waste your valuable time? Your time _is_ valuable, I presume?\"  \"Sure! I ain't got much left. You don't believe in hunches, do you? Well, I do. I've seen 'em come out. Look at Denny Slevin, for instance! I heard him say he had a hunch something unpleasant was going to happen to him, and it did. We'll go fifty-fifty on this Eclipse Creek.\"  The doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"Suit yourself. Fresh air won't hurt you.\"  The first frosts of autumn had arrived before Laughing Bill returned to town with the announcement that he had struck a prospect. Doctor Thomas was at first incredulous, then amazed; finally, when the true significance of those tiny yellow grains came home to him, his enthusiasm burst all bounds. He was for at once closing his office and joining actively in his partner's work, but Bill would not hear to such a thing.  \"Stick to the pills and powders, Doc,\" he counseled. \"You know that game and I know this. It's my strike and I don't want no amachoors butting in. I got options on the whole creek--she's eclipsed for fair--'cause I don't like neighbors. You shut your trap till spring and sit tight, then we'll roll our packs, stomp on the fire, and call the dog. Old Home Week for us.\"  \"But, Billy, we can't work out that claim in one winter,\" protested the physician.  \"How d'you know we can't? Mebbe it's just a pocket.\"  \"We'll find other pockets. We have the whole creek--\"  \"Say, how much d'you need to satisfy you?\" Bill inquired, curiously.  \"I--don't know. A hundred thousand dollars, perhaps.\"  \"A hundred thousand! Whew! You got rich tastes! This ain't no bonanza.\"  \"But if it's any good at all it will net us that much, probably more.\"  Bill considered briefly, then he announced: \"All right, bo, I got your idea. When I hand you a hundred thousand iron men we quit--no questions, no regrets; Is that it? But you've hiked the limit on me; I dunno's I'll make good.\"  By the time snow flew the tent on Eclipse Creek had been replaced by a couple of warm shacks, provisions had been bought, and a crew hired. Work commenced immediately, and it continued throughout the winter with Bill in charge. The gravel was lean-looking stuff, but it seemed to satisfy the manager, and whenever Thomas came out from town he received encouraging reports from his partner. Hyde ceased playing solitaire long enough to pan samples in his tub of snow water. Now had the younger man been an experienced placer miner he might have noted with suspicion that whenever Bill panned he chewed tobacco--a new habit he had acquired--and not infrequently he spat into the tub of muddy water. But Thomas was not experienced in the wiles and artifices of mine-salters, and the residue of yellow particles left in the pan was proof positive that the claim was making good. It did strike him as strange, however, that when he selected a pan of dirt and washed it unassisted he found nothing. At such times Bill explained glibly enough that no pay dump carried steady values, and that an inexperienced sampler was apt to get \"skunked\" under the best of circumstances. Concentrates lay in streaks and pockets, he declared. Then to prove his assertions Bill would help his partner pan, and inasmuch as he wore long finger-nails, underneath which colors of gold could be easily concealed, it was not surprising that he succeeded in finding a prospect where the doctor had failed. For fear Thomas should still entertain some lingering doubts, Bill occasionally sent him down into the shaft alone, to sample the pay streak, but in each instance he took pains to go down beforehand with a shot-gun and some shells of his own loading and to shoot a few rounds into the face of the thawed ground.  The winter passed quickly enough, Bill's only concern arising from the fact that his strike had become common knowledge, and that men were clamoring to buy or to lease a part of the creek. It was a tiny creek, and he had it safely tied up under his options, therefore he was in a position to refuse every offer. By so doing he gained the reputation of being a cautious, cagey man and difficult to deal with.  Bill paid off his crew out of the first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11501"],["title","Laughing Bill Hyde and Other Stories (#8)"],["body"," cleanup, from the dust he had managed to dump into the sluices at night. Thereafter he sent the gold to town by Doctor Thomas, who came after it regularly. When he closed down the works, in June, he and his partner held bank deposit slips for a trifle over one hundred thousand dollars. Rumor placed their profits at much more.  Bill saw little of Ponatah after his return to Nome, for the girl avoided him, and when he did see her she assumed a peculiar reserve. Her year and a half of intimate association with cultured people had in reality worked an amazing improvement in her, and people no longer regarded her as an Indian, but referred to her now as \"that Russian governess,\" nevertheless she could retreat behind a baffling air of stolidity--almost of sullenness--when she chose, and that was precisely the mask she wore for Bill. In reality she was far from stolid and anything but sullen.  For his part he made no effort to break down the girl's guard; he continued to treat her with his customary free good nature.  Notwithstanding the liberal margin of profit on his winter's operations, Bill realized that he was still shy approximately half of the sum which Doctor Thomas had set as satisfactory, and when the latter began planning to resume work on a larger scale in the fall Mr. Hyde was stricken with panic. Fearing lest his own lack of enthusiasm in these plans and his indifference to all affairs even remotely concerning Eclipse Creek should awaken suspicion, he determined to sell out his own and his partner's interests in accordance with their original understanding. Without consulting Thomas he called upon Doctor Slayforth.  The pious mine-owner was glad to see him; his manner was not at all what it had been when Bill worked for him. His words of greeting fairly trickled prune juice and honey.  \"Say, Doc, I got a load on my chest! I'm a strayed lamb and you being a sort of shepherd I turns to you,\" Bill began.  \"I trust you have not come in vain.\" The ex-missionary beamed benignly. \"It has been my duty and my privilege to comfort the afflicted. What troubles you, William?\"  \"There's a school of sharks in this village, and I don't trust 'em. They're too slick for a feller like me,\"  \"It _is_ an ungodly place,\" the doctor agreed. \"I have felt the call to work here, but my duties prevent. Of course I labor in the Lord's vineyard as I pass through, but--I am weak.\"  \"Me, too, and getting weaker daily.\" Bill summoned a hollow cough. \"Listen to that hospital bark,' I gotta blow this place, Doc, or they'll button me up in a rosewood overcoat. I gotta sell Eclipse Creek and beat it.\" Again he coughed.  \"I am distressed. But why do you come here?\"  \"I aim to sell out to you.\"  \"What is your price, William?\"  \"A hundred and fifty thousand, cash.\"  Slayforth lifted protesting palms. \"My dear man--\"  \"That's cheaper'n good advice, and you know it. I took out 'most that much last winter with a scowegian gang of six. Here's the bank's O.K. But I ain't got use for a lot of money, Doc. I wouldn't know how to run a vineyard like you do. All I want is a nice little corner saloon or a cattle ranch.\"  \"It is a large sum of money you ask. There is always an element of uncertainty about placer mining.\" Doctor Slayforth failed to conceal the gleam of avarice in his eyes.  \"Doc, take it from me; there ain't a particle of uncertainty about Eclipse Creek,\" Bill earnestly assured his hearer. \"If I told you what's there you wouldn't believe me. But Thomas, he's got a gal and I got a cough. They both need attention, and he's the only guy that can give it. We're willing to hand you Eclipse Creek if you'll take it.\"  There was considerable conversation, and a visit to Eclipse Creek, but the doctor, it proved, was willing to take any good bargain, and a few days later the transfer was made. When the larger part of Slayforth's winter's clean-up had changed hands the two partners adjourned to Thomas's little office.  \"Well!\" The physician heaved a deep sigh of relief. \"It's all over, and--I feel as if I were dreaming.\"  \"The _Oregon_ sails to-morrow. It's time to stomp on the fire.\"  \"I--I wonder if we were wise to sell out at that price,\" the doctor mused, doubtfully.  \"You lay a bet on it, bo. Something tells me that soul-saver will go bust on Eclipse Creek. I got a hunch that way.\" Mr. Hyde's seamy face wrinkled into a broad grin.  \"Well, I've more faith in your hunches than I used to have. You've been a good friend, Bill, and a square one.\" The speaker choked, then wrung his partner's hand. \"I've cabled Alice to meet us. I want you to know her and--I want her to see that I cured you, after all.\"  \"I'd admire to meet her, but my taste has allus run more to brunettes,\" said Mr. Hyde. Then, since he abhorred emotional display, he continued, briskly: \"Now call the dog. I'm off to buy our duckets.\"  Laughing Bill purchased three tickets instead of two, then he went in search of Ponatah. It so chanced that he found her alone. Now neither he nor any other man had ever called upon her, therefore she was dumfounded at his coming.  \"Well, Kid,\" he announced, \"me 'n' the Doc have sold Eclipse Creek, and we bow out tomorrow on the big smoke.\"  Ponatah opened her lips, but no sound issued. She possessed a strong young body, but the strength, the life, seemed suddenly to go out of it, leaving her old and spiritless.  \"Got a kind word for us?\" the man inquired, with a twinkle.  \"I'm glad you struck it rich,\" she murmured, dully. \"You--you'll take care of yourself, Billy?\"  \"Who, me? I don't s'pose so. I don't know how to take care of nothing.\" There was a moment of silence. \"Like me?\" he asked.  Ponatah turned away blindly, but as she did so Laughing Bill put his hand gently upon her shoulder, saying:  \"Cheer up, Kid. You're going to join the troupe. I've come to get you.\"  There was amazement, incredulity, in the girl's face as she lifted it to his. \"What do you--mean?\" she quavered. \"Are you going to--marry me?\"  \"You guessed it!\" he laughed. \"I been aiming to put up that job on you for a long time, but I had a lot of deals on my hands. I was a sort of power-of-attorney for a coupla simps, and it kept me busy. If you think the two of us can do with three lungs, why, we'll grab a psalm-shouter and--\"  \"Billy! Billy!\" Ponatah clung to him fiercely, hungrily. \"Oh, Billy--I'll make you well. We'll go to Arizona, Colorado, Montana--where it is high and dry--\"  \"I been to them places,\" he told her, dubiously, \"and I 'most stopped breathing altogether.\"  \"New Mexico, then. You won't be ashamed of me there.\"  \"Say, Kid! I wouldn't be ashamed of a harelip and warts in New Mexico. But you got me wrong; I'm plumb proud of you, and just to prove it I aim to make you carry our bank-roll in your name. That's how she stands at the bank, and that's how she's goin' to stand. From time to time you can gimme a check for what you think I'm wuth. Now then, do with me as you will; grab your lid; we'll join hands and be soldered up.\"  Laughing Bill stared after the girl as she hurried away; musingly he said: \"The little Doc got in on no pair, for it was all her coin, of course. But she'd 'a' had to split, fifty-fifty, with a lawyer, so it ain't a bad deal all around.\"     THE NORTH WIND'S MALICE   It had snowed during the night, but toward morning it had grown cold; now the sled-runners complained and the load dragged heavily. Folsom, who had been heaving at the handle-bars all the way up the Dexter Creek hill, halted his dogs at the crest and dropped upon the sled, only too glad of a breathing spell. His forehead was wet with sweat; when it began to freeze in his eyebrows he removed his mittens and wiped away the drops, then watched them congeal upon his fingers. Yes, it was all of thirty below, and a bad morning to hit the trail, but--Folsom's face set itself--better thirty below in the open than the frigid atmosphere of an unhappy home.  Harkness, who had led the way up the hill, plodded onward for a time before discovering that his companion had paused; then, through the ring of hoar frost around his parka hood, he called back:  \"I'll hike down to the road-house and warm up.\"  Folsom made no answer, he did not even turn his head. Taciturnity was becoming a habit with him, and already he was beginning to dislike his new partner. For that matter he disliked everybody this morning.  Below him lay the level tundra, merging indistinguishably with the white anchor-ice of Behring Sea; beyond that a long black streak of open water, underscoring the sky as if to emphasize the significance of that empty horizon, a horizon which for many months would remain unsmudged by smoke. To Folsom it seemed that the distant stretch of dark water was like a prison wall, barring the outside world from him and the other fools who had elected to stay \"inside.\"  Fools? Yes; they were all fools!  Folsom was a \"sour-dough.\" He had seen the pranks that Alaskan winters play with men and women, he had watched the alteration in minds and morals made by the Arctic isolation, and he had considered himself proof against the malice that rides the north wind--the mischief that comes with the winter nights. He had dared to put faith in his perfect happiness, thinking himself different from other men and Lois superior to other wives, wherefore he now called himself a fool!  Sprawled beside the shore, five miles away, was Nome, its ugliness of corrugated iron, rough boards, and tar paper somewhat softened by the distance. From the jumble of roofs he picked out one and centered his attention upon it. It was his roof--or had been. He wondered, with a sudden flare of wrathful indignation, if Lois would remember that fact during his absence. But he banished this evil thought. Lois had pride, there was nothing common about her; he could not believe that she would affront the proprieties. It was to spare that very pride of hers, even more than his own, that he had undertaken this adventure to the Kobuk; and now, as"]]]
