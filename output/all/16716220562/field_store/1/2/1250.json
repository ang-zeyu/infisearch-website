Shall you have another nearer the road?\"  \"Next summer there will have to be planting of trees and shrubs and vines around the house but this year I shall attend to the one up here in the field.\"  \"Brrrr! It looks bleak enough now,\" shivered Ethel Blue.  \"Let's go up in those woods and see what's there.\"  \"Has Aunt Louise bought them?\"  \"No, but she wants to. They don't belong to the same man who owned this piece of land. They belong to the Clarks. She's going to see about it right off, because it looks so attractive and rocky and woodsy.\"  \"You'd have the brook, too.\"  \"I hope she'll be able to get it. Of course just this piece is awfully pretty, and this is the only place for a house, but the meadow with the brook and the rocks and the woods at the back would be too lovely for words. Why, you'd feel as if you had an estate.\"  The girls laughed at Dorothy's enthusiasm over the small number of acres that were included even in the combined lots of land, but they agreed with her that the additional land offered a variety that was worth working hard to obtain.  They made their way up the slope and among the jumble of rocks that looked as if giants had been tossing them about in sport. Small trees grew from between them as they lay heaped in disorder and taller growths stretched skyward from an occasional open space. The brook began in a spring that bubbled clear and cold, from under a slab of rock. Round about it all was covered with moss, still green, though frozen stiff by the snowstorm's chilly blasts. Shrivelled ferns bending over its mouth promised summer beauties.  \"What a lovely spot!\" cried Ethel Blue. \"This is where fairies and wood nymphs live when that drift melts. Don't you know this must be a great gathering place for birds? Can't you see them now dipping their beaks into the water and cocking their heads up at the sky afterwards!\" and she quoted:--      \"Dip, birds, dip       Where the ferns lean over,     And their crinkled edges drip,       Haunt and hover.\"  \"Here's the best place yet!\" called Dorothy, who had pushed on and was now out of sight.  \"Where are you?\"  \"Here. See if you can find me,\" came a muffled answer.  \"Where do you suppose she went to?\" asked Ethel Brown, as they all three straightened themselves, yet saw no sign of Dorothy.  \"I hope she hasn't fallen down a precipice and been killed!\" said Ethel Blue, whose imagination sometimes ran away with her.  \"More likely she has twisted her ankle,\" practical Ethel Brown.  \"She wouldn't sound as gay as that if anything had happened to her,\" Della reminded them.  The cries that kept reaching them were unquestionably cheerful but where they came from was a problem that they did not seem able to solve. It was only when Dorothy poked out her head from behind a rock almost in front of them that they saw the entrance of what looked like a real cave.  \"It's the best imitation of a cave I ever did see!\" the explorer exclaimed. \"These rocks have tumbled into just the right position to make the very best house! Come in.\"  Her guests were eager to accept her invitation. There was space enough for all of them and two or three more might easily be accommodated within, while a bit of smooth grass outside the entrance almost added another room, \"if you aren't particular about a roof,\" as Ethel Brown said.  \"Do you suppose Roger has never found this!\" wondered Dorothy. \"See, there's room enough for a fireplace with a chimney. You could cook here. You could sleep here. You could _live_ here!\"  The others laughed at her enthusiasm, but they themselves were just as enthusiastic. The possibilities of spending whole days here in the shade and cool of the trees and rocks and of imagining that they were in the highlands of Scotland left them almost gasping.  \"Don't you remember when Fitz-James first sees Ellen in the 'Lady of the Lake'?\" asked Ethel Blue.  \"He was separated from his men and found himself in a rocky glen overlooking a lake. The rocks were bigger than these but we can pretend they were just the same,\" and she recited a few lines from a poem whose story they all knew and loved.      \"But not a setting beam could glow     Within the dark ravines below,     Where twined the path in shadow hid,     Round many a rocky pyramid.\"  \"I remember; he looked at the view a long time and then he blew his horn again to see if he could make any of his men hear him, and Ellen came gliding around a point of land in a skiff. She thought it was her father calling her.\"  \"And the stranger went home to their lodge and fell in love with her--O, it's awfully romantic. I must read it again,\" and Dorothy gazed at the rocks around her as if she were really in Scotland.  \"Has anybody a knife?\" asked Della's clear voice, bringing them all sharply back to America and Rosemont. \"My aunt--the one who has the hanging flowerpots I was telling you about--isn't a bit well and I thought I'd make her a little fernery that she could look at as she lies in bed.\"  \"But the ferns are all dried up.\"  \"'Greenery' is a better name. Here's a scrap of partridge berry with a red berry still clinging to it, and here's a bit of moss as green as it was in summer, and here--yes, it's alive, it really is!\" and she held up in triumph a tiny fern that had been so sheltered under the edge of a boulder that it had kept fresh and happy.  There was nothing more to reward their search, for they all hunted with Della, but she was not discouraged.  \"I only want a handful of growing things,\" she explained. \"I put these in a finger bowl, and sprinkle a few seeds of grass or canary seed on the moss and dash some water on it from the tips of my fingers. Another finger bowl upside down makes the cover. The sick person can see what is going on inside right through the glass without having to raise her head.\"  \"How often do you water it?\"  \"Only once or twice a week, because the moisture collects on the upper glass of the little greenhouse and falls down again on the plants and keeps them, wet.\"  \"We'll keep our eyes open every time we come here,\" promised Dorothy. \"There's no reason why you couldn't add a little root of this or that any time you want to.\"  [Illustration: Partridge Berry]  \"I know Aunty will be delighted with it,\" cried Della, much pleased. \"She likes all plants, but especially things that are a little bit different. That's why she spends so much time selecting her wall vases--so that they shall be unlike other people's.\"  \"Fitz-James's woods,\" as they already called the bit of forest that Dorothy hoped to have possession of, extended back from the road and spread until it joined Grandfather Emerson's woods on one side and what was called by the Rosemonters \"the West Woods\" on the other. The girls walked home by a path that took them into Rosemont not far from the station where Della was to take the train.  \"Until you notice what there really is in the woods in winter you think there isn't anything worth looking at,\" said Ethel Blue, walking along with her eyes in the tree crowns.  \"The shapes of the different trees are as distinct now as they are in summer,\" declared Ethel Brown. \"You'd know that one was an oak, and the one next to it a beech, wouldn't you?\"  \"I don't know whether I would or not,\" confessed Dorothy honestly, \"but I can almost always tell a tree by its bark.\"  \"I can tell a chestnut by its bark nowadays,\" asserted Ethel Blue, \"because it hasn't any!\"  \"What on earth do you mean?\" inquired city-bred Della.  \"Something or other has killed all the chestnuts in this part of the world in the last two or three years. Don't you see all these dead trees standing with bare trunks?\"  \"Poor old things! Is it going to last?\"  \"It spread up the Hudson and east and west in New York and Massachusetts, and south into Pennsylvania.\"  \"Roger was telling Grandfather a few days ago that a farmer was telling him that he thought the trouble--the pest or the blight or whatever it was--had been stopped.\"  \"I remember now seeing a lot of dead trees somewhere when one of Father's parishioners took us motoring in the autumn. I didn't know the chestnut crop was threatened.\"  \"Chestnuts weren't any more expensive this year. They must have imported them from far-off states.\"  There were still pools of water in the wood path, left by the melting snow, and the grass that they touched seemed a trifle greener than that beside the narrow road. Once in a while a bit of vivid green betrayed a plant that had found shelter under an overhanging stone. The leaves were for the most part dry enough again to rustle under their feet. Evergreens stood out sharply dark against the leafless trees.  \"What are the trees that still have a few leaves left clinging to them?\" asked Della.  \"Oaks. Do you know why the leaves stay on?\"  \"Is it a story?\"  \"Yes, a pleasant story. Once the Great Evil Spirit threatened to destroy the whole world. The trees heard the threat and the oak tree begged him not to do anything so wicked. He insisted but at last he agreed not to do it until the last leaf had fallen in the autumn. All the trees meant to hold On to their leaves so as to ward off the awful disaster, but one after the other they let them go--all except the oak. The oak never yet has let fall every one of its leaves and so the Evil Spirit never has had a chance to put his threat into execution.\"  \"That's a lesson in success, isn't it? Stick to whatever it is you want to do and you're sure to succeed.\"  \"Watch me make my garden succeed,\" cried Dorothy. \"If 'sticking' will make it a success I'm a stick!\"     CHAPTER IV   GARDENING ON PAPER  When Saturday came and the United Service Club tramped over Dorothy's new domain, including the domain that she hoped to have but was not yet sure of, every member agreed that the prospect was one that gave satisfaction to the Club as well as the possibility of pleasure and comfort to Mrs. Smith and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11660"],["title","Ethel Morton's Enterprise (#5)"],["body","hy. The knoll they hailed as the exact spot where a house should go; the ridge behind it as precisely suited to the needs of a garden.  As to the region of the meadow and the brook and the rocks and the trees they all hoped most earnestly that Mrs. Smith would be able to buy it, for they foresaw that it would provide much amusement for all of them during the coming summer and many to follow.  Strangely enough Roger had never found the cave, and he looked on it with yearning.  \"Why in the world didn't I know of that three or four years ago!\" he exclaimed. \"I should have lived out here all summer!\"  \"That's what we'd like to do,\" replied the Ethels earnestly. \"We'll let you come whenever you want to.\"  Roger gave a sniff, but the girls knew from his longing gaze that he was quite as eager as they to fit it up for a day camp even if he was nearly eighteen and going to college next autumn.  When the exploring tour was over they gathered in their usual meeting place--Dorothy's attic--and discussed the gardens which had taken so firm a hold on the girls' imaginations.  \"There'll be a small garden in our back yard as usual,\" said Roger in a tone that admitted of no dispute.  \"And a small one in Dorothy's present back yard and a LARGE one on Miss Smith's farm,\" added Tom, who had confirmed with his own eyes the glowing tales that Della had brought home to him.  \"I suppose we may all have a chance at all of these institutions?\" demanded James.  \"Your mother may have something to say about your attentions to your own garden,\" suggested Helen pointedly.  \"I won't slight it, but I've really got to have a finger in this pie if all of you are going to work at it!\"  \"Well, you shall. Calm yourself,\" and Roger patted him with a soothing hand. \"You may do all the digging I promised the girls I'd do.\"  A howl of laughter at James's expense made the attic ring.  James appeared quite undisturbed.  \"I'm ready to do my share,\" he insisted placidly. \"Why don't we make plans of the gardens now?\"  \"Methodical old James always has a good idea,\" commended Tom. \"Is there any brown paper around these precincts, Dorothy?\"  \"Must it be brown?\"  \"Any color, but big sheets.\"  \"I see. There is plenty,\" and she spread it on the table where James had done so much pasting when they were making boxes in which to pack their presents for the war orphans.  \"Now, then, Roger, the first thing for us to do is to see--\"  \"With our mind's eye, Horatio?\"  \"--how these gardens are going to look. Take your pencil in hand and draw us a sketch of your backyard as it is now, old man.\"  \"That's easy,\" commented Roger. \"Here are the kitchen steps; and here is the drying green, and back of that is the vegetable garden and around it flower beds and more over here next the fence.\"  \"It's rather messy looking as it is,\" commented Ethel Brown. \"We never have changed it from the way the previous tenant laid it out.\"  \"The drying green isn't half large enough for the washing for our big family,\" added Helen appraisingly. \"Mary is always lamenting that she can hang out only a few lines-ful at a time.\"  \"Why don't you give her this space behind the green and limit your flower beds to the fence line?\" asked Tom, looking over Roger's shoulder as he drew in the present arrangement with some attention to the comparative sizes.  \"That would mean cutting out some of the present beds.\"  \"It would, but you'll have a share in Dorothy's new garden in case Mrs. Morton needs more flowers for the house; and the arrangement I suggest makes the yard look much more shipshape.\"  \"If we sod down these beds here what will Roger do for his sweetpeas? They ought to have the sun on both sides; the fence line wouldn't be the best place for them.\"  \"Sweetpeas ought to be planted on chicken wire supported by stakes and running from east to west,\" said Margaret wisely, \"but under the circumstances, I don't see why you couldn't fence in the vegetable garden with sweetpeas. That would give you two east and west lines of them and two north and south.\"  \"And there would be space for all the blossoms that Roger would want to pick on a summer's day,\" laughed Della.  \"I've always wanted to have a garden of all pink flowers,\" announced Dorothy. \"My room in the new house is going to be pink and I'd like to keep pink powers in it all the time.\"  \"I've always wanted to do that, too. Let's try one here,\" urged Ethel Brown, nodding earnestly at Ethel Blue.  \"I don't see why we couldn't have a pink bed and a blue bed and a yellow bed,\" returned Ethel Blue whose inner eye saw the plants already well grown and blossoming.  \"A wild flower bed is what I'd like,\" contributed Helen.  \"We mustn't forget to leave a space for Dicky,\" suggested Roger.  \"I want the garden I had latht year,\" insisted a decisive voice that preceded the tramp of determined feet over the attic stairs.  \"Where was it, son? I've forgotten.\"  \"In a corner of your vegetable garden. Don't you remember my raditheth were ripe before yourth were? Mother gave me a prithe for the firtht vegetableth out of the garden.\"  \"So she did. You beat me to it. Well, you may have the same corner again.\"  \"We ought to have some tall plants, hollyhocks or something like that, to cover the back fence,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"What do you say if we divide the border along the fence into four parts and have a wild garden and pink and yellow and blue beds? Then we can transplant any plants we have now that ought to go in some other color bed, and we can have the tall plants at the back of the right colors to match the bed in front of them?\"  \"There can be pink hollyhocks at the back of the pink bed and we already have pinks and bleeding heart and a pink peony. We've got a good start at a pink bed already,\" beamed Ethel Brown.  \"We can put golden glow or that tall yellow snapdragon at the back of the yellow bed and tall larkspurs behind the blue flowers.\"  \"The Miss Clarks have a pretty border of dwarf ageratum--that bunchy, fuzzy blue flower. Let's have that for the border of our blue bed.\"  \"I remember it; it's as pretty as pretty. They have a dwarf marigold that we could use for the yellow border.\"  \"Or dwarf yellow nasturtiums.\"  \"Or yellow pansies.\"  \"We had a yellow stock last summer that was pretty and blossomed forever; nothing seemed to stop it but the 'chill blasts of winter.'\"  \"Even the short stocks are too tall for a really flat border that would match the others. We must have some 'ten week stocks' in the yellow border, though.\"  \"Whatever we plant for the summer yellow border we must have the yellow spring bulbs right behind it--jonquils and daffodils and yellow tulips and crocuses.\"  \"They're all together now. All we'll have to do will be to select the spot for our yellow bed.\"  \"That's settled then. Mark it on this plan.\"  Roger held it out to Ethel Brown, who found the right place and indicated the probable length of the yellow bed upon it.  \"We'll have the wild garden on one side of the yellow bed and the blue on the other and the pink next the blue,\" decreed Ethel Blue.  \"We haven't decided on the pink border,\" Dorothy reminded them.  \"There's a dwarf pink candytuft that couldn't be beaten for the purpose,\" said James decisively. \"Mother and I planted some last year to see what it was like and it proved to be exactly what you want here.\"  \"I know what I'd like to have for the wild border--either wild ginger or hepatica,\" announced Helen after some thought.  \"I don't know either of them,\" confessed Tom.  \"You will after you've tramped the Rosemont woods with the U.S.C. all this spring,\" promised Ethel Brown. \"They have leaves that aren't unlike in shape--\"  \"The ginger is heart-shaped,\" interposed Ethel Blue, \"and the hepatica is supposed to be liver-shaped.\"  \"You have to know some physiology to recognize them,\" said James gravely. \"There's where a doctor's son has the advantage,\" and he patted his chest.  \"Their leaves seem much too juicy to be evergreen, but the hepatica does stay green all winter.\"  [Illustration: Wild Ginger]  \"The ginger would make the better edging,\" Helen decided, \"because the leaves lie closer to the ground.\"  \"What are the blossoms?\"  \"The ginger has such a wee flower hiding under the leaves that it doesn't count, but the hepatica has a beautiful little blue or purple flower at the top of a hairy scape.\"  \"A hairy what?\" laughed Roger.  \"A scape is a stem that grows up right from the or root-stock and carries only a flower--not any leaves,\" defined Helen.  \"That's a new one on me. I always thought a stem was a stem, whatever it carried,\" said Roger.  [Illustration: Hepatica]  \"And a scape was a 'grace' or a 'goat' according to its activities,\" concluded Tom.  \"The hepatica would make a border that you wouldn't have to renew all the time,\" contributed Dorothy, who had been thinking so deeply that she had not heard a word of this interchange, and looked up, wondering why every one was laughing.  \"Dorothy keeps her eye on the ball,\" complimented James. \"Have we decided on the background flowers for the wild bed?\"  \"Joe-Pye-Weed is tall enough,\" offered James. \"It's way up over my head.\"  \"It wouldn't cover the fence much; the blossom is handsome but the foliage is scanty.\"  \"There's a feathery meadow-rue that is tall. The leaves are delicate.\"  \"I know it; it has a fine white blossom and it grows in damp places. That will be just right. Aren't you going to have trouble with these wild plants that like different kinds of ground?\"  \"Perhaps we are,\" Helen admitted. \"Our garden is 'middling' dry, but we can keep the wet lovers moist by watering them more generously than the rest.\"  \"How about the watering systems of all these gardens, anyway? You have town water here and at Dorothy's, but how about the new place?\"  \"The town water runs out as far as Mr. Emerson's, luckily for us, and Mother says she'll have the connection made as soon as the frost is out of the ground so the builders may have all they want for their work and I can"]]]
