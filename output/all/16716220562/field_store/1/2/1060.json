Pleasure with violet eyes was in Chicago.  My passport describes me as a journalist. My employer said:  \"Go to Jerusalem.\"  I went, that was in 1920.  I had been there a couple of times before the World War, when the Turks were in full control.  So I knew about the bedbugs and the stench of the citadel moat;  the pre-war price of camels;  enough Arabic to misunderstand it when spoken fluently, and enough of the Old Testament and the Koran to guess at Arabian motives, which are important, whereas words are usually such stuff as lies are made of.  El Kudz, as Arabs call Jerusalem, is, from a certain distance, as they also call it, shellabi kabir.  Extremely beautiful. Beautiful upon a mountain.  El Kudz means The City, and in a certain sense it is that, to unnumbered millions of people. Ludicrous, uproarious, dignified, pious, sinful, naively confidential, secretive, altruistic, realistic.  Hoary-ancient and ultra-modern.  Very, very proud of its name Jerusalem, which means City of Peace.  Full to the brim with the malice of certainly fifty religions, fifty races, and five hundred thousand curious political chicaneries disguised as plans to save our souls from hell and fill some fellow's purse.  The jails are full.  \"Look for a man named Grim,\" said my employer.  \"James Schuyler Grim, American, aged thirty-four or so.  I've heard he knows the ropes.\"  The ropes, when I was in Jerusalem before the war, were principally used for hanging people at the Jaffa Gate, after they had been well beaten on the soles of their feet to compel them to tell where their money was hidden.  The Turks entirely understood the arts of suppression and extortion, which they defined as government.  The British, on the other hand, subject their normal human impulse to be greedy, and their educated craving to be gentlemanly white man's burden-bearers, to a process of compromise. Perhaps that isn't government.  But it works.  They even carry compromise to the point of not hanging even their critics if they can possibly avoid doing it.  They had not yet, but they were about to receive a brand-new mandate from a brand-new League of Nations, awkwardly qualified by Mr. Balfour's post-Armistice promise to the Zionists to give the country to the Jews, and by a war-time promise, in which the French had joined, to create an Arab kingdom for the Arabs.  So there was lots of compromising being done, and hell to pay, with no one paying, except, of course, the guests in the hotels, at New York prices.  The Zionist Jews were arriving in droves. The Arabs, who owned most of the land, were threatening to cut all the Jews' throats as soon as they could first get all their money.  Feisal, a descendant of the Prophet, who had fought gloriously against the Turks, was romantically getting ready in Damascus to be crowned King of Syria.  The French, who pride themselves on being realistic, were getting ready to go after Feisal with bayonets and poison-gas, as they eventually did.  In Jerusalem the Bolsheviks, astonishingly credulous of \"secret\" news from Moscow, and skeptical of every one's opinion but their own, were bolsheviking Marxian Utopia beneath a screen of such arrogant innocence that even the streetcorner police constables suspected them.  And Mustapha Kemal, in Anatolia, was rumoured to be preparing a holy war.  It was known as a Ghazi in those days.  He had not yet scrapped religion.  He was contemplating, so said rumour, a genuine old-fashioned moslem jihad, with modern trimmings.  A few enthusiasts astonishingly still laboured for an American mandate.  At the Holy Sepulchre a British soldier stood on guard with bayonet and bullets to prevent the priests of rival creeds from murdering one another.  The sun shone and so did the stars. General Bols reopened Pontius Pilate's water-works.  The learned monks in convents argued about facts and theories denied by archaeologists.  Old-fashioned Jews wailed at the Wailing Wall. Tommy Atkins blasphemously dug corpses of donkeys and dogs from the Citadel moat.  I arrived in the midst of all that, and spent a couple of months trying to make head or tail of it, and wondering, if that was peace, what war is?  They say that wherever a man was ever slain in Palestine a flower grows.  So one gets a fair idea of the country's mass-experience without much difficulty.  For three months of the year, from end to end, the whole landscape is carpeted with flowers so close together that, except where beasts and men have trodden winding tracks, one can hardly walk without crushing an anemone or wild chrysanthemum.  There are more battle-fields in that small land than all Europe can show.  There are streams everywhere that historians assert repeatedly \"ran blood for days.\"  Five thousand years of bloody terrorism, intermingling of races, piety, plunder, politics and pilgrims, have produced a self- consciousness as concentrated as liquid poison-gas.  The laughter is sarcastic, the humour sardonic, and the credulity beyond analysis.  For instance, when I got there, I heard the British being accused of \"imperialistic savagery\" because they had removed the leprous beggars from the streets into a clean place where they could receive medical treatment.  It was difficult to find one line of observation.  Whatever anybody told you, was reversed entirely by the next man.  The throat-distorting obligation to study Arabic called for rather intimate association with educated Arabs, whose main obsession was fear of the Zionist Jews.  The things they said against the Jews turned me pro-Zionist.  So I cautiously made the acquaintance of some gentlemen with gold-rimmed spectacles, and the things they said about the Arabs set me to sympathizing with the sons of Ishmael again.  In the midst of that predicament I met Jimgrim--Major James Schuyler Grim, to give him his full title, although hardly any one ever called him by it.  After that, bewilderment began to cease as, under his amused, painstaking fingers, thread after thread of the involved gnarl of plots and politics betrayed its course.  However, first I must tell how I met him.  There is an American Colony in Jerusalem--a community concern that runs a one-price store, and is even more savagely criticized than the British Administration, as is only natural.  The story of what they did in the war is a three-year epic.  You can't be \"epic\" and not make enemies.  A Chicago Jew assured me they were swine and horse-thieves.  But I learned that the Yemen Jews prayed for them--first prayer-- every Sabbath of the year, calling down blessings on their heads for charitable service rendered.  One hardly goes all the way to Palestine to meet Americans;  but a journalist can't afford to be wilfully ignorant.  A British official assured me they were \"good blokes\" and an Armenian told me they could skin fleas for their hides and tallow;  but the Armenian was wearing a good suit, and eating good food, which he admitted had been given to him by the American Colony.  He was bitter with them because they had refused to cash a draft on Mosul, drawn on a bank that had ceased to exist.  It seemed a good idea to call on the American Colony, at their store near the Jaffa Gate, and it turned out to be a very clean spot in a dirty city.  I taxed their generosity, and sat for hours on a ten-thousand-dollar pile of Asian rugs behind the store;  and, whatever I have missed and lost, or squandered, at least I know their story and can keep it until the proper time.  Of course, you have to allow for point of view, just as the mariner allows for variation and deviation;  but when they inferred that most of the constructive good that has come to the Near East in the last fifty years has been American, they spoke with the authority of men who have lived on the spot and watched it happen.  \"You see, the Americans who have come here haven't set up governments.  They've opened schools and colleges.  They've poured in education, and taken nothing.  Then there are thousands of Arabs, living in hovels because there's nothing better, who have been to America and brought back memories with them.  All that accounts for the desire for an American mandate--which would be a very bad thing, though, because the moment we set up a government we would lose our chance to be disinterested.  The country is better off under any other mandate, provided it gives Americans the right to teach without ruling.  America's mission is educational.  There's an American, though, who might seem to prove the contrary.  Do you see him?\"  There were two Arabs in the room, talking in low tones over by the window. I could imagine the smaller of the two as a peddler of lace and filigree-silver in the States, who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11357"],["title","Jimgrim and Allah's Peace (#1)"],["body"," taken out papers for the sake of privilege and returned full of notions to exploit his motherland.  But the tall one--never.  He was a Bedouin, if ever a son of the desert breathed.  If he had visited the States, then he had come back as unchanged as gold out of an acid bath;  and as for being born there--  \"That little beady-eyed, rat-faced fellow may be an American,\" I said.  \"In fact, of course he is, since you say so.  But as for being up to any good--\"  \"You're mistaken.  You're looking at the wrong man.  Observe the other one.\"  I was more than ever sure I was not mistaken.  Stately gesture, dignity, complexion, attitude--to say nothing of his Bedouin array and the steadiness with which he kept his dark eyes fixed on the smaller man he was talking to, had laid the stamp of the desert on the taller man from head to heel.  \"That tall man is an American officer in the British army. Doesn't look the part, eh?  They say he was the first American to be granted a commission without any pretense of his being a Canadian.  They accepted him as an American.  It was a case of that or nothing.  Lived here for years, and knew the country so well that they felt they had to have him on his own terms.\"   You can believe anything in Jerusalem after you have been in the place a week or two, so, seeing who my informant was, I swallowed the fact.  But it was a marvel.  It seemed even greater when the man strolled out, pausing to salute my host with the solemn politeness that warfare with the desert breeds.  You could not imagine that at Ellis Island, or on Broadway--even on the stage. It was too untheatrical to be acting;  too individual to be imitation;  to unself-conscious to have been acquired.  I hazarded a guess.  \"A red man, then.  Carlisle for education.  Swallowed again by the first desert he stayed in for more than a week.\"  \"Wrong.  His name is Grim.  Sounds like Scandinavian ancestry, on one side.  James Schuyler Grim--Dutch, then, on the other;  and some English.  Ten generations in the States at any rate.  He can tell you all about this country.  Why not call on him?\"  It did not need much intelligence to agree to that suggestion; but the British military take their code with them to the uttermost ends of earth, behind which they wonder why so many folks with different codes, or none, dislike them.  \"Write me an introduction,\" I said.  \"You won't need one.  Just call on him.  He lives at a place they call the junior Staff Officers' Mess--up beyond the Russian Convent and below the Zionist Hospital.\"  So I went that evening, finding the way with difficulty because they talk at least eighteen languages in Jerusalem and, with the exception of official residences, no names were posted anywhere. That was not an official residence.  It was a sort of communal boarding-house improvised by a dozen or so officers in preference to the bug-laden inconvenience of tents--in a German-owned (therefore enemy property) stone house at the end of an alley, in a garden full of blooming pomegranates.  I sent my card in by a flat-footed old Russian female, who ran down passages and round corners like a wet hen, trying to find a man-servant.  The place seemed deserted, but presently she came on her quarry in the back yard, and a very small boy in a tarboosh and knickerbockers carried the card on a tray into a room on the left.  Through the open door I could hear one quiet question and a high-pitched disclaimer of all knowledge;  then an order, sounding like a grumble, and the small boy returned to the hall to invite me in, in reasonably good English, of which he seemed prouder than I of my Arabic.  So I went into the room on the left, with that Bedouin still in mind.  There was only one man in there, who got out of a deep armchair as I entered, marking his place in a book with a Damascus dagger.  He did not look much more than middle height, nor more than medium dark complexioned, and he wore a major's khaki uniform.  \"Beg pardon,\" I said.  \"I've disturbed the wrong man.  I came to call on an American named Major Grim.\"  \"I'm Grim.\"  \"Must be a mistake, though.  The man I'm looking for is taller than you--very dark--looks, walks, speaks and acts like a Bedouin.  I saw him this afternoon in Bedouin costume in the American Colony store.\"  \"Yes, I noticed you.  Sit down, won't you?  Yes, I'm he--the Bedouin abayi* seems to add to a man's height.  Soap and water account for the rest of it.  These cigars are from the States.\" [*Long-sleeved outer cloak.]  It was hard to believe, even on the strength of his straight statement--he talking undisguised American, and smiling at me, no doubt vastly pleased with my incredulity.  \"Are you a case of Jekyll and Hyde?\" I asked.  \"No.  I'm more like both sides of a sandwich with some army mule- meat in the middle.  But I won't be interviewed.  I hate it. Besides, it's against the regulations.\"  His voice was not quite so harshly nasal as those of the Middle West, but he had not picked up the ultra-English drawl and clipped-off consonants that so many Americans affect abroad and overdo.  I don't think a wise crook would have chosen him as a subject for experiments.  He had dark eyes with noticeably long lashes; heavy eyebrows;  what the army examination-sheets describe as a medium chin;  rather large hands with long, straight fingers; and feet such as an athlete stands on, fully big for his size, but well shaped.  He was young for a major--somewhere between thirty and thirty-five.  Once he was satisfied that I would not write him up for the newspapers he showed no disinclination to talk, although it was difficult to keep him on the subject of himself, and easy to let him lose you in a maze of tribal history.  He seemed to know the ins and outs of every blood-feud from Beersheba to Damascus, and warmed to his subject as you listened.  \"You see,\" he said, by way of apology when I laughed at a string of names that to me conjured up only confusion, \"my beat is all the way from Cairo to Aleppo--both sides of the Jordan.  I'm not on the regular strength, but attached to the Intelligence--no, not permanent--don't know what the future has in store--that probably depends on whether or not the Zionists get full control, and how soon.  Meanwhile, I'm my own boss more or less--report direct to the Administrator, and he's one of those men who allows you lots of scope.\"  That was the sort of occasional glimpse he gave of himself, and then switched off into straight statements about the Zionist problem.  All his statements were unqualified, and given with the air of knowing all about it right from the beginning.  \"There's nothing here that really matters outside the Zionist- Arab problem.  But that's a big one.  People don't realize it-- even on the spot--but it's a world movement with ramifications everywhere.  All the other politics of the Near East hinge on it, even when it doesn't appear so on the surface.  You see, the Jews have international affiliations through banks and commerce.  They have blood-relations everywhere.  A ripple here may mean there's a wave in Russia, or London, or New York.  I've known at least one Arab blood-feud over here that began with a quarrel between a Jew and a Christian in Chicago.\"  \"Are the Zionists as dangerous as the Arabs seem to think?\" I asked.  \"Yes and no.  Depends what you call danger.  They're like an incoming tide.  All you can do is accept the fact and ride on top of it, move away in front of it, or go under.  The Arabs want to push it back with sword-blades.  Can't be done!\"  \"Speaking as a mere onlooker, I feel sorry for the Arabs,\" I said.  \"It has been their country for several hundred years. They didn't even drive the Jews out of it;  the Romans attended to that, after the Assyrians and Babylonians had cleaned up nine-tenths of the population.  And at that, the Jews were invaders themselves.\"  \"Sure,\" Grim answered.  \"But you can't argue with tides.  The Arabs are sore, and nobody has any right to blame them.  The English betrayed the Arabs--I don't mean the fellows out here, but the gang at the Foreign Office.\"  I glanced at his uniform.  That was a strange statement coming from a man who wore it.  He understood, and laughed.  \"Oh, the men out here all admit it.  They're as sore as the Arabs are themselves.\"  \"Then you're on the wrong side, and you know it?\" I suggested.  \"The meat,\" he said, \"is in the middle of the sandwich.  In a small way you might say I'm a doctor, staying on after a riot to stitch up cuts.  The quarrel was none of my making, although I was in it and did what I could to help against the Turks.  Like everybody else who knows them, I admire the Turks and hate what they stand for--hate their cruelty.  I was with Lawrence across the Jordan--went all the way to Damascus with him--saw the war through to a finish--in case you choose to call it finished.\"  Vainly I tried to pin him down to personal reminiscences.  He was not interested in his own story.  \"The British promised old King Hussein of Mecca that if he'd raise an Arab army to use against the Turks, there should be a united Arab kingdom afterward under a ruler of their own choosing.  The kingdom was to include Syria, Arabia and Palestine.  The French agreed.  Well, the Arabs raised the army; Emir Feisul, King Hussein's third son, commanded it;  Lawrence did so well that he became a legend.  The result was, Allenby could concentrate his army on this side of the Jordan and clean up.  He made a good job of it.  The Arabs were naturally cock-a-hoop.\"  I suggested that the Arabs with that great army could have enforced the contract, but he laughed again.  \"They were being paid in gold by the British, and had Lawrence to hold them together.  The flow of gold stopped, and Lawrence was sent home.  Somebody at the Foreign Office had changed his mind. You see, they were all taken by surprise at the speed of Allenby's campaign.  The Zionists saw their chance, and claimed Palestine.  No doubt they had"]]]
