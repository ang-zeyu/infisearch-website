Judge me, O God, and separate my cause from that of the evil-doers.”  On his arrival at the market-place, some of the spectators called out to him, “Ask the king’s mercy, Master John, that he may pardon your offences.”  He turned round, saying, “I served well and loyally his great-grandfather King Philip, his grandfather King John, and his father King Charles; none of those kings ever had anything to reproach me with, and this one would not reproach me any the more if he were of a grown man’s age and experience.  I don’t suppose that he is a whit to blame for such a sentence, and I have no cause to cry him mercy. To God alone must I cry for mercy, and I pray Him to forgive my sins.”  Public respect accompanied the old and courageous magistrate beyond the scaffold; his corpse was taken up by his friends, and at a later period honorably buried in the church of St. Catherine.  After the chastisements came galas again, of which the king and his court were immoderately fond.  Young as he was (he was but seventeen), his powerful uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, was very anxious to get him married, so as to secure his own personal influence over him.  The wise Charles V., in his dying hours, had testified a desire that his son should seek alliances in Germany.  A son of the reigning duke, Stephen of Bavaria, had come to serve in the French army, and the Duke of Burgundy had asked him if there were any marriageable princess of Bavaria.  “My eldest brother,” answered the Bavarian, “has a very beautiful daughter, aged fourteen.”  “That is just what we want,” said the Burgundian: “try and get her over here; the king is very fond of beautiful girls; if she takes his fancy, she will be Queen of France.”  The Duke of Bavaria, being informed by his brother, at first showed some hesitation.  “It would be a great honor,” said he, “for my daughter to be Queen of France; but it is a long way from here.  If my daughter were taken to France, and then sent back to me because she was not suitable, it would cause me too much chagrin.  I prefer to marry her at my leisure, and in my own neighborhood.”  The matter was pressed, however, and at last the Duke of Bavaria consented.  It was agreed that the Princess Isabel should go on a visit to the Duchess of Brabant, who instructed her, and had her well dressed, say the chroniclers, for in Germany they clad themselves too simply for the fashions of France.  Being thus got ready, the Princess Isabel was conducted to Amiens, where the king then was, to whom her portrait had already been shown.  She was presented to him, and bent the knee before him.  He considered her charming.  Seeing with what pleasure he looked upon her, the constable, Oliver de Clisson, said to Sire De Coney, “By my faith, she will bide with us.”  The same evening, the young king said to his councillor, Bureau de la Riviere, “She pleases me: go and tell my uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, to conclude at once.”  The duke, delighted, lost no time in informing the ladies of the court, who cried, “Noel!” for joy.  The duke had wished the nuptials to take place at Arras; but the young king, in his impatience, was urgent for Amiens, without delay, saying that he couldn’t sleep for her.  “Well, well,”  replied his uncle, “you must be cured of your complaint.”  On the 18th of July, 1385, the marriage was celebrated at the cathedral of Amiens, whither the Princess Isabel “was conducted in a handsome chariot, whereof the tires of the wheels were of silvern stuff.”  King, uncles, and courtiers were far from a thought of the crimes and shame which would be connected in France with the name of Isabel of Bavaria.  There is still more levity and imprudence in the marriages of kings than in those of their subjects.  Whilst this marriage was being celebrated, the war with England, and her new king, Richard II., was going on, but slackly and without result. Charles VI. and his uncle of Burgundy, still full of the proud confidence inspired by their success against the Flemish and Parisian communes, resolved to strike England a heavy blow, and to go and land there with a powerful army.  Immense preparations were made in France for this expedition.  In September, 1386, there were collected in the port of Ecluse (Sluys) and at sea, between Sluys and Blankenberg, thirteen hundred and eighty-seven vessels, according to some, and according to others only nine hundred, large and small; and Oliver de Clisson had caused to be built at Trdguier, in Brittany, a wooden town which was to be transported to England and rebuilt after landing, “in such sort,” says Froissart, “that the lords might lodge therein and retire at night, so as to be in safety from sudden awakenings, and sleep in greater security.”  Equal care was taken in the matter of supplies.  “Whoever had been at that time at Bruges, or the Dam, or the Sluys would have seen how ships and vessels were being laden by torchlight, with hay in casks, biscuits in sacks, onions, peas, beans, barley, oats, candles, gaiters, shoes, boots, spurs, iron, nails, culinary utensils, and all things that can be used for the service of man.”  Search was made everywhere for the various supplies, and they were very dear.  “If you want us and our service,”  said the Hollanders, “pay us on the nail; otherwise we will be neutral.”  To the intelligent foresight shown in these preparations was added useless magnificence.  “On the masts was nothing to be seen but paintings and gildings; everything was emblazoned and covered with armorial bearings.  But nothing came up to the Duke of Burgundy’s ship; it was painted all over outside with blue and gold, and there were five huge banners with the arms of the duchy of Burgundy and the countships of Flanders, Artois, Rethel, and Burgundy, and everywhere the duke’s device, ‘I’m a-longing.’”  The young king, too, displayed great anxiety to enter on the campaign.  He liked to go aboard his ship, saying, “I am very eager to be off; I think I shall be a good sailor, for the sea does me no harm.”  But everybody was not so impatient as the king, who was waiting for his uncle, the Duke of Berry, and writing to him letter after letter, urging him to come.  The duke, who had no liking for the expedition, contented himself with making an answer bidding him “not to take any trouble, but to amuse himself, for the matter would probably terminate otherwise than was imagined.”  The Duke of Berry at last arrived at Sluys on the 14th of October, 1386.  “If it hadn’t been for you, uncle,” said the king to him, “we should have been by this time in England.”  Three months had gone by; the fine season was past; the winds were becoming violent and contrary; the vessels come from Treguier with the constable to join the fleet had suffered much on the passage; and deliberations were recommencing touching the opportuneness, and even the feasibility, of the expedition thus thrown back. “If anybody goes to England, I will,”  said the king. But nobody went. “One day when it was calm,” says the monk of St. Denis, “the king, completely armed, went with his uncles aboard of the royal vessel; but the wind did not permit them to get more than two miles out to sea, and drove them back, in spite of the sailors’ efforts, to the shore they had just left.  The king, who saw with deep displeasure his hopes thus frustrated, had orders given to his troops to go back, and, at his departure, left, by the advice of his barons, some men-of-war to unload the fleet, and place it in a place of safety as soon as possible.  But the enemy gave them no time to execute the order.  As soon as the calm allowed the English to set sail, they bore down on the French, burned or took in tow to their own ports the most part of the fleet, carried off the supplies, and found two thousand casks full of wine, which sufficed a long while for the wants of England.”  Such a mistake, after such a fuss, was probably not unconnected with a resolution adopted by Charles VI. some time after the abandonment of the projected expedition against England.  In October, 1388, he assembled at Rheims a grand council, at which were present his two uncles, the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry [the third, the Duke of Anjou, had died in Italy, on the 20th of September, 1384, after a vain attempt to conquer the kingdom of Naples], his brother, the Duke of Orleans, his cousins, and several prelates and lords of note.  The chancellor announced thereat that he had been ordered by the king to put in discussion the question, whether it were not expedient that he should henceforth take the government of his kingdom upon himself.  Cardinal Ascelin de Montaigu, Bishop of Laon, the first to be interrogated upon this subject, replied that, in his opinion, the king was quite in a condition, as well as in a legal position, to take the government of his kingdom upon himself, and, without naming anybody, he referred to the king’s uncles, and especially to the Duke of Burgundy, as being no longer necessary for the government of France.  Nearly all who were present were of the same opinion.  The king, without further waiting, thanked his uncles for the care they had taken of his dominions and of himself, and begged them to continue their affection for him.  Neither the Duke of Burgundy nor the Duke of Berry had calculated upon this resolution; they submitted, without making any objection, but not without letting a little temper leak out.  The Duke of Berry even said that he and his brother would beg the king to confer with them more maturely on the subject"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],["title","A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#3)"],["body","he returned to Paris.  Hereupon the council broke up; the king’s two uncles started for their own dominions; and a few weeks afterwards the Cardinal-bishop of Laon died of a short illness.  “It was generally believed,” says the monk of St. Denis, “that he died of poison.”  At his own dying wish, no inquiry was instituted on this subject.  The measure adopted in the late council was, however, generally approved of.  The king was popular; he had a good heart, and courteous and gentle manners; he was faithful to his friends, and affable to all; and the people liked to see him passing along the streets.  On taking in hand the government, he recalled to it the former advisers of his father, Charles V., Bureau de la Riviere, Le Mercier de Noviant, and Le Begue de Vilaine, all men of sense and reputation.  The taxes were diminished; the city of Paris recovered a portion of her municipal liberties; there was felicitation for what had been obtained, and there was hope of more.  Charles VI.  was not content with the satisfaction of Paris only; he wished all his realm to have cognizance of and to profit by his independence.  He determined upon a visit to the centre and the south of France.  Such a trip was to himself, and to the princes and cities that entertained him, a cause of enormous expense.  “When the king stopped anywhere, there were wanted for his own table, and for the maintenance of his following, six oxen, eighty sheep, thirty calves, seven hundred chickens, two hundred pigeons, and many other things besides.  The expenses for the king were set down at two hundred and thirty livres a day, without counting the presents which the large towns felt bound to make him.”  But Charles was himself magnificent even to prodigality, and he delighted in the magnificence of which he was the object, without troubling himself about their cost to himself.  Between 1389 and 1390, for about six months, he travelled through Burgundy, the banks of the Rhone, Languedoc, and the small principalities bordering on the Pyrenees. Everywhere his progress was stopped for the purpose of presenting to him petitions or expressing wishes before him.  At Nimes and Montpellier, and throughout Languedoc, passionate representations were made to him touching the bad government of his two uncles, the Dukes of Anjou and Berry.  “They had plundered and ruined,” he was told, “that beautiful and rich province; there were five or six talliages a year; one was no sooner over than another began; they had levied quite three millions of gold from Villeneuve-d’Avignon to Toulouse.”  Charles listened with feeling, and promised to have justice done, and his father’s old councillors, who were in his train, were far from dissuading him.  The Duke of Burgundy, seeing him start with them in his train, had testified his spite and disquietude to the Duke of Berry, saying, “Aha! there goes the king on a visit to Languedoc, to hold an inquiry about those who have governed it. For all his council be takes with him only La Riviere, Le Mercier, Montaigu, and Le Begue de Vilaine.  What say you to that, my brother?”  “The king, our nephew, is young,” answered the Duke of Berry: “if he trusts the new councillors he is taking, he will be deceived, and it will end ill, as you will see.  As for the present, we must support him.  The time will come when we will make those councillors, and the king himself, rue it.  Let them do as they please, by God: we will return to our own dominions.  We are none the less the two greatest in the kingdom, and so long as we are united, none can do aught against us.”  The future is a blank, as well to the anxieties as to the hopes of men. The king’s uncles were on the point of getting back the power which they believed to be lost to them.  On the 13th of June, 1392, the constable, Oliver de Clisson, was waylaid as he was returning home after a banquet given by the king at the hostel of St. Paul.  The assassin was Peter de Craon, cousin of John IV., Duke of Brittany.  He believed De Clisson to be dead, and left him bathed in blood at a baker’s door in the street called Culture-Sainte-Catherine.  The king was just going to bed, when one of his people came and said to him, “Ah! sir, a great misfortune has happened in Paris.”  “What, and to whom?” said the king.  “To your constable, sir, who has just been slain.”  “Slain!” cried Charles; “and by whom?”  “Nobody knows; but it was close by here, in St. Catherine Street.”  “Lights! quick!” said the king; “I will go and see him;” and he set off, without waiting for his following.  When he entered the baker’s shop, De Clisson, grievously wounded, was just beginning to recover his senses.  “Ah! constable,” said the king, “and how do you feel?”  “Very poorly, dear sir.”  “And who brought you to this pass?”  “Peter de Craon and his accomplices; traitorously and without warning.”  “Constable,”  said the king, “never was anything so punished or dearly paid for as this shall be; take thought for yourself, and have no further care; it is my affair.”  Orders were immediately given to seek out Peter de Craon, and hurry on his trial.  He had taken refuge, first in his own castle of Sable, and afterwards with the Duke of Brittany, who kept him concealed, and replied to the king’s envoys that he did not know where he was.  The king proclaimed his intention of making war on the Duke of Brittany until Peter de Craon should be discovered, and justice done to the constable. Preparations for war were begun; and the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy received orders to get ready for it, themselves and their vassals.  The former, who happened to be in Paris at the time of the attack, did not care to directly oppose the king’s project; but he evaded, delayed, and predicted a serious war.  According to Froissart, he had been warned, the morning before the attack, by a simple cleric, of Peter de Craon’s design; but, “It is too late in the day,” he had said; “I do not like to trouble the king to-day; to-morrow, without fail, we will see to it.”  He had, however, forgotten or neglected to speak to his nephew.  Neither he nor his brother, the Duke of Burgundy, there is reason to suppose, were accomplices in the attack upon De Clisson, but they were not at all sorry for it.  It was to them an incident in the strife begun between themselves, princes of the blood royal, and those former councillors of Charles V., and now, again, of Charles VI., whom, with the impertinence of great lords, they were wont to call the marinosettes.  They left nothing undone to avert the king’s anger and to preserve the Duke of Brittany from the war which was threatening him.  Charles VI.’s excitement was very strong, and endured forever.  He pressed forward eagerly his preparations for war, though attempts were made to appease him.  He was recommended to take care of himself; for he had been ill, and could scarcely mount his horse; and the Duke of Burgundy remonstrated with him several times on the fatigue he was incurring.  “I find it better for me,” he answered, “to be on horseback, or working at my council, than to keep resting.  Whoso wishes to persuade me otherwise is not of my friends, and is displeasing to me.”  A letter from the Queen of Arragon gave some ground for supposing that Peter de Craon had taken refuge in Spain; and the Duke of Burgundy took advantage of it to dissuade the king from his prompt departure for the war in Brittany.  “At the very least,” he said, “it was right to send to Arragon to know the truth of the matter, and to thank the queen for her courtesy.”  “We are quite willing, uncle,” answered Charles: “you need not be vexed; but for my own part I hold that this traitor of a Peter de Craon is in no other prison and no other Barcelona than there is in being quite comfortable at the Duke of Brittany’s.”  There was no way of deterring him from his purpose.  He had got together his uncles and his troops at Le Mans; and, after passing three weeks there, he gave the word to march for Brittany.  The tragic incident which at that time occurred has nowhere been more faithfully or better narrated than in M. de Barante’s History of the Dukes of Burgundy.  “It was,” says he, “the beginning of August, 1392, during the hottest days of the year.  The sun was blazing, especially in those sandy districts.  The king was on horseback, clad in a short and tight dress called a jacket.  His was of black velvet, and very oppressive.  On his head he wore a cap of scarlet velvet, ornamented with a chaplet of large pearls, which the queen had given him at his departure.  Behind him were two pages on horseback.  In order not to incommode the king with dust, he was left to march almost alone.  To the left of him were the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry, some paces in front, conversing together.  The Duke of Orleans, the Duke of Bourbon, Sire de Coney, and some others were also in front, forming another group.  Behind were Sires de Navarre, de Bar, d’Albret, d’Artois, and many others in one pretty large troop.  They rode along in this order, and had just entered the great forest of Le Mans, when all at once there started from behind a tree by the road-side a tall man, with bare head and feet, clad in a common white smock, who, dashing forward and seizing the king’s horse by the bridle, cried, ‘Go no farther; thou art betrayed!’  [Illustration: ‘“Thou art betrayed.”’----26]  The men-at-arms hurried up immediately, and striking the hands of the fellow with the butts of their lances, made him let go the bridle.  As he had the appearance of a poor madman, and nothing more, he was allowed to go without any questioning, and he followed the king for nearly half an hour, repeating the same cry from a distance.  The king was much troubled at this sudden apparition; and his head, which was very weak, was quite turned by it.  Nevertheless the march was continued.  When the forest had been traversed, they came to a great sandy plain, where the rays of the sun were more "]]]
