Nevertheless, that is what occurred. A hum of voices--a tread of hoofs--and the very man hoped for--he and Hilary Kincaid--recognized by their voices--dismounted at the pool's margin. Sam and Maxime stole forward.     VIII   ONE KILLED  The newcomers' talk, as they crouched busily over their horses' feet, was on random themes: Dan Rice, John Owens, Adelina and Carlotta Patti, the comparative merits of Victor's and Moreau's restaur'--hah! Greenleaf snatched up his light cane, sprang erect, and gazed close into the mild eyes of Maxime. Gibbs's more wanton regard had no such encounter; Hilary gave him a mere upward glance while his hands continued their task.  \"Good-evening,\" remarked Gibbs.  \"Good-morning,\" chirped Hilary, and scrubbed on. \"Do you happen to be Mr. Samuel Gibbs?--Don't stop, Fred, Maxime won't object to your working on.\"  \"Yes, he will!\" swore Gibbs, \"and so will I!\"  Still Hilary scrubbed: \"Why so, Mr. Gibbs?\"  \"Bic-ause,\" put in Maxime, \"he's got to go back through the same mud he came!\"  \"Why, then,\" laughed Hilary, \"I may as well knock off, too,\" and began to wash his hands.  \"No,\" growled Gibbs, \"you'll ride on; we're not here for you.\"  \"You can't have either of us without the other, Mr. Gibbs,\" playfully remarked Kincaid. The bull-drivers loomed out of the fog. Hilary leisurely rose and moved to draw a handkerchief.  \"None o' that!\" cried Gibbs, whipping his repeater into Kincaid's face. Yet the handkerchief came forth, its owner smiling playfully and drying his fingers while Mr. Gibbs went on blasphemously to declare himself \"no chicken.\"  \"Oh, no,\" laughed Hilary, \"none of us is quite that. But did you ever really study--_boxing?_\" At the last word Gibbs reeled under a blow in the face; his revolver, going off harmlessly, was snatched from him, Maxime's derringer missed also, and Gibbs swayed, bleeding and sightless, from Hilary's blows with the butt of the revolver. Presently down he lurched insensible, Hilary going half-way with him but recovering and turning to the aid of his friend. Maxime tore loose from his opponent, beseeching the bull-drivers to attack, but beseeching in vain. Squawking and chattering like parrot and monkey, they spurred forward, whirled back, gathered lassos, cursed frantically as Sam fell, sped off into the fog, spurred back again, and now reined their ponies to their haunches, while Kincaid halted Maxime with Gibbs's revolver, and Greenleaf sprang to the bits of his own and Hilary's terrified horses. For two other men, the Gascon and the Italian, had glided into the scene from the willows, and the Gascon was showing Greenleaf two big knives, one of which he fiercely begged him to accept.  \"Take it, Fred!\" cried Hilary while he advanced on the defiantly retreating Maxime; but as he spoke a new cry of the drovers turned his glance another way. Gibbs had risen to his knees unaware that the Italian, with yet another knife, was close behind him. At a bound Hilary arrested the lifted blade and hurled its wielder aside, who in the next breath seemed to spring past him head first, fell prone across the prostrate Gibbs, turned face upward, and slid on and away--lassoed. Both bull-drivers clattered off up the road.  \"Hang to the nags, Fred!\" cried Hilary, and let Maxime leap to Gibbs's side, but seized the Gascon as with murderous intent he sprang after him. It took Kincaid's strength to hold him, and Gibbs and his partner would have edged away, but--\"Stand!\" called Hilary, and they stood, Gibbs weak and dazed, yet still spouting curses. The Gascon begged in vain to be allowed to follow the bull-drivers.  \"Stay here!\" said Hilary in French, and the butcher tarried. Hilary passed the revolver to his friend, mounted and dashed up the highway.  The Gascon stayed with a lively purpose which the enfeebled Gibbs was the first to see. \"Stand back, you hell-hound!\" cried the latter, and with fresh oaths bade Greenleaf \"keep him off!\"  Maxime put Gibbs on Greenleaf's horse (as bidden), and was about to lead him, when Kincaid galloped back.  \"Fred,\" exclaimed Hilary, \"they've killed the poor chap.\" He wheeled. \"Come, all hands,\" he continued, and to Greenleaf added as they went, \"He's lying up here in the road with--\"  Greenleaf picked up something. \"Humph!\" said Hilary, receiving it, \"knives by the great gross. He must have used this trying to cut the lasso; the one he had back yonder flew into the pond.\" He reined in: \"Here's where they--Why, Fred--why, I'll swear! They've come back and--Stop! there was a skiff\"--he moved to the levee and peered over--\"It's gone!\"  The case was plain, and while from Greenleaf's saddle Gibbs broke into frantic revilings of the fugitives for deserting him and Maxime to sink their dead in the mid-current of the fog-bound river, Kincaid and his friend held soft counsel. Evidently the drovers had turned their horses loose, knowing they would go to their stable. No despatch to stop Greenleaf could be sent by anyone up the railroad till the Committee of Public Safety had authorized it, so Hilary would drop them a line out of his pocket note-book, and by daybreak these prisoners could go free.  \"Mr. Gibbs\"--he said as he wrote--\"I have the sprout of a notion that you and Mr. Lafontaine would be an ornament to a field-battery I'm about to take command of. I'd like to talk with you about that presently.\" He tore out the page he had written and beckoned the Gascon aside:  \"_Mon ami_\"--he showed a roll of \"city money\" and continued in French--\"do you want to make a hundred dollars--fifty now and fifty when you bring me an answer to this?\"  The man nodded and took the missive.  The old \"Jackson Railroad\" avoided Carrollton and touched the river for a moment only, a short way beyond, at a small bunch of flimsy clapboard houses called Kennerville. Here was the first stop of its early morning outbound train, and here a dozen or so passengers always poked their heads out of the windows. This morning they saw an oldish black man step off, doff his hat delightedly to two young men waiting at the platform's edge, pass them a ticket, and move across to a pair of saddled horses. The smaller of the pair stepped upon the last coach, but kept his companion's hand till the train had again started.  \"Good-by, Tony,\" cried the one left behind.  \"Good-by, Jake,\" called the other, and waved. His friend watched the train vanish into the forest. Then, as his horse was brought, he mounted and moved back toward the city.  Presently the negro, on the other horse, came up almost abreast of him. \"Mahs' Hil'ry?\" he ventured.  \"Well, uncle Jerry?\"  \"Dat's a pow'ful good-lookin' suit o' clo'es what L'tenant Greenfeel got awn.\"  \"Jerry! you cut me to the heart!\"  The negro tittered: \"Oh, as to dat, I don't 'spute but yone is betteh.\"  The master heaved a comforted sigh. The servant tittered again, but suddenly again was grave. \"I on'y wish to Gawd,\" he slowly said, \"dat de next time you an' him meet--\"  \"Well--next time we meet--what then?\"  \"Dat you bofe be in de same sawt o' clo'es like you got on now.\"     IX   HER HARPOON STRIKES  The home of the Callenders was an old Creole colonial plantation-house, large, square, strong, of two stories over a stoutly piered basement, and surrounded by two broad verandas, one at each story, beneath a great hip roof gracefully upheld on Doric columns. It bore that air of uncostly refinement which is one of the most pleasing outward features of the aloof civilization to which it, though not the Callenders, belonged.  Inside, its aspect was exceptional. There the inornate beauty of its finish, the quiet abundance of its delicate woodwork, and the high spaciousness and continuity of its rooms for entertainment won admiration and fame. A worthy setting, it was called, for the gentle manners with which the Callenders made it alluring.  They, of course, had not built it. The late Judge had acquired it from the descendants of a planter of indigo and coffee who in the oldest Creole days had here made his home and lived his life as thoroughly in the ancient baronial spirit as if the Mississippi had been the mediaeval Rhine. Only its perfect repair was the Judge's touch, a touch so modestly true as to give it a charm of age and story which the youth and beauty of the Callender ladies only enhanced, enhancing it the more through their lack of a male protector--because of which they were always going to move into town, but never moved.  Here, some nine or ten days after Greenleaf's flight, Hilary Kincaid, in uniform at last, was one of two evening visitors, the other being Mandeville. In the meantime our lover of nonsense had received a \"hard jolt.\" So he admitted in a letter to his friend, boasting, however, that it was unattended by any \"internal injury.\" In the circuit of a single week, happening to be thrown daily and busily into \"her\" society, \"the harpoon had struck.\"  He chose the phrase as an honest yet delicate reminder of the compact made when last the two chums had ridden together.  All three of the Callenders were in the evening group, and the five talked about an illumination of the city, set for the following night. In the business centre the front of every building was already being hung with fittings from sidewalk to cornice. So was to be celebrated the glorious fact (Constance and Mandeville's adjective) that in the previous month Louisiana had seized all the forts and lighthouses in her borders and withdrawn from the federal union by a solemn ordinance signed in tears. This great lighting up, said Hilary, was to be the smile of fortitude after the tears. Over the city hall now floated daily the new flag of the state, with the colors of its stripes--  \"Reverted to those of old Spain,\" murmured Anna, mainly to herself yet somewhat to Hilary. Judge Callender had died a Whig, and politics interested the merest girls those days.  Even at the piano, where Anna played and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11719"],["title","Kincaid's Battery (#6)"],["body","hovered, in pauses between this of Mozart and that of Mendelssohn, there was much for her to ask and him to tell about; for instance, the new \"Confederate States,\" a bare fortnight old! Would Virginia come into them? Eventually, yes.  \"Oh, yes, yes, yes!\" cried Constance, overhearing. (Whatever did not begin with oh, those times, began with ah.)  \"And _must_ war follow?\" The question was Anna's again, and Hilary sat down closer to answer confidentially:  \"Yes, the war was already a fact.\"  \"And might not the Abolitionists send their ships and soldiers against New Orleans?\"  \"Yes, the case was supposable.\"  \"And might not Jackson's battlefield of 1815, in close view from these windows, become a new one?\"  To avoid confessing that old battlefields have that tendency the Captain rose and took up a guitar; but when he would have laid it on her knee she pushed it away and asked the song of him; asked with something intimate in her smiling undertone that thrilled him, yet on the next instant seemed pure dream stuff. The others broke in and Constance begged a song of the new patriotism; but Miranda, the pretty stepmother, spoke rather for something a thousand miles and months away from the troubles and heroics of the hour; and when Anna seconded this motion by one fugitive glance worth all their beseechings Hilary, as he stood, gayly threw open his smart jacket lest his brass buttons mar the instrument, and sang with a sudden fervor that startled and delighted all the group:    \"Drink to me only with thine eyes.\"  In the midst of which Constance lifted a knowing look across to Miranda, and Miranda sent it back.  There was never an evening that did not have to end, and at last the gentlemen began to make a show of leaving. But then came a lively chat, all standing in a bunch. To-morrow's procession, the visitors said, would form in Canal Street, move up St. Charles, return down Camp Street into Canal, pass through it into Rampart, take the Bayou Road and march to a grand review away out in the new camp of instruction at the Creole Race-Course. Intermediately, from a certain Canal Street balcony, Flora would present the flag! the gorgeous golden, silken, satin battle standard which the Callenders and others had helped her to make. So --good-night--good-night.  The last parting was with Mandeville, at the levee-road gate, just below which he lived in what, during the indigo-planter's life, had been the overseer's cottage. At a fine stride our artillerist started townward, his horse being stabled near by in that direction. But presently he halted, harkened after the Creole's receding step, thought long, softly called himself names, and then did a small thing which, although it resulted in nothing tragic at the time, marked a turning point in his life. He leapt the grove fence, returned to the shadows of the garden, and silently made his way to its eastern, down-river side. Already the dwelling's lower lights were going out while none yet shone above, and he paused in deep shade far enough away to see, over its upper veranda's edge, the tops of its chamber windows.     X   SYLVIA SIGHS  The house was of brick. So being, in a land where most dwellings are of wood, it had gathered beauty from time and dignity from tried strength, and with satisfying grace joined itself to its grounds, whose abundance and variety of flowering, broad-leaved evergreens lent, in turn, a poetic authenticity to its Greek columns and to the Roman arches of its doors and windows. Especially in these mild, fragrant, blue nights was this charm potent, and the fair home seemed to its hidden beholder forever set apart from the discords and distresses of a turbulent world. And now an upper window brightened, its sash went up, and at the veranda's balustrade Anna stood outlined against the inner glow.  She may have intended but one look at the stars, but they and the spiced air were enchanting, and in confidence that no earthly eye was on her she tarried, gazing out to the farthest gleam of the river where it swung southward round the English Turn.  Down in the garden a mirthful ecstasy ran through all the blood of her culprit observer and he drank to her only with his eyes. Against the window's brightness her dark outline showed true, and every smallest strand of her hair that played along the contours of brow and head changed his merriment to reverence and bade his heart recognize how infinitely distant from his was her thought. Hilary Kincaid! can you read no better than that?  Her thought was of him. Her mind's eye saw him on his homeward ride. It marked the erectness of his frame, the gayety of his mien, the dance of his locks. By her inner ear she heard his horse's tread passing up the narrow round-stone pavements of the Creole Quarter, presently to echo in old St. Peter Street under the windows of Pontalba Row--one of which was Flora's. Would it ring straight on, or would it pause between that window and the orange and myrtle shades of Jackson Square? Constance had said that day to Miranda--for this star-gazer to overhear--that she did not believe Kincaid loved Flora, and the hearer had longed to ask her why, but knew she could not tell. Why is a man's word. \"They're as helpless without it,\" the muser recalled having very lately written on a secret page, \"as women are before it. And yet a girl can be very hungry, at times, for a why. They say he's as brave as a lion--why is he never brave to me?\"  So futilely ended the strain on the remembered page, but while his unsuspected gaze abode on her lifted eyes her thought prolonged the note: \"If he meant love to-night, why did he not stand to his meaning when I laughed it away? Was that for his friend's sake, or is he only not brave enough to make one wild guess at me? Ah, I bless Heaven he's the kind that cannot! And still--oh, Hilary Kincaid, if you were the girl and I the man! I shouldn't be on my way home; I'd be down in this garden--.\" She slowly withdrew.  Hilary, stepping back to keep her in sight, was suddenly aware of the family coachman close at his side. Together they moved warily a few steps farther.  \"You mus' escuse me, Cap'n,\" the negro amiably whispered. \"You all right, o' co'se! Yit dese days, wid no white gen'leman apputtainin' onto de place--\"  \"Old man!\" panted Hilary, \"you've saved my life!\"  \"Oh, my Lawd, no! Cap'n, I--\"  \"Yes, you have! I was just going into fits! Now step in and fetch me out here--\" He shaped his arms fantastically and twiddled his fingers.  Bending with noiseless laughter the negro nodded and went.  Just within her window, Anna, still in reverie, sat down at a slender desk, unlocked a drawer, then a second one inside it, and drew forth--no mere secret page but--a whole diary! \"To Anna, from Miranda, Christmas, 1860.\" Slowly she took up a pen, as gradually laid it by again, and opposite various dates let her eyes rest on--not this, though it was still true:  \"The more we see of Flora, the more we like her.\"  Nor this: \"Heard a great, but awful, sermon on the duty of resisting Northern oppression.\"  But this: \"Connie thinks he 'inclines' to me. Ho! all he's ever said has been for his far-away friend. I wish he would incline, or else go ten times as far away! Only not to the war--God forbid! Ah, me, how I long for his inclining! And while I long he laughs, and the more he laughs the more I long, for I never, never so doted on any one's laugh. Oh, shame! to love before--\"  What sound was that below? No mocking-bird note, no south wind in the foliage, but the kiss of fingers on strings! Warily it stole in at the window, while softly as an acacia the diary closed its leaves. The bent head stirred not, but a thrill answered through the hearer's frame as a second cadence ventured up and in and a voice followed it in song. Tremblingly the book slid into the drawer, inner and outer lock clicked whisperingly, and gliding to a door she harkened for any step of the household, while she drank the strains, her bosom heaving with equal alarm and rapture.  If any song is good which serves a lover's ends we need claim no more for the one that rose to Anna on the odors of the garden and drove her about the room, darting, clinging, fluttering, returning, like her own terrified bird above her in its cage.        When Sylvia sighs     And veils the worshipped wonder       Of her blue eyes     Their sacred curtains under,   Naught can so nigh please me as my tender anguish.   Only grief can ease me while those lashes languish.       Woe best beguiles;     Mirth, wait thou other whiles;     Thou shalt borrow all my sorrow       When Sylvia smiles.  But what a strange effect! Could this be that Anna. Callender who \"would no more ever again seem small, than the ocean?\" Is this that maiden of the \"belated, gradual smile\" whom the singer himself so lately named \"a profound pause?\" Your eyes, fair girl, could hardly be more dilated if they saw riot, fire, or shipwreck. Nor now could your brow show more exaltation responsive to angels singing in the sun; nor now your frame show more affright though soldiers were breaking in your door. Anna, Anna! your fingers are clenched in your palms, and in your heart one frenzy implores the singer to forbear, while another bids him sing on though the heavens fall. Anna Callender! do you not know this? You have dropped into a chair, you grip the corners of your desk. Now you are up again, trembling and putting out your lights. And now you seek to relight them, but cannot remember the place or direction of anything, and when you have found out what you were looking for, do not know how much time has flown, except that the song is still in its first stanza. Are you aware that your groping hand has seized and rumpled into its palm a long strand of slender ribbon lately unwound from your throat?  A coy tap sounds on her door and she glides to it. \"Who--who?\" But in spite of her it opens to the bearer of a lamp, her sister Constance.  \"Who--who--?\" she"]]]
