And Gurnemanz deep wondered, and he spoke: \"How unlike days of yore her step and way,-- Grace in her step and grace in countenance. Perchance God giveth grace to her sad heart. Perchance this holy morn hath wrought the change. O day of boundless mercy, 'twas for this-- Her soul's salvation and another life-- That I have wakened her from sleep of death! See, with a pitcher comes she from the hut, And fills it at the spring!... But who is this That now I see approaching through the woods And drawing slowly near the holy spring? Yon knight is not a brother of the Grail, With all that war accoutrement of gloom.\"  And one drew near, a splendid armored knight, His armor shining black as darkest night, His helmet closed, and lowered was his spear. Forward he walked as if he moved in dream, As if a servant of some high emprise, Neither to right nor left he turned his face, But seated him beyond the holy spring.  And Gurnemanz close watched him and his ways And wondered who the splendid knight might be; Then ventured near with courteous salute: \"All hail to thee, sir knight, and welcome here! Art thou astray, and may I give thee aid?... No word for me, but bowing of thy head? Perchance my lord is under knightly vow To perfect silence, as my vows bind me To courtesy and service. Therefore hear Where now thou art and what is due this place. This is a holy woods and this a holy spring, Within the domain of the Holy Grail, Where in his armor none hath right to come With helmet closed, and shield and shining spear. Besides, dost thou not know what day this is? Not know the day? From whence then hast thou come? What heathen darkness hath been thine abode That thou rememberest not this holy day,-- The ever-hallowèd Good-Friday morn? Put off thy heavy armor, for the Lord, Bare of defence, on this most holy day, Did freely shed His blood to save the world, And bring the time of kindness and of peace.\"  And silently, without an answering word, The stranger knight fixed in the ground his spear, And at its foot lay down his shield and sword, Opened his helmet, placed it on the ground, And knelt in silent prayer before the spear.  [Illustration]  With wonder and deep feeling, Gurnemanz Had watched the knight, and as he saw him pray And saw the face upturnèd to the light, He knew him, and to Kundry softly spake, Who now drew near: \"Thou knowest him. 'T is he Who long ago laid low the snow-white swan,-- He whom in anger I thrust out-of-doors. Where has he wandered since that luckless day? But look! Behold the spear! It is the Spear For which my eager heart has longed and prayed! O holy day, on which the Spear comes home! O happy day to which my soul awakes!\"  And when the knight had ended all his prayer, He slowly rose, and looked about and saw The agèd hermit, snowy-crowned with age; And suddenly he knew that kindly form, And rushed to Gurnemanz with eager face, And crying: \"Good my friend, all hail to thee! Thank Heaven that I find thee once again!\"  And Gurnemanz: \"Dost thou remember me, After so many long and weary years, And bent with grief and care as now I am, And covered with the clustering snow of age? But tell me, what has passed since last we met? And how didst thou come here, and whence, and why?\"  And Parsifal--for it was he--replied: \"Through error and through sufferings I come, Through many failures and through countless woes. Thus was the guileless One at last enlightened, And taught the depths of pity and of love. And can it be that now the trials are ended And peace has come, and holiness at last? Yet here I am within this holy wood, And here art thou, dear servant of the Grail. But, do I err, this place seems somehow changed From what it was in days of yore? The life, The joy seem to have vanished, and I feel As if a cloud hung over Monsalvat.\"  Then Gurnemanz: \"Too true thine every word, But tell me, pray, for whom thou here dost seek?\"  And with a wondrous light within his eyes, Did Parsifal with earnest words reply: \"I come to him whose piteous moans of pain I heard long years ago, nor understood.-- The guileless One went forth from thee a boy, Impetuous, fierce, who did not know himself; He comes again a man with tenderest pity, And deep experience and heart enlightened, To be the healer of the stricken King. But long the course by which I learned the way, And bitter all the wanderings, where sin Had laid its snares, and sought to curse my soul. Many the perils and right fierce the strife, Yet clung I to the pathway of the right. And at the last I won the sacred Spear By God's good mercy and His boundless love. But even with the Spear within my hands Oft came a fearful dread upon my heart, Lest I might lose this treasure that He gave Into my keeping, for never durst I use This sacred Spear in battle-blows or strife,-- It was for healing wounds, not making them,-- And so in many a fight I took the wounds From other weapons, but profaned this never. I bring it home virgin and undefiled, And consecrate it to its healing work. Thus does it gleam before thee, even now,-- The wonder-working power, the sacred Spear!\"  And Gurnemanz, with joyous heart, replied: \"O grace and glory, blessèd gift of God! O miracle of holy healing power That thou hast brought us in the sacred Spear! Sir knight, if it were once a cruel thing That drove thee wandering in the evil world, And if it ever were a curse to strive In subtle snares and temptings manifold, Believe me, now the spell is surely broken. Here thou art now within the Grail's dominion. Here wait for thee an eager band of knights. Ah! how they need the blessing that thou bringest. For since that morning when thou first wert here, The sorrow and the anguish that thou heard'st Have grown until the woe has covered all. And King Amfortas, soul and body wracked, Did crave in desperation only death, And so refused to show the Holy Grail. No prayer, no sorrow of his brother-knights Could move him to fulfil his sacred trust. Close in its shrouded shrine the Cup remained. For King Amfortas hopes that if his eyes Shall see the Grail no more, that he may die, And with his life thus end his bitter pain. The holy Supper also is denied us,-- Our daily portion only common food. Thereby exhausted is our former strength. No more the cry for succor comes to us, Nor call to holy war from distant lands; But pale and wretched wander forth the knights, Hopeless and leaderless in these dark days. Here in the forest I myself have hid, In quiet waiting for the hour of death, Already come unto my warrior-lord, The agèd Titurel. For when no more He could behold the vision of the Grail, Then did his sad heart fail him, and he died.\"  And Parsifal in sudden sorrow cried: \"What have I done to let this curse go on? Why have I wasted all these precious years In wandering, while here was deepest woe? Why did I never see the needed truth That no repentance can assuage the grief, No expiation can atone the wrong, Until another feels the bitter pain, And takes it willingly to his own heart? Here I was chosen to redeem the wrong, And save the anguish of the stricken King, And yet how blind has been my foolish heart! Can blindness mean impurity and sin, And may it be that I am all deceived,-- My way all lost, my hopes forever gone?\"  And in the bitter struggle of his soul, And in the self-abasement of his heart, And in the strong reaction that oft comes To spiritual natures, deep and fine, He would have fallen helpless to the ground; But Gurnemanz quick caught him in his arms, And led him sinking to a grassy mound, And Kundry ran with water for his brow.  But Gurnemanz: \"Not so. The holy spring Shall now revive our pilgrim's waning strength. My heart sees noble work for him to-day. A sacred mystic duty doth await him. He shall be pure as light, and all the dust Of travel and of error washed away!\"  Then from his limbs they took the mighty greaves, And loosed the woven corselet from his side, And bathed his feet and brought him to himself.  And straight he asked: \"And shall I see the King?\"  And Gurnemanz: \"Thou shalt behold the King This very day and speak thy word to him. The death-rites of mine agèd warrior-lord, The noble Titurel, doth call me to the court; And there again the Grail shall be revealed. For King Amfortas hath by solemn vow Promised once more to open up the shrine, Sworn to fulfil the long-neglected office, To sanctify the saintly father's end, And expiate the deep unfilial crime, The added sin, that broke his father's heart.\"  And as he spoke, the kindly Kundry bathed The feet of Parsifal, who looked at her With gentle wonder and a pitying love, And said: \"So humbly hast thou washed my feet, Perchance the good and faithful Gurnemanz May sprinkle my poor head with holy water, And give my soul his gracious benediction.\"  And Gurnemanz took water from the spring, And sprinkled Parsifal in holy rite, And uttered over him the benediction: \"O guileless One, thrice blessèd be and pure, And free forever from all care and sin!\"  Then Kundry from her bosom drew a vial, A golden vial, full of perfumed oil, And poured its soothing fragrance on his feet And dried them with her flowing unbound hair.  And Parsifal reached out and took the vial, And gave it unto Gurnemanz and said: \"This woman hath anointed these my feet; Let now the faithful servant of the Grail, And minister of sainted Titurel, Anoint my chosen head with holy oil, That I may take the office, as God will, And you to-day may greet me as your King.\"  So Gurnemanz performed the kingly rite, Anointing Parsifal with holy oil, And laid the hands of blessing on his head, And said: \"So came the ancient word to us; So with my blessing do I greet thee now, And hail thee as the God-elected King! Thou art His guileless One, by pity 'lightened, Patient in suffering, and taught by woe. Much hast thou suffered to redeem another; God give thee now the grace for crowning all.\"  Then Parsifal took"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11633"],["title","Parsifal (#8)"],["body","from the spring, And came to Kundry kneeling at his feet, And sprinkled her with solemn mystic rite, And said: \"This be the first work of my trust. Kundry, in Christ's dear name I sprinkle thee. Be thou redeemed and holy evermore!\"  And in a passion of rejoicing tears She kneeled there and her voice gave praise to God.  And Parsifal looked on the fields and woods, So fair and radiant in the morning light, And uttered forth the rapture of his heart: \"How beautiful these morning meadows are! So fresh, so sweet, so radiantly pure! Full many a flower in other days I saw, But full of subtle poison was their breath And they were snares of baneful witchery. But these are God's own blossoms full of grace. These twining vines that burst with purple bloom, These fragrant flowers, so innocent and fair,-- They speak to me of loving childhood's days, And tell me of the boundless love of God.\"  Then Gurnemanz: \"On fair Good-Friday morn, All nature seems a-thrill with new delight.\"  And Parsifal: \"Yet strange that it is so. That darkest day of agony divine Might well have cast a pall of gloom o'er all, And plunged all Nature into deepest woe.\"  \"No, no,\" the gentle Gurnemanz replied, \"The Saviour's work hath wrought a miracle, And now the grateful tears of penitence Are holy dew that falls upon the world, And makes it bloom in fair and lustrous beauty; And all creation knows God's saving work, And praises Him for His redeeming grace. No more the agony of that grim Cross, But now the joy of man redeemed and saved, Freed from the load of sin by conquering faith, And purified by Love's great sacrifice. Each sprouting blade and meadow-flower doth see Something of God's grace in the heart of man; For as the Lord was tender unto man, So man in turn will love God's flowering earth. The whole creation therefore doth rejoice, And every bird and flower is full of praise, And Nature everywhere is full of God, And sweet has dawned this day of innocence.\"  Then Kundry, with the tears still in her eyes, Looked up at Parsifal, and soft he spake: \"I saw the hearts that mocked us fade away, But love shall bloom eternal in God's grace. Blest tears that speak the blessing in thy heart. But weep no more. God's grace is full of joy,-- Smile with all Nature, joyously redeemed!\"  [Illustration]  And down he bent, and on her pure white brow Printed the kiss of God's redeeming love.  Then chimed the distant bells, and louder yet The gradual growing music of sweet sounds.  And Gurnemanz: \"The hour has come, midday. Permit me now to lead thee to the Grail!\"  And Parsifal was clothed in holy garb,-- The dove-embroidered mantle of the Grail,-- Which Gurnemanz had brought him from the hut, And grasped the sacred Spear and followed on.  Again they climbed the rocky passages, And reached at last the castle's pillared hall, Crowned with the mighty dome of blazing light. Slowly the knights in mourning garb marched in, Bearing the corpse of saintly Titurel. Slowly the servitors marched sadly in, Bearing the pale Amfortas on his couch. And going on in front the acolytes Bore in the Grail in heavy covered shrine. And as they marched, they sang this solemn hymn:    \"Here do we bear the Holy Grail,      Long hidden in this shrine;    No more its wondrous grace is seen,      No more its glories shine!    \"Here saintly Titurel we bear,      The faithful knight and king;    When he no more the Grail could see,      He died in sorrowing!    \"And here Amfortas now we bear--      God shrive him from the past;    For he has sworn to do his trust      And show the Grail at last!\"  And suffering Amfortas turned and groaned, And raised himself a little on his couch, And cried: \"O woe is me! O woe is me! My tears are flowing from my very heart. Would I had died before I saw this hour. Yet death is mercy that I cannot hope.\"  Then solemnly the knights, with sacred awe, Uncovered saintly Titurel, and looked Once more upon that well-belovèd face, And there was sound of weeping everywhere. And sadly did Amfortas speak the words: \"My father, blest among God's heroes ever! Thou before whom the angels loved to bow, Forgive me for my most unfilial sin,-- I sought for death, yet struck thee to the heart, By holding back the vision of the Grail. O thou who now in radiance divine Dost see the blest Redeemer face to face, Beseech for me that when I show the Grail It may give life anew to these dear knights-- But death to me--sweet death for which I long. O death, kind mercy of the living God, Stifle this heart and rid me of my pain! Father, I plead with thee to cry to Him: 'Redeemer, give my son release and peace!'\"  Thereat the knights came pressing up and cried: \"Unveil the Grail and do thine office now! The death-rite of thy father doth demand it!\"  But in a mad despair Amfortas rose, And wildly rushed among the startled knights, And cried: \"No, no, I cannot do it now! Death is so near me, only let me die! Why should I turn again to dreadful life? Rather I plead with you to slay me here! See, here I stand, the open wound is here! Thus am I poisoned, here flows forth the blood! Draw ye your swords and plunge them to the hilt! Kill both the sinner and his awful pain! Then will the Grail forever shine for you, And blessing come to you for evermore!\"  But all shrank back in terror from the King, Who stood in frenzied madness there alone.  Then Parsifal drew near, and slowly spake: \"Only one weapon serves to kill that pain. The one that struck can staunch thy wound again!\"  And with the sacred Spear he touched the King. And lo! a miracle of healing power!-- The wound was staunched and a deep thrill of love Changed agony to rapture all divine.  And Parsifal spake on: \"Thou art forgiven. Body and soul are cleansed by God's free grace Thy life for evermore shall happy be Within the service of the Holy Grail. But never more as King, for I have come To take thy place as God hath so decreed. Thy sorrows shall be blessings unto thee, For thus by pity was the guileless 'lightened, And God's own Son was perfect made by pain. Knights of the Grail, behold the sacred Spear! God gave it me but to restore to you!\"  And all with reverent joy beheld the Spear, And thanked the Lord that it had come again To bring the golden days of health and power. And as they looked in rapture and in awe, The Spear-point seemed to glow with holy fire And sparkled, turning red like flowing blood.  And Parsifal spoke on: \"O miracle And marvel of the holy power of God. This sacred Spear is flowing with the blood, The very blood of that same wondrous Saviour, That floweth in the crystal of the Grail. The double blessing shall its glory give. Open the shrine! Reveal the Holy Grail!\"  And quick the sacred shrine was opened wide And Parsifal long knelt in silent prayer, Absorbed in holy rapture at the sight.  Then suddenly the heavenly splendor fell And flamed and glowed within the sacred Cup, While wondrous glory flooded all the hall And filled each heart with deep and holy joy. And from the lofty dome a dove descended, And hovered lovingly o'er Parsifal.  Thus Parsifal was crowned of God and man, And slowly did he lift the Holy Grail, The red blood glowing with its wondrous light, And waved it in the air before the knights, Who knelt around him, praising God on high. And there had Kundry come with new-found faith And crept within the splendor of the Grail And, with its light upon her, died,--redeemed!  And still did Parsifal hold up the Grail, Seeming a vision of the very Christ, His crimson mantle changed to lustrous whiteness. His lips seemed speaking loving benediction; And marvellous the red glow of the Grail; And beautiful the white dove soaring there. While from the heights the softest voices sang:    \"Highest wonder! blest salvation!    Praise the Lord for our redemption!\""]]]
