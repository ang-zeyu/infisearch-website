And yet there's a track here into a fine large paddock, open and clear, too, where I'm going to put these cattle into.'  I stared at him, without speaking, thinking was he mad.  'No! the old man isn't mad, youngster,' he said; 'not yet, at least. I'm going to show you a trick that none of you native boys are up to, smart as you think yourselves.' Here he got off the old mare, and began to lead her to the edge of the mountain.  'Now, you rally the cattle well after me,' he said; 'they'll follow the old mare after a bit. I left a few cows among 'em on purpose, and when they “draw” keep 'em going well up, but not too fast.'  He had lengthened the bridle of the mare, and tied the end of a light tether rope that he had round her neck to it. I saw her follow him slowly, and turn down a rocky track that seemed to lead straight over a bluff of the precipice.  However, I gave the word to 'head on'. The dog had started rounding 'em up as soon as he saw the old mare walk towards the mountain side, and the cattle were soon crushed up pretty close to the mare's heels.  Mind this, that they were so footsore and tender about the hoofs that they could not have run away from us on foot if they had tried.  After 'ringing' a bit, one of the quiet cows followed up the old mare that was walking step by step forward, and all the rest followed her like sheep. Cattle will do that. I've seen a stockrider, when all the horses were dead beat, trying to get fat cattle to take a river in flood, jump off and turn his horse loose into the stream. If he went straight, and swam across, all the cattle would follow him like sheep.  Well, when the old mare got to the bluff she turned short round to the right, and then I saw that she had struck a narrow path down a gully that got deeper and deeper every yard we went. There was just room for a couple or three calves to go abreast, and by and by all of 'em was walking down it like as if they was the beasts agoing into Noah's Ark. It wound and wound and got deeper and deeper till the walls of rock were ever so far above our heads. Our work was done then; the cattle had to walk on like sheep in a race. We led our horses behind them, and the dog walked along, saving his sore feet as well as he could, and never tried to bite a beast once he got within the walls. He looked quite satisfied, and kept chuckling almost to himself. I really believe I've seen dogs laugh. Once upon a time I've read of they'd have taken poor Crib for a familiar spirit, and hanged or burnt him. Well, he knew a lot, and no mistake. I've seen plenty of Christians as he could buy and sell, and no trouble to him. I'm dashed if the old mare, too, didn't take a pleasure in working cattle on the cross. She was the laziest old wretch bringing up the cows at home, or running in the horses. Many a time Jim and I took a turn out of her when father didn't know. But put her after a big mob of cattle--she must have known they couldn't be ours--and she'd clatter down a range like the wall of a house, and bite and kick the tail cattle if they didn't get out of her way. They say dogs and horses are all honest, and it's only us as teaches 'em to do wrong. My notion's they're a deal like ourselves, and some of 'em fancies the square racket dull and safe, while some takes a deal kindlier to the other. Anyhow, no cattle-duffer in the colonies could have had a better pair of mates than old Sally and Crib, if the devil himself had broken 'em in special for the trade.  It was child's play now, as far as the driving went. Jim and I walked along, leading our horses and yarning away as we used to do when we were little chaps bringing in the milkers.  'My word, Dick, dad's dropped into a fine road through this thundering mountain, hasn't he? I wonder where it leads to? How high the rock-walls are getting above us!' he says. 'I know now. I think I heard long ago from one of the Crosbies of a place in the ranges down towards behind the Nulla Mountain, “Terrible Hollow”. He didn't know about it himself, but said an old stockman told him about it when he was drunk. He said the Government men used to hide the cattle and horses there in old times, and that it was never found out.'  'Why wasn't it found out, Jim? If the old fellow “split” about it some one else would get to know.'  'Well, old Dan said that they killed one man that talked of telling; the rest were too frightened after that, and they all swore a big oath never to tell any one except he was on the cross.'  'That's how dad come to know, I suppose,' said Jim. 'I wish he never had. I don't care about those cross doings. I never did. I never seen any good come out of them yet.'  'Well, we must go through with it now, I suppose. It won't do to leave old dad in the lurch. You won't, will you, Jim?'  'You know very well I won't,' says Jim, very soberlike. 'I don't like it any the more for that. But I wish father had broke his leg, and was lying up at home, with mother nursing him, before he found out this hell-hole of a place.'  'Well, we're going to get out of it, and soon too. The gully seems getting wider, and I can see a bit of open country through the trees.'  'Thank God for that!' says Jim. 'My boots'll part company soon, and the poor devils of calves won't have any hoofs either, if there's much more of this.'  'They're drawing faster now. The leading cattle are beginning to run. We're at the end of the drive.'  So it was. The deep, rocky gully gradually widened into an open and pretty smooth flat; this, again, into a splendid little plain, up to the knees in grass; a big natural park, closed round on every side with sandstone rockwalls, as upright as if they were built, and a couple of thousand feet above the place where we stood.  This scrub country was crossed by two good creeks; it was several miles across, and a trifle more in length. Our hungry weaners spread out and began to feed, without a notion of their mothers they'd left behind; but they were not the only ones there. We could see other mobs of cattle, some near, some farther off; horses, too; and the well-worn track in several ways showed that this was no new grazing ground.  Father came riding back quite comfortable and hearty-like for him.  'Welcome to Terrible Hollow, lads,' says he. 'You're the youngest chaps it has ever been shown to, and if I didn't know you were the right stuff, you'd never have seen it, though you're my own flesh and blood. Jump off, and let your horses go. They can't get away, even if they tried; they don't look much like that.'  Our poor nags were something like the cattle, pretty hungry and stiff. They put their heads down to the thick green grass, and went in at it with a will.  'Bring your saddles along with you,' father said, 'and come after me. I'll show you a good camping place. You deserve a treat after last night's work.'  We turned back towards the rocky wall, near to where we had come in, and there, behind a bush and a big piece of sandstone that had fallen down, was the entrance to a cave. The walls of it were quite clean and white-looking, the floor was smooth, and the roof was pretty high, well blackened with smoke, too, from the fires which had been lighted in it for many a year gone by.  A kind of natural cellar had been made by scooping out the soft sandstone behind a ledge. From this father took a bag of flour and corn-meal. We very soon made some cakes in the pan, that tasted well, I can tell you. Tea and sugar too, and quart pots, some bacon in a flour-bag; and that rasher fried in the pan was the sweetest meat I ever ate in all my born days.  Then father brought out a keg and poured some rum into a pint pot. He took a pretty stiff pull, and then handed it to us. 'A little of it won't hurt you, boys,' he said, 'after a night's work.'  I took some--not much; we hadn't learned to drink then--to keep down the fear of something hanging over us. A dreadful fear it is. It makes a coward of every man who doesn't lead a square life, let him be as game as he may.  Jim wouldn't touch it. 'No,' he said, when I laughed at him, 'I promised mother last time I had more than was good for me at Dargo Races that I wouldn't touch it again for two years; and I won't either. I can stand what any other man can, and without the hard stuff, either.'  'Please yourself,' said father. 'When you're ready we'll have a ride through the stock.'  We finished our meal, and a first-rate one it was. A man never has the same appetite for his meals anywhere else that he has in the bush, specially if he has been up half the night. It's so fresh, and the air makes him feel as if he'd ate nothing for a week. Sitting on a log, or in the cave, as we were, I've had the best meal I've ever tasted since I was born. Not like the close-feeling, close-smelling, dirty-clean graveyard they call a gaol. But it's no use beginning on that. We were young men, and free, too. Free! By all the devils in hell, if there are devils--and there must be to tempt a man, or how could he be so great a fool, so blind a born idiot, as to do anything in this world that would put his freedom in jeopardy? And what for? For folly and nonsense. For a few pounds he could earn with a month's honest work and be all the better man for it. For a false woman's smile that he could buy, and ten like her, if he only kept straight and saving. For a bit of sudden pride or vanity or passion. A short bit of what looks like pleasure, against months and years of weariness, and cold and heat, and dull half-death, with maybe a dog's death at the end!  I could cry like a child when I think of it now. I have cried many's the time and often since I have been shut up here, and dashed my head against the stones till I pretty nigh knocked all sense and feeling out of it, not so much in repentance, though I don't say I feel sorry, but to think what a fool, fool, fool I'd been. Yes, fool, three times over--a hundred times--to put my liberty and life against such a miserable stake--a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11984"],["title","A Pluralistic Universe (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team      A PLURALISTIC UNIVERSE   Hibbert Lectures at Manchester College on the Present Situation in Philosophy   BY WILLIAM JAMES     1909     CONTENTS   LECTURE I  THE TYPES OF PHILOSOPHIC THINKING 1    Our age is growing philosophical again, 3. Change of tone since 1860, 4.   Empiricism and Rationalism defined, 7. The process of Philosophizing:   Philosophers choose some part of the world to interpret the whole by, 8.   They seek to make it seem less strange, 11. Their temperamental   differences, 12. Their systems must be reasoned out, 13. Their tendency   to over-technicality, 15. Excess of this in Germany, 17. The type of   vision is the important thing in a philosopher, 20. Primitive thought,   21. Spiritualism and Materialism: Spiritualism shows two types, 23.   Theism and Pantheism, 24. Theism makes a duality of Man and God, and   leaves Man an outsider, 25. Pantheism identifies Man with God, 29. The   contemporary tendency is towards Pantheism, 30. Legitimacy of our demand   to be essential in the Universe, 33. Pluralism versus Monism: The 'each-   form' and the 'all-form' of representing the world, 34. Professor Jacks   quoted, 35. Absolute Idealism characterized, 36. Peculiarities of the   finite consciousness which the Absolute cannot share, 38. The finite   still remains outside of absolute reality, 40.   LECTURE II  MONISTIC IDEALISM 41    Recapitulation, 43. Radical Pluralism is to be the thesis of these   lectures, 44. Most philosophers contemn it, 45. Foreignness to us of   Bradley's Absolute, 46. Spinoza and 'quatenus,'47. Difficulty of   sympathizing with the Absolute, 48. Idealistic attempt to interpret it,   50. Professor Jones quoted, 52. Absolutist refutations of Pluralism, 54.   Criticism of Lotze's proof of Monism by the analysis of what interaction   involves, 55. Vicious intellectualism defined, 60. Royce's alternative:   either the complete disunion or the absolute union of things, 61.   Bradley's dialectic difficulties with relations, 69. Inefficiency of the   Absolute as a rationalizing remedy, 71. Tendency of Rationalists to fly   to extremes, 74. The question of 'external' relations, 79. Transition to   Hegel, 91.   LECTURE III  HEGEL AND HIS METHOD 83    Hegel's influence. 85. The type of his vision is impressionistic, 87.   The 'dialectic' element in reality, 88. Pluralism involves possible   conflicts among things, 90. Hegel explains conflicts by the mutual   contradictoriness of concepts, 91. Criticism of his attempt to transcend   ordinary logic, 92. Examples of the 'dialectic' constitution of things,   95. The rationalistic ideal: propositions self-securing by means of   double negation, 101. Sublimity of the conception, 104. Criticism of   Hegel's account: it involves vicious intellectualism, 105. Hegel is a   seer rather than a reasoner, 107. 'The Absolute' and 'God' are two   different notions, 110. Utility of the Absolute in conferring mental   peace, 114. But this is counterbalanced by the peculiar paradoxes which   it introduces into philosophy, 116. Leibnitz and Lotze on the 'fall'   involved in the creation of the finite, 119. Joachim on the fall of   truth into error, 121. The world of the absolutist cannot be perfect,   123. Pluralistic conclusions, 125.   LECTURE IV  CONCERNING FECHNER 131    Superhuman consciousness does not necessarily imply an absolute   mind, 134. Thinness of contemporary absolutism, 135. The   tone of Fechner's empiricist pantheism contrasted with that of the   rationalistic sort, 144. Fechner's life, 145. His vision, the 'daylight   view,' 150. His way of reasoning by analogy, 151. The whole universe   animated, 152. His monistic formula is unessential, 153. The   Earth-Soul, 156. Its differences from our souls, 160. The earth as   an angel, 164. The Plant-Soul, 165. The logic used by Fechner,   168. His theory of immortality, 170. The 'thickness' of his imagination,   173. Inferiority of the ordinary transcendentalist pantheism,   to his vision, 174.   LECTURE V  THE COMPOUNDING OF CONSCIOUSNESS 179   The assumption that states of mind may compound themselves, 181. This   assumption is held in common by naturalistic psychology, by   transcendental idealism, and by Fechner, 184. Criticism of it by the   present writer in a former book, 188. Physical combinations, so-called,   cannot be invoked as analogous, 194. Nevertheless, combination must be   postulated among the parts of the Universe, 197. The logical objections   to admitting it, 198. Rationalistic treatment of the question brings us   to an _impasse_, 208. A radical breach with intellectualism is required,   212. Transition to Bergson's philosophy, 214. Abusive use of concepts,   219.   LECTURE VI  BERGSON AND HIS CRITIQUE OF INTELLECTUALISM 223    Professor Bergson's personality, 225. Achilles and the tortoise, 228.   Not a sophism, 229. We make motion unintelligible when we treat it by   static concepts, 233. Conceptual treatment is nevertheless of immense   practical use, 235. The traditional rationalism gives an essentially   static universe, 237. Intolerableness of the intellectualist view, 240.   No rationalist account is possible of action, change, or immediate life,   244. The function of concepts is practical rather than theoretical, 247.   Bergson remands us to intuition or sensational experience for the   understanding of how life makes itself go, 252. What Bergson means by   this, 255. Manyness in oneness must be admitted, 256. What really exists   is not things made, but things in the making, 263. Bergson's   originality, 264. Impotence of intellectualist logic to define a   universe where change is continuous, 267. Livingly, things _are_ their   own others, so that there is a sense in which Hegel's logic is true,   270.   LECTURE VII  THE CONTINUITY OF EXPERIENCE 275    Green's critique of Sensationalism, 278. Relations are as immediately   felt as terms are, 280. The union of things is given in the immediate   flux, not in any conceptual reason that overcomes the flux's aboriginal   incoherence, 282. The minima of experience as vehicles of continuity,   284. Fallacy of the objections to self-compounding, 286. The concrete   units of experience are 'their own others,' 287. Reality is confluent   from next to next, 290. Intellectualism must be sincerely renounced,   291. The Absolute is only an hypothesis, 292. Fechner's God is not the   Absolute, 298. The Absolute solves no intellectualist difficulty, 296.   Does superhuman consciousness probably exist? 298.   LECTURE VIII  CONCLUSIONS 301    Specifically religious experiences occur, 303. Their nature, 304.   They corroborate the notion of a larger life of which we are a part,   308. This life must be finite if we are to escape the paradoxes of   monism, 310. God as a finite being, 311. Empiricism is a better   ally than rationalism, of religion, 313. Empirical proofs of larger   mind may open the door to superstitions, 315. But this objection   should not be deemed fatal, 316. Our beliefs form parts of reality,   317. In pluralistic empiricism our relation to God remains least   foreign, 318. The word 'rationality' had better be replaced by the   word 'intimacy,' 319. Monism and pluralism distinguished and   defined, 321. Pluralism involves indeterminism, 324. All men use   the 'faith-ladder' in reaching their decision, 328. Conclusion, 330.   NOTES 333   APPENDICES    A. THE THING AND ITS RELATIONS 847    B. THE EXPERIENCE OF ACTIVITY 870    C. ON THE NOTION OF REALITY AS CHANGING 895   INDEX 401     LECTURE I   THE TYPES OF PHILOSOPHIC THINKING  As these lectures are meant to be public, and so few, I have assumed all very special problems to be excluded, and some topic of general interest required. Fortunately, our age seems to be growing philosophical again--still in the ashes live the wonted fires. Oxford, long the seed-bed, for the english world, of the idealism inspired by Kant and Hegel, has recently become the nursery of a very different way of thinking. Even non-philosophers have begun to take an interest in a controversy over what is known as pluralism or humanism. It looks a little as if the ancient english empirism, so long put out of fashion here by nobler sounding germanic formulas, might be repluming itself and getting ready for a stronger flight than ever. It looks as if foundations were being sounded and examined afresh.  Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general head. As these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up, and, on the whole, less acrimony in discussion, for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked. As I look back into the sixties, Mill, Bain, and Hamilton were the only official philosophers in Britain. Spencer, Martineau, and Hodgson were just beginning. In France, the pupils of Cousin were delving into history only, and Renouvier alone had an original system. In Germany, the hegelian impetus had spent itself, and, apart from historical scholarship, nothing but the materialistic controversy remained, with such men as Büchner and Ulrici as its champions. Lotze and Fechner were the sole original thinkers, and Fechner was not a professional philosopher at all.  The general impression made was of crude issues and oppositions, of small subtlety and of a widely spread ignorance. Amateurishness was rampant. Samuel Bailey's 'letters on the philosophy of the human mind,' published in 1855, are one of the ablest expressions of english associationism, and a book of real power. Yet hear how he writes of Kant: 'No one, after reading the extracts, etc., can be surprised to hear of a declaration by men of eminent abilities, that, after years of study, they had not succeeded in gathering one clear idea from the"]]]
