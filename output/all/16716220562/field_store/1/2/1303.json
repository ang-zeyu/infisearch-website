They also were in civil dress, yet wore an air that goes only with military training. The taller was Hilary Kincaid, the other his old-time, Northern-born-and-bred school chum, Fred Greenleaf. Kincaid, coming home, had found him in New Orleans, on duty at Jackson Barracks, and for some weeks they had enjoyed cronying. Now they had been a day or two apart and had chanced to meet again at this spot. Kincaid, it seems, had been looking at a point hard by with a view to its fortification. Their manner was frankly masterful though they spoke in guarded tones.  \"No,\" said Kincaid, \"you come with me to this drill. Nobody'll take offence.\"  \"Nor will you ever teach your cousin to handle a battery,\" replied Greenleaf, with a sedate smile.  \"Well, he knows things we'll never learn. Come with me, Fred, else I can't see you till theatre's out--if I go there with her--and you say--\"  \"Yes, I want you to go with her,\" murmured Greenleaf, so solemnly that Kincaid laughed outright.  \"But, after the show, of course,\" said the laugher, \"you and I'll ride, eh?\" and then warily, \"You've taken your initials off all your stuff?... Yes, and Jerry's got your ticket. He'll go down with your things, check them all and start off on the ticket himself. Then, as soon as you--\"  \"But will they allow a slave to do so?\"  \"With my pass, yes; 'Let my black man, Jerry--'\"  The garden took the pair into its depths a moment too soon for the old soldier to see them as he came out upon the side veranda with a cloud on his brow that showed he had heard his nephew's laugh.     II   CARRIAGE COMPANY  Bareheaded the uncle crossed the fountained court, sat down at a table and read again. In the veranda a negro, his own slave, hired to this hotel, held up an elegant military cap, struck an inquiring attitude, and called softly, \"Gen'al?\"  \"Bring it with the coffee.\"  But the negro instantly brought it without the coffee and placed it on the table with a delicate flourish, shuffled a step back and bowed low:  \"Coffee black, Gen'al, o' co'se?\"  \"Black as your grandmother.\"  The servant tittered: \"Yas, suh, so whah it flop up-siden de cup it leave a lemon-yalleh sta-ain.\"  He capered away, leaving the General to the little steamboats and to a blessed ignorance of times to be when at \"Vicksburg and the Bends\" this same waiter would bring his coffee made of corn-meal bran and muddy water, with which to wash down scant snacks of mule meat. The listless eye still roamed the arid page as the slave returned with the fragrant pot and cup, but now the sitter laid it by, lighted a cigar and mused:--  In this impending war the South would win, of course--oh, God is just! But this muser could only expect to fall at the front. Then his large estate, all lands and slaves, five hundred souls--who would inherit that and hold it together? Held together it must be! Any partition of it would break no end of sacredly humble household and family ties and work spiritual havoc incalculable. There must be but one heir. Who? Hilary's mother had been in heaven these many years, the mother of Adolphe eighteen months; months quite enough to show the lone brother how vast a loss is the absence of the right mistress from such very human interests as those of a great plantation. Not only must there be but one heir, but he _must have the right wife_.  The schemer sipped. So it was Anna for Hilary if he could bring it about. So, too, it must be Hilary for his adjutant-general, to keep him near enough to teach him the management of the fortune coming to him if he, Hilary, would only treat his kind uncle's wishes--reasonably. With the cup half lifted he harkened. From a hidden walk and bower close on the garden side of this vine-mantled fence sounded footsteps and voices:  \"But, Fred! where on earth did she get--let's sit in here--get that rich, belated, gradual smile?\"  A memory thrilled the listening General. \"From her mother,\" thought he, and listened on.  \"It's like,\" continued his nephew--\"I'll tell you what it's like. It's like--Now, let me alone! You see, one has to _learn_ her beauty--by degrees. You know, there _is_ a sort of beauty that flashes on you at first sight, like--like the blaze of a ball-room. I was just now thinking of a striking instance--\"  \"From Mobile? You always are.\"  \"No such thing! Say, Fred, I'll tell you what Miss Anna's smile is like. It's as if you were trying--say in a telescope--for a focus, and at last all at once it comes and--there's your star!\"  The Northerner softly assented.  \"Fred! Fancy Flora Valcour with that smile!\"  \"No! Hilary Kincaid, I think you were born to believe in every feminine creature God ever made. No wonder they nickname you as they do. Now, some girls are quite too feminine for me.\"  In his own smoke the General's eyes opened aggressively. But hark! His nephew spoke again:  \"Fred, if you knew all that girl has done for that boy and that grandmother--It may sound like an overstatement, but you must have observed--\"  \"That she's a sort of overstatement herself?\"  \"Go to grass! _Your_ young lady's not even an understatement; she's only a profound pause. See here! what time is it? I prom--\"  On the uncle's side of the fence a quick step brought a newcomer, a Creole of maybe twenty-nine years, member of his new staff, in bright uniform:  \"Ah, Général, yo' moze ob-edient! Never less al-lone then when al-lone? 'T is the way with myseff--\"  He seemed not unrefined, though of almost too mettlesome an eye; in length of leg showing just the lack, in girth of waist just the excess, to imply a better dignity on horseback and to allow a proud tailor to prove how much art can overcome. Out on the road a liveried black coachman had halted an open carriage, in which this soldier had arrived with two ladies. Now these bowed delightedly from it to the General, while Kincaid and his friend stood close hid and listened agape, equally amused and dismayed.  \"How are you, Mandeville?\" said the General. \"I am not nearly as much alone as I seem, sir!\"  A voice just beyond the green-veiled fence cast a light on this reply and brought a flush to the Creole's very brows. \"Alas! Greenleaf,\" it cried, \"we search in vain! He is not here! We are even more alone than we seem! Ah! where is that peerless chevalier, my beloved, accomplished, blameless, sagacious, just, valiant and amiable uncle? Come let us press on. Let not the fair sex find him first and snatch him from us forever!\"  The General's scorn showed only in his eyes as they met the blaze of Mandeville's. \"You were about to remark--?\" he began, but rose and started toward the carriage.  There not many minutes later you might have seen the four men amicably gathered and vying in clever speeches to pretty Mrs. Callender and her yet fairer though less scintillant step-daughter Anna.     III   THE GENERAL'S CHOICE  Anna Callender. In the midst of the gay skirmish and while she yielded Greenleaf her chief attention, Hilary observed her anew.  What he thought he saw was a golden-brown profusion of hair with a peculiar richness in its platted coils, an unconsciously faultless poise of head, and, equally unconscious, a dreamy softness of sweeping lashes. As she laughed with the General her student noted further what seemed to him a rare silkiness in the tresses, a vapory lightness in the short strands that played over the outlines of temple and forehead, and the unstudied daintiness with which they gathered into the merest mist of a short curl before her exquisite ear.  [Illustration: Anna]  But when now she spoke with him these charms became forgettable as he discovered, or fancied he did, in her self-oblivious eyes, a depth of thought and feeling not in the orbs alone but also in the brows and lids, and between upper and under lashes as he glimpsed them in profile while she turned to Mandeville. And now, unless his own insight misled him, he observed how unlike those eyes, and yet how subtly mated with them, was her mouth; the delicate rising curve of the upper lip, and the floral tenderness with which it so faintly overhung the nether, wherefrom it seemed ever about to part yet parted only when she spoke or smiled.  \"A child's mouth and a woman's eyes,\" he mused.  When her smiles came the mouth remained as young as before, yet suddenly, as truly as the eyes, showed--showed him at least--steadfastness of purpose, while the eyes, where fully half the smile was, still unwittingly revealed their depths of truth.  \"Poor Fred!\" he pondered as the General and Mandeville entered the carriage and it turned away.  A mile or two from Carrollton down the river and toward the city lay the old unfenced fields where Hilary had agreed with Irby to help him manoeuvre his very new command. Along the inland edge of this plain the railway and the common road still ran side by side, but the river veered a mile off. So Mandeville pointed out to the two ladies as they, he, and the General drove up to the spot with Kincaid and Greenleaf as outriders. The chosen ground was a level stretch of wild turf maybe a thousand yards in breadth, sparsely dotted with shoulder-high acacias. No military body was yet here, and the carriage halted at the first good view point.  Mrs. Callender, the only member of her family who was of Northern birth and rearing, was a small slim woman whose smile came whenever she spoke and whose dainty nose went all to merry wrinkles whenever she smiled. It did so now, in the shelter of her diminutive sunshade opened flat against its jointed handle to fend off the strong afternoon beams, while she explained to Greenleaf--dismounted beside the wheels with Mandeville--that Constance, Anna's elder sister, would arrive by and by with Flora Valcour. \"Connie\", she said, had been left behind in the clutches of the dressmaker!  \"Flora,\" she continued, crinkling her nose ever so kind-heartedly at Greenleaf, \"is Lieutenant Mandeville's cousin,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11719"],["title","Kincaid's Battery (#2)"],["body"," know. Didn't he tell you something back yonder in Carrollton?\"  Greenleaf smiled an admission and her happy eyes closed to mere chinks. What had been told was that Constance had yesterday accepted Mandeville.  \"Yes,\" jovially put in the lucky man, \"I have divulge' him that, and he seem' almoze as glad as the young lady herseff!\"  Even to this the sweet widow's misplaced wrinkles faintly replied, while Greenleaf asked, \"Does the Lieutenant's good fortune account for the--'clutches of the dressmaker'?\"  It did. The Lieutenant hourly expecting to be ordered to the front, this wedding, like so many others, would be at the earliest day possible. \"A great concession,\" the lady said, turning her piquant wrinkles this time upon Mandeville. But just here the General engrossed attention. His voice had warmed sentimentally and his kindled eye was passing back and forth between Anna seated by him and Hilary close at hand in the saddle. He waved wide:  \"This all-pervading haze and perfume, dew and dream,\" he was saying, \"is what makes this the Lalla Rookh's land it is!\" He smiled at himself and confessed that Carrollton Gardens always went to his head. \"Anna, did you ever hear your mother sing--    \"'There's a bower of roses--'?\"  She lighted up to say yes, but the light was all he needed to be lured on through a whole stanza, and a tender sight--Ocean silvering to brown-haired Cynthia--were the two, as he so innocently strove to recreate out of his own lost youth, for her and his nephew, this atmosphere of poetry.    \"'To sit in the roses and hear the bird's song!'\"  he suavely ended--\"I used to make Hilary sing that for me when he was a boy.\"  \"Doesn't he sing it yet?\" asked Mrs. Callender.  \"My God, madame, since I found him addicted to comic songs I've never asked him!\"  Kincaid led the laugh and the talk became lively. Anna was merrily accused by Miranda (Mrs. Callender) of sharing the General's abhorrence of facetious song. First she pleaded guilty and then reversed her plea with an absurd tangle of laughing provisos delightful even to herself. At the same time the General withdrew from his nephew all imputation of a frivolous mind, though the nephew avowed himself nonsensical from birth and destined to die so. It was a merry moment, so merry that Kincaid's bare mention of Mandeville as Mandy made even the General smile and every one else laugh. The Creole, to whom any mention of himself, (whether it called for gratitude or for pistols and coffee,) was always welcome, laughed longest. If he was Mandy, he hurried to rejoin, the absent Constance \"muz be Candy--ha, ha, ha!\" And when Anna said Miranda should always thenceforth be Randy, and Mrs. Callender said Anna ought to be Andy, and the very General was seduced into suggesting that then Hilary would be Handy, and when every one read in every one's eye, the old man's included, that Brodnax would naturally be Brandy, the Creole bent and wept with mirth, counting all that fine wit exclusively his.  \"But, no!\" he suddenly said, \"Hilary he would be Dandy, bic-ause he's call' the ladies' man!\"  \"No, sir!\" cried the General. \"Hil--\" He turned upon his nephew, but finding him engaged with Anna, faced round to his chum: \"For Heaven's sake, Greenleaf, does he allow--?\"  \"He can't help it now,\" laughed his friend, \"he's tagged it on himself by one of his songs.\"  \"Oh, by Jove, Hilary, it serves you right for singing them!\"  Hilary laughed to the skies, the rest echoing.  \"A ladies' man!\" the uncle scoffed on. \"Of all things on God's earth!\" But there he broke into lordly mirth: \"Don't you believe _that_ of him, ladies, at any rate. If only for my sake, Anna, don't you _ever_ believe a breath of it!\"  The ladies laughed again, but now Kincaid found them a distraction. Following his glance cityward they espied a broad dust-cloud floating off toward the river. He turned to Anna and softly cried, \"Here come your guns, trying to beat the train!\"  The ladies stood up to see. An unseen locomotive whistled for a brief stop. The dust-cloud drew nearer. The engine whistled to start again, and they could hear its bell and quickening puff. But the dust-cloud came on and on, and all at once the whole six-gun battery--six horses to each piece and six to each caisson--captain, buglers, guidon, lieutenants, sergeants and drivers in the saddle, cannoneers on the chests--swept at full trot, thumping, swaying, and rebounding, up the highway and off it, and, forming sections, swung out upon the field in double column, while the roaring train rolled by it and slowed up to the little frame box of Buerthe's Station with passengers cheering from every window.  The Callenders' carriage horses were greatly taxed in their nerves, yet they kept their discretion. Kept it even when now the battery flashed from column into line and bore down upon them, the train meanwhile whooping on toward Carrollton. And what an elated flock of brightly dressed citizens and citizenesses had alighted from the cars--many of them on the moment's impulse--to see these dear lads, with their romantically acquired battery, train for the holiday task of scaring the dastard foe back to their frozen homes! How we loved the moment's impulse those days!  What a gay show! And among the very prettiest and most fetchingly arrayed newcomers you would quickly have noticed three with whom this carriage group exchanged signals. Kincaid spurred off to meet them while Greenleaf and Mandeville helped Anna and Miranda to the ground. \"There's Constance,\" said the General.  \"Yes,\" Mrs. Callender replied, \"and Flora and Charlie Valcour!\" as if that were the gleefulest good luck of all.     IV   MANOEUVRES  Captain Irby, strong, shapely, well clad, auburn-haired, left his halted command and came into the carriage group, while from the train approached his cousin and the lithe and picturesque Miss Valcour.  The tallish girl always looked her best beside some manly form of unusual stature, and because that form now was Hilary's Irby was aggrieved. All their days his cousin had been getting into his light, and this realization still shaded his brow as Kincaid yielded Flora to him and returned to Anna to talk of things too light for record.  Not so light were the thoughts Anna kept unuttered. Here again, she reflected, was he who (according to Greenleaf) had declined to command her guns in order to let Irby have them. Why? In kindness to his cousin, or in mild dislike of a woman's battery? If intuition was worth while, this man was soon to be a captain somewhere. Here was that rare find for which even maidens' eyes were alert those days--a born leader. No ladies' man this--\"of all things on God's earth!\" A men's man! And yet--nay, _therefore_--a man for some unparagoned woman some day to yield her heart and life to, and to have for her very own, herself his consummate adornment. She cast a glance at Flora.  But her next was to him as they talked on. How nearly black was the waving abundance of his hair. How placid his brow, above eyes whose long lashes would have made them meltingly tender had they not been so large with mirth: \"A boy's eyes,\" thought she while he remembered what he had just called hers. She noted his mouth, how gently firm: \"A man's mouth!\"  Charlie Valcour broke in between them: \"Is there not going to be any drill, after all?\"  \"Tell Captain Irby you can't wait any longer,\" replied Kincaid with a mock frown and gave Anna yet gayer attention a minute more. Then he walked beside his cousin toward the command, his horse close at his back. The group, by pairs, chose view points. Only Miss Valcour stayed in the carriage with the General, bent on effecting a change in his mind. In Mobile Flora had been easily first in any social set to which she condescended. In New Orleans, brought into the Callenders' circles by her cousin Mandeville, she had found herself quietly ranked second to Anna, and Anna now yet more pointedly outshining her through the brazen splendor of this patriotic gift of guns. For this reason and others yet to appear she had planned a strategy and begun a campaign, one of whose earliest manoeuvres must be to get Irby, not Kincaid, made their uncle's adjutant-general, and therefore to persuade the uncle that to give Kincaid the battery would endear him to Anna and so crown with victory the old man's perfectly obvious plan.  Greenleaf left his horse tied and walked apart with Anna. This, he murmured, was the last time they would be together for years.  \"Yes,\" she replied with a disheartening composure, although from under the parasol with which he shaded her she met his eyes so kindly that his heart beat quicker. But before he could speak on she looked away to his fretting horse and then across to the battery, where a growing laugh was running through the whole undisciplined command. \"What is it about?\" she playfully inquired, but then saw. In response to the neigh of Greenleaf's steed Hilary's had paused an instant and turned his head, but now followed on again, while the laughter ended in the clapping of a hundred hands; for Kincaid's horse had the bridle free on his neck and was following his master as a dog follows. Irby scowled, the General set his jaws, and Hilary took his horse's bridle and led him on.  \"That's what _I_ want to do every time I look at him!\" called Charlie to his sister.  \"Then look the other way!\" carolled back the slender beauty. To whom Anna smiled across in her belated way, and wondered if the impulse to follow Hilary Kincaid ever came to women.  But now out yonder the two cousins were in the saddle, Irby's sabre was out, and soon the manoeuvres were fully under way. Flora, at the General's side, missed nothing of them, yet her nimble eye kept her well aware that across here in this open seclusion the desperate Greenleaf's words to Anna were rarely explanatory of the drill.  \"And now,\" proclaimed Mandeville, \"you'll see them form into line fazed to the rear!\" And Flora, seeing and applauding, saw "]]]
