The other brother nodded.  \"Tell him now,\" he said.  \"Little brother,\" said Kwitoff, and he rose from beside the flame and stood erect, for he was tall, \"will you give your life?\"  \"What for?\" asked Serge.  The brothers shook their heads.  \"We cannot tell you that,\" they said. \"That would be too much. Will you join us?\"  \"In what?\" asked Serge.  \"We must not say,\" said the brothers. \"We can only ask are you willing to help our enterprise with all your power and with your life if need be?\"  \"What is your enterprise?\" asked Serge.  \"We must not divulge it,\" they said. \"Only this: will you give your life to save another life, to save Russia?\"  Serge paused. He thought of Olga Ileyitch. Only to save her life would he have given his.  \"I cannot,\" he answered.  \"Good night, little brother,\" said Kwitoff gently, and he turned back to his work.  Thus the months passed.  Serge studied without ceasing. \"If there is truth,\" he thought, \"I shall find it.\" All the time he Thought of Olga Ileyitch. His face grew pale. \"Justice, Justice,\" he thought, \"what is justice and truth?\"     CHAPTER III  Now when Serge had been six months in the house of Madame Vasselitch, Ivan Ivanovitch, his father, sent Itch, the serving man, and Yump, the cook, his wife, to Moscow to see how Serge fared. And Ivan first counted out rubles into a bag, \"ten, and ten and still ten,\" till Itch said, \"It is enough. I will carry that.\"  Then they made ready to go. Itch took a duck from the pond and put a fish in his pocket, together with a fragrant cheese and a bundle of sweet garlic. And Yump took oil and dough and mixed it with tar and beat it with an iron bar so as to shape it into a pudding.  So they went forth on foot, walking till they came to Moscow.  \"It is a large place,\" said Itch, and he looked about him at the lights and the people.  \"Defend us,\" said Yump. \"It is no place for a woman.\"  \"Fear nothing,\" said Itch, looking at her.  So they went on, looking for the house of Madame Vasselitch.  \"How bright the lights are!\" said Itch, and he stood still and looked about him. Then he pointed at a burleski, or theatre. \"Let us go in there and rest,\" he said.  \"No,\" said Yump, \"let us hurry on.\"  \"You are tired,\" said Itch. \"Give me the pudding and hurry forward, so that you may sleep. I will come later, bringing the pudding and the fish.\"  \"I am not tired,\" said Yump.  So they came at last to the house of Madame Vasselitch. And when they saw Serge they said, \"How tall he is and how well grown!\" But they thought, \"He is pale. Ivan Ivanoviteh must know.\"  And Itch said, \"Here are the rubles sent by Ivan Ivanovitch. Count them, little son, and see that they are right.\"  \"How many should there be?\" said Serge.  \"I know not,\" said Itch. \"You must count them and see.\"  Then Yump said, \"Here is a pudding, little son, and a fish, and a duck and a cheese and garlic.\"  So that night Itch and Yump stayed in the house of Madame Vasselitch.  \"You are tired,\" said Itch. \"You must sleep.\"  \"I am not tired,\" said Yump. \"It is only that my head aches and my face burns from the wind and the sun.\"  \"I will go forth,\" said Itch, \"and find a fisski, or drug-store, and get something for your face.\"  \"Stay where you are,\" said Yump. And Itch stayed.  Meantime Serge had gone upstairs with the fish and the duck and the cheese and the pudding. As he went up he thought. \"It is selfish to eat alone. I will give part of the fish to the others.\" And when he got a little further up the steps he thought, \"I will give them all of the fish.\" And when he got higher still he thought, \"They shall have everything.\"  Then he opened the door and came into the big room where the students were playing with matches at the big table and drinking golgol out of cups. \"Here is food, brothers,\" he said. \"Take it. I need none.\"  The students took the food and they cried, \"Rah, Rah,\" and beat the fish against the table. But the pudding they would not take. \"We have no axe,\" they said. \"Keep it.\"  Then they poured out golgol for Serge and said, \"Drink it.\"  But Serge would not.  \"I must work,\" he said, and all the students laughed. \"He wants to work!\" they cried. \"Rah, Rah.\"  But Serge went up to his room and lighted his taper, made of string dipped in fat, and set himself to study. \"I must work,\" he repeated.  So Serge sat at his books. It got later and the house grew still. The noise of the students below ceased and then everything was quiet.  Serge sat working through the night. Then presently it grew morning and the dark changed to twilight and Serge could see from his window the great building with the barred windows across the street standing out in the grey mist of the morning.  Serge had often studied thus through the night and when it was morning he would say, \"It is morning,\" and would go down and help Madame Vasselitch unbar the iron shutters and unchain the door, and remove the bolts from the window casement.  But on this morning as Serge looked from his window his eyes saw a figure behind the barred window opposite to him. It was the figure of a girl, and she was kneeling on the floor and she was in prayer, for Serge could see that her hands were before her face. And as he looked all his blood ran warm to his head, and his limbs trembled even though he could not see the girl's face. Then the girl rose from her knees and turned her face towards the bars, and Serge knew that it was Olga Ileyitch and that she had seen and known him.  Then he came down the stairs and Madame Vasselitch was there undoing the shutters and removing the nails from the window casing.  \"What have you seen, little son?\" she asked, and her voice was gentle, for the face of Serge was pale and his eyes were wide.  But Serge did not answer the question.  \"What is that house?\" he said. \"The great building with the bars that you call the house of the dead?\"  \"Shall I tell you, little son,\" said Madame Vasselitch, and she looked at him, still thinking. \"Yes,\" she said, \"he shall know.  \"It is the prison of the condemned, and from there they go forth only to die. Listen, little son,\" she went on, and she gripped Serge by the wrist till he could feel the bones of her fingers against his flesh. \"There lay my husband, Vangorod Vasselitch, waiting for his death. Months long he was there behind the bars and no one might see him or know when he was to die. I took this tall house that I might at least be near him till the end. But to those who lie there waiting for their death it is allowed once and once only that they may look out upon the world. And this is allowed to them the day before they die. So I took this house and waited, and each day I looked forth at dawn across the street and he was not there. Then at last he came. I saw him at the window and his face was pale and set and I could see the marks of the iron on his wrists as he held them to the bars. But I could see that his spirit was unbroken. There was no power in them to break that. Then he saw me at the window, and thus across the narrow street we said good-bye. It was only a moment. 'Sonia Vasselitch,' he said, 'do not forget,' and he was gone. I have not forgotten. I have lived on here in this dark house, and I have not forgotten. My sons--yes, little brother, my sons, I say--have not forgotten. Now tell me, Sergius Ivanovitch, what you have seen.\"  \"I have seen the woman that I love,\" said Serge, \"kneeling behind the bars in prayer. I have seen Olga Ileyitch.\"  \"Her name,\" said Madame Vasselitch, and there were no tears in her eyes and her voice was calm, \"her name is Olga Vasselitch. She is my daughter, and to-morrow she is to die.\"     CHAPTER IV  Madame Vasselitch took Serge by the hand.  \"Come,\" she said, \"you shall speak to my sons,\" and she led him down the stairs towards the room of Halfoff and Kwitoff.  \"They are my sons,\" she said. \"Olga is their sister. They are working to save her.\"  Then she opened the door. Halfoff and Kwitoff were working as Serge had seen them before, beside the crucible with the blue flame on their faces.  They had not slept.  Madame Vasselitch spoke.  \"He has seen Olga,\" she said. \"It is to-day.\"  \"We are too late,\" said Halfoff, and he groaned.  \"Courage, brother,\" said Kwitoff. \"She will not die till sunrise. It is twilight now. We have still an hour. Let us to work.\"  Serge looked at the brothers.  \"Tell me,\" he said. \"I do not understand.\"  Halfoff turned a moment from his work and looked at Serge.  \"Brother,\" he said, \"will you give your life?\"  \"Is it for Olga?\" asked Serge.  \"It is for her.\"  \"I give it gladly,\" said Serge.  \"Listen then,\" said Halfoff. \"Our sister is condemned for the killing of Popoff, inspector of police. She is in the prison of the condemned, the house of the dead, across the street. Her cell is there beside us. There is only a wall between. Look--\"  Halfoff as he spoke threw aside a curtain that hung across the end of the room. Serge looked into blackness. It was a tunnel.  \"It leads to the wall of her cell,\" said Halfoff. \"We are close against the wall but we cannot shatter it. We are working to make a bomb. No bomb that we can make is hard enough. We can only try once. If it fails the noise would ruin us. There is no second chance. We try our bombs in the crucible. They crumble. They have no strength. We are ignorant. We are only learning. We studied it in the books, the forbidden books. It took a month to learn to set the wires to fire the bomb. The tunnel was there. We did not have to dig it. It was for my father, Vangorod Vasselitch. He would not let them use it. He tapped a message through the wall, 'Keep it for a greater need.' Now it is his daughter that is there.\"  Halfoff paused. He was panting and his chest heaved. There was perspiration on his face and his black hair was wet.  \"Courage, little brother,\" said Kwitoff. \"She shall not die.\"  \"Listen,\" went on Halfoff. \"The bomb is made. It is there beside the crucible. It has power in it to shatter the prison. But the wires"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11504"],["title","Further Foolishness (#5)"],["body"," wrong. They do not work. There is no current in them. Something is wrong. We cannot explode the bomb.\"  \"Courage, courage,\" said Kwitoff, and his hands were busy among the wires before him. \"I am working still.\"  Serge looked at the brothers.  \"Is that the bomb?\" he said, pointing at a great ball of metal that lay beside the crucible.  \"It is,\" said Halfoff.  \"And the little fuse that is in the side of it fires it? And the current from the wires lights the fuse?\"  \"Yes,\" said Halfoff.  The two brothers looked at Serge, for there was a meaning in his voice and a strange look upon his face.  \"If the bomb is placed against the wall and if the fuse is lighted it would explode.\"  \"Yes,\" said Halfoff despairingly, \"but how? The fuse is instantaneous. Without the wires we cannot light it. It would be death.\"  Serge took the bomb in his hand. His face was pale.  \"Let it be so!\" he said. \"I will give my life for hers.\"  He lifted the bomb in his hand. \"I will go through the tunnel and hold the bomb against the wall and fire it,\" he said. \"Halfoff, light me the candle in the flame. Be ready when the wall falls.\"  \"No, no,\" said Halfoff, grasping Serge by the arm. \"You must not die!\"  \"My brother,\" said Kwitoff quietly, \"let it be as he says. It is for Russia!\"  But as Halfoff turned to light the candle in the flame there came a great knocking at the door above and the sound of many voices in the street.  All paused.  Madame Vasselitch laid her hand upon her lips.  Then there came the sound as of grounded muskets on the pavement of the street and a sharp word of command.  \"Soldiers!\" said Madame Vasselitch.  Kwitoff turned to his brother.  \"This is the end,\" he said. \"Explode the bomb here and let us die together.\"  Suddenly Madame Vasselitch gave a cry.  \"It is Olga's voice!\" she said.  She ran to the door and opened it, and a glad voice was heard crying.  \"It is I, Olga, and I am free!\"  \"Free,\" exclaimed the brothers.  All hastened up the stairs.  Olga was standing before them in the hall and beside her were the officers of the police, and in the street were the soldiers. The students from above had crowded down the stairs and with them were Itch, the serving man, and Yump, the cook.  \"I am free,\" cried Olga, \"liberated by the bounty of the Czar--Russia has declared war to fight for the freedom of the world and all the political prisoners are free.\"  \"Rah, rah!\" cried the students. \"War, war, war!\"  \"She is set free,\" said the officer who stood beside Olga. \"The charge of killing Popoff is withdrawn. No one will be punished for it now.\"  \"I never killed him,\" said Olga. \"I swear it,\" and she raised her hand.  \"You never killed him!\" exclaimed Serge with joy in his heart. \"You did not kill Popoff? But who did?\"  \"Defend us,\" said Yump, the cook. \"Since there is to be no punishment for it, I killed him myself.\"  \"You!\" they cried.  \"It is so,\" said Yump. \"I killed him beside the river. It was to defend my honour.\"  \"It was to defend her honour,\" cried the brothers. \"She has done well.\"  They clasped her hand.  \"You destroyed him with a bomb?\" they said.  \"No,\" said Yump, \"I sat down on him.\"  \"Rah, rah, rah,\" said the students.  There was silence for a moment. Then Kwitoff spoke.  \"Friends,\" he said, \"the new day is coming. The dawn is breaking. The moon is rising. The stars are setting. It is the birth of freedom. See! we need it not!\"--and as he spoke he grasped in his hands the bomb with its still unlighted fuse--\"Russia is free. We are all brothers now. Let us cast it at our enemies. Forward! To the frontier! Live the Czar.\"     Movies and Motors, Men and Women     IV. Madeline of the Movies: A Photoplay done     back into Words  EXPLANATORY NOTE.  In writing this I ought to explain that I am a tottering old man of forty-six. I was born too soon to understand moving pictures. They go too fast. I can't keep up. In my young days we used a magic lantern. It showed Robinson Crusoe in six scenes. It took all evening to show them. When it was done the hall was filled full with black smoke and the audience quite unstrung with excitement. What I set down here represents my thoughts as I sit in front of a moving picture photoplay and interpret it as best I can.  Flick, flick, flick! I guess it must be going to begin now, but it's queer the people don't stop talking: how can they expect to hear the pictures if they go on talking? Now it's off. PASSED BY THE BOARD OF--. Ah, this looks interesting--passed by the board of--wait till I adjust my spectacles and read what it--  It's gone. Never mind, here's something else, let me see--CAST OF CHARACTERS--Oh, yes--let's see who they are--MADELINE MEADOWLARK, a young something--EDWARD DANGERFIELD, a--a what? Ah, yes, a roo--at least, it's spelt r-o-u-e, that must be roo all right--but wait till I see what that is that's written across the top--MADELINE MEADOWLARK; OR, ALONE IN A GREAT CITY. I see, that's the title of it. I wonder which of the characters is alone. I guess not Madeline: she'd hardly be alone in a place like that. I imagine it's more likely Edward Dangerous the Roo. A roo would probably be alone a great deal, I should think. Let's see what the other characters are--JOHN HOLDFAST, a something. FARMER MEADOWLARK, MRS. MEADOWLARK, his Something--  Pshaw, I missed the others, but never mind; flick, flick, it's beginning--What's this? A bedroom, eh? Looks like a girl's bedroom--pretty poor sort of place. I wish the picture would keep still a minute--in Robinson Crusoe it all stayed still and one could sit and look at it, the blue sea and the green palm trees and the black footprints in the yellow sand--but this blamed thing keeps rippling and flickering all the time--Ha! there's the girl herself--come into her bedroom. My! I hope she doesn't start to undress in it--that would be fearfully uncomfortable with all these people here. No, she's not undressing--she's gone and opened the cupboard. What's that she's doing--taking out a milk jug and a glass--empty, eh? I guess it must be, because she seemed to hold it upside down. Now she's picked up a sugar bowl--empty, too, eh?--and a cake tin, and that's empty--What on earth does she take them all out for if they're empty? Why can't she speak? I think--hullo--who's this coming in? Pretty hard-looking sort of woman--what's she got in her hand?--some sort of paper, I guess--she looks like a landlady, I shouldn't wonder if--  Flick, flick! Say! Look there on the screen:     \"YOU OWE ME     THREE WEEKS' RENT.\"  Oh, I catch on! that's what the landlady says, eh? Say! That's a mighty smart way to indicate it isn't it? I was on to that in a minute--flick, flick--hullo, the landlady's vanished--what's the girl doing now--say, she's praying! Look at her face! Doesn't she look religious, eh?  Flick, flick!  Oh, look, they've put her face, all by itself, on the screen. My! what a big face she's got when you see it like that.  She's in her room again--she's taking off her jacket--by Gee! She _is_ going to bed! Here, stop the machine; it doesn't seem--Flick, flick!  Well, look at that! She's in bed, all in one flick, and fast asleep! Something must have broken in the machine and missed out a chunk. There! she's asleep all right--looks as if she was dreaming. Now it's sort of fading. I wonder how they make it do that? I guess they turn the wick of the lamp down low: that was the way in Robinson Crusoe--Flick, flick!  Hullo! where on earth is this--farmhouse, I guess--must be away upstate somewhere--who on earth are these people? Old man--white whiskers--old lady at a spinning-wheel--see it go, eh? Just like real! And a young man--that must be John Holdfast--and a girl with her hand in his. Why! Say! it's the girl, the same girl, Madeline--only what's she doing away off here at this farm--how did she get clean back from the bedroom to this farm? Flick, flick! what's this?    \"NO, JOHN, I CANNOT MARRY YOU.    I MUST DEVOTE MY LIFE    TO MY MUSIC.\"  Who says that? What music? Here, stop--  It's all gone. What's this new place? Flick, flick, looks like a street. Say! see the street car coming along--well! say! isn't that great? A street car! And here's Madeline! How on earth did she get back from the old farm all in a second? Got her street things on--that must be music under her arm--I wonder where--hullo--who's this man in a silk hat and swell coat? Gee! he's well dressed. See him roll his eyes at Madeline! He's lifting his hat--I guess he must be Edward Something, the Roo--only a roo would dress as well as he does--he's going to speak to her--     \"SIR, I DO NOT KNOW YOU.     LET ME PASS.\"  Oh, I see! The Roo mistook her; he thought she was somebody that he knew! And she wasn't! I catch on! It gets easy to understand these pictures once you're on.  Flick, flick--Oh, say, stop! I missed a piece--where is she? Outside a street door--she's pausing a moment outside--that was lucky her pausing like that--it just gave me time to read EMPLOYMENT BUREAU on the door. Gee! I read it quick.  Flick, flick! Where is it now?--oh, I see, she's gone in--she's in there--this must be the Bureau, eh? There's Madeline going up to the desk.    \"NO, WE HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE,    WE HAVE NOTHING ...\"  Pshaw! I read too slow--she's on the street again. Flick, flick!  No, she isn't--she's back in her room--cupboard still empty--no milk--no sugar--Flick, flick!  Kneeling down to pray--my! but she's religious--flick, flick--now she's on the street--got a letter in her hand--what's the address--Flick, flick!     Mr. Meadowlark    Meadow Farm    Meadow County    New York  Gee! They've put it right on the screen! The whole letter! Flick, flick--here's Madeline again on the street with the letter still in her hand--she's gone to a letter-box with it--why doesn't she post it? What's stopping her?    \"I CANNOT TELL THEM    OF MY FAILURE.    IT WOULD BREAK THEIR ...\"  Break their what? They slide these things along altogether too quick--anyway, she won't post it--I see--she's"]]]
