Christmas at least brings the children's truce, and that is something to be thankful for, but it is not the Christmas that we knew and long for:  ON EARTH--PEACE    No stir of wings sweeps softly by;     No angel comes with blinding light;   Beneath the wild and wintry sky     No shepherds watch their flocks to-night.    In the dull thunder of the wind     We hear the cruel guns afar,   But in the glowering heavens we find     No guiding, solitary star.    But lo! on this our Lord's birthday,     Lit by the glory whence she came,   Peace, like a warrior, stands at bay,     A swift, defiant, living flame!    Full-armed she stands in shining mail,     Erect, serene, unfaltering still,   Shod with a strength that cannot fail,     Strong with a fierce o'ermastering will.    Where shattered homes and ruins be     She fights through dark and desperate days;   Beside the watchers on the sea     She guards the Channel's narrow ways.    Through iron hail and shattering shell,     Where the dull earth is stained with red,   Fearless she fronts the gates of Hell     And shields the unforgotten dead.    So stands she, with her all at stake,     And battles for her own dear life,   That by one victory she may make     For evermore an end of strife.  [Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S PEACE  PEACE: \"I'm glad that they, at least, have their Christmas unspoiled.\"]  Yet we have our minor war gains in the temporary disappearance of cranks and faddists, some of whom have sunk without a ripple. And though the Press Censor's suppressions and delays and inconsistencies provoke discontent in the House and out of it, food for mirth turns up constantly in unexpected quarters. The Crown Prince tells an American interviewer that there is no War Party in Germany, nor has there ever been. The German General Staff have begun to disguise set-backs under the convenient euphemism that the situation has developed \"according to expectation.\" An English village worthy, discussing the prospects of invasion, comes to the reassuring conclusion that \"there can't be no battle in these parts, Jarge, for there bain't no field suitable, as you may say; an' Squire, 'e won't lend 'em the use of 'is park.\" The troubles of neutrality are neatly summed up in a paper in a recent geography examination. \"Holland is a low country, in fact it is such a very low country that it is no wonder that it is dammed all round.\"  The trials of mistresses on the home front are happily described in the reply of a child to a small visitor who inquired after her mother. \"Thank you, poor mummie's a bit below herself this morning--what with the cook and the Kaiser.\"  [Illustration:  POMPOUS LADY: \"I shall descend at Knightsbridge.\"  TOMMY (aside): \"Takes 'erself for a bloomin' Zeppelin!\"]  We have to thank an ingenious correspondent for drawing up the following \"credibility index\" for the guidance of perplexed newspaper readers:    London, Paris, or Petrograd (official)                100     \"       \"          \"      (semi-official)            50   Berlin (official)                                      25   It is believed in military circles here that--         24   A correspondent that has just returned from the     firing-line tells me that--                          18   Our correspondent at Rome announces that--             11   Berlin (unofficial)                                    10   I learn from a neutral merchant that--                  7   A story is current in Venice to the effect that--       5   It is rumoured that--                                   4   I have heard to-day from a reliable source that--       3   I learn on unassailable authority that--                2   It is rumoured in Rotterdam that--                      1   Wolff's Bureau states that--                            0    _January, 1915_.   General von Kluck \"never got round on the right.\" Calais is Calais still, and the Kaiser, if he still wishes to give it a new name, may call it the \"Never, Never Land.\" \"General Janvier\" is doing his worst, but our men are sticking it out through slush and slime. As for the Christmas truce and fraternisation, the British officer who ended a situation that was proving impossible by presenting a dingy Saxon with a copy of _Punch_ in exchange for a packet of cigarettes, acted with a wise candour:    For there he found, our dingy friend,     Amid the trench's sobering slosh,   What must have left him, by the end,     A wiser, if a sadder, Boche,   Seeing himself, with chastened mien,   In that pellucid well of Truth serene.  There can be no \"fraternising\" with Fritz until he realises that he has been fooled by his War Lords; and his awakening is a long way off. Lord Kitchener has been charged with being \"very economical in his information\" vouchsafed to the Lords, but it is well to be rid of illusions. This has not been a month of great events. General Joffre is content with this ceaseless \"nibbling.\" The Kaiser, nourished by the flattery of his tame professors, encourages the war on non-combatants.  The Turks are beginning to show a gift for euphemism in disguising their reverses in the Caucasus, which shows that they have nothing to learn from their masters; Austria, badly mauled by the Serbians, addresses awful threats to Roumania; and the United States has issued a warning Note on neutral trading. But the American Eagle is not the Eagle that we are up against.  [Illustration: THE FLIGHT THAT FAILED  THE EMPEROR: \"What! No babes, Sirrah?\"  THE MURDERER: \"Alas, Sire, none.\"  THE EMPEROR: \"Well, then, no babes, no iron crosses.\"  (_Exit murderer, discouraged_.)]   The number of Mr. Punch's correspondents on active service steadily grows. Some of them are at the Western front; others are still straining at the leash at home; another of the _Punch_ brigade, with the very first battalion of Territorials to land in India, has begun to send his impressions of the shiny land; of friendly natives and unfriendly ants; of the disappointment of being relegated to clerical duties instead of going to the front; of the evaporation of visions of military glory in the routine of typing, telephoning and telegraphing; of leisurely Oriental methods. Being a soldier clerk in India is very different from being a civilian clerk in England. Patience, good Territorials in India, your time will come.  [Illustration: THE SHIRKERS' WAR NEWS  \"There! What did I tell you? Northdown Lambs beaten--two to nothing.\"]  At home, though the \"knut\" has been commandeered and nobly transmogrified, though women are increasingly occupied in war work and entering with devotion and self-sacrifice on their new duties as substitutes for men, we have not yet been wholly purged of levity and selfishness. Football news has not receded into its true perspective; shirkers are more pre-occupied with the defeat or victory of \"Lambs\" or \"Wolves\" in Lancashire than with the stubborn defence, the infinite discomfort and the heavy losses of their brothers in Flanders.  Overdressed fashionables pester wounded officers and men with their unreasonable visits and futile queries. The enemies in our midst are not all aliens; there are not a few natives we should like to see interned.  The Kaiser has had his first War birthday and, as the Prussian Government has ordered that there shall be no public celebrations, this confirms the rumours that he now wishes he had never been born.  Germany, says the _Cologne Gazette_ in an article on the food question, \"has still at hand a very large supply of pigs\"--even after the enormous number she has exported to Belgium. Germany, however, does not only export pigs; her trade in \"canards\" with neutrals grows and grows, chiefly with the United States, thanks to the untiring mendacity of Bernstorff and Wolff. Compared with these efforts, the revelations of English governesses at German courts, which are now finding their way into print, make but a poor show.  As the British armies increase, the moustache of the British officer, one of the most astonishing products of these astonishing times, grows \"small by degrees and beautifully less.\" Waxed ends, fashionable in a previous generation, are now only worn by policemen, taxi-drivers and labour leaders. The Kaiser remains faithful to the Mephistophelean form. But in proof of his desire to make the best of both worlds, nether and celestial, he continues to commandeer \"Gott\" on every occasion as his second in command. Out-Heroding Herod as a murderer of innocents, he enters into a competition of piety with his grandfather. For we should not forget that the first German Emperor's messages to his wife in the Franco-Prussian War were once summed up by Mr. Punch:    Ten thousand French have gone below;   Praise God from Whom all blessings flow.    _February, 1915_.   January ended with a knock for the Germans off the Dogger Bank, when the _Blücher_ was sunk by our Battle-Cruiser Squadron:    They say the _Lion_ and the _Tiger_ sweep   Where once the Huns shelled babies from the deep,   And _Blücher_, that great cruiser--12-inch guns   Roar o'er his head, but cannot break his sleep.  And now it is the turn of \"Johnny Turk,\" who has had _his_ knock on the Suez Canal, and failed to solve the _Riddle of the Sands_ under German guidance. Having safely locked up his High Seas Fleet in the Kiel Canal, the Kaiser has ordered the U-boat blockade of England to begin by the torpedoing of neutral as well as enemy merchant ships.  You may know a man by the company he keeps, and the Kaiser's friends are now the Jolly Roger and Sir Roger Casement.  Valentine's Day has come and gone. Here are some lines from a damp but undefeated lover in the trenches:    Though the glittering knight whose charger     Bore him on his lady's quest   With an infinitely larger     Share of warfare's pomp was blest,   Yet he offered love no higher,     No more difficult to quench,   Than the filthy occupier     Of this unromantic trench.

The old Universities are now given up to a handful of coloured students, Rhodes' scholars and reluctant crocks. As a set-off, however, a Swansea clergyman and football enthusiast has held a \"thanksgiving service for their good fortune against Newcastle United.\" Meanwhile, the Under-Secretary for War has stated that the army costs more in a week than the total estimates for the Waterloo campaign, and that our casualties on the Western front alone have amounted to over 100,000. So what with submarine losses, ubiquitous German spies, the German propaganda in America, and complaints of Government inactivity, the pessimists are having a fine time. Tommy grouses of course, but then he complains far more of the loss of a packet of cigarettes or a tin of peppermints or a mouth-organ than of the loss of a limb.  Germany's attitude towards the United States tempers the blandishments of the serenader with the occasional discharge of half-bricks. There is no such inconsistency in the expression of her feelings about England. Articles entitled \"_Unser Hass gegen England_\" constantly appear in the German Press, and people are beginning to wonder whether the _Hass_ is not the Kaiser. Apropos of newspapers, we are beginning to harbour a certain envy of the Americans. Even their provincial organs often contain important and cheering news of the doings of the British Army many days before the Censor releases the information in England. Daylight saving is again being talked of, and it would surely be an enormous boon to rush the measure through now so that the Germans may have less darkness of which to take advantage. And there is a general and reasonable feeling that more use should be made of bands for recruiting. The ways of German musicians are perplexing. Here is the amiable Herr Humperdinck, composer of \"Hänsel and Gretel,\" the very embodiment of the old German kindliness, signing the Manifesto of patriotic artists and professors who execrate England, while Strauss, the truculent \"Mad Mullah\" of the Art, holds aloof. Dr. Hans Richter, who enjoyed English hospitality so long, now clamours for our extinction; it is even said that he has asked to be allowed to conduct a _Parsifal_ airship to this country.  [Illustration: STUDY OF A PRUSSIAN HOUSEHOLD HAVING ITS MORNING HATE]    _March, 1915._   A new and possibly momentous chapter has opened in the history of the War by the attempt to force the Dardanelles. At the end of February the Allied Fleet bombarded the forts at the entrance, and landed a party of bluejackets. Since then these naval operations have been resumed, and our new crack battleship _Queen Elizabeth_ has joined in the attack. We have not got through the Narrows, and some sceptical critics are asking what we should do if we got through to Constantinople, without a land force. It is a great scheme, if it comes off; and the \"only begetter\" of it, if report is true, is Mr. Winston Churchill, the strategist of the Antwerp expedition, who now aspires to be the Dardanelson of our age. Anyhow, the Sultan, lured on by the Imperial William o' the Wisp, is already capable of envying even his predecessor:    Abdul! I would that I had shared your plight,     Or Europe seen my heels,   Before the hour when Allah bound me tight     To WILLIAM'S chariot-wheels!  Germany, always generous with other people's property, has begun to hint to Italy possibilities of compensation in the shape of certain portions of Austro-Hungarian territory. She has also declared that she is \"fighting for the independence of the small nations,\" including, of course, Belgium. In further evidence of her humanity she has taken to spraying our soldiers in the West with flaming petrol and squirting boiling pitch over our Russian allies. It is positively a desecration of the word devil to apply it to the Germans whether on land, on or under water, or in the air.  We have begun to \"push\" on the Western front, and Neuve Chapelle has been captured, after a fierce battle and at terrible cost. Air raids are becoming common in East Anglia and U-boats unpleasantly active in the North Sea. Let us take off our hats to the mine-sweepers and trawlers, the new and splendid auxiliaries of the Royal Navy. Grimsby is indeed a \"name to resound for ages\" for what its fishermen have done and are doing in the war against mine and submarine:    Soles in the Silver Pit--an' there we'll let 'em lie;   Cod on the Dogger--oh, we'll fetch 'em by an' by;   War on the water--an' it's time to serve an' die,     For there's wild work doin' on the North Sea ground.   An' it's \"Wake up, Johnnie!\" they want you at the trawlin'   (With your long sea-boots and your tarry old tarpaulin);   All across the bitter seas duty comes a-callin'     In the Winter's weather off the North Sea ground.   It's well we've learned to laugh at fear--the sea has taught us how;   It's well we've shaken hands with death--we'll not be strangers now,   With death in every climbin' wave before the trawler's bow,     An' the black spawn swimmin' on the North Sea ground.  [Illustration: WILLIAM O' THE WISP]  These brave men and their heroic brothers in the trenches are true sportsmen as well as patriots, not those who interpret the need of lightheartedness by the cult of \"sport as usual\" on the football field and the racecourse. And the example of the Universities shines with the same splendour. Of the scanty remnant that remain at Oxford and Cambridge all the physically fit have joined the O.T.C. Boat-race day has passed, but the crews are gone to \"keep it long\" and \"pull it through\" elsewhere:    Not here their hour of great emprise;     No mounting cheer towards Mortlake roars;   Lulled to full tide the river lies     Unfretted by the fighting oars;   The long high toil of strenuous play     Serves England elsewhere well to-day.  London changes daily. The sight of the female Jehu is becoming familiar; the lake in St. James's Park has been drained and the water-fowl driven to form a concentration camp by the sorry pool that remains beside the Whitehall Gate.  Spy-hunting is prevalent in East Anglia, but the amateurs have not achieved any convincing results. Spring poets are suffering from suspended animation; there is a slump in crocuses, snowdrops, daffodils and lambkins. Their \"musings always turn away to men who're arming for the fray.\" The clarion and the fife have ousted the pastoral ode. And our military and naval experts, harassed by the Censor, take refuge in psychology.  The _Kölnische Zeitung_ has published a whole article on \"Mr. Punch.\" The writer, a Herr Professor, finds our cartoons lacking in \"modest refinement.\" Indeed, he goes so far as to say that the treatment of the Kaiser savours of blasphemy. One is so apt to forget that the Kaiser is a divinity, so prone to remember that Luther wrote, \"We Germans are Germans, and Germans we will remain--that is to say, pigs and brutish animals.\" This was written in 1528: but \"the example of the Middle Ages\" is held up to-day by German leaders as the true fount of inspiration.  [Illustration: THE WAR SPIRIT AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM  ARDENT EGYPTOLOGIST (who has lately joined the Civic Guard): \"No, I seem to have lost my enthusiasm for this group since I noticed Bes-Hathor-Horus was out of step with the other two.\"]    _April_, 1915.   A hundred years ago Bismarck was born on April 1, the man who built with blood and iron, but now only the blood remains. Yet one may doubt whether even that strong and ruthless pilot would have commended the submarine crew who sank the liner _Falaba_ and laughed at the cries and struggles of drowning men and women. Sooner or later these crews are doomed to die the death of rats:    But you, who sent them out to do this shame;     From whom they take their orders and their pay;   For you--avenging wrath defers its claim,     And Justice bides her day.  The tide of \"frightfulness\" rolls strong on land as on sea. The second battle of Ypres has begun and the enemy has resorted to the use of a new weapon--poison gas. He had already poisoned wells in South West Africa, but this is an uglier outcome of the harnessing of science to the Powers of Darkness. Italy grows restive in spite of the blandishments of Prince Bülow, and as the month closes we hear of the landing of the Allies in Gallipoli, just two months after the unsupported naval attempt to force the Dardanelles. British and Australian and New Zealand troops have achieved the impossible by incredible valour in face of murderous fire, and a foothold has been won at tremendous cost of heroic lives. Letters from the Western front continue cheerful, but it does not need much reading between the lines to realise the odds with which our officers and men have to contend, the endless discomfort and unending din. They are masters of a gallant art of metaphor which belittles the most appalling horrors of trench warfare; masters, too, of the art of extracting humorous relief from the most trivial incidents.  On the home front we have to contend with a dangerous ally of the enemy in Drink, and with the self-advertising politicians who do their bit by asking unnecessary questions. Sometimes, but rarely, they succeed in eliciting valuable information, as in Mr. Lloyd George's statement on the situation at the front. We have now six times as many men in the field as formed the original Expeditionary Force, and in the few days fighting round Neuve Chapelle almost as much ammunition was expended by our guns as in the whole of the two and three-quarter years of the Boer War.
