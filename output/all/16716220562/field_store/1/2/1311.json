Three out of four times the stranger would be arrested and ordered back to Brussels, and our despatches, with their news value departed, would be returned.  An account of the Germans entering Brussels I sent by an English boy named Dalton, who, after being turned back three times, got through by night, and when he arrived in England his adventures were published in all the London papers. They were so thrilling that they made my story, for which he had taken the trip, extremely tame reading.  Hugh Gibson, secretary of the American legation, was the first person in an official position to visit Antwerp after the Belgian Government moved to that city, and, even with his passes and flag flying from his automobile, he reached Antwerp and returned to Brussels only after many delays and adventures. Not knowing the Belgians were advancing from the north, Gibson and his American flag were several times under fire, and on the days he chose for his excursion his route led him past burning towns and dead and wounded and between the lines of both forces actively engaged.  He was carrying despatches from Brand Whitlock to Secretary Bryan. During the night he rested at Antwerp the first Zeppelin air-ship to visit that city passed over it, dropping one bomb at the end of the block in which Gibson was sleeping. He was awakened by the explosion and heard all of those that followed.  The next morning he was requested to accompany a committee appointed by the Belgian Government to report upon the outrage, and he visited a house that had been wrecked, and saw what was left of the bodies of those killed. People who were in the streets when the air-ship passed said it moved without any sound, as though the motor had been shut off and it was being propelled by momentum.  One bomb fell so near the palace where the Belgian Queen was sleeping as to destroy the glass in the windows and scar the walls. The bombs were large, containing smaller bombs of the size of shrapnel. Like shrapnel, on impact they scattered bullets over a radius of forty yards. One man, who from a window in the eighth story of a hotel watched the air-ship pass, stated that before each bomb fell he saw electric torches signal from the roofs, as though giving directions as to where the bombs should strike.  After my arrest by the Germans, I found my usefulness in Brussels as a correspondent was gone, and I returned to London, and from there rejoined the Allies in Paris.  I left Brussels on August 27th with Gerald Morgan and Will Irwin, of Collier's, on a train carrying English prisoners and German wounded. In times of peace the trip to the German border lasts three hours, but in making it we were twenty-six hours, and by order of the authorities we were forbidden to leave the train.  Carriages with cushions naturally were reserved for the wounded, so we slept on wooden benches and on the floor. It was not possible to obtain food, and water was as scarce. At Graesbeek, ten miles from Brussels, we first saw houses on fire. They continued with us to Liege.  Village after village had been completely wrecked. In his march to the sea Sherman lived on the country. He did not destroy it, and as against the burning of Columbia must be placed to the discredit of the Germans the wiping out of an entire countryside.  For many miles we saw procession after procession of peasants fleeing from one burning village, which had been their home, to other villages, to find only blackened walls and smouldering ashes. In no part of northern Europe is there a countryside fairer than that between Aix-la-Chapelle and Brussels, but the Germans had made of it a graveyard. It looked as though a cyclone had uprooted its houses, gardens, and orchards and a prairie fire had followed.  At seven o'clock in the evening we arrived at what for six hundred years had been the city of Louvain. The Germans were burning it, and to hide their work kept us locked in the railroad carriages. But the story was written against the sky, was told to us by German soldiers incoherent with excesses; and we could read it in the faces of women and children being led to concentration camps and of citizens on their way to be shot.  The day before the Germans had sentenced Louvain to become a wilderness, and with German system and love of thoroughness they left Louvain an empty, blackened shell. The reason for this appeal to the torch and the execution of non-combatants, as given to Mr. Whitlock and myself on the morning I left Brussels by General von Lutwitz, the military governor, was this: The day before, while the German military commander of the troops in Louvain was at the Hôtel de Ville talking to the burgomaster, a son of the burgomaster, with an automatic pistol, shot the chief of staff and German staff surgeons.  Lutwitz claimed this was the signal for the civil guard, in civilian clothes on the roofs, to fire upon the German soldiers in the open square below. He said also the Belgians had quick-firing guns, brought from Antwerp. As for a week the Germans had occupied Louvain and closely guarded all approaches, the story that there was any gun-running is absurd.  \"Fifty Germans were killed and wounded,\" said Lutwitz, \"and for that Louvain must be wiped out--so!\" In pantomime with his fist he swept the papers across his table.  \"The Hôtel de Ville,\" he added, \"was a beautiful building; it is a pity it must be destroyed.\"  Were he telling us his soldiers had destroyed a kitchen-garden, his tone could not have expressed less regret.  Ten days before I had been in Louvain, when it was occupied by Belgian troops and King Albert and his staff. The city dates from the eleventh century, and the population was forty-two thousand. The citizens were brewers, lace-makers, and manufacturers of ornaments for churches. The university once was the most celebrated in European cities and was the headquarters of the Jesuits.  In the Louvain College many priests now in America have been educated, and ten days before, over the great yellow walls of the college, I had seen hanging two American flags. I had found the city clean, sleepy, and pretty, with narrow, twisting streets and smart shops and cafés. Set in flower gardens were the houses, with red roofs, green shutters, and white walls.  Over those that faced south had been trained pear-trees, their branches, heavy with fruit, spread out against the walls like branches of candelabra. The town hall was an example of Gothic architecture, in detail and design more celebrated even than the town hall of Bruges or Brussels. It was five hundred years old, and lately had been repaired with taste and at great cost.  Opposite was the Church of St. Pierre, dating from the fifteenth century, a very noble building, with many chapels filled with carvings of the time of the Renaissance in wood, stone, and iron. In the university were one hundred and fifty thousand volumes.  Near it was the bronze statue of Father Damien, priest of the leper colony in the South Pacific, of whom Robert Louis Stevenson wrote.  On the night of the 27th these buildings were empty, exploded cartridges. Statues, pictures, carvings, parchments, archives--all these were gone.  No one defends the sniper. But because ignorant Mexicans, when their city was invaded, fired upon our sailors, we did not destroy Vera Cruz. Even had we bombarded Vera Cruz, money could have restored that city. Money can never restore Louvain. Great architects and artists, dead these six hundred years, made it beautiful, and their handiwork belonged to the world. With torch and dynamite the Germans turned those masterpieces into ashes, and all the Kaiser's horses and all his men cannot bring them back again.  When our troop train reached Louvain, the entire heart of the city was destroyed, and the fire had reached the Boulevard Tirlemont, which faces the railroad station. The night was windless, and the sparks rose in steady, leisurely pillars, falling back into the furnace from which they sprang. In their work the soldiers were moving from the heart of the city to the outskirts, street by street, from house to house.  In each building they began at the first floor and, when that was burning steadily, passed to the one next. There were no exceptions-- whether it was a store, chapel, or private residence, it was destroyed. The occupants had been warned to go, and in each deserted shop or house the furniture was piled, the torch was stuck under it, and into the air went the savings of years, souvenirs of children, of parents, heirlooms that had passed from generation to generation.  The people had time only to fill a pillowcase and fly. Some were not so fortunate, and by thousands, like flocks of sheep, they were rounded up and marched through the night to concentration camps. We were not allowed to speak to any citizen of Louvain, but the Germans crowded the windows of the train, boastful, gloating, eager to interpret.  In the two hours during which the train circled the burning city war was before us in its most hateful aspect.  In other wars I have watched men on one hilltop, without haste, without heat, fire at men on another hill, and in consequence on both sides good men were wasted. But in those fights there were no women or children, and the shells struck only vacant stretches of veldt or uninhabited mountain sides.  At Louvain it was war upon the defenceless, war upon churches, colleges, shops of milliners and lace-makers; war brought to the bedside and the fireside; against women harvesting in the fields, against children in wooden shoes at play in the streets.  At Louvain that night the Germans were like men after an orgy.  There were fifty English prisoners, erect and soldierly. In the ocean of gray the little patch of khaki looked pitifully lonely, but they regarded the men who had outnumbered but not defeated them with calm, uncurious eyes. In one way I was glad to see them there. Later they will bear witness.

To attempt to stimulate spontaneous conversation, even on simple subjects, without the aid of a French model, not only is hazardous but often becomes aimless, and at best results in the acquisition of a limited vocabulary. Furthermore, it requires a skilful teacher to adapt to such purposes the substance of a text prepared with a totally different end in view.  The author, in the course of five years' experience with conversation classes in the University of Michigan, had difficulty in finding material for this work in a form that was adapted peculiarly to his needs. Plays and anecdotes were found to yield the best results.  Another need is that of books offering a systematic review of the first year's work. In every class will be found a certain per cent of students who translate readily but who have only a hazy notion as to the practical application of some of the most fundamental principles of the grammar.  It is hoped that this book will help to fill the two needs above referred to. The anecdotes have been selected from a large number used by the author in conversational classes and drawn from a great variety of sources, many of which will be readily recognized. He is in a number of cases indebted to Claude Augé's excellent grammar. Most of the anecdotes have been adapted to the author's purpose of illustrating grammatical principles. Questionnaires have been inserted.  In the preparation of the _vocabulaire_, the Petit Larousse and Hatzfeld-Darmesteter dictionaries have been freely consulted. Students will at first require some aid and encouragement from the teacher, in the use of the all-French vocabulary; but they can be made, in a surprisingly short time, to form the habit of using a French dictionary by preference, and of doing a large part of their thinking in French.  It is suggested that the book be used on certain days of the week only, to supplement the student's reading texts, and provide the sort of exercise indicated by its title. It is not intended as a reader.  The author's thanks are due to his former colleague, Professor Hugo P. Thieme, of the University of Michigan, for many helpful suggestions and criticisms, as well as to Professor René Talamon, of the same institution, who kindly assisted in reading the proof.

L'HONNÊTETÉ RÉCOMPENSÉE  Le grand Molière donna une fois, par erreur, un louis d'or à un mendiant tout déguenillé, qui lui avait demandé l'aumône. Le pauvre homme, en s'éloignant, s'aperçoit de l'erreur et court aussitôt après Molière. \"Vous vous êtes trompé, lui dit-il: vous m'avez donné un louis d'or au lieu d'un sou.\" Molière, étonné, lui dit de le garder, et lui en donna un autre pour le récompenser de sa probité, en s'écriant: \"Où l'honnêteté va-t-elle se nicher?\"   Quelle erreur Molière a-t-il faite un jour?--Le mendiant s'en est-il douté?--A-t-il agi selon les principes acceptés de la généralité des hommes?--Molière a-t-il été touché de ce trait de probité?--Quelle récompense a-t-il accordée à ce phénix des honnêtes hommes?--Les hommes sont-ils d'ordinaire si honnêtes?  Racontez cette anecdote en cent mots.   2. LA VISITE RENDUE  Le nom de Voltaire est universellement connu. Il n'en est pas tout à fait de même de son ami Piron; toutefois suffira-t-il de dire qu'il a été l'auteur d'un grand nombre de satires et de chansons spirituelles, quoique licencieuses.  Une fois Voltaire et Piron étaient allés passer quelque temps dans un château. Un jour Piron écrivit sur la porte de Voltaire le mot Coquin. Sitôt que Voltaire le vit, il se rendit chez Piron, qui lui dit: \"Quel hasard me procure l'avantage de vous voir?--Monsieur, lui répondit Voltaire, j'ai vu votre nom sur ma porte, et je m'empresse de vous rendre ma visite.\"   À quel titre le nom de Voltaire est-it célèbre?--Le nom de Piron est-il aussi connu que celui du philosophe?--Dans quel genre a-t-il montré du mérite?--Où séjournaient les deux auteurs?--Quel tour Piron a-t-il joué à Voltaire?--Qu'est-ce que celui-ci a fait sur-le-champ?  Faites ce récit de mémoire.   3. LE DOMINO JAUNE  Sous Louis XVI, à l'occasion de la naissance du dauphin, une grande fête fut donnée à Versailles, et l'histoire anecdotique du règne a attaché un plaisant souvenir au bal qui la termina. Un buffet, orné superbement, offrait aux danseurs une collation apprêtée avec une royale magnificence. Les regards des spectateurs furent bientôt attirés sur une personne de haute taille, couverte d'un domino jaune, que trois ou quatre fois déjà on avait vue s'approcher du buffet. Douée d'un appétit de Gargantua, et brûlée sans doute d'une soif inextinguible, elle mangeait et buvait d'une façon prodigieuse.  La surprise se trouva changée en stupéfaction, lorsqu'on aperçut le domino jaune attablé pour la cinquième fois, et que les mets eurent recommencé à disparaître dans son estomac insatiable. On se demandait: \"Quel est donc ce masque à l'appétit si prodigieux?\" Et les vieux courtisans se disaient entre eux: \"Les plus grands mangeurs que nous ayons[1] entendu vanter n'approchaient pas de celui-ci.\" Informations prises, il se trouva que les gardes françaises préposées à la garde du château avaient imaginé la plaisanterie suivante: le déguisement était revêtu à tour de rôle par chacun de ces espiègles soldats, et ils participaient ainsi aux joies de la fête. Instruite de cette mascarade amusante, la reine en rit beaucoup. Les officiers furent priés de fermer les yeux sur cette escapade, et les ordonnateurs du bal invités à veiller au renouvellement ininterrompu des provisions du buffet.  [Footnote 1: Why subjunctive?]   Sous quel règne a-t-on donné cette fête, et à quelle occasion?--Qu'est-ce que le buffet offrait aux danseurs?--Qui est-ce qui a attiré les regards des spectateurs?--De quoi cette personne était-elle couverte?--De quel meuble s'est-elle approchée?--Était-elle douée d'un grand appétit?--Comment mangeait-elle?--Qu'est-ce que les spectateurs se demandaient enfin?--Gargantua aurait-il approché du gourmand du bal?--Qui avait été préposé à la garde du château?--Quelle plaisanterie avait-on imaginée pour participer aux joies de la fête?--La reine a-t-elle ri de la mascarade?--A-t-on continué de veiller au renouvellement des provisions du buffet?
