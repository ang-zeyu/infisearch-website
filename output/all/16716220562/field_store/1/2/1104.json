His genius, ever for th' event prepared,   Rose with the storm, and all its dangers shared.  Falconer, _The Shipwreck_, i. 2 (1756).  _Albert_, father of Gertrude, patriarch and judge of Wyo'ming (called by Campbell Wy'oming). Both Albert and his daughter were shot by a mixed force of British and Indian troops, led by one Brandt, who made an attack on the settlement, put all the inhabitants to the sword, set fire to the fort, and destroyed all the houses.--Campbell, _Gertrude of Wyoming_ (1809).  _Albert_, in Goethe's romance called _The Sorrows of Werther_, is meant for his friend Kestner. He is a young German farmer, who married Charlotte Buff (called \"Lotte\" in the novel), with whom Goethe was in love. Goethe represents himself under the name of Werther (_q. v._).  ALBERT OF GEI'ERSTEIN (_Count_), brother of Arnold Biederman, and president of the \"Secret Tribunal.\" He sometimes appears as a \"black priest of St. Paul's,\" and sometimes as the \"monk of St. Victoire.\"--Sir W. Scott, _Anne of Geierstein_ (time, Edward IV.).  ALBERTAZ'ZO married Alda, daughter of Otho, duke of Saxony. His sons were Ugo and Fulco. From this stem springs the Royal Family of England.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).  ALBIA'ZAR, an Arab chief, who joins the Egyptian armament against the crusaders.  A chief in rapine, not in knighthood bred. Tasso, _Jerusalem Delivered_, xvii. (1575).  AL'BION. In legendary history this word is variously accounted for. One derivation is from Albion, a giant, son of Neptune, its first discoverer, who ruled over the island for forty-four years.  Another derivation is Al'bia, eldest of the fifty daughters of Diocle'sian king of Syria. These fifty ladies all married on the same day, and all murdered their husbands on the wedding night. By way of punishment, they were cast adrift in a ship, unmanned, but the wind drove the vessel to our coast, where these Syrian damsels disembarked. Here they lived the rest of their lives, and married with the aborigines, \"a lawless crew of devils.\" Milton mentions this legend, and naïvely adds, \"it is too absurd and unconscionably gross to be believed.\" Its resemblance to the fifty daughters of Dan'aos is palpable.  Drayton, in his _Polyolbion_, says that Albion came from Rome, was \"the first martyr of the land,\" and dying for the faith's sake, left his name to the country, where Offa subsequently reared to him \"a rich and sumptuous shrine, with a monastery attached.\"--Song xvi.  _Albion_, king of Briton, when O'beron held his court in what is now called \"Kensington Gardens.\" T. Tickell has a poem upon this subject.  _Albion wars with Jove's Son_. Albion, son of Neptune, wars with Her'culês, son of Jove. Neptune, dissatisfied with the share of his father's kingdom, awarded to him by Jupiter, aspired to dethrone his brother, but Hercules took his father's part, and Albion was discomfited.    Since Albion wielded arms against the son of   Jove.  M. Drayton, _Polyolbion_, iv. (1612).  ALBO'RAK, the animal brought by Gabriel to convey Mahomet to the seventh heaven. It had the face of a man, the cheeks of a horse, the wings of an eagle, and spoke with a human voice.  ALBUMA'ZAR, Arabian astronomer (776-885).    Chaunteclere, our cocke, must tell what is o'clocke,   By the astrologye that he hath naturally   Conceyued and caught; for he was never taught   By Albumazar, the astronomer,   Nor by Ptholomy, prince of astronomy.   J. Skelton, _Philip Sparoiv_ (time, Henry VIII.).  Alcestis or Alcestes, daughter of Pelias and wife of Admetus (_q. v_.) On his wedding-day Admetus neglected to offer sacrifice to Diana and was condemned to die, but Apollo induced the Fates to spare his life if he could find a voluntary substitute. His wife offered to give her life for his, and went away with death; but Hercules fought with Death and restored Alcestes to her husband. This story is the subject of a tragedy _Alcestes_, by Euripides. Milton alludes to the incident in one of his sonnets:    Methought I saw my late espoused saint   Brought to me like Alcestes from the grave.  John Milton, Sonnet _On his deceased Wife_.  William Morris has made Alcestes the subject of one of the tales in his _Earthly Paradise._  A variation of the story is found in Longfellow's _The Golden Legend_, Henry of Hoheneck when dying was promised his life if a maiden could be found who would give up her life for his. Elsie, the daughter of Gottlieb, a tenant-farmer of the prince offered herself as a sacrifice, and followed her lord to Sorrento to give herself up to Lucifer; but Henry heard of it, and, moved by gratitude, saved Elsie and made her his wife.  _Alceste_, the hero of Molière's comedy _Le Misanthrope_. He has a pure and noble mind that has been soured and disgusted by intercourse with the world. Courtesy he holds to be the vice of fops, and the manners of society mere hypocrisy. He courts Célmène, a coquette and her treatment of his love confirms his bad opinion of mankind.  AL'CHEMIST (_The_), the last of the three great comedies of Ben Jonson (1610). The other two are _Vol'pone_ (2 _syl_.), (1605), and _The Silent Woman_ (1609). The object of _The Alchemist_ is to ridicule the belief in the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. The alchemist is \"Subtle,\" a mere quack; and \"sir Epicure Mammon\" is the chief dupe, who supplies money, etc., for the \"transmutation of metal.\" \"Abel Drugger\" a tobacconist, and \"Dapper\" a lawyer's clerk, are two other dupes. \"Captain Face,\" _alias_ \"Jeremy,\" the house-servant of \"Lovewit,\" and \"Dol Common\" are his allies. The whole thing is blown up by the unexpected return of \"Lovewit.\"  ALCIB'ADES (5 _syl._), the Athenian general. Being banished by the senate, he marches against the city, and the senate, being unable to offer resistance, open the gates to him (B.C. 450-404). This incident is introduced by Shakespeare in _Timon of Athens_.  ALCIBI'ADES' TABLES represented a god or goddess outwardly, and a Sile'nus, or deformed piper, within. Erasmus has a \"curious dissertation on these tables\" (_Adage_, 667, edit. R. Stephens); hence emblematic of falsehood and dissimulation.    Whose wants virtue is compared to these   False tables wrought by Alcibiades;   Which noted well of all were found t've bin   Most fair without, but most deformed within.  Wm. Browne, _Britannia's Pastorals_, i. (1613).  ALCI'DES, a name sometimes given to Hercules as the descendent of the hero Alcoeus through his son Amphitryon (_q. v._) The name is applied to any valiant hero.    The Tuscan poet [_Ariosto_] doth advance   The frantic paladin of France [_Orlando Furioso_];   And those more ancient do enhance   Alcidês in his fury.  M. Drayton, _Nymphidia_ (1563-1631).    Where is the great Alcidês of the field,   Valiant lord Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury?  Shakespeare, 1 _Henry VI_. act. iv. sc. 7 (1589).  ALCI'NA, Carnal Pleasure personified. In Bojardo's _Orlando Innamorato_ she is a fairy, who carries off Astolfo. In Ariosto's _Orlando Furioso_ she is a kind of Circê, whose garden is a scene of enchantment. Alcina enjoys her lovers for a season, and then converts them into trees, stones, wild beasts, and so on, as her fancy dictates.  AL'CIPHRON, or _The Minute Philosopher_, the title of a work by bishop Berkeley, so called from the name of the chief speaker, a freethinker. The object of this work is to expose the weakness of infidelity.  _Al'ciphron_, \"the epicurean,\" the hero of T. Moore's romance entitled _The Epicurean_.    Like Aleiphron, we swing in air and darkness,   and know not whither the wind blows us.  --_Putnam's Magazine._  ALCME'NA (in Molière, _Alcmène_), the wife of Amphitryon, general of the Theban army. While her husband is absent warring against the Telebo'ans, Jupiter assumes the form of Amphitryon; but Amphitryon himself returns home the next day, and great confusion arises between the false and true Amphitryon, which is augmented by Mercury, who personates Sos'ia, the slave of Amphitryon. By this amour of Jupiter, Alcmena becomes the mother of Her'culês. Plautus, Molière, and Dryden have all taken this plot for a comedy entitled _Amphitryon_.  ALCOFRI'BAS, the name by which Rabelais was called, after he came out of the prince's mouth, where he resided for six months, taking toll of every morsel of food that the prince ate. Pantag'ruel gave \"the merry fellow the lairdship of Salmigondin.\"--Rabelais, _Pantagruel_, ii. 32 (1533).  AL'COLOMB, \"subduer of hearts,\" daughter of Abou Aibou of Damascus, and sister of Ganem. The caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, in a fit of jealousy, commanded Ganem to be put to death, and his mother and sister to do penance for three days in Damascus, and then to be banished from Syria. The two ladies came to Bag dad, and were taken in by the charitable syndic of the jewellers. When the jealous fit of the caliph was over he sent for the two exiles. Alcolomb he made his wife, and her mother he married to his vizier.--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Ganem, the Slave of Love \").  ALCY'ON \"the wofullest man alive,\" but once \"the jolly shepherd swain that wont full merrily to pipe and dance,\" near where the Severn flows. One day he saw a lion's cub, and brought it up till it followed him about like a dog; but a cruel satyr shot it in mere wantonness. By the lion's cub he means Daphne, who died in her prime, and the cruel satyr is death. He said he hated everything--the heaven, the earth, fire, air, and sea, the day, the night; he hated to speak, to hear, to taste food, to see objects, to smell, to feel; he hated man and woman too, for his Daphne lived no longer. What became of this doleful shepherd the poet could never ween. Alcyon is sir Arthur Gorges.--Spencer, _Daphnaida_ (in seven fyttes, 1590).    And there is that Alcyon bent to mourn,   Though fit to frame an everlasting ditty.

Spenser, _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_ (1591).  ALCY'ONE or HALCYONE (4 _syl_.), daughter of Aeolus, who, on hearing of her husband's death by shipwreck, threw herself into the sea, and was changed to a kingfisher. (See HALCYON DAYS.)  ALDABEL'LA, wife of Orlando, sister of Oliver, and daughter of Monodan'tês.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso, etc_. (1516).  _Aldabella_, a marchioness of Florence, very beautiful and fascinating, but arrogant and heartless. She used to give entertainments to the magnates of Florence, and Fazio was one who spent most of his time in her society. Bian'ca his wife, being jealous of the marchioness, accused him to the duke of being privy to the death of Bartoldo, and for this offence Fazio was executed. Bianca died broken-hearted, and Aldabella was condemned to spend the rest of her life in a nunnery.--Dean Milman, _Fazio_ (a tragedy, 1815).  ALDEN (_John_), one of the sons of the Pilgrim fathers, in love with Priscilla, the beautiful puritan. Miles Standish, a bluff old soldier, wishing to marry Priscilla, asked John Alden to go and plead for him; but the maiden answered archly, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John!\" Soon after this, Standish being reported killed by a poisoned arrow, John spoke for himself, and the maiden consented. Standish, however, was not killed, but only wounded; he made his reappearance at the wedding, where, seeing how matters stood, he accepted the situation with the good-natured remark:    If you would be served you must serve yourself;   and moreover   No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season   of Christmas.  Longfellow, _Courtship of Miles Standish_ (1858).  ALDIBORONTEPHOSCOPHORNIO _[Al'diboron'te-fos'co-for'nio]_, a character in _Chrononhotonthologos_, by H. Carey.  (Sir Walter Scott used to call James Ballantyne, the printer, this nickname, from his pomposity and formality of speech.)  AL'DIGER, son of Buo'vo, of the house of Clarmont, brother of Malagi'gi and Vivian.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).  AL'DINE (2 _syl_.), leader of the second squadron of Arabs which joined the Egyptian armament against the crusaders. Tasso says of the Arabs, \"Their accents were female and their stature diminutive\" (xvii.).--Tasso, _Jerusalem Delivered_ (1575).  AL'DINGAR _(Sir)_, steward of queen Eleanor, wife of Henry II. He impeached the queen's fidelity, and agreed to prove his charge by single combat; but an angel (in the shape of a little child) established the queen's innocence. This is probably a blundering version of the story of Gunhilda and the emperor Henry.--Percy, _Reliques_, ii. 9.  ALDO, a Caledonian, was not invited by Fingal to his banquet on his return to Morven, after the overthrow of Swaran. To resent this affront, he went over to Fingal's avowed enemy, Erragon king of Sora (in Scandinavia), and here Lorma, the king's wife, fell in love with him. The guilty pair fled to Morven, which Erragon immediately invaded. Aldo fell in single combat with Erragon, Lorma died of grief, and Erragon was slain in battle by Graul, son of Morni.--_Ossian_ (\"The Battle of Lora\").

ALEC'TRYON, a youth set by Mars to guard against surprises, but he fell asleep, and Apollo thus surprised Mars and Venus in each others' embrace. Mars in anger changed the boy into a cock.    And from out the neighboring farmyard   Loud the cock Alectryon crowed.   Longfellow, _Pegasus in Pound_.  ALEC YEATON, the Gloucester skipper in T. B. Aldrich's ballad, _Alec Yeaton's Son_.    The wind it wailed, the wind it moaned,   And the white caps flecked the sea;   \"An' I would to God,\" the skipper groaned,   \"I had not my boy with me!\"         *       *       *       *       *    Long did they marvel in the town   At God His strange decree;   That let the stalwart skipper drown,   And the little child go free. (1890.)  ALE'RIA, one of the Amazons, and the best beloved of the ten wives of Guido the Savage.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).  ALESSANDRO, husband of the Indian girl Ramona, in Helen Hunt Jackson's novel _Ramona_. The story of the young couple is a series of oppressions and deceits practised by U. S. officials (1884). ALESSIO, the young man with whom Lisa was living in concubinage, when Elvi'no promised to marry her. Elvino made the promise out of pique, because he thought Ami'na was not faithful to him, but when he discovered his error he returned to his first love, and left Lisa to marry Alessio, with whom she had been previously cohabiting.--Bellini's opera, _La Sonnamlula_ (1831).  ALE'THES (3 _syl_.), an ambassador from Egypt to king Al'adine (3 _syl_.); subtle, false, deceitful, and full of wiles.--Tasso, _Jerusalem Delivered_ (1575).  ALEXANDER PATOFF, brother of the young Russian who figures most prominently in F. Marion Crawford's novel _Paul Patoff_.

WALTON, physician and suitor of Margaret Kent in _The Story of Margaret Kent_, by Henry Hayes (Ellen Olney Kirke) (1886).  ALEXANDER THE GREAT, a tragedy by Nathaniel Lee (1678). In French we have a novel called _Roman d'Alexandre_, by Lambert-li-cors (twelfth century), and a tragedy by Racine (1665).  _Alexander an Athlete_. Alexander, being asked if he would run a course at the Olympic games, replied, \"Yes, if my competitors are all kings.\"  _The Albanian Alexander_, George Castriot _(Scanderbeg_ or _Iscander beg_, 1404-1467).  _The Persian Alexander_, Sandjar (1117-1158).  _Alexander of the North_, Charles XII. of Sweden (1682-1718).  _Alexander deformed_.    Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high.  Pope, _Prologue to the Satires_, 117.  _Alexander and Homer_. When Alexander invaded Asia Minor, he offered up sacrifice to Priam, and then went to visit the tomb of Achilles. Here he exclaimed, \"O most enviable of men, who had Homer to sing thy deeds!\"  Which made the Eastern conqueror to cry,    \"O fortunate young man! whose virtue found   So brave a trump thy noble deeds to sound.\"  Spenser, _The Ruins of Time_ (1591).  _Alexander and Parme'nio._ When Darius, king of Persia, offered Alexander his daughter Stati'ra in marriage, with a dowry of 10,000 talents of gold, Parmenio said, \"I would accept the offer, if I were Alexander.\" To this Alexander rejoined, \"So would I, if I were Parmenio.\"  On another occasion the general thought the king somewhat too lavish in his gifts, whereupon Alexander made answer, \"I consider not what Parmenio ought to receive, but what Alexander ought to give.\"  _Alexander and Perdiccas_. When Alexander started for Asia he divided his possessions among his friends. Perdiccas asked what he had left for himself. \"Hope,\" said Alexander. \"If hope is enough for Alexander,\" replied the friend, \"it is enough for Perdiccas also;\" and declined to accept anything.  _Alexander and Raphael_. Alexander encountered Raphael in a cave in the mountain of Kaf, and being asked what he was in search of, replied, \"The water of immortality.\" Whereupon Raphael gave him a stone, and told him when he found another of the same weight he would gain his wish. \"And how long,\" said Alexander, \"have I to live?\" The angel replied, \"Till the heaven above thee and the earth beneath thee are of iron.\" Alexander now went forth and found a stone almost of the weight required, and in order to complete the balance, added a little earth; falling from his horse at Ghur he was laid in his armor on the ground, and his shield was set up over him to ward off the sun. Then understood he that he would gain immortality when, like the stone, he was buried in the earth, and that his hour was come, for the earth beneath him was iron, and his iron buckler was his vault of heaven above. So he died.  _Alexander and the Robber_. When Dion'idês, a pirate, was brought before Alexander, he exclaimed, \"Vile brigand! How dare you infest the seas with your misdeeds?\" \"And you,\" replied the pirate, \"by what right do you ravage the world? Because I have only one ship, I am called a brigand, but you who have a whole fleet are termed a conqueror.\" Alexander admired the man's boldness, and commanded him to be set at liberty.  _Alexander's Beard_, a smooth chin, or a very small beard. It is said that Alexander the Great had scarcely any beard at all.    Disgracèd yet with Alexander's bearde.  G. Gascoigne, _The Steele Glas_ (died 1577).  _Alexander's Runner_, Ladas.
