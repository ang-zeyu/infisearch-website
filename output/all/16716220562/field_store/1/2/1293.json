Do you really believe that     such is our aim? Do you find it in our platform, our speeches, our     conventions, or anywhere? If not, withdraw the charge.      But you may say that though it is not our aim, it will be the     result, if we succeed, and that we are therefore disunionists in     fact. This is a grave charge you make against us, and we certainly     have a right to demand that you specify in what way we are to     dissolve the Union. How are we to effect this?      The only specification offered is volunteered by Mr. Fillmore in     his Albany speech. His charge is that if we elect a President and     Vice-President both from the free-States it will dissolve the     Union. This is open folly. The Constitution provides that the     President and Vice-President of the United States shall be of     different States; but says nothing as to the latitude and longitude     of those States. In 1828 Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee, and John C.     Calhoun, of South Carolina, were elected President and     Vice-President, both from slave-States; but no one thought of     dissolving the Union then on that account. In 1840 Harrison, of     Ohio, and Tyler, of Virginia, were elected. In 1841 Harrison died     and John Tyler succeeded to the presidency, and William R. King, of     Alabama, was elected acting Vice-President by the Senate; but no     one supposed that the Union was in danger. In fact, at the very     time Mr. Fillmore uttered this idle charge, the state of things in     the United States disproved it. Mr. Pierce, of New Hampshire, and     Mr. Bright, of Indiana, both from free-States, are President and     Vice-President, and the Union stands and will stand. You do not     pretend that it ought to dissolve the Union, and the facts show     that it won't; therefore the charge may be dismissed without     further consideration.    [Sidenote] Galena \"Advertiser,\" copied into the Illinois \"State   Journal,\" August 8, 1856.      No other specification is made, and the only one that could be made     is, that the restoration of the restriction of 1820 making the     United States territory free territory would dissolve the Union.     Gentlemen, it will require a decided majority to pass such an act.     We, the majority, being able constitutionally to do all that we     purpose, would have no desire to dissolve the Union. Do you say     that such restriction of slavery would be unconstitutional, and     that some of the States would not submit to its enforcement? I     grant you that an unconstitutional act is not a law; but I do not     ask and will not take your construction of the Constitution. The     Supreme Court of the United States is the tribunal to decide such a     question, and we will submit to its decisions; and if you do also,     there will be an end of the matter. Will you? If not, who are the     disunionists, you or we? We, the majority, would not strive to     dissolve the Union; and if any attempt is made it must be by you,     who so loudly stigmatize us as disunionists.      But the Union, in any event, will not be dissolved. We don't want     to dissolve it, and if you attempt it we won't let you. With the     purse and sword, the army and navy and treasury in our hands and at     our command, you could not do it. This government would be very     weak indeed if a majority with a disciplined army and navy and a     well-filled treasury could not preserve itself, when attacked by an     unarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. All this talk about     the dissolution of the Union is humbug, nothing but folly. We do     not want to dissolve the Union; you shall not.  With three presidential tickets in the field--with the Democrats seeking the election of Buchanan and Breckinridge, the Americans, or Know-Nothings, asking votes for Fillmore and Donelson, and the Republicans making proselytes for Frémont and Dayton--the political campaign of 1856 was one of unabated activity and excitement. In the State of Illinois the contest resulted in a drawn battle. The American party held together with tolerable firmness in its vote for President, but was largely disintegrated in its vote on the ticket for State officers. The consequence was that Illinois gave a plurality of 9164 for Buchanan, the Democratic candidate for President, while at the same time it gave a plurality of 4729 for Bissell, the Republican candidate for Governor.[5]  Half victory as it was, it furnished the Illinois Republicans a substantial hope of the full triumph which they achieved four years later. About a month after this election, at a Republican banquet given in Chicago on the 10th of December, 1856, Abraham Lincoln spoke as follows, partly in criticism of the last annual message of President Pierce, but more especially pointing out the rising star of promise:      We have another annual presidential message. Like a rejected     lover making merry at the wedding of his rival, the President     felicitates himself hugely over the late presidential election.     He considers the result a signal triumph of good principles and     good men, and a very pointed rebuke of bad ones. He says the     people did it. He forgets that the \"people,\" as he complacently     calls only those who voted for Buchanan, are in a minority of the     whole people by about four hundred thousand votes--one full tenth     of all the votes. Remembering this, he might perceive that the     \"rebuke\" may not be quite as durable as he seems to think--that     the majority may not choose to remain permanently rebuked by that     minority.      The President thinks the great body of us Frémonters, being     ardently attached to liberty, in the abstract, were duped by a     few wicked and designing men. There is a slight difference of     opinion on this. We think he, being ardently attached to the hope     of a second term, in the concrete, was duped by men who had     liberty every way. He is the cat's-paw. By much dragging of     chestnuts from the fire for others to eat, his claws are burnt     off to the gristle, and he is thrown aside as unfit for further     use. As the fool said of _King Lear_, when his daughters had     turned him out-of-doors, \"He's a shelled peascod.\" [That's a     sheal'd peascod.]      So far as the President charges us \"with a desire to change the     domestic institutions of existing States,\" and of \"doing     everything in our power to deprive the Constitution and the laws     of moral authority,\" for the whole party on belief, and for     myself on knowledge, I pronounce the charge an unmixed and     unmitigated falsehood.    [Sidenote] Illinois \"State Journal,\" December 16, 1856.      Our government rests in public opinion. Whoever can change public     opinion can change the government practically just so much.     Public opinion, on any subject, always has a \"central idea,\" from     which all its minor thoughts radiate. That \"central idea\" in our     political public opinion at the beginning was, and until recently     has continued to be, \"the equality of men.\" And although it has     always submitted patiently to whatever of inequality there seemed     to be as matter of actual necessity, its constant working has     been a steady progress towards the practical equality of all men.     The late presidential election was a struggle by one party to     discard that central idea and to substitute for it the opposite     idea that slavery is right in the abstract, the workings of which     as a central idea may be the perpetuity of human slavery and its     extension to all countries and colors. Less than a year ago the     Richmond \"Enquirer,\" an avowed advocate of slavery, regardless of     color, in order to favor his views, invented the phrase \"State     equality,\" and now the President, in his message, adopts the     \"Enquirer's\" catch-phrase, telling us the people \"have asserted     the constitutional equality of each and all of the States of the     Union as States.\" The President flatters himself that the new     central idea is completely inaugurated; and so indeed it is, so     far as the mere fact of a presidential election can inaugurate     it. To us it is left to know that the majority of the people have     not yet declared for it, and to hope that they never will. All of     us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan, taken together, are a     majority of four hundred thousand. But in the late contest we     were divided between Frémont and Fillmore. Can we not come     together for the future? Let every one who really believes, and     is resolved, that free society is not and shall not be a failure,     and who can conscientiously declare that in the past contest he     has done only what he thought best, let every such one have     charity to believe that every other one can say as much. Thus let     bygones be bygones; let past differences as nothing be; and with     steady eye on the real issue, let us reinaugurate the good old     \"central ideas\" of the republic. We can do it. The human heart is     with us; God is with us. We shall again be able not to declare     that \"all States as States are equal,\" nor yet that \"all citizens     as citizens are equal,\" but to renew the broader, better     declaration, including both these and much more, that \"all men     are created equal.\"  Though these fragments of addresses give us only an imperfect reflection of the style of Mr. Lincoln's oratory during this period, they nevertheless show its essential characteristics, a pervading clearness of analysis, and that strong tendency to axiomatic definition which gives so many of his sentences their convincing force and durable value. They also show us the combination, not often found in such happy balance, of the politician's discernment of fact with the statesman's wisdom of theory--how present forces of national life are likely to be moved by future impulses of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],["title","The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#0)"],["body","Balkans A HISTORY OF BULGARIA—SERBIA—GREECE—RUMANIA—TURKEY  BY NEVILL FORBES, ARNOLD J.

Widely separated, engaged on other duties, and pressed for time, we have had no opportunity for interchange of views. Each must be held responsible, therefore, for his own section alone. If there be any discrepancies in our writings (it is not unlikely in so disputed a field of history) we can only regret an unfortunate result of the circumstances. Owing to rapid change in the relations of our country to the several Balkan peoples, the tone of a section written earlier may differ from that of another written later. It may be well to state that the sections on Serbia and Bulgaria were finished before the decisive Balkan developments of the past two months. Those on Greece and Rumania represent only a little later stage of the evolution. That on Turkey, compiled between one mission abroad and another, was the latest to be finished.  If our sympathies are not all the same, or given equally to friends and foes, none of us would find it possible to indite a Hymn of Hate about any Balkan people. Every one of these peoples, on whatever side he be fighting to-day, has a past worthy of more than our respect and interwoven in some intimate way with our history. That any one of them is arrayed against us to-day is not to be laid entirely or chiefly at its own door. They are all fine peoples who have not obtained their proper places in the sun. The best of the Osmanli nation, the Anatolian peasantry, has yet to make its physical and moral qualities felt under civilized conditions. As for the rest—the Serbs and the Bulgars, who have enjoyed brief moments of barbaric glory in their past, have still to find themselves in that future which shall be to the Slav. The Greeks, who were old when we were not as yet, are younger now than we. They are as incalculable a factor in a political forecast as another Chosen Race, the Jews. Their past is the world’s glory: the present in the Near East is theirs more than any people’s: the future—despite the laws of corporate being and decline, dare we say they will have no part in it? Of Rumania what are we to think? Her mixed people has had the start of the Balkan Slavs in modern civilization, and evidently her boundaries must grow wider yet. But the limits of her possible expansion are easier to set than those of the rest.  We hope we have dealt fairly with all these peoples. Mediaeval history, whether of the East or the West, is mostly a record of bloodshedding and cruelty; and the Middle Age has been prolonged to our own time in most parts of the Balkans, and is not yet over in some parts. There are certain things salutary to bear in mind when we think or speak of any part of that country to-day. First, that less than two hundred years ago, England had its highwaymen on all roads, and its smuggler dens and caravans, Scotland its caterans, and Ireland its moonlighters. Second, that religious fervour has rarely mitigated and generally increased our own savagery. Thirdly, that our own policy in Balkan matters has been none too wise, especially of late. In permitting the Treaty of Bucarest three years ago, we were parties to making much of the trouble that has ensued, and will ensue again. If we have not been able to write about the Near East under existing circumstances altogether _sine ira et studio_, we have tried to remember that each of its peoples has a case.  D.G. HOGARTH.   _November_, 1915.     BULGARIA AND SERBIA     1 _Introductory_   The whole of what may be called the trunk or _massif_ of the Balkan peninsula, bounded on the north by the rivers Save and Danube, on the west by the Adriatic, on the east by the Black Sea, and on the south by a very irregular line running from Antivari (on the coast of the Adriatic) and the lake of Scutari in the west, through lakes Okhrida and Prespa (in Macedonia) to the outskirts of Salonika and thence to Midia on the shores of the Black Sea, following the coast of the Aegean Sea some miles inland, is preponderatingly inhabited by Slavs. These Slavs are the Bulgarians in the east and centre, the Serbs and Croats (or Serbians and Croatians or Serbo-Croats) in the west, and the Slovenes in the extreme north-west, between Trieste and the Save; these nationalities compose the southern branch of the Slavonic race. The other inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula are, to the south of the Slavs, the Albanians in the west, the Greeks in the centre and south, and the Turks in the south-east, and, to the north, the Rumanians. All four of these nationalities are to be found in varying quantities within the limits of the Slav territory roughly outlined above, but greater numbers of them are outside it; on the other hand, there are a considerable number of Serbs living north of the rivers Save and Danube, in southern Hungary. Details of the ethnic distribution and boundaries will of course be gone into more fully later; meanwhile attention may be called to the significant fact that the name of Macedonia, the heart of the Balkan peninsula, has been long used by the French gastronomers to denote a dish, the principal characteristic of which is that its component parts are mixed up into quite inextricable confusion.  Of the three Slavonic nationalities already mentioned, the two first, the Bulgarians and the Serbo-Croats, occupy a much greater space, geographically and historically, than the third. The Slovenes, barely one and a half million in number, inhabiting the Austrian provinces of Carinthia and Carniola, have never been able to form a political state, though, with the growth of Trieste as a great port and the persistent efforts of Germany to make her influence if not her flag supreme on the shores of the Adriatic, this small people has from its geographical position and from its anti-German (and anti-Italian) attitude achieved considerable notoriety and some importance.  Of the Bulgars and Serbs it may be said that at the present moment the former control the eastern, and the latter, in alliance with the Greeks, the western half of the peninsula. It has always been the ambition of each of these three nationalities to dominate the whole, an ambition which has caused endless waste of blood and money and untold misery. If the question were to be settled purely on ethnical considerations, Bulgaria would acquire the greater part of the interior of Macedonia, the most numerous of the dozen nationalities of which is Bulgarian in sentiment if not in origin, and would thus undoubtedly attain the hegemony of the peninsula, while the centre of gravity of the Serbian nation would, as is ethnically just, move north-westwards. Political considerations, however, have until now always been against this solution of the difficulty, and, even if it solved in this sense, there would still remain the problem of the Greek nationality, whose distribution along all the coasts of the Aegean, both European and Asiatic, makes a delimitation of the Greek state on purely ethnical lines virtually impossible. It is curious that the Slavs, though masters of the interior of the peninsula and of parts of its eastern and western coasts, have never made the shores of the Aegean (the White Sea, as they call it) or the cities on them their own. The Adriatic is the only sea on the shore of which any Slavonic race has ever made its home. In view of this difficulty, namely, the interior of the peninsula being Slavonic while the coastal fringe is Greek, and of the approximately equal numerical strength of all three nations, it is almost inevitable that the ultimate solution of the problem and delimitation of political boundaries will have to be effected by means of territorial compromise. It can only"]]]
