She's just a schoolgirl like ourselves and nobody would think of asking her to do anything.\"  \"That's the trouble,\" sighed Hinpoha discontentedly. \"We're just girls, and the only thing we'll ever get to do is just knit, knit, knit, and there's no glory in that. That's the only 'bit' we'll ever be able to do.\"  The other three echoed her sigh and reflected sadly upon their circumscribed sphere, and Sahwah's dream of being another Joan of Arc flickered out into darkness. Then she brightened again as her thoughts took a new turn.  \"Well, there's one thing we have to be thankful for,\" she said feelingly. \"If we can't help to make history, we won't have to learn it, either. We're past the history part of school. But just think what the pupils will have to learn in the years to come--and the names of all those battles that are being fought every day now, and the unpronounceable names of all those cities in Europe, and all the different generals. It was hard enough to keep the Civil War generals straight, and there were only _two_ sets of them--think of having to remember all the American and English and French and Italian and Russian ones, to say nothing of the German! Why, it will be such a chore to study history that the pupils won't have time to study anything else! People always look at little babies and say how fortunate they are; when they grow up the war will be over and everything lovely again, but I always think, 'Poor things, wait until they have to study history!' How lucky we are to be living through it instead of having to learn it out of books!\"  All the while Sahwah was talking, Hinpoha had been watching with undisguised interest a man who sat in the seat directly across the aisle from them, who, with an artist's sketching pad on his knee, was drawing caricatures with a thick black pencil. Hinpoha, clever artist that she was herself, took a lively interest in anyone else who could draw, and from the glimpses she could get of the sketches being made across the aisle, she recognized the peculiar genius of the artist. She attracted the attention of the other three, and they too watched in wonder and with ever-growing interest. The artist finally looked up, saw the four eager pairs of eyes fastened on him, and nodding in a friendly way, handed his sketch-book across the aisle.  \"Would you like to see them?\" he asked genially, his eye lingering on Hinpoha's glory-crowned head with artistic appreciation.  He himself looked like the typical artist one sees in pictures. His hair was long and wavy and his blond beard was trimmed in Van Dyke fashion. Hinpoha nearly burst with admiration of him, and when he became aware of her existence and offered to show his sketches she was in a flutter of joy.  \"Oh, may we?\" she exclaimed delightedly, taking the book from his hand.  \"Oh, lookee!\" she squealed in rapture to the other girls. \"Did you ever see anything so quaint?\"  The others looked and also exclaimed in wonder and delight. There were pictures of trains running along on legs instead of wheels, of houses and barns whose windows and doors were cunningly arranged to form features, of buildings that sailed through the air with wings like birds'; of drawbridges with one end sticking up in the air while an enormously fat man sat on the other end; of ships walking along on stilts that reached clear to the bottom of the ocean!  \"Oh, aren't they the most fascinating things you ever saw?\" cried Sahwah, enraptured.  Utterly absorbed, she did not see the lieutenant of aviation gather up his things to leave the train at one of the way stations; was not aware that he paused on his way out and looked at her for a long, irresolute minute and then went hastily on.  The last page in the book of sketches had not been reached when the train came to a stop right out in the hills, between stations.  \"What's the matter?\" everybody was soon asking.  Heads were popped out of windows and there was a general rush for the platforms, as the sounds outside indicated excitement of some kind.  \"Two freight trains collided on the bridge and broke it down,\" was the word that passed from mouth to mouth. \"The train will be delayed for hours.\"  Dismayed at the long wait in store for them, the Winnebagos sat down in their seats again, prepared to make the best of it, when the judicial-looking gentleman who had been sitting in front of them came up and said, \"Pardon me, but I couldn't help overhearing you girls talking about going to Oakwood. I am going to Oakwood myself--I live there--and I know how we can get there without waiting hours and hours for this train to go on. We are only about twenty miles from Oakwood now and right near an interurban car line. We can go in on the electric car and not lose much time. I will be glad to assist you in any way possible. My name is Wing, Mr. Ira B. Wing.\"  \"Not Agony and Oh-Pshaw's father!\" exclaimed Hinpoha. \"I knew they lived in Oakwood, but----\"  \"The same,\" interrupted Mr. Wing, smiling broadly. \"Are you acquainted with my girls?\"  \"Are we?\" returned Hinpoha. \"Ask them who roomed next to them this last year at Brownell! Do we know the Heavenly Twins! Isn't it perfectly wonderful that you should turn out to be their father! We were having a discussion a while ago as to whether you were a lawyer or a professor, and Sahwah--excuse me, this is Miss Brewster, Mr. Wing, another one of the Winnebagos, that the Twins don't know--yet--Sahwah insisted that you were a lawyer and I insisted you were a professor, and now Sahwah was right after all. You _are_ a lawyer, aren't you? I believe Agony said you were.\"  \"I am,\" replied Mr. Wing with a twinkle in his eye, \"and I'm more than delighted to meet you. Come along, and we'll see if we can't get to Oakwood before dark.\"  Then the whimsical artist came up and addressed Mr. Wing. \"Did I hear you say you could get to Oakwood on the electric?\" he inquired. \"I'm going there too. My name is Prince, Eugene Prince.\"  \"Glad to meet you,\" replied Mr. Wing heartily. \"Come along.\" He summoned the porter to carry out the various suitcases.  Before long the little party were aboard the electric car, and reached Oakwood almost as soon as they would have if the train had not been held up. The electric car went by the railway station and the Winnebagos got off, because Nyoda would be waiting for them there. Mr. Wing and the artist went on to the center of the town.     CHAPTER III  CARVER HOUSE   Nyoda was waiting for them on the platform, looking just as she used to, radiant, girlish, enthusiastic, bubbling over with fun. Not a shade of sadness or anxiety in her face betrayed the loneliness in her heart and her longing for the presence of the dear man she had sent forth in the cause of liberty. In respect to sorrows, Nyoda's attitude toward the world had always been, \"Those which are yours are mine, but those which are mine are my own.\"  Encircled by four pairs of Winnebago arms and with eager questions being hurled at her from all sides, it seemed as if the old times had come again indeed.  \"Sahwah! Migwan! Hinpoha! Gladys!\" she exclaimed joyfully, looking at them with beaming eyes. \"My own Winnebagos! But come, I'm dying to show you my new playhouse,\" and she led the way across the station platform to where her automobile stood waiting.  A swift spin along a quiet avenue bordered with immense old oaks that stood like rows of soldiers at attention, and up quite a steep hill, from which they could look back upon the houses and buildings clustering in the valley, which was the heart of the town, and then they drew up before a very old brick house which stood on the summit of the hill. It had green blinds and a fanlight over the front door, and a brick walk running from the front steps to the street, bordered on each side by a box hedge in a prim, Ladies' Garden effect like one sees in the illustrations of children's poems.  \"Oh, Nyoda, how splendid!\" cried Hinpoha, her artistic soul delighted beyond measure at the hedge and the walk and the white door with its quaint knocker.  \"Wait until you see the inside,\" replied Nyoda, throwing open the door with the pleased air of a child exhibiting a new and cherished toy.  Cries of admiration and delight filled the air as the Winnebagos entered. The whole house was furnished just as it might have been in the old Colonial days--braided rugs on the floor, candlesticks in glass holders, slender-legged, spindle-backed chairs, quaint mahogany tables, a huge spinning wheel before the fireplace, and, wonder of wonders! between the two end windows of the stately parlor there stood a harp, the late sunshine gleaming in a soft radiance from its gilded frame and slender wires like the glory of a by-gone day. Hinpoha stood enraptured before the instrument.  \"I've always been wild to learn to play on a harp,\" she said, drawing her fingers caressingly over the strings and awaking faint, throbbing tones, too soft to be discords, that echoed through the room like the ghost of a song played years ago, and trembled away until they seemed to mingle with the golden light that flooded the room through the west windows.  \"If I had my choice of being any of the fabulous creatures in the mythology book,\" said Hinpoha musingly, \"I think I'd choose to be a harpy.\"  \"A what?\" asked Nyoda quizzically.  \"A harpy,\" repeated Hinpoha, touching the strings again. Then, looking up and seeing the twinkle in Nyoda's eye, she added, \"Weren't the Harpies beautiful maidens that sat on the rocks and played harps and lured the sailors to destruction with their ravishing songs? Oh, I say, they were too,\" she finished feebly, amid a perfect shout of laughter from the girls. \"Well, what _were_ they, then?"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11664"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls Do Their Bit; Or, Over the Top with the Winnebagos (#4)"],["body","monsters? Oh, what a shame! What a misleading thing the English language is, anyway! You'd naturally expect a harpy to play on a harp. Anyway, you needn't laugh, Sahwah. I remember once you said in class that a peptonoid was a person with a lot of pep, so there!\"  Sahwah joined gaily in the laugh that followed at her expense. \"So I did,\" she admitted unblushingly, \"and what's more, I only discovered day before yesterday that a trapezoid wasn't a trapeze performer!\"  \"Oh, Sahwah, you imp, you're making that up,\" said Gladys in a skeptical tone.  \"Nice child,\" said Nyoda, patting Sahwah approvingly, trying to turn the laugh upon herself, on the principle that the hostess should always break another cut glass tumbler when the guest breaks one.\"  \"Oh dear,\" said Migwan regretfully, \"why did you say that about Harpies, Hinpoha, and make us laugh? I was just thinking how beautiful you looked, leaning over that harp, just like that oil painting in the gallery at home, and was getting into quite a poetical mood over it, when you had to make us laugh and spoil it all. I declare, that was too bad!\"  \"Serves you right for getting poetical about me,\" retorted Hinpoha.  \"But Nyoda,\" said Gladys, whose eyes had been feasting on the details of the house with every increasing wonder and pleasure, \"how does it come that you moved into this little town from Philadelphia, and how do you happen to be living in this wonderful old house?\"  \"I inherited this place a few months after I was married,\" replied Nyoda. \"It is the old Carver House; built before the Revolution and kept in the family ever since. My mother was a Carver--that's how I happened to inherit it. She died years ago, without ever dreaming that the house would come to me, for she was not a direct heir, being only a third cousin. But the last of the direct line died out with old Uncle Jasper Carver and that left me the only living blood relation. So this beautiful house and everything in it came to me.\"  \"Oh, Nyoda, I should think you would have died of joy!\" said Hinpoha in a rapt tone. \"I know people who would give their eyebrows to own so much old Colonial furniture.\"  \"This house has seen proud days in its time,\" went on Nyoda. \"The Carvers were staunch patriots, and many a meeting of loyal citizens was held around that table in the dining room. They say that Benjamin Franklin was once a guest here. The history of the Carver family was Uncle Jasper's pet hobby, and he has it all printed up in books which you may see in the library.  \"The Carvers have always been a fighting family,\" she continued, with a flash of pride in her black eyes. \"They fought in the Revolution, in the Civil War, and in the Spanish-American War. But now that the country is again calling men to her aid,\" she finished with a sigh, \"there are no more Carver men to answer the call. I am the last of the Carvers, and I am only a woman.\"  \"But you've done all that you _could_ do,\" said Migwan staunchly. \"You've sent your husband.\"  Nyoda drew herself up unconsciously as her eyes sought the picture of Sherry on the mantelpiece with the silk flag draped over it.  \"Yes,\" she echoed softly, \"the last of the Carvers has done her bit.\"  A dinner bell clanged through the house and Nyoda sprang up with a start. \"Dinner will be ready in fifteen minutes, girls,\" she exclaimed. \"Scurry upstairs and remove the stains of travel while I consult the cook.\"  \"Why, Nyoda,\" said Sahwah in surprise, \"I didn't know you had a cook. You told us coming up from the station that you did all your own work because you didn't think it was patriotic to hire servants at this time and take them away from the more essential industries!\"  Nyoda looked nonplussed for a moment and then she laughed heartily. \"Special occasion,\" she remarked ceremoniously, and disappeared with a chuckle through a door at the end of the hall.  The four girls went leisurely up the broad staircase with its white spindles and polished mahogany rail to the rooms overhead, furnished with huge curtained four-posters and fascinating chests of drawers with cut-glass knobs.  In fifteen minutes the bell sent its summons through the house again and the Winnebagos responded with alacrity. Nyoda stood in the dining-room doorway to receive them, looking rather mysterious, they thought, and Sahwah's sharp eyes counted a sixth place laid at the table. Nyoda seated them, apparently not noticing the empty place, and then tinkled the little bell that stood on the table at her place. In answer to her tinkle the pantry door opened and in came the cook carrying a tray of dishes. The Winnebagos looked up idly as she came in and the next moment the ancestral Chippendale chairs of the Carver family were shoved back unceremoniously as their occupants joined in a mad scramble to see who could reach the cook first, while Nyoda looked on and laughed gleefully.  \"Veronica! Veronica Lehar!\" cried the Winnebagos in wonder and ecstasy. \"_You_ here!\" \"How perfectly gorgeous!\" \"How did you happen to come?\"  \"By urgent invitation, sweet lambs,\" replied Nyoda, \"just like some other people I could name. She blazed the trail for the Winnebagos by arriving yesterday.\"  \"Oh, you naughty, bad 'Bagos,\" said Migwan, embracing both Veronica and Nyoda in her delight, \"to frame up such a surprise for us! We standing there cool as cucumbers in the front room of the house talking for half an hour and Veronica out in the kitchen all the while, masquerading as cook!\"  \"You pretty nearly upset the surprise, though, Mistress Sahwah,\" said Nyoda, \"with your suspicions in regard to my having a cook. It's next to impossible to take you in, you eagle-eyed Indian! Come, Veronica, roll down your sleeves and take your rightful place at the table. Now, girls,    \"While we're here let's give a cheer   And sing to Wohelo!\"  And then let's dip our wheatless crusts into our meatless broth for the eternal glory and prosperity of the Winnebagos!\"     CHAPTER IV  VERONICA   Dinner over, the Winnebagos fell upon the dishes like a swarm of bees and had them cleared up and washed in a twinkling. Then they gathered in the long parlor where the harp stood, and to please them Nyoda turned off the electric lights and lit the candles in their old-fashioned holders. The little twinkling lights multiplied themselves in the mirrors until it seemed as if there were myriads of them; grotesque six-fold shadows danced on the walls as the girls moved about; the gilded harp gleamed softly in the mellow light and an atmosphere of by-gone days hovered over the room. It was an ideal moment for confidences, for heart-to-heart talks, and they spoke of many things which were sacred to one another, little intimate echoes of the days when they first learned to work and play together.  \"Don't you remember, Veronica,\" said Migwan, \"when you became a Winnebago you took the gull for your symbol, because it flew over the ocean and you wanted to follow it home?\"  A memory of that day came back to the girls, of Veronica's bitter homesickness, and how desperately sorry they had been for her, and yet how helpless they had felt before her aristocratic mien. There was a great difference in her now, all the more noticeable because they had not seen her for a year. She was thinner and her eyes were larger and more pansylike than ever, but she was much more talkative and animated than she used to be. Very little of the old superior bearing remained, and the looks that she bent upon Nyoda were those of an humble and adoring slave. Proof positive of the change that had taken place in her was the prank she had played upon them that night in masquerading as the cook--she who had once refused to help prepare one of the famous suppers in the House of the Open Door, disdainfully remarking that cooking was work for servants, not for ladies.  At Migwan's remark Veronica stirred restlessly and made an emphatic gesture with her hand as she replied firmly, \"That was all nonsense. I gave up the gull as a symbol long ago. It had such a screaming, ugly cry instead of a song. If I am to be one of the Song Friends I must have a song bird for a symbol. I have changed to the red winged blackbird, because that was the first American bird I learned to know by his song, outside of the robin. His voice always sounded so gay and free, singing over the open fields, that he seemed to be a symbol of the freedom and happiness which one finds in America. When he sings 'O-ka-lee! O-ka-lee! O-ka-lee!' I always think he is singing 'Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!'\"  The four Winnebagos exchanged glances as Veronica uttered this sentiment, recalling their discussion of her in the train.  \"Would you like to go back to Hungary?\" asked Hinpoha.  Veronica shook her head vehemently. \"I would not go back to my old home now if I could. I know now that I could never be happy there after having tasted the freedom of America.\"  \"But you were not one of the oppressed poor,\" said Hinpoha. \"You belonged to the upper class, didn't you?\"  \"It is true, we were not poor,\" answered Veronica, \"we were not oppressed like the peasants. We did the oppressing ourselves, and because people in our station had done the same thing for hundreds of years we never stopped to think that it was wrong. The people in the village used to bow and scrape when they met us on the street, but how much they really cared for us I'd hate to say. It wasn't the way people greet each other in the streets here. Just imagine Sahwah, for instance, going down the street and meeting Hinpoha and having to bow humbly and wait until Hinpoha spoke to her first before she could say anything!\"  The Winnebagos shrieked with laughter at the picture thus conjured up.  \"Over here it seems too funny for anything,\" went on Veronica, \"but that's the sort of thing I've been used to all my life. Now I see how ridiculous it all was and how wicked, and it seems almost like a judgment that our estate was destroyed in the very first month of the war and we"]]]
