Egyptologists differ in their interpretations of certain passages, but agree as to general facts. In dealing with the facts it cannot be too clearly understood that the religious ideas of the prehistoric Egyptian were very different from those of the cultured priest of Memphis in the IInd dynasty, or those of the worshippers of Temu or Atum, the god of the setting sun, in the IVth dynasty. The editors of religious texts of all periods have retained many grossly superstitious and coarse beliefs, which they knew well to be the products of the imaginations of their savage, or semi-savage ancestors, not because they themselves believed in them, or thought that the laity to whom they ministered would accept them, but because of their reverence for inherited traditions. The followers of every great religion in the world have never wholly shaken off all the superstitions which they have in all generations inherited from their ancestors; and what is true of the peoples of the past is true, in a degree, of the peoples of to-day. In the East the older the ideas, and beliefs, and traditions, are, the more sacred they become; but this has not prevented men there from developing high moral and spiritual conceptions and continuing to believe in them, and among such must be counted the One, self-begotten, and self-existent God whom the Egyptians worshipped.     CHAPTER II.   OSIRIS THE GOD OF THE RESURRECTION.  The Egyptians of every period in which they are known to us believed that Osiris was of divine origin, that he suffered death and mutilation at the hands of the powers of evil, that after a great struggle with these powers he rose again, that he became henceforth the king of the underworld and judge of the dead, and that because he had conquered death the righteous also might conquer death; and they raised Osiris to such an exalted position in heaven that he became the equal and, in certain cases, the superior of R[=a], the Sun-god, and ascribed to him the attributes which belong unto God. However far back we go, we find that these views about Osiris are assumed to be known to the reader of religious texts and accepted by him, and in the earliest funeral book the position of Osiris in respect of the other gods is identical with that which he is made to hold in the latest copies of the Book of the Dead. The first writers of the ancient hieroglyphic funeral texts and their later editors have assumed so completely that the history of Osiris was known unto all men, that none of them, as far as we know, thought it necessary to write down a connected narrative of the life and sufferings upon earth of this god, or if they did, it has not come down to us. Even in the Vth dynasty we find Osiris and the gods of his cycle, or company, occupying a peculiar and special place in the compositions written for the benefit of the dead, and the stone and other monuments which belong to still earlier periods mention ceremonies the performance of which assumed the substantial accuracy of the history of Osiris as made known to us by later writers. But we have a connected history of Osiris which, though not written in Egyptian, contains so much that is of Egyptian origin that we may be sure that its author drew his information from Egyptian sources: I refer to the work, _De Iside et Osìride_, of the Greek writer, Plutarch, who flourished about the middle of the first century of our era. In it, unfortunately, Plutarch identifies certain of the Egyptian gods with the gods of the Greeks, and he adds a number of statements which rest either upon his own imagination, or are the results of misinformation. The translation [Footnote: _Plutarchi de Iside et Osirids liber: Graece et Anglice_. By S. Squire, Cambridge, 1744.] by Squire runs as follows:--    \"Rhea, [Footnote: _i.e._, Nut.] say they, having accompanied Saturn   [Footnote: _i.e._, Seb.] by stealth, was discovered by the Sun,   [Footnote: _i.e._, R[=a].] who hereupon denounced a curse upon her,   'that she should not he delivered in any month or year'--Mercury,   however, being likewise in love with the same goddess, in recompense   of the favours which he had received from her, plays at tables with   the Moon, and wins from her the seventieth part of each of her   illuminations; these several parts, mating in the whole five days, he   afterwards joined together, and added to the three hundred and sixty,   of which the year formerly consisted, which days therefore are even   yet called by the Egyptians the Epact or superadded, and observed by   them as the birthdays of their gods. For upon the first of them, say   they, was OSIRIS born, just at whose entrance into the world a voice   was heard, saying, 'The lord of all the earth is born.' There are some   indeed who relate this circumstance in a different manner, as that a   certain person, named Pamyles, as he was fetching water from the   temple of Jupiter at Thebes, heard a voice commanding him to proclaim   aloud that 'the good and great king Osiris was then born'; and that   for this reason Saturn committed the education of the child to him,   and that in memory of this event the Pamylia were afterwards   instituted, a festival much resembling the Phalliphoria or Priapeia of   the Greeks. Upon the second of these days was AROUERIS [Footnote:   _i.e._, Hera-ur, \"Horus the Elder.\"] born, whom some call Apollo, and   others distinguish by the name of the elder Orus. Upon the third Typho   [Footnote: _i.e._, Set.] came into the world, being born neither at   the proper time, nor by the proper place, but forcing his way through   a wound which he had made in his mother's side. ISIS was born upon the   fourth of them in the marshes of Egypt, as NEPTHYS was upon the last,   whom some call Teleute and Aphrodite, and others Nike--Now as to the   fathers of these children, the two first of them are said to have been   begotten by the Sun, Isis by Mercury, Typho and Nepthys by Saturn; and   accordingly, the third of these superadded days, because it was looked   upon as the birthday of Typho, was regarded by the kings as   inauspicious, and consequently they neither transacted any business on   it, or even suffered themselves to take any refreshment until the   evening. They further add, that Typho married Nepthys; and that Isis   and Osiris, having a mutual affection, loved each other in their   mother's womb before they were born, and that from this commerce   sprang Aroueris, whom the Egyptians likewise call the elder Orus, and   the Greeks Apollo.    \"Osiris, being now become king of Egypt, applied himself towards   civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former indigent   and barbarous course of life; he moreover taught them how to cultivate   and improve the fruits of the earth; he gave them a body of laws to   regulate their conduct by, and instructed them in that reverence and   worship which they were to pay to the gods. With the same good   disposition he afterwards travelled over the rest of the world   inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline; not indeed   compelling them by force of arms, but persuading them to yield to the   strength of his reasons, which were conveyed to them in the most   agreeable manner, in hymns and songs, accompanied by instruments of   music: from which last circumstance the Greeks conclude him to have   been the same with their Dionysius or Bacchus--During Osiris' absence   from his kingdom, Typho had no opportunity of making any innovations   in the state, Isis being extremely vigilant in the government, and   always upon her guard. After his return, however, having first   persuaded seventy-two other persons to join with him in the   conspiracy, together with a certain queen of Ethiopia named Aso, who   chanced to be in Egypt at that time, he contrived a proper stratagem   to execute his base designs. For having privily taken the measure of   Osiris' body, he caused a chest to be made exactly of the same size   with it, as beautiful as may be, and set off with all the ornaments of   art. This chest he brought into his banqueting-room; where, after it   had been much admired by all who were present, Typho, as it were in   jest, promised to give it to any one of them whose body upon trial it   might be found to fit. Upon this the whole company one after another,   go into it; but as it did not fit any of them, last of all Osiris lays   himself down in it, upon which the conspirators immediately ran   together, clapped the cover upon it, and then fastened it down on the   outside with nails, pouring likewise melted lead over it. After this   they carried it away to the river side, and conveyed it to the sea by   the Tanaïtic mouth of the Nile; which, for this reason, is still held   in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and never named by them   but with proper marks of detestation. These things, say they, were   thus executed upon the 17th [Footnote: In the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11277"],["title","Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life (#7)"],["body","calendar this   day was marked triply unlucky.] day of the month Athyr, when the sun   was in Scorpio, in the 28th year of Osiris' reign; though there are   others who tell us that he was no more than 28 years old at this time.    \"The first who knew the accident which had befallen their king were   the Pans and Satyrs who inhabited the country about Chemmis   (Panopolis); and they immediately acquainting the people with the news   gave the first occasion to the name Panic Terrors, which has ever   since been made use of to signify any sudden affright or amazement of   a multitude. As to Isis, as soon as the report reached her she   immediately cut off one of the locks of her hair, [Footnote: The hair   cut off as a sign of mourning was usually laid in the tomb of the   dead.] and put on mourning apparel upon the very spot where she then   happened to be, which accordingly from this accident has ever since   been called Koptis, or _the city of mourning_, though some are of   opinion that this word rather signifies _deprivation_. After this she   wandered everywhere about the country full of disquietude and   perplexity in search, of the chest, inquiring of every person she met   with, even, of some children whom she chanced to see, whether they   knew what was become of it. Now it happened that these children had   seen what Typho's accomplices had done with the body, and accordingly   acquainted her by what mouth of the Nile it had been conveyed into the   sea--For this reason therefore the Egyptians look upon children as   endued with a kind of faculty of divining, and in consequence of this   notion are very curious in observing the accidental prattle which they   have with one another whilst they are at play (especially if it be in   a sacred place), forming omens and presages from it--Isis, during this   interval, having been informed that Osiris, deceived by her sister   Nepthys who was in love with him, had unwittingly united with her   instead of herself, as she concluded from the melilot-garland,   [Footnote: _i.e._, a wreath of clover.] which he had left with her,   made it her business likewise to search out the child, the fruit of   this unlawful commerce (for her sister, dreading the anger of her   husband Typho, had exposed it as soon as it was born), and   accordingly, after much pains and difficulty, by means of some dogs   that conducted her to the place where it was, she found it and bred it   up; so that in process of time it became her constant guard and   attendant, and from hence obtained the name of Anubis, being thought   to watch and guard the gods, as dogs do mankind.    \"At length she receives more particular news of the chest, that it had   been carried by the waves of the sea to the coast of Byblos,   [Footnote: Not the Byblos of Syria (Jebêl) but the papyrus swamps of   the Delta.] and there gently lodged in the branches of a bush of   Tamarisk, which, in a short time, had shot up into a large and   beautiful tree, growing round the chest and enclosing it on every   side, so that it was not to be seen; and farther, that the king of the   country, amazed at its unusual size, had cut the tree down, and made   that part of the trunk wherein the chest was concealed, a pillar to   support; the roof of his house. These things, say they, being made   known to Isis in an extraordinary manner by the report of Demons, sue   immediately went to Byblos; where, setting herself down by the side of   a fountain, she refused to speak to anybody, excepting only to the   queen's women who chanced to be there; these indeed she saluted and   caressed in the kindest manner possible, plaiting their hair for them,   and transmitting into them part of that wonderfully grateful odour   which issued from her own body. This raised a great desire in the   queen their mistress to see the stranger who had this admirable   faculty of transfusing so fragrant a smell from herself into the hair   and skin of other people. She therefore sent for her to court, and,   after a further acquaintance with her, made her nurse to one of her   sons. Now the name of the king who reigned at this time at Byblos, was   Meloarthus, as that of his queen was Astarte, or, according to others,   Saosis, though some call her Nemanoun, which answers to the Greek name   Athenais.    \"Isis fed the child by giving it her finger to suck instead of the   breast; she likewise put him every night into the fire in order to   consume his mortal part, whilst transforming herself into a swallow,   she hovered round the pillar and bemoaned her sad fate. Thus continued   she to do for some time, till the queen, who stood watching her,   observing the child to be all in a flame, cryed out, and thereby   deprived him of that immortality which would otherwise have been   conferred upon him. The Goddess upon this, discovering herself,   requested that the pillar, which supported the roof, might be given   her; which she accordingly took down, and then easily cutting it open,   after she had taken, out what she wanted, she wrapped up the remainder   of the trunk in fine linnen, and pouring perfumed oil upon it,   delivered it again into the hands of the king and queen (which piece   of wood is to this day preserved in the temple of Isis, and worshipped   by the people of Byblos). When this was done, she threw herself upon   the chest, making at the same time such a loud and terrible   lamentation over it, as frightened the younger of the king's sons, who   heard her, out of his life. But the elder of them she took with, her   and set sail with the chest for Egypt; and it being now about morning,   the river Phaedrus sending forth a rough and sharp air, she in her   anger dried up its current.    \"No sooner was she arrived at a desart place, where she imagined   herself to be alone, but she presently opened the chest, and laying   her face upon her dead husband's, embraced his corpse, and wept   bitterly; but, perceiving that the little boy had silently stolen   behind her, and found out the occasion of her grief, she turned   herself about on the sudden, and in her anger gave him so fierce and   stern a look that he immediately died of the affright. Others indeed   say that his death did not happen in this manner, but, as was hinted   above, that he fell into the sea, and afterwards received the greatest   honours on account of the Goddess; for that the Maneros, [Footnote: A   son of the first Egyptian king, who died in his early youth; see   Herodotus, ii. 79.] whom the Egyptians so frequently call upon in   their banquets, is none other than this very boy. This relation is   again contradicted by such as tell us that the true name of the child   was Palaestinus, or Pelusius, and that the city of this name was built   by the Goddess in memory of him; adding farther, that the Maneros   above mentioned is thus honoured by the Egyptians at their feasts,   because he was the first who invented music. There are others, again,   who affirm that Maneros is not the name of any particular person, but   a mere customary form, and complimental manner of greeting made use of   by the Egyptians one towards another at their more solemn feasts and   banquets, meaning no more by it, than to wish, that what they were   then about might prove fortunate and happy to them, for that this is   the true import of the word. In like manner, say they, the human   skeleton, which at these times of jollity is carried about in a box,   and shewn to all the guests, is not designed, as some imagine, to   represent the particular misfortunes of Osiris, but rather to remind   them of their mortality, and thereby to excite them freely to make use   of and to enjoy the good things which are set before them, seeing they   must quickly become such as they there saw; and that this is the true   reason of introducing it at their banquets--but to proceed in the   narration.    \"Isis intending a visit to her son Orus, who was brought up at Butus,   deposited the chest in the meanwhile in a remote and unfrequented   place: Typho however, as he was one night hunting by the light of the   moon, accidentally met with it; and knowing the body which was   enclosed in it, tore it into several pieces, fourteen, in all,   dispersing them up and down, in different parts of the country--Upon   being made acquainted with this event, Isis once more sets out in   search of the scattered fragments of her husband's body, making use of   a boat made of the reed Papyrus in order the more easily to pass thro'   the lower and fenny parts of the country--For which, reason, say they,   the crocodile never touches any persons, who sail in this sort of   vessels, as either fearing the anger of the goddess, or else   respecting it on account of its having once carried her. To this   occasion therefore is it to be imputed, that there are so many   different sepulchres of Osiris shewn, in Egypt; for we are told, that   wherever Isis met with any of the scattered limbs of her husband, she   there buried it. There are others however who contradict this   relation, and tell us, that this variety of Sepulchres was owing   rather to the policy of the queen, who, instead of the real body, as   was pretended, presented these several cities with the image only of   her husband: and that she did this, not only to render the honours,   which would by this means be paid to his memory, more extensive, but   likewise that she might hereby elude the malicious search of Typho;   who, if he got the better of Orus in the war wherein they were going   to be engaged, distracted by this multiplicity of Sepulchres, might   despair of being able to find the true one--we are told moreover, that   notwithstanding all her search, Isis was never able to recover the   member of Osiris, which having been thrown into the Nile immediately   upon its separation from the rest of the body, had been devoured by   the Lepidotus, the Phagrus,"]]]
