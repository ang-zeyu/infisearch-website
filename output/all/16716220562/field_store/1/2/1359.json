He'd got pretty interested in mining and figured he wanted to know all about how the fancy things was done. So he sent off to some correspondence schools. Well, they're a great bunch. They say: 'Write us a lot of letters and ask us your questions. Before you're through you'll know something you want to know.' See?\"  \"I see.\"  \"I didn't have anything special I wanted to learn except how to use myself for company when I got tired of solitaire. So I sat down and wrote to this here correspondence school and says: 'I want to do something interesting. How d'you figure that I had better begin?' And what d'you think they answered back?\"  \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky, his interest steadily increasing.  \"Well, sir, the first thing they wrote back was: 'We have your letter and think that in the first place you had better learn how to write.' That was a queer answer, wasn't it?\"  \"It sure was.\" Ronicky swallowed a smile.  \"Every time I looked at that letter it sure made me plumb mad. And I looked at it a hundred times a day and come near tearing it up every time. But I didn't,\" continued Bill.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because it was a woman that wrote it. I told by the hand, after a while!\"  \"A woman? Go on, Bill. This story sure sounds different from most.\"  \"It ain't even started to get different yet,\" said Bill gloomily. \"Well, that letter made me so plumb mad that I sat down and wrote everything I could think of that a gent would say to a girl to let her know what I thought about her. And what d'you think happened?\"  \"She wrote you back the prettiest letter you ever seen,\" suggested Ronicky, \"saying as how she'd never meant to make you mad and that if you--\"  \"Say,\" broke in Bill Gregg, \"did I show that letter to you?\"  \"Nope; I just was guessing at what a lot of women would do. You see?\"  \"No, I don't. I could never figure them as close as that. Anyway that's the thing she done, right enough. She writes me a letter that was smooth as oil and suggests that I go on with a composition course to learn how to write.\"  \"Going to have you do books, Bill?\"  \"I ain't a plumb fool, Ronicky. But I thought it wouldn't do me no harm to unlimber my pen and fire out a few words a day. So I done it. I started writing what they told me to write about, the things that was around me, with a lot of lessons about how you can't use the same word twice on one page, and how terrible bad it is to use too many passive verbs.\"  \"What's a passive verb, Bill?\"  \"I didn't never figure it out, exactly. However, it seems like they're something that slows you up the way a muddy road slows up a hoss. And then she begun talking about the mountains, and then she begun asking--  \"About you!\" suggested Ronicky with a grin.  \"Confound you,\" said Bill Gregg. \"How come you guessed that?\"  \"I dunno. I just sort of scented what was coming.\"  \"Well, anyways, that's what she done. And pretty soon she sent me a snapshot of herself. Well--\"  \"Lemme see it,\" said Ronicky Doone calmly.  \"I dunno just where it is, maybe,\" replied Bill Gregg.  \"Ill tell you. It's right around your neck, in that nugget locket you wear there.\"  For a moment Bill Gregg hated the other with his eyes, and then he submitted with a sheepish grin, took off the locket, which was made of one big nugget rudely beaten into shape, and opened it for the benefit of Ronicky Doone. It showed the latter not a beautiful face, but a pretty one with a touch of honesty and pride that made her charming.  \"Well, as soon as I got that picture,\" said Bill Gregg, as he took back the locket, \"I sure got excited. Looked to me like that girl was made for me. A lot finer than I could ever be, you see, but simple; no fancy frills, no raving beauty, maybe, but darned easy to look at.  \"First thing I done I went in and got a copy of my face made and rushed it right back at her and then--\" He stopped dolefully. \"What d'you think, Ronicky?\"  \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky; \"what happened then?\"  \"Nothing, not a thing. Not a word came back from her to answer that letter I'd sent along.\"  \"Maybe you didn't look rich enough to suit her, Bill.\"  \"I thought that, and I thought it was my ugly face that might of made her change her mind. I thought of pretty near everything else that was bad about me and that she might of read in my face. Sure made me sick for a long time. Somebody else was correcting my lessons, and that made me sicker than ever.  \"So I sat down and wrote a letter to the head of the school and told him I'd like to get the address of that first girl. You see, I didn't even know her name. But I didn't get no answer.\"  Ronicky groaned. \"It don't look like the best detective in the world could help you to find a girl when you don't know her name.\" He added gently: \"But maybe she don't want you to find her?\"  \"I thought that for a long time. Then, a while back, I got a letter from San Francisco, saying that she was coming on a train through these parts and could I be in Stillwater because the train stopped there a couple of minutes. Most like she thought Stillwater was just sort of across the street from me. Matter of fact, I jumped on a hoss, and it took me three days of breaking my neck to get near Stillwater and then--\" He stopped and cast a gloomy look on his companion.  \"I know,\" said Ronicky. \"Then I come and spoiled the whole party. Sure makes me sick to think about it.\"  \"And now she's plumb gone,\" muttered Bill Gregg. \"I thought maybe the reason I didn't have her correcting my lessons any more was because she'd had to leave the schools and go West. So, right after I got this drilling through the leg, you remember, I wrote a letter?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"It was to her at the schools, but I didn't get no answer. I guess she didn't go back there after all. She's plumb gone, Ronicky.\"  The other was silent for a moment. \"How much would you give to find her?\" he asked suddenly.  \"Half my life,\" said Bill Gregg solemnly.  \"Then,\" said Ronicky, \"we'll make a try at it. I got an idea how we can start on the trail. I'm going to go with you, partner. I've messed up considerable, this little game of yours; now I'm going to do what I can to straighten it out. Sometimes two are better than one. Anyway I'm going to stick with you till you've found her or lost her for good. You see?\"  Bill Gregg sighed. \"You're pretty straight, Ronicky,\" he said, \"but what good does it do for two gents to look for a needle in a haystack? How could we start to hit the trail?\"  \"This way. We know the train that she took. Maybe we could find the Pullman conductor that was on it, and he might remember her. They got good memories, some of those gents. We'll start to find him, which had ought to be pretty easy.\"  \"Ronicky, I'd never of thought of that in a million years!\"  \"It ain't thinking that we want now, it's acting. When can you start with me?\"  \"I'll be fit tomorrow.\"  \"Then tomorrow we start.\"     Chapter Five   _Macklin's Library_  Robert Macklin, Pullman conductor, had risen to that eminent position so early in life that the glamour of it had not yet passed away. He was large enough to have passed for a champion wrestler or a burly pugilist, and he was small enough to glory in the smallest details of his work. Having at the age of thirty, through a great deal of luck and a touch of accident, secured his place, he possessed, at least, sufficient dignity to fill it.  He was one of those rare men who carry their dignity with them past the doors of their homes. Robert Macklin's home, during the short intervals when he was off the trains, was in a tiny apartment. It was really one not overly large room, with a little alcove adjoining; but Robert Macklin had seized the opportunity to hang a curtain across the alcove, and, since it was large enough to contain a chair and a bookshelf, he referred to it always as his \"library.\"  He was this morning seated in his library, with his feet protruding through the curtains and resting on the foot of his bed, when the doorbell rang. He surveyed himself in his mirror before he answered it. Having decided that, in his long dressing gown, he was imposing enough, he advanced to the door and slowly opened it.  He saw before him two sun-darkened men whose soft gray hats proclaimed that they were newly come out of the West. The one was a fellow whose face had been made stern by hard work and few pleasures in life. The other was one who, apparently, had never worked at all. There was something about him that impressed Robert Macklin. He might be a young Western millionaire, for instance. Aside from his hat he was dressed with elaborate care. He wore gray spats, and his clothes were obviously well tailored, and his necktie was done in a bow. On the whole he was a very cool, comfortable looking chap. The handkerchief, which protruded from his breast pocket and showed an edging of red, was a trifle noisy; and the soft gray hat was hardly in keeping, but, on the whole, he was a dashing-looking chap. The bagging trousers and the blunt-toed shoes of his companion were to Robert Macklin a distinct shock. He centered all of his attention instantly on the younger of his two visitors.  \"You're Mr. Macklin, I guess,\" said the handsome man.  \"I am,\" said Macklin, and, stepping back from his door, he invited them in with a sweeping gesture.  There were only two chairs, but the younger of the strangers immediately made himself comfortable on the bed.  \"My name's Doone,\" he said, \"and this is Mr. William Gregg. We think that you have some information which we can use. Mind if we fire a few questions?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said Robert Macklin. At the same time he began to arm himself with caution. One could never tell.  \"Matter of fact,\" went on Ronicky smoothly, lighting a tailor-made cigarette, while his companion rolled one of his own making, \"we are looking for a lady who was on one of your trains. We think you may possibly remember her. Here's the picture.\"  And, as he passed the snapshot to the Pullman conductor, he went on with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],["title","Ronicky Doone (#4)"],["body","of the date and the number of the train.  Robert Macklin in the meantime studied the picture carefully. He had a keen eye for faces, but when it came to pretty faces his memory was a veritable lion. He had talked a few moments with this very girl, and she had smiled at him. The memory made Robert Macklin's lips twitch just a trifle, and Ronicky Doone saw it.  Presently the dignitary returned the picture and raised his head from thought. \"It is vaguely behind my mind, something about this lady,\" he said. \"But I'm sorry to say, gentlemen, I really don't know you and--\"  \"Why, don't you know us!\" broke in Bill Gregg. \"Ain't my partner here just introduced us?\"  \"Exactly,\" said Robert Macklin. And his opinion of the two sank a full hundred points. Such grammar proclaimed a ruffian.  \"You don't get his drift,\" Ronicky was explaining to his companion. \"I introduced us, but he doesn't know who I am. We should have brought along a letter of introduction.\" He turned to Macklin. \"I am mighty sorry I didn't get one,\" he said.  It came to Macklin for the fraction of a second that he was being mocked, but he instantly dismissed the foolish thought. Even the rough fellows must be able to recognize a man when they saw one.  \"The point is,\" went on Ronicky gently, \"that my friend is very eager for important reasons to see this lady, to find her. And he doesn't even know her name.\" Here his careful grammar gave out with a crash. \"You can't beat a deal like that, eh, Macklin? If you can remember anything about her, her name first, then, where she was bound, who was with her, how tall she is, the color of her eyes, we'd be glad to know anything you know. What can you do for us?\"  Macklin cleared his throat thoughtfully. \"Gentlemen,\" he said gravely, \"if I knew the purpose for which you are seeking the lady I--\"  \"The purpose ain't to kidnap her, if that's your drift,\" said Ronicky. \"We ain't going to treat her wrong, partner. Out in our part of the land they don't do it. Just shake up your thoughts and see if something about that girl doesn't pop right into your head.\"  Robert Macklin smiled and carefully shook his head. \"It seems to be impossible for me to remember a thing,\" he asserted.  \"Not even the color of her eyes?\" asked Ronicky, as he grinned. He went on more gravely: \"I'm pretty dead sure that you do remember something about her.\"  There was just the shade of a threat in the voice of this slender youngster, and Robert Macklin had been an amateur pugilist of much brawn and a good deal of boxing skill. He cast a wary eye on Ronicky; one punch would settle that fellow. The man Gregg might be a harder nut to crack, but it would not take long to finish them both. Robert Macklin thrust his shoulders forward.  \"Friends,\" he said gruffly, \"I don't have much time off. This is my day for rest. I have to say good-by.\"  Ronicky Doone stood up with a yawn. \"I thought so,\" he said to his companion. \"Mind the door, Gregg, and see that nobody steps in and busts up my little party.\"  \"What are you going to do?\"  \"Going to argue with this gent in a way he'll understand a pile better than the chatter we've been making so far.\" He stepped a long light pace forward. \"Macklin, you know what we want to find out. Will you talk?\"  A cloud of red gathered before the eyes of Macklin. It was impossible that he must believe his ears, and yet the words still rang there.  \"Why, curse your little rat-face!\" burst out Robert Macklin, and, stepping in, he leaned forward with a perfect straight left.  Certainly his long vacation from boxing had not ruined his eye or stiffened his muscles. With delight he felt all the big sinews about his shoulders come into play. Straight and true the big fist drove into the face of the smaller man, but Robert Macklin found that he had punched a hole in thin air. It was as if the very wind of the blow had brushed the head of Ronicky Doone to one side, and at the same time he seemed to sway and stagger forward.  A hard lean fist struck Robert Macklin's body. As he gasped and doubled up, clubbing his right fist to land the blow behind the ear of Ronicky Doone, the latter bent back, stepped in and, rising on the toes of both feet, whipped a perfect uppercut that, in ring parlance, rang the bell.  The result was that Robert Macklin, his mouth agape and his eyes dull, stood wobbling slowly from side to side.  \"Here!\" called Ronicky to his companion at the door. \"Grab him on one side, and I'll take the other. He's out on his feet. Get him to that chair.\" With Gregg's assistance he dragged the bulk of the man there. Macklin was still stunned.  Presently the dull eyes cleared and filled immediately with horror. Big Robert Macklin sank limply back in the chair.  \"I've no money,\" he said. \"I swear I haven't a cent in the place. It's in the bank, but if a check will--\"  \"We don't want your money this trip,\" said Ronicky. \"We want talk, Macklin. A lot of talk and a lot of true talk. Understand? It's about that girl. I saw you grin when you saw the picture; you remember her well enough. Now start talking, and remember this, if you lie, I'll come back here and find out and use this on you.\"  The eyes of Robert Macklin started from his head, as his gaze concentrated on the black muzzle of the gun. He moistened his white lips and managed to gasp: \"Everything I know, of course. Ill tell you everything, word for word. She--she--her name I mean--\"  \"You're doing fine,\" said Ronicky. \"Keep it up, and you keep away, Bill. When you come at him with that hungry look he thinks you're going to eat him up. Fire away, Macklin.\"  \"What first?\"  \"What's she look like?\"  \"Soft brown hair, blue eyes, her mouth--\"  \"Is a little big. That's all right. You don't have to be polite and lie. We want the truth. How big is she?\"  \"About five feet and five inches, must weigh around a hundred and thirty pounds.\"  \"You sure are an expert on the ladies, Macklin, and I'll bet you didn't miss her name?\"  \"Her name?\"  \"Don't tell me you missed out on that!\"  \"No. It was--Just a minute!\"  \"Take your time.\"  \"Caroline.\"  \"Take your time now, Macklin, you're doing fine. Don't get confused. Get the last name right. It's the most important to us.\"  \"I have it, I'm sure. The whole name is Caroline Smith.\"  There was a groan from Ronicky Doone and another from Bill Gregg.  \"That's a fine name to use for trailing a person. Did she say anything more, anything about where she expected to be living in New York?\"  \"I don't remember any more,\" said Macklin sullenly, for the spot where Ronicky's fist landed on his jaw was beginning to ache. \"I didn't sit down and have any chats with her. She just spoke to me once in a while when I did something for her. I suppose you fellows have some crooked work on hand for her?\"  \"We're bringing her good news,\" said Ronicky calmly. \"Now see if you can't remember where she said she lived in New York.\" And he gave added point to his question by pressing the muzzle of the revolver a little closer to the throat of the Pullman conductor. The latter blinked and swallowed hard.  \"The only thing I remember her saying was that she could see the East River from her window, I think.\"  \"And that's all you know?\"  \"Yes, not a thing more about her to save my life.\"  \"Maybe what you know has saved it,\" said Ronicky darkly.  His victim eyed him with sullen malevolence. \"Maybe there'll be a new trick or two in this game before it's finished. I'll never forget you, Doone, and you, Gregg.\"  \"You haven't a thing in the world on us,\" replied Ronicky.  \"I have the fact that you carry concealed weapons.\"  \"Only this time.\"  \"Always! Fellows like you are as lonesome without a gun as they are without a skin.\"  Ronicky turned at the door and laughed back at the gloomy face, and then they were gone down the steps and into the street.     Chapter Six   _The New York Trail_  On the train to New York that night they carefully summed up their prospects and what they had gained.  \"We started at pretty near nothing,\" said Ronicky. He was a professional optimist. \"We had a picture of a girl, and we knew she was on a certain train bound East, three or four weeks ago. That's all we knew. Now we know her name is Caroline Smith, and that she lives where she can see the East River out of her back window. I guess that narrows it down pretty close, doesn't it, Bill?\"  \"Close?\" asked Bill. \"Close, did you say?\" \"Well, we know the trail,\" said Ronicky cheerily. \"All we've got to do is to locate the shack that stands beside that trail. For old mountain men like us that ought to be nothing. What sort of a stream is this East River, though?\"  Bill Gregg looked at his companion in disgust. He had become so used to regarding Doone as entirely infallible that it amazed and disheartened him to find that there was one topic so large about which Ronicky knew nothing. Perhaps the whole base for the good cheer of Ronicky was his ignorance of everything except the mountain desert.  \"A river's a river,\" went on Ronicky blandly. \"And it's got a town beside it, and in the town there's a house that looks over the water. Why, Bill, she's as good as found!\"  \"New York runs about a dozen miles along the shore of that river,\" groaned Bill Gregg.  \"A dozen miles!\" gasped Ronicky. He turned in his seat and stared at his companion. \"Bill, you sure are making a man-sized joke. There ain't that much city in the world. A dozen miles of houses, one right next to the other?\"  \"Yep, and one on top of the other. And that ain't all. Start about the center of that town and swing a twenty-mile line around it, and the end of the line will be passing through houses most of the way.\"  Ronicky Doone glared at him in positive alarm. \"Well,\" he said, \"that's different.\"  \"It sure is. I guess we've come on a wild-goose chase, Ronicky, hunting for a girl named Smith that lives on the bank of the East River!\" He laughed bitterly.  \"How come you know so much about New York?\" asked Ronicky, eager to turn the subject of"]]]
