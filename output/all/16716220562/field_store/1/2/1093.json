But on the other hand there must necessarily have existed a certain resentment against him for his ruthless and effective diplomacy. It would no doubt afford Javert a pleasant sensation to take it out on any one appearing in any way as a protégé of Van Hee.  \"Yes, it's Van Hee's signature all right,\" muttered Javert with a shrug of his shoulders, \"only he is not the consul, but the vice- consul at Ghent and let us remember that he is of Belgian ancestry--that wouldn't incline him to deep friendship with us.\"  On a card of introduction from Ambassador Van Dyke there were the words \"Writer for The Outlook.\" It's hard to understand how that escaped my very scrutinous search, but there it was.  \"Another anti-German magazine,\" commented, sardonically. I was marveling at the uncanny display of knowledge of this man at the center of the European maelstrom, aware of the editorial policy of an American magazine.  \"But that doesn't mean that I am anti-German,\" I protested; \"we can retain our own private opinions.\"  \"Tommyrot,\" exclaimed Javert, \"tommy-rot!\" Strange language in a military court! Where had he laid hold of that choice bit of our vernacular?  \"You know perchance,\" he continued, \"what the penalty is for newspaper men caught on the German side.\" I thought that surely I was going to reap the result of the adverse reports that the American correspondents had made already about the Germans, when he added, \"But you are here on a different charge.\"  The judge started to cross-examine me as to all my antecedents. My replies were in German--or purported to be--but in my eagerness to clear myself I must have wrought awful havoc with that classic language. I was forthwith ordered to talk English and direct my remarks to Javert, acting now as interpreter. In the midst of this procedure Javert, with a quick sudden stroke, produced the scribble-paper which he had seized in the morning, held it fairly in my face, and cried, \"Whose writing is that?\" The others all riveted their gaze upon me.  I replied calmly, \"It is mine.\"  \"I want you to put it into full, complete writing,\" cried Javert. \"As it now stands it is a telegraphic code.\"  That is the most complimentary remark that has ever been made upon my hieroglyphics. However, I shall be eternally grateful to Providence for my Horace Greeley style. For, while that document contained by no means any military secrets, there were, on the other hand, uncomplimentary observations about the Germans. It would not be good strategy to let these fall into their hands in their present mood. At Javert's behest, I set to work on my paper, and delivered to him in ten minutes a free, full, rapid translation of the abbreviated contents. On inspecting it Javert said, irritably, \"I want an exact, precise transcript of everything here.\"  \"I thought you wanted it in a hurry,\" I rejoined.  \"No hurry at all. We have ample time to fix your case.\"  These words do not sound a bit threatening, but it was the general setting in which they were said that made them so ominous, and which set the cold waves rippling up and down my spinal column.  I set to work again, numbering every phrase in my scribble-paper, and then in the same number on the other paper giving a full, readable translation of it. I wrote out the things complimentary to the Germans in the fullest manner. But how was I going to take the sting out of the adverse comments?  Phrase No. 1 meant \"Musical nature of the German automobile horns.\" Their silver and flute-like notes had been a pleasing sound, rolling along the roads. That was good.  Phrase No. 2 meant \"The moderation of the Germans in not billeting more troops upon the hotels.\" I wondered why they had not commandeered quarters in more of the big empty hotels instead of compelling men to sleep in railway stations and in the open air. That was good.  Phrase No. 3 meant \"German officers never refused to contribute to the Belgian Relief Funds.\" These boxes were constantly shaken before them in every cafe, and not once was a box passed to an officer in vain. For all this I was very grateful and everything went on very merrily until I came to phrase Number 4.  \"If Bel I wld join posse Ger myself\"; which, being interpreted, reads, \"If I were a Belgian, I would join a posse against the Germans myself.\" That looked ugly, but I wanted to record for myself the ugly mood of resentment I had felt when I saw Belgians compelled to submit to certain humiliations and indignities from their invading conquerors.  German or non-German--it makes no difference; any one who had seen those swaggering officers riding it rough-shod over those poor peasants would have felt the same tide of indignation mounting up in him. In that mood it would have given me genuine pleasure to have joined a little killing-party and wiped out those officers. Now these self-same officers were gathered round me trying to decide whether they were to have a little killing-party on their own account.  There was sufficient justification for inciting their wrath in that one sentence as it stood, and they were all combining to entrap me by every possible means. Furthermore, they were hankering for a victim. I had only my wits to match against their desires. I cudgeled my brains as I never did before, but to no avail. Almost panic- stricken I was ready to give up in despair and throw myself upon the mercy of the court when, like a flash of inspiration, the right reading came. I transcribed that ugly phrase now to read: \"If I were among the Belgians, I would join possibly the Germans myself.\" What more could the most ardent German patriot ask for? That met every abbreviation and made a beautifully exact reversal of the intended meaning. Not as an example in ethics, but as a \"safety first\" exhibit I must confess to a real pride in that piece of work. I handed it over with the cherubic expression of the prize- scholar in the Sunday School.  Javert had figured on finding incriminating data in it. It was to be his chief evidence. He read it over with increasing disappointment and gave it the minutest analysis, comparing it closely with the original scribble-paper. For example, he called the attention of the judge to the fact that \"guarded\" in one paper was spelled \"gaurded\" in the other--some slip I had inadvertently made. He thought it might now be made a clew to some secret code, but, though he puzzled long and searchingly over the document, he extracted from it nothing more than an increased vexation of spirit.  \"Nothing on the surface here,\" Javert said to the judge; \"but that only makes it look the more suspicious. Wait till we hear from the search of his room.\"  At this juncture a man in civilian dress arrived, and, handing over the key of Room Number 502, reported that there was nothing to bring back. This nettled Javert, and he made and X-ray examination of my person, even tearing out the lining of my hat. Alas for him too late; his search disclosed nothing more damnatory than a French dictionary, which, because I was not an ostrich, I had been unable to get away with in the afternoon. A few addresses had been scribbled therein. He demanded a full account of each name. Some I had really forgotten.  \"That's strange,\" he sneered; \"perhaps you don't find it convenient to remember who they are.\"  Up till now I hadn't the slightest conception of the charge laid against me. Suddenly the judge crashed into the affair and took the initiative.  \"Why did you offer money to find out the movement of German troops!\" he let go at me across the table in a loud voice.  At the same time his aides converged on me a full, searching gaze. Going all day without food, for eight hours confined in a fetid atmosphere, and for two hours grilled by a dozen inquisitors, is an ordeal calculated to put the nerves of the strongest on edge.  I simply replied, \"I didn't do any such thing.\"  \"Don't lie!\" \"Tell the whole truth!\" \"Make a clean breast of it!\" \"No use holding anything back!\" \"We have the witnesses who will swear you did!\" \"Best thing for you is to tell all you know!\"  This fusillade of command and accusation they roared and bellowed at me, aiming to break down my defense with the suddenness of the onslaught. They succeeded for a moment. I couldn't rally my scattered and worn-out wits to think what the basis of this preposterous charge might be.  Then I remembered a Dutchman who had accosted me the day before on a street-car. He had volunteered the information that he was taking people by automobile out through Liege into Holland, giving one thus the opportunity to see a great many troops and ruins along the way. I told him I had some money and would be glad to invest in such a trip, at the same time giving him my address at the Hotel Metropole. Guileless as he appeared, he turned out to be an agent of the German Government. He naturally wanted to make himself solid with his masters by delivering the goods, so he had twisted all my words into the most damning evidence, and had fixed up two or three witnesses ready to swear anything.  \"No use wasting time or effort to save this man,\" they told de Leval at the American Embassy, later. \"We've got a cast-iron case against him, with witnesses to back it up.\"  Javert no doubt proved himself an invaluable ally of the Dutchman in fixing up the charges. I don't believe he would manufacture a story out of whole cloth, but once his mind was set in a certain direction he could build up a good one on very shaky foundations. Perhaps he had an animus against these bumptious, undeferential, overcritical Americans, and thought it was time to give one of them a lesson. Perhaps he was tired of trapping ordinary garden variety spies of the Belgian brand. It would be a pleasing variation in the monotony of convicting defenseless, helpless Belgians if he could show that one of these fellows masquerading as Americans was a sham. Especially one of that journalistic tribe that had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],["title","In the Claws of the German Eagle (#4)"],["body","out reports of German atrocities. Furthermore, it would redound greatly to his professional glory to hand me over to the General with a case proved to the hilt.  There was no trick in the repertory of a prosecutor that was unknown to Javert. He now shifted to the confidential and dropping His voice very low, he said to me:  \"You know that if you make a full, complete confession, I'll promise to do my very best for you. And as a matter of fact you have been under the eyes of our Secret Service ever since you came to Belgium. We are aware of everything that you have done.\"  Was that a bluff or the truth? If it was true then they knew about my capture near Louvain on the day before in suspicious observation of the signaling-balloon. If this was a bluff, then my confession would be simply a case of gratuitously damning myself and likewise endangering my companion of yesterday's adventure--the British lieutenant with the American passport. Yet again if Javert knew all he pretended to, silence about that episode would make it appear doubly heinous. So while with my tongue I retailed a simple, harmless version of my doings in Belgium in my brain I carried on a debate whether to make an avowal of the Louvain escapade or not.  I came to the decision that Javert was just bluffing. Later developments proved me right. He knew nothing about it. Even the German Secret Service is not omniscient. Getting no results then from these wheedling tactics Javert shifted back to his bullying and essayed once more to browbeat me into a confession. Calling to his aid two officers who had been but casual onlookers they began volleying charges at me with machine-gun rapidity.  \"You know that you are a spy.\" \"We know that you are a spy.\" \"Why do you deny it?\" \"You know that you have been lying.\" \"Better own up to all that you have done.\" \"Out with it now!\"  When one officer grew tired, he rested. Then the next one took up the attack, and then he rested. But not one moment's respite for me. I don't know what they call it in German, but it was the third degree with a vengeance. Under this sweating process my nerves were being torn to tatters. I felt like screaming and it seemed that if this continued I would smash an officer with a chair and put an end to it all. But the fact that I am writing these lines shows that I didn't. Human nature is so constituted that it can always endure a little more, and though they kept the tension high for many minutes I did not buckle under the strain. However, I couldn't call up any arguments to show the utter absurdity of the charge against me. And my defense was very feeble.  The onslaught now ceased as suddenly as it had begun. There was a coming and going of officers and some consultation in an undertone. The judge left the room and the impassive-faced Javert began that machine-like writing. After a while he stopped.  \"Will you give me some idea of what you expect to do with me?\" I queried.  \"A full report of your case goes up to the General for decision and sentence,\" was his response.  My spirits took a downward plunge. Then a fierce resentment amounting almost to rage came surging up within me. Masking it as well as I could, I asked permission to send word to the American authorities. Javert's reply was evasive.  \"I have had nothing to eat all day,\" I announced. \"Can't you do something for me?\"  \"Go to that door there and open it,\" said Javert.  I did so and there stood four soldiers of the Kaiser, who ranged themselves two in front and two behind, and marched me away. Javert had a well-developed sense of the dramatic.  While I am excoriating Javert as representing the genius of German officialdom, it is only fair that I should present his antithesis. By continually referring to the German army as a machine one gets the idea that it is an impersonal collection of inhuman beings remorselessly and mechanically devoted to duty. For a broad general impression that is perhaps a fair enough statement to start with; but when I am tempted to let it go at that, there is one striking exception that always rises up to point the finger of denial at this easy and common generalization. It is that of a young German officer, a mere stripling of twenty or thereabouts, with the most frank, open, ingenuous expression. One would expect to find him presiding at a Christian Endeavor social, rather than right here at the very pivot of the most terrible military organization of the world.  I had caught his look riveted upon me in my trial, and recognized him when he came into the detention-room, to which the four soldiers had led me. Hurriedly, he said to me: \"Really, you know, I ought not to come in here, but I heard your story, and it looks rather bad; but somehow I almost believe in you. Tell me the whole truth about your affair.\"  I proceeded vehemently to point out my innocence, when he interrupted my story by asking, \"But why did you make that Schreibfehler on your paper?\" He followed my recital anxiously and sympathetically, and, looking me full in the face, asked, \"Can you tell me on your Ehrenwort (word of honor) that you are not a spy? Remember,\" he added, solemnly, \"on your Ehrenwort.\"  Grasping both of his hands and looking him in the eye, I said, most fervently, \"On my Ehrenwort, I am not a spy.\"  There was an earnestness in my heart that must have communicated itself to my hands, because he winced as he drew his hands away; but he said, \"I shall try to put in a word for you; I can't do much, but I shall do what I can. I must go now. Good-by.\"     Chapter III  A Night On A Prison Floor    \"Prisoners are to be taken over into the left wing for the night,\" said an orderly to the guards.  We had scarcely turned the corner, when an officer cried: \"Not that way, Dummkopf!\"  \"Our orders are for the left wing, sir,\" said the orderly.  \"Never saw such a set of damned blockheads!\" yelled the officer in exasperation. \"Can't you tell the difference between right and left? Right wing, right wing, and hurry up!\"  A little emery had gotten into the perfect-running machine. The corridors fairly clanged with orders and counter orders. After much confusion the general mix-up of prisoners was straightened out and we were served black bread and coffee.  The strain of the day, along with the fever I had from exposure on the battlefields, made the rough food still more uninviting, especially as our only implements of attack were the greasy pocketknives of the peasants and canteen covers from the soldiers. The revolt of my stomach must have communicated itself to my soul. I determined for aggressive action on my own behalf. I resolved to stand unprotesting no longer while a solid case against me was being constructed. Not without a struggle was I to be railroaded off to prison or to Purgatory. Pushing up to the next officer appearing in the room, in firm but courteous tones I requested, as an American citizen, the right to communicate with the American authorities.  He replied very decently that that was quite within my privileges, and forthwith the opportunity would be accorded me. I was looking for paper, when there came the order for all of us to move out into the courtyard. With a line of soldiers on either side, we were marched through labyrinthine passages and up three flights of stairs. Here we were divided into two gangs, my gang being led off into a room already nearly filled. We were told that it was our temporary abode, and we were to make the best of it. It was an administrative office of the Belgian Government now turned into a prison. There were the usual fixtures, including a rug on the floor and shelves of books. Ours was only one of many cells for prisoners scattered through the building. The spy-hunters had swooped down upon every suspect in Belgium and all who had been caught in the dragnet were being dumped into these rooms.  We were thus informed by the officer whose wards we were. He was a fussy, quick-tempered, withal kind-hearted little fellow, and kept dashing in and out of the room, really perplexed over housing accommodations for the night. The spy-hunters had been successful in their work of rounding up their victims from all over the country and corralling them here until the place was filled to overflowing. Our official in charge was puffed up with pride in the prosperity of his institution, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, petulantly belectured us on adding ourselves to his already numerous burdens. This was highly humorous, yet we all feared to commit lese-majeste by expressing to him our collective and personal sorrow for so inconveniencing him, and our willingness to make amends for our thoughtlessness in getting arrested.  After more hesitation than I had hitherto observed, arrangements for the night were completed and we were ordered to draw out blankets from the pile in the corner. The new arrivals and the old inmates maneuvered for the softest spots on the floor, which was soon covered over with bodies and their sprawling limbs, while a host of guards, fully armed, were posted at the door and along the hall.  \"I would give my right arm or my leg if I could get a flashlight of this,\" said Obels, the reporter, enthusiastically. This elation made him reckless as he went about, probing the experiences of each victim.  \"Great stuff!\" \"Great stuff!\" he kept exclaiming. \"Won't this open up some eyes in Chicago, eh!\"  He couldn't believe that the Providence which had led him to this Bonanza would now deny him the opportunity of getting out some of this wealth.  In the midst of these activities he was haled before the tribunal. He returned, the spring out of his step and his zest for stories quite gone. Javert had successively branded him an \"Idiot\" a \"Liar\" and a \"Spy.\"  The information that several of the inmates had been imprisoned for a month or more spurred my drooping spirits and put me into action. I uncovered a pile of the office writing-paper and, with the aid of the Belgian who"]]]
