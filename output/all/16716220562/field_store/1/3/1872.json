Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France?”  “He is dead, sir; a great loss. His devotion to the queen was boundless; men of loyalty are scarce.”  “I think so, forsooth,” said Rochefort, “and when you find any of them, you march them off to the Bastile. However, there are plenty in the world, but you don’t look in the right direction for them, my lord.”  “Indeed! explain to me. Ah! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal! Ah! he was a great man.”  “Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson?”  “I! never! you know you may say anything to me. I try to be beloved, not feared.”  “Well, there is on the wall of my cell, scratched with a nail, a proverb, which says, ‘Like master, like servant.’”  “Pray, what does that mean?”  “It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants, dozens and dozens of them.”  “He! the point aimed at by every poniard! Richelieu, who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him!”  “But he did ward them off,” said De Rochefort, “and the reason was, that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends. I have known persons,” he continued—for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of D’Artagnan—“who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu; who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies; persons without money, without support, without credit, yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon.”  “But those men you speak of,” said Mazarin, smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him, “those men were not devoted to the cardinal, for they contended against him.”  “No; in that case they would have met with more fitting reward. They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants.”  “But how is it that you know so much of these matters?”  “I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my enemies; because they fought against me; because I did them all the harm I could and they returned it to the best of their ability; because one of them, with whom I had most to do, gave me a pretty sword-thrust, now about seven years ago, the third that I received from the same hand; it closed an old account.”  “Ah!” said Mazarin, with admirable suavity, “could I but find such men!”  “My lord, there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe, and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you.”  “Who is it?”  “It is Monsieur d’Artagnan.”  “That Gascon!” cried Mazarin, with well acted surprise.  “‘That Gascon’ has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent, address and political skill, to him he was only a tyro.”  “Really?”  “It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excellency.”  “Tell me a little about it, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort.”  “That is somewhat difficult, my lord,” said Rochefort, with a smile.  “Then he will tell it me himself.”  “I doubt it, my lord.”  “Why do you doubt it?”  “Because the secret does not belong to him; because, as I have told you, it has to do with a great queen.”  “And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?”  “No, my lord, he had three colleagues, three brave men, men such as you were wishing for just now.”  “And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?”  “As if they had been one man—as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast.”  “You pique my curiosity, dear Rochefort; pray tell me the whole story.”  “That is impossible; but I will tell you a true story, my lord.”  “Pray do so, I delight in stories,” cried the cardinal.  “Listen, then,” returned Rochefort, as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal’s motive. “Once upon a time there lived a queen—a powerful monarch—who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much to injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well. (Do not try, my lord, you cannot guess who it is; all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned.) There came to the court an ambassador so brave, so magnificent, so elegant, that every woman lost her heart to him; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them.  “As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen’s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place. There is no occasion to tell you, my lord, that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador, who was far away, beyond seas. This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects—fallen from her high estate.”  “Indeed!”  “Well, my lord, four men resolved to save her. These four men were not princes, neither were they dukes, neither were they men in power; they were not even rich. They were four honest soldiers, each with a good heart, a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it. They set out. The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination. Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants; one of them alone arrived at the port, having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him. He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen, who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day; and this very nearly ruined the minister. What do you think of that exploit, my lord?”  “It is magnificent!” said Mazarin, thoughtfully.  “Well, I know of ten such men.”  Mazarin made no reply; he reflected.  Five or six minutes elapsed.  “You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?” said Rochefort.  “Yes. And you say that Monsieur d’Artagnan was one of those four men?”  “He led the enterprise.”  “And who were the others?”  “I leave it to Monsieur d’Artagnan to name them, my lord. They were his friends and not mine. He alone would have any influence with them; I do not even know them under their true names.”  “You suspect me, Monsieur de Rochefort; I want him and you and all to aid me.”  “Begin with me, my lord; for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one’s destination.”  “You, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, shall have the post of confidence; you shall go to Vincennes, where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined; you will guard him well for me. Well, what is the matter?”  “The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible,” said Rochefort, shaking his head with an air of disappointment.  “What! impossible? And why is it impossible?”  “Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends, or rather, I am one of his. Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me to the queen?”  “Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State.”  “That may be, my lord; but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister, he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your offer.”  “This, then, is what you call devotion! I congratulate you. Your devotion does not commit you too far, Monsieur de Rochefort.”  “And then, my lord,” continued Rochefort, “you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change one’s prison.”  “Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort; that will be the most sincere line of conduct,” said Mazarin.  “My lord, I have been so long shut up, that I am only of one party—I am for fresh air. Employ me in any other way; employ me even actively, but let it be on the high roads.”  “My dear Monsieur de Rochefort,” Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery, “you think yourself still a young man; your spirit is that of the phoenix, but your strength fails you. Believe me, you ought now to take a rest. Here!”  “You decide, then, nothing about me, my lord?”  “On the contrary, I have come to a decision.”  Bernouin came into the room.  “Call an officer of justice,” he said; “and stay close to me,” he added, in a low tone.  The officer entered. Mazarin wrote a few words, which he gave to this man; then he bowed.  “Adieu, Monsieur de Rochefort,” he said.  Rochefort bent low.  “I see, my lord, I am to be taken back to the Bastile.”  “You are sagacious.”  “I shall return thither, my lord, but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me.”  “You? the friend of my greatest foes? Don’t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me, Monsieur de Rochefort. I shall find many men as able as you are.”  “I wish you may, my lord,” replied De Rochefort.  He was then reconducted by the little staircase, instead of passing through the ante-chamber where D’Artagnan was waiting. In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready, but he looked around in vain for his friend.  “Ah!” he muttered to himself, “this changes the situation, and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin that we are still, thank God, good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner;” and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five-and-twenty.     Chapter IV. Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty-six.   When left alone with Bernouin, Mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought. He had gained much information, but not enough. Mazarin was a cheat at the card-table. This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne. He called it using his advantages. He now determined not to begin the game with D’Artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary’s cards.  “My lord, have you any commands?” asked Bernouin.  “Yes, yes,” replied Mazarin. “Light me; I am going to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],["title","Twenty Years After (#7)"],["body","queen.”  Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way.  There was a secret communication between the cardinal’s apartments and those of the queen; and through this corridor* Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of Austria.  *This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal.   In the bedroom in which this passage ended, Bernouin encountered Madame de Beauvais, like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs; and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare Anne of Austria, who was in her oratory with the young king, Louis XIV., to receive the cardinal.  Anne, reclining in a large easy-chair, her head supported by her hand, her elbow resting on a table, was looking at her son, who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures. This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity. It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room, without either reading or praying.  When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal, the child, who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius, enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexander’s feats of arms, frowned and looked at his mother.  “Why,” he said, “does he enter without first asking for an audience?”  Anne colored slightly.  “The prime minister,” she said, “is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time, without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court.”  “But Richelieu never came in this manner,” said the pertinacious boy.  “How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did? You were too young to know about such things.”  “I do not remember what he did, but I have inquired and I have been told all about it.”  “And who told you about it?” asked Anne of Austria, with a movement of impatience.  “I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions,” answered the child, “for if I do I shall learn nothing further.”  At this very moment Mazarin entered. The king rose immediately, took his book, closed it and went to lay it down on the table, near which he continued standing, in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand also.  Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance. They explained what had occurred that evening.  He bowed respectfully to the king, who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception, but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which, from his infancy, Louis XIV. had entertained toward Mazarin, and he endeavored to receive the minister’s homage with civility.  Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarin’s face the occasion of this unexpected visit, since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired.  The minister made a slight sign with his head, whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais:  “It is time for the king to go to bed; call Laporte.”  The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed, and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was; but now he made no reply, but turned pale and bit his lips with anger.  In a few minutes Laporte came into the room. The child went directly to him without kissing his mother.  “Well, Louis,” said Anne, “why do you not kiss me?”  “I thought you were angry with me, madame; you sent me away.”  “I do not send you away, but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire you.”  “You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to-day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion.”  “Sire!” interposed Laporte, in order to turn the subject, “to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle?”  “To any one, Laporte,” the child said; and then added in a loud voice, “to any one except Mancini.”  Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarin’s and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself, although placed near his person by the minister.  And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal.  “Good,” said Mazarin, “I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation.”  “Why do you say that?” asked the queen, almost timidly.  “Why, it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation. Besides, his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me. That, however, does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service, as I am to that of your majesty.”  “I ask your pardon for him, cardinal,” said the queen; “he is a child, not yet able to understand his obligations to you.”  The cardinal smiled.  “But,” continued the queen, “you have doubtless come for some important purpose. What is it, then?”  Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance.  “It is likely,” he replied, “that we shall soon be obliged to separate, unless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy.”  “Why,” cried the queen; “how is that?”  “Because, as they say in the opera of ‘Thisbe,’ ‘The whole world conspires to break our bonds.’”  “You jest, sir!” answered the queen, endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity.  “Alas! I do not, madame,” rejoined Mazarin. “Mark well what I say. The whole world conspires to break our bonds. Now as you are one of the whole world, I mean to say that you also are deserting me.”  “Cardinal!”  “Heavens! did I not see you the other day smile on the Duke of Orleans? or rather at what he said?”  “And what was he saying?”  “He said this, madame: ‘Mazarin is a stumbling-block. Send him away and all will then be well.’”  “What do you wish me to do?”  “Oh, madame! you are the queen!”  “Queen, forsooth! when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense, or of every country squire in the kingdom.”  “Nevertheless, you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like!”  “That is to say, whom you do not like,” returned the queen.  “I! persons whom I do not like!”  “Yes, indeed. Who sent away Madame de Chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign?”  “A woman of intrigue, who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against M. de Richelieu.”  “Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort, that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine?”  “A prude, who told you every night, as she undressed you, that it was a sin to love a priest, just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal.”  “Who ordered Monsieur de Beaufort to be arrested?”  “An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me.”  “You see, cardinal,” replied the queen, “that your enemies are mine.”  “That is not enough madame, it is necessary that your friends should be also mine.”  “My friends, monsieur?” The queen shook her head. “Alas, I have them no longer!”  “How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?”  “It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends, monsieur; because I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis, who, returning from her first exile, treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and, being proscribed a second time, died at Cologne abandoned by every one, even by her own son.”  “Well, let us see,” said Mazarin; “isn’t there still time to repair the evil? Search among your friends, your oldest friends.”  “What do you mean, monsieur?”  “Nothing else than I say—search.”  “Alas, I look around me in vain! I have no influence with any one. Monsieur is, as usual, led by his favorite; yesterday it was Choisy, to-day it is La Riviere, to-morrow it will be some one else. Monsieur le Prince is led by the coadjutor, who is led by Madame de Guemenee.”  “Therefore, madame, I ask you to look, not among your friends of to-day, but among those of other times.”  “Among my friends of other times?” said the queen.  “Yes, among your friends of other times; among those who aided you to contend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him.”  “What is he aiming at?” murmured the queen, looking uneasily at the cardinal.  “Yes,” continued his eminence; “under certain circumstances, with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses, aided by your friends, you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary.”  “I!” said the queen. “I suffered, that is all.”  “Yes,” said Mazarin, “as women suffer in avenging themselves. Come, let us come to the point. Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort?”  “One of my bitterest enemies—the faithful friend of Cardinal Richelieu.”  “I know that, and we sent him to the Bastile,” said Mazarin.  “Is he at liberty?” asked the queen.  “No; still there, but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce the name of another man. Do you know Monsieur d’Artagnan?” he added, looking steadfastly at the queen.  Anne of Austria received the blow with a beating heart.  “Has the Gascon been indiscreet?” she murmured to herself, then said aloud:  “D’Artagnan! stop an instant, the name seems certainly familiar. D’Artagnan! there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women. Poor young creature! she was poisoned on my account.”  “That’s all you know of him?” asked Mazarin.  The queen looked at him, surprised.  “You seem, sir,” she remarked, “to be making me undergo a course of cross-examination.”  “Which you answer according to your fancy,” replied Mazarin.  “Tell me your wishes and I will comply with them.”  The queen spoke with some impatience.  “Well, madame,” said Mazarin, bowing, “I desire that you give me a share in your friends, as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given me. The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly.”  “Still!” said the queen. “I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beaufort.”  “Yes, you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and "]]]
