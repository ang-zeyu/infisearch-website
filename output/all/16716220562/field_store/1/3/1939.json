I shall hear the grasshoppers     From the parched grass rehearse,     And with drowsy note prolong     Evermore the same thin song.     I shall hear the crickets tell     Stories by the humming well,     And mark the locust, with quaint eyes,     Caper in his cloak of gray     Like a jester in disguise     Rattling by the dusty way.      I shall dream by upland fences,     Where the season's wealth condenses     Over many a weedy wreck,     Wild, uncared-for, desert places,     That sovereign Beauty loves to deck     With her softest, dearest graces.     There the long year dreams in quiet,     And the summer's strength runs riot.     Shall I not remember these,     Deep in winter reveries?     Berried brier and thistle-bloom,     And milkweed with its dense perfume;     Slender vervain towering up     In a many-branchèd cup,     Like a candlestick, each spire     Kindled with a violet fire;     Matted creepers and wild cherries,     Purple-bunchèd elderberries,     And on scanty plots of sod     Groves of branchy goldenrod.      What though autumn mornings now,     Winterward with glittering brow,     Stiffen in the silver grass;     And what though robins flock and pass,     With subdued and sober call,     To the old year's funeral;     Though October's crimson leaves     Rustle at the gusty door,     And the tempest round the eaves     Alternate with pipe and roar;     I sit, as erst, unharmed, secure,     Conscious that my store is sure,     Whatsoe'er the fencèd fields,     Or the untilled forest yields     Of unhurt remembrances,     Or thoughts, far-glimpsed, half-followed, these     I have reaped and laid away,     A treasure of unwinnowed grain,     To the garner packed and gray     Gathered without toil or strain.      And when the darker days shall come,     And the fields are white and dumb;     When our fires are half in vain,     And the crystal starlight weaves     Mockeries of summer leaves,     Pictured on the icy pane;     When the high aurora gleams     Far above the Arctic streams     Like a line of shifting spears,     And the broad pine-circled meres,     Glimmering in that spectral light,     Thunder through the northern night;     Then within the bolted door     I shall con my summer store;     Though the fences scarcely show     Black above the drifted snow,     Though the icy sweeping wind     Whistle in the empty tree,     Safe within the sheltered mind,     I shall feed on memory.      Yet across the windy night     Comes upon its wings a cry;     Fashioned forms and modes take flight,     And a vision sad and high     Of the laboring world down there,     Where the lights burn red and warm,     Pricks my soul with sudden stare,     Glowing through the veils of storm.     In the city yonder sleep     Those who smile and those who weep,     Those whose lips are set with care,     Those whose brows are smooth and fair;     Mourners whom the dawning light     Shall grapple with an old distress;     Lovers folded at midnight     In their bridal happiness;     Pale watchers by belovèd beds,     Fallen a-drowse with nodding heads,     Whom sleep captured by surprise,     With the circles round their eyes;     Maidens with quiet-taken breath,     Dreaming of enchanted bowers;     Old men with the mask of death;     Little children soft as flowers;     Those who wake wild-eyed and start     In some madness of the heart;     Those whose lips and brows of stone     Evil thoughts have graven upon,     Shade by shade and line by line,     Refashioning what was once divine.      All these sleep, and through the night,     Comes a passion and a cry,     With a blind sorrow and a might,     I know not whence, I know not why,     A something I cannot control,     A nameless hunger of the soul.     It holds me fast. In vain, in vain,     I remember how of old     I saw the ruddy race of men,     Through the glittering world outrolled,     A gay-smiling multitude,     All immortal, all divine,     Treading in a wreathèd line     By a pathway through a wood.     THE SUN CUP       The earth is the cup of the sun,     That he filleth at morning with wine,     With the warm, strong wine of his might     From the vintage of gold and of light,     Fills it, and makes it divine.      And at night when his journey is done,     At the gate of his radiant hall,     He setteth his lips to the brim,     With a long last look of his eye,     And lifts it and draineth it dry,     Drains till he leaveth it all     Empty and hollow and dim.      And then, as he passes to sleep,     Still full of the feats that he did,     Long ago in Olympian wars,     He closes it down with the sweep     Of its slow-turning luminous lid,     Its cover of darkness and stars,     Wrought once by Hephæstus of old     With violet and vastness and gold.

INTRODUCTION.  Many are the acquisitions which geography has made since the boundaries of commerce have been extended, and the spirit of enterprise has carried our adventurous countrymen into countries which had never yet been indented by a European foot; and which, in the great map of the world, appeared as barren and uninhabitable places, destitute of all resources from which the traveller could derive a subsistence. It must, however, on the other hand, be admitted, that design has frequently had little to do in the discovery of those countries, however well it may have been conceived, and however great the perseverance may have been, which was exhibited in the pursuit. The discovery of America was, indeed, a splendid example of an enlightened conception, and an undaunted heroism, crowned with the most complete success; and the laudable and unabated ardour which this country, in despite of the most appalling obstacles, has persisted in solving the great geographical problem of the Course and Termination of the Niger, may be placed second in rank to the discovery of America.  As long as any fact is shut out from the knowledge of man, he who is in search of it will supply the deficiency by his own conclusions, which will be more or less removed from the object of his pursuit, according to the previous opinions which he may have formed, or to the credit which he may have placed on the reports of others. These remarks cannot be better illustrated, than in the case furnished by the Joliba, the Quorra, or Niger, the termination of which river was utterly unknown until Richard and John Lander, braving difficulties which would have broken any other hearts than theirs, succeeded in navigating the river until its conflux with the ocean. Since Park's first discovery of the Joliba, every point of the compass has been assumed for the ulterior course and termination of that river, and however wrong subsequent discovery has proved this speculative geography to have been, it is not to be regarded as useless. Theories may be far short of the truth, but while they display the ingenuity and reasoning powers of their authors, they tend to keep alive that spirit of inquiry and thirst for knowledge which terminates in discovery.  Various accounts of this river had been gradually collected from different sources, which afforded grounds for fresh theories respecting its termination. That of Reichard was the favourite, he supposing that it assumed a southwest course, and terminated in the gulph of Guinea. It was observed at the time, that there was neither evidence on which such an opinion could be supported, nor any by which it could be refuted. Discovery has proved him to be right in respect to its ultimate disposal; but at the same time, he participated in the general error regarding its course to Wangara. These different opinions appeared in several publications, in which, as might be expected, much error was mixed up with the general correctness. That the river flowed into the sea at Funda, was the principal and chief point that was gained; but the most extraordinary circumstance attending this discovery, was, that no one knew where Funda was. The only exception to these was the theory of Major Denham, supported by Sultan Bello's information, who continued its easterly course below Boossa, and ended it in Lake Tchad.  Such was the uncertain condition in which the course of the Niger remained, when the happy idea occurred of sending the Messrs. Landers to follow its course below Boossa. By this step the British government completed what it had begun, and accomplished in a few months the work of ages.    CONTENTS  CHAP. I. Herodutus. Early History of Africa. Interior of Africa.
