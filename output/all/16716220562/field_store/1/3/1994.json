No Anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his. Ravachol, Vaillant, all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied dwindled into insignificance beside him. He had only to make sure of the water supply, and break the little tube into a reservoir. How brilliantly he had planned it, forged the letter of introduction and got into the laboratory, and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity! The world should hear of him at last. All those people who had sneered at him, neglected him, preferred other people to him, found his company undesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death, death! They had always treated him as a man of no importance. All the world had been in a conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it is to isolate a man. What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew's Street, of course! How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The Bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind. That was bad. He would be caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for money, and found half-a-sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into the man's face. \"More,\" he shouted, \"if only we get away.\"  The money was snatched out of his hand. \"Right you are,\" said the cabman, and the trap slammed, and the lash lay along the glistening side of the horse. The cab swayed, and the Anarchist, half-standing under the trap, put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve his balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken half of it rang upon the floor of the cab. He fell back into the seat with a curse, and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron.  He shuddered.  \"Well! I suppose I shall be the first. _Phew_! Anyhow, I shall be a Martyr. That's something. But it is a filthy death, nevertheless. I wonder if it hurts as much as they say.\"  Presently a thought occurred to him--he groped between his feet. A little drop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to make sure. It was better to make sure. At any rate, he would not fail.  Then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the Bacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got out. He slipped on the step, and his head felt queer. It was rapid stuff this cholera poison. He waved his cabman out of existence, so to speak, and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting the arrival of the Bacteriologist. There was something tragic in his pose. The sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He greeted his pursuer with a defiant laugh.  \"Vive l'Anarchie! You are too late, my friend. I have drunk it. The cholera is abroad!\"  The Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his spectacles. \"You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now.\" He was about to say something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the corner of his mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at which the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards Waterloo Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many people as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the appearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and overcoat. \"Very good of you to bring my things,\" he said, and remained lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the Anarchist.  \"You had better get in,\" he said, still staring. Minnie felt absolutely convinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own responsibility. \"Put on my shoes? Certainly dear,\" said he, as the cab began to turn, and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the distance, from his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him, and he laughed. Then he remarked, \"It is really very serious, though.\"  \"You see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist. No--don't faint, or I cannot possibly tell you the rest. And I wanted to astonish him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation of that new species of Bacterium I was telling you of, that infest, and I think cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and like a fool, I said it was Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the water of London, and he certainly might have made things look blue for this civilised city. And now he has swallowed it. Of course, I cannot say what will happen, but you know it turned that kitten blue, and the three puppies--in patches, and the sparrow--bright blue. But the bother is, I shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some more.  \"Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs Jabber. My dear, Mrs Jabber is not a draught. But why should I wear a coat on a hot day because of Mrs--. Oh! _very_ well.\"     THE FLOWERING OF THE STRANGE ORCHID   The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour. You have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the rest you must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good-luck, as your taste may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps--for the thing has happened again and again--there slowly unfolds before the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety, some novel richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or some subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom together on one delicate green spike, and, it may be, even immortality. For the new miracle of Nature may stand in need of a new specific name, and what so convenient as that of its discoverer? \"Johnsmithia\"! There have been worse names.  It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made Winter-Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales--that hope, and also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest to do in the world. He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual man, provided with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity, and not enough nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments. He might have collected stamps or coins, or translated Horace, or bound books, or invented new species of diatoms. But, as it happened, he grew orchids, and had one ambitious little hothouse.  \"I have a fancy,\" he said over his coffee, \"that something is going to happen to me to-day.\" He spoke--as he moved and thought--slowly.  \"Oh, don't say _that_!\" said his housekeeper--who was also his remote cousin. For \"something happening\" was a euphemism that meant only one thing to her.  \"You misunderstand me. I mean nothing unpleasant ... though what I do mean I scarcely know.  \"To-day,\" he continued, after a pause, \"Peters' are going to sell a batch of plants from the Andamans and the Indies. I shall go up and see what they have. It may be I shall buy something good, unawares. That may be it.\"  He passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee.  \"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of the other day?\" asked his cousin as she filled his cup.  \"Yes,\" he said, and became meditative over a piece of toast.  \"Nothing ever does happen to me,\" he remarked presently, beginning to think aloud. \"I wonder why? Things enough happen to other people. There is Harvey. Only the other week; on Monday he picked up sixpence, on Wednesday his chicks all had the staggers, on Friday his cousin came home from Australia, and on Saturday he broke his ankle. What a whirl of excitement!--compared to me.\"  \"I think I would rather be without so much excitement,\" said his housekeeper. \"It can't be good for you.\"  \"I suppose it's troublesome. Still ... you see, nothing ever happens to me. When I was a little boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as I grew up. Never married.... I wonder how it feels to have something happen to you, something really remarkable.  \"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six--twenty years younger than myself--when he died. And he had been married twice and divorced once; he had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke his thigh. He killed a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart. And in the end he was killed by jungle-leeches. It must have all been very troublesome, but then it must have been very interesting, you know--except, perhaps, the leeches.\"  \"I am sure it was not good for him,\" said the lady, with conviction.  \"Perhaps not.\" And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. \"Twenty-three minutes past eight. I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so that there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket--it is quite warm enough--and my grey felt hat and brown shoes. I suppose--\"  He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and then nervously at his cousin's face.  \"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to London,\" she said in a voice that admitted of no denial. \"There's all between here and the station coming back.\"  When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement. He had made a purchase. It was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to buy, but this time he had done so.  \"There are Vandas,\" he said, \"and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis.\" He surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup. They were laid out on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was telling his cousin all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner. It was his custom to live all his visits to London over again in the evening for her and his own entertainment.  \"I knew something would happen to-day. And I have bought all these. Some of them--some of them--I feel sure, do you know, that some of them will be remarkable. I don't know how it is, but I feel just as sure as if someone had told me that some of these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12750"],["title","The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents (#2)"],["body"," turn out remarkable.  \"That one\"--he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome--\"was not identified. It may be a Palaeonophis--or it may not. It may be a new species, or even a new genus. And it was the last that poor Batten ever collected.\"  \"I don't like the look of it,\" said his housekeeper. \"It's such an ugly shape.\"  \"To me it scarcely seems to have a shape.\"  \"I don't like those things that stick out,\" said his housekeeper.  \"It shall be put away in a pot to-morrow.\"  \"It looks,\" said the housekeeper, \"like a spider shamming dead.\"  Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side. \"It is certainly not a pretty lump of stuff. But you can never judge of these things from their dry appearance. It may turn out to be a very beautiful orchid indeed. How busy I shall be to-morrow! I must see to-night just exactly what to do with these things, and to-morrow I shall set to work.\"  \"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove swamp--I forget which,\" he began again presently, \"with one of these very orchids crushed up under his body. He had been unwell for some days with some kind of native fever, and I suppose he fainted. These mangrove swamps are very unwholesome. Every drop of blood, they say, was taken out of him by the jungle-leeches. It may be that very plant that cost him his life to obtain.\"  \"I think none the better of it for that.\"  \"Men must work though women may weep,\" said Wedderburn with profound gravity.  \"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy being ill of fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine--if men were left to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine--and no one round you but horrible natives! They say the Andaman islanders are most disgusting wretches--and, anyhow, they can scarcely make good nurses, not having the necessary training. And just for people in England to have orchids!\"  \"I don't suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy that kind of thing,\" said Wedderburn. \"Anyhow, the natives of his party were sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the interior; though they could not tell the species of the orchid and had let it wither. And it makes these things more interesting.\"  \"It makes them disgusting. I should be afraid of some of the malaria clinging to them. And just think, there has been a dead body lying across that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare I cannot eat another mouthful of dinner.\"  \"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the window-seat. I can see them just as well there.\"  The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and all the other mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a wonderfully eventful time. In the evening he would talk about these new orchids to his friends, and over and over again he reverted to his expectation of something strange.  Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, but presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life. He was delighted and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to see it at once, directly he made the discovery.  \"That is a bud,\" he said, \"and presently there will be a lot of leaves there, and those little things coming out here are aërial rootlets.\"  \"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown,\" said his housekeeper. \"I don't like them.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"I don't know. They look like fingers trying to get at you. I can't help my likes and dislikes.\"  \"I don't know for certain, but I don't _think_ there are any orchids I know that have aërial rootlets quite like that. It may be my fancy, of course. You see they are a little flattened at the ends.\"  \"I don't like 'em,\" said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and turning away. \"I know it's very silly of me--and I'm very sorry, particularly as you like the thing so much. But I can't help thinking of that corpse.\"  \"But it may not be that particular plant. That was merely a guess of mine.\"  His housekeeper shrugged her shoulders. \"Anyhow I don't like it,\" she said.  Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant. But that did not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this orchid in particular, whenever he felt inclined.  \"There are such queer things about orchids,\" he said one day; \"such possibilities of surprises. You know, Darwin studied their fertilisation, and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid-flower was contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant. Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way. Some of the Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects known that can possibly fertilise them, and some of them have never be found with seed.\"  \"But how do they form new plants?\"  \"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily explained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?  \"Very likely,\" he added, \"_my_ orchid may be something extraordinary in that way. If so I shall study it. I have often thought of making researches as Darwin did. But hitherto I have not found the time, or something else has happened to prevent it. The leaves are beginning to unfold now. I do wish you would come and see them!\"  But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the headache. She had seen the plant once again, and the aërial rootlets, which were now some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately reminded her of tentacles reaching out after something; and they got into her dreams, growing after her with incredible rapidity. So that she had settled to her entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again, and Wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone. They were of the ordinary broad form, and a deep glossy green, with splashes and dots of deep red towards the base. He knew of no other leaves quite like them. The plant was placed on a low bench near the thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement by which a tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy. And he spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the approaching flowering of this strange plant.  And at last the great thing happened. Directly he entered the little glass house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great _Palaeonophis Lowii_ hid the corner where his new darling stood. There was a new odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that overpowered every other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.  Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid. And, behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of blossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded. He stopped before them in an ecstasy of admiration.  The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals; the heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, and a wonderful bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at once that the genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable scent! How hot the place was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.  He would see if the temperature was right. He made a step towards the thermometer. Suddenly everything appeared unsteady. The bricks on the floor were dancing up and down. Then the white blossoms, the green leaves behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to sweep sideways, and then in a curve upward.         *       *       *       *       *  At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their invariable custom. But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.  \"He is worshipping that horrid orchid,\" she told herself, and waited ten minutes. \"His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him.\"  She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called his name. There was no reply. She noticed that the air was very close, and loaded with an intense perfume. Then she saw something lying on the bricks between the hot-water pipes.  For a minute, perhaps, she stood motionless.  He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid. The tentacle-like aërial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight with their ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.  She did not understand. Then she saw from under one of the exultant tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.  With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull him away from the leech-like suckers. She snapped two of these tentacles, and their sap dripped red.  Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel. How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white inflorescence swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must not. She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she had panted for a moment in the fresh air, she had a brilliant inspiration. She caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the windows at the end of the green-house. Then she re-entered. She tugged now with renewed strength at Wedderburn's motionless body, and brought the strange orchid crashing to the floor. It still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim. In a frenzy, she lugged it and him into the open air.  Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one, and in another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the horror.  He was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches.  The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the smashing of glass, and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands. For a moment he thought impossible things.  \"Bring some water!\" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies. When, with unnatural alacrity,"]]]
