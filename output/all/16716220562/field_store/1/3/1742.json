I must go,\" Sir Francis said, endeavouring to push by them.  \"Let the door be closed,\" an authoritative voice cried from the head of the table.  The order was instantly obeyed. Two serving-men stationed themselves before the place of exit, and Sir Francis found himself a prisoner.  The roof rang with the laughter and gibes of the guests.  \"This is a frolic, gentleman, I perceive. You are resolved to make me your sport--ha! ha!\" Sir Francis said, trying to disguise his uneasiness under an appearance of levity--\"But you will not carry the jest too far. You will not maltreat me. My partner, Sir Giles Mompesson, will be here anon, and will requite any outrage committed upon me.\"  \"Sir Giles is impatiently expected by us,\" a spruce coxcomb near him replied. \"Madame Bonaventure had prepared us for his coming. We will give him the welcome he deserves.\"  \"Ah! traitress! then it was all planned,\" Sir Francis thought;--\"and, blind owl that I am, I have fallen into the snare.\"  But the poor knight was nearly at his wit's end with fright, when he saw Lord Roos quit his place at the upper table and approach him.     CHAPTER VII. How Lord Roos obtained Sir Francis Mitchell's signature.   \"What, my prince of usurers!\" exclaimed Lord Roos, in a mocking tone; \"my worthy money-lender, who never takes more than cent. per cent., and art ill content with less; who never exacts more than the penalty of thy bond,--unless more may be got; who never drives a hard bargain with a needy man--by thine own account; who never persecutes a debtor--as the prisons shall vouch for thee; who art just in all thy transactions--as every man who hath had dealings with thee will affirm; and who knows not how to lie, to cheat, to cozen--as some usurers do.\"  \"You are pleasant, my lord,\" Sir Francis replied.  \"I mean to be so,\" Lord Roos said; \"for I esteem thee for thy rare qualities. I know not thy peer for cunning and knavery. Thy mischievous schemes are so well-conceived that they prove thee to have an absolute genius for villany. Scruples thou hast none; and considerations and feelings which might move men less obdurate than thyself, have no influence over thee. To ruin a man is with thee mere pastime; and groans of the oppressed are music in thine ears.\"  \"Aha! a good jest. You were always merry with me, my lord.\"  \"Yes, when I borrowed money from thee--but not when I had to repay it twice over. I laughed not then; but was foolish enough to threaten to take thy life. My anger is past now. But we must drink together--a rousing toast.\"  \"At your lordship's pleasure,\" Sir Francis replied.  \"Cyprien! a flask of wine, and thy largest goblet,\" Lord Roos cried. \"'Tis well! Now pour the whole into the flagon. Do me reason in this cup, Sir Francis?\"  \"What! in this mighty cup, my lord?\" the knight replied. \"Nay, 'tis too much, I swear. If I become drunken, the sin will lie at your door.\"  \"Off with it! without more ado. And let the toast be what thou practisest--'Pillage and Extortion!'\"  \"I cannot drink that toast, my lord. 'Twill choke me.\"  \"'Sdeath! villain, but thou _shalt_, or thou shalt never taste wine more. Down with it, man! And now your signature to this paper?\"  \"My signature!\" Sir Francis cried, reeling from the effect of the wine he had swallowed. \"Nay, my good lord; I can sign nothing that I have not read. What is it?\"  \"A blank sheet,\" Lord Roos rejoined. \"I will fill it up afterwards.\"  \"Then, my lord, I refuse--that is, I decline--that is, I had rather not, if your lordship pleases.\"  \"But my lordship pleases otherwise. Give him pen and ink, and set him near the table.\"  This was done; and Sir Francis regarded the paper with swimming eyes.  \"Now, your name,--written near the bottom of the sheet,\" Lord Roos cried.  \"'Tis done under com--compulsion; and I pro--protest against it.\"  \"Sign, I say,\" the young nobleman exclaimed, rapping the table peremptorily.  On this, Sir Francis wrote his name in the place indicated.  \"Enough!\" Lord Roos cried, snatching up the paper. \"This is all I want. Now set him on the table, that his partner may have him in full view when he arrives. 'Twill give him a foretaste of what he may himself expect.\"  \"What mean you, ruff--ruffians? 'Tis an indignity to which I shall not submit,\" cried Sir Francis, who was now, however, too far gone to offer any resistance.  A leathern girdle was found, with which he was fastened to the chair, so as to prevent him slipping from it; and in this state he was hoisted upon the table, and set with his face to the door; looking the very picture of inebriety, with his head drooping on one side, his arms dangling uselessly down, and his thin legs stretched idly out. After making some incoherent objections to this treatment, he became altogether silent, and seemed to fall asleep. His elevation was received with shouts of laughter from the whole company.  The incident had not taken place many minutes, and a round had scarcely been drunk by the guests, when a loud and peremptory summons was heard at the door. The noise roused even the poor drunkard in the chair, who, lifting up his head, stared about him with vacant eyes.  \"Let the door be opened,\" the same authoritative voice exclaimed, which had before ordered its closure.  The mandate was obeyed; and, amidst profound silence, which suddenly succeeded the clashing of glasses, and expressions of hilarity, Sir Giles Mompesson entered, with his body-guard of myrmidons behind him.  Habited in black, as was his custom, with a velvet mantle on his shoulder, and a long rapier by his side, he came forward with a measured step and assured demeanour. Though he must necessarily have been surprised by the assemblage he found--so much more numerous and splendid than he could have anticipated--he betrayed no signs whatever of embarrassment. Nor, though his quick eye instantly detected Sir Francis, and he guessed at once why the poor knight had been so scandalously treated, did he exhibit any signs of displeasure, or take the slightest notice of the circumstance; reserving this point for consideration, when his first business should be settled. An additional frown might have darkened his countenance; but it was so stern and sombre, without it, that no perceptible change could be discerned; unless it might be in the lightning glances he cast around, as if seeking some one he might call to account presently for the insult. But no one seemed willing to reply to the challenge. Though bold enough before he came, and boastful of what they would do, they all looked awed by his presence, and averted their gaze from him. There was, indeed, something so formidable in the man, that to shun a quarrel with him was more a matter of prudence than an act of cowardice; and on the present occasion, no one liked to be first to provoke him; trusting to his neighbour to commence the attack, or awaiting the general outbreak.  There was one exception, however, and that was Jocelyn Mounchensey, who, so far from desiring to shun Sir Giles's searching regards, courted them; and as the knight's eagle eye ranged round the table and fell upon him, the young man (notwithstanding the efforts of his pacific neighbour in the furred cloak to restrain him) suddenly rose up, and throwing all the scorn and defiance he could muster into his countenance, returned Mompesson's glance with one equally fierce and menacing.  A bitter smile curled Sir Giles's lip at this reply to his challenge, and he regarded the young man fixedly, as if to grave his features upon his memory. Perhaps they brought Mounchensey's father to mind, for Sir Giles withdrew his gaze for a moment to reflect, and then looked again at Jocelyn with fresh curiosity. If he had any doubts as to whom he beheld, they were removed by Sir Francis, who managed to hiccup forth--  \"'Tis he, Sir Giles--'tis Jocelyn Mounchensey.\"  \"I thought as much,\" Sir Giles muttered. \"A moment, young man,\" he cried, waving his hand imperiously to his antagonist. \"Your turn will come presently.\"  And without bestowing further notice on Jocelyn, who resisted all his neighbour's entreaties to him to sit down, Sir Giles advanced towards the middle chamber, where he paused, and took off his cap, having hitherto remained covered.  In this position, he looked like a grand inquisitor attended by his familiars.     CHAPTER VIII. Of Lupo Vulp, Captain Bludder, Clement Lanyere, and Sir Giles's other Myrmidons.   Close behind Sir Giles, and a little in advance of the rest of the myrmidons, stood Lupo Vulp, the scrivener.  Lupo Vulp was the confidential adviser of our two extortioners, to whom they referred all their nefarious projects. He it was who prepared their bonds and contracts, and placed out their ill-gotten gains at exorbitant usance. Lupo Vulp was in all respects worthy of his employers, being just as wily and unscrupulous as they were, while, at the same time, he was rather better versed in legal tricks and stratagems, so that he could give them apt counsel in any emergency. A countenance more replete with cunning and knavery than that of Lupo Vulp, it would be difficult to discover. A sardonic smile hovered perpetually about his mouth, which was garnished with ranges of the keenest and whitest teeth. His features were sharp; his eyes small, set wide apart, of a light gray colour, and with all the slyness of a fox lurking within their furtive glances. Indeed, his general resemblance to that astute animal must have struck a physiognomist. His head was shaped like that of a fox, and his hair and beard were of a reddish-tawny hue. His manner was stealthy, cowering, suspicious, as if he feared a blow from every hand. Yet Lupo Vulp could show his teeth and snap on occasions. He was attired in a close-fitting doublet of russety-brown, round yellow hose, and long stockings of the same hue. A short brown mantle and a fox-skin cap completed his costume.  The leader of the troop was Captain Bludder, a huge Alsatian bully, with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12396"],["title","The Star-Chamber: An Historical Romance, Volume 1 (#8)"],["body","y-twisted moustachios, and fiery-red beard cut like a spade. He wore a steeple-crowned hat with a brooch in it, a buff jerkin and boots, and a sword and buckler dangled from his waist. Besides these, he had a couple of petronels stuck in his girdle. The captain drank like a fish, and swaggered and swore like twenty troopers.  The rear of the band was formed by the tipstaves--stout fellows with hooks at the end of their poles, intended to capture a fugitive, or hale him along when caught. With these were some others armed with brown-bills. No uniformity prevailed in the accoutrements of the party, each man arraying himself as he listed. Some wore old leather jerkins and steel skirts; some, peascod doublets of Elizabeth's time, and trunk-hose that had covered many a limb besides their own; others, slops and galligaskins; while the poorer sort were robed in rusty gowns of tuft-mockado or taffeta, once guarded with velvet or lined with skins, but now tattered and threadbare. Their caps and bonnets were as varied as their apparel,--some being high-crowned, some trencher-shaped, and some few wide in the leaf and looped at the side. Moreover, there was every variety of villainous aspect; the savage scowl of the desperado, the cunning leer of the trickster, and the sordid look of the mean knave. Several of them betrayed, by the marks of infamy branded on their faces, or by the loss of ears, that they had passed through the hands of the public executioner.  Amongst these there was one with a visage more frightfully mutilated than those of his comrades; the nose having been slit, and subsequently sewed together again, but so clumsily that the severed parts had only imperfectly united, communicating a strange, distorted, and forbidding look to the physiognomy. Clement Lanyere, the owner of this gashed and ghastly face, who was also reft of his ears, and branded on the cheek, had suffered infamy and degradation, owing to the licence he had given his tongue in respect to the Star-Chamber. Prosecuted in that court by Sir Giles Mompesson, as a notorious libeller and scandaller of the judges and first personages of the realm, he was found guilty, and sentenced accordingly. The court showed little leniency to such offenders; but it was a matter of grace that his clamorous tongue was not torn out likewise, in addition to the punishment actually inflicted. A heavy fine and imprisonment accompanied the corporal penalties. Thus utterly ruined and degraded, and a mark for the finger of scorn to point at, Clement Lanyere, whose prospects had once been fair enough, as his features had been prepossessing, became soured and malevolent, embittered against the world, and at war with society. He turned promoter, or, in modern parlance, informer; lodging complaints, seeking out causes for prosecutions, and bringing people into trouble in order to obtain part of the forfeits they incurred for his pains. Strange to say, he attached himself to Sir Giles Mompesson,--the cause of all his misfortunes,--and became one of the most active and useful of his followers. It was thought no good could come of this alliance, and that the promoter only bided his time to turn upon his master, against whom it was only natural he should nourish secret vengeance. But, if it were so, Sir Giles seemed to entertain no apprehensions of him, probably thinking he could crush him whenever he pleased. Either way the event was long deferred. Clement Lanyere, to all appearance, continued to serve his master zealously and well; and Sir Giles gave no sign whatever of distrust, but, on the contrary, treated him with increased confidence. The promoter was attired wholly in black--cloak, cap, doublet, and hose were of sable. And as, owing to the emoluments springing from his vile calling, his means were far greater than those of his comrades; so his habiliments were better. When wrapped in his mantle, with his mutilated countenance covered with a mask which he generally wore, the informer might have passed for a cavalier; so tall and well formed was his figure, and so bold his deportment. The dangerous service he was employed upon, which exposed him to insult and injury, required him to be well armed; and he took care to be so.  Two or three of Sir Giles's myrmidons, having been selected for particular description, the designations of some others must suffice--such as Staring Hugh, a rascal of unmatched effrontery; the Gib Cat and Cutting Dick, dissolute rogues from the Pickt-hatch in Turnbull Street, near Clerkenwell; old Tom Wootton, once a notorious harbourer of \"masterless men,\" at his house at Smart's Quay, but now a sheriffs officer; and, perhaps, it ought to be mentioned, that there were some half-dozen swash-bucklers and sharpers from Alsatia, under the command of Captain Bludder, who was held responsible for their good conduct.  Such was Sir Giles's body-guard.  On his entrance, it may be remarked, the curtain in front of the raised table was more closely drawn, so as completely to conceal the guests. But their importance might be inferred from the serving-men, in rich liveries, standing before the traverse.  Profound silence reigned throughout the assemblage.  Having uncovered, as before mentioned, and made a formal reverence to the company, Sir Giles spoke as follows:--  \"I crave your pardon, worthy Sirs,\" he said, in a distinct and resolute voice, \"for this intrusion, and regret to be the means of marring your festivity. I came hither wholly unprepared to find such an assemblage. Yet, though I would willingly have chosen a more fitting opportunity for my visit, and would postpone, if I could, to another occasion, the unpleasant duty I have to fulfil; the matter is urgent, and will not admit of delay. You will hold me excused, therefore, if I proceed with it, regardless of your presence; and I am well assured no let or interruption will be offered me, seeing I act with the royal licence and authority, of which I am the unworthy representative.\"  \"Truly, your conduct requires explanation,\" Jocelyn Mounchensey cried, in a mocking tone. \"If I had not been here in London, I should have judged, from your appearance, and that of your attendants, that a band of desperate marauders had broken in upon us, and that we must draw our swords to defend our lives, and save the house from pillage. But after what you have said, I conclude you to be the sheriff, come with your followers to execute some writ of attachment; and therefore, however annoying the presence of such a functionary may be,--however ill-timed may be your visit, and unmannerly your deportment,--we are bound not to molest you.\"  Provocation like this was rarely addressed to Sir Giles; and the choler occasioned by it was increased by the laughter and cheers of the company. Nevertheless he constrained his anger, replying in a stern, scornful tone--  \"I would not counsel you to molest me, young man. The mistake you have committed in regard to myself may be pardoned in one of your evident inexperience; who, fresh from the boorish society of the country, finds himself, for the first time, amongst well-bred gentlemen. Of all here present you are probably the sole person ignorant that I am Sir Giles Mompesson. But it is scarcely likely that they should be aware, as I chance to be, that the clownish insolent who has dared to wag his tongue against me, is the son of a Star-Chamber delinquent.\"     CHAPTER IX. The Letters-Patent.   A slight reaction in Sir Giles's favour was produced by his speech, but Jocelyn quite regained his position with the company when he exclaimed--  \"My father was misjudged. His prosecutor was a villain, and his sentence iniquitous.\"  \"You have uttered your own condemnation, Jocelyn Mounchensey,\" Sir Giles cried, with a savage laugh. \"Know, to your confusion, that the High Court of Star-Chamber is so tender of upholding the honour of its sentences, that it ever punishes such as speak against them with the greatest severity. You have uttered your scandals openly.\"  \"Imprudent young man, you have, indeed, placed yourself in fearful jeopardy,\" a gentleman near him observed to Jocelyn. \"Escape, if you can. You are lost, if you remain here.\"  But instead of following the friendly advice, Jocelyn would have assaulted Sir Giles, if he had not been forcibly withheld by the gentleman.  The knight was not slow to follow up the advantage he had gained.  \"Stand forward, Clement Lanyere,\" he exclaimed, authoritatively.  The promoter instantly advanced.  \"Look at this man,\" Sir Giles continued, addressing Jocelyn; \"and you will perceive how those who malign the Star-Chamber are treated. This disfigured countenance was once as free from seam or scar as your own; and yet, for an offence lighter than yours, it hath been stamped, as you see, with indelible infamy. Answer, Clement Lanyere,--and answer according to your conscience,--Was the sentence just of the high and honourable court by which you were tried?\"  \"It was just,\" the promoter replied, a deep flush dyeing his ghastly visage.  \"And lenient?\"  \"Most lenient. For it left my foul tongue the power of speech it now enjoys.\"  \"By whom were you prosecuted in the Star-Chamber?\"  \"By him I now serve.\"  \"That is, by myself. Do you bear me malice for what I did?\"  \"I have never said so. On the contrary, Sir Giles, I have always declared I owe you a deep debt.\"  \"Which you strive to pay?\"  \"Which I _will_ pay.\"  \"You hear what this man says, Mounchensey?\" Sir Giles cried. \"You have been guilty of the same offence as he. Why should you not be similarly punished?\"  \"If I were so punished, I would stab my prosecutor to the heart,\" Jocelyn replied.  At this rejoinder, Lanyere, who had hitherto kept his eyes on the ground, suddenly raised them, with a look of singular expression at the speaker.  \"Humph!\" Sir Giles ejaculated. \"I must proceed to extremities with him, I find. Keep strict watch upon him, Lanyere; and follow him if he goes forth. Trace him to his lair."]]]
