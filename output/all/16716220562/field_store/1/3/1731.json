Not in the lyre of Orpheus, Not in the songs of Musæus, Lurked the unfathomed bewitchment Wrought by the wind in the grasses,                                      10 Held by the rote of the sea-surf,   In early summer.  Only to exquisite lovers, Fashioned for beauty’s fulfilment, Mated as rhythm to reed-stop                                             15 Whence the wild music is moulded, Ever appears the full measure   Of the world’s wonder.     XXXIV   “Who was Atthis?” men shall ask, When the world is old, and time Has accomplished without haste The strange destiny of men.  Haply in that far-off age                                                 5 One shall find these silver songs, With their human freight, and guess What a lover Sappho was.     XXXV   When the great pink mallow Blossoms in the marshland, Full of lazy summer And soft hours,  Then I hear the summons                                                   5 Not a mortal lover Ever yet resisted, Strange and far.  In the faint blue foothills, Making magic music,                                                      10 Pan is at his love-work On the reeds.  I can guess the heart-stop, Fall and lull and sequence, Full of grief for Syrinx                                                 15 Long ago.  Then the crowding madness, Wild and keen and tender, Trembles with the burden Of great joy.                                                            20  Nay, but well I follow, All unskilled, that fluting. Never yet was reed-nymph Like to thee.     XXXVI   When I pass thy door at night I a benediction breathe: “Ye who have the sleeping world   In your care,  “Guard the linen sweet and cool,                                          5 Where a lovely golden head With its dreams of mortal bliss   Slumbers now!”     XXXVII   Well I found you in the twilit garden, Laid a lover’s hand upon your shoulder, And we both were made aware of loving Past the reach of reason to unravel, Or the much desiring heart to follow.                                     5  There we heard the breath among the grasses And the gurgle of soft-running water, Well contented with the spacious starlight, The cool wind’s touch and the deep blue distance, Till the dawn came in with golden sandals.                               10     XXXVIII   Will not men remember us In the days to come hereafter,— Thy warm-coloured loving beauty   And my love for thee?  Thou, the hyacinth that grows                                             5 By a quiet-running river; I, the watery reflection   And the broken gleam.     XXXIX   I grow weary of the foreign cities, The sea travel and the stranger peoples. Even the clear voice of hardy fortune Dares me not as once on brave adventure.  For the heart of man must seek and wander,                                5 Ask and question and discover knowledge; Yet above all goodly things is wisdom, And love greater than all understanding.  So, a mariner, I long for land-fall,— When a darker purple on the sea-rim,                                     10 O’er the prow uplifted, shall be Lesbos And the gleaming towers of Mitylene.     XL   Ah, what detains thee, Phaon, So long from Mitylene, Where now thy restless lover Wearies for thy coming?  A fever burns me, Phaon;                                                  5 My knees quake on the threshold, And all my strength is loosened, Slack with disappointment.  But thou wilt come, my Phaon, Back from the sea like morning,                                          10 To quench in golden gladness The ache of parted lovers.     XLI   Phaon, O my lover, What should so detain thee,  Now the wind comes walking Through the leafy twilight?  All the plum-leaves quiver                                                5 With the coolth and darkness,  After their long patience In consuming ardour.  And the moving grasses Have relief; the dew-drench                                              10  Comes to quell the parching Ache of noon they suffered.  I alone of all things Fret with unsluiced fire.  And there is no quenching                                                15 In the night for Sappho,  Since her lover Phaon Leaves her unrequited.     XLII   O heart of insatiable longing, What spell, what enchantment allures thee Over the rim of the world With the sails of the sea-going ships?  And when the rose-petals are scattered                                    5 At dead of still noon on the grass-plot, What means this passionate grief,— This infinite ache of regret?     XLIII   Surely somehow, in some measure, There will be joy and fulfilment,— Cease from this throb of desire,—   Even for Sappho!  Surely some fortunate hour                                                5 Phaon will come, and his beauty Be spent like water to plenish   Need of that beauty!  Where is the breath of Poseidon, Cool from the sea-floor with evening?                                    10 Why are Selene’s white horses   So long arriving?     XLIV   O but my delicate lover, Is she not fair as the moonlight? Is she not supple and strong   For hurried passion?  Has not the god of the green world,                                       5 In his large tolerant wisdom, Filled with the ardours of earth   Her twenty summers?  Well did he make her for loving; Well did he mould her for beauty;                                        10 Gave her the wish that is brave   With understanding.  “O Pan, avert from this maiden Sorrow, misfortune, bereavement, Harm, and unhappy regret,”                                               15   Prays one fond mortal.     XLV   Softer than the hill-fog to the forest Are the loving hands of my dear lover, When she sleeps beside me in the starlight And her beauty drenches me with rest.  As the quiet mist enfolds the beech-trees,                                5 Even as she dreams her arms enfold me, Half awaking with a hundred kisses On the scarlet lily of her mouth.     XLVI   I seek and desire, Even as the wind That travels the plain And stirs in the bloom Of the apple-tree.                                                        5  I wander through life, With the searching mind That is never at rest, Till I reach the shade Of my lover’s door.                                                      10     XLVII   Like torn sea-kelp in the drift Of the great tides of the sea, Carried past the harbour-mouth To the deep beyond return,  I am buoyed and borne away                                                5 On the loveliness of earth, Little caring, save for thee, Past the portals of the night.     XLVIII   Fine woven purple linen I bring thee from Phocæa, That, beauty upon beauty, A precious gift may cover The lap where I have lain.                                                5  And a gold comb, and girdle, And trinkets of white silver, And gems are in my sea-chest, Lest poor and empty-handed Thy lover should return.                                                 10  And I have brought from Tyre A Pan-flute stained vermilion, Wherein the gods have hidden Love and desire and longing, Which I shall loose for thee.                                            15     XLIX   When I am home from travel, My eager foot will stay not Until I reach the threshold Where I went forth from thee.  And there, as darkness gathers                                            5 In the rose-scented garden, The god who prospers music Shall give me skill to play.  And thou shalt hear, all startled, A flute blown in the twilight,                                           10 With the soft pleading magic The green wood heard of old.  Then, lamp in hand, thy beauty In the rose-marble entry! And unreluctant Hermes                                                   15 Shall give me words to say.     L   When I behold the pharos shine And lay a path along the sea, How gladly I shall feel the spray, Standing upon the swinging prow;  And question of my pilot old,                                             5 How many watery leagues to sail Ere we shall round the harbour reef And anchor off the wharves of home!     LI   Is the day long, O Lesbian maiden, And the night endless In thy lone chamber In Mitylene?                                                              5  All the bright day, Until welcome evening When the stars kindle Over the harbour, What tasks employ thee?                                                  10  Passing the fountain At golden sundown, One of the home-going Traffickers, hast thou Thought of thy lover?                                                    15  Nay, but how far Too brief will the night be, When I returning To the dear portal Hear my own heart beat!                                                  20     LII   Lo, on the distance a dark blue ravine, A fold in the mountainous forests of fir, Cleft from the sky-line sheer down to the shore!  Above are the clouds and the white, pealing gulls, At its foot is the rough broken foam of the sea,                          5 With ever anon the long deep muffled roar,— A sigh from the fitful great heart of the world.  Then inland just where the small meadow begins, Well bulwarked with boulders that jut in the tide, Lies safe beyond storm-beat the harbour in sun.                          10  See where the black fishing-boats, each at its buoy, Ride up on the swell with their dare-danger prows, To sight o’er the sea-rim what venture may come!  And look, where the narrow white streets of the town Leap up from the blue water’s edge to the wood,                          15 Scant room for man’s range between mountain and sea, And the market where woodsmen from over the hill May traffic, and sailors from far foreign ports With treasure brought in from the ends of the earth.  And see the third house on the left, with that gleam                     20 Of red burnished copper—the hinge of the door Whereat I shall enter, expected so oft (L"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12389"],["title","Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics (#4)"],["body","love be your sea-star!), to voyage no more.     LIII   Art thou the top-most apple The gatherers could not reach, Reddening on the bough?   Shall not I take thee?  Art thou a hyacinth blossom                                               5 The shepherds upon the hills Have trodden into the ground?   Shall not I lift thee?  Free is the young god Eros, Paying no tribute to power,                                              10 Seeing no evil in beauty,   Full of compassion.  Once having found the beloved, However sorry or woeful, However scornful of loving,                                              15   Little it matters.     LIV   How soon will all my lovely days be over, And I no more be found beneath the sun,— Neither beside the many-murmuring sea, Nor where the plain-winds whisper to the reeds, Nor in the tall beech-woods among the hills                               5 Where roam the bright-lipped Oreads, nor along The pasture-sides where berry-pickers stray And harmless shepherds pipe their sheep to fold!  For I am eager, and the flame of life Burns quickly in the fragile lamp of clay.                               10 Passion and love and longing and hot tears Consume this mortal Sappho, and too soon A great wind from the dark will blow upon me, And I be no more found in the fair world, For all the search of the revolving moon                                 15 And patient shine of everlasting stars.     LV   Soul of sorrow, why this weeping? What immortal grief hath touched thee With the poignancy of sadness,—   Testament of tears?  Have the high gods deigned to show thee                                   5 Destiny, and disillusion Fills thy heart at all things human,   Fleeting and desired?  Nay, the gods themselves are fettered By one law which links together                                          10 Truth and nobleness and beauty,   Man and stars and sea.  And they only shall find freedom Who with courage rise and follow Where love leads beyond all peril,                                       15   Wise beyond all words.     LVI   It never can be mine To sit in the door in the sun And watch the world go by, A pageant and a dream;  For I was born for love,                                                  5 And fashioned for desire, Beauty, passion, and joy, And sorrow and unrest;  And with all things of earth Eternally must go,                                                       10 Daring the perilous bourn Of joyance and of death,  A strain of song by night, A shadow on the hill, A hint of odorous grass,                                                 15 A murmur of the sea.     LVII   Others shall behold the sun Through the long uncounted years,— Not a maid in after time   Wise as thou!  For the gods have given thee Their best gift, an equal mind                                            5 That can only love, be glad,   And fear not.     LVIII   Let thy strong spirit never fear, Nor in thy virgin soul be thou afraid. The gods themselves and the almightier fates Cannot avail to harm  With outward and misfortunate chance                                      5 The radiant unshaken mind of him Who at his being’s centre will abide, Secure from doubt and fear.  His wise and patient heart shall share The strong sweet loveliness of all things made,                          10 And the serenity of inward joy Beyond the storm of tears.     LIX   Will none say of Sappho, Speaking of her lovers, And the love they gave her,— Joy and days and beauty, Flute-playing and roses,                                                  5 Song and wine and laughter,—  Will none, musing, murmur, “Yet, for all the roses, All the flutes and lovers, Doubt not she was lonely                                                 10 As the sea, whose cadence Haunts the world for ever.”     LX   When I have departed, Say but this behind me, “Love was all her wisdom,   All her care.  “Well she kept love’s secret,—                                           5 Dared and never faltered,— Laughed and never doubted   Love would win.  “Let the world’s rough triumph Trample by above her,                                                    10 She is safe forever   From all harm.  “In a land that knows not Bitterness nor sorrow, She has found out all                                                    15   Of truth at last.”     LXI   There is no more to say now thou art still, There is no more to do now thou art dead, There is no more to know now thy clear mind Is back returned unto the gods who gave it.  Now thou art gone the use of life is past,                                5 The meaning and the glory and the pride, There is no joyous friend to share the day, And on the threshold no awaited shadow.     LXII   Play up, play up thy silver flute; The crickets all are brave; Glad is the red autumnal earth   And the blue sea.  Play up thy flawless silver flute;                                        5 Dead ripe are fruit and grain. When love puts on his scarlet coat,   Put off thy care.     LXIII   A beautiful child is mine, Formed like a golden flower, Cleis the loved one. And above her I value Not all the Lydian land,                                                  5 Nor lovely Hellas.     LXIV   Ah, but now henceforth Only one meaning Has life for me.  Only one purport, Measure and beauty,                                                       5 Has the bright world.  What mean the wood-winds, Colour and morning, Bird, stream, and hill?  And the brave city                                                       10 With its enchantment? Thee, only thee!     LXV   Softly the wind moves through the radiant morning, And the warm sunlight sinks into the valley, Filling the green earth with a quiet joyance,   Strength, and fulfilment.  Even so, gentle, strong and wise and happy,                               5 Through the soul and substance of my being, Comes the breath of thy great love to me-ward,   O thou dear mortal.     LXVI   What the west wind whispers At the end of summer, When the barley harvest Ripens to the sickle,   Who can tell?                                                           5  What means the fine music Of the dry cicada, Through the long noon hours Of the autumn stillness,   Who can say?                                                           10  How the grape ungathered With its bloom of blueness Greatens on the trellis Of the brick-walled garden,   Who can know?                                                          15  Yet I, too, am greatened, Keep the note of gladness, Travel by the wind’s road, Through this autumn leisure,—   By thy love.                                                           20     LXVII   Indoors the fire is kindled; Beechwood is piled on the hearthstone; Cold are the chattering oak-leaves; And the ponds frost-bitten.  Softer than rainfall at twilight,                                         5 Bringing the fields benediction And the hills quiet and greyness, Are my long thoughts of thee.  How should thy friend fear the seasons? They only perish of winter                                               10 Whom Love, audacious and tender, Never hath visited.     LXVIII   You ask how love can keep the mortal soul Strong to the pitch of joy throughout the years.  Ask how your brave cicada on the bough Keeps the long sweet insistence of his cry;  Ask how the Pleiads steer across the night                                5 In their serene unswerving mighty course;  Ask how the wood-flowers waken to the sun, Unsummoned save by some mysterious word;  Ask how the wandering swallows find your eaves Upon the rain-wind with returning spring;                                10  Ask who commands the ever-punctual tide To keep the pendulous rhythm of the sea;  And you shall know what leads the heart of man To the far haven of his hopes and fears.     LXIX   Like a tall forest were their spears, Their banners like a silken sea, When the great host in splendour passed Across the crimson sinking sun.  And then the bray of brazen horns                                         5 Arose above their clanking march, As the long waving column filed Into the odorous purple dusk.  O lover, in this radiant world Whence is the race of mortal men,                                        10 So frail, so mighty, and so fond, That fleets into the vast unknown?     LXX   My lover smiled, “O friend, ask not The journey’s end, nor whence we are. That whistling boy who minds his goats So idly in the grey ravine,  “The brown-backed rower drenched with spray,                              5 The lemon-seller in the street, And the young girl who keeps her first Wild love-tryst at the rising moon,—  “Lo, these are wiser than the wise. And not for all our questioning                                          10 Shall we discover more than joy, Nor find a better thing than love!  “Let pass the banners and the spears, The hate, the battle, and the greed; For greater than all gifts is peace,                                     15 And strength is in the tranquil mind.”     LXXI   Ye who have the stable world In the keeping of your hands. Flocks and men, the lasting hills, And the ever-wheeling stars;  Ye who freight with wondrous things                                       5 The wide-wandering heart of man And the galleon of the moon, On those silent seas of foam;  Oh, if ever ye shall grant Time and place and room enough                                           10 To this fond and fragile heart Stifled with the throb of love,  On that day one grave-eyed Fate, Pausing in her toil, shall say, “Lo, one mortal has achieved                                             15 Immortality of love!”     LXXII   I heard the gods reply: “Trust not the future with its perilous chance; The fortunate hour is on the dial now.  “To-day be wise and great, And put off hesitation and go forth                                       5 With cheerful courage for the"]]]
