Many might be saved who now suffer an ignominious and an early death; and many might be so much purified in the furnace of punishment and adversity, as to become the ornaments of that society of which they had formerly been the bane. The vices of mankind must frequently require the severity of justice; but a wise State will direct that severity to the greatest moral and political good. ANON.   LONDON:  PRINTED BY A. STRAHAN, PRINTERS-STREET,  FOR T. CADELL JUN. AND W. DAVIES, IN THE STRAND.  1802.  * * * * *  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT LORD HOBART  His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the War Department, One of the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, etc.  MY LORD,  Feeling myself highly flattered by your permission to inscribe the following pages to your Lordship, I now humbly presume to offer them to your perusal.  The colonists of New South Wales will feel with me, who must ever take an interest in the welfare of the settlement, a high degree of satisfaction at finding the conduct of their affairs placed under the direction of a nobleman who has dignified the amiable virtues of private life by the acquisition of those more splendid talents which characterise a consummate statesman; thus at once rendering himself the object of veneration and of gratitude to his country.  Your Lordship's services in the several high and important situations which you have filled, are too generally known, and too well remembered, to make me apprehensive lest my humble tribute of applause should be mistaken for other than the genuine feelings of one proud of this opportunity to unite his voice with that of a grateful nation.  The settlement whose annalist I have been has had much to struggle with. Its distance from the protecting wing of the parent government, and the unprecedented war which that government, has so long had to conduct, have very much repressed its energies, and detracted from its natural vigour. But, although the distance must ever remain an obstacle, yet now, that your Lordship can uninterruptedly afford a portion of your valuable time and great abilities to the consideration of its interests, it will, I trust, be found to correct its bad habits, and to maintain, with a degree of respectability, its place among the colonial dominions of our much beloved and most gracious Sovereign.  That your Lordship may long be permitted to dispense blessings to New South Wales and other distant countries, and to assist, instruct, and adorn your own, is the ardent and anxious wish of him who has the honour to be, with every sentiment of respect,  MY LORD, Your Lordship's Most obedient, very humble, and devoted servant, DAVID COLLINS  Beaumont Street, June 26, 1802  * * * * *  ADVERTISEMENT  London, 17th June 1802  The very flattering reception which my former _Account of the English Colony in New South Wales_ experienced from a candid and liberal public, has induced me to continue my labours in the character of its historian; having been favoured with materials for this purpose, on the authenticity of which I can safely stake my credit.  Should the reader feel wearied with the detail of crimes and their consequences, the fault lies not with me. I have only to regret that a soil of so much promise has not produced better fruit. Such as there was, I have diligently gathered; and have endeavoured to render it as palatable as the nature of it would allow me. When we reflect that the exotics with which this new plantation is supplied are chiefly the refuse of our domestic nurseries; and duly consider that, however beneficial the act of transplantation may finally be found, it must for a time retard the growth, and will generally protract the fruit for a season, however fertile the original stock, we ought, perhaps, considerably to moderate our expectations. By patient culture, skillfully directed, in a climate so propitious, and a soil so favourable, much may yet be effected: after experience shall have once thoroughly ascertained all the dangers and difficulties necessary to be surmounted, before most judicious cultivators can completely avail themselves of the many local advantages of which the situation is undoubtedly susceptible.  To relieve the mind as much as possible from the contemplation of enormities, and the disgustingly wretched picture which vice must ever exhibit, I have not only interspersed a few notices of rare and curious objects in Natural History peculiar to the Australian regions; but have also inserted the two voyages which were made in the little sloop Norfolk, by Captain Flinders and Mr. Bass, in the order of time in which they occurred, instead of placing them in an Appendix.  The Natives too have contributed to assist me in this part of my undertaking; and some additional light is thrown upon their peculiar manners and customs in the course of the work. It were to be wished, that they never had been seen in any other state than that which the subjoined view of them presents, in the happy and peaceable exercise of their freedom and amusements.  * * * * *  CONTENTS  CHAPTER I  Recapitulation A log prison begun Various impositions practised at the store October Regulations and proceedings of the governor A man found dead A woman murdered Discontents among the Irish, followed by an order Character of the settlers at the river Houses numbered at Sydney Bennillong claims protection from the governor Weather in October November Two victuallers arrive from England Constables elected The _Francis_ returns from Norfolk Island Civil appointment A criminal court held Executions One man hung in chains Effect of this upon the natives Public works December Convicts secreted on board the _Sylph_ Reflections A general muster Regulations A native child murdered Weather  CHAPTER II  The governor visits Richmond-Hill His transactions there A stack of wheat burnt Sawyers punished Price of labour regulated General character of the settlers The clergyman's attention to the children Criminal court assembled Lawrence Davoran The governor goes to Botany Bay George's river Public works Lightning and its effects  CHAPTER III  The wind-mill tried A civil court assembled Difficulty respecting the convicts from Ireland The natives Some buildings begun Weather March Number of men not victualled by the Commissary, who had been convicts An extraordinary theft Court of criminal judicature twice held One man suffers death Price of labour fixed The natives attack the settlers Public works Weather  CHAPTER IV  Report revived of a white woman being with the natives A shoal seen Some civil regulations Natives troublesome The governor goes on an excursion Particulars thereof A valuable tree discovered Weather May The natives burn a house Consequences The Supply arrives from the Cape A ship wrecked to the southward Three of her people brought in by a fishing boat Particulars Two accidents The _Britannia_ arrives from England Vessels and assistance sent to the wreck Public works Cordage wanted The _Mercury_ sails June The Ganges arrives from Ireland Transactions Some runaways taken and brought to trial The _Reliance_ arrives from the Cape A strange desertion Public works New gaol finished  CHAPTER V  The _Francis_ returns from the wreck of the _Sydney Cove_ The _Eliza_ long-boat missing Gale of wind Cattle from the Cape landed Station altered Public works An officer dies Accident on board the _Schooner_ The ships sail for China Coal discovered Natives Bennillong Courts Of justice assembled The _Supply_ condemned The _Cumberland_ seized and carried off to sea Is pursued, but not retaken More coal found; and a new river The people left by Capt.
