Well, I like that,\" stuttered out Sam.  \"You asked me to come, and you know I wanted to come back when the boys told us it might come on to blow; but you called me a 'sissy,' and said I was too timid to own a boat.\"  \"Um--er--well,\" rejoined Bill, somewhat confused, \"that's so. But anyhow, to return to what we were talking about, it's given those kids a great chance to set up as heroes.\"  \"Well, we can work that scheme we were talking about last night on them just as soon as you're ready,\" suddenly remarked Jack. \"That will give them something else to think about.\"  \"Oh, say, Jack, cut it out, won't you?\" pleaded Sam.  \"I don't like the kids any better than you do, but one of them saved my life to-day, and I'm not going into anything that will harm them.\"  \"Hear him rave!\" sneered Jack.  \"Why last night, when we talked it over, you thought it would be a prime joke.  It isn't as if it would hurt them.  It'll just give them something to study up, that's all. They think they're such fine trailers and tracers that it would be a shame not to give them a chance to show what they can do.\"  \"That's right, Sam,\" cut in Bill; \"it's more of a joke than anything else.\"  \"Well,\" agreed Sam weakly, \"if you put it in that way, I suppose it's all right; but I tell you I don't like it.\"  \"Why, you'll have the laugh of your young life after we've pulled the stunt off,\" remarked Bill.  \"When will we do it, Jack?\"  \"Not to-night, that's certain,\" responded the other.  \"I've had enough excitement for one day.\"  \"What's the matter with to-morrow night, then?\"  \"I'm agreeable.  How about you, Sam?\"  \"I wish you fellows would leave me out of it,\" rejoined the bully's timid chum.  \"Like they left you out of their patrol, eh?\" sneered Bill, knowing that he was touching the other on a tender spot.  \"All right, to-morrow night suits me,\" snapped Sam, flushing angrily at Bill's remark--as that worthy had intended he should. \"Here's my house. We'll meet at Bill's 'boudoir.\"'  \"Right you are,\" chuckled Jack.  \"Oh, say, it's going to be the joke of the century!\"     CHAPTER IV  SAM IN DIRE STRAITS   \"Kree-ee-ee!\"  Merritt paused the next morning in front of Tubby's home, and gave the \"call\" of the Eagle Patrol with a not uncreditable resemblance to the scream of a real eagle.  The cry was instantly echoed--though in a rather thicker way--from inside the house, and in a minute Tubby, who knew that some one of the patrol must have uttered the call, appeared at his door, munching a large slice of bread and jam, although it was not more than an hour since breakfast.  \"Say, you, did you ever hear an eagle scream with his mouth full of bread and jam?\" demanded Merritt, as the stout youth appeared.  \"Eagles don't eat bread and jam,\" rejoined Tubby, defending his position.  \"Have some?\"  \"Having had breakfast not more than an hour ago, I'm not hungry yet, thank you,\" politely rejoined the corporal; \"besides, I'm afraid I'd get fat.\"  Dodging the stout youth's blow, the corporal went on:  \"Heard the news?\"  \"No--what news?\" eagerly demanded the other, finishing his light repast.  \"Why, the Dolphin--you know, that fishing boat--picked up Sam's hydroplane at sea and towed it in.  It's in pretty good shape, I hear, although the engine is out of commission and it was half full of water.\"  \"He's a lucky fellow to get it back.\"  \"I should say so,\" replied Merritt; \"but it will cost him a whole lot to reclaim it.  The captain of the Dolphin says he wants fifty dollars for it as salvage.\"  \"Gee!  Do you think Sam's father will give him that much?\" said Tubby, with round eyes.  \"I don't know.  He can afford it all right.  He's made a lot of money out of that boat-building shop, my father says; but he's so stingy that I doubt very much if he will give Sam such a sum.\"  \"Why, here's Sam coming down the street now,\" exclaimed the good-natured Tubby.  \"I wonder if he's heard about it.  Hullo, Sam! Get all the water out of your system?\"  \"I'm all right this morning, if that is what you mean,\" rejoined the other, with dignity.  \"Heard the news about your boat?\" asked Merritt suddenly.  \"No; what about her?  Is she safe?  Who picked her up?\"  \"Wait a minute.  One question at a time,\" laughed Merritt. \"She's safe, all right.  The Dolphin picked her up at sea.  But it will cost you fifty dollars to get her.\"  \"Fifty dollars!\" gasped Sam, turning pale.  \"That's what the skipper of the Dolphin says.  He had a lot of trouble getting a line fast to her, he says, and he means to have the money or keep the boat.\"  \"Oh, well, I'll get it from my father easily enough,\" said Sam confidently, preparing to swagger off down the street.  \"I've got to get my boat back and beat Rob's Flying Fish, and that hydroplane can do it.\"  \"Can you match that?\" exclaimed Merritt to the fat youth, as Sam strolled away.  \"Here he was saved from drowning by the Flying Fish only yesterday, and all he can think of this morning is to promise to beat her.  What makes him so mean, I wonder?\"  \"Just born that way, I guess,\" rejoined the stout youth; \"and as for the Flying Fish saving him, if it hadn't been for a certain Corporal Crawford, he--\"  \"Here, stow that,\" protested Merritt, coloring up.  \"I heard enough of that yesterday afternoon.\"  As the boys had surmised, Sam's father was not at all pleased when he learned that his son wanted fifty dollars.  In fact, he refused point blank to let him have it at all.  \"That boat of yours has cost enough already, and I'm not going to spend any more on it,\" he said angrily, as he turned to his work.  \"But I can't get the hydroplane back if I don't pay it,\" urged Sam. \"I've seen the captain of the Dolphin, and he refuses absolutely to let me have her unless I pay him for his trouble in towing her in.\"  \"I can't help that,\" snapped the elder Redding.  \"What have I got to do with your boat?  Look here!\" he exclaimed, turning angrily and producing a small memorandum book from his pocket and rapidly turning the leaves.  \"Do you know how much I've given you in the last two months?\"  \"N-n-no,\" stammered Sam, looking very much embarrassed, and shuffling about from one foot to the other.  \"Then I'll tell you, young man; it's exactly--let me see--ten, twenty, five, three, fifteen and eight.  That's just sixty-one dollars.  Do you think that money grows on gooseberry bushes? Then there'll be your college expenses to pay.  No, I can't let you have a cent.\"  \"That means that I will lose my boat and the chance of winning the race at the regatta!\" urged Sam gloomily.  \"Well, you should have had more sense than to take that fool hydroplane out into a rough sea.  I told you she wouldn't stand it.  There, go on about your own affairs.  I'm far too busy to loaf about, arguing with you.\"  And with this the hard-featured old boat builder--who had made his money literally by the sweat of his brow--turned once more to his task of figuring out the blue prints of a racing sloop.  Sam saw that it was no use to argue further with his father, and left the shop with no very pleasant expression on his countenance.  \"I'll have to see if I can't borrow it somewhere,\" he mused.  \"If only I was on better terms with Rob Blake, I could get it from him, I guess. His father is a banker and he must have plenty.  I wonder--I wonder if Mr. Blake himself wouldn't lend it to me.  I could give him a note for it, and in three months' time I'd be sure to be able to take it up.\"  With this end in view, the lad started for the Hampton Bank.  It required some courage for a youth of his disposition to make up his mind to beard the lion in his den--or, in other words, to approach Mr. Blake in his office.  For Sam, while bold enough when his two hulking cronies were about, had no real backbone of his own.  After making two or three turns in front of the bank, he finally screwed his courage to the sticking point, and timidly asked an attendant if he could see the banker.  \"I think so.  I'll see,\" was the reply.  In a few seconds the man reappeared, and said that Mr. Blake could spare a few minutes.  Hat in hand, Sam entered the ground-glass door which bore on it in imposing gilt letters the word \"President.\"  The interview was brief, and to Sam most unsatisfactory.  The banker pointed out to him that he was a minor, and as such that his note would be no good; and also that, without the permission of his father, he would not think of lending the youth such a sum.  Much crestfallen, Sam shuffled his way out toward the main door of the bank, when suddenly a voice he recognized caused him to look up.  \"A hundred and twenty-five dollars.  That's right, all shipshape and above board!\"  It was the old captain of Topsail Island, counting over in his gnarled paw one hundred and twenty-five dollars in crisp bills which he had just received from the paying teller.  \"You must be going to be married, captain,\" Sam heard the teller remark jocularly.  \"Not yet a while,\" the captain laughed back.  \"That ther motor uv mine that I left ter be fixed up is goin' ter cost me fifty dollars, and the other seventy-five I'm calculating ter keep on hand in my safe fer a while.  I'm kind uv figgerin' on gettin' a new dinghy--my old one is just plum full uv holes.  I rowed over frum the island this mornin', and I declar' ter goodness, once or twice I thought I'd swamp.\"  Sam slipped out of the bank without speaking to the captain, whom, indeed, since the episode of the melon patch, he had no great desire to encounter.  As he made his way toward his home in no very amiable mood, he was hailed from the opposite side of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12112"],["title","The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol (#5)"],["body","street by Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender.  \"Any news of the boat?\" demanded Jack, as he and Bill crossed over and slapped their crony on the back with great assumed heartiness.  \"Yes, and mighty bad news, too, in one way.  She's safe enough. The Dolphin--that fishing boat--found her and towed her in. But--here's the tough part of it--it's going to cost fifty dollars for salvage to get her from the Dolphin's captain, the old shark!\"  \"Phew!\" whistled Jack Curtiss.  \"Pretty steep.  But I suppose your old man will fork over, eh?\"  \"That's just it,\" grumbled Sam; \"he won't come across with a cent.  I suppose, if I don't pay for the hydroplane's recovery pretty soon, she will be sold at auction.\"  \"That's the usual process,\" observed Bill.  \"Isn't there any way you can raise the wind?\"  \"No, I've tried every one I can think of.  I don't suppose either of you fellows could--\"  \"Nothing doing here,\" hastily cried Jack, not giving the other time to finish.  \"I'm cleaned out, too,\" Bill also hurriedly assured the unfortunate Sam.  \"It looks like everybody but us has coin,\" complained that worthy bitterly.  \"While I was in the bank trying to get old man Blake to take up a note of mine for the sum I need, who should I see in there but that old fossil of a captain from Topsail Island.\"  \"Who grows such fine, juicy melons and keeps such a nice, amiable pet dog,\" laughed Jack, roaring at the recollection of the piratical expedition of which the island dweller had told the boys.  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" shouted Bill in chorus.  \"We'll have to give him another visit soon.\"  \"But what about the old land crab, Sam?\" demanded Jack the next minute. \"What was he doing in the bank?\"  \"Why, drawing one hundred and twenty-five dollars.  Just think of it, and we always figured it out that he was poor.\"  \"A hundred and twenty-five dollars!  I wonder what he's going to do with it?\" wondered Jack, with whom money and its spending was always an absorbing topic.  \"Why, I overheard that, too, as I passed by,\" rejoined Sam. \"He's going to spend some of it for the repairing of his motor, which broke down yesterday, and the rest he's going to keep by him.\"  \"Keep it on the island, you mean?\" demanded Jack, becoming suddenly much interested.  \"That's what he said--keep it in his safe,\" replied Sam.  \"But what good does that do us?\"  \"A whole lot, maybe,\" was the enigmatic reply.  \"See here, Sam, you can win that race if you get your hydroplane?\"  \"I'm sure of it.\"  \"You are going to bet on yourself, of course.\"  \"Sure.  I've got to raise some money somehow.\"  \"Well, I've thought of a way you can borrow the money to get your boat back, and when you win the race you can return it.  Come on, lees go to Bill's den, and we'll have a smoke and talk it over.\"     CHAPTER V  THE BULLY SPRINGS A SURPRISE   That afternoon, in reply to a notice sent round by a runner, the lads of the Eagle Patrol assembled at their armory, and on Leader Rob's orders \"fell in\" to hear the official announcement of the coming camping trip.  As a matter of fact, they had discussed little else for several days, but the first \"regimental\" notification, as it were, was to be made now.  The first duty to be performed was the calling of the roll after \"assembly\" had been sounded--somewhat quaveringly--by little Andy Bowles, the company bugler.  Beside Rob Merritt, Tubby and Andy, there were Hiram Nelson, a tall, lanky youth, whose hands were stained with much fussing with chemicals, for he was a wireless experimenter; Ernest Thompson, a big-eyed, serious-looking lad, whose specialty in the little regiment was that of bicycle scout, as the spoked wheel on his arm denoted; Simon Jeffords, a second-class scout, but who, under Rob's tutelage, was becoming the expert \"wig-wagger\" of the organization; Paul Perkins, another second-class boy, but a hard worker and a devotee of aeronautics; Martin Green, one of the smallest of the Eagle Patrol, a tenderfoot; Walter Lonsdale, also a recruit, and Joe Digby, who, as the last to join the Patrol, was the tenderest of the tenderfeet.  Rob's announcement of the program for the eight days they were to spend on the island was greeted with cheers.  The news that turns were to be taken by two scouts daily at washing dishes and cooking did not awaken quite so much enthusiasm.  Everybody cheered up again, however, when Rob announced that the Flying Fish would be at the disposal of the boys of the patrol.  Corporal Merritt took Rob's place as orator then, and announced that each boy would be assessed one dollar for the expenses of the camp, the remainder of the money necessary for the providing of tents and the provisioning of the camp having been donated by Rob's father, Mr. Wingate, of the yacht club, and the other representative citizens of Hampton who composed the local scout council.  Further excitement was caused by the announcement that following the camp the local committee would pass upon the applications for promotions and honors for the lads of the Patrol, and that it was likely that another patrol would be formed in the village, as several boys had expressed themselves as anxious to form one. The gentlemen having charge of the local scout movement, however, had decided that it would be wiser to wait and see the result of one patrol's training before forming a second one.  \"I'm going to try for an aviator's badge,\" announced Paul Perkins, as Rob declared the official business at an end.  \"Say, Rob, what's the matter with our fixing up a wireless in the camp? I'm pretty sure I can make one that will catch anything in a hundred-mile radius.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" assented Rob; \"if you can do it we can get a lot of good out of it, I don't doubt.\"  \"What's the good of wireless when we've got wig-wagging and the semaphore code,\" spoke up Simon Jeffords, who was inclined to doubt the use of any other form of telegraphy but that in which he had perfected himself.  As for Martin Green, Walter Lonsdale and Joe Digby, they contented themselves with hoping that they might receive their badges as second-class scouts when the camp was over.  \"I can take the whole tests except cooking the meat and potatoes in the 'Billy,'\" bemoaned young Green, a small chap of about thirteen. \"Somehow, they always seem to burn, or else they don't cook at all.\"  \"Well, cheer up, Martin,\" laughed Rob.  \"You'll learn to do it in camp. We'll make you cook for the whole time we're out there, if you like--that will give you plenty of practice.\"  \"No, thank you,\" chimed in Andy Bowles.  \"I've seen some of Mart's cooking, and I think the farther you keep him from the cook fire, the better for the general health of the Eagle Patrol.\"  At this moment there came a rap on the door.  \"Come in!\" shouted Rob.  In reply to this invitation, the door opened and a lad of about fifteen entered.  His face was flushed and he bore in his hand a long sheet of green paper.  \"Hello, Frank Farnham,\" exclaimed Rob glancing at the boy's flushed, excited face.  \"What's troubling you?\"  \"Oh, hello, Rob.  Excuse me for butting in on your ceremonies, but I was told Paul Perkins was here.\"  \"Sure he is, Frank,\" exclaimed Paul, coming forward.  \"What's the matter?  It's much too warm to be flying around the way you seem to have been.  Come in under this fan.\"  He indicated an electrically driven ventilator that was whirring in a corner of the room.  \"Quit your fooling, Paul,\" remonstrated Frank, \"and read this circular. Here.\"  He thrust the green \"dodger\" he carried into the other's hand.  \"What do you think of that, eh?\" demanded Frank, as Paul skimmed it with delighted eyes.  The circular contained the announcement of a lecture on aeronautics by a well-known authority on the subject who had once been a resident of Hampton.  To stimulate interest in the subject, the paper stated that a first prize of fifty dollars, a second prize of twenty-five, and a third prize of ten dollars would be given to the three lads of the town making and flying the most successful models of aeroplanes in a public competition. To win the first prize it would be necessary for the model to fly more than two hundred feet, and not lower, except at the start and end of the flight, than fifty feet above the ground.  The second prize was for the next best flight, and the third for the model approaching the nearest to the winner of the second money.  \"Now, Paul, you are an aeronautic fiend,\" went on Frank, \"So am I, and Hiram has the fever in a mild way.  What's the matter with you two fellows forming a team to represent the Boy Scouts, and I'll get up a team of village boys, to compete for the prizes.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" assented Hiram Nelson.  \"I've got a model almost completed.  It only needs the rubber bands and a little testing and it will be O.K., or at least I hope so.  How about you, Paul?\"  \"Oh, I've got two models that I have got good results from,\" replied the boy addressed.  \"One is a biplane.  She's not so speedy, but very steady; and then I have a model of a Bleriot. I'm willing to enter either of them or both.\"  \"And I've got a model of an Antoinette, and one of a design of my own. I don't know just how well it will work,\" concluded Frank modestly, \"but I have great hopes of carrying off that prize.\"  \"Let's see who else there is,\" pondered Hiram.  \"There's Tom Maloney.  He'll go in, I know; and Ed Rivers and two or three others, and then, by the way, I almost forgot it, I met Sam Redding, Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender, reading a notice of the competition, just before I came up.  Of course, as there is a chance of winning fifty dollars, Jack is going to enter one, and Bill Bender said he would put one in, too.\"  \"What do they know about aeroplanes?\" demanded Paul.  \"Not a whole lot, I guess; but Jack said he was going to get a book that tells how to make one, and Bill said he'd do the same.\"  \"How about Sam?\" inquired Rob.  \"Oh, I guess he's got troubles enough with his hydroplane,\" responded Rob, whose father had told him"]]]
