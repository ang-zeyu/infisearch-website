Which method of treatment is best in the end for the wrong-doer?  It is important to distinguish clearly between the private and the official attitude toward the criminal.  As individuals, who cannot know the motives, we should heed the maxim of Jesus: \"Judge not!\" As public officials whose duty it is to protect society, we are under obligation to deal firmly and effectively with the criminal. What would probably have been the result had Cain confessed his crime?  God was far more lenient even with the unrepentant Cain than were his fellow men.  Did God, however, remit Cain's sentence? Cain said, \"I shall become a fugitive and a wanderer on the face of the earth.\"  Was this sense of being an outcast the most painful element in Cain's punishment?  All crime thus in a sense brings its own punishment.  If in placing upon Cain a tribal mark, thereby protecting him from being killed, God apparently aimed to give him an opportunity to reform, the clear implication is that the divine love and care still follow him.  That love and that care never cease toward even the most depraved.  Compare Jesus' attitude toward the criminal, as illustrated in his ministry and especially in his dealing with the woman taken in adultery.  His forgiveness of the woman's sin did not cancel the social results, but gave her a new basis for right living in the future.  She realized that some one believed in her.  Is this one of the most important influences to-day in assisting weak men and in redeeming criminals?  Henry Drummond when asked the secret of his success with men said, \"I love men.\"   V.  HOW TO DEAL WITH CRIMINALS.  The purpose of criminal legislation and administration is clearly the protection of society.  The criminals are punished, not for the mere sake of the punishment or for vengeance, but to deter them from further crime or to serve as a warning to others.  Only on this account can punishment be justified.  To prove an effective warning the punishment for crime should be certain, prompt and just.  For these reasons effective police, upright judges and fair methods of procedure are absolutely essential.  Efforts should be made not to influence the courts by public opinion, and the pernicious prejudgment of cases by popular newspapers should be discountenanced.  The surest method of stopping a criminal's dangerous activity is to reform him; to give him a new and absorbing interest.  Experience at our best reformatories shows that with the indeterminate sentence a very large majority of young criminals can be transformed into safe and useful citizens.  This method is both cheaper and more effective than direct punishment for fixed terms.   VI.  THE PREVENTION OF CRIME.  The best method of dealing with crime is that of prevention.  The work of protecting society against crime should begin with arousing parents to the sense of their responsibilities and by training them thoroughly in the duties of parenthood.  Philanthropic agencies, the church, the schools, the State, may do much both by training character and by removing temptation.  The maintenance of good economic conditions, provision for wholesome amusements, improved sanitation, all tend to remove pernicious influences and strengthen the power of resistance to temptation.  The public press and the theatre, which are at times exceedingly harmful agencies, may be and should be transformed into active moral forces.  In furthering all these reform measures and preventive movements each individual has a personal responsibility, and, as an active citizen, he may render most important service.  The home, the school, the church and the State, all touch the individual on every side and create and together control the influences that make or unmake character.   _Questions for Further Consideration_.  What was the effect of Cain's anger upon his own life?  Gladstone said, \"I do not have time to hate anybody.\"  In what way do anger and hatred hamper one's greatest usefulness? Do you believe in the modern theories regarding the effect of jealousy and hatred upon the body?  Is capital punishment at times a necessity?  What is the most effective argument which can be used to restore honor and manhood to a criminal?  Is there any particular agency at work in your community to assist men who have committed crimes?  Is the chief object of punishment to avenge the wrong, to punish the criminal, to deter others from committing similar crimes, or to reclaim the wrong-doer?   _Subjects for Further Study_.

William Dawson,     _Modern Ideas of Evolution_; Article _Evolution_ in leading     encyclopedias.  When Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every purpose in the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, it was a source of regret that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him to his heart.  Therefore Jehovah said, I will destroy from the face of the ground man whom I have created, for I regret that I have made mankind.  Then Jehovah said to Noah, enter thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee I have found righteous before me in this generation.  And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.  Then Jehovah destroyed everything that existed upon the face of the ground, both man and animals, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens, so that they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only was left and they who were with him in the ark.--Gen. 6:5-8; 7:1, 5, 23 (_Hist. Bible_).  And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing with God; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.  By faith Noah, being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.--_Heb. 11:6, 7_.  Rare is the man who can look back over his life and not confess, at least to himself, that the things which have made him most a man are the very things from which he tried with all his soul to escape.    If we would attain happiness,   We must first attain helpfulness.    But stay! no age was e'er degenerate   Unless men held it at too cheap a rate,   For in our likeness still we shape our fate.     --_Lowell_.   I.  THE TWO BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD.  Careful readers of Genesis 6-9 have long recognized certain difficulties in interpreting the narrative as it now stands.  Thus, for example, in 6:20 Noah is commanded to take into the ark two of every kind of beast and bird; but in 7:2, 3 he is commanded to take in seven of all the clean beasts and birds.  According to 7:4, 12 the flood came as the result of a forty days' rain; but according to 7:11 it was because the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the windows of heaven were opened.  Again, according to 7:17, the flood continued on the earth forty days; while according to 7:24 its duration was a hundred and fifty days.  These fundamental variations and the presence of duplicate versions of the same incidents point, some writers think, to two originally distinct accounts of the flood which have been closely woven together by the final editor of the book of Genesis.  When these two accounts are disentangled, they are each practically complete and apparently represent variant versions of the same flood story. (See _Hist. Bible_, I, 53-56, for these two parallel accounts.) The one, known as the prophetic version, was written, these writers believe, about 650 B.C.  It has the flowing, vivid, picturesque, literary style and the point of view of the prophetic teacher.  In this account the number seven prevails.  Seven of each clean beast and bird are taken into the ark to provide food for Noah and his family.  Seven days the waters rose, and at intervals of seven days he sent out a raven and a dove.  The flood from its beginning to the time when Noah disembarked continued sixty-eight days.  At the end, when he had determined by sending out birds that the waters had subsided, he went forth from the ark and reared an altar and offered sacrifice to Jehovah of every clean beast and bird.  The other and more detailed account is apparently the sequel of the late priestly narratives found in Genesis 1 and 5.  The style is that of a legal writer--formal, exact and repetitious.  In this account only two of each kind of beast and bird are taken into the ark.  The flood lasts for over a year and is universal, covering even the tops of the highest mountains.  No animals are sacrificed, for according to the priestly writer this custom was first instituted by Moses.  When the flood subsides, however, a covenant is concluded and is sealed by the rainbow in accordance with which man's commission to rule over all other living things is renewed and divine permission is given to each to eat of the flesh of animals, provided only that men carefully abstain from eating the blood.  This later account is dated by this group of modern Biblical scholars about 400 B.C.   II.  THE CORRESPONDING BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORIES.  Closely parallel to these two variant Biblical accounts of the flood are the two Babylonian versions, which have fortunately been almost wholly recovered.  The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],["title","Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#6)"],["body","Babylonian account is found in the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh epic, which comes from the library of Asshurbanipal.  This great conqueror lived contemporaneously with Manasseh during whose reign Assyrian influence was paramount in the kingdom of Judah.  In his quest for healing and immortality Gilgamesh reached the abode of the Babylonian hero of the flood.  In response to Gilgamesh's question as to how he, a mortal, attained immortality the Babylonian Noah recounts the story of the flood.  It was brought about by the Babylonian gods in order to destroy the city of Shurippak, situated on the banks of the Euphrates.  The god Ea gave the warning to his worshipper, the hero of the flood, and commanded him:    Construct a house, build a ship,   Leave goods, look after life,   Forsake possessions, and save life,   Cause all kinds of living things to go up into the ship.   The ship which thou shalt build,--   Exact shall be its dimensions:   Its breadth shall equal its length;   On the great deep launch it.   I understood and said to Ea, my lord:   \"Behold, my lord, what thou hast commanded,   I have reverently received and will carry out.\"  A detailed account then follows of the building of the ark.  Its dimensions were one hundred and twenty cubits in each direction. It was built in six stories, each of which was divided into nine parts.  Plentiful provisions were next carried on board and a great feast was held to commemorate the completion of the ark.  After carrying on board his treasures of silver and gold he adds:    All the living creatures of all kinds I loaded on it.   I brought on board my family and household;   Cattle of the field, beasts of the field, the craftsmen,   All of them I brought on board.  In the evening at the command of the god Shamash the rains began to descend.  Then the Babylonian Noah entered the ship and closed the door and entrusted the great house with its contents to the captain.  The description of the tempest that follows is exceedingly vivid and picturesque.    When the first light of dawn shone forth,   There rose from the horizon a dark cloud, within which Adad thundered,   Nabu and Marduk marched at the front,   The heralds passed over mountains and land;   Nergal tore out the ship's mast,   Ninib advanced, following up the attack,   The spirits of earth raised torches,   With their sheen they lighted up the world.   Adad's tempest reached to heaven,   And all light was changed to darkness.   So great was the havoc wrought by the storm that   The gods bowed down, sat there weeping,   Close pressed together were their lips.  For six days and nights the storm raged, but on the seventh day it subsided and the flood began to abate.  Of the race of mortals, however, every voice was hushed.  At last the ship approached the mountain Nisir which lay on the northern horizon, as viewed from the Tigris-Euphrates valley.  Here the ship grounded.  Then,    When the seventh day arrived,   I sent forth a dove and let it loose,   The dove went forth, but came back;   Because it found no resting-place, it returned:   Then I sent forth a swallow, but it came back;   Because it found no resting-place, it returned.   Then I sent forth a raven and let it loose,   The raven went forth and saw that the waters had decreased;   It fed, it waded, it croaked, but did not return.   Then I sent forth everything in all directions, and offered a sacrifice,   I made an offering of incense on the highest peak of the mountain,   Seven and seven bowls I placed there,   And over them I poured out calamus, cedar wood and fragrant herbs.   The gods inhaled the odor,   The gods inhaled the sweet odor,   The gods gathered like flies above the sacrifice.  At the intercession of Ea, the Babylonian Noah and his wife were granted immortality and permitted \"to dwell in the distance at the confluence of the streams.\"  A later version of the same Babylonian flood story is quoted by Eusebius from the writings of the Chaldean priest Berossus who lived about the fourth century B.C.  According to this version the god Kronos appeared in a dream to Xisuthros, the hero, who, like Noah in the priestly account, was the last of the ten ancient Babylonian kings.  At the command of the god he built a great ship fifteen stadia long and two in width.  Into this he took not only his family and provisions, but quadrupeds and birds of all kinds. When the flood began to recede, he sent out a bird, which quickly returned.  After a few days he sent forth another bird, which returned with mud on its feet.  When the third bird failed to return, he took off the cover of the ship and found that it had stranded on a mountain of Armenia.  The mountain in the Biblical account is identified with Mount Ararat.  Disembarking, the Babylonian Noah kissed the earth and, after building an altar, offered a sacrifice to the gods.  Thus the variations between the older and later Babylonian accounts of the flood correspond in general to those that have been already noted in the Biblical versions.  Which Biblical account does the earliest Babylonian narrative resemble most closely?  In what details do they agree?  Are these coincidences merely accidental or do they point possibly to a common tradition?  How far do the later Biblical and Babylonian accounts agree?  What is the significance of these points of agreement?   III.  HISTORY OF THE BIBLICAL FLOOD STORIES.  On the basis of the preceding comparisons some writers attempt to trace tentatively the history of the flood tradition current among the peoples of southwestern Asia.  A fragment of the Babylonian flood story, coming from at least as early as 2000 B.C., has recently been discovered.  The probability is that the tradition goes back to the earliest beginnings of Babylonian history.  The setting of the Biblical accounts of the flood is also the Tigris-Euphrates valley rather than Palestine.  The description of the construction of the ark in Genesis 6:14-16 is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian account, but the method--the smearing of the ark within and without with bitumen--is peculiar to the Tigris-Euphrates valley.  Many scholars believe, therefore, that Babylonia was the original home of the Biblical flood story.  Its exact origin, however, is not so certain.  Many of its details were doubtless suggested by the annual floods and fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so vividly pictured in the corresponding Babylonian story of the creation.  It may have been based on the remembrances of a great local inundation, possibly due to the subsidence of great areas of land.  In the earliest Hebrew records there is no trace of this tradition, although it may have been known to the Aramean ancestors of the Hebrews.  The literary evidence, however, suggests that it was first brought to Palestine by the Assyrians.  During the reactionary reign of Manasseh, Assyrian customs and Baylonian ideas, which these conquerors had inherited, inundated Judah.  Even in the temple at Jerusalem the Babylonians' gods, the host of heaven, were worshipped by certain of the Hebrews.  The few literary inscriptions which come from this period, those found in the mound at Gezer, are written in the Assyrian script and contain the names of Assyrian officials.  Later when the Jewish exiles were carried to Babylonia, they naturally came into contact again with the Babylonian account of the flood, but in its later form, as the comparisons already instituted clearly indicate.  It is thus possible, these scholars believe, to trace, in outline at least, the literary history of the Semitic flood story in its various transformations through a period of nearly two thousand years.   IV.  AIM OF THE BIBLICAL WRITERS IN RECOUNTING THE FLOOD STORY.  The practical question which at once suggests itself is, What place or right has this ancient Semitic tradition, if such it is, among the Biblical narratives?  At best the historical data which it preserves are exceedingly small and of doubtful value.  Is it possible that the prophetic and priestly historians found these stories on the lips of the people and sought in this heroic way to divest them of their polytheistic form and, in certain respects, immoral implications?  A minute comparison of the Babylonian and Biblical accounts indicates that this may perhaps be precisely what has been done; but the majestic, just God of the Biblical narratives is far removed from the capricious, intriguing gods of the Babylonian tradition, who hang like flies over the battlements of heaven, stupefied with terror because of the destruction which they had wrought.  Each of the Biblical narrators seems to be seeking also by means of these illustrations to teach certain universal moral and religious truths.  In this respect the two variant Biblical narratives are in perfect agreement.  The destruction of mankind came not as the fiat of an arbitrary Deity, but because of the purpose which God had before him in the work of creation, and because that purpose was good.  Men by their sins and wilful failure to observe his benign laws were thwarting that purpose.  Hence in accord with the just laws of the universe their destruction was unavoidable, and it came even as effect follows cause.  On the other hand, these ancient teachers taught with inimitable skill that God would not destroy that which was worthy of preservation.  In each of the accounts the character of Noah stands in striking contrast with those of his contemporaries.  The story as told is not merely an illustration of the truth that righteousness brings its just reward, but of the profounder principle that it is the morally fit who survive.  In both of the versions Noah in a very true sense represents the beginning of a new creation: he is the traditional father of a better race.  To him are given the promises which God was eager to realize in the life of humanity.  In the poetic fancy of the"]]]
