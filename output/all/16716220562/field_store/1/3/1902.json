Hungry-looking fish lay in wait for them, and Longlegs the Blue Heron seemed to have a special liking for them. But the pollywogs were spry, and seemed to have learned to watch out. They seemed to Peter to spend all their time swimming and eating and growing. They grew so fast that it seemed to him that he could almost _see_ them grow. And just imagine how surprised Peter was to discover one day that that very pollywog which he had seen lose his tail had grown a _new_ one. That puzzled Peter more than anything he had seen in a long time.  \"Why, I couldn't do that!\" he exclaimed right out loud.  \"Do what?\" demanded Jerry Muskrat, who happened along just then.  \"Why, grow a new tail like that pollywog,\" replied Peter, and told Jerry all that he had seen. Jerry laughed.  \"You'll see queerer things than that if you watch those pollywogs long enough,\" said he. \"They are a queer lot of babies, and very interesting to watch if you've got the time for it. I haven't. This Smiling Pool is a great kindergarten, and there's something happening here every minute. There's no place like it.\"  \"Are those great big fat pollywogs Grandfather Frog's children, or Old Mr. Toad's?\" asked Peter.  \"Grandfather Frog's last year's children,\" replied Jerry. \"They'll grow into real Frogs this summer, if nothing happens to them.\"  \"Where are Old Mr. Toad's last year's children?\" asked Peter.  \"Don't ask me,\" replied Jerry. \"They hopped away last summer. Never saw anything like the way those Toad youngsters grow. Those Toad pollywogs you see now will turn into real Toads, and be leaving the Smiling Pool in a few weeks. People think Old Mr. Toad is slow, but there is nothing slow about his children. Look at that little fellow over there; he's begun to grow legs already.\"  Peter looked, and sure enough there was a pollywog with a pair of legs sprouting out. They were his fore legs, and they certainly did make him look funny. And only a few days before there hadn't been a sign of legs.  \"My gracious!\" exclaimed Peter. \"What a funny sight! I thought my babies grew fast, but these beat them.\"     X   THE LITTLE TOADS START OUT TO SEE THE WORLD    The world is a wonderful great big place     And in it the young must roam   To learn what their elders have long since learned--     There's never a place like home.  It had been some time since Peter Rabbit had visited the Smiling Pool to watch the pollywogs. But one cloudy morning he happened to think of them, and decided that he would run over there and see how they were getting along. So off he started, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He wondered if those pollywog children of Old Mr. Toad would be much changed. The last time he saw them some of them had just begun to grow legs, although they still had long tails.  He had almost reached the Smiling Pool when great big drops of rain began to splash down. And with those first raindrops something funny happened. Anyway, it seemed funny to Peter. Right away he was surrounded by tiny little Toads. Everywhere he looked he saw Toads, tiny little Toads just like Old Mr. Toad, only so tiny that one could have sat comfortably on a ten-cent piece and still had plenty of room.  Peter's big eyes grew round with surprise as he stared. Where had they all come from so suddenly? A minute before he hadn't seen a single one, and now he could hardly move without stepping on one. It seemed, it really seemed, as if each raindrop turned into a tiny Toad the instant it struck the ground. Of course Peter knew that that couldn't be, but it was very puzzling. And all those little Toads were bravely hopping along as if they were bound for some particular place.  Peter watched them for a few minutes, then he once more started for the Smiling Pool. On the very bank whom should he meet but Old Mr. Toad. He looked rather thin, and his back was to the Smiling Pool. Yes, Sir, he was hopping away from the Smiling Pool where he had been all the spring, singing in the great chorus. Peter was almost as surprised to see him as he had been to see the little Toads, but just then he was most interested in those little Toads.  \"Good morning, Old Mr. Toad,\" said Peter in his most polite manner. \"Can you tell me where all these little Toads came from?\"  [Illustration: \"Can you tell me where all these little Toads came from?\"]  \"Certainly,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"They came from the Smiling Pool, of course. Where did you suppose they came from?\"  \"I--I didn't know. There wasn't one to be seen, and then it began to rain, and right away they were everywhere. It--it almost seemed as if they had rained down out of the sky.\"  Old Mr. Toad chuckled. \"They've got good sense, if I must say it about my own children,\" said he. \"They know that wet weather is the only weather for Toads to travel in. They left the Smiling Pool in the night while it was damp and comfortable, and then, when the sun came up, they hid, like sensible children, under anything they could find, sticks, stones, pieces of bark, grass. The minute this shower came up, they knew it was good traveling weather and out they popped.\"  \"But what did they leave the Smiling Pool for?\" Peter asked.  \"To see the Great World,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"Foolish, very foolish of them, but they would do it. I did the same thing myself when I was their age. Couldn't stop me any more than I could stop them. They don't know when they're well off, but young folks never do. Fine weather, isn't it?\"     XI   OLD MR. TOAD'S QUEER TONGUE    Old Mother Nature doth provide     For all her children, large or small.   Her wisdom foresees all their needs     And makes provision for them all.  If you don't believe it, just you go ask Old Mr. Toad, as Peter Rabbit did, how such a slow-moving fellow as he is can catch enough bugs and insects to keep him alive. Perhaps you'll learn something just as Peter did. Peter and Old Mr. Toad sat in the rain watching the tiny Toads, who, you know, were Mr. Toad's children, leaving their kindergarten in the Smiling Pool and starting out to see the Great World. When the last little Toad had passed them, Old Mr. Toad suddenly remembered that he was hungry, very hungry indeed.  \"Didn't have time to eat much while I was in the Smiling Pool,\" he explained. \"Couldn't eat and sing too, and while I was down there, I was supposed to sing. Now that it is time to quit singing, I begin to realize that I've got a stomach to look out for as well as a voice. See that bug over there on that leaf? Watch him.\"  Peter looked, and sure enough there was a fat bug crawling along on an old leaf. He was about two inches from Old Mr. Toad, and he was crawling very fast. And right while Peter was looking at him he disappeared. Peter turned to look at Old Mr. Toad. He hadn't budged. He was sitting exactly where he had been sitting all the time, but he was smacking his lips, and there was a twinkle of satisfaction in his eyes. Peter opened his eyes very wide.  \"Wha--what--\" he began.  \"Nice bug,\" interrupted Old Mr. Toad. \"Nicest bug I've eaten for a longtime.\"  \"But I didn't see you catch him!\" protested Peter, looking at Old Mr. Toad as if he suspected him of joking.  \"Anything wrong with your eyes?\" inquired Old Mr. Toad.  \"No,\" replied Peter just a wee bit crossly. \"My eyes are just as good as ever.\"  \"Then watch me catch that fly over yonder,\" said Old Mr. Toad. He hopped towards a fly which had lighted on a blade of grass just ahead. About two inches from it he stopped, and so far as Peter could see, he sat perfectly still. But the fly disappeared, and it wasn't because it flew away, either. Peter was sure of that. As he told Mrs. Peter about it afterwards, \"It was there, and then it wasn't, and that was all there was to it.\"  Old Mr. Toad chuckled. \"Didn't you see that one go, Peter?\" he asked.  Peter shook his head. \"I wish you Would stop fooling me,\" said Peter. \"The joke is on me, but now you've had your laugh at my expense, I wish you would tell me how you do it. Please, Mr. Toad.\"  Now when Peter said please that way, of course Old Mr. Toad couldn't resist him. Nobody could.  \"Here comes an ant this way. Now you watch my mouth instead of the ant and see what happens,\" said Old Mr. Toad.  Peter looked and saw a big black ant coming. Then he kept his eyes on Old Mr. Toad's mouth. Suddenly there was a little flash of red from it, so tiny and so quick that Peter couldn't be absolutely sure that he saw it. But when he looked for the ant, it was nowhere to be seen. Peter looked at Old Mr. Toad very hard.  \"Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Toad, that you've got a tongue long enough to reach way over to where that ant was?\" he asked.  Old Mr. Toad chuckled again. With every insect swallowed he felt better natured. \"You've guessed it, Peter,\" said he. \"Handy tongue, isn't it?\"  \"I think it's a very queer tongue,\" retorted Peter, \"and I don't understand it at all. If it's so long as all that, where do you keep it when it isn't in use? I should think you'd have to swallow it to get it out of the way, or else leave it hanging out of your mouth.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Old Mr. Toad. \"My tongue never is in the way, and it's the handiest tongue in the world. I'll show it to you.\"     XII   OLD MR. TOAD SHOWS HIS TONGUE    To show one's tongue, as you well know,     Is not considered nice to do;   But if it were like Mr. Toad's     I'd want to show it--wouldn't you?  I'm quite sure you would. You see, if it were like Old Mr. Toad's, it would be such a wonderful tongue that I suspect you would want everybody to see it. Old Mr. Toad thinks his tongue the most satisfactory tongue in the world. In fact, he is quite sure that without it he couldn't get along at all, and I don't know as he could. And yet very few of his neighbors know anything about that tongue and how different it is from most other tongues. Peter Rabbit didn't until Old Mr. Toad showed him after Peter had puzzled and puzzled over the mysterious way in which bugs and flies"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12630"],["title","The Adventures of Old Mr. Toad (#4)"],["body","whenever they happened to come within two inches or less of Old Mr. Toad.  What Peter couldn't understand was what Old Mr. Toad did with a tongue that would reach two inches beyond his mouth. He said as much.  \"I'll show you my tongue, and then you'll wish you had one just like it,\" said Old Mr. Toad, with a twinkle in his eyes.  He opened his big mouth and slowly ran his tongue out its full length. \"Why! Why-ee!\" exclaimed Peter. \"It's fastened at the wrong end!\"  \"No such thing!\" replied Old Mr. Toad indignantly. \"If it was fastened at the other end, how could I run it out so far?\"  \"But mine and all other tongues that I ever have seen are fastened way down in the throat,\" protested Peter. \"Yours is fastened at the other end, way in the very front of your mouth. I never heard of such a thing.\"  \"There are a great many things you have never heard of, Peter Rabbit,\" replied Old Mr. Toad drily. \"Mine is the right way to have a tongue. Because it is fastened way up in the front of my mouth that way, I can use the whole of it. You see it goes out its full length. Then, when I draw it in with a bug on the end of it, I just turn it over so that the end that was out goes way back in my throat and takes the bug with it to just the right place to swallow.\"  Peter thought this over for a few minutes before he ventured another question. \"I begin to understand,\" said he, \"but how do you hold on to the bug with your tongue?\"  \"My tongue is sticky, of course, Mr. Stupid,\" replied Old Mr. Toad, looking very much disgusted. \"Just let me touch a bug with it, and he's mine every time.\"  Peter thought this over. Then he felt of his own tongue. \"Mine isn't sticky,\" said he very innocently.  Old Mr. Toad laughed right out. \"Perhaps if it was, you couldn't ask so many questions,\" said he. \"Now watch me catch that fly.\" His funny little tongue darted out, and the fly was gone.  [Illustration: His funny little tongue darted out, and the fly was gone.]  \"It certainly is very handy,\" said Peter politely. \"I think we are going to have more rain, and I'd better be getting back to the dear Old Briarpatch. Very much obliged to you, Mr. Toad. I think you are very wonderful.\"  \"Not at all,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"I've simply got the things I need in order to live, just as you have the things you need. I couldn't get along with your kind of a tongue, but no more could you get along with mine. If you live long enough, you will learn that Old Mother Nature makes no mistakes. She gives each of us what we need, and each one has different needs.\"     XIII   PETER RABBIT IS IMPOLITE  Peter Rabbit couldn't get Old Mr. Toad off his mind. He had discovered so many interesting things about Old Mr. Toad that he was almost on the point of believing him to be the most interesting of all his neighbors. And his respect for Old Mr. Toad had become very great indeed. Of course. Who wouldn't respect any one with such beautiful eyes and such a sweet voice and such a wonderful tongue? Yet at the same time Peter felt very foolish whenever he remembered that all his life he had been acquainted with Old Mr. Toad without really knowing him at all. There was one comforting thought, and that was that most of his neighbors were just as ignorant regarding Old Mr. Toad as Peter had been.  \"Funny,\" mused Peter, \"how we can live right beside people all our lives and not really know them at all. I suppose that is why we should never judge people hastily. I believe I will go hunt up Old Mr. Toad and see if I can find out anything more.\"  Off started Peter, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He didn't know just where to go, now that Old Mr. Toad had left the Smiling Pool, but he had an idea that he would not be far from their meeting place of the day before, when Old Mr. Toad had explained about his wonderful tongue. But when he got there, Peter found no trace of Old Mr. Toad. You see, it had rained the day before, and that is just the kind of weather that a Toad likes best for traveling. Peter ought to have thought of that, but he didn't. He hunted for awhile and finally gave it up and started up the Crooked Little Path with the idea of running over for a call on Johnny Chuck in the Old Orchard.  Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was shining his brightest, and Peter soon forgot all about Old Mr. Toad. He scampered along up the Crooked Little Path, thinking of nothing in particular but how good it was to be alive, and occasionally kicking up his heels for pure joy. He had just done this when his ears caught the sound of a queer noise a little to one side of the Crooked Little Path. Instantly Peter stopped and sat up to listen. There it was again, and it seemed to come from under an old piece of board. It was just a little, rustling sound, hardly to be heard.  \"There's some one under that old board,\" thought Peter, and peeped under. All he could see was that there was something moving. Instantly Peter was all curiosity. Whoever was there was not very big. He was sure of that. Of course that meant that he had nothing to fear. So what do you think Peter did? Why, he just pulled that old board over. And when he did that, he saw, whom do you think? Why, Old Mr. Toad, to be sure.  But such a sight as Old Mr. Toad was! Peter just stared. For a full minute he couldn't find his voice. Old Mr. Toad was changing his clothes! Yes, Sir, that is just what Old Mr. Toad was doing. He was taking off his old suit, and under it was a brand new one. But such a time as he was having! He was opening and shutting his big mouth, and drawing his hind legs under him, and rubbing them against his body. Then Peter saw a strange thing. He saw that Old Mr. Toad's old suit had split in several places, and he was getting it off by sucking it into his mouth!  In a few minutes his hind legs were free of the old suit, and little by little it began to be pulled free from his body. All the time Old Mr. Toad was working very hard to suck it at the corners of his big mouth. He glared angrily at Peter, but he couldn't say anything because his mouth was too full. He looked so funny that Peter just threw himself on the ground and rolled over and over with laughter. This made Old Mr. Toad glare more angrily than ever, but he couldn't say anything, not a word.  When he had got his hands free by pulling the sleeves of his old coat off inside out, he used his hands to pull the last of it over his head. Then he gulped very hard two or three times to swallow his old suit, and when the last of it had disappeared, he found his voice.  \"Don't you know that it is the most impolite thing in the world to look at people when they are changing their clothes?\" he sputtered.     XIV   OLD MR. TOAD DISAPPEARS    Admit your fault when you've done wrong,   And don't postpone it over long.  Peter Rabbit didn't blame Old Mr. Toad a bit for being indignant because Peter had watched him change his suit. It wasn't a nice thing to do. Old Mr. Toad had looked very funny while he was struggling out of his old suit, and Peter just couldn't help laughing at him. But he realized that he had been very impolite, and he very meekly told Old Mr. Toad so.  \"You see, it was this way,\" explained Peter. \"I heard something under that old board, and I just naturally turned it over to find out what was there.\"  \"Hump!\" grunted Old Mr. Toad.  \"I didn't have the least idea that you were there,\" continued Peter. \"When I found who it was, and what you were doing, I couldn't help watching because it was so interesting, and I couldn't help laughing because you really did look so funny. But I'm sorry, Mr. Toad. Truly I am. I didn't mean to be so impolite. I promise never to do it again. I don't suppose, Mr. Toad, that it seems at all wonderful to you that you can change your suit that way, but it does to me. I had heard that you swallowed your old suits, but I never half believed it. Now I know it is so and just how you do it, and I feel as if I had learned something worth knowing. Do you know, I think you are one of the most interesting and wonderful of all my neighbors, and I'll never laugh at or tease you again, Mr. Toad.\"  \"Hump!\" grunted Old Mr. Toad again, but it was very clear that he was a little flattered by Peter's interest in him and was rapidly recovering his good nature.  \"There is one thing I don't understand yet,\" said Peter, \"and that is where you go to to sleep all winter. Do you go down into the mud at the bottom of the Smiling Pool the way Grandfather Frog does?\"  \"Certainly not!\" retorted Old Mr. Toad. \"Use your common sense, Peter Rabbit. If I had spent the winter in the Smiling Pool, do you suppose I would have left it to come way up here and then have turned right around and gone back there to sing? I'm not so fond of long journeys as all that.\"  \"That's so.\" Peter looked foolish. \"I didn't think of that when I spoke.\"  \"The trouble with you, and with a lot of other people, is that you speak first and do your thinking afterward, when you do any thinking at all,\" grunted Old Mr. Toad. \"Now if I wanted to, I could disappear right here.\"  \"You mean that you would hide under that old board just as you did before,\" said Peter, with a very wise look.  \"Nothing of the sort!\" snapped Old Mr. Toad. \"I could disappear and not go near that old board, not a step nearer than I am now.\"  Peter looked in all directions carefully, but not a thing could he see under which Old Mr. Toad could possibly hide except the old board, and he had said he wouldn't hide under that. \"I don't like to doubt your word, Mr. Toad,\" said he, \"but you'll have to show me before I can believe that.\"  Old Mr. Toad's eyes twinkled. Here was a chance to get even with Peter for watching him change his suit. \"If you'll turn your back to me and look straight down the Crooked Little Path for five minutes, I'll disappear,\" said he. \"More than that, I give you my word of honor that I will not hop three feet from where I am sitting.\"  \"All right,\" replied Peter promptly, turning his back to Old Mr."]]]
