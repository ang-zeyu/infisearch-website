So you see you are up against it\"  Hal and Chester looked at each other, and both smiled faintly.  \"I see we are,\" said Chester.  \"Now, I'll tell you what I can do,\" continued the ambassador. \"I can let you have enough money to keep you until such a time as you will be allowed to leave the country; or, better still, you can come and live with me. What do you say?\"  \"I'm sure we appreciate your kindness very much,\" said Hal, \"and we may be forced to take advantage of it. We shall look about the city this afternoon, and, if nothing else turns up, we shall be glad to stay with you.\"  \"Let me hear from you before night, anyhow,\" said the ambassador, rising.  \"We certainly shall. Come, Chester, let's go out and look around a bit.\"  The boys left the embassy.  The streets of the city were even more densely thronged than they had been the night before. Thousands and thousands of people paraded up and down--war the sole topic of their conversation.  Late in the afternoon, as Hal and Chester were walking along Strassburga Strasse, a hand was suddenly laid on the former's arm, and a voice exclaimed:  \"I thought you boys were on your way to Brussels. How does it happen you are still in Berlin?\"  Turning, Hal perceived that the person who had accosted him was none other than Lieutenant Anderson, and with him was Captain Derevaux.  All four expressed their pleasure at this unexpected meeting, and the boys explained their misfortune.  \"How is it you and Captain Derevaux didn't get away?\" Chester finally asked.  Captain Derevaux smiled.  \"We were so unfortunate as to be recognized by a member of the German general staff at the station this morning,\" he explained, \"and we were detained. But,\" he added grimly, \"we are not figuring upon remaining in Berlin overnight.\"  \"What do you propose to do?\" asked Hal and Chester in a breath.  \"Oh, Anderson and I have a little plan whereby we shall make ourselves scarce on this side of the border,\" answered the captain. \"We are planning to get out of Berlin soon after nightfall.\"  \"How?\" asked Hal.  \"Well,\" said Lieutenant Anderson, \"we haven't perfected our plans yet, but we have an idea that we believe will take us safely out of Germany. It may be successful, and it may not. But we are going to take a chance at it.\"  \"Is it dangerous?\" questioned Chester.  \"That all depends upon how you look at it,\" replied the lieutenant, with a smile. \"It may mean a fight,\" he added seriously, \"but we are prepared for that,\" tapping the pocket of his civilian coat significantly.  \"Yes, it may mean a fight,\" agreed the French captain, \"but an officer of the French army will not shirk an encounter with these German aggressors.\"  \"No, nor an English officer,\" declared the lieutenant. \"War between England and Germany has not been declared yet, but it seems only a question of hours until it will be.\"  Hal was suddenly struck with an idea. He turned to the lieutenant.  \"Why cannot we go with you?\" he asked. \"We must get to Brussels as soon as possible. If we wait here until after the mobilization of all the German forces, and are unable to send a message to mother, she will be frantic. Why cannot we go with you?\"  The lieutenant was taken aback.  \"Why, I know no reason,\" he said, \"except that your presence in our company, if ill fortune should befall us, would probably mean your arrest as enemies of Germany. You might even be convicted as spies, and shot.\"  \"We are willing to take any chances necessary to get us to Brussels and put an end to mother's worries,\" declared Hal stoutly. \"Aren't we, Chester?\"  \"You bet we are,\" replied Chester.  The lieutenant turned to Captain Derevaux. \"What do you say?\" he asked.  The captain shook his head.  \"It's a bad business,\" he replied slowly. \"If we are caught it will go hard with our young friends, I am afraid. Of course, I am willing to do anything in my power to aid them, but this--this, I fear, is impossible.\"  \"Don't say no,\" implored Hal. \"Just think how mother must be worrying. Why, we would go through anything to save her pain. Besides, you don't expect to be captured, do you?\"  The captain shook his head.  \"You have a good plan of escape, I am sure, or you would not tackle it. Isn't that so?\" continued Hal.  The captain admitted it.  \"Would our presence make it more dangerous for you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then, I ask you again, if you won't allow us to go with you, sharing whatever dangers may arise. Besides,\" and Hal smiled, \"you know that four are sometimes better than two.\"  The captain reflected.  \"You are right,\" he said at length. \"If Anderson is agreeable, I shall be glad of your company; yes, and your aid,\" he added, after a pause.  \"I agree with the boys,\" said the lieutenant. \"Four are sometimes better than two, and in an adventure, such as this promises to be, four are always better than two. I say, let them come with us, by all means.\"  And so it was decided. A meeting-place was arranged for eight o'clock that night, and, with this parting injunction, the officers left:  \"Say nothing to anyone. Do not talk, even between yourselves, and, if you can, buy a revolver apiece,\" for the purchase of which the lieutenant tendered Hal a bill.     CHAPTER III.  TOWARD THE FRONTIER.   It was a long afternoon for Hal and Chester, and they waited impatiently for the time when they were to meet the two young men who were to be their companions on the journey.  After several futile attempts the lads finally gave up their attempt to buy revolvers, as it caused too many questions, and, in spite of their eagerness to get away, it was with no little anxiety that they made their way to the rendezvous that night.  Captain Derevaux and Lieutenant Anderson were waiting when the lads arrived.  \"I am glad you are prompt,\" said the former. \"We must hurry. Even now we may be followed,\" and he glanced about furtively.  \"Which way do we go?\" asked Hal, of the young Englishman, as the four moved along the street.  \"North,\" was the reply. \"We are heading for Kolberg, on the Baltic Sea. From there we will try to get across into Denmark. The thing to do is to get out of Germany at the earliest possible moment, and, with good luck in getting a boat of some kind at Kolberg, that is the quickest route.\"  \"Won't we have trouble getting a boat?\"  \"I am afraid we shall; but we must leave something to chance.\"  \"Well, I guess we won't be any worse off in Kolberg than in Berlin,\" said Hal. \"How do you figure to get there?\"  \"Automobile! We have arranged for a car to pick us up on the northern outskirts of the city, just inside the line.\"  \"Won't the place be guarded?\"  \"Of course; but, by a little ingenuity and a bold dash, we should be able to get through. If not--\"  The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders expressively.  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"I won't object to a little excitement.\"  \"Don't worry,\" replied the young officer; \"you will have all the excitement you want, and more, too, or I miss my guess.\"  They continued their walk in silence.  Beyond getting into Denmark, the young officers had formulated no plan. But, once out of Germany, the rest would be easy. A ship to England, and from there into France for the young Frenchman, and the two American boys would telegraph to their mother, or continue their journey alone. Lieutenant Anderson was bound direct for London, where he would join his regiment.  The officers had decided to make their attempt at escape by way of Denmark because, in all likelihood, the country between Berlin and Kolberg would be less closely guarded than any other part of the German Empire. Troops were being rushed to the French and Russian borders, and they realized it was practically impossible for them to journey in those directions without being captured. Also the southern route offered little hope of success.  The streets became more and more deserted as the four friends continued their walk toward the northern outskirts. They passed several detachments of rapidly moving troops, but they were unchallenged.  Suddenly the young Englishman called a halt.  \"The automobile is waiting at the next corner,\" he explained. \"Just beyond is the northern limit of the city. Go quietly and we may not be molested.\"  Hal and Chester were greatly excited by this time, but they obeyed instructions as well as they could, and climbed into the big car that was waiting for them, without even being seen. The driver immediately started the machine, and our boys were on their way at last.  On toward the city line the big car rushed, and it was just as the four friends were breathing a sigh of relief at having passed the first danger safely, that a harsh voice rang out:  \"Halt!\"  Almost directly ahead stood a squad of armed men, their rifles leveled straight at the occupants of the oncoming car.  \"The patrol!\" exclaimed Captain Derevaux, as the auto came to a stop.  An officer approached the side of the machine.  \"Give an account of yourselves,\" he demanded. \"Your passports, please.\"  \"We have none,\" replied Captain Anderson. \"We are just taking a little spin.\"  \"You cannot pass here,\" said the officer. \"Either return at once, or I shall be forced to place you under arrest.\"  There was no use arguing.  \"Home it is, then,\" said the young Englishman aloud, and then in a whisper to the driver: \"Ahead! Full speed!\"  \"To the bottom of the car!\" he cried, as the machine jumped forward with a lurch.  He dived to the floor of the car, the young Frenchman and Hal following his example.  Chester, however, had been so surprised at the suddenness of this maneuver, that for a moment he was unable to move; but, while his momentary inaction placed him in great danger, it nevertheless saved his companions from capture, or even death.  As the automobile lunged away, hurling the officer to the side of the street, the latter shouted a command:  \"Fire! Shoot the driver!\"  One man only was in a position to obey. The others were forced to jump for their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12656"],["title","The Boy Allies at Liège; Or, Through Lines of Steel (#3)"],["body","ves, as the machine bore down on them. This one man, however, raised his rifle and aimed at the driver, just as the car swept by.  The muzzle was right at the side of the car, and a miss would have been almost impossible.  But, before he could fire, Chester sprang to his feet, and, leaning out, grasped the barrel of the weapon in both hands. With a desperate effort, he wrenched it from the soldier's hands, just as he was about to pull the trigger.  Then, at a second command from Lieutenant Anderson, he dropped beside his friends in the bottom of the car, and it was well that he did so.  A volley rang out from behind. The hum of bullets could be heard overhead, and there was the sound of splintering wood, as others crashed into the rear of the auto, but the machine sped on.  Then came a second volley, and the automobile swerved suddenly to one side. The chauffeur groaned, but the car immediately righted itself and continued on its way.  Unmindful of the bullets flying about, Hal sprang to his feet and climbed into the front seat, where the chauffeur was making heroic efforts to keep the car steady, a stream of blood the while pouring from a wound in his head.  \"Give me the wheel!\" cried Hal, as the car lurched from one side of the road to the other, at the imminent risk of turning over.  He climbed in front of the chauffeur and his strong hands grasped the steering wheel just as the man's body relaxed and he fell back unconscious.  Bullets were still flying thick and fast, but the range was too great now for accurate shooting. Still, there was always the chance that one of the leaden messengers would hit Hal and end disastrously the career of the flying machine.  Without even checking the speed of the auto, Hal called to Chester:  \"The chauffeur is badly wounded. Pull him into the rear of the car!\"  \"Slow down!\" came the answer. \"We can't pull him from beneath you while going at this terrific speed.\"  \"Slow down nothing!\" shouted Hal. \"We don't want to be captured after this. You'll have to pull him out!\"  It was no small task, this driving a flying automobile, while a man in whose lap he was almost sitting was being pulled from under him by hands from behind.  Once Hal lost his balance. Throwing out one hand, he grasped the side of the car, and that alone saved him and his friends, too, for that matter.  The car swerved to one side of the road, and just at that instant a sharp curve came into view.  With a desperate effort Hal regained his balance, steadied the machine, and, without even trying to slacken his speed, took the curve on two wheels.  \"Whew!\" he muttered to himself. \"That was a close shave!\"  By this time the body of the chauffeur had been pulled into the back of the car, and Hal slid into his seat.  \"Are you all right?\" came Chester's voice from the rear.  \"All right now,\" replied Hal.  \"You can slow down a bit,\" shouted Lieutenant Anderson. \"We are out of range. We are safe enough now.\"  \"We are safe from bullets, but we are not safe from pursuit,\" Hal called back. \"Do I keep to this road?\"  \"Yes,\" came the reply, \"if you don't run into a ditch or a telegraph pole.\"  \"Oh, I'll run it, all right; and I'll run it on the road, too,\" Hal answered grimly. \"I've made a record on a worse road than this.\"  \"Is the chauffeur badly hurt?\" he called back after a few minutes.  \"No, I don't think so,\" replied the French captain's voice. \"Just a scalp wound. He has lost a lot of blood, and is still unconscious, but I think he will come around all right presently.\"  Hal settled back in his seat and gave his entire attention to the road ahead.  The big car flashed through several small towns, and the dim lights in the homes looked like a string of brilliant spots, so swiftly did they go by. For almost half an hour the terrific speed was continued, and then, at a shouted command from Lieutenant Anderson, Hal slowed down.  \"We should be nearing Angermunde by this time,\" the lieutenant explained, \"and it will never do to go through there at this speed.\"  \"Do you suppose our would-be captors have communicated with the authorities at Angermunde?\" asked the Frenchman.  \"I would not be surprised,\" replied the lieutenant; \"but we must risk it. One thing I am sure of, however, is that our pursuers are not far behind. They will never rest till we are caught. And, for that reason, we cannot afford to waste much time.\"  \"You are right,\" said the captain. \"We must get through Angermunde as quickly and as quietly as possible.\"  Then to Hal he shouted: \"Don't lose your nerve, and keep cool. Be ready to make a dash if you get the word.\"  \"Don't you worry about my nerve,\" Hal replied grimly. \"I'll run right through a thousand Germans, if you say so.\"  \"I guess that will not be necessary,\" broke in the lieutenant, with a laugh, \"but you never can tell what may happen.\"  Hal reduced the speed of the machine even more, and slowly approached the town, the lights of which could be seen in the distance.  It was now nearly midnight, and, as Captain Derevaux suggested, it would be wise to go through the town without attracting attention, if possible.  But this was not to be.  The automobile entered the town, and had proceeded some distance, when Hal called back:  \"I guess we will get through without any trouble, all right.\"  \"Don't be too sure,\" replied the Englishman. \"Always be ready for the unexpected.\"  The words were hardly out of his mouth, when, rounding a sharp turn, Hal saw a line of cavalrymen blocking the street some distance ahead.  \"The road is blocked with troops,\" he called back to his friends, as he reduced his speed. \"Their rifles seem pointed right at us. Shall I speed up and run through them?\"  His three companions arose and peered over his shoulder. The cavalrymen were plainly discernible in the glare of an electric street light.  \"It's impossible,\" replied the lieutenant. \"We shall have to stop. They would shoot us to pieces before we could get through. Here,\" turning to Chester and Captain Derevaux, \"cover up the chauffeur with these rugs and lay him in the bottom of the car. It would never do for an officer to see him. It may be that our friends behind have not tipped off our present enemy, but the sight of this wounded chauffeur would give it all away.\" The car was slowly nearing the line of troops. \"Halt!\" came the command. \"Halt, or we fire!\" The car came to a stop within a few feet of the soldiers.     CHAPTER IV.  IN DANGER STILL.   It was with no small trepidation that the occupants of the automobile saw the officer in command approach.  \"Keep your wits and say nothing unless you have to,\" was the young lieutenant's whispered advice. \"Leave the talking to me.\"  \"Where are you from?\" asked the officer.  \"Berlin,\" replied the Englishman.  \"Where are you bound?\"  \"Stettin.\"  \"Your business?\"  \"Our business is purely private. Two of my companions are young American lads and the third is a Belgian gentleman. I am an Englishman. You will interfere with us at your peril.\"  \"In times of war we interfere with whom we choose. A state of war exists in Germany, as you know.\"  \"There is no state of war between your country and ours.\"  \"Perhaps not, but I am not sure of it; there may be by this time. You have no passports, I take it?\"  \"We have not.\"  \"Then I must ask you to leave your machine and come with me.\"  \"For what reason?\"  \"Because I command it. You are my prisoners.\"  Turning to an aide, the German officer commanded:  \"Call a guard of four men!\"  The aide saluted and did as he was ordered. Four of the troopers who blocked the road dismounted and ranged themselves beside the car.  \"Order Lieutenant Myers to take his men and report to Major Von Volk,\" commanded the German officer of his aide.  The troopers, with the exception of the four who guarded the car, wheeled and rode away.  The officer turned again to the automobile.  \"Leave the car,\" he ordered the four occupants.  \"He evidently hasn't been tipped off,\" whispered Lieutenant Anderson to his companions, as they left the machine.  \"No,\" Hal whispered back, \"but the others are likely to be along in a few minutes.\"  \"Right,\" came the reply. \"We must watch our chance, and, if one comes, make the most of it.\"  The four stepped from the automobile, and were immediately surrounded by their guards.  \"See what they have in the machine,\" the officer ordered one of the men.  \"Great Scott!\" ejaculated Chester. \"We are in for it now!\"  Exploring the front of the auto first, the soldier found nothing. Then he turned his attention to the back. He lifted up the rugs that had been thrown over the chauffeur, and started back with a cry.  \"A dead man!\" he exclaimed, and added: \"At least he appears to be dead. He has a bullet hole in the back of his head.\"  \"What!\" demanded the officer, and hurried to the side of the car.  He drew his sword and waved it at his men.  \"Guard them closely!\" he exclaimed, indicating his four prisoners.  \"Pretty ticklish situation,\" whispered Hal to Chester, who stood beside him. \"We have got to do something.\"  \"You bet,\" replied Chester, \"and we've got to do it now.\"  He took off his cap, twirled it about a few seconds, and let it fall to the ground.  Chester stooped to pick it up. Rising suddenly, he came up under the guard of his nearest captor, and with his head butted him with all his force under the chin.  The blow was more than flesh and blood could stand. The soldier fell to the ground with a groan of pain, his tongue almost bitten off. Without a pause, Chester turned upon another of his captors, and, with two well-directed blows of his fist, sent him staggering.  The suddenness of Chester's attack had not taken Hal by surprise. When Chester dropped his cap, Hal divined his purpose, and, as his friend butted his first victim, Hal acted. Turning upon his nearest guard, he seized the latter's rifle, at the same time delivering a well-directed kick at his enemy's shin. The man released his hold on the rifle, and, as he stooped unconsciously "]]]
