Sam will be waiting off there with the boat,\" rejoined Jack.  \"Yes, if he hasn't lost his nerve,\" was Bill's rejoinder as they shouldered their sacks and slipped off into the deep blackness shrouding the side streets.  \"Well, if he has lost it, he'll come near losing his head, too,\" grated out Jack, \"but don't you fear, he wants that fifty too badly to go back on us.\"  Silently as two cats the cronies made their way down the tree-bordered thoroughfare known as Bailey's Lane and after a few minutes gained the beach.  \"Say, that's an awful hike down to Hank's gilded palace,\" grumbled Bill, \"why didn't you have Sam wait for us off here?\"  \"Yes, and have old man Hudgins discover him when he finds his boat is gone,\" sneered Jack, \"you'd have made a fine botch of this if it hadn't been for me.\"  The two exchanged no further words on the weary tramp along the soft beach.  They plodded along steadily with the silence only broken by a muttered remark emanating from Bill Bender from time to time.  \"Thank heaven, there's the place at last,\" exclaimed Bill, with a sigh of relief, as they came in sight of the miserable hut, \"I began to think that Hank must have moved.\"  Jack gave a peculiar whistle and the next instant the same light the boys had seen earlier in the evening shone through the chinks of the hovel.  \"Well, he's awake, at any rate,\" remarked Jack with a grin, \"now to find out where the boat is.\"  As the wretched figure of the beach-comber appeared Jack hailed him roughly.  \"Where's that boat, Hank?\"  \"Been cruising off and on here since eleven o'clock,\" rejoined the other sullenly, \"ah! there she is now off to the sou'west.\"  He pointed and the boys saw a red light flash twice seaward as if some one had passed their hands across it.  \"All right, give him the answer,\" ordered Jack.  \"We've got to hurry if we're to be back before the captain and those brats of boys get after our trail.\"  Hank at Jack's order dived into the hut and now reappeared with the smoky lantern.  He waved it four times from side to side like a brakeman and in a short time a steady \"put-put!\" told the watchers that a motor boat was approaching.  \"Now for your dinghy, Hank,\" urged Jack, \"hurry up.  You move like a man a hundred and ninety years old, with the rheumatism.\"  \"Well, come on, then,\" retorted Hank, \"here's the boat,\" pointing to a cobbled dinghy lying hauled up above the water line, \"give me a hand and we'll shove off.\"  The united strength of the three soon had the boat in the water and with Hank at the oars they moved steadily toward the chugging motor boat.  \"Well, Sam, you're on the job, I see,\" remarked Jack as the two craft ranged alongside and Sam cut off the engine.  \"Oh, I'm on the job all right,\" rejoined Sam, feeling much braver now that the other two had arrived, \"have you got them all right?\"  \"Right here in this bag, and some more in this, my bucko,\" chuckled Jack as he handed the two sacks over to Sam.  \"Ha!  ha!  ha!\" chortled Bill under his breath as he climbed out of the cobble into the motor boat, \"won't there be a fine row in the morning.\"  \"Well, come on; start up, Sam.  We've no time to lose,\" ordered Jack as he and Bill got aboard, \"good night there, Hank.\"  \"Good night,\" rejoined Hank quietly enough, as the motor boat moved swiftly off over the moonlit sea.  He added to himself, \"It won't be a very 'good night' for you, my lad, if you don't pay me as handsomely as you promised.\"  And chuckling to himself till his shoulders shook, Hank resumed his oars and rowed back to the miserable shanty he called home.     CHAPTER VIII  THE STOLEN UNIFORMS   Rob and his old friend lost no time the next morning in getting down to the water-front to make inquiries about the captain's missing boat.  To their astonishment, however, almost the first craft that caught their eyes as they arrived at the L wharf to begin their search was the old sailor's motor dory, to all appearances in exactly the same position she had occupied the preceding night when the captain moored her.  \"Have I clapped deadlights on my optics, or am I gone plumb locoed?\" bellowed the amazed captain, as he saw the little craft dancing lightly on the sunny waters.  \"You are certainly not mistaken in supposing that is your boat. I'd know her among a thousand,\" Rob assured him.  \"Are you quite certain that she was not here last night, captain?\"  \"Just as sure as I am that yer and me is standin' here,\" rejoined the bewildered captain.  \"I've sailed the seven seas in my day, and man and boy seen many queer things; but if this don't beat cock fightin', I'm an inky Senegambian!\"  The captain's voice had risen to a perfect roar as he uttered the last words, and a sort of jack-of-all-trades about the wharf, whose name was Hi Higgins, came shuffling up, asking what was the trouble.  \"Trouble,\" roared the hermit of Topsail Island.  \"Trouble enough fer all hands and some left over fer the cat!  Say, shipmate, yer hangs about this here L wharf a lot.  Did yer see any piratical humans monkeyin' around my boat last night?\"  \"Why, what d'yer mean, cap'n,\" sniffled Hi Higgins.  \"I seen yer tie up here, and there yer boat is now.  What d'yer mean by pira-pirawell, them parties yer mentioned?  Yer mean some one took it?\"  \"Took it--yes, yer hornswoggled longshore lubber!\" bellowed the captain.  \"I thought yer was hired as a sort uv watchman on this wharf. A find watchman yer are!\"  \"Well, yer see, cap'n,\" returned Hi Higgins, really alarmed at the captain's truculent tone, \"I ain't here much after nine at night or before five in the morning.\"  \"Well, was my boat here at five this mornin'?\" demanded the captain.  \"Sure it was,\" rejoined Hi Higgins, with a sniffle; \"the fust boat I seen.\"  \"Rob, my boy, I'm goin' crazy in my old age!\" gasped the captain. \"I'm as certain as I can be that the boat wasn't here when I came down to the wharf last midnight, but the pre-pon-der-ance of evidence is against me.\"  The captain shook his head gravely as he spoke.  It was evident that he was sorely puzzled and half inclined to doubt the evidence of his own senses.  \"Douse my toplights,\" he kept muttering, \"if this don't beat a flying Dutchman on wheels and with whiskers!\"  \"I certainly don't believe that your eyes deceived you, captain,\" put in Rob, in the midst of the captain's rumbling outbursts. \"It looks to me as if somebody really did borrow your boat last night, and that the decoy note supposed to be from me had something to do with it.\"  \"By the great horn spoon, yer've got it, my boy!\" roared the captain. \"And now yer come ter speak uv it, my mind misgives me that all ain 't right at the island.  I didn't tell yer, but I left a tidy sum uv money in that old iron safe off the Sarah Jane, the last ship I commanded, and all this what's puzzled us so may be part uv some thievish scheme.  \"I'm going ter hurry over ter the island and make certain sure,\" he went on the next minute.  \"The more I think uv it, the more signs uv foul weather I see.  Good-by, my lad, and good luck. Will yer be out ter see me soon?  The bluefish are running fine.\"  \"We may be out this afternoon, captain,\" responded Rob.  \"I am curious myself to see if any mischief has been done on your island.  If there has been,\" he added earnestly, \"you can count on the Eagle Patrol to help you out.\"  \"Thanks, my boy!\" exclaimed the old man, who was bending over his gasoline tank.  \"Hullo!\" he shouted suddenly.  \"I wasn't crazy! This boat was took out last night.  See here!\"  He held up the gasoline measuring stick which he had grabbed up and plunged into the tank.  The instrument was almost dry.  The receptacle for fuel was nearly empty.  \"And I filled her before I started out!\" thundered the captain. \"Whoever took my boat must have run her a long ways.\"  Fresh fuel was soon obtained, and the captain, after more shouted farewells, started for the island to try to obtain some clue to the mysterious happenings of the night.  Rob, after watching him for a few moments, as he sped down the blue waters of the sunlit inlet, turned away to return to his home, just recollecting that, in their eagerness to search for the boat, both he and the captain had entirely forgotten about breakfast.  He was in the middle of the meal, and eagerly explaining to his interested parents the strange incidents of the missing boat and the decoy note, when Merritt Crawford burst into the room unannounced.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" he apologized, abashed.  \"I didn't know you were at breakfast.  But, Mr. Blake--Rob--something has happened that I just had to come and tell you about at once.\"  \"Good gracious!  More mysteries,\" Mr. Blake was beginning in a jocular way, when the serious look on the boy's face checked him. \"What is it? What has happened, Merritt?\" he asked soberly, while Rob regarded the spectacle of his usually placid corporal's excitement with round eyes.  \"The uniforms are all gone!\" burst out Merritt.  \"What uniforms?\"  \"Ours--the Eagle Patrols'.\"  \"What!  Stolen?\"  \"That's right,\" hurried on Merritt.  \"I met old Mrs. Jones in a terrible state of mind.  You know, Mr. Blake, she's the old woman who scrubs out the place in the morning.  I asked what was the matter, and she told me that when she went to the armory early to-day, she found the lock forced and all the lockers broken open and the uniforms gone!\"  \"Have you seen the place?\" asked Mr. Blake.  \"Yes, I followed her up.  The room was turned upside down.  The locks had been ripped right off and the lockers rifled of everything.  Who can have done it?\"  \"I'll bet anything Jack Curtiss and his gang had something to do with it, just as I believe they put up some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12115"],["title","Discoveries in Australia, Volume 1.

THE FOLLOWING WORK IS DEDICATED AS A TRIBUTE TO HIS DISTINGUISHED MERIT, AND AS A TOKEN OF HEARTFELT GRATITUDE AND RESPECT, BY HIS OLD SHIPMATE AND FAITHFUL FRIEND, THE AUTHOR.    INTRODUCTION.  I cannot allow these volumes to go before the public, without expressing my thanks to the following gentlemen for assistance, afforded to me in the course of the composition of this work: To Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S., Hydrographer to the Admiralty, for his kindness in furnishing me with some of the accompanying charts; to Sir John Richardson, F.R.S; J.E. Gray, Esquire, F.R.S.; E. Doubleday, Esquire, F.L.S., and A. White, Esquire, M.E.S., for their valuable contributions on Natural History, to be found in the Appendix; to J. Gould, Esquire, F.R.S., for a list of birds collected during the voyage of the Beagle; to Lieutenants Gore and Fitzmaurice, for many of the sketches which illustrate the work; and to B. Bynoe, Esquire, F.R.C.S., for several interesting papers which will be found dispersed in the following pages.  Captain Owen Stanley, R.N., F.R.S., also merits my warmest thanks, for the important addition to the work of his visits to the Islands in the Arafura Sea.  I have to explain, that when the name Australasia is used in the following pages, it is intended to include Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) and all the islands in the vicinity of the Australian continent.  All bearings and courses, unless it is specified to the contrary, are magnetic, according to the variation during the period of the Beagle's voyage.  The longitudes are generally given from meridians in Australia, as I much question whether any portion of the continent is accurately determined with reference to Greenwich. Sydney, Port Essington, and Swan River, have been the meridians selected; and the respective positions of those places, within a minute of the truth, I consider to be as follows:  Swan River (Scott's Jetty, Fremantle) 115 degrees 47 minutes East.  Port Essington (Government house) 132 degrees 13 minutes East.  Sydney (Fort Macquarie) 151 degrees 16 minutes East.     CONTENTS OF VOLUME 1.   CHAPTER 1.1. INTRODUCTION.  Objects of the Voyage.
