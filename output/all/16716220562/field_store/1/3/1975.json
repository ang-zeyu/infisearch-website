As soon as the bloody garter was brought me, I put it within the Bason, observing in the interim what Mr _Howel_ did, who stood talking with a Gentleman in the corner of my Chamber, not regarding at all what I was doing: but he started suddenly, as if he had found some strange alteration in himself; I asked him what he ailed? I know not what ailes me, but I find that I feel no more pain, methinks that a pleasing kind of freshnesse, as it were a wet cold Napkin did spread over my hand, which hath taken away the inflammation that tormented me before; I replied, since that you feel already so good an effect of my medicament, I advise you to cast away all your Plaisters, onely keep the wound clean, and in a moderate temper 'twixt heat and cold. This was presently reported to the Duke of _Buckingham_, and a little after to the King (James I.), who were both very curious to know the issue of the businesse, which was, that after dinner I took the garter out of the water, and put it to dry before a great fire; it was scarce dry, but Mr _Howels_ servant came running (and told me), that his Master felt as much burning as ever he had done, if not more, for the heat was such, as if his hand were betwixt coales of fire: I answered, that although that had happened at present, yet he should find ease in a short time; for I knew the reason of this new accident, and I would provide accordingly, for his Master should be free from that inflammation, it may be, before he could possibly return unto him: but in case he found no ease, I wished him to come presently back again, if not he might forbear coming. Thereupon he went, and at the instant I did put again the garter into the water; thereupon he found his Master without any pain at all. To be brief, there was no sense of pain afterward: but within five or six dayes the wounds were cicatrized, and entirely healed.\"(1)   (1) _Ibid_., pp. 7-11.   Sir KENELM proceeds, in this discourse, to relate that he obtained the secret of the Powder from a Carmelite who had learnt it in the East. Sir KENELM says that he told it only to King JAMES and his celebrated physician, Sir THEODORE MAYERNE (1573-1655). The latter disclosed it to the Duke of MAYERNE, whose surgeon sold the secret to various persons, until ultimately, as Sir KENELM remarks, it became known to every country barber. However, DIGBY'S real connection with the Powder has been questioned. In an Appendix to Dr NATHANAEL HIGHMORE'S (1613-1685) _The History of Generation_, published in 1651, entitled _A Discourse of the Cure of Wounds by Sympathy_, the Powder is referred to as Sir GILBERT TALBOT'S Powder; nor does it appear to have been DIGBY who brought the claims of the Sympathetic Powder before the notice of the then recently-formed Royal Society, although he was a by no means inactive member of the Society. HIGHMORE, however, in the Appendix to the work referred to above, does refer to DIGBY'S reputed cure of HOWELL'S wounds already mentioned; and after the publication of DIGBY'S _Discourse_ the Powder became generally known as Sir KENELM DIGBY'S Sympathetic Powder. As such it is referred to in an advertisement appended to _Wit and Drollery_ (1661) by the bookseller, NATHANAEL BROOK.(1)   (1) This advertisement is as follows: \"These are to give notice, that Sir _Kenelme Digbies_ Sympathetical Powder prepar'd by Promethean fire, curing all green wounds that come within the compass of a Remedy; and likewise the Tooth-ache infallibly in a very short time: Is to be had at Mr _Nathanael Brook's_ at the Angel in _Cornhil_.\"  The belief in cure by sympathy, however, is much older than DIGBY'S or TALBOT'S Sympathetic Powder. PARACELSUS described an ointment consisting essentially of the moss on the skull of a man who had died a violent death, combined with boar's and bear's fat, burnt worms, dried boar's brain, red sandal-wood and mummy, which was used to cure (?) wounds in a similar manner, being applied to the weapon with which the hurt had been inflicted. With reference to this ointment, readers will probably recall the passage in SCOTT'S _Lay of the Last Minstrel_ (canto 3, stanza 23), respecting the magical cure of WILLIAM of DELORAINE'S wound by \"the Ladye of Branksome\":--    \"She drew the splinter from the wound   And with a charm she stanch'd the blood;   She bade the gash be cleans'd and bound:   No longer by his couch she stood;   But she had ta'en the broken lance,   And washed it from the clotted gore   And salved the splinter o'er and o'er.   William of Deloraine, in trance,   Whene'er she turned it round and round,   Twisted as if she gall'd his wound.   Then to her maidens she did say   That he should be whole man and sound   Within the course of a night and day.   Full long she toil'd; for she did rue   Mishap to friend so stout and true.\"   FRANCIS BACON (1561-1626) writes of sympathetic cures as follows:--\"It is constantly Received, and Avouched, that the _Anointing_ of the _Weapon_, that maketh the _Wound_, wil heale the _Wound_ it selfe. In this _Experiment_, upon the Relation of _Men of Credit_, (though my selfe, as yet, am not fully inclined to beleeve it,) you shal note the _Points_ following; First, the _Ointment_... is made of Divers _ingredients_; whereof the Strangest and Hardest to come by, are the Mosse upon the _Skull_ of a _dead Man, Vnburied_; And the _Fats_ of a _Boare_, and a _Beare_, killed in the _Act of Generation_. These Two last I could easily suspect to be prescribed as a Starting Hole; That if the _Experiment_ proved not, it mought be pretended, that the _Beasts_ were not killed in due Time; For as for the _Mosse_, it is certain there is great Quantity of it in _Ireland_, upon _Slain Bodies_, laid on _Heaps, Vnburied_. The other _Ingredients_ are, the _Bloud-Stone_ in _Powder_, and some other _Things_, which seeme to have a _Vertue_ to _Stanch Bloud_; As also the _Mosse_ hath.... Secondly, the same _kind_ of _Ointment_, applied to the Hurt it selfe, worketh not the _Effect_; but onely applied to the _Weapon_..... Fourthly, it may be applied to the _Weapon_, though the Party Hurt be at a great Distance. Fifthly, it seemeth the _Imagination_ of the Party, to be _Cured_, is not needfull to Concurre; For it may be done without the knowledge of the _Party Wounded_; And thus much hath been tried, that the _Ointment_ (for _Experiments_ sake,) hath been wiped off the _Weapon_, without the knowledge of the _Party Hurt_, and presently the _Party Hurt_, hath been in great _Rage of Paine_, till the _Weapon_ was _Reannointed_. Sixthly, it is affirmed, that if you cannot get the _Weapon_, yet if you put an _Instrument_ of _Iron_, or _Wood_, resembling the _Weapon_, into the _Wound_, whereby it bleedeth, the _Annointing_ of that _Instrument_ will serve, and work the _Effect_. This I doubt should be a Device, to keep this strange _Forme of Cure_, in Request, and Use; Because many times you cannot come by the _Weapon_ it selve. Seventhly, the _Wound_ be at first _Washed clean_ with _White Wine_ or the _Parties_ own _Water_; And then bound up close in _Fine Linen_ and no more _Dressing_ renewed, till it be _whole_.\"(1)   (1) FRANCIS BACON: _Sylva Sylvarum: or, A Natural History... Published after the Authors death... The sixt Edition_ Ã¹.. (1651), p. 217.   Owing to the demand for making this ointment, quite a considerable trade was done in skulls from Ireland upon which moss had grown owing to their exposure to the atmosphere, high prices being obtained for fine specimens.  The idea underlying the belief in the efficacy of sympathetic remedies, namely, that by acting on part of a thing or on a symbol of it, one thereby acts magically on the whole or the thing symbolised, is the root-idea of all magic, and is of extreme antiquity. DIGBY and others, however, tried to give a natural explanation to the supposed efficacy of the Powder. They argued that particles of the blood would ascend from the bloody cloth or weapon, only coming to rest when they had reached their natural home in the wound from which they had originally issued. These particles would carry with them the more volatile part of the vitriol, which would effect a cure more readily than when combined with the grosser part of the vitriol. In the days when there was hardly any knowledge of chemistry and physics, this theory no doubt bore every semblance of truth. In passing, however, it is interesting to note that DIGBY'S _Discourse_ called forth a reply from J. F. HELVETIUS (or SCHWETTZER, 1625-1709), physician to the Prince of Orange, who afterwards became celebrated as an alchemist who had achieved the magnum opus.(1)   (1) See my _Alchemy: Ancient and Modern_ (1911), SESE 63-67.   Writing of the Sympathetic Powder, Professor DE MORGAN wittily argues that it must have been quite efficacious. He says: \"The directions were to keep the wound clean and cool, and to take care of diet, rubbing the salve on the knife or sword. If we remember the dreadful notions upon drugs which prevailed, both as to quantity and quality, we shall readily see that any way of NOT dressing the wound would have been useful. If the physicians had taken the hint, had been careful of diet, _etc_., and had poured the little barrels of medicine down the throat of a practicable doll, THEY would have had their magical cures as well as the surgeons.\"(2) As Dr PETTIGREW has pointed out,(3) Nature exhibits very remarkable powers in effecting the healing of wounds by adhesion, when her processes are not impeded. In fact, many cases have been recorded in which noses, ears, and fingers severed from the body have been rejoined thereto, merely by washing the parts, placing them in close continuity, and allowing the natural powers of the body to effect the healing.

There is a real westerner!\"  Harry Hazelton's eyes sparkled, his whole manner was one of intense interest.  \"Eh?\" queried Tom Reade, turning around from his distant view of a sharp, towering peak of the Rockies.  \"There's the real thing in the way of a westerner,\" Harry Hazelton insisted in a voice in which there was some awe.  \"I don't believe he is,\" retorted Tom skeptically.  \"You're going to say, I suppose, that the man is just some freak escaped from the pages of a dime novel?\" demanded Harry.  \"No; he looks more like a hostler on a leave of absence from a stranded Wild West show,\" Tom replied slowly.  There was plenty of time for them to inspect the stranger in question. Tom and Harry were seated on a mountain springboard wagon drawn by a pair of thin horses.  Their driver, a boy of about eighteen, sat on a tiny make-believe seat almost over the traces.  This youthful driver had been minding his own business so assiduously during the past three hours that Harry had voted him a sullen fellow.  This however, the driver was not.  \"Where did that party ahead come from, driver?\" murmured Tom, leaning forward.  \"Boston or Binghamton?\"  \"You mean the party ahead at the bend of the trail?\" asked the driver.  \"Yes; he's the only stranger in sight.\"  \"I guess he's a westerner, all right,\" answered the driver, after a moment or two spent in thought.  \"There!  You see?\" crowed Harry Hazelton triumphantly.  \"If that fellow's a westerner, driver,\" Tom persisted, \"have you any idea how many days he has been west?\"  \"He doesn't belong to this state,\" the youthful driver answered. \"I think he comes from Montana.  His name is Bad Pete.\"  \"Pete?\" mused Tom Reade aloud.  \"That's short for Peter, I suppose; not a very interesting or romantic name.  What's the hind-leg of his name?\"  \"Meaning his surnames\" drawled the driver.  \"Yes; to be sure.\"  \"I don't know that he has any surname, friend,\" the Colorado boy rejoined.  \"Why do they call him 'Bad'?\" asked Harry, with a thrill of pleasurable expectation.  As the driver was slow in finding an answer, Tom Reade, after another look at the picturesque stranger, replied quizzically:  \"I reckon they call him bad because he's counterfeit.\"  \"There you go again,\" remonstrated Harry Hazelton.  \"You'd better be careful, or Bad Pete will hear you.\"  \"I hope he doesn't,\" smiled Tom.  \"I don't want to change Bad Pete into Worse Pete.\"  There was little danger, however, that the picturesque-looking stranger would hear them.  The axles and springs of the springboard wagon were making noise enough to keep their voices from reaching the ears of any human being more than a dozen feet away.  Bad Pete was still about two hundred and fifty feet ahead, nor did he, as yet, give any sign whatever of having noted the vehicle. Instead, he was leaning against a boulder at the turn in the road.  In his left hand he held a hand-rolled cigarette from which he took an occasional reflective puff as he looked straight ahead of him as though he were enjoying the scenery.  The road---trail---ran close along the edge of a sloping precipice.  Fully nine hundred feet below ran a thin line of silver, or so it appeared.  In reality it was what was left of the Snake River now, in July, nearly dried out.  Over beyond the gulch, for a mile or more, extended a rather flat, rock-strewn valley.  Beyond that were the mountains, two peaks of which, even at this season, were white-capped with snow.  On the trail, however, the full heat of summer prevailed.  \"This grand, massive scenery makes a human being feel small, doesn't it?\" asked Tom.  Harry, however, had his eyes and all his thoughts turned toward the man whom they were nearing.  \"This---er---Bad Pete isn't an---er---that is, a road agent, is he?\" he asked apprehensively.  \"He may be, for all I know,\" the driver answered.  \"At present he mostly hangs out around the S.B. & L. outfit.\"  \"Why, that's our outfits---the one we're going to join, I mean,\" cried Hazelton.  \"I hope Pete isn't the cook, then,\" remarked Tom fastidiously. \"He doesn't look as though he takes a very kindly interest in soap.\"  \"Sh-h-h!\" begged Harry.  \"I'll tell you, he'll hear you.\"  \"See here,\" Tom went on, this time addressing the driver, \"you've told us that you don't know just where to find the S.B. & L. field camp.  If Mr. Peter Bad hangs out with the camp then he ought to be able to direct us.\"  \"You can ask him, of course,\" nodded the Colorado boy.  Soon after the horses covered the distance needed to bring them close to the bend.  Now the driver hauled in his team, and, blocking the forward wheels with a fragment of rock, began to give his attention to the harness.  Bad Pete had consented to glance their way at last.  He turned his head indolently, emitting a mouthful of smoke.  As if by instinct his right hand dropped to the butt of a revolver swinging in a holster over his right hip.  \"I hope he isn't bad tempered today!\" shivered Harry under his breath.  \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" galled Tom, \"but can you tell us-----\"  \"Who are ye looking at?\" demanded Bad Pete, scowling.  \"At a polished man of the world, I'm sure,\" replied Reade smilingly. \"As I was saying, can you tell us just where we can find the S.B. & L.'s field camp of engineers?\"  \"What d'ye want of the camp?\" growled Pete, after taking another whiff from his cigarette.  \"Why, our reasons for wanting to find the camp are purely personal,\" Tom continued.  \"Now, tenderfoot, don't get fresh with me,\" warned Pete sullenly.  \"I haven't an idea of that sort in the world, sir,\" Tom assured him.  \"Do you happen to know the hiding-place of the camp?\"  \"What do you want of the camp?\" insisted Pete.  \"Well, sir, since you're so determined to protect the camp from questionable strangers,\" Tom continued, \"I don't know that it will do any harm to inform you that we are two greenhorns---tenderfeet, I believe, is your more elegant word---who have been engaged to join the engineers' crowd and break in at the business.\"  \"Cub engineers, eh, tenderfoot?\"  \"That's the full size of our pretensions, sir,\" Tom admitted.  \"Rich men's sons, coming out to learn the ways of the Rookies?\" questioned Bad Pete, showing his first sign of interest in them.  \"Not quite as bad as that,\" Tom Reade urged.  \"We're wholly respectable, sir.  We have even had to work hard in order to raise money for our railway fare out to Colorado.\"  Bad Pete's look of interest in them faded.  \"Huh!\" he remarked.  \"Then you're no good either why.\"  \"That's true, I'm afraid,\" sighed Tom.  \"However, can you tell us the way to the camp?\"  From one pocket Bad Pete produced a cigarette paper and from another tobacco.  Slowly he rolled and lighted a cigarette, in the meantime seeming hardly aware of the existence of the tenderfeet.  At last, however, he turned to the Colorado boy and observed:  \"Pardner, I reckon you'd better drive on with these tenderfeet before I drop them over the cliff.  They spoil the view.  Ye know where Bandy's Gulch is?\"  \"Sure,\" nodded the Colorado boy.  \"Ye'll find the railroad outfit jest about a mile west o' there, camped close to the main trail.\"  \"I'm sure obliged to you,\" nodded the Colorado boy, stepping up to his seat and gathering in the reins.  \"And so are we, sir,\" added Tom politely.  \"Hold your blizzard in until I ask ye to talk,\" retorted Bad Pete haughtily.  \"Drive on with your cheap baggage, pardner.\"  \"Cheap baggage, are we?\" mused Tom, when the wagon had left Bad Pete some two hundred feet to the rear.  \"My, but I feel properly humiliated!\"  \"How many men has Bad Pete killed?\" inquired Harry in an awed voice.  \"Don't know as he ever killed any,\" replied the Colorado boy, \"but I'm not looking for trouble with any man that always carries a revolver at his belt and goes around looking for someone to give him an excuse to shoot.  The pistol might go off, even by accident.\"  \"Are there many like Mr. Peter Bad in these hills nowadays?\" Tom inquired.  \"You'll find the foothills back near Denver or Pueblo,\" replied the Colorado youth coldly \"You're up in the mountains now.\"  \"Well, are there many like Peter Bad in these mountains?\" Tom amended.  \"Not many,\" admitted their driver.  \"The old breed is passing. You see, in these days, we have the railroad, public schools, newspapers, the telegraph, electric light, courts and the other things that go with civilization.\"  \"The old days of romance are going by,\" sighed Harry Hazelton.  \"Do you call murder romantic?\" Reade demanded.  \"Harry, you came west expecting to find the Colorado of the dime novels.  Now we've traveled hundreds of miles across this state, and Mr. Bad wore the first revolver that we've seen since we crossed the state line.  My private opinion is that Peter would be afraid to handle his pistol recklessly for fear it would go off.\"  \"I wouldn't bank on that,\" advised the young driver, shaking his head.  \"But you don't carry a revolver,\" retorted Tom Reade.  \"Pop would wallop me, if I did,\" grinned the Colorado boy.  \"But then, I don't need firearms.  I know "]]]
