Delirious days when military bands blared regiment after regiment through lines of cheering thousands; whole companies deluged with flowers, long military trains festooned with blossoms and greenery rolling with clock-like regularity from the stations amid thunderous cheers.  Sad partings were almost unknown, for, of course, no earthly power could withstand the onslaughts of the Kaiser's troops.  God was with them--even their belts and helmets showed that.  So, \"Good-bye for six weeks!\"  The 2nd of September is Sedan Day, and in 1914 it was celebrated as never before.  A great parade was scheduled, a parade which would show German prowess.  Though I arrived in \"Unter den Linden\" two hours before the procession was due, I could not get anywhere near the broad central avenue down which it would pass.  I chartered a taxi which had foundered in the throng, and perched on top.  The Government, always attentive to the patriotic education of the children, had given special orders for such occasions.  The little ones were brought to the front by the police, and boys were even permitted to climb the sacred Linden trees that they might better see what the Fatherland had done.  The triumphal column entered through the Kaiser Arch of the Brandenburger Tor, and bedlam broke loose during the passing of the captured cannon of Russia, France, and Belgium--these last cast by German workmen at Essen and fired by Belgian artillerists against German soldiers at Liege.  The gates of Paris!  Then the clear-cut German official reports became vague for a few days about the West, but had much of Hindenburg and victory in the East.  Democracies wash their dirty linen in public, while absolute governments tuck theirs out of sight, where it usually disappears, but sometimes unexpectedly develops spontaneous combustion.  Nobody--outside of the little circle--questioned the delay in entering Paris.  Everything was going according to plan, was the saying.  I suppose sheep entertain a somewhat similar attitude when their leader conducts them over a precipice.  Antwerp must be taken first--that was the key to Paris and London.  Such was the gossip when the scene was once more set in Belgium, and the great Skoda mortars pulverised forts which on paper were impregnable.  Many a time during the first days of October I left my glass of beer or cup of tea half finished and rushed from cafe and restaurant with the crowd to see if the newspaper criers of headlines were announcing the fall of the fortress on the Scheldt, How those people discussed the terms of the coming early peace, terms which were not by any means easy!  Berlin certainly had its thumbs turned down on the rest of Europe.  With two other Americans I sat with a group of prosperous Berliners in their luxurious club.  Waiters moved noiselessly over costly rugs and glasses clinked, while these men seriously discussed the probable terms Germany would soon impose on a conquered continent. Belgium would, of course, be incorporated into the German Empire, and Antwerp would be the chief outlet for Germany's commerce--and how that commerce would soon boom at the expense of Great Britain! France would now have an opportunity to develop her socialistic experiments, as she would be permitted to maintain only a very small army.  The mistake of 1870 must not be repeated.  This time there would be no paltry levy of five billion francs.  A great German Empire would rise on the ruins of the British.  Commercial gain was the theme.  I did not gather from the conversation that anybody but Germany would be a party to the peace.  A man in close touch with things military entered at midnight.  His eyes danced as he gave us new information about Antwerp.   Clearly the city was doomed.  I did not sleep that night.  I packed.  Next evening I was in Holland.  I saw a big story, hired a car, picked up a _Times_ courier, and, after \"fixing\" things with the Dutch guards, dashed for Antwerp.  The long story of a retreat with the rearguard of the Belgian Army has no place here.  But there were scenes which contrasted with the boasting, confident, joyous capital I had left. Belgian horses drawing dejected families, weeping on their household goods, other families with everything they had saved bundled in a tablecloth or a handkerchief.  Some had their belongings tied on a bicycle, others trundled wheel-barrows. Valuable draught dogs, harnessed, but drawing no cart, were led by their masters, while other dogs that nobody thought of just followed along.  And tear-drenched faces everywhere.  Back in Bergen-op-Zoom and Putten I had seen chalk writing on brick walls saying that members of certain families had gone that way and would wait in certain designated places for other members who chanced to pass.  On the road, now dark, and fringed with pines, I saw a faint light flicker.  A group passed, four very old women tottering after a very old man, he holding a candle before him to light the way.  As I jotted down these things and handed them to my courier I thought of the happy faces back in Berlin, of jubilant crowds dashing from restaurants and cafes as each newspaper edition was shouted out, and I knew that the men in the luxurious club were figuring out to what extent they could mulct Belgium.  I pressed on in the dark and joined the Belgian army and the British Naval Brigade falling back before the Germans.  I came upon an American, now captain of a Belgian company.  \"It's a damn shame, and I hate to admit it,\" he said, \"but the Allies are done for.\" That is the way it looked to us in the black hours of the retreat.  Soldiers were walking in their sleep.  Some sank, too exhausted to continue.  An English sailor, a tireless young giant, trudged on mile after mile with a Belgian soldier on his back.  Both the Belgian's feet had been shot off and tightly bound handkerchiefs failed to check the crimson trail.  London and Paris were gloomy, but Berlin was basking in the bright morning sunshine of the war.   Although the fronts were locked during the winter, the German authorities had good reason to feel optimistic about the coming spring campaign.  They knew that they had increased their munition output enormously, and their spies told them that Russia had practically run out of ammunition, while England had not yet awakened to the realisation that this is a war of shells.  The public saw the result in the spring.  The armies of the Tsar fell back all along the line, while in Germany the flags were waving and the bells of victory were pealing.  All through this there was unity in Germany, a unity that the Germans felt and gloried in.  \"No other nation acts as one man in this wonderful time as do we Germans,\" they told the stranger again and again.  Unity and Germany became synonymous in my mind.  Love of country and bitterness against the enemy are intensified in a nation going to war.  It is something more than this, however, which has imbued and sustained the flaming spirit of Germany during this war.  In July, 1914, the Government deliberately set out to overcome two great forces.  The first was the growing section of her anti-militaristic citizens, and the second was the combination of Great Powers which she made up her mind she must fight sooner or later if she would gain that place in the sun which had dazzled her so long.  Her success against the opposition within her was phenomenal. Germany was defending herself against treacherous attack--that was the watchword.  The Social Democrats climbed upon the band-waggon along with the rest for the joy-ride to victory, and they remained on the band-waggon for more than a year--then some of them dropped off.  The story of how all Germans were made to think as one man is a story of one of the greatest phenomena of history.  It is my purpose in the next few chapters to show how the German Government creates unity.  Then, in later chapters, I will describe the forces tending to disintegrate that wonderful unity.  Germany entered the war with the Government in control of all the forces affecting public opinion.  The only way in which newspaper editors, reporters, lecturers, professors, teachers, theatre managers, and pulpit preachers could hope to accomplish, anything in the world was to do something to please the Government.  To displease the Government meant to be silenced or to experience something worse.     CHAPTER III  THE CRIME AGAINST THE CHILDREN  The boys and girls of Germany play an important part in _die grosse Zeit_ (this great wartime).  Every atom of energy that can be dragged out of the children has been put to practical purpose.  Their little souls, cursed by \"incubated hate,\" have been so worked upon by the State schoolmasters that they have redoubled their energies in the tasks imposed upon them of collecting gold, copper, nickel, brass, paper, acorns, blackberries, blueberries, rubber, woollen and war loan money.  All this summer on release from school, which commences at seven and closes at three in most parts of Germany, the hours varying in some districts, the children, in organised squads, have been put to these important purposes of State.  They had much to do with the getting in of the harvest.  The schoolmaster has played his part in the training of the child to militarism, State worship, and enemy hatred as effectively as the professor and the clergyman.  Here are two German children's school songs, that are being sung daily.  Both of them are creations of the war: both written by schoolmasters.  The particularly offensive song about King Edward and England is principally sung by girls--the future mothers of Germany:--    O England, O England,   Wie gross sind Deine Lugen!   Ist Dein Verbrechen noch so gross,   Du schwindelst Dich vom Galgen los.   O Eduard, O Eduard, du Muster aller"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12418"],["title","The Land of Deepening Shadow: Germany-at-War (#3)"],["body","sten,   Nichts hattest Du von einem Rex,   Du eitler Schlips--und Westenfex.  [Oh, England, oh, England, how great are thy lies!  However great thy crimes, thou cheatest the gallows.  Oh, Edward, oh, Edward, thou model Prince!  Thou hadst nothing kindly in thee, thou vain fop!]    Da druben, da druben liegt der Feind,   In feigen Schutzengraben,   Wir greifen ihn an, und ein Hund, wer meint,   Heut' wurde Pardon gegeben.   Schlagt alles tot, was um Gnade fleht,   Schiesst alles nieder wie Hunde,   Mehr Feinde, mehr Feinde! sei euer Gebet   In dieser Vergeltungsstunde.  [Over there in the cowardly trenches lies the enemy.  We attack him, and only a dog will say that pardon should be given to-day. Strike dead everything which prays for mercy.  Shoot everything down like dogs.  \"More enemies, more enemies,\" be your prayer in this hour of retribution.]  The elementary schools, or _Volksschulen_, are free, and attendance is compulsory from six to fourteen.  There are some 61,000 free public elementary schools with over 10,000,000 pupils, and over 600 private elementary schools, with 42,000 pupils who pay fees.  Germany is a land of civil service; to enter which a certificate from a secondary school is necessary.  Some authorities maintain that the only way to prevent being flooded with candidates is to make the examinations crushingly severe.  Children are early made to realise that all hope of succeeding in life rests upon the passing of these examinations.  Thus the despair which often leads to suicide on the one hand and knowledge without keenness on the other.  Hardly any class has suffered more heavily in the war than the masters of the State schools, which are equivalent to English Council schools and American public schools.   The thinning of their ranks is an eloquent proof of the heaviness of the German death toll.  Their places have been taken by elderly men, but principally by women.  It is a kind of Nemesis that they should have fallen in the very cause they have been propagating for at least a generation.  Those who knew only the old and pleasant Germany do not realise the speeding up of the hate machine that has taken place in the last decade.  The protests against this State creation of hate grow less and less as the war proceeds.  To-day only comparatively few members of the Social-Democrat Party raise objection to this horrible contamination of the minds of the coming generation of German men and women.  Not much reflection is needed to see on what fruitful soil the great National Liberal Party, with its backing of capitalists, greedy merchants, chemists, bankers, ship and mine owners, is planting its seeds for the future.  There is no cure for this evil state of affairs, but the practical proof, inflicted by big cannon, that the world will not tolerate a nation of which the very children are trained to hate the rest of the world, and taught that German _Kultur_ must be spread by bloodshed and terror.  With the change in Germany has come a change in the family life. The good influence of some churches has gone completely.  They are part of the great war machine.  The position of the mother is not what it was.  The old German Hausfrau of the three K's, which I will roughly translate by \"Kids, Kitchen, and Kirk,\" has become even more a servant of the master of the house than she was.  The State has taken control of the souls of her children, and she has not even that authority that she had twenty years ago.  The father has become even more important than of yore.  The natural tendency of a nation of which almost every man is a soldier, is to elevate the man at the expense of the woman, and the German woman has taken to her new position very readily.  She plays her wonderful part in the production of munitions, not as in Britain in a spirit of equality, but with a sort of admitted inferiority difficult to describe exactly.  At four years of age the German male child begins to be a soldier. At six he is accustomed to walk in military formation.  This system has a few advantages, but many disadvantages.  A great concourse of infants can, for example, be marshalled through the streets of a city without any trouble at all.  But that useful discipline is more than counterbalanced by the killing of individuality.  German children, especially during the war, try to grow up to be little men and women as quickly as possible.  They have shared the long working hours of the grown-ups, and late in the hot summer nights I have seen little Bavarian boys and girls who have been at school from seven and worked in the fields from three o'clock till dark, drinking their beer in the beer garden with a relish that showed they needed some stimulant.  The beer is not Bass's ale, but it contains from two to five per cent. of alcohol.  Unhealthy-looking little men are these German boys of from twelve to fifteen during the war.  The overwork, and the lowering of the diet, has given them pasty faces and dark rings round their eyes.  All games and amusements have been abandoned, and the only relaxation is corps marching through the streets at night, singing their hate songs and \"Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles.\"  The girls, in like fashion, often spend their school interval in marching in columns of four, singing the same horrible chants.  Up to the time of the scarcity of woollen materials, the millions of little German schoolgirls produced their full output of comforts for the troops.  The practical result, from a military point of view, of training children to venerate the All-Highest War Lord and his family, together with his ancestors, was shown at the beginning of the war, when there came a great rush of volunteers (_Freiwillige_), many of them beneath the military age, many of them beyond it.  In most of the calculations of German man-power, some ally and neutral military writers seem to have forgotten these volunteers, estimated at two millions.  A significant change in Germany is the cessation of the volunteer movement.  Parents who gladly sent forth their boys as volunteers, are now endeavouring by every means in their power to postpone the evil day in the firm belief that peace will come before the age of military service has been reached.  It is a change at least as significant as that which, lies between the German's \"We have won--the more enemies the better\" of two years back, and the \"We must hold out\" of to-day.  Of the school structures in modern Germany it would be idle to pretend that they are not excellent in every respect--perfect ventilation, sanitation, plenty of space, large numbers of class-rooms, and halls for the choral singing, which is part of the German system of education, and by which the \"hate\" songs have been so readily spread.  The same halls are used for evening lectures for adults and night improvement schools.  It is significant that all the schools built between 1911 and 1914 were so arranged, not only in Germany, but throughout Austria, that they could be turned into hospitals with hardly any alteration. For this purpose, temporary partitions divided portions of the buildings, and an unusually large supply of water was laid on. Special entrances for ambulances were already in existence, baths had already been fitted in the wounded reception rooms, and in many cases sterilising sheds were already installed.  The walls were made of a material that could he quickly whitewashed for the extermination of germs.  If this obvious preparation for war is named to the average German, his reply is, \"The growing jealousy of German culture and commerce throughout the world rendered necessary protective measures.\"  A total lack of sense of humour and sense of proportion among the Germans can be gathered from the fact that Mr. Haselden's famous cartoons of Big and Little Willie, which have a vogue among Americana and other neutrals in Germany, and are by no means unkind, are regarded by Germans as a sort of sacrilege.  These same people do not hesitate to circulate the most horrible and indecent pictures of President Wilson, King George, President Poincare, and especially of Viscount Grey of Falloden.  The Tsar is usually depicted covered with vermin.  The King of Italy as an evil-looking dwarf with a dagger in his hand.  Only those who have seen the virulence of the caricatures, circulated by picture postcard, can have any idea of the horrible material on which the German child is fed.  The only protest I ever heard came from the Artists' Society of Munich, who objected to these loathsome educational efforts as being injurious to the reputation of artistic Germany and calculated to produce permanent damage to the juvenile mind.  The atmosphere of the German home is so different from that in which I have been brought up in the United States, and have seen in England, that the Germans are not at all shocked by topics of conversation never referred to in other countries.  Subjects are discussed before German girls of eleven and twelve, and German boys of the same age, that make an Anglo-Saxon anxious to get out of the room.  I do not know whether it is this or the over-education that leads to the notorious child suicides of Germany, upon which so many learned treatises have been written.  Just before the war it looked as though the German young man and woman were going to improve.  Lawn tennis was spreading, despite old-fashioned prejudice.  Football was coming in.  Rowing was making some progress, as you may have learned at Henley.  It was not the spontaneous sport of Anglo-Saxon countries, but a more concentrated effort to imitate and to excel.  Running races had become lately a German school amusement, but the results, as a rule, were that if there were five competitors, the four losers entered a protest against the winner.  In any case, each of the four produced excellent excuses why he had lost, other than the fact that he had been properly beaten.  A learned American \"exchange professor,\" who"]]]
