Then, brushing aside the protests of Chester and the men, he plunged through the door of the burning building.  Inside he could dimly make out his surroundings. Quickly he scanned the floor for a sight of the occupant, but saw no sign of him. Then, at one side of the barn he made out a ladder, leading to a loft. He ran to it quickly, and as quickly mounted it to the floor above. Once more he turned his eyes upon the floor and peered about.  The heat was intense, and the lad now got his breath with difficulty, so dense was the smoke. He likewise realized that the floor, already blazing, must give way in a few moments, in which event he would be buried in the fiery ruins.  Glancing quickly about he saw there was no window nor opening from which he could jump. He must go out by the way he had come in.  Suddenly his eye lighted upon an object on the floor at the far end of the barn. Quickly he ran toward it and stooped over. The object was a figure of a man, lying upon his face, apparently unconscious. The lad wasted no time in thought. Exerting his utmost strength, he succeeded in hoisting the limp body across his shoulder.  Carrying his human burden he staggered to the ladder and began his descent. It was slow work, for the lad was near exhaustion. He realized that a slip would probably mean death, and in spite of the fact that he realized the necessity for haste, descended slowly.  At last his feet touched the bottom, and turning toward the open door he staggered on.  As he reached the open door the barn behind him collapsed with a terrible crash; but before he lapsed into unconsciousness he saw the face of the man he carried.  \"Anderson!\" he cried, and tumbled over in a dead faint.     CHAPTER IV.  CAPTAIN HARRY ANDERSON.   When Hal returned to consciousness he lay upon the hard ground and Chester was bending over him. Shifting his position slightly the lad saw what was left of his troop standing idly about. At the same moment he felt a hand grasp his and heard a well-known voice exclaim:  \"I owe my life to you, Hal. It seems that you bob up wherever you are needed most.\"  Hal turned and gazed at the speaker. He was Captain Harry Anderson, of His British Majesty's Royal Dragoons, whom the lad had last seen in the hands of the Germans. Then the fight, the burning barn, and his recognition of Anderson just before he had lost consciousness, all came back to him in a flash, and he pressed the hand that grasped his.  \"Lieutenant--I mean Captain Anderson!\" he exclaimed. \"I thought you were safe in the hands of the Germans.\"  The lad arose slowly to his feet, supported by the captain's arm. He staggered a trifle; but, after inhaling a few breaths of the cold, invigorating air, was soon himself again.  \"And I,\" said Captain Anderson, answering Hal's exclamation, \"thought you also were safe in the hands of the Germans.\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, with a faint smile, \"it seems that the enemy did wrong to believe they had any of us safely.\"  \"It does, indeed,\" the captain smiled back; \"but come, tell me how you escaped. I have asked Chester, but he has been so worried about you that he has failed to do so.\"  \"We haven't time now,\" replied Hal. \"We are on a reconnaissance, and must proceed immediately.\"  \"It will be unnecessary,\" replied Anderson dryly. \"I have just come from that way and am in a position to tell you, or General French, either, for that matter, all you desire to know.\"  \"Are you sure?\" asked Hal.  \"Positive,\" replied the captain briefly.  \"In that event,\" said Hal, \"we may as well return, for we shall be wasting time and possibly sacrificing men, to linger here longer.\"  He turned to his men. \"Mount!\" he ordered.  The troop sprang to the saddle. Ordering them to face about, the lad commanded:  \"Forward!\"  The troop set off at a quick trot, Captain Anderson on a spare horse riding between Hal and Chester at their head.  \"Now,\" said the captain, \"you can tell me about yourselves as we ride along.\"  The two lads did so, and when he learned that the lads had seen active service in the eastern theater of war, the captain was greatly surprised.  \"And still I shouldn't be surprised at anything you do or may do,\" he said. \"You see I know you well.\"  \"Come now, captain,\" said Chester, \"tell us something of your own experiences.\"  \"Well,\" said Anderson, \"I have had about as strenuous a time as you can imagine, and I have been at the threshold of death more than once.\"  \"Let's hear about it!\" exclaimed Hal.  \"You remember, of course,\" began the captain, \"how we were captured, and how badly I was wounded? You remember, also, that we were separated in the German camp?\"  The lads signified that they did, and the captain continued:  \"All right, then. It seems that my wounds were more serious than was at first supposed. A fever set in, and my German physician told me that I was a dead man. I laughed at him. I told him I had too much work to do to die yet awhile. He wanted to know what that work was and I told him it was killing Germans. This made him angry, and--\"  \"I don't wonder,\" said Hal dryly.  \"It's a wonder he didn't administer a dose of poison right then,\" said Chester.  \"Yes,\" continued the captain, \"it made him mad, and he informed me that I might as well die, because if I didn't I would be shot anyhow.\"  \"Shot!\" ejaculated Chester. \"What for?\"  \"That's what I asked him. He replied that I had been declared a spy, and that I was to be put to death as soon as I was well enough to face a firing squad. He said they didn't want to do it while I was so ill.\"  \"Very considerate of them,\" commented Hal.  \"Just what I told the surgeon. Well, naturally, with this sentence hanging over my head I didn't get well any quicker than I had to. Every day I could feel myself getting better, but I pretended to get worse. I contracted all the ailments you ever heard of, and I was a sore puzzle to the surgeon. He had several others look me over, but they couldn't agree on what was the matter with me, although they did agree I was a very sick man and had only a few days to linger on this earth. Yet all this time, mind you, I was shamming and getting better every day.\"  \"You must be a pretty good actor,\" said Chester.  \"Well, I'm not so bad,\" replied Captain Anderson modestly. \"But to continue. I finally became afflicted with St. Vitus' dance, and later with a queer ailment that wouldn't allow me to keep still. I'd hop out of bed and wander about, with the surgeons or nurses on my heels, and then I'd fall down in a fit. This continued for several days, and finally they became tired of following me about, figuring, I suppose, that a man in my condition couldn't go very far, anyhow.\"  \"This was what I had been waiting for, but I didn't put the plan I had decided upon into execution at once. I waited for a good chance. At last, it came. The surgeon was a young chap and smooth shaven, which was lucky for me. Also he was about my build, and there was some slight resemblance between us. This day he was with me alone. Not a soul was present save us two. As he turned his back to look into his medicine case, I struck him heavily in the back of the neck.  \"He toppled over without a sound. Quickly I exchanged clothes with him and put his body in my bed, after which I picked up his case and walked boldly out of the hospital.\"  \"Great Scott!\" cried Chester. \"You had plenty of nerve!\"  \"Well,\" continued the captain, \"no one interfered with me and I walked about at will. I kept edging closer and closer to the firing line, figuring that I would make a break for liberty at the first opportunity. It came sooner than I expected.  \"There had been a big battle, and all surgeons and nurses were rushed to the front to look after the wounded. I went along. The battle was over, and we immediately went forth to attend to the wounded. Again I went along, only this time I didn't stop going. When I figured I was far enough ahead I broke into a run.  \"But I wasn't to get away so easily. A surgeon who had been near me saw me take to my heels, and instead of attending to the wounded as he should have done, he raised an alarm. Immediately a troop of horsemen dashed after me. I managed to reach a little woods directly ahead of me in safety and climbed up a tree. The Germans were unable to find me, so when night came I descended from my perch and continued my journey.  \"Soon after daylight I came upon a house, where I asked for food. I still wore the German surgeon's uniform, and here this worked to my disadvantage.\"  \"How was that?\" asked Chester.  \"It seems that the family were Belgians, and I hadn't thought of that. They gave me food and drink all right, but they spilled a little drug of some kind in the drink. The next thing I knew I was bound and gagged and was looking down the muzzle of a revolver held by a ferocious-looking Belgian peasant. He informed me my time had come. I told him I was English, and explained my capture and escape. He listened patiently, but when I finished he informed me that he wasn't going to take any chances. I had just five minutes to live, he said.\"  \"Great Scott!\" cried Hal. \"That was pretty close. How did you escape?\"  \"More by good luck than anything else,\" was the reply. \"There was some kind of a noise behind the peasant and he turned to investigate. At that moment I kicked out with my foot and the toe of my boot caught him squarely under the chin. He went down with a thump. I don't know whether I killed him or not.\"  \"But how did you free your hands?\" asked Hal.  \"Well, I had quite a little trouble, but I managed to drag my chair over to the fire, and held my hands over the blaze until the cord was burned.\"  \"And didn't you burn your hands?\"  \"A little,\" was the quiet response; \"but it had to be done. Then I untied my legs and removed the gag, after which I took to my heels as fast as I could. I didn't care for any more Belgian hospitality to one who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12571"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Trenches; Or, Midst Shot and Shell Along the Aisne (#4)"],["body","a German uniform.  \"In the road I came upon a dead British soldier. I took his uniform and discarded that of the German surgeon. I now began to feel that I was reasonably safe, and I lay down at night and slept like a log, in spite of the cold.  \"I was awakened a little before daylight by the sounds of approaching footsteps. I saw the marchers before they saw me, but still not quite quick enough. They were the same men from whose hands you rescued me only a short while ago.  \"I had been confined in that hospital so long that I was still somewhat weak and I couldn't run fast enough to get away from them. I tried, but it was no use. Then I took a couple of shots at them, and got two or three, I think. I'm not sure, though. Anyhow, I saw this barn ahead, and dashed into it, figuring that I might possibly hold them off.  \"When they set fire to the barn, and I realized I couldn't get out, I gave up. I did shoot one through a crack, but a moment later a shot came through and caught me in the side. That's the last I remember until I returned to consciousness and learned that you had saved me.\"  \"Well,\" said Chester, \"you certainly have had an eventful time.\"  \"There is no question about that,\" Hal agreed. \"But how do you feel now, captain?\"  \"Tip top. And you?\"  \"First rate.\"  The troop continued at a trot, and Hal now believed that they were out of danger--that there was no likelihood of encountering a force of the enemy--and turned to his friends, remarking:  \"Well, we might as well--Hello!\"  He broke off suddenly and checked the pace of his horse.  \"What's up?\" demanded Chester, doing likewise.  For answer Hal pointed down the road. A man was approaching them at a dead run.     CHAPTER V.  ANTHONY STUBBS, WAR CORRESPONDENT.   \"Now, what in the name of all that's wonderful do you suppose is the matter with him?\" ejaculated Chester.  Hal shrugged his shoulders expressively.  \"You've got me,\" he admitted; \"but by the look of him he's not running for fun.\"  \"Right,\" agreed Captain Anderson; \"but whatever is on his trail will have to travel pretty lively to catch him. Look at him come!\"  As the stranger dashed toward them, head hanging and arms working like pistons, the three friends suddenly broke into a loud laugh. A more comical-looking specimen of humanity would be hard to imagine. The friends looked him over carefully as he came on.  Large he was, there could be no mistake about that, but he seemed to be about as wide as he was long. Hal and Chester took in his dimensions with an appraising eye. Stout and chubby, he must have weighed all of 200 pounds, and his height, the lads saw, could not be more than five feet four.  As he tore down the road as fast as his peculiar build would permit, he did not once raise his head, and therefore did not perceive the British troops in his path. The lads could see that his face was red, and that he was puffing and snorting from lack of breath. Not perceiving the men who barred his path, he would have dashed right in among them had not Hal brought him to a sudden stop with a word of command.  \"Halt!\" he cried.  With a gasp of amazement the man halted and gazed at the British as though bewildered. One look he gave them and then exclaimed in a shrill piping voice, in English:  \"You are surrounded! Run, Anthony, run!\"  He suited the action to the word, and, turning in his tracks, ran, puffing and blowing, in the direction from which he had come.  In spite of his merriment at this comical sight, Hal put spurs to his horse and dashed after him. The others did likewise. Hearing the sounds of pursuit, the little stout man redoubled his efforts and puffed on like an engine.  Hal ranged his horse alongside of him, and, restraining his laughter, shouted in a stern tone:  \"Halt! or you are a dead man!\"  The little man needed no further warning. He stopped so quickly that Hal rode on beyond him, while those behind were able to check their horses barely in time to keep from riding over him.  Hal leaped to the ground, and stood over the stranger, who lay panting on the earth where he had fallen the moment he stopped running.  \"Who are you?\" demanded Hal. \"What are you doing here?\"  The little man struggled in vain to reply; but he gasped so wildly for breath that for a moment he was unable to utter a word. Then, as he still panted, his eye fell upon the uniforms of the British troopers. He was on his feet in a moment.  \"I thought you were Germans!\" he exclaimed. \"Great Caesar's ghost! I didn't think I could run another step, but I did; and here I was running from you fellows. What do you mean by chasing an American citizen down the road?\"  He paused and glared at Hal wrathfully. The latter could control his merriment no longer, and burst into a hearty laugh. The others did likewise.  The little man drew himself up indignantly.  \"I say!\" he exclaimed, \"what are you fellows laughing at me for?\"  Hal ceased laughing, and his face took on a stern expression.  \"Who are you?\" he asked briefly. \"A spy, eh?\"  \"A spy! Me a spy?\" exclaimed the man. \"Great Caesar's ghost, no; I'm no spy.\"  \"Who are you, then?\" demanded Hal.  The stranger drew himself up to his full height--and he was still almost as broad as he was long, folded his arms and said proudly:  \"I am Anthony Stubbs, sir, war correspondent of the _New York Gazette_, sir; and I am here in search of news.\"  \"News, eh?\" said Hal. \"It is my belief that you are in search of information to turn over to the Germans.\"  \"You are mistaken, sir,\" replied Anthony, somewhat uncomfortably, the lads could see. \"I assure you on the honor of a Stubbs that I am what I represent myself to he.\"  Hal could keep a straight face no longer. So comical was the little man in his ruffled dignity that the boy was forced to laugh.  \"All right, Mr. Stubbs,\" he said at last, \"I believe you; but tell me, what were you running from when you bumped into us?\"  \"I wasn't running, sir,\" was the reply. \"I heard a large force of the enemy in a field just out of the woods, and I was merely hurrying to a place where I could get a look at them.\"  \"Well, you were hurrying at a pretty good gait,\" said Hal. \"But tell me, is the enemy in force?\"  \"I didn't see any of them,\" said Stubbs, \"but by the sounds of their horses' hoofs, I should say they were in force, sir.\"  \"Where?\" demanded Hal, somewhat anxiously.  \"Straight ahead, sir,\" replied Stubbs, pointing down the road.  \"We thank you, Mr. Stubbs,\" said Hal, \"and we shall now leave you to gather your news while we proceed to reconnoiter.\"  \"And leave me here?\" cried Stubbs.  \"Why, certainly. You are paid to get the news for your paper, are you not?\"  \"But I'm not paid to be shot by the Germans,\" replied Stubbs vehemently. \"Take me with you.\"  How much truth there was in Stubbs' account of a large force of the enemy approaching, Hal, of course, did not know. But the little man appeared so greatly worried that Hal was moved to motion him to one of the spare horses, which had followed the troop.  Stubbs clambered into the saddle with difficulty, and, once astride the animal, he maneuvered so as to get right in among the British cavalrymen, who smiled tolerantly as they surrounded him. Then, at a word from Hal, the troop moved forward at a slow trot.  They rode for perhaps fifteen minutes, and so far Hal had seen no signs of an enemy, nor was there any evidence that a large force had passed that way recently. He turned to Stubbs.  \"I see no sign of the enemy,\" he said. \"Where were they?\"  Stubbs motioned to the left.  \"Beyond the woods, there, in an open field,\" he replied. \"I didn't see them, but I heard 'em, all right. They are probably lying in ambush, and we shall all be killed.\"  Hal halted his men, and, dismounting, plunged into the woods to investigate. At the edge of the woods he came upon a field, and there he saw the \"enemy\" or at least what had caused Stubbs' fright. He broke into a loud laugh, and hurried back.  \"I have found the enemy,\" he said quietly. \"Come, men, I shall show them to you.\"  All dismounted, and Hal led the way, Stubbs following protestingly. At the edge of the woods Hal stopped, and, taking Stubbs by the arm, led him forward.  \"There,\" he said, pointing, \"is the enemy; and I don't believe they chased you very far.\"  Stubbs looked and gasped, then mumbled:  \"I wonder, I wonder--\"  For the objects upon which his eyes rested, the movements of which had sent him scurrying down the road in fear for his life, were nothing more than a drove of about a dozen sheep, which, thrashing about in the field, had led Stubbs to suspect the presence of the Germans.  Stubbs, after the one look, turned and strode majestically to where the horses had been left. The laughter of the troopers rankled in his ears and his face was a dull red. He was mounted when Hal, Chester and the others returned.  \"Stubbs,\" said Hal, as they rode forward again, \"you could have whipped all those fellows yourself.\"  \"Well,\" replied Stubbs, \"they might have been Germans.\"  He lapsed into silence.  Night was fast falling when the British came in sight of a little house, and Hal decided that they would stop there and commandeer something to eat. Accordingly they rode up to the door, where Hal, before dismounting, hailed those within with a shout.  A woman appeared in the door, and learning what the British required, invited them to dismount and enter. This they did, and soon sat down to a substantial repast, Stubbs with them. The war correspondent now became talkative, and entertained with an account of his adventures.  Upon learning that Hal and Chester were American lads, the little man's pleasure knew no bounds.  \"I knew it!\" he exclaimed. \"I knew it the minute I set eyes on you.\"  \"Perhaps that is why you were in such a hurry to get back down the road,\" said Chester.  \"No, no,\" was the reply. \"I knew you were Americans, but I feared, for the moment, that you might be fighting with the Germans.\"  \"Well,\" said Chester shortly, \"I don't imagine"]]]
