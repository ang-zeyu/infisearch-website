(#4)"],["body","Tickell, who enjoy'd a considerable preferment in the North of England. Our poet received his education at Queen's-College in Oxford, of which he was a fellow.  While he was at that university, he wrote a beautiful copy of verses addressed to Mr. Addison, on his Opera of Rosamond. These verses contained many elegant compliments to the author, in which he compares his softness to Corelli, and his strength to Virgil[1].    The Opera first Italian masters taught,   Enrich'd with songs, but innocent of thought;   Britannia's learned theatre disdains   Melodious trifles, and enervate strains;   And blushes on her injur'd stage to see,   Nonsense well tun'd with sweet stupidity.    No charms are wanting to thy artful song   Soft as Corelli, and as Virgil strong.  These complimentary lines, a few of which we have now quoted, so effectually recommended him to Mr. Addison, that he held him in esteem ever afterwards; and when he himself was raised to the dignity of secretary of state, he appointed Mr. Tickell his under-secretary. Mr. Addison being obliged to resign on account of his ill-state of health, Mr. Craggs who succeeded him, continued Mr. Tickell in his place, which he held till that gentleman's death. When Mr. Addison was appointed secretary, being a diffident man, he consulted with his friends about disposing such places as were immediately dependent on him. He communicated to Sir Richard Steele, his design of preferring Mr. Tickell to be his under-secretary, which Sir Richard, who considered him as a petulant man, warmly opposed. He observed that Mr. Tickell was of a temper too enterprising to be governed, and as he had no opinion of his honour, he did not know what might be the consequence, if by insinuation and flattery, or by bolder means, he ever had an opportunity of raising himself. It holds pretty generally true, that diffident people under the appearance of distrusting their own opinions, are frequently positive, and though they pursue their resolutions with trembling, they never fail to pursue them. Mr. Addison had a little of this temper in him. He could not be persuaded to set aside Mr. Tickell, nor even had secrecy enough to conceal from him Sir Richard's opinion. This produced a great animosity between Sir Richard and Mr. Tickell, which subsisted during their lives.  Mr. Tickell in his life of Addison, prefixed to his own edition of that great man's works, throws out some unmannerly reflexions against Sir Richard, who was at that time in Scotland, as one of the commissioners on the forfeited estates. Upon Sir Richard's return to London, he dedicates to Mr. Congreve, Addison's Comedy, called the Drummer, in which he takes occasion very smartly to retort upon Tickell, and clears himself of the imputation laid to his charge, namely that of valuing himself upon Mr. Addison's papers in the Spectator.  In June 1724 Mr. Tickell was appointed secretary to the Lords Justices in Ireland, a place says Mr. Coxeter, which he held till his death, which happened in the year 1740.  It does not appear that Mr. Tickell was in any respect ungrateful to Mr. Addison, to whom he owed his promotion; on the other hand we find him take every opportunity to celebrate him, which he always performs with so much zeal, and earnestness, that he seems to have retained the most lasting sense of his patron's favours. His poem to the earl of Warwick on the death of Mr. Addison, is very pathetic. He begins it thus,    If dumb too long, the drooping Muse hath stray'd,   And left her debt to Addison unpaid,   Blame not her silence, Warwick, but bemoan,   And judge, O judge, my bosom by your own.   What mourner ever felt poetic fires!   Slow comes the verse, that real woe inspires:   Grief unaffected suits but ill with art,   Or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart.  Mr. Tickell's works are printed in the second volume of the Minor Poets, and he is by far the most considerable writer amongst them. He has a very happy talent in versification, which much exceeds Addison's, and is inferior to few of the English Poets, Mr. Dryden and Pope excepted. The first poem in this collection is addressed to the supposed author of the Spectator.  In the year 1713 Mr. Tickell wrote a poem, called The Prospect of Peace, addressed to his excellency the lord privy-seal; which met with so favourable a reception from the public, as to go thro' six editions. The sentiments in this poem are natural, and obvious, but no way extraordinary. It is an assemblage of pretty notions, poetically expressed; but conducted with no kind of art, and altogether without a plan. The following exordium is one of the most shining parts of the poem.    Far hence be driv'n to Scythia's stormy shore   The drum's harsh music, and the cannon's roar;   Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain,   Where Tartar clans, and grizly Cossacks reign;   Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to Matrons cries,   See virgins ravish'd, with relentless eyes,   To death, grey heads, and smiling infants doom.   Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb:   O'er wafted kingdoms spread his wide command.   The savage lord of an unpeopled land.   Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws   From pure religion, and impartial laws,   To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings,   And holds in equal scales the rival kings:   Her gen'rous sons in choicest gifts abound,   Alike in arms, alike in arts renown'd.  The Royal Progress. This poem is mentioned in the Spectator, in opposition to such performances, as are generally written in a swelling stile, and in which the bombast is mistaken for the sublime. It is meant as a compliment to his late majesty, on his arrival in his British dominions.  An imitation of the Prophesy of Nereus. Horace, Book I. Ode XV.--This was written about the year 1715, and intended as a ridicule upon the enterprize of the earl of Marr; which he prophesies will be crushed by the duke of Argyle.  An Epistle from a Lady in England, to a gentleman at Avignon. Of this piece five editions were sold; it is written in the manner of a Lady to a Gentleman, whose principles obliged him to be an exile with the Royal Wanderer. The great propension of the Jacobites to place confidence in imaginary means; and to construe all extraordinary appearances, into ominous signs of the restoration of their king is very well touched.    Was it for this the sun's whole lustre fail'd,   And sudden midnight o'er the Moon prevail'd!   For this did Heav'n display to mortal eyes   Aerial knights, and combats in the skies!   Was it for this Northumbrian streams look'd red!   And Thames driv'n backwards shew'd his secret bed!    False Auguries! th'insulting victors scorn!   Ev'n our own prodigies against us turn!   O portents constru'd, on our side in vain!   Let never Tory trust eclipse again!   Run clear, ye fountains! be at peace, ye skies;   And Thames, henceforth to thy green borders rise!  An Ode, occasioned by his excellency the earl of Stanhope's Voyage to France.  A Prologue to the University of Oxford.  Thoughts occasioned by the sight of an original picture of King Charles the 1st, taken at the time of his Trial.  A Fragment of a Poem, on Hunting.  A Description of the Phoenix, from Claudian.  To a Lady; with the Description of the Phoenix.  Part of the Fourth Book of Lucan translated.  The First Book of Homer's Iliad.  Kensington-Gardens.  Several Epistles and Odes.  This translation was published much about the same time with Mr. Pope's. But it will not bear a comparison; and Mr. Tickell cannot receive a greater injury, than to have his verses placed in contradistinction to Pope's. Mr. Melmoth, in his Letters, published under the name of Fitz Osborne, has produced some parallel passages, little to the advantage of Mr. Tickell, who if he fell greatly short of the elegance and beauty of Pope, has yet much exceeded Mr. Congreve, in what he has attempted of Homer.  In the life of Addison, some farther particulars concerning this translation are related; and Sir Richard Steele, in his dedication of the Drummer to Mr. Congreve, gives it as his opinion, that Addison was himself the author.  These translations, published at the same time, were certainly meant as rivals to one another. We cannot convey a more adequate idea of this, than in the words of Mr. Pope, in a Letter to James Craggs, Esq.; dated July the 15th, 1715.  'Sir,  'They tell me, the busy part of the nation are not more busy about Whig and Tory; than these idle-fellows of the feather, about Mr. Tickell's and my translation. I (like the Tories) have the town in general, that is, the mob on my side; but it is usual with the smaller part to make up in industry, what they want in number; and that is the case with the little senate of Cato. However, if our principles be well considered, I must appear a brave Whig, and Mr. Tickell a rank Tory. I translated Homer, for the public in general, he to gratify the inordinate desires of one man only. We have, it seems, a great Turk in poetry, who can never bear a brother on the throne; and has his Mutes too, a set of Medlers, Winkers, and Whisperers, whose business 'tis to strangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth. The new translator of Homer, is the humblest slave he has, that is to say, his first minister; let him receive the honours he gives me, but receive them with fear and trembling; let him be proud of the approbation of his absolute lord, I appeal to the people, as my rightful judges, and masters; and if they are not inclined to condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high-flying proceeding, from the Court faction at Button's. But after all I have said of this great man, there is no rupture between us. We are each of us so civil, and obliging, that neither thinks he's obliged: And I for my part, treat with him, as we do with the Grand Monarch; who has too many great qualities, not to be respected, though we know he watches any occasion to oppress us.'  Thus we have endeavoured to exhibit an Idea of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12090"],["title","The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume V. (#5)"],["body","writings of Mr. Tickell, a man of a very elegant genius: As there appears no great invention in his works, if he cannot be placed in the first rank of Poets; yet from the beauty of his numbers, and the real poetry which enriched his imagination, he has, at least, an unexceptionable claim to the second.  FOOTNOTE:  [1] Jacob.          *       *       *       *       *   Mr. WILLIAM HINCHLIFFE,  was the son of a reputable tradesman of St. Olave's in Southwark, and was born there May 12, 1692; was educated at a private grammar school with his intimate and ingenious friend Mr. Henry Needler. He made a considerable progress in classical learning, and had a poetical genius. He served an apprenticeship to Mr. Arthur Bettesworth, Bookseller in London, and afterwards followed that business himself near thirty years, under the Royal Exchange, with reputation and credit, having the esteem and friendship of many eminent merchants and gentlemen. In 1718 he married Jane, one of the daughters of Mr. William Leigh, an eminent citizen. Mrs. Hinchliffe was sister of William Leigh, esq; one of his Majesty's justices of the peace for the county of Surry, and of the revd. Thomas Leigh, late rector of Heyford in Oxfordshire, by whom he had two sons and three daughters, of which only one son and one daughter are now living. He died September 20, 1742, and was buried in the parish church of St. Margaret's Lothbury, London.  In 1714 he had the honour to present an Ode to King George I. on his Arrival at Greenwich, which is printed in a Collection of Poems, Amorous, Moral, and Divine, which he published in octavo, 1718, and dedicated them to his friend Mr. Needler.  He published a History of the Rebellion of 1715, and dedicated it to the late Duke of Argyle.  He made himself master of the French tongue by his own application and study; and in 1734 published a Translation of Boulainvillers's Life of Mahomet, which is well esteemed, and dedicated it to his intimate and worthy friend Mr. William Duncombe, Esq;  He was concerned, with others, in the publishing several other ingenious performances, and has left behind him in manuscript, a Translation of the nine first Books of Telemachus in blank Verse, which cost him great labour, but he did not live to finish the remainder.  He is the author of a volume of poems in 8vo, many of which are written with a true poetical spirit.   The INVITATION[1].  1.  O come Lavinia, lovely maid,   Said Dion, stretch'd at ease, Beneath the walnut's fragrant shade, A sweet retreat! by nature made   With elegance to please.  2.  O leave the court's deceitful glare,   Loath'd pageantry and pride, Come taste our solid pleasures here. Which angels need not blush to share,   And with bless'd men divide.  3.  What raptures were it in these bow'rs,   Fair virgin, chaste, and wise, With thee to lose the learned hours, And note the beauties in these flowers,   Conceal'd from vulgar eyes.  4.  For thee my gaudy garden blooms,   And richly colour'd glows; Above the pomp of royal rooms, Or purpled works of Persian looms,   Proud palaces disclose.  5.  Haste, nymph, nor let me sigh in vain,   Each grace attends on thee; Exalt my bliss, and point my strain, For love and truth are of thy train,   Content and harmony.  [1] This piece is not in Mr. Hinchliffe's works, but is assuredly his.          *       *       *       *       *   MR. MATTHEW CONCANEN.  This gentleman was a native of Ireland, and was bred to the Law. In this profession he seems not to have made any great figure. By some means or other he conceived an aversion to Dr. Swift, for his abuse of whom, the world taxed him with ingratitude. Concanen had once enjoyed some degree of Swift's favour, who was not always very happy in the choice of his companions. He had an opportunity of reading some of the Dr's poems in MS. which it is said he thought fit to appropriate and publish as his own.  As affairs did not much prosper with him in Ireland, he came over to London, in company with another gentleman, and both commenced writers. These two friends entered into an extraordinary agreement. As the subjects which then attracted the attention of mankind were of a political cast, they were of opinion that no species of writing could so soon recommend them to public notice; and in order to make their trade more profitable, they resolved to espouse different interests; one should oppose, and the other defend the ministry. They determined the side of the question each was to espouse, by tossing up a half-penny, and it fell to the share of Mr. Concanen to defend the ministry, which task he performed with as much ability, as political writers generally discover.  He was for some time, concerned in the British, and London Journals, and a paper called The Speculatist. These periodical pieces are long since buried in neglect, and perhaps would have even sunk into oblivion, had not Mr. Pope, by his satyrical writings, given them a kind of disgraceful immortality. In these Journals he published many scurrilities against Mr. Pope; and in a pamphlet called, The Supplement to the Profound, he used him with great virulence, and little candour. He not only imputed to him Mr. Brome's verses (for which he might indeed seem in some degree accountable, having corrected what that gentleman did) but those of the duke of Buckingham and others. To this rare piece some body humorously perswaded him to take for his motto, De profundis clamavi. He afterwards wrote a paper called The Daily Courant, wherein he shewed much spleen against lord Bolingbroke, and some of his friends. All these provocations excited Mr. Pope to give him a place in his Dunciad. In his second book, l. 287, when he represents the dunces diving in the mud of the Thames for the prize, he speaks thus of Concanen;    True to the bottom see Concanen creep,   A cold, long winded, native of the deep!   If perseverance gain the diver's prize,   Not everlasting Blackmore this denies.  In the year 1725 Mr. Concanen published a volume of poems in 8vo. consisting chiefly of compositions of his own, and some few of other gentlemen; they are addressed to the lord Gage, whom he endeavours artfully to flatter, without offending his modesty. 'I shall begin this Address, says he, by declaring that the opinion I have of a great part of the following verses, is the highest indication of the esteem in which I hold the noble character I present them to. Several of them have authors, whose names do honour to whatever patronage they receive. As to my share of them, since it is too late, after what I have already delivered, to give my opinion of them, I'll say as much as can be said in their favour. I'll affirm that they have one mark of merit, which is your lordship's approbation; and that they are indebted to fortune for two other great advantages, a place in good company, and an honourable protection.'  The gentlemen, who assisted Concanen in this collection, were Dean Swift, Mr. Parnel, Dr. Delany, Mr. Brown, Mr. Ward, and Mr. Stirling. In this collection there is a poem by Mr. Concanen, called A Match at Football, in three Cantos; written, 'tis said, in imitation of The Rape of the Lock. This performance is far from being despicable; the verification is generally smooth; the design is not ill conceived, and the characters not unnatural. It perhaps would be read with more applause, if The Rape of the Lock did not occur to the mind, and, by forcing a comparison, destroy all the satisfaction in perusing it; as the disproportion is so very considerable. We shall quote a few lines from the beginning of the third canto, by which it will appear that Concanen was not a bad rhimer.    In days of yore a lovely country maid   Rang'd o'er these lands, and thro' these forests stray'd;   Modest her pleasures, matchless was her frame,   Peerless her face, and Sally was her name.   By no frail vows her young desires were bound,   No shepherd yet the way to please her found.   Thoughtless of love the beauteous nymph appear'd,   Nor hop'd its transports, nor its torments fear'd.   But careful fed her flocks, and grac'd the plain,   She lack'd no pleasure, and she felt no pain.   She view'd our motions when we toss'd the ball,   And smil'd to see us take, or ward, a fall;   'Till once our leader chanc'd the nymph to spy,   And drank in poison from her lovely eye.   Now pensive grown, he shunn'd the long-lov'd plains,   His darling pleasures, and his favour'd swains,   Sigh'd in her absence, sigh'd when she was near,   Now big with hope, and now dismay'd with fear;   At length with falt'ring tongue he press'd the dame,   For some returns to his unpity'd flame;   But she disdain'd his suit, despis'd his care,   His form unhandsome, and his bristled hair;   Forward she sprung, and with an eager pace   The god pursu'd, nor fainted in the race;   Swift as the frighted hind the virgin flies,   When the woods ecchoe to the hunters cries:   Swift as the fleetest hound her flight she trac'd,   When o'er the lawns the frighted hind is chac'd;   The winds which sported with her flowing vest   Display'd new charms, and heightened all the rest:   Those charms display'd, increas'd the gods desire,   What cool'd her bosom, set his breast on fire:   With equal speed, for diff'rent ends they move,   Fear lent the virgin wings, the shepherd love:   Panting at length, thus in her fright she pray'd,   Be quick ye pow'rs, and save a wretched maid.   [Protect] my honour, shelter me from shame,   [Beauty] and life with pleasure I disclaim.  [Transcriber's note: print unclear for words in square brackets, therefore words are assumed.]  Mr. Concanen was also concerned with the late Mr. Roome [Transcriber's note: print unclear, \"m\" assumed], and a certain eminent senator, in making The Jovial Crew, an old Comedy, into a Ballad Opera; which was performed about the year 1730; and the profits were given entirely to Mr. Concanen.
