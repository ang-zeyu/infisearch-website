Ah, no, not half! Thou art not here                                       5 Under the bronze beech-leaves, And thy lover’s soul like a lonely child Roams through an empty room.     LXXIV   If death be good, Why do the gods not die? If life be ill, Why do the gods still live?  If love be naught,                                                        5 Why do the gods still love? If love be all, What should men do but love?     LXXV   Tell me what this life means, O my prince and lover, With the autumn sunlight On thy bronze-gold head?  With thy clear voice sounding                                             5 Through the silver twilight,— What is the lost secret Of the tacit earth?     LXXVI   Ye have heard how Marsyas, In the folly of his pride, Boasted of a matchless skill,— When the great god’s back was turned;  How his fond imagining                                                    5 Fell to ashes cold and grey, When the flawless player came In serenity and light.  So it was with those I loved In the years ere I loved thee.                                           10 Many a saying sounds like truth, Until Truth itself is heard.  Many a beauty only lives Until Beauty passes by, And the mortal is forgot                                                 15 In the shadow of the god.     LXXVII   Hour by hour I sit, Watching the silent door. Shadows go by on the wall, And steps in the street.  Expectation and doubt                                                     5 Flutter my timorous heart. So many hurrying home— And thou still away.     LXXVIII   Once in the shining street, In the heart of a seaboard town, As I waited, behold, there came The woman I loved.  As when, in the early spring,                                             5 A daffodil blooms in the grass, Golden and gracious and glad, The solitude smiled.     LXXIX   How strange is love, O my lover! With what enchantment and power Does it not come upon mortals, Learned or heedless!  How far away and unreal,                                                  5 Faint as blue isles in a sunset Haze-golden, all else of life seems, Since I have known thee!     LXXX   How to say I love you: What, if I but live it, Were the use in that, love?   Small, indeed.  Only, every moment                                                        5 Of this waking lifetime Let me be your lover   And your friend!  Ah, but then, as sure as Blossom breaks from bud-sheath,                                          10 When along the hillside   Spring returns,  Golden speech should flower From the soul so cherished, And the mouth your kisses                                                15   Filled with fire.     LXXXI   Hark, love, to the tambourines Of the minstrels in the street, And one voice that throbs and soars Clear above the clashing time!  Some Egyptian royal love-lilt,                                            5 Some Sidonian refrain, Vows of Paphos or of Tyre, Mount against the silver sun.  Pleading, piercing, yet serene, Vagrant in a foreign town,                                               10 From what passion was it born, In what lost land over sea?     LXXXII   Over the roofs the honey-coloured moon, With purple shadows on the silver grass,  And the warm south-wind on the curving sea, While we two, lovers past all turmoil now,  Watch from the window the white sails come in,                            5 Bearing what unknown ventures safe to port!  So falls the hour of twilight and of love With wizardry to loose the hearts of men,  And there is nothing more in this great world Than thou and I, and the blue dome of dusk.                              10     LXXXIII   In the quiet garden world, Gold sunlight and shadow leaves Flicker on the wall.  And the wind, a moment since, With rose-petals strewed the path                                         5 And the open door.  Now the moon-white butterflies Float across the liquid air, Glad as in a dream;  And, across thy lover’s heart,                                           10 Visions of one scarlet mouth With its maddening smile.     LXXXIV   Soft was the wind in the beech-trees; Low was the surf on the shore; In the blue dusk one planet Like a great sea-pharos shone.  But nothing to me were the sea-sounds,                                    5 The wind and the yellow star, When over my breast the banner Of your golden hair was spread.     LXXXV   Have you heard the news of Sappho’s garden, And the Golden Rose of Mitylene, Which the bending brown-armed rowers lately Brought from over sea, from lonely Pontus?  In a meadow by the river Halys,                                           5 Where some wood-god hath the world in keeping, On a burning summer noon they found her, Lovely as a Dryad, and more tender.  Her these eyes have seen, and not another Shall behold, till time takes all things goodly,                         10 So surpassing fair and fond and wondrous,— Such a slave as, worth a great king’s ransom,  No man yet of all the sons of mortals But would lose his soul for and regret not; So hath Beauty compassed all her children                                15 With the cords of longing and desire.  Only Hermes, master of word music, Ever yet in glory of gold language Could ensphere the magical remembrance Of her melting, half sad, wayward beauty,                                20  Or devise the silver phrase to frame her, The inevitable name to call her, Half a sigh and half a kiss when whispered, Like pure air that feeds a forge’s hunger.  Not a painter in the Isles of Hellas                                     25 Could portray her, mix the golden tawny With bright stain of poppies, or ensanguine Like the life her darling mouth’s vermilion,  So that, in the ages long hereafter, When we shall be dust of perished summers,                               30 Any man could say who found that likeness, Smiling gently on it, “This was Gorgo!”     LXXXVI   Love is so strong a thing, The very gods must yield, When it is welded fast With the unflinching truth.  Love is so frail a thing,                                                 5 A word, a look, will kill. Oh lovers, have a care How ye do deal with love.     LXXXVII   Hadst thou, with all thy loveliness, been true, Had I, with all my tenderness, been strong, We had not made this ruin out of life, This desolation in a world of joy,   My poor Gorgo.                                                          5  Yet even the high gods at times do err; Be therefore thou not overcome with woe, But dedicate anew to greater love An equal heart, and be thy radiant self   Once more, Gorgo.                                                      10     LXXXVIII   As, on a morn, a traveller might emerge From the deep green seclusion of the hills, By a cool road through forest and through fern, Little frequented, winding, followed long With joyous expectation and day-dreams,                                   5 And on a sudden, turning a great rock Covered with frondage, dark with dripping water, Behold the seaboard full of surf and sound, With all the space and glory of the world Above the burnished silver of the sea,—                                 10  Even so it was upon that first spring day When time, that is a devious path for men, Led me all lonely to thy door at last; And all thy splendid beauty, gracious and glad, (Glad as bright colour, free as wind or air,                             15 And lovelier than racing seas of foam) Bore sense and soul and mind at once away To a pure region where the gods might dwell, Making of me, a vagrant child before, A servant of joy at Aphrodite’s will.                                    20     LXXXIX   Where shall I look for thee, Where find thee now, O my lost Atthis?  Storm bars the harbour, And snow keeps the pass                                                   5 In the blue mountains.  Bitter the wind whistles, Pale is the sun, And the days shorten.  Close to the hearthstone,                                                10 With long thoughts of thee, Thy lonely lover  Sits now, remembering All the spent hours And thy fair beauty.                                                     15  Ah, when the hyacinth Wakens with spring, And buds the laurel,  Doubt not, some morning When all earth revives,                                                  20 Hearing Pan’s flute-call  Over the river-beds, Over the hills, Sounding the summons,  I shall look up and behold                                               25 In the door, Smiling, expectant,  Loving as ever And glad as of old, My own lost Atthis!                                                      30     XC   A sad, sad face, and saddest eyes that ever   Beheld the sun, Whence came the grief that makes of all thy beauty   One sad sweet smile?  In this bright portrait, where the painter fixed them,                    5   I still behold The eyes that gladdened, and the lips that loved me,   And, gold on rose,  The cloud of hair that settles on one shoulder   Slipped from its vest.                                                 10 I almost hear thy Mitylenean love-song   In the spring night,  When the still air was odorous with blossoms,   And in the hour Thy first wild girl’s-love trembled into being,                          15   Glad, glad and fond.  Ah, where is all that wonder? What god’s malice   Undid that joy And set the seal of patient woe upon thee,   O my lost love?                                                        20     XCI   Why have the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12389"],["title","Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics (#6)"],["body","in derision Severed us, heart of my being? Where have they lured thee to wander,   O my lost lover?  While now I sojourn with sorrow,                                          5 Having remorse for my comrade, What town is blessed with thy beauty,   Gladdened and prospered?  Nay, who could love as I loved thee, With whom thy beauty was mingled                                         10 In those spring days when the swallows   Came with the south wind?  Then I became as that shepherd Loved by Selene on Latmus, Once when her own summer magic                                           15   Took hold upon her  With a sweet madness, and thenceforth Her mortal lover must wander Over the wide world for ever,   Like one enchanted.                                                    20     XCII   Like a red lily in the meadow grasses, Swayed by the wind and burning in the sunlight, I saw you, where the city chokes with traffic, Bearing among the passers-by your beauty, Unsullied, wild, and delicate as a flower.                                5 And then I knew, past doubt or peradventure, Our loved and mighty Eleusinian mother Had taken thought of me for her pure worship, And of her favour had assigned my comrade For the Great Mysteries,—knew I should find you                         10 When the dusk murmured with its new-made lovers, And we be no more foolish but wise children, And well content partake of joy together, As she ordains and human hearts desire.     XCIII   When in the spring the swallows all return, And the bleak bitter sea grows mild once more, With all its thunders softened to a sigh;  When to the meadows the young green comes back, And swelling buds put forth on every bough,                               5 With wild-wood odours on the delicate air;  Ah, then, in that so lovely earth wilt thou With all thy beauty love me all one way, And make me all thy lover as before?  Lo, where the white-maned horses of the surge,                           10 Plunging in thunderous onset to the shore, Trample and break and charge along the sand!     XCIV   Cold is the wind where Daphne sleeps, That was so tender and so warm With loving,—with a loveliness Than her own laurel lovelier.  Now pipes the bitter wind for her,                                        5 And the snow sifts about her door, While far below her frosty hill The racing billows plunge and boom.     XCV   Hark, where Poseidon’s White racing horses Trample with tumult The shelving seaboard!  Older than Saturn,                                                        5 Older than Rhea, That mournful music, Falling and surging  With the vast rhythm Ceaseless, eternal,                                                      10 Keeps the long tally Of all things mortal.  How many lovers Hath not its lulling Cradled to slumber With the ripe flowers,                                                   15  Ere for our pleasure This golden summer Walked through the corn-lands In gracious splendour!                                                   20  How many loved ones Will it not croon to, In the long spring-days Through coming ages,  When all our day-dreams                                                  25 Have been forgotten, And none remembers Even thy beauty!  They too shall slumber In quiet places,                                                         30 And mighty sea-sounds Call them unheeded.     XCVI   Hark, my lover, it is spring! On the wind a faint far call Wakes a pang within my heart, Unmistakable and keen.  At the harbour mouth a sail                                               5 Glimmers in the morning sun, And the ripples at her prow Whiten into crumbling foam,  As she forges outward bound For the teeming foreign ports.                                           10 Through the open window now, Hear the sailors lift a song!  In the meadow ground the frogs With their deafening flutes begin,— The old madness of the world                                             15 In their golden throats again.  Little fifers of live bronze, Who hath taught you with wise lore To unloose the strains of joy, When Orion seeks the west?                                               20  And you feathered flute-players, Who instructed you to fill All the blossomy orchards now With melodious desire?  I doubt not our father Pan                                               25 Hath a care of all these things. In some valley of the hills Far away and misty-blue,  By quick water he hath cut A new pipe, and set the wood                                             30 To his smiling lips, and blown, That earth’s rapture be restored.  And those wild Pandean stops Mark the cadence life must keep. O my lover, be thou glad;                                                35 It is spring in Hellas now.     XCVII   When the early soft spring wind comes blowing Over Rhodes and Samos and Miletus, From the seven mouths of Nile to Lesbos, Freighted with sea-odours and gold sunshine,  What news spreads among the island people                                 5 In the market-place of Mitylene, Lending that unwonted stir of gladness To the busy streets and thronging doorways?  Is it word from Ninus or Arbela, Babylon the great, or Northern Imbros?                                   10 Have the laden galleons been sighted Stoutly labouring up the sea from Tyre?  Nay, ’tis older news that foreign sailor With the cheek of sea-tan stops to prattle To the young fig-seller with her basket                                  15 And the breasts that bud beneath her tunic,  And I hear it in the rustling tree-tops. All this passionate bright tender body Quivers like a leaf the wind has shaken, Now love wanders through the aisles of springtime.                       20     XCVIII   I am more tremulous than shaken reeds, And love has made me like the river water.  Thy voice is as the hill-wind over me, And all my changing heart gives heed, my lover.  Before thy least lost murmur I must sigh,                                 5 Or gladden with thee as the sun-path glitters.     XCIX   Over the wheat-field, Over the hill-crest, Swoops and is gone The beat of a wild wing, Brushing the pine-tops,                                                   5 Bending the poppies, Hurrying Northward With golden summer.  What premonition, O purple swallow,                                                        10 Told thee the happy Hour of migration? Hark! On the threshold (Hush, flurried heart in me!), Was there a footfall?                                                    15 Did no one enter?  Soon will a shepherd In rugged Dacia, Folding his gentle Ewes in the twilight,                                                    20 Lifting a level Gaze from the sheepfold, Say to his fellows, “Lo, it is springtime.”  This very hour                                                           25 In Mitylene, Will not a young girl Say to her lover, Lifting her moon-white Arms to enlace him,                                                      30 Ere the glad sigh comes, “Lo, it is lovetime!”     C   Once more the rain on the mountain, Once more the wind in the valley, With the soft odours of springtime And the long breath of remembrance,   O Lityerses!                                                            5  Warm is the sun in the city. On the street corners with laughter Traffic the flower-girls. Beauty Blossoms once more for thy pleasure   In many places.                                                        10  Gentlier now falls the twilight, With the slim moon in the pear-trees; And the green frogs in the meadows Blow on shrill pipes to awaken   Thee, Lityerses.                                                       15  Gladlier now crimson morning Flushes fair-built Mitylene,— Portico, temple, and column,— Where the young garlanded women Praise thee with singing.                                                20  Ah, but what burden of sorrow Tinges their slow stately chorus, Though spring revisits the glad earth? Wilt thou not wake to their summons,   O Lityerses?                                                           25  Shall they then never behold thee,— Nevermore see thee returning Down the blue cleft of the mountains, Nor in the purple of evening   Welcome thy coming?                                                    30  Nevermore answer thy glowing Youth with their ardour, nor cherish With lovely longing thy spirit, Nor with soft laughter beguile thee,   O Lityerses?                                                           35  Heedless, assuaged, art thou sleeping Where the spring sun cannot find thee, Nor the wind waken, nor woodlands Bloom for thy innocent rapture Through golden hours?                                                    40  Hast thou no passion nor pity For thy deserted companions? Never again will thy beauty Quell their desire nor rekindle,   O Lityerses?                                                           45  Nay, but in vain their clear voices Call thee.
