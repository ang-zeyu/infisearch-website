Why must Germany be victorious, why must she have her place in the sun, why must her frontiers be extended, why is all opposition to Germany shameful, not to say devilish, why must Germany become a world-empire, why ought Germany and not Great Britain to become the great Colonial Power?  Why, because it is through the medium of Germanism that the world is to be healed; it is upon Germanism that the salvation of the world depends.  That is why all attacks against Germanism are against God's plans, in opposition to His designs for the world; in short, a sin against God.  The Germans do not seem to be able to understand that other nations cannot be particularly delighted at being described as sickly shoots which can only be healed by coming under the influence of German fountains of health.  Yet one would think that, if they would only reflect a little upon what the two lines quoted above imply, they would be able in some measure to understand the dislike for them, which they declare to be so incomprehensible.  \"He also prophesied about the great master who would arise and create the unity of Germany.  This prophecy was brilliantly fulfilled in Bismarck.  After 1866 he loudly clamours for Alsace-Lorraine.  This he cannot reasonably have expected to obtain without war; but when the war comes we hear exactly the same tale as now of the Germans' love of peace and the despicable deceitfulness of their enemies.  'And the peace shall be a _German peace_; now tremble before the sword of God and of Germany ye who are strong in impiety and fruitful in bloodguiltiness.'\"  Hate lectures have been both fashionable and popular in Germany during the war.  I was attracted to one in Munich by flaming red and yellow posters which announced that Professor Werner Sombart of the University of Berlin would speak at the Vierjahreszeiten Hall on \"Unser Hass gegen England\" (Our Hatred of England).  I sat among the elite of the Bavarian capital in a large hall with even the standing room filled, when a black-bearded professor stepped upon the stage amid a flutter of handclapping and proceeded to his task without any introduction.  He was a Professor of Hatred, and it soon became quite clear that he was full of his subject.  His lank frame leaned over the footlights and he wound and unwound his long, thin fingers, while his lips sneered and his sharp black eyes gleamed venom as he instructed business men, bankers, smart young officers, lorgnetted dowagers and sweet-faced girls, in the duty of hating with the whole heart and the whole mind.  I soon felt that if Lissauer is the Horace of Hate, Sombart is its Demosthenes.  \"It is not our duty (_duty_ is always a good catchword in German appeal) to hate individual Englishmen, such as Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George.  No, we must go far beyond that. We must hate the very essence of everything English.  We must hate the very soul of England.  An abysmal gulf yawns between the two nations which can never, and must never, be bridged over.  We need borrow _Kultur_ from no nation on earth, for we ourselves have developed the highest Kultur in the world.\"  The professor continued in this strain for an hour and a half, and concluded with the rather striking statements that _hatred is the greatest force in the world to overcome tremendous obstacles_, and that _either one must hate or one must fear_.  The moral is, of course, obvious.  Nobody wishes to be a coward, therefore the only alternative is to hate.  Therefore, hate England!  I watched the audience during the lecture and did not fail to note the close attention shown the professor and the constant nods and sighs of assent of those about me.  I was not, however, prepared for the wild tumult of applause at the finish.  Indeed the admiring throng rushed to the stage to shower him with admiration.  \"Das war aber zu schon!\" sighed a dowager near me.  \"Ja, ja, wunderbar.  Ein Berliner Professor!\"  And the student with _Schmissen_ (sabre cuts) across his close-cropped head smacked his lips with, satisfaction over the words much as he might have done over his Stein at the Furstenhof.  I investigated Professor Sombart and learned from authority which is beyond question that he was an out and out Government agent foisted on to the University of Berlin against the wishes of its faculty.  The name of Professor Joseph Kohler is known, all over the world to men who have the slightest acquaintance with German jurisprudence. His literary output has been enormous and he has unquestionably made many valuable contributions to legal science.  Even he, however, cannot do the impossible, and his \"_Not kennt kein Gebot_\" (Necessity knows no law), an attempt in the summer of 1915 to justify the German invasion of Belgium, makes Germany's case on this particular point appear worse than ever.  The Empire of Rome and the Empire of Napoleon worked upon the principle that necessity knows no law.  Why should not the Empire of William II.?  That is the introductory theme.  The reader then wades through page after page of classical philosophy, biblical philosophy, and modern German philosophy which support the theory that a sin may not always be a sin.  One may steal, for example, if by so doing a life he saved.  It naturally follows from this that when a nation is confronted by a problem which involves its very existence it may do anything which may work to its advantage.  Thus Germany did right in attacking the little country she had solemnly sworn to defend, and history will later prove that the real barbarians of the war are the Americans, since they are so abjectly ignorant as to call the Germans barbarians for acting as they did. So argues Joseph Kohler, who certainly ranks among the first half-dozen professors of Germany.  There are a few professors of international law in Germany, however, who have preserved a legally-balanced attitude despite their sympathies.   One of these wrote an article for a law periodical, many of the statements of which were in direct contradiction to statements in the German Press.  The German people, for example, were being instructed--a not difficult task--that Britain was violating international law when her vessels hoisted a neutral flag during pursuit.  This professor simply quoted paragraph 81 of the German Prize Code which showed that orders to German ships were precisely the same.  Were this known to the German population one of the ten thousand hate tricks would be out of commission.  Therefore, this and similar articles must be suppressed, not because they are not true, but because they would interfere with the delusion of hate which saturates the mind of the new Germany.  I have seen articles returned to this distinguished writer with the censor stamp: _Not to be published till after the war_.  When a winning Germany began to grow angry at American munition deliveries I heard much talk of the indemnity which the United States would be compelled to pay after Europe had been duly disposed of.  Professor Hermann Oncken, of the University of Heidelberg, made this his theme in a widely read booklet, entitled, \"_Deutschlands Weltkrieg und die Deutsch-Amerikaner_.\"  Professor P.  von Gast, of the Technical College of Aachen, does not appear to realise that his country has a sufficient job on her hands in Europe and Africa, but thinks the midst of a great war a suitable time to arouse his countrymen against the United States in Latin America.  He explains that the Monroe Doctrine was simply an attempt on the part of the great Anglo-Saxon Republic to gobble up the whole continent to the south for herself.  \"All the world must oppose America in this attempt,\" he feels.  Then there is Professor Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who writes on reprisals in the _Juristenblatt_ of July, 1916.  It should be borne in mind that he is a professor of law and that he is writing in a book which is read by legal minds and not by the general public; all the more reason that we should expect something that would contain common sense.  Professor Bartholdy, after expressing his profound horror over the French raid on Karlsruhe, hastens to explain that such methods can be of not the slightest military advantage to the French, but will only arouse Germany to fight all the harder.  He deplores enemy attacks on unfortified districts, and claims that the French military powers confess that such acts are not glorious by their failure to pin decorations on the breasts of the aviators who perpetrate them, in the same way as the German Staff honours heroes like Boelke and Immelmann, who fight, as do all German aviators, like men.  There have been many incidents outside of Germany of which the professor apparently has never heard, or else his sense of humour is below the zero mark.  My talks with German professors impressed me with how little most of them keep in touch with the war situation from day to day and from month to month.  A Berlin professor of repute with whom I sipped coffee one day in the Cafe Bauer expressed the greatest surprise when he heard that a neutral could actually get from America to Germany.  I heard this opinion very often among the common people, but had supposed that doctors of philosophy were somewhat better informed.  During my conversation with another professor, whose war remarks have been circulated in the neutral countries by the Official News Service, he remarked that he read the London Times and other English newspapers regularly.  \"Oh, so you get the English papers?\" I asked, fully aware that one may do so in Germany.  \"Not exactly,\" returned the professor.  \"The Government has a very nice arrangement by which condensed articles from the English newspapers are prepared and sent to us professors.\"  This was the final straw.  I had always considered professors to be men who did research work, and I supposed that professors on political science and history consulted original sources when possible. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12418"],["title","The Land of Deepening Shadow: Germany-at-War (#7)"],["body"," Yet the German professor of the twentieth century, is content to take what the Government gives him and only what the Government gives to him.  Thus we find that the professor is a great power in Germany in the control of the minds of the people, and that the Government controls the mind of the professor.  He is simply one of the instruments in the German Government's Intellectual Blockade of the German people.     CHAPTER VI  THE LIE ON THE FILM  At the end of an absorbingly interesting reel showing the Kaiser reviewing his troops, a huge green trade-mark globe revolved with a streamer fluttering _Berlin_.  The lights were turned on and the operator looked over his assortment of reels.  An American had been granted permission to take war films in Germany in the autumn of 1914, to be exhibited in the United States.  After he had arrived, however, the authorities had refused to let him take pictures with the army, but, like the proverbial druggist, had offered him something \"just as good.\"  In London, on his return journey home, he showed to a few newspaper correspondents the films which Germany had foisted upon him.  \"The next film, gentlemen, will depict scenes in East Prussia,\" the operator announced.  Although I had probably seen most of these pictures in Germany, my interest quickened, for I had been through that devastated province during and after the first invasion.  Familiar scenes of ruined villages and refugees scudding from the sulphur storm passed before my eyes.  Then came the ruined heap of a once stately church tagged _Beautiful Church in Allenburg Destroyed by the Russians_.  The destruction seemed the more heinous since a trace of former beauty lived through the ruins, and you could not view this link of evidence against the Russians without a feeling of resentment. This out-of-the-way church was not architecturally important to the world as is Rheims Cathedral, to be sure, but the destruction seemed just as wanton.  The next picture flashed on the screen showed a Russian church intact, with the simple title, _Russian Church at Potetschiki_. The moral of the sequence was clear.  The German Government, up to the minute in all things, knows the vivid educative force of the kinema, and realises the effect of such a sequence of pictures upon her people at home and neutrals throughout the world, It enables them to see for themselves the difference between the barbarous Russians and the generous Germans.  The reel buzzed on, but I did not see the succeeding pictures, for my thoughts were of far-off East Prussia, of Allenburg, and of the true story of the ruined church by the Alle River.   Tannenberg had been fought, Samsanow had been decisively smashed in the swamps and plashy streams, and Hindenburg turned north-east to cut off Rennenkampf's army, which had advanced to the gates of Konigsberg.  The outside world had been horrified by stories of German crime in Belgium; whereupon Germany counter attacked with reports of terrible atrocities perpetrated by the Russians, of boys whose right hands had been cut off so that they could never serve in the army, of wanton murder, rapine and burnings.  I read these stories in the Berlin papers, and they filled me with a deep feeling against Russia.  One of the most momentous battles of history was being fought in the West, and the Kaiser's armies were in full retreat from the Marne to the Aisne, but Berlin knew nothing of this.  Refugees from East Prussia with white arm-bands filled the streets, Hindenburg and victory were on every tongue, Paris was forgotten, and all interest centred in the Eastern theatre of war.  That was in the good old days when the war was young, when armies were taking up positions, when the management of newspaper reporters was not developed to a fine art, when Europe was topsy-turvy, when it was quite the thing for war correspondents to outwit the authorities and see all they could.  I resolved to make an attempt to get into East Prussia, and as it was useless to wait for official permission--that is, if I was to see things while fresh--I determined to play the game and trust to luck.  Danzig seemed the end of my effort, for the railroad running east was choked with military trains, the transportation of troops and supplies in one direction and prisoners and wounded in the other. By good fortune, however, I booked passage on a boat for Konigsberg.  The little steamer nosed its way through a long lock canal amid scenery decidedly Dutch, with old grey windmills dotting broad fiat stretches, black and white cows looming large and distinct on the landscape, and fish nets along the waters edge.  To the right the shore grew bolder after we entered the _Frishes Haff_, a broad lagoon separated from the Baltic by a narrow strip of pasture land. Red sails glowed in the clear sunshine, adding an Adriatic touch. Cumbersome junk-like boats flying the Red Cross passed west under full sail.  Germany was using every man at her disposal to transport wounded and prisoners from the battle region which we were drawing near.  A smoky haze ahead indicated Konigsberg.  The mouth of the Pregel bustled with activity, new fortifications were being everywhere thrown up, while indistinct field-grey figures swarmed over the plain like ants.  We glided through forests of masts and rigging and slid up to a pier opposite great sagging warehouses behind which the sun was setting.  As I picked up my bag to go ashore, a heavy hand fell on my shoulder and I was asked to wait until we were boarded from the police boat which was puffing alongside.  My detainer, a government inspector, a man of massive frame with deep set eyes and a shaggy black beard, refused to say more than that the police wished to see me.  They had been signalled and were coming to the boat expressly for that purpose.  American ammunition had not begun to play its part in German public opinion at that time, and, moreover, America was being hailed everywhere in Germany as a possible ally against Japan.  Therefore, although only a few days previously Russian guns had been booming less than a dozen miles away, and Konigsburg was now the base against Rennenkampf, my presence was tolerated, and I finally managed to get lodgings for the night after I had found two hotels turned into hospitals,  I spent the following day trying to obtain permission to pass the cordon of sentries outside the city, but I received only the advice to go back to Berlin and apply at the _Auswartiges Amt_ (Foreign Office).  I did not wish to wait in Berlin until this campaign was over; I wished to follow on the heels of the army through the ruined land and catch up to the fighting if possible.  American correspondents had done this in Belgium.  I myself had done it with the Austrians against the Serbs, and I succeeded in East Prussia, but not through Berlin.  I was well aware that Germany was making a tremendous bid for neutral favour.  I had furthermore heard so much of Russian atrocities that I was convinced that the stories were true; consequently I decided to play the role of an investigator of Muscovite crime.  I won Herr Meyer of the Wolff Telegraph Bureau, who sent me along with his card to Commandant von Rauch, who at first refused to let me proceed, but after I had hovered outside his door for three days, finally gave me a pass to go to Tapiau, the high-water mark of the Russian invasion.  That night, \"by chance,\" in the _Deutscher Hof_, I met the black-bearded official who had arrested me on the boat, and I told him that I had permission to go to Tapiau next morning.  When he became convinced, that I was a professional atrocity hunter who believed that the Russians had been brutal, his hospitality became boundless, and over copious steins of Munich beer he described the invaders in a manner which made Gladstone's expose of the Turks in Bulgaria, the stories of Captain Kidd, and the tales of the Spanish Inquisition seem like essays on brotherly love.  He was particularly incensed at the Russians because they had destroyed Allenburg, for Allenburg was his home.  One of the stories on which he laid great stress was that a band of Cossacks had pillaged the church just outside of Allenburg on the road to Friedland, after they had driven sixty innocent maidens into it and outraged them there.  A train of the _Militar-Personenzug_ variety bore me next morning through a country of barbed wire, gun emplacements and fields seamed with trenches to Tapiau, a town withered in the blast of war.  Two ruined bridges in the Pregel bore silent testimony to the straits of the retreating Germans, for the remaining ends on the further shore were barricaded with scraps of iron and wood gathered from the wreckage.  Landsturm guards examined my pass, which was good only for Tapiau and return.  I decided to miss the train back, however, and push on in the wake of the army to Wehlau.  Outside of Tapiau I was challenged by a sentry, who, to my amazement, did not examine my now worthless pass when I pulled it from my pocket, but motioned me on.  The road ran through eye-tiring stretches of meadows pockmarked with great shell holes full of black water.  I came upon the remains of an old brick farmhouse battered to dust in woods which were torn to splinters by shell, bullet and shrapnel.  The Russians had bombarded Tapiau from here, and had in turn been shelled in the trenches which they had dug and chopped in the labyrinth of roots. Among the debris of tins, cases, knapsacks and cartridge clips were fragments of uniforms which had been blown off Russian bodies by German shells, while on a branch above my head a shrivelled human arm dangled in the light breeze of September.  I left the sickening atmosphere of the woods behind and pushed on to Wehlau, a primitive little town situated on the meadows where the Alle flows into the Pregel.  Here my troubles began.  Soldiers stared at me as I walked through crooked, narrow streets unevenly paved with"]]]
