It was a dull time of day for O'Brien, so he sat with his feet on the edge of the bar and sipped a tall glass of beer; he looked up at the welcome click of the doors, however, and then was instantly on his feet. The good red went out of his face and the freckles over his nose stood out like ink marks.  \"There's a black hoss outside,\" said Jerry, \"that I'm going to buy. Where's the owner?\"  \"Have a drink,\" said the bartender, and he forced an amiable smile.  \"I got business on my hands, not drinking,\" said Jerry Strann.  \"Lost your chestnut?\" queried O'Brien in concern.  \"The chestnut was all right until I seen the black. And now he ain't a hoss at all. Where's the gent I want?\"  The bartender had fenced for time as long as possible.  \"Over there,\" he said, and pointed.  It was a slender fellow sitting at a table in a corner of the long room, his sombrero pushed back on his head. He was playing solitaire and his back was towards Jerry Strann, who now made a brief survey, hitched his cartridge belt, and approached the stranger with a grin. The man did not turn; he continued to lay down his cards with monotonous regularity, and while he was doing it he said in the gentlest voice that had ever reached the ear of Jerry Strann: \"Better stay where you are, stranger. My dog don't like you.\"  And Jerry Strann perceived, under the shadow of the table, a blacker shadow, huge and formless in the gloom, and two spots of incandescent green twinkling towards him. He stopped; he even made a step back; and then he heard a stifled chuckle from the bartender.  If it had not been for that untimely mirth of O'Brien's probably nothing of what followed would have passed into the history of the Three B's.     CHAPTER VIII  THE GIFT-HORSE   \"Your dog is your own dog,\" remarked Jerry Strann, still to the back of the card-laying stranger, \"but this ain't your back-yard. Keep your eye on him, or I'll fix him so he won't need watching!\"  So saying he made another step forward, and it brought a snarl from the dog; not one of those high-whining noises, but a deep guttural that sounded like indrawn breath. The gun of Jerry Strann leaped into his hand.  \"Bart,\" said the gentle-voiced stranger, \"lie down and don't talk.\" And he turned in his chair, pulled his hat straight, and looked mildly upon the gunman. An artist would have made much of that picture, for there was in this man, as in Strann, a singular portion of beauty. It was not, however, free from objection, for he had not the open manliness of the larger of the two. Indeed, a feminine grace and softness marked him; his wrists were as round as a girl's, and his hands as slender and as delicately finished. Whether it be the white-hot sun of summer or the hurricane snows of winter, the climate of the mountain-desert roughens the skin, and it cuts away spare flesh, hewing out the face in angles; but with this man there were no rough edges, but all was smoothed over and rounded with painful care; as if nature had concentrated in that birth to show what she could do. Such fine workmanship, perhaps, would be appreciated more by women than by men; for men like a certain weight and bulk of bone and muscle--whereas this fellow seemed as light of body as he was of hand. He sat now watching Strann with the utmost gravity. He had very large brown eyes of a puzzling quality; perhaps that was because there seemed to be no thought behind them and one caught the mystery and the wistfulness of some animals from a glance at him.  The effect of that glance on Strann was to make him grin again, and he at once banished the frown from his forehead and put away his gun; the big dog had slunk deeper into the shadow and closer to his master.  \"I'm Strann. Maybe you've heard of me.\"  \"My name is Barry,\" said the other. \"I'm sorry that I haven't heard of you before.\"  And the sound of his voice made Jerry Strann grin again; it was such a low, soft voice with the velvet of a young girl's tone in it; moreover, the brown eyes seemed to apologise for the ignorance concerning Strann's name.  \"You got a hoss out in front.\"  A nod of agreement.  \"What's your price?\"  \"None.\"  \"No price? Look here,\" argued Strann, \"everything's got a price, and I got to have that hoss, understand? _Got_ to! I ain't bargaining. I won't try to beat you down. You just set a figger and I'll cover it. I guess that's square!\"  \"He ain't a gentle hoss,\" said Barry. \"Maybe you wouldn't like him.\"  \"Oh, that's all right about being gentle,\" chuckled Strann. Then he checked his mirth and stared piercingly at the other to make out if there were a secret mockery. It could not, however, be possible. The eyes were as gravely apologetic as ever. He continued: \"I seen the hell-fire in him. That's what stopped me like a bullet. I like 'em that way. Much rather have 'em with a fight. Well, let's have your price. Hey, O'Brien, trot out your red-eye; I'm going to do some business here!\"  O'Brien came hastily, with drinks, and while they waited Strann queried politely: \"Belong around these parts?\"  \"No,\" answered the other softly.  \"No? Where you come from?\"  \"Over there,\" said Barry, and waved a graceful hand towards half the points of the compass.  \"H-m-m!\" muttered Strann, and once more he bent a keen gaze upon his companion. The drinks were now placed before them. \"Here,\" he concluded, \"is to the black devil outside!\" And he swallowed the liquor at a gulp, but as he replaced the empty glass on the table he observed, with breathless amazement, that the whiskey glass of the stranger was still full; he had drunk his chaser!  \"Now, by God!\" said Strann in a ringing voice, and struck a heavy hand upon the top of the table. He regained his control, however, instantly. \"Now about that price!\"  \"I don't know what horses are worth,\" replied Barry.  \"To start, then--five hundred bucks in cold cash--gold!--for your--what's his name?\"  \"Satan.\"  \"Eh?\"  \"Satan.\"  \"H-m-m!\" murmured Strann again. \"Five hundred for Satan, then. How about it?\"  \"If you can ride him,\" began the stranger.  \"Oh, hell,\" smiled Strann with a large and careless gesture, \"I'll _ride_ him, all right.\"  \"Then I would let you take him for nothing,\" concluded Barry.  \"You'd--what?\" said Strann. Then he rose slowly from his chair and shouted; instantly the swinging doors broke open and a throng of faces appeared at the gap. \"Boys, this gent here is going to give me the black--ha, ha, ha!--if I can ride him!\" He turned back on Barry. \"They've heard it,\" he concluded, \"and this bargain is going to stick just this way. If your hoss can throw me the deal's off. Eh?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" nodded the brown-eyed man.  \"What's the idea?\" asked one of Jerry's followers as the latter stepped through the doors of the saloon onto the street.  \"I dunno,\" said Jerry. \"That gent looks kind of simple; but it ain't my fault if he made a rotten bargain. Here, you!\"  And he seized the bridle-reins of the black stallion. Speed, lightning speed, was what saved him, for the instant his fingers touched the leather Satan twisted his head and snapped like an angry dog. The teeth clicked beside Strann's shoulder as he leaped back. He laughed savagely.  \"That'll be took out of him,\" he announced, \"and damned quick!\"  Here the voice of Barry was heard, saying: \"I'll help you mount, Mr. Strann.\" And he edged his way through the little crowd until he stood at the head of the stallion.  \"Look out!\" warned Strann in real alarm, \"or he'll take your head off!\"  But Barry was already beside his horse, and, with his back towards those vicious teeth, he drew the reins over its head. As for the stallion, it pricked one ear forward and then the other, and muzzled the man's shoulder confidingly. There was a liberal chorus of astonished oaths from the gathering.  \"I'll hold his head while you get on,\" suggested Barry, turning his mild eyes upon Strann again.  \"Well,\" muttered the big man, \"may I be eternally damned!\" He added: \"All right. Hold his head, and I'll ride him without pulling leather. Is that square?\"  Barry nodded absently. His slender fingers were patting the velvet nose of the stallion and he was talking to it in an affectionate undertone--meaningless words, perhaps, such as a mother uses to soothe a child. When Strann set his foot in the stirrup and gathered up the reins the black horse cringed and shuddered; it was not a pleasant thing to see; it was like a dog crouching under the suspended whip. It was worse than that; it was almost the horror of a man who shivers at the touch of an unclean animal. There was not a sound from the crowd; and every grin was wiped out. Jerry Strann swung into the saddle lightly.  There he sat, testing the stirrups. They were too short by inches but he refused to have them lengthened. He poised his quirt and tugged his hat lower over his eyes.  \"Turn him loose!\" he shouted. \"Hei!\"  And his shrill yell went down the street and the echoes sent it barking back from wall to wall; Barry stepped back from the head of the black. But for an instant the horse did not stir. He was trembling violently, but his blazing eyes were fixed upon the face of his owner. Barry raised his hand.  And then it happened. It was like the release of a coiled watch-spring; the black whirled as a top spins and Strann sagged far to the left; before he could recover the stallion was away in a flash, like a racer leaving the barrier and reaching full speed in almost a stride. Not far--hardly the breadth of the street--before he pitched up in a long leap as if to clear a barrier, landed stiff-legged with a sickening jar, whirled again like a spinning top, and darted straight back. And Jerry Strann pulled leather--with might and main--but the short stirrups were against him, and above all the suddenness of the start had taken him off guard for all his readiness. When the stallion dropped stiff-legged Jerry was thrown forward"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12449"],["title","A Reputed Changeling; Or, Three Seventh Years Two Centuries Ago (#0)"],["body","by David Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk     A REPUTED CHANGELING, or, THREE SEVENTH YEARS TWO CENTURIES AGO     PREFACE   I do not think I have here forced the hand of history except by giving Portchester to two imaginary Rectors, and by a little injustice to her whom Princess Anne termed 'the brick-bat woman.'  The trial is not according to present rules, but precedents for its irregularities are to be found in the doings of the seventeenth century, notably in the trial of Spencer Cowper by the same Judge Hatsel, and I have done my best to represent the habits of those country gentry who were not infected by the evils of the later Stewart reigns.  There is some doubt as to the proper spelling of Portchester, but, judging by analogy, the t ought not to be omitted.  C. M. YONGE. 2d May 1889.    CHAPTER I: THE EXPERIENCES OF GOODY MADGE   \"Dear Madam, think me not to blame; Invisible the fairy came. Your precious babe is hence conveyed, And in its place a changeling laid. Where are the father's mouth and nose, The mother's eyes as black as sloes? See here, a shocking awkward creature, That speaks a fool in every feature.\"  GAY.  \"He is an ugly ill-favoured boy--just like Riquet a la Houppe.\"  \"That he is!  Do you not know that he is a changeling?\"  Such were the words of two little girls walking home from a school for young ladies kept, at the Cathedral city of Winchester, by two Frenchwomen of quality, refugees from the persecutions preluding the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and who enlivened the studies of their pupils with the Contes de Commere L'Oie.  The first speaker was Anne Jacobina Woodford, who had recently come with her mother, the widow of a brave naval officer, to live with her uncle, the Prebendary then in residence.  The other was Lucy Archfield, daughter to a knight, whose home was a few miles from Portchester, Dr. Woodford's parish on the southern coast of Hampshire.  In the seventeenth century, when roads were mere ditches often impassable, and country-houses frequently became entirely isolated in the winter, it was usual with the wealthier county families to move into their local capital, where some owned mansions and others hired prebendal houses, or went into lodgings in the roomy dwellings of the superior tradesmen.  For the elders this was the season of social intercourse, for the young people, of education.  The two girls, who were about eight years old, had struck up a rapid friendship, and were walking hand in hand to the Close attended by the nurse in charge of Mistress Lucy.  This little lady wore a black silk hood and cape, trimmed with light brown fur, and lined with pink, while Anne Woodford, being still in mourning for her father, was wrapped in a black cloak, unrelieved except by the white border of her round cap, fringed by fair curls, contrasting with her brown eyes.  She was taller and had a more upright bearing of head and neck, with more promise of beauty than her companion, who was much more countrified and would not have been taken for the child of higher station.  They had traversed the graveyard of the Cathedral, and were passing through a narrow archway known as the Slype, between the south- western angle of the Cathedral and a heavy mass of old masonry forming part of the garden wall of the present abode of the Archfield family, when suddenly both children stumbled and fell, while an elfish peal of laughter sounded behind them.  Lucy came down uppermost, and was scarcely hurt, but Anne had fallen prone, striking her chin on the ground, so as to make her bite her lip, and bruising knees and elbows severely.  Nurse detected the cause of the fall so as to avoid it herself.  It was a cord fastened across the archway, close to the ground, and another shout of derision greeted the discovery; while Lucy, regaining her feet, beheld for a moment a weird exulting grimace on a visage peeping over a neighbouring headstone.  \"It is he! it is he!  The wicked imp!  There's no peace for him!  I say,\" she screamed, \"see if you don't get a sound flogging!\" and she clenched her little fist as the provoking \"Ho! ho! ho!\" rang farther and farther off.  \"Don't cry, Anne dear; the Dean and Chapter shall take order with him, and he shall be soundly beaten.  Are you hurt? O nurse, her mouth is all blood.\"  \"I hope she has not broken a tooth,\" said nurse, who had been attending to the sobbing child.  \"Come in, my lamb, we will wash your face, and make you well.\"  Anne, blinded with tears, jarred, bruised, bleeding, and bewildered, submitted to be led by kind nurse the more willingly because she knew that her mother, together with all the quality, were at Sir Thomas Charnock's.  They had dined at the fashionable hour of two, and were to stay till supper-time, the elders playing at Ombre, the juniors dancing.  As a rule the ordinary clergy did not associate with the county families, but Dr. Woodford was of good birth and a royal chaplain, and his deceased brother had been a favourite officer of the Duke of York, and had been so severely wounded by his side in the battle of Southwold as to be permanently disabled. Indeed Anne Jacobina was godchild to the Duke and his first Duchess, whose favoured attendant her mother had been.  Thus Mrs. Woodford was in great request, and though she had not hitherto gone into company since her widowhood, she had yielded to Lady Charnock's entreaty that she would come and show her how to deal with that strange new Chinese infusion, a costly packet of which had been brought to her from town by Sir Thomas, as the Queen's favourite beverage, wherewith the ladies of the place were to be regaled and astonished.  It had been already arranged that the two little girls should spend the evening together, and as they entered the garden before the house a rude voice exclaimed, \"Holloa!  London Nan whimpering.  Has my fine lady met a spider or a cow?\" and a big rough lad of twelve, in a college gown, spread out his arms, and danced up and down in the doorway to bar the entrance.  \"Don't, Sedley,\" said a sturdy but more gentlemanlike lad of the same age, thrusting him aside.  \"Is she hurt?  What is it?\"  \"That spiteful imp, Peregrine Oakshott,\" said Lucy passionately. \"He had a cord across the Slype to trip us up.  I heard him laughing like a hobgoblin, and saw him too, grinning over a tombstone like the malicious elf he is.\"  The college boy uttered a horse laugh, which made Lucy cry, \"Cousin Sedley, you are as bad!\" but the other boy was saying, \"Don't cry, Anne None-so-pretty.  I'll give it him well!  Though I'm younger, I'm bigger, and I'll show him reason for not meddling with my little sweetheart.\"  \"Have with you then!\" shouted Sedley, ready for a fray on whatever pretext, and off they rushed, as nurse led little Anne up the broad shallow steps of the dark oak staircase, but Lucy stood laughing with exultation in the intended vengeance, as her brother took down her father's hunting-whip.  \"He must be wellnigh a fiend to play such wicked pranks under the very Minster!\" she said.  \"And a rascal of a Whig, and that's worse,\" added Charles; \"but I'll have it out of him!\"  \"Take care, Charley; if you offend him, and he does really belong to those--those creatures\"--Lucy lowered her voice--\"who knows what they might do to you?\"  Charles laughed long and loud.  \"I'll take care of that,\" he said, swinging out at the door.  \"Elf or no elf, he shall learn what it is to play off his tricks on _my_ sister and my little sweetheart.\"  Lucy betook herself to the nursery, where Anne was being comforted, her bleeding lip washed with essence, and repaired with a pinch of beaver from a hat, and her other bruises healed with lily leaves steeped in strong waters.  \"Charley is gone to serve him out!\" announced Lucy as the sovereign remedy.  \"Oh, but perhaps he did not mean it,\" Anne tried to say.  \"Mean it?  Small question of that, the cankered young slip!  Nurse, do you think those he belongs to can do Charley any harm if he angers them?\"  \"I cannot say, missie.  Only 'tis well we be not at home, or there might be elf knots in the horses' manes to-night.  I doubt me whether _that sort_ can do much hurt here, seeing as 'tis holy ground.\"  \"But is he really a changeling?  I thought there were no such things as--\"  \"Hist, hist, Missie Anne!\" cried the dame; \"'tis not good to name them.\"  \"Oh, but we are on the Minster ground, nurse,\" said Lucy, trembling a little however, looking over her shoulder, and coming closer to the old servant.  \"Why do they think so?\" asked Anne.  \"Is it because he is so ugly and mischievous and rude?  Not like boys in London.\"  \"Prithee, nurse, tell her the tale,\" entreated Lucy, who had made large eyes over it many a time before.  \"Ay, and who should tell you all about it save me, who had it all from Goody Madge Bulpett, as saw it all!\"  \"Goody Madge!  It was she that came when poor little Kitty was born and died,\" suggested Lucy, as Anne, laying her aching head upon nurse's knees, prepared to listen to the story.  \"Well, deary darlings, you see poor Madam Oakshott never had her health since the Great Fire in London, when she was biding with her kinsfolk to be near Major Oakshott, who had got into trouble about some of his nonconforming doings.  The poor lady had a mortal fright before she could be got out of Gracechurch Street as was all of a blaze, and she was so afeard of her husband being burnt as he lay in Newgate that she could scarce be got away, and whether it was that, or that she caught cold lying out in a tent on Highgate Hill, she has never had a day's health since.\"  \"And the gentleman--her husband?\" asked Anne.  \"They all broke prison, poor fellows, as they had need to do, and the Major's time was nearly up.  He made himself busy in saving and helping the folk in the streets; and his brother, Sir Peregrine, who was thick with the King, and is in foreign parts now, took the chance to speak of the poor lady's plight and say it"]]]
