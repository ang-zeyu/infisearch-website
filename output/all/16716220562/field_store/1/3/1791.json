When we left them in their bower--it looked like a Hill priest's wayside shrine--we heard them singing through the steep-descending pines.  They, too, like the 75's, seem to have no pet name in the service.  It was a poisonously blind country.  The woods blocked all sense of direction above and around.  The ground was at any angle you please, and all sounds were split up and muddled by the tree-trunks, which acted as silencers.  High above us the respectable, all-concealing forest had turned into sparse, ghastly blue sticks of timber--an assembly of leper-trees round a bald mountain top.  \"That's where we're going,\" said Alan.  \"Isn't it an adorable country?\"  TRENCHES  A machine-gun loosed a few shots in the fumbling style of her kind when they feel for an opening.  A couple of rifle shots answered.  They might have been half a mile away or a hundred yards below.  An adorable country!  We climbed up till we found once again a complete tea-garden of little sunk houses, almost invisible in the brown-pink recesses of the thick forest.  Here the trenches began, and with them for the next few hours life in two dimensions--length and breadth.  You could have eaten your dinner almost anywhere off the swept dry ground, for the steep slopes favoured draining, there was no lack of timber, and there was unlimited labour.  It had made neat double-length dug-outs where the wounded could be laid in during their passage down the mountain side; well-tended occasional latrines properly limed; dug-outs for sleeping and eating; overhead protections and tool-sheds where needed, and, as one came nearer the working face, very clever cellars against trench-sweepers.  Men passed on their business; a squad with a captured machine-gun which they tested in a sheltered dip; armourers at their benches busy with sick rifles; fatigue-parties for straw, rations, and ammunition; long processions of single blue figures turned sideways between the brown sunless walls.  One understood after a while the nightmare that lays hold of trench-stale men, when the dreamer wanders for ever in those blind mazes till, after centuries of agonizing flight, he finds himself stumbling out again into the white blaze and horror of the mined front--he who thought he had almost reached home!  IN THE FRONT LINE  There were no trees above us now.  Their trunks lay along the edge of the trench, built in with stones, where necessary, or sometimes overhanging it in ragged splinters or bushy tops. Bits of cloth, not French, showed, too, in the uneven lines of debris at the trench lip, and some thoughtful soul had marked an unexploded Boche trench-sweeper as \"not to be touched.\"  It was a young lawyer from Paris who pointed that out to me.  We met the Colonel at the head of an indescribable pit of ruin, full of sunshine, whose steps ran down a very steep hillside under the lee of an almost vertically plunging parapet.  To the left of that parapet the whole hillside was one gruel of smashed trees, split stones, and powdered soil. It might have been a rag-picker's dump-heap on a colossal scale.  Alan looked at it critically.  I think he had helped to make it not long before.  \"We're on the top of the hill now, and the Boches are below us,\" said he.  \"We gave them a very fair sickener lately.\"  \"This,\" said the Colonel, \"is the front line.\"  There were overhead guards against hand-bombs which disposed me to believe him, but what convinced me most was a corporal urging us in whispers not to talk so loud.  The men were at dinner, and a good smell of food filled the trench.  This was the first smell I had encountered in my long travels uphill--a mixed, entirely wholesome flavour of stew, leather, earth, and rifle-oil.  FRONT LINE PROFESSIONALS  A proportion of men were standing to arms while others ate; but dinner-time is slack time, even among animals, and it was close on noon.  \"The Boches got _their_ soup a few days ago,\" some one whispered.  I thought of the pulverized hillside, and hoped it had been hot enough.  We edged along the still trench, where the soldiers stared, with justified contempt, I thought, upon the civilian who scuttled through their life for a few emotional minutes in order to make words out of their blood.  Somehow it reminded me of coming in late to a play and incommoding a long line of packed stalls.  The whispered dialogue was much the same: \"Pardon!\"  \"I beg your pardon, monsieur.\"  \"To the right, monsieur.\"  \"If monsieur will lower his head.\"  \"One sees best from here, monsieur,\" and so on.  It was their day and night-long business, carried through without display or heat, or doubt or indecision.  Those who worked, worked; those off duty, not five feet behind them in the dug-outs, were deep in their papers, or their meals or their letters; while death stood ready at every minute to drop down into the narrow cut from out of the narrow strip of unconcerned sky.  And for the better part of a week one had skirted hundreds of miles of such a frieze!  The loopholes not in use were plugged rather like old-fashioned hives.  Said the Colonel, removing a plug: \"Here are the Boches.  Look, and you'll see their sandbags.\" Through the jumble of riven trees and stones one saw what might have been a bit of green sacking.  \"They're about seven metres distant just here,\" the Colonel went on.  That was true, too.  We entered a little fortalice with a cannon in it, in an embrasure which at that moment struck me as unnecessarily vast, even though it was partly closed by a frail packing-case lid.  The Colonel sat him down in front of it, and explained the theory of this sort of redoubt.  \"By the way,\" he said to the gunner at last, \"can't you find something better than _that?\"_  He twitched the lid aside.  \"I think it's too light.  Get a log of wood or something.\"  HANDY TRENCH-SWEEPERS  I loved that Colonel!  He knew his men and he knew the Boches --had them marked down like birds.  When he said they were beside dead trees or behind boulders, sure enough there they were!  But, as I have said, the dinner-hour is always slack, and even when we came to a place where a section of trench had been bashed open by trench-sweepers, and it was recommended to duck and hurry, nothing much happened.  The uncanny thing was the absence of movement in the Boche trenches.  Sometimes one imagined that one smelt strange tobacco, or heard a rifle-bolt working after a shot.  Otherwise they were as still as pig at noonday.  We held on through the maze, past trench-sweepers of a handy light pattern, with their screw-tailed charge all ready; and a grave or so; and when I came on men who merely stood within easy reach of their rifles, I knew I was in the second line. When they lay frankly at ease in their dug-outs, I knew it was the third.  A shot-gun would have sprinkled all three.  \"No flat plains,\" said Alan.  \"No hunting for gun positions --the hills are full of them--and the trenches close together and commanding each other.  You see what a beautiful country it is.\"  The Colonel confirmed this, but from another point of view. War was his business, as the still woods could testify--but his hobby was his trenches.  He had tapped the mountain streams and dug out a laundry where a man could wash his shirt and go up and be killed in it, all in a morning; had drained the trenches till a muddy stretch in them was an offence; and at the bottom of the hill (it looked like a hydropathic establishment on the stage) he had created baths where half a battalion at a time could wash.  He never told me how all that country had been fought over as fiercely as Ypres in the West; nor what blood had gone down the valleys before his trenches pushed over the scalped mountain top.  No.  He sketched out new endeavours in earth and stones and trees for the comfort of his men on that populous mountain.  And there came a priest, who was a sub-lieutenant, out of a wood of snuff-brown shadows and half-veiled trunks.  Would it please me to look at a chapel?  It was all open to the hillside, most tenderly and devoutly done in rustic work with reedings of peeled branches and panels of moss and thatch--St. Hubert's own shrine.  I saw the hunters who passed before it, going to the chase on the far side of the mountain where their game lay.  .    .    .    .    .    .    .  A BOMBARDED TOWN  Alan carried me off to tea the same evening in a town where he seemed to know everybody.  He had spent the afternoon on another mountain top, inspecting gun positions; whereby he had been shelled a little--_marmite_ is the slang for it.  There had been no serious _marmitage,_ and he had spotted a Boche position which was _marmitable._  \"And we may get shelled now,\" he added, hopefully.  \"They shell this town whenever they think of it.  Perhaps they'll shell us at tea.\"  It was a quaintly beautiful little place, with its mixture of French and German ideas; its old bridge and gentle-minded river, between the cultivated hills.  The sand-bagged cellar doors, the ruined houses, and the holes in the pavement looked as unreal as the violences of a cinema against that soft and simple setting.  The people were abroad in the streets, and the little children were playing.  A big shell gives notice enough for one to get to shelter, if the shelter is near enough.  That appears to be as much as any one expects in the world where one is shelled, and that world has settled down to it.  People's lips are a little firmer, the modelling of the brows is a little more pronounced, and, maybe, there is a change in the expression of the eyes; but nothing that a casual afternoon caller need particularly notice.  CASES FOR HOSPITAL  The house where we took tea was the \"big house\" of the place, old and massive, a treasure house of ancient furniture.  It had everything that the moderate heart of man could desire --gardens, garages, outbuildings, and the air of peace that goes with beauty in age.  It stood over a high cellarage, and opposite the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12454"],["title","France at War: On the Frontier of Civilization (#7)"],["body","door was a brand-new blindage of earth packed between timbers.  The cellar was a hospital, with its beds and stores, and under the electric light the orderly waited ready for the cases to be carried down out of the streets.  \"Yes, they are all civil cases,\" said he.  They come without much warning--a woman gashed by falling timber; a child with its temple crushed by a flying stone; an urgent amputation case, and so on.  One never knows. Bombardment, the Boche text-books say, \"is designed to terrify the civil population so that they may put pressure on their politicians to conclude peace.\"  In real life, men are very rarely soothed by the sight of their women being tortured.  We took tea in the hall upstairs, with a propriety and an interchange of compliments that suited the little occasion. There was no attempt to disguise the existence of a bombardment, but it was not allowed to overweigh talk of lighter matters.  I know one guest who sat through it as near as might be inarticulate with wonder.  But he was English, and when Alan asked him whether he had enjoyed himself, he said: \"Oh, yes.  Thank you very much.\"  \"Nice people, aren't they?\" Alan went on.  \"Oh, very nice.  And--and such good tea.\"  He managed to convey a few of his sentiments to Alan after dinner.  \"But what else could the people have done?\" said he.  \"They are French.\"     VI  THE COMMON TASK OF A GREAT PEOPLE   \"This is the end of the line,\" said the Staff Officer, kindest and most patient of chaperons.  It buttressed itself on a fortress among hills.  Beyond that, the silence was more awful than the mixed noise of business to the westward.  In mileage on the map the line must be between four and five hundred miles; in actual trench-work many times that distance.  It is too much to see at full length; the mind does not readily break away from the obsession of its entirety or the grip of its detail.  One visualizes the thing afterwards as a white-hot gash, worming all across France between intolerable sounds and lights, under ceaseless blasts of whirled dirt.  Nor is it any relief to lose oneself among wildernesses of piling, stoning, timbering, concreting, and wire-work, or incalculable quantities of soil thrown up raw to the light and cloaked by the changing seasons--as the unburied dead are cloaked.  Yet there are no words to give the essential simplicity of it. It is the rampart put up by Man against the Beast, precisely as in the Stone Age.  If it goes, all that keeps us from the Beast goes with it.  One sees this at the front as clearly as one sees the French villages behind the German lines. Sometimes people steal away from them and bring word of what they endure.  Where the rifle and the bayonet serve, men use those tools along the front.  Where the knife gives better results, they go in behind the hand-grenades with the naked twelve-inch knife.  Each race is supposed to fight in its own way, but this war has passed beyond all the known ways.  They say that the Belgians in the north settle accounts with a certain dry passion which has varied very little since their agony began. Some sections of the English line have produced a soft-voiced, rather reserved type, which does its work with its mouth shut. The French carry an edge to their fighting, a precision, and a dreadful knowledge coupled with an insensibility to shock, unlike anything one has imagined of mankind.  To be sure, there has never been like provocation, for never since the Aesir went about to bind the Fenris Wolf has all the world united to bind the Beast.  The last I saw of the front was Alan Breck speeding back to his gun-positions among the mountains; and I wondered what delight of what household the lad must have been in the old days.  SUPPORTS AND RESERVES  Then we had to work our way, department by department, against the tides of men behind the line--supports and their supports, reserves and reserves of reserves, as well as the masses in training.  They flooded towns and villages, and when we tried short-cuts we found them in every by-lane.  Have you seen mounted men reading their home letters with the reins thrown on the horses' necks, moving in absorbed silence through a street which almost said \"Hush!\" to its dogs; or met, in a forest, a procession of perfectly new big guns, apparently taking themselves from the foundry to the front?  In spite of their love of drama, there is not much \"window-dressing\" in the French character.  The Boche, who is the priest of the Higher Counter-jumpery, would have had half the neutral Press out in cars to advertise these vast spectacles of men and material.  But the same instinct as makes their rich farmers keep to their smocks makes the French keep quiet.  \"This is our affair,\" they argue.  \"Everybody concerned is taking part in it.  Like the review you saw the other day, there are no spectators.\"  \"But it might be of advantage if the world knew.\"  Mine was a foolish remark.  There is only one world to-day, the world of the Allies.  Each of them knows what the others are doing and--the rest doesn't matter.  This is a curious but delightful fact to realize at first hand.  And think what it will be later, when we shall all circulate among each other and open our hearts and talk it over in a brotherhood more intimate than the ties of blood!  I lay that night at a little French town, and was kept awake by a man, somewhere in the hot, still darkness, howling aloud from the pain of his wounds.  I was glad that he was alone, for when one man gives way the others sometimes follow.  Yet the single note of misery was worse than the baying and gulping of a whole ward.  I wished that a delegation of strikers could have heard it.  .    .    .    .    .    .    .  That a civilian should be in the war zone at all is a fair guarantee of his good faith.  It is when he is outside the zone unchaperoned that questions begin, and the permits are looked into.  If these are irregular--but one doesn't care to contemplate it.  If regular, there are still a few counter-checks.  As the sergeant at the railway station said when he helped us out of an impasse:  \"You will realize that it is the most undesirable persons whose papers are of the most regular. It is their business you see.  The Commissary of Police is at the Hotel de Ville, if you will come along for the little formality.  Myself, I used to keep a shop in Paris.  My God, these provincial towns are desolating!\"  PARIS--AND NO FOREIGNERS  He would have loved his Paris as we found it.  Life was renewing itself in the streets, whose drawing and proportion one could never notice before.  People's eyes, and the women's especially, seemed to be set to a longer range, a more comprehensive gaze.  One would have said they came from the sea or the mountains, where things are few and simple, rather than from houses.  Best of all, there were no foreigners--the beloved city for the first time was French throughout from end to end.  It felt like coming back to an old friend's house for a quiet talk after he had got rid of a houseful of visitors. The functionaries and police had dropped their masks of official politeness, and were just friendly.  At the hotels, so like school two days before the term begins, the impersonal valet, the chambermaid of the set two-franc smile, and the unbending head-waiter had given place to one's own brothers and sisters, full of one's own anxieties.  \"My son is an aviator, monsieur.  I could have claimed Italian nationality for him at the beginning, but he would not have it.\"  .  .  . \"Both my brothers, monsieur, are at the war.  One is dead already.  And my fiance, I have not heard from him since March.  He is cook in a battalion.\"  .  .  .  \"Here is the wine-list, monsieur.  Yes, both my sons and a nephew, and--I have no news of them, not a word of news.  My God, we all suffer these days.\"  And so, too, among the shops--the mere statement of the loss or the grief at the heart, but never a word of doubt, never a whimper of despair.  \"Now why,\" asked a shopkeeper, \"does not our Government, or your Government, or both our Governments, send some of the British Army to Paris?  I assure you we should make them welcome.\"  \"Perhaps,\" I began, \"you might make them too welcome.\"  He laughed.  \"We should make them as welcome as our own army. They would enjoy themselves.\"  I had a vision of British officers, each with ninety days' pay to his credit, and a damsel or two at home, shopping consumedly.  \"And also,\" said the shopkeeper, \"the moral effect on Paris to see more of your troops would be very good.\"  But I saw a quite English Provost-Marshal losing himself in chase of defaulters of the New Army who knew their Paris! Still, there is something to be said for the idea--to the extent of a virtuous brigade or so.  At present, the English officer in Paris is a scarce bird, and he explains at once why he is and what he is doing there.  He must have good reasons. I suggested teeth to an acquaintance.  \"No good,\" he grumbled. \"They've thought of that, too.  Behind our lines is simply crawling with dentists now!\"  A PEOPLE TRANSFIGURED  If one asked after the people that gave dinners and dances last year, where every one talked so brilliantly of such vital things, one got in return the addresses of hospitals.  Those pleasant hostesses and maidens seemed to be in charge of departments or on duty in wards, or kitchens, or sculleries. Some of the hospitals were in Paris.  (Their staffs might have one hour a day in which to see visitors.)  Others were up the line, and liable to be shelled or bombed.  I recalled one Frenchwoman in particular, because she had once explained to me the necessities of civilized life.  These included a masseuse, a manicurist, and a maid to look after the lapdogs.  She is employed now, and has been for months past, on the disinfection and repair of soldiers' clothes. There was no need to ask after the men one had known.  Still, there was no sense of desolation."]]]
