I have been sometimes admiring the wonderful significancy of that word persecution, and what various interpretations it hath acquired even within my memory. When I was a boy, I often heard the Presbyterians complain that they were not permitted to serve God in their own way; they said they did not repine at our employments, but thought that all men who live peaceably ought to have liberty of conscience, and leave to assemble. That impediment being removed at the Revolution, they soon learned to swallow the Sacramental Test and began to take very large steps, wherein all that offered to oppose them, were called men of a persecuting spirit. During the time the Bill against Occasional Conformity was on foot, persecution was every day rung in our ears, and now at last the Sacramental Test itself has the same name. Where then is this matter likely to end, when the obtaining of one request is only used as a step to demand another? A lover is ever complaining of cruelty while anything is denied him, and when the lady ceases to be cruel, she is from the next moment at his mercy: So persecution it seems, is everything that will not leave it in men's power to persecute others.  There is one argument offered against a Sacramental Test, by a sort of men who are content to be styled of the Church of England, who perhaps attend its service in the morning, and go with their wives to a conventicle in the afternoon, confessing they hear very good doctrine in both. These men are much offended that so holy an institution as that of the Lord's Supper should be made subservient to such mercenary purposes as the getting of an employment. Now, it seems, the law, concluding all men to be members of that Church where they receive the Sacrament; and supposing all men to live like Christians (especially those who are to have employments) did imagine they received the Sacrament in course about four times a year, and therefore only desired it might appear by certificate to the public, that such who took an office were members of the Church established, by doing their ordinary duty. However, lest we should offend them, we have often desired they would deal candidly with us; for if the matter stuck only there, we would propose it in parliament, that every man who takes an employment should, instead of receiving the sacrament, be obliged to swear, that he is a member of the Church of Ireland by law established, with Episcopacy, and so forth; and as they do now in Scotland, _to be true to the Kirk_. But when we drive them thus far, they always retire to the main body of the argument, urge the hardship that men should be deprived the liberty of serving their Queen and country, on account of their conscience: And, in short, have recourse to the common style of their half brethren. Now whether this be a sincere way of arguing, I will appeal to any other judgment but theirs.  There is another topic of clamour somewhat parallel to the foregoing: It seems, by the Test clause, the military officers are obliged to receive the Sacrament as well as the civil. And it is a matter of some patience to hear the dissenters declaiming upon this occasion: They cry they are disarmed, they are used like Papists; when an enemy appears at home, or from abroad, they must sit still, and see their throats cut, or be hanged for high treason if they offer to defend themselves. Miserable condition! Woful dilemma! It is happy for us all, that the Pretender was not apprized of this passive Presbyterian principle, else he would have infallibly landed in our northern parts, and found them all sat down in their formalities, as the Gauls did the Roman senators, ready to die with honour in their callings. Sometimes to appease their indignation, we venture to give them hopes that in such a case the government will perhaps connive, and hardly be so severe to hang them for defending it against the letter of the law; to which they readily answer, that they will not lie at our mercy, but let us fight our battles ourselves. Sometimes we offer to get an act, by which upon all Popish insurrections at home, or Popish invasion from abroad, the government shall be empowered to grant commissions to all Protestants whatsoever, without that persecuting circumstance of obliging them to say their prayers when they receive the Sacrament; but they abhor all thoughts of occasional commissions, they will not do our drudgery, and we reap the benefit: It is not worth their while to fight _pro aris et focis_, and they had rather lose their estates, liberties, religion and lives, than the pleasure of governing.  But to bring this discourse toward a conclusion: If the dissenters will be satisfied with such a toleration by law as hath been granted them in England, I believe the majority of both Houses will fall readily in with it; farther it will be hard to persuade this House of Commons, and perhaps much harder the next. For, to say the truth, we make a mighty difference here between suffering thistles to grow among us, and wearing them for posies. We are fully convinced in our consciences, that _we_ shall always tolerate them, but not quite so fully that _they_ will always tolerate us, when it comes to their turn; and _we_ are the majority, and _we_ are in possession.  He who argues in defence of a law in force, not antiquated or obsolete, but lately enacted, is certainly on the safer side, and may be allowed to point out the dangers he conceives to foresee in the abrogation of it.  For if the consequences of repealing this clause, should at some time or other enable the Presbyterians to work themselves up into the National Church; instead of uniting Protestants, it would sow eternal divisions among them. First, their own sects, which now lie dormant, would be soon at cuffs again with each other about power and preferment; and the dissenting Episcopals, perhaps discontented to such a degree, as upon some fair unhappy occasion, would be able to shake the firmest loyalty, which none can deny theirs to be.  Neither is it very difficult to conjecture from some late proceedings, at what a rate this faction is likely to drive wherever it gets the whip and the seat. They have already set up courts of spiritual judicature in open contempt of the laws: They send missionaries everywhere, without being invited, in order to convert the Church of England folks to Christianity. They are as vigilant as _I know who_, to attend persons on their death-beds, and for purposes much alike. And what practices such principles as these (with many other that might be invidious to mention) may spawn when they are laid out to the sun, you may determine at leisure.  Lastly, Whether we are so entirely sure of their loyalty upon the present foot of government as you may imagine, their detractors make a question, which however, does, I think, by no means affect the body of dissenters; but the instance produced is, of some among their leading teachers in the north, who having refused the Abjuration Oath, yet continue their preaching, and have abundance of followers. The particulars are out of my head, but the fact is notorious enough, and I believe has been published; I think it a pity, it has not been remedied.  Thus, I have fairly given you, Sir, my own opinion, as well as that of a great majority in both Houses here, relating to this weighty affair, upon which I am confident you may securely reckon. I will leave you to make what use of it you please.  I am, with great respect, Sir,  Yours, &c.  *****       *****       *****       *****       *****     THE PRESBYTERIANS' PLEA OF MERIT.   NOTE.  THE reference casually made by Swift, in his \"Letter on the Sacramental Test,\" to his grandfather and the \"malignant Church,\" probably points to one of the causes for his persistent dislike towards the Protestant dissenters. His attitude displays a profound disgust both for their teaching and their conduct; and he found, very early, occasion to ridicule them, as may be seen in his description of Jack, Martin, and Peter in \"A Tale of a Tub\" (see vol. i. of this edition). In spite, however, of this attitude, Swift seems to have remained silent on the question of the repeal of the Test Act for a period of more than twenty years. He had published his \"Letter from a Member of the House of Commons in Ireland\" in 1708; but it was not until 1731 that he again took up his pen against Dissent.  In that year, and in the two subsequent ones, the Presbyterians fought very strenuously for a mitigation of the laws against them; and the literature which has been handed down to us of that fight is by no means insignificant. The tracts which we know to be of Swift's authorship are: \"The Presbyterians' Plea of Merit\" (1731); \"A Narrative of the several Attempts which the Dissenters of Ireland have made for a repeal of the Sacramental Test\" (1731); \"The Advantages proposed by Repealing the Sacramental Test impartially considered\" (1732); \"Queries Relating to the Sacramental Test\" (1732); \"Reasons humbly offered to the Parliament of Ireland for Repealing the Test in favour of Roman Catholics\" (1733); \"Some Few Thoughts Concerning the Test;\" and, according to Sir Walter Scott, \"Ten Reasons for Repealing the Test Act.\"  Monck Mason, in his elaborate note on this particular literature of the period (see \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" pp. 387, 388, notes), gives a list of sixteen pamphlets, many of which he considers to be so well written that they would have done no discredit to Swift himself. The list is here transcribed for the benefit of the student:  (i.) \"Nature and Consequences of the Sacramental Test considered; with Remarks humbly offered for the Repeal of it.\" 1732.  (ii.) \"Remarks on a Pamphlet, entitled, 'The Nature and Consequences of the Sacramental Test Considered.'\" Dublin, 1732, 12mo.  (iii.) \"The History of the Test Act: in which the Mistakes in some Writings against it are Rectified, and the Importance of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12746"],["title","The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, D.D. — Volume 04 (#5)"],["body"," to the Church explained.\" Printed at London and Dublin: and reprinted by George Faulkner. 1733, 12mo.  (iv.) \"Plain Reasons against the Repeal of the Test Act; humbly offered to publick Consideration.\" Dublin: printed by George Faulkner. 1733, 12mo.  (v.) \"The Test Act Examined by the Test of Reason.\" Dublin, 1733, 12mo.  (vi.) \"The Case of the Episcopal Dissenters in Scotland, and that of the Dissenters in Ireland Compared; with Relation to Toleration, and a Capacity for Civil Offices. In a Letter to a Member of Parliament.\" Dublin, 1733, 8vo.  ¶ This tract refers to another entitled: \"The Tables Turned against the Presbyterians; or, Reasons against the Sacramental Test, by a General Assembly of Scotland.\"  (vii.) \"The Case of the Test Considered, with respect to Ireland.\" Dublin, Faulkner, 1733.  (viii) \"The natural Impossibilities of better Uniting Protestants &c. by Repealing the Test.\" Dublin: Printed by George Faulkner, 1733.  (ix.) \"Ten Reasons for Repealing the Test Act.\"  ¶ Scott reprints this as Swift's from the broadside original.  (x-xi.) \"A Vindication of the Protestant Dissenters from the Aspersions Cast upon them in a late Pamphlet, entitled, 'The Presbyterians 'Plea of Merit &c.,' with some Remarks on a Paper called 'The Correspondent,' giving a pretended Narrative, &c.\"  ¶ Swift refers to this pamphlet in his \"Roman Catholic Reasons for Repealing the Test.\" It is also noted by the printer of the undated second edition of the London reprint of \"The Plea.\"  (xii.) \"The Dispute Adjusted, about the _proper time_ of applying for a Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts: by shewing that _no time is proper_. By the Reverend Father in God, Edmund Lord Bishop of London.\"  ¶ Faulkner, in the second edition of \"The Presbyterians' Plea,\" advertises this tract to appear in 1733. The author of \"The Case of the Episcopal Dissenters in Scotland\" mentions that it has been \"lately re-printed\" in Ireland, but that it is \"falsely ascribed to the Bishop of London.\"  (xiii.) \"The Test Act considered in a Political Light.\" 1733. Broadside.  (xiv.) \"Queries upon the Demand of the Presbyterians to have the Sacramental Test Repealed at this Session of Parliament.\" 1733. Broadside.  ¶ These Queries differ somewhat from those put by Swift in 1732.  (xv.) \"A Letter from a Freeman of a certain Burrough, in the North of Ireland, to his Friend and Representative in Parliament; shewing Reasons why the Test Act should not be Repealed.\" 1733. Broadside.  (xvi.)   \"The Grunter's Request        To take Off the Test.\"                      [A Poem.] 1733. 12mo.  Scott suggests (\"Life of Jonathan Swift,\" 1824, p.401) that \"probably more occasional tracts\" were written by the Dean on the subject of the Test \"than have yet been recovered.\" The curious student may satisfy himself on this matter by reading the above pamphlets. Neither Monck Mason, Dr. Barrett, nor Scott himself, cared to take upon themselves to decide whether any of them were by Swift; nor have any of the Dean's modern biographers thrown any light on the subject. A point to note in this consideration is the fact that Faulkner, in his collected edition of Swift's works, did not include any of these; and, as he himself published many of them, he would certainly have known something of their authorship.  Swift's agitation against the repeal of the Test was so successful that the Irish House of Commons found itself in a majority for the Test. In addition to the prose tracts Swift wrote a stinging poem \"On the Words Brother Protestants and Fellow Christians,\" an expression familiarly used by the advocates for the Repeal of the Test Act. This poem brought him into personal conflict with one Serjeant Bettesworth, who \"openly swore, before many hundreds of people, that upon the first opportunity, by the help of ruffians, he would murder or maim the Dean of St. Patrick's.\" The lines to which the Serjeant took exception were:    \"Thus at the bar the booby Bettesworth,   Though half-a-crown o'erpays his sweat's worth;   Who knows in law, nor text, nor margent,   Calls Singleton his brother serjeant.\"  The affair ended in the further ridicule of Bettesworth, who complained in the Irish House of Commons that the lampoon had cost him £1,200 a year. A full account of Swift's interview with Bettesworth is given by Swift in a letter to the Duke of Dorset, dated January, 1733-1734; and the \"Grub Street Journal\" for August 9th, 1734, tells how the inhabitants of the City of Dublin came to Swift's aid. Perhaps Bettesworth finally found consolation in the thought, satirically suggested by Dr. William Dunkin, that, after all, it might be worth the loss of money to be \"transmitted to posterity in Dr. Swift's works.\"    \"For had he not pointed me out, I had slept till   E'en Doomsday, a poor insignificant reptile;   Half lawyer, half actor, pert, dull, and inglorious,   Obscure, and unheard of--but now I'm notorious:   Fame has but two gates, a white and a black one;   The worst they can say is, I got in at the back one:   If the end be obtained 'tis equal what portal   I enter, since I'm to be render'd immortal:   So clysters applied to the anus, 'tis said,   By skilful physicians, give ease to the head--   Though my title be spurious, why should I be dastard,   A man is a man though he should be a bastard.   Why sure 'tis some comfort that heroes should slay us,   If I fall, I would fall by the hand of Aeneas;   And who by the Drapier would not rather damn'd be,   Than demigoddized by madrigal Namby.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Namby was the nickname for Ambrose Philips.]  Scott, and all Swift's editors and biographers, state that \"The Presbyterians' Plea of Merit\" was first published in 1731. What authority they have for this statement, I have not been able to discover. My own research has, so far, failed to find a copy of it with the date, 1731, on the title-page. The edition upon which the present text is based, is that printed by Faulkner in 1733, of the title-page of which, a facsimile is here given. This, I believe to be the first edition. Scott, following Nichols, states that in the first edition of \"The Plea,\" the \"Ode to Humphry French, Esq.,\" appeared, and that in the second edition, this ode was omitted to make room for the \"Narrative of the Several Attempts made for the Repeal of the Test Act.\" Now in the British Museum, there are two _undated_ editions of \"The Plea,\" which bear out this statement; but these, as the title-pages inform us, are London reprints of Dublin editions. Since, however, no one has recorded dated Dublin editions corresponding exactly to these London reprints, the evidence of the reprints counts for very little. Monck Mason, a very accurate authority, usually, says distinctly, \"The Plea\" was printed in 1731, and a second edition issued in 1733; but one gathers from his note that the only edition in his possession was that of 1733, and this has neither the \"Ode\" nor the \"Narrative\"; the last page consisting of an advertisement of the collected editions of Swift's works, which Faulkner was then preparing. The first of the London reprints bears no indication of any particular edition; the second has the words \"second edition\" on the title-page. In his note to this reprint of the \"Narrative,\" and in his \"Life of Swift,\" Scott refers to a Dublin periodical called \"The Correspondent\" (in which the \"Narrative\" was first published) as being printed in 1731. The only edition of this periodical, of which I have either seen or heard, is the copy in the British Museum, and that copy distinctly states: \"Printed by James Hoey in Skinner-Row, 1733.\" If, therefore, this be the first edition of \"The Correspondent,\" the \"Narrative\" must be ascribed to the year 1733, and the second edition of \"The Plea\" to the end of the same, or the beginning of the following year. I conclude, therefore, first, that the first edition of \"The Plea\" is that dated \"Dublin, 1733;\" second, that the undated London reprint with the \"Ode\" is of the same year; and, lastly, that the undated second London reprint with the \"Narrative,\" is probably of the year, 1734. Examining Scott's text of this tract, one is forced to the conclusion that he could not have seen the Dublin edition of 1733; whereas, its almost exact similarity to the London reprint suggests that he used that. For purposes of the present text all three editions have been collated with one another, and with those given by Faulkner, Hawkesworth and Scott.  [T.S.]    THE   _Presbyterians_ PLEA   OF   MERIT;   In Order to take off the   TEST,   Impartially Examined.    [Illustration]    _DUBLIN:_    Printed and fold by GEORGE FAULKNER, in   _Essex-Street_, opposite to the _Bridge_, 1733.   We have been told in the common newspapers, that all attempts are to be made this session by the Presbyterians, and their abettors, for taking off the Test, as a kind of preparatory step, to make it go down smoother in England. For, if once their light would so shine, the Papists, delighted with the blaze, would all come in, and dance about it. This I take to be a prudent method; like that of a discreet physician, who first gives a new medicine to a dog, before he prescribes it to a human creature.[1]  [Footnote 1: See note prefixed to the \"Letter on the Sacramental Test.\" [T.S.]]  The Presbyterians have, ever since the Revolution directed their learned casuists to employ their pens on this subject; by shewing the merits and pretensions upon which they claim this justice; as founded upon the services they did toward the restoration of King Charles the Second; and at the Revolution under the Prince of Orange. Which pleas I take to be the most singular, in their kind, that ever were offered in the face of the sun, against the most glaring light of truth, and against a continuation of public facts, known to all Europe for twenty years together. I shall, therefore, impartially examine the merits and conduct of the Presbyterians, upon those two great events; and the"]]]
