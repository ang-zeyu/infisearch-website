I'm not exactly a dunce, but I don't think I shall ever be a Greek professor.\"  \"If you speak of yourself that way, what will you think of me?  I don't know a word of Latin, of Greek, or any language except my own.\"  \"Because you have had no chance to learn.  There's one language I know more about than Latin or Greek.\"  \"English?\"  \"I mean French; I spent a year at a French boarding-school, three years since.\"  \"What!  Have you been in France?\"  \"Yes; an uncle of mine--in fact, the editor--was going over, and urged father to send me.  I learned considerable French, but not much else.  I can speak and understand it pretty well.\"  \"How I wish I had had your advantages,\" said Harry.  \"How did you like your French schoolmates?\"  \"They wouldn't come near me at first.  Because I was an American they thought I carried a revolver and a dirk-knife, and was dangerous. That is their idea of American boys.  When they found I was tame, and carried no deadly weapons, they ventured to speak with me, and after that we got along pretty well.\"  \"How soon do you expect to go to college?\"  \"A year from next summer.  I suppose I shall be ready by that time. You are going to stay in town, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, if I keep my place.\"  \"Oh, you'll do that.  Then we can see something of each other.  You must come up to my room, and see me.  Come almost any evening.\"  \"I should like to.  Do you live in Dr. Barton's family?\"  \"No, I hope not.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Oh, the Doctor has a way of looking after the fellows that room in the house, and of keeping them at work all the time.  That wouldn't suit me.  I board at Mrs. Greyson's, at the south-east corner of the church common.  Have you got anything to do this evening?\"  \"Nothing in particular.\"  \"Then come round and take a look at my den, or sanctum I ought to call it; as I am talking to a member of the editorial profession.\"  \"Not quite yet,\" said Harry, smiling.  \"Oh, well that'll come in due time.  Will you come?\"  \"Sha'n't I be disturbing you?\"  \"Not a bit.  My Greek lesson is about finished, and that's all I've got to do this evening.  Come round, and we will sit over the fire, and chat like old friends.\"  \"Thank you, Oscar,\" said Harry, irresistibly attracted by his bright and lively acquaintance, \"I shall enjoy calling.  I have made no acquaintances yet, and I feel lonely.\"  \"I have got over that,\" said Oscar.  \"I am used to being away from home and don't mind it.\"  The two boys walked together to Oscar's boarding-place.  It was a large house, of considerable pretension for a village, and Oscar's room was large and handsomely furnished.  But what attracted Harry's attention was not the furniture, but a collection of over a hundred books, ranged on shelves at one end of the room.  In his father's house it had always been so difficult to obtain the necessaries of life that books had necessarily been regarded as superfluities, and beyond a dozen volumes which Harry had read and re-read, he was compelled to depend on such as he could borrow.  Here again his privileges were scanty, for most of the neighbors were as poorly supplied as his father.  \"What a fine library you have, Oscar!\" he exclaimed.  \"I have a few books,\" said Oscar.  \"My father filled a couple of boxes, and sent me.  He has a large library.\"  \"This seems a large library to me,\" said Harry.  \"My father likes reading, but he is poor, and cannot afford to buy books.\"  He said that in a matter-of-fact tone, without the least attempt to conceal what many boys would have been tempted to hide.  Oscar noted this, and liked his new friend the better for it.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"books cost money, and one hasn't always the money to spare.\"  \"Have you read all these books?\"  \"Not more than half of them.  I like reading better than studying, I am afraid.  I am reading the Waverley novels now.  Have you read any of them?\"  \"So; I never saw any of them before.\"  \"If you see anything you would like to read, I will lend it to you with pleasure,\" said Oscar, noticing the interest with which Harry regarded the books.  \"Will you?\" said Harry, eagerly.  \"I can't tell you how much obliged I am.  I will take good care of it.\"  \"Oh, I am sure of that.  Here, try Ivanhoe.  I've just read it, and it's tip-top.\"  \"Thank you; I will take it on your recommendation.  What a nice room you have!\"  \"Yes, it's pretty comfortable.  Father told me to fix it up to suit me.  He said he wouldn't mind the expense if I would only study.\"  \"I should think anybody might study in such a room as this, and with such a fine collection of books.\"  \"I'm rather lazy sometimes,\" said Oscar, \"but I shall turn over a new leaf some of these days, and astonish everybody.  To-night, as I have no studying to do, I'll tell you what we'll do.  Did you ever pop corn?\"  \"Sometimes.\"  \"I've got some corn here, and Ma'am Greyson has a popper.  Stay here alone a minute, and I'll run down and get it.\"  Oscar ran down stairs, and speedily returned with a corn-popper.  \"Now we'll have a jolly time,\" said he.  \"Draw up that arm-chair, and make yourself at home.  If Xenophon, or Virgil, or any of those Greek and Latin chaps call, we'll tell 'em we are transacting important business and can't be disturbed.  What do you say?\"  \"They won't be apt to call on me,\" said Harry.  I haven't the pleasure of knowing them.\"  \"It isn't always a pleasure, I can assure you, Harry.  Pass over the corn-popper.\"     CHAPTER  V.  A YOUNG F. F. B.  As the two boys sat in front of the fire, popping and eating the corn, and chatting of one thing and another, their acquaintance improved rapidly.  Harry learned that Oscar's father was a Boston merchant, in the Calcutta trade, with a counting-room on Long Wharf. Oscar was a year older than himself, and the oldest child.  He had a sister of thirteen, named Florence, and a younger brother, Charlie, now ten.  They lived on Beacon Street, opposite the Common.  Though Harry had never lived in Boston, be knew that this was a fashionable street, and he had no difficulty in inferring that Mr. Vincent was a rich man.  He felt what a wide gulf there was socially between himself and Oscar; one the son of a very poor country farmer, the other the son of a merchant prince.  But nothing in Oscar's manner indicated the faintest feeling of superiority, and this pleased Harry.  I may as well say, however, that our hero was not one to show any foolish subserviency to a richer boy; he thought mainly of Oscar's superiority in knowledge; and although the latter was far ahead of Harry on this score, he was not one to boast of it.  Harry, in return for Oscar's confidence, acquainted him with his own adventures since he had started out to earn his own living.  Oscar was most interested in his apprenticeship to the ventriloquist.  \"It must have been jolly fun,\" he said.   \"I shouldn't mind travelling round with him myself.  Can you perform any tricks?\"  \"A few,\" said Harry.  \"Show me some, that's a good fellow.\"  \"If you won't show others.  Professor Henderson wouldn't like to have his tricks generally known.  I could show more if I had the articles he uses.  But I can do some without.\"  \"Go ahead, Professor.  I'm all attention.\"  Not having served an apprenticeship to a magician, as Harry did, I will not undertake to describe the few simple tricks which he had picked up, and now exhibited for the entertainment of his companion. It is enough to say that they were quite satisfactory, and that Oscar professed his intention to puzzle his Boston friends with them, when his vacation arrived.  About half-past eight, a knock was heard at the door.  \"Come in!\" called out Oscar.  The door was opened, and a boy about his own age entered.   His name was Fitzgerald Fletcher.  He was also a Boston boy, and the son of a retail merchant, doing business on Washington street.  His father lived handsomely, and was supposed to be rich.  At any rate Fitzgerald supposed him to be so, and was very proud of the fact.  He generally let any new acquaintances understand very speedily that his father was a man of property, and that his family moved in the first circles of Boston Society.  He cultivated the acquaintance of those boys who belonged to rich families, and did not fail to show the superiority which he felt to those of less abundant means.  For example, he liked to be considered intimate with Oscar, as the social position of Mr. Vincent was higher than that of his own family.  It gave him an excuse also for calling on Oscar in Boston.  He had tried to ingratiate himself also with Oscar's sister Florence, but had only disgusted her with his airs, so that he could not flatter himself with his success in this direction.  Oscar had very little liking for him, but as school-fellows they often met, and Fitzgerald often called upon him.  On such occasions he treated him politely enough, for it was not in his nature to be rude without cause.  Fitz was elaborately dressed, feeling that handsome clothes would help convey the impression of wealth, which he was anxious to establish.  In particular he paid attention to his neckties, of which he boasted a greater variety than any of his school-mates.  It was not a lofty ambition, but, such as it was, he was able to gratify it.  \"How are you, Fitz?\" said Oscar, when he saw who was his visitor. \"Draw up a chair to the fire, and make yourself comfortable.\"  \"Thank you, Oscar,\" said Fitzgerald, leisurely drawing off a pair of kid gloves; \"I thought I would drop in and see you.\"  \"All right!  Will you have some popped corn?\"  \"No, thank you,\" answered Fitzgerald, shrugging his shoulders.  \"I don't fancy the article.\"  \"Don't you?  Then you don't know what's good.\"  \"Fancy passing round popped corn at a party in Boston,\" said the other.  \"How people would stare!\"  \"Would they?  I don't know about that.  I think some would be more sensible and eat.  But, I beg your pardon, I haven't introduced you to my friend, Harry Walton.  Harry, this is a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12741"],["title","Risen from the Ranks; Or, Harry Walton's Success (#4)"],["body","of mine. Fitzgerald Fletcher, Esq., of Boston.\"  Fitzgerald did not appear to perceive that the title Esq. was sportively added to his name.  He took it seriously, and was pleased with it, as a recognition of his social superiority.  He bowed ceremoniously to our hero, and said, formally, \"I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Walton.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Fletcher,\" replied Harry, bowing in turn.  \"I wonder who he is,\" thought Fitzgerald.  He had no idea of the true position of our young hero, or he would not have wasted so much politeness upon him.  The fact was, that Harry was well dressed, having on the suit which had been given him by a friend from the city.  It was therefore fashionably cut, and had been so well kept as still to be in very good condition.  It occurred to Fitz--to give him the short name he received from his school-fellows--that it might be a Boston friend of Oscar's, just entering the Academy.  This might account for his not having met him before.  Perhaps he was from an aristocratic Boston family.  His intimacy with Oscar rendered it probable, and it might be well to cultivate his acquaintance.  On this hint he spoke.  \"Are you about to enter the Academy, Mr. Walton?\"  \"No; I should like to do so, but cannot.\"  \"You are one of Oscar's friends from the city, I suppose, then?\"  \"Oh no; I am living in Centreville.\"  \"Who can he be?\" thought Fitz.  With considerable less cordiality in his manner, he continued, impelled by curiosity,--  \"I don't think I have met you before.\"  \"No: I have only just come to the village.\"  Oscar understood thoroughly the bewilderment of his visitor, and enjoyed it.  He knew the weakness of Fitz, and he could imagine how his feelings would change when be ascertained the real position of Harry.  \"My friend,\" he explained, \"is connected with the 'Centreville Gazette.'\"  \"In what capacity?\" asked Fitz, in surprise.  \"He is profanely termed the 'printer's devil.' Isn't that so, Harry?\"  \"I believe you are right,\" said our hero, smiling.  He had a suspicion that this relation would shock his new acquaintance.  \"Indeed!\" ejaculated Fitz, pursing up his lips, and, I was about to say, turning up his nose, but nature had saved him the little trouble of doing that.  \"What in the world brings him here, then?\" he thought; but there was no need of saying it, for both Oscar and Harry read it in his manner. \"Strange that Oscar Vincent, from one of the first families of Boston, should demean himself by keeping company with a low printer boy!\"  \"Harry and I have had a jolly time popping corn this evening!\" said Oscar, choosing to ignore his school-mate's changed manner.  \"Indeed!  I can't see what fun there is in it.\"  \"Oh, you've got no taste.  Has he, Harry?\"  \"His taste differs from ours,\" said our hero, politely.  \"I should think so,\" remarked Fitz, with significant emphasis.  \"Was that all you had to amuse yourself?\"  In using the singular pronoun, he expressly ignored the presence of the young printer.  \"No, that wasn't all.  My friend Harry has been amusing me with some tricks which he learned while he was travelling round with Professor Henderson, the ventriloquist and magician.\"  \"Really, he is quite accomplished,\" said Fitz, with a covert sneer. \"Pretty company Oscar has taken up with!\" he thought.  \"How long were you in the circus business?\" he asked, turning to Harry.  \"I never was in the circus business.\"  \"Excuse me.  I should say, travelling about with the ventriloquist.\"  \"About three months.  I was with him when he performed here last winter.\"  \"Ah! indeed.  I didn't go.   My father doesn't approve of my attending such common performances.  I only attend first-class theatres, and the Italian opera.\"  \"That's foolish,\" said Oscar.  \"You miss a good deal of fun, then.  I went to Professor Henderson's entertainment, and I now remember seeing you there, Harry.  You took money at the door, didn't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Now I understand what made your face seem so familiar to me, when I saw it this afternoon.  By the way, I have never been into a printing office.  If I come round to yours, will you show me round?\"  \"I should be very glad to, Oscar, but perhaps you had better wait till I have been there a little while, and learned the ropes.  I know very little about it yet.\"  \"Won't you come too, Fitz?\" asked Oscar.  \"You must really excuse me,\" drawled Fitz.  \"I have heard that a printing office is a very dirty place.  I should be afraid of soiling my clothes.\"  \"Especially that stunning cravat.\"  \"Do you like it?  I flatter myself it's something a little extra,\" said Fitz, who was always gratified by a compliment to his cravats.  \"Then you won't go?\"  \"I haven't the slightest curiosity about such a place, I assure you.\"  \"Then I shall have to go alone.  Let me know when you are ready to receive me, Harry.\"  \"I won't forget, Oscar.\"  \"I wonder he allows such a low fellow to call him by his first name,\" thought Fitz.  \"Really, he has no proper pride.\"  \"Well,\" he said, rising, \"I must be going.\"  \"What's your hurry, Fitz?\"  \"I've got to write a letter home this evening.  Besides, I haven't finished my Greek.  Good-evening, Oscar.\"  \"Good-evening, Fitz.\"  \"Good-evening, Mr. Fletcher,\" said Harry.  \"Evening!\" ejaculated Fitz, briefly; and without a look at the low \"printer-boy,\" he closed the door and went down stairs.     CHAPTER VI.  OSCAR BECOMES A PROFESSOR  \"I am afraid your friend won't thank you for introducing me to him,\" said Harry, after Fitz had left the room.  \"Fitz is a snob,\" said Oscar.  \"He makes himself ridiculous by putting on airs, and assuming to be more than he is.  His father is in a good business, and may be rich--I don't know about that--but that isn't much to boast of.\"  \"I don't think we shall be very intimate,\" said Harry, smiling. \"Evidently a printer's apprentice is something very low in his eyes.\"  \"When you are an influential editor he will be willing to recognize you.  Let that stimulate your ambition.\"  \"It isn't easy for a half-educated boy to rise to such a position.  I feel that I know very little.\"  \"If I can help you any, Harry, I shall be very glad to do it.  I'm not much of a scholar, but I can help you a little.  For instance, if you wanted to learn French, I could hear your lessons, and correct your exercises.\"  \"Will you?\" said Harry, eagerly.  \"There is nothing I should like better.\"  \"Then I'll tell you what I'll do.  You shall buy a French grammar, and come to my room two evenings a week, and recite what you get time to study at home.\"  \"Won't it give you a great deal of trouble, Oscar?\"  \"Not a bit of it; I shall rather like it.  Until you can buy a grammar, I will lend you mine.  I'll set you a lesson out of it now.\"  He took from the book-shelves a French grammar, and inviting Harry to sit down beside him, gave him some necessary explanations as to the pronunciation of words according to the first lesson.  \"It seems easy,\" said Harry.  \"I can take more than that.\"  \"It is the easiest of the modern languages, to us at least, on account of its having so many words similar to ours.\"  \"What evening shall I come, Oscar?\"  \"Tuesday and Friday will suit me as well as any.  And remember, Harry, I mean to be very strict in discipline.  And, by the way, how will it do to call myself Professor?\"  \"I'll call you Professor if you want me to.\"  \"We'll leave all high titles to Fitz, and I won't use the rod any oftener than it is absolutely necessary.\"  \"All right, Professor Vincent,\" said Harry laughing, \"I'll endeavor to behave with propriety.\"  \"I wonder what they would say at home,\" said Oscar, \"if they knew I had taken up the profession of teacher.  Strange as it may seem to you, Harry, I have the reputation in the home-circle of being decidedly lazy.  How do you account for it?\"  \"Great men are seldom appreciated.\"  \"You hit the nail on the head that time--glad I am not the nail, by the way.  Henceforth I will submit with resignation to injustice and misconstruction, since I am only meeting with the common fate of great men.\"  \"What time is it, Oscar?\"  \"Nearly ten.\"  \"Then I will bid you good-night,\" and Harry rose to go.  \"I can't tell how much I am obliged to you for your kind offer.\"  \"Just postpone thanks till you find out whether I am a good teacher or not.\"  \"I am sure of that.\"  \"I am not so sure, but I will do what I can for you.  Good-night. I'll expect you Friday evening.  I shall see Fitz to-morrow.  Shall I give him your love?\"  \"Never mind!\" said Harry, smiling.  \"I'm afraid it wouldn't be appreciated.\"  \"Perhaps not.\"  As Harry left his lively companion, he felt that he had been most fortunate in securing his friendship--not only that he found him very agreeable and attractive, but he was likely to be of great use to him in promoting his plans of self-education.  He had too much good sense not to perceive that the only chance he had of rising to an influential position lay in qualifying himself for it, by enlarging his limited knowledge and improving his mind.  \"I have made a good beginning,\" he thought.  \"After I have learned something of French, I will take up Latin, and I think Oscar will be willing to help me in that too.\"  The next morning he commenced work in the printing office.  With a few hints from Ferguson, he soon comprehended what he had to do, and made very rapid progress.  \"You're getting on fast, Harry,\" said Ferguson approvingly.  \"I like it,\" said our hero.  \"I am glad I decided to be a printer.\"  \"I wish I wasn't one,\" grumbled Clapp, the younger journeyman.  \"Don't you like it?\"  \"Not much.  It's hard work and poor pay.  I just wish I was in my brother's shoes.  He is a bookkeeper in Boston, with a salary of twelve hundred a year, while I am plodding along on fifteen dollars week.\"  \"You may do better some day,\" said Ferguson.  \"Don't see any chance of it.\"  \"If I were in your place, I would save up part of my salary, and by and by have an office, and perhaps a paper of my own.\"  \"Why don't you do"]]]
