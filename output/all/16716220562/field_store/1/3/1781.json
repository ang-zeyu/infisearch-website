She offered to take him to his room as soon as he wished to go. He was quite willing. He wanted to be alone, to think. But when he followed her she stopped him in the hall. Buck Daniels lumbered slowly after them in a clumsy attempt at sauntering.  \"Well?\" asked Kate Cumberland.  She had thrown a blue mantle over her shoulders when she entered the house, and the touch of boyish self-confidence which had been hers on the ride was gone. In its place there was something even more difficult for Randall Byrne to face. If there had been a garish brightness about her when he had first seen her, the brilliancy of a mirror playing in the sun against his feeble eyes, there was now a blending of pastel shades, for the hall was dimly illumined and the shadow tarnished her hair and her pallor was like cold stone; even her eyes were misted by fear. Yet a vital sense of her nearness swept upon Byrne, and he felt as if he were surrounded--by a danger.  \"Opinions,\" said the doctor, \"based on so summary an examination are necessarily inexact, yet the value of a first impression is not negligible. The best I can say is that there is probably no immediate danger, but Mr. Cumberland is seriously ill. Furthermore, it is _not_ old age.\"  He would not say all he thought; it was not yet time.  She winced and clasped her hands tightly together. She was like a child about to be punished for a crime it has not committed, and it came vaguely to the doctor that he might have broached his ill tidings more gently.  He added: \"I must have further opportunities for observance before I give a detailed opinion and suggest a treatment.\"  Her glance wandered past him and at once the heavy step of Buck Daniels approached.  \"At least,\" she murmured, \"I am glad that you are frank. I don't want to have anything kept from me, please. Buck, will you take the doctor up to his room?\" She managed a faint smile. \"This is an old-fashioned house, Doctor Byrne, but I hope we can make you fairly comfortable. You'll ask for whatever you need?\"  The doctor bowed, and was told that they would dine in half an hour, then the girl went back towards the room in which Joe Cumberland lay. She walked slowly, with her head bent, and her posture seemed to Byrne the very picture of a burden-bearer. Then he followed Daniels up the stairs, led by the jingling of the spurs, great-rowelled spurs that might grip the side of a refractory horse like teeth.  A hall-light guided them, and from the hall Buck Daniels entered a room and fumbled above him until he had lighted a lamp which was suspended by two chains from the ceiling, a circular burner which cast a glow as keen as an electric globe. It brought out every detail of the old-fashioned room--the bare, painted floor; the bed, in itself a separate and important piece of architecture with its four tall posts, a relic of the times when beds were built, not simply made; and there was a chest of drawers with swelling, hospitable front, and a rectangular mirror above with its date in gilt paint on the upper edge. A rising wind shook the window and through some crack stirred the lace curtains; it was a very comfortable retreat, and the doctor became aware of aching muscles and a heavy brain when he glanced at the bed.  The same gust of wind which rattled the window-pane now pushed, as with invisible and ghostly hand, a door which opened on the side of the bedroom, and as it swung mysteriously and gradually wide the doctor found himself looking into an adjoining chamber. All he could see clearly was a corner on which struck the shaft of light from the lamp, and lying on the floor in that corner was something limp and brown. A snake, he surmised at first, but then he saw clearly that it was a chain of formidable proportions bolted against the wall at one end and terminating at the other in a huge steel collar. A chill started in the boots of the doctor and wriggled its uncomfortable way up to his head.  \"Hell!\" burst out Buck Daniels. \"How'd _that_ door get open?\" He slammed it with violence. \"She's been in there again, I guess,\" muttered the cowpuncher, as he stepped back, scowling.  \"Who?\" ventured the doctor.  Buck Daniels whirled on him.  \"None of your--\" he began hotly, but checked himself with choking suddenness and strode heavily from the room.     CHAPTER V  THE WAITING   The doctor removed his coat with absent-minded slowness, and all the time that he was removing the dust and the stains of travel, he kept narrowing the eye of his mind to visualise more clearly that cumbersome chain which lay on the floor of the adjoining room. Now, the doctor was not of a curious or gossipy nature, but if someone had offered to tell him the story of that chain for a thousand dollars, the doctor at that moment would have thought the price ridiculously small.  Then the doctor went down to the dinner table prepared to keep one eye upon Buck Daniels and the other upon Kate Cumberland. But if he expected to learn through conversation at the table he was grievously disappointed, for Buck Daniels ate with an eye to strict business that allowed no chatter, and the girl sat with a forced smile and an absent eye. Now and again Buck would glance up at her, watch her for an instant, and then turn his attention back to his plate with a sort of gloomy resolution; there were not half a dozen words exchanged from the beginning to the end of the meal.  After that they went in to the invalid. He lay in the same position, his skinny hands crossed upon his breast, and his shaggy brows were drawn so low that the eyes were buried in profound shadow. They took positions in a loose semi-circle, all pointing towards the sick man, and it reminded Byrne with grim force of a picture he had seen of three wolves waiting for the bull moose to sink in the snows: they, also, were waiting for a death. It seemed, indeed, as if death must have already come; at least it could not make him more moveless than he was. Against the dark wall his profile was etched by a sharp highlight which was brightest of all on his forehead and his nose; while the lower portion of the face was lost in comparative shadow.  So perfect and so detailed was the resemblance to death, indeed, that the lips in the shadow smiled--fixedly. It was not until Kate Cumberland shifted a lamp, throwing more light on her father, that Byrne saw that the smile was in reality a forcible compression of the lips. He understood, suddenly, that the silent man on the couch was struggling terribly against an hysteria of emotion. It brought beads of sweat out upon the doctor's tall forehead; for this perfect repose suggested an agony more awful than yells and groans and struggles. The silence was like acid; it burned without a flame. And Byrne knew, that moment, the quality of the thing which had wasted the rancher. It was this acid of grief or yearning which had eaten deep into him and was now close to his heart. The girl had said that for six months he had been failing. Six months! Six eternities of burning at the stake!  He lay silent, waiting; and his resignation meant that he knew death would come before that for which he waited. Silence, that was the key-note of the room. The girl was silent, her eyes dark with grief; yet they were not fixed upon her father. It came thrilling home to Byrne that her sorrow was not entirely for her dying parent, for she looked beyond him rather than at him. Was she, too, waiting? Was that what gave her the touch of sad gravity, the mystery like the mystery of distance?  And Buck Daniels. He, also, said nothing. He rolled cigarettes one after another with amazing dexterity and smoked them with half a dozen Titanic breaths. His was a single-track mind. He loved the girl, and he bore the sign of his love on his face. He wanted her desperately; it was a hunger like that of Tantalus, too keen to be ever satisfied. Yet, still more than he looked at the girl, he, also, stared into the distance. He, also, was waiting!  It was the deep suspense of Cumberland which made him so silently alert. He was as intensely alive as the receiver of a wireless apparatus; he gathered information from the empty air.  So that Byrne was hardly surprised, when, in the midst of that grim silence, the old man raised a rigid forefinger of warning. Kate and Daniels stiffened in their chairs and Byrne felt his flesh creep. Of course it was nothing. The wind, which had shaken the house with several strong gusts before dinner, had now grown stronger and blew with steadily increasing violence; perhaps the sad old man had been attracted by the mournful chorus and imagined some sound he knew within it.  But now once more the finger was raised, the arm extended, shaking violently, and Joe Cumberland turned upon them a glance which flashed with a delirious and unhealthy joy.  \"Listen!\" he cried. \"Again!\"  \"What?\" asked Kate.  \"I hear them, I tell you.\"  Her lips blanched, and parted to speak, but she checked the impulse and looked swiftly about the room with what seemed to Byrne an appeal for help. As for Buck Daniels, he changed from a dark bronze to an unhealthy yellow; fear, plain and grimly unmistakable, was in his face. Then he strode to the window and threw it open with a crash. The wind leaped in and tossed the flame in the throat of the chimney, so that great shadows waved suddenly through the room, and made the chairs seem afloat. Even the people were suddenly unreal. And the rush of the storm gave Byrne an eerie sensation of being blown through infinite space. For a moment there was only the sound of the gale and the flapping of a loose picture against the wall, and the rattling of a newspaper. Then he heard it.  First it was a single note which he could not place. It was music, and yet it was discordant, and it had the effect of a blast of icy wind.  Once he had been in Egypt and had stood in a corridor of Cheops'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],["title","The Night Horseman (#5)"],["body","amid. The torch had been blown out in the hand of his guide. From somewhere in the black depths before them came a laugh, made unhuman by echoes. And Byrne had visioned the mummied dead pushing back the granite lids of their sarcophagi and sitting upright.  But that was nothing compared with this. Not half so wild or strange.  He listened again, breathless, with the sharp prickling running up and down his spine. It was the honking of the wild geese, flying north. And out of the sound he builded a picture of the grey triangle cleaving through the cold upper sky, sent on a mission no man could understand.  \"Was I right? Was I right?\" shrilled the invalid, and when Byrne turned towards him, he saw the old man sitting erect, with an expression of wild triumph. There came an indescribable cry from the girl, and a deep throated curse from Buck Daniels as he slammed down the window.  With the chill blast shut off and the flame burning steadily once more in the lamp, a great silence besieged the room, with a note of expectancy in it. Byrne was conscious of being warm, too warm. It was close in the room, and he was weighted down. It was as if another presence had stepped into the room and stood invisible. He felt it with unspeakable keenness, as when one knows certainly the thoughts which pass in the mind of another. And, more than that, he knew that the others in the room felt what he felt. In the waiting silence he saw that the old man lay on his couch with eyes of fire and gaping lips, as if he drank the wine of his joyous expectancy. And big Buck Daniels stood with his hand on the sash of the window, frozen there, his eyes bulging, his heart thundering in his throat. And Kate Cumberland sat with her eyes closed, as she had closed them when the wind first rushed upon her, and she still smiled as she had smiled then. And to Byrne, more terrible than the joy of Joseph Cumberland or the dread of Buck Daniels was the smile and the closed eyes of the girl.  But the silence held and the fifth presence was in the room, and not one of them dared speak.     CHAPTER VI  THE MISSION STARTS   Then, with a shifting of the wind, a song was blown to them from the bunk-house, a cheerful, ringing chorus; the sound was like daylight--it drove the terror from the room. Joe Cumberland asked them to leave him. That night, he said, he would sleep. He felt it, like a promise. The other three went out from the room.  In the hall Kate and Daniels stood close together under a faint light from the wall-lamp, and they talked as if they had forgotten the presence of Byrne.  \"It had to come,\" she said. \"I knew it would come to him sooner or later, but I didn't dream it would be as terrible as this. Buck, what are we going to do?\"  \"God knows,\" said the big cowpuncher. \"Just wait, I s'pose, same as we've been doing.\"  He had aged wonderfully in that moment of darkness.  \"He'll be happy now for a few days,\" went on the girl, \"but afterwards--when he realises that it means nothing--what then, Buck?\"  The man took her hands and began to pat them softly as a father might soothe a child.  \"I seen you when the wind come in,\" he said gently. \"Are you going to stand it, Kate? Is it going to be hell for you, too, every time you hear 'em?\"  She answered: \"If it were only I! Yes, I could stand it. Lately I've begun to think that I can stand anything. But when I see Dad it breaks my heart--and you--oh, Buck, it hurts, it hurts!\" She drew his hands impulsively against her breast. \"If it were only something we could fight outright!\"  Buck Daniels sighed.  \"Fight?\" he echoed hopelessly. \"Fight? Against him? Kate, you're all tired out. Go to bed, honey, and try to stop thinkin'--and--God help us all!\"  She turned away from him and passed the doctor--blindly.  Buck Daniels had set his foot on the stairs when Byrne hurried after him and touched his arm; they went up together.  \"Mr. Daniels,\" said the doctor, \"it is necessary that I speak with you, alone. Will you come into my room for a few moments?\"  \"Doc,\" said the cattleman, \"I'm short on my feed and I don't feel a pile like talkin'. Can't you wait till the morning?\"  \"There has been a great deal too much waiting, Mr. Daniels,\" said the doctor. \"What I have to say to you must be said now. Will you come in?\"  \"I will,\" nodded Buck Daniels. \"But cut it short.\"  Once in his room the doctor lighted the lamp and then locked the door.  \"What's all the mystery and hush stuff?\" growled Daniels, and with a gesture he refused the proffered chair. \"Cut loose, doc, and make it short.\"  The little man sat down, removed his glasses, held them up to the light, found a speck upon them, polished it carefully away, replaced the spectacles upon his nose, and peered thoughtfully at Buck Daniels.  Buck Daniels rolled his eyes towards the door and then even towards the window, and then, as one who accepts the inevitable, he sank into a chair and plunged his hands into his pockets, prepared to endure.  \"I am called,\" went on the doctor dryly, \"to examine a case in which the patient is dangerously ill--in fact, hopelessly ill, and I have found that the cause of his illness is a state of nervous expectancy on the part of the sufferer. It being obviously necessary to know the nature of the disease and its cause before that cause may be removed, I have asked you to sit here this evening to give me whatever explanation you may have for it.\"  Buck Daniels stirred uneasily. At length he broke out: \"Doc, I size you up as a gent with brains. I got one piece of advice for you: get the hell away from the Cumberland Ranch and never come back again!\"  The doctor flushed and his lean jaw thrust out.  \"Although,\" he said, \"I cannot pretend to be classed among those to whom physical fear is an unknown, yet I wish to assure you, sir, that with me physical trepidation is not an overruling motive.\"  \"Oh, hell!\" groaned Buck Daniels. Then he explained more gently: \"I don't say you're yellow. All I say is: this mess ain't one that you can straighten out--nor no other man can. Give it up, wash your hands, and git back to Elkhead. I dunno what Kate was thinkin' of to bring you out here!\"  \"The excellence of your intention,\" said the doctor, \"I shall freely admit, though the assumption that difficulty in the essential problem would deter me from the analysis is an hypothesis which I cannot leave uncontested. In the vulgar, I may give you to understand that I am in this to stay!\"  Buck Daniels started to speak, but thinking better of it he shrugged his shoulders and sat back, resigned.  \"Well,\" he said, \"Kate brought you out here. Maybe she has a reason for it. What d'you want to know?\"  \"What connection,\" said the doctor, \"have wild geese with a man, a horse, and a dog?\"  \"What in hell d'you know about a horse and a man and a dog--and wild geese?\" inquired Buck in a strained voice.  \"Rumour,\" said the doctor, \"has been in this instance, unfortunately, my only teacher. But, sir, I have ascertained that Mr. Cumberland, his daughter, and you, sir, are all waiting for a certain thing to come to this ranch, and that thing I naturally assume to be a man.\"  \"Doc,\" said the cowpuncher sarcastically, \"there ain't no doubt you got a wonderful brain!\"  \"Mockery,\" pronounced the man of learning, \"is a use of the mental powers which is both unworthy and barren and does not in this case advance the argument, which is: Who and what is this man for whom you wait?\"  \"He came,\" said Buck Daniels, \"out of nowhere. That's all we know about who he is. What is he? I'll tell you easy: He's a gent that looks like a man, and walks like a man, and talks like a man--but he _ain't_ a man.\"  \"Ah,\" nodded the philosopher, \"a crime of extraordinary magnitude has, perhaps, cut off this unfortunate fellow from communication with others of his kind. Is this the case?\"  \"It ain't,\" replied Buck. \"Doc, tell me this: Can a wolf commit a crime?\"  \"Admitting this definition: that crime is the breaking of law, and that law is a force created by reason to control the rational, it may be granted that the acts of the lower animals lie outside of categories framed according to ethical precepts. To directly answer your not incurious question: I believe that a wolf cannot commit a crime.\"  Buck Daniels sighed.  \"D'you know, doc,\" he said gravely, \"that you remind me of a side-hill goat?\"  \"Ah,\" murmured the man of learning, \"is it possible? And what, Mr. Daniels, is the nature of a side-hill goat?\"  \"It's a goat that's got the legs of one side shorter than the legs on the other side, and the only way he can get to the top of a hill is to keep trottin' around and around the hill like a five per cent. grade. He goes a mile to get ten feet higher.\"  \"This fact,\" said Byrne, and he rubbed his chin thoughtfully, \"is not without interest, though I fail to perceive the relation between me and such a creature, unless, perhaps, there are biologic similarities of which I have at present no cognition.\"  \"I didn't think you'd follow me,\" replied Buck with an equal gravity. \"But you can lay to this, Doc; this gent we're waitin' for ain't committed any more crimes than a wolf has.\"  \"Ah, I see,\" murmured the doctor, \"a man so near the brute that his enormities pass beyond--\"  \"Get this straight,\" said Buck, interrupting with a sternly pointed finger: \"There ain't a kinder or a gentler man in the mountain-desert than him. He's got a voice softer than Kate Cumberland's, which is some soft voice, and as for his heart--Doc, I've seen him get off his horse to put a wounded rabbit out of its pain!\"  A ring of awe came in the throat of Daniels as he repeated the incredible fact.  He went on: \"If I was in trouble, I'd rather have him beside me than ten other men; if I was sick I'd rather have him than the ten best doctors in the world; if I wanted a pal that would die for them that done him good and go to hell to get them that done him bad, I'd choose him first, and there ain't none that come second.\"  The panegyric was"]]]
