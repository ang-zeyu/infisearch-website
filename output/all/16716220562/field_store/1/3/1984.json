Show him what a cheap batter he is.\"  Laughing, balancing a ball in his hands, Dick glided out on to the diamond.  \"Ready, Ted? Just see what you can do with one like this,\" Dick mocked.  It was a swift ball, but a straight one. To a batsman of Teall's skill it was not a difficult one to hit. Ted swung his bat and gave the ball a crack that sent it far out into outfield.  \"Is that the best you can do?\" jeered Ted.  \"Oh, I've one or two better than that,\" replied Dick, pretending to feel flustered.  Again Prescott sent in a swift one, and once more Teall sent the leather spinning over the field. Hoots and cat-calls from the Souths filled the air. The Central fans began to look a bit uneasy. What was their champion pitcher doing, to let Teall get away with his deliveries as easily as this?  A third ball Dick drove in, with the same result as before.  \"Say, what you fellows need is practice,\" leered Ted.  \"Look out that I don't catch you yet,\" mocked Dick Prescott, bending to scoop up the returning ball from the ground. Then he wheeled like a flash to confront the batsman.  This time, by a quick substitution, Dick held the home-made ball. He twirled it for an instant, then sent it in toward the plate.  \"Just---as---easy!\" scoffed Ted, whirling his bat, then reaching out for the ball.  Crack! Teall hit it soundly.  Bang! With such force had the batsman struck that he exploded the large torpedo inside the home-made ball. There was a rattling explosion, and Teall, unable to figure, in that first instant, what had happened, sent the bat flying.  \"Ow-ow-ow!\" yelled startled Ted, leaping up into the air. When he alighted he ran a dozen or more steps as fast as he could go, then halted and looked around him. For an instant Teall's face expressed panic.  Then mocking laughter from hundreds of throats greeted him.  \"I knew any little thing out of the ordinary would rattle you,\" smiled Dick. \"Don't lose your nerve. It wasn't anything.\"  \"Just a fresh idiot's attempt to be funny!\" growled Teall, his face now red with mortification.  \"Laugh, Ted, confound you!\" urged Tom Reade. \"Laugh! Don't be a grouch.\"  \"What you need, Teall,\" teased Dave Darrin, \"is some nerve tonic. You ought not to let yourself get into such bad shape that you almost faint when you hit the ball.\"  For once Ted Teall's ready tongue went back on him. He could think of nothing to say that would not make him look still more ridiculous.  \"I guess he'll be good, for one game at least,\" grimaced Dick as he turned to his teammates.     Chapter VII  TED TEALL FACES THE STORM   The game had gone into the third inning, with the Centrals retired from the bat and the Souths now in from the field.  In the second inning Greg, backed splendidly by Tom and Dick, had scored a run for his side---the only run listed as yet.  In this third inning, with South Grammar now at the bat, two men were out, and one on second when Ted Teall stepped to the plate.  \"Put a real slam over on 'em, Ted!\" shouted a South fan.  \"Drive a ball over into Stayton and then fill up the score card while the Centrals are looking for it!\" advised another Teall partisan.  \"Centrals?\" jeered another boy from the South. Grammar. \"Centrals? Show 'em they're just plain hello-girls!\"  Ted grinned broadly at this \"hello-girls\" nickname. Just then another fan from the southern part of Gridley piped up:  \"Ted, eat 'em. They're only nine pieces of blue cheese!\"  That was going too far, and it was time for Central Grammar to take notice effectively.  \"Bang!\" roared one half of the Central fans.  \"Ow-ow-ow!\" yelled the other half of the Central boosters, leaping up into the air.  Even Ted Teall had to laugh at this mortifying reminder of his terror when he had struck the torpedo ball. The next instant his face went deep red, for everyone on the field appeared to be laughing and jeering at him.  \"Confound Prescott and his tricks!\" muttered Teall under his breath. \"It'll take a lot of thinking for me to get even with that trick.\"  Whizz-zz! went the ball by Ted's body, just below shoulder-high.  \"Strike one!\" called the umpire sharply.  \"Centrals will get me rattled with that bang-ow-ow! of theirs every time they spring it on me,\" thought Ted savagely.  \"Strike two!\"  Again Ted had failed to realize that the ball was coming. In his anger be wondered whether he'd rather throw his bat at the umpire or at smiling Dick Prescott.  \"Strike three!\" called the umpire's steady voice. \"Side out.\"  Then Ted, in sheer exasperation, did hurl his bat a score of feet away.  \"Bang!\" came in a volley of Central voices.  \"Ow-ow-ow!\" wailed the other half of Old Dut's boys while the North Grammars joined in.  \"Go it, you boobs!\" muttered Ted, shaking his fist at the spectators.  \"Hurrah!\" cheered Spoff Henderson from the subs' bench. \"We know how to stop Ted Teall's mouth now!\"  Teall happened to hear the remark.  \"Oh, you fellows are a lot of boobies!\" sputtered Ted wrathfully.  \"Anyway,\" Toby Ross leered back at him, \"we're not so young that we yell when we hit a ball by mistake.\"  In the fourth and fifth innings the Central Grammars, though they booked some base hits, did not succeed in getting any runs through. However, they succeeded in preventing Teall's nine from scoring, which kept the score still at one to nothing. In the first half of the sixth Harry Hazelton was brought home from third by a good one by Dan. Then the side went out. In this inning Teall again had a chance at bat. Before batting he stalked over to where a lot of his schoolfellows were grouped and muttered:  \"Don't you fellows shoot any funny remarks in this inning. Keep quiet.\"  \"Huh!\" shot out one of the boys. \"What's the matter with you, Ted?\"  \"No matter. But I don't want any funny line of talk steered over to the Centrals to-day.\"  \"Seems to me you've changed a lot, Ted,\" grinned one of his classmates. \"Yesterday afternoon you put us up to a lot of funny things to holler to-day.\"  \"Forget 'em,\" ordered Ted.  \"Dick Prescott certainly stabbed you with that torpedo,\" grinned another South. \"Ted, your nerve is gone for to-day.\"  \"Don't get too funny with me, or I'll see you after the game,\" threatened Teall, as he stalked away, for he was now on deck, and due to go next to bat.  The second man for the Souths struck out.  \"Teall at bat!\" called the score-keeper.  Hi Martin and a lot of the North Grammar boys had come to the field late. Hi didn't like to see the score two to nothing in favor of the Centrals. He would have preferred to have the Souths win.  \"Let's get Prescott rattled?\" whispered Martin.  \"I don't believe you can do it,\" replied Bill Rodgers. \"Prescott is a mighty cool one.\"  \"Yes, we can,\" insisted Hi. \"I'll tell you what to boiler just the instant that Teall picks up the stick and Prescott starts to twist the ball.\"  Ted, all unsuspicious, and believing that he had stilled his own band of teasing torments, picked up his bat and went to the plate.  \"Put it over the robbers, Ted!\" came from Hi Martin's crowd. \"Don't be afraid of the Centrals---the fellows who stole their uniforms from a lunatic in the woods.\"  Dick heard the senseless taunt and understood it. But it didn't anger or confuse him. Instead, the ball left his hand with surer guidance.  But a crowd of Central fans also heard, and imagined that the yell came from one of the groups of Souths.  \"Bang! bang!\" yelled a lot of Central Grammar boys with enthusiasm.  \"Ow-ow-ow! Ow-ow-ow!\" came the response.  \"Strike one!\" called the umpire. Ted, his face crimson and his eyes flashing fire, threw his bat from him.  \"Teall, pick up your bat,\" ordered the umpire. \"If you do that again I'll order you from the game.\"  \"I don't care if you do!\" trembled on Ted's lips, but he caught the words in time. He gulped, swallowed hard, hesitated, then went tremulously to pick up his stick. However, his grit was gone for the day. He struck out and retired.  \"Ow-ow-ow!\" yelled a few of the Central fans in the eighth, and Dave Darrin struck a two bagger, bringing Prescott in safe from second, scoring a third run and landing Darrin on second. Had not Ross struck out immediately afterward there would have been other runs scored. The count was now three to nothing in favor of the Central Grammars.  \"Prescott's fellows are playing some ball,\" declared Bill Rodgers.  \"Hub! You mean that the Souths don't know how to play,\" sneered Hi Martin.  \"Teall's fellows are playing well,\" argued Rodgers. \"If you watch, you'll see that the luck of the Centrals depends a lot on the way they run the bases. Whew! They go like greased lightning when they're sprinting around the diamond.\"  \"Well, why shouldn't they run?\" demanded Hi. \"Prescott and his fellows have been running every day since the snow went away.\"  \"I wish our Norths had been running all the time, too,\" sighed Bill.  The Souths were playing desperately well in the field. Dick's side came in for the ninth, but did not succeed in getting another run.  \"Now, watch 'em closely, fellows,\" counseled Dick, as, from the benches, he started his men out to the field. \"The Souths are mad and game, and they may get runs enough in this last half to beat us. Play, all the time, as if you didn't know what it was to be tired. Keep after 'em!\"  Dick struck the first South Grammar fellow out. The next man at bat took first on called balls. The next hit a light fly that was good for a base. The player who followed sent a bunt that Dave, as short-stop, fumbled. And now the bases were full.  \"Oh, you Ted!\" wailed the South fans hopefully. \"Do your duty now, Teall!\"  Ted gripped the bat, stepping forward. As he reached the plate he shot at his schoolmates a look of grim resolution.  \"I'll bring those three fellows in, if I have to kill the ball, or drive it through a fielder!\" muttered Ted resolutely. \"If we can tie the score then we can break this fearful hoodoo and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12741"],["title","Risen from the Ranks; Or, Harry Walton's Success (#0)"],["body","FROM THE RANKS,  OR,  HARRY WALTON'S SUCCESS.

BARRY,  of the  BOSTON BAR,  THIS VOLUME  INSCRIBED WITH FRIENDLY REGARD     PREFACE.  \"Risen from the Ranks\" contains the further history of Harry Walton, who was first introduced to the public in the pages of \"Bound to Rise.\"  Those who are interested in learning how far he made good the promise of his boyhood, may here find their curiosity gratified. For the benefit of those who may only read the present volume, a synopsis of Harry's previous life is given in the first chapter.  In describing Harry's rise from the ranks I have studiously avoided the extraordinary incidents and pieces of good luck, which the story writer has always at command, being desirous of presenting my hero's career as one which may be imitated by the thousands of boys similarly placed, who, like him, are anxious to rise from the ranks.  It is my hope that this story, suggested in part by the career of an eminent American editor, may afford encouragement to such boys, and teach them that \"where there is a will there is always a way.\"  New York, October 1874.     RISEN FROM THE RANKS;  OR,  HARRY WALTON'S SUCCESS.   CHAPTER I.  HARRY WALTON.  \"I am sorry to part with you, Harry,\" said Professor Henderson.  \"You have been a very satisfactory and efficient assistant, and I shall miss you.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Harry.  \"I have tried to be faithful to your interests.\"  \"You have been so,\" said the Professor emphatically.  \"I have had perfect confidence in you, and this has relieved me of a great deal of anxiety.  It would have been very easy for one in your position to cheat me out of a considerable sum of money.\"  \"It was no credit to me to resist such a temptation as that,\" said Harry.  \"I am glad to hear you say so, but it shows your inexperience nevertheless.  Money is the great tempter nowadays.  Consider how many defalcations and breaches of trust we read of daily in confidential positions, and we are forced to conclude that honesty is a rarer virtue than we like to think it.  I have every reason to believe that my assistant last winter purloined, at the least, a hundred dollars, but I was unable to prove it, and submitted to the loss.  It may be the same next winter.  Can't I induce you to change your resolution, and remain in my employ?  I will advance your pay.\"  \"Thank you, Professor Henderson,\" said Harry gratefully.  \"I appreciate your offer, even if I do not accept it.  But I have made up mind to learn the printing business.\"  \"You are to enter the office of the 'Centreville Gazette,' I believe.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How much pay will you get?\"  \"I shall receive my board the first month, and for the next six months have agreed to take two dollars a week and board.\"  \"That won't pay your expenses.\"  \"It must,\" said Harry, firmly.  \"You have laid up some money while with me, haven't you!\"  \"Yes, sir; I have fifty dollars in my pocket-book, besides having given eighty dollars at home.\"  \"That is doing well, but you won't be able to lay up anything for the next year.\"  \"Perhaps not in money, but I shall be gaining the knowledge of a good trade.\"  \"And you like that better than remaining with me, and learning my business?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, perhaps you are right.  I don't fancy being a magician myself; but I am too old to change.  I like moving round, and I make a good living for my family.  Besides I contribute to the innocent amusement of the public, and earn my money fairly.\"  \"I agree with you, sir,\" said Harry.  \"I think yours is a useful employment, but it would not suit everybody.  Ever since I read the life of Benjamin Franklin, I have wanted to learn to be a printer.\"  \"It is an excellent business, no doubt, and if you have made up your mind I will not dissuade you.  When you have a paper of your own, you can give your old friend, Professor Henderson, an occasional puff.\"  \"I shall be glad to do that,\" said Harry, smiling, \"but I shall have to wait some time first.\"  \"How old are you now?\"  \"Sixteen.\"  \"Then you may qualify yourself for an editor in five or six years.  I advise you to try it at any rate.  The editor in America is a man of influence.\"  \"I do look forward to it,\" said Harry, seriously.  \"I should not be satisfied to remain a journeyman all my life, nor even the half of it.\"  \"I sympathize with your ambition, Harry,\" said the Professor, earnestly, \"and I wish you the best success.  Let me hear from you occasionally.\"  \"I should be very glad to write you, sir.\"  \"I see the stage is at the door, and I must bid you good-by.  When you have a vacation, if you get a chance to come our way, Mrs. Henderson and myself will be glad to receive a visit from you. Good-by!\" And with a hearty shake of the hand, Professor Henderson bade farewell to his late assistant.  Those who have read \"Bound to Rise,\" and are thus familiar with Harry Walton's early history, will need no explanation of the preceding conversation.  But for the benefit of new readers, I will recapitulate briefly the leading events in the history of the boy of sixteen who is to be our hero.  Harry Walton was the oldest son of a poor New Hampshire farmer, who found great difficulty is wresting from his few sterile acres a living for his family.  Nearly a year before, he had lost his only cow by a prevalent disease, and being without money, was compelled to buy another of Squire Green, a rich but mean neighbor, on a six months' note, on very unfavorable terms.  As it required great economy to make both ends meet, there seemed no possible chance of his being able to meet the note at maturity.  Beside, Mr. Walton was to forfeit ten dollars if he did not have the principal and interest ready for Squire Green.   The hard-hearted creditor was mean enough to take advantage of his poor neighbor's necessities, and there was not the slightest chance of his receding from his unreasonable demand.  Under these circumstances Harry, the oldest boy, asked his father's permission to go out into the world and earn his own living. He hoped not only to do this, but to save something toward paying his father's note.  His ambition had been kindled by reading the life of Benjamin Franklin, which had been awarded to him as a school prize. He did not expect to emulate Franklin, but he thought that by imitating him he might attain an honorable position in the community.  Harry's request was not at first favorably received.  To send a boy out into the world to earn his own living is a hazardous experiment, and fathers are less sanguine than their sons.  Their experience suggests difficulties and obstacles of which the inexperienced youth knows and possesses nothing.  But in the present case Mr. Walton reflected that the little farming town in which he lived offered small inducements for a boy to remain there, unless he was content to be a farmer, and this required capital.  His farm was too small for himself, and of course he could not give Harry a part when be came of age.  On the whole, therefore, Harry's plan of becoming a mechanic seemed not so bad a one after all.  So permission was accorded, and our hero, with his little bundle of clothes, left the paternal roof, and went out in quest of employment.  After some adventures Harry obtained employment in a shoe-shop as pegger.  A few weeks sufficed to make him a good workman, and he was then able to earn three dollars a week and board.  Out of this sum be hoped to save enough to pay the note held by Squire Green against his father, but there were two unforeseen obstacles.  He had the misfortune to lose his pocket-book, which was picked up by an unprincipled young man, by name Luke Harrison, also a shoemaker, who was always in pecuniary difficulties, though he earned much higher wages than Harry.  Luke was unable to resist the temptation, and appropriated the money to his own use.  This Harry ascertained after a while, but thus far had succeeded in obtaining the restitution of but a small portion of his hard-earned savings.  The second obstacle was a sudden depression in the shoe trade which threw him out of work.  More than most occupations the shoe business is liable to these sudden fluctuations and suspensions, and the most industrious and ambitious workman is often compelled to spend in his enforced weeks of idleness all that he had been able to save when employed, and thus at the end of the year finds himself, through no fault of his own, no better off than at the beginning.  Finding himself out of work, our hero visited other shoe establishments in the hope of employment.  But his search was in vain.  Chance in this emergency made him acquainted with Professor Henderson, a well-known magician and conjurer, whose custom it was to travel, through the fall and winter, from town to town, giving public exhibitions of his skill. He was in want of an assistant, to sell tickets and help him generally, and he offered the position to our hero, at a salary of five dollars a week.  It is needless to say that the position was gladly accepted.  It was not the business that Harry preferred, but he reasoned justly that it was honorable, and was far better than remaining idle.  He found Professor Henderson as he called himself, a considerate and agreeable employer, and as may be inferred from the conversation with which this chapter begins, his services were very satisfactory.  At the close of the six months, he had the satisfaction of paying the note which his father had given, and so of disappointing the selfish schemes of the grasping creditor.  This was not all.  He met with an adventure while travelling for the Professor, in which a highwayman who undertook to rob him, came off second best, and he was thus enabled to add fifty dollars to his savings.  His financial condition at the opening of the present story has already been set forth.  Though I "]]]
