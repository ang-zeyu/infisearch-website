Anne had, however, been the pet of her father's old friends, the sea captains, had played with the little Evelyns under the yew hedges of Says Court, had been taken to London to behold the Lord Mayor's show and more than one Court pageant, had been sometimes at the palaces as the plaything of the Ladies Mary and Anne of York, had been more than once kissed by their father, the Duke, and called a pretty little poppet, and had even shared with them a notable game at romps with their good-natured uncle the King, when she had actually caught him at Blind-man's-buff!  Ignorant as she was of evil, her old surroundings appeared to her delightful, and Peregrine, bred in a Puritan home, was at fourteen not much more advanced than she was in the meaning of the vices and corruptions that he heard inveighed against in general or scriptural terms at home, and was only too ready to believe that all that his father proscribed must be enchanting.  Thus they built castles together about brilliant lives at a Court of which they knew as little as of that at Timbuctoo.  There was another Court, however, of which Peregrine seemed to know all the details, namely, that of King Oberon and Queen Mab.  How much was village lore picked up from Moll Owens and her kind, or how much was the work of his own imagination, no one could tell, probably not himself, certainly not Anne.  When he appeared on intimate terms with Hip, Nip, and Skip, and described catching Daddy Long Legs to make a fence with his legs, or dwelt upon a terrible fight between two armies of elves mounted on grasshoppers and crickets, and armed with lances tipped with stings of bees and wasps, she would exclaim, \"Is it true, Perry?\" and he would wink his green eye and look at her with his yellow one till she hardly knew where she was.  He would tell of his putting a hornet in a sluttish maid's shoe, which was credible, if scarcely meriting that elfish laughter which made his auditor shrink, but when he told of dancing over the mud banks with a lantern, like a Will-of-the-wisp, till he lured boats to get stranded, or horsemen to get stuck, in the hopeless mud, Anne never questioned the possibility, but listened with wide open eyes, and a restrained shudder, feeling as if under a spell.  That mysterious childish feeling which dreads even what common sense forbids the calmer mind to believe, made her credit Peregrine, for the time at least, with strange affinities to the underground folk, and kept her under a strange fascination, half attraction, half repulsion, which made her feel as if she must obey and follow him if he turned those eyes on her, whether she were willing or not.  Nor did she ever tell her mother of these conversations.  She had been rebuked once for repeating nurse's story of the changeling, and again for her shrinking from him; and this was quite enough in an essentially reserved, as well as proud and sensitive, nature, to prevent further confidences on a subject which she knew would be treated as a foolish fancy, bringing both herself and her companion into trouble.    CHAPTER V: PEREGRINE'S HOME   \"For, at a word, be it understood, He was always for ill and never for good.\"  SCOTT.  A week had passed since any of the family from Oakwood had come to make inquiries after the convalescent at Portchester, when Dr. Woodford mounted his sleek, sober-paced pad, and accompanied by a groom, rode over to make his report and tender his counsel to Major Oakshott.  He arrived just as the great bell was clanging to summon the family to the mid-day meal, since he had reckoned on the Squire being more amenable as a 'full man,' especially towards a guest, and he was well aware that the Major was thoroughly a gentleman in behaviour even to those with whom he differed in politics and religion.  Accordingly there was a ready welcome at the door of the old red house, which was somewhat gloomy looking, being on the north side of the hill, and a good deal stifled with trees.  In a brief interval the Doctor found himself seated beside the pale languid lady at the head of the long table, placed in a large hall, wainscotted with the blackest of oak, which seemed to absorb into itself all the light from the windows, large enough indeed but heavily mullioned, and with almost as much of leading as of octagons and lozenges--greenish glass--in them, while the coats of arms, repeated in upper portions and at the intersections of beams and rafters, were not more cheerful, being sable chevrons on an argent field.  The crest, a horse shoe, was indeed azure, but the blue of this and of the coats of the serving-men only deepened the thunderous effect of the black. Strangely, however, among these sad-coloured men there moved a figure entirely differently.  A negro, white turbaned, and with his blue livery of a lighter shade, of fantastic make and relieved by a great deal of white and shining silver, so as to have an entirely different effect.  He placed himself behind the chair of Dr. Woodford's opposite neighbour, a shrewd business-like looking gentleman, soberly but handsomely dressed, with a certain foreign cut about his clothes, and a cravat of rich Flemish lace.  He was presented to the Doctor as Major Oakshott's brother, Sir Peregrine.  The rest of the party consisted of Oliver and Robert, sturdy, ruddy lads of fifteen and twelve, and their tutor, Mr. Horncastle, an elderly man, who twenty years before had resigned his living because he could not bring himself to accept all the Liturgy.  While Sir Peregrine courteously relieved his sister-in-law of the trouble of carving the gammon of bacon which accompanied the veal which her husband was helping, Dr. Woodford informed her of her son's progress towards recovery.  \"Ah,\" she said, \"I knew you had come to tell us that he is ready to be brought home;\" and her tone was fretful.  \"We are greatly beholden to you, sir,\" said the Major from the bottom of the table.  \"The boy shall be fetched home immediately.\"  \"Not so, sir, as yet, I beg of you.  Neither his head nor his side can brook the journey for at least another week, and indeed my good sister Woodford will hardly know how to part with her patient.\"  \"She will not long be of that mind after Master Perry gets to his feet again,\" muttered the chaplain.  \"Indeed no,\" chimed in the mother.  \"There will be no more peace in the house when he is come back.\"  \"I assure you, madam,\" said Dr. Woodford, \"that he has been a very good child, grateful and obedient, nor have I heard any complaints.\"  \"Your kindness, or else that of Mrs. Woodford, carries you far, sir,\" answered his host.  \"What?  Is my nephew and namesake so peevish a scapegrace?\" demanded the visitor.  On which anecdotes broke forth from all quarters.  Peregrine had greased the already slippery oak stairs, had exchanged Oliver's careful exercise for a ribald broadsheet, had filled Mr. Horncastle's pipe with gunpowder, and mixed snuff with the chocolate specially prepared for the peculiar godly guest Dame Priscilla Waller.  Every one had something to adduce, even the serving-men behind the chairs; and if Oliver and Robert did not add their quota, it was because absolute silence at meals was the rule for nonage. However, the subject was evidently distasteful to the father, who changed the conversation by asking his brother questions about the young Prince of Orange and the Grand Pensionary De Witt.  For the gentleman had been acting as English attache to the Embassy at the Hague, whence he had come on affairs of State to London, and after being knighted by Charles, had newly arrived at the old home, which he had scarcely seen since his brother's marriage.  Dr. Woodford enjoyed his conversation, and his information on foreign politics, and the Major, though now and then protesting, was evidently proud of his brother.  When grace had been pronounced by the chaplain the lady withdrew to her parlour, the two boys, each with an obeisance and request for permission, departed for an hour's recreation, and Dr. Woodford intimated that he wished for some conversation with his host respecting the boy Peregrine.  \"Let us discuss it here,\" said Major Oakshott, turning towards a small table set in the deep bay window, and garnished with wine, fruit, and long slender glasses.  \"Good Mr. Horncastle,\" he added, as he motioned his guest to one of the four seats, \"is with me in all that concerns my children, and I desire my brother's counsel respecting the untoward lad with whom it has pleased Heaven to afflict me.\"  When the glasses had been filled with claret Dr. Woodford uttered a diplomatic compliment on the healthful and robust appearance of the eldest and youngest sons, and asked whether any cause had been assigned for the difference between them and the intermediate brother.  \"None, sir,\" returned the father with a sigh, \"save the will of the Almighty to visit us for our sins with a son who has thus far shown himself one of the marred vessels doomed to be broken by the potter. It may be in order to humble me and prove me that this hath been laid upon me.\"  The "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12449"],["title","A Reputed Changeling; Or, Three Seventh Years Two Centuries Ago (#8)"],["body","groaned acquiescence, but there was vexation in the brother's face.  \"Sir,\" said the Doctor, \"it is my opinion and that of my sister-in- law, an excellent, discreet, and devout woman, that the poor child would give you more cause for hope if the belief had not become fixed in his mind that he is really and truly a fairy elf--yes, in very sooth--a changeling!\"  All the auditors broke out into exclamations that it was impossible that a boy of fourteen could entertain so absurd an idea, and the tutor evidently thought it a fresh proof of depravity that he should thus have tried to deceive his kind hosts.  In proof that Peregrine veritably believed it himself, Dr. Woodford related what he had witnessed on Midsummer night, mentioning how in delirium the boy had evidently believed himself in fairyland, and how disappointed he had been, on regaining his senses, to find himself on common earth; telling also of the adventure with the King, which Sir Christopher Wren had described to him, but of which Major Oakshott was unaware, though it explained the offer of the pageship.  He was a good deal struck by these revelations, proving misery that he had never suspected, though, as he said, he had often pleaded, \"Why will ye revolt more and more? ye _will_ be stricken more and more.\"  \"Have you ever sought his confidence?\" asked the travelled brother, a question evidently scarcely understood, for the reply was, \"I have always required of my sons to speak the truth, nor have they failed of late years save this unfortunate Peregrine.\"  \"And,\" said Sir Peregrine, \"if the unlucky lad actually supposes himself to be no human being, admonitions and chastisements would naturally be vain.\"  \"I cannot believe it,\" exclaimed the Major.  \"'Tis true, as I now remember, I once came on a couple of beldames, my wife's nurse and another, who has since been ducked for witchcraft, and found them about to flog the babe with nettles, and lay him in the thorn hedge because he was a sickly child, whom, forsooth, they took to be a changeling; but I forbade the profane folly to be ever again mentioned in my household, nor did I ever hear thereof again.\"  \"There are a good many more things mentioned in a household, brother, than the master is wont to hear of,\" remarked Sir Peregrine.  Dr. Woodford then begged as a personal favour for an individual examination of the family and servants on their opinion.  The master was reluctant thus, as he expressed it, to go a-fooling, but his brother backed the Doctor up, and further prevented a general assembly to put one another to shame, but insisted on the witnesses being called in one by one.  Oliver, the first summoned, was beginning to be somewhat less overawed by his father than in his earlier boyhood.  To the inquiry what he thought of his brother Peregrine, he made a tentative sort of reply, that he was a strange fellow, who never could keep out of disgrace.  \"That is not the question,\" said his father.  \"I am almost ashamed to speak it!  Do you--nay, have you ever supposed him to be a--\" he really could not bring out the word.  \"A changeling, sir?\" returned Oliver.  \"I do not believe so now, knowing that it is impossible, but as a child I always did.\"  \"Who durst possess you with so foolish and profane a falsehood?\"  \"Every one, sir.  I cannot recollect the time when I did not as entirely deem Peregrine a changeling elf as that Robin was my own brother.  He believes so himself.\"  \"You have never striven to disabuse him.\"  \"Indeed, sir, he would scarce have listened to me had I done go; besides, to tell the truth, it has only been of late, since I have been older, and have studied more, that I have come to perceive the folly of it.\"  Major Oakshott groaned, and bade him call Robert without saying wherefore.  The little fellow came in, somewhat frightened, and when asked the question that had been put to his elder, his face lighted up, and he exclaimed, \"Oh, have they brought him back again?\"  \"Whom?\"  \"Our real brother, sir, who was carried off to fairyland!\"  \"Who told you so, Robert?\"  He looked puzzled, and said, \"Sir, they all know it.  Molly Owens, that was his foster-mother, saw the fairies bear him off on a broomstick up the chimney.\"  \"Robert, no lying!\"  The boy was only restrained from tears by fear of his father, and just managed to say, \"'Tis what they all say, and Perry knows.\"  \"Knows!\" muttered Major Oakshott in despair, but the uncle, drawing Robin towards him, extracted that Perry had been seen flying out of the loft window, when he had been locked up--Robin had never seen it himself, but the maids had often done so.  Moreover, there was proof positive, in the mark on Oliver's head, where he had nearly killed himself by tumbling downstairs, being lured by the fairies while they stole away the babe.  The Major could not listen with patience.  \"A boy of that age to repeat such blasphemous nonsense!\" he exclaimed; and Robert, restraining with difficulty his sobs of terror, was dismissed to fetch the butler.  The old Ironside who now appeared would not avouch his own disbelief in the identity of Master Peregrine, being, as he said, a man who had studied his Bible, listened to godly preachers, and seen the world; but he had no hesitation in declaring that almost every other soul in the household believed in it as firmly as in the Gospel, certainly all the women, and probably all the men, nor was there any doubt that the young gentleman conducted himself more like a goblin than the son of pious Christian parents.  In effect both the clergyman and the Diplomate could not help suspecting that in other company the worthy butler's disavowal of all share in the superstition might have been less absolute.  \"After this,\" said Major Oakshott with a sigh, \"it seems useless to carry the inquiry farther.\"  \"What says my sister Oakshott?\" inquired Sir Peregrine.  \"She!  Poor soul, she is too feeble to be fretted,\" said her husband.  \"She has never been the same woman since the Fire of London, and it would be vain to vex her with questions.  She would be of one mind while I spoke to her, and another while her women were pouring their tales into her ear.  Methinks I now understand why she has always seemed to shrink from this unfortunate child, and to fear rather than love him.\"  \"Even so, sir,\" added the tutor.  \"Much is explained that I never before understood.  The question is how to deal with him under this fresh light.  I will, so please your honour, assemble the family this very night, and expound to them that such superstitions are contrary to the very word of Scripture.\"  \"Much good will that do,\" muttered the knight.  \"I should humbly suggest,\" put in Dr. Woodford, \"that the best hope for the poor lad would be to place him where these foolish tales were unknown, and he could start afresh on the same terms with other youths.\"  \"There is no school in accordance with my principles,\" said the Squire gloomily.  \"Godly men who hold the faith as I do are inhibited by the powers that be from teaching in schools.\"  \"And,\" said his brother, \"you hold these principles as more important than the causing your son to be bred up a human being instead of being pointed at and rendered hopeless as a demon.\"  \"I am bound to do so,\" said the Major.  \"Surely,\" said Dr. Woodford, \"some scholar might be found, either here or in Holland, who might share your opinions, and could receive the boy without incurring penalties for opening a school without license.\"  \"It is a matter for prayer and consideration,\" said Major Oakshott. \"Meantime, reverend sir, I thank you most heartily for the goodness with which you have treated my untoward son, and likewise for having opened my eyes to the root of his freakishness.\"  The Doctor understood this as dismissal, and asked for his horse, intimating, however, that he would gladly keep the boy till some arrangement had been decided upon.  Then he rode home to tell his sister-in-law that he had done his best, and that he thought it a fortunate conjunction that the travelled brother had been present.    CHAPTER VI: A RELAPSE   \"A tell-tale in their company    They never could endure, And whoso kept not secretly    Their pranks was punished sure. It was a just and Christian deed    To pinch such black and blue; Oh, how the commonwealth doth need    Such justices as you!\"  BISHOP CORBETT.  Several days passed, during which there could be no doubt that Peregrine Oakshott knew how to behave himself, not merely to grown- up people, but to little Anne, who had entirely lost her dread of him, and accepted him as a playfellow.  He was able to join the family meals, and sit in the pleasant garden, shaded by the walls of the old castle, as well as by its own apple-trees, and looking out on the little bay in front, at full tide as smooth and shining as a lake.  There, while Anne did her task of spinning or of white seam, Mrs. Woodford would tell the children stories, or read to them from the Pilgrim's Progress, a wonderful romance to both.  Peregrine, still tamed by weakness, would lie on the grass at her feet, in a tranquil bliss such as he had never known before, and his fairy romances to Anne were becoming mitigated, when one day a big coach came along the road from Fareham, with two boys riding beside it, escorting Lady Archfield and Mistress Lucy.  The lady was come to study Mrs. Woodford's recipe for preserved cherries, the young people, Charles, Lucy, and their cousin Sedley, now at home for the summer holidays, to spend an afternoon with Mistress Anne.  Great was Lady Archfield's surprise at finding that Major Oakshott's cross-grained slip of a boy was still at Portchester.  \"If you were forced to take him in for very charity when he was hurt,\" she said, \"I should have thought you would have been rid of him as soon as he could leave his bed.\"  \"The road to Oakwood is too rough for broken ribs as yet,\" said Mrs. Woodford, \"nor is the poor boy ready for discipline.\"  \"Ay, I fancy"]]]
