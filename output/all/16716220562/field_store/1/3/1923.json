HAYES  AUTHOR OF \"The Boy Allies On the Firing Line\" \"The Boy Allies With the Cossacks\" \"The Boy Allies In the Trenches\"  1915        CHAPTER I.  THE TWO COMRADES.   \"War has been declared, mother!\" shouted Hal, as closely followed by his friend, Chester Crawford, he dashed into the great hotel in Berlin, where the three were stopping, and made his way through the crowd that thronged the lobby to his mother's side.  \"Yes, mother, it's true,\" continued Hal, seeing the look of consternation on Mrs. Paine's face. \"The Kaiser has declared war upon France!\"  Mrs. Paine, who had risen to her feet at her son's entrance, put her hand upon the back of her chair to steady herself, and her face grew pale.  \"Can it be?\" she said slowly. \"After all these years, can it be possible that millions of men will again fly at each other's throats? Is it possible that Europe will again be turned into a battlefield?\"  Overcome by her feelings, Mrs. Paine sank slowly into her chair. Hal and Chester sprang to her side.  \"It's all right, mother,\" cried Hal, dropping to his knees and putting his arm about her. \"We are in no danger. No one will harm an American. At this crisis a citizen of the United States will not be molested.\"  Mrs. Paine smiled faintly.  \"It was not of that I was thinking, my son,\" she said. \"Your words brought back to me the days gone by, and I pray that I shall not have to go through them again. Then, too, I was thinking of the mothers and wives whose hearts will be torn by the news you have just told me. But come,\" and Mrs. Paine shook off her memories, \"tell me all about it.\"  \"As you know, Mrs. Paine,\" spoke up Chester, who up to this time had remained silent, \"Hal and I went to the American Embassy immediately after dinner to-night to learn, if possible, what difficulties we were likely to encounter in leaving Germany. Since the Kaiser's declaration of war against Russia all Americans have been preparing to get out of the country at the earliest possible moment. But now that war has been declared on France, we are likely to encounter many hardships.\"  \"Is there any likelihood of our being detained?\" asked Mrs. Paine in alarm. \"What did the ambassador say?\"  \"While the ambassador anticipates no danger for foreigners, he advises that we leave the country immediately. He suggests that we take the early morning train across the Belgian frontier.\"  \"Why go to Belgium?\"  \"All railroad lines leading into France have been seized by German soldiers. Passenger traffic has been cut off, mother,\" explained Hal. \"All trains are being used for the movement of troops.\"  \"Yes, Mrs. Paine,\" continued Chester, \"we shall have to go through Belgium. Even now thousands of the Kaiser's best troops are marching upon the French frontier, and fighting is only a question of hours.\"  \"Very well, then,\" returned Mrs. Paine. \"We shall go in the morning. So I guess we would all better go upstairs and pack. Come along, boys.\"  While the packing is going on, it is a good time to describe the two American lads, who will play the most important parts in our story.  Hal Paine was a lad some seventeen years of age. Following his graduation from high school in a large Illinois city the previous June, his mother had announced her intention of taking him on a tour through Europe. Needless to say, Hal jumped at this chance to see something of the foreign countries in whose histories he had always been deeply interested. It was upon Hal's request that Mrs. Paine had invited his chum, Chester Crawford, to accompany them.  Chester was naturally eager to take the trip across the water, and, after some coaxing, in which Mrs. Paine's influence also was brought to bear, his parents finally agreed to their son's going so far away from home.  Hal's father was dead. A colonel of infantry, he was killed leading a charge at the battle of El Caney, in the Spanish-American war. Hal's grandfather died of a bayonet wound in the last days of the Civil War.  But, if Hal's father's family was a family of fighters, so was that of his mother. Her father, a Virginian, was killed at the head of his men while leading one of Pickett's regiments in the famous charge at Gettysburg. Three of her brothers also had been killed on the field of battle, and another had died in prison.  From her own mother Mrs. Paine had learned of the horrors of war. Before the war her father had been a wealthy man. After the war her mother was almost in poverty. While too young then to remember these things herself, Mrs. Paine knew what havoc had been wrought in the land of her birth by the invasion of armed men, and it is not to be wondered at that, in view of the events narrated, she should view the coming struggle with anguish, despite the fact that her own country was not involved and that there was no reason why her loved ones should be called upon to take up arms.  Chester's father was a prominent and wealthy lumberman, and Chester, although nearly a year younger than Hal, had graduated in the same class with his comrade. The two families lived next door to each other, and the lads had always been the closest of chums.  For the last three years the boys had spent each summer vacation in one of the lumber camps owned by Chester's father, in the great Northwest. Always athletically inclined, the time thus spent among the rough lumbermen had given the boys new prowess. Day after day they spent in the woods, hunting big game, and both had become proficient in the use of firearms; while to their boxing skill--learned under a veteran of the prize-ring, who was employed by Chester's father in the town in which they lived--they added that dexterity which comes only with hard experience. Daily fencing lessons had made both proficient in the use of sword and saber.  Among these woodsmen, composed of laborers from many nations, they had also picked up a smattering of many European languages, which proved of great help to them on their trip abroad.  Standing firmly upon their rights from first to last, the two lads never allowed anyone to impose upon them, although they were neither naturally pugnacious nor aggressive. However, there had been more than one lumberjack who had found to his discomfort that he could not infringe upon their good nature, which was at all times apparent.  Both boys were large and sturdy, and the months spent in the lumber camps had given hardness to their muscles. Their ever-readiness for a rough-and-tumble, the fact that neither had ever been known to dodge trouble--although neither had ever sought it, and that where one was involved in danger there was sure to be found the other also--had gained for them among the rough men of the lumber camp the nickname of \"The Boy Allies,\" a name which had followed them to their city home.  It was by this name that the boys were most endearingly known to their companions; and there was more than one small boy who owed his escape from older tormentors to the \"Boy Allies'\" idea of what was right and wrong, and to the power of their arms.  Both lads were keenly interested in history, so, in spite of the manner in which they tried to reassure Mrs. Paine and set her mind at rest, there is no cause for wonder in the fact that both were more concerned in the movement of troops and warships than in the efforts the other powers were making to prevent a general European war.  Staunch admirers of Napoleon and the French people, and, with a long line of descendants among the English, the sympathies of both were naturally with the Allies. As Chester had said to Hal, when first rumors of the impending conflagration were heard:  \"It's too bad we cannot take a hand in the fighting. The war will be the greatest of all time, and both sides will need every man they can get capable of bearing arms.\"  \"You bet it's too bad,\" Hal had replied; \"but we're still in Europe, and you never can tell what will happen. We may have to play a part in the affair whether we want to or not,\" and here the conversation had ended, although such thoughts were still in the minds of both boys when they accompanied Mrs. Paine to their apartment to pack up, preparatory to their departure in the morning.  The packing completed, the lads announced their intention of walking out and learning the latest war news.  \"We won't be gone long, mother,\" said Hal.  \"Very well, son,\" Mrs. Paine replied; \"but, whatever you do, don't get into any trouble. However, I do not suppose there is any danger to be feared--yet.\"  For more than an hour the lads wandered about the streets, reading the war bulletins in front of the various newspaper offices, and listening to crowds of men discussing the latest reports, which became more grave every minute.  As the boys started on their return to their hotel, they heard a shout down a side street, followed immediately by more yells and cries; and then a voice rang out in English:  \"Help! Police!\"  Breaking into a quick run, Hal and Chester soon were upon the scene of confusion.  With their backs to a wall, two young men were attempting to beat back with their fists a crowd of a dozen assailants, who beset them from three directions.  As the two boys rounded the corner, the cry for help again went up.  \"Come on, Chester!\" shouted Hal. \"We can't let that gang of hoodlums beat up anyone who speaks the English language.\"  \"Lead on!\" cried Chester. \"I am right with you!\"  They were upon the crowd as he spoke, and Hal's right fist shot out with stinging force, and the nearest assailant, struck on the side of the neck, fell to the ground with a groan.  \"Good work, Hal!\" shouted Chester, at the same time wading into the crowd of young ruffians, for such the attackers proved to be, and striking out right and left.  Howls of anger and imprecations greeted the attack from this unexpected source, and for a moment the ruffians fell back. In the time that it took the crowd to return to the struggle, the boys "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12656"],["title","The Boy Allies at Liège; Or, Through Lines of Steel (#1)"],["body","their way to the side of the victims of the attack, and the four, with their backs to the wall, took a breathing spell.  \"You didn't arrive a moment too soon,\" said one of the young men, with a smile. \"I had begun to think we were due for a trimming.\"  \"There are four of us here,\" returned Hal, \"and we ought to be good for that crowd; but, instead of standing here, when they attack again, let's make a break and fight our way through. There will be more of them along in a minute, and it will be that much harder for us.\"  \"Good!\" returned the second stranger in French. \"Here they come!\"  \"Are you ready?\" asked Hal.  \"All ready,\" came the reply from the other three.  \"All right, then. Now!\"  At the word the four rushed desperately into the throng, which was pressing in on them from three sides. Taken by surprise, the enemy gave way for a moment; then closed in again.  Blows fell thick and fast for the space of a couple of minutes. Then, suddenly, Chester fell to the ground.  Turning, Hal fought his way to the other side of Chester's prostrate body. Then, bending down, he lifted his chum to his feet.  \"Hurt much?\" he asked.  \"No,\" replied Chester, shaking his head like an enraged bull. \"Let me get at them again!\"  He rushed in among his assailants with even greater desperation than before, and two young hoodlums fell before his blows.  In the meantime the strangers were giving a good account of themselves, and the enemy were falling before their smashing fists.  Hal ducked a blow from the closest of his assailants, and, stepping in close, struck him with all his power under the chin. The youth fell to the ground.  As he did so the ruffian nearest him, with a hiss of rage, drew a knife, with which he made a wicked slash at Hal. Hal did not see the movement, being closely pressed elsewhere, but Chester, with a sudden cry, leaped forward and seized the hand holding the knife, just as the weapon would have been buried in Hal's back.  \"You would, would you, you coward!\" he cried, and struck the young German in the face with all the strength of his right arm. The latter toppled over like a log.  All this time the crowd of assailants continued to grow. Attracted by the sounds of the scuffle, reinforcements arrived from all directions, and it is hard to tell what would have happened had not the sudden blast of a whistle interrupted the proceedings.  \"The police!\" yelled someone in the crowd. \"Run!\"  In less time than it takes to tell it, Hal, Chester, and the two other young men were alone, while racing toward them, down the street, were several figures in uniform.  \"Run!\" cried the young Frenchman. \"If they catch us we will all go to jail, and there is no telling when we'll get out. Run!\"  The four took to their heels, and, dodging around corner after corner, were soon safe from pursuit.  \"Well, I guess we are safe now,\" said the Englishman, when they stopped at last. Then, turning to Hal:  \"I don't know how to thank you and your friend. If you had not arrived when you did, I fear it would have fared badly with us.\"  \"No thanks are due,\" replied Hal. \"It's a poor American who would refuse to help anyone in trouble. Shake hands and call it square!\"  The Englishman smiled.  \"As modest as you are bold, eh? Well, all right,\" and he extended his hand, which Hal and Chester grasped in turn.  But the Frenchman was not to be put off so easily. He insisted on embracing both of the boys, much to their embarrassment.  \"I'm Lieutenant Harry Anderson, of the Tenth Dragoons, His Majesty's service,\" explained the Englishman, and then, turning to his friend: \"This is Captain Raoul Derevaux, Tenth Regiment, French Rifle Corps. We were strolling along the street when attacked by the gang from which you saved us. In the morning we shall try to get out of Germany by way of the Belgian frontier. If now, or at any other time, we may be of service to you, command us.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" put in the Frenchman, \"I consider myself your debtor for life.\"  Hal and Chester thanked their newly-made friends for their good will, and, after a little further conversation, left them to continue their way, while they returned to the hotel, much to the relief of Mrs. Paine, who had become very uneasy at their long absence.     CHAPTER II.  A PERILOUS SITUATION.   \"Come on, Hal. Let's stroll about a few minutes. We've lots of time before the train pulls out.\"  It was Chester who spoke. Mrs. Paine and the two boys were sitting in their compartment of the Brussels express, in the station at Berlin. It still lacked ten minutes of the time set for departure.  \"You don't mind, do you, mother?\" said Hal.  \"No; if you do not go too far,\" was the answer.  The boys descended from the car, and wandered toward the entrance of the station. Just as they were about to step on to the street, a German military officer swung into the doorway. Hal, who was directly in his path, stepped aside, but not quickly enough to entirely avoid him.  With one outstretched arm the officer shoved him violently to one side, and then stopped.  \"What do you mean by blocking my way?\" he demanded. \"Do you know who I am?\"  Hal's temper was aroused.  \"No, I don't; and I don't care,\" was his reply.  \"Well, I'll give you something to care about,\" and, raising his hand, the officer made as though to strike Hal across the face.  \"Don't you strike me,\" said Hal quietly. \"I'm an American citizen, and I give you warning.\"  \"Warning!\" sneered the officer. \"You young American upstart! I'll have you whipped!\" and he turned as though to call someone.  At that moment there was a sudden cry of \"All aboard!\" and the officer, after taking a threatening step toward Hal, made a dash for the train.  \"I guess that is our train, Hal,\" said Chester. \"We had better hurry.\"  The lads retraced their steps toward their train. Reaching the shed, they saw the German officer disappearing into a compartment on the train.  \"That looks like our compartment to me,\" said Hal. \"I hope we don't have to ride with him.\"  \"I hope not,\" agreed Chester, and then broke into a run, as he shouted:  \"Hurry! The train is moving!\"  It was true. The boys had wasted too much time.  The door to one compartment was all that stood open, and that was the one in which Mrs. Paine could be seen gesticulating to them.  \"We just made it,\" panted Hal, as they reached the open door, and started to climb aboard.  At that instant a uniformed arm appeared through the door and pushed Hal away.  \"Go away, you American puppy,\" came a voice.  Hal slipped, and but for the prompt action of Chester, who caught him by the arm, would have fallen beneath the train.  The train gathered momentum, as the boys raced along beside it, in vain seeking an open door by which they might climb aboard. There was none but their own compartment, and that had passed them. It was impossible for them to overtake it, and there was not a train guard in sight.  The boys stopped running and stood still as the remainder of the train slipped past.  On ahead they could see Mrs. Paine and the big German officer, both gazing back toward them, the former gesticulating violently.  Hal stamped his foot with rage.  \"I'd like to get my hands on that big lout!\" he shouted. \"I'd--\"  \"Come, come, old fellow,\" interrupted Chester, \"never mind that, now. I don't blame you, but you can see it's impossible. You'll have to wait.\"  \"You are right, of course,\" replied Hal. \"The thing to do now is to send mother a telegram to the first station and tell her not to worry, that we shall be along on the next train. But, just the same, I'd like to get my hands on that--\"  \"Come, now,\" Chester interrupted again, \"let's send that telegram and find out when the next train leaves.\"  They found the telegraph office, and Hal prepared a message, which he handed through the window.  The clerk glanced at it, and then passed it back.  \"Can't be sent,\" he informed Hal.  \"Can't be sent! Why not?\"  \"Nothing can be sent over this wire but military messages from this time on,\" said the clerk.  \"But we missed the train, and I want to send this message to my mother, so she won't worry,\" pleaded Hal.  \"I'm sorry,\" the clerk returned kindly, \"but it is impossible. I must obey my orders.\"  Hal and Chester were nonplused.  \"What shall we do?\" questioned Chester.  \"The only thing I know to do,\" replied Hal, \"is to take the next train without telegraphing. Mother is sure to be at the Brussels station. I guess she knows we have enough sense to get there.\"  \"All right Let's find out when the next train leaves.\"  On their way to the ticket window, Hal stopped suddenly.  \"What's the matter\" asked Chester.  \"Matter!\" exclaimed Hal. \"The matter is I haven't any money. All I have was enough to send that telegram, and that amount won't get us to Brussels.\"  Chester reached in his pocket, and a startled expression came over his face.  \"Neither have I,\" he exclaimed, feeling first one pocket and then another. \"I have lost my pocketbook. All I have is a little change.\"  The lads looked at each other in silence for several minutes.  \"What shall we do?\" Chester asked finally.  \"I don't know what to do,\" replied Hal; \"but we have got to do something. I guess the best thing is to go back to the embassy and see if we can't raise the price of a couple of tickets. I am sure the ambassador will let us have it.\"  \"A good idea,\" said Chester. \"I guess the sooner we get there the better. Come on.\"  The ambassador received them immediately.  \"I'm awfully sorry, boys,\" he said, after listening to their troubles, \"but I am afraid I can do nothing for you.\"  \"Can't you lend us enough money to get to Brussels?\" asked Hal in surprise. \"You'll get it back, all right.\"  \"Yes, I can lend it to you, and I am not afraid of not getting it back.\"  \"Then why can't you help us?\"  \"The reason is this,\" the ambassador explained, \"this morning's train to Brussels was the last upon which foreigners were allowed to depart. The German government has given orders that all"]]]
