If genera are simply groups of convenience the separation should be made.  I. EUMAMILLARIA.  Flowers from the axils of the older or full-grown tubercles (hence usually appearing lateral), mostly small, and generally from whitish to pink or red: tubercles never grooved: fruit almost always clavate and scarlet.  A. Tubercles more or less quadrangular.  *  Central spines not hooked. +  More than one central spine.   1. Cactus alternatus, sp. nov.  Subglobose, 10 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles long (15 to 20 mm.) and spreading, with woolly axils: radial spines 3, rigid and recurved, 5 mm. long; central spines 3, very stout and much recurved, 20 to 30 mm. long, alternating with the radials; all ashy colored and often twisted: flower and fruit unknown.--Type in Herb. Coulter.  The few spines, with the very short radials alternating with the very long and stout centrals, furnish a striking character. Occasionally one of the centrals is wanting.  2.Cactus acanthophlegmus (Lehm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria acanthophlegma Lehm. Delect. Sem. Hamb. (1833)  Subglobose with a deeply depressed vertex, or becoming cylindrical, 3 to 8.5 cm. in diameter: tubercles sharply quadrangular-conical, with densely woolly axils: radial spines 15 to 30, white, very slender (bristly) and radiant, sometimes coarse capillary, 4 to 7 mm. long, interwoven with those of neighboring tubercles and so covering the whole plant; central spines 2 to 4, robust and straight, erect or divergent, whitish or reddish, black-tipped, 5 to 6.5 mm. long: flowers reddish, 1 to 2 cm. broad: fruit unknown.  Type unknown.  From Coahuila and San Luis Potosi to Oaxaca.  Fl. May.  Specimens examined: Coahuila (Poselger of 1856; Pringle 3116 of 1890): San Luis Potosi (Eschanzier of 1891).  The central spines are quite variable in number and arrangement. In case there are two they are vertically placed and are either erect and parallel or widely divergent.  Even three centrals may occur in the same vertical plane; but more usually the three or four centrals are arranged about a center and are widely divergent.  The tubercles are apt to persist and to become naked and corky with age.  The axillary wool and the capillary radials are also apt to be more or less persistent, thus giving the whole plant a woolly appearance.  3.Cactus brandegei, sp. nov.  Cylindrical: tubercles sharply quadrangular-conical, 6 to 8 mm. long, with densely woolly axils: radial spines about 10, slender and rigid, whitish with dusky tips, spreading but not radiant, 7 to 10 mm. long; central spines 3 or 4, stouter and slightly longer, erect-spreading (sometimes slightly curved), reddish-brown below, becoming blackish above: flowers small (scarcely longer than the tubercle?): fruit unknown.  Type in Herb. Calif. Acad.  San Jorge, Lower California.  Fl. April.  Specimens examined: Lower California (Brandegee of 1889, at San Jorge).  The species has somewhat the spine characters of C. palmeri, but the sharply quadrangular and longer tubercles with axillary wool free from bristles suggest a very different affinity.  4.Cactus densispinus, sp. nov.  Globose, 7.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles short, with woolly axils: radial spines about 25, erect-spreading, slender but rigid, yellow (brownish to black with age), unequal, 8 to 10 mm. long; central spines 6, a little longer (10 to 12 mm.) and straight, more rigid and darker, black-tipped: seeds obovate, reddish-brown, 1 mm. long.  Type in Herb. Coulter.  Very easily distinguished by its dense, erect spines, which so completely cover the plant as to give it the appearance of a large chestnut bur.  Another much smaller form, which seems to be a variety, has stouter and longer ashy-white spines, the centrals darker-tipped, and the lower centrals slightly curved.  ++ One short central spine (rarely two or none): ovaries immersed: seeds small, yellow and rugulose: simple.  5.Cactus heyderi (Muhlenpf.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria heyderi  Muhlenpf. Allg. Gart. Zeit. xvi. 20(1848).   Mamillaria declivis  Dietr. Allg. Gart. Zeit. xviii. 235 (1850).   Mamillaria applanata  Engelm. Pl. Lindh 198 (1850).   Mamillaria texensis  Labouret, Monogr. Cact. 89 (1858).  Depressed, globose, usually with depressed vertex, 8 to 12 cm. broad, 2.5 to 5 cm. high: tubercles elongated: radial spines 10 to 22, whitish, 5 to 12 mm. long, the lower usually the longer, stouter, and often darker; central spine 4 to 8 mm. long, light yellowish-brown, stout, straight, and porrect: flowers 2 to 2.5 cm. long, reddish-white: fruit incurved, 1.5 to 3 cm. long. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9. figs. 4-14).  Type unknown.  From the Guadalupe River, Texas, to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and westward to Arizona and Sonora.  Fl. April, May.  Specimens examined: Texas (Lindheimer of 1845, 1847, 1853; Wright 226, also collections of 1849, 1852, 1853, 1855, 1856; Bigelow of 1853; Trelease of 1892; Nealley of 1892): New Mexico (Wright 311; Bigelow of 1853, Evans of 1891): Arizona (Pringle of 1881): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893; and in the World's Fair collection of Mrs. Nickels.  The radial spines are somewhat variable in relative length, often becoming almost equal, while sometimes the upper radials are very much reduced.  The figure referred to in Cact. Mex. Bound. is not satisfactory as to the general habit of the plant, which is flat-topped rather than hemispherical.  6.Cactus heyderi hemisphaericus (Engelm.).    Mamillaria hemisphaerica  Engelm. Pl. Lindh. 198 (1850).  Differs in being hemispherical instead of flat-topped, in its fewer (9 to 12) and shorter (4 to 8 mm.) radial spines, and much smaller less rough and lighter-colored seeds.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9. figs. 15-17)  Type, the \"Goebel's Garden\" plants in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Throughout southern Texas and southern New Mexico, and southward; not extending so far north or west as the species, and apparently not so abundant within the United States.  Fl. May.  Specimens examined: Texas(Schott 322, 614): New Mexico (Evans of 1891): also specimens cultivated in the Goebel Garden, St. Louis, in 1847, brought from \"below Matamoras on the Rio Grande\" by the St. Louis Volunteers, in 1816.  On account of its convex top the variety becomes somewhat higher than the species (5 to 7.5 cm.), and the flowers are sometimes slightly longer (2 to 3 cm.).  7.Cactus meiacanthus (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria meiacantha  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 263 (1856)  Hemispherical or with depressed vertex, 7.5 to 12.5 cm. in diameter, with a broad top-shaped base: tubercles compressed, 14 to 18 mm. long: radial spines 5 to 9 (usually about 6), stout and strongly subulate, 6 to 10 mm. long, straight or somewhat curved, whitish or yellowish, the lower mostly a little longer, the upper one sometimes wanting; central spine shorter and stout, darker, straight, and porrect, turned upwards among the radials, or rarely wanting: flowers 2.5 to 3 cm. long, reddish-white: fruit incurved, 2 to 3 cm. long.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9, figs.  1-3).  Type specimens are those of the collections of 1847, 1851, 1852, and 1853, from which the original description was drawn and all of which are in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From the Guadalupe River, Texas, to the \"Great Bend\" of the Rio Grande, westward through western Texas and New Mexico; also northern Mexico (Hemsley); Fl.  May, June.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright of 1851, 1852; Bigelow of 1853): New Mexico (\"Missouri Volunteers\" of 1847; unknown collector in 1880); also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1853, and others growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  Dr. Engelmann regarded this species as possibly only a variety of C. heyderi, to which it is certainly very closely allied through var. hemisphaerica, but the different tubercles and fewer stouter spines serve so well to distinguish it that it seems best to retain its specific rank.  In reference to the citation of the original description an explanation seems necessary, which will apply to numerous similar cases.  The Pacif. R. Rep. iv. 27 (1856), Syn. Cact. 263 (1858), and Cact. Mex. Bound. 9 (1859), have each been cited as the original publication.  The confusion has arisen from the fact that in both the publications of 1856 the description in the Rep. Mex. Bound. is referred to, and in that report the plant is fully described as \"sp. nov.\"  However, the publication of the Boundary Report was long delayed on account of the preparation of the plates, and in the meantime both the publications of 1856 had appeared, in each one of which the species is distinctly characterized and reference made to the description in the forthcoming Boundary Report. As between the two publications of 1856 the Syn. Cact. (Proc. Amer. Acad. iii. 259) was evidently distributed first.  8.Cactus gummiferus (Engelm.) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria gummifera  Engelm. Wisliz. Rep. 21 (1848).  Hemispherical, 7.5 to 12.5 cm. broad and 6 to 10 cm. high: tubercles 12 to 15 mm. long: radial spines 10 to 12, the lower stout, with dusky apex, 12 to 15 mm. long, twice or thrice as long as the whitish setaceous upper ones; central spine (sometimes two) shorter (about 4 mm.), stout, dusky and porrect: flowers 3 cm. long, reddish-white, brownish-red outside: fruit unknown. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9. figs. 18-20)  Type probably lost, as no specimens could be found in the Engelmann Herbarium.  Chihuahua, near Cosihuiriachi.  So far as can be discovered, this species has not been collected since the original Wislizenus collection of 1846-47.  The plants were cultivated by Dr. Engelmann and made to bloom, showing the flowers to be larger and darker colored than in the rest of the group, from which the species also differs in its more robust habit, its very unequal radial spines, and the occasional occurrence of two centrals.    ** Central spine hooked."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1221"],["title","A Preliminary Revision of the North American Species of Cactus, Anhalonium, and (#2)"],["body",".Cactus uncinatus (Zucc) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 261 (1591).    Mamillaria uncinata  Zucc. in Pfeiff. Enum. 34 (1837).   Mamillaria bihamata  Pfeiff. in Otto and Deitr. Gart. vi. 274 (1840)   Mamillaria adunca  Scheidw. (1845-1849?).   Mamillaria depressa  Scheidw. (1845-1849?).  Usually globose (occasionally depressed or even subcolumnar), 5 to 6 cm. in diameter (doubtless becoming larger): tubercles 8 to 10 mm. long, woolly in the upper axils: radial spines 4 to 6, rigid, 4 to 6 mm. long, the upper one stouter than the rest and sometimes shorter, reddish-brown and horny, straight or slightly curved, the remainder straight and white with dusky tips; central spine stout and horny, reddish-brown, 7 to 10 mm. long: flowers greenish-white or tinged with red: fruit unknown Type unknown.  Entirely Mexican, reported from Chihuahua to Saint Luis Potosi.  Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi (Gregg of 1848; Parry 268; Eschanzier of 1891): Chihuahua (Wislizenus of 1846-47; also Chihuahua specimens cultivated in the Jacoby Garden in 1856 and 1857).  The variations observed in this species do not seem sufficient for the establishment of varieties.  The type form seems to have been globose, with 4 radial spines and a stout central one.  The depressed forms with 6 radials and a more slender central represent var. spinosior Lem. (M. depressa Scheidw.); and the subcolumnar forms with 6 radials (the upper one of which is somewhat curved) and a stout strongly hooked central represent var biuncinata Lem. (M. bihamata Pfeiff.)  Such combinations of characters, however, do not hold, as any one of the plant body forms may display any one of the spine characters referred to.  B. Tubercles terete.    * Central spines none: mostly simple globose plants, with very     numerous straight whitish setaceous radials.  10. Cactus lasiacanthus (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 259 (1891).    Mamillaria lasiacantha  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 261 (1856).  Globose or ovate globose, 2 to 2.5 cm. high and 1 to 2 cm. broad: tubercles 4 mm. long, about 2 mm. in diameter, with naked axils: spines 40 to 60, in many series, very unequal, 2 to 4 mm, long, white and pilose, the upper exterior usually longer than the rest, the innermost usually much shorter: flowers 12 mm. long, whitish or pinkish (petals with red median band): fruit 1 to 2 cm. long: seeds about 1 mm. long, blackish and conspicuously pitted. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 3).  Type, the specimens of Wright in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From western Texas (\"west of time Pecos, on low limestone hills, among herbage\") to Arizona and Chihuahua.  Fl. April, May.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 121, also of 1852; Parry of 1852): Arizona (Miller of 1881): Chihuahua (Pringle 213, 250,258): also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1852 and 1855.  11. Cactus lasiacanthus denudatus (Engelm.).    Mamillaria lasiacantha denudata  Engelm. Cact. Mex. Bound. 5   (1859).  Larger, 2.5 to 3.5 cm. in diameter, with longer tubercles (5 to 6 mm.), and more numerous (50 to 80) longer (3 to 5 mum.) spines which are naked or nearly so. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 4) Type, Wright specimen in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From western Texas (with the species) to Coahuila.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright of 1852): Coahuila (Palmer of 1880).  In the Syn. Cact. Dr. Engelmann merges this variety with the species, and has been followed in this by subsequent writers, but the characters seem so (distinctive that its varietal rank has been restored.  12. Cactus micromeris (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria micromeris  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 260 (1856).  With depressed top and very rarely branching, 1 to 3.5 cm. in diameter: tubercles very small (about 1 mm. long) and wart-like, crowded, shedding the spines with age and giving the base of the plant a tuberculated appearance: spines from white to ashy-gray, 1 to 3 mm. long; in young plants and on lower tubercles of adult plants about 20, equal and radiant; on flower-bearing tubercles 30 to 40, stellate-porrect in every direction, the 6 to 8 upper ones two to four times longer than the rest (4 to 8 mm.), clavate toward the apex and acute (the clavate top at length deciduous), intermixed with loose wool of about the same length and forming a small tuft on the top of the plant which includes and partly hides flowers and fruit: flowers whitish to light pink, almost central, very small (6 mm. in diameter), much reduced (3 to 5 sepals, 5 petals, 10 to 15 stamens, 3 stigmas): fruit 8 to 12 mm. long: seeds 1.5 mm. long, black and shining. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 1 and 2. figs. 1-4)  Type, the specimens of Wright in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  On naked mountain tops and sides, extreme southwestern Texas (Val Verde County to El Paso) and southward into Coahuila and Chihuahua.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 227 of 1849, also of 1852; Nealley of 1892): Coahuila (Bigelow of 1853): Chihuahua (Pringle 212): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  The plants densely covered above with delicate ashy-gray spines and with naked tuberculate base are readily recognized.  It still remains an open question whether the flowers are developed from the axils of tubercles of the same season or the last ones of the preceding season.  Dr. Engelmann inclined to the latter view, as all the other characters of the plant associate it with the \"lateral-flowered\" species; and in the absence of definite observation we have retained it there.  If the nearly central flowers indicate that they are produced from growth of the same season the species would seem to be allied to Coryphantha, in which group its small flowers and small tubercles would be anomalous.  13. Cactus micromeris greggii (Engelm.).    Mamillaria micromeris greggii  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 261 (1856).  Larger (2.5 to 5 cm. in diameter) and becoming oblong, with larger globose-ovate tubercles (2 to 2.5 mm. long), fewer rigid spines all radiant (interior 5 to 7 shorter and stouter, 1 to 2 mm. long; the outer 15 to 18, 3 to 4 mm. long), and fruit 1.5 to 2 mm. long. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 2. figs. 5-8)  Type, Gregg 508 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Mountain ridges near Saltillo, Coahuila.  Said by Budd to occur within the southern borders of Pecos County, Tex.  Specimens examined: Coahuila (Gregg 508; Palmer of 1880).  It is a question whether this variety does not merely represent an older and better developed plant than those upon which the species is based.  Mr. Harry I. Budd, who has made extensive collections of Texan and Mexican Cacti for the market, reports that it is impossible to separate sharply the variety from the species in the field, and regards the difference merely as one of age.  Unfortunately, only living material of the species could be examined, but its characters seem well sustained even in the most vigorous plants, some of which reach the size of the variety. Through this variety the species is brought very near the following:  14. Cactus bispinus.    Mamillaria microthele  Muhlenpf. Allg. Gart. Zeit. p. 11 (1848),   not Lem. (1838).  Differs from the last form (var. greggii) chiefly in its cespitose habit, much larger tubercles, and two unusually stout and short central spines (fide Engelmann, who examined specimens in Coll. Salm-Dyck).  Credited to Mexico in general, but said by Budd to occur within the southern border of Pecos County, Tex.    ** Central spines present and one or more hooked.   +  Mostly globose and simple plants (occasionally somewhat      cylindrical).  15. Cactus wrightii (Engelm.) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 261 (1891).    Mamillaria wrightii  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 262 (1856).  Globose or depressed globose (top-shaped below), 3 to 7.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles 10 to 12 mm. long, with naked axils: radial spines 8 to 12, white (the upper dusky-tipped), pubescent, 8 to 12 mm. long central spines mostly 2 (usually side by side and divergent), rarely 1 or 3, scarcely longer, hooked and reddish-black: flowers 2.5 cm. long, bright purple: fruit about 2.5 cm. long, somewhat subglobose, purple: seeds 1.4 mm long, black and pitted.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t.8. figs. 1-8)  Type, Wright of 1851 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  High plains and rocky places, from the Upper Pecos, east of Santa Fe, N. Mex., southward through extreme southwestern Texas (between the Pecos and El Paso), and into Chihuahua (near Lake Santa Maria).  Specimens examined: New Mexico (Wright of 1851; Rusby of 1880): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  Dr. Engelmann calls attention to the fact that this species is closely allied to the Mexican C. zephranthoides (Scheidw.), but in the absence of material representing the latter species no comparison can be made.  In descriptions of the Mexican species the differently colored flowers and the much longer spines suggest differences that an examination of fruit and seed characters may still further emphasize.  16. Cactus goodrichii (Scheer) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria goodrichii  Scheer in Salm Cact. Hort. Dyck. 91   (1850).  Globose or ovate, 5 to 7.5 cm. high, subsimple: tubercles ovate, short (3 to 5 mm.), somewhat corky and persistent, with dense wool in the young axils containing 5 to 8 stiff bristles: radial spines 11 to 15 (the uppermost one sometimes wanting), white and rigid, 5 to 7 mm. long, entangled with adjoining clusters; central spines 3 or 4 (often solitary in young plants), brownish-black,the upper ones divergent and straight (rarely showing a tendency to hook), the lower longer (9 to 10 mm.), stouter and hooked (usually upwards): flowers 12 to 18 mm, long, the petals yellowish-white with red midribs: fruit clavate and scarlet. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 8. figs. 9-14)  Type: Scheer says that the plant was brought from the Island of \"Corros\" (Cedros?) by Dr. Goodrich, and \"unfortunately perished in the gardens,\" which generally means that there is not a fragment of the type in existence.  In dry ravines, from San Diego County, California, southward throughout Lower California"]]]
