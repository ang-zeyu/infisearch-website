The Schott specimens are from Eagle Pass.  Dr. Engelmann calls attention to the fact that this species approaches Coryphantha in its exserted ovary and large flower, but the flowers are clearly from the growth of the preceding season.  The species is said to be too near the Mexican C. longimamma of central and southern Mexico, but in the absence of type specimens of either the question can not be settled. The usual characterization of C. longimamma is as follows, which seems to make it distinct enough:  36. Cactus longimamma  (DC.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria longimamma  DC. Rev. Cact. 113 (1829).  Ovate or at length cylindrical, simple or cespitose: tubercles oblong-ovate, large at base, 4 to 5 cm. long: radial spines 7 or 8, radiant and equal, 8 to 10 mm. long or more, more or less pubescent; central spines 1 to 3, somewhat longer and spreading: flower 4 cm. long, becoming 6 cm. broad when fully expanded, yellow.  (Ill. DC. Mem. Cact. t. 5.)  II. CORYPHANTHA.

Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 416, 478, of 1851, 1852; Evans of 1891): San Luis Potosi (Eschanzier of 1891).  The var. valida was described by Dr. Engelmann without having seen C. scheerii, the only knowledge of that species being obtained from the description of Prince Salm-Dyck in Cact. Hort. Dyck., which seemed to indicate a smaller form, with fewer spines than the Texan form.  However, when visiting the collections of Prince Salm-Dyck, Dr. Engelmann found original specimens of C. scheerii which were exactly his var. valida.  So far as collections show the Texan form seems to be more robust than the Mexican, but the material is too scanty to justify such a generalization.  Dr. Engelmann speaks of this species as \"a stately plant, by far the largest, of the northern Mamillariae\" Its tubercles are bright green and in beautiful contrast with the showy yellow spines.  41.

Subglobose: tubercles very broad and retuse, almost 2-parted by the tomentose groove, with axillary floccose wool: radial spines 7 or 8, very rigid, widely radiant, somewhat curved, 3 to 3.5 cm. long, in older tubercles 3 to 6 additional slender and straight or twisted spines; the solitary central spine very stout, erect, almost 5 cm. long: flowers and fruit unknown.  Type: Scheer says that this plant, brought from Chihuahua by Potts, \"unfortunately perished,\" and the description was drawn from fragments, which in those days were not apt to be preserved.  Chihuahua.  Specimens examined: Chihuahua (\"Salm of 1857 \").  The specimen referred to is in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard., and reveals no additional characters; nor can the label be interpreted, except that it indicates that the specimen is from plants cultivated successfully in the gardens of Prince Salm-Dyck.    ++ Flower and fruit remaining central in the very woolly vertex      of the plant.   ++ Central spine solitary or wanting.  44.

Rev. Cact. 111 (1829).   Mamillaria pectinata  Engelm Syn. Cact. 266 (1856).  Globose, 3.5 to 7.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles conical, from a 4-angled base, lower ones short (4 to 6 mm.), upper flower-bearing ones longer (10 to 12 mm.), terete and grooved: radial spines 16 to 24, somewhat recurved from a bulbous compressed base, stiff and pectinate, horny or whitish (at length ashy), interwoven with adjacent clusters, those on lower tubercles about equal (6 to 10 mm.), on flower-bearing tubercles elongated, mixed with a few stouter ones and fasciculated (lower ones 10 to 12 mm. long, upper ones 12 to 18 mm. long and forming an apical tuft); centrals none: flowers over 5 cm. long and about 6 to 7.5 cm. in diameter when expanded, bright sulphur-yellow: fruit ovate and green, about 12 mm. long: seeds compressed, brownish smooth and shining, 1.8 mm. long. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 11)  Type unknown; that of M. pectinata Engelm. is the Wright material in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Extending from the hills along the Lower Pecos to El Paso, southwestern Texas, southward through Coahuila and San Luis Potosi to southern Mexico.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 226 of 1849, also of 1852; Evans of 1891): Coahuila (Palmer of 1880; Mrs. Nickels): San Luis Potosi (Parry & Palmer 265; Eschanzier of 1891): also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1853; in Mo. Bot. Gard. in 1892; and in Harv. Bot Gard.  Even in the absence of the type I have ventured to refer Mamillaria pectinata Engelm. to this species.  Dr. Engelmann had concluded that the two were \"not sufficiently distinct,\" and the examination of Mexican forms which pass as C. radians abundantly confirms this conclusion.  Besides, every character in the original description of C. radians applies exactly to these Mexican plants and to our Texan specimens as well.  Aside from the fact that the Mexican specimens are apt to be more robust, I can discover no difference whatever. For discussion of relationships see under C. scolymoides.  46. Cactus radians pectenoides, var. nov.  Differs in its cespitose habit, fewer (16 or 17) and stouter spines (8 to 9 mm. long), and its larger and longer (10 mm.) less deeply grooved tubercles.  Type in Herb. Coulter.  San Luis Potosi.  Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi (Eschanzier of 1891).  47. Cactus corniferus  (DC.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria cornifera  DC. Rev.

Globose, 7.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles oblong-ovate, 2 cm long, crowded, the younger axils woolly: radial spines 15 to 26, rigid and horny, curved or sometimes straight, reflexed, bulbous at base, yellowish (whiter with age) and with dark tips, very sharp, 10 to 12 mm, long; the central one much stouter, darker, slightly deflexed, 12 to 16 mm long, sometimes wanting: flower unknown: fruit obovate, red, 2 cm long: seeds reddish, angular, smooth, 2 mm. long.  Type unknown.  From San Luis Potosi to southern Mexico.  Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi (Parry of 1879; Eschanzier of 1891): also specimens cultivated in Mo. Bot. Gard. in 1892; growing in same garden in 1893.  Mamillaria impexicoma Lem., afterwards reduced to a variety, was based upon fewer radial spines and no central.  As the central is occasionally wanting in connection with the most numerous radials, and present with the fewest, such a form would have to be separated solely on the absence of the central spine, and even in the original description of impexicoma the central spine is only said to be \"sometimes wanting.\"  It has been impossible for me to separate the forms. It should be said that the fruit and seed characters given above were taken front a specimen whose few radials and no centrals would undoubtedly refer it to impexicoma.  As yet we are ignorant of the flower of C. corniferus. For discussion of relationships see under C. scolymoides.    ++ Central spines 1 to 4.  48. Cactus scolymoides (Scheidw.) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 261 (1891).    Mamillaria scolymoides  Scheidw Allg. Gart. Zeit. ix. 44 (1841).  Globose or ovate, 5 to 7.5 cm. high. subsimple: tubercles conical, 10 to 16 mm. long, the upper elongated, incurved and imbricate: radial spines 14 to 20, straight or often recurved, white or horny, 10 to 20 mm. long (the upper the longer); central spines 1 to 4, longer (18 to 32 mm.), more dusky, curved, the upper ones turned upwards and intermixed with the radials, the lower one stouter, longer, and curved downwards: flowers 5 cm. long: fruit unknown.  Type unknown.  From the Pecos River, western Texas, westward into southern New Mexico, and southward into Chihuahua and San Luis Potosi.  Specimens examined: Texas (Hays of 1858): New Mexico (Bigelow of 1853): Chihuahua (Wislizenus of 1846): also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1858.  Specimens collected by Mrs. Anna B Nickels across the Rio Grande from Laredo, Texas, and showing neither flower nor fruit, seem to intergrade between C. scolymoides and C. scolymoides sulcatus. The habit is that of the former, the tubercles are those of the latter, while the spines are somewhat different from either.  The number of central spines in these specimens is very hard to determine, as on the adult tubercle they all assume a radial position.  The usual adult arrangement is an apparent absence of central spines; 10 to 12 rigid, spreading and more or less recurved radials (increasing in length from the lowest), which are mostly white or the upper more or less dusky; and above, just behind the radial row, 2 or 3 stout recurved-ascending spines, which are white with tips more or less reddish-black, one of the spines usually much stouter and longer than the others.  This form may represent a distinct species, but it seems very unsafe to add species to the C. scolymoides group without the fullest information.  Prince Salm-Dyck refers C. scolymoides to \"M. daimonoceras Lem. Cact. gen. nov., p. 5,\" but no mention of such a name can be found in the work referred to.  Labouret refers C. corniferus to the same name and reference.  If \"M. daimonoceras\" was anything more than a garden or herbarium name used by"]]]
