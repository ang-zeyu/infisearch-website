Goodly name as ere was sung,             Roundly rolling on the tongue--             Cumberland! Cumberland!  What need to tell how she was fought--   The sinking flaming gun-- The gunner leaping out the port--       Washed back, undone! Her dead unconquerably manned       The Cumberland.              Noble name as ere was sung,             Slowly roll it on the tongue--             Cumberland! Cumberland!  Long as hearts shall share the flame   Which burned in that brave crew, Her fame shall live--outlive the victor’s name;       For this is due. Your flag and flag-staff shall in story stand--       Cumberland!              Sounding name as ere was sung,             Long they’ll roll it on the tongue--             Cumberland! Cumberland!    In the Turret. (March, 1862.)   Your honest heart of duty, Worden,   So helped you that in fame you dwell; You bore the first iron battle’s burden   Sealed as in a diving-bell. Alcides, groping into haunted hell To bring forth King Admetus’ bride, Braved naught more vaguely direful and untried.   What poet shall uplift his charm, Bold Sailor, to your height of daring,   And interblend therewith the calm, And build a goodly style upon your bearing.  Escaped the gale of outer ocean--   Cribbed in a craft which like a log Was washed by every billow’s motion--   By night you heard of Og The huge; nor felt your courage clog At tokens of his onset grim: You marked the sunk ship’s flag-staff slim,   Lit by her burning sister’s heart; You marked, and mused: “Day brings the trial:   Then be it proved if I have part With men whose manhood never took denial.”  A prayer went up--a champion’s. Morning   Beheld you in the Turret walled by adamant, where a spirit forewarning   And all-deriding called: “Man, darest thou--desperate, unappalled-- Be first to lock thee in the armored tower? I have thee now; and what the battle-hour   To me shall bring--heed well--thou’lt share; This plot-work, planned to be the foeman’s terror,   To thee may prove a goblin-snare; Its very strength and cunning--monstrous error!”  “Stand up, my heart; be strong; what matter   If here thou seest thy welded tomb? And let huge Og with thunders batter--   Duty be still my doom, Though drowning come in liquid gloom; First duty, duty next, and duty last; Ay, Turret, rivet me here to duty fast!--”   So nerved, you fought wisely and well; And live, twice live in life and story;   But over your Monitor dirges swell, In wind and wave that keep the rites of glory.    The Temeraire.[3]  _(Supposed to have been suggested to an Englishman of the old order by the fight of the Monitor and Merrimac.)_   The gloomy hulls, in armor grim,   Like clouds o’er moors have met, And prove that oak, and iron, and man   Are tough in fibre yet.  But Splendors wane. The sea-fight yields   No front of old display; The garniture, emblazonment,   And heraldry all decay.  Towering afar in parting light,   The fleets like Albion’s forelands shine-- The full-sailed fleets, the shrouded show   Of Ships-of-the-Line.  The fighting Temeraire,   Built of a thousand trees, Lunging out her lightnings,   And beetling o’er the seas-- O Ship, how brave and fair,   That fought so oft and well, On open decks you manned the gun     Armorial.[4] What cheering did you share,   Impulsive in the van, When down upon leagued France and Spain   We English ran-- The freshet at your bowsprit   Like the foam upon the can. Bickering, your colors   Licked up the Spanish air, You flapped with flames of battle-flags--   Your challenge, Temeraire! The rear ones of our fleet   They yearned to share your place, Still vying with the Victory   Throughout that earnest race-- The Victory, whose Admiral,   With orders nobly won, Shone in the globe of the battle glow--   The angel in that sun. Parallel in story,   Lo, the stately pair, As late in grapple ranging,   The foe between them there-- When four great hulls lay tiered,   And the fiery tempest cleared, And your prizes twain appeared,     Temeraire!  But Trafalgar’ is over now,   The quarter-deck undone; The carved and castled navies fire   Their evening-gun. O, Tital Temeraire,   Your stern-lights fade away; Your bulwarks to the years must yield,   And heart-of-oak decay. A pigmy steam-tug tows you,   Gigantic, to the shore-- Dismantled of your guns and spars,   And sweeping wings of war. The rivets clinch the iron-clads,   Men learn a deadlier lore; But Fame has nailed your battle-flags--   Your ghost it sails before: O, the navies old and oaken,   O, the Temeraire no more!    A Utilitarian View of the Monitors Fight.   Plain be the phrase, yet apt the verse,   More ponderous than nimble; For since grimed War here laid aside His Orient pomp, ’twould ill befit     Overmuch to ply The Rhyme’s barbaric cymbal.  Hail to victory without the gaud   Of glory; zeal that needs no fans Of banners; plain mechanic power Plied cogently in War now placed--     Where War belongs-- Among the trades and artisans.  Yet this was battle, and intense--   Beyond the strife of fleets heroic; Deadlier, closer, calm ’mid storm; No passion; all went on by crank,     Pivot, and screw, And calculations of caloric.  Needless to dwell; the story’s known.   the ringing of those plates on plates Still ringeth round the world-- The clangor of that blacksmith’s fray.     The anvil-din Resounds this message from the Fates:  War shall yet be, and to the end;   But war-paint shows the streaks of weather; War yet shall be, but warriors Are now but operatives; War’s made     Less grand than Peace, And a singe runs through lace and feather.    Shiloh. A Requiem. (April, 1862.)   Skimming lightly, wheeling still,   The swallows fly low Over the field in clouded days,   The forest-field of Shiloh-- Over the field where April rain Solaced the parched ones stretched in pain Through the pause of night That followed the Sunday fight   Around the church of Shiloh-- The church so lone, the log-built one, That echoed to many a parting groan     And natural prayer Of dying foemen mingled there-- Foemen at morn, but friends at eve--   Fame or country least their care: (What like a bullet can undeceive!)   But now they lie low, While over them the swallows skim,   And all is hushed at Shiloh.    The Battle for the Mississipppi. (April, 1862.)   When Israel camped by Migdol hoar,   Down at her feet her shawm she threw, But Moses sung and timbrels rung   For Pharaoh’s standed crew. So God appears in apt events--   The Lord is a man of war! So the strong wind to the muse is given       In victory’s roar.  Deep be the ode that hymns the fleet--   The fight by night--the fray Which bore our Flag against the powerful stream,   And led it up to day. Dully through din of larger strife   Shall bay that warring gun; But none the less to us who live   It peals--an echoing one.  The shock of ships, the jar of walls,   The rush through thick and thin-- The flaring fire-rafts, glare and gloom--   Eddies, and shells that spin-- The boom-chain burst, the hulks dislodged,   The jam of gun-boats driven, Or fired, or sunk--made up a war   Like Michael’s waged with leven.  The manned Varuna stemmed and quelled   The odds which hard beset; The oaken flag-ship, half ablaze,   Passed on and thundered yet; While foundering, gloomed in grimy flame,   The Ram Manassas--hark the yell!-- Plunged, and was gone; in joy or fright,   The River gave a startled swell.  They fought through lurid dark till dawn;   The war-smoke rolled away With clouds of night, and showed the fleet   In scarred yet firm array, Above the forts, above the drift   Of wrecks which strife had made; And Farragut sailed up to the town   And anchored--sheathed the blade.  The moody broadsides, brooding deep,   Hold the lewd mob at bay, While o’er the armed decks’ solemn aisles   The meek church-pennons play; By shotted guns the sailors stand,   With foreheads bound or bare; The captains and the conquering crews   Humble their pride in prayer.  They pray; and after victory, prayer   Is meet for men who mourn their slain; The living shall unmoor and sail,   But Death’s dark anchor secret deeps detain. Yet glory slants her shaft of rays   Far through the undisturbed abyss; There must be other, nobler worlds for them   Who nobly yield their lives in this.    Malvern Hill. (July, 1862.)   Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill   In prime of morn and May, Recall ye how McClellan’s men     Here stood at bay? While deep within yon forest dim   Our rigid comrades lay-- Some with the cartridge in their mouth, Others with fixed arms lifted South--       Invoking so The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe!  The spires of Richmond, late beheld   Through rifts in musket-haze, Were closed from view in clouds of dust     On leaf-walled ways, Where streamed our wagons in caravan;   And the Seven Nights and Days Of march and fast, retreat and fight, Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight--       Does the elm wood Recall the haggard beards of blood?  The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed,   We followed (it never fell!)-- In silence husbanded our strength--     Received their yell; Till on this slope we patient turned   With cannon ordered well; Reverse we proved was not defeat; But ah, the sod what thousands meet!--       Does Malvern Wood Bethink itself, and muse and brood?            _We elms of Malvern Hill             Remember every thing;           But sap the twig will fill:           Wag the world how it will,             Leaves must be green in Spring._     The Victor of Antietam.[5] (1862.)   When tempest winnowed grain from bran; And men were looking for a man, Authority called you to the van,         McClellan: Along the line the plaudit ran, As later when Antietam’s cheers began.  Through storm-cloud and eclipse must move Each Cause and Man, dear to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],["title","Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#4)"],["body"," and Jove; Nor always can the wisest tell Deferred fulfillment from the hopeless knell-- The struggler from the floundering ne’er-do-well. A pall-cloth on the Seven Days fell,         Mcclellan-- Unprosperously heroical! Who could Antietam’s wreath foretell?  Authority called you; then, in mist And loom of jeopardy--dismissed. But staring peril soon appalled; You, the Discarded, she recalled-- Recalled you, nor endured delay; And forth you rode upon a blasted way, Arrayed Pope’s rout, and routed Lee’s array,         McClellan: Your tent was choked with captured flags that day,         McClellan. Antietam was a telling fray.  Recalled you; and she heard your drum Advancing through the glastly gloom. You manned the wall, you propped the Dome, You stormed the powerful stormer home,         McClellan: Antietam’s cannon long shall boom.  At Alexandria, left alone,         McClellan-- Your veterans sent from you, and thrown To fields and fortunes all unknown-- What thoughts were yours, revealed to none, While faithful still you labored on-- Hearing the far Manassas gun!         McClellan, Only Antietam could atone.  You fought in the front (an evil day,         McClellan)-- The fore-front of the first assay; The Cause went sounding, groped its way; The leadsmen quarrelled in the bay; Quills thwarted swords; divided sway; The rebel flushed in his lusty May: You did your best, as in you lay,         McClellan. Antietam’s sun-burst sheds a ray.  Your medalled soldiers love you well,         McClellan: Name your name, their true hearts swell; With you they shook dread Stonewall’s spell,[6] With you they braved the blended yell Of rebel and maligner fell; With you in shame or fame they dwell,         McClellan: Antietam-braves a brave can tell.  And when your comrades (now so few,         McClellan-- Such ravage in deep files they rue) Meet round the board, and sadly view The empty places; tribute due They render to the dead--and you! Absent and silent o’er the blue; The one-armed lift the wine to _you_,         McClellan, And great Antietam’s cheers renew.    Battle of Stone River, Tennessee. A View from Oxford Cloisters. (January, 1863.)   With Tewksbury and Barnet heath   In days to come the field shall blend, The story dim and date obscure;   In legend all shall end. Even now, involved in forest shade   A Druid-dream the strife appears, The fray of yesterday assumes   The haziness of years.       In North and South still beats the vein       Of Yorkist and Lancastrian.  Our rival Roses warred for Sway--   For Sway, but named the name of Right; And Passion, scorning pain and death,   Lent sacred fervor to the fight. Each lifted up a broidered cross,   While crossing blades profaned the sign; Monks blessed the fraticidal lance,   And sisters scarfs could twine.       Do North and South the sin retain       Of Yorkist and Lancastrian?  But Rosecrans in the cedarn glade,   And, deep in denser cypress gloom, Dark Breckenridge, shall fade away       Or thinly loom. The pale throngs who in forest cowed   Before the spell of battle’s pause, Forefelt the stillness that shall dwell   On them and on their wars.       North and South shall join the train       Of Yorkist and Lancastrian.  But where the sword has plunged so deep,   And then been turned within the wound By deadly Hate; where Climes contend       On vasty ground-- No warning Alps or seas between,   And small the curb of creed or law, And blood is quick, and quick the brain;   Shall North and South their rage deplore,       And reunited thrive amain       Like Yorkist and Lancastrian?    Running the Batteries, As observed from the Anchorage above Vicksburgh. (April, 1863.)   A moonless night--a friendly one;   A haze dimmed the shadowy shore As the first lampless boat slid silent on;   Hist! and we spake no more; We but pointed, and stilly, to what we saw.  We felt the dew, and seemed to feel   The secret like a burden laid. The first boat melts; and a second keel   Is blent with the foliaged shade-- Their midnight rounds have the rebel officers made?  Unspied as yet. A third--a fourth--   Gun-boat and transport in Indian file Upon the war-path, smooth from the North;   But the watch may they hope to beguile? The manned river-batteries stretch for mile on mile.  A flame leaps out; they are seen;   Another and another gun roars; We tell the course of the boats through the screen   By each further fort that pours, And we guess how they jump from their beds on those shrouded shores.  Converging fires. We speak, though low:   “That blastful furnace can they threadd” “Why, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego   Came out all right, we read; The Lord, be sure, he helps his people, Ned.”  How we strain our gaze. On bluffs they shun   A golden growing flame appears-- Confirms to a silvery steadfast one:   “The town is afire!” crows Hugh: “three cheers” Lot stops his mouth: “Nay, lad, better three tears.”  A purposed light; it shows our fleet;   Yet a little late in its searching ray, So far and strong, that in phantom cheat   Lank on the deck our shadows lay; The shining flag-ship stings their guns to furious play.  How dread to mark her near the glare   And glade of death the beacon throws Athwart the racing waters there;   One by one each plainer grows, Then speeds a blazoned target to our gladdened foes.  The impartial cresset lights as well   The fixed forts to the boats that run; And, plunged from the ports, their answers swell   Back to each fortress dun: Ponderous words speaks every monster gun.  Fearless they flash through gates of flame,   The salamanders hard to hit, Though vivid shows each bulky frame;   And never the batteries intermit, Nor the boats huge guns; they fire and flit.  Anon a lull. The beacon dies:   “Are they out of that strait accurst” But other flames now dawning rise,   Not mellowly brilliant like the first, But rolled in smoke, whose whitish volumes burst.  A baleful brand, a hurrying torch   Whereby anew the boats are seen-- A burning transport all alurch!   Breathless we gaze; yet still we glean Glimpses of beauty as we eager lean.  The effulgence takes an amber glow   Which bathes the hill-side villas far; Affrighted ladies mark the show   Painting the pale magnolia-- The fair, false, Circe light of cruel War.  The barge drifts doomed, a plague-struck one.   Shoreward in yawls the sailors fly. But the gauntlet now is nearly run,   The spleenful forts by fits reply, And the burning boat dies down in morning’s sky.  All out of range. Adieu, Messieurs!   Jeers, as it speeds, our parting gun. So burst we through their barriers   And menaces every one: So Porter proves himself a brave man’s son.[7]    Stonewall Jackson. Mortally wounded at Chancellorsville. (May, 1863.)   The Man who fiercest charged in fight,   Whose sword and prayer were long--           Stonewall!   Even him who stoutly stood for Wrong, How can we praise? Yet coming days   Shall not forget him with this song.  Dead is the Man whose Cause is dead,   Vainly he died and set his seal--           Stonewall!   Earnest in error, as we feel; True to the thing he deemed was due,   True as John Brown or steel.  Relentlessly he routed us;   But _we_ relent, for he is low--           Stonewall!   Justly his fame we outlaw; so We drop a tear on the bold Virginian’s bier,   Because no wreath we owe.    Stonewall Jackson. (Ascribed to a Virginian.)   One man we claim of wrought renown   Which not the North shall care to slur; A Modern lived who sleeps in death,   Calm as the marble Ancients are:     ’Tis he whose life, though a vapor’s wreath,     Was charged with the lightning’s burning breath--       Stonewall, stormer of the war.  But who shall hymn the roman heart?   A stoic he, but even more: The iron will and lion thew   Were strong to inflict as to endure:     Who like him could stand, or pursue?     His fate the fatalist followed through;     In all his great soul found to do       Stonewall followed his star.  He followed his star on the Romney march   Through the sleet to the wintry war; And he followed it on when he bowed the grain--   The Wind of the Shenandoah;     At Gaines’s Mill in the giant’s strain--     On the fierce forced stride to Manassas-plain,     Where his sword with thunder was clothed again,       Stonewall followed his star.  His star he followed athwart the flood   To Potomac’s Northern shore, When midway wading, his host of braves   “_My Maryland!_” loud did roar--     To red Antietam’s field of graves,     Through mountain-passes, woods and waves,     They followed their pagod with hymns and glaives,       For Stonewall followed a star.  Back it led him to Marye’s slope,   Where the shock and the fame he bore; And to green Moss-Neck it guided him--   Brief respite from throes of war:     To the laurel glade by the Wilderness grim,     Through climaxed victory naught shall dim,     Even unto death it piloted him--       Stonewall followed his star.  Its lead he followed in gentle ways   Which never the valiant mar; A cap we sent him, bestarred, to replace   The sun-scorched helm of war:     A fillet he made of the shining lace     Childhood’s laughing brow to grace--       Not his was a goldsmith’s star.  O, much of doubt in after days   Shall cling, as now, to the war; Of the right and the wrong they’ll still debate,   Puzzled by Stonewall’s star:     “Fortune went with the North elate”     “Ay, but the south had Stonewall’s weight,       And he fell in the South’s vain war.”    Gettysburg. The Check. (July, 1863.)   O pride of the days in prime of the months   Now trebled in great renown, When before the ark of our holy cause     Fell Dagon down-- Dagon foredoomed, who, armed and targed, Never his impious heart enlarged Beyond that hour; god walled his power, And there the last invader charged.  He charged, and in that charge condensed   His all of hate and all of fire; He sought to blast us in his scorn,     And wither us in his ire. Before him went the shriek"]]]
