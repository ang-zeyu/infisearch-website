Of course there has as yet been no formal declaration of war between Italy and Austria, but it has been known for days that war was sure to come. Colonel Fuesco here has been entrusted with important documents relating to troop movements, and it is this document that Robard has stolen. It must be recovered.\"  \"We are willing to help all we can,\" said Chester. \"With a little forethought we should have been able to recover it ourselves. Robard made monkeys of us.\"  \"He made a monkey of me, too,\" said the colonel ruefully.  \"The thing to be done,\" said Chester, \"is to get track of him.\"  \"That's easy enough,\" was the reply. \"He can be found at the embassy; but he will deny that he has the paper. Also, we cannot arrest him. Being a member of a foreign embassy, in times of peace he is immune from arrest.\"  \"And he will take the paper with him when he leaves Italy,\" said Major Derevaux.  \"It was stolen once,\" said Hal thoughtfully. \"Why cannot it be stolen again?\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Colonel Fuesco.  \"Just what I say. Robard stole the document from you. Some one must recover it from Robard without his knowledge.\"  \"An excellent idea!\" exclaimed General Ferrari. \"But who will do this work?\"  \"We shall be glad to undertake it, your excellency,\" said Hal.  \"You! But you are so young for such a piece of work.\"  \"Don't you believe it, general,\" Major Derevaux interrupted. \"If the papers can be recovered, these lads can get them. You could not put the mission in better hands.\"  \"But the danger--\"  \"We have been in danger before, sir,\" said Chester quietly.  The general considered a moment, and then brought a hand down on his desk with tremendous force.  \"So be it!\" he exclaimed. \"And if you are successful, Italy will know how to reward you.\"  \"We seek no reward, sir,\" said Hal quietly. \"Then we are at liberty to go now, sir?\"  \"Yes. I shall not hamper you with instructions.\"  \"All we wish to know, sir,\" said Hal, \"is whether Robard still is at the Austrian embassy.\"  \"He is,\" was the reply, \"and will be until some time to-morrow, when the ambassador will be given his passports.\"  \"Can I be of any assistance?\" asked Colonel Fuesco, stepping forward.  \"If you can, we shall call on you,\" replied Hal.  \"Good,\" said the colonel, and, drawing out a card, he scribbled an address on it. \"You will find me there,\" he said. \"I shall remain at my quarters in the hopes that I may be given a hand in the game.\"  The lads shook hands with the general and walked to the door.  \"Wait a moment, boys,\" said Major Derevaux. \"I want a few words with the general, and then I shall be at liberty to go with you.\"  \"If it is all the same to you, Major Derevaux,\" said the general, \"I would prefer to postpone our conference until this evening. I have several matters that require my immediate attention.\"  Major Derevaux accepted this postponement graciously, and announced that he would accompany the boys at once. As they would have passed out, the general's orderly once more entered the room.  \"The American ambassador is without, sir,\" he said, \"and demands an immediate interview with you.\"  General Ferrari turned to Colonel Fuesco.  \"You see what trouble you have brought down on my head,\" he said, with a smile. \"I won't bother to see the ambassador now,\" he said to his orderly. \"I shall send these lads to greet him.\"  In response to these words, Hal and Chester, accompanied by Major Derevaux and Colonel Fuesco, made their way from the room. In the corridor they encountered the American ambassador and Uncle John. The latter was walking back and forth nervously and muttering angrily to himself.  \"Here we are, Uncle John,\" said Chester.  Uncle John jumped as though he had been shot, for he had not perceived their approach.  \"You young rascals,\" he exclaimed, \"so you have been released, eh?\"  \"Yes,\" said Chester quickly, \"we have been released providing we can really apprehend the man who is the spy.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Uncle John anxiously.  Hal followed Chester's lead, for he wished no obstacle to be put in their path.  \"If we can catch the spy, we shall be permitted to go free,\" he said,  \"I see,\" said Uncle John. \"But I can't see that spy-catching is any of your business.\"  \"Well, we have promised to do the best we can,\" said Chester.  \"In that case, I have nothing to say,\" said Uncle John. \"But remember we are due to sail for home to-morrow.\"  \"Oh, we can wait over for the next ship,\" said Chester.  \"Perhaps,\" said Uncle John, with a twinkle in his eye. \"We shall see what your mothers have to say about that.\"  Hal now bethought himself to introduce Uncle John to his friends. This accomplished, the American ambassador announced that he would be moving, and took his departure. The others Uncle John invited to have lunch with him in a nearby hotel.  Over the table, Hal asked Major Derevaux what he was doing in Rome.  \"I don't know as it is my secret now,\" replied the major. \"I am here with a despatch from General Joffre. I cannot say exactly what the despatch contains, but at a guess I would say it has to do with the entrance of Italy into the war, and plans for a possible simultaneous advance between all the troops opposed to the Austro-German army.\"  \"I see,\" said Hal. \"That would be a great thing. I wish we were going back to the front with you.\"  \"Well, you're not,\" said Uncle John briefly.  \"We won't argue about it,\" said Chester, smiling. \"But you never can tell what will happen.\"  Uncle John changed the subject abruptly. When the conversation reached this stage he always felt uncomfortable.  \"When are you going to start spy-hunting?\" he asked.  Chester looked at Hal.  \"What do you think?\" he inquired.  \"Well, I should say not until to-night,\" replied Hal. \"I don't believe we could do much good in the day time.\"  \"My idea exactly,\" agreed Chester. \"We may have to make a few preparations.\"  \"I would like to go with you boys,\" said Major Derevaux, \"but I fear it will be impossible. I must return immediately I have had my interview with General Ferrari.\"  Uncle John had been sitting silent during all this conversation, but now he straightened in his chair and brought his fist down on the table with a bang.  \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"All this talk makes me feel young again. What's the matter with my joining this expedition?\"  The two lads gazed at him in wonder. Uncle John saw the amazement written on their features.  \"I mean it,\" he continued. \"I want a hand in this game myself. Here, waiter, check!\" he called.  He paid the check and rose from the table.  \"You wait here for me,\" he instructed the boys.  \"Where are you going?\" asked Chester.  \"Going to buy a gun,\" replied Uncle John; \"going to outfit myself to join the spy-hunters.\"  He stalked from the room.     CHAPTER VI.  ON THE TRAIL.   The stars were shining when Hal and Chester, accompanied by Uncle John, made their way from the hotel toward the Austrian legation. Uncle John was chuckling to himself as he walked between his two younger companions.  \"What is so funny, Uncle John?\" asked Chester.  \"I was just thinking what your mothers would say if they knew where we were going,\" was the reply; \"particularly if they knew where I was going. I guess they think I am too old for this foolishness, but I tell you, a man likes to be young again.\"  \"What did you tell mother? Where did you say we were going?\" asked Hal.  \"I told her we were going out--I didn't say where,\" was the answer. \"I'm something of a strategist myself, you know.\"  \"I see you are,\" replied Chester.  \"Now I want you boys to understand that I am under your orders,\" said Uncle John. \"You are older heads at this game than I am. I am willing to obey orders.\"  \"Which is the first essential of every good soldier,\" said Chester quietly.  \"By the way,\" said Uncle John, patting his pocket, \"this is the first time I have had a gun in my hands for a good many years. However, I used to be able to hit the side of a barn. I guess I haven't forgotten. Do you think we shall have to do any shooting?\"  \"I hope not,\" said Hal, \"but you never can tell.\"  Uncle John lapsed into silence and the three made their way along slowly. The hour was early, and, as Hal had said, there was no rush.  \"Have you formed any definite plan?\" asked Chester of Hal, as they walked along.  \"Well, no,\" was the reply. \"We shall have to let events shape themselves.\"  \"Which is the best plan, after all,\" said Chester.  An hour's walk brought them to the embassy building.  \"The first thing,\" said Hal, \"is to find out if Robard is in.\"  \"And how are you going to do that?\" asked Uncle John.  \"Simple,\" replied Hal. \"I'll go up and ask.\"  He approached the door and rang the bell. A servant opened the door.  \"Is Herr Robard in?\" asked Hal in perfect German.  The man shook his head.  \"I have an important message for him,\" said Hal. \"When shall I find him in?\"  The servant glanced at him sharply, then leaned close.  \"Are you the messenger Herr Robard expects?\" he asked, in a low voice.  Hal glanced sharply about him, more for effect than anything else, and replied, speaking softly:  \"From the Wilhelmstrasse.\"  \"Good,\" said the man, nodding his pleasure. \"I am instructed to tell you to come back at a little before ten o'clock.\"  \"Will Herr Robard be here then?\"  \"Possibly not, but you can wait.\"  \"I shall be here,\" said Hal, and walked down the steps.  He rejoined Chester and Uncle John, who had waited around the corner.  \"I was beginning to fear something had happened to you,\" said Uncle John.  \"What luck?\" demanded Chester.  \"Better than could be expected,\" said Hal, and repeated the conversation with the servant.  \"And who do you suppose this messenger is?\" asked Chester.  \"A German secret agent,\" replied Hal decidedly.  \"That was the first thought that flashed through my head when he asked me who I was, which is the reason "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12682"],["title","The Boy Allies in Great Peril; Or, With the Italian Army in the Alps (#5)"],["body","took a long chance and mentioned the Wilhelmstrasse.\"  \"You seem to have hit the nail on the head,\" said Chester.  \"Which was luck,\" said Hal.  \"Or quick wit,\" interposed Uncle John.  \"Well,\" said Chester, \"what next? And what are we to do while you are in the house? Surely you are not expecting that we shall all be admitted?\"  \"No,\" replied Hal, \"and my plan is this: I shall reach the house somewhat earlier than the time set, moving up my watch to avoid suspicion should anything be said. Thus I shall make sure that Robard has not returned. I shall wait.  \"Now, when the servant leaves the room, I shall, in some manner, raise the window facing the spot where you stood while I went up to the door a moment ago. Then you and Uncle John can come in. Of course, I may not be left in that particular room to wait, but I shall manage some way. I'll cover your entrance with my gun.\"  \"Good,\" said Chester, \"but then what? Will you try to take the papers forcibly or by stealth?\"  \"Whichever way seems the most likely to succeed,\" said Hal briefly. \"Something must be left to chance.\"  \"Well,\" said Chester, \"we may as well return to the hotel for a couple of hours. It's early yet.\"  \"Not much,\" said Uncle John. \"I don't want to have to answer any questions. Not me. Let's go some place else.\"  \"We'll walk about, then,\" Hal decided.  This was done.  At fifteen minutes to ten o'clock Hal once more mounted the steps to the Austrian embassy. Chester and Uncle John took their places at the spot agreed upon, and waited.  The same servant opened the door for Hal.  \"You are early,\" he said, somewhat suspiciously it seemed to Hal.  \"Why, no,\" replied the lad, manifesting surprise. \"I am on the dot, as I always am. Ten o'clock.\"  \"But it is not ten yet,\" said the man.  Hal drew out his watch and looked at it.  \"Ten to the minute,\" he said, and held it up so the man could see.  \"Your watch is wrong,\" was the reply. \"However, I suppose it makes no difference. Come in.\"  He held the door open while Hal entered, then closed it.  \"This way,\" he said, and led the way down the hall. Fortunately, he turned into a room facing upon the street where Chester and Uncle John waited without, though it was the room beyond the one beneath the window of which they stood. But, Hal noticed, there was a door between the two rooms.  \"Ought to be easy enough,\" he told himself.  \"You can wait here for Herr Robard,\" said the servant, and moved to withdraw.  \"This is the Herr Robard's private office, I take it,\" said Hal.  \"You are wrong,\" was the reply. \"His office is just across the hall. But no one is allowed to enter there unless the Herr is with him, and the door is always locked.\"  \"I see,\" said Hal, mentally thanking the man for the information, which had come a great deal easier than he had expected. \"The Herr is a careful man. It is as it should be.\"  \"You can make yourself at home here until he comes,\" said the servant. \"There are magazines and books. I have other matters to attend to.\"  \"All right,\" said Hal, for he now wished to get rid of the man without more loss of time; he had gained all the information he could hope for without laying himself open to suspicion.  The man withdrew. Hal glanced at his watch.  \"Ten-five,\" he muttered. \"That means ten minutes to ten. Robard may come sooner than expected. I must hurry.\"  Quietly he arose and silently crossed the room. He tried the knob to the door of the next room. The door was locked. He glanced down. There was a key in the lock, and it turned easily. Hal unlocked the door and passed into the room beyond.  Quickly he crossed to the window, and then paused a moment, listening attentively. There was no sound. Unfastening the catch, the lad raised the window gently. It went up without so much as a sound. Hal poked his head out, and called in a low voice:  \"All right.\"  He stepped back and drew his revolver and took his place in the shadow, commanding a view of both doors to the room.  He heard faint sounds without, and concluded rightly that Chester was giving Uncle John a hand up. A moment later Uncle John's head appeared at the window, and he clambered into the room. He was unable to see Hal in the darkness and called:  \"Where are you, Hal?\"  \"Sh--h--h!\" whispered Hal. \"Come over here.\"  Uncle John obeyed silently.  There came a whistle from without. Hal recognized it as that of Chester. He hurried to the window and peered out.  \"What's the matter?\" he called.  \"The window is too high, I can't reach the sill,\" was the reply. \"Give me a hand.\"  Hal started to lay down his gun and lend a hand, but thought better of it. He called to Uncle John.  \"Help Chester up,\" he whispered, and again took his position guarding the doors, with drawn revolver.  Uncle John approached the window and leaned out. He seized Chester's uplifted hand, and pulled. A moment later Chester came scrambling through the window.  \"A pretty good climb, if you ask me,\" he said.  At that moment the door from the hall was thrown open, and a man appeared in the doorway. In his hand he held a revolver, which he pointed straight at Uncle John and Chester, who stood in plain sight before the window.  \"Hands up!\" he called.  There was nothing for it but to obey. Uncle John's and Chester's hands went high in the air.  Hal, well back from the light which streamed through the open door and the window, slunk further back in the darkness. He was unnoticed, and he knew that he held the whip hand.  \"So,\" said the man in the doorway, \"burglars, eh? Well, I shall attend to your cases.\"  With revolver levelled in a steady hand he advanced further into the room.     CHAPTER VII.  UNCLE JOHN IN TROUBLE.   A few paces in front of Chester and Uncle John the newcomer paused.  \"Armed?\" he asked.  Chester made no reply. Uncle John remained silent.  \"We'll see,\" said the newcomer briefly.  Still covering them with his weapon, he put his free hand in Chester's pocket and relieved the lad of his revolver. A similar operation and Uncle John's gun came forth. Uncle John could keep quiet no longer.  \"There goes my gun,\" he said sorrowfully.  In spite of the seriousness of the situation Chester was forced to laugh.  \"Don't worry; you'll get it back,\" he replied.  \"You think so, eh?\" sneered the newcomer. \"Tell me,\" addressing Chester, \"what are you doing here?\"  \"That's for you to find out,\" replied the lad.  \"Well, I'll find out,\" exclaimed the man. \"Do you know who I am?\"  \"Why, yes; your name is Robard, isn't it?\"  The other stepped back in surprise.  \"So you know me, eh!\" he exclaimed. \"Then you are not burglars.\"  \"Hardly,\" replied Chester.  \"Then what are you doing here?\"  \"I can't see that it will do any harm to tell you,\" was Chester's answer. \"We are after the paper you stole from Colonel Fuesco to-day.\"  \"Oho! And by any chance are you the same youngster I encountered in the street?\"  \"The same,\" replied Chester briefly.  \"And where is the other? Surely,\" peering closely at Uncle John, \"you are not he. He was younger.\"  \"Right you are,\" replied Uncle John. \"But I guess he'll turn up when he is most needed.\"  \"You think so? Then he had better turn up quickly.\" He turned again to Chester. \"So you came after the paper,\" he said. \"I am very sorry to say that you will not get it.\"  \"Then you have sent it to Vienna,\" said Chester, somewhat crestfallen.  \"Oh, no, I still have it right here,\" and Robard tapped the breast pocket of his coat.  \"Thanks,\" said Chester. \"I just wanted to know where you kept it.\"  \"I suppose you think you are very smart,\" said the Austrian, somewhat angry at having betrayed himself.  \"Smart enough, I guess,\" returned Chester.  \"Come, I have had enough of this,\" exclaimed the Austrian. \"Hold your hands up now, and march out of this room ahead of me.\"  He waved his revolver from one to the other, and stepped aside that the two might pass ahead of him. Uncle John and Chester obeyed his injunction and moved toward the door. The Austrian took a step after them.  It was at this moment that Hal came into action.  With a sudden spring he leaped upon the Austrian from behind. With one hand he seized the wrist that held the revolver, and turned it upward. With the other he clutched the man by the throat, shutting off his wind and preventing him from crying out. Hal called to Chester:  \"Grab him!\"  Chester and Uncle John wheeled about and lent a hand in subduing the Austrian. Three against one, it was easy work, and after a short struggle Robard lay panting on the floor. Hal drew his own revolver and covered him.  \"One move and you are a dead man,\" he said quietly.  Robard glared up at him angrily. Chester smiled at him pleasantly.  \"You see I am smarter than you gave me credit for,\" he said.  The Austrian made no response.  \"He keeps the paper in his pocket, Hal,\" said Chester.  \"So I heard him say,\" replied Hal.  He bent over the Austrian and thrust a hand into his pocket. He pulled forth a batch of papers, and walking over to the window, ran through them hurriedly.  \"Find it?\" asked Chester, walking over to him.  Hal extended a paper.  \"I guess this is it, all right,\" he said, and thrust the document into his pocket.  At that moment there came a startled cry from Uncle John, followed by a heavy thud. Hal and Chester wheeled quickly, just in time to see Robard disappearing through the door, which closed after him with a bang. A key turned in the lock. The thud they had heard was Uncle John toppling to the floor as the result of a blow delivered by the Austrian, who, catching Uncle John off his guard, had sprung to his feet and attacked him.  Hal jumped to the door, while Chester bent over Uncle John and assisted him to his feet.  \"The scoundrel!\" exclaimed Uncle John. \"He took me by surprise. He gave me no warning.\"  \"Surely you didn't expect him to,\" said Chester, somewhat angry.  Hal sprang to Chester's side.  \"Quick!\" he exclaimed. \"We must get out of here. Robard will have assistance in a moment.\"  \"Which way? Out the window?\" asked"]]]
