The basis of it is the history of the House of Hohenzollern, with volumes devoted to the Danish and Austrian campaigns and minute descriptions of every phase of all the battles with France in 1870, written in a curious hysterical fashion.  The admixture of Biblical references and German boasting are typical of the lessons taught at German Sunday Schools, which play a great role in war propaganda.  The schoolmaster having done his work for six days of the week, the pastor gives an extra virulent dose on the Sabbath.  Sedan Day, which before the war was the culmination of hate lessons, often formed the occasion of Sunday School picnics, at which the children sang new anti-French songs.  There are some traits in German children most likeable.  There are, for example, the respect for, and courtesy and kindness towards, anybody older than themselves.   There are admiration for learning and ambition to excel in any particular task.  There is a genuine love of music.  On the other hand, there is much dishonesty, as may be witnessed by the proceedings in the German police courts, and has been proved in the gold and other collections.  The elimination of real religion in the education of children and the substitution of worship of the State is, in the minds of many impartial observers, something approaching a national catastrophe. In any other community it would probably be accompanied by anarchy. It certainly has swelled the calendar of German crime.  German statistics prove that every sort of horror has been greatly on the increase in the last quarter of a century.  I went to Germany the first time under the impression that the Anglo-Saxon had much to learn from German education.  I do not think that any observer in Germany itself to-day would find anything valuable to learn in the field of education, except when the German student comes to the time he takes up scientific research, to which the German mind, with its intense industry and regard for detail, is so eminently suited.  The German Government gives these young students every advantage.  They are not, as with us, obliged to start money-making as soon as they leave school.  As a rule a German boy's career is marked out for him by his parents and the schoolmaster at a very early age.  If he is to follow out any one of the thousand branches of chemical research dealing with coal-tar products, for example, he knows his fate at fourteen or fifteen, and his eye is rarely averted from his goal until he has achieved knowledge and experience likely to help him in the great German trade success which has followed their utilisation of applied science.     CHAPTER IV  PULPITS OF HATE  The unpleasant part played by the clergy, and especially the Lutheran pastors, needs to be explained to those who regard clerics as necessarily men of peace.  The claim that the Almighty is on the side of Germany is not a new one.  It was made as far back as the time of Frederick the Great. It was advanced in the war of 1870.  It found strong voice at the time of the Boer War, when the pastors issued a united manifesto virulently attacking Great Britain.  These pastors are in communication with the German-American Lutherans in the United States, who exerted their influence to the utmost against the election of President Wilson, taking their instructions indirectly from the German Foreign Office.  The state of affairs in the German churches is so different from anything on the other side of the Atlantic, and in Great Britain, that it is almost as difficult to make people in England understand war-preaching ministers as it is to make them comprehend war-teaching schoolmasters.  My description of the poisoning by hate songs of the child mind of Germany at its most impressionable age came as a shock to many of my readers.  But the hate songs of the children are not as fierce as the hate hymns and prayers of the pastors.  Do the public here realise that of the original Zeppelin fund hundreds of thousands of marks were subscribed in churches and chapels, and that models of Zeppelins have formed portions of church decorations at festivals?  The pastors of the Prussian State Church are in one important respect the exact opposite of Martin Luther.  He was thoroughly independent in spirit and rebelled against authority; they are abjectly submissive to it.  As with the professor, so with the pastor, it is no mere accident that he is a puppet-tool of the State.  The German Government leaves nothing to chance, and realising to the fullest the importance of docile and unified subjects both for interior rule and exterior conquest, it deliberately and artfully regulates those who create public opinion.  There are some Lutheran pastors in Germany who work for an ideal, who detest the propagation of hate.  Why, one may naturally ask, do they not cry out against such a pernicious practice?  They cannot, for they are muzzled.  When a pastor enters this Church of which the Supreme War Lord is the head, his first oath is unqualified allegiance to his King and State.  If he keeps his oath he can preach no reform, for the State, being a perfect institution, can have no flaw.  If he breaks his oath, which happens when he raises his voice in the slightest criticism, he is silenced.  This means that he must seek other means of earning a livelihood--a thing almost impossible in a land where training casts a man in a rigid mould.  Thus these parsons have their choice between going on quietly with their work and being nonentities in the public eye or bespattering the non-Germanic section of the world with the mire of hate.  I regret to say that most of them choose the latter course.  While I was in Germany I read a lengthy and solicitous letter from Pastor Winter, of Bruch, addressed to Admiral von Tirpitz, who had just retired for the ostensible reason that he was unwell, but whose illness was patently only diplomatic.  The good pastor expressed the hope that his early recovery would permit the admiral to continue his noble work of obliterating England.  Pastor Falk, of Berlin, is a typical fire-eater.  His Whitsuntide address was an attack upon Anglo-Saxon civilisation and the urgent German mission of smashing Britain and America.  The Easter sermons of hate, one of which I heard at Stettin, were especially bloodthirsty. Congregations are larger than usual on that day, which is intended to commemorate a spirit quite the opposite to hate.  The clergy are instructed not to attack Prance or Russia, and so it comes about that, as I have previously pointed out, in Prussia, Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein, Brandenburg, and Saxony, the pastors of the State Church preach hatred of Britain, as violently in their pulpits as in their pastoral visits.  The pulpit orators, taking their tip from the Government, are also exhorting their congregations to \"hold out and win the war.\"  I know of one pastor in a good section of Berlin, however, who has recently lost considerable influence in his congregation.  Sunday after Sunday his text has been, \"Wir mussen durchhalten!\" (We must hold out!)  \"No sacrifice should be too great for the Fatherland, no privation, too arduous to be endured if one but has the spirit to conquer.\"  He paid particular attention to the rapidly increasing number of people who grumble incessantly over the shortage of food.  The good man was clearly losing patience with those who complained.  One day thieves broke into his home and got away with an enormous amount of hams and other edibles.  I remind the reader that ham had ere this become unknown in Berlin.  Less than three hundred pigs were being killed there per week where formerly twenty-five thousand were slaughtered.  The Government had more-over taken a house-to-house inventory of food, and hoarding had been made punishable by law.  The story, of course, never appeared in the papers, since such divines are useful implements of the State, but the whole congregation heard of it, with the disastrous consequence that the good man's future sermons on self-denial fell upon stony ground.  One dear old lady, a widow, whose two sons had fallen in the war, told me that she had not gone to church for years, but after her second son fell she sought spiritual comfort in attending services every Sunday.  \"I am so lonesome now,\" she said, \"and somehow I feel that when I hear the word of God I shall be nearer to my boys.\"  I met her some weeks later on her way home from church.  \"It is no use,\" she sighed, shaking her head sadly, \"the church does not satisfy the longing in my heart.  It is not for such as me. Nothing but war, war, war, and hate, hate, hate!\"  The German Navy League, an aggressive body which had gathered around it more than a million members previous to the war, stirred up anti-British feeling by means of leaflets, newspaper articles, kinematograph exhibitions, and sermons.  Among the bitterest of the preachers are returned missionaries from British possessions.  Although the social position of the pastor in a German village is less than that of a minor Government official, yet he and his wife wield considerable influence.  The leading pastors receive each week many of the Government propaganda documents, including a digest carefully prepared for them by the foreign Press Department. I obtained some copies of this weekly digest, but was unable to bring them out of Germany.  What purport to be extracts from the London newspapers are ingenious distortions.  Sometimes a portion of an article is reprinted with the omission of the context, thus entirely altering its meaning.  The recipients of this carefully prepared sheet believe implicitly in its authenticity.  Any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12418"],["title","The Land of Deepening Shadow: Germany-at-War (#5)"],["body","remark of a political nobody in the House of Commons that seems favourable to Germany is quoted extensively.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in the eyes of the German village clergyman, ranks as one of the most important men in the British Empire.  Mr. Stanton, M.P., in their view, is a low hireling of the British Government, doing dirty work in the hope of getting political preferment.  The _Labour Leader_, which I have not seen in any house or hotel or on any newspaper stall, is, according to this digest, one of the leading English newspapers, and almost the only truth-telling organ of the Allies.  These people really believe this.  When home-staying Englishmen talk to me about the German War party, I find it difficult to explain to them that the German War party is practically the whole country.  One or two better-travelled and better-educated pastors have expressed mild regret at the bloodthirsty attitude of their brethren in private conversation.  But I never heard of one who had the courage to \"speak out in open meeting.\"  The modern, material Germany has not much use for religion except as a factor in government.  The notorious spread of extreme agnosticism in the last quarter of a century renders it essential for the clergy to hold their places by stooping to the violence of the Professors.  Mixed with their attitude of hostility to Britain is a considerable amount of professional jealousy and envy.  A number of German pastors paid a visit to London some two or three years before the outbreak of war, and I happened to meet one of them recently in Germany.  So far from being impressed by what he had seen there, he had come to the conclusion that the English clergy, and especially the Nonconformists, were an overpaid, and undisciplined body, with no other aim than their personal comfort. He had visited Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's, Spurgeon's Tabernacle, the City Temple, and had studied--so he told me--English Wesleyanism and, Congregationalism in several provincial centres.  He was particularly bitter about one Nonconformist who had accepted a large salary to go to the United States.  He returned to Germany impressed with the idea that the Nonconformist and State Churches alike were a body of sycophants, sharing the general decadent state of the English.  What struck him principally was what he referred to continually as the lack of discipline and uniformity.  Each man seemed to take his own point of view, without any regard to the opinions of the particular religious denomination to which he belonged.  All were grossly ignorant of science and chemistry, and all were very much overpaid. Here, I think, lay the sting of his envy, and it is part of the general jealousy of England, a country where everybody is supposed to be underworked and overpaid.  The only worse country in this respect from the German point of view is the United States, \"where even the American Lutheran pastors have fallen victims to the lust for money.\"  The particular Lutheran of whom I am speaking had been the guest of an English Nonconformist minister and his wife, who had evidently tried to be as hospitable as possible, and had no doubt put themselves out to take him for excursions and outings in the Shakespeare country.  \"It was nothing but eating and drinking and sightseeing,\" remarked the Herr Pastor.  I suggested that he was a guest, to be looked after.  \"I can assure you,\" he replied, \"that Mr. ------ had nothing to do all day but read the newspapers, and drink tea with his congregation.  He did not take the trouble to grow his own vegetables, and all he had to do was to preach on Sundays and attend a very unruly Sunday school.  His wife, too, was not dressed as one of ours.\"  He explained to me that his own life was very different.  He eked out his minute salary by a small scientifically managed farm, and I gathered the impression that he was much more of a farmer than a pastor, for he deplored his inability to obtain imported nitrates owing to the blockade.  The only question on which he was at all unorthodox was that of the Junkers and their regrettable power of holding potatoes, pigs, and other supplies while small men like him had been obliged to sell.  He had a good collection of modern scientific agricultural works, of which the Germans have an abundance.  But while admiring the energy of the great capitalists and the rational Liberal Party, the average clergyman tends towards sympathy with the Agrarians.  The pastor of the small towns and villages, who is very much under the thumb of the local Junker or rich manufacturer, has as his highest ambition the hope that he and his wife may be invited to coffee at least twice a year.  The pastor's wife is delighted to be condescendingly received by the great lady.  Herr Pastor talks agriculture with Herr Baron, and Frau Pastor discusses past and coming incidents in the local birth rate with Frau Baron.  Snobbery has no greater exemplification than in the relations of the local Lutheran pastor and the local landlord or millionaire.  A sidelight on German mentality is contained in a little conversation which I had with a clergyman in the Province of Posen. He knew England well, by residence and by matrimonial connections.  This is how he explained the battle of the Somme.  I give his own words:--  \"Many wounded men are coming back to our Church from the dreadful Western front.  They have been fighting the British, and they find that so ignorant are the British of warfare that the British soldiers on the Somme refuse to surrender, not knowing that they are really beaten, with the result that terrible losses are inflicted upon our brave troops.\"  In this exact report of a conversation is summed up a great deal of German psychology.  For the Salvation Army a number of Germans have genuine respect, because it seems to be organised on some military basis.  The Church of England they consider as degenerate as the Nonconformist. Both, they think, are mere refuges for money-making ecclesiastics.     CHAPTER V  PUPPET PROFESSORS  The professor, like the army officer, has long been a semi-deity in Germany.  Not only in his university lectures does he influence the students, and particularly the prospective teachers of secondary schools who hang on his words, but he writes the bulk of the historical, economic and political literature of the daily Press, the magazines and the tons of pamphlets which flood the country.  Years before the war the Government corralled him for its own.  It gave him social status, in return for which he would do his part to make the citizen an unquestioning, faithful and obedient servant of the State.  As soon as he enters on his duties he becomes a civil servant, since the universities are State institutions.  He takes an oath in which it is stipulated that he will not write or preach or do anything questioning the ways of the State.  His only way to make progress in life, then, is to serve the State, to preach what it wishes preached, to teach history as it wishes history taught.  The history of Prussia is the history of the House of Hohenzollern, and the members of the House, generation after generation, must all be portrayed a& heroes.  There was a striking illustration of this in 1913 when the Kaiser had Hauptmann's historical play suppressed because it represented Frederick William III. in true light, as putty in the hands of Napoleon.  There is a small group of German professors interested solely in scientific research, such as Professor Roentgen and the late Professor Ehrlich, which we exclude from the \"puppet professors.\" Such men succeed through sheer ability and their results are their diplomas before the world.  Neither shoulder-knots nor medals pinned in rows across their breasts would contribute one iota to their success, nor make that success the more glittering once it is achieved.  One of these, a Bavarian of the old school, a thoughtful, liberal man who had travelled widely, told me that he deplored the depths of mental slavery to which the mass of the German professors had sunk.  \"They are living on the reputation made by us scientists,\" he declared.  \"They write volumes and they go about preaching through the land, but they contribute nothing, absolutely nothing, to the uplifting of humanity and of the country.\"  He told me of how Government spies before the war and during it watch professors who are suspected of having independent ways of thought, and for the slightest \"offence\" such as being in the audience of a Social Democratic lecture (this before the war, of course; such meetings are forbidden now) they are put on the official black-list and promotion is closed to them for ever.  In warring Germany I found professors vying with one another to sow hatred among the people, to show that Germany is always right, and that she is fighting a war of defence, which she tried to avoid by every means in her power, and that any methods employed to crush Great Britain, the real instigator of the attack on Germany, are good methods.  With the pastors, they spread the idea that \"Germany is the rock selected by Almighty God upon which to build His Empire.\"  J. P. Bang, the able Danish Professor of Theology at the University of Copenhagen, writes clearly on this point.  He says, when describing Emanuel Geibel:--  \"He has succeeded in finding the classical formula for the German arrogance, which of necessity demands that Germanism shall be placed above everything else in the world, and at the same time in giving this arrogance such an expression that it shall not conflict with the German demand for moral justification.  This has been achieved in the lines which have been quoted times without number in the newest German war literature:    Und es mag am deutschen Wesen   Einmal noch die Welt genesen!   (The world may yet again be healed by Germanism.)  \"The hope here expressed has become a certainty for modern Germany, and the Germans see in this the moral"]]]
