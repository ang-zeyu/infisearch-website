I like the country; it isn't as if I came here to take something away. I came to add my mite; to help build up, not to tear down. And I can't understand the attitude of men who would maliciously--\"  \"It's kinda got to be part uh the scenery to josh a pilgrim,\" Billy took the trouble to explain. \"We don't mean any harm. I reckon you'll get along all right, once yuh get wised up.\"  \"Do you expect to be in town for any length of time?\" Mr. Dill's voice was wistful, as well as his eyes. \"Somehow, you don't seem to adopt that semi-hostile attitude, and I--I'm very glad for the opportunity of knowing you.\"  Charming Billy made a rapid mental calculation of his present financial resources and of past experience in the rate of depletion.  \"Well. I may last a week or so, and I might pull out to-morrow,\" he decided candidly. \"It all depends on the kinda luck I have.\"  Mr. Dill looked at him inquiringly, but he made no remark that would betray curiosity. \"I have rented a room in a little house in the quietest part of town. The hotel isn't very clean and there is too much noise and drinking going on at night. I couldn't sleep there. I should be glad to have you share my room with me while you stay in town, if you will. It is clean and quiet.\"  Charming Billy turned his head and looked at him queerly; at his sloping shoulders, melancholy face and round, wistful eyes, and finally at the awkward, hunched-up knees of him. Billy did not mind night noises and drinking--to be truthful, they were two of the allurements which had brought him townward--and whether a room were clean or not troubled him little; he would not see much of it. His usual procedure while in town would, he suspected, seem very loose to Alexander P. Dill. It consisted chiefly of spending the nights where the noise clamored loudest and of sleeping during the day--sometimes--where was the most convenient spot to lay the length of him. He smiled whimsically at the contrast between them and their habits of living.  \"Much obliged,\" he said. \"I expect to be some busy, but maybe I'll drop in and bed down with yuh; once I hit town, it's hard to tell what I may do.\"  \"I hope you'll feel perfectly free to come at any time and make yourself at home,\" Mr. Dill urged lonesomely.  \"Sure. There's the old burg--I do plumb enjoy seeing the sun making gold on a lot uh town windows, like that over there. It sure looks good, when you've been living by your high lonesome and not seeing any window shine but your own little six-by-eight. Huh?\"  \"I--I must admit I like better to see the sunset turn my own windows to gold,\" observed Mr. Dill softly. \"I haven't any, now; I sold the old farm when mother died. I was born and raised there. The woods pasture was west of the house, and every evening when I drove up the cows, and the sun was setting, the kitchen windows--\"  Alexander P. Dill stopped very abruptly, and Billy, stealing a glance at his face, turned his own quickly away and gazed studiously at a bald hilltop off to the left. So finely tuned was his sympathy that for one fleeting moment he saw a homely, hilly farm in Michigan, with rail fences and a squat old house with wide porch and hard-beaten path from the kitchen door to the well and on to the stables; and down a long slope that was topped with great old trees, Alexander P. Dill shambling contentedly, driving with a crooked stick three mild-mannered old cows. \"The blamed chump--what did he go and pull out for?\" he asked himself fretfully. Then aloud: \"I'm going to have a heart-to-heart talk with the cook at the hotel, and if he don't give us a real old round-up beefsteak, flopped over on the bare stovelids, there'll be things happen I'd hate to name over. He can sure do the business, all right; he used to cook for the Double-Crank. And you,\" he turned, elaborately cheerful, to Mr. Dill, \"you are my guest.\"  \"Thank you,\" smiled Mr. Dill, recovering himself and never guessing how strange was the last sentence to the lips of Charming Billy Boyle. \"I shall be very glad to be the guest of somebody--once more.\"  \"Yuh poor old devil, yuh sure drifted a long ways off your home range,\" mused Billy. Out loud he only emphasized the arrangement with:  \"Sure thing!\"     CHAPTER VI.  \"_That's My Dill Pickle!_\"   Charming Billy Boyle was, to put it mildly, enjoying his enforced vacation very much. To tell the plain truth and tell it without the polish of fiction, he was hilariously moistened as to his gullet and he was not thinking of quitting yet; he had only just begun.  He was sitting on an end of the bar in the Hardtip Saloon, his hat as far back on his head as it could possibly be pushed with any hope of its staying there at all. He had a glass in one hand, a cigarette in the other, and he was raking his rowels rhythmically up and down the erstwhile varnished bar in buzzing accompaniment, the while he chanted with much enthusiasm:       \"How old is she, Billy boy, Billy boy?      How old is she, charming Billy?        Twice six, twice seven,        Forty-nine and eleven--\"  The bartender, wiping the bar after an unsteady sheepherder, was careful to leave a generous margin around the person of Charming Billy who was at that moment asserting with much emphasis:       \"She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother.\"  \"Twice-six's-twelve, 'n' twice-seven's-four-r-teen, 'n' twelve 'n' fourteen's--er--twelve--'n'--fourteen--\" The unsteady sheepherder was laboring earnestly with the problem. \"She ain't no spring chicken, she ain't!\" He laughed tipsily, and winked up at the singer, but Billy was not observing him and his mathematical struggles. He refreshed himself from the glass, leaving the contents perceptibly lower--it was a large, thick glass with a handle, and it had flecks of foam down the inside--took a pull at the cigarette and inquired plaintively:       \"Can she brew, can she bake, Billy boy, Billy boy?      Can she brew, can she bake, charming Billy?\"  Another long pull at the cigarette, and then the triumphant declaration:       \"She can brew n' she can bake,      She can sew n' she can make--      She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother.\"  \"She ain't s' young!\" bawled the sheepherder, who was taking it all very seriously. \"Say them numbers over again, onc't. Twelve-'n'-fourteen--\"  \"Aw, go off and lay down!\" advised Charming Billy, in a tone of deep disgust. He was about to pursue still farther his inquiry into the housewifely qualifications of the mysterious \"young thing,\" and he hated interruptions.       \"Can she make a punkin pie, Billy boy, Billy boy?      Can she make a punkin pie, charming Billy?\"  The door opened timidly and closed again, but he did not see who entered. He was not looking; he was holding the empty, foam-flecked glass behind him imperatively, and he was watching over his shoulder to see that the bartender did not skimp the filling and make it two-thirds foam. The bartender was punctiliously lavish, so that a crest of foam threatened to deluge the hand of Charming Billy and quite occupied him for the moment. When he squared himself again and buzzed his spurs against the bar, his mind was wholly given to the proper execution of the musical gem.       \"She can make a punkin pie,      Quick's a cat can wink her eye--\"  Something was going on, over in the dimly lighted corner near the door. Half a dozen men had grouped themselves there with their backs to Billy and they were talking and laughing; but the speech of them was an unintelligible clamor and their laughter a commingling roar. Billy gravely inspected his cigarette, which had gone cold, set down the glass and sought diligently for a match.  \"Aw, come on an' have one on me!\" bawled a voice peremptorily. \"Yuh can't raise no wild cattle around _this_ joint, lessen yuh wet up good with whisky. Why, a feller as long as you be needs a good jolt for every foot of yuh--and that's about fifteen when you're lengthened out good. Come on--don't be a damn' chubber! Yuh got to sample m' hospitality. Hey, Tom! set out about a quart uh your _mildest_ for Daffy-down-Dilly. He's dry, clean down to his hand-made socks.\"  Charming Billy, having found a match, held it unlighted in his fingers and watched the commotion from his perch on the bar. In the very midst of the clamor towered the melancholy Alexander P. Dill, and he was endeavoring to explain, in his quiet, grammatical fashion. A lull that must have been an accident carried the words clearly across to Charming Billy.  \"Thank you, gentlemen. I really don't care for anything in the way of refreshment. I merely came in to find a friend who has promised to spend the night with me. It is getting along toward bedtime. Have your fun, gentlemen, if you must--but I am really too tired to join you.\"  \"Make 'im dance!\" yelled the sheepherder, giving over the attempt to find the sum of twelve and fourteen. \"By gosh, yuh made _me_ dance when I struck town. Make 'im dance!\"  \"You go off and lay down!\" commanded Billy again, and to emphasize his words leaned and emptied the contents of his glass neatly inside the collar of the sheepherder. \"Cool down, yuh Ba-ba-black-sheep!\"  The herder forgot everything after that--everything but the desire to tear limb from limb one Charming Billy Boyle, who sat and raked his spurs up and down the marred front of the bar and grinned maliciously down at him. \"Go-awn off, before I take yuh all to pieces,\" he urged wearily, already regretting the unjustifiable waste of good beer. \"Quit your buzzing; I wanta listen over there.\"  \"Come on 'n' have a drink!\" vociferated the hospitable one. \"Yuh got to be sociable, or yuh can't stop in _this_ man's town.\" So insistent was he that he laid violent hold of Mr. Dill and tried to pull him bodily to the bar.  \"Gentlemen, this passes a joke!\" protested Mr. Dill, looking around him in his blankly melancholy way. \"I do not drink liquor. I must insist upon your stopping this horseplay"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],["title","The Long Shadow (#7)"],["body","y!\"  \"Oh, it ain't no _play_,\" asserted the insistent one darkly. \"I mean it, by thunder.\"  It was at this point that Charming Billy decided to have a word. \"Here, break away, there!\" he yelled, pushing the belligerent sheepherder to one side. \"Hands off that long person! That there's _my_ dill pickle!\"  [Illustration: \"HANDS OFF THAT LONG PERSON! THAT THERE'S _MY_ DILL PICKLE.\"]  Mr. Dill was released, and Billy fancied hazily that it was because he so ordered; as a matter of fact, Mr. Dill, catching sight of him there, had thrown the men and their importunities off as though they had been rough-mannered boys. He literally plowed his way through them and stopped deprecatingly before Billy.  \"It is getting late,\" he observed, mildly reproachful. \"I thought I would show you the way to my room, if you don't mind.\"  Billy stared down at him. \"Well, I'm going to be busy for a while yet,\" he demurred. \"I've got to lick this misguided son-of-a-gun that's blatting around wanting to eat me alive--and I got my eyes on your friend in the rear, there, that's saying words about you, Dilly. Looks to me like I'm going to be some occupied for quite a spell. You run along to bed and don't yuh bother none about _me_.\"  \"The matter is not so urgent but what I can wait until you are ready,\" Mr. Dill told him quietly, but with decision. He folded his long arms and ranged himself patiently alongside Billy. And Billy, regarding him uneasily, felt convinced that though he tarried until the sun returned Mr. Dill would stand right there and wait--like a well-broken range-horse when the reins are dropped to the ground. Charming Billy did not know why it made him uncomfortable, but it did and he took immediate measures to relieve the sensation.  He turned fretfully and cuffed the clamorous sheepherder, who seemed to lack the heart for actual hostilities but indulged in much recrimination and was almost in tears. \"Aw, shut up!\" growled Billy. \"A little more uh that war-talk and I'll start in and learn yuh some manners. I don't want any more of it. Yuh hear?\"  It is a fact that trifles sometimes breed large events. Billy, to make good his threat, jumped off the bar. In doing so he came down upon the toes of Jack Morgan, the hospitable soul who had insisted upon treating Mr. Dill and who had just come up to renew the argument. Jack Morgan was a man of uncertain temper and he also had toes exceedingly tender. He struck out, missed Billy, who was thinking only of the herder, and it looked quite as though the blow was meant for Mr. Dill.  After that, things happened quickly and with some confusion. Others became active, one way or the other, and the clamor was great, so that it was easily heard down the street and nearly emptied the other saloons.  When the worst of it was over and one could tell for a certainty what was taking place, Charming Billy was holding a man's face tightly against the bar and was occasionally beating it with his fist none too gently. Mr. Dill, an arm's length away, had Jack Morgan and one other offender clutched by the neck in either hand and he was solemnly and systematically butting their heads together until they howled. The bartender had just succeeded in throwing the sheepherder out through the back door, and he was wiping his hands and feeling very well satisfied with himself.  \"I'd oughta fired him long ago, when he first commenced building trouble,\" he remarked, to no one in particular. \"The darned lamb-licker--he's broke and has been all evening. I don't know what made me stand for 'im long as I did.\"  Billy, moved perhaps by weariness rather than mercy, let go his man and straightened up, feeling mechanically for his hat. His eyes met those of the melancholy Mr. Dill.  \"If you're quite through\"--bang! went the heads--\"perhaps we may as well\"--bang!--\"leave this unruly crowd\"--bang!!--\"and go to our room. It is after eleven o'clock.\" Mr. Dill looked as though his present occupation was unpleasant but necessary and as though, to please Billy, he could keep it up indefinitely.  Charming Billy stood quite still, staring at the other and at what he was doing; and while he stared and wondered, something came into the heart of him and quite changed his destiny. He did not know what it was, or why it was so; at the time he realized only a deep amazement that Mr. Dill, mild of manner, correct of speech and wistful-eyed, should be standing there banging the heads of two men who were considered rather hard to handle. Certainly Jack Morgan was reputed a \"bad actor\" when it came to giving blows. And while Alexander P. Dill was a big man--an enormous man, one might say--he had none of the earmarks of a fighting man. It was, perhaps, his very calmness that won Billy for good and all. Before, Charming Billy had felt toward him a certain amused pity; his instinct had been to protect Mr. Dill. He would never feel just that way again; Mr. Dill, it would seem, was perfectly well able to protect himself.  \"Shall we go?\" Mr. Dill poised the two heads for another bang and held them so. By this time every one in the room was watching, but he had eyes only for Billy.  \"Just as you say,\" Billy assented submissively.  Mr. Dill shook the two with their faces close together, led them to a couple of chairs and set them emphatically down. \"Now, see if you can behave yourselves,\" he advised, in the tone a father would have used toward two refractory boys. \"You have been acting boorishly and disgracefully all evening. It was you who directed me wrong, to-day. You have not, at any time since I first met you, acted like gentlemen; I should be sorry to think this country held many such brainless louts.\" He turned inquiringly toward Charming Billy and nodded his head toward the door. Billy, stooping unsteadily for his hat which he discovered under his feet, followed him meekly out.     CHAPTER VII.  \"_Till Hell's a Skating-rink._\"   Charming Billy opened his eyes slowly, but with every sense at the normal degree of alertness; which was a way he had, born of light sleeping and night-watching. He had slept heavily, from the feel of his head, and he remembered the unwisdom of drinking four glasses of whisky and then changing irresponsibly to beer. He had not undressed, it would seem, and he was lying across the middle of a bed with his spurred boots hanging over the edge. A red comforter had been thrown across him, and he wondered why. He looked around the room and discovered Mr. Dill seated in a large, cane rocker--which was unquestionably not big enough for his huge person--his feet upon another chair and his hands folded inertly on his drawn-up knees. He was asleep, with his head lying against the chair-back and his face more melancholy than ever and more wistful. His eyes, Billy observed, were deep-sunk and dark-ringed. He sat up suddenly--did Billy, and threw off the cover with some vehemence. \"Darn me for a drunken chump!\" he exclaimed, and clanked over to the chair.  \"Here, Dilly\"--to save the life of him he could not refrain from addressing him so--\"why in thunder didn't yuh kick me awake, and make me get off your bed? What did yuh let me do it for--and you setting up all night--oh, this is sure a hell of a note!\"  Mr. Dill opened his eyes, stared blankly and came back from his dreaming. \"You were so--so impatient when I tried to get you up,\" he explained in a tired voice. \"And you had a way of laying your hands on your revolver when I insisted. It seems you took me for a shepherd and were very unfriendly; so I thought it best to let you stay as you were, but I'm afraid you were not very comfortable. One can rest so much better between sheets. You would not,\" he added plaintively, \"even permit me to take your boots off for you.\"  Charming Billy sat down upon the edge of the bed, all tousled as he was, and stared abstractedly at Mr. Dill. Perhaps he had never before felt so utterly disgusted with himself, or realized so keenly his shortcomings. Not even the girl had humbled him so completely as had this long, lank, sinfully grammatical man from Michigan.  \"You've sure got me where I live, Dilly,\" he said slowly and haltingly, feeling mechanically for the makings of a smoke. \"Charming Billy Boyle ain't got a word to say for himself. But if yuh ain't plumb sick and disgusted with the spectacle I've made uh myself, yuh can count on me till hell's a skating-rink. I ain't always thisaway. I do have spells when I'm some lucid.\"  It was not much, but such as it was it stood for his oath of allegiance.  Alexander P. Dill sat up straight, his long, bony fingers--which Billy could still mentally see gripping the necks of those two in the saloon--lying loosely upon the chair-arms. \"I hope you will not mention the matter again,\" he said. \"I realize that this is not Michigan, and that the temptations are--But we will not discuss it. I shall be very grateful for your friendship, and--\"  \"Grateful!\" snorted Billy, spilling tobacco on the strip of faded ingrain carpet before the bed. \"Grateful--hell!\"  Mr. Dill looked at him a moment and there was a certain keen man-measuring behind the wistfulness. But he said no more about the friendship of Charming Billy Boyle, which was as well.  That is why the two of them later sat apart on the sunny side of the hotel \"office\"--which was also a saloon--and talked of many things, but chiefly of the cattle industry as Montana knows it and of the hopes and the aims of Alexander P. Dill. Perhaps, also, that is why Billy breathed clean of whisky and had the bulk of his winter wages still unspent in his pocket.  \"Looks to me,\" he was saying between puffs, \"like you'd uh stayed back where yuh knew the lay uh the land, instead uh drifting out here where it's all plumb strange to yuh.\"  \"Well, several incidents influenced my actions,\" Mr. Dill explained quietly. \"I had always lived within twenty miles of my birthplace. I owned a general store in a little place near the old farm, and did well. The farm paid well, also. Then "]]]
