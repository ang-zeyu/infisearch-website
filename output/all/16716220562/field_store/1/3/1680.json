They were all free about the same hour, and even on the coldest days played out-of-doors from lunch-time until dark.  To-night Virginia had so many experiences to tell them of her day in town that the boys seemed unusually long in dressing. She was so impatient for them to hear her news that she could not settle down to anything, but walked restlessly around the room, wishing they would hurry.  \"Oh, I haven't sorted my valentines!\" she exclaimed, presently, picking up a fancy box which she had tossed on the bed when she first came in. \"I'll take them down to the library.\"  There was no one in the room when she peeped in. It looked so bright and cosy with the great wood fire blazing on the hearth and the rose-coloured light falling from its softly shaded lamps, that she forgot the coldness of the night outside. Sitting down on a pile of cushions at one end of the hearth-rug, she began sorting her purchases, trying to decide to whom each one should be sent.  \"The prettiest valentine of all must go to poor papa,\" she said to herself, \"'cause he's been so sick away down there in Cuba; and this one that's got the little girl on it in a blue dress shall be for my dear, sweet mamma, 'cause it will make her think of me.\"  For a moment, a mist seemed to blur the gay blue dress of the little valentine girl as Virginia looked at her, thinking of her far-away mother. She drew her hand hastily across her eyes and went on:  \"This one is for Sergeant Jackson out at Fort Dennis, and the biggest one, with the doves, for Colonel Philips and his wife. Dear me! I wish I could send one to every officer and soldier out there. They were all _so_ good to me!\"  The pile of lace-paper cupids and hearts and arrows and roses slipped from her lap, down to the rug, as she clasped her hands around her knees and looked into the fire. She wished that she could be back again at the fort, long enough to live one of those beautiful old days from reveille to taps. How she loved the bugle-calls and the wild thrill the band gave her, when it struck up a burst of martial music, and the troops went dashing by! How she missed the drills and the dress parades; her rides across the open prairie on her pony, beside her father; how she missed the games she used to play with the other children at the fort on the long summer evenings!  Something more than a mist was gathering in her eyes now. Two big tears were almost ready to fall when the door opened and Mrs. MacIntyre came in. In Virginia's eyes she was the most beautiful grandmother any one ever had. She was not so tall as her daughter Allison, and in that respect fell short of the little girl's ideal, but her hair, white as snow, curled around her face in the same soft, pretty fashion, and by every refined feature she showed her kinship to the aristocratic old faces which looked down from the family portraits in the hall.  \"I couldn't be as stately and dignified as she is if I practised a thousand years,\" thought Virginia, scrambling up from the pile of cushions to roll a chair nearer the fire. As she did so, her heel caught in the rug, and she fell back in an awkward little heap.  \"The more haste, the less grace, my dear,\" said her grandmother, kindly, thanking her for the proffered chair. Virginia blushed, wondering why she always appeared so awkward in her grandmother's presence. She envied the boys because they never seemed embarrassed or ill at ease before her.  While she was picking up her valentines the boys came in. If two of the cavalier ancestors had stepped down from their portrait frames just then, they could not have come into the room in a more charming manner than Malcolm and Keith. Their faces were shining, their linen spotless, and they came up to kiss their grandmother's cheek with an old-time courtliness that delighted her.  \"I am sure that there are no more perfect gentlemen in all Kentucky than my two little lads,\" she said, fondly, with an approving pat of Keith's hand as she held him a moment.  Virginia, who had seen them half an hour before, tousled and dirty, and had been arrayed against them in more than one hot quarrel where they had been anything but chivalrous, let slip a faintly whistled \"_cuckoo!_\"  The boys darted a quick glance in her direction, but she was bending over the valentines with a very serious face, which never changed its expression till her Aunt Allison came in and the boys began their apologies for not meeting her at the train. Their only excuse was that they had forgotten all about it.  Virginia spelled on her fingers: \"I dare you to tell what made your faces so black!\" Keith's only answer was to thrust his tongue out at her behind his grandmother's back. Then he ran to hold the door open for the ladies to pass out to dinner, with all the grace of a young Chesterfield.  When dinner was over and they were back in the library, Miss Allison opened a box of tiny heart-shaped envelopes, and began addressing them. As she took up her pen she said, merrily: \"_Now_ you may tell our secret, Virginia.\"  \"I was going to make you guess for about an hour,\" said Virginia, \"but it is so nice I can't wait that long to tell you. We are going to have a valentine party to-morrow night. Aunt Allison planned it all a week ago, and bought the things for it while we were in town to-day. Everything on the table is to be cut in heart shape,--the bread and butter and sandwiches and cheese; and the ice-cream will be moulded in hearts, and the two big frosted cakes are hearts, one pink and one white, with candy arrows sticking in them. Then there will be peppermint candy hearts with mottoes printed on them, and lace-paper napkins with verses on them, so that the table itself will look like a lovely big valentine. The games are lovely, too. One is parlour archery, with a red heart in the middle of the target, and two prizes, one for the boys and one for the girls.\"  \"Who are invited?\" asked Malcolm, as Virginia stopped for breath.  \"Oh, the Carrington boys, and the Edmunds, and Sally Fairfax, and Julia Ferris,--I can't remember them all. There will be twenty-four, counting us. There is the list on the table.\"  Keith reached for it, and began slowly spelling out the names. \"Who is this?\" he asked, reading the name that headed the list. \"'The Little Colonel!' I never heard of him,\"  \"Oh, he's a girl!\" laughed Virginia. Little Lloyd Sherman,--don't you know? She lives up at 'The Locusts,' that lovely place with the long avenue of trees leading up to the house. You've surely seen her with her grandfather, old Colonel Lloyd, riding by on the horse that he calls Maggie Boy.\"  \"Has he only one arm?\" asked Malcolm.  \"Yes, the other was shot off in the war years ago. Well, when Lloyd was younger, she had a temper so much like his, and wore such a dear little Napoleon hat, that everybody took to calling her the Little Colonel.\"  \"How old is she now?\" asked Malcolm.  \"About Keith's age, isn't she, Aunt Allison?\" asked Virginia.  \"Yes,\" was the answer. \"She is nearly eight, I believe. She has outgrown most of her naughtiness now.\"  \"I love to hear her talk,\" said Virginia. \"She leaves out all of her r's in such a soft, sweet way.\"  \"All Southerners do that,\" said Malcolm, pompously, \"and I think it sounds lots better than the way Yankees talk.\"  \"You boys don't talk like the Little Colonel,\" retorted Virginia, who had often been teased by them for not being a Southerner. \"You're all mixed up every which way. Some things you say like darkeys, and some things like English people, and it doesn't sound a bit like the Little Colonel.\"  \"Oh, well, that's because we've travelled abroad so much, don't you know,\" drawled Malcolm, \"and we've been in so many different countries, and had an English tutor, and all that sort of a thing. We couldn't help picking up a bit of an accent, don't you know.\" His superior tone made Virginia long to slap him.  \"Yes, I know, Mr. Brag,\" she said, in such a low voice that her grandmother could not hear. \"I know perfectly well. If I didn't it wouldn't be because you haven't told me every chance you got. Who did you say is your tailor in London, and how many times was it the Queen invited you out to Windsor? I think it's a ninety-nine dollar cravat you always buy, isn't it? And you wouldn't be so common as to wear a pair of gloves that hadn't been made to order specially for you. Yes, I've heard all about it!\"  Miss Allison heard, but said nothing. She knew the boys were a little inclined to boast, and she thought Virginia's sharp tongue might have a good effect. But the retort had grown somewhat sharper than was pleasant, and, fearing a quarrel might follow if she did not interrupt the whispers beside her, she said:  \"Boys, did you ever hear about the time that the Little Colonel threw mud on her grandfather's coat? There's no end to her pranks. Get grandmother to tell you.\"  \"Oh, yes, please, grandmother,\" begged Keith, with an arm around her neck. \"Tell about Fritz and the parrot, too,\" said Virginia. \"Here, Malcolm, there's room on this side for you.\"  Aunt Allison smiled. The storm had blown over, and they were all friends again.  [Illustration: \"'DAPHNE, WHAT'S DEM CHILLUN ALLUZ RACIN' DOWN TO DE SPRING-HOUSE FO'?'\"]    CHAPTER III.  THE VALENTINE PARTY.  \"Now we can tell Ginger about the bear,\" was Keith's first remark, when he awoke early next morning.  \"But not until after we have seen the man again,\" answered Malcolm. \"You know we promised him that.\"  \"Then let's go down before breakfast,\" exclaimed Keith, springing out of bed and beginning to dress himself. A little while later, the old coloured coachman saw them run past the window, where he was warming himself by the kitchen stove.  \"Daphne,\" he called out to the cook, who was beating biscuit in the adjoining pantry, \"Daphne, what's dem chillun alluz racin' down to de spring-house fo' in de snow? Peah's lak dee has a heap o' business down yandah.\"  Daphne, who had just been coaxed into filling"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12317"],["title","Two Little Knights of Kentucky (#4)"],["body"," basket with a generous supply of cold victuals, pretended not to hear until he repeated his question. Then she stopped pounding long enough to say, sharply, \"Whuffo' you alluz 'spicion dem boys so evahlastin'ly, Unc' Henry? Lak enough dee's settin' a rabbit trap. Boys has done such things befo'. You's done it yo'se'f, hasn't you?\"  Daphne had seen them setting rabbit traps there, but she knew well enough that was not what they had gone for now, and that the food they carried was not for the game of Robinson Crusoe, which they had played in the deserted cabin the summer before. Still, she did not care to take Unc' Henry into her confidence.  The food, the warmth, and the night's rest had so restored the bear that it was able to go through all its performances for the boys' entertainment, although it limped badly.  \"Isn't he a dandy?\" cried Keith; \"I wish we had one. It's nicer than any pets we ever had, except the ponies. Something always happened to the dogs, and the monkey was such a nuisance, and the white rabbits were stolen, and the guinea pigs died.\"  \"Haven't we had a lot of things, when you come to think of it?\" exclaimed Malcolm. \"Squirrels, and white mice, and the coon that Uncle Harry brought us, and the parrot from Mexico.\"  \"Yes, and the gold-fish, and the little baby alligator that froze to death in its tank,\" added Keith. \"But a bear like this would be nicer than any of them. As soon as papa comes home I am going to ask him to buy us one.\"  \"Jonesy's nearly done for,\" said the tramp, pointing to the boy who lay curled up in the hay, coughing at nearly every breath. \"We ought to stay here another day, if you young gen'lemen don't object.\"  \"Oh, goody!\" cried Keith. \"Then we can bring Ginger down to see the bear perform.\"  \"Yes,\" answered the man, \"we'll give a free show to all your friends, if you will only kindly wait till to-morrow. Give us one more day to rest up and get in a little better trim. The poor beast's foot is still too lame for him to do his best, and you're too kind-hearted, I am sure, to want anything to suffer in order to give you pleasure.\"  \"Of course,\" answered both the boys, agreeing so quickly to all the man's smooth speeches that, before they left the cabin, they had renewed their promise to keep silent one more day. The man was a shrewd one, and knew well how to make these unsuspecting little souls serve his purpose, like puppets tied to a string.  Miss Allison was so busy with preparations for the party that she had no time all that day to notice what the boys were doing. When they came back from reciting their lessons to the minister, she sent them on several errands, but the rest of the time they divided between the cabin and the post-office.  Every mail brought a few valentines to each of them, but it was not until the five o'clock train came that they found the long-looked-for letters from their father and mother.  \"I knew they'd each send us a valentine,\" cried Keith, tearing both of his open. \"I'll bet that papa's is a comic one. Yes, here it is. Papa is such a tease. Isn't it a stunner? a base-ball player. And, whoopee! Here's a dollar bill in each of 'em.\"  \"So there is in mine,\" said Malcolm. \"Mamma says we are to buy anything we want, and call it a valentine. They couldn't find anything down on the coast that they thought we would like.\"  \"I don't know what to get with mine,\" said Keith, folding his two bills together. \"Seems to me I have everything I want except a camera, and I couldn't buy the kind I want for two dollars.\"  They were half-way home when a happy thought came to Malcolm. \"Keith,\" he cried, excitedly, \"if you would put your money with mine, that would make four dollars, and maybe it would be enough to buy that bear!\"  \"Let's do it!\" exclaimed Keith, turning a handspring in the snow to show his delight. \"Come on, we'll ask the man now.\"  But the man shook his head, when they dashed into the cabin and told their errand. \"No, sonny, that ain't a tenth of what it's worth to me,\" he said. \"I've raised that bear from the time it was a teeny cub. I've taught it, and fed it, and looked to it for company when I hadn't nobody in the world to care for me. Couldn't sell that bear for no such sum as that. Couldn't you raise any more money than that?\"  It was Malcolm's turn to shake his head. He turned away, too disappointed to trust himself to answer any other way. The tears sprang to Keith's eyes. He had set his heart on having that bear.  \"Never mind, brother,\" said Malcolm, moving toward the door. \"Papa will get us one when he comes home and finds how much we want one.\"  \"Oh, don't be in such a hurry, young gen'lemen,\" whined the man, when he saw that they were really going. \"I didn't say that I wouldn't sell it to you for that much. You've been so kind to me that I ought to be willing to make any sacrifice for you. I happen to need four dollars very particular just now, and I've a mind to sell him to you on your own terms.\" He paused a moment, looking thoughtfully at a crack in the floor, as he stood by the fire with his hands in his pockets. \"Yes,\" he said, at last, \"you can have him for four dollars, if you'll keep mum about us being here for one more day. You can leave the bear here till we go.\"  \"No! No!\" cried Keith, throwing his arms around the animal's neck. \"He is ours now, and we must take him with us. We can hide him away in the barn. It is so dark out-doors now that nobody will see us. It wouldn't seem like he is really ours if we couldn't take him with us.\"  After some grumbling the man consented, and pocketed the four dollars, first asking very particularly the exact spot in the barn where they expected to hide their huge pet.  Unc' Henry, coming up from the carriage-house through the twilight, thought he saw some one stealing along by the clump of cedars by the spring-house. \"Who's prowlin' roun' dis yere premises?\" he called. There was no answer, and, after peering intently through the dusk for a moment, the old darkey concluded that he must have been mistaken, and passed on. As soon as he was gone, the boys came out from behind the cedars, and crept up the snowy hillside. They were leading the bear between them.  \"We'll put him away back in the hay-mow where he'll be warm and comfortable to-night,\" whispered Malcolm. \"Then in the morning we can tell everybody.\"  While they were busily scooping out a big hollow in the hay, they were startled by a rustling behind them. They looked into each other's frightened faces, and then glanced around the dark barn in alarm. An old cap pushed up through the hay. Then a weak little cough betrayed Jonesy. He had followed them.  \"Sh!\" he said, in a warning whisper. \"I'm afraid the boss will find out that I'm here. He started to the store for some tobacco as soon as you left. He's been wild fer some, but didn't have no money. _Don't you leave that bear out here to-night, if you ever expect to see it again!_ That wasn't true what he told you. He never saw the bear till two months ago, and he sold it to you cheap because he's a-goin' to steal it back again to-night, and make off up the road with it. He went off a-grinnin' over the slick way he'd fooled you, and I jes' had to come and tell, 'cause you've been so good to me. I'll never forget the little kid's givin' me the coat off his own back, if I live to be a hundred. Now don't blab on me, or the boss would nearly kill me.\"  \"Is that man your father?\" began Keith, but Jonesy, alarmed by some sudden noise, sprang to the door, and disappeared in the twilight.  The boys looked at each other a moment, with surprise and indignation in their faces. There was a hurried consultation in the hay-mow. A few moments later the boys were smuggling their new pet into the house, and up the back stairs. They scarcely dared breathe until it was safe in their own room.  All the time that they were dressing for the party, they were trying to decide where to put it for the night, so that neither the tramp nor the family could discover it. What Jonesy had told them about the man's dishonest intention did not relieve them from their promise. They were amazed that any one could be so mean, and longed to tell their Aunt Allison all about it; still, one of the conditions on which they had bought the bear was that they were to \"keep mum,\" and they stuck strictly to that promise.  By the time they were dressed, they had decided to put it in the blue room, a guest-chamber in the north wing, seldom used in winter, because it was so hard to heat. \"Nobody will ever think of coming in here,\" said Malcolm, \"and it will be plenty warm for a bear if we turn on the furnace a little.\" As he spoke, he was tying the bear's rope around a leg of the big, high-posted bed.  \"Won't Ginger be surprised?\" answered Keith. \"We'll tell her that we have a valentine six feet long, and keep her guessing.\"  There was no time for teasing, however, as the first guest arrived while they were still in the blue room.  \"I hate to go off and leave him in the dark,\" said Keith, with a final loving pat. \"I guess he'll not mind, though. Maybe he'll think he is in the woods if I put this good-smelling pine pillow on the rug beside him.\"  \"Oh, boys,\" called Virginia from the hall down-stairs. \"See what an enormous valentine pie Aunt Allison has made!\"  Looking over the banisters, the boys saw that a table had been drawn into the middle of the wide reception-hall, and on it sat the largest pie that they had ever seen. It was in a bright new tin pan, and its daintily browned crust would have made them hungry even if their appetites had not been sharpened by the cold and exercise of the afternoon.  \"What a queer place to serve pie,\" said Malcolm, in a disapproving undertone to his brother. \"Why don't they have it in the dining-room? It looks mighty good, but somehow it doesn't seem proper to have it stuck out here in the hall. Mamma would never do such a thing.\"  \"Aw, it's made of paper! She fooled us, sure, Malcolm,\""]]]
