Carlia knew of her coming and was waiting. Mildred put her arm about her friend and kissed her, somewhat to the younger girl's confused pleasure. The two girls went up the path to the house where Mrs. Trent met them.  \"Where's your baggage?\" asked the mother of the arrival, seeing she carried only a small bag and her violin case.  \"This is all. I'm not going to paint this time--just going to rest, mother said, so I do not need a lot of baggage.\"  \"Well, come in Honey; and you too, Carlia. Dinner is about ready, an' you'll stay.\"  By a little urging Carlia remained, and pretty soon, Dorian came stamping in to be surprised.  \"Yes; we're all here,\" announced Carlia, as she tossed her black curls and laughed at his confusion.  \"I see you are,\" he replied, as he shook hands with Mildred. After which ceremony, it did not just look right to slight the other girl, so he shook hands with her also, much to her amusement.  \"How do you do, Mr. Trent\" she said.  \"Carlia is such a tease,\" explained the mother.  \"For which I like her,\" added Mildred.  \"We all do. Even Dorian here, who is usually afraid of girls, makes quite a chum of her.\"  \"Well, we're neighbors,\" justified the girl.  After dinner Carlia took Mildred home with her. It was not far, just around the low ridge which hid the house from view. There Mildred met Pa Duke, Ma Duke and Will Duke, Carlia's older brother. Pa Duke was a hard-working farmer, Ma Duke was likewise a hard-working farmer's wife, and Will Duke should have been a hard-working farmer's boy, but he was somewhat a failure, especially regarding the hard work part. Carlia, though so young, was already a hardworking farmer girl, with no chance of escape, as far as she could see, from the hard-working part. The Duke house, though clean and roomy, lacked the dainty home touches which mean so much. There were no porch, no lawn, no trees. The home was bare inside and out.  In deference to the \"company\" Carlia was permitted to \"visit\" with her friend that afternoon. Apparently, these two girls had very little in common, but when left to themselves they found many mutual interests.  Toward the close of the afternoon, Dorian appeared. He found the girls out in the yard, Carlia seated on the topmost pole of the corral fence, and Mildred standing beside her.  \"Hello girls,\" Dorian greeted. \"I've come to give you an invitation.\"  \"What, a party!\" exclaimed Carlia, jumping down from her perch.  \"Not a dancing party, you little goose--just a surprise party.\"  \"On who?\"  \"On Uncle Zed.\"  \"Uncle Zed. O, shucks!\"  \"Well, of course, you do not have to go,\" said Dorian.  \"I think you're mean. I do want to go if Mildred is going.\"  \"I don't know Uncle Zed,\" said Mildred, \"but if Mrs. Trent and Dorian wish me to go, I shall be pleased; and of course, you will go with us.\"  \"She's invited,\" repeated Dorian. \"It's Uncle Zed's seventy-fifth birthday. Mother keeps track of them, the only one who does, I guess, for he doesn't do it himself. We're just going down to visit with him this evening. He's a very fine old man, is Uncle Zed,\" this last to Mildred.  \"Is he your uncle?\"  \"Oh, no; he's just uncle to everybody and no one in particular. He's all by himself, and has no folks?\"  Just before the dusk of the evening, the little party set out for the home of Zedekiah Manning, generally and lovingly known as Uncle Zed. He lived about half a mile down the road in a two-roomed log house which had a big adobe chimney on one side. His front yard was abloom with the autumn flowers. The path leading to his door was neatly edged by small cobble stones. Autumn tinted ivy embowered his front door and climbed over the wall nearly to the low roof.  Uncle Zed met the visitors at the door. \"Well, well,\" he exclaimed, \"come right in. I'll light the lamp.\" Then he assisted them to find seats.  Mildred looked keenly at Uncle Zed, whom she found to be a little frail old man with clean white hair and beard, and kindly, smiling face. He sat down with his company and rubbed his hands in a way which implied: \"And what does all this mean?\" Mildred noted that the wall, back of his own chair, was nearly covered with books, and a number of volumes lay on the table. The room was furnished for the simple needs of the lone occupant. A fire smouldered in the open grate.  \"Now, Uncle Zed, have you forgotten again?\" inquired Mrs. Trent.  \"Forgotten what? I suppose I have, for my memory is not so good as it used to be.\"  \"Your memory never was good regarding the day of the year you were born.\"  \"Day when I was born? What, has my birthday come around again? Well, sure; but I had quite forgotten. How these birthdays do pile up on one.\"  \"How old are you today?\" asked Dorian.  \"How old? Let me see. I declare, I must be seventy-five.\"  \"Isn't he a funny man,\" whispered Carlia to Mildred, who appeared not to hear the comment, so interested was she in the old man.  \"And so you've come to celebrate,\" went on Uncle Zed, \"come to congratulate me that I am one year nearer the grave.\"  \"Now, Uncle Zed, you know--\"  \"Yes; I know; forgive me for teasing; I know why you come to wish me well. It is that I have kept the faith one year more, and that I am twelve months nearer my heavenly reward. That's it, isn't it?\"  Uncle Zed pushed his glasses up on his forehead to better see his company, especially Mildred. Mrs. Trent made the proper introduction, then lifted the picnic basket from the table to a corner.  \"We're just going to spend an hour or so with you,\" explained Mrs. Trent. \"We want you to talk, Mildred to play, and then we'll have a bite to eat. We'll just sit about your grate, and look into the glow of the fire while you talk.\" However, Dorian and Mildred were scanning the books.  \"What's this set?\" the young girl asked.  Dorian bent down to read the dim titles. \"The Millennial Star\" he said.  \"And here's another set.\"  \"The Journal of Discourses\" he replied.  \"My, all sermons? they must be dry reading.\"  Uncle Zed heard their conversation, and stepped over to them. \"Are you also interested in books?\" he asked. \"Dorian and I are regular book-worms, you know.\"  Oh, yes, she was interested in books.  \"But there are books and books, you know,\" went on Uncle Zed. \"You like story books, no doubt. So do I. There's nothing better than a rattling good love story, eh, young lady?\"  Mildred hardly knew just how to take this remark, so she did not reply.  \"Here's the most wonderful love story ever written.\" He took from the shelf a very ordinary looking volume, called the \"Doctrine and Covenants.\" Carlia and Mrs. Trent now joined the other three. They also were interested.  \"You wouldn't be looking in the 'Doctrine and Covenants' for love stories, would you; but here in the revelation on the eternity of the marriage covenant we find that men and women, under the proper conditions and by the proper authority, may be united as husbands and wives, not only for time, but for eternity. Most love stories end when the lovers are married; but think of the endlessness of life and love under this new and everlasting covenant of marriage--but I mustn't preach so early in the evening.\"  \"But we like to hear it, Uncle Zed,\" said Dorian.  \"Indeed, we do,\" added Mildred. \"Tell us more about your books.\"  \"Here is one of my precious volumes--Orson Pratt's works. When I get hungry for the solid, soul-satisfying doctrines of the kingdom, I read Orson Pratt. Parley Pratt also is good. Here is a book which is nearly forgotten, but which contains beautiful presentations of the gospel, 'Spencer's Letters'. Dorian, look here.\" He handed the young man a small, ancient-looking, leather bound book. \"I found it in a second-hand store and paid fifteen cents for it. Yes, it's a second edition of the 'Doctrine and Covenants,' printed by John Taylor in Nauvoo in 1844. The rest of my collection is familiar to you, I am sure. Here is a complete set of the 'Contributor' and this is my 'Era' shelf, and here are most of the more modern church works. Let us now go back to the fire.\"  After they were again seated, Mildred asked him if he had known Brigham Young. She always liked to hear the pioneers talk of their experiences.  \"No\" replied Uncle Zed, \"I never met President Young, but I believe I know him as well as many who had that pleasure. I have read everything that I could get in print which Brigham Young ever said. I have read all his discourses in those volumes. He was not a polished speaker, I understand, and he did not often follow a theme; but mixed with the more commonplace subjects of irrigation, Indian troubles, etc., which, in his particular day had to be spoken of, are some of the most profound gospel truths in any language. Gems of thought shine from every page of his discourses.\"  Carlia was nodding in a warm corner. Uncle Zed rambled on reminiscently until Mrs. Trent suddenly arose, spoke sharply to Carlia, and lifted the basket of picnic on to the table.  \"We'll have our refreshments now,\" she said, \"and then we must be going. Uncle Zed goes early to bed, and so should we.\"  The table was spread: roast chicken, brought by Carlia; dainty sandwiches, made by Mildred; apple pie from Mrs. Trent's cupboard; a jar of apricot preserves, suggested by Dorian. Uncle Zed asked a blessing not only on the food, but on the kind hands which had provided it. Then they ate heartily, and yet leaving a generous part to be left in Uncle Zed's own cupboard.  Then Dorian had a presentation to make. He took from the basket a small package, unwrapped it, and handed a book to the man who was seventy-five years old.  \"I couldn't do much by way of the eats,\" said Dorian, \"so my present is this.\"  \"'Drummond's Natural Law in the Spiritual World'\" read Uncle Zed. \"Why, Dorian, this is fine of you. How could you guess my wishes so nicely. For a long"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12684"],["title","Dorian (#6)"],["body","ime, this is just the book I have wanted.\"  \"I'm glad. I thought you'd like it.\"  \"Fine, fine,\" said the old man, fondling the volume as he would some dear object, as indeed, every good book was to him.  Then Mildred got out her violin, and after the proper tuning of the strings, she placed it under her shapely chin. She played without music some of the simple heart melodies, and then some of the Sunday School songs which the company softly accompanied by words.  Carlia poked the log in the grate into a blaze, then slyly turned the lamp wick down. When detected and asked why she did that she replied:  \"I wanted to make it appear more like a picnic party around a camp fire in the hills.\"     CHAPTER FIVE.   Dorian's high school days in the city began that fall, a little late because he had so many things to set right at home; but he soon made up the lost time, for he was a student not afraid of hard work. He walked back and forth the three miles. Mrs. Brown offered him a room at her large city residence, but he could not accept it because of his daily home chores. However, he occasionally called on the Brown's who tried to make him feel as much at home as they did at Greenstreet.  Never before were days so perfect to Dorian, never before had he so enjoyed the fleeting hours. For the first week or two, he was a little shy, but the meeting each morning with boys and girls of his own age and mingling with them in their studies and their recreations, soon taught him that they were all very much alike, just happy, carefree young people, most of them trying to get an education. He soon learned, also, that he could easily hold his own in the class work with the brightest of them. The teachers, and students also, soon learned to know this. Boys came to him for help in problems, and the younger girls chattered about him with laughing eyes and tossing curls. What a wonder it was! He the simple, plainly-dressed country boy, big and awkward and ugly as he thought himself to be, becoming a person of some importance. And so the days went all too swiftly by. Contrary to his younger boyhood's experience, the closing hour came too soon, when it was time to go home to mother and chores and lessons.  And the mother shared the boy's happiness, for she could see the added joy of living and working which had come into his life by the added opportunities and new environment. He frequently discussed with his mother his lessons. She was not well posted in the knowledge derived from books, and sometimes she mildly resented this newer learning which he brought into the home and seemed to intrude on her old-established ideas. For instance, when the cold winter nights came, and Dorian kept open his bedroom window, the mother protested that he would \"catch his death of cold.\" Night air and drafts are very dangerous, especially if let into one's bedroom, she held.  \"But, mother, I must have air to breathe,\" said Dorian, \"and what other kind of air can I have at night? I might store a little day-air in my room, but I would soon exhaust its life-giving qualities at night. You know, mother,\" he went on in the assurance of his newly acquired knowledge, \"I guess the Lord knew what He was about when He enveloped the earth with air which presses down nearly fifteen pounds to the square inch so that it might permeate every possible nook and corner of the globe.\" Then he went on to explain the wonderful process of blood purification in the lungs, and demonstrated to her that the breath is continually throwing off foul matter. He did this by breathing into a fruit jar, screwing on the lid for a little while, and then having the nose make the test.  \"Some bed rooms I've gone into smell just like that,\" he said.  \"Here, mother is a clipping from a magazine. Listen:  \"'Of all the marvels of God's workmanship, none is more wondrous than the air. Think of our all being bathed in a substance so delicate as to be itself unperceived, yet so dense as to be the carriage to our senses of messages from the world about us! It is never in our way; it does not ask notice; we only know it is there by the good it does us. And this exquisitely soft, pure, yielding, unseen being, like a beautiful and beneficent fairy, brings us blessings from all around. It has the skill to wash our blood clean from all foulness. Its weight keeps us from tumbling to pieces. It is a reservoir where the waters lie stored, until they fall and gladden the earth. It is a great-coat that softens to us the heat of the day, and the cold of the night. It carries sounds to our ears and smells to our nostrils. Its movements fill Nature with ceaseless change; and without their aid in wafting ships over the sea, commerce and civilization would have been scarce possible. It is of all wonders the most wonderful.'\"  At another time when Dorian had a cold, and consequently, a loss of appetite, his mother urged him to eat more, saying that he must have strength to throw off his cold.  \"What is a cold?\" he smilingly asked.  \"Why, a cold is--a cold, of course, you silly boy.\"  \"What does it do to the activities of the body?\"  \"I'm not a doctor; how can I tell.\"  \"All mothers are doctors and nurses; they do a lot of good, and some things that are not so good. For instance, why should I eat more when I have a cold?\" She did not reply, and so he went on: \"The body is very much like a stove or a furnace; it is burning material all the time. Sometimes the clinkers accumulate and stop the draft, both in the human as well as the iron stove. When that happens, the sensible thing to do is not to throw in more fuel but to clean out the clinkers first.\"  \"Where did you get all that wisdom, Dorian?\"  \"I got it from my text book on hygiene, and I think it's true because it seems so reasonable.\"  \"Well, last night's talk led me to believe that you would become a philosopher; now, the trend is more toward the doctor; tomorrow I'll think you are studying law.\"  \"Oh, but we are, mother; you ought to hear us in our civil government class. We have organized into a Congress of the United States, and we are going to make laws.\"  \"You'll be elected President, I suppose.\"  \"I'm one of the candidates.\"  \"Well, my boy\" she smiled happily at him, \"I hope you will be elected to every good thing, and that you will fill every post with honor; and now, I would like you to read to me from the 'Lady of the Lake' while I darn your stockings. Your father used to read the story to me a long, long time ago, and your voice is very much like his when you read.\"  And thus with school and home and ward duties the winter passed. Spring called him again to the fields to which he went with new zeal, for life was opening to him in a way which life is in the habit of doing to the young of his age. Mildred Brown and her mother were in California. He heard from her occasionally by way of postcards, and once she sent him one of her sketches of the ocean. Carlia Duke also was not forgotten by Mildred. Dorian and Carlia met frequently as neighbors will do, and they often spoke of their mutual friend. The harvest was again good that fall, and Dorian once more took up his studies at the high school in the city. Carlia finished the grades as Dorian completed his second year, and the following year Carlia walked with Dorian to the high school. That was no great task for the girl, now nearly grown to young womanhood, and it was company for both of them. During these walks Carlia had many questions to ask about her lessons, and Dorian was always pleased to help her.  \"I am such a dunce,\" she would say, \"I wish I was as smart as you.\"  \"You must say 'were' when you wish. I were as smart as you,\" he corrected.  \"O, yes: I forgot. My, but grammar is hard, especially to a girl which--\"  \"No--a girl who; which refers to objects and animals, who to persons.\"  Carlia laughed and swung her books by the strap. Dorian was not carrying them that day. Sometimes he was absentminded regarding the little courtesies.  The snow lay hard packed in the road and it creaked under their feet. Carlia's cheeks glowed redder than ever in contact with the keen winter air. They walked on in silence for a time.  \"Say, Dorian, why do you not go and see Mildred?\" asked Carlia, not looking at him, but rather at the eastern mountains.  \"Why? Is she not well?\"  \"She is never well now. She looks bad to me.\"  \"When did you see her?\"  \"Last Saturday. I called at the house, and she asked about you--Poor girl!\"  \"What do you mean by that?\"  \"You are very smart in some things, but are a stupid dunce in other things. Mildred is like an angel both in looks and--everything. I wish I was--were half as good.\"  \"But how am I such a dunce, Carlia?\"  \"In not seeing how much Mildred thinks of you.\"  \"Thinks of me? Mildred?\"  \"She just loves you.\"  Carlia still looked straight ahead as though fearful to see the agitation she had brought to the young man; but he looked at her, with cheeks still aflame. He did not understand Carlia. Why had she said that? Was she just teasing him? But she did not look as if she were teasing. Silently they walked on to the school house door.  But Dorian could not forget what Carlia had said. All day it intruded into his lessons. \"She said she loves me\" he whispered to his heart only. Could it be possible? Even if she did, what final good would come of it? The distance between them was still too great, for he was only a poor farmer boy. Dear Mildred--his heart did not chide him for thinking that--so frail, so weak, so beautiful. What if she--should die! Dorian was in a strange state of mind for a number of days. He longed to visit the Brown home, yet he could not find excuse to go. He could not talk to anybody about what was in his mind and heart, not even to his mother with whom he always shared his most hidden thoughts.  One evening he visited Uncle Zed, ostensibly, to talk about a book. Uncle Zed was deep in the study of \"Natural Law in the Spiritual World\" and would have"]]]
