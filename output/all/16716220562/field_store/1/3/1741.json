May I, without appearing too inquisitive, ask from what part of the country you come?\"  \"I am from Norfolk, worthy Sir,\" the young man answered, \"where my life has been spent among a set of men wild and uncouth, and fond of the chase as the Sherwood archers we read of in the ballads. I am the son of a broken gentleman; the lord of a ruined house; with one old servant left me out of fifty kept by my father, and with scarce a hundred acres that I can still call my own, out of the thousands swept away from me. Still I hunt in my father's woods; kill my father's deer; and fish in my father's lakes; since no one molests me. And I keep up the little church near the old tumble-down hall, in which are the tombs of my ancestors, and where my father lies buried; and the tenantry come there yet on Sundays, though I am no longer their master; and my father's old chaplain, Sir Oliver, still preaches there, though my father's son can no longer maintain him.\"  \"A sad change, truly,\" Sir Francis said, in a tone of sympathy, and with a look of well-feigned concern; \"and attributable, I much fear, to riot and profusion on the part of your father, who so beggared his son.\"  \"Not so, Sir,\" the young man gravely replied; \"my father was a most honourable man, and would have injured no one, much less the son on whom he doated. Neither was he profuse; but lived bountifully and well, as a country gentleman, with a large estate, should live. The cause of his ruin was that he came within the clutches of that devouring monster, which, like the insatiate dragon of Rhodes, has swallowed up the substance of so many families, that our land is threatened with desolation. My father was ruined by that court, which, with a mockery of justice, robs men of their name, their fame, their lands, and goods; which perverts the course of law, and saps the principles of equity; which favours the knave, and oppresses the honest man; which promotes and supports extortion and plunder; which reverses righteous judgments, and asserts its own unrighteous supremacy, which, by means of its commissioners, spreads its hundred arms over the whole realm, to pillage and destroy--so that no one, however distant, can keep out of its reach, or escape its supervision; and which, if it be not uprooted, will, in the end, overthrow the kingdom. Need I say my father was ruined by the Star-Chamber?\"  \"Hush! hush! my good young Sir,\" Sir Francis cried, having vainly endeavoured to interrupt his companion's angry denunciation. \"Pray heaven your words have reached no other ears than mine! To speak of the Star-Chamber as you have spoken is worse than treason. Many a man has lost his ears, and been branded on the brow, for half you have uttered.\"  \"Is free speech denied in this free country?\" the young man cried in astonishment. \"Must one suffer grievous wrong, and not complain?\"  \"Certes, you must not contemn the Star-Chamber, or you will incur its censure,\" Sir Francis replied in a low tone. \"No court in England is so jealous of its prerogatives, nor so severe in punishment of its maligners. It will not have its proceedings canvassed, or its judgments questioned.\"  \"For the plain reason, that it knows they will not bear investigation or discussion. Such is the practice of all arbitrary and despotic rule. But will Englishmen submit to such tyranny?\"  \"Again, let me counsel you to put a bridle on your tongue, young Sir. Such matters are not to be talked of at public tables--scarcely in private. It is well you have addressed yourself to one who will not betray you. The Star-Chamber hath its spies everywhere. Meddle not with it, as you value liberty. Light provocation arouses its anger; and once aroused, its wrath is all-consuming.\"     CHAPTER V. Jocelyn Mounchensey.   Notwithstanding the risk incurred, the young man, whose feelings were evidently deeply interested, seemed disposed to pursue the dangerous theme; but perceiving one of their opposite neighbours glancing at them, Sir Francis checked him; and filling his glass essayed to change the conversation, by inquiring how long he had been in town, and where he lodged?  \"I only arrived in London yesterday,\" was the reply; \"yet I have been here long enough to make me loth to return to the woods and moors of Norfolk. As to my lodging, it is without the city walls, near St. Botolph's Church, and within a bow shot of Aldgate: a pleasant situation enough, looking towards the Spital Fields and the open country. I would fain have got me others in the Strand, or near Charing Cross, if my scanty means would have allowed me. Chance, as I have said, brought me here to-day. Strolling forth early to view the sights of town, I crossed London Bridge, the magnificence of which amazed me; and, proceeding along the Bankside, entered Paris Garden, of which I had heard much, and where I was greatly pleased, both with the mastiffs kept there, and the formidable animals they have to encounter; and, methought, I should like to bait mine enemies with those savage dogs, instead of the bear. Returning to the opposite shore in a wherry, the waterman landed me at this wharf, and so highly commended the Three Cranes, as affording the best French ordinary and the best French wine in London, that seeing many gentlefolk flocking towards it, which seemed to confirm his statement, I came in with them, and have reason to be satisfied with my entertainment, never having dined so sumptuously before, and, certes, never having tasted wine so delicious.\"  \"Let me fill your glass again. As I am a true gentleman, it will not hurt you; a singular merit of pure Bordeaux being that you may drink it with impunity; and the like cannot be said of your sophisticated sack. We will crush another flask. Ho! drawer--Cyprien, I say! More wine--and of the best Bordeaux. The best, I say.\"  And for a wonder the order was obeyed, and the flask set before him.  \"You have been at the Bankside you say, young Sir? On my credit, you must cross the river again and visit the theatres--the Globe or the Rose. Our great actor, Dick Burbadge, plays Othello to-day, and, I warrant me, he will delight you. A little man is Dick, but he hath a mighty soul. There is none other like him, whether it be Nat Field or Ned Alleyn. Our famous Shakespeare is fortunate, I trow, in having him to play his great characters. You must see Burbadge, likewise, in the mad Prince of Denmark,--the part was written for him, and fits him exactly. See him also in gentle and love-sick Romeo, in tyrannous and murderous Macbeth, and in crookback Richard; in all of which, though different, our Dick is equally good. He hath some other parts of almost equal merit,--as Malevole, in the 'Malcontent;' Frankford, in the 'Woman Killed with Kindness;' Brachiano, in Webster's 'White Devil;' and Vendice, in Cyril Tournour's 'Revenger's Tragedy.'\"  \"I know not what may be the nature of that last-named play,\" the young man rather sternly remarked; \"but if the character of Vendice at all bears out its name, it would suit me. I am an avenger.\"  \"Forbear your wrongs awhile, I pray you, and drown your resentment in a cup of wine. As I am a true gentleman! a better bottle than the first! Nay, taste it. On my credit, it is perfect nectar. I pledge you in a brimmer; wishing Success may attend you, and Confusion await your Enemies! May you speedily regain your Rights!\"  \"I drink that toast most heartily, worthy Sir,\" the young man exclaimed, raising his beaded flagon on high. \"Confusion to my Enemies--Restoration to my Rights!\"  And he drained the goblet to its last drop.  \"By this time he must be in a fit mood for my purpose,\" Sir Francis thought, as he watched him narrowly. \"Harkye, my good young friend,\" he said, lowering his tone, \"I would not be overheard in what I have to say. You were speaking just now of the shortest way to fortune. I will point it out to you. To him, who is bold enough to take it, and who hath the requisites for the venture, the shortest way is to be found at Court. Where think you most of those gallants, of whom you may catch a glimpse through the traverse, derive their revenues?--As I am a true gentleman!--from the royal coffers. Not many years ago, with all of them; not many months ago, with some; those brilliant and titled coxcombs were adventurers like yourself, having barely a Jacobus in their purses, and scarce credit for board and lodging with their respective landladies. Now you see how nobly they feast, and how richly they bedeck themselves. On my credit! the like good fortune may attend you; and haply, when I dine at an ordinary a year hence, I may perceive you at the upper table, with a curtain before you to keep off the meaner company, and your serving-man at your back, holding your velvet mantle and cap, like the best of your fellow nobles.\"  \"Heaven grant it may be so!\" the young man exclaimed, with a sigh. \"You hold a dazzling picture before me; but I have little expectation of realizing it.\"  \"It will be your own fault if you do not,\" the tempter rejoined. \"You are equally well-favoured with the handsomest of them; and it was by good looks alone that the whole party rose to their present eminence. Why not pursue the same course; with the same certainty of success? You have courage enough to undertake it, I presume?\"  \"If courage alone were wanting, I have that,\" the young man replied;--\"but I am wholly unknown in town. How then shall I accomplish an introduction at Court, when I know not even its humblest attendant?\"  \"I have already said you were lucky in meeting with me,\" Sir Francis replied; \"and I find you were luckier than I supposed, when I told you so; for I knew not then towards what bent your desires tended, nor in what way I could help you; but now, finding out the boldness of your flight, and the high game you aim at, I am able to offer you effectual assistance, and give you an earnest of a prosperous issue. Through my means you shall be presented to the king, and in such sort that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12396"],["title","The Star-Chamber: An Historical Romance, Volume 1 (#6)"],["body","presentation shall not be idly made. It will rest then with yourself to play your cards dexterously, and to follow up a winning game. Doubtless, you will have many adversaries, who will trip up your heels if they can, and throw every obstacle in your way; but if you possess the strong arm I fancy you do, and daring to second it, you have nothing to fear. As I am a true gentleman! you shall have good counsel, and a friend in secret to back you.\"  \"To whom am I indebted for this most gracious and unlooked-for offer?\" the young man asked, his breast heaving, and his eye flashing with excitement.  \"To one you may perchance have heard of,\" the knight answered, \"as the subject of some misrepresentation; how justly applied, you yourself will be able to determine from my present conduct. I am Sir Francis Mitchell.\"  At the mention of this name the young man started, and a deep angry flush overspread his face and brow.  Perceiving the effect produced, the wily knight hastened to remove it.  \"My name, I see, awakens unpleasant associations in your breast,\" he said; \"and your look shows you have been influenced by the calumnies of my enemies. I do not blame you. Men can only be judged of by report; and those I have had dealings with have reported ill enough of me. But they have spoken falsely. I have done no more than any other person would do. I have obtained the best interest I could for my money; and my losses have been almost equal to my gains. Folks are ready enough to tell all they can against you; but slow to mention aught they conceive to be in your favour. They stigmatize me as a usurer; but they forget to add, I am ever the friend of those in need. They use me, and abuse me. That is the way of the world. Wherefore, then, should I complain? I am no worse off than my neighbours. And the proof that I can be disinterested is the way in which I have acted towards you, a perfect stranger, and who have no other recommendation to my good offices than your gracious mien and gentle manners.\"  \"I cannot accept your proffered aid, Sir Francis,\" the young man replied, in an altered tone, and with great sternness. \"And you will understand why I cannot, when I announce myself to you as Jocelyn Mounchensey.\"  It was now the knight's turn to start, change colour, and tremble.     CHAPTER VI. Provocation.   A momentary pause ensued, during which Mounchensey regarded the knight so fiercely, that the latter began to entertain apprehensions for his personal safety, and meditated a precipitate retreat. Yet he did not dare to move, lest the action should bring upon him the hurt he wished to avoid. Thus he remained, like a bird fascinated by the rattlesnake, until the young man, whose power of speech seemed taken from him by passion, went on, in a tone of deep and concentrated rage, that communicated a hissing sound to his words.  \"Yes, I am Jocelyn Mounchensey,\" he said, \"the son of him whom your arts and those of your partner in iniquity, Sir Giles Mompesson, brought to destruction; the son of him whom you despoiled of a good name and large estates, and cast into a loathsome prison, to languish and to die: I am the son of that murdered man. I am he whom you have robbed of his inheritance; whose proud escutcheon you have tarnished; whose family you have reduced to beggary and utter ruin.\"  \"But Sir Jocelyn, my worthy friend,\" the knight faltered, \"have patience, I pray of you. If you consider yourself aggrieved, I am willing to make reparation--ample reparation. You know what were my intentions towards you, before I had the slightest notion who you might be. (If I had but been aware of it, he thought, I would have taken care to keep at a respectful distance from him.) I will do more than I promised. I will lend you any sums of money you may require; and on your personal security. Your bare word shall suffice. No bonds--no written obligations of any kind. Does that sound like usury? As I am a true gentleman! I am most unfairly judged. I am not the extortioner men describe me. You shall find me your friend,\" he added in a low earnest tone. \"I will re-establish your fortune; give you a new title, higher and prouder than that which you have lost; and, if you will follow my counsel, you shall supplant the haughty favourite himself. You shall stand where Buckingham now stands. Hear reason, good Sir Jocelyn. Hear reason, I entreat you.\"  \"I will hear nothing further,\" Jocelyn rejoined. \"Were you to talk till Doomsday, you could not alter my feelings towards you a jot. My chief errand in coming to London was to call you and Sir Giles Mompesson to strict account.\"  \"And we will answer any charges you may bring against us readily--most readily, Sir Jocelyn. All was done in fairness--according to law. The Star-Chamber will uphold us.\"  \"Tut! you think to terrify me with that bugbear; but I am not so easily frightened. We have met for the first time by chance, but our next meeting shall be by appointment.\"  \"When and where you please, Sir Jocelyn,\" the knight replied; \"but recollect the duello is forbidden, and, though I would not willingly disappoint you in your desire to cut my throat, I should be sorry to think you might be hanged for it afterwards. Come, Sir Jocelyn, lay aside this idle passion, and look to your true interests, which lie not in quarrelling with me, but in our reconciliation. I can help you effectually, as I have shown; and, as I am a true gentleman, I _will_ help you. Give me your hand, and let us be friends!\"  \"Never!\" Jocelyn exclaimed, withdrawing from him, \"never shall the hand of a Mounchensey grasp yours in friendship! I would sooner mine rotted off! I am your mortal foe. My father's death has to be avenged.\"  \"Provoke him not, my good young Sir,\" interposed an elderly man, next him, in a long furred gown, with hanging sleeves, and a flat cap on his head, who had heard what was now passing. \"You know not the mischief he may do you.\"  \"I laugh at his malice, and defy him,\" Jocelyn cried--\"he shall not sit one moment longer beside me. Out, knave! out!\" he added, seizing Sir Francis by the wing of his doublet, and forcibly thrusting him from his seat. \"You are not fit company for honest men. Ho! varlets, to the door with him! Throw him into the kennel.\"  \"You shall rue this, villain!--you shall rue it bitterly,\" Sir Francis cried, shaking his clenched hands at him. \"Your father perished like a dog in the Fleet, and you shall perish there likewise. You have put yourself wholly in my power, and I will make a fearful example of you. You have dared to utter scandalous and contemptuous language against the great and high court of Star-Chamber, before the decrees of which, all men bow; impugning its justice and denying its authority; and you shall feel the full weight of its displeasure. I call upon these worthy gentlemen to testify against you.\"  \"We have heard nothing, and can testify nothing,\" several voices cried.  \"But you, Sir, who were next him, you must have heard him?\" Sir Francis said, addressing the elderly man in the furred gown.  \"Not I!\" rejoined the person appealed to; \"I gave no heed to what was said.\"  \"But I did, Sir Francis,\" squeaked a little whey-faced man, in a large ruff and tight-laced yellow doublet, from the opposite side of the table; \"I heard him most audaciously vilipend the high court of Star-Chamber and its councils; and I will bear testimony against him when called upon.\"  \"Your name, good Sir, your name?\" Sir Francis demanded, taking out his tablets.  \"Set me down as Thopas Trednock, tailor, at the sign of the Pressing Iron, in Cornhill,\" the whey-faced man replied, in his shrill tones, amid the derisive laughter of the assemblage.  \"Thopas Trednock, tailor--good!\" the knight repeated, as he wrote the name down. \"You will be an excellent witness, Master Trednock. Fare you well for the present, _Master_ Jocelyn Mounchensey, for I now mind well your father was degraded from the honour of knighthood. As I am a true gentleman! you may be sure of committal to the Fleet.\"  As may be supposed, the scuffle which had taken place, attracted the attention of those in its immediate vicinity; and when the cause of it became known, as it presently did throughout both tables, great indignation was expressed against Sir Francis, who was censured on all hands, jeered and flouted, as he moved to the door. So great was the clamour, and so opprobrious were the epithets and terms applied to him, that the knight was eager to make his escape; but he met Cyprien in his way; and the droll young Gascon, holding a dish-cover in one hand, by way of buckler, and a long carving-knife in the other, in place of a sword, opposed his egress.  \"Let me pass, knave,\" Sir Francis cried in alarm.  \"By your leave, no,\" returned Cyprien, encouraged by the laughter and plaudits of the company. \"You have come hither uninvited, and must stay till you have permission to depart. Having partaken of the banquet, you must, perforce, tarry for the rerebanquet. The sweets and cates have yet to come, Sir Francis.\"  \"What mean you, sirrah?\" the knight demanded, in increased trepidation.  \"Your presence is necessary at a little entertainment I have provided to follow the dinner, sweet Sir Francis,\" Madame Bonaventure cried, advancing towards him; \"and as you have a principal part in it, I can by no means spare you.\"  \"No one can spare you, sweet Sir Francis,\" several voices chimed in, derisively. \"You must remain with us a little longer.\"  \"But I will not stay. I will not be detained. There is some conspiracy a-foot against me. I will indict you all for it, if you hinder me in going forth,\" the knight vociferated, in accents of mingled rage and terror. \"Stop me at your peril, thou saucy Gascon knave.\"  \"_Cornes du diable_!--no more a knave than yourself, _gros usurier_!\" Cyprien cried.  \"_Laissez-lui,_ Cyprien,\" Madame Bonaventure interposed;--\"the courteous knight will yield to my entreaties, and stay of his own free will.\"  \"I have business "]]]
