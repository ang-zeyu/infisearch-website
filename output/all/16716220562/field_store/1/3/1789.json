The proprietor was somebody's chauffeur at the front, and we drank to his excellent health) --at a little village in a twilight full of the petrol of many cars and the wholesome flavour of healthy troops.  There is no better guide to camp than one's own thoughtful nose; and though I poked mine everywhere, in no place then or later did it strike that vile betraying taint of underfed, unclean men. And the same with the horses.  THE LINE THAT NEVER SLEEPS  It is difficult to keep an edge after hours of fresh air and experiences; so one does not get the most from the most interesting part of the day--the dinner with the local headquarters.  Here the professionals meet--the Line, the Gunners, the Intelligence with stupefying photo-plans of the enemy's trenches; the Supply; the Staff, who collect and note all things, and are very properly chaffed; and, be sure, the Interpreter, who, by force of questioning prisoners, naturally develops into a Sadducee.  It is their little asides to each other, the slang, and the half-words which, if one understood, instead of blinking drowsily at one's plate, would give the day's history in little.  But tire and the difficulties of a sister (not a foreign) tongue cloud everything, and one goes to billets amid a murmur of voices, the rush of single cars through the night, the passage of battalions, and behind it all, the echo of the deep voices calling one to the other, along the line that never sleeps.  .    .    .    .    .    .    .  The ridge with the scattered pines might have hidden children at play.  Certainly a horse would have been quite visible, but there was no hint of guns, except a semaphore which announced it was forbidden to pass that way, as the battery was firing. The Boches must have looked for that battery, too.  The ground was pitted with shell holes of all calibres--some of them as fresh as mole-casts in the misty damp morning; others where the poppies had grown from seed to flower all through the summer.  \"And where are the guns?\" I demanded at last.  They were almost under one's hand, their ammunition in cellars and dug-outs beside them.  As far as one can make out, the 75 gun has no pet name.  The bayonet is Rosalie the virgin of Bayonne, but the 75, the watchful nurse of the trenches and little sister of the Line, seems to be always \"soixante- quinze.\"  Even those who love her best do not insist that she is beautiful.  Her merits are French--logic, directness, simplicity, and the supreme gift of \"occasionality.\"  She is equal to everything on the spur of the moment.  One sees and studies the few appliances which make her do what she does, and one feels that any one could have invented her.  FAMOUS FRENCH 75's  \"As a matter of fact,\" says a commandant, \"anybody--or, rather, everybody did.  The general idea is after such-and-such system, the patent of which had expired, and we improved it; the breech action, with slight modification, is somebody else's; the sighting is perhaps a little special; and so is the traversing, but, at bottom, it is only an assembly of variations and arrangements.\"  That, of course, is all that Shakespeare ever got out of the alphabet.  The French Artillery make their own guns as he made his plays.  It is just as simple as that.  \"There is nothing going on for the moment; it's too misty,\" said the Commandant.  (I fancy that the Boche, being, as a rule methodical, amateurs are introduced to batteries in the Boche's intervals.  At least, there are hours healthy and unhealthy which vary with each position.)  \"But,\" the Commandant reflected a moment, \"there is a place--and a distance.  Let us say  .  .  .  \"  He gave a range.  The gun-servers stood back with the bored contempt of the professional for the layman who intrudes on his mysteries. Other civilians had come that way before--had seen, and grinned, and complimented and gone their way, leaving the gunners high up on the bleak hillside to grill or mildew or freeze for weeks and months.  Then she spoke.  Her voice was higher pitched, it seemed, than ours--with a more shrewish tang to the speeding shell.  Her recoil was as swift and as graceful as the shrug of a French-woman's shoulders; the empty case leaped forth and clanged against the trail; the tops of two or three pines fifty yards away nodded knowingly to each other, though there was no wind.  \"They'll be bothered down below to know the meaning of our single shot.  We don't give them one dose at a time as a rule,\" somebody laughed.  We waited in the fragrant silence.  Nothing came back from the mist that clogged the lower grounds, though no shell of this war was ever launched with more earnest prayers that it might do hurt.  Then they talked about the lives of guns; what number of rounds some will stand and others will not; how soon one can make two good guns out of three spoilt ones, and what crazy luck sometimes goes with a single shot or a blind salvo.  LESSON FROM THE \"BOCHE\"  A shell must fall somewhere, and by the law of averages occasionally lights straight as a homing pigeon on the one spot where it can wreck most.  Then earth opens for yards around, and men must be dug out,--some merely breathless, who shake their ears, swear, and carry on, and others whose souls have gone loose among terrors.  These have to be dealt with as their psychology demands, and the French officer is a good psychologist.  One of them said:  \"Our national psychology has changed.  I do not recognize it myself.\"  \"What made the change?\"  \"The Boche.  If he had been quiet for another twenty years the world must have been his--rotten, but all his.  Now he is saving the world.\"  \"How?\"  \"Because he has shown us what Evil is.  We--you and I, England and the rest--had begun to doubt the existence of Evil.  The Boche is saving us.\"  Then we had another look at the animal in its trench--a little nearer this time than before, and quieter on account of the mist.  Pick up the chain anywhere you please, you shall find the same observation-post, table, map, observer, and telephonist; the same always-hidden, always-ready guns; and same vexed foreshore of trenches, smoking and shaking from Switzerland to the sea.  The handling of the war varies with the nature of the country, but the tools are unaltered.  One looks upon them at last with the same weariness of wonder as the eye receives from endless repetitions of Egyptian hieroglyphics.  A long, low profile, with a lump to one side, means the field-gun and its attendant ammunition-case; a circle and slot stand for an observation-post; the trench is a bent line, studded with vertical plumes of explosion; the great guns of position, coming and going on their motors, repeat themselves as scarabs; and man himself is a small blue smudge, no larger than a foresight, crawling and creeping or watching and running among all these terrific symbols.  TRAGEDY OF RHEIMS  But there is no hieroglyphic for Rheims, no blunting of the mind at the abominations committed on the cathedral there. The thing peers upward, maimed and blinded, from out of the utter wreckage of the Archbishop's palace on the one side and dust-heaps of crumbled houses on the other.  They shelled, as they still shell it, with high explosives and with incendiary shells, so that the statues and the stonework in places are burned the colour of raw flesh.  The gargoyles are smashed; statues, crockets, and spires tumbled; walls split and torn; windows thrust out and tracery obliterated.  Wherever one looks at the tortured pile there is mutilation and defilement, and yet it had never more of a soul than it has to-day.  Inside--(\"Cover yourselves, gentlemen,\" said the sacristan, \"this place is no longer consecrated\")--everything is swept clear or burned out from end to end, except two candlesticks in front of the niche where Joan of Arc's image used to stand. There is a French flag there now.  [And the last time I saw Rheims Cathedral was in a spring twilight, when the great west window glowed, and the only lights within were those of candles which some penitent English had lit in Joan's honour on those same candlesticks.]  The high altar was covered with floor-carpets; the pavement tiles were cracked and jarred out by the rubbish that had fallen from above, the floor was gritty with dust of glass and powdered stone, little twists of leading from the windows, and iron fragments.  Two great doors had been blown inwards by the blast of a shell in the Archbishop's garden, till they had bent grotesquely to the curve of a cask.  There they had jammed.  The windows--but the record has been made, and will be kept by better hands than mine.  It will last through the generation in which the Teuton is cut off from the fellowship of mankind--all the long, still years when this war of the body is at an end, and the real war begins.  Rheims is but one of the altars which the heathen have put up to commemorate their own death throughout all the world.  It will serve.  There is a mark, well known by now, which they have left for a visible seal of their doom.  When they first set the place alight some hundreds of their wounded were being tended in the Cathedral.  The French saved as many as they could, but some had to be left.  Among them was a major, who lay with his back against a pillar.  It has been ordained that the signs of his torments should remain--an outline of both legs and half a body, printed in greasy black upon the stones.  There are very many people who hope and pray that the sign will be respected at least by our children's children.  IRON NERVE AND FAITH  And, in the meantime, Rheims goes about what business it may have with that iron nerve and endurance and faith which is the new inheritance of France.  There is agony enough when the big shells come in; there is pain and terror among the people; and always fresh desecration to watch and suffer.  The old men and the women and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12454"],["title","France at War: On the Frontier of Civilization (#3)"],["body","children drink of that cup daily, and yet the bitterness does not enter into their souls.  Mere words of admiration are impertinent, but the exquisite quality of the French soul has been the marvel to me throughout.  They say themselves, when they talk:  \"We did not know what our nation was.  Frankly, we did not expect it ourselves.  But the thing came, and--you see, we go on.\"  Or as a woman put it more logically, \"What else can we do? Remember, _we_ knew the Boche in '70 when _you_ did not.  We know what he has done in the last year.  This is not war.  It is against wild beasts that we fight.  There is no arrangement possible with wild beasts.\"  This is the one vital point which we in England _must_ realize.  We are dealing with animals who have scientifically and philosophically removed themselves inconceivably outside civilization.  When you have heard a few--only a few--tales of their doings, you begin to understand a little.  When you have seen Rheims, you understand a little more.  When you have looked long enough at the faces of the women, you are inclined to think that the women will have a large say in the final judgment.  They have earned it a thousand times.     III  BATTLE SPECTACLE AND A REVIEW  Travelling with two chauffeurs is not the luxury it looks; since there is only one of you and there is always another of those iron men to relieve the wheel.  Nor can I decide whether an ex-professor of the German tongue, or an ex-roadracer who has lived six years abroad, or a Marechal des Logis, or a Brigadier makes the most thrusting driver through three-mile stretches of military traffic repeated at half-hour intervals. Sometimes it was motor-ambulances strung all along a level; or supply; or those eternal big guns coming round corners with trees chained on their long backs to puzzle aeroplanes, and their leafy, big-shell limbers snorting behind them.  In the rare breathing-spaces men with rollers and road metal attacked the road.  In peace the roads of France, thanks to the motor, were none too good.  In war they stand the incessant traffic far better than they did with the tourist.  My impression --after some seven hundred miles printed off on me at between 60 and 70 kilometres--was of uniform excellence.  Nor did I come upon any smashes or breakdowns in that distance, and they were certainly trying them hard.  Nor, which is the greater marvel, did _we_ kill anybody; though we did miracles down the streets to avoid babes, kittens, and chickens.  The land is used to every detail of war, and to its grime and horror and make-shifts, but also to war's unbounded courtesy, kindness, and long-suffering, and the gaiety that comes, thank God, to balance overwhelming material loss.  FARM LIFE AMIDST WAR  There was a village that had been stamped flat, till it looked older than Pompeii.  There were not three roofs left, nor one whole house.  In most places you saw straight into the cellars.  The hops were ripe in the grave-dotted fields round about.  They had been brought in and piled in the nearest outline of a dwelling.  Women sat on chairs on the pavement, picking the good-smelling bundles.  When they had finished one, they reached back and pulled out another through the window-hole behind them, talking and laughing the while.  A cart had to be maneuvered out of what had been a farmyard, to take the hops to market.  A thick, broad, fair-haired wench, of the sort that Millet drew, flung all her weight on a spoke and brought the cart forward into the street.  Then she shook herself, and, hands on hips, danced a little defiant jig in her sabots as she went back to get the horse.  Another girl came across a bridge.  She was precisely of the opposite type, slender, creamy-skinned, and delicate-featured.  She carried a brand-new broom over her shoulder through that desolation, and bore herself with the pride and grace of Queen Iseult.  The farm-girl came out leading the horse, and as the two young things passed they nodded and smiled at each other, with the delicate tangle of the hop-vines at their feet.  The guns spoke earnestly in the north.  That was the Argonne, where the Crown Prince was busily getting rid of a few thousands of his father's faithful subjects in order to secure himself the reversion of his father's throne.  No man likes losing his job, and when at long last the inner history of this war comes to be written, we may find that the people we mistook for principals and prime agents were only average incompetents moving all Hell to avoid dismissal.  (For it is absolutely true that when a man sells his soul to the devil he does it for the price of half nothing.)  WATCHING THE GUN-FIRE  It must have been a hot fight.  A village, wrecked as is usual along this line, opened on it from a hillside that overlooked an Italian landscape of carefully drawn hills studded with small villages--a plain with a road and a river in the foreground, and an all-revealing afternoon light upon everything.  The hills smoked and shook and bellowed.  An observation-balloon climbed up to see; while an aeroplane which had nothing to do with the strife, but was merely training a beginner, ducked and swooped on the edge of the plain.  Two rose-pink pillars of crumbled masonry, guarding some carefully trimmed evergreens on a lawn half buried in rubbish, represented an hotel where the Crown Prince had once stayed.  All up the hillside to our right the foundations of houses lay out, like a bit of tripe, with the sunshine in their square hollows.  Suddenly a band began to play up the hill among some trees; and an officer of local Guards in the new steel anti-shrapnel helmet, which is like the seventeenth century sallet, suggested that we should climb and get a better view.  He was a kindly man, and in speaking English had discovered (as I do when speaking French) that it is simpler to stick to one gender.  His choice was the feminine, and the Boche described as \"she\" throughout made me think better of myself, which is the essence of friendship.  We climbed a flight of old stone steps, for generations the playground of little children, and found a ruined church, and a battalion in billets, recreating themselves with excellent music and a little horseplay on the outer edge of the crowd.  The trouble in the hills was none of their business for that day.  Still higher up, on a narrow path among the trees, stood a priest and three or four officers.  They watched the battle and claimed the great bursts of smoke for one side or the other, at the same time as they kept an eye on the flickering aeroplane.  \"Ours,\" they said, half under their breath. \"Theirs.\"  \"No, not ours that one--theirs!  .  .  .  That fool is banking too steep  .  .  .  That's Boche shrapnel.  They always burst it high.  That's our big gun behind that outer hill  .  .  .  He'll drop his machine in the street if he doesn't take care  .  .  .  There goes a trench-sweeper. Those last two were theirs, but _that_\"--it was a full roar --\"was ours.\"  BEHIND THE GERMAN LINES  The valley held and increased the sounds till they seemed to hit our hillside like a sea.  A change of light showed a village, exquisitely pencilled atop of a hill, with reddish haze at its feet.  \"What is that place?\" I asked.  The priest replied in a voice as deep as an organ:  \"That is Saint------  It is in the Boche lines.  Its condition is pitiable.\"  The thunders and the smokes rolled up and diminished and renewed themselves, but the small children romped up and down the old stone steps; the beginner's aeroplane unsteadily chased its own shadow over the fields; and the soldiers in billet asked the band for their favourite tunes.  Said the lieutenant of local Guards as the cars went on: \"She--play--Tipperary.\"  And she did--to an accompaniment of heavy pieces in the hills, which followed us into a town all ringed with enormous searchlights, French and Boche together, scowling at each other beneath the stars.  .        .        .        .  It happened about that time that Lord Kitchener with General Joffre reviewed a French Army Corps.  We came on it in a vast dip of ground under grey clouds, as one comes suddenly on water; for it lay out in misty blue lakes of men mixed with darker patches, like osiers and undergrowth, of guns, horses, and wagons.  A straight road cut the landscape in two along its murmuring front.  VETERANS OF THE WAR  It was as though Cadmus had sown the dragon's teeth, not in orderly furrows but broadcast, till, horrified by what arose, he had emptied out the whole bag and fled.  But these were no new warriors.  The record of their mere pitched battles would have satiated a Napoleon.  Their regiments and batteries had learnt to achieve the impossible as a matter of routine, and in twelve months they had scarcely for a week lost direct contact with death.  We went down the line and looked into the eyes of those men with the used bayonets and rifles; the packs that could almost stow themselves on the shoulders that would be strange without them; at the splashed guns on their repaired wheels, and the easy-working limbers.  One could feel the strength and power of the mass as one feels the flush of heat from off a sunbaked wall.  When the Generals' cars arrived there, there was no loud word or galloping about.  The lakes of men gathered into straight-edged battalions; the batteries aligned a little; a squadron reined back or spurred up; but it was all as swiftly smooth as the certainty with which a man used to the pistol draws and levels it at the required moment.  A few peasant women saw the Generals alight. The aeroplanes, which had been skimming low as swallows along the front of the line (theirs must have been a superb view) ascended leisurely, and \"waited on\" like hawks.  Then followed the inspection, and one saw the two figures, tall and short, growing smaller side by side along the white road, till far off among the cavalry they entered their cars again, and moved along"]]]
