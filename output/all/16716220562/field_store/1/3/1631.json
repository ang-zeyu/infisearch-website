'If that doesna touch the spot,' said Christina, 'I'm a duchess.'  They sat down to tea.  Much to Willie's relief, Christina apparently forgot all about a blessing.  Anxious to please, he expressed admiration at the abundance of good things.  'I like to see a table groanin',' said the hospitable hostess.  'There'll be mair nor the table groanin' afore lang,' observed Macgregor.  They all laughed like happy people, especially Willie, until with a start he remembered the cream cookies and his omission to bring an extra hanky.  All the same, he proceeded to enjoy himself pretty heartily, and did the agreeable to the best of his ability, furnishing sundry anecdotes of camp life which were as new to Macgregor as they probably were to himself.  At last--  'Try a cream cookie,' said Christina.  But he could not face it.  'Cream,' he said mournfully, 'doesna agree wi' me.  The last time I had cream--ma aunt had got it in for her cat that had the staggers--I lay in agony for three days an' three nichts an' several 'oors into the bargain.  Ma aunt feared I was gaun to croak ma last.'  Macgregor made a choking sound, while Christina gravely hoped that the cat had also recovered, and passed the macaroons.  'Thenk ye,' said Willie, and readily resumed operations.  But he was not a little disgusted to note presently that Christina and Macgregor enjoyed their cream cookies without the slightest mishap.  His geniality was not fully restored until, at the end of the meal, Christina laid a box of superior cigarettes between her two guests.  'May I drap deid in five meenutes,' he declared, 'if ever I was treated like this afore!  Macgreegor, ye're jist a damp lucky deevil!'  'Oh, whisht!' said Christina smiling.  'Ye should get a girl, Wullie,' Macgregor remarked with the air of an old married man.  'I ha'ena your luck, ma lad.  If I was trustin' a girl, I'll bet ye a bob she wud turn oot to be yin o' the sort that pinches a chap's wages afore they're warmed in his pooch, an' objec's to him smokin' a fag, an' tak's the huff if he calls her fig-face.'  'I'm afraid ye're a pessimist,' Christina said.  'I used to dae a bit in that line masel'.  Ma favourite motto was: \"Cheer up--ye'll soon be deid!\"  But I got past that, an' so will you.'  With a sardonic smile Willie shook his head and took another cigarette; and just then Christina had to go to attend to a customer.  Willie turned to his friend.   'Thon was a dirty trick aboot the cookies.  I've a guid mind to bide here as lang as you.'  'I didna think ye wud hae been feart for a cookie, Wullie.  Of course, I'll never tell her.'  'Weel, I accep' yer apology.  Can ye len' us thruppence?  I want to purchase some War Loan. . . .  By Jings, ye're no a bad sort, Macgreegor. . . .  Hoo dae ye think I behaved masel'?'  'No that bad.'  'Weel, I want ye to tell her I ha'end enjoyed masel' sae much since ma Uncle Peter's funeral, ten year back.'  'Tell her yersel'.'  Willie pocketed a few of the superior cigarettes, and rose.  'It's sax-thirty,' he said.  'Her an' you'll be nane the waur o' hauf an' 'oor in private.  See?  So long!  She's a clinker!'  And before Macgregor realized it, Willie had bolted through the shop and into the street.  Christina returned, her eyes wide.  'What gaed wrang wi' him, Mac?'  'Come here an' I'll tell ye.'     XIII  MISS TOD RETURNS  'It was awfu' dacent o' Wullie to clear oot,' Macgregor remarked happily, as he moved his chair close to the one on which Christina had just seated herself.  Christina's chin went up.  'It wud ha'e been dacenter o' him to ha'e waited till the time he was invited to wait.'  'But he meant weel.  I'm sure he didna want to gang, but he fancied it wud be nice to let you an' me ha'e a--a . . .'  'I beg yer pardon?'  'Ach, ye ken what I mean.  He fancied we wud enjoy a wee whiley jist by oorsel's.'  'Speak for yersel'! I'm thinkin' it was exceedingly rude o' him to slope wi'oot tellin' me he had enjoyed his tea.'  'He asked me to tell ye that he hadna enjoyed hissel' sae weel since his uncle's funeral, ten year back.'  Christina gave a little sniff.  'That's a nice sort o' compliment. Funeral, indeed!'  'Christina! what's vexin' ye?'  'Wha said I was vexed?'  'I've seen ye lookin' happier.'  'Are ye a judge o' happiness?'  'I ken when I'm no happy--an' that's the noo.  But I warn ye, I'm no gaun to stick it!'  'What's made ye unhappy?' she coldly inquired.  'You !'  'Dear me!'--ironically.  'Ay, jist dear you!'  And with these words he caught her round the shoulders and kissed her.  Breathless and rather ruffled she exclaimed, 'If ye dae that again, I'll----'  He did it again.  'Ye're gettin' terrible forward,' she said, half angry, half amused.  'High time!'  She regarded him with amazement.  Suddenly he said: 'Ye're as much mines as I'm yours.  Deny it, if ye can.'  For perhaps the first time in her life Christina temporized.  'Can ye sweer ye didna arrange wi' Wullie to leave early?'  'Eh?'  The note of innocence satisfied her.  'Weel,' she said graciously, 'I forgive ye.'  'What for?'  'Takin' liberties.'  Her lips wavered to a smile and he could not refrain from kissing them once more.  'Here, hauf time!' she cried, and burst out laughing.  'This is the best yet,' he said jubilantly.  'Three goals in twa meenutes!  In future I'll kiss ye as often as I like.'  'We'll see aboot that. . . .  The sojerin' has changed ye a lot,' she added thoughtfully.  'D'ye no like the improvement?'  'I'll tell ye when I observe it.  Noo sit still an' behave yersel', an' tell me the latest camp rumours.'  Just then the bell over the door in the shop went off.  'Oh, dash yer customers!' said Macgregor.  Christina was moving from the room when----  'Are ye there, dearie?' called a familiar female voice.  'Holy Moses!' she whispered.  'It's Miss Tod, hame three days afore her time.'  'Oh, criffens!' gasped Macgregor.  'What'll I dae?'  'Ye can either hide in the coal bunker, or bide whaur ye are--like a sojer.  She'll no devour ye.'  Christina then ran out to receive her employer, which she did without embarrassment.  'What a peety ye're ower late for ma wee tea-pairty.  An' hoo are ye?' Macgregor heard her saying.  'Aw, I was sweirt to disturb ye wi' yer' frien's, lassie,' replied Miss Tod, who had been advised by postcard of Christina's doings, 'but I _couldna_ bide in thon place anither nicht.'  'Dear, dear!' the girl said sympathizingly.  'Did ye no get on wi' yer auld frien', or did the poultry attack ye?  Come ben, come ben. There's jist Macgreegor left, an' he hasna consumed absolutely everything.  I'll get ye a cup o' fresh tea in a jiffy.'  Smiling faintly but kindly, Miss Tod greeted Macgregor, apologized for disturbing him, and subsided into her old chair.  'Oh, I'm thenkfu' to be hame,' she sighed, while Christina flew to her hospitable duties.  'Ye've got the room awfu' nice, dearie.'  'Does the smell o' the ceegarettes annoy ye?' inquired Macgregor, now more at ease, though still ashamed of his recent panic.  'Na, na; it's jist deleecious,' she protested, 'efter the smell o' the country.'  'Did ye no like the country, Miss Tod?'  'Maybe I could ha'e endured it till the week was up, if it hadna been for ma auld frien'.  Ye see, the puir body couldna speak or think o' onything excep' airyplanes fleein' through the air an' drappin' bombs on her dwellin' hoose an' her hen-hoose, no forgettin' her pig-hoose.  Mornin', noon an' nicht, she kep' speirin' at me if I was prepared to meet ma Maker, maybe wantin' a leg.  Oh, I was rale vexed for her, I tell ye, but when she took the mattress aff ma bed to protect her sewin' machine frae bombs, I says to masel': 'If I've got to dee, I wud like to dae it as comfortable as I can, an' I'm sure ma Maker'll no objec' to that . . .  an' so, at last, I jist tied up ma things in the broon paper, an' said I had enjoyed masel' fine, but was anxious aboot the shop--a terrible falsehood, dearie!--an' gaed to catch the sax o'clock train, an' catched the yin afore it. . . .  An' here I am. I wud ha'e let ye enjoy yer pairty in peace, but what wi' the forebodin's o' ma auld frien' an' the scent o' the hens an' pigs, I could thole nae longer.'  'In short,' Christina brightly remarked, 'ye was completely fed up. Weel, weel, ye'll sune forget aboot yer troubles in the joys o' pursuin' pastries.  We'll fetch the table close to ye so as ye can fall to wi'oot unduly streetchin' yer neck.  Mac, get busy!  Toast this cookie.'  'She's a great manager,' Miss Tod said, smiling to Macgregor.  'But she'll mak' ye a rael guid wife when ye come back frae the wars----'  'Oh, whisht, Miss Tod!' cried Christina.  'Ye'll cause him to blush.'  Which was rather a mean way of diverting attention from her own complexion.  However, at that moment the bell rang, and exclaiming, 'Anither boom in trade!' she darted into the shop.  The customer seemed to be in a great hurry, for almost immediately she reappeared in the sitting-room.  She was smiling and carried a small package in her hand.  'Guess wha it was,' said she.  'The meenister,' replied Miss Tod, who for some mysterious reason always guessed the reverend gentleman, who happened to be a customer.  'On the contrary,' said Christina.  'Wullie Thomson,' said Macgregor, suddenly remembering the borrowed threepence.  'Up dux!  Ye deserve a sweetie.'  She presented the bag, open. 'What sort are they?'  He laughed and answered--'War Loan Lozengers.'     XIV  AUNT PURDIE INTERVENES  The battalion was not an hour returned from the longest, hottest, dustiest and most exhausting route march yet experienced. Macgregor was stretched on his bed, a newspaper over his face, when an orderly shook him and shoved a visiting card into his hand.  'She's waitin' ootside,' he said and, with a laugh, departed.

THE HISTORY OF PUERTO RICO      FROM THE SPANISH DISCOVERY TO THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION      BY R.A. VAN MIDDELDYK      EDITED BY MARTIN G. BRUMBAUGH, PH.D., LL.D. PROFESSOR OF PEDAGOGY,   UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND FIRST COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION FOR   PUERTO RICO    COPYRIGHT, 1903  [Illustration: Columbus statue, San Juan.]     EDITOR'S PREFACE  The latest permanent possession of the United States is also the oldest in point of European occupation. The island of Puerto Rico was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was occupied by the United States Army at Guanica July 25, 1898. Spain formally evacuated the island October 18, 1898, and military government was established until Congress made provision for its control. By act of Congress, approved April 12, 1900, the military control terminated and civil government was formally instituted May 1,1900.  Puerto Rico has an interesting history. Its four centuries under Spanish control is a record of unusual and remarkable events. This record is unknown to the American people. It has never been written satisfactorily in the Spanish language, and not at all in the English language. The author of this volume is the first to give to the reader of English a record of Spanish rule in this \"pearl of the Antilles.\" Mr. Van Middeldyk is the librarian of the Free Public Library of San Juan, an institution created under American civil control. He has had access to all data obtainable in the island, and has faithfully and conscientiously woven this data into a connected narrative, thus giving the reader a view of the social and institutional life of the island for four hundred years.  The author has endeavored to portray salient characteristics of the life on the island, to describe the various acts of the reigning government, to point out the evils of colonial rule, and to figure the general historical and geographical conditions in a manner that enables the reader to form a fairly accurate judgment of the past and present state of Puerto Rico.  No attempt has been made to speculate upon the setting of this record in the larger record of Spanish life. That is a work for the future. But enough history of Spain and in general of continental Europe is given to render intelligible the various and varied governmental activities exercised by Spain in the island. There is, no doubt, much omitted that future research may reveal, and yet it is just to state that the record is fairly continuous, and that no salient factors in the island's history have been overlooked.  The people of Puerto Rico were loyal and submissive to their parent government. No record of revolts and excessive rioting is recorded. The island has been continuously profitable to Spain. With even ordinarily fair administration of government the people have been self-supporting, and in many cases have rendered substantial aid to other Spanish possessions. Her native life--the Boriquén Indians--rapidly became extinct, due to the \"gold fever\" and the intermarriage of races. The peon class has always been a faithful laboring class in the coffee, sugar, and tobacco estates, and the slave element was never large. A few landowners and the professional classes dominate the island's life. There is no middle class. There is an utter absence of the legitimate fruits of democratic institutions. The poor are in every way objects of pity and of sympathy. They are the hope of the island. By education, widely diffused, a great unrest will ensue, and from this unrest will come the social, moral, and civic uplift of the people.  These people do not suffer from the lack of civilization. They suffer from the kind of civilization they have endured. The life of the people is static. Her institutions and customs are so set upon them that one is most impressed with the absence of legitimate activities. The people are stoically content. Such, at least, was the condition in 1898. Under the military government of the United States much was done to prepare the way for future advance. Its weakness was due to its effectiveness. It did for the people what they should learn to do for themselves. The island needed a radically new governmental activity--an activity that would develop each citizen into a self-respecting and self-directing force in the island's uplift. This has been supplied by the institution of civil government. The outlook of the people is now infinitely better than ever before. The progress now being made is permanent. It is an advance made by the people for themselves. Civil government is the fundamental need of the island.  Under civil government the entire reorganization of the life of the people is being rapidly effected. The agricultural status of the island was never so hopeful. The commercial activity is greatly increased. The educational awakening is universal and healthy. Notwithstanding the disastrous cyclone of 1898, and the confusion incident to a radical governmental reorganization, the wealth per capita has increased, the home life is improved, and the illiteracy of the people is being rapidly lessened.  President McKinley declared to the writer that it was his desire \"to put the conscience of the American people into the islands of the sea.\" This has been done. The result is apparent. Under wise and conservative guidance by the American executive officers, the people of Puerto Rico have turned to this Republic with a patriotism, a zeal, an enthusiasm that is, perhaps, without a parallel.  In 1898, under President McKinley as commander-in-chief, the army of the United States forcibly invaded this island. This occupation, by the treaty of Paris, became permanent. Congress promptly provided civil government for the island, and in 1901 this conquered people, almost one million in number, shared in the keen grief that attended universally the untimely death of their conqueror. The island on the occasion of the martyr's death was plunged in profound sorrow, and at a hundred memorial services President McKinley was mourned by thousands, and he was tenderly characterized as \"the founder of human liberty in Puerto Rico.\"  The judgment of the American people relative to this island is based upon meager data. The legal processes attending its entrance into the Union have been the occasion of much comment. This comment has invariably lent itself to a discussion of the effect of judicial decision upon our home institutions. It has been largely a speculative concern. In some cases it has become a political concern in the narrowest partizan sense. The effect of all this upon the people of Puerto Rico has not been considered. Their rights and their needs have not come to us. We have not taken President McKinley's broad, humane, and exalted view of our obligation to these people. They have implicitly entrusted their life, liberty, and property to our guardianship. The great Republic has a debt of honor to the island which indifference and ignorance of its needs can never pay. It is hoped that this record of their struggles during four centuries will be a welcome source of insight and guidance to the people of the United States in their efforts to see their duty and do it.  M. G. BRUMBAUGH. PHILADELPHIA, _January 1, 1903_.     AUTHOR'S PREFACE  Some years ago, Mr. Manuel Elzaburu, President of the San Juan Provincial Atheneum, in a public speech, gave it as his opinion that the modern historian of Puerto Rico had yet to appear. This was said, not in disparagement of the island's only existing history, but rather as a confirmation of the general opinion that the book which does duty as such is incorrect and incomplete.  This book is Friar Iñigo Abbad's Historia de la Isla San Juan Bautista, which was written in 1782 by disposition of the Count of Floridablanca, the Minister of Colonies of Charles III, and published in Madrid in 1788. In 1830 it was reproduced in San Juan without any change in the text, and in 1866 Mr. José Julian Acosta published a new edition with copious notes, comments, and additions, which added much data relative to the Benedictine monks, corrected numerous errors, and supplemented the chapters, some of which, in the original, are exceedingly short, the whole history terminating abruptly with the nineteenth chapter, that is, with the beginning of the eighteenth century. The remaining 21 chapters are merely descriptive of the country and people.  Besides this work there are others by Puerto Rican authors, each one elucidating one or more phases of the island's history. With these separate and diverse materials, supplemented by others of my own, I have constructed the present history.  The transcendental change in the island's social and political conditions, inaugurated four years ago, made the writing of an English history of Puerto Rico necessary. The American officials who are called upon to guide the destinies and watch over the moral, material, and intellectual progress of the inhabitants of this new accession to the great Republic will be able to do so all the better when they have a knowledge of the people's historical antecedents.  I have endeavored to supply this need to the best of my ability, and herewith offer to the public the results of an arduous, though self-imposed task.  R.A.V.M.
