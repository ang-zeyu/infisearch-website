In woods in which the fibre walls show all gradations of thickness--in other words, where the transition from the thin-walled cells of the early wood to the thick-walled cells of the late wood is gradual--the two kinds of failure, namely, buckling and bending, grade into each other. In woods with very decided contrast between early and late wood the two forms are usually distinct. Except in the case of complete failure the cavity of the deformed cells remains open, and in hardwoods this is true not only of the wood fibres but also of the tube-like vessels. In many cases longitudinal splits occur which isolate bundles of elements by greater or less intervals. The splitting occurs by a tearing of the fibres or rays and not by the separation of the rays from the adjacent elements.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Failures of short columns of green spruce.]  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Failures of short columns of dry chestnut.]  Moisture in wood decreases the stiffness of the fibre walls and enlarges the region of failure. The curve which the fibre walls make in the region of failure is more gradual and also more irregular than in dry wood, and the fibres are more likely to be separated.  In examining the lines of rupture in compression parallel to the grain it appears that there does not exist any specific type, that is, one that is characteristic of all woods. Test blocks taken from different parts of the same log may show very decided differences in the manner of failure, while blocks that are much alike in the size, number, and distribution of the elements of unequal resistance may behave very similarly. The direction of rupture is, according to Jaccard, not influenced by the distribution of the medullary rays.[7] These are curved with the bundles of fibres to which they are attached. In any case the failure starts at the weakest points and follows the lines of least resistance. The plane of failure, as visible on radial surfaces, is horizontal, and on the tangential surface it is diagonal.  [Footnote 7: This does not correspond exactly with the conclusions of A. Thil, who says (\"Constitution anatomique du bois,\" pp. 140-141): \"The sides of the medullary rays sometimes produce planes of least resistance varying in size with the height of the rays. The medullary rays assume a direction more or less parallel to the lumen of the cells on which they border; the latter curve to the right or left to make room for the ray and then close again beyond it. If the force acts parallel to the axis of growth, the tracheids are more likely to be displaced if the marginal cells of the medullary rays are provided with weak walls that are readily compressed. This explains why on the radial surface of the test blocks the plane of rupture passes in a direction nearly following a medullary ray, whereas on the tangential surface the direction of the plane of rupture is oblique--but with an obliquity varying with the species and determined by the pitch of the spirals along which the medullary rays are distributed in the stem.\" See Jaccard, _op. cit._, pp. 57 _et seq._]    SHEARING STRENGTH   Whenever forces act upon a body in such a way that one portion tends to slide upon another adjacent to it the action is called a ~shear~.[8] In wood this shearing action may be (1) ~along the grain~, or (2) ~across the grain~. A tenon breaking out its mortise is a familiar example of shear along the grain, while the shoving off of the tenon itself would be shear across the grain. The use of wood for pins or tree-nails involves resistance to shear across the grain. Another common instance of the latter is where the steel edge of the eye of an axe or hammer tends to cut off the handle. In Fig. 10 the action of the wooden strut tends to shear off along the grain the portion _AB_ of the wooden tie rod, and it is essential that the length of this portion be great enough to guard against it. Fig. 11 shows characteristic failures in shear along the grain.  [Footnote 8: Shear should not be confused with ordinary cutting or incision.]  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Example of shear along the grain.]  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Failures of test specimens in shear along the grain. In the block at the left the surface of failure is radial; in the one at the right, tangential]  |---------------------------------------------| |                  TABLE VII                  | |---------------------------------------------| | SHEARING STRENGTH ALONG THE GRAIN OF SMALL  | | CLEAR PIECES OF 41 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION | |          (Forest Service Cir. 213)          | |---------------------------------------------| |                   |    When    |    When    | |   COMMON NAME     | surface of | surface of | |   OF SPECIES      | failure is | failure is | |                   |   radial   | tangential | |-------------------+------------+------------| |                   |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  | |                   |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  | |                   |            |            | |    Hardwoods      |            |            | |                   |            |            | | Ash, black        |      876   |      832   | |   white           |    1,360   |    1,312   | | Basswood          |      560   |      617   | | Beech             |    1,154   |    1,375   | | Birch, yellow     |    1,103   |    1,188   | | Elm, slippery     |    1,197   |    1,174   | |   white           |      778   |      872   | | Hackberry         |    1,095   |    1,161   | | Hickory,          |            |            | |   big shellbark   |    1,134   |    1,191   | |   bitternut       |    1,134   |    1,348   | |   mockernut       |    1,251   |    1,313   | |   nutmeg          |    1,010   |    1,053   | |   pignut          |    1,334   |    1,457   | |   shagbark        |    1,230   |    1,297   | |   water           |    1,390   |    1,490   | | Locust, honey     |    1,885   |    2,096   | | Maple, red        |    1,130   |    1,330   | |   sugar           |    1,193   |    1,455   | | Oak, post         |    1,196   |    1,402   | |   red             |    1,132   |    1,195   | |   swamp white     |    1,198   |    1,394   | |   white           |    1,096   |    1,292   | |   yellow          |    1,162   |    1,196   | | Sycamore          |      900   |    1,102   | | Tupelo            |      978   |    1,084   | |                   |            |            | |    Conifers       |            |            | |                   |            |            | | Arborvitæ         |      617   |      614   | | Cedar, incense    |      613   |      662   | | Cypress, bald     |      836   |      800   | | Fir, alpine       |      573   |      654   | |   amabilis        |      517   |      639   | |   Douglas         |      853   |      858   | |   white           |      742   |      723   | | Hemlock           |      790   |      813   | | Pine, lodgepole   |      672   |      747   | |   longleaf        |    1,060   |      953   | |   red             |      812   |      741   | |   sugar           |      702   |      714   | |   western yellow  |      686   |      706   | |   white           |      649   |      639   | | Spruce, Engelmann |      607   |      624   | | Tamarack          |      883   |      843   | |---------------------------------------------|  Both shearing stresses may act at the same time. Thus the weight carried by a beam tends to shear it off at right angles to the axis; this stress is equal to the resultant force acting perpendicularly at any point, and in a beam uniformly loaded and supported at either end is maximum at the points of support and zero at the centre. In addition there is a shearing force tending to move the fibres of the beam past each other in a longitudinal direction. (See Fig. 12.) This longitudinal shear is maximum at the neutral plane and decreases toward the upper and lower surfaces.  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Horizontal shear in a beam.]  Shearing across the grain is so closely related to compression at right angles to the grain and to hardness that there is little to be gained by making separate tests upon it. Knowledge of shear parallel to the grain is important, since wood frequently fails in that way. The value of shearing stress parallel to the grain is found by dividing the maximum load in pounds (P) by the area of the cross section in inches (A).       {          P  }      { Shear = --- }      {          A  }  Oblique shearing stresses are developed in a bar when it is subjected to direct tension or compression. The maximum shearing stress occurs along a plane when it makes an angle of 45 degrees                                                        P with the axis of the specimen. In this case, shear = -----. When                                                       2 A the value of the angle [Greek: theta] is less than 45 degrees,                              P the shear along the plane = --- sin [Greek: theta] cos [Greek:                              A theta]. (See Fig. 13.) The effect of oblique shear is often visible in the failures of short columns. (See Fig. 14.)

Within the elastic limit the relative stretching and contraction of the fibres is directly[9] proportional to their distances from a plane intermediate between them--the ~neutral plane~. (N_{1} P in Fig. 15.) Thus the fibres half-way between the neutral plane and the outer surface experience only half as much shortening or elongation as the outermost or extreme fibres. Similarly for other distances. The elements along the neutral plane experience no tension or compression in an axial direction. The line of intersection of this plane and the plane of section is known as the ~neutral axis~ (N A in Fig. 15) of the section.  [Footnote 9: While in reality this relationship does not exactly hold, the formulæ for beams are based on its assumption.]  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Diagram of a simple beam. N_{1} P = neutral plane, N A = neutral axis of section R S.]  If the bar is symmetrical and homogeneous the neutral plane is located half-way between the upper and lower surfaces, so long as the deflection does not exceed the elastic limit of the material. Owing to the fact that the tensile strength of wood is from two to nearly four times the compressive strength, it follows that at rupture the neutral plane is much nearer the convex than the concave side of the bar or beam, since the sum of all the compressive stresses on the concave portion must always equal the sum of the tensile stresses on the convex portion. The neutral plane begins to change from its central position as soon as the elastic limit has been passed. Its location at any time is very uncertain.  The external forces acting to bend the bar also tend to rupture it at right angles to the neutral plane by causing one transverse section to slip past another. This stress at any point is equal to the resultant perpendicular to the axis of the forces acting at this point, and is termed the ~transverse shear~ (or in the case of beams, ~vertical shear~).  In addition to this there is a shearing stress, tending to move the fibres past one another in an axial direction, which is called ~longitudinal shear~ (or in the case of beams, ~horizontal shear~). This stress must be taken into consideration in the design of timber structures. It is maximum at the neutral plane and decreases to zero at the outer elements of the section. The shorter the span of a beam in proportion to its height, the greater is the liability of failure in horizontal shear before the ultimate strength of the beam is reached.   _Beams_  There are three common forms of beams, as follows:  (1) ~Simple beam~--a bar resting upon two supports, one near each end. (See Fig. 16, No. 1.)  (2) ~Cantilever beam~--a bar resting upon one support or fulcrum, or that portion of any beam projecting out of a wall or beyond a support. (See Fig. 16, No. 2.)  (3) ~Continuous beam~--a bar resting upon more than two supports. (See Fig. 16, No. 3.)  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Three common forms of beams. 1. Simple. 2. Cantilever. 3. Continuous.]   _Stiffness of Beams_  The two main requirements of a beam are stiffness and strength. The formulæ for the _modulus of elasticity (E)_ or measure of stiffness of a rectangular prismatic simple beam loaded at the centre and resting freely on supports at either end is:[10]  [Footnote 10: Only this form of beam is considered since it is the simplest. For cantilever and continuous beams, and beams rigidly fixed at one or both ends, as well as for different methods of loading, different forms of cross section, etc., other formulæ are required. See any book on mechanics.]             P' l^{3}      E = -------------           4 D b h^{3}     b = breadth or width of beam, inches.    h = height or depth of beam, inches.    l = span (length between points of supports) of beam, inches.    D = deflection produced by load P', inches.   P' = load at or below elastic limit, pounds.  From this formulæ it is evident that for rectangular beams of the same material, mode of support, and loading, the deflection is affected as follows:  (1) It is inversely proportional to the width for beams of the same length and depth. If the width is tripled the deflection is one-third as great.  (2) It is inversely proportional to the cube of the depth for beams of the same length and breadth. If the depth is tripled the deflection is one twenty-seventh as great.  (3) It is directly proportional to the cube of the span for beams of the same breadth and depth. Tripling the span gives twenty-seven times the deflection.  The number of pounds which concentrated at the centre will deflect a rectangular prismatic simple beam one inch may be found from the preceding formulæ by substituting D = 1\" and solving for P'. The formulæ then becomes:                                4 E b h^{3}      Necessary weight (P') = -------------                                  l^{3}  In this case the values for E are read from tables prepared from data obtained by experimentation on the given material.   _Strength of Beams_  The measure of the breaking strength of a beam is expressed in terms of unit stress by a _modulus of rupture_, which is a purely hypothetical expression for points beyond the elastic limit. The formulæ used in computing this modulus is as follows:            1.5 P l      R = ---------           b h{^2}    b, h, l = breadth, height, and span, respectively, as in     preceding formulæ.   R = modulus of rupture, pounds per square inch.   P = maximum load, pounds.  In calculating the fibre stress at the elastic limit the same formulæ is used except that the load at elastic limit (P_{1}) is substituted for the maximum load (P).  From this formulæ it is evident that for rectangular prismatic beams of the same material, mode of support, and loading, the load which a given beam can support varies as follows:  (1) It is directly proportional to the breadth for beams of the same length and depth, as is the case with stiffness.  (2) It is directly proportional to the square of the height for beams of the same length and breadth, instead of as the cube of this dimension as in stiffness.  (3) It is inversely proportional to the span for beams of the same breadth and depth and not to the cube of this dimension as in stiffness.  The fact that the strength varies as the _square_ of the height and the stiffness as the _cube_ explains the relationship of bending to thickness. Were the law the same for strength and stiffness a thin piece of material such as a sheet of paper could not be bent any further without breaking than a thick piece, say an inch board. |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |                                      TABLE IX                                       | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | RESULTS OF STATIC BENDING TESTS ON SMALL CLEAR BEAMS OF 49 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION | |                             (Forest Service Cir. 213)                               | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |                 |   Fibre   |          |            |        Work in Bending        | |   COMMON NAME   | stress at | Modulus  |  Modulus   |-------------------------------| |   OF SPECIES    |  elastic  |    of    |     of     |    To    |    To    |         | |                 |   limit   | rupture  | elasticity | elastic  | maximum  |  Total  | |                 |           |          |            |  limit   |   load   |         | |-----------------+-----------+----------+------------+----------+----------+---------| |                 |           |          |            | In.-lbs. | In.-lbs. | In.-lb. | |                 | Lbs. per  | Lbs. per |  Lbs. per  | per cu.  | per cu.  | per     | |                 | sq. in.   | sq. in.  |  sq. in.   | inch     | inch     | inch   "]]]
