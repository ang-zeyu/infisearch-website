It is possible that the name was applied loosely to this assemblage of closely related forms that seem to cluster about C. corniferus.  A most perplexing question of relationship is presented by the forms that have been called pectinatus, scolymoides, sulcatus (calcaratus), Echinus, and the Mexican forms radians, impexicomus, corniferus.  It may be that they are all merely varieties of one strong polymorphic type, but our knowledge of corniferus is so incomplete, and material of other forms is so scanty, that I can not venture to make such an assertion. However, it seems probable that radians, pectinatus, scolymoides, sulcatus and Echinus all have green fruit, while in impexicomus and corniferus it is red.  It has also seemed proper to merge radians and pectinatus, also impexicomus and corniferus, and to refer sulcatus to scolymoides as a variety.  These seven forms are thus reduced at least to four species.  49. Cactus scolymoides sulcatus (Engelm.).    Mamillaria sulcata  Engelm. Pl. Lindh. 246 (1845), not Pfeiff.     (1848).   Mamillaria strobiliformis  Muhlenpf. Allg. Gart. Zeit. xvi. 19     (1848), not Scheer (1850).   Mamillaria calcarata  Engelm. Pl. Lindh. 195 (1850).   Cactus calcaratus  Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 259 (1891).  Differs in its smaller size; proliferous and much more cespitose habit, the dilated base of the more spreading tubercles, fewer (8 to 12) radial spines, usually a single central spine (wanting in young plants) and somewhat larger flowers.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 74. fig. 1, seeds)  Type, Lindheimer of 1844 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Texas, from the Brazos to the Nueces.  Specimens examined: Texas (Lindheimer of 1844; Fendler 34; Wright of 1850, 1854, 1857): also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1845, 1848, 1853, 1859.  This seems to represent the northeastern extension of the species, and doubtless it will be found merging into it south and west of the Nueces.  Curiously enough one of the prominent distinctions originally given was the single central spine, while in the type specimen there occur tubercles with more than one central.  50. Cactus echinus (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria echinus  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 267 (1856).  Globose or subconical, 3.5 to 6.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles terete, conical, grooved above, 10 to 12 mm. long: radial spines 16 to 30, pectinate, straight or little curved, rigid and appressed (interwoven with neighboring clusters), ashy-white (often dusky at apex), 8 to 12 mm. long, the uppermost longer (12 to 20 mm.); central spines 3 or 4, the upper ones turned upward and intermixed with the radials, the lower one very stout, 15 mm. long, subulate from a very thick bulbous base, straight (rarely slightly curved) and porrect (deciduous in old specimens): flowers 3 to 5 cm. long: fruit oval, elongated, about 2 cm. long, green: seeds elongated-obovate. brown and smooth, about 1.8 mm. long. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 10)  Type, the Wright and Bigelow specimens in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  On limestone hills, from the Pecos River, southwestern Texas, and southern New Mexico, westward to the Rio Grande (from Presidio del Norte northward).  Fl. June.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright of 1849, 1851, 1852; Bigelow of 1852; Engelmann, with no number or date; Evans of 1891).  The characteristic appearance of the plant is given by the very stout and straight central spine standing in each cluster perpendicular to the plant body.  The range of this species, between the Pecos and the upper Rio Grande, suggests another separated group, such as is presented by C. scolymoides sulcatus to the east, between the Brazos and Nueces.  Very frequently specimens of C. echinus occur in which some of the tubercles do not develop central spines, and then the spine characters resemble those of C. radians.  In C. radians, also, an occasional porrect central spine is found.  These intergrading forms I have only seen in Mexican material.  For discussion of relationships see under C. scolymoides.    ** Flowers red.    + Central spine solitary or sometimes wanting.  51. Cactus dasyacanthus  (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 259     (1891).    Mamillaria dasyacantha  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 268 (1856).  Subglobose, 3.5 to 6.5 cm. high, simple: tubercles slender and terete, spreading, lightly grooved even to the base, 8 to 10 mm, long: radial spines 30 to 50, mostly in two series, straight and loosely spreading, the exterior ones (25 to 35) capillary and white, 6 to 18 mm. long, the interior ones (7 to 13) stiffer (setaceous), longer and darker and black-tipped; the central spine straight and porrect, 12 to 20 mm. long, often wanting: flowers small, red: fruit ovate, small (8 to 10 mm. long?): seeds globose-angled, almost black, pitted, 0.8 to 1.2 mm. long  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 12. figs. 17-22)  Type, Wright 110 in Herb. Mo. Bot Gard.  From Eagle Pass, Texas, westward to El Paso and southern New Mexico, and southward into Chihuahua.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 110 of 1852): New Mexico (Vasey of 1881; Mearns of 1892, in Big Hatchet Mountains) Chihuahua (Pringle 251 of 1885, in part).  Pringle 251 as distributed to Nat. Herb. is C. tuberculosus.  52. Cactus maculatus, sp. nov.  Obovate-cylindrical, 6 by 8 cm., somewhat cespitose: tubercles ovate, terete, 10 mm. long, grooved to the base, with naked axils: radial spines 10 or 11, straight and spreading, rigid, blackish (becoming ashy with age), black-tipped, 12 mm. long; central spine large, more or less spotted, erect, 25 to 35 mm. long: flower 13 mm. long, pinkish: fruit unknown.  Type in Herb. Coulter.  San Luis Potosi.  Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi (Eschanzier of 1891).  Somewhat resembles C. tuberculosus in general appearance, but very different in spine characters.  53. Cactus brunneus, sp. nov.  Obovate-cylindrical, 3 by 6 cm., simple: tubercles ovate, grooved to the base, 5 to 6 mm. long, with woolly axils: radial spines 11 to 15, spreading, rather rigid and brownish (lighter with age), 8 to 10 mm. long; central spine much larger, 20 mm, long, hooked: flower and fruit unknown.  Type in Herb. Coulter.  San Luis Potosi.  Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi (Eschanzier of 1891).    ++ Central spines 3 to 12.  54. Cactus conoideus  (DC.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria conoidea  DC. Rev. Cact. 112 (1829).   Mamillaria strobiliformis  Engelm. Wisliz. Rep. 113 (1848), not     Scheer (1850).  Ovate-conical, 3.5 to 10 cm. high, 4 to 7 cm. in diameter below, with densely woolly vertex, simple: tubercles conical, about 12 mm, long, closely appressed-imbricate (\"giving the plant the appearance of a pineapple or cone\"): radial spines 10 to 16, ashy to white, straight and stout, 6 to 10 mm. long, the upper longer (10 to 15 mm.); central spines 3 to 5, stouter, brownish-black, 10 to 16 mm. long, the two or three smaller ones erect-spreading, the single lower one more rigid, porrect or deflexed, 15 to 20 mm. long: flowers 2 to 3 cm long and wide, deep purple: fruit unknown.

Cactus potsii  (Scheer) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 261 (1891).    Mamillaria potsii  Scheer in Salm Cact. Hort. Dyck. 104 (1850).  Cylindrical, 30 to 35 cm. high, 2.5 to 3 cm. in diameter, somewhat branching: tubercles ovate, obtuse, very lightly sulcate, with somewhat woolly axils: radial spines very numerous (entirely covering the whole plant), slender and white; central spines 6 to 12, stouter from a broad base: flowers large, green, or reddish: fruit red.  Type unknown.  From the Rio Grande region, near Laredo, Texas, to Chihuahua.  Specimens examined: Texas (Poselger of 1851): Chihuahua (specimens from Coll. Salm-Dyck.).  56. Cactus tuberculosus  (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 261 (1891).    Mamillaria strobiliformis  Scheer in Salm Cact. Hort. Dyck. 104     (1850), not Muhlenpf. (1848), nor Engelm. (1848).   Mamillaria tuberculosa  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 268 (1856).  Ovate to cylindrical, 5 to 15 cm. high, 2.5 to 5 cm. in diameter, simple or branching at base: tubercles short-ovate from a broad base, 5 to 6 mm. long, deeply grooved, crowded and imbricate, at length covering the older parts as naked and gray corky protuberances: radial spines 20 to 30, slender but stiff, white, radiant and interwoven with adjacent clusters, 4 to 8 mm. long (uppermost rarely 10 to 12 mm.); central spines 5 to 9, stouter, purplish above, the upper ones longer, erect, 10 to 14 mm. long (sometimes even 16 to 18 mm.), the lower one shorter (6 to 8 mm.), stout, porrect or deflexed: flowers about 2.5 cm. in diameter, pale purple: fruit oval, elongated (sometimes almost cylindric), red, about 18 mm. long: seeds subglobose, brown and pitted, very small (0.8 to 1.2 mm. long).  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 12. figs. 1-16)  Type of Scheer's strobiliformis is unknown; but the specimens of Prince Salm-Dyck in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard. are marked \"authentic\" by Dr. Engelmann.  The Wright specimens in the same Herb, represent the type of M tuberculosa Engelm.  From the mountains of extreme southwestern Texas (common west of Devil's River), southward into Chihuahua and Coahuila.  Fl. May-June.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 29, 30,31,32, 535, of 1849 and 1852; Bigelow of 1852; Engelmann, with no number or date; Evans of 1891): Chihuahua (Pringle 250, 251 in part, and 258 of 1885): Coahuila (Palmer of 1880): also specimens from Coll. Salm. Dyck in 1857; also growing in Mo Bot. Gard. 1893 (specimens, sent by G. G. Briggs in 1892 from El Paso, Texas.  The identification of Engelmann's tuberculosa with Scheer's strobiliformis was made by Dr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1221"],["title","A Preliminary Revision of the North American Species of Cactus, Anhalonium, and (#8)"],["body","himself upon an examination of Scheer's type.  The use of the specific name tuberculosa is necessitated by the law of homonyms, as strobiliformis had been used twice already before it was taken up by Scheer.  M. strobiliformis Muhlenpf. is C. scolymoides sulcatus; and M. strobiliformis Engelm. is C. conoideus.  57. Cactus viviparus  Nutt. in Fraser's Cat. (1813).    Mamillaria vivipara  Haw. Syn. Succ. Suppl. 72 (1819).  Low and depressed-globose, usually proliferous and cespitose (forming large masses), but sometimes simple: tubercles terete and loose, lightly grooved: radial spines 12 to 20, stiff and white, often dark-tipped, 6 to 8 mm. long; central spines usually 4 (sometimes less, often more, even as many as 8), brownish, 8 to 12 mm. long, 3 spreading upwards, the lowest stouter and shorter and deflexed: flowers about 3.5 cm. long (large for the size of the plant) and even broader when expanded, bright purple: stigmas pointed with a short mucro: fruit oval, pale green, juicy, 12 to 18 mm. long: seeds yellowish-brown, obliquely obovate and curved about the small hilum, 1.4 to 1.6 mm. long).  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 74. fig. 3, seeds)  Type unknown.  On the northwestern plains, from the boundary provinces of British America (western Manitoba, Assiniboia and Alberta), and throughout the Upper Missouri region, southward through western Nebraska to western Kansas and to the eastern foothills of central Colorado.  It is also mentioned by Howell (Cat. of Oregon, Washington and Idaho plants), as occurring beyond the Rocky Mountain divide in Idaho and Washington, which is probable, but no specimens have been seen.  Specimens examined: Montana (Hayden, nos. 1854, 1855; Vernon Bailey of 1890, near Bridger): Colorado (Hayden of 1869): Nebraska (Rydberg 1379 of 1893, Thomas Co.): also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1869; also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  It seems best to keep this northwestern form specifically separate from that large assemblage of southern forms that have been commonly referred to it.  The forms referred to this species from western Kansas (Smyth's check list) have not been examined, and they may represent intermediate forms, inclining to simple habit and ovate form, as in the Colorado forms.  The southern type (C. radiosus) is distinguished from C. viviparus not only by its very different range, but also by its ovate to cylindrical form, simple habit, more numerous (12 to 40) and longer (6 to 22 mm.) radial spines, usually more numerous (3 to 14) central spines in which the upper are more robust than the lower, porrect lower central, obtuse stigmas, and brown obovate straight seeds.  58. Cactus radiosus (Engelm.).    Mamillaria vivipara  Engelm. Pl. Fendl. 49 (1849), not Haw.     (1819).   Mamillaria radiosa  Engelm. Pl. Lindh. 196 (1850).   Mamillaria vivipara radiosa texana  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 269     (1856).  Ovate or cylindrical, 5 to 12.5 cm. high and about 5 cm. in diameter, simple or sparingly proliferous: tubercles terete, more or less grooved above, 8 to 12 mm. long: radial spines 20 to 30, straight, slender, with with dusky apex, very unequal, 6 to 8 mm long; central spines 4 or 5, stouter, yellowish or tawny, 8 to 12 mm. long, the upper ones the longer and more robust, the lowest one shorter and porrect: flowers 3.5 to 5.5 cm. long, about the same diameter when fully open, violet to dark purple: stigmas 7 to 9, obtuse: fruit oval and green: seeds yellowish or brown, obovate, pitted, fully 2 mm, long.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 74, fig.5, seeds)  Type, Lindheimer of 1846 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Extending across southern Texas, from the Guadalupe to El Paso. thence into contiguous New Mexico and across the Rio Grande near Juarez (northern Chihuahua).  Fl. May-June.  Specimens examined: Texas (Lindheimer of 1846): New Mexico (Bigelow of 1855): Chihuahua, near Juarez (Evans of 1891): also specimens cultivated from the type in St. Louis in 1846.  Attention has been called under C. viviparus to the characters that distinguish from C. radiosus  The characters there given for the latter species apply to to the whole group of included forms. The type of the species is the var. Texana of Engelmann's Syn. Cact. and Mex. Bound., which is characterized in the above. description.  59. Cactus radiosus neo-mexicanus  (Engelm.).    Mamillaria vivipara radiosa neo-mexicana  Engelm. Syn. Cact.     269 (1856).  Generally lower (3.5 to 10 cm.) and subglobose to ovate or even sub-cylindrical, branching at base or simple, with more numerous (12 to 40) radial spines, more numerous (3 to 12) and purplish centrals, and smaller seeds.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 74. fig. 4, seeds)  Type, presumably the Wright, Bigelow, and Schott specimens from western Texas, New Mexico, and Sonora, all in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From southern Utah, central Colorado, and western Kansas, southward through western Texas, New Mexico and Arizona into Chihuahua and Sonora.  Specimens examined: Kansas (Carleton 530 of 1891, in Meade County): Oklahoma (Carleton 233 of 1891): Colorado (Hall and Harbour of 1862; Brandegee 645 of 1873; Hicks of 1890): Utah (Siler of 1870): New Mexico (Wislizenus of 1846; Fendler 244, 271, of 1847: Wright 298; Bigelow of 1853; G. R. Vasey of 1881): Texas (Wright of 1849, 1851, 1852; Bigelow of 1853): Arizona (Rothrock, with no number or date): Sonora (Schott of 1855): Chihuahua (Evans of 1891, near Juarez).  It is through this variety that C. radiosus approaches most nearly to C. viviparus, in the forms with few radials and centrals, but the specific characters seem to hold.  This is the Mamillaria vivipara of the Syn Fl. Colorado (Porter and Coulter).  60. Cactus radiosus arizonicus  (Engelm.).    Mamillaria arizonica  Engelm Bot. Calif. i. 244 (1876).  A robust globose or ovate simple form (7.5 to 10 cm. in diameter), with long (12 to 25 mm.) deeply-grooved tubercles, 15 to 20 long (10 to 30 mm.) rigid whitish radial spines, and 3 to 6 centrals deep brown above.  Type, the specimens of Cous, Palmer, Bischoff and Johnson, all in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Sandy and rocky soil from southern Utah through northern and western Arizona to southern California.  Specimens examined: Arizona (Cous of 1865; Cous & Palmer of 1865 and 1872; Palmer of 1869; Bischoff of 1871; Miller of 1881; Rusby 617 of 1853; Pringle of 1884): Utah (Johnson of 1871, 1872, 1874; Parry of 1875, 1877): California (Parish of 1880): also specimens cultivated in Mo. Bot. Gard. in 1881; and in Meehan's Gard. in 1882.  61. Cactus radiosus deserti  (Engelm.).    Mamillaria deserti  Engelm. Bot. Calif. ii. 449 (1880).  Subglobose or oval (5 to 10 cm. high) and simple, with deeply grooved tubercles (slender and about 12 mm. long), 25 to 30 rather long (10 to 16 mm.) grayish white radial spines (the larger with reddish tips), 3 or 4 shorter and stouter centrals with 5 or 6 intermediate ones above, small (2.5 cm. long) straw-colored flowers (becoming purplish-tipped), 5 or 6 stigmas, and obliquely obovate curved seeds.  Type, Parish 433 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  In the mountains bordering the deserts of southeastern California (San Bernardino County) and extending to central Nevada (Reese River Valley).  Specimens examined: California (Parish 453 of 1880, also of 1882; Bailey of 1890): Nevada, Lincoln County (Coville & Funston of 1891, Death Valley Expedition): also specimens cultivated in Meehan's Gard. in 1882.  The smaller straw-colored flowers alone suggest the propriety of keeping this form specifically distinct, but even in size and color there is an occasional tendency toward the specific character.  The obliquely obovate curved seeds resemble those of C. viviparus.  The plant densely covered with stout ashy-gray interlocking spines is easily recognized.  62. Cactus radiosus chloranthus  (Engelm.).    Mamillaria chlorantha  Engelm. Wheeler's Rep. 127 (1878).  Oval to cylindrical (7.5 cm. in diameter, sometimes 20 to 22.5 cm. high), with 20 to 25 gray radial spines almost in two series, 6 to 9 stouter reddish or brownish-tipped centrals (12 to 25 mm. long), and yellowish or greenish-yellow flowers 3.5 cm. long and wide.  Type: Southern Utah specimens of both Parry and Johnson occur in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard., but they are all referred to C. radiosus arizonicus, and I can find no trace of any specimens of C. radiosus chloranthus in the Engelmann collection.  Southern Utah, east of St. George (Parry; Johnson).  The plant is evidently near C. radiosus deserti, of which variety it seems to be the Utah representative, but in the absence not only of the type, but even of authentic specimens, the two are kept separate, a thing fully justified by the description.  63. Cactus radiosus alversoni, var. nov.  Differs from var. deserti in its more robust and branching habit (becoming 12.5 cm. tall and 10 cm. in diameter), shorter and thicker tubercles, more numerous (12 to 14 centrals) stouter and longer (12 to 22 mm.) spines, all of which are black-tipped (the centrals black half way down, shading into red), and pink flowers.  Type, Alverson's specimens in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard. and in Herb. Coulter.  In the desert region of extreme southeastern California.  Specimens examined: Southern California (A. H. Alverson of 1892): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  The covering of stout bushy interlocking spines is like that of var. deserti, but the black and reddish coloration gives a decidedly different appearance.  On account of this appearance of a reddish-black brush the plant has been popularly called \"foxtail cactus.\"  The decidedly pink flowers were sent by Mr. S. B. Parish from specimens growing in cultivation in San Diego, and are not from the original collection of Mr. Alverson.  64. Cactus macromeris  (Engelm.) Kuntze Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).
