Get to a flank,\" some one said.  AN ARMY IN MOTION  We were no more than well clear of that immobile host when it all surged forward, headed by massed bands playing a tune that sounded like the very pulse of France.  The two Generals, with their Staff, and the French Minister for War, were on foot near a patch of very green lucerne. They made about twenty figures in all.  The cars were little grey blocks against the grey skyline.  There was nothing else in all that great plain except the army; no sound but the changing notes of the aeroplanes and the blunted impression, rather than noise, of feet of men on soft ground.  They came over a slight ridge, so that one saw the curve of it first furred, then grassed, with the tips of bayonets, which immediately grew to full height, and then, beneath them, poured the wonderful infantry.  The speed, the thrust, the drive of that broad blue mass was like a tide-race up an arm of the sea; and how such speed could go with such weight, and how such weight could be in itself so absolutely under control, filled one with terror.  All the while, the band, on a far headland, was telling them and telling them (as if they did not know!) of the passion and gaiety and high heart of their own land in the speech that only they could fully understand.  (To hear the music of a country is like hearing a woman think aloud.)  \"What _is_ the tune?\" I asked of an officer beside me.  \"My faith, I can't recall for the moment.  I've marched to it often enough, though.  'Sambre-et-Meuse,' perhaps.  Look! There goes my battalion!  Those Chasseurs yonder.\"  _He_ knew, of course; but what could a stranger identify in that earth-shaking passage of thirty thousand?  ARTILLERY AND CAVALRY  The note behind the ridge changed to something deeper.  \"Ah!  Our guns,\" said an artillery officer, and smiled tolerantly on the last blue waves of the Line already beating toward the horizon.  They came twelve abreast--one hundred and fifty guns free for the moment to take the air in company, behind their teams. And next week would see them, hidden singly or in lurking confederacies, by mountain and marsh and forest, or the wrecked habitations of men--where?  The big guns followed them, with that long-nosed air of detachment peculiar to the breed.  The Gunner at my side made no comment.  He was content to let his Arm speak for itself, but when one big gun in a sticky place fell out of alignment for an instant I saw his eyebrows contract.  The artillery passed on with the same inhuman speed and silence as the Line; and the Cavalry's shattering trumpets closed it all.  They are like our Cavalry in that their horses are in high condition, and they talk hopefully of getting past the barbed wire one of these days and coming into their own.  Meantime, they are employed on \"various work as requisite,\" and they all sympathize with our rough-rider of Dragoons who flatly refused to take off his spurs in the trenches.  If he had to die as a damned infantryman, he wasn't going to be buried as such.  A troop-horse of a flanking squadron decided that he had had enough of war, and jibbed like Lot's wife.  His rider (we all watched him) ranged about till he found a stick, which he used, but without effect.  Then he got off and led the horse, which was evidently what the brute wanted, for when the man remounted the jibbing began again.  The last we saw of him was one immensely lonely figure leading one bad but happy horse across an absolutely empty world.  Think of his reception--the sole man of 40,000 who had fallen out!  THE BOCHE AS MR. SMITH  The Commander of that Army Corps came up to salute.  The cars went away with the Generals and the Minister for War; the Army passed out of sight over the ridges to the north; the peasant women stooped again to their work in the fields, and wet mist shut down on all the plain; but one tingled with the electricity that had passed.  Now one knows what the solidarity of civilization means.  Later on the civilized nations will know more, and will wonder and laugh together at their old blindness.  When Lord Kitchener went down the line, before the march past, they say that he stopped to speak to a General who had been Marchand's Chief of Staff at the time of Fashoda.  And Fashoda was one of several cases when civilization was very nearly maneuvered into fighting with itself \"for the King of Prussia,\" as the saying goes.  The all-embracing vileness of the Boche is best realized from French soil, where they have had large experience of it.  \"And yet,\" as some one observed, \"we ought to have known that a race who have brought anonymous letter-writing to its highest pitch in their own dirty Court affairs would certainly use the same methods in their foreign politics.  _Why_ didn't we realize?\"  \"For the same reason,\" another responded, \"that society did not realize that the late Mr. Smith, of your England, who married three wives, bought baths in advance for each of them, and, when they had left him all their money, drowned them one by one.\"  \"And were the baths by any chance called Denmark, Austria, and France in 1870?\" a third asked.  \"No, they were respectable British tubs.  But until Mr. Smith had drowned his third wife people didn't get suspicious.  They argued that 'men don't do such things.'  That sentiment is the criminal's best protection.\"     IV  THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE   We passed into the zone of another army and a hillier country, where the border villages lay more sheltered.  Here and there a town and the fields round it gave us a glimpse of the furious industry with which France makes and handles material and troops.  With her, as with us, the wounded officer of experience goes back to the drill-ground to train the new levies.  But it was always the little crowded, defiant villages, and the civil population waiting unweariedly and cheerfully on the unwearied, cheerful army, that went closest to the heart.  Take these pictures, caught almost anywhere during a journey:  A knot of little children in difficulties with the village water-tap or high-handled pump.  A soldier, bearded and fatherly, or young and slim and therefore rather shy of the big girls' chaff, comes forward and lifts the pail or swings the handle.  His reward, from the smallest babe swung high in air, or, if he is an older man, pressed against his knees, is a kiss.  Then nobody laughs.  Or a fat old lady making oration against some wicked young soldiers who, she says, know what has happened to a certain bottle of wine.  \"And I meant it for all--yes, for all of you --this evening, instead of the thieves who stole it.  Yes, I tell you--stole it!\"  The whole street hears her; so does the officer, who pretends not to, and the amused half-battalion up the road.  The young men express penitence; she growls like a thunderstorm, but, softening at last, cuffs and drives them affectionately before her.  They are all one family.  Or a girl at work with horses in a ploughed field that is dotted with graves.  The machine must avoid each sacred plot. So, hands on the plough-stilts, her hair flying forward, she shouts and wrenches till her little brother runs up and swings the team out of the furrow.  Every aspect and detail of life in France seems overlaid with a smooth patina of long-continued war--everything except the spirit of the people, and that is as fresh and glorious as the sight of their own land in sunshine.  A CITY AND WOMAN  We found a city among hills which knew itself to be a prize greatly coveted by the Kaiser.  For, truly, it was a pleasant, a desirable, and an insolent city.  Its streets were full of life; it boasted an establishment almost as big as Harrod's and full of buyers, and its women dressed and shod themselves with care and grace, as befits ladies who, at any time, may be ripped into rags by bombs from aeroplanes.  And there was another city whose population seemed to be all soldiers in training; and yet another given up to big guns and ammunition --an extraordinary sight.  After that, we came to a little town of pale stone which an Army had made its headquarters.  It looked like a plain woman who had fainted in public.  It had rejoiced in many public institutions that were turned into hospitals and offices; the wounded limped its wide, dusty streets, detachments of Infantry went through it swiftly; and utterly bored motor-lorries cruised up and down roaring, I suppose, for something to look at or to talk to.  In the centre of it I found one Janny, or rather his marble bust, brooding over a minute iron-railed garden of half-dried asters opposite a shut-up school, which it appeared from the inscription Janny had founded somewhere in the arid Thirties.  It was precisely the sort of school that Janny, by the look of him, would have invented. Not even French adaptability could make anything of it.  So Janny had his school, with a faint perfume of varnish, all to himself in a hot stillness of used-up air and little whirls of dust. And because that town seemed so barren, I met there a French General whom I would have gone very far to have encountered. He, like the others, had created and tempered an army for certain work in a certain place, and its hand had been heavy on the Boche.  We talked of what the French woman was, and had done, and was doing, and extolled her for her goodness and her faith and her splendid courage.  When we parted, I went back and made my profoundest apologies to Janny, who must have had a mother.  The pale, overwhelmed town did not now any longer resemble a woman who had fainted, but one who must endure in public all manner of private woe and still, with hands that never cease working, keeps her soul and is cleanly strong for herself and for her men.  FRENCH OFFICERS  The guns began to speak again among the hills that we dived into; the air grew chillier as we climbed; forest and wet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12454"],["title","France at War: On the Frontier of Civilization (#5)"],["body","closed round us in the mist, to the sound of waters trickling alongside; there was a tang of wet fern, cut pine, and the first breath of autumn when the road entered a tunnel and a new world--Alsace.  Said the Governor of those parts thoughtfully:  \"The main thing was to get those factory chimneys smoking again.\"  (They were doing so in little flats and villages all along.)  \"You won't see any girls, because they're at work in the textile factories.  Yes, it isn't a bad country for summer hotels, but I'm afraid it won't do for winter sports.  We've only a metre of snow, and it doesn't lie, except when you are hauling guns up mountains.  Then, of course, it drifts and freezes like Davos.  That's our new railway below there.  Pity it's too misty to see the view.\"  But for his medals, there was nothing in the Governor to show that he was not English.  He might have come straight from an Indian frontier command.  One notices this approximation of type in the higher ranks, and many of the juniors are cut out of the very same cloth as ours.  They get whatever fun may be going:  their performances are as incredible and outrageous as the language in which they describe them afterward is bald, but convincing, and--I overheard the tail-end of a yarn told by a child of twenty to some other babes.  It was veiled in the obscurity of the French tongue, and the points were lost in shouts of laughter --but I imagine the subaltern among his equals displays just as much reverence for his elders and betters as our own boys do. The epilogue, at least, was as old as both Armies:  \"And what did he say then?\"  \"Oh, the usual thing.  He held his breath till I thought he'd burst.  Then he damned me in heaps, and I took good care to keep out of his sight till next day.\"  But officially and in the high social atmosphere of Headquarters their manners and their meekness are of the most admirable.  There they attend devoutly on the wisdom of their seniors, who treat them, so it seemed, with affectionate confidence.  FRONT THAT NEVER SLEEPS  When the day's reports are in, all along the front, there is a man, expert in the meaning of things, who boils them down for that cold official digest which tells us that \"There was the usual grenade fighting at------.  We made appreciable advance at------,\" &c.  The original material comes in sheaves and sheaves, where individual character and temperament have full and amusing play.  It is reduced for domestic consumption like an overwhelming electric current.  Otherwise we could not take it in.  But at closer range one realizes that the Front never sleeps; never ceases from trying new ideas and weapons which, so soon as the Boche thinks he has mastered them, are discarded for newer annoyances and bewilderments.  \"The Boche is above all things observant and imitative,\" said one who counted quite a few Boches dead on the front of his sector.  \"When you present him with a new idea, he thinks it over for a day or two.  Then he presents his riposte.\"  \"Yes, my General.  That was exactly what he did to me when I --did so and so.  He was quite silent for a day.  Then--he stole my patent.\"  \"And you?\"  \"I had a notion that he'd do that, so I had changed the specification.\"  Thus spoke the Staff, and so it is among the junior commands, down to the semi-isolated posts where boy-Napoleons live on their own, through unbelievable adventures.  They are inventive young devils, these veterans of 21, possessed of the single ideal--to kill--which they follow with men as single-minded as themselves.  Battlefield tactics do not exist; when a whole nation goes to ground there can be none of the \"victories\" of the old bookish days.  But there is always the killing--the well-schemed smashing of a full trench, the rushing out and the mowing down of its occupants; the unsuspicious battalion far in the rear, located after two nights' extreme risk alone among rubbish of masonry, and wiped out as it eats or washes itself; and, more rarely, the body to body encounter with animals removed from the protection of their machinery, when the bayonets get their chance.  The Boche does not at all like meeting men whose womenfolk he has dishonoured or mutilated, or used as a protection against bullets.  It is not that these men are angry or violent.  They do not waste time in that way.  They kill him.  THE BUSINESS OF WAR  The French are less reticent than we about atrocities committed by the Boche, because those atrocities form part of their lives.  They are not tucked away in reports of Commissions, and vaguely referred to as \"too awful.\"  Later on, perhaps, we shall be unreserved in our turn.  But they do not talk of them with any babbling heat or bleat or make funny little appeals to a \"public opinion\" that, like the Boche, has gone underground.  It occurs to me that this must be because every Frenchman has his place and his chance, direct or indirect, to diminish the number of Boches still alive. Whether he lies out in a sandwich of damp earth, or sweats the big guns up the crests behind the trees, or brings the fat, loaded barges into the very heart of the city, where the shell-wagons wait, or spends his last crippled years at the harvest, he is doing his work to that end.  If he is a civilian he may--as he does--say things about his Government, which, after all, is very like other popular governments.  (A lifetime spent in watching how the cat jumps does not make lion-tamers.)  But there is very little human rubbish knocking about France to hinder work or darken counsel.  Above all, there is a thing called the Honour of Civilization, to which France is attached.  The meanest man feels that he, in his place, is permitted to help uphold it, and, I think, bears himself, therefore, with new dignity.  A CONTRAST IN TYPES  This is written in a garden of smooth turf, under a copper beech, beside a glassy mill-stream, where soldiers of Alpine regiments are writing letters home, while the guns shout up and down the narrow valleys.  A great wolf-hound, who considers himself in charge of the old-fashioned farmhouse, cannot understand why his master, aged six, should be sitting on the knees of the Marechal des Logis, the iron man who drives the big car.  \"But you _are_ French, little one?\" says the giant, with a yearning arm round the child.  \"Yes,\" very slowly mouthing the French words; \"I--can't --speak--French--but--I--am--French.\"  The small face disappears in the big beard.  Somehow, I can't imagine the Marechal des Logis killing babies--even if his superior officer, now sketching the scene, were to order him!  .    .    .    .    .    .    .  The great building must once have been a monastery.  Twilight softened its gaunt wings, in an angle of which were collected fifty prisoners, picked up among the hills behind the mists.  They stood in some sort of military formation preparatory to being marched off.  They were dressed in khaki, the colour of gassed grass, that might have belonged to any army.  Two wore spectacles, and I counted eight faces of the fifty which were asymmetrical--out of drawing on one side.  \"Some of their later drafts give us that type,\" said the Interpreter.  One of them had been wounded in the head and roughly bandaged.  The others seemed all sound.  Most of them looked at nothing, but several were vividly alive with terror that cannot keep the eyelids still, and a few wavered on the grey edge of collapse.  They were the breed which, at the word of command, had stolen out to drown women and children; had raped women in the streets at the word of command; and, always at the word of command, had sprayed petrol, or squirted flame; or defiled the property and persons of their captives.  They stood there outside all humanity.  Yet they were made in the likeness of humanity.  One realized it with a shock when the bandaged creature began to shiver, and they shuffled off in response to the orders of civilized men.     V  LIFE IN TRENCHES ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE   Very early in the morning I met Alan Breck, with a half-healed bullet-scrape across the bridge of his nose, and an Alpine cap over one ear.  His people a few hundred years ago had been Scotch.  He bore a Scotch name, and still recognized the head of his clan, but his French occasionally ran into German words, for he was an Alsatian on one side.  \"This,\" he explained, \"is the very best country in the world to fight in.  It's picturesque and full of cover.  I'm a gunner.  I've been here for months.  It's lovely.\"  It might have been the hills under Mussoorie, and what our cars expected to do in it I could not understand.  But the demon-driver who had been a road-racer took the 70 h.p. Mercedes and threaded the narrow valleys, as well as occasional half-Swiss villages full of Alpine troops, at a restrained thirty miles an hour.  He shot up a new-made road, more like Mussoorie than ever, and did not fall down the hillside even once.  An ammunition-mule of a mountain-battery met him at a tight corner, and began to climb a tree.  \"See!  There isn't another place in France where that could happen,\" said Alan.  \"I tell you, this is a magnificent country.\"  The mule was hauled down by his tail before he had reached the lower branches, and went on through the woods, his ammunition-boxes jinking on his back, for all the world as though he were rejoining his battery at Jutogh.  One expected to meet the little Hill people bent under their loads under the forest gloom.  The light, the colour, the smell of wood smoke, pine-needles, wet earth, and warm mule were all Himalayan.  Only the Mercedes was violently and loudly a stranger.  \"Halt!\" said Alan at last, when she had done everything except imitate the mule.  \"The road continues,\" said the demon-driver seductively.  \"Yes, but they will hear you if you go on.  Stop and wait. We've a mountain battery to look at.\"  They were not at work for the moment, and the Commandant, a grim and forceful man, showed me some details of their"]]]
