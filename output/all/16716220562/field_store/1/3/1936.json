A small company will do, Luck. That's one point that struck me. Two or three die, on an average, in the first four hundred feet of every story; so you can double a lot. I've had Clements go over them and start the carpenters on the street set where most of the exterior action takes place; we're behind on releases, you know, and these ought to be rushed. You'd better go over and see how he's making out; you may want to make some changes.\"  Luck hesitated so long that Martinson was on the edge of withdrawing the proffered scripts. But he took them finally, and ran his eye disparagingly over the titles. \"Bently Brown!\" he said, as though he were naming something disagreeable. \"I'm to film Bently Brown's blood-and-battle stuff, am I?\" He grinned, with the corners of his mouth tipped downward so that you never would have suspected it of ever producing Luck's famous smile. \"I might turn them into comedy,\" he suggested. \"I expect I could get a punch by burlesquing--\"  \"Punch!\" Martinson pushed his chair back impetuously. \"Punch? Why, my godfrey, man, that stuff's all punch!\"  Luck curved a palm over his too-expressive mouth while he skimmed the central idea from two or three synopses. Martinson watched him uneasily. Martinson claimed to keep one finger pressed firmly upon the public pulse--wherever that may be found--and to be ever alert for its warning flutterings. Martinson claimed to know a great deal about what the public liked in the way of moving pictures. He believed in Luck's knowledge of the West, but he did not believe that the public would stand for the real West at all; the public, he maintained, wanted its West served hot and strong and reeking with the smoke of black powder. So--  \"Well, the market demands that sort of thing,\" he declared, arguing against that curved palm and the telltale wrinkles around Luck's eyes. \"It's all tommyrot, of course. I don't say it's good; I say it's the stuff that goes. We're here to make what the public will pay to look at.\" Martinson, besides keeping his finger on the public pulse and attending to the marketing of the Acme wares and watching that expenses did not run too high, found a little time in which to be human. \"I know, Luck,\" the human side of him observed sympathetically; \"it's just made-to-order melodrama, but business is simply rotten, old man. We've just got to release films the market calls for. There's no art-for-art's-sake in the movie business, and you know it. Now, personally, I like that scenario of yours--\"  \"Forget it!\" said Luck crisply, warning him off the subject. To make the warning keener-edged, he lifted the typed sheets over which he had worked so late the night before, glanced at the top one, gave a snort, and tore them twice down the length of them with vicious twists of his fingers. He did not mean to be spectacular; he simply felt that way at that particular moment, and he indulged the impulse to destroy something. He dropped the fragments into Martinson's waste basket, picked up the bundle of scripts and his hat, and went out with his mouth pulled down at the corners and with his neck pretty stiff.  He went swinging across the studio yard and on past the great stage where the carpenters halted their work while they greeted him, and looked after him and spoke of him when he had passed. Early idlers--extras with high hopes and empty pockets--sent him wistful glances which he did not see at all; though he did see Andy Green and his wife (who had been Rosemary Allen). These two stood hesitating just within the half-open, high board gate fifty yards away. Luck waved his hand and swerved toward them.  \"Howdy! Where's the rest of the bunch?\" he called out as they hurried up to him. Whereupon the group of extras were sharp bitten by the envy of these two strangers, spoken to so familiarly by Luck Lindsay.  \"Do you know, I feel sure the boys are being held in the lost-child place at the police station!\" Rosemary Green, twinkled her brown eyes at him from between strands of crinkly brown hair. \"I had tags all fixed, with name, age, owner's address and all that, and I was going to hang them around the boys' necks with pale blue ribbon--pale blue would be so becoming! But do you know, I couldn't find them! I feel worried. I should hate to waste thirty-nine cents worth of pale blue ribbon. I can't wear it myself; it makes me look positively swarthy.\" Rosemary Green had a most captivating way of saying swarthy.  The corners of Luck's mouth came up instantly. \"We'll have to send out scouting parties. I need that bunch of desperadoes. Let's look over by the corrals. I've got to go over and see what kind of a street set they're knocking together, anyway.  \"Hello! I have sure-enough crying need for all you strays,\" he exclaimed five minutes later, when they came upon the Flying TJ boys standing disconsolately at the head of the street \"set\" upon which carpenters were hammering and sawing and painters were daubing. Luck's eyes chilled as he took in the stereotyped \"Western\" crudeness of the set.  \"Well, we sure need you--and need you bad,\" Pink retorted. \"We want to know what town was peeled so they could set the rind up like that and call it a street? Between you and me, Luck, it don't look good to me, back or front. You walk into what claims to be a saloon, and come out on a view of the hills. They tell me the bar of that imitation saloon is away over there on that platform, and they say the bottles are all full of tea. That right?\"  Luck nodded gloomily. \"Soon as they get the set up, it's going to be your privilege to come boiling out of that saloon, shooting two guns, Pink,\" he prophesied. \"You'll have the fun of killing half a dozen boys that come down from this end shooting as they ride.\" He put his cigarette between his lips and began to untie the dingy blue tape that bound the scenarios together.  \"Ever read any of Bently Brown's stories? They wished a bunch of them on to me while I was gone and couldn't defend myself,\" he said, as one who breaks bad news. \"I'm certainly sorry about this, boys. It's a long way from what I brought you out here to do; and if you want to, you can call the deal off and go home. Rip-snorting, rotten melodrama--cheap as ice in Alaska. Stuff I hate--because it's the stuff that cheapens the West in pictures.\"  \"What about our range picture?\" Andy Green began anxiously.  Luck choked back an oath because of Andy's wife. \"Ah--they're married to the idea that this rot is what sells best. They don't know what a _real_ Western picture is: they never saw one. And they're afraid to take a chance. I was in hopes--but Mart's the big chief, you know. He'd gone and loaded up with this trash, and so he couldn't see my story at all. I get his viewpoint, all right; he's keen to pry off some real money, and he's afraid to experiment with new tools. But it does seem pretty raw to put you boys working on this cheap studio stuff after getting you out here to do something worth while.\"  \"We're to stay right here, then?\" Weary spoke the question that was in the minds of all of them.  \"That's the present outlook,\" Luck confessed with bitterness. \"I don't need real country for this junk. I was all primed to show him where I'd have to take my company to New Mexico, but I didn't say anything about it when he sprung this Bently Brown business. This will all be made right here at the studio and out in Griffith Park.\"  Down deep in Luck's heart there was a hurt he would not reveal to any one. It was built partly of disappointment and an honest dislike for doing unworthy work; it had in it also some personal chagrin at being compelled to put the Happy Family at work in the very class of pictures he had often ridiculed in his talk with them, after bringing them all the way from Montana so that he might produce his big range picture. He stood looking somberly at the set which Clements had planned to save time--and therefore dollars--for the Acme Company. He thought of his range story, as it had first grown out of the night away up there in the plains country; he thought of how he had hurried so that he might the sooner make the vision a reality; how he had talked of it confidently to these men who had listened with growing enthusiasm and interest, until his vision had become their vision, his hopes their hopes.  They had left the Flying U and come with him to help make that big picture of the range. By their eager talk they had helped him to strengthen certain scenes; they had even suggested new, original material as they told of this adventure and that accident, and argued--as was their habit--ever scenes and situations. That was why Andy had spoken of it as _their_ picture. That was why they were here; that was what had brought them early to the studio. And in his hand he held a half dozen or more of those cheap, lurid stories he had always despised; they must let the public see their faces in these impossible, illogical situations, or they must go back and call Luck Lindsay names to salve their disappointment.  The dried little man--whose name was Dave Wiswell--came walking curiously up the fresh-made \"street,\" his sharp eyes taking in the falsity of the whole row of shack-houses that had no backs; bald behind as board fences, save where two-by-fours braced them from falling. He saw the group standing before a wall that purported to be the front of a bank (which would be robbed with much bloodshed in the second scenario) and he hurried a little. Luck scowled at him preoccupiedly, nodded a good morning, and turned abruptly to the others.  \"Listen. If you boys are game for this melodrama, I'd like to use you, all right. You'll get experience in the business, anyway, so maybe it won't do you any harm. And if the weather holds good, we'll just make a long hard drive of this bunch of drivel; we'll rush 'em"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12664"],["title","Lyrics of Earth (#0)"],["body","you to Canadian Poetry [http://www.canadianpoetry.ca] for providing the source text.

THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE       It fell on a day I was happy,       And the winds, the concave sky,     The flowers and the beasts in the meadow       Seemed happy even as I;     And I stretched my hands to the meadow,       To the bird, the beast, the tree:     \"Why are ye all so happy?\"       I cried, and they answered me.      What sayest thou, Oh meadow,       That stretches so wide, so far,     That none can say how many       Thy misty marguerites are?     And what say ye, red roses,       That o'er the sun-blanched wall     From your high black-shadowed trellis       Like flame or blood-drops fall?         \"We are born, we are reared, and we linger           A various space and die;         We dream, and are bright and happy,           But we cannot answer why.\"      What sayest thou, Oh shadow,       That from the dreaming hill     All down the broadening valley       Liest so sharp and still?     And thou, Oh murmuring brooklet,       Whereby in the noonday gleam     The loosestrife burns like ruby,       And the branchèd asters dream?         \"We are born, we are reared, and we linger           A various space and die;         We dream and are very happy,           But we cannot answer why.\"      And then of myself I questioned,       That like a ghost the while     Stood from me and calmly answered,       With slow and curious smile:     \"Thou art born as the flowers, and wilt linger       Thine own short space and die;     Thou dream'st and art strangely happy,       But thou canst not answer why.\"     GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW       March is slain; the keen winds fly;     Nothing more is thine to do;     April kisses thee good-bye;     Thou must haste and follow too;     Silent friend that guarded well     Withered things to make us glad,     Shyest friend that could not tell     Half the kindly thought he had.     Haste thee, speed thee, O kind snow;     Down the dripping valleys go,     From the fields and gleaming meadows,     Where the slaying hours behold thee,     From the forests whose slim shadows,     Brown and leafless cannot fold thee,     Through the cedar lands aflame     With gold light that cleaves and quivers,     Songs that winter may not tame,     Drone of pines and laugh of rivers.     May thy passing joyous be     To thy father, the great sea,     For the sun is getting stronger;     Earth hath need of thee no longer;     Go, kind snow, God-speed to thee!     APRIL IN THE HILLS       To-day the world is wide and fair     With sunny fields of lucid air,     And waters dancing everywhere;       The snow is almost gone;     The noon is builded high with light,     And over heaven's liquid height,     In steady fleets serene and white,       The happy clouds go on.      The channels run, the bare earth steams,     And every hollow rings and gleams     With jetting falls and dashing streams;       The rivers burst and fill;     The fields are full of little lakes,     And when the romping wind awakes     The water ruffles blue and shakes,       And the pines roar on the hill.      The crows go by, a noisy throng;     About the meadows all day long     The shore-lark drops his brittle song;       And up the leafless tree     The nut-hatch runs, and nods, and clings;     The bluebird dips with flashing wings,     The robin flutes, the sparrow sings,       And the swallows float and flee.      I break the spirit's cloudy bands,     A wanderer in enchanted lands,     I feel the sun upon my hands;       And far from care and strife     The broad earth bids me forth. I rise     With lifted brow and upward eyes.     I bathe my spirit in blue skies,       And taste the springs of life.      I feel the tumult of new birth;     I waken with the wakening earth;     I match the bluebird in her mirth;       And wild with wind and sun,     A treasurer of immortal days,     I roam the glorious world with praise,     The hillsides and the woodland ways,       Till earth and I are one.     FOREST MOODS       There is singing of birds in the deep wet woods,     In the heart of the listening solitudes,     Pewees, and thrushes, and sparrows, not few,     And all the notes of their throats are true.      The thrush from the innermost ash takes on     A tender dream of the treasured and gone;     But the sparrow singeth with pride and cheer     Of the might and light of the present and here.      There is shining of flowers in the deep wet woods,     In the heart of the sensitive solitudes,     The roseate bell and the lily are there,     And every leaf of their sheaf is fair.      Careless and bold, without dream of woe,     The trilliums scatter their flags snow;     But the pale wood-daffodil covers her face,     Agloom with the doom of a sorrowful race.     THE RETURN OF THE YEAR       Again the warm bare earth, the noon       That hangs upon her healing scars,     The midnight round, the great red moon,       The mother with her brood of stars,      The mist-rack and the wakening rain       Blown soft in many a forest way,     The yellowing elm-trees, and again       The blood-root in its sheath of gray.      The vesper-sparrow's song, the stress       Of yearning notes that gush and stream,     The lyric joy, the tenderness,       And once again the dream! the dream!      A touch of far-off joy and power,       A something it is life to learn,     Comes back to earth, and one short hour       The glamours of the gods return.      This life's old mood and cult of care       Falls smitten by an older truth,     And the gray world wins back to her       The rapture of her vanished youth.      Dead thoughts revive, and he that heeds       Shall hear, as by a spirit led,     A song among the golden reeds:       \"The gods are vanished but not dead!\"      For one short hour; unseen yet near,       They haunt us, a forgotten mood,     A glory upon mead and mere,       A magic in the leafless wood.      At morning we shall catch the glow       Of Dian's quiver on the hill,     And somewhere in the glades I know       That Pan is at his piping still.     FAVORITES OF PAN       Once, long ago, before the gods       Had left this earth, by stream and forest glade,     Where the first plough upturned the clinging sods,       Or the lost shepherd strayed,      Often to the tired listener's ear       There came at noonday or beneath the stars     A sound, he knew not whence, so sweet and clear,       That all his aches and scars      And every brooded bitterness,       Fallen asunder from his soul took flight,     Like mist or darkness yielding to the press       Of an unnamed delight,--      A sudden brightness of the heart,       A magic fire drawn down from Paradise,     That rent the cloud with golden gleam apart,--       And far before his eyes      The loveliness and calm of earth       Lay like a limitless dream remote and strange,     The joy, the strife, the triumph and the mirth,       And the enchanted change;      And so he followed the sweet sound,       Till faith had traversed her appointed span,     And murmured as he pressed the sacred ground:       \"It is the note of Pan!\"      Now though no more by marsh or stream       Or dewy forest sounds the secret reed--     For Pan is gone--Ah yet, the infinite dream       Still lives for them that heed.      In April, when the turning year       Regains its pensive youth, and a soft breath     And amorous influence over marsh and mere       Dissolves the grasp of death,      To them that are in love with life,       Wandering like children with untroubled eyes,     Far from the noise of cities and the strife,       Strange flute-like voices rise      At noon and in the quiet of the night       From every watery waste; and in that hour     The same strange spell, the same unnamed delight,       Enfolds them in its power.      An old-world joyousness supreme,       The warmth and glow of an immortal balm,     The mood-touch of the gods, the endless dream,       The high lethean calm.      They see, wide on the eternal way,       The services of earth, the life of man;     And, listening to the magic cry they say:       \"It is the note of Pan!\"      For, long ago, when the new strains       Of hostile hymns and conquering faiths grew keen,     And the old gods from their deserted fanes,       Fled silent and unseen,      So, too, the goat-foot Pan, not less"]]]
