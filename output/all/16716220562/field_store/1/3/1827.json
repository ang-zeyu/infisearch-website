They might be hemmed in, with their backs to an unfordable river, and an enemy two or three times as numerous in front.  \"Don't you worry,\" whispered Dalton, with sublime confidence.  \"The general will take us to Virginia.\"  Harry projected his imagination once more.  He sought to put himself in the place of Lee, receiving all the reports and studying them, trying to measure space that could not be measured, and to weigh a total that could not be weighed.  Greatness and responsibility were compelled to pay thrice over for themselves, and he was glad that he was only a young lieutenant, the chief business of whom was to fetch and carry orders.  Shafts of sunlight were piercing the eastern foliage when the council broke up, and shortly after daylight the Southern army was again on the march, with Northern cavalry and riflemen hanging on its flanks and rear. Harry was permitted to rejoin, for a while, his friends of the Invincibles and he found Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire riding very erect, a fine color in their faces.  \"You come from headquarters, Harry, and therefore you are omniscient,\" said Colonel Talbot.  \"We heard firing in the night.  What did it mean?\"  \"Only skirmishers, Colonel.  I think they wanted to annoy us, but they paid the price.\"  \"Inevitably.  Our general is as dangerous in retreat as in advance. I fancy that General Meade will not bring up his lagging forces until we near the Potomac.\"  \"They say it's rising, sir, and that it will be very hard to cross.\"  \"That creates a difficulty but not an impossibility.  Ordinary men yield to difficulties, men like our commander-in-chief are overcome only by impossibilities.  But the further we go, Harry, the more reconciled I grow to our withdrawal.  I have seen scarcely a friendly face among the population.  I would not have us thrust ourselves upon people who do not like us.  It would go very hard with our kindly Southern nature to have to rule by force over people who are in fact our brethren.  Defensive wars are the just wars, and perhaps it will be really better for us to retire to Virginia and protect its sacred soil from the tread of the invader.  Eh, Hector?\"  \"Right, as usual, Leonidas.  The reasons for our retirement are most excellent.  We have already spoken of the fact that Philadelphia might prove a Capua for our young troops, and now we are relieved from the chance of appearing as oppressors.  It can never be said of us by the people of Pennsylvania that we were tyrants.  It's an invidious task to rule over the unwilling, even when one rules with justice and wisdom. It's strange, perhaps, Leonidas, but it's a universal truth, that people would rather be ruled by themselves in a second rate manner than by the foreigner in a first rate manner.  Now, the government of our states is attacked by Northern critics, but such as it is, it is ours and it's our first choice.  Do we bore you, Harry?\"  \"Not at all, sir.  I never listen to either you or Colonel Talbot without learning something.\"  The two colonels bowed politely.  \"I have wished for some time to speak to you about a certain matter, Hector,\" said Colonel Talbot.  \"What is it, Leonidas?\"  \"During the height of that tremendous artillery fire from Little Round Top I was at a spot where I could see the artillerymen very well whenever the smoke lifted.  Several times, I noticed an officer directing the fire of the guns, and I don't think I could have been mistaken in his identity.\"  \"No, Leonidas, you were not.  I too observed him, and we could not possibly be mistaken.  It was John Carrington, of course.\"  \"Dear old John Carrington, who was with us at West Point, the greatest artilleryman in the world.  And he was facing us, when the fortunes of the South were turning on a hair.  If any other man had been there, directing those guns, we might have taken Cemetery Hill.\"  \"That's true, Leonidas, but it was not possible for any other man to be in such a place at such a time.  Granting that such a crisis should arise and that it should arise at Gettysburg you and I would have known long before that John would be there with the guns to stop us.  Why, we saw that quality in him all the years we were with him at West Point. The world has never seen and never will see another such artilleryman as John Carrington.\"  \"Good old John.  I hope he wasn't killed.\"  \"And I hope so too, from the bottom of my heart.  But we'll know before many days.\"  \"How will you find out?\" asked Harry curiously.  Both colonels laughed genially.  \"Because he will send us signs, unmistakable signs,\" replied Colonel Talbot.  \"I don't understand, sir.\"  \"His signs will be shells, shrapnel and solid shot.  We may not have a battle this week or next week, but a big one is bound to come some time or other and then if any section of the Northern artillery shows uncommon deadliness and precision we'll know that Carrington is there. Why, we can recognize his presence as readily as the deer scents the hunter. We'll have many notes to compare with him when the war is over.\"  Harry sincerely hoped that the three would meet in friendship around some festive table, and he was moved by the affection and admiration the two colonels held for Carrington.  Doubtless the great artilleryman's feelings toward them were the same.  They went into camp once more that night in a pleasant rolling country of high hills, rich valleys, scattered forests, and swift streams of clear water.  Harry liked this Northern land, which was yet not so far from the South.  It was not more beautiful than his own Kentucky, but it was much trimmer and neater than the states toward the Gulf.  He saw all about him the evidences of free labor, the proof that man worked more readily, and with better results, when success or failure were all his own.  He was too young to spend much time in concentrated thinking, but as he looked upon the neat Pennsylvania houses and farms and the cultivated fields he felt the curse of black slavery in the South, but he felt also that it was for the South itself to abolish it, and not for the armed hand of the outsider, an outsider to whom its removal meant no financial loss and dislocation.  Despite himself his mind dwelt upon these things longer than before. He disliked slavery, his father disliked it, and nearly all their friends and relatives, and here they were fighting for it, as one of the two great reasons of the Civil War.  He felt anew how strangely things come about, and that even the wisest cannot always choose their own courses as they wish them.  A fire, chiefly for cooking purposes, had been built for the general and his staff in a cove surrounded by trees.  A small cold spring gushed from the side of a hill, flowed down the center of the cove, and then made its way through the trees into the wider world beyond.  It was a fine little spring, and before the general came, the younger members of the staff knelt and drank deeply at it.  It brought thoughts of home to all these young rovers of the woods, who had drunk a thousand times before at just such springs as this.  Soon Lee and his generals sat there on the stones or on the moss. Longstreet, Stuart, Pickett, Alexander, Ewell, Early, Hill and many others, some suffering from wounds, were with their commander, while the young officers who were to fetch and carry sat on the fringe in the woods, or stretched themselves on the turf.  Harry was in the group, but except in extreme emergency he would not be on duty that night, as he had already been twenty-four hours in the saddle.  Nevertheless he was not yet sleepy, and lying on his blanket, he watched the leaders confer, as they had conferred every other night since the Battle of Gettysburg.  He was aware, too, that the air was heavy with suspense and anxiety.  He breathed it in at every breath. Cruel doubt was not shown by words or actions, but it was an atmosphere which one could not mistake.  Word had been brought in the afternoon by hard riders of Stuart that the Potomac was still rising.  It could not be forded and the active Northern cavalry was in between, keeping advanced parties of the Southern army from laying pontoons.  Every day made the situation more desperate, and it could not be hidden from the soldiers, who, nevertheless, marched cheerfully on, in the sublime faith that Lee would carry them through.  Harry knew that if the Army of the Potomac was not active in pursuit its cavalrymen and skirmishers were.  As on the night before, he heard the faint report of shots, and he knew that rough work was going forward along the doubtful line, where the fringes of the two armies almost met. But hardened so much was he that he fell asleep while the generals were still in anxious council, and the fitful firing continued in the distant dark.     CHAPTER III  THE FLOODED RIVER   Harry and Dalton were aroused before daylight by Colonel Peyton of Lee's staff, with instructions to mount at once, and join a strong detachment, ready to go ahead and clear a way.  Sherburne's troop would lead. The Invincibles, for whom mounts had been obtained, would follow. There were fragments of other regiments, the whole force amounting to about fifteen hundred men, under the command of Sherburne, who had been raised the preceding afternoon to the rank of Colonel, and whose skill and valor were so well known that such veterans as Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant Colonel St. Hilaire were glad to serve under him.  Harry and Dalton would represent the commander-in-chief, and would return whenever Colonel Sherburne thought fit to report to him.  Harry was glad to go.  While he had his periods of intense thought, and his character was serious, he was like his great ancestor,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12532"],["title","The Shades of the Wilderness: A Story of Lee's Great Stand (#7)"],["body","a creature of action.  His blood flowed more swiftly with the beat of his horse's hoofs, and his spirits rose as the free air of the fields and forests rushed past him.  Moreover he was extremely anxious to see what lay ahead.  If barriers were there he wanted to look upon them. If the Union cavalry were trying to keep them from laying bridges across the Potomac he wanted to help drive them away.  Harry and Dalton had a right as aides and messengers of Lee to ride with Sherburne, but before they joined him they rode among the Invincibles, who were in great feather, because they too, for the time being, rode, and toiled in neither dust nor mud.  \"Colonel Sherburne may think a good deal of his own immediate troop,\" said St. Clair to Harry, \"but if the men of the Invincibles could achieve so much on foot they'll truly deserve their name on horseback. Where is this enemy of ours?  Lead us to him.\"  \"You'll find him soon enough,\" said Harry.  \"You South Carolina talkers have learned many times that the Yankees will fight.\"  \"Yes, Harry, I admit it freely.  But you must admit on your part that the South Carolinians will fight as well as talk, although at present most of the South Carolinians in this regiment are Virginians.\"  \"But not our colonel and lieutenant-colonel,\" said Happy Tom.  \"Real old South Carolina still leads.\"  \"May they always lead!\" said Harry heartily, looking at the two gray figures.  \"Tell Colonel Sherburne,\" said Happy Tom, who was in splendid spirits, \"that we congratulate him on his promotion and are ready to obey him without question.\"  \"All right.  He'll be glad to know that he has your approval.\"  \"He might have the approval of worse men.  I feel surging within me the talents of a great general, but I'm too young to get 'em recognized.\"  \"You'll have to wait until the sections are not fighting each other, but are united against a common foe.  But meanwhile I'll tell Colonel Sherburne that if he gets into a tight pinch not to lose heart as you are here.\"  Saluting Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire, Harry and Dalton rode to the head of the column, where Sherburne led.  They ate their breakfast on horseback, and went swiftly down a valley in the general direction of the Potomac.  The dawn had broadened into full morning, clear and bright, save for a small cloud that hung low in the southwest, which Sherburne noticed with a frown.  \"That's a little cloud and it looks innocent,\" he said to Harry, \"but I don't like it.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because in the ten minutes that I've been watching it I've been able to notice growth.  I'm weather-wise and we may have more rain.  More rain means a higher Potomac.  A higher Potomac means more difficulty in crossing it.  More difficulty in crossing it means more danger of our destruction, and our destruction would mean the end of the Confederacy.\"  He spoke with deadly earnestness as he continued to look at the tiny dusky spot on the western sky.  Harry had a feeling of awe.  Again he realized that such mighty issues could turn upon a single hair.  The increase or decrease of that black splotch might mean the death or life of the Confederacy.  As he rode he watched it.  His heart sank slowly.  The little baby cloud, looking so harmless, was growing.  He said to himself in anger that it was not, but he knew that it was.  Black at the center, it radiated in every direction until it became pale gray at the edges, and by and by, as it still spread, it gave to the southwest an aspect that was distinctly sinister.  Sherburne shook his head and the gravity of his face increased.  As the cloud grew alarm grew with it in his mind.  \"Maybe it will pass,\" said Harry hopefully.  \"I don't think so.  It's not moving away.  It just hangs there and grows and grows.  You're a woodsman, Harry, and you ought to feel it. Don't you think the atmosphere has changed?\"  \"I didn't have the courage to say so until you asked me, but it's damper. If I were posing as a prophet I should say that we're going to have rain.\"  \"And so should I. Usually at this period of the year in our country we want rain, but now we dread it like a pestilence.  At any other time the Potomac could rise or fall, whenever it pleased, for all I cared, but now it's life and death.\"  \"Our doubts are decided and we've lost.  Look, sir the whole southwest is dark now!\"  \"And here come the first drops!\"  Sherburne sent hurried orders among the men to keep their ammunition and weapons dry, and then they bent their heads to the storm which would beat almost directly in their faces.  Soon it came without much preliminary thunder and lightning.  The morning that had been warm turned cold and the rain poured hard upon them.  Most of the horsemen were wet through in a short time, and they shivered in their sodden uniforms, but it was a condition to which they were used, and they thought little of themselves but nearly all the while of the Potomac.  Few words were spoken.  The only sounds were the driving of the rain and the thud of many hoofs in the mud.  Harry often saw misty figures among the trees on the hills, and he knew that they were watched by hostile eyes as the Northern armies in Virginia, were always watched with the same hostility.  It was impossible for Lee's men to make any secret march.  The population, intensely loyal to the Union, promptly carried news of it to Meade or his generals.  Twice he pointed out the watchers to Sherburne who merely shrugged his shoulders.  \"I might send out men and cut off a few of them,\" he said, \"but for what good?  Hundreds more would be left and we'd merely be burdened with useless prisoners.  Here's a creek ahead, Harry, and look how muddy and foamy it is!  It's probably raining harder higher up in the hills than it is here, and all these creeks and brooks go to swell the Potomac.\"  The swift water rose beyond their stirrups and there was a vast splashing as fifteen hundred men rode through the creek.  It was a land of many streams, and a few miles farther on they crossed another, equally swollen and swift.  They had hoped that the rain, like the sudden violence of a summer shower, would pass soon, but the skies remained a solid gray and it settled into a steady solemn pour, cold and threatening, and promising to continue all day long.  They could see that every stream they crossed was far above its normal mark, and the last hope that they might find the Potomac low enough for fording disappeared.  The watchers on the hills were still there, despite the rain, but they did no sharpshooting.  Nor did the Southern force do damage to anybody or anything, as it passed.  Near noon Sherburne resolved to build a fire in a cove protected by cliffs and heavy timber, and give his men warm food lest they become dispirited.  It was a task to set the wet wood, but the men of his command, used to forest life, soon mastered it.  Then they threw on boughs and whole tree trunks, until a great bonfire blazed and roared merrily, thrusting out innumerable tongues of red and friendly flame.  \"Is there anything more beautiful than a fine fire at such a time?\" said St. Clair to Harry.  \"As it blazes and eats into the wood it crackles and those crackling sounds are words.\"  \"What do the words say?\"  \"They say, 'Come here and stand before me.  So long as you respect me and don't come too close I'll do you nothing but good.  I'll warm you and I'll dry you.  I'll drive the wet from your skin and your clothes, and I'll chase the cold out of your body and bones.  I'll take hold of your depressed and sunken heart and lift it up again.  Where you saw only gray and black I'll make you see gold and red.  I'll warm and cook your food for you, giving you fresh life and strength.  With my crackling coals and my leaping flames I'll change your world of despair into a world of hope.'\"  \"Hear!  Hear!\" said Happy Tom.  \"Arthur has turned from a sodden soldier into a giddy poet!  Is any more poetry left in the barrel, Arthur?\"  \"Plenty, but I won't turn on the tap again to-day.  I've translated for you.  I've shown you where beauty and happiness lie, and you must do the rest for yourself.\"  They crowded about the huge fire which ran the entire length of the cove, and watched the cooks who had brought their supplies on horseback. Great quantities of coffee were made, and they had bacon and hard biscuits.  Although the rain still reached them in the cove they forgot it as they ate the good food--any food was good to them--and drank cup after cup of hot coffee.  Youthful spirits rose once more.  It wasn't such a bad day after all!  It had rained many times before and people still lived. Also, the Potomac had risen many times before, but it always fell again. They were riding to clear the way for Lee's invincible army which could go wherever it wanted to go.  \"Men on horseback looking at us!\" hailed Happy Tom.  \"About fifty on a low hill on our right.  Look like Yankee cavalrymen.  Wonder what they take us for anyway!\"  Harry, St. Clair, Langdon and Dalton walked to the edge of the cove, every one holding a cup of hot coffee in his hand.  Sherburne was already there and with his glasses was examining the strange group, as well as he could through the sweeping rain.  \"A scouting party undoubtedly,\" he said, \"but weather has made their uniforms and ours look just about alike.  It's equally certain though that they're Yankees.  No troop of ours so small would be found here.\"  Harry was also watching them through glasses, and he took particular note of one stalwart figure mounted upon a powerful horse.  The distance was too great to recognize the face, but he knew the swing of the broad shoulders.  It was Shepard and once more he had the uneasy feeling winch the man always inspired in him.  He appeared and reappeared with such facility, and he was so absolutely trackless that he had begun to appear to him as omniscient.  Of course the man knew all about Sherburne's advance and could readily surmise its"]]]
