Farther up, the nurse-girl lay with her head and shoulders propped against the slope of the grassy bank.  She had taken the baby from the perambulator, and it was a motionless bundle of wraps in her arms.  Close behind her a tiny patch upon the roadside showed where the little boy was stretched.  Still nearer to us was the dead cab-horse, kneeling between the shafts.  The old driver was hanging over the splash-board like some grotesque scarecrow, his arms dangling absurdly in front of him.  Through the window we could dimly discern that a young man was seated inside.  The door was swinging open and his hand was grasping the handle, as if he had attempted to leap forth at the last instant.  In the middle distance lay the golf links, dotted as they had been in the morning with the dark figures of the golfers, lying motionless upon the grass of the course or among the heather which skirted it.  On one particular green there were eight bodies stretched where a foursome with its caddies had held to their game to the last.  No bird flew in the blue vault of heaven, no man or beast moved upon the vast countryside which lay before us.  The evening sun shone its peaceful radiance across it, but there brooded over it all the stillness and the silence of universal death--a death in which we were so soon to join.  At the present instant that one frail sheet of glass, by holding in the extra oxygen which counteracted the poisoned ether, shut us off from the fate of all our kind.  For a few short hours the knowledge and foresight of one man could preserve our little oasis of life in the vast desert of death and save us from participation in the common catastrophe.  Then the gas would run low, we too should lie gasping upon that cherry-coloured boudoir carpet, and the fate of the human race and of all earthly life would be complete. For a long time, in a mood which was too solemn for speech, we looked out at the tragic world.  \"There is a house on fire,\" said Challenger at last, pointing to a column of smoke which rose above the trees.  \"There will, I expect, be many such--possibly whole cities in flames--when we consider how many folk may have dropped with lights in their hands.  The fact of combustion is in itself enough to show that the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere is normal and that it is the ether which is at fault.  Ah, there you see another blaze on the top of Crowborough Hill.  It is the golf clubhouse, or I am mistaken.  There is the church clock chiming the hour.  It would interest our philosophers to know that man-made mechanisms have survived the race who made it.\"  \"By George!\" cried Lord John, rising excitedly from his chair.  \"What's that puff of smoke?  It's a train.\"  We heard the roar of it, and presently it came flying into sight, going at what seemed to me to be a prodigious speed.  Whence it had come, or how far, we had no means of knowing.  Only by some miracle of luck could it have gone any distance.  But now we were to see the terrific end of its career.  A train of coal trucks stood motionless upon the line.  We held our breath as the express roared along the same track.  The crash was horrible.  Engine and carriages piled themselves into a hill of splintered wood and twisted iron.  Red spurts of flame flickered up from the wreckage until it was all ablaze.  For half an hour we sat with hardly a word, stunned by the stupendous sight.  \"Poor, poor people!\" cried Mrs. Challenger at last, clinging with a whimper to her husband's arm.  \"My dear, the passengers on that train were no more animate than the coals into which they crashed or the carbon which they have now become,\" said Challenger, stroking her hand soothingly.  \"It was a train of the living when it left Victoria, but it was driven and freighted by the dead long before it reached its fate.\"  \"All over the world the same thing must be going on,\" said I as a vision of strange happenings rose before me.  \"Think of the ships at sea--how they will steam on and on, until the furnaces die down or until they run full tilt upon some beach.  The sailing ships too--how they will back and fill with their cargoes of dead sailors, while their timbers rot and their joints leak, till one by one they sink below the surface.  Perhaps a century hence the Atlantic may still be dotted with the old drifting derelicts.\"  \"And the folk in the coal-mines,\" said Summerlee with a dismal chuckle. \"If ever geologists should by any chance live upon earth again they will have some strange theories of the existence of man in carboniferous strata.\"  \"I don't profess to know about such things,\" remarked Lord John, \"but it seems to me the earth will be 'To let, empty,' after this.  When once our human crowd is wiped off it, how will it ever get on again?\"  \"The world was empty before,\" Challenger answered gravely.  \"Under laws which in their inception are beyond and above us, it became peopled.  Why may the same process not happen again?\"  \"My dear Challenger, you can't mean that?\"  \"I am not in the habit, Professor Summerlee, of saying things which I do not mean.  The observation is trivial.\"  Out went the beard and down came the eyelids.  \"Well, you lived an obstinate dogmatist, and you mean to die one,\" said Summerlee sourly.  \"And you, sir, have lived an unimaginative obstructionist and never can hope now to emerge from it.\"  \"Your worst critics will never accuse you of lacking imagination,\" Summerlee retorted.  \"Upon my word!\" said Lord John.  \"It would be like you if you used up our last gasp of oxygen in abusing each other.  What can it matter whether folk come back or not?  It surely won't be in our time.\"  \"In that remark, sir, you betray your own very pronounced limitations,\" said Challenger severely.  \"The true scientific mind is not to be tied down by its own conditions of time and space.  It builds itself an observatory erected upon the border line of present, which separates the infinite past from the infinite future.  From this sure post it makes its sallies even to the beginning and to the end of all things.  As to death, the scientific mind dies at its post working in normal and methodic fashion to the end.  It disregards so petty a thing as its own physical dissolution as completely as it does all other limitations upon the plane of matter.  Am I right, Professor Summerlee?\"  Summerlee grumbled an ungracious assent.  \"With certain reservations, I agree,\" said he.  \"The ideal scientific mind,\" continued Challenger--\"I put it in the third person rather than appear to be too self-complacent--the ideal scientific mind should be capable of thinking out a point of abstract knowledge in the interval between its owner falling from a balloon and reaching the earth.  Men of this strong fibre are needed to form the conquerors of nature and the bodyguard of truth.\"  \"It strikes me nature's on top this time,\" said Lord John, looking out of the window.  \"I've read some leadin' articles about you gentlemen controllin' her, but she's gettin' a bit of her own back.\"  \"It is but a temporary setback,\" said Challenger with conviction.  \"A few million years, what are they in the great cycle of time?  The vegetable world has, as you can see, survived.  Look at the leaves of that plane tree.  The birds are dead, but the plant flourishes.  From this vegetable life in pond and in marsh will come, in time, the tiny crawling microscopic slugs which are the pioneers of that great army of life in which for the instant we five have the extraordinary duty of serving as rear guard.  Once the lowest form of life has established itself, the final advent of man is as certain as the growth of the oak from the acorn.  The old circle will swing round once more.\"  \"But the poison?\" I asked.  \"Will that not nip life in the bud?\"  \"The poison may be a mere stratum or layer in the ether--a mephitic Gulf Stream across that mighty ocean in which we float.  Or tolerance may be established and life accommodate itself to a new condition.  The mere fact that with a comparatively small hyperoxygenation of our blood we can hold out against it is surely a proof in itself that no very great change would be needed to enable animal life to endure it.\"  The smoking house beyond the trees had burst into flames.  We could see the high tongues of fire shooting up into the air.  \"It's pretty awful,\" muttered Lord John, more impressed than I had ever seen him.  \"Well, after all, what does it matter?\" I remarked.  \"The world is dead. Cremation is surely the best burial.\"  \"It would shorten us up if this house went ablaze.\"  \"I foresaw the danger,\" said Challenger, \"and asked my wife to guard against it.\"  \"Everything is quite safe, dear.  But my head begins to throb again. What a dreadful atmosphere!\"  \"We must change it,\" said Challenger.  He bent over his cylinder of oxygen.  \"It's nearly empty,\" said he.  \"It has lasted us some three and a half hours.  It is now close on eight o'clock.  We shall get through the night comfortably.  I should expect the end about nine o'clock to-morrow morning.  We shall see one sunrise, which shall be all our own.\"  He turned on his second tube and opened for half a minute the fanlight over the door.  Then as the air became perceptibly better, but our own symptoms more acute, he closed it once again.  \"By the way,\" said he, \"man does not live upon oxygen alone.  It's dinner time and over.  I assure you, gentlemen, that when I invited you to my home and to what I had hoped would be an interesting reunion, I had intended that my kitchen should justify itself.  However, we must do what we can.  I am sure that you will agree with me that it would be folly to consume our air too rapidly by lighting an oil-stove.  I have some small provision of cold meats, bread, and pickles which, with a couple of bottles of claret, may serve our turn.

From time to time I have read short stories and magazine articles which have been published about Elizabeth Zane and her famous exploit; but they are unreliable in some particulars, which is owing, no doubt, to the singularly meagre details available in histories of our western border.  For a hundred years the stories of Betty and Isaac Zane have been familiar, oft-repeated tales in my family--tales told with that pardonable ancestral pride which seems inherent in every one. My grandmother loved to cluster the children round her and tell them that when she was a little girl she had knelt at the feet of Betty Zane, and listened to the old lady as she told of her brother's capture by the Indian Princess, of the burning of the Fort, and of her own race for life. I knew these stories by heart when a child.  Two years ago my mother came to me with an old note book which had been discovered in some rubbish that had been placed in the yard to burn. The book had probably been hidden in an old picture frame for many years. It belonged to my great-grandfather, Col. Ebenezer Zane. From its faded and time-worn pages I have taken the main facts of my story. My regret is that a worthier pen than mine has not had this wealth of material.  In this busy progressive age there are no heroes of the kind so dear to all lovers of chivalry and romance. There are heroes, perhaps, but they are the patient sad-faced kind, of whom few take cognizance as they hurry onward. But cannot we all remember some one who suffered greatly, who accomplished great deeds, who died on the battlefield--some one around whose name lingers a halo of glory? Few of us are so unfortunate that we cannot look backward on kith or kin and thrill with love and reverence as we dream of an act of heroism or martyrdom which rings down the annals of time like the melody of the huntsman's horn, as it peals out on a frosty October morn purer and sweeter with each succeeding note.  If to any of those who have such remembrances, as well as those who have not, my story gives an hour of pleasure I shall be rewarded.    PROLOGUE   On June 16, 1716, Alexander Spotswood, Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and a gallant soldier who had served under Marlborough in the English wars, rode, at the head of a dauntless band of cavaliers, down the quiet street of quaint old Williamsburg.  The adventurous spirits of this party of men urged them toward the land of the setting sun, that unknown west far beyond the blue crested mountains rising so grandly before them.  Months afterward they stood on the western range of the Great North mountains towering above the picturesque Shenandoah Valley, and from the summit of one of the loftiest peaks, where, until then, the foot of a white man had never trod, they viewed the vast expanse of plain and forest with glistening eyes. Returning to Williamsburg they told of the wonderful richness of the newly discovered country and thus opened the way for the venturesome pioneer who was destined to overcome all difficulties and make a home in the western world.  But fifty years and more passed before a white man penetrated far beyond the purple spires of those majestic mountains.  One bright morning in June, 1769, the figure of a stalwart, broad shouldered man could have been seen standing on the wild and rugged promontory which rears its rocky bluff high above the Ohio river, at a point near the mouth of Wheeling Creek. He was alone save for the companionship of a deerhound that crouched at his feet. As he leaned on a long rifle, contemplating the glorious scene that stretched before him, a smile flashed across his bronzed cheek, and his heart bounded as he forecast the future of that spot. In the river below him lay an island so round and green that it resembled a huge lily pad floating placidly on the water. The fresh green foliage of the trees sparkled with glittering dewdrops. Back of him rose the high ridges, and, in front, as far as eye could reach, extended an unbroken forest.  Beneath him to the left and across a deep ravine he saw a wide level clearing. The few scattered and blackened tree stumps showed the ravages made by a forest fire in the years gone by. The field was now overgrown with hazel and laurel bushes, and intermingling with them were the trailing arbutus, the honeysuckle, and the wild rose. A fragrant perfume was wafted upward to him. A rushing creek bordered one edge of the clearing. After a long quiet reach of water, which could be seen winding back in the hills, the stream tumbled madly over a rocky ledge, and white with foam, it hurried onward as if impatient of long restraint, and lost its individuality in the broad Ohio.  This solitary hunter was Colonel Ebenezer Zane. He was one of those daring men, who, as the tide of emigration started westward, had left his friends and family and had struck out alone into the wilderness. Departing from his home in Eastern Virginia he had plunged into the woods, and after many days of hunting and exploring, he reached the then far Western Ohio valley.  The scene so impressed Colonel Zane that he concluded to found a settlement there. Taking \"tomahawk possession\" of the locality (which consisted of blazing a few trees with his tomahawk), he built himself a rude shack and remained that summer on the Ohio.  In the autumn he set out for Berkeley County, Virginia, to tell his people of the magnificent country he had discovered. The following spring he persuaded a number of settlers, of a like spirit with himself, to accompany him to the wilderness. Believing it unsafe to take their families with them at once, they left them at Red Stone on the Monongahela river, while the men, including Colonel Zane, his brothers Silas, Andrew, Jonathan and Isaac, the Wetzels, McCollochs, Bennets, Metzars and others, pushed on ahead.  The country through which they passed was one tangled, most impenetrable forest; the axe of the pioneer had never sounded in this region, where every rod of the way might harbor some unknown danger.  These reckless bordermen knew not the meaning of fear; to all, daring adventure was welcome, and the screech of a redskin and the ping of a bullet were familiar sounds; to the Wetzels, McCollochs and Jonathan Zane the hunting of Indians was the most thrilling passion of their lives; indeed, the Wetzels, particularly, knew no other occupation. They had attained a wonderful skill with the rifle; long practice had rendered their senses as acute as those of the fox. Skilled in every variety of woodcraft, with lynx eyes ever on the alert for detecting a trail, or the curling smoke of some camp fire, or the minutest sign of an enemy, these men stole onward through the forest with the cautious but dogged and persistent determination that was characteristic of the settler.  They at length climbed the commanding bluff overlooking the majestic river, and as they gazed out on the undulating and uninterrupted area of green, their hearts beat high with hope.  The keen axe, wielded by strong arms, soon opened the clearing and reared stout log cabins on the river bluff. Then Ebenezer Zane and his followers moved their families and soon the settlement began to grow and flourish. As the little village commenced to prosper the redmen became troublesome. Settlers were shot while plowing the fields or gathering the harvests. Bands of hostile Indians prowled around and made it dangerous for anyone to leave the clearing. Frequently the first person to appear in the early morning would be shot at by an Indian concealed in the woods.  General George Rodgers Clark, commandant of the Western Military Department, arrived at the village in 1774. As an attack from the savages was apprehended during the year the settlers determined to erect a fort as a defense for the infant settlement. It was planned by General Clark and built by the people themselves. At first they called it Fort Fincastle, in honor of Lord Dunmore, who, at the time of its erection, was Governor of the Colony of Virginia. In 1776 its name was changed to Fort Henry, in honor of Patrick Henry.  For many years it remained the most famous fort on the frontier, having withstood numberless Indian attacks and two memorable sieges, one in 1777, which year is called the year of the \"Bloody Sevens,\" and again in 1782. In this last siege the British Rangers under Hamilton took part with the Indians, making the attack practically the last battle of the Revolution.    BETTY ZANE  CHAPTER I.  The Zane family was a remarkable one in early days, and most of its members are historical characters.  The first Zane of whom any trace can be found was a Dane of aristocratic lineage, who was exiled from his country and came to America with William Penn. He was prominent for several years in the new settlement founded by Penn, and Zane street, Philadelphia, bears his name. Being a proud and arrogant man, he soon became obnoxious to his Quaker brethren. He therefore cut loose from them and emigrated to Virginia, settling on the Potomac river, in what was then known as Berkeley county. There his five sons, and one daughter, the heroine of this story, were born.  Ebenezer Zane, the eldest, was born October 7, 1747, and grew to manhood in the Potomac valley. There he married Elizabeth McColloch, a sister of the famous McColloch brothers so"]]]
