Did the paradise, persuaded, Yield her moat of pearl, Would the Eden be an Eden, Or the earl an earl?      X.  A charm invests a face Imperfectly beheld, -- The lady dare not lift her veil For fear it be dispelled.  But peers beyond her mesh, And wishes, and denies, -- Lest interview annul a want That image satisfies.      XI.  THE LOVERS.  The rose did caper on her cheek, Her bodice rose and fell, Her pretty speech, like drunken men, Did stagger pitiful.  Her fingers fumbled at her work, -- Her needle would not go; What ailed so smart a little maid It puzzled me to know,  Till opposite I spied a cheek That bore another rose; Just opposite, another speech That like the drunkard goes;  A vest that, like the bodice, danced To the immortal tune, -- Till those two troubled little clocks Ticked softly into one.      XII.  In lands I never saw, they say, Immortal Alps look down, Whose bonnets touch the firmament, Whose sandals touch the town, --  Meek at whose everlasting feet A myriad daisies play. Which, sir, are you, and which am I, Upon an August day?      XIII.  The moon is distant from the sea, And yet with amber hands She leads him, docile as a boy, Along appointed sands.  He never misses a degree; Obedient to her eye, He comes just so far toward the town, Just so far goes away.  Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand, And mine the distant sea, -- Obedient to the least command Thine eyes impose on me.      XIV.  He put the belt around my life, -- I heard the buckle snap, And turned away, imperial, My lifetime folding up Deliberate, as a duke would do A kingdom's title-deed, -- Henceforth a dedicated sort, A member of the cloud.  Yet not too far to come at call, And do the little toils That make the circuit of the rest, And deal occasional smiles To lives that stoop to notice mine And kindly ask it in, -- Whose invitation, knew you not For whom I must decline?      XV.  THE LOST JEWEL.  I held a jewel in my fingers And went to sleep. The day was warm, and winds were prosy; I said: \"'T will keep.\"  I woke and chid my honest fingers, -- The gem was gone; And now an amethyst remembrance Is all I own.      XVI.  What if I say I shall not wait? What if I burst the fleshly gate And pass, escaped, to thee? What if I file this mortal off, See where it hurt me, -- that 's enough, -- And wade in liberty?  They cannot take us any more, -- Dungeons may call, and guns implore; Unmeaning now, to me, As laughter was an hour ago, Or laces, or a travelling show, Or who died yesterday!          III. NATURE.   I.  MOTHER NATURE.  Nature, the gentlest mother, Impatient of no child, The feeblest or the waywardest, -- Her admonition mild  In forest and the hill By traveller is heard, Restraining rampant squirrel Or too impetuous bird.  How fair her conversation, A summer afternoon, -- Her household, her assembly; And when the sun goes down  Her voice among the aisles Incites the timid prayer Of the minutest cricket, The most unworthy flower.  When all the children sleep She turns as long away As will suffice to light her lamps; Then, bending from the sky  With infinite affection And infiniter care, Her golden finger on her lip, Wills silence everywhere.      II.  OUT OF THE MORNING.  Will there really be a morning? Is there such a thing as day? Could I see it from the mountains If I were as tall as they?  Has it feet like water-lilies? Has it feathers like a bird? Is it brought from famous countries Of which I have never heard?  Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor! Oh, some wise man from the skies! Please to tell a little pilgrim Where the place called morning lies!      III.  At half-past three a single bird Unto a silent sky Propounded but a single term Of cautious melody.  At half-past four, experiment Had subjugated test, And lo! her silver principle Supplanted all the rest.  At half-past seven, element Nor implement was seen, And place was where the presence was, Circumference between.      IV.  DAY'S PARLOR.  The day came slow, till five o'clock, Then sprang before the hills Like hindered rubies, or the light A sudden musket spills.  The purple could not keep the east, The sunrise shook from fold, Like breadths of topaz, packed a night, The lady just unrolled.  The happy winds their timbrels took; The birds, in docile rows, Arranged themselves around their prince (The wind is prince of those).  The orchard sparkled like a Jew, -- How mighty 't was, to stay A guest in this stupendous place, The parlor of the day!      V.  THE SUN'S WOOING.  The sun just touched the morning; The morning, happy thing, Supposed that he had come to dwell, And life would be all spring.  She felt herself supremer, -- A raised, ethereal thing; Henceforth for her what holiday! Meanwhile, her wheeling king  Trailed slow along the orchards His haughty, spangled hems, Leaving a new necessity, -- The want of diadems!  The morning fluttered, staggered, Felt feebly for her crown, -- Her unanointed forehead Henceforth her only one.       VI.  THE ROBIN.  The robin is the one That interrupts the morn With hurried, few, express reports When March is scarcely on.  The robin is the one That overflows the noon With her cherubic quantity, An April but begun.  The robin is the one That speechless from her nest Submits that home and certainty And sanctity are best.      VII.  THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.  From cocoon forth a butterfly As lady from her door Emerged -- a summer afternoon -- Repairing everywhere,  Without design, that I could trace, Except to stray abroad On miscellaneous enterprise The clovers understood.  Her pretty parasol was seen Contracting in a field Where men made hay, then struggling hard With an opposing cloud,  Where parties, phantom as herself, To Nowhere seemed to go In purposeless circumference, As 't were a tropic show.  And notwithstanding bee that worked, And flower that zealous blew, This audience of idleness Disdained them, from the sky,  Till sundown crept, a steady tide, And men that made the hay, And afternoon, and butterfly, Extinguished in its sea.      VIII.  THE BLUEBIRD.  Before you thought of spring, Except as a surmise, You see, God bless his suddenness, A fellow in the skies Of independent hues, A little weather-worn, Inspiriting habiliments Of indigo and brown.  With specimens of song, As if for you to choose, Discretion in the interval, With gay delays he goes To some superior tree Without a single leaf, And shouts for joy to nobody But his seraphic self!      IX.  APRIL.  An altered look about the hills; A Tyrian light the village fills; A wider sunrise in the dawn; A deeper twilight on the lawn; A print of a vermilion foot; A purple finger on the slope; A flippant fly upon the pane; A spider at his trade again; An added strut in chanticleer; A flower expected everywhere; An axe shrill singing in the woods; Fern-odors on untravelled roads, -- All this, and more I cannot tell, A furtive look you know as well, And Nicodemus' mystery Receives its annual reply.      X.  THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.  \"Whose are the little beds,\" I asked, \"Which in the valleys lie?\" Some shook their heads, and others smiled, And no one made reply.  \"Perhaps they did not hear,\" I said; \"I will inquire again. Whose are the beds, the tiny beds So thick upon the plain?\"  \"'T is daisy in the shortest; A little farther on, Nearest the door to wake the first, Little leontodon.  \"'T is iris, sir, and aster, Anemone and bell, Batschia in the blanket red, And chubby daffodil.\"  Meanwhile at many cradles Her busy foot she plied, Humming the quaintest lullaby That ever rocked a child.  \"Hush! Epigea wakens! -- The crocus stirs her lids, Rhodora's cheek is crimson, -- She's dreaming of the woods.\"  Then, turning from them, reverent, \"Their bed-time 't is,\" she said; \"The bumble-bees will wake them When April woods are red.\"      XI.  MY ROSE.  Pigmy seraphs gone astray, Velvet people from Vevay, Belles from some lost summer day, Bees' exclusive coterie. Paris could not lay the fold Belted down with emerald; Venice could not show a cheek Of a tint so lustrous meek. Never such an ambuscade As of brier and leaf displayed For my little damask maid. I had rather wear her grace Than an earl's distinguished face; I had rather dwell like her Than be Duke of Exeter Royalty enough for me To subdue the bumble-bee!      XII.  THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.  To hear an oriole sing May be a common thing, Or only a divine.  It is not of the bird Who sings the same, unheard, As unto crowd.  The fashion of the ear Attireth that it hear In dun or fair.  So whether it be rune, Or whether it be none, Is of within;  The \"tune is in the tree,\" The sceptic showeth me; \"No, sir! In thee!\"      XIII.  THE ORIOLE.  One of the ones that Midas touched, Who failed to touch us all, Was that confiding prodigal, The blissful oriole.  So drunk, he disavows it With badinage divine; So dazzling, we mistake him For an alighting mine.  A pleader, a dissembler, An epicure, a thief, -- Betimes an oratorio, An ecstasy in chief;  The Jesuit of orchards, He cheats as he enchants Of an entire attar For his decamping wants.  The splendor of a Burmah, The meteor of birds, Departing like a pageant Of ballads and of bards.  I never thought that Jason sought For any golden fleece; But then I am a rural man, With thoughts that make for peace.  But if there were a Jason, Tradition suffer me Behold his lost emolument Upon the apple-tree.      XIV.  IN SHADOW.  I dreaded that first robin so, But he is mastered now, And I 'm accustomed to him grown, -- He hurts a little, though.  I thought if I could only live Till that first shout got by, Not all pianos in the woods Had power to mangle me.  I dared not meet the daffodils, For fear their yellow gown Would pierce me with a fashion So foreign to my own.  I wished the grass would hurry, So when 't was time to see, He 'd be too tall, the tallest one Could stretch to look at me.

BOHN'S STANDARD LIBRARY  THE PROSE WORKS OF JONATHAN SWIFT  VOL. III   [Illustration: _Jonathan Swift,  from a picture by Frances Bindon  In the possession of Sir F R Falkiner_]   THE PROSE WORKS  OF  JONATHAN SWIFT, D.D.  EDITED BY  TEMPLE SCOTT  WITH A BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION BY  THE RT. HON. W. E. H. LECKY, M.P.  VOL III  1898   SWIFT'S  WRITINGS ON RELIGION AND THE CHURCH  VOL. I  EDITED BY  TEMPLE SCOTT  1898     PREFACE.   The inquiry into the religious thought of the eighteenth century forms one of the most interesting subjects for speculation in the history of the intellectual development of western nations. It is true, that in that history Swift takes no special or distinguished part; but he forms a figure of peculiar interest in a special circle of his own. Swift had no natural bent for the ministry of a church; his instincts, his temperament, his intellect, were of that order which fitted him for leadership and administration. He was a born magistrate and commander of men. It is, therefore, one of the finest compliments we can pay Swift to say, that no more faithful, no more devoted, no stauncher servant has that Church possessed; for we must remember the proud and haughty temper which attempted to content itself with the humdrum duties of a parish life. Swift entered the service of that Church at a time when its need for such a man was great; and in spite of its disdain of his worth, in spite of its failure to recognize and acknowledge his transcendent qualities, he never forgot his oath, and never shook in his allegiance. To any one, however, who reads carefully his sermons, his \"Thoughts on Religion,\" and his \"Letter to a Young Clergyman,\" there comes a question--whether, for his innermost conscience, Swift found a satisfying conviction in the doctrines of Christianity. \"I am not answerable to God,\" he says, \"for the doubts that arise in my own breast, since they are the consequence of that reason which he hath planted in me, if I take care to conceal those doubts from others, if I use my best endeavours to subdue them, and if they have no influence on the conduct of my life.\" We search in vain, in any of his writings, for any definite expression of doubt or want of faith in these doctrines. When he touches on them, as he does in the sermon \"On the Trinity,\" he seems to avoid of set purpose, rational inquiry, and contents himself with insisting on the necessity for a belief in those mysteries concerning God about which we cannot hope to know anything. \"I do not find,\" he says, in his \"Letter to a Young Clergyman,\" \"that you are anywhere directed in the canons or articles to attempt explaining the mysteries of the Christian religion; and, indeed, since Providence intended there should be mysteries, I don't see how it can be agreeable to piety, orthodoxy, or good sense to go about such a work. For to me there seems a manifest dilemma in the case; if you explain them, they are mysteries no longer; if you fail, you have laboured to no purpose.\"  It must at once be admitted that Swift had not the metaphysical bent; philosophy--in our modern sense of the word--was to him only a species of word spinning. That only was valuable which had a practical bearing on life--and Christianity had that. He found in Christianity, as he knew it--in the Church of England, that is to say--an excellent organization, which recognized the frailties of human nature, aimed at making healthier men's souls, and gave mankind a reasonable guidance in the selection of the best motives to action. He himself, as a preacher, made it his principal business, \"first to tell the people what is their duty, and then to convince them that it is so.\" He had a profound faith in existing institutions, which to him were founded on the fundamental traits of humanity. The Church of England he considered to be such an institution; and it was, moreover, regulated and settled by order of the State. To follow its teachings would lead men to become good citizens, honest dealers, truthful and cleanly companions, upright friends. What more could be demanded of any religion?  The Romish Church led away from the Constitution as by law established. Dissent set up private authority, which could no more be permitted in religious than it was in political matters; it meant dissension, revolution, and the upheaval of tried and trusted associations. Therefore, the Church of Rome and the teachings of Dissent were alike dangerous; and against both, whenever they attempted the possession of political power, he waged a fierce and uncompromising war. \"Where sects are tolerated in a State,\" he says, in his \"Sentiments of a Church of England Man,\" \"it is fit they should enjoy a full liberty of conscience, and every other privilege of free-born subjects, to which no power is annexed. And to preserve their obedience upon all emergencies, a government cannot give them too much ease, nor trust them with too little power.\"  Swift had no passionate love for ideals--indeed, he may have thought ideals to be figments of an overheated and, therefore, aberrated imagination. The practically real was the best ideal; and by the real he would understand that power which most capably and most regulatively nursed, guided, and assisted the best instincts of the average man. The average man was but a sorry creature, and required adventitious aids for his development. Gifted as he was with a large sympathy, Swift yet was seemingly incapable of appreciating those thought-forms which help us to visualize mentally our religious aspirations and emotions. A mere emotion was but subject-matter for his satire. He suspected any zeal which protested too much for truth, and considered it \"odds on\" it being \"either petulancy, ambition, or pride.\"  Whatever may have been his private speculations as to the truth of the doctrines of Christianity they never interfered with his sense of his responsibilities as a clergyman. \"I look upon myself,\" he says, \"in the capacity of a clergyman, to be one appointed by Providence for defending a post assigned me, and for gaining over as many enemies as I can. Although I think my cause is just, yet one great motive is my submitting to the pleasure of Providence, and to the laws of my country.\" If anyone had asked him, what was the pleasure of Providence, he would probably have answered, that it was plainly shown in the Scriptures, and required not the aid of the expositions of divines who were \"too curious, or too narrow, in reducing orthodoxy within the compass of subtleties, niceties, and distinctions.\" Truth was no abstraction--that was truth which found its expression in the best action; and this explains Swift's acceptance of any organization which made for such expression. He found one ready in the Church of England; and whatever his doubts were, those only moved him which were aroused by action from those who attempted to interfere with the working of that organization. And this also helps to explain his political attitude at the time when it was thought he had deserted his friends. The Church was always his first consideration. He was not a Churchman because he was a politician, but a politician because he was a Churchman. These, however, are matters which are more fully entered into by Swift himself in the tracts herewith reprinted, and in the notes prefixed to them by the editor.  It was originally intended that Swift's writings on Religion and the Church should occupy a single volume of this edition of his works. They are, however, so numerous that it has been found more convenient to divide them into two volumes--the first including all the tracts, except those relating to the Sacramental Test; the second containing the Test pamphlets and the twelve sermons, with the Remarks on Dr. Gibbs's paraphrase of the Psalms, in an appendix. It is hoped that this division, while it entails upon the student the necessity for a double reference, will yet preserve the continuity of form enabling him to view Swift's religious standpoint and work with as much advantage as he would have obtained by the original plan.  The editor again takes the opportunity to thank Colonel F. Grant for the service he has rendered him in placing at his disposal his fine collection of Swift's tracts. The portrait which forms the frontispiece to this volume is one of those painted by Francis Bindon, and was formerly in the possession of Judge Berwick.
