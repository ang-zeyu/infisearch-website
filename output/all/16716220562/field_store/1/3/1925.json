All this happened in the smallest fraction of the time it takes to tell it, and, before the German officer and the soldier who were exploring the interior of the automobile could realize what was happening and go to the aid of their companions.  Captain Derevaux and Lieutenant Anderson had acted with almost as much celerity as had Hal, in spite of the fact that Chester's attack had taken them by surprise. Almost at the same moment Hal seized the weapon of his guard Captain Derevaux closed with the third man, and, with his fingers at his throat, was attempting to choke him into unconsciousness.  At the same moment the German commanding officer and his troops ran to the aid of their fellows.  \"Shoot them!\" shouted the officer, drawing his revolver and rushing to take part in the fray. He already held his sword in his hand.  The soldier drew a revolver.  Hal, having disposed of one enemy, clubbed the rifle he had wrenched from him, and, before either the German officer or his man could fire, was in the thick of the mêlée. Lieutenant Anderson, having picked up a rifle dropped by one of the German soldiers, was already there, his weapon also clubbed.  The officer and the trooper were unable to bring their revolvers to bear, and rushed into the fight with their weapons clubbed.  With a single blow Hal crushed the skull of the soldier, and then turned upon the officer who was engaging Anderson.  Lieutenant Anderson and his opponent were still battling desperately for the possession of the latter's gun, and Captain Derevaux and the remaining German trooper were rolling about upon the ground, the captain's finger still pressed into his enemy's throat. Chester had gone to the captain's aid.  Warding off the officer's sword, Anderson suddenly dropped his rifle, and, stepping inside the other's guard, placed the officer hors de combat with several well-directed and lightning-like blows to the face and jaw.  At that moment Captain Derevaux's opponent succeeded in shaking off the captain's grip, and, springing to his feet, leveled his rifle, which he snatched from the ground as he arose, squarely at the young Frenchman.  With a shout Chester sprang forward, picking up a rifle as he leaped, and aimed a smashing blow at the man's head. The clubbed weapon found its mark with a crushing impact, and the man threw up his arms, spun around two or three times, and then fell in a heap.  And it was not a moment too soon. For, as the last German measured his length upon the ground, there was a sudden shout, and a body of cavalry, attracted by the sounds of the conflict, bore down upon the victors.  \"Quick!\" shouted the lieutenant. \"To the machine!\" And, with Hal and Captain Derevaux, he made a rush for the auto.  Chester had stopped to gather up the two revolvers that lay on the ground.  \"Go ahead!\" he shouted. \"I'm coming!\" And, picking up the last revolver, he ran up to the automobile and swung himself aboard, just as Hal, who had climbed into the driver's seat, threw in the clutch, and the machine leaped forward.  At that moment a volley of shots rang out. The whizzing bullets again flew around the car, and there was again the sound of splintering wood, as they smashed into the rear of the auto.  All but Hal dived into the bottom of the car, and he bent as low as possible over the steering wheel.  Soon the sound of firing became less audible, and finally ceased altogether.  Chester, Lieutenant Anderson and Captain Derevaux arose from the bottom of the car and resumed their seats.  \"That's what I call great work, boys,\" declared the lieutenant, putting his hand on Hal's shoulder. \"If it hadn't been for you, I guess the captain and I would be locked up by this time. Isn't that so, captain?\"  \"It certainly is,\" was the reply. \"And had it not been for the prompt action of Chester in that encounter, France would have lost a captain of rifles.\"  Hal and Chester were embarrassed by all this praise.  \"That's all right,\" Hal called over his shoulder. \"You would have done the same for us.\"  At this moment the chauffeur, who had been almost forgotten in the excitement, stirred.  \"Hello,\" ejaculated the captain. \"Our friend is getting better. Guess we had better see what we can do for him.\"  He raised the head of the wounded man to his lap, and wiped the blood stains from his face, while the lieutenant prepared a bandage. In a few minutes the chauffeur had recovered sufficiently to drink a little water and to eat several sandwiches the lieutenant produced from a small but well-filled hamper.  \"Well, I guess we are safe for a little while, at any rate,\" remarked Hal.  \"It looks like it,\" replied the lieutenant; \"but, as I said before, you never can tell.\"  They rode cautiously along in silence for a long time; in fact, until the first streak of dawn appeared in the east. Then, suddenly, the sound of chug-chugging came from behind.  Chester turned his head and jumped to his feet with a cry:  \"We are pursued! Speed up, Hal! Speed up!\"  It was true. Far back could be seen a pursuing automobile, and, even from that distance, it was apparent it was gaining.  Hal \"speeded up\" and in a short time the pursuing car was out of sight. Nevertheless, the speed was not diminished.  \"I guess they have learned that we can travel some, anyhow,\" remarked Hal happily.  And just at that moment there was a loud explosion--the car rocked crazily, and Hal brought it to a stop.  \"Tire blown out,\" exclaimed the French captain, in despair. \"Now we are up against it. What shall we do?\"  \"Fix it,\" retained Chester briefly.  He got out, and the rest, including the wounded chauffeur, followed suit.  At that moment Chester bethought himself of the pursuing machine, and said:  \"We haven't time. Our pursuers will be upon us.\"  \"You are right,\" said the captain, \"but I have an idea.\"  The place in which they had stopped was shaded upon both sides by great trees. As far as could be seen the woods continued. A hundred yards back over the road they had traversed was a sharp curve, hiding any approaching vehicle from sight. Ahead, the road stretched out in a straight line for a considerable distance.  \"I figure this way,\" said the captain hurriedly, \"the machine as it is is doing us no good, is it?\"  \"It certainly is not,\" replied the lieutenant.  \"And, if we wait here long enough to fix it it won't do us any good either, will it?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Then my idea is this: Head the machine straight down the road, lash the wheel fast and start her off. If I am not mistaken, it will run along the road at least to the next curve. Even from here you can see the steep embankment at the curve. When the machine hits that curve it will go over.  \"Now, if that embankment is as steep as it looks, the car, when it hits the bottom, will be out of sight. In the meantime, we hide here until our pursuers pass. The chances are they will continue past the curve, never seeing the wreckage at the bottom of the embankment, believing we are still ahead of them. Then we can continue our journey afoot. What do you think of that idea?\"  \"I think it is first-rate,\" declared Hal, and the others agreed with him.  \"But won't they discover, when they reach the next town, that we haven't passed through?\" asked Chester.  \"They probably will,\" was the reply; \"but we will cross that bridge when we come to it. Besides, there is little doubt in my mind that the authorities in the next town know of our coming. We couldn't be so fortunate a second time.\"  Accordingly the plan suggested was carried out. Hal elected to get in the car and start it, and, as it took a flying leap forward, he hurled himself from the machine to the soft grass beside the road. He was considerably shaken up, but not badly hurt.  Then the five stood and watched the car in its mad flight down the road.  \"I hope that the fact of a tire being bursted won't stop it's sticking to the road,\" said Chester.  Fortunately the car continued its journey in as straight a line as the best chauffeur in the world could have driven, and the five companions strained their eyes as it neared the distant curve.  \"It's almost there!\" cried Hal. \"I hope it makes a good jump; and I hope that embankment is steep.\"  \"And I hope that she makes her leap before our pursuers heave in sight, which is more to the point,\" declared Chester.  Again they strained their eyes, watching the flight of the mad car. And then the car reached the embankment.  \"There she goes!\" cried Chester, and the big machine, as though making a desperate leap, hurled itself into space, where it soared for a moment like a huge bird, and then disappeared from sight.  \"Well, it's gone,\" said the lieutenant sorrowfully; \"and now it's up to us to hoof it, to the next town, at least.\"  The five moved into the woods and just as they gained the first dense covering there was a sound from the road over which they had come.  Dropping to the ground, they peered between the trees. Presently a second huge car, in which could be caught a glimpse of uniforms, rounded the curve, flashed by, and disappeared down the road.  \"Let's go farther into the woods,\" urged Chester. \"We might be seen here.\"  Going deeper and deeper in among the trees the five continued their journey; and, when they felt sure they had penetrated far enough to avoid any chance of detection, they turned their faces northward and set out at a brisk pace.     CHAPTER V.  CAPTURED.   All morning the journey through the woods continued. At intervals the big trees became more sparse, and the party took all precautions against being seen, as they flitted through the open places.  About noon, Lieutenant Anderson made a foraging expedition, and returned with a basket of food, which he had purchased from a nearby farmhouse. Hungrily the five disposed of it, quenching their thirst from a sparkling brook of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12656"],["title","The Boy Allies at Liège; Or, Through Lines of Steel (#5)"],["body"," water. Then they resumed their march.  Night was falling when the travelers at length emerged from the woods. Half a mile ahead could be seen the lights of a town.  Lieutenant Anderson called a consultation.  \"If I mistake not,\" he said, \"those lights indicate the town of Stettin. We shall have to be very careful. They are bound to be on the lookout for us.\"  \"Has anyone a plan?\" he asked, after some further talk.  \"I think I have one,\" returned Hal. \"It might work out all right\"  \"Let's hear it,\" demanded Chester.  \"Yes,\" chorused the others, \"what is it?\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"my idea is that it would be much better for us to separate. If we all approach together we are sure to be recognized. Our number alone would give us away. But, if we go singly, or by twos, from different directions, we stand a chance of gaining the city without being challenged.\"  \"A good idea,\" exclaimed Captain Derevaux; \"I heartily approve of it.\"  \"And I, too,\" declared the young lieutenant; \"and I recommend that we put the plan into execution at once.\"  The lone dissenting voice came from the wounded chauffeur.  \"I don't know your plans, gentlemen,\" he said; \"and I don't want to know them. I have had trouble enough. I am a German, and, from what I have heard, although I know I should look upon you as enemies of my country, I do not believe you mean any harm. Besides, you have treated me well, and I will not betray you. But I must ask that you leave me here. I will make my way into the town some time during the night I shall be perfectly safe.\"  \"Had we not better make him go with us?\" questioned Chester. \"Is he not likely to betray us?\"  \"No; I am sure he would not,\" said Hal.  \"And I,\" agreed the French captain.  \"I am a little inclined to doubt the advisability of leaving him behind,\" said Lieutenant Anderson, \"but--\"  \"Sir!\" broke in the chauffeur. \"I am just as much a gentleman as you are, and my word is my bond!\"  The young Englishman's face flushed.  \"Forgive me!\" he exclaimed, extending his hand. \"I am sorry for my unreasonable doubts. I am sure that you can be trusted.\"  \"I believe that our friend's decision simplifies matters exceedingly,\" declared Hal.  \"In what way?\" demanded the lieutenant.  \"In the first place, it makes one less of us. And, again, it does away with the necessity of one of us approaching the town alone, which is also a good thing. While for two to approach the town is much better than four, under the circumstances, two are also better than one, for the reason that they can give a good account of themselves should occasion arise.\"  \"Which is good reasoning,\" declared Captain Derevaux. \"I agree with you.\"  \"I suggest,\" said Lieutenant Anderson, \"that one of the boys go with you, captain, and the other with me. I shall go back a short distance into the woods, make a detour, and enter the town from the west.\"  \"Another good idea,\" replied the captain. \"Hal and I will wait here half an hour after you have gone, and will reach the town from this side at about the time you and Chester arrive.\"  \"Where shall we meet?\"  \"I believe the best plan would be to meet in the hotel. Whichever of us arrives first will wait for the others.\"  \"Good,\" said the lieutenant. \"The best part of that idea is that, providing we get into the town safely, the hotel will be the least likely place our pursuers will look for us. They probably will figure we will sneak along the outskirts.\"  \"Sure,\" broke in Chester. \"But how are we to get out of the town? Won't the other side be so closely guarded that we can't get through?\"  \"Yes, I suppose they will be laying for us, all right, but we shall have to leave that to luck. The thing to do now is to get in. We will get out as best we may.\"  \"Right,\" declared Hal; \"and I guess that, as long as we are going, we might as well go now. The sooner we start the better, is the way I look at it.\"  Chester and the lieutenant said good-by to the chauffeur, and then Chester turned to Hal and held out his hand.  \"In case--\" he said, as they gripped, and a moment later he and the young lieutenant were gone.  Hal, Captain Derevaux and the chauffeur reentered the woods, where they sat down to wait the half hour agreed upon.  As his chum's form disappeared from sight, striding rapidly along beside the gallant lieutenant, Hal experienced a peculiar sinking sensation in the region of his stomach, while his heart throbbed jerkily, and he turned faint. For almost the first time he realized the real seriousness of the situation.  \"Good old Chester!\" he said to himself. \"I hope nothing happens to him. I wish I could take all the danger upon my own shoulders.\"  In vain did he try to shake off the feeling of uneasiness that oppressed him; and it was with a heavy heart at the absence of his friend that he found himself bidding the chauffeur good-by, when Captain Derevaux roused him from his reverie and announced that it was time for them to be on their way.  Striking out from their shelter, the two approached the town boldly. They walked silently and swiftly.  It was now quite dark, but the gleam of a full moon made their figures plainly discernible. At the edge of the town they unconsciously breathed easier and quickened their step.  Just passing the first house inside the city, they heard the sound of running footsteps behind them. Hal looked over his shoulder. A uniformed figure was hurrying after them.  \"Run!\" cried Hal to his companion, and he suited the action to the word.  The captain also broke into a quick run.  A command of \"Halt!\" behind them went unheeded, and the two friends sped over the ground, heading for the friendly shelter of the first cross street that was now but a few yards away.  Slackening their speed but a trifle, they rounded the corner just as the sharp crack of a rifle rang out. Around a second corner they dodged, and another, and still another.  Stopping a moment to gain a much-needed breath, they could hear the sounds of great confusion, and again they broke into a quick run.  \"The whole town will be aroused and on our track in a few minutes,\" panted Hal. \"We will have to lose ourselves some way awfully quick.\"  Luckily, the streets they had traversed so far had been deserted. But as they rounded another corner they saw a crowd of men coming rapidly toward them.  \"I guess it's all up,\" exclaimed Hal, and the two slowed to a walk.  The crowd moved rapidly, and they advanced to meet it.  \"No use running,\" said the captain. \"We will try to bluff it out.\"  The first man of the crowd to reach them stopped.  \"What's the row back there?\" he asked.  \"Just a street fight, I guess,\" replied Hal. \"We didn't stop to see.\"  \"More than likely some Frenchman has been rounded up,\" said the man. \"Better come along and see the fun,\" and he broke into a trot again.  \"We had better make a bluff at going,\" said Hal to the captain, as he noticed that some of the crowd eyed them queerly.  Turning, they joined the crowd, and began to retrace their steps. They went slowly, however, and the crowd gradually drew away from them. At last, finding themselves behind the last man, they turned suddenly into a side street and broke into a run again.  Turning another corner, they slowed down to a walk.  \"We had better get away from here,\" exclaimed the Frenchman. \"They will be back after us in a minute.\"  They continued their walk, still stepping along at a rapid pace, and at length emerged, without further difficulty, into a brilliantly lighted street, which, they learned, was the main thoroughfare of the town. Mingling with the crowd, they were soon comparatively safe.  \"The thing to do now is to find out where the hotel is,\" said the Frenchman.  Stopping in an open shop, Hal made an inquiry.  \"Two blocks ahead,\" was the reply, and following directions, Hal and the captain soon came upon a large, though unpretentious, hotel. They went in and sat down in the rotunda. Chester and the lieutenant had not arrived, and once more Hal felt that queer sinking sensation in his stomach.  \"If anything has happened to Chester,\" he mused, \"I don't know what I shall do.\"  But his anxiety was soon set at rest, for a few moments later Chester and Lieutenant Anderson appeared in the doorway.  Hal jumped to his feet and seized Chester by the hand.  \"I was afraid--\" he began in a queer voice, but the lieutenant silenced him with a gesture.  \"Careful!\" he whispered.  Hal returned to his seat and Chester and the lieutenant also sat down.  Hal recounted the experience he and the captain had had, and the lieutenant said:  \"Then we have no time to waste. We must leave here at once.\"  Rising, the four companions left the hotel.  \"We must get something to eat before we go,\" declared the Frenchman, and accordingly they dropped into a little restaurant, where they treated the inner man to his entire satisfaction. Then they went to the street again.  \"The best thing we can do is to go straight through the town and out on the other side--if we can,\" said the lieutenant, and they turned their steps toward the north once more.  They reached the northern extremity of the town without difficulty and just as they were congratulating themselves on their good fortune, Hal gripped lieutenant Anderson by the arm and whispered:  \"Look!\"  Not two hundred yards ahead could be seen a line of army huts, extending on either side as far as the eye could see.  \"Ummm,\" grunted the lieutenant. Then: \"Doesn't look like much chance of getting through here.\"  At the same instant there came from the rear the sound of the footsteps of a large body of men approaching with confusion.  \"The crowd!\" cried Hal.  The lieutenant was a man of action, as already has been seen.  \"Follow me!\" he exclaimed, and dashed to the right. His three companions ran after him.  Suddenly the lieutenant stopped and pointed ahead.  \"Horses!\" he whispered. \"Good!\"  He advanced more slowly, the others closely behind him.  \"If we can cut out four horses,\" explained the lieutenant, \"we will have a"]]]
