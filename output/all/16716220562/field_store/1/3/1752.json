I spent nearly a month in Holland completing my preparations, and at length one grey winter morning I took the step that I dreaded. I had left Germany six months before with a feeling that to enter it again and get safely out was hopeless, foolish, dangerous, impossible.  But at any rate I was going to try.  At Zevenaar, while the Dutch customs officials were examining my baggage, I patronised the youth selling apple cakes and coffee, for after several months' absence from Germany my imagination had been kindled to contemplate living uncomfortably on short rations for some time as the least of my troubles.  Furthermore, the editorial opinion vouchsafed in the Dutch newspaper which I had bought at Arnhem was that Austria's reply to the \"Ancona\" Note made a break with America almost a certainty.  Consequently as the train rolled over the few remaining miles to the frontier I crammed down my apple cakes, resolved to face the unknown on a full stomach.  The wheels ground under the brakes, I pulled down the window with a bang and looked out no longer upon the soft rolled military cap of Holland but upon the business-like spiked helmet of Germany.  I steeled myself.  There was no backing out now.  I had crossed the German frontier.  The few passengers filed into the customs room, where a corps of skilled mechanics prised open the contents of bags and trunks. Each man was an expert in his profession.  A hand plunged into one of my bags and emerged with several bars of chocolate, the wrappers of which were shorn off before the chocolate was well out of the bag.  A bottle of liniment, the brand that made us forget our sprains and bruises in college days, was brought to light, and with commendable dexterity the innocent label was removed in a twinkling with a specially constructed piece of steel.  The label had a picture of a man with a very extensive moustache--the man who had made the liniment famous, or _vice versa_--but the trade name and proprietor must go unsung in the Fatherland, for the Government has decreed that travellers entering Germany may bring only three things containing printed matter, viz.: railroad tickets, money and passports.  When the baggage squad had finished its task and replaced all unsuspected articles, the bags were sealed and sent on to await the owner, whose real troubles now began.  I stepped into a small room where I was asked to hand over all printed matter on my person.  Two reference books necessary for my work were tried and found not guilty, after which they were enclosed in a large envelope and sent through the regular censor.  Switched into a third room before I had a chance even to bid good-bye to the examiners in the second, I found myself standing before a small desk answering questions about myself and my business asked tersely by an inquisitor who read from a lengthy paper which had to be filled in, and behind whom stood three officers in uniform.  These occasionally interpolated questions and always glared into my very heart.  When I momentarily looked away from their riveted eyes it was only to be held transfixed by the scrutinising orbs of a sharp, neatly dressed man who had been a passenger on the train.  He plays the double role of detective-interpreter, and he plays it in first-class fashion.  While the man behind the desk was writing my biography, the detective--or rather the interpreter, as I prefer to think of him, because he spoke such perfect English--cross-examined me in his own way.  As the grilling went on I did not know whether to be anxious about the future or to glow with pride over the profound interest which the land of Goethe and Schiller was displaying in my life and literary efforts.  Had I not a letter from Count Bernstorff?  I was not thus blessed.  Did I not have a birth certificate?  Whom did I know in Germany? Where did they live?  On what occasions had I visited Germany during my past life?  On what fronts had I already seen fighting? What languages did I speak, and the degree of proficiency in each?  Many of my answers to these and similar questions were carefully written down by the man at the desk, while his companions in the inquisition glared, always glared, and the room danced with soldiers passing through it.  At length my passport was folded and returned to me, but my credentials and reference books were sealed in an envelope.  They would be returned to me later, I was told.  I was shunted along into an adjoining small room where nimble fingers dexterously ran through my clothing to find out if I had overlooked declaring anything.  Another shunting and I was in a large room.  I rubbed elbows with more soldiers along the way, but nobody spoke.  Miraculously I came to a halt before a huge desk, much as a bar of glowing iron, after gliding like a living thing along the floor of a rolling mill, halts suddenly at the bidding of a distant hand.  Behind the desk stood men in active service uniforms--men who had undoubtedly faced death for the land which I was seeking to enter. They fired further questions at me and took down the data on my passport, after which I wrote my signature for the official files. Attacks came hard and fast from the front and both flanks, while a silent soldier thumbed through a formidable card file, apparently to see if I were a _persona non grata_, or worse, in the records.  I became conscious of a silent power to my left, and turning my glance momentarily from the rapid-fire questioners at the desk, I looked into a pair of lynx eyes flashing up and down my person. Another detective, with probably the added role of interpreter, but as I was answering all questions in German he said not a word.  Yet he looked volumes.  Through more soldiers to the platform, and then a swift and comparatively comfortable journey to Emmerich, accompanied by a soldier who carried my sealed envelope, the contents of which were subsequently returned to me after an examination by the censor.  At last I was alone! or rather I thought I was, for my innocent stroll about Emmerich was duly observed by a man who bore the unmistakable air of his profession, and who stepped into my compartment on the Cologne train as I sat mopping my brow waiting for it to start.  He flashed his badge of detective authority, asked to see my papers, returned them to me politely, and bowed himself out.  My journey was through the heart of industrial Germany, a heart which throbs feverishly night and day, month in and month out, to drive the Teuton power east, west, north, and south.  Forests of lofty chimney-stacks in Wesel, Duisburg, Krefeld, Essen, Elberfeld and Dusseldorf belched smoke which hazed the landscape far and wide: smoke which made cities, villages, lone brick farmhouses, trees, and cattle appear blurred and indistinct, and which filtered into one's very clothing and into locked travelling bags.  But there was a strength and virility about everything, from the vulcanic pounding and crashing in mills and arsenals to the sturdy uniformed women who were pushing heavy trucks along railroad platforms or polishing railings and door knobs on the long lines of cars in the train yards.  Freight trains, military trains and passenger trains were speeding over the network of rails without a hitch, soldiers and officers were crowding station platforms, and if there was any faltering of victory hopes among these men--as the atmosphere of the outside world may have at that time led one to believe--I utterly failed to detect it in their faces.  They were either doggedly and determinedly moving in the direction of duty, or going happily home for a brief holiday respite, as an unmistakable brightness of expression, even when their faces were drawn from the strain of the trenches, clearly showed.  But it is the humming, beehive activity of these Rhenish-Westphalian cities and towns which crowd one another for space that impresses the traveller in this workshop section of Germany.  He knows that the sea of smoke, the clirr and crash of countless foundries are the impelling force behind Germany's soldier millions, whether they are holding far-thrown lines in Russia, or smashing through the Near East, or desperately counter-attacking in the West.  In harmony with the scene the winter sun sank like a molten metal ball behind the smoke-stack forest, to set blood-red an hour later beyond the zigzag lines in France.  Maximilian Harden had just been widely reported as having said that Germany's great military conquests were in no way due to planning in higher circles, but are the work of the rank and file---of the Schultzs and the Schmidts.  I liked to think of this as the train sped on at the close of the short winter afternoon, for my first business was to call upon a middle-class family on behalf of a German-American in New York, who wished me to take 100 pounds to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12418"],["title","The Land of Deepening Shadow: Germany-at-War (#1)"],["body","relatives in a small Rhenish town.  Thus my first evening in Germany found me in a dark little town on the Rhine groping my way through crooked streets to a home, the threshold of which I no sooner crossed than I was made to feel that the arm of the police is long and that it stretches out into the remotest villages and hamlets.  The following incident, which was exactly typical of what would happen in nineteen German households out of twenty, may reveal one small aspect of German character to British and American people, who are as a rule completely unable to understand German psychology.  Although I had come far out of my way to bring what was for them a considerable sum of money, as well as some portraits of their long-absent relatives in the United States and interesting family news, my reception was as cold as the snow-blown air outside.  I was not allowed to finish explaining my business when I was at first petulantly and then violently and angrily interrupted with:--  \"Have you been to the police?\"  \"No,\" I said.  \"I did not think it was necessary to go to the police, as I am merely passing through here, and am not going to stay.\"  The lady of the house replied coldly, \"Go to the police,\" and shut the door in my face.  I mastered my temper by reminding myself that whereas such treatment at home would have been sufficiently insulting to break off further relations, it was not intended as such in Germany.  It was a long walk for a tired man to the _Polizeiamt_.  When I got there I was fortunate in encountering a lank, easy-going old fellow who had been commandeered for the job owing to the departure of all the local police for the war.  He was clearly more interested in trying to find out something of _his_ relations in some remote village in America, which he said was named after them, than in my business.  I returned to pay the 100 pounds and deliver the photographs, and now that I had been officially \"policed\" was received with great cordiality and pressed to spend the evening.  Father, mother, grown-up daughters and brother-in-law all assured me that it was not owing to my personal appearance that I had been so coldly received, but that war is war and law is law and that everything must be done as the authorities decree.  Cigars and cigarettes were showered upon me and my glass was never allowed to be empty of Rhine wine.  Good food was set before me and the stock generously replenished whenever necessary.  It will be remembered that I had come unexpectedly and that I was not being entertained in a wealthy home, and this at a time when the only counter-attack on Germany's success in the Balkans was an increased amount of stories that she was starving.  Evidently the Schultzs and the Schmidts were not taking all the credit for Germany's position to themselves.  They pointed with pride to a picture of the Emperor adorning one wall and then smiled with satisfaction as they indicated the portrait of von Hindenburg on the wall opposite.  One of the daughters wore a huge silver medallion of the same renowned general on her neck.  After nearly a year and a half of war these bard-working Germans were proud of their leaders and had absolute faith in them.  But this family had felt the war.  One son had just been wounded, they knew not how severely, in France.  If some unknown English, soldier on the Yser had raised his rifle just a hairbreadth higher the other son would be sleeping in the blood-soaked soil of Flanders instead of doing garrison duty in Hanover while recovering from a bullet which had passed through his head just under the eyes.     CHAPTER II  WHEN SKIES WERE BLUE  There was one more passenger, making three, in our first-class compartment in the all-day express train from Cologne to Berlin after it left Hanover.  He was a naval officer of about forty-five, clean-cut, alert, clearly an intelligent man.  His manner was proud, but not objectionably so.  The same might be said of the manner of the major who had sat opposite me since the train left Dusseldorf.  I had been in Germany less than thirty hours and was feeling my way carefully, so I made no attempt to enter into conversation.  Just before lunch the jolting of the train deposited the major's coat at my feet.  I picked it up and handed it to him.  He received it with thanks and a trace of a smile.  He was polite, but icily so.  I was an American, he was a German officer.  In his way of reasoning my country was unneutrally making ammunition to kill himself and his men.  But for my country the war would have been over long ago. Therefore he hated me, but his training made him polite in his hate.  That is the difference between the better class of army and naval officers and diplomats and the rest of the Germans.  When he left the compartment for the dining-car he saluted and bowed stiffly.  When we met in the narrow corridor after our return from lunch, each stepped aside to let the other pass in first.  I exchanged with him heel-click for heel-click, salute for salute, waist-bow for waist-bow, and after-you-my-dear-Alphonse sweep of the arm for you-go-first-my-dear-Gaston motion from him.  The result was that we both started at once, collided, backed away and indulged in all the protestations and gymnastics necessary to beg another's pardon, in military Germany.  At length we entered, erected a screen of ice between us, and alternately looked from one another to the scenery hour after hour.  The entrance of the naval officer relieved the strain, for the two branches of the Kaisers armed might were soon--after the usual gymnastics--engaged in conversation.  They were not men to discuss their business before a stranger.  Once I caught the word Amerikaner uttered in a low voice, but though their looks told that they regarded me as an intruder in their country they said nothing on that point.  At Stendal we got the Berlin evening papers, which had little of interest except a few lines about the _Ancona_ affair between Washington and Vienna.  \"Do you think Austria will grant the American demands?\" the man in grey asked the man in blue.  \"Austria will do what Germany thinks best.  Personally, I hope that we take a firm stand.  I do not believe in letting the United States tell us how to conduct the war.  We are quite capable of conducting it and completing it in a manner satisfactory to ourselves.\"  The man in grey agreed with the man in blue.  Past the blazing munition works at Spandau, across the Havel, through the Tiergarten, running slowly now, to the _Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof_.  A bewildering swirl of thoughts rushed through my head as I stepped out on the platform.  More than three months ago I had left London for my long, circuitous journey to Berlin.  I had planned and feared, planned and hoped.  The German spy system is the most elaborate in the world.  Only through a miracle could the Wilhelmstrasse be ignorant of the fact that I had travelled all over Europe during the war for the hated British Press.  I could only hope that the age of miracles had not passed.  The crowd was great, porters were as scarce as they used to be plentiful, I was waiting for somebody, so I stood still and took note of my surroundings.  Across the platform was a long train ready to start west, and from each window leaned officers and soldiers bidding good-bye to groups of friends.  The train was marked _Hannover_, _Koln_, _Lille_.  As though I had never known it before, I found myself saying, \"Lille is in France, and those men ride there straight from here.\"  The train on which I had arrived had pulled out and another had taken its place.  This was marked _Posen_, _Thorn_, _Insterburg_, _Stalluponen_, _Alexandrovo_, _Vilna_.  As I stood on that platform I felt Germany's power in a peculiar but convincing way.  I had been in Germany, in East Prussia, when the Russians were not only in possession of the last four places named, but about to threaten the first two.  Now the simple printed list of stations on the heavy train about to start from the capital of Germany to Vilna, deep in Russia, was an awe-inspiring tribute to the great military machine of the Fatherland.  For a moment I believed in von Bethmann-Holweg's talk about the \"map of Europe.\"  I was eager to see how much Berlin had changed, for I knew it at various stages of the war, but I cannot honestly say that the changes which I detected later, and which I shall deal with in subsequent chapters of this book--changes which are absorbingly interesting to study on the spot and vitally important in the progress and outcome of the war--were very apparent then.  In the dying days of 1915 I found the people of Berlin almost as supremely confident of victory, especially now since Bulgaria's entrance had made such sweeping changes in the Balkans, as they were on that day of cloudless blue, the first of August, 1914, when the dense mass swayed before the Royal Palace, to see William II come out upon the balcony to bid his people rise to arms.  Eyes sparkled, cheeks flushed, the buzz changed to cheering, the cheering swelled to a roar.  The army which had been brought to the highest perfection, the army which would sweep Europe--at last the German people could see what it would do, would show the world what it would do.  The anticipation intoxicated them.  An American friend told me of how he struggled toward the _Schloss_, but in the jam of humanity got only as far as the monument of Frederick the Great.  There a youth threw his hat in the air and cried: \"_Hock der Krieg, Hock der Krieg_!\" (Hurrah for the war).  That was the spirit that raged like a prairie fire.  An old man next to him looked him full in the eyes.  \"_Der Krieg ist eine ernste Sache, Junge_!\" (War is a serious matter, young man), he said and turned away.  He was in the crowd, but not of it. His note was discordant.  They snarled at him and pushed him roughly.  They gloried in the thought of war.  They were certain that they were invincible.  "]]]
