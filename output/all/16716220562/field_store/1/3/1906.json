When the watch had been run up to twenty dollars, it seemed to Baard that his brother was not acting rightly, and he continued to bid until he got it almost up to thirty; as Anders kept on, it struck Baard that his brother could not remember how kind he had always been to him, nor that he was the elder of the two, and the watch went up to over thirty dollars.  Anders still kept on.  Then Baard suddenly bid forty dollars, and ceased to look at his brother.  It grew very still in the auction-room, the voice of the lensmand one was heard calmly naming the price.  Anders, standing there, thought if Baard could afford to give forty dollars he could also, and if Baard grudged him the watch, he might as well take it.  He bid higher.  This Baard felt to be the greatest disgrace that had ever befallen him; he bid fifty dollars, in a very low tone.  Many people stood around, and Anders did not see how his brother could so mock at him in the hearing of all; he bid higher. At length Baard laughed.  \"A hundred dollars and my brotherly affection in the bargain,\" said he, and turning left the room.  A little later, some one came out to him, just as he was engaged in saddling the horse he had bought a short time before.  \"The watch is yours,\" said the man; \"Anders has withdrawn.\"  The moment Baard heard this there passed through him a feeling of compunction; he thought of his brother, and not of the watch.  The horse was saddled, but Baard paused with his hand on its back, uncertain whether to ride away or no.  Now many people came out, among them Anders, who when he saw his brother standing beside the saddled horse, not knowing what Baard was reflecting on, shouted out to him:--  \"Thank you for the watch, Baard!  You will not see it run the day your brother treads on your heels.\"  \"Nor the day I ride to the gard again,\" replied Baard, his face very white, swinging himself into the saddle.  Neither of them ever again set foot in the house where they had lived with their father.  A short time after, Anders married into a houseman's family; but Baard was not invited to the wedding, nor was he even at church.  The first year of Anders' marriage the only cow he owned was found dead beyond the north side of the house, where it was tethered, and no one could find out what had killed it.  Several misfortunes followed, and he kept going downhill; but the worst of all was when his barn, with all that it contained, burned down in the middle of the winter; no one knew how the fire had originated.  \"This has been done by some one who wishes me ill,\" said Anders,--and he wept that night.  He was now a poor man and had lost all ambition for work.  The next evening Baard appeared in his room.  Anders was in bed when he entered, but sprang directly up.  \"What do you want here?\" he cried, then stood silent, staring fixedly at his brother.  Baard waited a little before he answered,--  \"I wish to offer you help, Anders; things are going badly for you.\"  \"I am faring as you meant I should, Baard!  Go, I am not sure that I can control myself.\"  \"You mistake, Anders; I repent\"--  \"Go, Baard, or God be merciful to us both!\"  Baard fell back a few steps, and with quivering voice he murmured,--  \"If you want the watch you shall have it.\"  \"Go, Baard!\" shrieked the other, and Baard left, not daring to linger longer.  Now with Baard it had been as follows: As soon as he had heard of his brother's misfortunes, his heart melted; but pride held him back.  He felt impelled to go to church, and there he made good resolves, but he was not able to carry them out.  Often he got far enough to see Anders' house; but now some one came out of the door; now there was a stranger there; again Anders was outside chopping wood, so there was always something in the way.  But one Sunday, late in the winter, he went to church again, and Anders was there too.  Baard saw him; he had grown pale and thin; he wore the same clothes as in former days when the brothers were constant companions, but now they were old and patched. During the sermon Anders kept his eyes fixed on the priest, and Baard thought he looked good and kind; he remembered their childhood and what a good boy Anders had been.  Baard went to communion that day, and he made a solemn vow to his God that he would be reconciled with his brother whatever might happen.  This determination passed through his soul while he was drinking the wine, and when he rose he wanted to go right to him and sit down beside him; but some one was in the way and Anders did not look up.  After service, too, there was something in the way; there were too many people; Anders' wife was walking at his side, and Baard was not acquainted with her; he concluded that it would be best to go to his brother's house and have a serious talk with him. When evening came he set forth.  He went straight to the sitting-room door and listened, then he heard his name spoken; it was by the wife.  \"He took the sacrament to-day,\" said she; \"he surely thought of you.\"  \"No; he did not think of me,\" said Anders.  \"I know him; he thinks only of himself.\"  For a long time there was silence; the sweat poured from Baard as he stood there, although it was a cold evening.  The wife inside was busied with a kettle that crackled and hissed on the hearth; a little infant cried now and then, and Anders rocked it.  At last the wife spoke these few words:--  \"I believe you both think of each other without being willing to admit it.\"  \"Let us talk of something else,\" replied Anders.  After a while he got up and moved towards the door.  Baard was forced to hide in the wood-shed; but to that very place Anders came to get an armful of wood.  Baard stood in the corner and saw him distinctly; he had put off his threadbare Sunday clothes and wore the uniform he had brought home with him from the war, the match to Baard's, and which he had promised his brother never to touch but to leave for an heirloom, Baard having given him a similar promise.  Anders' uniform was now patched and worn; his strong, well-built frame was encased, as it were, in a bundle of rags; and, at the same time, Baard heard the gold watch ticking in his own pocket.  Anders walked to where the fagots lay; instead of stooping at once to pick them up, he paused, leaned back against the wood-pile and gazed up at the sky, which glittered brightly with stars.  Then he drew a sigh and muttered,--  \"Yes--yes--yes;--O Lord!  O Lord!\"  As long as Baard lived he heard these words.  He wanted to step forward, but just then his brother coughed, and it seemed so difficult, more was not required to hold him back.  Anders took up his armful of wood, and brushed past Baard, coming so close to him that the twigs struck his face, making it smart.  For fully ten minutes he stood as if riveted to the spot, and it is doubtful when he would have left, had he not, after his great emotion, been seized with a shivering fit that shook him through and through. Then he moved away; he frankly confessed to himself that he was too cowardly to go in, and so he now formed a new plan.  From an ash-box which stood in the corner he had just left, he took some bits of charcoal, found a resinous pine-splint, went up to the barn, closed the door and struck a light.  When he had lit the pine-splint, he held it up to find the wooden peg where Anders hung his lantern when he came early in the morning to thresh.  Baard took his gold watch and hung it on the peg, blew out his light and left; and then he felt so relieved that he bounded over the snow like a young boy.  The next day he heard that the barn had burned to the ground during the night.  No doubt sparks had fallen from the torch that had lit him while he was hanging up his watch.  This so overwhelmed him that he kept his room all day like a sick man, brought out his hymn-book, and sang until the people in the house thought he had gone mad.  But in the evening he went out; it was bright moonlight.  He walked to his brother's place, dug in the ground where the fire had been, and found, as he had expected, a little melted lump of gold.  It was the watch.  It was with this in his tightly closed hand that he went in to his brother, imploring peace, and was about to explain everything.  A little girl had seen him digging in the ashes, some boys on their way to a dance had noticed him going down toward the place the preceding Sunday evening; the people in the house where he lived testified how curiously he had acted on Monday, and as every one knew that he and his brother were bitter enemies, information was given and a suit instituted.  No one could prove anything against Baard, but suspicion rested on him. Less than ever, now, did he feel able to approach his brother.  Anders had thought of Baard when the barn was burned, but had spoken of it to no one.  When he saw him enter his room, the following evening, pale and excited, he immediately thought: \"Now he is smitten with remorse, but for such a terrible crime against his brother he shall have no forgiveness.\"  Afterwards he heard how people had seen Baard go down to the barn the evening of the fire, and, although nothing was brought to light at the trial, Anders firmly believed his brother to be guilty.  They met at the trial; Baard in his good clothes, Anders in his patched ones.  Baard looked at his brother as he entered, and his eyes wore so piteous an expression of entreaty that Anders felt it in the inmost depths of his heart.  \"He does not want me to say anything,\" thought Anders, and when he was asked if he suspected his brother of the deed, he said loudly and decidedly, \"No!\"  Anders took to hard drinking from that day, and was soon far on the road to ruin.  Still worse was it with Baard; although he did not drink, he was scarcely to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12633"],["title","A Happy Boy (#3)"],["body"," by those who had known him before.  Late one evening a poor woman entered the little room Baard rented, and begged him to accompany her a short distance.  He knew her: it was his brother's wife.  Baard understood forthwith what her errand was; he grew deathly pale, dressed himself, and went with her without a word. There was a glimmer of light from Anders' window, it twinkled and disappeared, and they were guided by this light, for there was no path across the snow.  When Baard stood once more in the passage, a strange odor met him which made him feel ill.  They entered.  A little child stood by the fireplace eating charcoal; its whole face was black, but as it looked up and laughed it displayed white teeth,--it was the brother's child.  There on the bed, with a heap of clothes thrown over him, lay Anders, emaciated, with smooth, high forehead, and with his hollow eyes fixed on his brother.  Baard's knees trembled; he sat down at the foot of the bed and burst into a violent fit of weeping.  The sick man looked at him intently and said nothing.  At length he asked his wife to go out, but Baard made a sign to her to remain; and now these two brothers began to talk together.  They accounted for everything from the day they had bid for the watch up to the present moment.  Baard concluded by producing the lump of gold he always carried about him, and it now became manifest to the brothers that in all these years neither had known a happy day.  Anders did not say much, for he was not able to do so, but Baard watched by his bed as long as he was ill.  \"Now I am perfectly well,\" said Anders one morning on waking.  \"Now, my brother, we will live long together, and never leave each other, just as in the old days.\"  But that day he died.  Baard took charge of the wife and the child, and they fared well from that time.  What the brothers had talked of together by the bed, burst through the walls and the night, and was soon known to all the people in the parish, and Baard became the most respected man among them.  He was honored as one who had known great sorrow and found happiness again, or as one who had been absent for a very long time.  Baard grew inwardly strong through all this friendliness about him; he became a truly pious man, and wanted to be useful, he said, and so the old corporal took to teaching school.  What he impressed upon the children, first and last, was love, and he practiced it himself, so that the children clung to him as to a playmate and father in one.  Such was the history of the school-master, and so deeply did it root itself in Oyvind's mind that it became both religion and education for him.  The school-master grew to be almost a supernatural being in his eyes, although he sat there so sociably, grumbling at the scholars. Not to know every lesson for him was impossible, and if Oyvind got a smile or a pat on his head after he had recited, he felt warm and happy for a whole day.  It always made the deepest impression on the children when the old school-master sometimes before singing made a little speech to them, and at least once a week read aloud some verses about loving one's neighbor.  When he read the first of those verses, his voice always trembled, although he had been reading it now some twenty or thirty years.  It ran thus:--       \"Love thy neighbor with Christian zeal!       Crush him not with an iron heel,           Though he in dust be prostrated!       Love's all powerful, quickening hand       Guides, forever, with magic wand           All that it has created.\"  But when he had recited the whole poem and had paused a little, he would cry, and his eyes would twinkle,--  \"Up, small trolls! and go nicely home without any noise,--go quietly, that I may only hear good of you, little toddlers!\"  But when they were making the most noise in hunting up their books and dinner-pails, he shouted above it all,--  \"Come again to-morrow, as soon as it is light, or I will give you a thrashing.  Come again in good season, little girls and boys, and then we will be industrious.\"     CHAPTER IV.   Of Oyvind's further progress until a year before confirmation there is not much to report.  He studied in the morning, worked through the day, and played in the evening.  As he had an unusually sprightly disposition, it was not long before the neighboring children fell into the habit of resorting in their playtime to where he was to be found.  A large hill sloped down to the bay in front of the place, bordered by the cliff on one side and the wood on the other, as before described; and all winter long, on pleasant evenings and on Sundays, this served as coasting-ground for the parish young folks.  Oyvind was master of the hill, and he owned two sleds, \"Fleet-foot\" and \"Idler;\" the latter he loaned out to larger parties, the former he managed himself, holding Marit on his lap.  The first thing Oyvind did in those days on awaking, was to look out and see whether it was thawing, and if it was gray and lowering over the bushes beyond the bay, or if he heard a dripping from the roof, he was long about dressing, as though there were nothing to be accomplished that day.  But if he awoke, especially on a Sunday, to crisp, frosty, clear weather, to his best clothes and no work, only catechism or church in the morning, with the whole afternoon and evening free--heigh! then the boy made one spring out of bed, donned his clothes in a hurry as if for a fire, and could scarcely eat a mouthful.  As soon as afternoon had come, and the first boy on skees drew in sight along the road-side, swinging his guide-pole above his head and shouting so that echoes resounded through the mountain-ridges about the lake; and then another on the road on a sled, and still another and another,--off started Oyvind with \"Fleet-foot,\" bounded down the hill, and stopped among the last-comers, with a long, ringing shout that pealed from ridge to ridge all along the bay, and died away in the far distance.  Then he would look round for Marit, but when she had come he payed no further attention to her.  At last there came a Christmas, when Oyvind and Marit might be about sixteen or seventeen, and were both to be confirmed in the spring.  The fourth day after Christmas there was a party at the upper Heidegards, at Marit's grandparents', by whom she had been brought up, and who had been promising her this party for three years, and now at last had to give it during the holidays.  Oyvind was invited to it.  It was a somewhat cloudy evening but not cold; no stars could be seen; the next day must surely bring rain.  There blew a sleepy wind over the snow, which was swept away here and there on the white Heidefields; elsewhere it had drifted.  Along the part of the road where there was but little snow, were smooth sheets of ice of a blue-black hue, lying between the snow and the bare field, and glittering in patches as far as the eye could reach.  Along the mountain-sides there had been avalanches; it was dark and bare in their track, but on either side light and snow-clad, except where the forest birch-trees put their heads together and made dark shadows.  No water was visible, but half-naked heaths and bogs lay under the deeply-fissured, melancholy mountains.  Gards were spread in thick clusters in the centre of the plain; in the gloom of the winter evening they resembled black clumps, from which light shot out over the fields, now from one window, now from another; from these lights it might be judged that those within were busy.  Young people, grown-up and half-grown-up, were flocking together from diverse directions; only a few of them came by the road, the others had left it at least when they approached the gards, and stole onward, one behind the stable, a couple near the store-house, some stayed for a long time behind the barn, screaming like foxes, others answered from afar like cats; one stood behind the smoke-house, barking like a cross old dog whose upper notes were cracked; and at last all joined in a general chase.  The girls came sauntering along in large groups, having a few boys, mostly small ones, with them, who had gathered about them on the road in order to appear like young men.  When such a bevy of girls arrived at the gard and one or two of the grown youths saw them, the girls parted, flew into the passages or down in the garden, and had to be dragged thence into the house, one by one.  Some were so excessively bashful that Marit had to be sent for, and then she came out and insisted upon their entering.  Sometimes, too, there appeared one who had had no invitation and who had by no means intended to go in, coming only to look on, until perhaps she might have a chance just to take one single dance.  Those whom Marit liked well she invited into a small chamber, where her grandfather sat smoking his pipe, and her grandmother was walking about.  The old people offered them something to drink and spoke kindly to them.  Oyvind was not among those invited in, and this seemed to him rather strange.  The best fiddler of the parish could not come until later, so meanwhile they had to content themselves with the old one, a houseman, who went by the name of Gray-Knut.  He knew four dances; as follows: two spring dances, a halling, and an old dance, called the Napoleon waltz; but gradually he had been compelled to transform the halling into a schottishe by altering the accent, and in the same manner a spring dance had to become a polka-mazurka.  He now struck up and the dancing began.  Oyvind did not dare join in at once, for there were too many grown folks here; but the half-grown-up ones soon united, thrust one another forward, drank a little strong ale to strengthen their courage, and then Oyvind came forward with them.  The room grew warm to them; merriment and ale mounted to their heads.  Marit was on the floor most of the time that evening, no doubt because the party was at her grandparents'; and this led Oyvind to look frequently at"]]]
