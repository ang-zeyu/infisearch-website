We knew that the blows were falling       upon our back. Only we felt nothing upon our back any longer. A       flaming grill kept dancing before our eyes, and we thought of       nothing save that grill, a grill, a grill of red squares, and       then we knew that we were looking at the squares of the iron       grill in the door, and there were also the squares of stone on       the walls, and the squares which the lash was cutting upon our       back, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh.        Then we saw a fist before us. It knocked our chin up, and we saw       the red froth of our mouth on the withered fingers, and the Judge       asked:        “Where have you been?”        But we jerked our head away, hid our face upon our tied hands,       and bit our lips.        The lash whistled again. We wondered who was sprinkling burning       coal dust upon the floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on       the stones around us.        Then we knew nothing, save two voices snarling steadily, one       after the other, even though we knew they were speaking many       minutes apart:        “Where have you been where have you been where have you been       where have you been?...”        And our lips moved, but the sound trickled back into our throat,       and the sound was only:        “The light... The light... The light....”        Then we knew nothing.        We opened our eyes, lying on our stomach on the brick floor of a       cell. We looked upon two hands lying far before us on the bricks,       and we moved them, and we knew that they were our hands. But we       could not move our body. Then we smiled, for we thought of the       light and that we had not betrayed it.        We lay in our cell for many days. The door opened twice each day,       once for the men who brought us bread and water, and once for the       Judges. Many Judges came to our cell, first the humblest and then       the most honored Judges of the City. They stood before us in       their white togas, and they asked:        “Are you ready to speak?”        But we shook our head, lying before them on the floor. And they       departed.        We counted each day and each night as it passed. Then, tonight,       we knew that we must escape. For tomorrow the World Council of       Scholars is to meet in our City.        It was easy to escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention.       The locks are old on the doors and there are no guards about.       There is no reason to have guards, for men have never defied the       Councils so far as to escape from whatever place they were       ordered to be. Our body is healthy and strength returns to it       speedily. We lunged against the door and it gave way. We stole       through the dark passages, and through the dark streets, and down       into our tunnel.        We lit the candle and we saw that our place had not been found       and nothing had been touched. And our glass box stood before us       on the cold oven, as we had left it. What matter they now, the       scars upon our back!        Tomorrow, in the full light of day, we shall take our box, and       leave our tunnel open, and walk through the streets to the Home       of the Scholars. We shall put before them the greatest gift ever       offered to men. We shall tell them the truth. We shall hand to       them, as our confession, these pages we have written. We shall       join our hands to theirs, and we shall work together, with the       power of the sky, for the glory of mankind. Our blessing upon       you, our brothers! Tomorrow, you will take us back into your fold       and we shall be an outcast no longer. Tomorrow we shall be one of       you again. Tomorrow...          PART SEVEN        It is dark here in the forest. The leaves rustle over our head,       black against the last gold of the sky. The moss is soft and       warm. We shall sleep on this moss for many nights, till the       beasts of the forest come to tear our body. We have no bed now,       save the moss, and no future, save the beasts.        We are old now, yet we were young this morning, when we carried       our glass box through the streets of the City to the Home of the       Scholars. No men stopped us, for there were none about from the       Palace of Corrective Detention, and the others knew nothing. No       men stopped us at the gate. We walked through empty passages and       into the great hall where the World Council of Scholars sat in       solemn meeting.        We saw nothing as we entered, save the sky in the great windows,       blue and glowing. Then we saw the Scholars who sat around a long       table; they were as shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of the       great sky. There were men whose famous names we knew, and others       from distant lands whose names we had not heard. We saw a great       painting on the wall over their heads, of the twenty illustrious       men who had invented the candle.        All the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered. These       great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us, and       they looked upon us with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a       miracle. It is true that our tunic was torn and stained with       brown stains which had been blood. We raised our right arm and we       said:        “Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council       of Scholars!”        Then Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council,       spoke and asked:        “Who are you, our brother? For you do not look like a Scholar.”        “Our name is Equality 7-2521,” we answered, “and we are a Street       Sweeper of this City.”        Then it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the       Scholars spoke at once, and they were angry and frightened.        “A Street Sweeper! A Street Sweeper walking in upon the World       Council of Scholars! It is not to be believed! It is against all       the rules and all the laws!”        But we knew how to stop them.        “Our brothers!” we said. “We matter not, nor our transgression.       It is only our brother men who matter. Give no thought to us, for       we are nothing, but listen to our words, for we bring you a gift       such as had never been brought to men. Listen to us, for we hold       the future of mankind in our hands.”        Then they listened.        We placed our glass box upon the table before them. We spoke of       it, and of our long quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape       from the Palace of Corrective Detention. Not a hand moved in that       hall, as we spoke, nor an eye. Then we put the wires to the box,       and they all bent forward and sat still, watching. And we stood       still, our eyes upon the wire. And slowly, slowly as a flush of       blood, a red flame trembled in the wire. Then the wire glowed.        But terror struck the men of the Council. They leapt to their       feet, they ran from the table, and they stood pressed against the       wall, huddled together, seeking the warmth of one another’s       bodies to give them courage.        We looked upon them and we laughed and said:        “Fear nothing, our brothers. There is a great power in these       wires, but this power is tamed. It is yours. We give it to you.”        Still they would not move.        “We give you the power of the sky!” we cried. “We give you the       key to the earth! Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest       among you. Let us all work together, and harness this power, and       make it ease the toil of men. Let us throw away our candles and       our torches. Let us flood our cities with light. Let us bring a       new light to men!”        But they looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid. For their       eyes were still, and small, and evil.        “Our brothers!” we cried. “Have you nothing to say to us?”        Then Collective 0-0009 moved forward. They moved to the table and       the others followed.        “Yes,” spoke Collective 0-0009, “we have much to say to you.”        The sound of their voices brought silence to the hall and to beat       of our heart.        “Yes,” said Collective 0-0009, “we have much to say to a wretch       who have broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy!        “How dared you think that your mind held greater wisdom than the       minds of your brothers? And if the Councils had decreed that you       should be a Street Sweeper, how dared you think that you could be       of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets?”        “How dared you, gutter cleaner,” spoke Fraternity 9-3452, “to       hold yourself as one alone and with the thoughts of the one and       not of the many?”        “You shall be burned at the stake,” said Democracy 4-6998.        “No, they shall be lashed,” said Unanimity 7-3304, “till there is       nothing left under the lashes.”        “No,” said Collective 0-0009, “we cannot decide upon this, our       brothers. No such crime has ever been committed, and it is not       for us to judge. Nor for any small Council. We shall deliver this       creature to the World Council itself and let their will be done.”        We looked upon them and we pleaded:        “Our brothers! You are right. Let the will of the Council be done       upon our body. We do not care. But the light? What will you do       with the light?”        Collective 0-0009 looked upon us, and they smiled.        “So you think that you have found a new power,” said Collective       0-0009. “Do all your brothers think that?”        “No,” we answered.        “What is not thought by all men cannot be true,” said Collective       0-0009.        “You have worked on this alone?” asked International 1-5537.        “Many men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new ideas       in the past,” said Solidarity 8-1164, “but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1250"],["title","Anthem (#7)"],["body"," when the majority of       their brother Scholars voted against them, they abandoned their       ideas, as all men must.”        “This box is useless,” said Alliance 6-7349.        “Should it be what they claim of it,” said Harmony 9-2642, “then       it would bring ruin to the Department of Candles. The Candle is a       great boon to mankind, as approved by all men. Therefore it       cannot be destroyed by the whim of one.”        “This would wreck the Plans of the World Council,” said Unanimity       2-9913, “and without the Plans of the World Council the sun       cannot rise. It took fifty years to secure the approval of all       the Councils for the Candle, and to decide upon the number       needed, and to re-fit the Plans so as to make candles instead of       torches. This touched upon thousands and thousands of men working       in scores of States. We cannot alter the Plans again so soon.”        “And if this should lighten the toil of men,” said Similarity       5-0306, “then it is a great evil, for men have no cause to exist       save in toiling for other men.”        Then Collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box.        “This thing,” they said, “must be destroyed.”        And all the others cried as one:        “It must be destroyed!”        Then we leapt to the table.        We seized our box, we shoved them aside, and we ran to the       window. We turned and we looked at them for the last time, and a       rage, such as it is not fit for humans to know, choked our voice       in our throat.        “You fools!” we cried. “You fools! You thrice-damned fools!”        We swung our fist through the windowpane, and we leapt out in a       ringing rain of glass.        We fell, but we never let the box fall from our hands. Then we       ran. We ran blindly, and men and houses streaked past us in a       torrent without shape. And the road seemed not to be flat before       us, but as if it were leaping up to meet us, and we waited for       the earth to rise and strike us in the face. But we ran. We knew       not where we were going. We knew only that we must run, run to       the end of the world, to the end of our days.        Then we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that       we had stopped. Trees taller than we had ever seen before stood       over us in great silence. Then we knew. We were in the Uncharted       Forest. We had not thought of coming here, but our legs had       carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought us to the Uncharted       Forest against our will.        Our glass box lay beside us. We crawled to it, we fell upon it,       our face in our arms, and we lay still.        We lay thus for a long time. Then we rose, we took our box and       walked on into the forest.        It mattered not where we went. We knew that men would not follow       us, for they never enter the Uncharted Forest. We had nothing to       fear from them. The forest disposes of its own victims. This gave       us no fear either. Only we wished to be away, away from the City       and from the air that touches upon the air of the City. So we       walked on, our box in our arms, our heart empty.        We are doomed. Whatever days are left to us, we shall spend them       alone. And we have heard of the corruption to be found in       solitude. We have torn ourselves from the truth which is our       brother men, and there is no road back for us, and no redemption.        We know these things, but we do not care. We care for nothing on       earth. We are tired.        Only the glass box in our arms is like a living heart that gives       us strength. We have lied to ourselves. We have not built this       box for the good of our brothers. We built it for its own sake.       It is above all our brothers to us, and its truth above their       truth. Why wonder about this? We have not many days to live. We       are walking to the fangs awaiting us somewhere among the great,       silent trees. There is not a thing behind us to regret.        Then a blow of pain struck us, our first and our only. We thought       of the Golden One. We thought of the Golden One whom we shall       never see again. Then the pain passed. It is best. We are one of       the Damned. It is best if the Golden One forget our name and the       body which bore that name.          PART EIGHT        It has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in the forest.        We awoke when a ray of sunlight fell across our face. We wanted       to leap to our feet, as we have had to leap every morning of our       life, but we remembered suddenly that no bell had rung and that       there was no bell to ring anywhere. We lay on our back, we threw       our arms out, and we looked up at the sky. The leaves had edges       of silver that trembled and rippled like a river of green and       fire flowing high above us.        We did not wish to move. We thought suddenly that we could lie       thus as long as we wished, and we laughed aloud at the thought.       We could also rise, or run, or leap, or fall down again. We were       thinking that these were thoughts without sense, but before we       knew it our body had risen in one leap. Our arms stretched out of       their own will, and our body whirled and whirled, till it raised       a wind to rustle through the leaves of the bushes. Then our hands       seized a branch and swung us high into a tree, with no aim save       the wonder of learning the strength of our body. The branch       snapped under us and we fell upon the moss that was soft as a       cushion. Then our body, losing all sense, rolled over and over on       the moss, dry leaves in our tunic, in our hair, in our face. And       we heard suddenly that we were laughing, laughing aloud, laughing       as if there were no power left in us save laughter.        Then we took our glass box, and we went on into the forest. We       went on, cutting through the branches, and it was as if we were       swimming through a sea of leaves, with the bushes as waves rising       and falling and rising around us, and flinging their green sprays       high to the treetops. The trees parted before us, calling us       forward. The forest seemed to welcome us. We went on, without       thought, without care, with nothing to feel save the song of our       body.        We stopped when we felt hunger. We saw birds in the tree       branches, and flying from under our footsteps. We picked a stone       and we sent it as an arrow at a bird. It fell before us. We made       a fire, we cooked the bird, and we ate it, and no meal had ever       tasted better to us. And we thought suddenly that there was a       great satisfaction to be found in the food which we need and       obtain by our own hand. And we wished to be hungry again and       soon, that we might know again this strange new pride in eating.        Then we walked on. And we came to a stream which lay as a streak       of glass among the trees. It lay so still that we saw no water       but only a cut in the earth, in which the trees grew down,       upturned, and the sky lay at the bottom. We knelt by the stream       and we bent down to drink. And then we stopped. For, upon the       blue of the sky below us, we saw our own face for the first time.        We sat still and we held our breath. For our face and our body       were beautiful. Our face was not like the faces of our brothers,       for we felt not pity when looking upon it. Our body was not like       the bodies of our brothers, for our limbs were straight and thin       and hard and strong. And we thought that we could trust this       being who looked upon us from the stream, and that we had nothing       to fear with this being.        We walked on till the sun had set. When the shadows gathered       among the trees, we stopped in a hollow between the roots, where       we shall sleep tonight. And suddenly, for the first time this       day, we remembered that we are the Damned. We remembered it, and       we laughed.        We are writing this on the paper we had hidden in our tunic       together with the written pages we had brought for the World       Council of Scholars, but never given to them. We have much to       speak of to ourselves, and we hope we shall find the words for it       in the days to come. Now, we cannot speak, for we cannot       understand.          PART NINE        We have not written for many days. We did not wish to speak. For       we needed no words to remember that which has happened to us.        It was on our second day in the forest that we heard steps behind       us. We hid in the bushes, and we waited. The steps came closer.       And then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a       gleam of gold.        We leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the       Golden One.        They saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists       pulled their arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold       them, while their body swayed. And they could not speak.        We dared not come too close to them. We asked, and our voice       trembled:        “How did you come to be here, Golden One?”        But they whispered only:        “We have found you....”        “How did you come to be in the forest?” we asked.        They raised their head, and there was a great pride in their       voice; they answered:        “We have followed you.”        Then we could not speak, and they said:        “We heard that you had gone to the Uncharted Forest, for the       whole City is speaking of it. So on the night of the day when we       heard it, we ran away from the Home of the Peasants. We found the       marks of your feet across the plain where no men walk. So we       followed them, and we went into the forest, and we followed the       path where the branches were broken by your body.”        Their white tunic was torn,"]]]
