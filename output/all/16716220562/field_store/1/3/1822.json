Upward to God, inward to self, outward to the world. The more one knows God the keener is the longing to get off with Himself alone, the deeper is the yearning to be pure, and the stronger is the passion to help others regardless of any sacrifice involved.    A Long Time Coming.   There is an old story that caught fire in my heart the first time it came to me, and burns anew at each memory of it. It told of a time in the southern part of our country when the sanitary regulations were not so good as of late. A city was being scourged by a disease that seemed quite beyond control. The city's carts were ever rolling over the cobble-stones, helping carry away those whom the plague had slain.  Into one very poor home, a laboring man's home, the plague had come. And the father and children had been carried out until on the day of this story there remained but two, the mother and her baby boy of perhaps five years. The boy crept up into his mother's lap, put his arms about her neck, and with his baby eyes so close, said, \"Mother, father's dead, and brothers and sister are dead;--if _you_ die, what'll I do?\"   The poor mother had thought of it, of course, What could she say? Quieting her voice as much as possible, she said, \"If I die, Jesus will come for you.\" That was quite satisfactory to the boy. He had been taught about Jesus, and felt quite safe with Him, and so went about his play on the floor. And the boy's question proved only too prophetic. And quick work was done by the dread disease. And soon she was being laid away by strange hands.  It is not difficult to understand that in the sore distress of the time the boy was forgotten. When night came, he crept into bed, but could not sleep. Late in the night he got up, found his way out along the street, down the road, in to where he had seen the men put her. And throwing himself down on the freshly shoveled earth, sobbed and sobbed until nature kindly stole consciousness away for a time.  Very early the next morning a gentleman coming down the road from some errand of mercy, looked over the fence, and saw the little fellow lying there. Quickly suspecting some sad story, he called him, \"My boy, what are you doing there?--My boy, wake up, what are you doing there all alone?\" The boy waked up, rubbed his baby eyes, and said, \"Father's dead, and brothers and sister's dead, and now--_mother's_--dead--too. And she said, if she did die, Jesus would come for me. And He hasn't come. And I'm so tired waiting.\" And the man swallowed something in his throat, and in a voice not very clear, said, \"Well, my boy, I've come for you.\" And the little fellow waking up, with his baby eyes so big, said \"I think you've been a long time coming.\"  Whenever I read these last words of Jesus or think of them, there comes up a vision that floods out every other thing. It is of Jesus Himself standing on that hilltop. His face is all scarred and marred, thorn-torn and thong-cut. But it is beautiful, passing all beauty of earth, with its wondrous beauty light. Those great eyes are looking out so yearningly, _out_ as though they were seeing men, the ones nearest and those farthest. His arm is outstretched with the hand pointing out. And you cannot miss the rough jagged hole in the palm. And He is saying, _\"Go ye.\"_ The attitude, the scars, the eyes looking, the hand pointing, the voice speaking, all are saying so intently, _\"Go ye.\"_  And as I follow the line of those eyes, and the hand, there comes up an answering vision. A great sea of faces that no man ever yet has numbered, with answering eyes and outstretching hands. From hoary old China, from our blood-brothers in India, from Africa where sin's tar stick seems to have blackened blackest, from Romanized South America, and the islands, aye from the slums, and frontiers, and mountains in the homeland, and from those near by, from over the alley next to your house maybe, they seem to come. And they are rubbing their eyes, and speaking. With lives so pitifully barren, with lips mutely eloquent, with the soreness of their hunger, they are saying, \"You're a long time coming.\"  Shall we go? Shall we _not_ go? But how shall we best go? By keeping in such close touch with Jesus that the warm throbbing of His heart is ever against our own. Then will come a new purity into our lives as we go out irresistibly attracted by the attraction of Jesus toward our fellows. And then too shall go out of ourselves and out of our lives and service, a new supernatural power touching men. It is Jesus within reaching men through us.     Yokefellows: The Rhythm of Service.        The Master's Invitation.     Surrender a Law of Life,     Free Surrender.     \"Him.\"     Yoked Service.     In Step With Jesus.     The Scar-marks of Surrender.     Full Power Through Rhythm.     He Is Our Peace.     The Master's Touch.     Yokefellows: The Rhythm of Service.  (Matthew xi. 25-30; Luke x:1, 17, 21-24.)    The Master's Invitation.   It was about six months before the tragic end that Jesus sent out thirty-five deputations of two each. He was beginning that slow memorable journey south that ended finally at the cross. These men are sent ahead to prepare the way. By and by they return and make a glad exultant report of the good results attending their work. Even the demons had acknowledged the power of Jesus' name on their lips.  As He was listening Jesus looked up, and said, \"Father, I thank Thee.\" And then, as though He could see those great crowds to whom they had been ministering in His name, He said, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\"  There are two invitations here, \"come\" and \"take.\" There are two sorts of people. Those who are tugging and straining at work, and carrying heavy burdens, and then those who have received rest, and are now asked to go a step farther. There are two kinds of rest, a given rest, and a found rest. The given rest cannot be found. It comes as a sheer out gift, from Jesus' own hand. The found rest cannot be given, may I say? It comes stealing its gentle way in as one fits into Jesus' plan for his life.  Many folks have accepted the first of these invitations. They have \"come\" to Jesus, and received sweet rest from His hand. But they have gone no farther. At the close of that first invitation there is a punctuation period, a full stop. Some of the old schoolbooks used to say that one should stop at a period and count four. Well, a great many people have followed that old rule here, and more than followed. They have stopped at that period, and never gotten past it. I want just now to ask you to come with me as we talk together a bit about this second invitation, \"Take My yoke.\"  Jesus used several different words in tying people up to Himself. There is a growth in them, as He draws us nearer and nearer. First always is the invitation \"Come unto Me.\" That means salvation, life. Then He says, \"Follow Me,\" \"Come after Me.\" That means discipleship. \"Learn of Me\" means training in discipleship. \"Yoke up with Me\" means closest fellowship. \"Abide in Me\" leads one out into abundant life. \"As the Father hath sent Me, even so send I you,\" means living Jesus' life over again. And then the last \"Go ye\" is the outer reach of all, service for a world.    Surrender a Law of Life.   Just now we want to talk together over this little three-worded sentence from Jesus' lips, \"Take My yoke.\" What does it mean? Well, that word yoke is used in all literature outside of this book, as well as here, to mean this: surrender by one and mastery by another one. Where two nations have fought and the weaker has been forced to yield, it is quite commonly spoken of as wearing the yoke of the stronger nation. The Romans required their prisoners of war to pass under a yoke, sometimes a common cattle yoke, sometimes an improvised yoke, to indicate their utter subjugation. These Hebrews to whom Jesus is speaking are writhing with sore shoulders under the galling yoke of the Romans. One can imagine an emphasis placed on the \"My.\" As though Jesus would say, \"You have one yoke now; change yokes. Take _My_ yoke.\"  There is too a higher, finer meaning to this surrender when by mutual arrangement and free consent there is a yielding of one to another for a purpose. And so what Jesus means here is simply this--_surrender_. Bend your head down, bend down your neck, even though it's a bit stiff going your own way, and fit it into this yoke of mine. Surrender to Me as your Master.  And somebody says, \"I don't like that. 'Surrender!' that sounds like force. I thought salvation was _free_.\" Will you please remember that the principle of surrender is a law of all life. It is the law of military life, inside the army. Every man there has surrendered to the officers above him. In some armies that surrender has amounted to absolute control of a man's person and property by the head of the army. It is the law of naval service. The moment a man steps on board a man-of-war to serve he surrenders the control of his life and movements absolutely to the officer in command.  It is the law in public, political life. A man entering the President's cabinet, as a secretary of some department, surrenders any divergent views he may have to those of his chief. With the largest freedom of thought that must always be where there are strong men, yet there must of necessity be the one dominant will if the administration is to be a powerful one. It is the law of commercial life. The man entering the employ of a bank, a manufacturing concern, a corporation of any sort, in whatever capacity, enters to do the will of somebody else. Always there must be the one dominant will if there is to be power and success.  And then may I hush my voice and speak of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12529"],["title","Quiet Talks on Service (#6)"],["body","more sacred things very softly and remind you of this. Surrender is the law of the highest form of life known to us men. I mean wedded life. Where the surrender is not by one to the other, but by each to the other. Two wills, always two wills where there is strong life, yet in effect but one. Two persons but only one purpose.  And so you see, Jesus, the Master, the greatest of earth's teachers and philosophers, is striking the keynote of life when here He asks us to surrender freely and wholly to Himself as the autocrat of our lives. He asks us to bend our strong wills to His, to yield our lives, our plans, our ambitions, our friendships, our gold, absolutely to His control.    Free Surrender.   And if you still do not like the sound of that word surrender. It has a harsh sound that grates upon your nerves. Will you please notice the first word of that little sentence--\"Take.\" Jesus does not say in sharp, hard tones, \"Come here; bend down; I'll _put_ this yoke on you.\" Never that. If you will, of your own glad accord, freely, winsomely _take_ the yoke upon you--that is what He asks. In military usage surrender is _forced_. Here it must be _free_. Nothing else would be acceptable to Jesus.  When our commissioners went a few years ago to Paris to treat with the Spaniards, the latter are said to have desired certain changes in the language of the protocol. With the polished suavity for which they are noted the Spaniards urged that there be made slight changes in the _words_: no real change in the meaning, they said, simply in the verbiage. And our Judge Day at the head of the American Commissioners, listened politely and patiently until the plea was presented. And then he quietly said, \"The article will be signed _as it reads_.\" And the Spaniards protested, with much courtesy. The change asked for was trivial, merely in the language, not in the force of the words. And our men listened patiently and courteously. Then Mr. Day is said to have locked his little square jaw and replied very quietly, \"The article will be signed as it reads.\" And the article was so signed. That is military usage. The surrender was forced. The strength of the American fleets, the prestige of great victory were back of the quiet man's demand.  But that is not the law here. Jesus asks for only what we give freely and spontaneously. He does not want anything except what is given with a free, glad heart. This is to be a _voluntary_ surrender. Jesus is a voluntary Saviour. He wants only voluntary followers. He would have us be as Himself. The oneness of spirit leads the way into the intimacy of closest friendship. And that is His thought for us.  Do you remember those fine lines, \"The quality of mercy is not _strained_\"--if the thing be forced through a strainer, there is no mercy there--\"it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.\" Only what the warm current of His love draws out does Jesus desire from us. It is to be a _free_ surrender.    \"Him.\"   And if you still knit your mental brows, and shrug your shoulder. The thing hasn't yet shaken off the harshness you have been clothing it with. Please notice the second word of that sentence--\"My.\" \"Take _My_ Yoke.\" May I say gently but frankly that I would not surrender the control of my life to any of you who are listening so kindly. And I surely would not ask that I should be the autocrat of any of your lives. But--when--_Jesus_ comes along. The Man with the marvelous face all torn and scarred, but with that great, soft, shining light. I do not know just how all of you feel. I can guess how some of you feel. But I know one man who cannot respond too quickly and eagerly. The only thing to do is to make the will as strong as it can be made, and then to use all of its strength in surrendering eagerly to this matchless Man Jesus. Doubtless many of you know fully that same eagerness, and maybe more.  I remember a simple story that twined its clinging tendril lingers about my heart. It was of a woman whose long years had ripened her hair, and sapped her strength. She was a true saint in her long life of devotion to God. She knew the Bible by heart, and would repeat long passages from memory. But as the years came the strength went, and with it the memory gradually went too, to her grief. She seemed to have lost almost wholly the power to recall at will what had been stored away.  But one precious bit still stayed. She would sit by the big sunny window of the sitting room in her home, repeating over that one bit, as though chewing a delicious titbit, \"I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.\" By and by part of that seemed to slip its hold, and she would quietly be repeating, \"that which I have committed to Him.\"  The last few weeks as the ripened old saint hovered about the border land between this and the spirit world her feebleness increased. Her loved ones would notice her lips moving. And thinking she might be needing some creature comfort they would go over and bend down to listen for her request. And time and again they found the old saint repeating over to herself one word, over and over again, the same one word, \"Him--_Him_--Him.\" She had list the whole Bible but one word. But she had the whole Bible in that one word. Did she not? This is a surrender to _Him_, the Man of the Book. The Man of all life.    Yoked Service.   They tell me that on a farm the yoke means service. Cattle are yoked to serve, and to serve better, and to serve more easily. This is a surrender for service, not for idleness. In military usage surrender often means being kept in enforced idleness and under close guard. But this is not like that. It is all up on a much higher plane. Jesus has every man's life planned. It always awes me to recall that simple tremendous fact. With loving strong thoughtfulness He has thought into each of our lives, and planned it out, in whole, and in detail. He comes to a man and says, \"_I know_ you. I have been _thinking_ about you.\" Then very softly--\"I--_love_--you. I _need_ you, for a plan of Mine. _Please_ let Me have the control of your life and all your power, for My plan.\" It is a surrender for service.  It is _yoked_ service. There are two bows or loops to a yoke. A yoke in action has both sides occupied, and as surely as I bow down My head and slip it into the bow on one side--I know there is _Somebody else_ on the other side. It is yoked living now, yoked fellowship, yoked service. It is not working _for_ God now. It is working _with_ Him. Jesus never sends anybody ahead alone. He treads down the pathway through every thicket, pushes aside the thorn-bushes, and clears the way, and then says with that taking way of His, \"Come along with Me. Let's go together, you and I.\"  A man got up in a meeting to speak. It was down in Rhode Island, out a bit from Providence. He was a farmer, an old man. He had become a Christian late in life, and this evening was telling about his start. He had been a rough, bad man. He said that when he became a Christian even the cat knew that some change had taken place. That caught my ear. It had a genuine ring. It seemed prophetic of the better day coming for all the lower animal creation. So I listened.  He said that the next morning after the change of purpose he was going down to the village a little distance from his farm. He swung along the road, happy in heart, singing softly to himself, and thinking about the Saviour. All at once he could feel the fumes coming out of a saloon ahead. He couldn't see the place yet, but his keen trained nose felt it. The odors came out strong, and gripped him.  He said he was frightened, and wondered how he would get by. He had never gone by before, he said; always gone in; but he couldn't go in now. But what to do, that was the rub. Then he smiled, and said, \"I remembered, and I said, 'Jesus, you'll have to come along and help me get by, I never can by myself.'\" And then in his simple, illiterate way he said, \"_and He come_--and _we_ went by, and we've been going by ever since.\"  Ah, the old Rhode Island farmer had found the whole simple philosophy of the true life. Our Yokefellow is always there alongside. Every temptation that comes to us He has felt the sharp edge of, and can overcome. Every problem, every difficulty, every opportunity He knows, and is right there, swinging in rhythmic step alongside. It's yoked living and yoked service.    In Step with Jesus.   Then please mark keenly that this surrender is for _surrendered_ service. No free-lancing here. No guerrilla warfare, no bushwhacking. There seems to be quite a lot of that, in this army. Some earnest folks are very busy \"helping God out,\" regardless of the general movement of the whole army. And a great help they are too--they _think_. It would be difficult to see how God would ever get along without them--they _seem_ to think. Poor folks, they have gotten so covered with the dust made by their own feet that they've completely lost track of things. There is a Lord to this harvest. There is a great Commander-in-chief to this campaign. He has the whole campaign for a _world_ carefully planned out. And each man's part in it is planned too. He knows best what needs to be done. He sees keenly the strategic points, and the emergencies. If only He could but depend on our ears being trained to know His voice, and our wills trained to simple, full obedience, how much difference it would make to Him. Simple, full strong obedience seems to take the keenest intelligence, the strongest will, and the most thorough discipline.      \"Just to ask Him what to do,           All the day.     And to make you quick and true           To obey.\"[3]  This surrender is for glad, obedient surrendered service.  And note too that it is for _training_ in service.
