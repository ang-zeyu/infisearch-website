Only take good care of Prudy; now remember.\"  \"Grandma always says that over,\" said Susy, as the three children were on their way to the meadow; \"and aunt Madge always says it too--'take care of Prudy!' As if she were a little baby.\"  \"That is all because she cries so much, I presume,\" said Grace, looking at poor Prudy rather sternly. \"I did hope, Susy, that when Horace went down to the 'crick' fishing, you and I might go off by ourselves, and have a nice time for once. But here is 'little Pitcher' right at our heels. We never can have any peace. Little Miss Somebody thinks she must follow, of course.\"  \"Yes, that's the way it is,\" said Susy. \"Some folks are always round, you know.\"  \"Now, Susy,\" said Prudy, forcing back her tears as well as she could, \"I guess you don't love your little sister, or you wouldn't talk that way to me.\"  They gathered strawberries for a while in silence, Prudy picking more leaves than berries, and sometimes, in her haste to keep up with the others, pulling up grass by the roots.  \"Well, I don't think much of this,\" said Grace; \"there ain't more than ten strawberries in this meadow, and those ain't bigger than peas.\"  \"O, I know it,\" said Susy, in the tone of one who has made up her mind for the worst. \"I suppose we've got to stay here, though. We could go up in the Pines now if it wasn't for Prudy, and they are real thick up there.\"  \"Yes,\" said Grace, \"but grandma knew we couldn't without she would be sure to follow. Do you think Mr. Judkins would be likely to scold, Susy?\"  \"No, indeed,\" said Susy, eating a dry strawberry. \"He keeps sheep, and goes round talking to himself. I ain't a bit afraid of him. What could we little girls do to his grass, I'd like to know? It isn't as if we were great, rude boys, is it, Grace?\"  \"No,\" said Grace, thoughtfully. \"Now if we could only get rid of Prudy----\"  Little Prudy pushed back her \"shaker,\" and looked up, showing a pair of flushed cheeks damp with tears.  \"I don't think you are very polite to me,\" said the child. \"Bime-by I shall go to heaven, and I shan't never come back any more, and then I guess you'll cry.\"  \"What shall we do?\" said Grace, looking at Susy; \"we mustn't take her, and we can't go without her.\"  \"Well, I'm a-goin' right straight home, right off--that's what I'm goin' to do,\" said Prudy, \"and when I say my prayers, I shall just tell God how naughty you be!\"  Prudy turned short about, and the girls went toward the Pines, feeling far from happy, for a \"still, small voice\" told them they were doing wrong.  They had got about half way up the hill, when, looking back, there was Prudy, puffing and running for dear life.  \"I thought you had gone home,\" said Susy, quite vexed.  \"Well, I didn't,\" said Prudy, who had got her smiles all back again; \"I couldn't get home--'cause--I got my feet 'most damp and some wet. I won't be no trouble, Susy.\"  So the girls made the best of it, and helped little \"Mother Bunch\" up the long, steep hill. Prudy had one hearty cry before the long walk was over. \"Her nose fell on a rock,\" she said; but as it was only grazed a little, she soon forgot about it.  \"This is something worth while, now,\" said Grace, after they had at last reached the field, and were seated in the tall grass. \"The strawberries are as thick as spatter.\"  \"Yes,\" said Susy, \"and grandma and aunt Madge will be so glad to see our baskets full they'll certainly be glad we didn't stay in the meadow. Big as your thumb, ain't they?\"  [Illustration: FLYING FROM THE FIELD.]  You see the girls were trying to stifle that still, small voice, and they tried to believe they were having a good time.  Grace and Susy had got their baskets nearly half full, and Prudy had covered the bottom of hers with leaves, stems, and a few berries, when a man's voice was heard muttering, not far off.  \"O Grace,\" whispered Susy, \"that's Mr. Judkins!\"  He carried a whetstone, on which he was sharpening his jackknife.  \"Ah,\" said he, talking to himself, and not appearing to notice the girls, \"I never would have thought that these little children--ah, would have come into my field--ah, and trampled down my grass! I shall hate--ah, to cut off their little ears--ah, and see the blood running down!\"  I suppose it was not two minutes before the children had left that field, pulling the screaming Prudy through the bars as roughly as if she had been a sack of wool instead of flesh and blood,--their hair flying in the wind, and their poor little hearts pounding against their sides like trip-hammers. If the field had been on fire they could not have run faster, dragging helpless Prudy, who screamed all the way at the very top of her voice.  Susy and Prudy had thrown away their pretty little baskets. Grace had pushed hers up her arm, and her sleeve was soaking in the red juice of the bruised strawberries, while little streams of juice were trickling down her nice, buff-colored dress, ruining it entirely.  \"You hadn't ought to have took me up there,\" sobbed Prudy, as soon as she could find her voice; and these were the first words spoken.  \"O, hush, hush right up!\" cried Susy, in terror. \"He's after us, to take us to jail.\"  The family were really frightened when the panting children rushed into the house in such a plight.  \"It was a crazy drunk man,\" cried Prudy, \"and he had a axe----\"  \"No,\" said Grace, \"it was that wicked Mr. Judkins, and it was his jackknife.\"  \"And he snips off your ears and nose,\" broke in Prudy, \"and blood comes a-runnin' down, and he kills you dead, and then he puts you in jail, and then he chased us--don't you hear him comin'?\"  \"What does all this mean?\" cried grandma and aunt Madge in one breath. \"Have you been in that mowing-field, children?\"  Grace and Susy hung their heads.  \"Yes, they did,\" said Prudy, \"and I wasn't well, and they shouldn't have gone and took me up there, and 'twas 'cause they were naughty.\"  \"What shall I do with children that disobey me in this manner?\" said grandma, much displeased.  \"Worst of all,\" said aunt Madge, pulling off Prudy's shoes, \"this child has got her feet wet, and is sure to be sick.\"     CHAPTER VI  PRUDY SICK   When aunt Madge went up stairs that night she found little Prudy hiding her head under the pillow, and screaming with fright.  \"O, there I was!\" cried the child, tossing up her arms, \"all tumbled out of the window! And the man got me, and I begun to be dead!\"  \"Why no, darling!\" said aunt Madge, \"here is auntie close by you, and here you are in your pretty white bed;--don't you see?\"  \"No, no!\" screamed Prudy, \"I'm up in the Pines, I ain't here.\"  \"Perhaps you'd like to have me sing to you,\" said aunt Madge; and she began, in a low voice, a little ditty Prudy loved:      \"There was a little darling       I used to know,     And they called her Prudy,       Long time ago.\"  \"Stop, Nancy,\" said Prudy, \"you put a toad in my mouth!--I must have a drink--dreffully!\"  Aunt Madge brought some water, but her fingers were not steady, and the glass trembled against the child's hot lips. She watched till Prudy dozed again, and then stole softly down stairs to get a \"night candle,\" and to tell her mother she was really afraid Prudy was going to be sick.  But Mrs. Parlin said aunt Madge mustn't be nervous; that children were very apt to be \"out of their heads\" in the night, and she was pretty sure Prudy would wake up bright in the morning.  Aunt Madge tried to hope so, but she hardly slept a wink, for Prudy tossed and twisted all night. Sometimes she thought she was picking berries on the tufted coverlet. Sometimes she cried out that \"the crazy man was coming with a axe.\"  When grandma saw her purple cheeks by daylight she did not laugh at aunt Madge. She brushed the soft curls away from the little one's hot temples, and said softly,--  \"How do you feel, Prudy, darling?\"  A wild light burned in the child's eyes. \"It isn't Prudy!\" screamed she, \"I ain't her! Go 'way! You're goin' to snip off my nose! O, go right off!\"  You may be sure that Grace and Susy were far from happy that day. When they noticed that their grandmother grew more and more uneasy, and when they saw the doctor's gig at the gate, their hearts were very heavy.  \"O Grace,\" said Susy, sobbing, \"Prudy thought we didn't love her! We kept saying she was always round. How much do you suppose she is sick?\"  \"O dear, I don't know,\" said Grace, wringing her hands; \"but I'll tell you one thing--we ought to have seen to her, Susy!\"  \"O Grace,\" said Susy, \"you don't begin to feel so bad as I do--you can't, because you haven't got any little sister. Only think of my scolding to such a darling little thing as she is!\"  \"Come, you go up stairs and see what the doctor says,\" said Grace; \"you steal in easy.\"  \"O, I don't dare to,\" whispered Susy, \"I'm all of a tremble.\" But the moment their grandmother's step was heard in the passage they flew to her.  Mrs. Parlin set her vial down on the hall table. \"I don't like to tell you,\" said she, shaking her head sadly; \"the doctor calls her a very sick child, and says he is afraid of brain fever.\"  \"Do they die with that?\" cried Susy, seizing hold of her grandmother's dress. \"O, stop a minute; is she going to die?\"  \"We hope not,\" said Mrs. Parlin, \"but she is so sick that we shall send a despatch for your mother. I want you to try and keep the house still, girls, and coax Horace to stay out of doors.\"  \"Keep the house still? I guess we will!\" said Grace. \"O grandma, will you forgive us for being so naughty yesterday?\"  \"Can you forgive us?\" said Susy. \"I tell you we feel"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24711"],["title","Little Prudy (#4)"],["body","about it, grandma!\"  Mrs. Parlin took off her spectacles to wipe them. \"My dear children,\" said she, gravely, \"I am ready to forgive you with all my heart; but I hope that before this you have asked pardon of your dear Father in heaven. That is the first thing, you know.\"  Susy stole off into the nursery, and threw herself on the lounge.  \"O God,\" sobbed she, \"I should think you would hate me, I have acted so bad! O, can you forgive me, and not take Prudy? I never will do so again! I didn't mean any thing when I said she was always round. O, _don't_ let her die and be put in the ground! Please don't, dear God! Seems to me I love her the best of any body. When we have any fuss, it's always me that's to blame.\"  Here Susy's prayer was drowned in sobs; but her heart felt a little lighter because she had told her kind Father just how she felt, and if it was best for Prudy to get well, she was sure he would save her.  Prudy's mother came in the cars that night, looking pale and troubled. Prudy did not know her.  \"Why don't you bring my own mamma?\" said she.  \"Look at me, darling,\" said her mother, \"here I am, right here. Mother won't leave her little Prudy again.\"  \"I ain't Prudy!\" screamed the child; \"Prudy's gone to heaven. God came and helped her up the steps.\"  One of the first things Mrs. Parlin did was to cut off her little daughter's beautiful curls, and lay them tenderly away in a drawer.  \"Ah, sister Madge,\" said she, \"you can't guess how it makes my heart ache to have my child take me for a stranger.\"  \"Perhaps she may know you to-morrow,\" said aunt Madge; though in her heart she had very little hope of the child.  But Prudy did not know any body \"to-morrow,\" nor the next day, nor the next. O, the long, weary time that they watched by her bed! The terrible disease seemed to be drinking up her life. Her cheeks looked as if fierce fires were hidden in them, and when she raved so wildly her eyes shone like flames.  A deep hush had fallen on the house. Grace and Susy would go and sit by the hour in their seat in the trees, and talk about dear little Prudy. Horace had the heartache, too, and asked every day,--  \"_Do_ you think she's going to die?\"  Nobody could answer him, and he had to wait, like all the rest.  But God did not mean that Prudy should die. At last, after many days, the fever died out like a fire when it has burned the wood all down to cinders. Then there was a pale little girl left, who looked as if a breath would blow her away like white ashes. I think a little baby, that tips over if you touch it, could not be weaker than Prudy was when she began to get well.  Ah, but it was so joyful to see her own sweet smile once more, though never so faint! And every low word she spoke now dropped from her lips like a note of music.  Her father and mother, and the whole family, were full of joy, and Grace and Susy went to their cosy seat in the trees to talk over the pretty things they were going to make for Prudy when she should be well enough to enjoy them.     CHAPTER VII  PRUDY'S PRESENT   \"Well, dear,\" said grandma, coming up stairs one morning, all out of breath, \"what did you call me for? What do you want, little one?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Prudy, \"but I guess _I shall_ want somethin' by and by.\"  \"There, there, darling,\" said grandma, \"don't cry.\"  \"No, I won't,\" said Prudy, trying to stop. \"I was a-talkin' to myself, and I said, 'I won't cry no more,' and then I cried. I don't like to stay in this country, grandma, 'thout I can have somethin' to eat!\"  \"Of all things,\" said grandma, \"I don't believe there's a little girl any where that has so many nice things as you do. See the jelly, and oranges, and lemons, and----\"  \"Well, if I wasn't sick, grandma, and you should ask me to eat some _smashed potatoes_, and some _pie_, I'd eat 'em,\" said Prudy, smiling through her tears.  \"Bless your little heart,\" cried grandma, kissing Prudy's pale cheek. \"Can't you think of something besides eating? What pretty thing shall I bring you to look at?\"  \"O, now I know what it is I want,\" replied Prudy, lifting her head from the pillow, \"I want to eat up the _old lady_!\"  Prudy was thinking of a little image aunt Madge had formed out of candy.  \"O, that's made to be looked at,\" said grandma. \"Let's see--where do you suppose your little Zip is nowadays? I guess he misses Prudy.\"  \"I don' know--I _ate_ a little dog once,\" said Prudy, wiping her eyes. \"He was made out of a doughnut. Once when I lived to Portland--to my mother's Portland--I used to eat things.\"  Poor grandma herself could hardly keep from crying to see Prudy so hungry.  \"Here is some nice arrow-root,\" said she. \"You may have it all if you like. You are a darling little girl not to tease for things you ought not to have.\"  \"I believe,\" she went on, looking at patient little Prudy, as she drained the bowl, \"I should like to give such a good child a pretty present.\"  \"O, dear me suz!\" screamed Prudy, \"I'm glad I didn't go to heaven yet.--Will it be a little wee doll that can live in a thimble?--made out of sugar?\"  \"Well,\" said grandma, \"I don't know, You may be thinking all day what you would like best. Not to _eat_, dear, but to _keep_, remember. Now I must go down stairs--but here come Grace and Susy, so you won't be lonesome.\"  It was pleasant to see how softly the little girls entered the room, and how the glad smiles came and went on Prudy's face when they tried to amuse her.  They were dressed in a very funny rig. Susy looked a great deal wiser than an owl, out of a pair of spectacles without any eyes, and a flaring cap. Grace had stuck some false hair on her head, and a bonnet that looked as if a wagon wheel had rolled over it.  \"Fine day, Mrs. Prudy,\" said Grace; \"how have you been, ma'am?\"  \"I've been a-thinkin',\" said Prudy, smiling, \"about my present.\"  \"You see we've come a-visiting, Mrs. Prudy,\" said Grace. \"Very sorry, ma'am, to see your doll looking so sick. Has she got the smallpox?\"  \"No, ma'am,\" answered Prudy, delighted, \"she's got the measles!\"  \"Deary me,\" said Susy, pushing back her cap, and trying to look frightened, \"how was she taken, ma'am?\"  \"Taken?\" repeated Prudy, \"taken _sick_! She's got it all over her.\"  \"Poor little creeter!\" cried Grace, rolling up her eyes, \"how she must suffer! I hope she's out of her head. Does she have her senses, ma'am?\"  \"Her _what_?\" said Prudy. \"O, yes'm, she's got 'em. I laid 'em up on the shelf, to keep 'em for her.\"  Here the two visitors turned away their heads to laugh. \"What do you s'pose my present will be?\" said Prudy, forgetting their play. \"Look here, Susy, I could take that vase now, and smash it right down on the floor, and break it, and grandma wouldn't scold--'cause I'm sick, you know.\"  \"But you wouldn't do it,\" said Grace. \"O, here come Mr. Allen and aunt Madge. Now, Mrs. Prudy, you're going to have a ride.\"  Mr. Allen laughed to see aunt Madge bundle Prudy so much, and said the child would be so heavy that he could not carry her in his arms; but I think he found her only too light after all.  Prudy almost forgot how hungry she was when she was seated in her little carriage and wheeled about the pleasant yard. She had an idea that the trees and the flowers in the garden were having good times, and the open windows of the house looked as if they were laughing. But she did not say much, and when aunt Madge asked her what made her so quiet, she said she was \"a-thinkin'.\" And the most of her small thoughts were about her present.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Allen, \"I'm going to hold you up so you can peep over into the pig-pen. There, do you see that little mite of a white piggy?\"  \"O, dear, dear, dear!\" cried Prudy, clapping her hands, \"what a cunning little piggy-wiggy! He looks nice enough to eat right up! I never did see such a darling! O, he winks his eyes--see him! He ain't dead, is he? Not a mite?\"  \"No, my little dear, he's alive enough, if that's all,\" said Mr. Allen.  \"O, my stars!\" said Prudy, sighing with delight. \"Don't you wish you had such a pretty pink nose, and such little bits of shiny eyes?\"  Mr. Allen laughed.  \"O, so white and nice!\" added Prudy. \"He hasn't got a speck of red cheeks, 'cept his nose and little toes. Mayn't he have one of my oranges? I never did see any thing look so much like a sugar pig.\"  It did Mr. Allen and aunt Madge a world of good to see the child so pleased.  \"Do you know,\" said she, eagerly, \"who that piggy b'longs to?\"  \"Why, to grandpa, I suppose.\"  \"O,\" said Prudy, very sadly, while the bright color died out of her cheeks at once, \"I didn't know but it b'longed to grandma.\"  \"Well, you little pet,\" said aunt Madge, laughing, \"what do you care who it _b'longs_ to? You can look at it all the same, can't you?\"  \"But,\" said Prudy, \"do you s'pose----\"  \"S'pose what?\"  \"Do you s'pose if grandpa thought I was a darlin'----\" Prudy could get no farther.  \"Of course he _knows_ you're a darling!\" said aunt Madge.  \"Do you s'pose when I don't tease for things to eat, and grandma says I may think what I want for a present, he'd be willing I should have--she should give me that--_piggy_?\"  \"O, what a Prudy!\" said aunt Madge, laughing till she cried. \"Isn't there something nicer you would like for a present? You'd better think again.\"  \"O, no, no,\" said Prudy, trembling with eagerness. \"If grandma should give me a house full of dolls and candy all rolled up, and every single present in the world, I'd rather have that piggy.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Mr. Allen, \"I guess the folks that wouldn't give their pigs away to Prudy don't live here. Let's go and see.\"  They went into the house to see grandpa. Of course he said Yes.  \"Of all the funny presents!\" said grandma;--but Prudy was happy, and that was enough.  Grandpa was very kind, but there was one thing he would not consent to--he would not let the pig come into the house. But as he said he would be sure to take good care of it, and give it sweet milk to drink, Prudy did not mind so much.  When she grew"]]]
