ELSIE SPICER EELLS         *       *       *       *       *     PREFACE   It is late afternoon in my Brazilian garden. The dazzling blue of sea and sky which characterises a tropical noonday has become subdued and already roseate tints are beginning to prepare the glory of the sunset hour. A lizard crawls lazily up the whitewashed wall. The song of the _sabiá_, that wonderful Brazilian thrush, sounds from the royal palm tree. The air is heavy with the perfume of the orange blossom. There is no long twilight in the tropics. Night will leap down suddenly upon my Brazilian garden from out of the glory of the sunset sky.  Theresa, the _ama_, stands before us on the terrace under the mango trees, and we, her _yáyázinhas_ and _yóyózinhos_, know that the story hour has come. Theresa, daughter of the mud huts under the palm trees, _ama_ in the _sobrado_ of the foreign _senhora_, is a royal queen of story land. For her the beasts break silence and talk like humans. For her all the magic wonders of her tales stand forth as living truth. Her lithe body sways backwards and forwards to the rhythm of her words as she unfolds her tales to us. She is a picture to remember as she stands under the mango trees on our terrace. Her spotless white \"_camiza_\" is decorated with beautiful pillow lace, her own handiwork. Her skirt of stiffly starched cotton is red and purple in colour. A crimson flowered folded shawl hangs over her right shoulder and great strings of beads ornament the ebony of her neck and arms. To sit at the feet of Theresa, the _ama_, is to enter the gate of story land.     CONTENTS          PREFACE  I.     HOW NIGHT CAME  II.    HOW THE RABBIT LOST HIS TAIL  III.

HOW THE BRAZILIAN BEETLES GOT THEIR GORGEOUS COATS     I  How Night Came   Years and years ago at the very beginning of time, when the world had just been made, there was no night. It was day all the time. No one had ever heard of sunrise or sunset, starlight or moonbeams. There were no night birds, nor night beasts, nor night flowers. There were no lengthening shadows, nor soft night air, heavy with perfume.  In those days the daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT, who dwelt in the depths of the seas, married one of the sons of the great earth race known as MAN. She left her home among the shades of the deep seas and came to dwell with her husband in the land of daylight. Her eyes grew weary of the bright sunlight and her beauty faded. Her husband watched her with sad eyes, but he did not know what to do to help her.  \"O, if night would only come,\" she moaned as she tossed about wearily on her couch. \"Here it is always day, but in my father's kingdom there are many shadows. O, for a little of the darkness of night!\"  Her husband listened to her moanings. \"What is night?\" he asked her. \"Tell me about it and perhaps I can get a little of it for you.\"  \"Night,\" said the daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT, \"is the name we give to the heavy shadows which darken my father's kingdom in the depths of the seas. I love the sunlight of your earth land, but I grow very weary of it. If we could have only a little of the darkness of my father's kingdom to rest our eyes part of the time.\"  Her husband at once called his three most faithful slaves. \"I am about to send you on a journey,\" he told them. \"You are to go to the kingdom of the GREAT SEA SERPENT who dwells in the depths of the seas and ask him to give you some of the darkness of night that his daughter may not die here amid the sunlight of our earth land.\"  The three slaves set forth for the kingdom of the GREAT SEA SERPENT. After a long dangerous journey they arrived at his home in the depths of the seas and asked him to give them some of the shadows of night to carry back to the earth land. The GREAT SEA SERPENT gave them a big bag full at once. It was securely fastened and the GREAT SEA SERPENT warned them not to open it until they were once more in the presence of his daughter, their mistress.  The three slaves started out, bearing the big bag full of night upon their heads. Soon they heard strange sounds within the bag. It was the sound of the voices of all the night beasts, all the night birds, and all the night insects. If you have ever heard the night chorus from the jungles on the banks of the rivers you will know how it sounded. The three slaves had never heard sounds like those in all their lives. They were terribly frightened.  \"Let us drop the bag full of night right here where we are and run away as fast as we can,\" said the first slave.  \"We shall perish. We shall perish, anyway, whatever we do,\" cried the second slave.  \"Whether we perish or not I am going to open the bag and see what makes all those terrible sounds,\" said the third slave.  Accordingly they laid the bag on the ground and opened it. Out rushed all the night beasts and all the night birds and all the night insects and out rushed the great black cloud of night. The slaves were more frightened than ever at the darkness and escaped to the jungle.  The daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT was waiting anxiously for the return of the slaves with the bag full of night. Ever since they had started out on their journey she had looked for their return, shading her eyes with her hand and gazing away off at the horizon, hoping with all her heart that they would hasten to bring the night. In that position she was standing under a royal palm tree, when the three slaves opened the bag and let night escape. \"Night comes. Night comes at last,\" she cried, as she saw the clouds of night upon the horizon. Then she closed her eyes and went to sleep there under the royal palm tree.  When she awoke she felt greatly refreshed. She was once more the happy princess who had left her father's kingdom in the depths of the great seas to come to the earth land. She was now ready to see the day again. She looked up at the bright star shining above the royal palm tree and said, \"O, bright beautiful star, henceforth you shall be called the morning star and you shall herald the approach of day. You shall reign queen of the sky at this hour.\"  Then she called all the birds about her and said to them, \"O, wonderful, sweet singing birds, henceforth I command you to sing your sweetest songs at this hour to herald the approach of day.\" The cock was standing by her side. \"You,\" she said to him, \"shall be appointed the watchman of the night. Your voice shall mark the watches of the night and shall warn the others that the _madrugada_ comes.\" To this very day in Brazil we call the early morning the _madrugada_. The cock announces its approach to the waiting birds. The birds sing their sweetest songs at that hour and the morning star reigns in the sky as queen of the _madrugada_.  When it was daylight again the three slaves crept home through the forests and jungles with their empty bag.  \"O, faithless slaves,\" said their master, \"why did you not obey the voice of the GREAT SEA SERPENT and open the bag only in the presence of his daughter, your mistress? Because of your disobedience I shall change you into monkeys. Henceforth you shall live in the trees. Your lips shall always bear the mark of the sealing wax which sealed the bag full of night.\"  To this very day one sees the mark upon the monkeys' lips, where they bit off the wax which sealed the bag; and in Brazil night leaps out quickly upon the earth just as it leapt quickly out of the bag in those days at the beginning of time. And all the night beasts and night birds and night insects give a sunset chorus in the jungles at nightfall.     II  How the Rabbit Lost His Tail   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, the rabbit had a long tail, but the cat had none. She looked with envious eyes at the one which the rabbit had. It was exactly the sort of a tail she longed to have.  The rabbit was always a thoughtless careless little beast. One day he went to sleep with his beautiful long tail hanging straight out behind him. Along came Mistress Puss carrying a sharp knife, and with one blow she cut off Mr. Rabbit's tail. Mistress Puss was very spry and she had the tail nearly sewed on to her own body before Mr. Rabbit saw what she was doing.  \"Don't you think it looks better on me than it did on you?\" asked Mistress Puss.  \"It surely is very becoming to you,\" replied the generous unselfish rabbit. \"It was a little too long for me anyway and I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you keep it if you will give me that sharp"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],["title","Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#1)"],["body","in exchange for it.\"  The cat gave Mr. Rabbit the knife and he started out into the deep forest with it. \"I've lost my tail but I've gained a knife,\" said he; \"I'll get a new tail or something else just as good.\"  Mr. Rabbit hopped along through the forest for a long time and at last he came to a little old man who was busily engaged in making baskets. He was making the baskets out of rushes and he was biting them off with his teeth. He looked up and spied Mr. Rabbit with the knife in his mouth.  \"O, please, Mr. Rabbit,\" said he, \"will you not be so kind as to let me borrow that sharp knife you are carrying? It is very hard work to bite the rushes off with my teeth.\"  Mr. Rabbit let him take the knife. He started to cut off the rushes with it, when _snap_ went the knife! It broke into halves.  \"O, dear! O, dear!\" cried Mr. Rabbit. \"What shall I do! What shall I do! You have broken my nice new knife.\"  The little old man said that he was very sorry and that he did not mean to do it.  Then Mr. Rabbit said, \"A broken knife is of no use to me but perhaps you can use it, even if it is broken. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you keep the knife if you will give me one of your baskets in exchange for it.\"  The little old man gave Mr. Rabbit a basket and he started on through the deep forest with it. \"I lost my tail but I gained a knife. I've lost my knife but I've gained a basket,\" said he. \"I'll get a new tail or something else just as good.\"  Mr. Rabbit hopped along through the deep forest for a long time until at last he came to a clearing. Here there was an old woman busily engaged in picking lettuce. When she had gathered it she put it into her apron. She looked up and spied Mr. Rabbit hopping along with his basket.  \"O, please, Mr. Rabbit,\" said she, \"will you not be so kind as to let me borrow that nice basket you are carrying?\"  Mr. Rabbit let her take the basket. She began to put her lettuce into it when out fell the bottom of the basket.  \"O, dear! O, dear!\" cried Mr. Rabbit. \"What shall I do! What shall I do! You have broken the bottom out of my nice new basket.\"  The old woman said that she was very sorry and that she did not mean to do it.  Then said Mr. Rabbit, \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you keep that broken basket if you will give me some of your lettuce.\"  The old woman gave Mr. Rabbit some lettuce and he hopped along with it, saying, \"I lost my tail but I gained a knife. I lost my knife but I gained a basket. I lost my basket but I gained some lettuce.\"  The rabbit was getting very hungry and how nice the lettuce smelled! He took a bite. It was just the very best thing he had ever tasted in all his life. \"I don't care if I did lose my tail,\" said he, \"I've found something I like very much better.\"  From that day to this no rabbit has ever had a tail. Neither has there ever been a rabbit who cared because he had no tail. From that time to this there has never been a rabbit who did not like lettuce to eat and who was not perfectly happy and contented if there was plenty of it.     III  How the Toad Got His Bruises   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, the toad had a smooth skin. In those days he was a great gad about. He never could be found in his own house. If any one had a party he was sure to go, no matter how far away from home it was held, or how long it took to get there.  One day the toad received an invitation to attend a party in the sky. \"You never can get to this party,\" said his friend, the armadillo. \"You know how slowly you travel here upon earth.\"  \"Wait and see whether or not I go to the party,\" said the toad.  Not far from the toad's house there lived a big black buzzard. No one liked the buzzard. He was very unpopular with all the birds and beasts. The toad hopped over to the buzzard's house. The buzzard was outside the door making music on his violin.  \"Good morning, Friend Buzzard,\" said the toad. \"Are you going to attend the party in the sky?\"  The buzzard replied that he was planning to go.  \"That is good,\" said the toad. \"May I have the pleasure of your company for the trip?\"  The buzzard was delighted to have the toad seek his company. It was a new experience.  \"I'll be charmed to go to the party with you,\" replied the buzzard. \"What time shall we start?\"  \"We'll start at four o'clock,\" said the toad. \"Come to my house and we'll go on from there. Be sure to bring your violin with you.\"  Promptly at four o'clock the buzzard arrived at the toad's house. He had his violin with him, of course, because the toad had asked him to bring it.  \"I'm not quite ready to go,\" the toad called out. \"Just leave your violin there by the door and step inside. It will take me only a minute to finish my toilet.\"  The buzzard laid his violin carefully outside the door and went inside the toad's house. The toad jumped through the window and hid himself inside the violin.  The buzzard waited and waited for the toad to get ready but he did not hear a word from the toad. Finally he got tired of waiting. He picked up his violin and started.  When he arrived at the party he was a trifle late but he explained how he had waited for the toad.  \"How foolish to wait a minute for the toad,\" said his hosts. \"How could the toad ever get to a party in the sky? We just asked him as a joke because he is such a great gad about. Lay down your violin and come to the feast.\"  The buzzard laid down his violin. As soon as there was no one looking, out hopped the toad. He was laughing from ear to ear. \"So they thought I would not come to the party! What a joke! How surprised they will be to see me here!\" he said.  There was nobody at the feast who was as gay as the toad. When the buzzard asked how he arrived he said: \"I'll tell you some other day.\" Then he went on eating and dancing.  The buzzard did not have a very good time at the party. He decided that he would go home early. He went away without saying good-bye to his hosts and without taking his violin with him.  At the end of the party the toad hopped inside the violin and waited and waited for the buzzard to take him home. Nobody picked up the violin and the toad began to be very much worried. He almost wished he had not come.  After a while the falcon noticed the violin. \"That violin belongs to the buzzard. He must have forgotten to take it home. I'll carry it back for him,\" he said.  The falcon flew towards earth with the violin. The toad shook about terribly inside of the violin. He got very tired. The falcon got tired, too.  \"I'm not going to carry this heavy old violin of the buzzard's another minute,\" said the falcon. \"I was foolish to offer to carry it in the first place. The buzzard is no friend of mine.\"  He let the violin fall. Down, down toward earth it fell.  \"O, little stones, O, little stones, get out of my way,\" called the toad as he fell. The little stones had deaf ears. They did not get out of the way.  When the toad crawled out of the wrecked violin he was so covered with bruises that he could hardly hop home.  The buzzard never knew what became of his violin or why the toad had lost his good looks. To this very day the toad shows his bruises. And he is entirely cured of being a gad about.     IV  How the Tiger Got His Stripes   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, so long ago that the tiger had no stripes upon his back and the rabbit still had his tail, there was a tiger who had a farm. The farm was very much overgrown with underbrush and the owner sought a workman to clear the ground for him to plant.  The tiger called all the beasts together and said to them when they had assembled, \"I need a good workman at once to clear my farm of the underbrush. To the one of you who will do this work I offer an ox in payment.\"  The monkey was the first one to step forward and apply for the position. The tiger tried him for a little while but he was not a good workman at all. He did not work steadily enough to accomplish anything. The tiger discharged him very soon and he did not pay him.  Then the tiger hired the goat to do the work. The goat worked faithfully enough but he did not have the brains to do the work well. He would clear a little of the farm in one place and then he would go away and work on another part of it. He never finished anything neatly. The tiger discharged him very soon without paying him.  Next the tiger tried the armadillo. The armadillo was very strong and he did the work well. The trouble with him was that he had such an appetite. There were a great many ants about the place and the armadillo could never pass by a sweet tender juicy ant without stopping to eat it. It was lunch time all day long with him. The tiger discharged him and sent him away without paying him anything.  At last the rabbit applied for the position. The tiger laughed at him and said, \"Why, little rabbit, you are too small to do the work. The monkey, the goat, and the armadillo have all failed to give satisfaction. Of course a little beast like you will fail too.\"  However, there were no other beasts who applied for the position so the tiger sent for the rabbit and told him that he would try him for a little while.  The rabbit worked faithfully and well, and soon he had cleared a large portion of the ground. The next day he worked just as well. The tiger thought that he had been very lucky to hire the rabbit. He got tired staying around to watch the rabbit work. The rabbit seemed to know just how to do the work anyway, without orders, so the tiger decided to go away on a hunting trip. He left his son to watch the rabbit.  After the tiger had gone away the rabbit said to the tiger's son, \"The ox which your father is going to give me is marked with a white spot on his left ear and another on his right side, isn't he?\"  \"O, no,\" replied the tiger's son. \"He is red all over with just a tiny white spot on his right ear.\"  The rabbit worked for a while longer and then he said, \"The ox which your father is going to give me is kept by the river, isn't "]]]
