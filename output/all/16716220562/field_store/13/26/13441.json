He was the same kind husband and father, the same diligent provider, and he sought no new companionship. Nevertheless, at every dawn he went upon the hill near his lodge; and, while the morning star hung like a jewel in the east, he sang the melody carrying the words,--       \"With the dawn I seek thee!\"  [Music: THE OLD MAN'S LOVE SONG.  _Omaha._  Harmonized by PROF.

At last a time came when his voice was no longer heard.  The tender cadences of his song, fraught with human hope and human feeling, still linger, and to-day awaken echoes across the barriers of time and race.     STORY OF THE WE-TO´_N_ SONG.   Many Indian tribes believed it possible for one person to affect another through the power of the will. This belief gave rise to peculiar customs and to a class of songs called, in the Omaha tongue, We´-to_n_, composed and sung by women for the sole purpose of exerting this power for the benefit of absent warriors.  Unless the village was attacked, women did not take active part in war. When the men went forth on a long journey to meet the enemy, the women remained at home, attending to domestic duties. Their thoughts, however, were with the absent ones; and, under the incentive of the belief in will power, they would gather in groups at the lodge of the Leader of the war party, and in the hearing of his family would sing a We´-to_n_ song, which should carry strength to the far-away warriors and help them to win the battle.  The words of these songs do not reveal the purpose for which they were sung, it being one of the peculiarities of the Indian never to expatiate upon that which to him is apparent. The gathering of the women at the lodge of the Leader of the war party, the united action in singing a song never used but for one purpose, made any explanatory words seem unnecessary. The distinctive mission of the song was to reach the absent man, who, far from home, was suffering hardship and facing danger. Upon him the singers fixed their thoughts, and to him sent strength by their power of will. The words always referred to the difficulties that confronted the warrior, and promised him success and victory. They were not addressed to any visible audience.  The We´-to_n_ song here given was composed by a Dakota woman.         *       *       *       *       *  Many years ago a large party of warriors were out on a dangerous expedition for the purpose of recapturing some property stolen by an implacable enemy. There seemed little hope for their safe return, and great apprehension was felt in many a tent. One evening, as the moon rose, round and clear, over the wide rolling prairie, a group of women moved in single file to the lodge of the Leader of the war party, upon whom rested the responsibility of the expedition.  The tent stood dark against the evening sky, revealing the anxiety within, which had let the blazing fire die to smouldering embers. At the door the women paused, and across the stillness of the night they sent forth this song, fraught with their united determination to compel victory for the absent men.  \"All the tribes shall hear of you,\" they sang. \"Put forth your strength. Truly this shall come to pass.\"  Out of the silent tent emerged the Leader's wife, bearing in her arms gifts in acknowledgment of sympathy given and of succour sent.         *       *       *       *       *  And, as the women sang, \"truly it came to pass.\" In due time the men returned triumphant, after many hair-breadth escapes, with not one of their number missing.

There is no dalliance in this Pawnee love-song. It has no words, but the music tells the story,--the insistent call of the lover to the maiden to fly with him, the wide sweep of the prairie, the race for cover, and the dauntless daring that won the girl from rival pursuers.  [Music: LOVE SONG.  _Pawnee._  Transcribed by E.S. TRACY.]     A WARRIOR'S STORY AND SONG.   The Mi´-ka-thi songs are sung by warriors as they leave the village on their way to battle. They all originate in some personal experience, and both story and song are handed down with care and precision.         *       *       *       *       *  A Ponka war party once camped near the enemy. The usual sentinels had been stationed, with special injunctions to be vigilant, that the camp might not be discovered and surprised. Among those assigned to duty as sentinel that night was a young man ambitious to win preferment and honour in the tribe. His career was yet all to make, and he was on the alert for opportunity to distinguish himself.  There was no moon, and only the keenest eye could discern any distant object in the darkness. The silence was unbroken save by the occasional cry of the wolf, the creaking of a cricket, or the rustle of a passing breeze.  The young man, intently on the watch, scanned the country from right to left, searching through the dimness for any moving thing; but all was motionless beneath, while overhead the stars moved slowly through the heavens, as the night wore on.  At a little distance from the watcher was a clump of trees. Upon this he kept a steady eye, only turning now and then to sweep the horizon. Once, as his eye returned to the trees, he beheld a shadow unnoticed before. It moved; and, without waiting to see more, he sped noiselessly as an arrow to wake the Leader and report that he had seen the enemy creeping toward the sleeping warriors.  The Leader, an old and experienced man, made no reply, but rose quickly and silently, and taking his bow in his hand, motioned the sentinel to lead the way.  With rapid, muffled steps, they reached the place where the young man had stood when he had seen the moving shadow. The Leader looked intently in the indicated direction, bent his ear to the ground and listened, then rose and looked again.  A faint gleam of light in the east gave sign of the approach of day, as the Leader stepped cautiously toward the group of trees, followed by the young warrior, whose heart beat high with hope that the time had at last come for him to show his valour and win a war honour. A greyish hue was spreading over the land as they neared the place. The young man's eyes sought among the trees the hidden enemy, but the Leader paused and addressed the youth:--  \"Was it here that you saw the enemy?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Look on the ground and tell me what you see?\"  Surprised at the words, yet obedient, he turned his scrutiny from the trees to the grass upon which they stood, and detected there the traces of the feet of an animal. As he gazed silently at the tracks, absorbed in his thoughts, the dawn came slowly on. The Leader was the first to speak:--  \"I had seen a wolf pass here when I was going the rounds of the camp, and when you reported to me I had but just returned to my bed. I arose and came with you, to be quite sure that we had both looked in the same direction and had seen the same thing. A warrior must learn to distinguish a man from a wolf, even in the darkness of midnight.\"  The youth heard the words in silence. At last he said, \"A warrior has much to learn; and it is well if, while he learns, he brings no trouble to his friends.\" Then, standing beside the veteran Leader, in the light of the coming day, he suddenly broke into song, voicing there on the instant the feeling born of his night's experience.  This story and song he gave to others, that it might be as a voice of warning to young and eager warriors, and help them to guard against a misadventure like his own.  Although the young man in after years became noted in the tribe for his prudence and valour, this story and song of his youth have survived the memory of his later deeds.  The words give the pith of the adventure: \"I did not report aright when I went to the Leader and bade him arise. It was a wolf that was moving.\"  The spirited music breathes the impatient eagerness of youth. The haste and insistence of the young warrior are heard in the phrase where he addresses the \"Nu-don hon-ga,\" or Leader. The song is a great favourite among the young men of several Indian tribes in our country.  [Music: MI-KA-THI.

This little song of springtime was noted from the singing of a Tigua girl of the pueblo of Isleta, N.M., by my honoured and lamented friend and co-worker, Professor John Comfort Fillmore. It tells the story of the semi-arid region where it was born.       Rain, people, rain!      The rain is all around us.      It is going to come pouring down,      And the summer will be fair to see,      The mocking-bird has said so.  [Music: MOCKING BIRD SONG.  _Tigua._  Transcribed and harmonized by PROF.

There are few more pathetic sights than that of an Indian ghost dance,--pathetic in itself, not to consider the gloomy background of fear inspired by it in the minds of so many of our own race who have so widely misunderstood its meaning. The ceremony is but an appeal to the unseen world to come near and to comfort those who have been overtaken in the land of their fathers by conditions both strange and incomprehensible.  The ghost or spirit dance is a modified survival of several ancient ceremonies, blended into one and touched here and there with ideas borrowed from our own race.  In the hypnotic vision which follows the monotonous dance, the landscape of his former days, untouched by the white man, appears to the \"controlled\" Indian: the streams wander through unbroken prairie; no roadways, no fields of wheat, intrude upon the broad stretches of native grasses; the vanished herds of buffalo come back to their grazing-grounds; the deer and the antelope, the wolf and the bear, are again in the land; and the eagles look down on the Indian villages, where are to be seen the faces of old friends returned from the spirit realm. These are the scenes which come to the homesick Indian, who is stranded in his native land, his ears filled with foreign sounds, his old activities gone, and his hands unskilled and unable to take up new ones.  The ghost dance is the cry of a forsaken people, forsaken by the gods in which they once trusted,--a people bewildered by the complexity of the new path they must follow, misunderstood by and misunderstanding the race with whom they are forced to live. In this brief ceremony of the ghost dance the Indians seek to close their eyes to an unwelcome reality, and to live in the fanciful vision of an irrecoverable past.         *       *       *       *       *  This song was given me by a ghost dancer, a leader in the Arapaho tribe. Before he sang, he explained to me the ceremony, its peaceful character, and, all unconsciously, made apparent its expression of a pathetic longing for a life that can never return. Standing before the graphophone, he offered an earnest prayer, then, with his companions, sang this song.  The simple pathos of the words cannot be reproduced in English. They carry a meaning beneath their literal sense that appeals like the cry of a child.       Father, have pity upon me!      I am weeping from hunger (of the spirit):      There is nothing here to satisfy me!  The music tells the story of the cry. Its cadences are antiphonal, as between the two worlds.  [Music: GHOST DANCE SONG.  _Arapaho._]     SACRED SONGS OF PEACE.   When the white race first visited the Indians in the Mississippi valley, they found among them a ceremony common to a large number of tribes; and it was observed that, whenever the symbolic objects peculiar to this ceremony were displayed, they were treated with profound respect.  These sacred objects were two perforated sticks, like pipe stems, one painted blue to represent the sky, and the other green to typify the earth; and among their bright-coloured decorations were the plumages of particular birds and wing-like pendants of eagle feathers. They symbolised the heavens and the earth and the mysterious power that permeates all nature. In their presence the Indians were taught that they should care for their children, think of the future welfare of the people, put aside personal grievances, repress anger and warlike emotions, and be like kindred, at peace with one another. Different names were given to these peculiar objects by the different tribes; and they were classed by our early travellers with the \"calumets,\" or pipes of peace, although they were not pipes, for they had no bowl and could not be smoked.  It was due to the presence of one of these so-called \"calumets\" in Marquette's frail canoe that made possible his peaceful descent of the Mississippi River on his voyage of discovery. He writes that the \"calumet is the most mysterious thing in the world. The sceptres of our kings are not so much respected; ... for one with this calumet may venture among his enemies, and in the hottest battles they lay down their arms before this sacred pipe.\"  The \"calumet\" ceremony has, therefore, an historic interest for us, apart from its revelation of the religious beliefs and social ideals of the Indian. To explain the symbolism, the teachings, and the observances which make up this complex rite would fill a volume; but, that something of the dignity and beauty of the thoughts expressed in it may be known, two of its numerous songs are here given.  To understand the significance of these songs, it should be known that two distinct groups or parties were indispensable to the performance of the ceremony; namely, they who brought the \"calumets\" and they who received them. As it was imperative that there should be no blood relationship between these two parties, they always belonged to different tribes or to two distinct kinship groups within the tribe. The party bringing the \"calumets\" was called \"the father,\" while those receiving them were \"the children.\" These terms refer to the tie about to be formed between the two unrelated parties by means of this sacred ceremony. This tie was esteemed more honourable and binding than the natural bond of father and son.  The ceremony generally took place in a circular dwelling known as an \"earth lodge.\" The occasion drew together a large concourse of people,--men, women, and children; and the gay costumes, the glinting of ornaments, the picturesque groups, and the happy, smiling faces of old and young made a scene full of colour and motion. Many times I have witnessed this ceremony and joined in its beautiful chorals, led by the bearers, who swayed the \"calumets\" to the rhythm of the song, wafting over the heads of the people the blessing of peace.  The following choral was sung immediately after the \"calumets\" had been ceremonially taken from their resting-place, with movements that simulated the eagle rising from its nest. The bearers then faced the people, seated on the ground against the wall of the lodge, and with slow rhythmic steps moved around the circle, waving the \"calumets\" over the heads of the multitude. As the \"calumets\" passed slowly by, the people took up the choral, until at last the great lodge resounded with its majestic cadences. The leaping flames from the central fire lit up the faces of the hundreds of men and women; while the swaying feathers of the \"calumets\" cast great wing-like shadows on the glistening roof, and seemed to make real the symbolic presence of the mighty eagle himself, circling over the people as he sped on his mission, bearing the benediction of good will among men.  Once, at the close of this song, an old Indian turned to me and said, \"The 'calumets' are of God.\"  The words of this choral refer to the blessing of peace given to \"the fathers\" in ancient days, and now brought by the symbolic \"calumets\" to \"the children.\"       Down through the ages vast,      On wings strong and true,      From great Wa-ko_n_´-da comes      Good will unto you,--      Peace, that shall here remain.  [Music: CHORAL.  _Omaha._  Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.  Dha ke-de hia u-dha ho-dha ke-de ho-dha dha ke-de ha dhe he hia dha ke-de hia dha ke-de ha dhe he.]  After the bearers, or \"the fathers,\" had ceremonially borne the \"calumets\" four times around the lodge, singing as they went and waving the blessing of peace and fellowship over the heads of \"the children,\" they paused as they reached a consecrated place at the back of the lodge, facing the entrance to the east. Here the ground had been specially prepared, and a wildcat skin spread upon it for the reception of the \"calumets.\" Over this skin, which had its symbolic meaning, the bearers waved the \"calumets,\" imitating the movements of the eagle, sweeping lower and lower, rising and circling again, and then dropping lightly upon its nest.  The song is one of those sung to accompany the movements of the \"calumets\" as they are thus lowered to rest. The words refer to the search of \"the fathers\" for \"the children,\" to bring them peace, as the eagle soars abroad and returns to its nest.       Far above the earth he soars,      Circling the clear sky,      Flying over forests dim,      Peering in shadows,      Seeking far and wide his child,      To give him peace.

The three following songs have a common motive, and are parts of one ceremonial action; but the motive is treated differently in each song, so as to conform to the movements of the ceremony.[11] An unconscious art is here shown, which is interesting as a bit of musical archæology. During the \"calumet\" ceremony among the Pawnees, if a child cried and would not be comforted, its parents were permitted to appeal to the \"calumets\" for help.  [Footnote 11: These songs were never before noted, and have hitherto been sealed from the knowledge of the white race. They were given and explained by a priest of the rite, through Mr. James R. Murie.]  The fan-shaped pendant of one of these \"calumets\" was made of the feathers of the golden eagle. This bird in the ceremony was called Kawas, and symbolised the peaceful and conserving power, the giver and preserver of life, the parent of all things. It was to the priestly bearer of this particular \"calumet\" that the parents appealed. On receiving the appeal, the priest and his assistants arose, and, standing beside \"the holy"]]]
