Where is she?”  “In bed, I presume,” said Mrs. Harrington acidulously. “She might have remembered that I was very much upset last night by that horrible thunder, and have risen earlier and attended to the children.”  A look of intense disgust came over her husband's face.  “Myra, the girl was done-up, dead beat! Won't you go and see if she is able to get up?”  Mrs. Harrington rose stiffly. “Oh, certainly, if you wish it. But I think it is a great mistake. She really ought to have considered the children, and----”  The head stockman's wife met her at the door, and looking past her mistress, spoke to Harrington in terrified tones-----  “Miss Alleyne is dead, sir!”  Harrington sprang from his chair. “Dead, Mrs. Banks!”  “Yes, sir. I was only just in time. She on'y sez, 'Tell Mr. Harrington that I am so glad that everythink will be all right now.' An' then she smiled, sir, and sez as I was to kiss Master Harry and Miss Mabel for her, as she was agoin'. And then she sez, 'Isn't God good to send the rain, Mrs. Banks? Everything will be all right now for poor Mr. Harrington--rain and gold.' Then she just laid quiet for a minute, an' when I looked at her face again, I saw she was dead.”  *****  A year later, Jack Harrington, again one of the wealthiest cattle men in North Queensland, and the owner of one of the richest gold mines in the colony, was riding home to his station. Behind him he heard the clatter and clash of the twenty-stamper battery that on the “Canton Ridge” was pounding him in so many thousands of pounds a month; before him lay the sweeping grassy downs and thickly timbered creeks of a now smiling country. His wife and children had long before returned to the cooler South, and in his heart was a great loneliness. Not, perhaps, for them, but because of the memory of the girl whose prayer to the Almighty had been answered, and who was resting on the bank of the Gilbert under the shade of a big Leichhardt tree."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25061"],["title","The Penal Cluster (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Their combined thought-force hit him like a thunderbolt.]                THE             PENAL            CLUSTER        By IVAR JORGENSEN    _Tomorrow's technocracy will  produce more and more things  for better living. It will  produce other things, also;  among them, criminals too  despicable to live on this  earth. Too abominable to  breathe our free air._   The clipped British voice said, in David Houston's ear, _I'm quite sure he's one. He's cashing a check for a thousand pounds. Keep him under surveillance._  Houston didn't look up immediately. He simply stood there in the lobby of the big London bank, filling out a deposit slip at one of the long, high desks. When he had finished, he picked up the slip and headed towards the teller's cage.  Ahead of him, standing at the window, was a tall, impeccably dressed, aristocratic-looking man with graying hair.  \"The man in the tweeds?\" Houston whispered. His voice was so low that it was inaudible a foot away, and his lips scarcely moved. But the sensitive microphone in his collar picked up the voice and relayed it to the man behind the teller's wicket.  _That's him_, said the tiny speaker hidden in Houston's ear. _The fine-looking chap in the tweeds and bowler._  \"Got him,\" whispered Houston.         *       *       *       *       *  He didn't go anywhere near the man in the bowler and tweeds; instead, he went to a window several feet away.  \"Deposit,\" he said, handing the slip to the man on the other side of the partition. While the teller went through the motions of putting the deposit through the robot accounting machine, David Houston kept his ears open.  \"How did you want the thousand, sir?\" asked the teller in the next wicket.  \"Ten pound notes, if you please,\" said the graying man. \"I think a hundred notes will go into my brief case easily enough.\" He chuckled, as though he'd made a clever witticism.  \"Yes, sir,\" said the clerk, smiling.  Houston whispered into his microphone again. \"Who is the guy?\"  On the other side of the partition, George Meredith, a small, unimposing-looking man, sat at a desk marked: MR. MEREDITH--ACCOUNTING DEPT. He looked as though he were paying no attention whatever to anything going on at the various windows, but he, too, had a microphone at his throat and a hidden pickup in his ear.  At Houston's question, he whispered: \"That's Sir Lewis Huntley. The check's good, of course. Poor fellow.\"  \"Yeah,\" whispered Houston, \"if he is what we think he is.\"  \"I'm fairly certain,\" Meredith replied. \"Sir Lewis isn't the type of fellow to draw that much in cash. At the present rate of exchange, that's worth three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars American. Sir Lewis might carry a hundred pounds as pocket-money, but never a thousand.\"  Houston and Meredith were a good thirty feet from each other, and neither looked at the other. Unless a bystander had equipment to tune in on the special scrambled wavelength they were using, that bystander would never know they were holding a conversation.  \"... nine-fifty, nine-sixty, nine-seventy, nine-eighty, nine-ninety, a thousand pounds,\" said the clerk who was taking care of Sir Lewis's check. \"Would you count that to make sure, sir?\"  \"Certainly. Ten, twenty, thirty, ...\"  While the baronet was double-checking the amount, David Houston glanced at him. Sir Lewis looked perfectly calm and unhurried, as though he were doing something perfectly legal--which, in a way, he was. And, in another way, he most definitely was not, if George Meredith's suspicions were correct.  \"Your receipt, sir.\" It was the teller at Houston's own window.  Houston took the receipt, thanked the teller, and walked toward the broad front doors of the bank.  \"George,\" he whispered into the throat mike, \"has Sir Lewis noticed me?\"  \"Hasn't so much as looked at you,\" Meredith answered. \"Good hunting.\"  \"Thanks.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As Houston stepped outside the bank, he casually dropped one hand into a coat pocket and turned a small knob on his radio control box. \"Houston to HQ,\" he whispered.  \"London HQ; what is it, Houston?\" asked the earpiece.  \"Leadenhall Street Post. Meredith thinks he's spotted one. Sir Lewis Huntley.\"  \"Righto. We've got men in that part of the city now. We'll have a network posted within five minutes. Can you hold onto him that long?\"  Houston looked around. Leadenhall Street was full of people, and the visibility was low. \"I'll have to tail him pretty closely,\" Houston said. \"Your damned English fogs don't give a man much chance to see anything.\"  There was a chuckle from the earphone. \"Cheer up, Yank; you should have seen it back before 1968. When atomic power replaced coal and oil, our fogs became a devil of a lot cleaner.\"  The voice was quite clear; at the London headquarters of the UN Psychodeviant Police, there was no need to wear a throat mike, which had a tendency to make the voice sound muffled in spite of the Statistical Information-Bit Samplers which were supposed to clarify the speech coming through them.  \"What do you know about 1968?\" Houston asked sardonically. \"Your mother was still pushing you around in a baby-carriage then.\"  \"In a pram,\" corrected the Headquarters operator. \"That is true, but my dear Aunt Jennifer told me all about it. She was--\"  \"The hell with your Aunt Jennifer,\" Houston interrupted suddenly. \"Here comes Sir Lewis. Get me cover--fast!\"  \"Right. Keep us posted.\"  Sir Lewis Huntley stepped out of the broad door of the bank and turned left. He took a couple of steps and stopped. He didn't look around; he simply took a cigarette out of a silver case, put it in his mouth, and lit it. The glow of the lighter shone yellowly on the brass plate near the door which said: _An Affiliate of Westminster Bank, Ltd._  Sir Lewis snapped the light out, drew on the cigarette, and strode on down the street, swinging a blue plastex brief case which contained a thousand pounds in United Nations Bank of England notes.  Houston decided the baronet had not been looking for a tail; he wished he could probe the man's mind to make sure, but he knew that would be fatal. He'd have to play the game and hope for the best.  \"He's heading east,\" Houston whispered. \"Doesn't look as if he's going to get a cab.\"  \"Check,\" said the earphone.  Sir Lewis seemed in no great hurry, but he walked briskly, as though he had a definite destination in mind.  After a little way, he crossed to the south side of Leadenhall Street and kept going east. Houston stayed far enough behind to be above suspicion, but not so far that he ran a chance of losing his man.  \"He's turning south on Fenchurch,\" Houston said a little later. \"I wonder where he's going.\"  \"Keep after him,\" said Headquarters. \"Our net men haven't spotted either of you yet. They can hardly see across the street in this damned fog.\"  Houston kept going.  \"What the hell?\" he whispered a few minutes later. \"He's still following Fenchurch Street! He's doubling back!\"  Leadenhall Street, the banking center of the City of London, runs almost due east-and-west; Fenchurch Street makes a forty-five degree angle with it at the western end, running southwest for a bit and then curving toward the west, toward Lombard.  \"Houston,\" said HQ, \"touch your left ear.\"  Houston obediently reached up and scratched his left ear.  \"Okay,\" said HQ. \"Bogart's spotted you, but he hasn't spotted Sir Lewis. Bogart's across the street.\"  \"He can't miss Sir Lewis,\" whispered Houston. \"Conservatively dressed--matching coat and trousers of orange nylon tweed--royal blue half-brim bowler--carrying a blue brief case.\"  There was a pause, then: \"Yeah. Bogart's spotted him, and so has MacGruder. Mac's on your side, a few yards ahead.\"  \"Check. How about the rest of the net?\"  \"Coming, coming. Be patient, old man.\"  \"I _am_ patient,\" growled Houston. _I have to be_, he thought to himself, _otherwise I'd never stay alive_.  \"We've got him bracketed now,\" HQ said. \"If we lose him now, he's a magician.\"  Sir Lewis walked on, seemingly oblivious to the group of men who had surrounded him. He came to the end of Fenchurch Street and looked to his left, towards London Bridge. Then he glanced to his right.  \"I think he's looking for a cab,\" Houston whispered.  \"That's what MacGruder says,\" came the reply. \"We've got Arthmore in a cab behind you; he'll pick you up. MacGruder will get another cab, and we have a private car for Bogart.\"  Sir Lewis flagged a cab, climbed in, and gave an address to the driver. Houston didn't hear it, but MacGruder, a heavy-set, short, balding man, was standing near enough to get the instructions Sir Lewis had given to the driver.         *       *       *       *       *  A cab pulled up to the curb near Houston, and he got in.  Arthmore, the driver, was a thin, tall, hawknosed individual who could have played Sherlock Holmes on TV. Once he got into character for a part, he never got out of it unless absolutely necessary. Right now, he was a Cockney cab-driver, and he would play the part to the hilt.  \"Where to, guv'nor?\" he asked innocently.  \"Buckingham Palace,\" said Houston. \"I've got a poker appointment with Prince Charles.\"  \"Blimey, guv'nor,\" said Arthmore. \"You _are_ movin' in 'igh circles! 'Ow's 'Er Majesty these days?\"  The turboelectric motor hummed, and the cab shot off into traffic. \"According to the report I get on the blinkin' wireless,\" he continued, \"a chap named MacGruder claims that the eminent Sir Lewis 'Untley is 'eaded for Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews.\"  \"One of these days,\" said Houston, \"all those _H_'s you drop is going to bounce back and hit you in the face.\"  \"Beg pardon, Mr. Yewston?\" Arthmore asked blankly.  Houston grinned. \"Nothing, cabbie; it's just that you remind me of a cultured, intelligent fellow named Jack Arthmore. The only difference is that Jack speaks the Queen's English.\"  \"Crikey!\" said Arthmore. \"Wot a coincidence!\" He paused, then: \"The Queen's English, you say? She _'as_ to "]]]
