He will be, like all poets, one who appreciates experiences or finds things good, and he will faithfully reproduce the values which he discovers. But he must _justify himself in view of the fundamental nature of the universe_. The values which he apprehends must be harmonious, and so far above the plurality of goods as to transcend and unify them. The philosopher-poet will find reality as a whole to be something that accredits the order of values in his inner life. He will not only find certain things to be most worthy objects of action or contemplation, but he will see why they are worthy, because he will have construed the judgment of the universe in their favor.  In this general sense, Omar Khayyam is a philosopher-poet. To be sure his universe is quite the opposite of that which most poets conceive, and is perhaps profoundly antagonistic to the very spirit of poetry; but it is none the less true that the joys to which Omar invites us are such as his universe prescribes for human life.       \"Some for the Glories of This World; and some       Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come;       Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,       Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum.\"  Herein is both poetry and philosophy, albeit but a poor brand of each. We are invited to occupy ourselves only with spiritual cash, because the universe is spiritually insolvent. The immediately gratifying feelings are the only feelings that the world can guarantee. Omar Khayyam is a philosopher-poet, because his immediate delight in \"youth's sweet-scented manuscript\" is part of a consciousness that vaguely sees, though it cannot grasp, \"this sorry scheme of things entire.\"       \"Drink for you know not whence you come, nor why;       Drink for you know not why you go, nor where.\"  [Sidenote: Wordsworth.]  § 12. But the poet in his world-view ordinarily sees other than darkness. The same innate spiritual enterprise that sustains religious faith leads the poet more often to find the universe positively congenial to his ideals, and to ideals in general. He interprets human experience in the light of the spirituality of all the world. It is to Wordsworth that we of the present age are chiefly indebted for such imagery, and it will profit us to consider somewhat carefully the philosophical quality of his poetry.  Walter Pater, in introducing his appreciation of Wordsworth, writes that \"an intimate consciousness of the expression of natural things, which weighs, listens, penetrates, where the earlier mind passed roughly by, is a large element in the complexion of modern poetry.\" We recognize at once the truth of this characterization as applied to Wordsworth. But there is something more distinguished about this poet's sensibility even than its extreme fineness and delicacy; a quality that is suggested, though not made explicit, by Shelley's allusion to Wordsworth's experience as \"a sort of thought in sense.\" Nature possessed for him not merely enjoyable and describable characters of great variety and minuteness, but an immediately apprehended unity and meaning. It would be a great mistake to construe this meaning in sense as analogous to the crude symbolism of the educator Froebel, to whom, as he said, \"the world of crystals proclaimed, in distinct and univocal terms, the laws of human life.\" Wordsworth did not attach ideas to sense, but regarded sense itself as a communication of truth. We readily call to mind his unique capacity for apprehending the characteristic flavor of a certain place in a certain moment of time, the individuality of a situation. Now in such moments he felt that he was receiving intelligences, none the less direct and significant for their inarticulate form. Like the boy on Windermere, whom he himself describes,                            \"while he hung      Loitering, a gentle shock of mild surprise      Has carried far into his heart the voice      Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene      Would enter unawares into his mind,      With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,      Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received      Into the bosom of the steady lake.\"  For our purpose it is essential that we should recognize in this appreciation of nature, expressed in almost every poem that Wordsworth wrote, a consciousness respecting the fundamental nature of the world. Conversation, as we know, denotes an interchange of commensurable meanings. Whatever the code may be, whether words or the most subtle form of suggestion, communication is impossible without community of nature. Hence, in believing himself to be holding converse with the so-called physical world, Wordsworth conceives that world as fundamentally like himself. He finds the most profound thing in all the world to be the universal spiritual life. In nature this life manifests itself most directly, clothed in its own proper dignity and peace. But it may be discovered in the humanity that is most close to nature, in the avocations of plain and simple people, and the unsophisticated delights of children; and, with the perspective of contemplation, even \"among the multitudes of that huge city.\"  So Wordsworth is rendering a true account of his own experience of reality when, as in \"The Prelude,\" he says unequivocally:       \"A gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,       And in the heart of man; invisibly       It comes to works of unreproved delight,       And tendency benign; directing those       Who care not, know not, think not, what they do.\"  Wordsworth is not a philosopher-poet because by searching his pages we can find an explicit philosophical creed such as this, but because all the joys of which his poet-soul compels him to sing have their peculiar note, and compose their peculiar harmony, by virtue of such an indwelling consciousness. Here is one who is a philosopher in and through his poetry. He is a philosopher in so far as the detail of his appreciation finds fundamental justification in a world-view. From the immanence of \"the universal heart\" there follows, not through any mediate reasoning, but by the immediate experience of its propriety, a conception of that which is of supreme worth in life. The highest and best of which life is capable is contemplation, or the consciousness of the universal indwelling of God. Of those who fail to live thus fittingly in the midst of the divine life, Walter Pater speaks for Wordsworth as follows:       \"To higher or lower ends they move too often with something of      a sad countenance, with hurried and ignoble gait, becoming,      unconsciously, something like thorns, in their anxiety to bear      grapes; it being possible for people, in the pursuit of even      great ends, to become themselves thin and impoverished in      spirit and temper, thus diminishing the sum of perfection in      the world at its very sources.\"[42:3]  The quiet and worshipful spirit, won by the cultivation of the emotions appropriate to the presence of nature and society, is the mark of the completest life and the most acceptable service. Thus for Wordsworth the meaning of life is inseparable from the meaning of the universe. In apprehending that which is good and beautiful in human experience, he was attended by a vision of the totality of things. Herein he has had to do, if not with the form, at any rate with the very substance of philosophy.  [Sidenote: Dante.]  § 13. Unquestionably the supreme philosopher-poet is Dante. He is not only philosophical in the temper of his mind, but his greatest poem is the incarnation of a definite system of philosophy, the most definite that the world has seen. That conception of the world which in the thirteenth century found argumentative and orderly expression in the \"Summa Theologiæ\" of Thomas of Aquino, and constituted the faith of the church, is visualized by Dante, and made the basis of an interpretation of life.  The \"Divina Commedia\" deals with all the heavens to the Empyrean itself, and with all spiritual life to the very presence of God. It derives its imagery from the cosmology of the day, its dramatic motive from the Christian and Greek conceptions of God and his dealings with the world. Sin is punished because of the justice of God; knowledge, virtue, and faith lead, through God's grace and mercy manifested in Christ, to a perpetual union with Him. Hell, purgatory, and paradise give place and setting to the events of the drama. But the deeper meaning of the poem is allegorical. In a letter quoted by Lowell, Dante writes:       \"The literal subject of the whole work is the state of the      soul after death, simply considered. But if the work be taken      allegorically the subject is man, as by merit or demerit,      through freedom of the will, he renders himself liable to the      reward or punishment of justice.\"[43:4]  In other words, the inner and essential meaning of the poem has to do not with external retribution, but with character, and the laws which determine its own proper ruin or perfection. The punishments described in the \"Inferno\" are accounts of the state of guilt itself, implications of the will that has chosen the part of brutishness. Sin itself is damnable and deadening, but the knowledge that the soul that sinneth shall die is the first way of emancipation from sin. The guidance of Virgil through hell and purgatory signifies the knowledge of good and evil, or moral insight, as the guide of man through this life of struggle and progress. The earthly paradise, at the close of the \"Purgatorio,\" represents the highest state to which human character can attain when choice is determined by ordinary experience, intelligence, and understanding. Here man stands alone, endowed with an enlightened conscience. Here are uttered the last words of Virgil to Dante, the explorer of the spiritual country:       \"Expect no more or word or sign from me. Free, upright, and      sane is thine own free will, and it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25110"],["title","The Approach to Philosophy (#8)"],["body","be wrong not to act      according to its pleasure; wherefore thee over thyself I crown      and mitre.\"[44:5]  But moral self-reliance is not the last word. As Beatrice, the image of tenderness and holiness, comes to Dante in the earthly paradise, and leads him from the summit of purgatory into the heaven of heavens, and even to the eternal light; so there is added to the mere human, intellectual, and moral resources of the soul, the sustaining power of the divine grace, the illuminating power of divine truth, and the transforming power of divine love. Through the aid of this higher wisdom, the journey of life becomes the way to God. Thus the allegorical truth of the \"Divina Commedia\" is not merely an analysis of the moral nature of man, but the revelation of a universal spiritual order, manifesting itself in the moral evolution of the individual, and above all in his ultimate community with the eternal goodness.       \"Thou shouldst not, if I deem aright, wonder more at thy      ascent, than at a stream if from a high mountain it descends      to the base. A marvel it would be in thee, if, deprived of      hindrance, thou hadst sat below, even as quiet by living fire      in earth would be.\"[45:6]  Such, in brief, is Dante's world-view, so suggestive of the freer idealistic conceptions of later thought as to justify a recent characterization of him as one who, \"accepting without a shadow of a doubt or hesitation all the constitutive ideas of mediæval thought and life, grasped them so firmly and gave them such luminous expression that the spirit in them broke away from the form.\"[46:7]  But it must be added, as in the case of Wordsworth, that Dante is a philosopher-poet not because St. Thomas Aquinas appears and speaks with authority in the Thirteenth Canto of the \"Paradiso,\" nor even because a philosophical doctrine can be consistently formulated from his writings, but because his consciousness of life is informed with a sense of its universal bearings. There is a famous passage in the Twenty-second Canto of the \"Paradiso,\" in which Dante describes himself as looking down upon the earth from the starry heaven.       \"'Thou art so near the ultimate salvation,' began Beatrice,      'that thou oughtest to have thine eyes clear and sharp. And      therefore ere thou further enterest it, look back downward,      and see how great a world I have already set beneath thy feet,      in order that thy heart, so far as it is able, may present      itself joyous to the triumphant crowd which comes glad through      this round ether.' With my sight I returned through each and      all the seven spheres, and saw this globe such that I smiled      at its mean semblance; and that counsel I approve as the best      which holds it of least account; and he who thinks of other      things maybe called truly worthy.\"  Dante's scale of values is that which appears from the starry heaven. His austere piety, his invincible courage, and his uncompromising hatred of wrong, are neither accidents of temperament nor blind reactions, but compose the proper character of one who has both seen the world from God, and returned to see God from the world. He was, as Lowell has said, \"a man of genius who could hold heartbreak at bay for twenty years, and would not let himself die till he had done his task\"; and his power was not obstinacy, but a vision of the ways of God. He knew a truth that justified him in his sacrifices, and made a great glory of his defeat and exile. Even so his poetry or appreciation of life is the expression of an inward contemplation of the world in its unity or essence. It is but an elaboration of the piety which he attributes to the lesser saints of paradise, when he has them say:       \"Nay, it is essential to this blessed existence to hold      ourselves within the divine will, whereby our very wills are      made one. So that as we are from stage to stage throughout      this realm, to all the realm is pleasing, as to the King who      inwills us with His will. And His will is our peace; it is      that sea whereunto is moving all that which It creates and      which nature makes.\"[47:8]  [Sidenote: The Difference between Poetry and Philosophy.]  § 14. There now remains the brief task of distinguishing the philosopher-poet from the philosopher himself. The philosopher-poet is one who, having made the philosophical point of view his own, expresses himself in the form of poetry. The philosophical point of view is that from which the universe is comprehended in its totality. The wisdom of the philosopher is the knowledge of each through the knowledge of all. Wherein, then, does the poet, when possessed of such wisdom, differ from the philosopher proper? To this question one can give readily enough the general answer, that the difference lies in the mode of utterance. Furthermore, we have already given some account of the peculiar manner of the poet. He invites us to experience with him the beautiful and moving in nature and life. That which the poet has to express, and that which he aims to arouse in others, is an appreciative experience. He requires what Wordsworth calls \"an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings.\" Therefore if he is to be philosophical in intelligence, and yet essentially a poet, he must find his universal truth in immediate experience. He must be one who, in seeing the many, sees the one. The philosopher-poet is he who visualizes a fundamental interpretation of the world. \"A poem,\" says one poet, \"is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth.\"  The philosopher proper, on the other hand, has the sterner and less inviting task of rendering such an interpretation articulate to thought. That which the poet sees, the philosopher must define. That which the poet divines, the philosopher must calculate. The philosopher must dig for that which the poet sees shining through. As the poet transcends thought for the sake of experience, the philosopher must transcend experience for the sake of thought. As the poet sees all, and all in each, so the philosopher, knowing each, must think all consistently together, and then know each again. It is the part of philosophy to collect and criticise evidence, to formulate and coördinate conceptions, and finally to define in exact terms. The reanimation of the structure of thought is accomplished primarily in religion, which is a general conception of the world made the basis of daily living.  For religion there is no subjective correlative less than life itself. Poetry is another and more circumscribed means of restoring thought to life. By the poet's imagination, and through the art of his expression, thought may be sensuously perceived. \"If the time should ever come,\" says Wordsworth, \"when what is now called Science, thus familiarized to men, shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of flesh, and blood, the Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration, and will welcome the Being thus produced, as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man.\"[50:9] As respects truth, philosophy has an indubitable priority. The very sternness of the philosopher's task is due to his supreme dedication to truth. But if validity be the merit of philosophy, it can well be supplemented by immediacy, which is the merit of poetry. Presuppose in the poet conviction of a sound philosophy, and we may say with Shelley, of his handiwork, that \"it is the perfect and consummate surface and bloom of all things; it is as the odor and the color of the rose to the texture of the elements which compose it, as the form and splendor of unfaded beauty to the secrets of anatomy and corruption.\" \"Indeed,\" as he adds, \"what were our consolations on this side of the grave--and our aspirations beyond it--if poetry did not ascend to bring light and fire from those eternal regions where the owl-winged faculty of calculation dare not ever soar?\"[51:10]  The unity in outlook, attended by differences of method and form, which may exist between poet and philosopher, is signally illustrated by the relation between Goethe and Spinoza. What Goethe saw and felt, Spinoza proved and defined. The universal and eternal substance was to Spinoza, as philosopher, a theorem, and to Goethe, as poet, a perception and an emotion. Goethe writes to Jacobi that when philosophy \"lays itself out for division,\" he cannot get on with it, but when it \"confirms our original feeling as though we were one with nature,\" it is welcome to him. In the same letter Goethe expresses his appreciation of Spinoza as the complement of his own nature:       \"His all-reconciling peace contrasted with my all-agitating      endeavor; his intellectual method was the opposite counterpart      of my poetic way of feeling and expressing myself; and even      the inflexible regularity of his logical procedure, which      might be considered ill-adapted to moral subjects, made me his      most passionate scholar and his devoted adherent. Mind and      heart, understanding and sense, were drawn together with an      inevitable elective affinity, and this at the same time      produced an intimate union between individuals of the most      different types.\"[51:11]  It appears, then, that some poets share with all philosophers that point of view from which the horizon line is the boundary of all the world. Poetry is not always or essentially philosophical, but may be so; and when the poetic imagination restores philosophy to immediacy, human experience reaches its most exalted state, excepting only religion itself, wherein God is both seen and also served. Nor is the part of philosophy in poetry and religion either ignoble or presumptuous, for, humanly speaking, \"the owl-winged faculty of calculation\" is the only safe and sure means of access to that place on high,       \"Where the nightingale doth sing       Not a senseless, trancèd thing,       But a divine melodious truth;       Philosophic numbers smooth;      "]]]
