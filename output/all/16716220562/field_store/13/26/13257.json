For after hearing some gossip repeat Mr. Crow's opinion Solomon Owl--the wise old bird--had given several long hoots and hurried off, though it was broad daylight, to set Mr. Crow right.  \"The trouble--\" Solomon explained when he had found Mr. Crow on the edge of the woods--\"the trouble with your plan to have Grumpy Weasel work in the sawmill is that he wouldn't keep a knot hole filled longer than a jiffy. It's true that he can fit a very small hole. But if you'd ever watched him closely you'd know that he's in a hole and out the other side so fast you can scarcely see what happens. He's entirely too active to fill the bill.\"  Old Mr. Crow made a queer noise in his throat, which showed that Solomon Owl had made him angry.  \"I never said anything about Grumpy Weasel's filling any bills,\" Mr. Crow spluttered. \"Knot holes were what I had in mind. I've no doubt, though, that you'd like Grumpy Weasel to fill your own bill.\"  Now, if Solomon Owl had not tried more than once to catch Grumpy Weasel perhaps Mr. Crow's retort wouldn't have made him feel so uncomfortable. And muttering that he wished when people spoke of his beak they wouldn't call it a bill, and that Mr. Crow was too stupid to talk to, Solomon blundered away into the woods.  It was true, of course, that Grumpy Weasel was about the quickest of all the furred folk in Pleasant Valley. Why, you might be looking at him as he stopped for a moment on a stone wall; and while you looked he would vanish before your eyes. It was just as if he had melted away in an instant, so quickly could he dart into a crevice between the stones.  It was surprising, too, that he could whisk himself out of sight so fast, for his body was absurdly long. But if he was long in one way he was short in another. Yes! Grumpy Weasel had the shortest temper of all the field- and forest-folk throughout Pleasant Valley. Even peppery Peter Mink was not so short-tempered as he.  So terrible tempered was Grumpy Weasel that whenever the news flashed through the woods that he was out hunting, all the small people kept quite still, because they were afraid. And even some of the bigger ones--a good deal bigger than Grumpy Weasel himself--felt uneasy.  So you can see whether or not Grumpy Weasel was welcome.     II  AT THE OLD STONE WALL   Little Mr. Chippy suddenly set up a great twitter. Anybody could see that he was frightened. And one of Jolly Robin's sons, perched in an apple tree near the stone wall where Mr. Chippy lived in a wild grapevine, wondered what could be the matter.  Presently, as he looked beneath him, he saw a long, slim shape dart from a chink of the old wall, and as quickly disappear.  \"Huh!\" said young Master Robin. \"Foolish people who build their homes on walls must expect snakes for visitors.\" And feeling quite wise and grown up, he turned his back on Mr. Chippy, as if it really made no difference to him if Mr. Chippy did have a dangerous caller.  Meanwhile others of the bird neighbors began to echo Mr. Chippy's warning notes. And young Master Robin thought everybody was silly to make such a fuss over the misfortunes of a humble person like Mr. Chippy.  \"If they don't look out they'll scare all the angleworms back into their holes,\" he grumbled--a remark which shows that he knew little about the ways of the world. And when Rusty Wren swerved near him and called to him to look out for Mr. Chippy's visitor--that he was \"a bad one\"--young Master Robin actually puffed himself up with rage.  \"He seems to think I'm in danger of falling out of this tree,\" he sneered aloud. \"He doesn't know that I can handle myself in a tree as well as he can.\" As he spoke, Master Robin all but tumbled off his perch. But he caught himself just in time, then looked around hastily to see if anybody had noticed his awkwardness.  All this time poor Mr. Chippy's cries continued. There was really no reason for his alarm. For his wife was away from home, with all their children. But Mr. Chippy kept flying back and forth in a great flutter. He too called to young Master Robin that he'd better go home.  Still that knowing youngster paid no heed to his elder's advice.  \"If snakes climb trees I've never seen them do it,\" he scoffed.  \"Hi, there! Haven't you seen----\" Mr. Chippy started to say. But before he could finish his question Master Robin interrupted him rudely.  \"Certainly I saw him,\" he cried. \"I saw him come out of the wall and go in again.\"  \"He'll get you if you don't go away!\" Mr. Chippy shrieked.  \"Let him try!\" Master Robin scoffed. He was sorry that Mr. Chippy did not hear him. But that distracted little person had already hurried off to warn somebody else.  It was no time at all before Rusty Wren's wife gave a piercing scream.  \"That fat Robin boy--he'll be caught!\" she wailed.  Now, it made Master Robin very angry to be spoken of in such a way as that.  \"Fat!\" he burst out in a loud tone as he stared in Mrs. Wren's direction. \"Who's fat?\"  \"You are!\" said a strange, grumpy voice right behind him--or so it seemed to young Master Robin.     III  MASTER ROBIN'S LESSON   When young Master Robin heard the strange voice that sounded so grumpy and so near him he was terribly frightened. He forgot that he thought himself grown up, and very wise, and quite able to go about alone. He didn't even look to see who was speaking, but fell backwards off the limb of the apple tree.  It was lucky for him, too, that he fell just when he did. For a long brownish person, white underneath, took Master Robin's place on the limb so promptly that you could hardly have said he jumped into it from somewhere else. He seemed to have popped out of the tree somewhat as a freshly popped kernel of corn bursts forth. A moment ago it was not there! You were watching, but did not see it grow big.  Well, all at once there was silence in the orchard. Everybody was holding his breath, waiting to see what happened to young Master Robin. Though he had lost his balance and tumbled backward he righted himself quite like an old-timer and flew off across the orchard.  \"I didn't know snakes could climb trees,\" he stammered to Mr. Chippy, who had followed him.  \"Snakes!\" Mr. Chippy piped. \"That wasn't a snake! That was Grumpy Weasel.... And it's a wonder you ever escaped,\" he added. \"I must learn that backward somersault. It's a good thing to know.\"  [Illustration: Master Robin Escapes From Grumpy Weasel. (_Page 9_)]  You can see that Mr. Chippy was a very humble person. But Mr. Jolly Robin's eldest son was quite proud. Already he began to feel that he had been very skilful in escaping. But of course it was only an accident that he got away.  For once in his life Grumpy Weasel had been careless. It had looked so easy--catching that clumsy young robin! He had spoken to Master Robin, not dreaming that he could save himself. To make matters worse, Grumpy had found Mr. Chippy's nest empty. And Grumpy Weasel was the sort of person that liked to find a bird at home when he called. It always made him more ill-natured than usual to make a call for nothing. And now he had let a stupid young Robin escape him. So it is not surprising that his big black eyes snapped nor that he said something in a fierce voice that sounded like \"Chip, chip, chip,\" but meant something a good deal worse.  And to add to Grumpy Weasel's rage,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24881"],["title","The Tale of Grumpy Weasel (#1)"],["body","had laughed hoarsely--somebody that sat in a tall elm across the road.  If he could have caught Mr. Crow there is no doubt that Grumpy would have made that black scamp sorry that he laughed. But old Mr. Crow was too wary to let anybody surprise him. \"Haw, haw!\" he laughed again. And Grumpy Weasel actually couldn't bear to hear him. Some of the onlookers claimed afterward that they saw Grumpy Weasel start down the tree. And that was as much as they could say. No one knew how he managed to slip out of sight. And the field people say that he was never seen again in that exact spot.     IV  HUNTING A HOLE   Usually Grumpy Weasel did not stray far from a certain corner of Farmer Green's wood lot. He preferred to hunt where he knew the lay of the land. And since he liked especially to hunt along old stone walls, he picked out a long stretch of old tumble-down wall that reached through the woods towards Blue Mountain.  He picked it out as his very own hunting ground and never asked permission of Farmer Green, either.  Now, near the lower end of this wall--the end toward the pasture--a fat person known as Mr. Meadow Mouse sometimes wandered. But he never visited that spot without first inquiring whether Grumpy Weasel had been there the day before. Mr. Meadow Mouse had learned somehow that Grumpy usually moved on each day to a different part of his hunting ground. He was surprised, therefore, to meet Grumpy Weasel face to face one time, when he felt sure that that surly rogue must be a good safe distance away.  Mr. Meadow Mouse cast a quick glance around. But he could see no place to hide. So there was nothing for him to do but to put on a bold front. He bowed pleasantly enough, though he was trembling a little, and remarked that it was a fine day and that he hoped Grumpy was feeling happy--all of which was quite true.  Grumpy Weasel glowered at Mr. Meadow Mouse, for that was his way of replying to a kindly greeting.  \"You've not come here to hunt, I hope,\" he growled. \"I'll have you know that this is my private hunting ground and I allow no poaching.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse hastened to explain that he was merely out for a stroll.  \"I never hunt,\" he declared. \"Of course, if I happen to see a tiny seed I may stop to eat it. But that's all.\"  \"You'd better be careful what you say!\" Grumpy Weasel snapped. \"Unless I'm mistaken, you were hunting something the moment you saw me. You were hunting a hole.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse gasped slightly. He hardly knew what to say.  \"Be very careful where you go around here!\" Grumpy Weasel warned him. \"The holes in this stone wall are all mine. I shouldn't want you to use a single one of them without my permission.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse assured him that he wouldn't dream of trespassing.  \"And these holes among the roots of the trees--they are mine too,\" Grumpy Weasel snarled.  \"Oh, certainly! Certainly!\" Mr. Meadow Mouse cried. He was so quick to agree that for once Grumpy Weasel couldn't think of anything more to find fault about.  \"I'll let you crawl into a few of the smaller holes in the stone wall, if you'll be careful not to hurt them,\" he offered grudgingly.  Mr. Meadow Mouse made haste to thank him.  He said, however, that he thought he would wait till some other time.  \"There's no time like the present,\" Grumpy Weasel grumbled. \"To tell the truth, I want to see if you can squeeze through as small a hole as I can.\"     V  SOLOMON OWL INTERRUPTS   Plump little Mr. Meadow Mouse wished he had stayed away from Grumpy Weasel's hunting ground. He would have scampered off, had he not known that Grumpy could overtake him before he had made three leaps. So he saw no way out of his trouble, though he could think of nothing less agreeable than trying to slip through a small hole with Grumpy Weasel close at hand, watching him narrowly.  Then all at once Mr. Meadow Mouse had an idea. \"You go first!\" he said politely. \"Go through any hole you choose and then I'll try my luck.\"  But Grumpy Weasel was too crafty to do that.  \"You'd try your luck at running away,\" he snarled. \"You are the one to go first; and we'll have no words about it.\"  Well, Mr. Meadow Mouse began to shake more than ever.  \"Don't you think,\" he quavered, \"that we'd better wait a few days until I'm a bit smaller? I'm afraid I've been overeating lately and I might get stuck in a hole. And of course that would be awkward.\"  \"Ha, ha!\" Grumpy Weasel actually laughed. But it was not what any one could call a hearty, wholesome, cheerful sort of laugh. On the contrary, it sounded very cruel and gloating.  \"Hoo, hoo!\" Another laugh--this one weird and hollow--boomed out from the hemlock tree just above Mr. Meadow Mouse's head.  He jumped, in spite of himself--did Mr. Meadow Mouse. And so, too, did Grumpy Weasel. Both of them leaped for the old stone wall. And each flashed into a crevice between the stones, though Grumpy Weasel was ever so much the quicker of the two. They knew Solomon Owl's voice too well to mistake his odd laughter.  \"What's your hurry, gentlemen?\" Solomon called to them.  Mild Mr. Meadow Mouse made no reply. But from Grumpy Weasel's hiding place an angry hiss told Solomon Owl that one of them, at least, had heard his question.  \"Come out!\" said Solomon Owl. \"Don't be shy! I've dined already.\"  Well, that made the two in the wall feel somewhat bolder. And soon they ventured to peep out and gaze at Solomon, to see whether he looked like a person who had just enjoyed a good meal.  \"You're not as hollow as you sound, I hope,\" Grumpy Weasel remarked with some suspicion in his tone.  As for Mr. Meadow Mouse, he wouldn't dream of making so rude a remark.  \"It's a fine evening and I hope you're feeling happy,\" he piped.  \"Oh, very! Very!\" said Solomon Owl solemnly.  Mr. Meadow Mouse was a trusting sort of chap. He was all ready to leave his cranny. But Grumpy Weasel was not yet satisfied.  \"Which one of us are you answering?\" he demanded of Solomon.  \"Him!\" said Solomon.  \"Did you say, 'Ahem?'\" Grumpy Weasel wanted to know.  \"No, no!\" Solomon assured him. \"I said, 'him.' I was answering your friend.\"  Grumpy Weasel made a wry face, as if he did not care to have anybody speak of Mr. Meadow Mouse as a friend of his. And he did not quit the stone wall until he had seen Mr. Meadow Mouse venture forth in safety.  \"Just by accident I overheard your remarks a few minutes ago,\" Mr. Owl explained. \"I'd like to watch this hole-crawling contest. And I'll stay here and be the umpire--and see that there's fair play.\"     VI  MR. MEADOW MOUSE ESCAPES   Grumpy Weasel did not like Solomon Owl's offer to be umpire of the hole-crawling contest between Mr. Meadow Mouse and himself. He hissed a few times and glared at Solomon Owl, up in the hemlock tree.  Solomon Owl did not appear to mind that, but calmly outstared Grumpy Weasel without once blinking. \"Are you both ready?\" he asked presently.  \"Yes, thank you!\" Mr. Meadow Mouse answered. And Grumpy Weasel gave a sort of shrug, as if to say that he supposed he was.  \"First you may try that hole between those mossy stones,\" Mr. Owl announced, with a tilt of his head toward the wall.  \"Certainly!\" cried Mr. Meadow Mouse.  \"You go first and I'll follow,\" Grumpy Weasel told him.  And Mr. Meadow Mouse didn't dare disobey. He whisked through the hole spryly and was back again in no time.  Then Grumpy took his turn. He was certainly quicker than Mr. Meadow Mouse. Even the umpire, Solomon Owl, had to admit that.  \"But of course that's not the point,\" Solomon observed. \"It's the one that gets stuck in a hole that loses the contest.\"  Well, after Grumpy and Mr. Meadow Mouse had slipped through several holes, each one smaller than the one before, Mr. Meadow Mouse said that he thought it was only polite to let Grumpy go first. Secretly Mr. Meadow Mouse was afraid of what might happen if he should have the misfortune to get wedged in a hole, with Grumpy Weasel ready to follow him. He had had some trouble getting through the last one and he knew that he could never squeeze through one that was much smaller.  Grumpy Weasel lost his temper at once.  \"I'll do as I please on my stone wall!\" he snapped. And he was angrier than ever when Solomon Own said to him, \"It's your turn!\" Probably no other of the woods people--unless it was one of the Hawk family--could have made Grumpy Weasel obey. And now he insisted that if he \"went first\" he ought to be allowed to choose whatever hole he pleased.  Both Solomon Owl and Mr. Meadow Mouse agreed. So Grumpy Weasel popped through a hole of his own choosing, and he did not reappear, though he called to Mr. Meadow Mouse to \"come on.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse hung back.  \"You'll have to excuse me,\" he stammered.  \"What's the matter?\" boomed Solomon Owl. \"Do you want to lose the contest?\"  \"No!\" said Mr. Meadow Mouse. \"But Grumpy Weasel is still inside that hole. There's no other way out.\"  \"How do you know?\" Solomon Owl asked him.  \"Oh, I've been here before, often,\" Mr. Meadow Mouse replied.  \"Are you sure?\" Mr. Owl inquired.  \"I'll go on the other side of the wall and look,\" Mr. Meadow Mouse offered. And thereupon he skipped over the wall.  Solomon Owl waited patiently. And so did Grumpy Weasel. But Mr. Meadow Mouse never came back. Once out of sight he scampered away. And he never trespassed on Grumpy Weasel's hunting ground again.     VII  PADDY MUSKRAT'S BLUNDER   Sometimes Grumpy Weasel found the hunting poor along the stretch of stone wall that he called his own--though of course it really belonged to Farmer Green. And though he disliked to wander much in strange neighborhoods, once in a while he visited other parts of Pleasant Valley.  It was on such an excursion to the bank of the mill pond that he caught sight, one day, of Paddy Muskrat--or to be more exact, that Paddy Muskrat caught sight of him.  Now it was seldom that anybody spoke to Grumpy Weasel. On the contrary, most of the forest-folk dodged out of sight whenever they saw him, and said nothing. So he wheeled like a"]]]
