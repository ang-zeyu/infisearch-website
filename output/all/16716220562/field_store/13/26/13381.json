these tables shows very clearly that during fermentation marked changes are brought about other than the mere conversion of sugar into alcohol. While it is well known that these changes take place it seems worth while to consider them here, because no similar study relating to American brewery products has been published. Further since we have the exact analysis of the wort and of the beer which was made from it, we have a special opportunity to examine quantitatively some of these changes, such as the production of alcohol, the fermentation of dextrin, the development of acids, and the losses of protein, ash, and phosphoric acid during fermentation.  In order to study the question of the yield of alcohol, to test the present factor used for the calculation of the solids in the original wort, and to show the approximate amount of dextrin, calculations were made, the results of which are presented in Table V.

By dividing alcohol into loss in solids there was secured a factor which makes possible the estimation of the solids in the original wort, provided that alcohol and extract are known. This factor also shows the yield of alcohol for a given amount of solids disappearing during fermentation. It has been found in the case of the beers that this factor averages 2.14, while in the case of the ales it averages 2.12, making an average for all of the products of 2.13. This clearly shows that in the yield of alcohol for a given amount of fermentable solids there is no appreciable difference between top fermentation products, such as ales, and bottom fermentation products, such as beers.  A marked difference in loss in solids is shown, however, when we compare the beers with the ales. In the case of the beers we find there is practically no difference between the loss in solids and the loss in sugar, while in the case of the porters and ales there is a very appreciable difference. The difference between the loss in solids and the loss in sugar is only 0.04 per cent for all of the beers; while in the case of the porters and ales the difference varies from 1.47 per cent to 2.65 per cent, with an average of 1.96 per cent. These figures clearly show that in the case of the porters and ales there has been some material other than sugar fermented. Unfortunately, the determination of dextrin was not made in all of the worts, so that the actual decrease in dextrin can be shown only in a few cases. But in those cases where we have the actual results the difference between loss in solids and the loss in sugar compares very closely with the actual amount of dextrin disappearing during fermentation.   DEVELOPMENT OF ACIDS DURING FERMENTATION.  A comparison of the amounts of volatile and fixed acids in the worts and in the finished beers shows that normally there is no appreciable development of volatile acid during fermentation and only a slight increase in the fixed acid. This increase in fixed acid averages in the case of the beers 0.049 per cent, while in the case of the ales the increase averages 0.103 per cent.   DECREASE IN PROTEIN, ASH, AND PHOSPHORIC ACID.  A general study of the preceding tables will show that there is an appreciable loss of protein, ash, and phosphoric acid during the fermentation. Table VI has been prepared to show the average loss during fermentation of the various classes of worts with respect to their protein, ash, and phosphoric acid contents.   TABLE VI.--_Average loss during fermentation._  +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------+ |                           | Protein. |   Ash.   |Phosphoric | |       Kind of wort.       |          |          |   acid.   | +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------+ |                           | Grams per| Grams per| Grams per | |                           |  100 cc. |  100 cc. |  100 cc.  | +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------+ |Beer worts (all-malt)      |  0.209   |  0.017   |  0.015    | |Beer worts (malt and rice) |   .210   |   .045   |   .014    | |Beer worts (malt and corn) |   .168   |   .014   |   .013    | |Porter worts               |   .213   |   .031   |   .017    | |Ale worts                  |   .275   |   .029   |   .019    | +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------+   The results given in Table VI show a great similarity in the changes in all of the products, as there is about the same amount of loss of protein, ash, and phosphoric acid in the beer, ale, and porter worts. There does not appear to be any appreciable loss, however, of either protein or phosphoric acid during the storage or aging period as is shown by the few samples which we have analyzed after storage. This is practically in agreement with the experiment of Bertschinger,[1] whose results show only a very slight increase in alcohol and loss of sugar during the storage period.  [Footnote 1: Z. angew. Chem. (1890), p. 670.]   EFFECT OF RAW MATERIALS USED UPON COMPOSITION OF THE FINISHED BREW.  In order to show the effects on the finished beers or ales of the use of corn, rice, cerealin, and brewer's sugar as substitutes for malt in the worts, Table VII has been prepared, giving the results of analyses of a number of brews made in different breweries and from varying kinds and amounts of raw materials.
