When he returned from London his English was probably better than the cabin-boy's will ever be, but he is a little out of practice.  I had observed a couple of picturesque ruffians hovering about in the gloom of the garden; towards the end of dinner they wandered into the circle of the electric light and resolved themselves into Carmelo and Rosario.  We invited them to sit down, gave them wine and cigarettes and talked over the changes that had taken place in the town since I had last been there.  When they had gone, I asked Peppino about Rosario's misfortune and learnt that he had been put into prison for stabbing his father.  He had only wounded him, and Peppino thought the father had probably been in the wrong, for he has a bad history in the books of the police, but Rosario had not done himself any good over it, because, of course, the crime and its consequences have now gone down into his own history.  An Englishman may be a mass of prejudices, but I confess I did not like the idea of hob-nobbing with a would-be parricide and determined that Rosario should not drive me any more; if I wanted a carriage, Carmelo should get leave of his padrone and take me.  Next morning, while I was having my coffee, there was a sound of passing music; I recognized it as belonging to a funeral, and asked Peppino if he knew who was dead.  Several people were dead and he did not know which this was, unless it was old Baldassare; it must be either a married woman or a grown-up man.  I asked how he knew that.  He replied that when apprenticed to his father, who had been sagrestano before taking the hotel, he had learnt all about the ceremonies of the Church.  \"They do this,\" he said, \"when it is a married lady dead or a grown man. If it shall be the woman dead unmarried or a boy dead, then shall it be a different song, a different ring of bell and the dead shall go very directly in the paradiso; it is like the--please, what is fuochi artificiali?  Excuse me, it is the rocket; prestissimo and St. Peter he don't be asking no question.  Did you understand?\"  He then diverged to ceremonies connected with last illnesses--  \"When the doctor is coming it is telling always that you would be good of the malady, but when the priest is coming it is telling that you are finished.  This is not a good thing.  It is difficult to hope when the doctor is shaking the head and is telling 'Please, you; go, catch the priest quickly, quickly.'  And sometimes the notary, the man of law, if the malade is having money; if no money, it is the notary not at all. When the doctor is coming out, the priest is coming in, and generally after would be the death.  But you must pay.  If to pay less would come only one priest and not well dressed, if to pay more, very well dressed and too many priests.  If to pay plenty, plenty, then to ring all the bells and enter by the great door; but if to pay few, then not many bells and to enter by the second door.  Did you understand?  \"When they die the parents always, and also the man that is to die, they fear the--please, what is not the paradiso?  Excuse me, it is the inferno: and they tell to the priest 'Please come.'  Then they pay him to tell all that is good, and sometimes the priest arrive that you will be dead.  If you shall suicide, very likely you are dead before.  Then shall the parents pay him to tell that the man to die has taken all the functions of religion and the holy oil to put in the foot to prevent him the death.  But it is prevent not at all.  \"Did you know what is sacramento?  All right, I shall tell you.  The priest is going with the sacramento on the hand and the umbrella on the head and you must pay--always must pay, it is the interesting thing.  And the old women are going and are praying because the man is dead: and the soldiers are going and are taking the arms before the risorgimento, but now the law it is redeemed.  Then they arrive into the room of the malade and take the sacramento and up and down and put the holy oil in the foot and pray and went away, and the malade who is not dead would very soonly die.\"    CHAPTER III--THE PROFESSOR   The day before the festa there came a professor of pedagogy, and Peppino was not best pleased to see him because he knew him as a jettatore.  I had supposed this word to mean a person with the evil eye who causes misfortunes to others, but he used it in the sense of one who causes misfortunes to himself or, at least, who is always in trouble--a man who is constitutionally unfortunate, the sort of man with whom Napoleon would have nothing to do.  He will miss his train more often than not; if he has to attend a funeral it will be when he has a cold in his head, and all his white pocket-handkerchiefs will be at the wash, so that he must use a coloured one; he will attempt to take his medicine in the dark, thereby swallowing the liniment by mistake.  Of course, this kind of man is incidentally disastrous to others as well as to himself and is, therefore, also a jettatore in the other sense, so that Napoleon was quite right.  The arrival of the professor led Peppino into giving me a great deal of information about the evil eye in which he swore he did not believe.  It was all rather indefinite and contradictory, partly, no doubt, because those who believe in it most firmly are the analfabeti and unaccustomed to express themselves clearly.  The prevailing idea seems to be that an evil influence proceeds from the eye of the jettatore who is not necessarily a bad person, at least he need not be desirous of hurting any one.  The misfortunes that follow wherever he goes may be averted by the interposition of some attractive object whereby the glance from his eye is arrested, and either the misfortune does not happen at all, or the force of the evil influence is expended elsewhere.  Therefore, it is as well always to carry some charm against the evil eye.  All over Italy, but especially in the south, it is rare to meet a man who does not carry a charm, either on his watch-chain or in his pocket, or on a string or a chain round his neck under his clothes, and he usually carries more than one.  Women, of course, always wear them, which may be because a woman likes to surround herself with pretty things, and, if she can say that they protect her, she has a reason, unconnected with vanity, which she may be apt to profess is her true reason for wearing ornaments.  The same applies to men who, though less in the habit of wearing ornaments, are, as has been often remarked, no less vain than women.  This may be called the ornamental view and may account for some of the fashions that arise in the wearing of charms. But there is also the utilitarian view, and a new form of charm will sometimes become popular, just as a new sanctuary becomes popular, because it is reported to have been effective in some particular case. Probably no change of fashion will ever banish horns made of coral or mother-of-pearl; being pointed, they are supposed to attract and break up the evil glance as a lightning conductor is supposed to attract and break up a flash of lightning.  Peppino was very contemptuous about all charms and coral horns especially.  Even assuming that horns in a general way are prophylactic, it is no use having them made of coral or mother-of-pearl and wearing them on one's watch-chain, because the Padre Eterno, when he designed the human form, was careful to provide man with natural means of making horns so that the evil eye might be averted during the period that would have to elapse before the wearing of ornaments became customary.  We can still benefit by this happy forethought if we are threatened with the evil eye when divested of all our charms--when bathing for instance.  The pope, Pio Nono, was believed to have the evil eye, and pious pilgrims asking his blessing used, at the same time, to take the precaution of protecting themselves from his malign influence by pointing two fingers at him under their clothes.  Inanimate things, of course, cannot be said literally to have the evil eye, but many of them cause misfortunes.  A hearse is a most unlucky thing to meet when it is empty.  Peppino says--  \"If you shall meet the carriage of the dead man and it is empty, perhaps it shall be coming to take you; this is not a good thing and then must you be holding the horn in the hand.  But if the dead man shall be riding in his carriage, then certainly this time it shall not be for you and the horn it is necessary not at all.  This is what they believe.\"  He did not mean that you are bound to die if you see an empty hearse, but that unless you take precautions you will certainly meet with some kind of misfortune.  I should say that the professor meets an empty hearse every day of his life.  He came up to Castellinaria, not knowing there was to be a festa, found every place full and spent the night wandering about the streets.  It was impossible not to be sorry for the poor man when I found him the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],["title","Diversions in Sicily (#5)"],["body","afternoon dozing on a chair in the kitchen and, in a fit of expansiveness, I offered him the other bed in my room. He accepted it with gratitude and said he should retire early as he was too much fatigued to care about religious festivities.  Peppino took the earliest opportunity of blowing me up for this, saying that it was most dangerous to sleep with a jettatore in the room.  I told him I did not believe in all that nonsense any more than he did and we had a long discussion which he ended by producing a coral horn from his pocket, saying the professor might have the other bed if I would wear the coral all night.  Of course I chaffed him about having the horn in his pocket after his protestations of disbelief, but it was like talking to a kitten that has been caught stealing fish and I had to take his charm and promise to conform on the ground that one cannot be too careful.  The procession, which was the climax of the festa, did not begin till 11.30 P.M. and was not over till 3.30 the next morning.  On returning to the albergo I found the professor still dozing on his chair, undisturbed by the constant chatter of all the servants and their friends.  He had not gone to bed because the padrone, Peppino's father, with the key of my room in his pocket, had gone out early in the evening and got lost in the crowd, so there were both my beds wasted and nothing to be done but to make the best of it.  I settled myself on a chair in a corner and wished for day.  Whereupon, almost immediately, Peppino, who, though I did not know it till afterwards, had been keeping near me and watching me all night in case I might meet the evil eye among the people, came in and the discussion rose into a tumult of dialect, as the situation was made clear to him, and then sank into complete silence which was broken by his suddenly saying to me--  \"You wish to sleep?  All right.  I show you the bed.  Come on.\"  He preceded me up some back stairs into a room occupied by a lady in one bed, her female attendant in another and, in various shakedowns on the floor, another woman, two men and more children than I could count by the light of one candle.  We picked our way among them to the farther end of the room where there was a door.  Peppino produced a key and opened it; to my surprise it led into my room.  \"Buon riposo,\" said Peppino, and was about to disappear the way we had come when I reminded him that the professor was to have the other bed.  I had some difficulty with him, but when I had hung his coral round my neck he gave way.  After this I saw a great deal of the professor.  He said he was forty-five and he was perhaps the most simple-minded, gentle creature I have ever known.  Being with him was like listening to a child strumming on a worn-out piano.  As we sat down to dinner next day he asked if he could have a little carbonate of soda.  Peppino, with a glance at the bill of fare, regretted that there was none in the house.  The professor then explained to me the advantages of taking carbonate of soda before meals and said that some chemists gave one an enormous quantity for two soldi.  Evidently the professor had not a good digestion.  He helped me with his own fork to a piece of meat off his own plate.  This is a mark of very great friendliness and makes me think of Joseph entertaining his brethren when they went down to buy corn in Egypt.  \"And he took and sent messes unto them from before him; but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs.\"  And I think of Menelaus in the _Odyssey_ sending a piece of meat to Telemachus and Pisistratus when they supped with him at Lacedaemon; and of Ulysses, at supper in the palace of Alcinous, sending a piece of meat to Demodocus to thank him for his singing, in spite of the pain his lays had caused him.  I always accept the gift, after deprecating the honour with words and gestures, and a little later, in accordance with what I believe to be the modern practice, return the compliment.  The professor was pleased to have an opportunity of improving his knowledge of England and asked me many questions.  I am afraid he only pretended to believe some of the things I told him.  I said that in England a man who is the proprietor of the house he lives in is not on that account necessarily a rich man; he may or may not be, it all depends.  He was surprised to hear that I had travelled from London to Castellinaria in less than three weeks; that the channel passage takes under twelve hours and has been known to be smooth; that London is not actually on the coast but a few miles inland and on a river; that we have other towns even more inland and that after the death of Queen Victoria, England did not become a republic.  I had the professor at a disadvantage because, being a Sicilian, his natural politeness would not permit him to show that in his opinion I was drawing upon my imagination after the manner of travellers.  Moreover Peppino declared that all I said was quite true and added that what in Sicily is like this (holding his hand out with the palm upwards) in England is like that (holding it with the palm downwards).  Nevertheless I was beginning to feel that I had gone far enough and had better be careful, so when he asserted that England refuses Home Rule to New Zealand, and grinds her colonies down under the iron heel of the oppressor because she cannot afford to lose the amount they pay us in our iniquitous income tax, I did not contradict him.  It is possible that I misunderstood him, or he may have guessed I did not agree, or there may have been even more confusion in his mind than I suspected, for he afterwards said that the income tax paid by the colonies went into the private pocket of Mr. Chamberlain, and that explained why the Secretary for the Colonies was so rich.  \"My dear professor,\" I said, \"permit me to tell you something; my poor mother had a cousin whose name was James.  He was perhaps the most simple-minded, gentle creature I have ever known.  Being with him was like listening to--well, it was like listening to certain kinds of music. He lived by himself in the country, with an old woman to do for him, and was over sixty before we came to know him; then we were all very fond of him and often wondered what the dear, good old gentleman could have been like in his early days.  It has just occurred to me that you, sir, are like what cousin James must have been at your age.\"  He was overwhelmed; his eyes filled with tears; he said he should remember for all his life the flattering words he had just heard; they constituted the most pleasing and genteel compliment he had ever received; he shook hands with me and remained silent as a sign that his emotion was too deep for more words.    CHAPTER IV--THE WINE-SHIP   Peppino usually took half an hour off and came about noon to wherever I was sketching to fetch me to lunch.  One morning as we walked along nearly every man we met smiled and said to him--  \"Buona festa, Peppino,\" and he smiled and returned their salutes with the same words.  He accounted for it by saying it was his onomastico--the day of the saint whose name he bears.  \"What?\" said I, \"is it S. Peppino and you never told me?  I wish you many happy returns of the day.  But it cannot be everybody's onomastico as well, and you say 'Buona festa, Peppino' to all who speak to you.\"  He replied that it was the 19th of March, the festa of S. Giuseppe, and assured me that he had said \"Buona festa, Peppino\" to no one who was not a namesake; so that about two-thirds of the men at Castellinaria must have been baptized Giuseppe.  \"Then that explains it,\" said I.  \"I was beginning to think that you might have become engaged to be married and they were congratulating you.\"  That did not do at all.  \"I got no time to be married,\" said he, \"too much busy.  Besides, marriage very bad thing.  Look here, I shall tell you, listen to me. Marriage is good for the woman, is bad for the man: every marriage makes to be one woman more in the world, one man less.  Did you understand? And they are not happy together.  We have a bad example in this town.\"  \"Surely you don't mean to tell me that here in Castellinaria, where everything moves so smoothly and so peacefully, you have an unhappy married couple?\"  He replied solemnly, slowly and decidedly, \"Not one--all.\"  He continued in his usual manner, \"Did you read the ten commandments for the people who shall be married?  If to find, shall be showing you.  It says, 'Non quarelate la prima volta.'  Did you understand?  'Don't begin to quarrel,' because you will never stop.  After the quarrel you make the peace, but it is too late: the man shall forget, perhaps, but the woman shall forget never, never, never, and you have lost.  \"I was telling to my friend,\" he continued, \"'Please do not be married, because when you would be married you would not love any more that lady.' And he was telling to me that he would marry, because it would be a good thing for him, good wife, good food, good care and many things like this. And I was telling to him, 'I would be seeing if you shall be repeating these words when you shall be married one year.'  The year was passed but my friend he don't be saying nothing to me.  Excuse me, I am not so bad man to ask him.  I found him many times in the street, but he would not meet me, would not speak.  Oh, no!  And he is not laughing any more.  Not one friend; fifteen friends, all married.  Never they are telling they are happy.\"  Having disposed of the question of marriage he told me that Carmelo had been to see me and would call again.  He had already been several times, and I was puzzled to know what he wanted.  He could hardly be wanting to propose an excursion, for I had already made him get leave and take me for several.  But as, sooner or later, an opportunity must occur for clearing up the mystery, I left it alone for the present and asked Peppino, who always knew everything that was going on in the "]]]
