Come to my house to-morrow at three o'clock and I'll pay you back then.\" The dog gave him some meal.  Then the monkey went to the house of the tiger and said, \"O, friend tiger, please lend me some meal. Come to my house to-morrow at four o'clock and I'll pay you back then.\" The tiger gave the monkey some meal.  The monkey went home and made a great pot of porridge. He feasted and feasted until he couldn't eat any more, but there was still plenty of porridge left in the pot. Then the monkey made his bed and took care to fix it high up from the floor.  The next day, at midday, he ate some more of the porridge. Then he bound a cloth about his head and went to bed pretending that he was sick.  At one o'clock the hen came and knocked at the door. The monkey in a low, weak voice asked her to enter. He told her how very sick he was and the hen was very sorry for him.  At two o'clock the fox came and knocked at the door. The hen was frightened almost to death. \"Never mind,\" said the monkey, \"you can hide here under my bed.\"  The hen hid under the monkey's bed and the monkey in a weak, low voice invited the fox to enter. The monkey told the fox how very ill he was and the fox was very sorry for him.  At three o'clock the dog came and knocked at the door. The fox was frightened almost to death. \"Never mind,\" said the monkey; \"hide here under my bed and everything will be all right.\"  The fox hid under the monkey's bed and the monkey, in a low, weak voice, invited the dog to enter. The monkey told the dog how very sick he was and the dog was very sorry for him.  At four the tiger came and knocked at the door. The dog was frightened almost to death. \"Never mind,\" said the monkey. \"Hide here under my bed and everything will be all right.\"  The dog hid under the monkey's bed. Then the monkey invited the tiger to enter. He told, the tiger how very sick he was but the tiger was not at all sorry for him. He sprang at the bed, demanding in a loud, fierce voice that the monkey pay back the meal at once, as he had promised to do. The monkey escaped to the tree tops, but the bed broke down under the tiger's weight.  Then the fox ate up the hen and the dog ate up the fox and the tiger ate up the dog. The tiger is still trying to catch the monkey.     XII  Why the Bananas Belong to  the Monkey   Perhaps you do not know it, but the monkeys think that all the bananas belong to them. When Brazilian children eat bananas they say, \"I am a monkey.\" I once knew a little boy in Brazil who was very, very fond of bananas. He always said, \"I am _very much_ of a monkey.\" If you are fond of bananas the Brazilian children would tell you that you are a monkey, too. This is the story they tell to show us how it all came about.  Once upon a time when the world had just been made and there was only one kind of banana, but very many kinds of monkeys, there was a little old woman who had a big garden full of banana trees. It was very difficult for the old woman to gather the bananas herself, so she made a bargain with the largest monkey. She told him that if he would gather the bunches of bananas for her she would give him half of them. The monkey gathered the bananas. When he took his half he gave the little old woman the bananas which grow at the bottom of the bunch and are small and wrinkled. The nice big fat ones he kept for himself and carried them home to let them ripen in the dark.  The little old woman was very angry. She lay awake all night trying to think of some way by which she could get even with the monkey. At last she thought of a trick.  The next morning she made an image of wax which looked just like a little black boy. Then she placed a large flat basket on the top of the image's head and in the basket she placed the best ripe bananas she could find. They certainly looked very tempting.  After a little while the biggest monkey passed that way. He saw the image of wax and thought that it was a boy peddling bananas. He had often pushed over boy banana peddlers, upset their baskets and then had run away with the bananas. This morning he was feeling very good-natured so he thought that he would first try asking politely for the bananas.  \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy,\" he said to him, \"please give me a banana.\" The image of wax answered never a word.  Again the monkey said, this time in a little louder voice, \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, please give me a banana, just one little, ripe little, sweet little banana.\" The image of wax answered never a word.  Then the monkey called out in his loudest voice, \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, if you don't give me a banana I'll give you such a push that it will upset all of your bananas.\" The image of wax was silent.  The monkey ran toward the image of wax and struck it hard with his hand. His hand remained firmly embedded in the wax.  \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, let go my hand,\" the monkey called out. \"Let go my hand and give me a banana or else I'll give you a hard, hard blow with my other hand.\" The image of wax did not let go.  The monkey gave the image a hard, hard blow with his other hand. The other hand remained firmly embedded in the wax.  Then the monkey called out, \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, let go my two hands. Let go my two hands and give me a banana or else I will give you a kick with my foot.\" The image of wax did not let go.  The monkey gave the image a kick with his foot and his foot remained stuck fast in the wax.  \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy,\" the monkey cried, \"let go my foot. Let go my two hands and my foot and give me a banana or else I'll give you a kick with my other foot.\" The image of wax did not let go.  Then the monkey who was now very angry, gave the image of wax a kick with his foot and his foot remained stuck fast in the wax.  The monkey shouted, \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy, let go my foot. Let go my two feet and my two hands and give me a banana or else I'll give you a push with my body.\" The image of wax did not let go.  The monkey gave the image of wax a push with his body. His body remained caught fast in the wax.  \"O, peddler boy, peddler boy,\" the monkey shouted, \"let go my body! Let go my body and my two feet and my two hands or I'll call all the other monkeys to help me!\" The image of wax did not let go.  Then the monkey made such an uproar with his cries and shouts that very soon monkeys came running from all directions. There were big monkeys and little monkeys and middle-sized monkeys. A whole army of monkeys had come to the aid of the biggest monkey.  It was the very littlest monkey who thought of a plan to help the biggest monkey out of his plight. The monkeys were to climb up into the biggest tree and pile themselves one on top of another until they made a pyramid of monkeys. The monkey with the very loudest voice of all was to be on top and he was to shout his very loudest to the sun and ask the sun to come and help the biggest monkey out of his dreadful difficulty.  This is what all the big-sized, little-sized, middle-sized monkeys did. The monkey with the loudest voice on top of the pyramid made the sun hear. The sun came at once.  The sun poured his hottest rays down upon the wax. After a while the wax began to melt. The monkey was at last able to pull out one of his hands. The sun poured down more of his hottest rays and soon the monkey was able to pull out his two hands. Then he could pull out one foot, then another, and in a little while his body, too. At last he was free.  When the little old woman saw what had happened she was very much discouraged about raising bananas. She decided to move to another part of the world where she raised cabbages instead of bananas. The monkeys were left in possession of the big garden full of banana trees. From that day to this the monkeys have thought that they own all the bananas.     XIII  How the Monkey Escaped  Being Eaten   Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, people ate fruits and nuts. Then there came a time when the fruits and nuts became scarce. People had to eat meat. So they began killing the various beasts to see which ones were the best to eat. They skinned them and cut them in pieces and cooked them over the fire. Some of the beasts were good to eat and others were not good at all.  The ox was found to be very good, and so was the sheep, and the armadillo. Then one day a man thought that he would try to eat the monkey.  The monkey was playing his guitar. \"Lee, lee, lee, lee, lee lay, lee lay, lee ray, lee ray.\" The man came close to him and said, \"Come here, little monkey, and let me hear your music. I enjoy it very much.\" All the time the man was coming closer and closer to the monkey. Just as he was about to stretch out his hand and seize the monkey, the monkey gave a sudden leap to the tree and hurried away to the tree top.  After that every time the man heard the monkey play the guitar he would come near and try to catch him. The monkey grew afraid of the man, so afraid that he gave up playing his guitar at all. For a long, long time he did not play upon it. One day he felt that he just _must_ have some music. He hid in a hole in the ground and there he played upon his guitar. He did not think that the man would hear him, but the man had very sharp ears. When he got through playing he started to come out of the hole in the ground. There was the man waiting for him! He crawled quickly back,--so far back that the man could not catch him. The monkey waited and waited for the man to go away, but the man did not go away.  After a while the man became thirsty and went to get a drink. He left his little boy in his place to watch for the monkey. After the man had gone away the monkey called out to the little boy, \"O, little boy, O, little boy, don't you wish that you could see the monkey dance?\"  The little boy replied that he wished he could.  \"Just put your eyes down to the door of my little cave, and I'll let you "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],["title","Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#7)"],["body","the monkey dance, little boy,\" said the monkey.  The little boy put his eyes down close to the hole in the ground. No sooner had he done so than the monkey threw dirt into the little boy's eyes. When the little boy was rubbing his eyes to get the dirt out of them the monkey made a sudden dash out of the cave and escaped to the tree tops. When the man returned the little boy did not dare to tell him that the monkey had escaped. The man waited and waited and waited there by the hole in the ground. At last he became tired of waiting and went away.  After that the man tried harder than ever to catch the monkey. If he had not had the good luck to catch the monkey napping one day there is no knowing when he would have got his hands upon him. One day, however, he caught the monkey napping. He shut him up in a box and carried him home to the children for supper.  The man put a big dish full of water over the fire ready to cook the monkey. Then he went away to collect more fuel for the fire. The monkey and his guitar were shut up in the box, and there, inside the box, the monkey played on his guitar. \"Lee, lee, lee, lee, lee lay, lee lay, lee ray, lee ray.\" The children came crowding close to the box.  \"O, children, O, children,\" said the monkey, \"don't you wish that you could see the monkey dance?\"  The children replied that they wished they could.  \"This box is so small that there is not room enough for me to dance here,\" said the monkey. \"Just let me out and I'll show you how well I can dance.\"  The children opened the box and let the monkey out into the room. The monkey played on his guitar, \"Lee, lee, lee, lee, lee lay, lee lay, lee ray, lee ray,\" and he danced about the room. Then he said, \"O, children! O, children! You have nothing at all cooking in that pot over the fire. Let us put something into the pot to cook.\"  The children thought that it would not be polite to tell the monkey what the pot of water was waiting for, so they let the monkey fill the pot as he liked. He put into it some little dry sticks and an empty cocoanut shell. Then he said, \"O, children, O, children, I cannot dance any more. It is so hot here in this room.\"  The children begged him to dance some more.  \"If you will open the door a little bit so that I can have more air to breathe I'll show you a new dance,\" said the monkey.  The children opened the door. The monkey danced over to the door and out of the door away to the tree top. That was the last they ever saw of him. He moved to another part of the country after that experience.  When the man came home with fuel for the fire the children did not dare to tell him that the monkey had escaped. They let him think that the sticks and the cocoanut shell in the pot was the monkey. He built a big roaring fire under the pot and soon it was boiling merrily. After the pot had boiled a while he called the children to come to supper with him. The children let him taste first. He fished a hard stick out of the pot and bit into it. \"This is not the monkey's leg. It is just a dry stick,\" he said, as he made a wry face. Then he fished the empty cocoanut shell out of the pot. \"That is not the monkey's head,\" he said as he tasted it, \"That is just an empty cocoanut shell.\" He couldn't find a single trace of the monkey in that monkey stew. He never wished to make a monkey stew again.     XIV  Why the Monkey Still Has  a Tail   Once upon a time the monkey and the rabbit made a contract. The monkey was to kill all the butterflies and the rabbit was to kill all the snakes.  One day the rabbit was taking a nap when the monkey passed that way. The monkey thought that he would play a trick on the rabbit so he pulled the rabbit's ears, pretending that he thought they were butterflies. The rabbit awoke very angry at the monkey and he plotted how he might revenge himself on the monkey.  The rabbit and the armadillo are very good friends. The armadillo is very, very strong, you know, so it was he whom the rabbit asked to help him.  One day the rabbit caught the monkey napping. He had watched and waited a long, long time to catch the monkey napping, but at last he succeeded. Even the monkey sometimes takes a nap. The rabbit called the armadillo at once and together they rolled a big stone upon the monkey's tail. The monkey pulled so hard to get his tail out from under the stone that it broke off. The cat, who at that time had no tail of her own, spied the tail and ran away with it. The monkey was very angry at the rabbit. \"O, we thought it was just a snake lying there,\" said the rabbit. \"When you pulled my ears, you know, you thought they were butterflies.\"  That did not help the monkey to feel any better. How was he to live without his tail! How could he climb without it! He simply had to have it back so he at once set out to find the cat.  At last he found the cat and said to her, \"O, kind cat, please give me back my tail.\"  \"I will give it to you,\" replied the cat, \"if you will get me some milk.\"  \"Where shall I get the milk?\" asked the monkey.  \"Go ask the cow for some,\" replied the cat.  The monkey went to the cow and said, \"O, kind cow, please give me some milk that I may give the milk to the cat so that the cat will give back my tail to me.\"  \"I will give you the milk,\" replied the cow, \"if you will get me some grass.\"  \"Where shall I get the grass?\" asked the monkey.  \"Go ask the farmer,\" responded the cow.  The monkey went to the farmer and said, \"O, kind farmer, please give me some grass that I may give the grass to the cow so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to the cat so that the cat will give back my tail to me.\"  The farmer said, \"I will give you some grass if you will give me some rain.\"  \"Where shall I get the rain?\" asked the monkey.  \"Go ask the clouds,\" responded the farmer.  The monkey went to the clouds and said, \"O, kind clouds, please send me down some rain that I may give the rain to the farmer so that the farmer will give me some grass so that I may give the grass to the cow so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to the cat so that the cat will give me back my tail.\"  \"I will give you some rain,\" replied the clouds, \"if you will get me some fog.\"  \"Where shall I get the fog?\" asked the monkey.  \"Go ask the rivers,\" replied the clouds.  The monkey went to the river and said, \"O, kind river, please give me a fog that I may give the fog to the clouds so that the clouds will give some rain so that I may give the rain to the farmer so that the farmer will give me some grass so that I may give the grass to the cow so that the cow will give me some milk so that I may give the milk to the cat so that the cat will give me back my tail.\"  \"I will give you a fog,\" replied the river, \"if you will find a new spring to feed me.\"  \"Where shall I find a spring?\" asked the monkey.  \"Go search for one among the rocks upon the hillside,\" replied the river.  Then the monkey climbed up the steep hill and searched and searched among the rocks until at last he found a little spring to feed the river. He brought the spring to the river and the river gave him a fog. He took the fog to the clouds and the clouds gave him rain. He took the rain to the farmer and the farmer gave him grass. He took the grass to the cow and the cow gave him milk. He took the milk to the cat and the cat gave him back his tail. The monkey was so glad to have his tail again that he danced and danced with glee. Ever since that time the monkey has been very careful to guard his tail. He still has one and he is still happy because of it.     XV  How Black Became White   One often hears the saying that one cannot make black white or white black. I said something about it once upon a time to my Brazilian _ama_ and she stared at me in surprise. \"O, yes, one can,\" she said. \"It happened once and no one can ever tell but that it may happen again. Perhaps the _Senhora_ has not heard the story?\" I begged her to tell me the story and this is the tale:  Once upon a time there was a little old woman who lived all alone with her little black son who was just as black as black can be. The little old woman had not always lived alone with the little black boy. She had once been the mother of three beautiful daughters, the very loveliest maidens in all the country round. They were so handsome that they attracted the attention of the wicked fairy who lived in an enchanted castle nearby, and this fairy had been very jealous of them. By the aid of magic she tied them up in sacks which could be opened only by burning the sacks over a fire built from magic wood. The little old woman and her little black son searched long and diligently for magic wood, but they were never able to find any.  It was a terrible thing to have one's daughters shut up in magic sacks. The little old woman had grown bent and weak and cross in her search to find the magic wood. If it had not been for the little black boy she would have given up entirely. The little black boy was always gay and cheerful and always sure that some day they would succeed in finding the magic wood.  One day the little old woman took her big water jar upon her head and carried it down to the stream to fill. It was so very heavy when she had filled it with water that she could not lift it to her head even with the help of the little black boy. Three fine looking _cavalheiros_ happened to be passing on horseback. She sent the little black boy to ask them if they would help her. They said they couldn't possibly stop. The little old woman was very angry. She did not know that they were on their way to the magic castle and _couldn't_ stop. The same wicked fairy who had shut the little old woman's beautiful daughters up in the sacks, was leading them on.  If the little old woman had known all about the three _cavalheiros_ she would not have been angry. She would have wanted to help them instead. The three _cavalheiros_ were very good and very wise, so"]]]
