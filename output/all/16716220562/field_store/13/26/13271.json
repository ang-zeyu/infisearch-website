Port! you may!--and we flew past some huge mass, over which the green seas were fruitlessly trying to dash themselves. Coleridge describes the scene around us too well for me to degrade it with my prose. I will give his version:--      \"And now there came both mist and snow,     And it grew wondrous cold,     And ice, mast high, came floating by     As green as emerald.     Through the drifts, the snowy clifts     Did send a dismal sheen;     Nor shapes of men, or beasts we ken,     The ice was all between.     With sloping masts, and dipping prow,     As who pursued with yell and blow,     Still treads the shadow of his foe,     And forward bends his head.     The ship drove fast--loud roared the blast,     And _northward_ aye we fled\"--  Until we all suddenly hauled-in for the land of Greenland, in order to visit the settlement of Uppernavik. Passing into a channel, some four miles in width, we found ourselves running past the remarkable and lofty cliffs of \"Sanderson his Hope,\" a quaint name given to this point by the \"righte worthie Master Davis,\" in honour of his patron, a merchant of Bristol. Well worthy was it of one whose liberality had tended to increase our geographical knowledge; and the Hope's lofty crest pierced through the clouds which drove athwart its breast, and looked afar to see \"whether the Lord of the Earth came not.\"  Under its lee, the water was a sheet of foam and spray, from the fierce gusts which swept down ravine and over headland; and against the base of the rocks, flights of wild fowl marked a spot famous amongst arctic voyagers as abounding in fresh food,--a charming variety to salt horse and Hambro' pork.  [Headnote: _UPPERNAVIK._]  On rounding an inner islet of the Women's Group, as it is called, a straggling assemblage of Esquimaux huts, with a black and red storehouse or two, as at Disco, denoted the northernmost of the present Danish settlements, as well as the site of an ancient Scandinavian port,--a fact assured by the recent discovery of a stone pillar on one of the adjacent islands bearing the following inscription:--      \"Elling Sigvatson, Bjame Thordason, and Endride Oddson, erected     these memorial stones and cleared this place on Saturday before     Gagndag (25th April), in the year 1135.\"  Exactly four hundred and fifty-two years before the place was rediscovered by our countryman, Davis.  The \"Intrepid\" having the honour of carrying-in the two post-captains, we box-hauled about in the offing until she returned with the disagreeable intelligence that all the English whalers were blocked up by ice, some thirty miles to the northward. Capt. Penny had been unable to advance, and the season was far from a promising one! Squaring our yards, we again bore up for the northward. In a few hours, a strong reflected light to the westward and northward showed we were fast approaching the ice-fields or floes of Baffin's Bay. A whaler, cruising about, shortly showed herself.   _June 26th, 1850._--My rough notes are as follows:--A.M. Standing in for the land, northward of \"Women's Isles,\" saw several whalers fast to the ice, inshore. Observe one of them standing out. H.M.S. \"Assistance\" is ordered to communicate. We haul to the wind. I visit the \"Resolute.\" Learn that we altered course last night because the floes were seen extending across ahead. The whaler turns out to be the \"Abram,\" Captain Gravill. He reports:--\"Fourteen whalers stopped by the ice; Captain Penny, with his ships, after incurring great risk, and going through much severe labour, was watching the floes with the hope of slipping past them into the north water.\"  Mr. Gravill had lately ranged along the Pack edge as far south as Disco, and found not a single opening except the bight, up which we had been steering last night. He said, furthermore, \"that there would be no passage across the bay, this year, for the whalers, because the water would not make sufficiently early to enable them to reach the fishing-ground in Pond's Bay by the first week in August; after which date, the whales travel southward towards Labrador.\" The report wound up with the discouraging statement that the whale-men agreed that the floes, this season, were unusually extensive, that the leads or cracks of water were few, and icebergs more numerous than they had been for some years.  It appears that a northerly gale has been blowing, with but slight intermission, for the last month; and that, in consequence, there is a large body of water to the north, the ice from which has been forced into the throat of Davis' Straits. All we have to pray for is, a continuation of the same breeze, for otherwise southerly winds will jam the whole body of it up in Melville Bay, and make what is called a \"closed season.\"  [Headnote: _A CHECK._]  Mr. G---- (though not a friend of Penny's) told us that Penny was working day and night to get ahead, and had already run no small risk, and undergone extraordinary labour. Poor Penny! I felt that fate had been against him! He deserved better than to be overtaken by us, after the energy displayed in the equipment of his squadron.  In the first watch the brigs \"Lady Franklin\" and \"Sophia\" were seen by us, fast between loose floe pieces, to seaward of which we continued to flirt. The \"Intrepid\" and \"Pioneer\" were now to be seen slyly trying their bows upon every bit of ice we could get near, without getting into a scrape with the commodore; and, from the ease with which they cut through the rotten stuff around our position, I already foresaw a fresh era in arctic history, and that the fine bows would soon beat the antediluvian \"bluffs\" out of the field.   _Thursday, 27th June, 1850_, found us still cruising about under canvas; northward and westward a body of dirty ice, fast decaying under a fierce sunlight, bergs in hundreds in every direction; and, dotted along the Greenland shore, a number of whalers fast in what is called \"Land water,\" ready to take the first opening. The barometer falling, we were ordered to make fast to icebergs, every one choosing his own. This operation is a very useful one in arctic regions, and saves much unnecessary wear and tear of men and vessel, when progress in the required direction is no longer possible.  The bergs, from their enormous depth, are usually aground, except at spring-tides, and the seaman thus succeeds in anchoring his vessel in 200 fm. water, without any other trouble than digging a hole in the iceberg, placing an anchor in it called an ice-anchor, which one man can lift, and, with a whale-line, his ship rides out under the lee of this natural breakwater, in severe gales, and often escapes being beset in a lee pack.  [Illustration]  Fastening to a berg has its risks and dangers; sometimes the first stroke of the man setting the ice-anchor, by its concussion causes the iceberg to break up, and the people so employed run great risk of being injured; at another time, vessels obliged to make fast under the steep side of a berg, have had pieces detach themselves from overhead, and injure materially the vessel and spars; and, again, the projecting masses, called tongues (which form under water the base of the berg), have been known to break off, and strike a vessel so severely as to sink her: all these risks are duly detailed by every arctic navigator, and the object always is, in fastening to an iceberg, to look for a side which is low and sloping, without any tongues under water. To such an one the Intrepid and Pioneer made fast, although the boat's crew that first reached it, in making a hole, were wetted by a projecting mass detaching itself with the first blow of the seaman's crowbar. A gale sprang up almost immediately, and during the night the Assistance blew adrift. Next day it abated, and the ice to the northward looked open.  In the evening one of Penny's vessels, the Sophia, joined us, and from her commander we soon heard of their hopes and disappointment. Directly after leaving Disco they fell in with the ice, and had fought their way the whole distance to their present position. The season was not promising, but forty-eight hours of a N.E. wind would do wonders, and I cordially partook of his opinion, that \"keeping the vessel's nose to the crack\" was the only way to get ahead in the arctic regions. The crews of the brigs were in rattling health and spirits. Having delivered him some letters and a number of parcels which, by great good luck, had not been landed at Uppernavik, Capt. Stewart returned to his chief, some eight miles northward of us, and we remained to watch progress.  [Headnote: _TOWING THE SHIPS._]   _Saturday, June 29th, 1850._--   _Monday, July 1st, 1850._--At last the hoped-for signal, \"take ships in tow,\" was made; and, with a leaping heart, we entered the lead, having the \"Resolute\" fast by the nose with a six-inch hawser. What looked impassable at ten miles' distance was an open lead when close to. Difficulties vanish when they are faced; and the very calm which rendered the whalers unable to take advantage of a loose pack, was just the thing for steamers. Away we went! past berg, past floe, winding in and out quietly, yet steadily!--and the whalers were soon astern. Penny, indefatigable, was seen struggling along the shore, with his boats ahead, towing, and every stitch of sail set to catch the lightest cat's paw: him too, however, we soon passed. The water ahead increased as we advanced, and we found, as is well known to be the case, that the pack-edge is always the tightest part of it.  Several whale-boats from the vessels astern were busy taking ducks' eggs from the islands, which seem to abound along the coast. When passing one of these islands that appeared remarkably steep, I was disagreeably surprised to feel the \"Pioneer\" strike against a sunken rock with some violence; she slipped off it, and then the \"Resolute\" gave herself a blow, which seemed to make every thing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24891"],["title","Stray Leaves from an Arctic Journal (#6)"],["body","again. Capt. Penny had a signal up warning us of the danger; but we were too busy to see it until afterwards, and then the want of wind prevented our ascertaining what was meant. After this accident we went very cautiously until the evening hour, when, having neared Cape Shackleton, and some thin ice showing itself, through which, at reduced speed, we could not tow the broad-bowed \"Resolute,\" she was cast off, and made fast to some land ice, and I proceeded on alone in the \"Pioneer\" to see what the prospect was further on.  Cutting through some rotten ice of about six inches in thickness, we reached water beyond it, and saw a belt of water, of no great width, extending along shore as far as the next headland, called Horse's-head. Picking up a boat belonging to the \"Chieftain\" whaler, which had been shooting and egging, I returned towards the \"Resolute\" with my intelligence, giving Cape Shackleton a close shave to avoid the ice which was setting against it from the westward, the whalemen whom I had on board expressing no small astonishment and delight at the way in which we screwed through the broken ice of nine-inch thickness. On reaching the squadron, I found it made fast for the night, and parties of officers preparing to start in different directions to shoot, and see what was to be seen, for, of course, our night was as light as the day of any other region.  To the \"Chieftain's\" doctor I, with others of the \"Pioneer,\" consigned what we flattered ourselves were our last letters, thinking that, now the steamers had got ahead, it was not likely the whalers would again be given an opportunity of communicating or overtaking us.  There is something in last letters painful and choking; and I remember that I hardly knew which feeling most predominated in my breast,--sorrow and regret for those friends I had left behind me, or hope and joyful anticipation of meeting those before us in the \"Erebus and Terror.\"  [Headnote: _CAPE SHACKLETON._]  At any rate, I gave vent to them by climbing the rocky summit of Cape Shackleton, and throwing off my jacket, let the cold breeze allay the excitement of my mind.  Nothing strikes the traveller in the north more strongly than the perceptible repose of Nature, although the sun is still illumining the heavens, during those hours termed night. We, of course, who were unaccustomed to the constant light, were restless and unable to sleep; but the inhabitants of these regions, as well as the animals, retire to rest with as much regularity as is done in more southern climes; and the subdued tints of the heavens, as well as the heavy banking of clouds in the neighbourhood of the sun, gives to the arctic summer night a quietude as marked as it is pleasant. Across Baffin's Bay there was ice! ice! ice! on every side, small faint streaks of water here and there in the distance, with one cheering strip of it winding snake-like along the coast as far as eye could reach. \"To-morrow!\" I exclaimed, \"we will be there.\" \"Yes!\" replied a friend, \"but if the breeze freshens, Penny will reach it to-night!\" And there, sure enough, were Penny's brigs sailing past our squadron, which showed no sign of vitality beyond that of the officer of the watch visiting the ice-anchors to see all was right. \"That fellow, Penny, is no sluggard!\" we muttered, \"and will yet give the screws a hard tussle to beat him.\"  A couple of hours rest, and having taken the ship in tow, we again proceeded, and at about seven o'clock on the morning of the 2d of July passed the \"Sophia,\" and shortly afterwards, the \"Lady Franklin.\" Alas! poor Penny, he had a light contrary wind to work against.  I do not think my memory can recall in the course of my wanderings any thing more novel or striking than the scenes through which we steamed this forenoon. The land of Greenland, so bold, so steep, and in places so grim, with the long fields of white glittering ice floating about on the cold blue sea, and our little vessels (for we looked pigmies beside the huge objects around us, whether cliff, berg, or glacier) stealing on so silently and quickly; the leadsman's song or the flap of wild fowl the only sounds to break the general stillness. One of the cliffs we skirted along was actually teeming with birds called \"loons:\" they might have been shot in tens of hundreds had we required them or time not pressed: they are considered remarkably good eating, and about the size and weight of an ordinary duck: to naturalists they are known by the name of guillemot, and were christened \"loons\" by the early Dutch navigators, in consequence of their stupidity. Numerous seals lay on the ice in the offing, and their great size astonished us.  As we advanced, a peculiarly conical island, in a broad and ice-encumbered bay, showed itself: it was \"the Sugar-Loaf Island\" of the whalers; and told us that, on rounding the farther headland, we should see the far-famed Devil's Thumb, the boundary of Melville Bay.  A block of ice brought us up after a tow of some twenty-five or thirty miles, and, each vessel picking up a convenient iceberg, we made fast to await an opening.  I landed to obtain a view from a small islet close to the \"Pioneer,\" and was rewarded by observing that the Duck Islands, a group some fifteen miles to seaward of us, had evidently a large space of open water around them, and broad _lanes_ extended from these in divers directions towards us, although, without retracing our steps, there was at present no direct road for us into this water.  Captain Penny, however, being astern, had struck to seaward, and was fast passing our position.  On the islands there were recent traces of both reindeer and bears; and I amused myself picking some pretty arctic flowers, such as anemones, poppies, and saxifrage, which grew in sheltered nooks amongst the rocks.  [Headnote: _A BEAR HUNT._]  Before leaving the vessel, a boat had been despatched to the headland where so many \"loons\" had been seen, to shoot for the ship's company's use: the other ships did likewise: they returned at about four o'clock next morning, and I was annoyed at being informed, without any birds, although all the powder and shot had been expended.  I sent for the captain of the forecastle, who had been away in charge of the sportsmen, and, with astonishment, asked how he had contrived to fire away one pound of powder and four of small shot, without bringing home some loons? Hanging his head, and looking uncommonly bashful, he answered, \"If you please, sir, we fired it all into a bear!\" \"Into a bear?\" I exclaimed, \"what! shoot a bear with No. 4 shot?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Abbot; \"and if it hadn't have been for two or three who were afeard of him, we would have brought him aboard, too.\" Sending my bear-hunting friend about his business for neglecting my orders to obtain fresh food for the crew, I afterward found out that on passing a small island between the \"Pioneer\" and the Loon Head, as the cliff was called, my boat's crew had observed a bear watching some seals, and it was voted immediately, that to be the first to bring a bear home, would immortalize the \"Pioneer.\"  A determined onslaught was therefore made on Bruin: No. 4 shot being poured into him most ruthlessly, he growled and snapped his teeth, trotted round the island, and was still followed and fired at, until, finding the fun all on one side, the brute plunged into the water, and swam for some broken-up ice; my heroes followed, and, for lack of ball, fired at him a waistcoat button and the blade of a knife, which, by great ingenuity, they had contrived to cram down one of their muskets; this very naturally, as they described it, \"made the beast jump again!\" he reached the ice, however, bleeding all over, but not severely injured; and whilst the bear was endeavouring to get on the floe, a spirited contest ensued between him and Old Abbot, the latter trying to become possessor of a skin, which the former gallantly defended.  Ammunition expended, and nothing but boat-hooks and stretchers left as defensive weapons, there seemed some chance of the tables being reversed, and the boat's crew very properly obliged the captain of the forecastle to beat a retreat; the bear, equally well pleased to be rid of such visitors, made off. \"Old Abbot,\" as he was styled, always, however, asserted, that if he had had his way, the bear would have been brought on board the \"Pioneer,\" and tamed to do a good deal of the dragging work of the sledges; and whenever he heard, in the winter, any of the young hands growling at the labour of sledging away snow or ice, he created a roar of laughter, by muttering, \"Ah! if you had taken my advice, we'd have had that 'ere bear to do this work for us!\"   _July 3d, 1850._--Penny, by taking another route, gave us the \"go by,\" and in the afternoon we started, taking an in-shore lane of water. The wind, however, had freshened up from the westward, and as we advanced, the ice was rapidly closing, the points of the floe-pieces forming \"bars,\" with holes of water between them. With the \"Pioneer's\" sharp bow, we broke through the first of these barriers, and carried the \"Resolute\" into \"a hole of water,\" as it is called. The next bar being broader, I attempted to force it by charging with the steamer, and after breaking up a portion of it, backed astern to allow the broken pieces to be removed; this being the first time this operation was performed, and much having to be learnt upon the feasibility of the different modes of applying steam-power against ice.  [Headnote: _ARCTIC SPORTING._]  We soon found ourselves surrounded with broken masses, which, owing to the want of men to remove it away into the open water astern, rendered advance or retreat, without injury to the propeller, almost impossible. Here, the paucity of men on board the steam vessels was severely felt: for until the \"Resolute\" was properly secured I could expect no assistance from her; and the \"Pioneer,\" therefore, had to do her best with half the"]]]
