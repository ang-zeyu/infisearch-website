Take His way, so quiet, so easy, and in a little while you will be taken to Him in a manner that will surprise you. Oh, if only you would try it! How soon you would see that I am telling you only too little, and that the experience would far surpass any description that could be given! What do you fear? Why do you not throw yourself at once into the arms of Love, who only stretched them out upon the cross in order to take you in? What risk can there be in trusting God, and abandoning yourself to Him? Oh, He will not deceive you, unless it be by giving you far more than you ever expected: while those who expect everything from themselves may well take to themselves the reproach which God utters by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope\" (Isa. lvii. 10).     CHAPTER XI.  OF REST IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD--ITS FRUITS--INWARD SILENCE--GOD COMMANDS IT--OUTWARD SILENCE.   The soul, being brought to this place, needs no other preparation than that of repose: for _the presence of God_ during the day, which is the great result of prayer, or rather prayer itself, begins to be _intuitive_ and _almost continual_. The soul is conscious of a deep inward happiness, and feels that God is in it more truly than it is in itself. It has only one thing to do in order to find God, which is to retire within itself. As soon as the eyes are closed, it finds itself in prayer.  It is astonished at this infinite happiness; there is carried on within it a conversation which outward things cannot interrupt. It might be said of this method of prayer, as was said of Wisdom, \"All good things together come to me with her\" (Wisdom of Solomon vii. 11), for virtue flows naturally into the soul, and is practised so easily, that it seems to be quite natural to it. It has within it a germ of life and fruitfulness, which gives it a facility for all good, and an insensibility to all evil. Let it then remain faithful, and seek no other frame of mind than that of simple rest. It has only to suffer itself to be filled with this divine effusion.  \"The Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before Him\" (Hab. ii. 20). The reason why inward silence is so necessary is, that Christ, being the eternal and essential Word, in order that He may be received into the soul, there must be a disposition corresponding with what He is. Now it is certain that in order to receive words we must listen. Hearing is the sense given to enable us to receive the words which are communicated to us. Hearing is rather a passive than an active sense, receiving, and not communicating. Christ being the Word which is to be communicated, the soul must be attentive to this Word which speaks within it.  This is why we are so often exhorted to listen to God, and to be attentive to His voice. Many passages might be quoted. I will be content to mention a few: \"Hearken unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation\" (Isa. li. 4). \"Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel\" (Isa. xlvi. 31). \"Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty\" (Ps. xlv. 10, 11).  We must _listen_ to God, and be attentive to Him, _forgetting ourselves_ and all self-interest. These two actions, or rather passions--for this condition is essentially a passive one--arouse in God a \"desire\" towards the \"beauty\" He has Himself communicated.  Outward silence is extremely necessary for the cultivation of inward silence, and it is impossible to acquire inward silence without having a love for silence and solitude.  God tells us by the mouth of His prophet, \"I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart\" (marginal reading of Hosea ii. 14).  To be inwardly occupied with God, and outwardly occupied with countless trifles, this is impossible.  It will be a small matter to pray, and to retire within ourselves for half an hour or an hour, if we do not retain the unction and the spirit of prayer during the day.     CHAPTER XII.  SELF-EXAMINATION AND CONFESSION.   Self-examination should always precede confession. Those who arrive at this degree should expose themselves to God, who will not fail to enlighten them, and to make known to them the nature of their faults. This examination must be conducted in peace and tranquillity, expecting more from God than from our own research the knowledge of our sins.  When we examine ourselves with an effort, we easily make mistakes. We \"call evil good, and good evil;\" and self-esteem easily deceives us. But when we remain exposed to the searching gaze of God, that Divine Sun brings to light even the smallest atoms. We must then, for self-examination, abandon ourselves utterly to God.  When we are in this degree of prayer, God is not slow to reveal to us all the faults we commit. We have no sooner sinned than we feel a burning reproach.  It is God Himself who conducts an examination which nothing escapes, and we have only to turn towards God, and suffer the pain and the correction which He gives. As this examination by God is continual, we can no longer examine ourselves; and if we are faithful to our abandonment to God, we shall soon be better examined by the divine light than we could be by all our own efforts. Experience will make this known. One thing which often causes astonishment to the soul is, that when it is conscious of a sin, and comes to confess it to God, instead of feeling regret and contrition, such as it formerly felt, a sweet and gentle love takes possession of it.  Not having experienced this before, it supposes that it ought to draw itself out of this condition to make a definite act of contrition. But it does not see that, by doing this, it would lose true contrition, which is this _intuitive love_, infinitely greater than anything it could create for itself. It is a higher action, which includes the others, with greater perfection, though these are not possessed distinctly.  We should not seek to do anything for ourselves when God acts more excellently in us and for us. It is hating sin as God hates it to hate it in this way. This love, which is the operation of God in the soul, is the purest of all love. All we have to do then is to remain as we are.  Another remarkable thing is, that we often forget our faults, and find it difficult to remember them; but this must not trouble us, for two reasons: The first, that this very forgetfulness is a proof that the sin has been atoned for, and it is better to forget all that concerns ourselves, that we may remember God alone. The second reason is, that God does not fail, whenever confession is needful, to show to the soul its greatest faults, for then it is He Himself who examines it.     CHAPTER XIII.  ON READING--VOCAL PRAYER--REQUESTS.   The proper manner of reading in this degree is, as soon as we feel attracted to meditation, to cease reading, and remain at rest.  The soul is no sooner called to inward silence, than it should cease to utter vocal prayers; saying but little at any time, and when it does say them, if it finds any difficulty, or feels itself drawn to silence, it should remain silent, and make no effort to pray, leaving itself to the guidance of the Spirit of God.  The soul will find that it cannot, as formerly, present definite requests to God. This need not surprise it, for it is now that \"the Spirit maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God. The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered\" (Rom. viii. 26, 27).  We must second the designs of God, which are to strip the soul of its own works, to substitute His in their place.  Let Him work then, and bind yourself to nothing of your own. However good it may appear to you, it cannot be so if it comes in the way of God's will for you. The will of God is preferable to all other good. Seek not your own interests, but live by abandonment and by faith.  It is here that _faith_ begins to operate wonderfully in the soul.     CHAPTER XIV.  THE FAULTS COMMITTED IN THIS DEGREE--DISTRACTIONS, TEMPTATIONS--THE COURSE TO BE PURSUED RESPECTING THEM.   As soon as we fall into a fault, or have wandered, we must turn again within ourselves; because this fault having turned us from God, we should as soon as possible turn towards Him, and suffer the penitence which He Himself will give.  It is of great importance that we should not be anxious about these faults, because the anxiety only springs from a secret pride and a love of our own excellence. We are troubled at feeling what we are.  If we become discouraged, we shall grow weaker yet; and reflection upon our faults produces a vexation which is worse than the sin itself.  A truly humble soul does not marvel at its weakness, and the more it perceives its wretchedness, the more it abandons itself to God, and seeks to remain near to Him, knowing how deeply it needs His help. God's own word to us is, \"I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye\" (Ps. xxxii. 8).  In distractions or temptations, instead of combating them directly, which would only serve to augment them, and to wean us from God, with whom alone we ought to be occupied, we should simply turn away from them, and draw nearer to God; as a little child, seeing a fierce animal approaching it, would not stay to fight it, nor even to look at it, but would run for shelter to its mother's arms, where it would be safe. \"God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early\" (Ps. xlvi. 5).  If we adopt any other course of action, if we attempt to attack our enemies in our weakness, we shall be wounded, even if we are not entirely defeated; but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24989"],["title","A Short Method Of Prayer (#5)"],["body","in the simple presence of God, we find ourselves immediately fortified.  This was what David did: he says, \"I have set the Lord always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope.\" It is also said by Moses, \"The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace\" (Exod. xiv. 14).     CHAPTER XV.  PRAYER AND SACRIFICE EXPLAINED BY THE SIMILITUDE OF A PERFUME--OUR ANNIHILATION IN THIS SACRIFICE--SOLIDITY AND FRUITFULNESS OF THIS PRAYER AS SET FORTH IN THE GOSPEL.   Prayer ought to be both petition and sacrifice.  Prayer, according to the testimony of St John, is an incense, whose perfume rises to God. Therefore it is said in the Revelation (chap. viii. 3), that an angel held a censer, which contained the incense of the prayers of saints.  Prayer is an outpouring of the heart in the presence of God. \"I have poured out my soul before the Lord,\" said the mother of Samuel (1 Sam. i. 15). Thus the prayers of the Magi at the feet of the infant Jesus in the stable of Bethlehem were signified by the incense which they offered.  Prayer is the heat of love, which melts and dissolves the soul, and carries it to God. In proportion as it melts, it gives out its odour, and this odour comes from the love which burns it.  This is what the Bride meant when she said, \"While the King sitteth at His table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof\" (Cant. i. 12). The table is the heart. When God is there, and we are kept near to Him, in His presence, this presence of God melts and dissolves the hardness of our hearts, and as they melt, they give forth their perfume. Therefore the Bridegroom, seeing His Bride thus melted by the speech of her Beloved, says, \"Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense?\" (Cant. iii. 6).  Thus the soul rises up towards its God. But in order to this, it must suffer itself to be destroyed and annihilated by the force of love. This is a state of _sacrifice_ essential to the Christian religion, by which the soul suffers itself to be destroyed and annihilated to render homage to the sovereignty of God; as it is written, \"The power of the Lord is great, and He is honoured of the lowly\" (Ecclus. iii. 20). And the destruction of our own being confesses the sovereign being of God.  We must cease to be, so that the Spirit of the Word may be in us. In order that He may come to us, we must yield our life to Him, and die to self that He may live in us, and that we being dead, our life may be hidden with Christ in God (Col. iii. 3).  \"Come unto me,\" says God, \"all ye that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits\" (Ecclus. xxiv. 19). But how can we be filled with God? Only by being emptied of self, and going out of ourselves in order to be lost in Him.  Now, this can never be brought about except by our becoming nothing. Nothingness is true prayer, which renders to God \"honour, and glory, and power, for ever and ever\" (Rev. v. 13).  This prayer is the prayer of truth. It is worshipping the Father in spirit and in truth. In _spirit_, because we are by it drawn out of our human and carnal action, to enter into the purity of the Spirit, who prays in us; and in _truth_, because the soul is led into the truth of the ALL of God, and the NOTHING of the creature.  There are but these two truths, the ALL and the NOTHING. All the rest is untruth.  We can only honour the ALL of God by our NOTHINGNESS; and we have no sooner become nothing, than God, who will not suffer us to be empty, fills us with Himself. Oh, if all knew the blessings which come to the soul by this prayer, they would be satisfied with no others: it is the pearl of great price; it is the hidden treasure. He who finds it gladly sells all that he has to buy it (Matt. xiii. 44, 46). It is the well of living water, which springs up into everlasting life (John iv. 14). It is the practice of the pure maxims of the gospel.  Does not Christ Himself tell us that the kingdom of God is within us? (Luke xvii. 21). This kingdom is set up in two ways. The first is, when God is so thoroughly master of us that nothing resists Him: then our heart is truly His kingdom. The other way is, that by possessing God, who is the sovereign Lord, we possess the kingdom of God, which is the height of felicity, and the end for which we were created. As it has been said, _to serve God is to reign_.  The end for which we were created is to enjoy God in this life, and men do not believe it!     CHAPTER XVI.  THIS STATE OF PRAYER NOT ONE OF IDLENESS, BUT OF NOBLE ACTION, WROUGHT BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, AND IN DEPENDENCE UPON HIM--THE COMMUNICATION OF HIS LIFE AND UNION.   Some people, hearing of the prayer of silence, have wrongly imagined that the soul remains _inactive_, _lifeless_, and _without movement_.  But the truth is, that its action is more noble and more extensive than it ever was before it entered this degree, since it is moved by God Himself, and acted upon by His Spirit. St Paul desires that we should be _led by the Spirit of God_ (Rom. viii. 14). I do not say that there must be no action, but that we must act in dependence upon the divine movement. This is admirably set forth by Ezekiel. The prophet saw wheels which had the spirit of life, and wherever this spirit was to go, they went; they went on, or stood, or were lifted up, as they were moved, for the spirit of life was in them: but they never went back (see Ezek. i. 19-21). It should be the same with the soul: it should suffer itself to be moved and guided by the living Spirit who is in it, following His direction, and no other. Now this Spirit will never lead it to go backwards, that is, to reflect upon the creature, or to lean upon itself, but always to go forward, pressing continually towards the mark.  This action of the soul is a restful action. When it acts of itself, it acts with effort; and is therefore more conscious of its action. But when it acts in dependence upon the Spirit of grace, its action is so free, so easy, so natural, that it does not seem to act at all. \"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me\" (Ps. xviii. 19).  As soon as the soul has commenced its course towards its centre,[2] from that moment its action becomes vigorous--that is, its course towards the centre which attracts it, which infinitely surpasses the velocity of any other movement.    2. See chap. ix.  It is action then, but an action so _noble_, so _peaceful_, so _tranquil_, that it seems to the soul as though it were not acting at all; because it rests, as it were, naturally. When a wheel is only turning with a moderate speed, it can easily be distinguished; but when it goes quickly, no part of it can be distinctly seen. So the soul which remains at rest in God has an action infinitely noble and exalted, yet very peaceful. The greater its peace, the greater is its velocity, because it is abandoned to the Spirit, who moves it and makes it act. This Spirit is God Himself, who draws us, and in drawing makes us run to Him, as the Bride well knew when she said, \"Draw me, we will run\" (Cant. i. 4). Draw me, O my Divine Centre, by my inmost heart: my powers and my sensibilities will run at Thy attraction! This attraction alone is a balm which heals me, and a perfume which draws. \"We will run,\" she says, \"because of the savour of Thy good ointments.\" This attracting virtue is _very strong_ but the soul follows it _very gladly_; and as it is equally strong and sweet, it attracts by its strength and delights by its sweetness.  The Bride says, \"Draw me, we will run.\" She speaks of herself, and to herself: \"Draw _me_;\" there is the unity of the object which is attracted: \"_We_ will run;\" there is the correspondence of all the powers and sensibilities which follow in the train of the centre of the heart.  It is not then a question of remaining in idleness, but of acting _in dependence upon the Spirit of God_, who animates us, since it is in Him that \"we live, and move, and have our being\" (Acts xvii. 23). This calm dependence upon the Spirit of God is absolutely necessary, and causes the soul in a short time to attain the simplicity and unity in which it was created. It was created one and simple, like God. In order, then, to answer the end of our creation, we must quit the multiplicity of our own actions, to enter into the simplicity and unity of God, in whose image we were created (Gen. i. 27). The Spirit of God is \"one only,\" \"yet manifold\" (Wisdom of Solomon vii. 22), and its unity does not prevent its multiplicity. We enter into God's unity when we are united to His Spirit, because then we have the same Spirit that He has; and we are multiplied outwardly, as regards His dispositions, without leaving the unity.  So that, as God acts infinitely, and we are of one spirit with Him, we act much more than we could do by our own action. We must suffer ourselves to be guided by Wisdom. This \"Wisdom\" is more moving than any motion (Wisdom of Solomon vii. 24). Let us, then, remain in dependence upon His action, and our action will be vigorous indeed.  \"All things were made by (the Word); and without Him was not anything made that was made\" (John i. 3). God, in creating us, created us in His image, after His likeness (Gen. i. 26). He gave to us the Spirit of the Word by the breath of life (Gen. ii. 7), which He breathed into us when we were created in the image of God, by the participation of the life of the Word, who is the image of His Father. Now this life is one, simple, pure, intimate, and fruitful.  The devil having disfigured this beautiful image, it became necessary that this same Word, whose breath had been breathed into us at our creation, should come to restore it. It was necessary that it should be He, because He is the image of the Father; and a defaced image cannot be repaired by its own action, but by the action of him who seeks"]]]
