He said she was the _Sorella di Ninu_, returning from Naples, where she had been with a cargo of wine.  He knew because she belonged to his cousin Vanni, who was a wine merchant and, if I would give up a morning's sketching, he would give up a morning's work, take me down to the port, introduce me to his cousin and show me over the ship.  Accordingly next morning Carmelo got leave from his padrone and drove us down the zig-zags among the flowers while Peppino told me about his cousin.  His father had two brothers, one was the father of Vanni and used to keep a small wine shop down in the port and Vanni, who had a voice, studied singing and went on the opera stage.  The other brother emigrated to America and never married.  Very little was heard of him, except that he was engaged in some speculative business, until at last news came of his death.  Had he died six months before, he would have left nothing, but it happened that the markets were favourable and he died rich.  After the usual delays, his money came and was divided between his surviving brothers.  Vanni's father enlarged the wine shop, bought vineyards and a ship, took his son away from the stage and sent him to the University.  In course of time he enlarged his business and took Vanni into partnership.  Peppino's father gave up being sagrestano, bought vineyards and the Albergo della Madonna (con giardino) and educated his son.  The part of Peppino's education that was most useful to him was his two years in England, and that did not cost his father anything, for he would only take money enough for the journey and all the time he was away he kept himself and saved, so that he not only repaid his father and paid for his journey home but had money in the bank.  By this time we had arrived at the quay and Peppino went off to his uncle's shop for information as to approaching the _Sorella di Ninu_, leaving me alone with Carmelo.  He seized the opportunity.  \"I have been to see you several times because I wanted to tell you that I also have been in prison.\"  \"Hullo! Carmelo,\" I said, \"have you been trying to murder your father?\"  \"No,\" he said, \"it was not my father.  It was a friend.  We quarrelled. I drew my knife and stabbed him in the arm.  It happened last year.\"  I sympathized as well as I could and assured him that it should make no difference in the relations between us.  Why did I say this?  Why was I so indulgent towards Carmelo and so implacable to Rosario?  It seems as though an Englishman may also be a mass of contradictions.  It is true that parricide is perhaps the most repulsive form that murder can take, but I do not think this had anything to do with it, for ordinary murder is sufficiently repulsive.  I believe I was influenced by a conversation we had had during our last expedition; Carmelo had told me that he intended soon to leave private service, to marry and go into partnership with Rosario.  \"But, Carmelo,\" I had objected, \"would not that be rather risky?  Don't you remember that Rosario has been to prison for trying to kill your father?\"  \"Oh, that all happened a long time ago and Rosario has married and settled down since then.\"  Evidently Carmelo had thought this over and had felt uncomfortable that I should shun Rosario for being a jail-bird and not shun him who was one also.  It seemed to indicate considerable delicacy of feeling on his part and I was pleased with him for taking so much trouble to get the confession off his chest.  Whereas Rosario had treated his disgrazia as merely an annoying little accident that might happen to any gentleman.  Peppino returned, stood on the quay and shouted to the ships; presently a small boat containing Vanni and a sailor detached herself from the confusion and rowed to our feet.  I was introduced and, amid the usual compliments, we took our seats and glided past the _Sacro Cuore_, the _Due Sorelle_, the _Divina Provvidenza_, the _Maria Concetta_, the _Stella Maris_, the _La Pace_, the _Indipendente_, the _Nuova Bambina_ and many more.  Peppino called my attention to the names of the ships and said how commonplace and dull they were after the romantic names he had seen on the beach at Brighton.  He gave, as an instance, _Pride of the Ocean_, which I remembered having often seen there; it was all very well, but somehow it had never impressed me as hitting the bull's-eye of romance.  During their voyage through time the words of one's own language become barnacled over with associations so that we cannot see them in their naked purity as we see the words of a foreign tongue.  I translated _Pride of the Ocean_ into _Vanto del Mare_ and offered it to Peppino; it seemed to me to gain, but he said I had knocked all the poetry out of it.  One of the ships was the _Riunione dei due Fratelli_. I inquired whether the brothers had quarrelled and made it up.  \"Yes,\" said he, \"that is the worst of family quarrels; they do not last.\"  \"What do you mean, Peppino?  Surely it is better for brothers to be friends than to quarrel?\"  \"If to be friends inside also, then is it a good thing and much better; but look here, excuse me; the brothers are quarrelling and fighting and are failing to kill each others and the parents are telling to don't be quarrelling and the brothers are telling that they would be quarrelling and the parents are telling to don't be stupid and to embrace and became friends and the brothers are telling, Go away, parents, and to leave alone to be quarrelling in peace.  But it is too difficult and many months are passing and the brothers are--please, what is stanchi?  Excuse me, it is fatigued, and are embracing to make pleasure to the parents and to make riunione outside and to baptize the ship, but inside it is riunione not at all.  It is to kiss with the lips and the heart is hating each others.  This is not a good thing.\"  The boat with the name that pleased me best was not there.  Peppino told me about it: it belonged to him before the money came from America and he used it to ferry tourists across the bay and into the bowels of the promontory through the mouth of a grotto where the reflected lights are lovely on a sunny day; he called it the _Anime del Purgatorio_.  This would have been just the morning to visit the caves, for there were no clouds.  We stood on the deck of the _Sorella di Ninu_, looking up through the brown masts and the rigging into the blue sky, and watching the gulls as they glided and circled above us and turned their white wings to the sun.  Vanni did the honours of his ship, showed us his barrels and casks, nearly all empty now, and made us look down into the hold where there was a cask capable of holding, I forget how much, but it was so big that it could never have been got into the ship after it was made, so it had to be built inside.  Then we must taste his wine, of which he still had some in one of the casks, and the captain brought tumblers and another queer-shaped glass with a string round its rim in which to fetch the wine up; it was about the size and shape of a fir-cone, the broad upper part being hollow to hold the wine, and the pointed lower part solid.  The captain held it by the string and dropped it neatly down through the bung-hole, as one drops a bucket into a well; its heavy point sank through the wine without any of that swishing and swashing which happens with a flat-bottomed, buoyant, wooden bucket, and he drew it up full and gleaming like a jewel.  The first lot was used to rinse the tumblers inside and out and then thrown overboard, sparkling and flashing in the sunlight as it fell into the sea.  The taster was lowered again and the tumblers filled.  Vanni, seeing I admired the taster, wanted to give it to me, but it was the only one he had and was in constant use when customers came to the ship, so I declined it and he promised to bring one for me next time his ship made a voyage; in the meantime I took one of the tumblers as a ricordo.  Then we went into the captain's cabin and sat round his table listening to his stories and smoking cigarettes.  Every now and then a silence came over us, broken occasionally by one of us saying suddenly--  \"Ebbene, siamo qua!\"  (\"Well, here we are!\")  This sort of thing formerly used to make me feel nervous; it was as though I had failed to entertain my friends or as though they had given up the hope of entertaining me.  After experiencing it several times, however, I came to take a different and more accurate view.  There was no occasion to do or say anything.  We were enjoying one another's society.  Vanni told us he was thinking of taking a cargo of Marsala to England and what would the English people say to it?  Now the Marsala was very good and, according to Vanni, could be put upon the market at a very low price, but I foresaw difficulties.  Knowing that he had sung in opera in Naples, Palermo, Malta and many other places, I asked if he liked music. He said he adored it.  Music, he declared, was the most precious gift of God to man--more precious even than poetry.  He had his box at the opera and always occupied it during the season.  And he enjoyed music of all kinds, not only the modern operas of Mascagni, Puccini and so on, but also the old music of Verdi, Donizetti and Bellini.  I asked if he did not like _Le Nozze di Figaro_.  He had never heard of it, nor of _Don Giovanni_, nor of _Fidelio_.  He had heard the names of Beethoven and Mozart, but not of Handel, Schubert or Brahms.  He had heard also of Wagner, but had never heard any of his music.  I was not surprised he should not have heard of those composers who are not famous for operas, nor by his odd list of so-called old musicians, but I was surprised that he should place music so decidedly above poetry. I said it appeared to me he had practically expressed the opinion that Donizetti was a more precious gift of God to man than Dante.  Put like"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],["title","Diversions in Sicily (#7)"],["body",", he did not hold to what he had said and confessed he had been speaking without due consideration.  But Peppino said that in some respects Donizetti was a better man than Dante; he was smoother and better tempered, \"and many things like this.\"  Peppino had been brought up, like every Italian, to worship Dante, but when he went to London and mastered the English language, when he began to read our literature and to think for himself, then he saw that Dante was \"un falso idolo.\"  Every nation gets the poet she deserves and Italy has her faults; but what, asked Peppino, what has Italy done to deserve her dreary Dante?  On the other hand, with all his admiration for England, he could hardly believe that we really do deserve our Shakespeare.  I was beginning to feel giddy, as though the _Sorella di Ninu_, instead of being quietly in port, was out on the tumbling ocean in a sudden gale, so very unusual is it to hear such opinions in Italy.  But Peppino is full of surprises.  To recover my balance I turned the conversation back to the wine, taking my way through the music and telling them that in England we thought very highly of the Austrian and German composers, and asking Vanni if he would recommend any one to introduce their compositions into Sicily.  He replied that if it was pleasing music it might be successful, but that if it was very different from Italian music it would hardly pay to bring it over until the people had been educated. I feared it would be the same with the wine.  He must first educate us to forsake our old friends, beer, whisky and tea, before he could create a market on which he could put his Marsala.  Driving back, I told Peppino about the lottery at Castelvetrano and how my numbers had lost.  He inquired whether my birthday fell during the week I bought the ticket.  It did not.  \"Then,\" said he, \"of course you could not be winning and Angelo very stupid to let you play those numbers.\"  It seems that numbers are no good unless they are connected with something that happens to you during the week.  This explained why at Selinunte the brigadier had discarded the price of my clothes, which was not his concern but mine and belonged to the week in which I had bought them, and preferred to play the number that fell from the cigarettes, of which he was at the moment actually smoking one.  \"If there shall be a railway accident,\" continued Peppino, \"on Thursday night, then shall there be going plenty much people and shall sleep in the ground to be first on Friday morning, because the office shall shut early to take the papers to Palermo to turn the wheel the Saturday.  And if to come out the number, the people shall be gaining many money, but if to don't come out, shall be gaining no money.  This is not a good thing.  \"They think it is fortunate the--please, what is sogno?  Excuse me, it is the dream.  But it must be the dream in the week you play.  When the man in the dream shall be coming from the other world and shall be saying, 'Please you, play this number,' then they believe you shall certainly win.  But if to play the number, very uncertain to win.\"  They live in a state of wild hope after buying their tickets until the numbers are declared and, the odds being enormously in favour of the government, the gamblers usually lose.  Then they live in a state of miserable despair until the possession of a few soldi, the happening of something remarkable, or merely the recollection of the departed joys of hope compared with present actual depression, urges them to try their luck again.  So that the gambler's life consists of alternations of feverish expectation and maddening dejection.  \"This is not a good thing\"; but it is a worse thing for the gambler who wins.  He sees how easy it is and is encouraged to believe he can do it every time; in his exaltation he stakes again and loses all his winnings, instead of only a few soldi.  If he does not do this he spends the money in treating his friends and getting into debt over it and has to pawn his watch.  So that the Genovese, by way of wishing his enemy ill-luck, while appearing to observe the proprieties, says to him--  \"Ti auguro un' ambo.\"  (\"I hope you may win an ambo.\")  Peppino does not approve of the lottery, yet he has not made up his mind that it ought to be abolished.  It certainly does harm, but so deep is the natural instinct for gambling that innumerable private lotteries would spring up to replace it, and they would do far more mischief, because they would be in the hands of rogues, whereas the government manages the affair quite honestly.  The government pays no attention to dreams or ladies in white dresses or anything that happens during the week; it bases its calculations on the mathematical theory of chances, and gathers in the soldi week after week, so that it makes an annual profit of about three million sterling.  Besides, if people are willing to pay for the pleasure of a week of hope, why should they not be allowed to do so?  The uneducated as a class ought to contribute to the expenses of governing their country, and the lottery is a sure and convenient way of collecting their contributions.  It is literally what it is often called--La tassa sull' ignoranza.  (The tax upon ignorance.)  Peppino even uses the lottery himself, but in a way of his own.  He chooses two numbers every week, according to what occurs to him as though he were going in for an ambo and, instead of buying a ticket, puts four soldi into an earthenware money-box.  The numbers he has chosen do not come out and he considers that he has won his four soldi and has put them by.  In this way he has accumulated several money-boxes full, and if ever his numbers come out he intends to break his boxes and distribute the contents among the deserving poor.  As a way of making money Peppino prefers the course of always doing whatever there is to be done in the house and in the vineyard.  A few years ago his father's vines were suffering from disease; he made inquiries, studied the subject, ascertained the best course to pursue and, with his own hands and some little assistance, rooted up all the plants and laid down American vines, with the result that the yield is now more than double what it ever was before.  And this he thinks was a great deal better than losing money week after week in the lottery, not only because of the result, but because of the interest he took in the work.  In fact, he attends to his own business and finds every moment of the day occupied.  He says--  \"Always to begin one thing before to finish some other thing, this is the good life.\"  Certainly it seems to agree with him.  There is not much the matter with Peppino's health nor with his banking account nor with his conscience, so far as I can judge.  Every one in the town is fond of him and he is always happy and ready to do any one a good turn.  Indeed, his popularity is the only thing that causes me any uneasiness about him.  There is generally something wrong about a man who has no enemies--but there are exceptions to every rule.  The poor professor, on the other hand, has at least one enemy and that the worst a man can have, namely himself.  The evening before he went away he took me into his confidence and consulted me about his future and his prospects.  He is married, but his wife is out of her mind, and he has three sons, all doing badly, one of them very badly.  He told me he was not at the moment employed as professor, he was living on his patrimony which consisted of a few acres of vines; he was gradually selling his land and spending the proceeds, and he thought this the best plan because the vines were all diseased and did not bring him in enough money to keep himself and his family.  Should I recommend him to come to England, learn English and try to keep himself by the exercise of his profession?  It was like Vanni's idea of bringing his wine to England.  I could only say I was afraid we already had enough professors.  Then he thought he might write and earn a little money that way; he had read all Sir Walter Scott's novels in a translation--thirty-two volumes I think he said; he admired them immensely and was thinking of writing a romance; he had in fact an idea for one, and would I be so good as to give him my opinion about it?  A young lady is desired by her father to marry a man she does not love, a rich man, much older than herself.  She refuses, but, later on, consents to make the sacrifice.  After a year of unhappy married life she meets a man of her own age, falls in love with him, and one day her husband surprises them together, in his rage kills them both and commits suicide.  \"Now,\" said the professor, \"what do you think of my theme?\"  I said that, so far as I could remember Sir Walter Scott's novels at the moment, they contained nothing from which any one could say he had taken his plot which, of course, was greatly to his credit on the score of originality, but I begged to be allowed to defer giving any further opinion until he had finished the work; so much depends upon the way in which these things are carried out.  He had also written a poem entitled _Completo_, of which he gave me a copy.  It was, he said, \"un grido dell' anima.\"  He had not found a publisher for it yet, but if I would translate it into English and get it published in London, I could send him any profits that might accrue.  I showed it to Peppino who swore he remembered something very like it in an Italian magazine and that the professor had had nothing to do with it beyond copying it.  I translated it without rhymes, the professor not having gone to that expense.  I have not offered the result to any English publisher, none of them would receive it as Peppino did when I showed it to him.  He said I had performed a miracle, that I had converted a few lines of drivelling nonsense--just the sort of stuff that would attract the professor--into a masterpiece.  But I am afraid the prestige of the"]]]
