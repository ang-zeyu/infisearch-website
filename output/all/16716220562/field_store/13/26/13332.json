What is it then? \"Simply lack of self-esteem\" I would say if there was no phrenologist near to correct me, and point out that well-developed hump at the extreme southern and heavenward portion of my Morgan head. Self-esteem or not, Mr. Phrenologist, the result is, that Miriam is by far the best performer in Baton Rouge, and I would rank forty-third even in the delectable village of Jackson.  And yet I must have some ear for music. To \"know as many songs as Sarah\" is a family proverb; not very difficult songs, or very beautiful ones, to be sure, besides being very indifferently sung; but the tunes _will_ run in my head, and it must take _some_ ear to catch them. People say to me, \"Of course you play?\" to which I invariably respond, \"Oh, no, but Miriam plays beautifully!\" \"You sing, I believe?\" \"Not at all--except for father\" (that is what I used to say)--\"and the children. But _Miriam_ sings.\" \"You are fond of dancing?\" \"Very; but I cannot dance as well as Miriam.\" \"Of course, you are fond of society?\" \"No, indeed! Miriam is, and she goes to all the parties and returns all the visits for me.\" The consequence is, that if the person who questions is a stranger, he goes off satisfied that \"that Miriam must be a great girl; but that little sister of hers--! Well! a _prig_, to say the least!\"  So it is Miriam catches all my fish--and so it is, too, that it is not raining, and I'm off.                                                            April 7th.  Until that dreary 1861, I had no idea of sorrow or grief.... How I love to think of myself at that time! Not as _myself_, but as some happy, careless child who danced through life, loving God's whole world too much to love any particular one, outside of her own family. She was more childish then--yet I like her for all her folly; I can say it now, for she is as dead as though she was lying underground.  Now do not imagine that Sarah has become an aged lady in the fifteen months that have elapsed since, for it is no such thing; her heart does ache occasionally, but that is a secret between her and this little rosewood furnished room; and when she gets over it, there is no one more fond of making wheelbarrows of the children, or of catching Charlie or mother by the foot and making them play lame chicken.... Now all this done by a young lady who remembers eighteen months ago with so much regret that she has lost so much of her high spirits--might argue that her spirits were before tremendous; and yet they were not. That other Sarah was ladylike, I am sure, in her wildest moments, but there is something hurried and boisterous in this one's tricks that reminds me of some one who is making a merit of being jolly under depressing circumstances. No! that is not a nice Sarah now, to _my_ taste.  The commencement of '61 promised much pleasure for the rest of the year, and though Secession was talked about, I do not believe any one anticipated the war that has been desolating our country ever since, with no prospect of terminating for some time to come. True the garrison was taken, but then several pleasant officers of the Louisiana army were stationed there, and made quite an agreeable addition to our small parties, and we did not think for a moment that trouble would grow out of it--at least, we girls did not. Next Louisiana seceded, but still we did not trouble ourselves with gloomy anticipations, for many strangers visited the town, and our parties, rides, and walks grew gayer and more frequent.  One little party--shall I ever forget it?--was on the 9th of March, I think; such an odd, funny little party! Such queer things happened! What a fool Mr. McG---- made of himself! Even more so than usual. But hush! It's not fair to laugh at a lady--under peculiar circumstances. And he tried so hard to make himself agreeable, poor fellow, that I ought to like him for being so obedient to my commands. \"Say something new; something funny,\" I said, tired of a subject on which he had been expatiating all the evening; for I had taken a long ride with him before sunset, he had escorted me to Mrs. Brunot's, and here he was still at my side, and his conversation did not interest me. To hear, with him, was to obey. \"Something funny? Well--\" here he commenced telling something about somebody, the fun of which seemed to consist in the somebody's having \"knocked his _shins_\" against something else. I only listened to the latter part; I was bored, and showed it. \"Shins!\" was I to laugh at such a story?                                                           April 12th.  Day before yesterday, just about this time of evening, as I came home from the graveyard, Jimmy unexpectedly came in. Ever since the 12th of February he has been waiting on the Yankees' pleasure, in the Mississippi, at all places below Columbus, and having been under fire for thirteen days at Tiptonville, Island No. 10 having surrendered Monday night; and Commodore Hollins thinking it high time to take possession of the ironclad ram at New Orleans, and give them a small party below the forts, he carried off his little aide from the McRae Tuesday morning, and left him here Thursday evening, to our infinite delight, for we felt as though we would never again see our dear little Jimmy. He has grown so tall, and stout, that it is really astonishing, considering the short time he has been away.... To our great distress, he jumped up from dinner, and declared he must go to the city on the very next boat. Commodore Hollins would need him, he must be at his post, etc., and in twenty minutes he was off, the rascal, before we could believe he had been here at all. There is something in his eye that reminds me of Harry, and tells me that, like Hal, he will die young.  And these days that are going by remind me of Hal, too. I am walking in our footsteps of last year. The eighth was the day we gave him a party, on his return home. I see him so distinctly standing near the pier table, talking to Mr. Sparks, whom he had met only that morning, and who, three weeks after, had Harry's blood upon his hands. He is a murderer now, without aim or object in life, as before; with only one desire--to die--and death still flees from him, and he Dares not rid himself of life.  All those dancing there that night have undergone trial and affliction since. Father is dead, and Harry. Mr. Trezevant lies at Corinth with his skull fractured by a bullet; every young man there has been in at least one battle since, and every woman has cried over her son, brother, or sweetheart, going away to the wars, or lying sick and wounded. And yet we danced that night, and never thought of bloodshed! The week before Louisiana seceded, Jack Wheat stayed with us, and we all liked him so much, and he thought so much of us;--and last week--a week ago to-day--he was killed on the battle-field of Shiloh.                                                           April 16th.  Among the many who visited us, in the beginning of 1861, there was Mr. Bradford. I took a dislike to him the first time I ever saw him, and, being accustomed to say just what I pleased to all the other gentlemen, tried it with him. It was at dinner, and for a long while I had the advantage, and though father would sometimes look grave, Gibbes, and all at my end of the table, would scream with laughter. At last Mr. Bradford commenced to retaliate, and my dislike changed into respect for a man who could make an excellent repartee with perfect good-breeding; and after dinner, when the others took their leave, and he asked permission to remain,--during his visit, which lasted until ten o'clock, he had gone over such a variety of subjects, conversing so well upon all, that Miriam and I were so interested that we forgot to have the gas lit!                                                           April 17th.  And another was silly little Mr. B----r, my little golden calf. What a--don't call names! I owe him a grudge for \"cold hands,\" and the other day, when I heard of his being wounded at Shiloh, I could not help laughing a little at Tom B----r's being hurt. What was the use of throwing a nice, big cannon ball, that might have knocked a man down, away on that poor little fellow, when a pea from a popgun would have made the same impression? Not but what he is brave, but little Mr. B----r is so soft.  Then there was that rattle-brain Mr. T----t who, commencing one subject, never ceased speaking until he had touched on all. One evening he came in talking, and never paused even for a reply until he bowed himself out, talking still, when Mr. Bradford, who had been forced to silence as well as the rest, threw himself back with a sigh of relief and exclaimed, \"This man talks like a woman!\" I thought it the best description of Mr. T----t's conversation I had ever heard. It was all on the surface, no pretensions to anything except to put the greatest possible number of words of no meaning in one sentence, while speaking of the most trivial thing. Night or day, Mr. T----t never passed home without crying out to me, \"_Ces jolis yeux bleus!_\" and if the parlor were brightly lighted so that all from the street might see us, and be invisible to us themselves, I always nodded my head to the outer darkness and laughed, no matter who was present, though it sometimes created remark. You see, I knew the joke. Coming from a party escorted by Mr. B----r, Miriam by Mr. T----t,[1] we had to wait a long time before Rose opened the door, which interval I employed in dancing up and down the gallery--followed by my cavalier--singing,--      \"Mes jolis yeux bleus,     Bleus comme les cieux,     Mes jolis yeux bleus     Ont ravi son âme,\" etc.;  which naïve remark Mr. B----r, not speaking French, lost entirely, and Mr. T----t endorsed it with his approbation and belief in it, and ever afterwards called me \"_Ces jolis yeux bleus_.\"        [1] Note added at the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25004"],["title","A Confederate Girl's Diary (#3)"],["body","time: \"O propriety! Gibbes and Lydia were       with us too.\"                                                     April 19th, 1862.  Another date in Hal's short history! I see myself walking home with Mr. McG---- just after sundown, meeting Miriam and Dr. Woods at the gate; only that was a Friday instead of a Saturday, as this. From the other side, Mr. Sparks comes up and joins us. We stand talking in the bright moonlight which makes Miriam look white and statue-like. I am holding roses in my hand, in return for which one little pansy has been begged from my garden, and is now figuring as a shirt-stud. I turn to speak to that man of whom I said to Dr. Woods, before I even knew his name, \"Who is this man who passes here so constantly? I feel that I shall hate him to my dying day.\" He told me his name was Sparks, a good, harmless fellow, etc. And afterwards, when I did know him, [Dr. Woods] would ask every time we met, \"Well! do you hate Sparks yet?\" I could not really hate any one in my heart, so I always answered, \"He is a good-natured fool, but I will hate him yet.\" But even now I cannot: my only feeling is intense pity for the man who has dealt us so severe a blow; who made my dear father bow his gray head, and shed such bitter tears.  The moon is rising still higher now, and people are hurrying to the grand Meeting, where the state of the country is to be discussed, and the three young men bow and hurry off, too. Later, at eleven o'clock, Miriam and I are up at Lydia's waiting (until the boat comes) with Miss Comstock who is going away. As usual, I am teasing and romping by turns. Harry suddenly stands in the parlor door, looking very grave, and very quiet. He is holding father's stick in his hand, and says he has come to take us over home. I was laughing still, so I said, \"Wait,\" while I prepared for some last piece of folly, but he smiled for the first time, and throwing his arm around me, said, \"Come home, you rogue!\" and laughing still, I followed him.  He left us in the hall, saying he must go to Charlie's a moment, but to leave the door open for him. So we went up, and I ran in his room, and lighted his gas for him, as I did every night when we went up together. In a little while I heard him come in and go to his room. I knew nothing then; but next day, going into mother's room, I saw him standing before the glass door of her armoir, looking at a black coat he had on. Involuntarily I cried out, \"Oh, don't, Hal!\" \"Don't what? Isn't it a nice coat?\" he asked. \"Yes; but it is buttoned up to the throat, and I don't like to see it. It looks--\" here I went out as abruptly as I came in; that black coat so tightly buttoned troubled me.  He came to our room after a while and said he was going ten miles out in the country for a few days. I begged him to stay, and reproached him for going away so soon after he had come home. But he said he must, adding, \"Perhaps I am tired of you, and want to see something new. I'll be so glad to get back in a few days.\" Father said yes, he must go, so he went without any further explanation.  Walking out to Mr. Davidson's that evening, Lydia and I sat down on a fallen rail beyond the Catholic graveyard, and there she told me what had happened. The night before, sitting on Dr. Woods's gallery, with six or eight others who had been singing, Hal called on Mr. Henderson to sing. He complied by singing one that was not nice.[2] Old Mr. Sparks got up to leave, and Hal said, \"I hope we are not disturbing you?\" No, he said he was tired and would go home. As soon as he was gone, his son, who I have since _heard_ was under the influence of opium,--though Hal always maintained that he was not,--said it was a shame to disturb his poor old father. Hal answered, \"You heard what he said. We did _not_ disturb him.\" \"You are a liar!\" the other cried. That is a name that none of our family has either merited or borne with; and quick as thought Hal sprang to his feet and struck him across the face with the walking-stick he held. The blow sent the lower part across the balcony in the street, as the spring was loosened by it, while the upper part, to which was fastened the sword--for it was father's sword-cane--remained in his hand. I doubt that he ever before knew the cane could come apart. Certainly he did not perceive it, until the other whined piteously he was taking advantage over an unarmed man; when, cursing him, he (Harry) threw it after the body of the cane, and said, \"_Now_ we are equal.\" The other's answer was to draw a knife,[3] and was about to plunge it into Harry, who disdained to flinch, when Mr. Henderson threw himself on Mr. Sparks and dragged him off.        [2] Note by Mrs. Dawson in 1896: \"Annie Laurie!\"        [3] Note by Mrs. Dawson: Bowie knife.  It was a little while after that Harry came for us. The consequence of this was a challenge from Mr. Sparks in the morning, which was accepted by Harry's friends, who appointed Monday, at Greenwell, to meet. Lydia did not tell me that; she said she thought it had been settled peaceably, so I was not uneasy, and only wanted Harry to come back from Seth David's soon. The possibility of his fighting never occurred to me.  Sunday evening I was on the front steps with Miriam and Dr. Woods, talking of Harry and wishing he would come. \"You want Harry!\" the doctor repeated after me; \"you had better learn to live without him.\" \"What an absurdity!\" I said and wondered when he would come. Still later, Miriam, father, and I were in the parlor, when there was a tap on the window, just above his head, and I saw a hand, for an instant. Father hurried out, and we heard several voices; and then steps going away. Mother came down and asked who had been there, but we only knew that, whoever it was, father had afterward gone with them. Mother went on: \"There is something going on, which is to be kept from me. Every one seems to know it, and to make a secret of it.\" I said nothing, for I had promised Lydia not to tell; and even I did not know all.  When father came back, Harry was with him. I saw by his nod, and \"How are you, girls,\" how he wished us to take it, so neither moved from our chairs, while he sat down on the sofa and asked what kind of a sermon we had had. And we talked of anything except what we were thinking of, until we went upstairs.  Hal afterwards told me that he had been arrested up there, and father went with him to give bail; and that the sheriff had gone out to Greenwell after Mr. Sparks. He told me all about it next morning, saying he was glad it was all over, but sorry for Mr. Sparks; for he had a blow on his face which nothing would wash out. I said, \"Hal, if you _had_ fought, much as I love you, I would rather he had killed you than that you should have killed him. I love you too much to be willing to see blood on your hands.\" First he laughed at me, then said, \"If I had killed him, I never would have seen you again.\"  We thought it was all over; so did he. But Baton Rouge was wild about it. Mr. Sparks was the bully of the town, having nothing else to do, and whenever he got angry or drunk, would knock down anybody he chose. That same night, before Harry met him, he had slapped one man, and had dragged another over the room by the hair; but these coolly went home, and waited for a _voluntary apology_. So the mothers, sisters, and intimate friends of those who had patiently borne the blows, and being \"woolled,\" vaunted the example of their heroes, and asked why Dr. Morgan had not acted as _they_ had done, and waited for an apology? Then there was another faction who cried only blood could wash out that blow and make a gentleman of Mr. Sparks again,--as though he ever _had_ been one! So knots assembled at street corners, and discussed it, until father said to us that Monday night, \"These people are so excited, and are trying so hard to make this affair worse, that I would not be surprised if they shot each other down in the street,\" speaking of Harry and the other.  Hal seemed to think of it no more, though, and Wednesday said he must go to the city and consult Brother as to where he should permanently establish himself. I was sorry; yet glad that he would then get away from all this trouble. I don't know that I ever saw him in higher spirits than he was that day and evening, the 24th. Lilly and Charlie were here until late, and he laughed and talked so incessantly that we called him crazy. We might have guessed by his extravagant spirits that he was trying to conceal something from us....  He went away before daybreak, and I never saw him again.                                                     April 26th, 1862.  There is no word in the English language that can express the state in which we are, and have been, these last three days. Day before yesterday, news came early in the morning of three of the enemy's boats passing the Forts, and then the excitement began. It increased rapidly on hearing of the sinking of eight of our gunboats in the engagement, the capture of the Forts, and last night, of the burning of the wharves and cotton in the city while the Yankees were taking possession. To-day, the excitement has reached the point of delirium. I believe I am one of the most self-possessed in my small circle; and yet I feel such a craving for news of Miriam, and mother, and Jimmy, who are in the city, that I suppose I am as wild as the rest. It is nonsense to tell me I am cool, with all these patriotic and enthusiastic sentiments. Nothing can be positively ascertained, save that our gunboats are sunk, and theirs are coming up to the city. Everything else has been contradicted until we really do not know whether the city has been taken or not. We only know we had best be prepared for anything. So day before yesterday, Lilly and I sewed up our jewelry, which may be of use if we have to fly. I vow I will not move one step, unless carried away. Come what will, here I remain.  We went this morning to see the cotton burning--a"]]]
