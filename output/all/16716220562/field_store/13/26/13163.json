He had quickly turned his boat and was rowing back. He came close to King Arnvid and called:  \"He is there, ahead. His boats are ready in line of battle. The fox has not been asleep.\"  King Arnvid blew his horn. Slowly his boats came into line with his \"Sea-stag\" in the middle. Again he blew his horn. Cables were thrown across from one prow to the next, and all the ships were tied together so that their sides touched. Then the men set their sails again and they went past a tongue of land into a broad fiord. There lay the long line of King Harald's ships with their fierce heads grinning and mocking at the newcomers. Back of those prows was what looked like a long wall with spots of green and red and blue and yellow and shining gold. It was the locked shields of the men in the bows, and over every shield looked fierce blue eyes. Higher up and farther back was another wall of shields; for on the half deck in the stern of every ship stood the captain with his shield-guard of a dozen men.  Arnvid's people had furled their sails and were taking down the masts, but the ships were still drifting on with the wind. The horn blew, and quickly every man sprang to his place in bow and stern. All were leaning forward with clenched teeth and widespread nostrils. They were clutching their naked swords in their hands. Their flashing eyes looked over their shields.  Soon King Arnvid's ships crashed into Harald's line, and immediately the men in the bows began to swing their swords at one another. The soldiers of the shield-guard on the high decks began to throw darts and stones and to shoot arrows into the ships opposite them.  So in every ship showers of stones and arrows were falling, and many men died under them or got broken arms or legs. Spears were hurled from deck to deck and many of them bit deep into men's bodies. In every bow men slashed with their swords at the foes in the opposite ship. Some jumped upon the gunwale to get nearer or hung from the prow-head. Some even leaped into the enemy's boat.  King Harald's ship lay prow to prow with King Arnvid's. The battle had been going on for an hour. King Harald was still in the stern on the deck. There was a dent in his helmet where a great stone had struck. There was a gash in his shoulder where a spear had cut. But he was still fighting and laughed as he worked.  \"Wolf meets wolf to-day,\" he said. \"But things are going badly in the prow,\" he cried. \"Ivar fallen, Thorstein wounded, a dozen men lying in the bottom of the boat!\"  He leaped down from the deck and ran along the gunwale, shouting as he went:  \"Harald and victory!\"  So he came to the bow and stood swinging his sword as fast as he breathed. Every time it hit a man of Arnvid's men. Harald's own warriors cheered, seeing him.  \"Harald and victory!\" they shouted, and went to work again with good heart.  Slowly King Arnvid's men fell back before Harald's biting sword. Then Harald's men threw a great hook into that boat and pulled it alongside and still pushed King Arnvid's people back.  \"Come on! Follow me!\" cried Harald.  Then he leaped into King Arnvid's boat, and his warriors followed him.  \"He comes like a mad wolf,\" King Arnvid's men said, and they turned and ran back below the deck.  Then Arnvid himself leaped down and stood with his sword raised.  \"Can this young Shockhead make cowards of you all?\" he cried.  But Harald's sword struck him, and he fell dead. Then a big, bloody viking of King Arnvid leaped upon the edge of the ship and stood there. He held his drinking-horn and his sword high in his hands.  \"Ran[9] and not you, Shockhead, shall have them and me!\" he cried, and leaped laughing into the water and was drowned.  Many other warriors chose the same death on that terrible day.  [Illustration: \"_Then he leaped into King Arnvid's boat_\"]  All along the line of boats men fought for hours. In some places the cables had been cut, and the boats had drifted apart. Ships lay scattered about two by two, fighting. May boats sank, many men died, some fled away in their ships, and at the end King Harald had won the battle. So he had King Arnvid's country and King Audbiorn's country. Many men took the oath and became his friends. All people were talking of his wonderful battles.  [Decoration]   FOOTNOTES:  [9] See note about Ran on page 198.     [Illustration]  King Harald's Wedding   It had taken King Harald ten years to fight so many battles. And all that time he had not cut his hair or combed it. Now he was feasting one day at an earl's house. Many people were there.  \"How is it, friends?\" Harald said. \"Have I kept my vow?\"  His friends answered:  \"You have kept your vow. There is no king but you in all Norway.\"  \"Then I think I will cut my hair,\" the king laughed.  So he went and bathed and put on fresh clothes. Then the earl cut his hair and beard and combed them and put a gold band about his head. Then he looked at him and said:  \"It is beautiful, smooth, and yellow.\"  And all people wondered at the beauty of the king's hair.  \"I will give you a new name,\" the earl said. \"You shall no longer be called Shockhead. You shall be called Harald Hairfair.\"  \"It is a good name,\" everybody cried.  Then Harald said:  \"But I have another thing to do now. Guthorm, you shall take the same message to Gyda that you gave ten years ago.\"  So Guthorm went and brought back this answer from Gyda:  \"I will marry the king of all Norway.\"  So when the wedding time came, Harald rode across the country to the home of Gyda's father, Eric. Many men followed him. They were all richly dressed in velvet and gold.  For three nights they feasted at Eric's house. On the next night Gyda sat on the cross-bench with her women. A long veil of white linen covered her face and head and hung down to the ground. After the mead-horns had been brought in, Eric stood up from his high seat and went down and stood before King Harald.  \"Will you marry Gyda now?\" he asked.  [Illustration: \"_I, Harald, King of Norway, take you Gyda, for my wife_\"]  Harald jumped to his feet and laughed.  \"Yes,\" he said. \"I have waited long enough.\"  Then he stepped down from his high seat and stood by Eric. They walked about the hall. Before them walked thralls carrying candles. Behind them walked many of King Harald's great earls. Three times they walked around the hall. The third time they stopped before the cross-bench. King Harald and Eric stepped upon the platform, where the cross-bench was.  Eric gave a holy hammer to Harald, and it was like the hammer of Thor. Harald put it upon Gyda's lap, saying:  \"With this holy hammer of Thor's, I, Harald, King of Norway, take you, Gyda, for my wife.\"  Then he took a bunch of keys and tied it to Gyda's girdle, saying:  \"This is the sign that you are mistress of my house.\"  After that, Eric called out loudly:  \"Now, are Harald, King of Norway, and Gyda, daughter of Eric, man and wife.\"  Then thralls brought meat and drink in golden dishes. They were about to serve it to Gyda for the bride's feast, but Harald took the dish from them and said:  \"No, I will serve my bride.\"  So he knelt and held the platter. When he did that his men shouted. Then they talked among themselves, saying:  \"Surely Harald never knelt before. It is always other people who kneel to him.\"  When the bride had tasted the food and touched the mead-horn to her lips she stood up and walked from the hall. All her women followed her, but the men stayed and feasted long.  On the next morning at breakfast Gyda sat by Harald's side. Soon the king rose and said:  \"Father-in-law, our horses stand ready in the yard. Work is waiting for me at home and on the sea. Lead out the bride.\"  So Eric took Gyda by the hand and led her out of the hall. Harald followed close. When they passed through the door Eric said:  \"With this hand I lead my daughter out of my house and give her to you, Harald, son of Halfdan, to be your wife. May all the gods make you happy!\"  Harald led his bride to the horse and lifted her up and set her behind his saddle and said:  \"Now this Gyda is my wife.\"  Then they drank the stirrup-horn and rode off.  \"Everything comes to King Harald,\" his men said; \"wife and land and crown and victory in battle. He is a lucky man.\"  [Decoration]     [Illustration]  King Harald Goes West-Over-Seas   Now many men hated King Harald. Many a man said:  \"Why should he put himself up for king of all of us? He is no better than I am. Am I not a king's son as well as he? And are not many of us kings' sons? I will not kneel before him and promise to be his man. I will not pay him taxes. I will not have his earl sitting over me. The good old days have gone. This Norway has become a prison. I will go away and find some other place.\"  So hundreds of men sailed away. Some went to France and got land and lived there. Big Rolf-go-afoot and all his men sailed up the great French River and won a battle against the French king himself. There was no way to stop the flashing of his battle-axes but to give him what he wanted. So the king made Rolf a duke, gave him broad lands and gave him the king's own daughter for wife. Rolf called his country Normandy, for old Norway. He ruled it well and was a great lord, and his sons' sons after him were kings of England.  Other Norsemen went to Ireland and England and Scotland. They drew up their boats on the river banks. The people ran away before them and gathered into great armies that marched back to meet the vikings in battle. Sometimes the Norsemen lost, but oftener they won, so that they got land and lived in those countries. Their houses sat in these strange lands like warriors' camps, and the Norsemen went among their new neighbors with hanging swords and spears in hand, ever ready for fight.  There are many islands north of Scotland. They are called the Orkneys and the Shetlands. They have many good harbors for ships. They are little and rocky and bare of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24811"],["title","Viking Tales (#7)"],["body",". Wild sea-birds scream around them. On some of them a man can stand in the middle and see the ocean all about him. Now the vikings sailed to these islands and were pleased.  [Illustration: \"_In Norway they left burning houses and weeping women_\"]  \"It is like being always in a boat,\" they said. \"This shall be our home.\"  So it went until all the lands round about were covered with vikings. Norse carved and painted houses brightened the hillsides. Viking ships sailed all the seas and made harbor in every river. Norsemen's thralls plowed the soil and planted crops and herded cattle, and gold flowed into their masters' treasure-chests. Norse warriors walked up and down the land, and no man dared to say them nay.  These men did not forget Norway. In the summers they sailed back there and harried the coast. They took gold and grain and beautiful cloth back to their homes. In Norway they left burning houses and weeping women.  Every summer King Harald had out his ships and men and hunted these vikings. There are many little islands about Norway. They have crags and caves and deep woods. Here the vikings hid when they saw King Harald's ships coming. But Harald ran his boat into every creek and fiord and hunted in every cave and through all the woods and among the crags. He caught many men, but most of them got away and went home laughing at Harald. Then they came back the next summer and did the same deeds over again. At last King Harald said:  \"There is but one thing to do. I must sail to these western islands and whip these robbers in their own homes.\"  So he went with a great number of ships. He found as brave men as he had brought from Norway. These vikings had brought their old courage to their new homes. King Harald's fine ships were scarred by viking stones and scorched by viking fire. The shields of Harald's warriors had dents from viking blows. Many of those men carried viking scars all their lives. And many of King Harald's warriors walked the long, hard road to Valhalla, and feasted there with some of these very vikings that had died in King Harald's battles. But after many hard fights on land and sea, after many men had died and many had fled away to other lands, King Harald won, and he made the men that were yet in the islands take the oath, and he left his earls to rule over them. Then he went back to Norway.  \"He has done more than he vowed to do,\" people said. \"He has not only whipped the vikings, but he has got a new kingdom west-over-seas.\"  Then they talked of that dream that his mother had.  \"King Harald was that great tree,\" they said. \"The trunk was red with the blood of his many battles, but higher up the limbs were fair and green like this good time of peace. The topmost branches were white because Harald will live to be an old man. Just as that tree spread out until all of Norway was in its shade, and even more lands, so Harald is king of all this country and of the western islands. The many branches of that tree are the many sons of Harald, who shall be earls and kings in Norway, and their sons after them, for hundreds of years.\"     _PART II_  [Illustration]  WEST-OVER-SEAS   [Decoration]     [Illustration]  Homes in Iceland   Men had been feasting in Ingolf's house. But there was no laughing and no shouting of jokes. Ingolf sat in his high seat frowning and gloomy. His head hung on his breast. He was staring into the fire. Now he raised his head and looked about the hall.  \"Comrades,\" he said, \"what shall we do? Herstein and Holmstein died by our swords. Their kinsmen hunger to kill us. Besides, when Harald hears of our deed, there will not be a safe place in Norway for us. He will never let a man fight out an honest quarrel. Where shall we go?\"  A man stood up from the bench.  \"We have friends in the Shetlands,\" he said. \"Let us find homes there.\"  Then Leif, in the high seat opposite Ingolf, stood up.  \"No, not the Shetlands, my foster-brother.[10] They are crowded already. Besides, Harald will not long keep his hands off them. Then they will be no better than Norway. England and Ireland and Scotland are old. My eyes ache for something new. What of that far island that Floki found? It is empty. We could choose our land from the whole country. There is good fishing. There are green valleys. And Butter Thorolf says that butter drops from every weed. There are mountains and deserts where we may find adventure. I say, let us steer for Iceland!\"  When he stopped, many of the men shouted:  \"Yes! Iceland!\"  But an old man stood up.  \"We have all laughed at that tale of Butter Thorolf's,\" he said. \"But Floki himself said that the sea about the island is full of ice that pushes upon the land, that no ship can live in that water in the winter, that great mountains of ice cover the island. Did not all his cattle die there of hunger and cold, and did he not come back to Norway cursing Iceland?\"  \"Oh, Sighvat, you are old and fearful,\" called out Leif, and he laughed.  Then he stretched himself up and threw back his head.  \"Are we afraid of ice? Have we not seen angry water before? I have been hungry, but I have never died of it. Surely if there are fish in the sea and grass in the valleys, we can live there. I should like to stand on a hill and look around on a wide land and think, 'This is all ours,' and out upon a rough sea and think, 'Far off there are our foes and they dare not come over to us.' Besides, we shall have no Shockhead Harald to lord it over us. We can come and go and feast and fight as we please. We shall be our own kings. And our ships will be always waiting to take us away, when we are weary of it. And we shall see things that other men have never seen. I am tired of the old things. Perhaps in after days men will make songs about 'those foster-brothers, Ingolf and Leif, who made a new country in a wonderful land, and whose sons and grandsons are mighty men in Iceland!'\"  Ingolf leaped up from his chair.  \"By the strong arm of Thor!\" he cried, \"I like the sound of it. Now I make my vow.\"  He raised his drinking-horn.  \"I vow that I will find this Iceland and pass the winter there, and that if man can live upon it I will go back there and set up my home.\"  \"And I vow that I will follow my foster-brother,\" cried Leif.  And many men vowed to go.  So on the next day they began to make ready a boat. They looked her over carefully and recalked every seam and freshly painted her and put into her their strongest oars and made her a new sail.  \"This will be the longest voyage that she ever made,\" Ingolf said.  When the work was done, they put into her great stores, axes, hammers, fish-nets, cooking-kettles, kegs of ale, chests of hard bread, chests of smoked meat, brass kettles full of flour, skin bottles of water. They stowed these things away in the ends of the ship. When they were ready they put in four head of cattle.  \"We shall need the milk and perhaps the meat,\" Ingolf said.  Many men wished to go, but Ingolf had said:  \"There is little room to spare and little food and drink. I have planned for half a year. But perhaps we must be sailing longer than that. Our food may run short. We must not have extra mouths to feed. There are thirty oars in our boat. I will take only one man for every oar, and Leif and I will steer.\"  So they started off. Leif stood in the prow leaning forward and looking far ahead, and he sang:      \"What does the swimming dragon smell?     A stormy sea, an empty land,     Hunger, darkness, giants, fire.     Leif and his sword do laugh at that.\"  They sailed for days and saw no land. Sometimes they passed ships and always made sure to sail close enough to hail them.  \"Where are you going?\" Ingolf would call.  \"To Norway,\" would come back the answer.  \"For trade or fight?\" Leif would shout.  Then would ring out a great laugh from that boat and this answer:  \"A shut mouth is a good friend.\"  So the two ships sailed on, and the men were glad to have heard a greeting and to have called one.  But at last there were the Shetlands.  \"We will go in here and rest,\" Ingolf said.  When they rowed to shore a certain Shetland man stood there. He watched them land and looked them all over. Then he walked up to Ingolf and said:  \"You look like brave men. Welcome to Shetland. You shall come to my house and rest your legs from ship-going and fill your stomachs. I hunger for news of Norway.\"  So they went to his house and stayed there for three days. And good it seemed to be near a fire and in a quiet bed and before a steaming platter. When they went to the shore to start off again, the Shetland man had his thralls carry a keg of ale and a great kettle of cooked meat and put them into the ship.  \"Think of me when you eat this,\" he said.  Then the Norsemen put to sea again and sailed for a long time.  One day a terrible storm came up; the sky was black; the wind howled through the ship. Great waves leaped in the sea.  \"Down with the sail and out with the oars!\" Ingolf shouted.  So the men furled the sail and took down the mast and laid it along the bottom of the boat. As they worked, one man was washed overboard and drowned. The men sat down to row, but the tumbling waves tossed the boat about and poured over her and broke three of the oars. But still the men held on. They were wet to the skin and were cold, and their arms and legs ached with the hard work, and they were hungry from the long waiting, but not one face was white with fear.  \"Ran, in her caves under sea, wants us for company to-night,\" Ingolf laughed.  So they tossed about all night, but in the morning the wind died down. Great waves still rolled, and for days the sea was rough, but they could put up the sail. Then one day Leif, as he sat in the pilot's seat, jumped to his feet and sang:      \"To eyes grown tired with looking far,     All at once appeared an island,     A stretching-place for sea-legs,     A quiet bed for backs grown stiff     On rowing-bench on rolling sea.     A place to build a red fire     And"]]]
