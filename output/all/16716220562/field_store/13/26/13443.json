But I fancy they'll limit you to a week's wailing, and if you don't turn off the tap after that, they'll send for a doctor, who'll prescribe Turkey rhubarb and senna mixed with quinine. It's a stock school prescription for shirking; harmless, you know, but particularly nasty; you'd have the taste in your mouth for days. Oh, cheer up, for goodness' sake! Look here: if I'm really sent to the camp at Denley, I'll come and look you up, and take you out to tea somewhere. How would that suit your ladyship?\"  \"Would you really? Will you promise?\"  \"Honest Injun, I will!\"  \"Then I don't mind quite so much as I did, though I still hate the thought of school,\" conceded Dona.  The Andersons generally described themselves as \"a large and rambling family, guaranteed sound, and quiet in harness, but capable of taking fences if required\". Nora, the eldest, had been married a year ago, Bevis was in the Navy, Leonard was serving \"somewhere in France\"; Larry, who had just left school, had been called up, and was going into training, and after Marjorie and Dona followed Peter, Cyril, and Joan. Marjorie and Dona always declared that if they could have been consulted in the matter of precedence, they would not have chosen to arrive in the exact centre of a big family. Nora, as eldest, and Joan, as youngest, occupied definite and recognized positions, but middle girls rarely receive as much attention. Dona, indeed, had claimed a certain share of petting, but Marjorie considered herself badly treated by the Fates.  \"I wish I were the only one!\" she assured the others. \"Think how I'd be appreciated then!\"  \"We'll swop you with pleasure, madam, if you wish,\" returned Larry ironically. \"I should suggest an advertisement such as this: 'Wanted situation as only daughter in eligible family, eight brothers and sisters given in exchange. A month's approval.' No! Better not put that in, or they'd send you packing back at the end of the first week.\"  \"Brothers are beasts!\" pouted Marjorie, throwing a cushion at Larry to express her indignation. \"What I'd like would be for Mother to take me away for a year, or let me study Art, or Music, or something, just with her. Mamie Page's mother went with her to Paris, and they'd a gorgeous time. That's my ambition.\"  \"And mine's just to be allowed to stop at home,\" added Dona plaintively.  Neither Marjorie's nor Dona's wishes, however, were considered at head-quarters. The powers that be had decided that they were to be educated at Brackenfield College, their boxes were ready packed, and their train was to leave at nine o'clock by railway time. Mother saw them off at the station.  \"I wish I could have taken you,\" she said rather anxiously. \"But I think you'll manage the journey all right. You're both together, and Marjorie's a big girl now, and used to travelling. You've only to cross the platform at Rosebury to get the London train, and a teacher is to meet you at Euston. You'll know her by the Brackenfield badge, and be sure you don't speak to anyone else. Call out of the window for a porter when you reach Rosebury. You've plenty of time to change. Well, good-bye, chicks! Be good girls. Don't forget to send me that telegram from Euston. Write as soon as you can. Don't lean against the door of the carriage. You're just off now! Good-bye! Good-bye!\"  As the train steamed out of the station, Dona sank into her place with the air of a martyr starting for the stake, and mopped her eyes with her already damp pocket-handkerchief. Marjorie, case-hardened after many similar partings, settled herself in the next seat, and, pulling out an illustrated paper from her bag, began to read. The train was very full, and the girls had with difficulty found room. Soldiers on leave were returning to the front, and filled the corridor. Dona and Marjorie were crammed in between a stout woman, who nursed a basket containing a mewing kitten, and a wizened little man with an irritating cough. Opposite sat three Tommies, and an elderly lady with a long thin nose and prominent teeth, who entered into conversation with the soldiers, and proffered them much good advice, with an epitome of her ideas on the conduct of the war. The distance from Silverwood to Rosebury was only thirty miles, and the train was due to arrive at the junction with twenty-five minutes to spare for the London express. On all ordinary occasions it jogged along in a commonplace fashion, and turned up up to time. To-day, however, it behaved with unusual eccentricity, and, instead of passing the signals at Meriton, it slowed up and whistled, and finally stood still upon the bridge.  \"Must be something blocking the line,\" observed one of the Tommies, looking out of the window.  \"I do hope it's not an accident. The Company is so terribly understaffed at present, and the signal-men work far too long hours, and are ready to drop with fatigue at their posts,\" began the thin lady nervously. \"I've always had a horror of railway accidents. I wish I'd taken an insurance ticket before I started. Can you see anything on the line, my good man? Is there any danger?\"  The Tommy drew in his head and smiled. It was a particularly good-looking head, with twinkling brown eyes, and a very humorous smile.  \"Not so long as the train is standing still,\" he replied. \"I think they'll get us back to the front this time. We'll probably have to wait till something passes us. It's just a matter of patience.\"  His words were justified, for in about ten minutes an express roared by, after which event their train once more started, and jogged along to Rosebury.  \"We're horribly late!\" whispered Marjorie to Dona, consulting her watch. \"I hope to goodness there'll be no more stops. It's running the thing very fine, I can tell you. I'm glad we've only to cross the platform. I'll get a porter as fast as I can.\"  But, when they reached Rosebury, the stout woman and the basket with the kitten got in the way, and the elderly lady jammed up the door with her hold-all, so that, by the time Dona and Marjorie managed to get themselves and their belongings out of the carriage, the very few porters available had already been commandeered by other people. The girls ran to the van at the back of the train, where the guard was turning out the luggage. Their boxes were on the platform amid a pile of suit-cases, bags, and portmanteaux; their extreme newness made them easily recognizable, even without the conspicuous initials.  \"What are we to do?\" cried Marjorie. \"We'll miss the London train! I know we shall! Here, Dona, let's take them ourselves!\"  She seized one of the boxes by the handle, and tried to drag it along the platform, but its weight was prohibitive. After a couple of yards she stopped exhausted.  \"Better leave your luggage and let it follow you,\" said a voice at her elbow. \"If you want the Euston express, you'll have to make a run for it.\"  Marjorie turned round quickly. The speaker was the young Tommy who had leaned out of the carriage window when the line was blocked. His dark eyes were still twinkling.  \"The train's over there, and they're shutting the doors,\" he urged. \"Here, I'll take this for you, if you like. Best hurry up!\"  He had his heavy kit-bag to carry, but he shouldered the girls' pile of wraps, umbrellas, and hockey-sticks, in addition to his own burden, and set off post-haste along the platform, while Marjorie and Dona, much encumbered with their bags and a few odd parcels, followed in his wake. It was a difficult progress, for everybody seemed to get into their way, and just as they neared the express the guard waved his green flag.  \"Stand back! Stand back!\" shouted an official, as the girls made a last wild spurt, the whistle sounded, the guard jumped into the van, and, with a loud clanging of coupling-chains, the train started. They had missed it by exactly five seconds.  \"Hard luck!\" said the Tommy, depositing the wraps upon the platform. \"You'll have to wait two hours for the next. You'll get your luggage, at any rate. Oh, it's all right!\" as Marjorie murmured thanks, \"I'm only sorry you've missed it,\" and he hailed a companion and was gone.  \"It was awfully kind of him,\" commented Dona, still panting from her run.  \"Kind! He's a gentleman--there was no mistaking that!\" replied Marjorie.  The two girls had now to face the very unpleasant fact that they had missed the connection, and that the teacher who was to meet them at Euston would look for them in vain. They wondered whether she would wait for the next train, and, if she did not, how they were going to get across London to the Great Western railway station. Marjorie felt very doubtful as to whether her experience of travelling would be equal to the emergency. She hid her fears, however, from Dona, whose countenance was quite sufficiently woebegone already.  \"We'll get chocolates out of the automatic machine, and buy something to read at the bookstall,\" she suggested. \"Two hours won't last for ever!\"  Dona cheered up a little at the sight of magazines, and picked out a periodical with a soldier upon the cover. Marjorie, whose taste in literature inclined to the sensational, reviewed the books, and chose one with a startling picture depicting a phantom in the act of disturbing a dinner-party. She was too agitated to read more than a few pages of it, but she thought it seemed interesting. The two hours were over at last, and the girls and their luggage were safely installed in the London train by a porter. It was a long journey to Euston. After their early start and the excitement at Rosebury both felt tired, and even Marjorie looked decidedly sober when they reached their destination. Each was wearing the brown-white-and-blue Brackenfield badge, which had been forwarded to them from the school, and by which the mistress was to identify them. As they left the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25145"],["title","A Patriotic Schoolgirl (#2)"],["body","iage, they glanced anxiously at the coat of each lady who passed them on the platform, to descry a similar rosette. All in vain. Everybody was in a hurry, and nobody sported the Brackenfield colours.  \"We shall have to get a taxi and manage as best we can,\" sighed Marjorie. \"I wish the porters weren't so stupid! I can't make them listen to me. The taxis will all be taken up if we're not quick! Oh, I say, there's that Tommy again! I wonder if he'd hail us one. I declare I'll ask him.\"  \"Hail you a taxi? With pleasure!\" replied the young soldier, as Marjorie impulsively stopped him and urged her request. \"Have you got your luggage this time?\"  \"Yes, yes, it's all here, and we've found a porter, only he's so slow, and----\"  \"Are you Marjorie and Dona Anderson?\" interrupted a sharp voice. \"I've been looking for you everywhere. Who is this you're speaking to? _You don't know?_ Then come along with me immediately. No, certainly not! I'll get a taxi myself. Where is your luggage?\"  The speaker was tall and fair, with light-grey eyes and pince-nez. She wore the unmistakable Brackenfield badge, so her words carried authority. She bustled the girls off in a tremendous hurry, and their good Samaritan of a soldier melted away amongst the crowd.  \"I've been waiting hours for you. How did you miss your train?\" asked the mistress. \"Why didn't you go and stand under the clock, as you were told in the Head Mistress's letter? And don't you know that you must _never_ address strangers?\"  \"She's angry with you for speaking to the Tommy,\" whispered Dona to Marjorie, as the pair followed their new guardian.  \"I can't help it. He would have got us a taxi, and now they're all gone, and we must put up with a four-wheeler. I couldn't see any clock, and no wonder we missed her in such a crowd. I think she's hateful, and I'm not going to like her a scrap.\"  \"No more am I,\" returned Dona.     CHAPTER II  Brackenfield College   Brackenfield College stood on the hills, about a mile from the seaside town of Whitecliffe. It had been built for a school, and was large and modern and entirely up-to-date. It had a gymnasium, a library, a studio, a chemical laboratory, a carpentering-shop, a kitchen for cooking-classes, a special block for music and practising-rooms, and a large assembly hall. Outside there were many acres of lawns and playing-fields, a large vegetable garden, and a little wood with a stream running through it. The girls lived in three hostels--for Seniors, Intermediates, and Juniors--known respectively as St. Githa's, St. Elgiva's, and St. Ethelberta's. They met in school and in the playgrounds, but, with a few exceptions, they were not allowed to visit each other's houses.  Marjorie and Dona had been separated on their arrival, the former being entered at St. Elgiva's and the latter at St. Ethelberta's, and it was not until the afternoon of the day following that they had an opportunity of meeting and comparing notes. To both life had seemed a breathless and confusing whirl of classes, meals, and calisthenic exercises, with a continual ringing of bells and marching from one room to another. It was a comfort at last to have half an hour when they might be allowed to wander about and do as they pleased.  \"Let's scoot into that little wood,\" said Marjorie, seizing Dona by the arm. \"It looks quiet, and we can sit down and talk. Well, how are you getting on? D'you like it so far?\"  Dona flung herself down under a larch tree and shook her head tragically.  \"I hate it! But then, you know, I never expected to like it. You should see my room-mates!\"  \"You should just see mine!\"  \"They can't be as bad as mine.\"  \"I'll guarantee they're worse. But go on and tell about yours.\"  \"There's Mona Kenworthy,\" sighed Dona. \"She looked over all my clothes as I put them away in my drawers, and said they weren't as nice as hers, and that she'd never dream of wearing a camisole unless it was trimmed with real lace. She twists her hair in Hinde's wavers every night, and keeps a pot of complexion cream on her dressing-table. She always uses stephanotis scent that she gets from one special place in London, and it costs four and sixpence a bottle. She hates bacon for breakfast, and she has seventeen relations at the front. She's thin and brown, and her nose wiggles like a rabbit's when she talks.\"  \"I shouldn't mind her if she'd keep to her own cubicle,\" commented Marjorie. \"Sylvia Page will overflow into mine, and I find her things dumped down on my bed. She's nicer than Irene Andrews, though; we had a squabble last night over the window. Betty Moore brought a whole box of chocolates with her, and she ate them in bed and never offered a single one to anybody else. We could hear her crunching for ages. I don't like Irene, but I agreed with her that Betty is mean!\"  \"Nellie Mason sleeps in the next cubicle to me,\" continued Dona, bent on retailing her own woes. \"She snores dreadfully, and it kept me awake, though she's not so bad otherwise. Beatrice Elliot is detestable. She found that little Teddy bear I brought with me, and she sniggered and asked if I came from a kindergarten. I've calculated there are seventy-four days in this term. I don't know how I'm going to live through them until the holidays.\"  \"Hallo!\" said a cheerful voice. \"Sitting weeping under the willows, are you? New girls always grouse. Miss Broadway's sent me to hunt you up and do the honours of the premises. I'm Mollie Simpson. Come along with me and I'll show you round.\"  The speaker was a jolly-looking girl of about sixteen, with particularly merry blue eyes and a whimsical expression. Her dark curly hair was plaited and tied with broad ribbons.  \"We've been round, thanks very much,\" returned Marjorie to the new-comer.  \"Oh, but that doesn't count if you've only gone by yourselves! You wouldn't notice the points. Every new girl has got to be personally conducted by an old one and told the traditions of the place. It's a sort of initiation, you know. We've a regular freemasons' code here of things you may do or mustn't. Quick march! I've no time to waste. Tea is at four prompt.\"  Thus urged, Marjorie and Dona got up, shook the pine needles from their dresses, and followed their cicerone, who seemed determined to perform her office of guide in as efficient a fashion as possible.  \"This is the Quad,\" she informed them. \"That's the Assembly Hall and the Head's private house, and those are the three hostels. What's it like in St. Githa's? I can't tell you, because I've never been there. It's for Seniors, and no Intermediate or Junior may pop her impertinent nose inside, or so much as go and peep through the windows without getting into trouble. They've carpets on the stairs instead of linoleum, and they may make cocoa in their bedrooms and fill their own hot-water bags, and other privileges that aren't allowed to us luckless individuals. They may come and see us, by special permission, but we mayn't return the visits. By the by, you'd oblige me greatly if you'd tilt your chapeau a little farther forward. Like this, see!\"  \"Why?\" questioned Marjorie, greatly astonished, as she made the required alteration to the angle of her hat.  \"Because only Seniors may wear their sailors on the backs of their heads. It's a strict point of school etiquette. You may jam on your hockey cap as you like, but not your sailor.\"  \"Are there any other rules?\" asked Dona.  \"Heaps. Intermediates mayn't wear bracelets, and Juniors mayn't wear lockets, they're limited to brooches. I advise you to strip those trinkets off at once and stick them in your pockets. Don't go in to tea with them on any account.\"  \"How silly!\" objected Dona, unclasping her locket, with Father's photo in it, most unwillingly.  \"Now, look here, young 'un, let me give you a word of good advice at the beginning. Don't you go saying anything here is silly. The rules have been made by the Seniors, and Juniors have got to put up with them and keep civil tongues in their heads. If you want to get on you'll have to accommodate yourself to the ways of the place. Any girl who doesn't has a rough time, I warn you. For goodness' sake don't begin to blub!\"  \"Don't be a cry-baby, Dona,\" said Marjorie impatiently. \"She's not been to school before,\" she explained to Mollie, \"so she's still feeling rather home-sick.\"  Mollie nodded sympathetically.  \"I understand. She'll soon get over it. She's a decent kid. I'm going to like her. That's why I'm giving her all these tips, so that she won't make mistakes and begin wrong. She'll get on all right at St. Ethelberta's. Miss Jones is a stunt, as jinky as you like. Wish we had her at our house.\"  \"Who is the Head of St. Elgiva's?\"  \"Miss Norton, worse luck for us!\"  \"Not the tall fair one who met us in London yesterday?\"  \"The same.\"  \"Oh, thunder! I shall never get on with her, I know.\"  \"The Acid Drop's a rather unsweetened morsel, certainly. You'll have to mind your p's and q's. She can be decent to those she likes, but she doesn't take to everybody.\"  \"She hasn't taken to me--I could see it in her eye at Euston.\"  \"Then I'm sorry for you. It isn't particularly pleasant to be in Norty's bad books. If you missed your train and kept her waiting she'll never forgive you. Look out for squalls!\"  \"What's the Head like?\"  \"Mrs. Morrison? Well, of course, she's nice, but we stand very much in awe of her. It's a terrible thing to be sent down to her study. We generally see her on the platform. We call her 'The Empress', because she's so like the pictures of the Empress Eugénie, and she's so dignified and above everybody else. Hallo, there's the first bell! We must scoot and wash our hands. If you're late for a meal you put a penny in the missionary box.\"  Marjorie walked into the large dining-hall with Mollie Simpson. She felt she had made, if not yet a friend, at least an acquaintance, and in this wilderness of fresh faces it was a boon to be able to speak to somebody. She hoped Mollie would not desert her and sit"]]]
