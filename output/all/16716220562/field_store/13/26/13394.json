Houston shook off the bleak, black feeling of terrible chill that had crept over him and pushed his way into the UN Police building.         *       *       *       *       *  The thirteenth floor housed the Psychodeviant Division. As he stood in the rising elevator, Houston wondered wryly if the number 13 was good luck or bad in this case.  He stepped out of the elevator and headed for the Division Chief's office.  Division Chief Reinhardt was a heavy-set, balding man, built like a professional wrestler. His cold blue eyes gleamed from beneath shaggy, overhanging brows, and his face was almost expressionless except for a faint scowl that crossed it from time to time. In spite of the fact that a Canadian education had wiped out all but the barest trace of German accent, his Prussian training, of the old Junkers school, was still evident. He demanded--and got--precision and obedience from his subordinates, although he had no use for the strictly military viewpoint of obsequiousness towards one's superiors.  He was sitting behind his desk, scowling slightly at some papers on it when Houston stepped in.  \"You wanted me to report straight to you, Mr. Reinhardt?\"  Reinhardt looked up, his heavy face becoming expressionless. \"Ah, Houston. Yes; sit down. You did a fine job on that London affair; that's what I call coming through at the last moment.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Your orders to return,\" he said, \"were cut before you found your man. We have a much more important case for you than some petty pilfering Controller. We are after much more dangerous game.\"  Houston nodded. \"I see.\" Inwardly, he wondered. It was almost as if Reinhardt knew that Houston had found out that the recall had come early. Houston would have given his right arm at that moment to be able to probe Reinhardt's mind. But he held himself back. He had, in the past, sent tentative probes toward the Division Chief and found nothing, but he didn't know whether it would be safe now or not. It would be better to wait.         *       *       *       *       *  Reinhardt stood up, walked to the wall, and turned on a display screen. He twisted a knob to a certain setting, and a map of Manhattan Island sprang onto the screen in glowing color.  \"As you know,\" Reinhardt said pedantically, \"no Controller can do a perfect job of controlling a normal person. No matter how much he may want to make John Smith act naturally, some of the personality of the Controller will show up in the actions of John Smith. Am I correct?\"  Houston nodded without saying anything. The question was purely rhetorical, and the statement was perfectly correct.  \"Very well, then,\" Reinhardt continued, \"by means of these peculiarities, our psychologists have found that there is widespread, but very subtle controlling going on right in the UN General Assembly itself! The amazing thing is that they all bear the--shall we say--trademark of the same Controller. Whoever he is, he seems to have a long-range plan in mind; he wants to change, ever so slightly, certain international laws so that he will profit by them. Do you follow?\"  \"I follow,\" said Houston.  \"Good. It has taken painstaking research and a great deal of psychological statistical analysis, but we have found that one company--and one company only--benefits by these legal changes. Did you ever hear of Lasser & Sons?\"  \"Sure,\" said Houston. \"They're in the import-export business, with a few fingers in shipping and air transport.\"  \"That's them,\" said Reinhardt. \"Someone in that company, presumably someone at the top, is a Controller. And he's a very subtle, very dangerous man. Unlike the others, there is nothing hasty or overt in his plans. But within a few years, if this goes on, he will have more power than the others ever dreamed of.\"  \"And my job is to get him?\" Houston asked.  Reinhardt nodded. \"That's it. Get him. One way or another. You're in charge; I don't care how you do it, but this one Controller is more dangerous than any other we've come across, so get him.\"  Houston nodded slowly. \"Okay. Can you give me all the data you have so far?\"  Reinhardt patted a heavy folder on his desk. \"It's all here.\" Then he tapped the projected map on the screen. \"That's the Lasser Building--Church Street at Worth. Somewhere in there is the man we're looking for.\"         *       *       *       *       *  David Houston spent the next six weeks gathering facts, trying to determine the identity of the mysterious Controller at Lasser & Sons. Slowly, the evidence began to pile up.  At the same time, he worried over his own problem. Who was betraying non-criminal Controllers to the PD Police?  In that six-week period, two more men and a woman were arrested--one in Spain, one in India, and one in Hawaii.  There weren't very many Controllers on Earth, percentagewise. Of the three and a half billion people on Earth, less than an estimated one-thousandth of one percent were telepathic. But that made a grand total of some thirty-five thousand people.  Spread, as they were, all over the planet, it was rare that one Controller ever met another. The intelligent ones didn't use their power; they remained concealed, even from each other.  But _someone_, somewhere, was finding them and betraying them to the Psychodeviant Police.  As more and more data came in on the Lasser case, Houston began to get an idea. If there were a really clever, highly intelligent, megalomaniac Controller, wouldn't it be part of his psychological pattern to attempt to get rid of the majority of Controllers, those who simply wanted to lead normal lives?  And, if so, wasn't it possible that both his cases--the official and the unofficial--might lead to the same place: Lasser & Sons?  It began to look as though Houston could kill both his birds at once, if he could just figure out when, how, and in what direction to throw the stone.  In the middle of the seventh week, a Controller in Manchester, England, was mobbed and torn to bits by an irate crowd before the PD Police could get to him. There was no doubt in Houston's mind that this one was a real megalomaniac; he had taken over another man's brain and forced him to commit suicide. The controlled man had taken a Webley automatic, put it to his temple, and blown his brains out.  The Controller's mistake was in not realizing what the sudden shock of that bullet, transmitted to him telepathically, could do to his own mind. In the mental disorder that followed, he was spotted and killed easily.         *       *       *       *       *  There was still no word from Dorrine. She had flown back to the States a week after Houston had returned, but she had had to get back to England after three days. Since then, he had had three letters, nothing more. And letters are a damned unsatisfactory way for a telepath to conduct a love affair.  The one other factor that entered in was The Group, the small band of sane, reasonable telepaths who had begun to build themselves into an organization--a sort of Mutual Protective Association.  Personally, Houston didn't think much of the idea; the Group didn't have any real organization, and they refused to put one together. It was supposed to be democratic, but it sometimes bordered on the anarchic.  He stayed with them more for companionship than any other reason. When Dorrine had come back for her short stay, Houston had met with them and tried to get them to help him trace down the megalomaniac Controller who was doing so much damage, but they'd balked at the idea. Their job, they claimed, was to get enough members so that they could protect themselves from arrest by the Normals, and then just let things ride.  \"After all,\" Dorrine had said, \"things will work themselves out, darling; they always do.\"  \"Not unless somebody helps them, they don't,\" Houston had snapped back. \"Someone has to do something.\"  \"But, Dave, darling--we _are_ doing something! Don't you see?\"  He didn't, but there was no convincing either the Group or Dorrine. She was passionately interested in the recruiting work she was doing, and she thought that the Group was the answer to every Controller's troubles.  And then she had rushed back to England. \"I'll be back soon, Dave,\" she'd said. \"I think I have a lead on a girl in Liverpool.\"  So far, the girl hadn't been found. Controllers didn't like to give themselves away to anyone, so they kept a tight screen up most of the time.  It seemed as though everyone on Earth was in deadly fear all the time. The Normals feared losing their identities to Controllers, and the Controllers feared death at the hands of the Normals.  And death or the Penal Cluster were their only choices if they were discovered.  Houston worried about the risks Dorrine was taking, but there was nothing he could do. She was doing what she thought was right, just as he was; how could he argue with that?  Houston went on with his job, putting together facts and rumors and statistical data analysis, searching out his quarry.  And, at the end of the eighth week, everything blew high, wide, and hellish.         *       *       *       *       *  It was late evening. A cool wind blew over New York, bringing with it a hint of the rain to come. Church Street, in lower Manhattan, was not crowded, as it had been in the late afternoon, but neither was it entirely deserted. The cafes and bars did a lively business, but the tall, many-colored office buildings gaped at the street with blind and darkened eyes. Only a few of the windows glowed whitely with fluorescent illumination.  In one of the small coffee shops, David Houston sat, smoking a cigarette and stirring idly at a cup of cooling coffee.  Across the street was the Lasser Building; high up on the sixtieth floor, a whole suite of offices was brightly lit. The rest of the building was clothed in blackness.  Who was up there in that suite? Houston wasn't quite sure. He had narrowed his list of suspects down to three men: John Sager,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25061"],["title","The Penal Cluster (#6)"],["body","Pederson, and Norcross Lasser, three top officials in the company. Sager and Pederson were both vice-presidents of the firm; Sager was in charge of the Foreign Exports department, while Pederson handled the actual shipping. Lasser, by virtue of being the grandson of the man who had founded the firm, was president of Lasser & Sons, Inc.  Lasser seemed like a poor choice as chief villain of the outfit; he was a mild, bland man, quiet and friendly. Besides, his position made him an obvious suspect; naturally, the majority stockholder of the firm would profit most by the increased power of the company. And, equally obviously, a Controller wouldn't want to put himself in such an exposed position.  Which made Lasser, in Houston's mind, a hell of a good suspect. If anything happened, Lasser could cover by claiming that he, too, had been controlled, and the chances were that he could get away with it. A Controller never did anything directly; their dirty work was done by someone else--a puppet under their mental control. At least, so ran the popular misconception. If Lasser were the man, he stood a good chance of getting away with it, even if he were caught, provided he played his cards right.         *       *       *       *       *  That reasoning still didn't eliminate Sager or Pederson. Either of them could be the Controller. And there still remained the possibility that some unknown, unsuspected fourth person had the company of Lasser & Sons under his thumb.  That was what Houston intended to find out tonight.  He took a sip of his coffee, found it still reasonably hot.  Damn the megalomaniacs, anyway! Houston subconsciously tightened his fists. He, personally, had more to fear from the Normals than from another Controller. Normals could kill or imprison him, while a Controller would have a hard time doing either, directly.  But Houston could understand the Normal man; he could see how fear of a Controller could drive a man without the ability into a frenzied panic. He could understand, even forgive their actions, born and bred in ignorance and fear.  No, the ones he hated were the ones who had conceived and fostered that fear--the psychologically unstable megalomaniac Controllers. There were only a handful of them--probably not more than a few hundred or a thousand. But because of them, every telepath on Earth found his life in danger, and every Normal found his life a hell of terror.  Let Dorrine and her do-nothing friends run around the globe recruiting members for their precious Group; that was all right for them. Meanwhile, David Houston would be doing something on a more basic action level.  He glanced at his watch. Almost time.  \"How's the deployment?\" he whispered in his throat.  \"We've got the building surrounded now,\" said the voice in his ear. \"You can go in anytime.\"  \"How about the roof?\"  \"That's taken care of, sir; we've got 'copter that can be on the top of the Lasser Building at any time you call. They can land within thirty seconds of your signal.\"  \"Okay,\" Houston said; \"I'm going in now. Remember--no matter what I say or do, no one is to leave that building if they're conscious. And keep your eyes on me; if I act in the least peculiar, handcuff me--but don't knock me out.  \"And if I'm not back on time, come in anyway.\"  \"Right.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Houston finished his coffee, dropped a coin on the counter, and headed for the other side of the street.  The big problem was getting into the building itself. It was ringed with alarms; Lasser & Sons didn't want just anybody wandering in and out of their building.  So Houston had arranged a roundabout way. The building next to the Lasser Building was a good deal smaller, only forty-five stories high. A week before, Houston had rented an office on the eighteenth floor of the building; on the door, he had already had a sign engraved: Ajax Enterprises.  It was a shame the office would never be used.  Houston walked straight to the next-door building and opened the front door with his key. Inside, a night watchman lounged behind a desk, smoking a blackened briar. He looked up, smiled, and nodded.  \"Evening, Mr. Griswold; working late tonight?\"  Houston forced a smile he did not feel. \"Just doing a little paper work,\" he said.  He took the automatic elevator to the eighteenth floor. He didn't relish the idea of walking up to the roof, but taking the elevator would make the nightwatchman suspicious.  He didn't bother going to the office; he headed directly for the stairway and began his long climb--twenty-seven floors to the roof.  All through it, he kept up a running comment through his throat mike. \"I wish I weighed about fifty pounds less; carrying two hundred and twenty pounds of blubber up these stairs isn't easy.\"  \"Blubber, hooey!\" the earphone interrupted. \"Any man who's six-feet-three has a right to carry that much weight. Actually, you're a skinny-looking sort of goop.\"  Both men were exaggerating; Houston wasn't fat, but his broad, powerful frame couldn't be called skinny, either.  When he finally reached the roof, he paused and surveyed the wall of the Lasser Building, which towered high above him, spearing an additional thirty stories in the air. Up there, the lights on the sixtieth floor gleamed in the night.  The air was growing cooler, and the beginnings of a mist were forming. Houston hoped it wouldn't start to rain before he got inside.         *       *       *       *       *  The forty-sixth floor of the Lasser Building had no windows on this side, but there were plenty on the forty-seventh.  Leading up to them was an inviting looking fire escape, but Houston knew he didn't dare take that. By law, every fire escape was rigged with a fire alarm, in addition to the regular burglar alarm. He'd have to use another way.  The Lasser Building was a steel structure, shelled over with a bright blue anodized aluminum sheath. Only the day before, Houston, wearing the gray coverall of a power-line workman, had checked the wall to find the big steel beams beneath the aluminum. He had also installed certain other equipment; now he was going to make use of it.  Concealed in the louvres of the air-conditioner intake of the lower building was a specially constructed suit and several hundred feet of power line which was connected to the main line of the building.  In the darkness, Houston slipped on the suit. It was constructed somewhat like a light diving suit or a spacesuit, but without the helmet. In the toes, knees, and hands, were powerful electromagnets controlled by switches in the fingers of the gloves and powered by the current in the long line.  Houston stepped over to the blue aluminum wall, reached out a hand, and lowered one finger. Instantly, the powerful magnet anchored his hand to the wall, held by the dense magnetic field to the steel beam beneath the aluminum sheath. That one magnet alone could support his full body weight, and he had six magnets to work with.  Slowly, carefully, David Houston began to crawl up the wall.  Turn on a magnet in the right hand; lift up the left hand and anchor it higher; turn on the right hand and lift it even with the left, then anchor it again; do the same with both legs; then begin the process all over again, turning the magnets off and on in rotation.  Up and up he went. Past the forty-sixth floor, past the forty-seventh, the forty-eighth, and the forty-ninth. Not until he reached the fiftieth floor did he attempt to open one of the windows.  There was a magnetic lock inside the window, but Houston had taken that, too, into account. The powerful magnet in his right glove slid it aside easily. Houston lifted the window and stepped inside.  He had ten more floors to go.  He took off the suit and rolled it up into a tight package, then dropped it out the window. It landed with a barely audible thump. Houston took a deep breath, drew his stun gun, and headed for the stairway.         *       *       *       *       *  On the landing of the sixtieth floor of the Lasser Building, David Houston paused for a moment.  \"Sounds like you're out of breath,\" said the voice in his ear.  \"You try climbing all that way sometime,\" Houston whispered. \"I'm no superman, you know.\"  \"Shucks,\" said the voice, \"you've disillusioned me. What now?\"  \"I'm going to try to get a little information,\" Houston told him. \"Hold on.\"  On the other side of the door, he could hear faint sound, as if someone were moving around, but he could hear no voices.  Carefully, he sent out a probing thought, trying to see if he could attune his mind with that of someone inside without betraying himself.  He couldn't detect anything. The sixtieth floor covered a lot of space; if whoever was inside was too far away, their thoughts would be too faint to pick up unless Houston stepped up his own power, and he didn't want to do that.  Cautiously, he reached out a hand and eased open the door.  The hallway was brightly lit, but there was no one in sight. The unaccustomed light made Houston blink for a moment before his eyes adjusted to it; the hallways and landings below had been pitch dark, forcing him to use a penlight to find his way up.  He stepped into the hallway, closing the door behind him.  Now he could hear voices. He stopped to listen. The conversation was coming from an office down the hall--if it could be called a conversation.  There would be long periods of silence, then a word or two: \"But not that way.\" \"Until tomorrow.\" \"Vacillates.\"  There were three different voices.  Houston moved on down the hall, his stun gun ready. A few yards from the door, he stopped again, and, very gently, he sent out another thought-probe, searching for the minds of those within, carefully forging his way.         *       *       *       *       *  And, at that crucial instant, a voice spoke in his ear.  \"Houston! What's going on? You haven't said a thing for two full minutes!\"  \"I'm all right!\" Houston snapped. Only the force"]]]
