As Dyke approached, he raised a metal whistle which hung from his neck by a leather thong, and blew loudly.  A low whinny answered the call, and a big, raw-boned, powerful horse and a handsome, well-bred cob were unhaltered, to turn and stand patiently enough to be bridled and saddled, afterwards following out their masters like dogs.  And now as they passed the end of the stable, all the languor and lassitude passed away from Dyke on the instant.  For he now caught sight of their Kaffir servant lying fast asleep just beneath the eaves of the corrugated iron roof.  The sand hushed the horses' hoofs, and the Kaffir slept on, with the flies buzzing about his half-open mouth, as if they mistook the thick red lips for the petals of some huge flower.  \"I'm not going to stand that,\" said the boy.  \"What are you going to do?\"  \"You'll see,\" whispered Dyke.  \"If I'm to be toiling after goblins, he's not going to sleep there like a black pig.  Go on a little way and look back.\"  Joe Emson smiled in a heavy, good-humoured way, as he took the bridle his brother handed to him, and the smile developed into a silent laugh, as he saw the boy's energy over a bit of mischief.  For Dyke actually ran back to the stable, brought out a bucket of water, stood counting the furrows of the iron roofing, and then carried the pail round to the other side and set it down.  His next movement was to fetch a roughly made step-ladder, count the furrows on his side, then place the ladder carefully, and at such a slope that it lay flat on the roof, so that, steadily preserving his balance, he walked up with the bucket of water from round to round till he could see across the ridge to where his brother stood with the horses a hundred yards away, watching over the big nag's mane, and grasping now what was to happen.  Dyke knelt down now behind the ridge, to which the top of the ladder just reached, and had calculated his distance so well, that upon tilting the bucket a little, some water trickled down two of the furrows of an iron sheet, and began to drip from the eaves upon the Kaffir's nude chest.  There was no movement, so a little more water was poured, and this brought forth a pig-like grunt, as if of satisfaction.  More water--more grunts.  More water, and a shuffling movement.  More water, and an angry gasp; the Kaffir raised his head, looked up at the sky, the dripping eaves--looked round, and settled down to sleep.  All this was invisible to Dyke, but he could tell by the sounds that his shower was having effect; and as soon as the man ceased to move, the boy sent down a third of the bucketful.  This produced a sharp ejaculation, and the man sprang up into a sitting position, and looking angrily round, saw that Emson was standing far away with the horses, and that no one else was near.  His next glance was at the cloudless sky, and the dripping eaves, to which a few bright drops still hung and ceased to fall.  Only a rare shower, the man seemed to think; and, muttering to himself, he shuffled a little into a dry spot to lie down yawning, when rush came the rest of the water, deluging him this time, and making him jump up and burst into a torrent of objurgations against the sky in his own tongue, shaking both his fists the while, till, _bang, clatter, crash_! the bucket came rattling down, and he turned and ran out toward where Emson stood looking on.  Dyke descended quickly, and making a circuit, he ran round, and then appeared slowly from the end of a fence fifty yards from the house, walking quietly across to join his brother.  As he drew near, the Kaffir was gesticulating and talking away in broken English, mingled with more words of his own tongue; and when Dyke joined them and took the rein of his little cob, the man turned excitedly to him.  \"What's the matter, Jack?\"  The Kaffir looked at him suspiciously for a moment or two, but Dyke mounted and returned the gaze in the most unruffled manner.  \"Big rain--big wet rain--big water--big bucket--all wet, wet,\" cried the Kaffir.  \"Make the mealies grow,\" said Dyke coolly.  \"Make mealie grow!\" cried the man.  Then a change came over him.  The look of doubt and wonder became one of certainty, and his face expanded into a broad grin which displayed all his white teeth. \"Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!\" he cried, pointing to a couple of wet patches on the leg of the boy's trousers; \"you make rain--Massa Dyky make rain. Wet, wet.  Ah-ah-ah-ah!\"  \"You come along and help drive the ostrich,\" said Dyke, setting his cob to canter; and, followed by the Kaffir at a quick trot, which soon dried up his moisture, they went over the heated red sand toward where the speck in the distance had been pointed out as the object they sought.    CHAPTER THREE.  AN OSTRICH RACE.  \"I say, Joe, you are right,\" said Dyke now, with animation.  \"'Tisn't half so hot riding.\"  \"Of course not.  One begins to get moist, and the sun and air bring a feeling of coolness.  It's only the making a start.  Now then, shall I try to cut him off?\"  \"No, no!\" cried Dyke excitedly; \"I'll do it.  I'll make the brute run. You follow up.\"  \"Right!\" said Emson; \"that is, unless he tracks my way.\"  \"Oh, he won't do that,\" said Dyke, with a merry laugh, and in his animation the boy seemed to be quite transformed.  It was a good long ride to where the ostrich they sought to bring back to its pen could be seen stalking about, looking about as big as a guinea-fowl, but gradually growing taller and taller to its pursuers as they rode on.  After a time it ceased picking about and ran first in one direction and then in another, as if undecided which line of country to take before leading its pursuers a wild race out and across the veldt.  By this time it looked fully four feet high; soon after it was fully five, as it stood up with its neck stretched out, and its weak, large-eyed, flat head turned to them with a malicious expression.  The trio now separated, the horsemen riding more and more apart as they advanced, till they were each a couple of hundred yards from the Kaffir, who suddenly uttered a warning cry, to indicate that the great bird was beginning to run off straight away.  \"All right, Jack, I see,\" cried Dyke; and pressing his cob's sides he went off at a gallop, not, however, in pursuit of the bird, which ran right forward, with its head turned to watch its pursuers all the time.  Dyke's tactics, the result of experience, were of quite another kind. He turned his cob's head, and went off like the wind at right angles to the course the ostrich was taking, and the effect was instantaneous. There was all the open veldt, or plain, spreading out for hundreds of miles before the bird, and it had only to dart off and leave the swiftest horse far behind.  But its would-be cunning nature suggested to it that its enemy had laid a deep scheme to cut it off, and instead of going straight away, it turned on the instant to spin along in the same direction as that taken by the boy, and get right across him.  \"Ah, you silly, muddled-brained, flat-headed idiot!\" yelled Dyke, as he raced along over the plain, his steed sending the red sand flying at every spurn of its hoofs as it stretched itself out.  \"I'll be there first, and cut him off.  You can't do it--you can't do it.  Ah-h-h-h!\"  This last shout, ending in a rattle of the tongue, seemed to stimulate the little cob to make fresh efforts; and laughing merrily to himself in the exhilaration of the race, Dyke had only to keep slightly drawing his left rein, to make the ostrich curve more and more round towards him, till he had actually deluded the bird into taking the exact direction he wished--namely, right for the pens from which it had escaped.  On sped the cob, running over the sand like a greyhound, and on rushed the ostrich, its long legs going with a half-invisible twinkling effect like that produced by the spokes of a rapidly revolving wheel; its wings were half-extended, its plumage ruffled, and its long neck stretched out, with its flattened head slightly turned in the direction of the rider.  And so they rode on and on, till the low range of buildings in front became nearer, the yellow sunflower disks grew bigger, and the sun glared from the white house.  Still the bird saw nothing of this, but continued to run in its curve, trying to pass its pursuer, till all at once it woke to the fact that there was a long range of wire fence before it, over which were bobbing about the heads of Joe Emson's flock of its fellows, and there it was with the fence in front, and the two horsemen and Kaffir behind.  Then there was a change of tactics.  Dyke, who was hundreds of yards in front of his companions, knew what was coming, and gave his short-handled rhinoceros-hide whip a whish through the air, and then cracked it loudly, while a chorus of discordant cries arose from the pens.  \"Give up, you ugly old rascal, or I'll twist this round your long neck,\" cried Dyke; and a great chorus arose from the pens, as if the tame birds within the wire fence were imploring the great truant to be good, and come home.  But nothing was further from the great bird's thoughts.  It could easily now have darted away, but it felt that it was driven to bay, and began to show fight in the most vicious fashion, snapping its flat beak, hissing, snorting, rattling its plumage, and undulating its long neck, as it danced about, till it looked like a boa constrictor which had partially developed into a bird.  Then it dashed at its pursuer, snapping at him in its rushes.  But the bill was not the thing to mind; a few lashes with the whip were enough to ward off its attack.  The danger to be avoided came from those tremendous legs, which could deliver kicks hard enough to break a man's bones.  Three times over did the great bird strike at Dyke, as it was driven down to the pen with lash after lash of the whip, which wrapped"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],["title","Diamond Dyke (#3)"],["body","the neck, as the head rose fully eight feet above the ground.  Then came another stroke which took effect, not upon Dyke's leg, but upon the horse's flank, just behind the stirrup, in spite of the clever little animal's bounds to avoid the kicks.  What followed was instantaneous.  The horse whirled round, snorting with pain, and struck out at his enemy, sending out its heels with such violence and effect, that they came in contact with one of the ostrich's shanks, and the next moment the giant bird came to the ground, a heap of feathers, from which the long neck kept darting, and one leg delivering heavy blows.    CHAPTER FOUR.  ANOTHER FAILURE?  \"Why, Dyke, boy, you've done it now,\" cried Joe Emson, cantering close up, his horse snorting as the ostrich struck at him with its snake-like head.  \"Yes, you had better have left me where I was by the spring,\" said the boy disconsolately.  \"I hated the old wretch, but I didn't want to hurt him.\"  \"I know, my lad, I know,\" said Emson.  \"I'm not blaming you, but it does seem a pity.  What bad luck I do have with these birds, to be sure.--Lie still, you savage; you can't get up!\"  This to the bird, which, after striking at him two or three times, made a desperate effort to rise, fluttering and beating with its wings, and hopping a little, but trailing its broken leg as it made for the pen, within which were all its friends.  \"Yes, you had better have stayed at home, old fellow,\" said Dyke, apostrophising the unhappy bird; \"then you wouldn't have got into this state.--I say, Joe, couldn't we set its leg?  It would soon grow together again.\"  \"If he were one of the quiet old hens, I'd say yes; but it would be impossible.  Directly we went near, there would be a kick or a peck.\"  \"I'll try,\" said Dyke; and going gently toward where the bird lay crouched in a heap, he spoke softly to it, as he had been accustomed to speak to the others when going to feed them.  But his advance was the signal for the bird to draw back its head, its eyes flashing angrily, while it emitted a fierce roaring sound that was like that of some savage, cat-like beast.  It struck out with beak and wings, and made desperate efforts to rise.  \"Stop!\" cried Emson sharply.  \"I'm not afraid,\" cried Dyke.  \"I'll get hold of his neck, and try and hold him.\"  \"I know,\" said his brother; \"but the poor creature will knock itself to pieces.\"  \"But so it will if you leave it quiet,\" cried Dyke; and then, sharply: \"Ah! you cowardly brutes, let him alone.\"  This was to some half-a-dozen cock birds in the pen, which, possibly in remembrance of the many times they had been thrashed and driven about the pen by their injured king, seized the opportunity of his downfall to thrust out their long necks and begin striking at him savagely, seizing him by the feathers, and dragging them out, till he shuffled beyond their reach.  \"His fate's sealed if he is put with the rest; that's very evident,\" said Emson.  \"Killum!\" said the Kaffir, nodding his head.  \"Let's shut him up in the stable,\" said Dyke, \"and tie him down while we set his leg.\"  \"It would mean such a desperate struggle that the poor bird would never get over it; and if it did, it would mope and die.  Better put it out of its misery.\"  Just then a big rough dog came out of the house, where it had been having a long sleep through the hot part of the day, and after giving Dyke a friendly wag of the tail, walked slowly toward the injured ostrich.  That was enough to make the bird draw back its head and strike at the dog, which avoided the blow, and growling fiercely, prepared to resent the attack.  \"Come away, Duke,\" cried Dyke.  \"To heel, sir.\"  The dog growled and seemed to protest, but went obediently behind his younger master.  \"I had better shoot the bird, Dyke,\" said Emson.  \"No, no; don't.  Let's have a try to save it.  Perhaps when it finds that we want to do it good, it will lie quiet.\"  \"No,\" said Emson; \"it will take it as meant for war.\"  \"Well, let's try,\" said Dyke.--\"Here, Breezy: stable.\"  The cob walked slowly away toward its shed, and the other horse followed, while Dyke hurriedly fetched a couple of pieces of rope, formed of twisted antelope skin.  \"What do you propose doing?\" said Emson.  \"All run in together, and tie his neck to one wing; then he'll be helpless, and we can tie his thighs together.  You can set the leg then.\"  \"Well, I'll try,\" said Emson.  \"Wait till I've cut a couple of pieces of wood for splints.  What can I get?\"  \"Bit of box-lid,\" replied Dyke; and in a few minutes Emson returned, bearing in addition a flat roll of stout webbing, such as is used by upholsterers, and by the poor emigrants to lace together across a frame, and form the beds upon which they stretch their weary bones at night.  \"I think I can set it, and secure it,\" said Emson.  \"Why, of course you can.\"  \"Yes, but as soon as it's done, the poor brute will kick it off.  Now then, how about tying him?\"  \"Rush him,\" said Dyke laconically.  \"Come along, Jack, and help.\"  But the Kaffir shook his head rapidly.  \"Why, hullo!  You won't back out, Jack?\"  \"No.  Him kick, bite: no good.\"  \"Never you mind that,\" cried Dyke.  \"You rush in with us, and hold his head, while we take his legs and wings.  Do you understand?\"  \"No,\" said the Kaffir, shaking his head.  \"Killum--killum!\" and he made a gesture as if striking with a club.  \"Not going to kill,\" cried Dyke.  \"You rush in and hold the head.  Do you understand?\"  \"No,\" said the Kaffir.  \"He won't,\" cried Emson.  \"We shall have to do it ourselves, Dyke.  Make a noose and lasso the brute's head.  Then when I run in to seize the leg, you drag the neck tight down to the wing, and hold it there.\"  Dyke nodded, made a noose at the end of his hide rope, and advanced gently toward the ostrich, which struck at him, but only to dart its head through the loop; and this was drawn tight.  \"Now, Joe, ready?\" cried the boy, as the dog set up a furious barking, and joined in the rush that was made by the brothers, who succeeded in pinning down the bird.  Emson holding the legs, while avoiding a buffet from the uppermost wing, Dyke slipped the rope round the bone, dragged down the head, and after a furious struggle, the bird lay still.  \"Think you can manage now?\" panted Dyke, who was hot from exertion.  \"Yes; I'll tie his legs together, after setting the broken one.  It's the only chance for him.\"  \"Yes; it's all right,\" cried Dyke; \"he's getting weaker, and giving in.\"  \"Seems like it,\" said his brother sarcastically, for as the boy spoke, the great bird began to beat with its wings with terrific violence, keeping it up for fully five minutes, and giving the pair a hard task to hold it down, while the Kaffir looked on calmly enough, and the dog kept on charging in, as if eager to seize one of the legs, and hold it still.  \"Well, there then, he is giving in now,\" panted Dyke, who had been compelled to put forth all his strength to keep from being thrown off by the violent buffeting of the bird's wings.  \"Look sharp, and get it done.\"  Dyke got one hand at liberty now to wipe the feather-down from his face, where the perspiration made it adhere, and as he looked up, he could not refrain from laughing aloud at the row of comical flat heads peering over the wire fence, where the ostriches in the pen were gathered together to look on.  \"Yes,\" said Emson gravely; \"he is giving in now, poor brute.  He'll never hunt the young cocks round the enclosure again.\"  \"And they know it, too,\" cried Dyke.  \"Look at them wagging their silly old heads and trying to look cunning.--But hullo why don't you go on?\"  \"Can't you see?\" said Emson.  \"The horse's hoofs must have struck him in the side as well.  The poor old goblin is dead.\"  Dyke leaped to his feet in dismay, and stared sceptically from his brother to the bird, and back again and again.  It was true enough: the great bird, which so short a time ago was seeming to spin with such wonderful speed across the veldt that its legs were nearly invisible, now lay on its side, with the stilt-like members perfectly still, one being stretched out to its full length, the other in a peculiar double angle, through the broken bone making a fresh joint.  \"Oh, the poor old goblin!\" said the boy, hurriedly unloosening the rein which held down its head.  \"I didn't choke it, did I?  No: look, the loop was quite big.\"  \"No; the ribs are crushed in,\" said Emson, feeling beneath the beautiful plumage.  \"Another loss, Dyke.  We shall find out all his good qualities now.\"  \"Breezy kick and killum,\" said the Kaffir sententiously.  \"Bird kick, horse kick; killum--shouldn't kick.\"  \"Here, you go back to your kraal, and set up for a wise man of the south,\" cried Dyke pettishly.  \"How long did it take you to find out all that?\"  \"Yes, killum dead,\" said the Kaffir, nodding.  \"Bosh!\" cried Dyke, turning impatiently away.  \"Well, we must make the best of it,\" said Emson then.  \"His feathers will be worth something, for they are in fine condition.  Let's get them off at once.\"  The heat of the sun was forgotten, and so was Dyke's want of energy, for he set to work manfully, helping his brother to cut off the abundant plumes, tying them up in loose bundles with the quill ends level, that they might dry, and carefully carrying them into the room used for storing feathers, eggs, and such curiosities as were collected from time to time; Dyke having displayed a hobby for bringing home stones, crystals, birds' eggs, and any attractive piece of ore, that he found during his travels.  These were ranged in an old case, standing upright against the corrugated iron wall, where, a few boardings nailed across for shelves, the boy had an extremely rough but useful cabinet, the lid of the case forming the door when attached by a pair of leather hinges tacked on with wire nails.  \"There,\" said Emson, when the last plumes had been removed; \"what do you say to having the skin off?  It will make a mat.\"  Dyke nodded, and the Kaffir now"]]]
