Harold Bond stepped through the doorway, followed by two men. Morely looked at them closely. Engineers, he thought.  \"What have you got?\" he demanded.  One of the men opened a briefcase and removed a large, dully gleaming band. Apparently, it was made of plastic, or some light alloy, for he handled it as though it weighed very little.  As the man laid it on the desk, Morely examined the object closely. It was large enough to go on a man's head, he saw. It had adjustable straps, which could be used to hold it in place, and there were a few spring-loaded contacts, which apparently were meant to rest against a wearer's forehead and temples.  A few tiny knobs protruded from one side of the band, and a short wire, terminated by a miniature plug, depended from the other.  The engineer dipped into his brief case again, to produce a small, flat case with a long wire leading from it. He put this by the headband, and connected the plugs.  \"The band, sir,\" he explained, \"is to be worn on the head.\" He pointed to the flat case. \"To save weight in the band, we built a separate power unit. It can be carried in a pocket. We've tested the unit, sir, and it does provide a means of private communication with anyone within sight, or with a group of people. Two people, wearing the headbands, can communicate for considerable distances, regardless of obstacles.\"  \"I see.\" Morely picked up the headband. \"Do you have more than one of these?\"  \"Yes, sir. We made four of the prototypes and tested them thoroughly.\" Bond stepped forward. \"I sent a report in on them yesterday.\"  \"Yes, yes. I know.\" Morely waved impatiently. He examined the headband again. \"And you say it provides communication?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"No chance of interception?\"  Bond shook his head. \"Well,\" he admitted, \"if two people are in contact, and a third equipped person wishes to contact either one, he can join the conversation.\"  \"So, it's easier to tap than a cable circuit, or even a security type radio circuit.\" Morely frowned. \"Far from a secure means of communication.\"  \"Well, sir, if anyone cuts in on a communication, both parties know it immediately.\"  Morely grunted and shook his head. \"Still not secure,\" he growled. He looked at the papers on his desk. \"Oh, put one on. We'll see how they work.\" He leaned back in his chair.         *       *       *       *       *  Bond turned to the man with the brief case, who held out another headband. The sector leader fitted it to his head, plugged in the power supply and looked around the room. Finally, he glanced at his superior. A shadow of uncertainty crossed his face, followed by a quickly suppressed expression of distaste.  Morely watched him. \"Well?\" he demanded impatiently, \"I don't feel or see anything unusual.\"  \"Of course not, sir,\" explained Bond smoothly. \"You haven't put on the other headband yet.\"  \"Oh? I thought you could establish communication with only one headset, so long as you were in the same room.\"  Bond smiled ingratiatingly. \"Only sometimes, sir. Some people are more susceptible than others.\"  \"I see.\" Morely looked again at the headband, then set it on his head. One of the engineers hurried forward to help him with the power pack, and he looked around the room, becoming conscious of slight sensations of outside thought. As he glanced at the engineers, he received faint impressions of anxious interest.  \"_Can you receive me, sir?_\"  Morely looked at Bond. The younger man was staring at him with an intense expression on his face. The district leader started to speak, then remembered and simply thought the words.  \"_Of course I can. Didn't you expect results?_\"  \"_Oh, certainly, sir. Do you want me to go outside for a further test?_\"  The headband was bothering Morely a little. Unwanted impressions seemed to be hovering about, uncomfortably outside the range of recognition. He took the device off and looked at it again.  \"No,\" he said aloud. \"It won't be necessary. It's obvious to me that this thing will never be any good for practical application in any community communications problem. It's too vague. But it'll make an interesting toy, I suppose. Some people might like it as a novelty, and it'll give them some incentive to do extra work in order to own one. That's what luxury items are for. And the district can use any royalty funds it may generate.\"  He laid the headband on his desk. \"Go ahead and produce a few samples. Offer the designs to Graham's employer. He can offer them on the luxury market, if he wishes, and we'll see what they do. If people want them, it might be profitable, both for the district and for Consolidated.\" He shrugged.  \"No telling what'll make people spend their credits.\" He started to nod a dismissal, then hesitated.  \"Oh, yes. I think I'll keep this one,\" he added. \"And you might leave a couple more. The regional director might be amused by them.\"  He accepted the two headbands and their power packs, put them in a desk drawer, and sat back to watch the three men leave the office.         *       *       *       *       *  After the door closed, he still sat, idly staring at the headband on his desk. He put it on his head again, then sat, looking about the room. There was no unusual effect, and he took the band off again, looked at it sourly, and laid it down.  Somehow, when Bond and those other two had been in the room, he had sensed a vague feeling of expectancy. Those three had seemed to be enthusiastic and hopeful about something, he was sure. But he failed to see what. This headband certainly showed him nothing.  He stared at the band for a while longer, then put it back on and punched the call button on his desk. As his clerk came into sight, he watched the man closely. There _was_ a slight effect. He could sense a vague fear. And a little, gnawing hatred. But nothing was definite, and no details of thought came through. He shrugged.  Of course the man was fearful. He probably was reviewing his recent mistakes, wondering which one he might be called upon to explain. Too bad his mind wasn't clear enough to read. But what could you expect? Possibly, he could drive Research into improving the device later.  \"Anyway,\" he told himself, \"everyone has something they're afraid of. It's natural. And everyone has their pet hates, too.\" For an instant, he thought of Harwood.  He focused his mind on a single thought. \"_Get me the quarters file for Sector Nine._\"  There was a definite effect this time. There was a sharp radiation of pained surprise. Then, there was acquiescence. The clerk started to say something, then backed toward the door. The impression of fear intensified. Morely smiled sardonically. The thing was an amusing toy, at that. He might find uses for it.  He sat back, thinking. He could use it as a detector. Coupled with shrewd reasoning, well-directed questions, and his own accurate knowledge of human failings, it could tell him a great deal about his people and their activities.  For instance, a question about some suspicious circumstance would cause a twinge of fear from the erring person. And that could be detected and localized. Further questions would produce alternate feelings of relief and intensified fear. He nodded complacently. Very little had ever gotten by him, he thought. But from now on, no error would remain undiscovered or unpunished.  The clerk returned to place the file drawers convenient to his superior's desk. He hesitated a moment, his eyes on the headband, then picked up the completed papers from the desk and went out.  Morely riffled through the cards, idly checked a few against his notes, and leaned back again. The file section seemed to be operating smoothly. He looked at his desk. Everything that had to be done immediately was done. And the morning was hardly more than half over.  He rose to his feet. Surely, somewhere in the headquarters, there must be some sort of trouble spot. Somewhere, someone was not producing to the fullest possible. There must be some loose end. And he'd find it. He went out, jerking a thumb back at his office as he passed his clerk's desk.  \"You can pick up those files again, Roberts. And see to it that my office gets cleaned up a little. I won't be back for a while.\"  He went out, to walk down the corridor to the snack bar.         *       *       *       *       *  There were a few girls there. He walked by their table, glancing at their badges. Communications people. He nodded to himself, ordered coffee, and chose a table.  As he glanced at the girls' table, he could detect a current of uneasiness. They'd probably been fooling away more time than they should. Too bad he couldn't get more definite information from their thoughts. Like to know just how long they had been there. He tilted his wrist, taking a long look at his watch. The current of uneasiness increased. No doubt to it, they'd been more than ten minutes already.  The girls hurriedly finished their coffee and left. Morely sipped at his own cup.  At last, he got up and went out. Might be a good idea to visit the Fixed Communications Section. Looked as though there might be a little laxity there.  As he walked down the corridor, he mentally reviewed the operation of communications. There was Fixed Communications, responsible for communicator service to all the offices and quarters in the district, as well as to the various commercial organizations. There were also Mobile Comm, Warning, Long Lines, and Administrative Radio.  Of these, the largest was Fixed Communications, with its dial equipment, its banks of video amplifiers, the network of cables, and the substation equipment. It would take days to thoroughly check all their activities. But the office was the key to the entire operation. He could check their records, and get a clue to their efficiency. And he could question the section chief.  He took the elevator to the communications level and walked slowly along the hallway, glancing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24723"],["title","Final Weapon (#7)"],["body","the heavy steel door leading to Warning as he passed it. That could be checked later, though there would be little point to it.  It had always annoyed him to think of the operators in that section. They simply sat around, doing nothing but watch their screens and keep their few, piddling records. They did nothing productive, but they had to be retained. Actually, he had to admit, they were a necessity under present conditions. War was always a possibility and the enemy was building up his potential. He might strike at any time, and he'd certainly not send advance notification. If he did strike, the warning teams would perform their brief mission, alerting the active, working members of the defense groups. Then, they would be available for defense. And the defense coördinators required warning teams and equipment in prescribed districts. His was one of these.  He grumbled to himself. Even the number of operators and their organization were prescribed. This was a section, right within his own district, where he had little authority. And it was irritating. Drones, that's what they were.  He continued to the Fixed Communications office. Here, at least, he had authority.  He walked through the door, casting a quick glance at the office as he entered. The section chief got up from his chair, and came forward. Morely felt a little glow of satisfaction as he detected the now familiar aura of uneasiness. Again, he wished this device he wore were more effective. He would like to know the details of this man's thoughts.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Good morning, sir.\" The Fixed Communication chief saluted.  Morely returned the salute perfunctorily, then examined the man critically.  \"Morning,\" he acknowledged. \"Kirk, I want you to get some new uniforms. You look like a rag bag.\"  A little anger was added to the uneasiness. Kirk looked down at his clothing. It wasn't new, but there was actually little wrong, other than the slight smudge on a trouser leg, and a few, small spots of dullness on his highly polished boots.  \"I've been inspecting some cable vaults, sir,\" he explained. \"We had a little trouble, due to ground seepage.\"  \"It makes no difference,\" the district leader snorted, \"what you've been doing. A man in your position should be properly attired at all times.\" He paused, looking Kirk over minutely. \"If your cable vaults are in such bad condition, get them cleaned up. When I look your installations over, I shall expect them to be clean. Clean, and in order.\"  He looked beyond Kirk. \"And get that desk cleared. A competent man works on one thing at a time and keeps his work in order. A place for everything, and everything in its place, you know. You don't need all that clutter. Is the rest of your office as disorderly as this?\"  He looked disparagingly about the small room, then turned toward the door to the main communications office. Kirk moved to open the door.  At one side of the large office was a battery of file cabinets. Four desks were arranged conveniently to them. Morely looked at this arrangement.  \"What's this?\"  \"Billing and Directory, sir. These are the master files of all fixed communication subscribers. From them, we make up the semiannual directory, its corrective supplements, and the monthly bills.\"  Morely frowned at the desks and files, then looked at the clerks, who were bent over their desks. As one of the girls straightened momentarily, he recognized her. He'd seen her earlier, in the snack bar. He looked more closely at her desk. She had reason, he thought for that radiation of uncertain fear he could sense.  \"What's in those files?\" he demanded.  \"It's a complete index to all subscribers, sir.\" Kirk looked a little surprised. Morely recognized that the man thought the question a little foolish. He cleared his throat growlingly.  \"Let's see one of those cards.\"  Kirk walked to the file, pulled a small envelope at random, and held it out. The district leader examined it.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. \"I thought so. Duplication of effort. This has nothing on it that isn't in my quarters and locator files.\"  \"There's billing information on the back, sir,\" Kirk, pointed out. \"And current charge slips are kept in the envelope. We use these to prepare the subscriber bills, as well as to maintain the directory service. It's a convenience file, to speed up our work.\"  Morely turned the envelope over in his hands. \"Oh, yes.\" He opened the envelope, to look at the slips inside. \"How do you get the information for these?\"  \"The charge slips come from Long Lines, sir.\" Kirk paused. \"We get billing information for basic billing from the counters in the dial machine. The other information comes from installation reports and from the quarters file section and the locator files.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Morely handed the envelope back.  \"I can see, Kirk,\" he said, \"that you've built up a whole subsection of unnecessary people here.\" He stepped over to the file cabinets, examined their indices, then pulled a drawer open. He pulled his notebook out, consulted its entries, and searched out an envelope. For a moment, he compared it with the notebook. Then, he turned, holding out the envelope.  [Illustration]  \"And you don't even keep your information current,\" he accused. \"This man was transferred yesterday afternoon, to another sector. You still show him at his old quarters, with his old communicator code.\"  \"We haven't that information from Files yet, sir,\" protested Kirk. \"They send us a consolidated list of changes daily, but it generally doesn't come in till thirteen hundred.\"  Morely dropped the envelope on one of the desks.  \"Quarters Files can handle this entire operation,\" he declared, \"with a little help from Fiscal. And they can handle it far better than your people here.\" He stopped for a moment, thinking, then continued. \"Certainly,\" he decided, \"Fiscal can take care of your billing. They handle the funds anyway, in the final analysis. And you can coördinate your directory work with the chief clerk at Files. You've got excess people here, Kirk. We don't need any of them.\"  He looked at the desks and felt a wave of consternation. Kirk spread his hands.  \"But we have the information we need close at hand, sir. Our directory has been coming out on time, and in accurate condition. And our billing is well organized. The directory and billing are my respons--\"  Morely waved a hand, then tapped himself on the chest with a long forefinger. \"The entire operation of this headquarters is my responsibility, Kirk,\" he said positively, \"and mine alone. And I mean to take care of it. You're responsible to me that Fixed Communications are kept in order, and I don't mean to relieve you of a bit of that responsibility. But I won't have you making jobs and wasting funds on excess personnel.\" He snorted. \"Convenience files are all right. But they're meant to save work, not make it.\"  Kirk shook his head. \"A decentralization will make it difficult,\" he began.  Again, Morely cut him off. \"Don't start telling me why you can't do something,\" he snapped. \"Work out a way you _can_ do it. Make up plans for transferring this filing function to Quarters Files, and work up a plan for transferring your billing to Fiscal. That's their business, and they know how to handle it. Submit your study to me this afternoon.\" He looked around the office again.  \"The people in Files and Fiscal can handle this workload without adding a single person. And they will. You're using four clerks to swing it. Kirk, I want this organization to run efficiently, and excess personnel don't lead to economic operation.\" He stared at the section chief.  \"Give these four people their notices today, and I'll expect some suggestions from you as to further streamlining of your section within the next two days. And be sure they're sound suggestions, which result in personnel savings. Otherwise, I'll be looking for a new section chief up here.\"  For a few seconds, he stood, enjoying the waves of consternation and futile anger which beat about him. Almost, he could pick up some of the despairing thoughts in detail. The clerks, of course, were second-class citizens. And without employment, they'd soon lose their luxury privileges. Unless they were fortunate enough to find other employment very soon, they'd have to move to subsistence quarters, and learn to do without all but the most meagre of food, clothing, and shelter. When they did get employment again, they'd appreciate it. He looked majestically around the office once more, then turned and strode away.  He went through the corridor to the elevator, and stepped in, smiling contentedly. The morning hadn't been entirely wasted.  As he got out of the elevator on executive level, he glanced at his watch. It wasn't quite time for lunch, but there would be little point in spending the few remaining minutes in his office. He walked slowly toward the executive cafeteria.         *       *       *       *       *  After lunch, he returned to his office. A few matters awaited his examination and decision, and he busied himself for a short time, disposing of them. He paused over the last.  It was a request from Kirk for more cable construction. The justification showed figures which indicated an increase in executive type communications during the past few months. This, coupled with new quarters construction, necessitated additions to the cable trunks from the main exchange. There was added a short survey of necessary repair to existing cable facilities.  Morely leaned back. If he approved the request, he would be helping Kirk increase his section. On the other hand, if he disapproved it, and the communicator lines became congested, he might find himself open to criticism later. Some of his satisfaction evaporated. He looked sourly at the paper.  Suddenly, he thought of Bond's new project. The man had claimed this device could serve as a communication means between its wearers, and had"]]]
