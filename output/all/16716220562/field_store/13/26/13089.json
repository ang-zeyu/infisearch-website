Among the slain was Lieutenant Gray, whose head was almost severed from his body by a stroke of Robert Sallette's sword.  On many occasions, when a battle was in progress, Sallette would detach himself from the American army, gain the rear of the enemy, and kill many men before he was discovered. If this brave man was indeed a descendant of the Acadians, he avenged the wrongs of many of his countrymen.  Another character who attracted attention during the War of the Revolution was Patrick Carr, whose hatred of the Tories made his name celebrated among the Liberty Boys of Georgia. Paddy Carr, as he was called, lived and died in Jefferson County. He was born in Ireland, but came to Georgia before the Revolution. When the independence movement began, he threw himself into it with all the ardor of his race. Owing to the cruelty of the Tories, he conceived a special hatred against them. He showed them no quarter. History gives but a word or two to his achievements, but tradition still keeps his name alive in the region where he operated. Like Sallette, he was an independent partisan; but, unlike Sallette, his operations were among those who could remember well enough, but who would not take the trouble to preserve the particulars of even the least of his exploits. We know that Patrick Carr lived. We know that he became famous where recklessness and daring were common. But that is nearly all we know. It is said of him that during the war he killed one hundred Tories with his own hands. Once, when praised for his bravery, he smiled and shook his head, saying that he would have made a very good soldier, but the Lord had given him a heart that was too merciful. He no doubt remembered the atrocities of the Tories in the section that is now Jefferson, Columbia, Burke, and Wilkes counties. The cruelties they committed in that region during the Revolution have no parallel in civilized warfare.  Among the adventurous characters of that time, on the side of the British, Daniel McGirth stands easily first. The history of his career during the war is a strange one. He was born in South Carolina, and entered into the struggle against the British with the utmost enthusiasm. He was a brave man, a hard fighter, and one of the most active of those who took up arms against the King. He was an expert woodsman, and was at home in the saddle. He was assigned to duty as a scout, and was better equipped for that service, perhaps, than any man in the American army. The ease with which he secured information of the enemy's movements and plans, and the energy that marked his movements, made his services of great value to the patriot cause. This was not thoroughly appreciated by some of the officers under whom McGirth acted.  He brought with him into the army a mare which he called \"The Gray Goose.\" She is said to have been an elegant animal, and McGirth was very proud of her. With this mare under him, he always felt safe from pursuit. One of the American officers, who was a good judge of horseflesh, and who probably wanted to \"cut a dash,\" as the saying is, saw this beautiful mare, and coveted her. Finding that McGirth scorned all offers to sell her, the officer adopted various means to obtain her. These efforts were resisted by McGirth, mainly on the ground that the mare was his own private property, and that she was essential to the duties he was called on to perform. Failing to gain his ends in this way, the officer continued to worry McGirth in other ways. He no doubt did something to rouse the ire of the scout, who was an irritable man, and who felt the importance of the service he was rendering to the cause. It is not now known how McGirth insulted the officer,--whether in a moment of passion he struck him, or whether he merely used rough language to him.  Whatever the offense, McGirth was placed under arrest, tried by a court-martial, found guilty of violating the articles of war, and sentenced to be whipped. He received this punishment, and was placed in confinement again, where he was to remain until he received another whipping. While thus held, he saw his mare picketed near the camp, and he immediately resolved to escape. He was successful in this. Once free, he secured The Gray Goose, leaped into the saddle, turned around, and, in the face of his pursuers, pronounced threats of vengeance against all the Americans for his ill treatment.  There is no doubt that he was illtreated; but if he had not been an ignorant man, he would not have pronounced against the cause of liberty on account of the treatment he received at the hands of individuals. But the savage in his nature was aroused, and he carried out his fierce threats to the fullest extent. For the time being, he attached himself to another American command; but at the first opportunity he deserted to the enemy, and became the scourge and terror of those who opposed the British cause. He spared none. His field extended from the Florida line to the Savannah River, in what is now Elbert County, and far into South Carolina. He appeared when least expected, and carried destruction with him. His mare became as noted as her master. In what was then Upper Georgia, she was known as \"The Bald-faced Pony.\" On many an occasion he owed his life to the fleetness of his mare. But his vengeance was never satisfied: it was always active, and thirsting for the blood of the American patriot. The whim of the officer to possess McGirth's mare was a foolish one at best. It was the cause of great public and private suffering.  [Illustration: McGirth and his mare 072]  When South Carolina was rescued from the British, McGirth retreated into Georgia, and finally into Florida. When the Spaniards regained possession of that territory, he became subject to their laws. For some reason or other he was thrown into one of the dungeons of the old fort at St. Augustine, where he was confined for five years. When released, his health was broken, and it was with great difficulty that he managed to return to Sumter District, in South Carolina, where his wife lived.  A very queer and eccentric character in the Revolution was Captain Rory Mcintosh, of Mallow. Though Rory was a kinsman of General Lachlan and Colonel John Mcintosh, who were among the most active Liberty Boys in Georgia, he took up arms for the King, and a very devoted Tory he was. His eccentricities would have been called whims if he had not stuck to them with such constancy. He was a Highlander and a follower of the Stuarts. How and why he became loyal to the new line of British kings, history does not state; but his clan had a chief, and he no doubt thought that every government ought to have a monarch. When the Revolution began, he was over sixty years of age, and was living comfortably on his plantation at Mallow; but he volunteered, and fought through the war.  A story is told of Rory Mcintosh that once when the Spaniards held East Florida, he carried to St Augustine a drove of cattle. He received payment in dollars, which he placed in a canvas bag behind him on his horse. When near his home, the bag gave way, and a part of the money fell out. He secured what was left and rode on, paying no attention to that which had fallen from the bag. When in need of money some years after, he returned to the place where the dollars had spilled, picked up as many as he wanted, and went back home. Whenever he could, he went about accompanied by a piper. Rory was a tall, finely formed man,'with bristling whiskers and a ruddy complexion: consequently when he appeared on parade, he attracted great attention.  [Illustration: Captain Rory McIntosh 074]  In 1778 two expeditions were sent from St. Augustine for the purpose of attacking Savannah,--one by sea, and one by land under command of Lieutenant Colonel Prevost. This land expedition had been joined by Captain Roderick Mcintosh, in the capacity of a volunteer. He attached himself particularly to the infantry company commanded by Captain Murray. When the British laid siege to Sunbury and the fort, Captain Murray's company was in the line near the fort. One morning when Captain Rory had had a dram too much, he determined to sally out and summon the fort to surrender. His comrades tried to restrain him, but he was determined. Finally he strutted out, a drawn claymore in his hand, with his trusty slave Jim. He approached the fort and cried out,--  \"Surrender, you miscreants! How dare you presume to resist his Majesty's arms?\"  Colonel Mcintosh, who commanded the fort, saw at once the condition of Captain Rory, and forbade the men to fire. Then he threw open the gate, and said,--  \"Walk in, Mr. Mcintosh, and take possession.\"  \"No,\" cried Rory, \"I'll not trust myself among such vermin. I order you to surrender!\"  At that moment a rifle was fired by some one in the fort, and the ball passed through Captain Rory's face from side to side under the eyes. He fell backwards, but immediately recovered, and stood on his feet flourishing his claymore. Then he began to walk backward, his face to the fort. Several shots were fired at him, and Jim called out,--  \"Run, massa, run! dey kill you!\"  \"Run!\" cried Rory scornfully. \"You may run, but I belong to a race that never runs!\"  It was at the siege of Sunbury that Colonel Mcintosh, when summoned by Colonel Prevost to surrender the fort, sent back the reply, \"Come and take it!\"     AUNT NANCY HART.  There lived in Georgia, during the Revolutionary struggle, the most remarkable woman in some respects that the country has produced. To find her match, we shall have to go to the fables that are told about the Amazons. The Liberty Boys called her Aunt Nancy Hart. The Indians, struck by her wonderful feats in behalf of her country, called her \"The War Woman;\" and there is a creek in Elbert County, where she lived, that was named by the Indians \"War Woman's Creek.\"  There are other heroines to whom history has paid more attention, and whose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24730"],["title","Daniel Boone (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net       Daniel Boone   TAMING THE WILDS     by Katharine E.

At that time this country still belonged to England.  Friendly Indians often came out of the woods to visit the white men. Daniel liked the Indians. He liked them so well that he wished he could live with them.  One day he was taking care of his father's cattle. The pasture was several miles from the settlement. Although Daniel was a ten-year-old boy, he sometimes became lonely by himself.  Today he lay on a hillside and sang aloud. He wanted to hear a voice, even if it was only his own.  There was a low laugh behind him. Daniel sprang to his feet. A tall, slim Indian boy stood a few feet away. The white boy liked him at once.  \"I sing, too,\" the young Indian said.  He threw back his head and sang. Daniel could not understand a word.  \"I sing to the sun and the wind and the rain,\" the boy explained.  \"I like your Indian song,\" Daniel said, \"but I'm glad you speak English.\"  The boy patted the bow that hung over his right shoulder. \"You like this?\"  The bow was strong and shining. Daniel ran a finger along the smooth wood.  \"I like it very much,\" he said.  The other boy took an arrow and placed it on the bowstring. He pulled back the bow. The arrow flew away.  \"You get,\" the Indian said.  Daniel ran after the arrow. He picked it up and looked back. The Indian boy was right beside him.  He took the arrow from Daniel. Again he shot it. Again the white boy ran after it. The young Indian ran beside him.  He shook his head when Daniel handed him the arrow.  He handed Daniel the bow.  \"Shoot!\" he said.  Daniel took the bow in his hands. He pulled it back and let the arrow fly.  By now Daniel had forgotten the cattle. He had forgotten everything but the wonderful bow, his new friend, and the wide, wild woods.  After a while the boys came to a high hill. At the bottom was an Indian village. The brown-skinned boy took Daniel by the hand and ran toward the settlement.  Several dogs barked at them. Some women were hoeing their gardens. They hardly looked up as the boys passed.  An old woman was stirring something in an iron pot over a fire. It smelled good. Daniel remembered that he had eaten nothing since breakfast.  His friend stopped and pointed to Daniel and himself. The old woman nodded. With a sharp stick, she lifted a piece of meat from the pot.  The Indian boy took a broad leaf from a near-by bush. The woman dropped the hot meat on it.  Now Daniel knew what to do. He, too, found a leaf. The woman gave him some meat. Soon the hungry boys had finished their lunch.  That afternoon they swam in the clear, broad river. Then they lay on the bank in the sunshine. Daniel had never been so happy. However, he knew he must soon go home. His mother would worry if he did not return before dark.  \"I must go now. I must drive the cows home,\" he told his Indian friend.  The boy frowned. \"Women's work,\" he told Daniel.  Daniel laughed. \"It may be for the Indians, but it's not at the Boones' house. I think I'd like being an Indian. An Indian boy has more fun than a white boy.\"  \"There is much for an Indian to learn,\" the other told him. \"We must learn to hunt, track animals, fish, and find our way in the wilderness.\"  \"Those things are not work. They are fun,\" Daniel told him. \"I wish I were an Indian. I believe I'd make a better Indian than a white boy.\"  When Daniel reached home at last, his mother scolded him.  \"You should not have gone off with that Indian boy. You can't trust the Indians,\" she told her son.  \"He was a good boy. I liked him,\" Daniel said.  His mother shook her head. \"Indians are not like us. We think differently from them.\"  Daniel said nothing. But he thought his mother was mistaken.  \"_I believe I can think like an Indian_,\" he said to himself. \"_Except for color, I'm more like an Indian than a white boy._\"     Moving On   Several years went by. Then Father Boone called the family together. \"Pack your things,\" he told them. \"We are leaving here. Boones never stay long in one place. Besides, our farm land is worn out. We can buy rich land cheap to the southwest of here. We will settle there.\"  Sixteen-year-old Daniel was happy. \"I'm glad we are going,\" he said. \"I feel crowded here. There are too many houses and too many people. And the game is getting scarce.\"  Father Boone made ready for the journey. He got out the big wagon and hitched two horses to it. Mother Boone packed clothes, quilts, dishes, pots, pans, and kettles. She would fix food for the family along the way. Daniel tied a cow behind the wagon.  The family said good-by to the neighbors and to their old home, and started. Mother, the girls, and the little children rode in the wagon. Father and the boys took turns riding the horses. Sometimes all of the Boones walked so that the horses could rest. Father and the boys had guns to kill birds and small animals for food along the way.  The Boones traveled across Pennsylvania. On and on they went toward the new country. Daniel caught many rabbits, which his mother stewed. Once he shot a small black bear. Another time he killed a deer. This gave the Boones food for several days.  At last the family came to the rolling, green Yadkin Valley in North Carolina. There were a few houses there already, but it was much wilder than in Pennsylvania.  Father Boone said, \"This is good farming land. We will stop here.\"  Daniel looked all about him. There was level land close by. There were woods not far away. And there were mountains in the west. Daniel knew the hunting would be good.  \"I like this place,\" he said. \"There's plenty of room here.\"  Father Boone and the boys jumped off the horses. Mother Boone and the girls climbed down from the wagon. They fed the horses and the cow. They made a campfire. Father and the boys cut down trees and started to build a log house. Soon the Boones had a new home in the new land.  The years went by. Daniel grew taller. His shoulders became wider. He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, lean and rugged. He hunted in the woods of the Yadkin Valley. He often brought home deer and bear. The Boones' neighbors said that Daniel was the best shot for miles around. Daniel Boone had grown up.     A Knock at the Door   When Daniel Boone was a young man, there was war between England and France. England sent troops to fight against the French in America. The French claimed the land west of the mountains. The English claimed the same land. The Indians sided with the French.  Daniel Boone drove a supply wagon for the English and the Americans. He made friends with another young wagoner named John Finley. Finley had been to the land southwest of the mountains. Each night he and Boone sat by the campfire and talked.  \"I've been deep in the wilderness they call Kentucky,\" Finley told Boone. \"It is a wonderful place. The forests go on and on and on. There are thousands of buffalo in Kentucky. There are deer, bear and small animals, too. It is a great land for hunters.\"  \"I want to go there,\" Daniel said.  \"There are Indians in the wilderness,\" Finley told Daniel. \"They live to the north of Kentucky and to the south of Kentucky. They call the land their hunting ground. They do not like the white men to go there.\"  \"There should be room enough for both Indians and white men,\" Daniel Boone replied. He thought for a while. \"Some day I am going to Kentucky.\"  When Daniel went back home to the Yadkin Valley, he married a tall, dark-haired girl named Rebecca Bryan. Sometimes he liked to tease her. One summer day before they married he was sitting beside her under a big tree. Suddenly he took his broad-bladed knife and cut a long slit in her fresh white apron.  \"Why did you do that, Daniel?\" she asked mildly.  His blue eyes twinkled. \"I guess I wanted to see if you had a temper,\" he said.  Because she wasn't angry, Daniel felt that she would make him a good wife. Life in the wilderness was often difficult and dangerous. He wanted a wife who did not become upset easily.  They were married, and soon the"]]]
