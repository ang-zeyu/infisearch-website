The level edge of the German trench suddenly became serrated with bobbing heads, flickered with moving figures, and the next moment was hidden by the swarm of men that leaped from it and came charging across the open. This line too withered and wilted under the fire that smote it, but it gathered itself and hurled on again.  The Forward Officer called down the shortening ranges to the guns, and the answering shrapnel fell fiercely on the German line and tore it to fragments--but the fragments still advanced.  The remnant of the British line rose and flung forward to meet it, and as the two clashed the supports from either side poured out to help.  As the dense mass of Germans emerged, and knitted into close formation, the Forward Officer reeled off swift orders to the telephone.  The shrieking tempest of his shells fell upon the mass, struck and slew wholesale, struck and slew again.  The mass shivered and broke; but although part of it vanished back under the cover of the trench, although another part lay piled in a wreckage of dead and wounded, a third part straggled forward and charged into the fight. The British line was overborne, and pushed struggling back until new supports brought it fresh life and turned the tide again.  The Germans surviving the charge were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners, and the Forward Officer, lifting his fire and pouring it on the German trench, checked for the moment any further rush of reinforcements.  The British line ran forward to a field track running parallel to the trenches and nearly midway between them, flung itself down to escape the bullets that stormed across and began, as rapidly as the men's cramped position would allow, to dig themselves in.  To their right and left the field track sank a foot or two below the surface of the field, and this scanty but precious shelter had allowed the rest of the line to stop half-way across and hold on to get its breath and allow a constant spray of supports to dash across the open and reinforce it.  Now, the centre, where the track ran bare and flat across the field, plied frantic shovels to heap up some sort of cover that would allow them also to hang on in conformation of the whole line and gather breath and reinforcements for the next rush.  The Germans saw plainly enough what was the plan, and took instant steps to upset it.  Their first and best chance was to thrust hard at the weak and ill-protected centre, overwhelm it and then roll up the lines to right and left of it.  A tornado of shell fire ushered in the new assault.  The shells burst in running crashes up and down the advanced line, and up and down the British trench behind it; driving squalls of shrapnel swept the ground between the two, and, in addition, a storm of rifle and machine-gun bullets rained along the scanty parapet, whistled and droned and hissed across the open.  And then, suddenly, the assault was launched from all along the German line.  At the same instant a shell struck the wall of the Forward Officer's station, burst with a terrific crash, swept three parts of the remaining wall away in a cloud of shrieking splinters and swirling dust of brick and plaster, and threw the Forward Officer headlong half a dozen yards.  By some miracle he was untouched.  His first thought was for the telephone--the connecting link with his guns.  He scrambled over the debris to the dug-out or shelter-pit behind his corner and found telephonist and telephone intact.  He dropped on hands and knees and crawled over the rubble and out beyond the end of the wall, for the cloud of smoke and plaster and brick-dust still hung heavily about the ruin.  Here, in the open as he was, the air sang like tense harp-strings to the passage of innumerable bullets, the ground about his feet danced to their drumming, flicked and spat little spurts of mud all over him.  But the Forward Officer paid little heed to these things.  For one moment his gaze was riveted horror-stricken on the scene of the fight; the next he was on his feet, heedless of the singing bullets, heedless of the roar and crash of another shell that hit the ground and flung a cart-load of earth and mud whizzing and thumping about him, heedless of everything except the need to get quickly to the telephone.  'Tell the Battery, Germans advancing--heavy attack on our front!' he panted to the telephonist, jumped across to his corner, and heaved himself up into place.  The dust had cleared now, so that he could see. And what he could see made him catch his breath.  An almost solid line of Germans were clear of their trenches and pushing rapidly across the open on the weak centre.  And the Battery's shells were falling behind the German line and still on their trenches.  Swiftly the Forward Officer began to reel off his corrections of angles and range, and as the telephonist passed them on gun after gun began to pitch its shells on the advancing line.  The British rifles were busy too, and their fire rose in one continuous roar.  But the fire was weakest from the thin centre line, the spot where the attack was heaviest.  The guns were in full play again, and the shells were blasting quick gaps out of the advancing line.  But the line came on.  The rifles beat upon it, and a machine-gun on the less heavily pressed left turned and mowed the Germans down in swathes. Still the line came on stubbornly.  It was broken and ragged now, and advanced slowly, because the front ranks were constantly melting away under the British fire.  The Forward Officer watched with straining eyes glued to his glasses.  A shell 'whooped' past close over his head, and burst just beyond him.  He neither turned his head nor moved his glasses.  One, two, three, four burst short, and splinters and bullets sang past him; two more burst overhead, and the shrapnel clashed and rattled amongst the stone and brick of the ruins.  Without moving, the Forward Officer began to call a fresh string of orders.  The rush of his shells ceased for a moment while the gunners adjusted the new angles and ranges.  'Number One fired.  Two fired.  Three, Four, Five, Six fired, sir,' called the telephonist, and as he spoke there came the shrieks of the shells, and the white puffs of the bursts low down and between the prone British line and the advancing Germans.  'Number Three, one-oh minutes more left!' shouted the Forward Officer. 'Number Five, add twenty-five--repeat.'  Again came the running bursts and puffing white smoke, and satisfied this time with their line, position, and distance, the Forward Officer shouted for 'Gun-fire,' jumped down and across to the telephonist's shelter-pit.  'I'm putting a belt of fire just ahead of our line,' he shouted, curving his fingers about his lips and the mouthpiece in an attempt to shut out the uproar about them.  'If they can come through it we're done--infantry can't hold 'em.  Give me every round you can, and as fast as you can, please.'  He ran back to his place.  A cataract of shells poured their shrapnel down along a line of which the nearest edge was a bare twenty yards from the British front.  The Forward Officer fixed his eyes on the string of white smoke-puffs with their centre of winking flame that burst and burst and burst unceasingly.  If one showed out of its proper place he shouted to the telephonist and named the delinquent gun, and asked for the lay and fuse-setting to be checked.  The advancing Germans reached at last the strip of ground where his shrapnel hailed and lashed, reached the strip and pushed into it--but not past it.  Up to the shrapnel zone the advance could press; through, it could not.  Under the shrapnel nothing could live.  It swept the ground in driving gust on gust, swept and besomed it bare of life. Here and there, in ones and twos and little knots and groups, the Germans strove desperately to push on.  They came as far as that deadly fire belt; and in ones and twos and little knots and groups they stayed there and died.  Supports hurried up and hurled themselves in, and a spasm of fresh strength and fury lifted the line and heaved it forward. So far the fire of its fury brought it; and there the hosing shrapnel met it, swept down and washed it away, and beat it out to the last spark and the last man.  But from the German trenches another assault was forming, from the German batteries another squall of shell-fire smote the British line; and to his horror, the Forward Officer saw his own shells coming slower and slower, the smoke-bursts growing irregular and slower again.  He leaped down and rushed to the telephone.  Back in the Battery the telephone wires ran into a dug-out that was the brain-centre of the guns, and from here the Forward Officer's directions emerged and were translated to the gunners through the Battery Commander and the Battery Sergeant-Major's megaphone.  All the morning the gunners followed those orders blindly, sluing the hot gun-muzzles a fraction this way or that, making minute adjustments on sights and range drums and shell fuses.  They could see no glimpse of the fight, but, more or less accurately, they could follow its varying fortunes and trace its movements by the orders that came through to them.  When they had to send their shells further back, the enemy obviously were being pressed back; when the fire had to be brought closer the enemy were closer.  An urgent call for rapid fire with an increasing range meant our infantry attacking; with a lessening range, their being attacked.  Occasionally the Battery Commander passed to the Section Commanders items of news from the Forward Officer, and they in turn told the 'Numbers One' in charge of the guns, and the gun detachments.  Such a message was passed along when the Forward Officer telephoned news of the heavy pressure on the weakened centre.  Every man in the Battery knew what was expected, and detachment vied with detachment"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25079"],["title","Queensland Cousins (#0)"],["body","COUSINS       [Illustration: It was the great native chief.]      QUEENSLAND     COUSINS      BY      E.

Oh, do be quick, father!\"  The cry rang out lustily from three young voices, three eager heads were thrust over the veranda railings. Below, on horseback, was a big, brown-haired, brown-bearded man, who looked up from under his soft slouch hat with a laugh, and exclaimed,--  \"What has come, you outrageously noisy youngsters? One would think I had a family of dingoes, to hear you.\"  Then another head appeared over the railings--a gentle-faced, fair-haired woman looked down.  \"It is the parcel from home, Jack,\" she said. \"Hadji brought it up an hour ago.\"  \"Yes, yes, father; it is the parcel from England at last, and mother wouldn't open it till you came, so we have been waiting a whole hour--the longest hour I have ever lived.\"  Nesta Orban, to whom one of the first heads over the railing belonged, shook back her masses of fair, fluffy hair with an impatient little toss.  \"Stuff, Nesta; you always say that,\" exclaimed Eustace, her twin of fourteen. \"You said it yesterday coming through the scrub because you were tired; and the day before when mother made you sew for an hour instead of reading; and the day before--\"  \"Oh, shut up!\" Nesta retorted. \"You needn't quote pages from my biography like that. Let's think about the parcel.--Hurry up, dad, darling.\"  This last she called after her father, for Mr. Orban had not stayed a second after his wife's explanation of the excitement.  \"The parcel from home,\" he repeated, all the laughter dying out of his face, and he spurred his horse into a trot round the house towards the stable.  The heads all came back into the veranda, and there fell a hush of expectancy as every one listened for Mr. Orban's footsteps coming up through the house.  \"La, la, la! look, Nesta. Dolly downside up; Becky done it,\" piped a little voice from the floor.  \"Oh, do be quiet, Becky. Think about the parcel from England. Perhaps there is something in it for you,\" said Nesta.  Mrs. Orban had seated herself again in a low wicker chair, and was busy sewing--patching a well-worn shirt with utmost patience.  \"Don't be cross with Becky,\" she said gently. \"She can't be expected at two years old to realize the meaning of a parcel from home. I don't believe you do yourself, Nesta. It is just a lot of nice things from England to you--only to father and me is it 'a parcel from home.'\"  Nesta flushed a little and looked grave as she stood by the table fingering the string of the wonderful parcel. Such a lot of string there was, and so much sewing and writing! Whatever it might contain, at least the parcel looked interesting.  The owner of the third head that had looked over the veranda railing to shout the news was ten-year-old Peter. It always seemed to Nesta and Eustace that he was ever so much younger than they were--perhaps because he had been the baby for so many years, till Becky came.  \"Mother,\" said Peter, setting himself right in front of her, and staring at her with wide blue eyes, \"why don't you and father live in England when you want to so much?\"  Peter was fair, and very like his mother and Nesta. Eustace and little Becky were the two who were like their father, brown-haired and brown-eyed. Peter had a delicate, sensitive face, and he was always wondering about things in a queer, dreamy sort of way.  \"It is easier said than done, my little son,\" Mrs. Orban answered, bending low over her sewing that the child might not see the tears his question had brought to her eyes. \"Father must work.\"  \"But couldn't he work in England just as well as Queensland?\" asked Peter.  \"Unfortunately not,\" said his mother sadly. \"Work is not easy to get in England, or anywhere for the matter of that.\"  Eustace caught the note of sadness in his mother's voice, and strolling behind Peter he gave him a kick on the ankle with all the air of its being accidental.  \"Ow-wow-wow!\" exclaimed Peter, hopping on one leg and holding on to the other. \"You hurt me.\"  \"Sorry,\" said Eustace carelessly, following him across the veranda.  \"La, la, la! dolly upside downey,\" crooned Becky from the floor, where she sat deeply engaged in trying to make her boy doll stand on its head as she had seen Eustace do.  \"Look here,\" said Eustace under cover of Becky's singing, \"don't ask stupid questions, Peter. It always makes mother feel bad to talk about England--any silly could see that without being told, I should think.\"  But Peter looked surprised.  \"Then you kicked me on purpose,\" he said, no louder than Eustace had spoken.  \"Of course,\" said Eustace.  \"What for?\" demanded Peter, flushing hotly.  \"To make you shut up, that's all,\" Eustace said coolly.  Peter dropped his injured leg and flung himself upon his brother with doubled fists.  \"How dare you, you--you horrid boy!\" he said chokily, for Peter's temper always sprang out like a sheet of flame up muslin curtains.  With a queer little smile, Eustace gripped his slender wrists, and held them so that the little chap could do nothing but wriggle about like an eel.  \"Let me go, I say,\" he said; \"let me go, I tell you. I won't be held like a baby.\"  He had about as much strength as a baby in Eustace's grip, for the elder boy was a well-built, square-shouldered fellow, and powerful for his age.  Mrs. Orban looked up at the commotion, and wondered what it could be all about so suddenly.  \"As you are strong, be merciful, Eustace,\" she said quietly--that was all.  Eustace instantly let go, and Peter stood for a second staring down at the two red rings round his wrists, then, as Eustace turned unconcernedly away, dashed at his back and pommelled it.  \"Go on,\" said Eustace with seeming carelessness, but the words were jerked out by the thumps; \"my coat hasn't had a brushing for a week. Glad to get the dust out of it.\"  \"Peter, Peter,\" said his mother warningly, \"you surely don't want to be sent away before the parcel is opened, do you?\"  This stopped Peter effectually; a minute later he had forgotten his grievance, which was also Peter's way.  \"So the great day has come at last,\" said Mr. Orban, coming out from the house on to the veranda, which was so large and spacious that it was as useful to the household as several extra rooms.  Mrs. Orban put away her sewing, and every one gathered round the table as Mr. Orban began carefully undoing the string.  \"Here's my knife, father,\" Eustace said, with a pleading note in his voice.  \"Plenty of time, my lad,\" Mr. Orban said quietly. \"One doesn't get a bit of string like this every day.\"  Becky had become infected by the excitement at last, and now insisted upon being held up in her mother's arms. All the eager eyes were bent on Mr. Orban's hands as he skilfully untied knot after knot.  \"You won't unpick the sewing on the American cloth too, will you?\" asked Nesta anxiously.  \"No; I think we can cut that, Miss Impatience,\" laughed her father. \"Mother could hardly use it again even for hemming floor-cloths.\"  \"I'm not so sure, Jack,\" said Mrs. Orban; \"my stock of cottons is running very low. It is time you went away and brought me a fresh supply.\"  Mr. Orban undid the last knot, but instead of taking the knife Eustace was still patiently holding out, he began winding up the string into a neat coil. The children glanced up in desperation, to find his face grave and preoccupied. He looked as if he had entirely forgotten the parcel.  \"What is it, dear?\" said Mrs. Orban, with sudden alarm in her voice. \"Is anything wrong?\"  Mr. Orban roused himself with an effort.  \"Oh no,\" he replied slowly; \"nothing wrong exactly. Only your words struck me oddly, for, as a matter of fact, I have to go away, and soon too.\"  Eustace glanced quickly at his mother, and the look in her eyes made him forget the parcel too.  \"Not far, Jack, I hope,\" she said.  \"Rather, I'm afraid,\" was the answer. \"I hope you won't mind being left for a week or two.\"  \"A week or two!\" exclaimed Mrs. Orban in a tone that was unmistakably disturbed.  \"I can't do it in less,\" Mr. Orban went on. \"I am obliged to go down to Brisbane on business.\"  \"To Brisbane!\" Nesta cried. \"O dad, couldn't you take us all with you? It would be lovely!\"  \"If you will find the fares, young woman, I shall be delighted,\" said her father, pinching her ear. \"The journey to Brisbane is rather an expensive matter. I couldn't afford to take myself there just for the fun of the thing.\"  \"When must you go, Jack?\" asked Mrs. Orban, trying hard to speak steadily and naturally.  \"Next week--as soon as possible, that is,\" Mr. Orban said; \"and I will get back just as quick as I can. You will be all right, dear. I will tell Farley or Robertson to"]]]
