We thought he was going to carry the dog off to some place, and take care of him like he was his master, or may be shut him up, or something that way; but, do you believe, he just _shot_ that dog right in the yard!\"  \"How dreadful!\"  \"Yes, auntie, I reckon it was! We all cried like we should kill ourselves, and put our fingers in our ears; for we heard the man when he fired the gun,--I mean we heard the gun when the man fired it,--and _then_ it was of no use; but we stopped our ears, and Miss All'n hid her face, and cried--and cried--and cried!\"  \"O dear me, it did seem like we didn't any of us want to go to school any more, if we couldn't see our old dog coming to meet us, and rub his head against our dresses. And it was just as lonesome,--now it was _so_, auntie.\"  \"Poor old doggie!\" sighed aunt Madge.  \"It wasn't you, was it, Pincher,\" cried Horace, seizing his dog by both ears. \"I reckon if they tried to shoot you they'd catch it.\"  \"Now, Susy, it's your turn,\" said Grace.  \"No, Horace's; he's the oldest.\"  \"Pshaw!\" returned Horace, who had been the very first one to propose stories, \"I'd like to get shut of it. Pshaw! I can't think of nothin'.\"  \"But you must, you know, Horace; so it's no use to grumble.\"  \"O shucks! Has it got to be true?\"  \"Don't say 'shucks,' Horace,\" said Grace, gently. \"You can tell a true story, or make it up as you go along.--Come, hurry.\"  \"I know what _I'm_ goin' to tell,\" whispered Prudy to Horace.  \"Well,\" said the boy, thinking a moment, \"I'll tell my story double quick, and be done with it.\"  \"You'd ought to see my pa's horse out West, auntie; there ain't a Yankee horse can hold a candle to him; I'll leave it to Pincher. His name is Sancho, and my ma sends him to market mornings, early, with the basket, and puts some money in, and a note to the butcher, and that horse comes back, sir, just as fast as he can trot, sir, and he has the meat there all wrapped up, and just has the basket in his teeth, this way.\"  \"Why, Horace Clifford!\" cried Grace, in surprise; \"why, what a story!\"  \"Of course it's a story. You wanted me to tell a story, didn't you? I was just a-blowin'.\"  \"Well, there, tell something nice, can't you, please?\"  \"I've told all the story I'm a-goin' to,\" said Horace, firmly. \"Now it's Susy's turn.\"  \"You talk about something else a while,\" replied Susy, \"and let me be a-thinkin'.\"  \"I'll tell one,\" cried Prudy, \"let _me_, now.\"  \"Once there was goin' to be three balls, and Cindrilla didn't have no mother, and her father didn't have no wife, so he married him one. And there was goin' to be three great big balls, and Cindrilla asked her mother if she couldn't go, and her mother said, No, indeed; she hadn't nothin' to wear. And then they started off, and her grandma came,--O, I forgot, the woman was wicked, and she made her little girls sit in the parlor, all dressed up spandy clean, and she made Cindrilla sit in the coal-hod.\"  \"And then she told her to get a great punkin, and it turned into a gold hack, and she went off into the back shed and got the rat-trap, and it turned into two footmens,--and the king's son--O, no----\"  \"And then there was some bugs round there, and they was six horses, and she got in and rode on to the ball, and her shoes come off, and then the king married her, and she had the other shoe in her pocket, and he married her right off, and they're all safe now.\"  \"All safe?\" said aunt Madge, laughing; \"what do you mean by that?\"  \"O, now she'll have a good father and a good mother, and won't sit in the coal-hod no more.--Now it's your turn, Susy.\"  \"O dear suz! I was going to tell a story, a fairy story. It was going to be a real good one, about 'The Bravest of Lion's Castle,' and I couldn't think of a thing to say, and now Prudy has drove it all out of my head.\"  \"Well, children,\" said aunt Madge, \"suppose we give Susy a little more time, and excuse her for to-night? It's time for pleasant dreams now, and kisses all 'round.\"     CHAPTER XI  PRUDY'S WHITE TEA   \"Blessings on the blessed children!\" said aunt Madge, one morning soon after this. \"So we little folks are going out to spend the day, are we?\"  \"Yes'm,\" replied Grace, \"all but Horace.\"  \"Yes,\" said Prudy, dancing in high glee, \"grandma wants _me_ to go, and I'm goin'. I mean to do every single thing grandma wants me to.\"  \"I wish you could go with us, aunt Madge,\" said Grace, almost pouting; \"we don't have half so good times with aunt Louise.\"  \"No, we don't,\" cried Prudy; \"she wants us to 'take care' all the time. She don't love little girls when she has 'the nervous.'\"  Almost while they were talking, their aunt Louise came into the room, looking prettier than ever in her new pink dress. She was a very young lady, hardly fifteen years old.  \"Come, Prudy,\" said she, smiling, \"please run up stairs and get my parasol--there's a darling.\"  But Prudy was picking a pebble out of her shoe, and did not start at once.  \"Ah!\" said aunt Louise, drawing on her gloves, \"I see Prudy isn't going to mind me.\"  \"Well, don't you see me getting up out of my chair?\" said Prudy. \"There now, don't you see me got clear to the door?\"  \"O dear,\" said poor aunt Louise to her sister, \"what shall I do all this long day with three noisy children? I'm afraid some of them will get drowned, or run over, or break their necks. You see if something awful doesn't happen before we get back.\"  \"O, I hope not,\" replied sister Madge, laughing. \"I think there is nothing so very wicked about our little nieces.\"  \"Here is your parasol, auntie,\" said Prudy, coming back. \"I know who I love best of any body in this house, and it ain't the one that's got her bonnet on--it's a-r-n-t, aunt, M-i-g, Madge.\"  \"Well, you ought to love your aunt _Mig_, all of you,\" said aunt Louise, laughing, \"for I do believe she thinks you children are as lovely as little white rose-buds.--Come, are you all ready? Then run along, and I'll follow after.\"  \"O, I'm so glad I'm alive!\" cried little Prudy, hoping on one foot; \"I do hope I shall never die!\"  \"I just mean to be careful, and not get a speck of dirt on my clean apron,\" whispered Susy to Grace. \"Aunt Madge ironed it this morning.\"  They had such a pleasant walk through the streets of the beautiful village, in the \"sunshine, calm and sweet!\" Grace thought the trees met overhead just as if they were clasping hands, and playing a game of \"King's Cruise\" for every body to \"march through.\"  When they had almost reached aunt Martha's house, aunt Louise stopped them, saying,--  \"Now, tell me if you are going to be good children, so I shan't be ashamed of you?\"  \"Why, yes, auntie,\" said Grace, looking quite grieved and surprised.  \"O, auntie,\" said Susy, \"did you think we were going to be naughty?\"  \"No, you'll mean to be good, I dare say,\" answered aunt Louise, speaking more kindly,--\"if you don't forget it. And you'll be a nice, dear little girl, won't you, Prudy?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Prudy, coolly.  \"Don't _know_? Why, do you think I should have taken you visiting if I hadn't supposed you'd try to be good?\"  \"Well, I didn't say I wouldn't,\" said Prudy, with some dignity, \"I said 'I don't know,' and when I say that, I mean '_yes_.'\"  \"Well, I'm sure I hope you'll do the very best you can,\" sighed aunt Louise, \"and not make any body crazy.\"  By this time they had gone up the nice gravel walk, and aunt Martha had come to the door, opening her arms as if she wanted to embrace them all at once.  \"Dear little souls,\" said she, \"come right into the house, and let me take off your things. I've been looking for you these two hours. This is my little nephew, Lonnie Adams.--Shake hands with the little girls, my dear.\"  Lonnie was a fair-haired, sickly little boy, seven years old. The children very soon felt at ease with him.  It was so pleasant in aunt Martha's shaded parlor, and the children took such delight in looking at the books and pictures, that they were all sorry when aunt Louise \"got nervous,\" and thought it was time they went off somewhere to play.  \"Very well,\" said dear aunt Martha; \"they may go all over the house and grounds, if they like, with Lonnie.\"  So all over the house and grounds they went in a very few minutes, and at last came to a stand-still in Bridget's chamber over the kitchen, tired enough to sit down a while--all but Prudy, who \"didn't have any kind of _tiredness_ about her.\"  \"Look here, Prudy Parlin,\" said Grace, \"you mustn't open that drawer.\"  \"Who owns it?\" said Prudy, putting in both hands.  \"Why, Bridget does, of course.\"  \"No, she doesn't,\" said Prudy, \"God owns this drawer, and he's willing I should look into it as long as I'm a mind to.\"  \"Well, I'll tell aunt Louise, you see if I don't. That's the way little Paddy girls act that steal things.\"  \"I ain't a stealer,\" cried Prudy. \"Now, Gracie Clifford, I saw you once, and you was a-nippin' cream out of the cream-pot. _You're_ a Paddy!--O, here's _a ink-stand_!\"  \"Put it right back,\" said Susy, \"and come away.\"  \"Let me take it,\" cried Lonnie, seizing it out of Prudy's hand, \"I'm going to put it up at auction. I'm Mr. Nelson, riding horseback,\" said he, jumping up on a stand. \"I'm ringin' a bell. 'O yes! O yes! O yes! Auction at two o'clock! Who'll buy my fine, fresh ink?'\"  \"Please give it to me,\" cried Grace; \"it isn't yours.\"  \"'Fresh ink, red as a lobster!'\"  \"This minute!\" cried Grace.  \"'As green as a pea! Who'll bid? Going! Going!'\"  \"Now, do give it to me, Lonnie,\" said Susy, climbing into a chair, and reaching after it; \"you ain't fair a bit.\"  \"'Do you say you bid a _bit_? That's a ninepence, ma'am. It's yours; going, gone for a ninepence. Knocked off to Miss Parlin.'\"  Somehow, in \"knocking it off,\" out came the stopper, and over went the ink on Susy's fair white apron. Lonnie was dreadfully frightened.  \"Don't tell that I did it!\" cried he. \"You know I didn't mean any harm. Won't you promise not to tell?\"  \"Yes, I will,\" said Susy; but she ought not to have promised any such"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24711"],["title","Little Prudy (#8)"],["body",".  \"O, dear, O dear! What is to be done?\"  Little black streams were trickling down the apron on to the dress. Grace pulled Susy to the washing-stand, and Prudy thought she meant to lift her into it, and tried to help.  \"I guess this honey soap will take it out,\" said Susy; but with all their washing and rinsing they could not make black white any more than the poor negro who scoured his face.  \"Stop a minute!\" cried Grace. \"Soap makes it worse--ma puts on milk.\"  \"O dear! I wish we had some,\" said Susy; \"how can we get it?\"  \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Grace; \"we'll send Prudy down stairs to Bridget, to ask for some milk to drink.\"  \"I like milk and water the best,\" said Prudy, \"with sugar in.\"  \"Well, get that,\" said Grace, \"it's just as good; and come right back with it, and don't tell about the ink.\"  Aunt Martha and Bridget were taking up the dinner when Prudy went down into the kitchen, calling out,--  \"O, Bridget, may I have some white tea?\"  \"White _tay_!\" said Bridget; \"and what may that be now?\"  \"O, some white tea, in a cup, you know, with sugar. They let me have it every little once in a while.\"  \"Milk and water, I suppose,\" said aunt Martha. \"Can't you wait till dinner, my dear?\"  \"But the girls _can't_ wait,\" replied Prudy; \"they want it now.\"  \"O, it's for the girls, is it?\"  \"Yes, but when they've washed the apron I can drink the rest--with white sugar in.\"  \"The apron!\" said aunt Martha, \"_what_ apron?\"  \"O, nothing but Susy's. I told grandma I'd be good, and I did be good; it wasn't _me_ spilled the ink.\"  \"Ink spilled?\" cried aunt Martha, and she stopped beating the turnip.  \"O, I ain't goin' to tell!\" cried Prudy, beginning to tremble; \"I didn't, did I? they won't '_low_ me to tell.\"  Aunt Louise, passing through the kitchen, caught some of the last words, and rushed up stairs, two steps at a time.  \"O, Susy Parlin, you naughty, naughty child, what _have_ you been into? Who spilled that ink?\"  \"It got tipped over,\" answered Susy, in a fright, but not forgetting her promise.  \"Of course it got tipped over--but not without hands, you careless girl! Do you get your shaker, and march home as quick as ever you can! I must go with you, I suppose.\"  Lonnie ought to have come forward now, like a little gentleman, and told the whole story; but he had run away.  \"O, auntie,\" said Grace, \"she wasn't to blame. It----\"  \"Don't say a word,\" said aunt Louise, briskly. \"If she was my little girl I'd have her sent to bed. That dress and apron ought to be soaking this very minute.\"  Bridget listened at the foot of the stairs in a very angry mood, muttering,--  \"It's not much like the child's mother she is. A mother can pass it by when the childers does such capers, and wait till they get more sinse.\"  Poor little Susy had to go home in the noonday sun, hanging down her head like a guilty child, and crying all the way. Some of the tears were for her soiled clothes, some for her auntie's sharp words, and some for the nice dinner she had left.  \"O, aunt Madge,\" sobbed she, when they had got home, \"I kept as far behind aunt Louise as I could, so nobody would think I was her little girl. She was ashamed of me, I looked so!\"  \"There, there! try not to cry,\" said aunt Madge, as she took off Susy's soiled clothes.  \"But I can't stop crying, I feel so bad. If there's any body gets into a fuss it's always _me_! I'm all the time making some kind of trouble. Sometimes I wish there wasn't any such girl as me!\"  Tears came into aunt Madge's kind gray eyes, and she made up her mind that the poor child should be comforted. So she quietly put away the silk dress she was so anxious to finish, and after dinner took the fresh, tidy, happy little Susy across the fields to aunt Martha's again, where the unlucky day was finished very happily after all.  \"The truth is, Louise,\" said aunt Madge that night, after their return, \"_Lonnie_ spilled that ink, and Susy was not at all to blame. You scolded her without mercy for being careless, and she bore it all because she would not break her promise to that cowardly boy.\"  \"O, how unjust I have been!\" said aunt Louise, who did not mean to be unkind, in spite of her hasty way of speaking.  \"You _have_ been unjust,\" said aunt Madge. \"Only think what a trifling thing it is for a little child to soil her dress! and what a great thing to have her keep her word! Susy has a tender heart, and it grieves her to be unjustly scolded; but she would bear it all rather than tell a falsehood. For my part I am proud of such a noble, truthful little niece.\"     CHAPTER XII  PRUDY TRYING TO HELP   Prudy awoke one morning full of mischief. At the second table she split her johnny-cake, and spread it open, saying it was a singing-book, and began to sing out of it,--      \"Little drops of water,     Little _grains_ of sand.\"  Grandma heard her from the next room, and came in very much surprised.  \"What shall I do with such a little girl as this?\" said she, shaking her finger at Prudy.  \"I think,\" answered the child, \"you ought to call me to you and say, 'You been a-singin' to the table, Prudy.' Then I'll say 'Yes'm;' and you'll say, 'Prudy, go right out in the kitchen, and don't let me see you till you come back pleasant.'\"  Grandma put her head out of the window a moment, for she didn't want any body to see her smile.  \"This is one of Prudy's days,\" thought she. \"I'm really afraid I shall have to punish her before it's over.\"  Very soon after breakfast the doorbell rang, and a little boy left a note directed to Miss Grace Clifford. It said,--  \"Miss Grace Clifford, the Misses Parlin, and Mr. Horace Clifford, are respectfully invited to a gypsy supper in the Pines.\"  The children hardly knew what it meant.  \"What _is_ jispies?\" asked Prudy, a little frightened. \"Be they up in the Pines?\"  \"It means a picnic, that's all,\" said aunt Madge, \"and a very nice time you will have.\"  \"A picnic!\" screamed all the voices in chorus. It was almost too good to believe. Grace clapped her hands and laughed. Susy ran about the room like a crazy thing. Prudy hopped up and down, and Horace tried to stand on his head.  \"Now scamper, every one of you,\" said aunt Madge, \"for I must go right to cooking.--Let's see, you shall have some cunning little sandwiches, some hard-boiled eggs; and what else can you think of, Louise?\"  \"Stop a minute,\" said aunt Louise, drawing on a long face, \"I hope Susy and Prudy----\"  \"Tarts and plum-cake!\" cried Susy and Grace.  \"Oranges, dates, and figs!\" said Horace.  \"And them little cookies you cut out of a thimble, you know,\" added Prudy, anxious to put in a word.  \"Hear me speak,\" said aunt Louise. \"I hope Susy and Prudy don't think they are going to this picnic, for the truth is, they haven't been invited.\"  \"Not invited?\" gasped Susy.  \"The note says, 'the Misses Parlin,'\" said aunt Louise, gravely. \"That might mean your grandmother, but it doesn't! I take it to mean _the young ladies_, Madge (or Mig) and Louise, your beautiful aunties, who are often called 'the Misses Parlin.' Of course it _can't_ mean two little slips of girls in short dresses!\"  Susy burst into tears, and tried to talk at the same time, but nobody could understand her.  \"O, O!\" moaned Prudy, burying her face in the roller-towel, \"if I can't go I shall just lay down my head and cry!\"  \"It's not true, children, not one word; she's only joking,\" said aunt Madge, laughing and shaking the egg-beater at her sister. \"I'm really ashamed of your aunt Louise for trying to tease you. What _do_ you suppose any body wants of old grown-up folks at your nice little party? There, there, don't laugh _quite_ so loud. Run away, and stay away, if you want me ever to do any thing.\"  In a few moments the children were playing out of doors in high spirits, and Prudy had told the workmen, in her pretty, lisping way, \"that every one of we children were invited to a _jispy_ supper; had a ticket come a-purpose, so of course we should _have_ to go!\"  The children were too much excited to do their morning work properly. Grandma could not tell by the looks of the piazza whether Susy had swept it or not, and had to go and ask.  \"She's swept it off,\" said Prudy, speaking for her, \"but she didn't sweep it _way off_!\"  \"I should judge not,\" said grandma; \"and here is Prudy, with her bib on yet, and Grace hasn't made her bed. Do you think such children ought to go to a party?\"  \"O, grandma,\" cried Prudy, \"you know we had a ticket come a-purpose!\"  \"I'm ashamed,\" said Grace, promptly. \"Susy, you and I are too big to act so. Let's go and do up our work right nice, and then see if we can't help grandma.\"  And off went the two little girls, with beaming faces, trying to make themselves useful.  \"What shall I do?\" thought Prudy, for every body was at work,--even Horace, who was turning the grindstone for the men.  \"I'll dust the parlors, that's what I'll do. It does take aunt Madge so long.\"  So, with the big feather duster, Prudy made a great stir among the books and ornaments, and at last knocked over a little pitcher and broke its nose.  \"You little meddlesome thing,\" cried aunt Louise, as soon as she knew it, \"this is one of your _days_, I should think!\"  \"I didn't mean to,\" cried the child; \"I was trying to help.\"  \"Don't say you didn't mean to; you hadn't any business to touch the duster. I shall have to snip your fingers, I do believe.\"  \"Don't,\" begged the child, \"_I'll_ snip my hands, _you_ needn't; _I'll_ snip my hands and get the naughty out.\"  \"They ought to be snipped from now till next Christmas,\" said aunt Louise, laughing in spite of herself to see the little one set to work with thumb and finger, trying to do her own punishing. \"There, there, go off, and be a good girl.\"  Prudy's bright spirits rose again at these words, and she thought she would keep on trying to make herself useful. It was aunt Madge she wanted to help--good aunt Madge, who was so busy cooking for the gypsy supper.  [Illustration: PRUDY DUSTING.]  \"I'll feed her bird,\" "]]]
