Let's go in and tell father.\"  \"Oh, what a bother it is so far off!\" Nesta exclaimed, with a sigh of impatience. \"We shall have to wait ages to find out who it is.\"  \"Who do you think it can be, father?\" Peter asked, as Eustace explained what he believed to be coming.  \"How should I know?\" Mr. Orban answered with mock seriousness.  \"It might be a magician with milk-white steeds, or a fairy godmother, Peter, in a coach made out of pumpkins,\" said Mrs. Orban.  \"O mother!\" Peter cried impatiently, \"don't be silly--\"  The sentence was never completed; it finished in a howl of mingled pain and rage.  \"What on earth is the matter now?\" asked Mr. Orban.  \"Eustace ki-ki-kicked me,\" stormed Peter, making a dive at his brother with doubled fists; but his father caught him and held him pinioned.  \"I can pretty well guess why,\" said the big man severely. \"If he hadn't, I should have spanked you myself. How dare you say 'don't be silly' to your mother?\"  Peter hung his head.  \"I didn't mean--\" he began.  \"I should just think you didn't mean it,\" said his father. \"You'll kindly remember you've no right by birth to be a cad, and it is caddish for a gentleman to speak like that to a lady--whether he is ten years old or a hundred.\"  \"Besides,\" said Eustace, looking furiously at the small culprit, \"mother couldn't be silly if she tried.\"  Peter's humbled expression changed.  \"It wasn't for you to kick me,\" he spluttered resentfully; \"I'll kick you back.\"  \"Oh, if you like to be a donkey,\" began Eustace in a lordly tone.  \"Who was donkey first?\" demanded Peter.  \"I guess,\" said Nesta, who was accustomed to these scenes, \"the buggy may be in sight at the first bend by now. I'm going to look.\"  Eustace followed.  \"Well, Peter, what comes next?\" asked Mr. Orban, without letting go the child's wrists.  Peter looked over his shoulder towards his mother--the blue eyes were swimming with tears, there was a choke in his voice.  \"I'm sorry, mummie,\" he gasped.  The next moment he was clasped in his mother's arms, there was a manful struggle with gathering tears, and then like an arrow from a bow Peter was off to the veranda with every intention of thumping Eustace soundly. But the news that greeted him there put the recent fray right out of his mind.  \"It is a buggy, Peter,\" said Nesta, \"and I believe Bob Cochrane is driving it.\"  Now the Cochranes were the Orbans' nearest neighbours--the family that lived only five miles away. It consisted of a father and mother and this young fellow Robert, who was six-and-twenty, the idol and greatest admiration of the Orban children's hearts. In their eyes there was nothing Bob could not do; his shooting, his driving and riding, his jokes, his ways--everything about him was wonderful. A visit from Bob was a splendid event, no matter what the hour of the day.  Bob had a sister who was about the twins' age, and Nesta's only friend.  \"It looks just like Bob's driving,\" said Eustace.  Then they waited with eager faces, too excited to speak, till suddenly they all cried at once,--  \"It is Bob--it is--it is--it is!\"  Mr. and Mrs. Orban came out on to the veranda, Becky toddling behind.  \"There is no doubt about it,\" said Mr. Orban as he watched the jolting, bumping carriage toiling up the terribly steep hill that was almost too much for the horses, fine beasts though they were.  \"How strange of him to come in the buggy instead of riding, as he is alone,\" said Mrs. Orban.  \"Yes,\" chimed in Nesta, \"that was just what I was thinking. Bob always--always rides, excepting--\"  She paused to think whether she had ever seen Bob driving before, and Eustace finished her sentence for her.  \"Excepting when he doesn't,\" he said.  \"Goose,\" said Nesta tartly.  \"Or, more correctly speaking, 'gander,'\" said Mr. Orban. \"Well, we needn't squeeze our heads to a pulp trying to guess what we shall learn from Bob without the slightest trouble in another twenty minutes at most.\"  When Bob Cochrane came within earshot he was greeted with such a chorus of yells that not a single word could he hear of what the children were trying to say. He grinned back good-humouredly, waved, and whipping up his horses, came as fast as he could under the veranda. Then he gathered the meaning of the noise.  \"What have you come for, Bob?\" shouted the three.  \"What have I come for?\" he repeated, with his particular laugh which had a way of setting every one else off laughing too as a rule. \"Well, upon my word, that is a nice polite way to greet a chap. I had better be off again.\"  He was big, fair-haired, and gray-eyed, not handsome, but far too manly for that to matter. As Manuel the Manila boy ran round the house to take charge of the horses, Bob got down from the buggy and sprang up the veranda steps in contradiction of his own words. He was surrounded at the top by the children, all talking at once. Without an attempt at answering, he picked up Becky, who adored him with the rest, and passed on to Mr. and Mrs. Orban.  \"I apologize for the disorder,\" Mr. Orban said, \"but they have been working themselves up into a fever of expectation ever since they first heard the buggy wheels. Seriously though, I hope nothing is wrong at home. Your mother isn't ill, is she? You haven't come to fetch the wife as nurse, or anything?\"  Such friendly acts as these were the common courtesies of their simple colonial life. But Bob only laughed now.  \"Oh, nothing wrong at all,\" he replied. \"Mater is right enough; it is only Trix who is the trouble now. She doesn't seem to pick up after that last bout of fever, and she is so awfully depressed and lonely, mother thought if you would let me take a couple of the children--Nesta and another--back with me for a week, it might brighten the kiddy up. Could you spare them, Mrs. Orban?\"  \"With pleasure,\" began Mrs. Orban readily, when Nesta started a sort of war-dance with accompanying cries of delight.  \"When you have quite done!\" said Bob, with a solemn stare that quelled the disturbance after a moment. \"I shan't have an ear to hear with by the time I get home, at this rate. Well, who is the other one to be? You, Eustace?\"  Eustace coloured deeply. There was nothing he would have liked better. To go to the Highlands, as the Cochranes' plantation was called, was the greatest pleasure that could have been offered him--the treat had only come his way about twice in his life. It meant so much--rides with Bob, shooting with Bob, long rambles always with his hero.  \"I should like to awfully,\" he said, and stopped, looking beseechingly at his father.  \"Why, what's the matter, old chap?\" asked Bob in a kindly voice. \"You're as limp as if all the starch had been boiled out of you. Come along if you want to, of course. Peter can come another time, if it's afraid of being selfish that you are.\"  \"But it isn't that,\" Eustace said with difficulty. \"I mean I can't. You see, father is going away, and I couldn't leave mother.\"  Bob darted a quick look at Mr. Orban.  \"Are you really going away?\" he asked--\"any distance, I mean?\"  \"Unfortunately, yes,\" Mr. Orban said gravely. \"I have to be away about a fortnight or three weeks. I go the day after to-morrow.\"  Bob looked serious.  \"Oh, I say,\" he said, \"I'm sorry.\"  To Nesta, standing there in the sunshine, with a great big pleasure ahead of her, the words conveyed nothing beyond a civil sympathy with the annoyance it must be to Mr. Orban to have to go away on business. To Eustace, who must stay behind, there was something underlying those few words that brought back all the fears of the day before.  \"It is a nuisance, but it can't be helped,\" Mr. Orban said; \"business won't wait.\"  \"I am sorry,\" repeated Bob, with that same strange solemnity, \"because I can't offer to come and stay here while you are away. Father is going away too, and of course I couldn't leave the mater and Trix. If only it hadn't happened just now--\"  \"It is very good of you to think of it, Bob,\" said Mrs. Orban, \"but of course we shall be perfectly safe. I think I would rather you took Peter, though,\" she added in a lower tone. \"Eustace is more companionable. I can spare one of the twins, but not both at once.\"  \"Of course,\" agreed Bob.  He was strangely unlike his usual cheerful self, but he roused himself, as every one seemed to be looking at him, and added, \"Could the children be ready to go back with me soon?\"  \"Stay till the heat is over, and drive home in the cool with them,\" suggested Mr. Orban. \"I'll say good-bye for the present; I'm due at the plantation.\"  Eustace was left alone with Bob, for the others went with their mother to watch her preparations for their departure.  \"Well, old man,\" questioned Bob from the depths of a cane chair, where he had flung himself for a quiet smoke, \"what's up?\"  Eustace stood staring at him.  \"I say,\" he said with some difficulty, \"it's beastly about father going, isn't it?\"  \"Rather,\" said Bob carelessly. \"Mrs. Orban will feel awfully dull.\"  \"That isn't the worst of it,\" said the lad mysteriously.  \"Really?\" questioned Bob indifferently, as he packed his pipe with great apparent interest.  \"You know it isn't, Bob,\" Eustace broke out desperately.  \"Do I?\" questioned Bob lazily, but with a shrewd glance at the thin, pale face before him. \"Why, what's the trouble?\"  \"It's the black-fellows,\" Eustace said in a half whisper.  Bob raised his eyebrows a little, and was again attentive to his pipe.  \"Indeed?\" he said; \"what about them?\"  \"They are all round us in the scrub; you never know where they are,\" Eustace said with a gulp.  \"They always are, and one never does,\" said Bob lightly. \"I don't see that it matters. Are you in a funk about them?\"  The cool question brought crimson to Eustace's cheeks.  \"No,\" he said sturdily, \"but they are a fearfully low grade lot, and--and they have done some awful things in lonely places, out of revenge, on white people.\"  Bob looked up sharply.  \"What do you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25079"],["title","Queensland Cousins (#4)"],["body","about it?\" he asked in a voice that sounded almost stern.  \"The servants--Kate and Mary--have told us stories,\" Eustace explained.  \"Oh, they have, have they?\" Bob positively snorted in indignation. \"Then they deserve to be sacked.\"  He was silent a long time, puffing out volumes of smoke, then he said suddenly,--  \"Look here, Eustace, don't get stupid and frightened about the black-fellows. Your father has never done them any harm; they have nothing to revenge here, for he hasn't interfered with any of them.\"  \"But Kate says that doesn't matter,\" Eustace said dismally. \"She says they have a deadly hatred against all white people.\"  \"Kate is an ignorant goose,\" growled Bob; \"much she can know about it! Why, my father has had black-fellows in his employment for years, and they've been all right. Don't you listen to Kate's nonsense.\"  There was silence awhile, then Bob went on,--  \"But I tell you what I'll do, if it will be any comfort to Mrs. Orban. I'll come over nearly every day and hang about the place as if I were living here. How would that do?\"  \"I should like it, of course, and I believe mother would,\" said the boy slowly.  \"Of course you would be all right anyhow,\" Bob said bracingly.  \"Of course,\" repeated Eustace with less certainty, hesitated, then went on haltingly, \"but supposing--of course I believe you, Bob--but just only supposing one night some black-fellows did turn up, what should you do?\"  \"I should shoot them,\" Bob said promptly.  \"But if you were me?\" questioned Eustace.  \"Oh, if I were you,\" repeated Bob thoughtfully. \"Well, of course, you wouldn't shoot them--they wouldn't be scared enough of a chap your size. On the whole, I think if I were you I should scoot down the hill as hard as I could go for Robertson, Farley, and Ashton. They would soon settle matters.\"  \"But that would be leaving mother to face them alone,\" objected Eustace.  Bob stared solemnly for one moment, then broke into a laugh.  \"Cheer up, old boy,\" he exclaimed; \"you look as if you had a whole tribe at your heels this minute. Why, what has happened to you? I thought you had more spirit than to be scared by a pack of silly maids' stories.\"  The laugh was so genuine, the look in Bob's eyes so quizzical, that Eustace felt suddenly abashed, and as if he had been making a stupid fuss about nothing. With all his heart he wished he had not mentioned the subject to Bob--Bob whose opinion he valued above all others, except, perhaps, his own father's.     CHAPTER III.  THE BAREFOOT VISITOR.   When Mr. Orban came home to dinner he brought with him another excitement--the mail letters that Hadji ought to have brought with the parcel the day before.  To Bob Cochrane, whose parents were Australian born and bred, this meant nothing; but he was so intimate with the Orbans that he understood their feelings on the subject. He sat silently puffing at his pipe while Mr. and Mrs. Orban read their letters. Eustace, Nesta, and Peter had seized on some packets which they knew to contain English papers and magazines.  Suddenly Mrs. Orban gave a curious exclamation, and all eyes were turned questioningly upon her.  \"Mother, mother, what is it?\" cried Nesta, noting the colour flooding her mother's usually pale face.  \"Any news, darling?\" asked Mr. Orban.  \"I should just think it is news,\" said Mrs. Orban unsteadily. \"Listen to this, Jack: 'Dorothy has been so very slow in her recovery from the terrible bout of typhoid she had in spring that the doctor advises a long sea voyage at once, and we have decided to send her out to you by the first boat available. We go up to London to-morrow to get her outfit.'\"  \"Aunt Dorothy!\" yelled the children. \"Aunt Dorothy coming here!\"  It was a most surprising piece of news, almost incredibly so. The children had never seen any of their parents' people, as none of them had been over to Queensland. They knew them only by name and the oft-repeated tales of childhood, which were their favourite stories of all Mr. and Mrs. Orban told.  This was their mother's unmarried sister, Dorothy Chase, who lived with her father and mother in Herefordshire, in the \"old home\" the children knew so well by hearsay, and longed so much to see. Some one coming out from England was next best to going home, and the news produced the wildest commotion of questions and suggestions.  \"When will she come, mother? When can she be here?\" came in chorus.  \"Well, I am sure I don't know,\" Mrs. Orban said; \"but it seems to me she will not be very far behind this letter.\"  \"Not more than a fortnight, I should think,\" said Mr. Orban. \"You see they are hurrying her off.\"  \"O mummie, this is exciting!\" Nesta exclaimed. \"Do tell us how old Aunt Dorothy is!\"  \"Just twenty-three. She was a little child when I last saw her, and I can never picture her grown up.\"  \"Twenty-three is a decent age for girls,\" said Eustace.  \"Out of a vast and varied experience speaks Sir Eustace,\" laughed Bob--and Eustace reddened.  \"Twenty-three,\" said Mr. Orban. \"Fancy little Dot twenty-three! There'll be a big change in her.\"  \"There must be a big change in every one, Jack,\" Mrs. Orban sighed. \"What wouldn't I give to see them all!\"  \"The next thing we shall hear,\" remarked Bob solemnly, \"is that you will be clearing out to England--the whole lot of you. I don't think I like the idea of Miss Dorothy coming at all. She will bewitch you, and off you will all go.\"  \"No such luck,\" cried Nesta impulsively.  \"Alas! an impossibility,\" said Mrs. Orban.  Mr. Orban said nothing, but looked very grave.  These few words, however, could only shadow the great excitement a moment. Mrs. Orban returned to her letter, and read interesting little scraps from time to time, such as \"'I am cudgelling my brains in the hurry to think of everything I can send you--it is such a grand opportunity--I wish I had time to get a list of wants from you--but I dare say nothing will come amiss. Frocks for the girls and yourself, of course--'\"  \"Darling gran!\" cried Nesta.  \"Then I needn't get the duster stuff,\" said Mr. Orban.  \"No, none of the clothes,\" said Mrs. Orban. \"I know what grannie is when she gets a chance to send a box.\"  Nesta and Peter went off in high spirits with Bob later in the day, Nesta exacting many promises that should Aunt Dorothy by some miracle appear before she was expected, Mrs. Orban would send for the children back.  Eustace let the party go without a pang; he was actually glad not to be going. So taken up was he with the new idea that he even forgot his fear lest he had made a bad impression on the great Bob.  There was so much to be thought of in the preparations for Miss Chase's arrival that even Mr. Orban's departure two mornings later left no one depressed. Up to the last Mrs. Orban was wondering whether there was anything she could think of that could be brought from Brisbane for their visitor's greater comfort.  \"She will be used to such a different life,\" Mrs. Orban said. \"I do hope she won't mind roughing it.\"  \"Not she,\" said Mr. Orban heartily. \"She will like it all the better if we make no changes for her, but just let her see life as we live it. After all, it is only for a time with her.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, my darling old man,\" said Mrs. Orban gaily that evening, as she and Eustace sat alone at late dinner, \"how does it feel to be 'man of the house'? Do you feel a great burden of responsibility as mummie's guardian and protector?\"  \"I don't know, mummie,\" said Eustace.  He was looking very grave, for now that the lamps were lighted and it was dusk outside everything felt different again.  The veranda ran round the entire house; only on one side was there a flight of steps down to the ground. The drawing-room opened out on to the other side of the house, facing the sea. It was here Mrs. Orban and Eustace went after dinner, for the day had been exhaustingly hot, and now a slight breeze blew landwards.  But for the rustling of leaves and a distant murmur from the plantation, the night was very still. As she meant to go to bed so early, Mrs. Orban did not have lamps brought out on to the veranda; she and Eustace sat close together in the gloom, their only light a faint golden streak from the drawing-room.  Becky had been in bed a long time, and was fast asleep. For a while they could hear the servants clearing away the dinner; then there was silence even in that quarter, and they knew that Mary and Kate had gone to bed.  \"We ought to be going too, I think, my man,\" Mrs. Orban said softly.  Eustace slipped down on to a stool at her feet and rested his head against her knee.  \"O mummie,\" he pleaded, \"not just yet. Couldn't you tell me a story first?\"  \"I could, of course,\" Mrs. Orban admitted slowly, \"but the question is, Ought I to? It is getting late for you.\"  \"But it is awfully early for you,\" Eustace argued. \"I don't believe you will sleep if you go now. You always say you can't if you go to bed too soon. You see, we needn't get up quite so early, as father isn't here to go out to the plantation.\"  \"That is true,\" said Mrs. Orban with a laugh. \"I really think we shall have to make a barrister of you, Eustace, you plead a cause so eloquently. But what kind of story shall I tell you?\"  \"Oh, one of the old home stories, please,\" he said instantly. \"I should like to know all I can about it before Aunt Dorothy comes.\"  \"I wonder if there are any I have not told you,\" Mrs. Orban said thoughtfully.  \"There must be hundreds,\" Eustace said. \"I always think Maze Court must have stories without end.\"  \"We used to think so, I remember,\" said his mother; \"but I suppose that is always the case with a house when one family has possessed and occupied it for so many generations.\"  \"It is a sixteenth-century house, isn't it?\" Eustace asked.  \"Seventeenth century,\" was the answer, \"built in 1688 by Eustace Chase, a loyal subject of the king. His father lost everything for the cause, and the young man was rewarded for following the Royalist"]]]
