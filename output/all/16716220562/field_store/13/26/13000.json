Then we all laughed at the contrast between this and what his elaborate watch-chain had led us to expect.  While we were still laughing, Angelo drove up to the window and said it was time to go, so we began saying \"Good-bye.\"  Some of the men departed before us, but the brigadier, the corporal and one or two others were going our way.  The brigadier fetched his gun in order to enjoy the chase and we all got out of the window.  Angelo accompanied the hunting party, but the corporal came in the carriage with me and Cicciu drove us round the barley-field to the Temple of Apollo to wait for the others.  On the way we heard the brigadier firing off his gun and wondered what sport he was having, and I took a leaf out of his book of politeness and asked the corporal his age and particulars of his family, after which, of course, I had to tell him all about myself and to promise I would take the first opportunity of visiting him in his home to clink glasses and drink wine with him.  We went all over the ruins while waiting for the hunting party which presently joined us.  The brigadier was satisfied with his sport and permitted himself the pleasure of offering me the spoils--two birds the size of sparrows--which Angelo was to cook for supper.  Then we said \"Good-bye,\" promising to exchange picture postcards when I should be back in England.  The corporal, however, was still going our way and we took him in the carriage a little further.  We asked if he could not come with us all the way to Castelvetrano and he seemed inclined to do so, but he had to patrol the coast in the direction of Marsala from eleven o'clock that night till eleven the next morning, and it was so annoying because, as he must go to Castelvetrano in a few days, he might almost just as well come with us now.  We hoped he would see his way to doing so and he hesitated and appeared to be on the point of yielding, but finally made the Herculean choice of duty before pleasure on the very sensible ground that, if it should be discovered he had deserted his post, he would be put into prison for two months.  With the brigadier and all the guards in the secret, it seemed impossible that he should escape detection, so we pressed the invitation no further and took leave of him after exchanging names and addresses and promising to send postcards to one another.  As we drove away I could not but draw a comparison in my mind between the corporal's refusal of my invitation and mine of his, and I was ashamed of myself for the way I had scamped the bathing festa.  I had made another engagement and there was an end of it.  The corporal, on the other hand, had spared no expense in the manner of his refusal, nothing short of two months' imprisonment could have prevented him from coming with us.  We English ought to be able to do this and some of us, I suppose, can, but there is no Italian who cannot.  The French are polite, but not always to be trusted.  A Frenchman, speaking of an Englishman to whom I had introduced him, said to me--  \"He speaks French worse than you do.\"  Any Italian, wishing to express a similar idea, would have said--  \"He speaks Italian, it is true, but not so well as you do.\"  My meditations were interrupted by Angelo who had been taking stock of our possessions and, on looking into the basket, exclaimed with disgust that we had been robbed of our fish.  It was the first I had heard about our fish, but he said the brigadier had given us ten and he had put them into the basket.  How could they have got out again?  All the afternoon we had been surrounded by coastguards and policemen whose profession is, as every one knows, to prevent robbery and to take up thieves.  Angelo was furious and wanted to drive back and complain to the brigadier, but, on looking further through the basket, we found there were still two fish and I said they would be quite enough for supper--with the sparrows--and he finally agreed that we had better do nothing, it might look as though we thought the brigadier was not up to his business.  \"And when the tailor is wearing a coat that does not fit him,\" said Angelo, \"it is rude to tell him of it.\"  So we drove on among the cistus bushes and I asked him about the lottery. Every Saturday morning ninety cards numbered from one to ninety are put into a wheel of fortune and a blind-folded child from the orphan asylum publicly draws out five.  Italy is divided into several districts and a drawing takes place in the chief town of each, the winning numbers are telegraphed to the lottery offices all over the country and afterwards posted up and published in the newspapers.  Any one wishing to try his luck chooses one or more numbers and buys a ticket and this choosing of the numbers is a very absorbing business.  In the neighbourhood of Castelvetrano at that time the favourite numbers were five and twenty-six and the people were betting on those numbers when they had no special reason for choosing any others.  Angelo could not tell why these two numbers were preferred, he could only say that the people found them sympathetic and, as a matter of fact, twenty-six had come out the day before.  There are many ways of choosing a number if you find five and twenty-six unsympathetic; you can wait till something remarkable happens to you, look it out in \"the useful book that knows\" and then bet on its number, for everything really remarkable has a number in the book and, if you do not possess a copy, it can be consulted in a shop as the _Post Office Directory_ can be consulted in London.  Or, if nothing remarkable happens to you in real life, perhaps you may have dreamt of a lady in a white dress, or of a man whetting a scythe, or of meeting a snake in the road--anything will do, so long as it strikes you at the time.  When you see the country people coming into town on market day you may be sure that each one has received instructions from relations and friends at home to put something on a number for them.  Some make a practice of gambling every week, others only try their luck when they have a few spare soldi, others only when they have witnessed something irresistibly striking.  A favourite way of choosing a number is to get into conversation with certain old monks who have a reputation for spotting winners, if I may so speak.  You do not ask the monk for a number outright, you engage him in conversation on general topics and as he understands what is expected of him, though he pretends he does not, he will presently make some such irrelevant remark as, \"Do you like flowers?\" whereupon you rapidly bring the interview to a conclusion and, if you do not know the number for \"flower,\" you look it out in the book and bet on it.  It occurred to me that possibly that was what the brigadier had been doing with me when he took me into his room to wash.  \"Of course it was,\" said Angelo; \"he did not really want you to wash your hands, he wanted to get a number out of you.\"  \"Did he get one?\" said I.  \"He told me to put his money on 14.\"  \"That must have been because I said I paid 14 francs a metre for this cloth.  But he changed that afterwards.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Angelo.  \"He thought the number that came out of your packet of cigarettes would be better.\"  Angelo was not strictly right about the brigadier not wanting me to wash, he said so merely to agree with me, for in Sicily, among those who have not become sophisticated by familiarity with money and its little ways nor cosmopolitanized by travel, and whose civilization remains unmodified by northern and western customs, it is usual for the host to give his guest an opportunity to wash after eating.  Sometimes the lady of the house has herself taken me into her bedroom, poured out the water and held the basin while I have washed; she has then handed me the towel and presently escorted me back to the sitting-room.  We soon overtook a man who had caught a rabbit and wanted to sell it for a lira and a half.  Angelo bargained with him for ever so long and, being at last satisfied that the rabbit was freshly killed, bought it for a lira and put it into the basket, saying he would cook it for supper, and that no doubt the Madonna had sent it to make up for the loss of the fish.  I asked him what I must do to get a ticket in the lottery for the following Saturday.  He replied that his cousin would be happy to sell me one and, if I would settle how much to risk and what number to put it on, he would take me to the office in the morning.  I said I would risk a lira, which he thought overdoing it, as he and his friends seldom risked more than four or five soldi, but there was still the troublesome matter of the number.  He asked whether anything unusual had happened to me lately, either in real life or in a dream.  I told him that I seldom remembered a dream, but that I had had an unusually delightful day in real life at Selinunte.  In his capacity of padrone he acknowledged the compliment, but feared there would be no number for that in the book. Then I asked if there was likely to be a number for having breakfast with a coastguard as it was the first time I had done so.  He mused and said no doubt there would be a number for breakfast and another for coastguard, but not for the combination.  Could not we add the two numbers together and bet on whatever they amounted to, if it were not over 90?  Angelo would not hear of anything of the kind; we must think of something less complicated.  It would never have occurred to him to read for Metaphysics under M and for China under C, and combine the information into the article that appeared in the _Eatanswill Gazette_ as a review of a work on Chinese Metaphysics.  He asked if I had not lately had \"una disgrazia qualunque.\"  I reminded him of the theft of our fish, but that did not satisfy him, he considered it too trivial, though he had made enough fuss"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],["title","Diversions in Sicily (#3)"],["body","it at the time, and 17, which in Sicily is one of the numbers for an ordinary misfortune, was too general.  It seemed a pity I had not been involved in the fall of a balcony because that was a very good thing to bet on and he knew it had a number, although he did not remember it at the moment.  Filippo, the hunchback, was no use because, though it is fortunate to meet hunchbacks, and of course they have a number, there was nothing remarkable in seeing Filippo at the caserma--he is always there.  By this time we had reached Castelvetrano, and supper overshadowed the lottery.  Angelo cooked everything; we began with maccaroni, after which we ate the fish and the sparrows, and wound up with the rabbit.  It was all very good, but it seemed hardly right to eat the sparrows, besides, there was scarcely as much on one of them as there had been on one of the artichokes at the caserma.  During supper, something--it may have been the sparrows or, perhaps, the Madonna again--inspired me with an idea for a number that met with Angelo's enthusiastic approval.  I remembered that my birthday was near and proposed to put my money upon the number of that day of the month. Nothing could have been better and he recommended me to take also my age, that would give me two numbers and I could have an ambo, I should not win on a single number unless it came out first, whereas, if I did not specify their positions, my two numbers might come out anywhere and if they did I should win about 250 francs.  Angelo accepted as a good omen the fact that neither of my numbers exceeded 90, and next morning we called on his cousin and put a franc on 27 and 52.  Now, a lottery is an immoral thing, accordingly I expected to feel as though I had committed an immoral action, instead of which I felt just as I usually do.  I, therefore, gave my ticket to Angelo in order that, if I should develop a conscience by the time the numbers came out, I might silence it by the consciousness of having disclaimed all hope of gain. This was perhaps a little cowardly, for the effects of a lottery are said to be most pernicious to those who win.  But no harm was done in the end, the actual numbers drawn the following Saturday being 39, 42, 89, 83, 28, so Angelo lost and likewise the brigadier and the corporal and the guards who had put their money on 33.     CASTELLINARIA   CHAPTER II--PEPPINO   The train passed through the tunnel under the headland on which stands the Albergo Belvedere, and steamed into the station of Castellinaria, a town that is not so marked on any map of Sicily.  I had written to Carmelo to meet the train and drive me up, but he was not among the coachmen.  I recognized his brother, and said to him--  \"Hullo! Rosario, where have you been all these years?\"  \"Well, you see,\" he replied, \"I have been away.  First there was the military service and then I had a disgrazia; but I have come back now.\"  I avoided inquiring into the disgrazia till I could ascertain from some one else whether he meant what we should call a misfortune or something more serious and merely said I was glad it was all over and asked after his brother.  \"Carmelo is quite well--he is in private service.  He told me to meet you and sent you his salutes and apologies for not coming himself; he will call on you this evening.\"  \"At the Albergo Belvedere?\"  \"No, excuse me, the Belvedere is closed; he told me to take you to the Albergo della Madonna, unless you wish to go anywhere else.\"  So Rosario drove me with my luggage up the zigzags for an hour and a half through dust and sunshine, past orchards of lemons and oranges, among prickly pears and agave overgrown with pink and red geranium, by rocky slopes of mesembryanthemum, yellow marguerites, broom and sweet peas, between white walls with roses straggling over them and occasional glimpses of the sea dotted with fishing boats and, now and then, of the land covered with olives, almonds, and vines.  We stopped in the corso at the Albergo della Madonna (con giardino) and were received by a young man who introduced himself as Peppino, the son of the landlord.  He also said he remembered me, that he had been a waiter in a restaurant in Holborn where I used to dine; I did not recognize him, though, of course, I did not say so.  There was something in his manner as though he had recently been assured by my banker that the balance to my credit during the last ten years or so had never fallen below a much larger sum than my passbook had been in the habit of recording.  He would not hear of my doing anything about my luggage or dinner, he knew my ways and would show me to my room at once.  It was a very fine room with two beds, and he promised that no one should be put into the second bed, not even during the festa which in a few days would fill the town with pilgrims.  He then departed to bring up my luggage and I went out on to the balcony.  Before me lay one of those stupendous panoramas which are among the glories of Sicily.  First a garden of flowers with orange and lemon trees whose blossoms scented the air, then a thicket of almonds full of glittering goldfinches, then a drop of several hundred feet; beyond, to the right, a great mountain with snow on its rocky summit, its lower slopes and the intervening country highly cultivated; to the left the sea, an illimitable opal gleaming in the sunset.  Between the mountain and the sea the coastline went in and out, in and out, in a succession of bays and promontories that receded and receded until sea and land and sky were blended into one distant haze.  Across the first bay was the port and, as the dusk deepened, constellations of lights gathered and glowed among the shipping.  I took possession, thinking that if, like Peppino's parents, I might spend my declining days here, the troubles of life, and especially those attendant upon old age, might be easier to bear.  And yet, possibly, a stupendous panorama might turn out as deceitful as proficiency at whist, or great riches, or worldly honours, or any of the other adjuncts of age popularly supposed to be desirable; for I suspect that most of these things fail and become as naught in the balance when weighed against a good digestion, a modest competency and a quiet conscience.  These are the abiding securities that smooth our passage through life and bring a man peace at the last, and each of us has his own way of going about to win them.  Peppino brought my luggage and, with no nonsense about what I would have for dinner or when or where I should like it, told me that it would be ready at 7.30 in the garden.  Accordingly I went down punctually and found a table spread under a trellis of vines from which hung an electric light.  Peppino waited on me as, according to his account, he used to do in London, and entertained me with reminiscences of his life there.  He had attended divine service at St. Paul's, which he called il Duomo di Londra, and had found it a more reverent function, though less emotional, than Mass at home.  He was enthusiastic about the river Thames, the orators in Hyde Park and the shiny soldiers riding in the streets.  He remembered the lions in the Zoological Gardens and the \"Cock\" at Highbury, where he once drank a whisky-soda and disliked it intensely. He had stood on the base of La Torre del Duca di Bronte (by which he meant the Nelson Column) to see the Lord Mayor's Show, and considered it far finer than any Sicilian procession--more poetical in conception, he said, and carried out with greater magnificence.  He had been to Brighton from Saturday to Monday and burst into tears when he saw the sea again. It is difficult to travel on the Underground Railway without losing oneself, but Peppino can do it.  He got lost once, but that was in some street near Covent Garden, soon after his arrival, and before he had ventured alone in the Underground; he asked his way of a policeman who spoke Italian and told him the way: he believes that all London policemen speak Italian, but he himself prefers English if he can get a chance to speak it.  Sicilians always want to speak English, especially those of the lower orders who invariably consider it as a master-key that will open every door leading to wealth.  Sometimes what they say is, of course, nothing more than otiose compliment; sometimes they are merely introducing the subject of their want of money in an artistic manner in the hope of anything from a soldo to a promise to take them into service as valet, courier, coachman, or whatever it may be--a sort of shaking of Fortune's bag to see what will come out.  Sometimes they really do want to learn English and some of them even make attempts to pick up a few words and actually retain them.  I went once from Siracusa to Malta at the end of December; it was abominably rough, and my luggage was thrown about in the cabin with such violence that some of the things slipped out of my bag.  I was too sea-sick to be sure I had picked them all up, but afterwards discovered that the only thing left behind was my new diary for the next year.  On returning from Valletta to Siracusa about a fortnight later, I asked the steward if he had found my diary and it was produced by the cabin-boy who must have been a youth of considerable energy and enterprise.  He had apparently learnt by ear several English words and, finding a book full of blank paper, had written them down, spelling them the best way he could, that is phonetically, according to Italian pronunciation, and writing the Italian equivalents, spelt in his own way, in a parallel column.  His writing is so distinct that I am certain I have got every letter right, but I do not recognize his second English word for latrina, it is probably some corrupt form of lavatory.  The vocabulary, though restricted, seems a fairly useful one for a cabin-boy to begin with:                      ENGL.                         ITALY.
