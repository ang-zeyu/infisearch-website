Anyhow, just as Mr. Crow lunged at him, with a wild flapping of his broad wings, Master Meadow Mouse slipped to one side and whisked through his doorway.  Old Mr. Crow coughed hoarsely.  \"What's your hurry?\" he cried. \"I've been waiting around here for you for a long while. Can't you spend a few moments of your valuable time with me!\"  Now, it was true that the old gentleman had been lingering in the neighborhood. The corn wasn't quite ripe enough to suit him. So he had decided to go a-mousing that morning.  His way of hunting, however, was not like that of other birds. Mr. Crow chose to do his hunting afoot. He was too wise to waste any effort looking for mice when the grass was high. But after haying he had often gone a-mousing in years past. And he had found the sport to be quite worth while. Stalking about the close cropped meadow he had surprised many distant cousins of Master Meadow Mouse who never returned home to tell the story of their meetings with the black scamp. Maybe Mr. Crow was getting slow in his old age. He had never come so near to catching a Meadow Mouse before, only to be disappointed. It was no wonder that he felt peevish.  At first Master Meadow Mouse did not answer Mr. Crow when the old gentleman called down the tunnel that led to the nest beneath the sod. But soon Master Meadow Mouse remembered that Mr. Crow could get no more than his bill inside the hole. And then Master Meadow Mouse found his voice again.  \"I don't want to go above ground,\" he said. \"Can't you talk to me, where I am?\"  \"It's not easy to do that,\" Mr. Crow grumbled. \"I have to speak too loud; and my voice is hoarse to-day.\"  \"Stick your bill into my tunnel as far as it will go,\" Master Meadow Mouse suggested. \"Then you won't have to shout. I could hear a whisper if you'd do as I say.\"  Old Mr. Crow thrust his bill down the hole.  \"I don't like this,\" he croaked. \"I can't see you.\"  \"That's because you're shutting out all the light,\" Master Meadow Mouse explained.  \"I doubt it,\" said Mr. Crow angrily. \"I believe you've drawn a curtain across the other end of this tunnel. And I can't talk to anybody through a curtain. I _refuse_ to injure my voice trying to talk with anybody that won't give me a more friendly welcome when I call on him.\"  \"Talk away!\" Master Meadow Mouse urged his caller. \"There's nothing between us to keep me from hearing you. Nothing but a foot of air!\"  \"Ah!\" Mr. Crow cried. \"I _knew_ you had something in that tunnel. Remove the air at once, sir, or I'll go away and leave you.\"  \"If his bill wasn't so hard--if it was as soft as the Kitten's nose--I'd bite it,\" Master Meadow Mouse thought.  And while he was thinking, all at once a shaft of light trickled inside his house. Old Mr. Crow had gone grumbling on his way.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  8  Moses Mouse   MASTER MEADOW MOUSE felt ill at ease. Now that the grass had been cut from the meadow he began to think he didn't care to live there any longer. After his adventure with old Mr. Crow, Master Meadow Mouse scarcely dared stray from his dooryard in the daytime. Anybody, almost, could see him as he crept through the stubble.  At night he ventured further from home. And once he went even as far as the farmyard.  To his surprise he found that the grass in Farmer Green's yard was longer than he had ever seen it. Earlier in the summer, when Master Meadow Mouse visited that spot, he had been afraid to cross the lawn because it was clipped so short. But now he could creep through the thick green carpet and nobody could see him, unless a waving grass blade happened to catch somebody's eye. Everybody at the farmhouse had been too busy with haying to spend any time running a lawn mower.  Why not move to the farmyard? The thought came into Master Meadow Mouse's head. It seemed to him that the farmyard would be a fine place to live. There was grain scattered here and there, where somebody had fed the hens. There was the duck pond near-by, when he wanted a swim.  \"I'll come!\" Master Meadow Mouse decided. \"I'll come--if I can find a good place for a nest.\"  Thereupon he began to look about for a site for his new home. And it wasn't long before he had found one that suited him. When he saw the woodpile he squeaked with delight.  \"The very place!\" he cried. \"I'll begin to built my nest to-night.\"  So he set to work. He carried dead leaves and dried grass to the woodpile and started to make a snug home for himself in a space between the logs, well inside the heap of wood. And he had just crept from a chink and stood under the stars when a tiny voice greeted him with a cry, \"What ho, stranger!\"  Master Meadow Mouse looked around. And there on a stick of wood just behind him was a plump gray person. The newcomer looked the least bit like Master Meadow Mouse himself, except that his tail was ever so much longer.  \"I'm Moses Mouse and I live in the farmhouse,\" said the gray gentleman.  \"I'm Master Meadow Mouse and I'm going to live in this woodpile,\" said the reddish-brown chap in reply.  \"That's good news,\" Moses Mouse remarked. \"But you must look out for Miss Snooper,\" he added.  \"Who is she?\" Master Meadow Mouse asked his new friend.  \"Miss Snooper--\" Moses Mouse explained--\"Miss Snooper is our name for Miss Kitty Cat. She lives in the farmhouse. And when she isn't indoors she's usually prowling about the yard.\"  To the great astonishment of Moses Mouse, the short-tailed stranger seemed in no wise startled by his news.  \"Huh!\" Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed. \"If this Miss Snooper--as you call her--bothers me, I'll serve her as I did one of her kittens.\"  \"What did you do to the kitten?\" Moses Mouse inquired with great interest.  \"I bit her nose,\" said Master Meadow Mouse.  Moses Mouse gazed at him with horror.  \"Don't try that on the old lady!\" he cried. \"If you do, you'll be sorry.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  9  Miss Snooper   MOSES MOUSE, who lived in the farmhouse, had warned Master Meadow Mouse. He had warned him to look out for Miss Snooper's nose.  Master Meadow Mouse did not pay any great attention to his new friend's advice. He was building himself a new home in Farmer Green's woodpile. And he went about his work as if there wasn't a cat within a hundred miles.  Then, one day, he caught a glimpse of Miss Snooper. He peeped out from a chink in the woodpile and saw her sitting on a stick of wood. She was so near him that Master Meadow Mouse could have leaped upon her back in one spring.  But he didn't do that. He gazed at her with round eyes, for Miss Snooper looked very fierce, especially when she opened her mouth and showed her sharp teeth as she yawned. Master Meadow Mouse saw that she was a quite different creature from the awkward kitten whom he had bitten on the nose earlier in the summer.  \"Goodness!\" thought Master Meadow Mouse, staring at Miss Snooper with great awe. \"Goodness! Her whiskers are longer than mine!\"  And then he drew back very softly and crept to his nest in the woodpile.  That night Moses Mouse came to make another call. And he brought his wife with him, so that she might see the stranger with the short tail who was going to live in Farmer Green's woodpile.  \"I saw Miss Snooper to-day,\" Master Meadow Mouse told them.  \"Did you bite her nose?\" Mrs. Mouse asked him eagerly; for her husband had told her all about the newcomer.  \"No!\" said Master Meadow Mouse. \"No! I was too busy, building my new home, to stop and bite her.\"  \"Isn't he brave!\" whispered Mrs. Moses Mouse to her husband.  From where they sat, on the top of the woodpile, Master Meadow Mouse and his callers caught sight of a dark shape that moved stealthily towards them through the shadows.  \"It's Miss Snooper herself!\" Mrs. Mouse cried. And quick as a wink she dived down among the sticks of wood, with her husband following close behind her.  \"Probably Master Meadow Mouse will bite Miss Snooper's nose this time,\" she said to Moses, when she had reached a safe retreat.  \"He isn't biting it now,\" Moses Mouse replied, \"because he's crowding right behind me.\"  \"Miss Snooper has come,\" Mrs. Mouse said to Master Meadow Mouse. \"Maybe you didn't understand that it was she.\"  \"Let her come!\" Master Meadow Mouse squeaked.  \"Isn't he brave!\" Mrs. Moses Mouse murmured.  \"I'll bite her nose if she sticks it into this crevice,\" Master Mouse declared.  \"Isn't he brave!\" she breathed into her husband's ear.  \"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Moses Mouse in an undertone. \"He _talks_ a good deal about nose-biting. I should like to see him _do_ it. I knew Miss Snooper was skulking around the yard to-night. That's why I came to call on this chap. I wanted to see whether he'd fight or run.\"  Meanwhile Miss Snooper climbed all over the woodpile. She could hear faint squeaks somewhere. And she was almost frantic because she couldn't squirm under the wood and find whoever was talking.  It was almost morning before Moses Mouse and his wife dared to steal back to the farmhouse. When they left the woodpile Master Meadow Mouse left it too. He had decided, during the night, that he wouldn't live in the farmyard.  \"I've become very tired of this old Cat,\" he told his companions--Mr. and Mrs. Moses Mouse. \"I shouldn't care to stay where I had to see her often.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  10  A Handy Sign   HUNTING played a great part in the life of Master Meadow Mouse. Somebody or other was always hunting him. And he was always hunting for something to eat. He spent a good deal of his time away from home, looking for seeds and grain. On the other hand, he spent a good deal of his time in his house; for Master Meadow Mouse liked to take naps--especially in the daytime.  After he started to live in Farmer Green's woodpile, but moved away from it before he had finished building his nest there, Master Meadow Mouse settled near the fence between the meadow and the pasture. The mowing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24872"],["title","The Tale of Master Meadow Mouse (#3)"],["body","hadn't cut the weeds and grass that grew close to the fence. He found shelter there from the sharp eyes of birds that would have caught him had they been able to.  This time Master Meadow Mouse didn't live underground. He made a sort of little hut for himself, which kept out the cold in chilly weather, and shed the rain when it didn't pour down too hard.  It was a good home. But it had one drawback. If anybody came along when its owner was asleep in it--Well, Master Meadow Mouse didn't like to think about that. The little nest at the end of the tunnel where he had once lived had been far safer.  \"I know what I'll do!\" he cried at last, as a happy thought came to him. \"I'll hang a sign outside my door.\"  He set to work. And soon he had printed a sign. On one side of this was the notice, \"Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow.\" And on the other side were the words, \"At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In.\"  \"There!\" said Master Meadow Mouse as he stood off a few paces and looked at his handiwork. \"That ought to do the trick.\"  Then he hung the sign outside his door and went into his house to enjoy a nap. And the side of the sign that was turned outward said, \"Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow.\"  Master Meadow Mouse slept late into the afternoon. And towards sunset, while he was still asleep, Tommy Fox slipped through the pasture fence.  \"Hullo!\" he murmured softly as his eyes fell on Master Meadow Mouse's dwelling. \"Here's a bit of luck. I smell a Mouse. And he must be taking a nap inside his house.\"  Tommy Fox crept closer to the little hut. Then all at once he straightened up with a look of displeasure on his sharp face. He had just noticed the sign.  \"He's away from home!\" Tommy exclaimed. \"That's a pity. He can't have been gone long. Maybe I can catch him near-by.\"  But he couldn't find Master Meadow Mouse anywhere. He looked all around--except inside the shelter where Master Meadow Mouse was fast asleep.  Tommy Fox came back and read the sign once more.  \"Back To-morrow,\" he muttered. \"Very well! I'll come back here to-morrow. For that's what the sign tells me to do.\"  And the next day he returned. He grinned from ear to ear as he read what the sign said: \"At Home. Don't Knock. Walk In.\" Then he thrust his long, sharp nose right through Master Meadow Mouse's doorway.  There was nobody there. And Tommy Fox looked silly as anything.  \"Fooled!\" he growled. \"Fooled by a Meadow Mouse! I hope nobody ever finds it out.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  11  A Castle in the Air   IT seemed as if Master Meadow Mouse was always moving. Perhaps the pleasantest move he ever made was when he went to the cornfield to live. When autumn came Farmer Green shocked the corn. All over the field bundles of cornstalks stood in rows, like soldiers. And what suited Master Meadow Mouse especially was the ripe ears in the shocks, which Farmer Green had not yet gathered.  For some weeks past Master Meadow Mouse had been living in a rude shelter, which he had built for himself near the fence between the pasture and the meadow. Though he had been quite comfortable there during the hot weather, there were days, now, when a chilly wind swept through Pleasant Valley and made him shiver slightly as he thought of the frosts which his neighbors told him were on the way.  He had made up his mind to seek some snugger home. But not until he saw what Farmer Green was doing with the cornstalks did Master Meadow Mouse decide on his new dwelling.  \"What a fine idea of Farmer Green's!\" he cried, when he first looked upon the shocked corn. \"I never dreamed that he had been raising corn to make homes for our family.\" He changed his opinion of Farmer Green. Master Meadow Mouse had been much upset when Farmer Green cut the grass in the meadow at haying time. All the birds in the air could see him whenever he crossed the bare field. Now, however, he forgot his displeasure in the joy that Farmer Green's latest move gave him.  That night Master Meadow Mouse crept into the cornfield. The round, yellow harvest moon shone down on the field, bathing the shocks of corn in a flood of light and making the pumpkins that lay on every side look almost as golden as they appeared under the midday sun.  Master Meadow Mouse was surprised to find that many of his cousins had had the same happy thought about moving that had come to him. He met dozens of the big Meadow Mouse family that night. And every one of them was intent on picking out a shock of corn to live in.  Luckily there were shocks enough for all--and more. And no disputes arose. Some wanted to settle near the fence. Some preferred to live in the middle of the field. Many decided to make their new homes near Broad Brook, so they could enjoy a swim now and then without having to travel far to get to the water.  Master Meadow Mouse was one of the best swimmers. He found a huge shock that stood near the bank of the brook. Crawling through it, he discovered at least two dozen ears of ripe corn there.  \"I won't look any further,\" he exclaimed. \"Here's food enough to last for months, all stored for me and ready to be eaten whenever I'm hungry.\"  Then he set to work. And high in the top of the shock he made himself a nest of dry husks, which he stripped off some of the ears.  It was an easy matter to build that home. Everything that he needed was right at hand. And it was no time at all before Master Meadow Mouse had his house in order. Then he was ready for a nap. But first he made a hearty meal of corn because--as he said--he always slept better on a full stomach.  As he settled himself at last in his new quarters, just before he dozed off Master Meadow Mouse murmured happily to himself.  \"I never thought,\" he said, \"that I'd sleep in a castle in the air.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  12  A Midnight Frolic   MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had always been pudgy. Before he went to the cornfield to live he had been fat enough. And after he had spent two weeks in and out of his new nest in the cornshock he was a sight to see. His sides bulged. And he had a look as if his skin weren't big enough for him.  Life had become very easy for Master Meadow Mouse. He didn't even have to leave home to get all the corn he could eat. He simply crept out of his nest, and right there in his cornshock he had two dozen ears of ripe corn. He didn't need to set foot to the ground, unless he wanted a drink.  Of course Master Meadow Mouse wasn't content to stay at home morning, noon and night. He scampered away whenever he pleased. Sometimes he went for a swim in Broad Brook. Sometimes he visited his cousins, who dwelt in other shocks in the cornfield. And every night he joined the big Meadow Mouse family in a frolic. They chased one another around the pumpkins that strewed the ground, dodged behind the shocked corn, or ran along the rail fence.  During the daytime Master Meadow Mouse and his companions lay low. When they went abroad they kept a close watch for Mr. Crow. Late as it was, the old gentleman still lingered in Pleasant Valley. Although his cronies had started on their yearly journey to the South, he let it be known that he was expecting to spend the winter in the North.  \"I've noticed signs,\" he had said, \"that tell me we're going to have a mild winter.\"  Whenever Mr. Crow visited the cornfield, the Meadow Mouse family hastened to hide. They didn't try to go to their own homes, but plunged inside the nearest shocks of corn.  Mr. Crow was far from stupid. He knew what was going on right under his nose--or his bill. Flapping towards the cornfield from the woods he could see a great scurrying of small, reddish-brown persons. But when he settled down in the field there was never a Meadow Mouse anywhere in sight.  \"They're stealing corn!\" the old gentleman spluttered. \"I'd stop them if I could. But what can I do when they hide the moment they see me coming?\"  The old fellow pondered over the question.  \"Somebody,\" he said, \"will have to tear these shocks apart in order to catch the Meadow Mouse people. And I don't know anyone that could do it better than Fatty Coon.\"  Now, Mr. Crow knew where Fatty Coon lived, in a hollow tree in Cedar Swamp. And he actually started to fly over to the Swamp and ask Fatty Coon to rid the cornfield of the Meadow Mouse family.  But on the way to Cedar Swamp Mr. Crow happened to think of something. He happened to think that Fatty Coon had an enormous appetite and was very fond of corn.  Mr. Crow suddenly veered off his straight course and alighted in a tree.  \"That will never do,\" he croaked. \"Fatty would eat more than all the Meadow Mice in Pleasant Valley.\"  Little did Mr. Crow know that Fatty Coon was already planning to visit the cornfield as soon as it grew dark.  Nor did Master Meadow Mouse and his cousins guess that they were to have an unwelcome guest that night.  As usual, after dark they poured out of their castles in the air to enjoy their nightly frolic. And they were having what they called \"high jinks\" when the word went around to hide.  For somebody squeaked in a frightened voice: \"Fatty Coon is crawling through the pasture fence!\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  13  A Moonlight Raid   THE Meadow Mouse party, in the cornfield, vanished as if by magic. Not one of the merrymakers lingered an instant after hearing that Fatty Coon was entering the field. And since Master Meadow Mouse happened to be near the shock where he lived, he ran up it in a twinkling and crept inside it, to curl up in his nest and try to catch forty winks.  He felt safe enough. Hadn't old Mr. Crow come to the cornfield every day? _He_ had never even poked into a shock to disturb Master Meadow Mouse or one of his cousins. Mr. Crow had eaten corn, to be sure. But he hadn't bothered anybody. And now Master Meadow Mouse thought that as soon as Fatty Coon had stuffed himself with corn he would stroll back to Cedar Swamp.  Master Meadow Mouse had fallen into a doze when a sharp rustle waked him.  \"Ho, ho!\" he chuckled. \"There's Fatty"]]]
