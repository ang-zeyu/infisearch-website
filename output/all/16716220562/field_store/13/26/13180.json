An old maid!\" Miss Wealthy sighed a little, and put her hand up to the pansy breastpin,--a favorite gesture of hers; and then she went into the house, to make a new set of bags for the curtain-tassels.  Meanwhile the girls were driving along, looking about them, and enjoying themselves immensely. Jeremiah had given them directions for a drive \"just about _so_ long,\" and they knew that they were to turn three times to the left and never to the right. And first they went up a hill, from the top of which they saw \"all the kingdoms of the earth,\" as Rose said. The river valley was behind them, and they could see the silver stream here and there, gleaming between its wooded banks. Beyond were blue hills, fading into the blue of the sky. But before them--oh! before them was the wonder. A vast circle, hill and dale and meadow, all shut in by black, solemn woods; and beyond the woods, far, far away, a range of mountains, whose tops gleamed white in the sunlight.  \"There is snow on them,\" said Rose. \"Oh, Hildegarde! they must be the White Mountains. Jeremiah told me that we could see them from here. That highest peak must be Mount Washington. Oh, to think of it!\"  They sat in silence for a few moments, watching the mountains, which lay like giants at rest.  \"Rose,\" said Hildegarde, at length, \"the Great Carbuncle is there, hidden in some crevice of those mountains; and the Great Stone Face is there, and oh! so many wonderful things. Some day we will go there, you and I; sometime when you are quite, quite strong, you know. And we will see the Flume and the wonderful Notch. You remember Hawthorne's story of the 'Ambitious Guest'? I think it is one of the most beautiful of all. Perhaps--who knows?--we may find the Great Carbuncle.\" They were silent again; but presently Dr. Abernethy, who cared nothing whatever about mountains or carbuncles, whinnied, and gave a little impatient shake.  \"Of course!\" said Hildegarde. \"Poor dear! he was hot, wasn't he? and the flies bothered him. Here is our turn to the left; a pine-tree at the corner,--yes, this must be it! Good-by, mountains! Be sure to stay there till the next time we come.\"  \"What was that little poem about the Greek mountains that you told me the other day?\" asked Rose, as they drove along,--\"the one you have copied in your commonplace book. You said it was a translation from some modern Greek poet, didn't you?\"  \"Yes,\" said Hildegarde; \"but I don't know what poet. I found it in a book of Dr. Felton's at home.\"  She thought a moment, and then repeated the verses,--          \"'Why are the mountains shadowed o'er?          Why stand they darkened grimly?          Is it a tempest warring there,          Or rain-storm beating on them?          \"'It is no tempest warring there,          No rain-storm beating on them,          But Charon sweeping over them,          And with him the departed.'\"  \"Look!\" she cried, a few moments after. \"There is just such a cloud-shadow sweeping over that long hill on the left. Is it true, I wonder? I never see those flying shadows without thinking of 'Charon sweeping over them.' It is such a comfort, Rose, that we like the same things, isn't it?\"  \"Indeed it is!\" said Rose, heartily. \"But, oh! Hilda dear, stop a moment! There is some yellow clover. Why, I had no idea it grew so far north as this!\"  \"Yellow clover!\" repeated Hildegarde, looking about her. \"Who ever heard of yellow clover? I don't see any.\"  \"No, dear,\" said Rose; \"it does not grow in the sides of buggies, nor even on stone-walls. If you could bend your lofty gaze to the ditch by the roadside, you might possibly see it.\"  \"Oh, there!\" said Hildegarde, laughing. \"Take the reins, Miss Impudence, and I will get them.\" She sprang lightly out, and returned with a handful of yellow blossoms.  \"Are they really clover?\" she asked, examining them curiously. \"I had no idea there were more than two kinds, red and white.\"  \"There are eight kinds, child of the city,\" said Rose, \"beside melilot, which is a kind of clover-cousin. This yellow is the hop-clover. Dear me! how it does remind me of my Aunt Caroline.\"  \"And how, let me in a spirit of love inquire, does it resemble your Aunt Caroline? Is she yellow?\"  \"She was, poor dear!\" replied Rose. \"She has been dead now--oh! a long time. She was an aunt of Mother's; and once she had the jaundice, and it seems to me she was always yellow after that. But that was not all, Hilda. There was an old handbook of botany among Father's books, and I used to read it a great deal, and puzzle over the long words. I always liked long words, even when I was a little wee girl. Well, one day I was reading, and Aunt Caroline happened to come in. She despised reading, and thought it was an utter waste of time, and that I ought to sew or knit all the time, since I could not help Mother with the housework. She was very practical herself, and a famous housekeeper. So she looked at me, and frowned, and said, 'Well, Pink, mooning away over a book as usual? Useless rubbish! yer ma'd ought to keep ye at work.' I didn't say anything; I never said much to Aunt Caroline, because I knew she didn't like me, and I suppose I was rather spoiled by every one else being _too_ good to me. But I looked down at my old book, which was open at 'Trefolium: Clover.' And there I read--oh, Hilda, it is really too bad to tell!--I read: 'The teeth bristle-form'--and hers did stick out nearly straight!--'corolla mostly withering or persistent; the claws'--and then I began to laugh, for it was _exactly_ like Aunt Caroline herself; she was _so_ withering, and _so_ persistent! And I sat there and giggled, a great girl of thirteen, till I got perfectly hysterical. The more I laughed, the angrier she grew, of course; till at last she went out into the kitchen and slammed the door after her. But I heard her telling Mother that that gal of hers appeared to be losing such wits as she had,--not that 't was any great loss, as fur as she could see. Wasn't that dreadful, Hildegarde? Of course I was wheeled over to her house the next day, and begged her pardon; but she was still withering and persistent, though she said, 'Very excusable!' at last.\"  \"Why, Rose!\" said Hildegarde, laughing. \"I didn't suppose you were _ever_ naughty, even when you were a baby.\"  \"Oh, indeed I was!\" answered Rose; \"just as naughty as any one else, I suppose. Did I ever tell you how I came near making poor Bubble deaf? That wasn't exactly naughty, because I didn't mean to do anything bad; but it was funny. I must have been about five years old, and I used to sit in a sort of little chair-cart that Father made for me. One day Mother was washing, and she set me down beside the baby's cradle (that was Bubble, of course), and told me to watch him, and to call her if he cried. Well, for a while, Mother said, all was quiet. Then she heard Baby fret a little, and then came a queer sort of noise, she could not tell what, and after that quiet again. So she thought what a nice, helpful little girl I was getting to be; and when she came in she said, 'Well, Pinkie, you stopped the baby's fretting, didn't you?'  \"'Oh, yes, Mother!' I said, as pleased as possible. 'I roared in his ear!' You may imagine how frightened Mother was; but fortunately it did him no harm.\"  Here the road dipped down into a gully, and Dr. Abernethy had to pick his way carefully among loose stones. Presently the stone-walls gave place to a most wonderful kind of fence,--a kind that even country-bred Rose had never seen before. When the great trees, the giants of the old forest, had been cut, and the ground cleared for farm-lands and pastures, their stumps had been pulled up by the roots; and these roots, vast, many-branched, twisted into every imaginable shape, were locked together, standing edgewise, and tossing their naked arms in every direction.  \"Oh, how wonderful!\" cried Hildegarde. \"Look, Rose! they are like the bones of some great monster,--a gigantic cuttlefish, perhaps. What huge trees they must have been, to have such roots as these!\"  \"Dear, beautiful things!\" sighed Rose. \"If they could only have been left! Isn't it strange to think of people not caring for trees, Hilda?\"  \"Yes!\" said Hilda, meekly, and blushing a little. \"It is strange now; but before last year, Rose, I don't believe I ever looked at a tree.\"  \"Oh, before last year!\" cried Rose, laughing. \"There wasn't any 'before last year.' I had never heard of Shelley before last year. I had never read a ballad, nor a 'Waverley,' nor the 'Newcomes,' nor anything. Let's not talk about the dark ages. You love trees now, I'm sure.\"  \"That I do!\" said Hildegarde. \"The oak best of all, the elm next; but I love them all.\"  \"The pine is my favorite,\" said Rose. \"The great stately king, with his broad arms; it always seems as if an eagle should be sitting on one of them. What was that line you told me the other day?--'The pine-tree spreads his dark-green layers of shade.' Tennyson, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Hildegarde. \"But it was 'Cranford' that made me think of it. And it isn't 'pine-tree,' after all. I looked, and found it was 'cedar.' Mr. Holbrook, you remember,--Miss Matty's old lover,--quotes it, when they are taking tea with him. Dear Miss Matty! do you think Cousin Wealthy is the least little bit like her, Rose?\"  \"Perhaps!\" said Rose, thoughtfully. \"I think--Oh, Hilda, look!\" she cried, breaking off suddenly. \"What a queer little house!\"  Hildegarde checked Dr. Abernethy, who had been trotting along quite briskly, and they both looked curiously at the little house on their left, which certainly was \"queer,\"--a low, unpainted shanty, gray with age, the shingles rotting off, and moss growing in the chinks. The small panes of glass were crusted with dirt, and here and there one had been broken, and replaced with brown paper. The front yard was a tangle of ribbon-grass and clover; but a tuft of straggling flowers here and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24826"],["title","Hildegarde's Holiday: A Story for Girls (#8)"],["body","showed that it had once had care and attention. There was no sign of life about the place.  \"Rose!\" cried Hildegarde, stopping the horse with a pull of the reins; \"it is a deserted house. Do you know that I have never seen one in my life? I must positively take a peep at it, and see what it is like inside. Take the reins, Bonne Silène, while I go and reconnoitre the position.\" She jumped out, and making her way as best she might through the grassy tangle, was soon gazing in at one of the windows. \"Oh!\" she cried, \"it _isn't_ deserted, Rose! At least?--well, some one has been here. But, oh, me! oh, _me_! What a place! I never, never dreamed of such a place. I--\"  \"What _is_ the matter?\" cried Rose. \"If you don't tell me, I shall jump out!\"  \"No, you won't!\" said Hildegarde. \"You'd better not, Miss! but _oh_, dear! who ever, ever dreamed of such a place? My dear, it is the Abode of Dirt. Squalid is no word for it; squalor is richness compared to this house. I am looking--sit still, Rose!--I am looking into a room about as big as a comfortable pantry. There is a broken stove in it, and a table, and a stool; and in the room beyond I can see a bed,--at least, I suppose it is meant for a bed. Oh! what person _can_ live here?\"  \"_I am coming_, Hilda,\" said Rose. \"The only question is whether I get out with your help or without.\"  \"Obstinate Thing!\" cried Hildegarde, flying to her assistance. \"Well, it shall see the lovely sight, so it shall. Carefully, now; don't trip on these long grass-loops. There! isn't that a pretty place? Now enjoy yourself, while I get out the tie-rein, and fasten the good beast to a tree.\"  In hunting for the tie-rein under the seat of the carriage, Hildegarde discovered something else which made her utter an exclamation of surprise. \"Luncheon!\" she cried. \"Rose, my dear, did you know about this basket? Saint Martha must have put it in. Turnovers, Rose! sandwiches, Rose! and, I declare, a bottle of milk and a tin cup. Were ever two girls so spoiled as we shall be?\"  [Illustration: \"THEN THEY HUGGED EACH OTHER A LITTLE.\"]  \"How kind!\" said Rose. \"I am not in the least hungry, but I _should_ like a cup of milk. Oh, Hildegarde!\"  \"What now?\" asked that young woman, returning with the precious basket, and applying her nose once more to the window. \"Fresh horrors?\"  \"My dear,\" said Rose, \"look! That is the pantry,--that little cupboard, with the door hanging by one hinge; and there isn't anything in it to eat, except three crackers and an onion.\"  Both girls gazed in silence at the forlorn scene before them. Then they looked at each other. Hildegarde gave an expressive little shake to the basket. Rose smiled and nodded; then they hugged each other a little, which was a foolish way they had when they were pleased. Very cautiously Hildegarde pushed the crazy door open, and they stood in the melancholy little hovel. All was even dirtier and more squalid than it had looked from outside; but the girls did not mind it now, for they had an idea, which had come perhaps to both at the same moment. Hilda looked about for a broom, and finally found the dilapidated skeleton of one. Rose, realizing at once that search for a duster would be fruitless, pulled a double handful of long grass from the front yard, and the two laid about them,--one vigorously, the other carefully and thoroughly. Dust flew from doors and windows; the girls sneezed and coughed, but persevered, till the little room at last began to look as if it might once have been habitable.  \"Now you have done enough, Rosy!\" cried Hildegarde. \"Sit down on the doorstep and make a posy, while I finish.\"  Rose, being rather tired, obeyed. Hildegarde then looked for a scrubbing-brush, but finding none, was obliged to give the little black table such a cleaning as she could with the broom and bunches of grass. Behind the house was a lilac-bush, covered with lovely fragrant clusters of blossoms; she gathered a huge bunch of them, and putting them in a broken pitcher with water, set them in the middle of the table. Meanwhile Rose had found two or three peonies and some sweet-william, and with these and some ribbon-grass had made quite a brilliant bouquet, which was laid beside the one cracked plate which the cupboard afforded. On this plate the sandwiches were neatly piled, and the turnovers (all but two, which the girls ate, partly out of gratitude to Martha, but chiefly because they were good) were laid on a cluster of green leaves. As for the milk, that, Hildegarde declared, Rose must and should drink; and she stood over her till she tilted the bottle back and drained the last drop.  \"Oh, dear!\" said Rose, looking sadly at the empty bottle; \"I hope the poor thing doesn't like milk. It couldn't be a child, Hildegarde, could it? living here all alone. And anyhow he--or she--will have a better dinner than one onion and--\" But here she broke off, and uttered a low cry of dismay. \"Oh, Hilda! Hilda! look there!\"  Hildegarde turned hastily round, and then stood petrified with dismay; for some one was looking in at the window. Pressed against the little back window was the face of an old man, so withered and wrinkled that it looked hardly human; only the eyes, bright and keen, were fixed upon the girls, with what they thought was a look of anger. Masses of wild, unkempt gray hair surrounded the face, and a fragment of old straw hat was drawn down over the brows. Altogether it was a wild vision; and perhaps it was not surprising that the gentle Rose was terrified, while even Hildegarde felt decidedly uncomfortable. They stood still for a moment, meeting helplessly the steady gaze of the sharp, fierce eyes; then with one impulse they turned and fled,--Hildegarde half carrying her companion in her strong arms. Half laughing, half crying, they reached the carriage. Rose tumbled in somehow, Hildegarde flew to unfasten the tie-rein; and the next moment they were speeding away at quite a surprising rate, Dr. Abernethy having, for the first time in years, received a smart touch of the whip, which filled him with amazement and indignation.  Neither of the girls spoke until at least a quarter of a mile lay between them and the scene of their terror; then, as they came to the foot of a hill, Hildegarde checked the good horse to a walk, and turned and looked at Rose. One look,--and they both broke into fits of laughter, and laughed and laughed as if they never would stop.  \"Oh!\" cried Hildegarde, wiping the tears which were rolling down her cheeks. \"Rose! I wonder if I looked as guilty as I felt. No wonder he glowered, if I did.\"  \"Of course you did,\" said Rose. \"You were the perfect ideal of a Female Burgler, caught with the spoons in her hand; and I--oh! my cheeks are burning still; I feel as if I were nothing but a blush. And after all, we _were_ breaking and entering, Hilda!\"  \"But we did no harm!\" said Hilda, stoutly. \"I don't much care, now we are safe out of the way. And I'm glad the poor old glowering thing will have a good dinner for once. Rose, he must be at least a hundred! Did you ever see anything look so old?\"  Rose shook her head meditatively. \"It's dreadful to think of his living all alone there,\" she said. \"For he must be alone. There was only one plate, you know, and that wretched bed. Oh, Hilda!\" she added, a moment later, \"the basket! we have left the basket there. What shall we do? Must we go back?\"  \"Perish the thought!\" cried Hildegarde, with a shudder half real, half playful. \"I wouldn't go back there now for the half of my kingdom. Let me see! We will not tell Cousin Wealthy to-day--\"  \"Oh, no!\" cried Rose, shrinking at the bare thought.  \"Nor even to-morrow, perhaps,\" continued Hildegarde. \"She would be frightened, and might expect you to be ill; we will wait a day or two before we tell her. But Martha is not nervous. We can tell her to-morrow, and say that we will get another basket. After all, we were doing no harm,--none in the world.\"  But the best-laid plans, as we all know, \"gang aft agley;\" and the girls were not to have the telling of their adventure in their own way.  That evening, as they were sitting on the piazza after tea, they heard Miss Wealthy's voice, saying, \"Martha, there is some one coming up the front walk,--an aged man, apparently. Will you see who it is, please? Perhaps he wants food, for I see he has a basket.\"  Hildegarde and Rose looked at each other in terror.  \"Oh, Hilda!\" whispered Rose, catching her friend's hand, \"it must be he! What shall we do?\"  \"Hush!\" said Hildegarde. \"Listen, and don't be a goose! Do? what should he do to us? He might recite the 'Curse of Kehama,' but it isn't likely he knows it.\"  Martha, who had been reconnoitring through a crack of the window-blind, now uttered an exclamation. \"Well, of all! Mam, it's old Galusha Pennypacker, as sure as you stand there.\"  \"Is it possible?\" said Miss Wealthy, in a tone of great surprise. \"Martha, you _must_ be mistaken. Galusha Pennypacker coming here. Why _should_ he come here?\"  But for once Martha was not ready to answer her mistress, for she had gone to open the door.  The girls listened, with clasped hands and straining ears.  \"Why, Mr. Pennypacker!\" they heard Martha say. \"This is never you?\"  Then a shrill, cracked voice broke in, speaking very slowly, as if speech were an unaccustomed effort. \"Is there--two gals--here?\"  \"Two gals?\" repeated Martha, in amazement. \"What two gals?\"  \"Gals!\" said the old man's voice,--\"one on 'em highty-tighty, fly-away-lookin', 'n' the other kind o' 'pindlin'; drivin' your hoss, they was.\"  \"Why--yes!\" said Martha, more and more astonished. \"What upon earth--\"  \"Here's their basket!\" the old man continued; \"tell 'em I--relished the victuals. Good-day t' ye!\"  Then came the sound of a stick on the steps, and of shuffling feet on the gravel; and the next moment Miss Wealthy and Martha were gazing at the guilty girls with faces of mute amazement and inquiry which almost upset Hildegarde's composure.  \"It's true,"]]]
