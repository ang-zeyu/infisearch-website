These facts indicate a decided response to the higher wage attraction of New York City. It should be remarked that the wage-earner in his migration to secure higher wages seldom takes into consideration the higher cost of living in New York City. Table VI, following, gives the details of the comparison:   TABLE VI.

The conclusion of the matter, therefore, is that the Negro is responding to the call of commerce and industry and is coming to the urban centers under economic influences similar to those that move his fellows.  III. Secondary or Individual Causes of the Negro's Movement Cityward.--It requires only a brief survey of the legislation in several of the Southern states to understand that this has played a part in uprooting the population from the soil and transplanting it in the urban centers.  The trend of legislation everywhere has been to make the city attractive at the expense of the rural districts. First among these measures have been the improved educational facilities provided by municipal authorities. In the South, this has come since 1865. Parks and recreation centers are rapidly being added. General regulation of rights and privileges has been made with the city in the foreground, and many another measure has favored the urban centers.  Labor legislation in the South that affects the Negro population has been of two kinds, aside from the laws to regulate or prohibit the exodus of laborers through the activity of labor agents or runners[13]: (1) that applying to the industrial centers and serving to make conditions of labor on railroads, in mines, and other places where Negroes are employed more attractive and payment of wages more certain and frequent than in the case of labor upon the farm and plantation; (2) that dealing with the relations of landlord and tenant which in practical operation often makes the life of the tenant and farm-hand very hard. Coupled with the ignorance of the usual Negro peasant, these laws are sometimes tools of coercion.[14]  Another line of secondary or individual causes is shown in the reasons for coming to New York City given by wage-earners mentioned above (p. 27). The tabulation of answers indicates that the influences drawing individuals to New York City are, on the one hand, family relationships. These cases, 68 or 32.4 per cent of the 210 replies noted above, have been classified as those who came because of parents, because of husband or wife, or because of other relatives. On the other hand, there are the individual inclinations. The latter, 43 or 20.5 per cent of the 210 replies, are grouped under restlessness, attraction of New York City, unattractiveness of former residence, and miscellaneous. These groupings and designations are given as suggestive only to facilitate the understanding of the mental attitude of the Negro wage-earner. Their more or less economic tinge may be seen. The reasons classified as \"family\" and as \"individual\" are reported in detail in Table VII, following:   TABLE VII.

The restriction by \"Jim Crow\" legislation and by custom of the rights and privileges of persons of color in Southern communities leads some of them to migrate North. They long for a larger liberty for themselves and particularly for their children, which the hard conditions of Southern communities do not give. They come North to gain this and to escape the proscriptions.[15] They settle in the cities. A similar force probably operates in a few sections of the South to send Negro families to the security of the urban centers.[16]  The final conclusion from these facts concerning the causes operating upon the Negro population has been clearly indicated in the above discussion. Such fundamental economic and social causes do not cease to operate suddenly. So far as the development of the South is concerned, the agricultural, industrial and commercial movement is in its infancy, and it will doubtless be of an indefinite growth. The secondary and individual causes will continue to play their part. The Negro will be affected in a manner similar to that of the Southern white population. Any rural improvement or \"back-to-the-land\" movement should recognize that along with the whites, Negroes will continue to migrate to the urban centers and that they will come to the cities in comparatively large numbers to stay. The problem alike of statesman, race leader, and philanthropist is to understand the conditions of segregation and oppositions due to race prejudices that are arising as a sequel to this urban concentration and to co-operate with the Negro in his effort to learn to live in the city as well as the country.  Although it requires serious attention, the situation is a hopeful one. Improvement in the living and working conditions has its effect upon the health and morals of Negroes just as it has in the case of other elements of the population. Intelligence is essentially a matter of education and training. Good housing, pure milk and water supply, sufficient food and clothing, which adequate wages allow, street and sewer sanitation, have their direct effect upon health and physique. And municipal protection and freedom from the pressure of the less moral elements of the environing group go a long way toward elevating standards of morality. In spite of the limits which the neglect and prejudice of a white public sets to opportunities for improvement, Negroes do show progress along these lines.  Speaking first of the health of Negroes in cities, an index is given in the general death-rate.[17] In the period from 1871 to 1904, the death rate for the white and Negro populations of several Southern cities is summarized by Mr. Hoffman.[18] Of the consolidated death-rate of the white population, he says,      For only two cities are the returns complete for the entire     period of thirty-four years. The tendency of the rate has been     _persistently downward_ from 26.7 per 1,000 in 1871 to 20.6 in     1886 and 17.4 in 1904. Commencing with the rate for the year     1871, the general death-rate of the white population of     Southern cities shows an _upward direction_ at different times     _during twelve years_, and a _downward_ direction _during     twenty-one years_, following in this respect practically the     same course as the corresponding death-rate for Northern and     Western cities combined. The year of _maximum mortality_ was     _1878_, due to a yellow fever epidemic, while the year of     _minimum mortality_ was, as in the case of the Northern and     Western cities, _1903_.  In reference to the table for the Negro population he says,[19]      Without exception, the death-rates are materially in excess of     the corresponding death-rates of the white population, but there     has also been in this case a _persistent decline_ in the general     death-rate from 38.1 per 1,000 in 1871 to 32.9 in 1886 and 28.1     in 1904. Commencing with the rate for the year 1871, the general     death-rate of the colored population of Southern cities at     different times assumed an _upward_ direction _during fifteen     years_ and a _downward_ direction _during eighteen years_,     departing in this respect from the corresponding mortality of     the white population of Southern cities and the general     population of Northern and Western cities, the tendency of which     was more distinctly towards a definite improvement. The year of     _maximum mortality_ for the colored population was _1873_, while     the year of _minimum mortality_ was _1903_.  The general correspondence and few divergencies of the two death-rates are more clearly seen from the following diagram,[20] adapted from Hoffman's study already cited:     [Illustration: Diagram II:    THE GENERAL DEATH RATE OF AMERICAN CITIES 1871-1904]  Other data[21] for two of the cities investigated by Mr. Hoffman, and for three other cities (Atlanta, Ga., Charleston, S.C., and Richmond, Va.) from 1882 to 1905 furnish results similar to his and indicate likewise that while the general death-rate for the Negro population is uniformly in excess of that of the white, _there is a tendency downward_. For example, in Atlanta, Ga., the death-rates from 1882 to 1885 were for the white population, 18.22 per 1,000, Negro, 37.96; from 1886 to 1890, white, 19.25, Negro, 33.41; from 1891 to 1905, white, 18.03 per 1,000, Negro, 32.76. Baltimore, Md., Charleston, S.C., Memphis, Tenn., and Richmond, Va., show a similar decrease, except that the white and Negro populations of Baltimore show an increase in the third period, 1891 to 1905, and the rate of the Negro population of Charleston increased in the second period, 1886 to 1890.  We see, then, that while the death-rate of Negroes in Southern cities has been considerably in excess of that of the whites, there has been at the same time a similar tendency toward improvement.  And where there is unprejudiced effort the death-rate among Negroes is affected favorably by improved living conditions. The chief health-officer of Richmond, Va., Dr. E.C. Levy, has sounded a note which is not mere prophecy.[22] He said, in 1906, \"There is no doubt whatsoever but that the introduction of better sanitation among the colored people would have great influence on their high death-rate, but whether, after all, it can be brought down as low as the white rate, is a matter which can not be foretold.\" Again, in 1907, he says,      We must clearly face the issue that the first fruits of improved     sanitation in Richmond will most probably be seen in a lowering     of the death-rate among the colored people, as conditions among     them are so much worse at present, but this in turn will     gradually react on the white race.  And, in 1908, this significant paragraph occurs in his report:      The white death-rate in Richmond during 1908 was 17.48 per 1000;     the colored rate was 29.21 per 1000. Although the colored rate     was thus 67 per cent higher than the white rate, the decrease in     the colored rate from 1907 was greater than the decrease in the     white rate, the 1907 rates being 18.11 for whites and 32.99 for     Negroes.
