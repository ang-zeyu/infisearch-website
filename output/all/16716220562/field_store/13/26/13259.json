We have to be careful,\" said Mrs. Hen.  \"And there's Peter Mink, too,\" Grumpy went on. \"Don't leave an opening big enough for him! He can get through a small hole, too--any that's big enough for his head.\"  At that Mrs. Hen looked startled, as if she had just remembered something that made her feel uneasy.  \"He couldn't get through a rat hole, could he?\" she inquired nervously.  \"Why--there isn't one here, is there?\" Grumpy asked.  \"There is an old one,\" she admitted. \"It hasn't been used in my time.\"  \"If I could see it I'd know at once whether Pete could crawl through it,\" Grumpy Weasel said, talking to himself--or so it seemed to Mrs. Hen.  \"I'll show it to you gladly!\" she cried. \"Do come right in and look at our rat hole, Mr. Weasel!\"  As she spoke, Mrs. Hen started for the henhouse. And after her crept Grumpy Weasel, hoping that nobody else would see him. So far as he could tell, the hens were all out of doors, scratching in the dirt. But suddenly Mrs. Hen's jealous neighbor began to set up a great squawking, calling upon Mrs. Hen to be careful, for she was in great danger.  Fat Mrs. Hen turned about with a vexed look upon her handsome but somewhat stupid face.  \"Walk right in!\" she said to Grumpy. \"I must stop and settle with her. She has gone too far.\" And leaving Grumpy to find the rat hole without her help, Mrs. Hen fluttered across the henyard with her head thrust forward, to give her meddlesome neighbor a number of hard pecks and so teach her to mind her own affairs.  With a low chuckle Grumpy Weasel slipped inside the henhouse, where he found himself quite alone. It took him but a few moments to discover in one corner of the building the old rat hole of which Mrs. Hen had spoken.  And then he went to the door and looked out, for Mrs. Hen and her neighbor were making a terrific racket. He saw the end of the squabble. And soon Mrs. Hen came running back, with her feathers sadly rumpled, and her comb awry.  \"I settled with her,\" she gasped. \"And now tell me about the rat hole. Could Peter Mink get through it?\"  \"No, he couldn't!\" Grumpy Weasel said. Then he dodged strangely back into the henhouse. And though Mrs. Hen hopped in after him she couldn't find him anywhere.  She couldn't understand it.     XV  THE GREAT MYSTERY   The story soon spread all around the farmyard, how fat Mrs. Hen had been seen talking with no less a rascal than Grumpy Weasel.  Everybody told her that it was a dangerous thing to do and that it was a wonder she had escaped, until Mrs. Hen began to feel that she was quite the most important person in the neighborhood. Even old dog Spot asked her some questions one day--some of which she could answer, and some of which she could not.  For one thing, she couldn't (or wouldn't) tell what way Grumpy left the farmyard. \"He just jumped back and was gone before I knew it,\" she said.  \"That's what they all say,\" said Spot. \"He's so quick you never can see him go.\"  Now, Mrs. Hen ought to have explained that Grumpy Weasel disappeared from inside the henhouse. But she was not a person of much sense. By that time she began to think that perhaps Grumpy Weasel was as bad as the neighbors had said. And she was afraid that her relations might find fault with her if they learned that she had invited Grumpy to enter their house. Silly Mrs. Hen decided that she wouldn't tell what she had done. But she never tired of talking about what she called \"the great mystery\"--meaning \"Where did Grumpy Weasel go?\"  It was simple enough. To escape meeting old dog Spot, Grumpy Weasel had crawled into the old rat hole. It suited him quite well to do that, for more than one reason. Not only did he avoid trouble, but he found the other end of the rat hole. Silly Mrs. Hen had done exactly as he had hoped. She had shown him a way to get into the henhouse at night in spite of locks and bolts and doors. And Grumpy Weasel went off to the woods well pleased with himself.  \"Perhaps, after all, it pays to be pleasant,\" he said--just as if that was a reason! But he stopped short all at once. \"There's that stupid Mrs. Hen,\" he cried aloud. \"She was pleasant; but it won't pay her, in the end!\" So he decided on the spot that he would keep on being surly. It would be much easier for him, anyhow.  That very night Grumpy Weasel stole back to the henhouse. And he was just about to creep up to the old rat hole, pausing first to take a searching look all around, when he saw a motionless figure sitting on a low-hanging limb of a tree near-by. It was Solomon Owl. And Grumpy could see that he was staring at the rat hole as if he were waiting for somebody.  Grumpy Weasel knew at once that that rat hole was no safe place for him. Very gingerly he drew back into a deep shadow. And as he pondered silently he saw a huge rat step out of the hole. Solomon Owl swooped down and grabbed the fellow before he knew what was happening.  Well, Grumpy Weasel saw that all his trouble had gone for nothing. Silly Mrs. Hen hadn't known what she was talking about. If Solomon Owl was in the habit of watching that hole Grumpy certainly didn't mean to go near it.  Of course he was angry. But Mrs. Hen never learned what he said about her. No matter what remarks her neighbors made, she always insisted afterward that Grumpy Weasel was one of the most pleasant and polite gentlemen she had ever met.     XVI  GUARDING THE CORNCRIB   Grumpy Weasel never seemed to have anything but bad luck whenever he went near the farmyard. Perhaps that was the reason why he kept going back there, for he was nothing if not determined. Anyhow, he had found the hunting poor along his stone wall in the woods. And there was so much \"game,\" as he called it, about the farm buildings that he thought it was silly to leave it for such scamps as Peter Mink and Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon.  So he took to loitering near Farmer Green's corncrib. And he was not at all pleased to find Fatty Coon there one evening. He wouldn't have spoken to Fatty at all had not that plump young chap hurled a cutting remark directly at him: \"There are no chickens in this building. This is a corncrib.\"  \"Don't you suppose I know that?\" Grumpy retorted. \"I've come here to guard the corn from mice and squirrels.\"  \"There's no need of your doing that,\" Fatty Coon told him. \"Have you never noticed those tin pans, upside down, on top of the posts on which the corncrib rests? How could a mouse or a squirrel ever climb past one of those?\"  \"There are ways,\" Grumpy Weasel said wisely.  \"I doubt it,\" Fatty replied. \"I don't believe the trick can be done.\"  Then, not to oblige Fatty, but to show him he was mistaken, Grumpy climbed a tree near-by, dropped from one of its branches to the roof of the corncrib, and quickly found a crack in the side of the building through which he slipped with no trouble at all.  Suddenly there was a great scurrying and scrambling inside. And soon Fatty Coon saw Frisky Squirrel and several of his friends--not to mention three frightened mice--come tumbling out and tear off in every direction.  Presently Grumpy Weasel stuck his head through a crack between two boards.  \"Did you catch the robbers?\" he called to Fatty Coon.  \"They were too spry for me,\" Fatty told him. He wouldn't have stopped one anyhow, for Grumpy Weasel.  \"Which way did they go, old Slow Poke?\" Grumpy cried as he jumped down in great haste.  \"Everywhere!\" Fatty told him.  \"Can't you be a little more exact? You don't think--do you?--that I can run more than one way at a time?\"  \"Why don't you run round and round in a circle?\" Fatty suggested. \"In that way you might catch at least half those youngsters--and perhaps all of them.\"  \"That's the first real idea you ever had in your life!\" Grumpy exclaimed--which was as near to thanking a person as he was ever known to come.     XVII  GRUMPY'S MISTAKE   As soon as Grumpy Weasel left to chase the squirrels and mice that he had frightened away from the corncrib Fatty Coon hurried into the building through a hole in the floor which nobody knew but himself.  Though he was a great eater Fatty was also a fast one. And now he bolted a huge meal of corn in only a few minutes. Then, smiling broadly, he left the corncrib by his private doorway and squatted down to await Grumpy's return.  In a little while Grumpy appeared.  \"I hoped I'd see you again,\" Fatty Coon told him. \"Did you have any luck?\"  \"No!\" Grumpy Weasel snapped. \"I was mistaken about your idea. It was a very poor one. For I've been running in a circle (as you suggested) till I'm dizzy; and I haven't seen the least sign of a mouse nor a squirrel.\"  Fatty Coon told him to cheer up.  \"I've another idea for you,\" he said.  \"Keep it! Keep it!\" Grumpy Weasel hissed. \"Your last idea only made me tired; and I haven't a capture to my credit to-night.\"  \"That's because you ran too fast,\" Fatty explained glibly. \"Now, if you'll be careful to run slowly, and do just as I tell you, I can promise that there'll be a capture, without fail.\"  [Illustration: Grumpy Weasel Visits the Corncrib. (_Page 70_)]  Grumpy had had such bad luck in his hunting about the farmyard that he decided to listen, anyhow. He told himself that he wouldn't take Fatty's advice unless it was much better than he expected.  \"Well--go on!\" he grunted.  \"Do you see that little house near the woodshed?\" Fatty Coon asked him. \"It has a low doorway that's always open, and no windows at all.\"  \"Yes!\" said Grumpy Weasel harshly. \"Of course I see it. I'm not blind.\"  \"Do you know who lives there?\"  \"I always supposed that it belonged to Johnnie Green,\" said Grumpy. \"His father is big and lives in the big house, and Johnnie is little and lives in the little house.\"  Fatty Coon laughed merrily.  \"You don't know as much as I thought you did!\" he cried. It may be that Fatty had set out to make Grumpy angry. Anyhow, Grumpy's eyes burned in the darkness like two coals of fire.  \"I'm right about that little house,\" he wrangled.  \"Nonsense!\" Fatty Coon exclaimed. And that made"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24881"],["title","The Tale of Grumpy Weasel (#5)"],["body","angrier than ever.  \"You learned that word of old Mr. Crow!\" he grumbled. \"It's his favorite expression; and I can't endure it.\"  \"You don't need to stay here and listen to it,\" Fatty Coon said. \"If you dared to you could run over to Johnnie Green's house (as you call it); and if you found that you were right about it I promise you I'd never say 'Nonsense' again.\"  If Grumpy Weasel hadn't been so angry perhaps he wouldn't have been so eager to prove himself right. While Fatty watched him he bounded across the farmyard and stopped at the doorway of the tiny house. And then he bounded back again, a great deal faster, with old dog Spot yelping behind him.  Fatty Coon did not wait for anything more. He made for the woods at top speed, grinning as he went.  The next day he pretended to be surprised to meet Grumpy.  \"You must have forgotten my advice,\" he said. \"I promised you that there would be a capture if you ran slowly. But it's plain that you ran too fast, or you wouldn't be here.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Grumpy Weasel shouted, flying into a passion at once. And he often wondered, afterward, what Fatty Coon found to laugh at.     XVIII  POP! GOES THE WEASEL   There were many things that did not please Grumpy Weasel--things that almost any one else would have liked. For instance, there was music. The Pleasant Valley Singing Society, to which most of the bird people belonged, did not number Grumpy Weasel among its admirers. He never cared to hear a bird sing--not even Jolly Robin's cousin the Hermit, who was one of the most beautiful singers in the woods. And as for Buddy Brown Thrasher, whom most people thought a brilliant performer, Grumpy Weasel always groaned whenever he heard him singing in the topmost branches of a tree.  A bird-song--according to Grumpy Weasel--was of use in only one way: it told you where the bird was. And that was a help, of course, if you were trying to catch him.  Nor did the musical Frog family's nightly concerts have much charm for Grumpy, though he did admit that some of their songs were not so bad as others.  \"I can stand it now and then,\" he said, \"to hear a good, glum croaking, provided there are plenty of discords.\"  Naturally, knowing how he felt, Grumpy Weasel's neighbors never invited him to listen to their concerts. On the contrary they usually asked him please to go away, if he happened to come along. Certainly nobody could sing his best, with such a listener.  As a rule Grumpy Weasel was glad to go on about his business, though to be sure he hated to oblige anybody. But one day he stopped and scolded at the top of his voice when he came upon the Woodchuck brothers whistling in the pasture.  Their whistles quavered a bit when they noticed who was present. And they moved a little nearer their front door, in order to dodge out of sight if need be. Although Grumpy Weasel might follow them, there was a back door they could rush out of. And since they knew their way about their underground halls better than he did they did not worry greatly.  \"We're sorry--\" said the biggest brother, who was called Billy Woodchuck--\"we're sorry you don't like our music. And we'd like to know what's the matter with it; for we always strive to please.\"  \"It's not so much the way you whistle,\" Grumpy snarled, \"though your whistling is bad enough, it's so cheerful. What I find fault with especially is the tune. It's insulting to me. And you can't deny it.\"  Well, the Woodchuck brothers looked at one another in a puzzled fashion.  \"Never again let me hear you whistling, 'Pop! Goes the Weasel,'\" Grumpy warned them. That was the name of the Woodchuck brothers' favorite air, and the one they could whistle best. And any one could see that they were quite upset.  \"Why don't you like that tune?\" Billy Woodchuck asked Grumpy Weasel politely.  \"It's that word 'pop,'\" Grumpy said. \"It reminds me of a pop-gun. And a pop-gun reminds me of a real gun. And that's something I don't want to think about.\"  Well, the Woodchuck brothers looked at one another again. But this time they smiled.  \"You've misunderstood,\" Billy Woodchuck told Grumpy Weasel. \"This is a different kind of _pop_. It means that when you enter a hole you _pop_ into it in a jiffy, without taking all day to do it.\"  For a wonder Grumpy Weasel was almost pleased.  \"That's true!\" he cried. \"I couldn't be slow if I wanted to be!\" And he actually asked the Woodchuck brothers to whistle \"Pop! Goes the Weasel\" once more.  But Grumpy Weasel never thought of thanking them.     XIX  HIDING FROM HENRY HAWK   In the spring Grumpy Weasel was always glad to see the birds coming back from the South. But it must not be supposed that it was because he liked to hear them sing (for he didn't!).  Nor should any one make the mistake of thinking that Grumpy Weasel loved the birds. The only reason why he welcomed them was because he liked to hunt them, and rob their nests.  But there were two birds that Grumpy didn't care to have in Pleasant Valley. He often wished that Solomon Owl and Henry Hawk would leave the neighborhood and never return. That was because they liked to hunt him.  Especially did Grumpy Weasel dislike Henry Hawk, who had an unpleasant habit of sitting motionless on a limb in the top of some great tree. From that high perch he swept the whole valley with his keen, cruel eyes, because (as he said) he \"liked to see what was going on.\"  If Henry Hawk saw anything anywhere that interested him he lost no time in reaching that place. It might be a bird, or a meadow mouse, or maybe a plump chicken. And he was always hoping to catch a glimpse of Grumpy Weasel.  One day early in the fall Mr. Hawk saw what he had been looking for so long. Near the old cider mill, up the road from Farmer Green's house, he spied a long, slender, brownish shape moving swiftly among a pile of barrels outside the building. He knew at once that it was Grumpy Weasel; and though he was a long way off Mr. Hawk could see that Grumpy was very busy looking for something--so busy, Mr. Hawk hoped, that Grumpy wouldn't notice anything else.  Henry Hawk had wonderful eyesight. As he came hurtling down out of the sky he could see that Grumpy was playing hide-and-seek with a mouse.  \"It's a shame to break up the game,\" Mr. Hawk chuckled to himself.  And just then something made Grumpy Weasel look up. It must have been Henry Hawk's shadow flickering over a barrel. There was no other sign that could have warned Grumpy.  He put the meadow mouse out of his mind without a bit of trouble and made a sidewise spring for the first hole on which his eyes lighted.  Grumpy was through it in a twinkling. Henry Hawk made a frantic grab with his talons at the black tip of Grumpy's tail, just as it whisked out of sight. But he was too late.  It did not soothe Henry Hawk's feelings to find that the meadow mouse had vanished at the same time. Henry would have liked to play hide-and-seek with him himself.  Mr. Hawk knew well enough where Grumpy was hiding. That slim fellow had sought safety in an empty jug, which was lying on its side near the pile of barrels. It made a fine fort for Grumpy Weasel. The enemy couldn't break through it. And there was only one loophole, which was far too small to do Henry Hawk the least good.  Henry saw at once that he might as well go away. So he went off grumbling.  \"This,\" he said, \"is what comes of disorderly habits. Farmer Green ought not to have left that jug lying there. If he hadn't, I might have been able to do him a good turn.\"     XX  A FREE RIDE   Inside the jug, where he had hidden to escape Henry Hawk, Grumpy Weasel yawned widely and licked his chops. He was having a dull time, waiting until he was sure that Henry Hawk had given up the chase and gone away.  In a little while Grumpy believed he could venture out in safety. But suddenly, to his great disgust, a wagon came clattering in from the road and pulled up right beside the pile of empty barrels near him.  It was Farmer Brown, driving his old horse Ebenezer. And of course Grumpy Weasel didn't care to show himself just then, especially with old dog Spot nosing around. He had already heard Spot give several sharp yelps.  \"That old dog knows I'm here somewhere but he can't tell exactly where,\" Grumpy said to himself. \"He can yelp his head off, for all I care.\"  And then Spot began to whine, and run in and out among the barrels, until he all but tripped Farmer Green, who was loading the barrels into the wagon.  \"Let him whine!\" said Grumpy Weasel softly. \"His yelping and whining don't scare me. He can't get inside this jug of mine. And I certainly shan't leave it so long as he stays here.\"  Meanwhile he could hear Farmer Green talking to old Spot, telling him not to be silly.  \"From the way you're acting anybody might think there was a bear around here,\" he told Spot.  Old dog Spot explained to Farmer Green in no uncertain fashion that it was no bear--but a weasel--that he was looking for. His nose told him that. And there was no mistake about it. But somehow Farmer Green couldn't understand a word he said. So after putting the last barrel on the load Farmer Green climbed up himself and started to drive off.  But old dog Spot wouldn't budge an inch. He hovered about the jug where Grumpy Weasel was hiding and made such a fuss that Farmer Green looked back at him.  \"Well! well!\" he exclaimed. And he stopped the horse Ebenezer and jumped down and walked back again.  \"I declare I'd have forgotten to take this jug if you hadn't reminded me of it,\" he told Spot. And thereupon he picked up the jug and set it in the back of the wagon.  This time Spot followed. This time he was in the wagon before Farmer Green was. And all the way down the road, until they reached the farmyard, he acted (or so Farmer Green told him!) like a simpleton.  The whole affair made Grumpy Weasel terribly angry. He thought it was an outrage for Farmer Green to kidnap him like that. And he was so enraged that he would have taken a bite out of anything handy."]]]
