From the time that I entered office I have     predicted that improved sanitation would benefit the Colored     race more quickly than the white, and the figures above given     justify this conclusion.  The statement of this health officer points to experience rather than to prejudiced notions about the physical weaknesses of Negroes.  From both the statistician and the sanitarian, therefore, comes the word that while the health of Negroes in cities is worse than that of whites, it shows a tendency to improve similar to that of the white population when a fairly impartial treatment is accorded.  As with health, so with other phases of the Negro's city life. There is no place for pessimism. Improvements in intelligence and in moral conditions can not be counted by case and set down in figures and tables.[23] But any one at all familiar either by reading or recollection with the condition of the Negro at the beginning of his freedom, who now takes an impartial and unprejudiced view of his intellectual and social life in urban communities, will come to no other conclusion than that in the face of peculiar whims and prejudices a large and increasing number in the group is arising to the full consciousness of a freeman and has assimilated the best that America affords in morals and intelligence; and that they are vitally concerned for the uplift of themselves and their people, persistently seeking to partake of all that makes for progress.[24]  For the whole Negro population in cities some light is thrown upon developments by the few facts at hand on crime among Negroes.[25] Statistics of crime are, of course, of limited worth in judging of moral conditions. Arrests and prison commitments have many factors which figures do not show and are quite as much a commentary upon the white communities at large as upon the unfortunate Negro law-breakers. Yet, along with other facts, these records of crime are a part of the social barometer.  An analysis of three periods of crime (prior to 1866-1867; 1867 to 1880, and 1880 to 1903) made by Mr. Monroe N. Work gives indicative results. Speaking of arrests per thousand of the Negro population in nine cities, he says,[26]      Taking the period from 1866 to 1882, it appears that at some     time during this period the arrest-rate, with the possible     exception of St. Louis, for each of the cities decreased. From     1882 to 1892-1896 there was, with some exceptions, a marked     increase in the arrest-rates of the several cities. This was     especially true of Chicago, Cincinnati, Washington and St.     Louis. From 1892-1896 to 1902-1903 there appears to have been a     general tendency for the Negro arrest-rates of these cities to     decrease. It appears that, on the whole, we are warranted in     concluding that for the nine cities considered, the rate of     Negro arrests per thousand of the Negro population is     decreasing.      The rates of jail commitments for Baltimore, Charleston, and St.     Louis have increased slowly since the seventies until the     nineties, and now apparently are beginning to decrease slightly.  The workhouse commitments for Philadelphia, Washington, Cincinnati, Louisville, Chicago and St. Louis \"show a similar tendency to decrease.\" Penitentiary commitments[27] for Baltimore and Chicago show, on the whole, a decreasing trend. \"The rate of annual commitments to the state penitentiary of Illinois from the city of Chicago in 1873 was 4.4; in 1902 the rate was 1.6,\" the highest rate being in 1873. Mr. Work continues,      The rate of annual commitments to the penitentiary from     Baltimore in 1888 was 1.1; in 1902 the rate of annual     penitentiary commitments from this city was 1.3; the highest     rate of annual penitentiary commitments from Baltimore was 2.0     in 1899. Since 1898-1899 there has been a decrease in the     annual Negro penitentiary commitments for both cities. The rate     per thousand of the Negro population for the number of prisoners     received in the Kansas penitentiary was available for four     years, as follows: in 1889 and 1890 the rate of annual Negro     commitments to the Kansas penitentiary was 1.5; in 1891 and 1892     the rate was 1.3. The rate per thousand of the Negro population     for the number of prisoners received annually in the Indiana     penitentiary was available for three years, as follows: in 1900     the rate was 2.1; in 1901 the rate was 2.5; and in 1902 the rate     was 2.0.  Mr. Work remarks finally,[28]      Summarizing our results, it is seen that police arrests, jail,     workhouse and penitentiary commitments appear to have increased     during the period from 1890 to 1892-1896. The highest rates of     arrests and commitments were about 1893. Since 1894-1896 the     tendency of both arrests and commitments to decrease has been     notable. The crime-rate for murder is also probably decreasing.     It appears, therefore, that the conclusion that crime is     probably decreasing among the Negroes of the United States is     warranted. The crime-rate of Negroes, North and South, appears     at present to be about the same, although the rate of police     arrests for some Southern cities is higher than that for the     Northern cities. The claim that there is greater criminality     among the Negroes of the North than those of the South is     probably not true. The fallacy on which this claim was based was     in comparing the criminal rate of the Negroes of the North, who     live almost entirely in cities, with the criminal rate of the     Negroes of the entire South, the great majority of whom live in     rural communities.  Besides, differences in age-grouping are usually ignored.  On the whole, therefore, there is firm ground for hope as the Negro becomes adjusted to the urban environment.  Since, then, these economic and social causes bid fair to continue their influence for an indefinite time, the concentration of Negroes in urban centers makes imperative the need of knowledge and methods of dealing with the problems that face the Negro and the Nation in these growing urban centers.[29] These questions of how to live in the city are problems of health, of intelligence and of morals. They are economic, social, political, educational and religious. The present essay is an attempt to study carefully the economic problems arising out of the Negro's adjustment in his struggles to make a living and to live in the city as seen in the commercial Metropolis of America; to find out at what he is employed there; to inquire of his efficiency and success, and of the attitude of employer and fellow employee. As we find Negroes rising from the plane of the employed to that of the employer, these questions arise: How does he get into business and what lines does he enter? With what success does he meet? What resourcefulness does he show? What are the reasons for his failures? We want to know what are his relations with the business world with which he deals and the consuming public to whom he caters. These and many other things can be ascertained only by painstaking investigation.  This study aims to be a small contribution to the end that efforts for betterment of urban conditions may be founded upon facts. The material has been treated in two parts--that relating to wage-earners and to business undertakings. In the former the United States Census reports, a personal canvass, and the unpublished schedules for 2,500 families of the New York State Census of 1905, were used as sources; for the latter a block to block canvass was made and records of the business enterprises were secured by personal interviews.   FOOT-NOTE ON THE MANNER AND CAUSES OF CITY CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION[30]  The manner of growth has been two-fold: (1) By natural increase through the lowering of the death-rate due partially to improved housing conditions, progress in personal hygiene of the poorer classes and in city sanitation and inspection; (2) by migration: that is, short distance movements by progressive stages from the more rural districts toward the larger centers.[31] In the case of the great cities this may mean increase in density of the most populated areas.[32]  The causes of concentration in cities are the following:  I. The Divorce of Men from the Soil.[33] The diminishing relative importance of elementary wants, improvements in scientific cultivation and in agricultural machinery, and the opening of distant and virgin fields by better transportation have reduced the relative number of workers needed on the soil.  II. The Growth of Commercial Centers.[34] This went hand in hand with the Agrarian Revolution. Trade has been the basis of city founding. The prevailing influence in determining location has been \"_a break in transportation_.\" Where goods are transferred and where, in addition, ownership changes hands, urban centers grow up. Wealthy classes arise which require others to supply their increasing and varied wants.  III. The Growth of Industrial Centers.[35] The passage of industry from the household, handicrafts and domestic systems to that of the factory, with the invention of power machinery and modern methods of transportation and communication, draws population away from the rural districts to the industrial centers.  IV. Secondary or Individual Causes.[36] (a) The shifting demand for transfer of labor from agricultural to industrial production was met by the economic motive of workers. (b) Political action has influenced city growth; legislation affecting trade and the migration of labor; centralization of governmental machinery in the cities; legal forms of land tenure, _etc._ (c) Social advantages such as better education, varied amusements, higher standard of living, intellectual associations and pursuits, draw people to urban centers, while desire for the contact of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24712"],["title","The Negro at Work in New York City: A Study in Economic Progress (#7)"],["body"," crowds, for the excitement and apparent ease of city life, serve to make the rural districts distasteful.

[14] The laws referred to are framed in terms of the regulation of contracts of employment, violation of contract, and contracts of employment with intent to defraud. Breach of contract in either set of cases is usually a misdemeanor (criminal act instead of a civil tort) with a penalty of fines (or imprisonment in Florida). Often in practical operation, they place the tenant and farm laborer at the discretion or mercy of the landlord. The writer has made repeated visits to many rural communities in Ala., Ga., Fla., Miss., and La., and has observed how these legislative measures serve as barriers to thrift among the landless Negro farmers. A number of the youths have expressed their conviction that since their fathers and mothers have accumulated nothing after years of labor on the land, they do not intend to stay on the plantation to repeat the process.

Beginning with a small body of slaves, it has since had its problems growing out of the presence of an increasing number of Negroes in the midst of the environing white group. In 1629, The Dutch West India Company pledged itself to furnish slaves to the Colonists of New Amsterdam.[37] A similar resolution was passed by the colony council in 1648[38] and by 1664 slavery had become of sufficient importance to receive legislative regulation in the Duke of York Code.[39] Both by further importations and by natural increase the Negro population grew until in 1704 it numbered about 1,500; in 1741 it was estimated at about 2,000, and in 1757 about 3,000. Beginning with the first Federal Census of 1790 there was an increase shown by each census except those of 1820 for Brooklyn and of 1850 and 1860 for other parts of New York City, mainly Manhattan.  The figures show a striking contrast in growth between Brooklyn and the other parts of New York City as now constituted, exclusive of Brooklyn. The former had a comparatively small Negro population until after 1860, but from 1790 the Negro population although small increased steadily, except the one decade between 1810 and 1820. This was a decrease of only 92 or 4.9 per cent of a population less than 2,000. Only one increase, from 1800 to 1810, was less than 13 per cent. Beginning with 5,915 at the Federal census of 1790, the Negro population of the other parts of New York City has shown a high per cent of increase in numbers, above 15 per cent, at eight of the twelve succeeding censuses, and 8.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent at two others. The decreases from 1840 to 1850, 13.2 per cent, and from 1850 to 1860, 7.5 per cent, were probably due to the unfavorable sentiment against the Negroes which arose during the abolition agitation of these periods and which had its effect on the Negro's movements to and from the city. The small increase from 1860 to 1870, 5.5 per cent, was very probably the result of the same causes--of the Civil War disturbances and the New York Draft riots, which deterred Negroes from coming to New York City and sent many Negro residents away.[40] The figures for Manhattan show a similar trend at each census. However, except the periods noted above, there has been a general trend toward increase in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Negro population has become a smaller and smaller part of the total population from decade to decade since 1810, but this is because the several streams of foreign immigrants have been large and not because the increase of the Negro population has been small.  Table VIII, which follows, shows the growth of the total and the Negro populations, and brings the full figures to view:   TABLE VIII.
