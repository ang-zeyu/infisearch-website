Incidentally the beach is a beach--not a collection of sharp boulders.  There is real sand--lots of it; the sort that gets hot and comforting in the sun, and invites people who have eaten too much luncheon to sleep.  And during the war, though the bands and other delights have departed, the sand has remained a source of pleasure to hundreds of people in need of a temporary rest cure.  They have come from the big hospitals at Etaples; they have come from the officers' rest-house.  Some have even come in motor cars from the trenches just for the day, and one and all they have lain on the beach and slept and then departed the better for it.  On a certain afternoon during the height of the German offensive in the spring of 1918 a girl was sitting on the beach staring out to sea.  On the horizon a black smudge of smoke stood up against the vivid blue of the sky; while, close in shore, a small sailing boat was barely making headway in the faint breeze.  The girl was a V.A.D., and the large French family which had planted itself close by cast little curious glances at her from time to time. And she was worth looking at, with her fair hair, deep blue eyes and that wonderful complexion which seems to be the exclusive property of the British.  Madame remarked on it to Monsieur, glancing at the white faces of her own daughters three, and Monsieur grunted an assent. Personally he was more occupied with the departed glories of Paris Plage than with a mere skin of roses and milk; at least the worthy man may have deemed it desirable to appear so.  \"Pauvre petite,\" went on the kindly matron, \"but she looks tired . . . so tired.\"  She heaved a deep sigh.  \"Mais que voulez-vous? c'est la guerre.\"  She watched her offspring preparing to paddle, and once again she sighed.  There was no band, no amusement--\"Mon Dieu! but it was triste.  This accursed war--would it never end?\"  Margaret Trent's looks did not lie; she was tired.  The rush of work just lately had almost broken her physical endurance, and there seemed but little chance of any slackening in the near future.  She felt that all she wanted was rest--utter, complete rest, where such things as bandages and iodine were unknown.  And even as the longing came to her she knew that a week of it would be all that she could stand.  She could see beyond the craving ache to stop--the well-nigh irresistible cry of her body for rest.  She could feel the call of spirit dominating mere bodily weariness.  And it drove her on--though every muscle cried a halt.  Before the war she had been in that set which drifted pleasantly through life, and yet she had not been of it.  She danced perfectly; she played tennis and golf and went to the proper places at the proper times--but she was different.  She had in her a certain idealistic dreaminess, an intense love of the beautiful in life.  Sordid things filled her with a kind of horror, and when the war came she tried to banish it from her mind like a dreadful nightmare.  But there were stories in the papers, and there were letters from friends telling of losses and unspeakable sufferings.  There was war all round her and one day the great unrest got hold of her, and would not be put aside.  She felt she had to do something . . .  And so she became a V.A.D. and in the fulness of time arrived in France.  Her friends prophesied that she would last a month--that she would never stand the sight of blood and wounds.  Her answer had been two years at Etaples.  And to those who know, that is an answer conducive of many things.  At times she tried to recall her outlook on life four years ago.  She had enjoyed herself up to a point, but all the time she had been groping towards something she did not possess.  She had read carefully and with discrimination, and the reading had only filled her with an added sense of her own futility.  She felt that she wanted to do something--but what was there for her to do?  Marriage, naturally, had come into her mental horizon.  But there had only been one man who had ever attracted her sufficiently to make it anything but an idle speculation.  There had been a time, one season in London, when this man had been her constant companion, and she had been far from disliking it.  At times he had seemed to be serious, and as a matter of fact the subtle difference between her and the stock pattern crowd had interested him more than he admitted even to himself.  Then one day she discovered that a certain flat and its occupant were very closely connected with his bank account.  It was by pure accident that she found it out.  A chance remark which she overheard at a dinner party. . . .  And the night before at the Grafton Galleries she had allowed him to kiss her as she had never before allowed a man . . .  It revolted her; and the man, astonished at first at her sudden change of manner, finally became annoyed, and the episode ceased.  They still met; there was no quarrel--but they met only as casual acquaintances.  It was at that stage of her reflections that a shadow fell across her and she looked up.  For a moment the coincidence failed to strike her, and then with a surprised little laugh she held out her hand.  \"Why, Derek,\" she said, \"I was just thinking of you.\"  Vane, his right arm tightly bound in a sling, sat down beside her.  \"I thought you looked pretty weary,\" he laughed.  \"Jove! but it's great seeing you again, Margaret . . .!  And the peace of it all.\"  He waved his left hand round the deserted beach.  \"Why, it's like old times--before the world went mad\" . . .  He fumbled with his cigarette case, until she took it out of his hand, and struck a match for him.  \"What ward are you in?\" she asked, when he had made himself comfortable.  \"Number 13; got here yesterday.\"  \"I come on night duty there to-night.  What's your trouble?\"  \"Machine-gun,\" he answered briefly.  \"A nice clean one through the shoulder.  And the man beside me took the next bullet through his heart.\"  He laughed shortly.  \"What a gamble--what a dam silly gamble, isn't it?\"  She looked thoughtfully out to sea.  The train of ideas his sudden appearance had interrupted was still half consciously occupying her mind.  \"Four years, isn't it, since we met?\" she said after a while.  \"Four centuries, you mean.  Four wasted centuries.  Nothing will ever be the same again.\"  \"Of course it won't.  But don't you think it's just as well?\"  She faced him smilingly.  \"There was so much that was all wrong, Derek; so much that was rotten.\"  \"And do you think that four years' insanity is going to prove the remedy?\"  Vane laughed cynically.  \"Except that there are a few million less men to carry on the rottenness\"--  Margaret shook her head.  \"We wanted something to wake us up; it's been drastic, but we're awake.\"  \"And what most of us want is to go to sleep again.  Don't you feel tired, Margaret, sometimes?\"  \"Yes--I suppose I do.  But it's the tiredness that comes with doing--not drifting. . . .  It's we who have got to make the new Heaven and the new Earth, Derek . . .\"  Again Vane laughed.  \"Still as idealistic as ever, I see.  Six months after peace we shall be scrambling and fighting and snarling again--after jobs and money and work.\"  Margaret Trent was silent, tracing a pattern in the sand with her finger.  \"The worry of scrambling after a job is not likely to hit you very hard,\" she said at length.  \"Which is perhaps as well,\" he returned lightly; \"for I'm certainly too weary to take the trouble.  I shall go away, if I'm alive to do it, to the South Sea Islands and live on fruit.  The only proviso is that it should be sufficiently ripe to drop into my mouth, and save me the trouble of picking it.\"  The girl turned and looked at him suddenly.  \"You've got it rather bad, old boy, haven't you?\"  \"Got what?\" he asked slowly.  \"Mental jaundice,\" she answered.  \"Your world askew.\"  \"Do you wonder?\" he returned grimly.  \"Isn't the world askew?\"  \"And if it is, someone has got to put it back.\"  \"That's what the little boy said when he pulled the chest of drawers over on top of him and lay struggling under it.  But he couldn't do it himself.  It's got beyond us, Margaret--and God seems to have forgotten.  There is just a blind, malignant Fate running the show.\"  She looked at him gravely.  \"You're wrong, Derek--utterly wrong.  The game is still in our hands, and we've got to keep it there.  What are you smiling at?\"  \"I was wondering,\" he answered, \"whether the last time I was told I was wrong, the sentence would have been concluded similarly. Unfortunately, the speaker died in the middle, thereby proving his contention.\"  \"Oh! but you're little,\" she cried, striking her hands together. \"Don't you see that you've got to look beyond the individual--that you've got to think Big?\"  \"We leave that to the newspaper men,\" he retorted cynically.  \"Our smiling heroes; our undaunted soldiers!  They are heroes, those Tommies; they are undaunted, but it's because they've got to be. They're up against it--and the Juggernaut of Fate knows he's got 'em. And they know he's got 'em.  They just eat and drink and are merry for to-morrow they. . . .  Ah! no; that's wrong.  We never die out here, Margaret; only the other fellow does that.  And if we become the other fellow, it's so deuced unexpected I don't suppose it matters much.\"  \"But, we've got to go through with it, haven't we?\" she said quietly.  \"Of course we have,\" he answered with a laugh; \"and the knowledge of that fact cuts about as much ice with the men in the mud holes up there as brave little Belgium or suffering little Serbia.  I tell you we're all dazed, Margaret--just living in a dream.  Some of us take it worse than others, that's all.  You want the constitution of an elephant combined with the intelligence of a cow to fight these days.\"  \"And yet,\" she said with a grave little smile, \"under-lying it all, there's the big ideal surely. . "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24945"],["title","Mufti (#3)"],["body",". .  If I didn't think that, if I didn't know that, I . . . I couldn't go on.\"  \"To which particular ideal do you allude?\" he asked cynically.  \"The League of Nations; or the triumph of Democracy, or the War to end War. They all sound so topping, don't they? received with howls of applause by the men who haven't had their boots off for a week.\"  He thumped the sand savagely.  \"Cut the cackle, my dear girl; cut the cackle.  This little performance was started by a few of the puppets who thought they had a winning hand, and the other puppets called a show down.  And then the game passed out of their hands.  They write books about it, and discover new Gods, and pass new Acts of Parliament--but the thing takes no notice.  It just goes on--inexorably.  Man has been dabbling with stakes that are too big for him, Margaret.  And the trouble is that the cards up in the trenches are getting mighty tattered.\"  She looked at him curiously.  \"I'd never have thought it would have taken you like that, Derek . . .  Not quite as badly.\"  \"You formed your opinion in the bad old days, didn't you?\" he said lightly.  \"When we danced and made love at the Grafton Galleries.\"  She flushed a little, but did not lower her eyes.  \"Such a serious girl you were too, Margaret; I wonder how you ever put up with a brainless sort of ass like me.\"  \"Because I liked you,\" she answered quietly, and suddenly it struck Vane, almost with a feeling of surprise, that the girl sitting beside him was more than attractive.  He wondered why he had let her slip so easily out of his life.  And the train of thought once started seemed a not unpleasant one. . . .  \"You'll get it back soon, Derek--your sense of proportion.  You've got to.\"  \"So that I can help build the new Heaven and the new Earth,\" he laughed.  \"So that you may help build the new Heaven and the new Earth,\" she repeated gravely rising to her feet.  \"I must go back or I'll miss my tea.\"  \"Have a cup with me in the village.\"  Vane scrambled up and fell into step beside her.  They passed Monsieur still snoring, and Madame nodding peacefully over her knitting, and crossed the deserted promenade.  Then in silence they walked up into the main street of the little town in search of a tea shop.  \"Do you realise, Margaret,\" he remarked as they sat down at a small marble-topped table, \"that I haven't seen or spoken to a woman for six months? . . .  Heaven help us!  Aren't there any cakes?\"  \"Of course not,\" laughed Margaret, \"nor milk, nor sugar.  There's a war on up the road.  You want about ten drops of that liquid saccharine.\" In the sunny street outside, soldiers in various stages of convalescence, strolled aimlessly about.  An occasional motor car, containing officers--on duty, of course--slowed down at the corner opposite and disgorged its load.  A closer inspection of one of them might have revealed a few suspicious looking gashes in the upholstery and holes in the mud-guards.  Of course--shrapnel--but, then shrapnel did not occur by the sea.  And on what duty could officers from the shrapnel area be engaged on at Paris Plage? . . .  However, let us be discreet in all things.  In a few hours that shrapnel scarred car would be carrying its freight back to Boulogne, where a table at the restaurant Mony had already been secured for dinner.  Then back through the night, to call at various dilapidated farms and holes in the ground, in the area where shrapnel and crumps are not unknown. . . .  But just for a few brief hours the occupants of the car were going to soak themselves in the Waters of Forgetfulness; they were going to live--even as the tripper from the slums lives his little span at Margate.  And they were no whit less excited at the thought . . .  They did not show it by an excessive consumption of indigestible fruit, or by bursting into unmelodious song.  True, the greatest of all the \"Q\" men, who had come officially from a Nissen hut near Poperinghe to study the question of salvaged materials at the base, had waved a friendly hand at all the ladies--beautiful and otherwise--whom they met.  But then save for salvage he was much as other men.  And with that exception they just lay back in the car and thought; while the trees that were green rushed past them, and war was not.  Thus had they come to the sea.  To-morrow once more the flat, dusty country with the heat haze shimmering over it and every now and then the dull drone of some bursting crump, or the vicious crack of high explosive.  Behind, the same old row of balloons; in front, the same old holes in the ground. . . .  But to-day--peace. . . .  Vane thoughtfully stirred the pale straw-coloured concoction reputed to be tea on the table in front of him.  The remark Margaret had made to him on the beach was running through his mind--\"The new Heaven and the new Earth.\"  Yes, but on what foundations?  And would they be allowed to anyway?  Reconstruction is work for the politician--not for the soldier. . . .  Most certainly not. . . .  The soldier's ignorance on every subject in the world except fighting is complete.  And even over that he's not all he might be: he requires quite a lot of help from lawyers, doctors, and successful grocers. . . .  In fact, the only thing he is allowed to do quite on his own is to die . . .  Vane smiled a little bitterly, and Margaret leaned across the table towards him.  \"You'll get it back soon, Derek--believe me, old boy.\"  \"That's very possible.  But will the people at home?  I'm jangled, Margaret, I know it--just for the time. . . .  However, don't let's talk about me.  Tell me about yourself. . . .\"  The girl shrugged her shoulders slightly.  \"I don't know that there's much to tell.  I've never been so happy in my life as I am at present . . .\"  \"In spite of all that?\"  He pointed out of the window to two soldiers limping painfully by on sticks.  \"Yes--in spite of all that.  One gets accustomed to that--and one's doing something.  After all, Derek, you get accustomed to death and mutilation up there in front.  It doesn't affect you. . . .\"  \"No, not to the same extent as it did.  In a way, I suppose not at all. But you--you were so different.\"  He thoughtfully drained his tea cup, and set it down again, and for a space neither of them spoke.  \"I can't help laughing at the comparison,\" said Margaret suddenly. \"Five years ago you and I were sitting in Rumpolmayer's, surrounded by sugar cakes, being smart.\"  \"They're doing that now in London except for the sugar cakes.\"  \"We shouldn't have been silent for a moment, and we should have enjoyed ourselves thoroughly . . .  I wonder--\"  \"It was our only standard, wasn't it?\"  \"And now we can sit over a cup of weak and nasty tea--without milk and not talk for effect. . . .  What's going to happen, Derek, to you and me afterwards?  We can never go back to it?\"  \"No--you can't put back the clock--and we've grown, Margaret, years and years older.  So have thousands of others--the boys up yonder, their people at home.  But what about the business train to Brighton, and the occupants thereof? . . .  Have they felt this war, except to make a bit more boodle out of it?\"  \"They're only a small minority.\"  \"Are they?  They're a damned powerful one.\"  He laughed a little bitterly.  \"And they're artificial--just like we were before the war.\"  \"That's why it's we who have got to do the rebuilding.  Even if it's only the rebuilding the house in our own little tiny circle, with simplicity and reality as the keystones. . . .  You see, if you get enough tiny circles sound and good, in time the others may follow. . . .\"  \"Dear lady, you've become very optimistic.\"  Vane's eyes smiled at her. \"Let's hope you're right.\"  He paused and looked at her quietly. \"Margaret.  I've never asked you before--but you're different now--so different.  Incidentally so am I.  What was it, that made you alter so suddenly?\"  Margaret rose to her feet, and shook her head.  \"I'll tell you some day, Derek, perhaps.  Not just now.  I must be getting back to the hospital.\"  \"Will you come out and have tea with me to-morrow?\"  For a few moments she looked at him as if undecided, and then suddenly she seemed to make up her mind.  \"All right,\" she said with a smile.  \"I'll come, I want to deal with this jaundice of yours.  One must live up to a professional reputation.\"     CHAPTER II  A hospital is much the same anywhere, and number 13 General at Etaples was no exception.  On each side of the big marquee ran a row of beds in perfect dressing.  The sheets were turned down on the design so ably portrayed in the War Office Sealed Pattern X.B.451.--\"Method of turning down sheets on Beds Hospital.\"  On \"Beds Barrack\" the method is slightly different and is just as ably shown on Sealed pattern X.B.452. During moments of intense depression one is apt to fear the war-winning properties of X.B.451 and 452 have not been sufficiently appreciated by an unintelligent public.  The period of strain incurred on entrance was over as far as Vane was concerned.  For the sixth time since leaving his battalion he had, in a confidential aside, informed a minion of the B.A.M.O. that he was a Wee Free Presbyterian Congregationalist; and for the sixth time the worthy recipient of this news had retired to consult War Office Sealed List of Religions A.F.31 to find out if he was entitled to be anything of the sort.  In each case the answer had been in the negative, and Vane had been entered as \"Other Denominations\" and regarded with suspicion.  One stout sergeant had even gone so far as to attempt to convert him to Unitarianism; another showed him the list, and asked him to take his choice.  In the bed next to him was a young Gunner subaltern, with most of his right leg shot away, and they talked spasmodically, in the intervals of trying to read month old magazines.  \"Wonderful sight,\" remarked the Gunner, interrupted for a moment in his story by the eternal thermometer.  \"Firing at 'em over open sights: shrapnel set at 0."]]]
