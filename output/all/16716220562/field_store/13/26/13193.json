Thomson and Hooker that this is the case with the _Butea parviflora_, one of the Menispermaceæ, and with some Dalbergias and other Leguminosæ. {37}  This power would be necessary for any species which had to ascend by twining the large trees of a tropical forest; otherwise they would hardly ever be able to reach the light.  In our temperate countries it would be injurious to the twining plants which die down every year if they were enabled to twine round trunks of trees, for they could not grow tall enough in a single season to reach the summit and gain the light.  By what means certain twining plants are adapted to ascend only thin stems, whilst others can twine round thicker ones, I do not know.  It appeared to me probable that twining plants with very long revolving shoots would be able to ascend thick supports; accordingly I placed _Ceropegia Gardnerii_ near a post 6 inches in diameter, but the shoots entirely failed to wind round it; their great length and power of movement merely aid them in finding a distant stem round which to twine. The _Sphærostemma marmoratum_ is a vigorous tropical twiner; and as it is a very slow revolver, I thought that this latter circumstance might help it in ascending a thick support; but though it was able to wind round a 6-inch post, it could do this only on the same level or plane, and did not form a spire and thus ascend.  As ferns differ so much in structure from phanerogamic plants, it may be worth while here to show that twining ferns do not differ in their habits from other twining plants.  In _Lygodium articulatum_ the two internodes of the stem (properly the rachis) which are first formed above the root-stock do not move; the third from the ground revolves, but at first very slowly.  This species is a slow revolver: but _L. scandens_ made five revolutions, each at the average rate of 5 hrs. 45 m.; and this represents fairly well the usual rate, taking quick and slow movers, amongst phanerogamic plants.  The rate was accelerated by increased temperature.  At each stage of growth only the two upper internodes revolved.  A line painted along the convex surface of a revolving internode becomes first lateral, then concave, then lateral and ultimately again convex.  Neither the internodes nor the petioles are irritable when rubbed.  The movement is in the usual direction, namely, in opposition to the course of the sun; and when the stem twines round a thin stick, it becomes twisted on its own axis in the same direction. After the young internodes have twined round a stick, their continued growth causes them to slip a little upwards.  If the stick be soon removed, they straighten themselves, and recommence revolving.  The extremities of the depending shoots turn upwards, and twine on themselves.  In all these respects we have complete identity with twining phanerogamic plants; and the above enumeration may serve as a summary of the leading characteristics of all twining plants.  The power of revolving depends on the general health and vigour of the plant, as has been laboriously shown by Palm.  But the movement of each separate internode is so independent of the others, that cutting off an upper one does not affect the revolutions of a lower one.  When, however, Dutrochet cut off two whole shoots of the Hop, and placed them in water, the movement was greatly retarded; for one revolved in 20 hrs. and the other in 23 hrs., whereas they ought to have revolved in between 2 hrs. and 2 hrs. 30 m.  Shoots of the Kidney-bean, cut off and placed in water, were similarly retarded, but in a less degree.  I have repeatedly observed that carrying a plant from the greenhouse to my room, or from one part to another of the greenhouse, always stopped the movement for a time; hence I conclude that plants in a state of nature and growing in exposed situations, would not make their revolutions during very stormy weather.  A decrease in temperature always caused a considerable retardation in the rate of revolution; but Dutrochet (tom. xvii. pp. 994, 996) has given such precise observations on this head with respect to the common pea that I need say nothing more.  When twining plants are placed near a window in a room, the light in some cases has a remarkable power (as was likewise observed by Dutrochet, p. 998, with the pea) on the revolving movement, but this differs in degree with different plants; thus _Ipomoea jucunda_ made a complete circle in 5 hrs. 30 m.; the semicircle from the light taking 4 hrs. 80 m., and that towards the light only 1 hr.  _Lonicera brachypoda_ revolved, in a reversed direction to the _Ipomoea_, in 8 hrs.; the semicircle from the light taking 5 hrs. 23 m., and that to the light only 2 hrs. 37 m.  From the rate of revolution in all the plants observed by me, being nearly the same during the night and the day, I infer that the action of the light is confined to retarding one semicircle and accelerating the other, so as not to modify greatly the rate of the whole revolution.  This action of the light is remarkable, when we reflect how little the leaves are developed on the young and thin revolving internodes.  It is all the more remarkable, as botanists believe (Mohl, p. 119) that twining plants are but little sensitive to the action of light.  I will conclude my account of twining plants by giving a few miscellaneous and curious cases.  With most twining plants all the branches, however many there may be, go on revolving together; but, according to Mohl (p. 4), only the lateral branches of _Tamus elephantipes_ twine, and not the main stem.  On the other hand, with a climbing species of Asparagus, the leading shoot alone, and not the branches, revolved and twined; but it should be stated that the plant was not growing vigorously.  My plants of _Combretum argenteum_ and _C. purpureum_ made numerous short healthy shoots; but they showed no signs of revolving, and I could not conceive how these plants could be climbers; but at last _C. argenteum_ put forth from the lower part of one of its main branches a thin shoot, 5 or 6 feet in length, differing greatly in appearance from the previous shoots, owing to its leaves being little developed, and this shoot revolved vigorously and twined.  So that this plant produces shoots of two kinds.  With _Periploca Græca_ (Palm, p. 43) the uppermost shoots alone twine.  Polygonum convolvulus twines only during the middle of the summer (Palm, p. 43, 94); and plants growing vigorously in the autumn show no inclination to climb.  The majority of Asclepiadaceæ are twiners; but _Asclepias nigra_ only “in fertiliori solo incipit scandere subvolubili caule” (Willdenow, quoted and confirmed by Palm, p. 41).  _Asclepias vincetoxicum_ does not regularly twine, but occasionally does so (Palm, p. 42; Mohl, p. 112) when growing under certain conditions.  So it is with two species of _Ceropegia_, as I hear from Prof.  Harvey, for these plants in their native dry South African home generally grow erect, from 6 inches to 2 feet in height,—a very few taller specimens showing some inclination to curve; but when cultivated near Dublin, they regularly twined up sticks 5 or 6 feet in height.  Most Convolvulaceæ are excellent twiners; but in South Africa _Ipomoea argyræoides_ almost always grows erect and compact, from about 12 to 18 inches in height, one specimen alone in Prof. Harvey’s collection showing an evident disposition to twine.  On the other hand, seedlings raised near Dublin twined up sticks above 8 feet in height.  These facts are remarkable; for there can hardly be a doubt that in the dryer provinces of South Africa these plants have propagated themselves for thousands of generations in an erect condition; and yet they have retained during this whole period the innate power of spontaneously revolving and twining, whenever their shoots become elongated under proper conditions of life.  Most of the species of _Phaseolus_ are twiners; but certain varieties of the _P. multiflorus_ produce (Léon, p. 681) two kinds of shoots, some upright and thick, and others thin and twining.  I have seen striking instances of this curious case of variability in “Fulmer’s dwarf forcing-bean,” which occasionally produced a single long twining shoot.  _Solanum dulcamara_ is one of the feeblest and poorest of twiners: it may often be seen growing as an upright bush, and when growing in the midst of a thicket merely scrambles up between the branches without twining; but when, according to Dutrochet (tom. xix. p. 299), it grows near a thin and flexible support, such as the stem of a nettle, it twines round it. I placed sticks round several plants, and vertically stretched strings close to others, and the strings alone were ascended by twining.  The stem twines indifferently to the right or left.  Some others species of Solanum, and of another genus, viz. _Habrothamnus_, belonging to the same family, are described in horticultural works as twining plants, but they seem to possess this faculty in a very feeble degree.  We may suspect that the species of these two genera have as yet only partially acquired the habit of twining.  On the other hand with _Tecoma radicans_, a member of a family abounding with twiners and tendril-bearers, but which climbs, like the ivy, by the aid of rootlets, we may suspect that a former habit of twining has been lost, for the stem exhibited slight irregular movements which could hardly be accounted for by changes in the action of the light.  There is no difficulty in understanding how a spirally twining plant could graduate into a simple root-climber; for the young internodes of _Bignonia Tweedyana_ and of _Hoya carnosa_ revolve and twine, but likewise emit rootlets which adhere to any fitting surface, so that the loss of twining would be no great disadvantage and in some respects an advantage to these species, as they would then ascend their supports in a more direct line. {44}"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2485"],["title","The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants (#7)"],["body"," II. LEAF-CLIMBERS.   Plants which climb by the aid of spontaneously revolving and sensitive petioles—_Clematis_—_Tropæolum_—_Maurandia_, flower-peduncles moving spontaneously and sensitive to a touch—_Rhodochiton_—_Lophospermum_—internodes sensitive—_Solanum_, thickening of the clasped petioles—_Fumaria_—_Adlumia_—Plants which climb by the aid of their produced midribs—_Gloriosa_—_Flagellaria_—_Nepenthes_—Summary on leaf-climbers.  WE now come to our second class of climbing plants, namely, those which ascend by the aid of irritable or sensitive organs.  For convenience’ sake the plants in this class have been grouped under two sub-divisions, namely, leaf-climbers, or those which retain their leaves in a functional condition, and tendril-bearers.  But these sub-divisions graduate into each other, as we shall see under Corydalis and the Gloriosa lily.  It has long been observed that several plants climb by the aid of their leaves, either by their petioles (foot-stalks) or by their produced midribs; but beyond this simple fact they have not been described.  Palm and Mohl class these plants with those which bear tendrils; but as a leaf is generally a defined object, the present classification, though artificial, has at least some advantages.  Leaf-climbers are, moreover, intermediate in many respects between twiners and tendril-bearers.  Eight species of _Clematis_ and seven of _Tropæolum_ were observed, in order to see what amount of difference in the manner of climbing existed within the same genus; and the differences are considerable.  CLEMATIS.—_C. glandulosa_.—The thin upper internodes revolve, moving against the course of the sun, precisely like those of a true twiner, at an average rate, judging from three revolutions, of 3 hrs. 48 m.  The leading shoot immediately twined round a stick placed near it; but, after making an open spire of only one turn and a half, it ascended for a short space straight, and then reversed its course and wound two turns in an opposite direction.  This was rendered possible by the straight piece between the opposed spires having become rigid.  The simple, broad, ovate leaves of this tropical species, with their short thick petioles, seem but ill-fitted for any movement; and whilst twining up a vertical stick, no use is made of them.  Nevertheless, if the footstalk of a young leaf be rubbed with a thin twig a few times on any side, it will in the course of a few hours bend to that side; afterwards becoming straight again. The under side seemed to be the most sensitive; but the sensitiveness or irritability is slight compared to that which we shall meet with in some of the following species; thus, a loop of string, weighing 1.64 grain (106.2 mg.) and hanging for some days on a young footstalk, produced a scarcely perceptible effect.  A sketch is here given of two young leaves which had naturally caught hold of two thin branches.  A forked twig placed so as to press lightly on the under side of a young footstalk caused it, in 12 hrs., to bend greatly, and ultimately to such an extent that the leaf passed to the opposite side of the stem; the forked stick having been removed, the leaf slowly recovered its former position.   [Picture: Fig. 1.  Clematis glandulosa.  With two young leaves clasping              two twigs, with the clasping portions thickened]  The young leaves spontaneously and gradually change their position: when first developed the petioles are upturned and parallel to the stem; they then slowly bend downwards, remaining for a short time at right angles to the stem, and then become so much arched downwards that the blade of the leaf points to the ground with its tip curled inwards, so that the whole petiole and leaf together form a hook.  They are thus enabled to catch hold of any twig with which they may be brought into contact by the revolving movement of the internodes.  If this does not happen, they retain their hooked shape for a considerable time, and then bending upwards reassume their original upturned position, which is preserved ever afterwards.  The petioles which have clasped any object soon become much thickened and strengthened, as may be seen in the drawing.  _Clematis montana_.—The long, thin petioles of the leaves, whilst young, are sensitive, and when lightly rubbed bend to the rubbed side, subsequently becoming straight.  They are far more sensitive than the petioles of _C. glandulosa_; for a loop of thread weighing a quarter of a grain (16.2 mg.) caused them to bend; a loop weighing only one-eighth of a grain (8.1 mg.) sometimes acted and sometimes did not act.  The sensitiveness extends from the blade of the leaf to the stem.  I may here state that I ascertained in all cases the weights of the string and thread used by carefully weighing 50 inches in a chemical balance, and then cutting off measured lengths.  The main petiole carries three leaflets; but their short, sub-petioles are not sensitive.  A young, inclined shoot (the plant being in the greenhouse) made a large circle opposed to the course of the sun in 4 hrs. 20 m., but the next day, being very cold, the time was 5 hrs. 10 m.  A stick placed near a revolving stem was soon struck by the petioles which stand out at right angles, and the revolving movement was thus arrested.  The petioles then began, being excited by the contact, to slowly wind round the stick.  When the stick was thin, a petiole sometimes wound twice round it.  The opposite leaf was in no way affected.  The attitude assumed by the stem after the petiole had clasped the stick, was that of a man standing by a column, who throws his arm horizontally round it.  With respect to the stem’s power of twining, some remarks will be made under _C. calycina_.  _Clematis Sieboldi_.—A shoot made three revolutions against the sun at an average rate of 3 hrs. 11 m.  The power of twining is like that of the last species.  Its leaves are nearly similar in structure and in function, excepting that the sub-petioles of the lateral and terminal leaflets are sensitive.  A loop of thread, weighing one-eighth of a grain, acted on the main petiole, but not until two or three days had elapsed.  The leaves have the remarkable habit of spontaneously revolving, generally in vertical ellipses, in the same manner, but in a less degree, as will be described under _C. microphylla_.  _Clematis calycina_.—The young shoots are thin and flexible: one revolved, describing a broad oval, in 5 hrs. 30 m., and another in 6 hrs. 12 m.  They followed the course of the sun; but the course, if observed long enough, would probably be found to vary in this species, as well as in all the others of the genus.  It is a rather better twiner than the two last species: the stem sometimes made two spiral turns round a thin stick, if free from twigs; it then ran straight up for a space, and reversing its course took one or two turns in an opposite direction. This reversal of the spire occurred in all the foregoing species.  The leaves are so small compared with those of most of the other species, that the petioles at first seem ill-adapted for clasping.  Nevertheless, the main service of the revolving movement is to bring them into contact with surrounding objects, which are slowly but securely seized.  The young petioles, which alone are sensitive, have their ends bowed a little downwards, so as to be in a slight degree hooked; ultimately the whole leaf, if it catches nothing, becomes level.  I gently rubbed with a thin twig the lower surfaces of two young petioles; and in 2 hrs. 30 m. they were slightly curved downwards; in 5 hrs., after being rubbed, the end of one was bent completely back, parallel to the basal portion; in 4 hrs. subsequently it became nearly straight again.  To show how sensitive the young petioles are, I may mention that I just touched the under sides of two with a little water-colour, which when dry formed an excessively thin and minute crust; but this sufficed in 24 hrs. to cause both to bend downwards.  Whilst the plant is young, each leaf consists of three divided leaflets, which barely have distinct petioles, and these are not sensitive; but when the plant is well grown, the petioles of the two lateral and terminal leaflets are of considerable length, and become sensitive so as to be capable of clasping an object in any direction.  When a petiole has clasped a twig, it undergoes some remarkable changes, which may be observed with the other species, but in a less strongly marked manner, and will here be described once for all.  The clasped petiole in the course of two or three days swells greatly, and ultimately becomes nearly twice as thick as the opposite one which has clasped nothing.  When thin transverse slices of the two are placed under the microscope their difference is conspicuous: the side of the petiole which has been in contact with the support, is formed of a layer of colourless cells with their longer axes directed from the centre, and these are very much larger than the corresponding cells in the opposite or unchanged petiole; the central cells, also, are in some degree enlarged, and the whole is much indurated.  The exterior surface generally becomes bright red.  But a far greater change takes place in the nature of the tissues than that which is visible: the petiole of the unclasped leaf is flexible and can be snapped easily, whereas the clasped one acquires an extraordinary degree of toughness and rigidity, so that considerable force is required to pull it into pieces.  With this change, great durability is probably acquired; at least this is the case with the clasped petioles of _Clematis vitalba_.  The meaning of these changes is obvious, namely, that the petioles may firmly and durably support the stem.  _Clematis microphylla_, var. _leptophylla_.—The long and thin internodes of this Australian species revolve sometimes in one direction and sometimes in an opposite one, describing long, narrow, irregular ellipses or large"]]]
