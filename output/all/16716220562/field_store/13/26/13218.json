Dorcas, the adopted daughter, was eighteen. They had always been a happy family; and all the young people called Noah and his wife, who treated them as their own, father and mother.  The squadron had been on detached duty. Their first service was to protect a railroad bridge which Captain Titus's company and a troop of Texan cavalry had been sent to destroy in order to prevent the transportation of Union forces to Bowling Green. The Texans were thoroughly defeated, and the Home Guards surrounded, beaten, and captured. The major's brother was sent with them to the North, where he had the opportunity to repent and get sober. His two sons, Alexander and Orlando, half starved and disgusted, had fled from Bowling Green; and when their mother and sisters went back to the North, the two boys had enlisted in the Riverlawn Cavalry.  The next service of the squadron was in repressing guerilla outrages; and they took part in the small battle of Munfordsville. When it was known that the Confederates were marching into Kentucky from the south and east, the squadron was sent to take part in the operations in this quarter. The command arrived at Columbia, from which Major Lyon sent the first company towards Mill Springs, where the enemy were reported to be, by the way of Liberty and Miltonville. The second company were to proceed by Millersville and Jamestown, with the same objective point in view.     CHAPTER II  PREPARATIONS FOR DECISIVE ACTION   Captain Gordon was in command of the first company of the Riverlawn Cavalry. He was an excellent officer, and had been sent down to organize the company, and Major Lyon wished him to take the command of the battalion; but he insisted that the planter should have that position. The wealthy and influential men of the county, among whom the major was honored and respected, persuaded him to accept; and he had finally done so, Captain Gordon being the most strenuous that he should do so.  Tom Belthorpe, the son of a planter residing near Riverlawn, was the first lieutenant. Deck Lyon, as he had always been called by everybody but his father, had proved to be one of \"the bravest of the brave,\" and to have excellent judgment for a young man of eighteen. He was a universal favorite throughout the squadron. In the battles with the guerillas at Greeltop and Plain Hill, Deck had greatly distinguished himself. In the first of these actions, Lieutenant Gilder of the first company had been killed, and his place was vacant. Among themselves the company signed a paper in favor of the promotion of Deck to the grade of lieutenant.  Major Lyon had no knowledge of this movement on the part of the men, or perhaps he would have interfered to prevent its success; but the paper went to higher authority than he, indorsed by Captain Gordon and Lieutenant Belthorpe; and when the commission came it was as much of a surprise to the father as to the son.  Wearing his new uniform, with shoulder-straps, he had fought as bravely as ever at Munfordsville, and had led his platoon with skill and discretion. Though in an attack of cavalry he led his men into action, he was not again charged with recklessness, as he had been in the action at the Cross Roads, as the fight at the other railroad bridge was called. He conducted himself with dignity in his new position, and all of a sudden he seemed to forget that he was only a boy.  The first company had marched down the road towards the South not more than three miles, before the forward movement was arrested by a messenger, coming in through a path from the road to Breedings with the information that a guerilla or foraging party were approaching a hamlet, evidently with the intention of plundering the houses and out-buildings. It was known that the Confederate forces, who had established and fortified themselves in and around Mill Springs, were destitute of supplies. They were in a hungry or half-starved condition, and their food was obtained mostly by foraging parties sent a considerable distance from their camps.  Major Lyon had divided his squadron at Columbia in order to check the operations of these bodies, some of which were said to be regular partisan bands, robbing and plundering for their own benefit, and not authorized to procure supplies for the Southern army. Captain Gordon had been instructed to be on the lookout for these marauders. The messenger said the party approaching the Breedings road consisted of about thirty mounted men. He decided to send Lieutenant Belthorpe's platoon to attack them, accompanying the force himself, for he could not remain inactive when there was fighting to be done.  The captain had not expected to meet an enemy in the direction of Breedings; but he had received an intimation that trouble might be expected in the region between Columbia and Harrison, though nothing was known in regard to such a raid. The country was cut up by cross-roads, not much more than mere paths, on which several plantations were located, making the territory very favorable to the operations of guerillas or foragers.  \"Lieutenant Lyon, I am going with Belthorpe's platoon, for I am more likely to be needed where he goes than where you go,\" said Captain Gordon, riding up to the young officer. \"You will continue on this road till you come to Millersville, and wait there until I join you.\"  \"At Millersville,\" repeated Deck. \"I have studied the map, and I know just where it is.\"  \"I talked with a planter just this side of Columbia, who gave me a hint that marauding parties had a fine chance to operate in the country that will be on your left as you proceed,\" continued the commander of the company. \"If you hear firing, or see anything that looks like a fire, you will attend to the matter.\"  \"Of course I should do so,\" added Deck.  \"I want you to hurry up the baggage wagons, for they are what makes our progress so slow. I need hardly warn you to be prudent, and not expose yourself unnecessarily to a superior force. Don't leave your wagons too far in your rear, for they contain just what the enemy want most. Now, relying as much upon your discretion as your bravery, continue on your march to Millersville,\" the captain concluded, as he galloped after the first platoon, which had left the road a few minutes before.  Lieutenant Lyon saluted his superior, and then, conscious for the first time in his life that he had been assigned to an independent command, though it was likely to be of brief duration, he sent for the two sergeants of his platoon, and sent them forward as scouts, with two privates to assist them.  \"Platoon--attention! Forward--march!\" called the young officer, when he had sent the scouts ahead with orders to keep a sharp lookout on both sides, especially on the left.  Life Knox obeyed his orders to the letter, and made the left his particular study; and when he saw something like signs of a plantation in the distance, he dismounted, got over the fence, moving in a direction to satisfy himself that no foragers were in sight. As he was advancing towards the plantation, Grace Morgan came out of a bushy knoll and confronted him. After the interview with her, he had carried the treasure-chest to the road. He had sent the two privates to the left; and as Sergeant Fronklyn galloped off to hurry up the platoon, they rode down the road, and halted in front of him. One of these soldiers was Deck's cousin, Alick Lyon.  \"Have you seen or heard anything crooked, Lyon?\" asked the chief scout.  \"Not a thing, Sergeant; I thought I heard voices one time, but I could make nothing of them. I saw this woman walking across a cornfield;\" and he pointed at Grace.  \"I saw him too; but I was afraid of him,\" added the young woman.  \"Wasn't you afeerd of me?\" asked the sergeant, with a smile on his wiry face.  \"No, I was not; besides, I was tired out with the load I carried, and I felt as though I could go no farther.\"  \"How far from here does Colonel Halliburn live?\" asked Life.  \"It is more than a mile from this road.\"  \"I reckon this box will not be very safe with him, for there's more gorillas runnin' loose about this country than there is skippers in an old cheese. Kin you ride horseback, Grace?\"  \"Every Kentucky girl can ride horseback,\" replied she, with the first smile he had yet seen on her face, perhaps because she expected to be sent to Colonel Halliburn's mansion.  \"But we hain't got no side-saddle,\" suggested Life.  \"I can get along very well on any saddle; and I have ridden a spirited animal without any saddle,\" said the lady.  \"Perhaps you would like to enlist in our company,\" added the sergeant, with a heavy chuckle.  \"I should like it first-rate, if it could be allowed,\" replied Grace, with energy, while her eyes snapped at the idea.  \"I shall have to leave that matter to Major Lyon. But here comes the platoon,\" said Life, as thirty-five or forty men dashed down the road, led by Lieutenant Lyon.  \"Where are the enemy, Sergeant?\" demanded the officer, as he reined in his panting steed some distance in advance of his men, and in front of Life and Grace Morgan.  \"Half a mile or more to the east of where we stand,\" replied the scout.  \"Is there a road or path over there?\" inquired Deck.  \"This is Grace Morgan, and she can tell you all about it, for she brought me the news,\" answered Life, presenting the young woman.  The lieutenant raised his cap and bowed politely to the Kentucky damsel; and he could not help observing that she was a very pretty girl, though he had no time to indulge in the phrases of gallantry, even if his fealty to Miss Kate Belthorpe had permitted him to do so. This fair young lady was the sister of Lieutenant Belthorpe, and Deck had made her acquaintance on the evening of the \"Battle of Riverlawn,\" when he had rescued her from the grasp of a ruffian. He was too young to be absolutely in love with the maiden, though he believed she was the prettiest girl in the State of Kentucky."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24866"],["title","A Lieutenant at Eighteen (#3)"],["body"," Morgan repeated the story she had told the sergeant.  \"How did you escape from the ruffians?\" asked Deck.  \"We saw them coming from the direction of Miltonville; and Mr. Halliburn, who is my guardian, sent me to carry his valuables to the mansion of his brother, about a mile and a half from his own house,\" replied Grace, by this time quite reassured by the presence of the soldiers.  \"Have you the valuables now?\"  \"They are in a box,\" she replied, pointing to the treasure-chest. \"It contains a good deal of money in gold and silver, and it is so heavy that I could not carry it any farther, for I was faint and tired out.\"  \"I will send two of my men to see you safely to the house where you are going,\" continued the lieutenant, as he glanced at his platoon, which had halted in the road near the place where the maiden stood. \"Life, name two of your trustiest men,\" he added in a low tone to the sergeant.  \"Fronklyn and Sandy Lyon,\" responded Life promptly. \"The lady can ride on an army saddle, or even without any saddle.\"  \"Send the men you mention; as our spare horses are with the baggage-wagons, you can wait till they come up. Is there any road, Miss Morgan, across these fields to your guardian's mansion?\" added Deck, willing that his men should rest for a few minutes, for he was not inclined to fight his first battle, while in command, without fully understanding the situation.  \"There is a rough road across the fields and through the woods to the mansion; but it is very soft and muddy,\" replied Grace.  \"There comes a man across the field!\" exclaimed Life.  \"That is Win Milton!\" cried the maiden, her face suffused with a blush, as though she supposed all the listeners understood her relations to the young man, who was now running with all the speed of his legs across the field.  He was a stalwart fellow, and the maiden's crimson cheeks betrayed the whole story. He was well dressed, and his face was intelligent and expressive.  \"I am so glad you have come, Win,\" ejaculated the blushing beauty, as the young man grasped her offered hands. \"What is the news from the house?\"  \"The ruffians are guerillas, and they are trying to make Mr. Halliburn give up his money, but he declared that he had not a dollar in the house; yet he found time to tell me that you had taken the chest containing it to his brother's,\" replied Winfield Milton, which was his full name. \"The robbers were ransacking the house in search of the money or other valuables; and Mr. Halliburn insisted that I should follow you, for he was alarmed in regard to your safety.\"  \"Mr. Win--I have not heard your name yet,\" interposed the lieutenant.  \"This is Mr. Winfield Milton, of Miltonville,\" added Grace, with another blush.  \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Milton, for you can be of service to me. I suppose you are acquainted with this locality?\" replied Deck.  \"Born and raised in these parts, Captain.\"  \"Lieutenant Lyon, if you please. I have already detailed two of my men to conduct Miss Morgan to the mansion where she wishes to go, for I desire to employ you as my guide, if the lady will consent,\" continued Deck.  \"Certainly I will consent!\" exclaimed Grace. \"I would guide you myself, if I had not to take care of the treasure-chest.\"  \"I shall be very glad to serve you, Lieutenant,\" added Win.  Although not ten minutes had elapsed since the arrival of the officer in command, the baggage wagons were in sight. Men were sent to them for two of the extra horses, saddled for immediate use. One of them was given to Miss Morgan, Sergeant Fronklyn received the treasure-chest on his horse, and Sandy Lyon was sent on ahead to scout the path. The lady seated herself on the army saddle, and the party moved off as rapidly as the muddy road would permit.     CHAPTER III  THE LIEUTENANT BAGS HIS GAME   The Riverlawn Cavalry had lost a number of its men, who had been killed in the several actions in which it had been engaged, and a greater number had been disabled by wounds; though both companies had been recruited up to their full standard. The squadron was so popular that more than twenty had applied to enlist after its ranks were full. Deck had, therefore, his full quota, and two more.  \"The other horse is for you, Mr. Milton,\" said the lieutenant, when he was ready to move on to the mansion invested by the ruffians.  \"Thank you, Lieutenant Lyon; I left my horse a mile beyond Mr. Halliburn's, when I learned that the guerillas were going in that direction,\" replied the guide. \"I am satisfied, now that Grace is safe.\"  \"There is another band of guerillas or foragers in the direction of Breedings; but the first platoon of our company has gone over to give them a reception, and I don't believe any of them will get as far south as the house to which Miss Morgan is going,\" Deck explained.  \"I hope not, for I am very anxious about Grace,\" added the guide.  \"She is a very attractive young lady,\" suggested Deck.  \"Which makes her peril all the greater,\" replied her intended, for such he was, as they entered a forest of black walnut. \"We have tried to persuade her to go to her uncle's house in Springfield, Ohio; but she refuses to leave her guardian, who has been a father to her from her childhood. I shall get my horse, if the ruffians have not stolen him, and hasten to Colonel Halliburn's, as soon as you have disposed of these villains.\"  \"I shall try to bag the whole of them,\" said Deck. \"But so many prisoners would be a nuisance to me.\"  \"There is a loyal Home Guard in Millersville, if the Confederates have not scattered them; and they would take care of your prisoners,\" suggested the guide.  \"Now, Mr. Milton,\"--  \"Call me Win, as everybody else does, and that will save time,\" interposed the young man.  \"As you please, Win; the name is shorter, and perhaps you will recognize it more readily because it is more familiar to you than one with a handle to it. Now, I want to know something more about the surroundings of Mr. Halliburn's mansion. I wonder that this gentleman is not a colonel, like most people of any importance in this State.\"  \"He was formerly a clergyman, and sometimes officiates now on an emergency. That fact saved him from any military infliction. Then his brother is a real colonel, and two of the same title would have made confusion in talking about them,\" the guide explained.  The mud was so deep that no great speed could be made on the march, and the guerillas were not likely to complete their mission for some hours, for they seldom left a plundered house without requiring a meal to be provided for them. Still, the lieutenant pushed on with all practicable haste.  \"How does the land lie about the house?\" asked Deck.  \"All the land cultivated on the plantation, which contains over a thousand acres, is on the east side of the mansion. Most of the ground on the west of it is in walnut; for in the dry season it is easily hauled to the Cumberland River, and carried to a market during high water. It is a profitable crop to the planter.\"  \"Does the walnut grove reach as far as the mansion?\"  \"Very nearly. There is a small grove south of the house, and a wooded hill to the north-east of it.\"  \"Very well; I think I have got the idea of it,\" replied Deck, as he relapsed into silence to study his plan.  Though he had a great deal of confidence in himself, he was fully conscious of the responsibility which rested upon him. Probably if Captain Gordon had suspected that the lieutenant at eighteen would encounter an enemy, he would have come with the platoon himself, though he had quite as much confidence in Deck as in Tom Belthorpe. But the other division was reasonably sure to engage an enemy, and doubtless this consideration had decided the question as to which he should accompany.  \"This wood extends around to the north side of the mansion, if I understand the situation,\" said Deck, when he had arranged the attack in his own mind.  \"Precisely so,\" replied the guide.  \"That is on our left; how is it on the right, Win?\"  \"You come out of the woods into a cornfield; beyond this is a low hill, and beyond it is a grove, where the family walk in warm weather.\"  \"How far are we from the mansion now?\"  \"Something more than a hundred rods.\"  \"Platoon--halt!\" said the lieutenant, suddenly whirling his horse about as on a pivot. \"Sergeant Knox!\"  Life rode up to him, saluted, and waited for further orders.  \"With fifteen men you will move to the left through the woods till you come to the mansion now directly in front of us. Move without noise, and halt your force as near the house as you can without being seen by the enemy, who are too busy to notice anything just now. When the bugle sounds the 'Advance,' you will march at a gallop to the east side of the house. Do you understand me, Life?\" said Deck, speaking very clearly, but in a low tone.  \"I'll bet I do; shall I repeat the orders?\" replied the sergeant.  \"It is not necessary.\"  Deck then directed Corporal Tilford, another non-commissioned officer, to take twelve men and proceed to the right, through the cornfield, concealing himself behind the hill mentioned by Win, and halt in the grove. At the same signal, a second time given, the corporal was to march his men in haste to the front of the mansion. The two detachments went to the left and the right as directed, and the lieutenant continued the march directly to his destination. The stable of the plantation was the first building they saw, for the west side of the mansion was concealed by a dozen lofty trees. If the ruffians were still in the house, they appeared to have taken no precautions to guard against a surprise: for there was no sentinel, and no person could be seen near the mansion.  \"Platoon--halt!\" said Deck, when he had led his men into the shelter of the trees; but he spoke in a very low tone, for he was not more than fifty feet from the mansion.  Taking the bugler and the guide with him, he crept carefully around the principal building, halting at the corner. From"]]]
