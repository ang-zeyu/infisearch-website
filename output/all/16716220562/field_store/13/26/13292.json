I think I'll take a stroll up through the Green Forest and have a look around.\"  With that, off Old Man Coyote started. But he was too sly and crafty to go straight to the Green Forest. He pretended to hunt around over the Green Meadows just as he usually did, all the time working nearer and nearer to the Green Forest. When he reached the edge of it, he slipped in among the trees, and when he felt that no one was likely to see him, he began to run this way and that way with his nose to the ground.  \"Ha!\" he exclaimed presently, \"Reddy Fox has been this way lately.\"  Pretty soon he found another trail. \"So,\" said he, \"Peter Rabbit has been over here a good deal of late, and his trail goes in the same direction as that of Reddy Fox. I guess all I have to do now is to follow Peter's trail, and it will lead me to what I want to find out.\"  So Old Man Coyote followed Peter's trail, and he presently came to the pond of Paddy the Beaver. \"Ha!\" said he, as he looked out and saw Paddy's new  house. \"So there is a newcomer to the Green Forest! I have always heard that Beaver is very good eating. My stomach begins to feel empty this very minute.\" His mouth began to water, and a fierce, hungry look shone in his eyes.  It was just then that Sammy Jay saw him and began to scream at the top of his lungs so that Paddy the Beaver over in his house heard him. Old Man Coyote knew that it was of no use to stay longer with Sammy Jay about, so he took a hasty look at the pond and found where Paddy came ashore to cut his food. Then, shaking his fist at Sammy Jay, he started straight back for the Green Meadows. \"I'll just pay a visit here in the night,\" said he, \"and give Mr. Beaver a surprise while he is at work.\"  But with all his craft, Old Man Coyote didn't notice that he left a footprint in the mud.    CHAPTER XVII  Old Man Coyote is Disappointed.  Old Man Coyote lay stretched out in his favorite napping place on the Green Meadows. He was thinking of what he had found out up in the Green Forest that morning--that Paddy the Beaver was living there. Old Man Coyote's thoughts seemed very pleasant to himself, though really they were very dreadful thoughts. You see, he was thinking how easy it was going to be to catch Paddy the Beaver, and what a splendid meal he would make. He licked his chops at the thought.  \"He doesn't know I know he's here,\" thought Old Man Coyote. \"In fact, I don't believe heaven knows that I am anywhere around. Of course he won't be watching for me. He cuts  his trees at night, so all I will have to do is to hide right close by where he is at work, and he'll walk right into my mouth. Sammy Jay knows I was up there this morning, but Sammy sleeps at night, so he will not give the alarm. My, my, how good that Beaver will taste!\" He licked his chops once more, then yawned and closed his eyes for a nap.  Old Man Coyote waited until jolly, round red Mr. Sun had gone to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows had crept out across the Green Meadows. Then, keeping in the blackest of them, and looking very much like a shadow of himself, he slipped into the Green Forest. It was dark in there, and he made straight for Paddy's new pond, trotting along swiftly without making a sound. When he was near the aspen trees which he knew Paddy was planning to cut, he crept forward very slowly and carefully. Everything was still as still could be.  \"Good!\" thought Old Man Coyote. \"I am here first, and now all I need do is to hide and wait for Paddy to come ashore.\"  So he stretched himself flat behind some brush close beside the little path Paddy had made up from the edge of the water and waited. It was very still, so still that it seemed almost as if he could hear his heart beat. He could see the little stars twinkling in the sky and their own reflections twinkling back at them from the water of Paddy's pond. Old Man Coyote waited and waited. He is very patient when there is something to gain by it. For such a splendid dinner as Paddy the Beaver would make, he felt that he could well afford to be patient. So he waited and waited, and everything was as still as if no living thing but the trees where there. Even the trees seemed to be asleep.  At last, after a long, long time, he heard just the faintest splash. He pricked up his ears and peeped out on the pond with the hungriest look in his yellow eyes. There was a little line of silver coming straight toward him. He knew that it was made by Paddy the Beaver swimming. Nearer and nearer it drew. Old Man Coyote chuckled way down deep inside, without making a sound. He could see Paddy's head now, and Paddy was coming straight in, as if he hadn't a fear in the world.  Almost to the edge of the pond swam Paddy. Then he stopped. In a few minutes he began to swim again, but this time it was back in the direction of his house, and he seemed to be carrying something. It was one of the little food logs he had cut that day, and he was taking it out to his storehouse. Then back he came for another. And so he kept on, never once coming ashore. Old Man Coyote waited until Paddy had carried the last log to his storehouse and then, with a loud whack on the water with his broad tail, had dived and disappeared in his house.  Then Old Man Coyote arose and started elsewhere to look for his dinner, and in his heart was bitter disappointment.    CHAPTER XVIII  Old Man Coyote Tries Another Plan.  For three nights Old Man Coyote had stolen up through the green Forest with the coming of the Black Shadows and had hidden among the aspen trees where Paddy the Beaver cut his food, and for three nights Paddy had failed to come ashore. Each night he had seemed to have enough food logs in the water to keep him busy without cutting more. Old Man Coyote lay there, and the hungry look in his eyes changed to one of doubt and then to suspicion. Could it be that Paddy the Beaver was smarter than he thought? It began to look very much as if Paddy knew perfectly well that he was hiding there each night. Yes, Sir, that's the way it looked. For three nights Paddy hadn't cut a single tree, and yet each night he had plenty of food logs ready to take to his storehouse in the pond.  \"That means that he comes ashore in the daytime and cuts his trees,\" thought Old Man Coyote as, tired and with black anger in his heart, he trotted home the third night. \"He couldn't have found out about me himself; he isn't smart enough. It must be that someone has told him. And nobody knows that I have been over there but Sammy Jay. It must be he who has been the tattletale. I think I'll visit Paddy by daylight tomorrow, and then we'll see!\"  Now the trouble with some smart people is that they are never able to believe that others may be as smart as they. Old Man Coyote didn't know that the first time he had visited Paddy's pond he had left behind him a footprint in a little patch of soft mud. If he had known it, he wouldn't have believed that Paddy would be smart enough to guess what that footprint meant. So Old Man coyote laid all the blame at the door of Sammy Jay, and that very morning, when Sammy came flying over the Green Meadows, Old Man Coyote accused him of being a tattletale and threatened the most dreadful things to Sammy if ever he caught him.  Now Sammy had flown down to the green Meadows to tell Old Man Coyote how Paddy was doing all his work on land in the daytime. But when Old Man Coyote began to call him a tattletale and accuse him of having warned Paddy, and to threaten dreadful things, he straightway forgot all his anger at Paddy and turned it all on Old Man Coyote. He called him everything he could think of, and this was a great deal, for Sammy has a wicked tongue. When he hadn't any breath left, he flew over to the Green Forest, and there he hid where he could watch all that was going on.  That afternoon Old Man Coyote tried his new plan. He slipped into the Green Forest, looking this way and that way to be sure that no one saw him. Then very, very softly, he crept up through the Green Forest toward the pond of Paddy the Beaver. As he drew near, he heard a crash, and it make him smile. He knew what it meant. It meant that Paddy was at work cutting down trees. With his stomach almost on the ground, he crept forward little by little, little by little, taking the greatest care not to rustle so much as a leaf. Presently he reached a place where he could see the aspen trees, and there, sure enough, was Paddy, sitting up on his hind legs and hard at work cutting another tree.  Old Man Coyote lay down for a few minutes to watch. Then he wriggled a little nearer. Slowly and carefully he drew his legs under him and made ready for a rush. Paddy the Beaver was his at last! At just that very minute a harsh scream rang out right over his head:  \"Thief! thief! thief!\"  It was Sammy Jay, who had followed him all the way. Paddy the Beaver didn't stop to even look around. He knew what that meant, and he scrambled down his little path to the water as he never had scrambled before. And as he dived with a great splash, Old Man Coyote landed with a great jump on the very edge of the pond.    CHAPTER XIX  Paddy and Sammy Jay Become Friends.  Paddy the Beaver floated in his pond and grinned in the most provoking way at Old Man Coyote, who had so nearly caught him. Old Man Coyote fairly danced with anger on the bank. He had felt so sure of Paddy that time that it was hard work to believe that Paddy had really gotten away from him. He bared his long, cruel teeth, and he looked very fierce and ugly.  \"Come on in; the water's fine!\" called Paddy.  Now, of course this wasn't a nice thing for Paddy to do, for it only made Old Man Coyote all the angrier. You see, Paddy knew perfectly well that he was absolutely safe, and he just couldn't resist the temptation to say some unkind things. He had had to be on the watch for days"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2493"],["title","The Adventures of Paddy the Beaver (#7)"],["body","he should be caught, and so he hadn't been able to work quite so well as he could have done with nothing to fear, and he still had a lot of preparations to make for winter. So he told Old Man Coyote just what he thought of him, and that he wasn't as smart as he thought he was or he never would have left a foot print in the mud to give him away.  When Sammy Jay, who was listening and chuckling as he listened, heard that, he flew down where he would be just out of reach of Old Man Coyote, and then he just turned that tongue of his loose, and you know that some people say that Sammy's tongue is hung in the middle and wags at both ends. Of course this isn't really so, but when he gets to abusing people it seems as if it must be true. He called Old Man Coyote every bad name he could think of. He called him a sneak, a thief, a coward, a bully, and a lot of other things.  \"You said I had warned Paddy that you were trying to catch him and that was why you failed to find him at work at night, and all the time you had warned him yourself!\" screamed Sammy. \"I used to think that you were smart, but I know better now. Paddy is twice as smart as you are.       \"Mr. Coyote is every so sly;       Mr. Coyote is clever and spry;       If you believe all you hear.        Mr. Coyote is naught of the kind;       Mr. Coyote is stupid and blind;       He can't catch a flea on his ear.\"  Paddy the Beaver laughed till the tears came at Sammy's foolish verse, but it made Old Man Coyote angrier than ever. He was angry with Paddy for escaping from him, and he was angry with Sammy, terribly angry, and the worst of it was he couldn't catch either one, for one was at home in the water and the other was at home in the air and he couldn't follow in either place. Finally he saw it was of no use to stay there to be laughed at, so, muttering and grumbling, he started for the Green Meadows.  As soon as he was out of sight Paddy turned to Sammy Jay.  \"Mr. Jay,\" said he, knowing how it pleased Sammy to be called mister. \"Mr. Jay, you have done me a mighty good turn today, and I am not going to forget it. You can call me what you please and scream at me all you please, but you won't get any satisfaction out of it, because I simply won't get angry. I will say to myself, 'Mr. Jay saved my life the other day,' and then I won't mind your tongue.\"  Now this made Sammy feel very proud and very happy. You know it is very seldom that he hears anything nice said of him. He flew down on the stump of one of the trees Paddy had cut. \"Let's be friends,\" said he.  \"With all my heart!\" replied Paddy.    CHAPTER XX  Sammy Jay Offers To Help Paddy.  Paddy sat looking thoughtfully at the aspen trees he would have to cut to complete his store of food for the winter. All those near the edge of his pond had been cut. The others were scattered about some little distance away. \"I don't know,\" said Paddy out loud. \"I don't know.\"  \"What don't you know?\" asked Sammy Jay, who, now that he and Paddy had become friends, was very much interested in what Paddy was doing.  \"Why,\" replied Paddy, \"I don't know just how I am going to get those trees. Now that Old Man Coyote is watching for me, it isn't safe for me to go very far from my pond. I suppose I could dig a canal up to some of the nearest trees and then float them down to the pond, but it is hard to work and keep watch for enemies at the same time. I guess I'll have to be content with some of these alders growing close to the water, but he bark of aspens is so much better that I--I wish I could get them.\"  \"What's a canal?\" asked Sammy abruptly.  \"A canal? Why a canal is a kind of ditch in which water can run,\" replied Paddy.  Sammy nodded. \"I've seen Farmer Brown dig one over on the Green Meadows, but it looked like a great deal of work. I didn't suppose that anyone else could do it. Do you really mean that you can dig a canal, Paddy?\"  \"Of course I mean it,\" replied Paddy, in a surprised tone of voice. \"I have helped dig lots of canals. You ought to see some of them back where I came from.\"  \"I'd like to,\" replied Sammy. \"I think it is perfectly wonderful. I don't see how you do it.\"  \"It's easy enough when you know how,\" replied Paddy. \"If I dared to, I'd show you.\"  Sammy had a sudden idea. It almost made him gasp. \"I tell you what, you work and I'll keep watch!\" he cried. \"You know my eyes are very sharp.\"  \"Will you?\" cried Paddy eagerly. \"That would be perfectly splendid. You have the sharpest eyes of anyone whom I know, and I would feel perfectly safe with you on watch. But I don't want to put you to all to that trouble, Mr. Jay.\"  \"Of course I will,\" replied Sammy, \"and it won't be any trouble at all. I'll just love to do it.\" You see, it made Sammy feel very proud to have Paddy say that he had such sharp eyes. \"When will you begin?\"  \"Right away, if you will just take a look around and see that it is perfectly safe for me to come out on land.\"  Sammy didn't wait to hear more. He spread his beautiful blue wings and started off over the Green Forest straight for the Green Meadows. Paddy watched him go with a puzzled and disappointed air. \"That's funny,\" thought he. \"I thought he really meant it, and now off he goes without even saying good-by.\"  In a little while back came Sammy, all out of breath. \"It's all right,\" he panted. \"You can go to work just as soon as you please.\"  Paddy looked more puzzled than ever. \"How do you know?\" he asked. \"I haven't seen you looking around.\"  \"I did better than that,\" replied Sammy. \"If Old Man Coyote had been hiding somewhere in the Green Forest, it might have taken me some time to find him. But he isn't. You see, I flew straight over to his home in the Green Meadows to see if he is there, and he is. He's taking a sun bath and looking as cross as two sticks. I don't think he'll be back here this morning, but I'll keep a sharp watch while you work.\"  Paddy made Sammy a low bow. \"You certainly are smart, Mr. Jay,\" said he. \"I wouldn't have thought of going over to Old Man Coyote's home to see if he was there. I'll feel perfectly safe with you on guard. Now I'll get to work.\"    CHAPTER XXI   Paddy and Sammy Jay Work Together.  Jerry Muskrat had been home at the Smiling Pool for several days. But he couldn't stay there long. Oh, my, no! He just had to get back to see what his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, was doing. So as soon as he was sure that everything was all right at the Smiling Pool he hurried back up the Laughing Brook to Paddy's pond, deep in the Green Forest. As soon as he was in sight of it, he looked eagerly for Paddy. At first he didn't see him. Then he stopped and gazed over at the place where Paddy had been cutting aspen trees for food. Something was going on there, something queer. He couldn't make it out.  Jus then Sammy Jay came flying over.  \"What's Paddy doing?\" Jerry asked.  Sammy Jay dropped down to the top of an alder tree and fluffed out all his feathers in a very important way. \"Oh,\" said he, \"Paddy and I are building something!\"  \"You! Paddy and you! Ha, ha! Paddy and you building something!\" Jerry laughed.  \"Yes, me!\" snapped Sammy angrily. \"That's what I said; Paddy and I are building something.\"  Jerry had begun to swim across the pond by this time, and Sammy was flying across. \"Why don't you tell the truth, Sammy, and say that Paddy is building something and you are making him all the trouble you can?\" called Jerry.  Sammy's eyes snapped angrily, and he darted down at Jerry's little brown head. \"It isn't true!\" he shrieked. \"You ask Paddy if I'm not helping!\"  Jerry ducked under water to escape Sammy's sharp bill. When he came up again, Sammy was over in the little grove of aspen trees where Paddy was at work. Then Jerry discovered something. What was it? Why a little water-path led right up to the aspen trees, and there, at the end of the little water-path, was Paddy the Beaver hard at work. He was digging and piling the earth on one side very neatly. In fact, he was making the water-path longer. Jerry swam right up the little water-path to where Paddy was working. \"Good morning, Cousin Paddy,\" said he. \"What are you doing?\"  \"Oh,\" replied Paddy, \"Sammy Jay and I are building a canal.\"  Sammy Jay looked down at Jerry in triumph, and Jerry looked at Paddy as if he thought that he was joking.  \"Sammy Jay? What's Sammy Jay got to do about it?\" demanded Jerry.  \"A whole lot,\" replied Paddy. \"You see, he keeps watch while I work. If he didn't, I couldn't work, and there wouldn't be any canal. Old Man Coyote has been trying to catch me, and I wouldn't dare work on shore if it wasn't that I am sure that the sharpest eyes in the Green Forest are watching for danger.\"  Sammy Jay looked very much pleased indeed and very proud.  \"So you see, it takes both of us to make this canal; I dig while Sammy watches. So we are building it together,\" concluded Paddy with a twinkle in his eyes.  \"I see,\" said Jerry slowly. Then he turned to Sammy Jay. \"I beg your pardon, Sammy,\" said he. \"I do indeed.\"  \"That's all right,\" replied Sammy airily. \"What do you think of our canal?\"  \"I think it is wonderful,\" replied Jerry.  And indeed it was a very fine canal, straight, wide, and deep enough for Paddy to swim in and float his logs out to the pond. Yes, indeed, it was a very fine canal.    CHAPTER XXII  Paddy Finishes His Harvest.       \"Sharp his tongue and sharp his eyes--       Sammy guards against surprise.       If 'twere not for Sammy Jay       I could do no work today.\"  When Sammy overheard Paddy the Beaver say that to Jerry Muskrat, it made him swell up all over with pure pride. You see, Sammy is so used to hearing bad things about himself that to hear something nice like that pleased him immensely. He straightway forgot all the mean things he had said to Paddy when he first saw him--how he had called him a thief because he had cut the aspen trees he needed. He forgot all this. He forgot how Paddy had made him the laughingstock of the Green Forest and the Green"]]]
