We have here a remarkable instance of the power of light in retarding and hastening the revolving movement.  (_See_ ERRATA.)  _Convolvulus sepium_ (large-flowered cultivated var.) moves against the sun.  Two circles, were made each in 1 hr. 42 m.: difference in semicircle from and to the light 14 m.  _Rivea tiliæfolia_ (Convolvulaceæ) moves against the sun, made four revolutions in 9 hrs.; so that, on an average, each was performed in 2 hrs. 15 m.  _Plumbago rosea_ (Plumbaginaceæ) follows the sun.  The shoot did not begin to revolve until nearly a yard in height; it then made a fine circle in 10 hrs. 45 m.  During the next few days it continued to move, but irregularly.  On August 15th the shoot followed, during a period of 10 hrs. 40 m., a long and deeply zigzag course and then made a broad ellipse.  The figure apparently represented three ellipses, each of which averaged 3 hrs. 38 m. for its completion.  _Jasminum pauciflorum_, Bentham (Jasminaceæ), moves against the sun.  A circle was made in 7 hrs. 15 m., and a second rather more quickly.  _Clerodendrum Thomsonii_ (Verbenaceæ) follows the sun.                                         H.      M.

July 22, 1st circle was made in        8       0  (rather young                                                   shoot)       23, 2nd                          7      15       24, 3rd                          5       0  (about)  In the foregoing Table, which includes twining plants belonging to widely different orders, we see that the rate at which growth travels or circulates round the axis (on which the revolving movement depends), differs much.  As long as a plant remains under the same conditions, the rate is often remarkably uniform, as with the Hop, _Mikania_, _Phaseolus_, &c.  The Scyphanthus made one revolution in 1 hr. 17 m., and this is the quickest rate observed by me; but we shall hereafter see a tendril-bearing Passiflora revolving more rapidly.  A shoot of the _Akebia quinata_ made a revolution in 1 hr. 30 m., and three revolutions at the average rate of 1 hr. 38 m.; a Convolvulus made two revolutions at the average of 1 hr. 42 m., and _Phaseolus vulgaris_ three at the average of 1 hr. 57 m.  On the other hand, some plants take 24 hrs. for a single revolution, and the _Adhadota_ sometimes required 48 hrs.; yet this latter plant is an efficient twiner.  Species of the same genus move at different rates.  The rate does not seem governed by the thickness of the shoots: those of the _Sollya_ are as thin and flexible as string, but move more slowly than the thick and fleshy shoots of the _Ruscus_, which seem little fitted for movement of any kind.  The shoots of the _Wistaria_, which become woody, move faster than those of the herbaceous _Ipomoea_ or _Thunbergia_.  We know that the internodes, whilst still very young, do not acquire their proper rate of movement; hence the several shoots on the same plant may sometimes be seen revolving at different rates.  The two or three, or even more, internodes which are first formed above the cotyledons, or above the root-stock of a perennial plant, do not move; they can support themselves, and nothing superfluous is granted.  A greater number of twiners revolve in a course opposed to that of the sun, or to the hands of a watch, than in the reversed course, and, consequently, the majority, as is well known, ascend their supports from left to right.  Occasionally, though rarely, plants of the same order twine in opposite directions, of which Mohl (p. 125) gives a case in the Leguminosæ, and we have in the table another in the Acanthaceæ.  I have seen no instance of two species of the same genus twining in opposite directions, and such cases must be rare; but Fritz Müller {33} states that although _Mikania scandens_ twines, as I have described, from left to right, another species in South Brazil twines in an opposite direction.  It would have been an anomalous circumstance if no such cases had occurred, for different individuals of the same species, namely, of _Solanum dulcamara_ (Dutrochet, tom. xix. p. 299), revolve and twine in two directions: this plant, however; is a most feeble twiner.  _Loasa aurantiaca_ (Léon, p. 351) offers a much more curious case: I raised seventeen plants: of these eight revolved in opposition to the sun and ascended from left to right; five followed the sun and ascended from right to left; and four revolved and twined first in one direction, and then reversed their course, {34} the petioles of the opposite leaves affording a _point d’appui_ for the reversal of the spire.  One of these four plants made seven spiral turns from right to left, and five turns from left to right.  Another plant in the same family, the _Scyphanthus elegans_, habitually twines in this same manner.  I raised many plants of it, and the stems of all took one turn, or occasionally two or even three turns in one direction, and then, ascending for a short space straight, reversed their course and took one or two turns in an opposite direction. The reversal of the curvature occurred at any point in the stem, even in the middle of an internode.  Had I not seen this case, I should have thought its occurrence most improbable.  It would be hardly possible with any plant which ascended above a few feet in height, or which lived in an exposed situation; for the stem could be pulled away easily from its support, with but little unwinding; nor could it have adhered at all, had not the internodes soon become moderately rigid.  With leaf-climbers, as we shall soon see, analogous cases frequently occur; but these present no difficulty, as the stem is secured by the clasping petioles.  In the many other revolving and twining plants observed by me, I never but twice saw the movement reversed; once, and only for a short space, in _Ipomoea jucunda_; but frequently with _Hibbertia dentata_.  This plant at first perplexed me much, for I continually observed its long and flexible shoots, evidently well fitted for twining, make a whole, or half, or quarter circle in one direction and then in an opposite direction; consequently, when I placed the shoots near thin or thick sticks, or perpendicularly stretched string, they seemed as if constantly trying to ascend, but always failed.  I then surrounded the plant with a mass of branched twigs; the shoots ascended, and passed through them, but several came out laterally, and their depending extremities seldom turned upwards as is usual with twining plants.  Finally, I surrounded a second plant with many thin upright sticks, and placed it near the first one with twigs; and now both had got what they liked, for they twined up the parallel sticks, sometimes winding round one and sometimes round several; and the shoots travelled laterally from one to the other pot; but as the plants grew older, some of the shoots twined regularly up thin upright sticks.  Though the revolving movement was sometimes in one direction and sometimes in the other, the twining was invariably from left to right; {36} so that the more potent or persistent movement of revolution must have been in opposition to the course of the sun.  It would appear that this _Hibbertia_ is adapted both to ascend by twining, and to ramble laterally through the thick Australian scrub.  I have described the above case in some detail, because, as far as I have seen, it is rare to find any special adaptations with twining plants, in which respect they differ much from the more highly organized tendril-bearers.  The _Solanum dulcamara_, as we shall presently see, can twine only round stems which are both thin and flexible.  Most twining plants are adapted to ascend supports of moderate though of different thicknesses.  Our English twiners, as far as I have seen, never twine round trees, excepting the honeysuckle (_Lonicera periclymenum_), which I have observed twining up a young beech-tree nearly 4½ inches in diameter. Mohl (p. 134) found that the _Phaseolus multiflorus_ and _Ipomoea purpurea_ could not, when placed in a room with the light entering on one side, twine round sticks between 3 and 4 inches in diameter; for this interfered, in a manner presently to be explained, with the revolving movement.  In the open air, however, the _Phaseolus_ twined round a support of the above thickness, but failed in twining round one 9 inches in diameter.  Nevertheless, some twiners of the warmer temperate regions can manage this latter degree of thickness; for I hear from Dr. Hooker that at Kew the _Ruscus androgynus_ has ascended a column 9 inches in diameter; and although a _Wistaria_ grown by me in a small pot tried in vain for weeks to get round a post between 5 and 6 inches in thickness, yet at Kew a plant ascended a trunk above 6 inches in diameter.
