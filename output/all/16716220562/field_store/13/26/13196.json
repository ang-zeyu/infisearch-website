So each Mamma elephant calls to her child to come and stand on the bank. Now, many of our children often hate to be bathed; and the elephant children are just the same! In fact, the very small ones actually cry and shriek, just like our babies!   _Elephant Child Obeys Mamma--or Gets Spanked_  But when the Mamma elephant calls to the baby to stop playing and come and stand by the bank, the baby comes at once, even though it hates to be bathed. The baby elephant obeys its Mamma almost the first time, whatever she tells it to do.  But if the baby does not obey, does its Mamma spank it? Of course she does--like all Mammas! The elephant Mamma does the spanking with her trunk.  But I must tell you at once that an elephant child never gets spanked more than once in its life--and that is enough! And some are so good that they _never_ get spanked!  The elephant child learns very quickly to obey its Mamma and Papa, and afterwards its trainer or teacher. The elephant child even obeys the very minute it is told to do anything; in fact, sometimes in the jungle there is a sudden danger, even if the elephant child does not see the danger. But its Mamma or Papa sees it.  Then the Mamma or Papa calls out to the child to stop, or come away, or do something, _at once_; and if the child does not do it at once, it may get killed. Among men folks, if a child runs out into the street, and an auto or a street car comes suddenly, then if the child will not obey its Mamma at once and do exactly as she says, the child may be run over and killed. In the jungle the elephant child also has sudden dangers like that, though in a different way.  In the next chapter I shall tell you a wonderful story about a boy elephant who escaped a great danger because he obeyed his Papa at once.  But sometimes it happens that a boy elephant is really naughty--just like a bad boy among men. As you know, a bad boy among men usually grows up to be a bad man, and then he gets into a lot of trouble. In the elephant herd it is just the same; a bad little elephant grows up to be a bad big elephant; it is then called a _rogue_. In another book I shall tell you how the President of the herd orders all the police elephants to stand in a ring around the rogue and give him a most awful spanking. And they do that, not with their trunks this time, but with their _tusks_--which hurt most dreadfully.   _How the Elephant Child is Bathed_  But now I shall tell you about the baby elephant when its Mamma calls it to come and be bathed. It comes to the edge of the bank, and stands facing its Mamma. Then the Mamma fills her trunk with water, brings the trunk quite near the baby, and squirts the water all over it.  The baby may howl and jump about and make faces, but it _never runs away_! Again and again the Mamma squirts the water, till all the mud and dust of the jungle is washed away from the baby's body. Then she tells the baby to play about on the bank again, while she attends to the bigger children.  What has she got to do to them? She must teach them to swim!  Of course _all animals with four legs know how to swim naturally_; their bodies float in the water quite easily, and they have only to work their legs to move along in the water. But with elephants it is a little different. Why? Just think!  I shall tell you. Although they can float quite naturally, their noses point downward right into the water. As I said before, the elephant's trunk is its nose--that is, the elephant has to _breathe through the trunk_. So of course, if in trying to swim a little elephant kept its trunk down in the water, it would not be able to breathe at all, and would die.  That is why the Mamma elephant has to teach her child how to swim properly. And the way she does it is quite wonderful.  I must first tell you that the trunk is not only like a nose to the elephant, but also is useful as a _hand_; the elephant can hold a lot of things with it, and can even pick up with its tip a tiny thing as small as a pin.   _How the Elephant Child Learns to Swim_  So the Mamma elephant stretches out her trunk before her, just like an arm, and tells her child to lie across it. In that way she holds up the child in the water, so that the little elephant has only to think of curling up the tip of its own little trunk out of the water to breathe. Then she tells her child to kick out with its legs, so as to move forward through the water.  But sometimes, in kicking out, the little elephant forgets to hold up the tip of its trunk out of the water at the same time; then down goes its trunk into the water, and it cannot breathe!  Then what happens? The Mamma elephant can do nothing, as she is already using her own trunk to hold up her child. So, what is to be done?  Really, the elephants are so wise that they take no chances of that happening. The Papa elephant takes care of that. When he sees that the Mamma is teaching the little elephant how to swim, he always comes near them. He may be swimming about, as if he were enjoying himself; but he is really watching them all the time.  And if the little elephant forgets to hold up its trunk out of the water, the Papa comes quickly, and with one upward stroke of his own trunk he lifts up the little elephant's trunk clear out of the water. Is not that very wise and thoughtful of the Papa elephant?  In that way the little elephant soon learns to do _both_ things--that is, to kick out with its legs so as to move along, and also to hold up its trunk to breathe. And then, of course, it can swim properly.  And yet the elephants are so very wise that they never take the risk of tiring out a little elephant, if they have to swim a very long way. Sometimes a whole herd of elephants has to swim across a very wide river. Then the Mamma elephant tells her child to swim in front of her, while she encourages the child from behind with many fond words.  But sometimes after swimming halfway across the river--  \"Mamma, I am getting tired!\" cries the little one.  \"Then come on my back, darling!\" says the Mamma.  She dives, and comes up right under the little elephant; so now her child sits on her back. In that way she swims along, and carries her child across the wide river, as you see in the picture.  [Illustration: An Elephant Mamma Carrying her Child across the River]     CHAPTER IV.  Elephants: The Tricks of the Jungle   Now I shall tell you how a little elephant learns all the tricks of the jungle from its Mamma and Papa. By the tricks of the jungle I mean all the things that an animal has to learn in order to get enough to eat every day, what to do when food is scarce, how to be comfortable and happy, and also how to escape from every danger; in fact, these things are very much like what men have to learn, only in a different way.  But the animal folks are better off in one way: what they have to learn is not like a lesson in school, but just play. In fact they learn everything by just playing it as a game! I shall tell you how.  When a baby elephant is quite small, its Mamma has to feed it with milk. Afterwards, when it has teeth, she teaches it to feed from the jungle. All elephants eat tender shoots, herbs, and fresh young leaves; they seize a bough with the trunk, and pull it down in such a way that the end of the bough reaches right into the mouth.   _Elephant Child Learns to Feed_  First, the Mamma elephant eats like that from several boughs, while the little elephant watches her do it. Then she looks at a low bough within easy reach, and says in the elephant language, \"Eat that!\"  The little one looks at the bough, grabs it anyhow with its trunk, and pulls it down. But it cannot get the end of the bough _into its mouth_! Instead, the bough pokes it on the forehead, or eyes, or cheeks.  \"Hold it straight!\" says Mamma, laughing.  The little one tries several times, but still it cannot get the bough to come right. Then its Mamma puts her own trunk over that of her child, and turns it to right or left, till the bough comes exactly into the little elephant's mouth.  \"You must learn to use your trunk just like a _hand_,\" she says. \"So you must bend your trunk, or turn it, or twist it, to get the thing you are holding exactly where you want it.\"  And that is the first great thing the little elephant has to learn--_how to use its trunk as we use our hands_. After that everything else comes easy.  Now I am going to tell you about the childhood of the most wonderful elephant in the world, who actually lives to-day in the courtyard of a palace in India. He is the biggest elephant that ever was; that is why he lives in a grand palace, and does nothing except carry a King, or some other great man, on his back on days of festival.  In fact he was the leader among all the elephants in a long procession at a grand festival called the Durbar, held in honor of the King of England. On that day a lovely cloth of silk woven with gold was put on the elephant's back, and around his tusks were placed rings of solid gold studded with real diamonds, rubies, and pearls.  At another time he carried on his back the Crown Prince of Germany, when he visited India a few years ago; and at other times he has carried Grand Dukes of Russia and Arch Dukes of Austria when _they_ visited India.  So you see, he is quite the grandest elephant in the world. He has a real name, just like a man, and it is written down in books with the names of all the grand officers of the palace. His name is Salar Jung; so we shall call him Salar for short.  He was born in the jungle, and his Papa and Mamma were quite wild then. It was only after he grew up that Salar came to live in a palace.   _Elephant Child \"Swats\" Tormenting Flies_  But now about Salar's early boyhood. After his Mamma had taught him to swim, to eat from the boughs of trees, and to drink for himself by dipping his trunk into the water, she had another useful thing to teach"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],["title","The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#4)"],["body","m. In the jungle there are swarms of tormenting flies; they come buzzing around the elephants, and bother them, just as they bother us. Now, _we_ can whisk off the flies with our hands, but how about an elephant?  Of course, you will say, his trunk is his hand; and so he can use the trunk to slap the flies or whisk them off. True, but the trunk will not reach more than halfway down the side of the body; and the elephant is too stiff to bend his body as we do; and his tail is too short to reach even a yard each way. Then how can he get rid of the flies where he cannot reach them? Just think!  If he only could make his trunk _longer_! But how could he do that? Very simply! Of course he cannot actually make the trunk longer, but he breaks off a small bough of a tree and holds it at the end of his trunk; then he uses the bough like a fan, and whisks off, or brushes off, the flies with it.  And that is what Salar's Mamma taught him to do. After that he was very comfortable.  Not quite; he had just one more thing to learn from his Mamma, to make him quite comfortable. The sun gets very hot, and when the elephants are feeding from tree to tree, or marching through the jungle, they feel the hot sun on their backs dreadfully--although they have a thick skin.  Now, how could they guard themselves from the hot sun? Just think!  Why, just as _we_ do, you will say, by using a kind of umbrella! Of course you mean that an elephant could break off a large bough, and hold it over his head and over his back! But his trunk would soon get tired of holding anything as big as that! Besides, he has to use his trunk all the time to feed! If _you_ had only one hand, you could not eat with it and at the same time hold an umbrella over your head with it! Then how _does_ the elephant manage it?   _Elephant Covers his Back from Hot Sun_  I shall tell you. He breaks off many small boughs, one at a time, and lays them on his back with his trunk; he is careful to lay them in proper order, and to criss-cross them, so that the boughs will not fall off. In fact, he tries to arrange them very much like the thatched roof of a cottage. That is very clever of him, is it not?  But then he does something else, still more clever! When a cottager builds his thatched roof, he has to plaster the ceiling to prevent any rain or sunshine from creeping in through the little spaces between the thatches. So also the thatch on the elephant's back has many gaps, through which the hot sun can still beat down on his skin. So what does he do to fill up the gaps?  He cannot do anything to _plaster_ his back; but I shall tell you what he does do. He just draws into his trunk a lot of dust from the ground; then he curls up the trunk over his back, and blows the dust over the gaps in the thatch on his back. Of course he has to do that many times to fill up all the gaps; but at last, when he does not _feel_ the sun any more, he knows that his back is quite covered.  Is not that a very wonderful thing for the elephants to think out, all by themselves? And that is what Salar's Mamma taught him to do.  But, a few years later, he came to the age when boys among men usually have to go to school. Then Salar passed to the care of his Papa. In feeding through the jungle, when all the elephants march and eat from tree to tree, Salar walked with his Papa, and began to learn lessons from him. And his Papa's way of teaching him was quite different from that of his Mamma, and often very funny!   _How Elephants Walk under Water_  The first thing he taught was at the stream at midnight. By this time Salar could swim quite well; so he was enjoying himself with the grown-ups. But his Papa kept watching him with the corner of his eye. Little by little he drew nearer and nearer to Salar, and waited till the youngster came to a part where the water was not at all deep. Then suddenly his Papa gave Salar a butt with his head. Down went Salar under the water, snorting and spluttering and hollering.  \"Hold up your trunk, you simp!\" cried his Papa.  But Salar was too frightened to remember to hold up his trunk; so his Papa caught Salar's trunk in his own and hoisted it clear out of the water. Then what was Salar's joy and surprise to find that he could breathe quite well, though his feet were actually touching the bottom of the stream. Of course he kicked out, and tried to get up to the top of the water again. But--  \"Stay there!\" cried his Papa, giving him another butt, though still holding the youngster's trunk carefully out of the water.  Then Salar lost all fear of the water; he was not a bit afraid of being ducked, so long as the tip of his trunk was out of the water. So he learned to do a wonderful thing--he learned to remain completely under the water, so that his feet were actually resting on the bottom of the stream, with only the tip of his trunk out of the water. No other animal can do that.  And the most astonishing thing about it is that the elephants have taught themselves to do that trick; so that _a whole herd of elephants can walk into a stream in time of danger, and disappear from sight_, the smaller ones standing in the shallow parts, and the full-grown ones standing in the deeper parts.  I have known of lots of hunters, who were chasing a herd of elephants and who saw the elephants run ahead toward a river, to find to their surprise, on reaching the river, that the whole herd had disappeared as if by magic. They saw nothing, and did not dream that the little things floating here and there, no bigger than your fist, could mean anything. But of course they were the tips of the trunks of the elephants hidden under the water.  To have thought out even that one trick for themselves proves that the elephants are the wisest of all animals, next after men folks. And they have thought out many more tricks, as I shall tell you very soon.  But now I shall tell you the next trick that Salar's father taught him. An elephant often has to break down trees in the jungle to clear a way for himself; or sometimes he has to do that to make an open space where he can lie down comfortably. So this is the way Salar's father taught him to break down trees.   _How Elephants Break Down or Pull Out Trees_  First he chose a small tree, not much thicker than your wrist; this he pulled out easily with his trunk, just as you might use your hand to pull out a small shrub. Then he chose a tree about six inches thick. He tried it first carefully with his trunk; but the tree was too strong to pull out in that way.  So the old elephant put his foot on the side of the tree, and pressed with all his weight--as you see in the picture. The tree bent more and more, and then suddenly broke off near the ground with a loud crack.  \"I can do that!\" cried Salar, frisking around his father, impatient to show what _he_ could do.  Salar looked around and saw a tree of about the same size. He made a dash at the tree, put his right foot on it, and--  His father winked, but said nothing. For all elephants love a joke.  Now the wily old elephant knew that this tree was a banana tree, although the fruit had not yet started growing on it. The tree looked quite hard and strong, but it was really very soft and easy to break, like all banana trees. But Salar did not know that yet!  [Illustration: An Elephant Breaking a Tree with his Foot]  Instead, when he pressed on it with his foot and put his whole weight on it, just as he had seen his father do to the other tree,--snap went the tree like a twig, and Salar tumbled head over heels and went rolling over the ground.  \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\" laughed the merry old elephant. \"Did I not show you, silly, how to try it first carefully, with your trunk, before putting your foot on it?\"  \"Of course you did!\" Salar said, remembering.  \"That is what men folks mean when they say, 'You have put your foot into it.' You must remember _never to put your foot into anything before trying it first with your trunk_,\" the old elephant went on to say. \"Now watch me knock down a still bigger tree.\"  This tree was as thick as a man's body. After trying it first with his trunk and then with his foot, the wise old elephant put his back on it and _heaved_. Little by little the tree bent on that side, but not very much. The elephant stopped heaving, came around and looked at the tree. Then he began to heave from the _other_ side of the tree.  You have seen a man trying to loosen a nail from a board? He first hits the nail on one side, and then on the other side; and he goes on hitting the nail from side to side, till it is quite loose.  Well, that cunning old elephant did just the same thing to that tree; he first heaved the tree from one side, and then he heaved from the other side; and he went on heaving from side to side, till he loosened the tree from the ground. Then he pushed the tree with his foot, and it came out of the ground and fell with a loud thud.  And that is how Salar learned to heave with his body, though of course he could not loosen so big a tree just yet.  There were many other tricks that Salar learned from his father, and I shall tell you one of the best of them in the next chapter.     CHAPTER V  Elephants: The Tricky Trap   Salar and his father were going through the jungle, feeding from tree to tree, and from bush to bush. One day they saw a little clear space and in the middle of it a banana tree--just one tree. But beautiful bunches of ripe bananas were growing on it from a large stalk.  Salar just loved bananas. In fact, all elephants do, as they cannot get them in the jungle more than once in many months; for bananas grow mostly in plantations kept by men. So Salar ran toward the tree joyously.  But the wise old elephant had seen at once that the space all around the tree was rather level and clear of bushes. That was strange in the jungle, he thought!  Now, why did it look strange? Can _you_ tell? Why was it strange that the space should be all flat and level, and clear of bushes?"]]]
