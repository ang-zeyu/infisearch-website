They agree closely in habits: jackals, when tamed and called by their {25} master, wag their tails, crouch, and throw themselves on their backs; they smell at the tails of dogs, and void their urine sideways.[26] A number of excellent naturalists, from the time of Güldenstädt to that of Ehrenberg, Hemprich, and Cretzschmar, have expressed themselves in the strongest terms with respect to the resemblance of the half-domestic dogs of Asia and Egypt to jackals. M. Nordmann, for instance, says, \"Les chiens d'Awhasie ressemblent étonnamment à des chacals.\" Ehrenberg[27] asserts that the domestic dogs of Lower Egypt, and certain mummied dogs, have for their wild type a species of wolf (_C. lupaster_) of the country; whereas the domestic dogs of Nubia and certain other mummied dogs have the closest relation to a wild species of the same country, viz. _C. sabbar_, which is only a form of the common jackal. Pallas asserts that jackals and dogs sometimes naturally cross in the East; and a case is on record in Algeria.[28] The greater number of naturalists divide the jackals of Asia and Africa into several species, but some few rank them all as one.  I may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of Guinea are fox-like animals, and are dumb.[29] On the east coast of Africa, between lat. 4° and 6° south, and about ten days' journey in the interior, a semi-domestic dog, as the Rev. S. Erhardt informs me, is kept, which the natives assert is derived from a similar wild animal. Lichtenstein[30] says that the dogs of the Bosjemans present a striking resemblance even in colour (excepting the black stripe down the back) with the _C. mesomelas_ of South Africa. Mr. E. Layard informs me that he has seen a Caffre dog which closely resembled an Esquimaux dog. In Australia the Dingo is both domesticated and wild; though this animal may have been introduced aboriginally by man, yet it must be considered as almost an endemic form, for its remains have been found in a similar state of preservation and associated with {26} extinct mammals, so that its introduction must have been ancient.[31]  From this resemblance in several countries of the half-domesticated dogs to the wild species still living there,--from the facility with which they can often be crossed together,--from even half-tamed animals being so much valued by savages,--and from the other circumstances previously remarked on which favour their domestication, it is highly probable that the domestic dogs of the world have descended from two good species of wolf (viz. _C. lupus_ and _C. latrans_), and from two or three other doubtful species of wolves (namely, the European, Indian, and North African forms); from at least one or two South American canine species; from several races or species of the jackal; and perhaps from one or more extinct species. Those authors who attribute great influence to the action of climate by itself may thus account for the resemblance of the domesticated dogs and native animals in the same countries; but I know of no facts supporting the belief in so powerful an action of climate.  It cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having been anciently domesticated, that these animals are tamed with difficulty: facts have been already given on this head, but I may add that the young of the _Canis primævus_ of India were tamed by Mr. Hodgson,[32] and became as sensible to caresses, and manifested as much intelligence, as any sporting dog of the same age. There is not much difference, as we have already shown and shall immediately further see, in habits between the domestic dogs of the North American Indians and the wolves of that country, or between the Eastern pariah dogs and jackals, or between the dogs which have run wild in various countries and the several natural species of the family. The habit of barking, however, which is almost universal with domesticated {27} dogs, and which does not characterise a single natural species of the family, seems an exception; but this habit is soon lost and soon reacquired. The case of the wild dogs on the island of Juan Fernandez having become dumb has often been quoted, and there is reason to believe[33] that the dumbness ensued in the course of thirty-three years; on the other hand, dogs taken from this island by Ulloa slowly reacquired the habit of barking. The Mackenzie-river dogs, of the _Canis latrans_ type, when brought to England, never learned to bark properly; but one born in the Zoological Gardens[34] \"made his voice sound as loudly as any other dog of the same age and size.\" According to Professor Nillson,[35] a wolf-whelp reared by a bitch barks. I. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire exhibited a jackal which barked with the same tone as any common dog.[36] An interesting account has been given by Mr. G. Clarke[37] of some dogs run wild on Juan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean; \"they had entirely lost the faculty of barking; they had no inclination for the company of other dogs, nor did they acquire their voice,\" during a captivity of several months. On the island they \"congregate in vast packs, and catch sea-birds with as much address as foxes could display.\" The feral dogs of La Plata have not become dumb; they are of large size, hunt single or in packs, and burrow holes for their young.[38] In these habits the feral dogs of La Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of which hunt either singly or in packs, and burrow holes.[39] These feral dogs have not become uniform in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La Plata.[40] In Cuba the feral dogs are described by Poeppig as nearly all mouse-coloured, with short ears and light-blue eyes. {28} In St. Domingo, Col. Ham. Smith says[41] that the feral dogs are very large, like greyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small ears, and large light-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so anciently naturalised in Australia, \"varies considerably in colour,\" as I am informed by Mr. P. P. King: a half-bred Dingo reared in England[42] showed signs of wishing to burrow.      From the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral     state gives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal     parent-species. One fact, however, with respect to the colouring of     domestic dogs, I at one time hoped might have thrown some light on     their origin; and it is worth giving, as showing how colouring follows     laws, even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an animal as the     dog. Black dogs with tan-coloured feet, whatever breed they may belong     to, almost invariably have a tan-coloured spot on the upper and inner     corners of each eye, and their lips are generally thus coloured. I have     seen only two exceptions to this rule, namely, in a spaniel and     terrier. Dogs of a light-brown colour often have a lighter,     yellowish-brown spot over the eyes; sometimes the spot is white, and in     a mongrel terrier the spot was black. Mr. Waring kindly examined for me     a stud of fifteen greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of them were black, or     black and white, or brindled, and these had no eye-spots; but three     were red and one slaty-blue, and these four had dark-coloured spots     over their eyes. Although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour,     they strongly tend to be tan-coloured; this is proved by my having seen     four spaniels, a setter, two Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large mongrel,     and some fox-hounds, coloured black and white, with not a trace of     tan-colour, excepting the spots over the eyes, and sometimes a little     on the feet. These latter cases, and many others, show plainly that the     colour of the feet and the eye-spots are in some way correlated. I have     noticed, in various breeds, every gradation, from the whole face being     tan-coloured, to a complete ring round the eyes, to a minute spot over     the inner and upper corners. The spots occur in various sub-breeds of     terriers and spaniels; in setters; in hounds of various kinds,     including the turnspit-like German badger-hound; in shepherd dogs; in a     mongrel, of which neither parent had the spots; in one pure bulldog,     though the spots were in this case almost white; and in     greyhounds,--but true black-and-tan greyhounds are excessively rare;     nevertheless I have been assured by Mr. Warwick, that one ran at the     Caledonian Champion meeting of April, 1860, and was \"marked precisely     like a black-and-tan terrier.\" Mr. Swinhoe at my request looked at the     dogs in China, at Amoy, and he soon noticed a brown dog with yellow     spots over the eyes. Colonel H. Smith[43] figures the magnificent black     mastiff of Thibet with a {29} tan-coloured stripe over the eyes, feet,     and chaps; and what is more singular, he figures the Alco, or native     domestic dog of Mexico, as black and white, with narrow tan-coloured     rings round the eyes; at the Exhibition of dogs in London, May, 1863, a     so-called forest-dog from North-West Mexico was shown, which had pale     tan-coloured spots over the eyes. The occurrence of these tan-coloured     spots in dogs of such extremely different breeds, living in various     parts of the world, makes the fact highly remarkable.      We shall hereafter see, especially in the chapter on Pigeons, that     coloured marks are strongly inherited, and that they often aid us in     discovering the primitive forms of our domestic races. Hence, if any     wild canine species had distinctly exhibited the tan-coloured spots     over the eyes, it might have been argued that this was the parent-form     of nearly all our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24923"],["title","The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Vol. I. (#7)"],["body"," races. But after looking at many coloured     plates, and through the whole collection of skins in the British     Museum, I can find no species thus marked. It is no doubt possible that     some extinct species was thus coloured. On the other hand, in looking     at the various species, there seems to be a tolerably plain correlation     between tan-coloured legs and face; and less frequently between black     legs and a black face; and this general rule of colouring explains to a     certain extent the above-given cases of correlation between the     eye-spots and the colour of the feet. Moreover, some jackals and foxes     have a trace of a white ring round their eyes, as in _C. mesomelas_,     _C. aureus_, and (judging from Colonel Ham. Smith's drawing) in _C.     alopex_ and _C. thaleb_. Other species have a trace of a black line     over the corners of the eyes, as in _C. variegatus_,     _cinereo-variegatus_, and _fulvus_, and the wild Dingo. Hence I am     inclined to conclude that a tendency for tan-coloured spots to appear     over the eyes in the various breeds of dogs, is analogous to the case     observed by Desmarest, namely, that when any white appears on a dog the     tip of the tail is always white, \"de manière a rappeler la tacho     terminale de même couleur, qui caractérise la plupart des Canidées     sauvages.\"[44]  It has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended from wolves or jackals, because their periods of gestation are different. The supposed difference rests on statements made by Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and others; but these are now known to be erroneous; and the period is found to agree in the wolf, jackal, and dog, as closely as could be expected, for it is often in some degree variable.[45] Tessier, who {30} has closely attended to this subject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the dog. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded cases of retrievers, in which the bitch was put only once to the dog; and not counting this day, but counting that of parturition, the periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two, and sixty-seven days. The average period is sixty-three days; but Bellingeri states that this holds good only with large dogs; and that for small races it is from sixty to sixty-three days; Mr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had much experience with dogs, also informs me that the time is apt to be longer with large than with small dogs.  F. Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been domesticated on account of its offensive smell; but savages are not sensitive in this respect. The degree of odour, also, differs in the different kinds of jackal;[46] and Colonel H. Smith makes a sectional division of the group with one character dependent on not being offensive. On the other hand, dogs--for instance, rough and smooth terriers--differ much in this respect; and M. Godron states that the hairless so-called Turkish dog is more odoriferous than other dogs. Isidore Geoffroy[47] gave to a dog the same odour as that from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh.  The belief that our dogs are descended from wolves, jackals, South American Canidæ, and other species, suggests a far more important difficulty. These animals in their undomesticated state, judging from a widely-spread analogy, would have been in some degree sterile if intercrossed; and such sterility will be admitted as almost certain by all those who believe that the lessened fertility of crossed forms is an infallible criterion of specific distinctness. Anyhow these animals keep distinct in the countries which they inhabit in common. On the other hand, all domestic dogs, which are here supposed to be descended {31} from several distinct species, are, as far as is known, mutually fertile together. But, as Broca has well remarked,[48] the fertility of successive generations of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that care which is thought indispensable when species are crossed. The few facts leading to the conclusion that the sexual feelings and reproductive powers differ in the several races of the dog when crossed are (passing over mere size as rendering propagation difficult) as follows: the Mexican Alco[49] apparently dislikes dogs of other kinds, but this perhaps is not strictly a sexual feeling; the hairless endemic dog of Paraguay, according to Rengger, mixes less with the European races than these do with each other; the Spitz-dog in Germany is said to receive the fox more readily than do other breeds; and Dr. Hodgkin states that a female Dingo in England attracted the male wild foxes. If these latter statements can be trusted, they prove some degree of sexual difference in the breeds of the dog. But the fact remains that our domestic dogs, differing so widely as they do in external structure, are far more fertile together than we have reason to believe their supposed wild parents would have been. Pallas assumes[50] that a long course of domestication eliminates that sterility which the parent-species would have exhibited if only lately captured; no distinct facts are recorded in support of this hypothesis; but the evidence seems to me so strong (independently of the evidence derived from other domesticated animals) in favour of our domestic dogs having descended from several wild stocks, that I am led to admit the truth of this hypothesis.  There is another and closely allied difficulty consequent on the doctrine of the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild species, namely, that they do not seem to be perfectly fertile with their supposed parents. But the experiment has not been quite fairly tried; the Hungarian dog, for instance, {32} which in external appearance so closely resembles the European wolf, ought to be crossed with this wolf; and the pariah-dogs of India with Indian wolves and jackals; and so in other cases. That the sterility is very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other Canidæ is shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them. Buffon got four successive generations from the wolf and dog, and the mongrels were perfectly fertile together.[51] But more lately M. Flourens states positively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids from the wolf and dog, crossed _inter se_, become sterile at the third generation, and those from the jackal and dog at the fourth generation.[52] But these animals were closely confined; and many wild animals, as we shall see in a future chapter, are rendered by confinement in some degree or even utterly sterile. The Dingo, which breeds freely in Australia with our imported dogs, would not breed though repeatedly crossed in the Jardin des Plantes.[53] Some hounds from Central Africa, brought home by Major Denham, never bred in the Tower of London;[54] and a similar tendency to sterility might be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal. Moreover, it appears that in M. Flourens' experiments the hybrids were closely bred in and in for three or four generations; but this circumstance, although it would almost certainly increase the tendency to sterility, would hardly account for the final result, even though aided by close confinement, unless there had been some original tendency to lessened fertility. Several years ago I saw confined in the Zoological Gardens of London a female hybrid from an English dog and jackal, which even in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I was assured by {33} her keeper, she did not fully exhibit her proper periods; but this case, from the numerous instances of fertile hybrids from these two animals, was certainly exceptional. In almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are so many causes of doubt, that it is extremely difficult to come to any positive conclusion. It would, however, appear, that those who believe that our dogs are descended from several species will have not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of domestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed together; but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their supposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been retained or possibly even acquired.  Notwithstanding the difficulties in regard to fertility given in the last two paragraphs, when we reflect on the inherent improbability of man having domesticated throughout the world one single species alone of so widely distributed, so easily tamed, and so useful a group as the Canidæ; when we reflect on the extreme antiquity of the different breeds; and especially when we reflect on the close similarity, both in external structure and habits, between the domestic dogs of various countries and the wild species still inhabiting these same countries, the balance of evidence is strongly in favour of the multiple origin of our dogs.         *       *       *       *       *  _Differences between the several Breeds of the Dog._--If the several breeds have descended from several wild stocks, their difference can obviously in part be explained by that of their parent-species. For instance, the form of the greyhound may be partly accounted for by descent from some such animal as the slim Abyssinian _Canis simensis_,[55] with its elongated muzzle; that of the larger dogs from the larger wolves, and the smaller and slighter dogs from jackals: and thus perhaps we may account for certain constitutional and climatal differences. But it would be a great error to suppose that there has not been in addition[56] a large amount of variation. The intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks, and of the subsequently formed {34} races, has probably increased the total number of breeds, and, as we shall presently see, has greatly modified some of them. But we cannot explain by crossing the origin of such extreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds, bloodhounds, bulldogs, Blenheim spaniels, terriers, pugs, &c., unless we believe that forms equally or more strongly characterised "]]]
