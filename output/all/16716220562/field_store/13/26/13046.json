This consideration applies particularly to college and university men, as, almost without exception, these men are preparing for some of the above mentioned professions or vocations.  Now the conditions of college life, the field sports and athletics, together with the social conditions, tend to develop in college circles a body of most virile young men. The problem which now confronts us is: How may these young men live a hygienic life under these unnatural circumstances?  If a man becomes able to procreate his kind at seventeen but is hardly able to marry before he is thirty he must solve the problem as to what his attitude shall be regarding matters of sex. The earlier this problem is solved the better it is for the young man. Unfortunately, a large proportion of young men do not realize that they have any problem in this field to solve until circumstances, more or less accidental, have already established in them a mental attitude and, perhaps, a habit of life that may not be either wholesome or wise.  From what has preceded, it must be evident that from the early months of the period of puberty, through the adolescent and adult period, even until some progress is made in the senile period, every normal male will experience sexual desires. It has been shown that these particular experiences are linked, more or less intimately, with the condition of the sexual apparatus; but whatever the cause, we are confronted with the question, What shall be done about it?  When a man experiences a sexual desire does it necessarily follow that the desire must be satisfied? Some have reasoned that the muscles of the arm, if not exercised, wither and become weak, therefore the sexual desires, if not exercised will become weak, and the sexual apparatus, if it does not exercise its function, must become withered and atrophied. While this course of reasoning may seem rational and the conclusion may seem tenable, it is well known to physiologists and sociologists that the reasoning is fallacious; the fallacy rests in the premises. It was assumed above that the activity of the sexual glands was comparable with that of muscles.  We must not lose sight of the fact that the male sexual glands are continuously active, and in this continuous activity get their exercise. This activity develops them and keeps them physically perfect after the onset of the period of puberty. Their activity consists very largely in the formation of an internal secretion, the office of which is to develop in the male the highest possible state of virility. Nor must we lose sight of the fact that every procreative act is performed at a sacrifice of some of this vital fluid on the part of the male. A wanton sacrifice of vital fluid either in the act of self abuse or in excessive venery is not justifiable under any consideration; nor may these acts, under any circumstances, be looked upon as sustaining to the gland a relation similar to that which muscular exercise sustains to muscle tissue.  In the light of these facts every normal man would admit that frequent masturbation or excessive sexual intercourse, in wedlock or out, should certainly not be recommended as a method of developing the sexual apparatus.  Most men, however, raise the question: \"Is any indulgence or any artificial means for satisfying the sexual inclination to be discouraged?\" This inclination comes to us in the course of nature. Man in the primitive state would seek a mate as soon as he felt this inclination; would fight for the possession of her as soon as he had reached a sufficient stage of muscular development, and once in possession of his mate, would take her to his perch in the trees or to his cave. In his primitive home he would follow his sexual inclination, impregnate his wife and protect her against all dangers.  Under our present social conditions the young man experiences all these desires the same as his primitive ancestor, but he may not be able to choose a mate and begin with her the building of a home for a whole decade after he experiences the desire to do so. What is the solution?  It must be evident that the solution lies in the acceptance of one or another of three alternatives--either the young man may seek illicit intercourse with women to satisfy his sexual desire, or he may adopt some artificial measure, such as masturbation (self abuse) or, finally, he may lead what is known as a continent life. By continence we mean to adopt neither one of the first two alternatives mentioned, but to leave the care of the sexual apparatus wholly with Nature.  We may now consider these three alternatives in turn.   1. ILLICIT INTERCOURSE WITH WOMEN.  By illicit intercourse with women we mean, sexual intercourse out of wedlock. The term applies either to intercourse between any man and a prostitute, between an unmarried man and a married woman, between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman or between a married man and a married woman not his wife. The term, illicit intercourse, applies to all sexual intercourse that is illegal.  In our discussion of the young man's problem, we may confine our consideration particularly to intercourse with professional prostitutes and with clandestines, or women who are willing to accept the sexual embrace for their own gratification or for money.  In this phase of sexual gratification, it is assumed that the woman has these relations with various men. We purposely eliminate from this discussion the deliberate seduction of pure girls for the purpose of sexual gratification, as such seduction is a heinous offense against the victim and against society, for which offense the man is legally responsible. We are here discussing not the crimes of men, but their vices.  The question that the young man naturally asks is--\"Why should society hold these relations as a vice when the woman, who is party to the act, gives her free consent, perhaps even soliciting the relation, and has given herself up to this sort of a life, either as a sole occupation (prostitute) or as an auxiliary occupation (clandestine) to supplement a wage on which she may not be able to live in luxury?\"  The answer to this question is not far to seek. Women so occupied have, as a rule, made themselves incapable of maternity. They are outcasts from society, unfortunately exerting a most harmful influence on all those who come into relation with them. Furthermore, they are centers for the dissemination of venereal diseases which wreck the health of all those who become infected. But for the uncontrolled passions of men, there would be no such women. So while we, individually, as men, may not be responsible for the ruin of any one woman, we must confess that men as a class are responsible for this condition of prostitution and clandestine intercourse. An overwhelming majority of women would, if following their inclinations, seek these relations in wedlock only and for procreation only. But many a young woman, under promise of marriage, sometimes even under a bogus marriage, is brought into a condition of hypnotism or into a mental state that puts her in the power of the man whom she loves and respects. If he deceives her and betrays her, continuing such betrayal until the victim becomes pregnant, he will, in the average case, leave her to bear her child in shame, while he slips away to other scenes of activity. We cannot wonder then, that the girl--deserted, humiliated, crushed by the one in whom she reposed absolute confidence; cast out of society, perhaps thrust from the protection of her own father's roof--gives up the struggle and says--\"_What's the use?_\"  A vast majority of such poor girls make their way to houses of ill fame and give themselves over to a life of prostitution. Hardly one of these women, if married by the man who brought her to this condition, would have failed to make a true and loving wife and mother. So society, while it casts these women out, has come to recognize that men are the real sinners in such cases.  It may be added here, that an occasional girl goes wrong through temperamental shortcomings within herself--perhaps she may even be a degenerate; but the proportion of women who would willingly and deliberately sacrifice their virtue is vanishingly small as compared with the proportion of young men who seem to be willing to sacrifice their virtue. This is probably in part due to their training. Mothers, as a rule, instruct their daughters carefully regarding their relations with boys and men. It is in part due to the instinctive and inherent purity of mind of the normal woman.  Nature has devised a retribution for illicit intercourse in the form of venereal disease. If the parties observe fidelity to the marriage vows venereal disease is experienced in wedlock only on very rare occasions, and then through some accidental infection, as from contact with some public utensils, as a public water closet, a public towel or drinking cup. So rare is this unfortunate accident, however, that we may say, that intercourse in undefiled wedlock results normally in pleasure and gratification to both parties, while intercourse out of wedlock, or illicit intercourse, is destined, as a rule, to be visited with retribution.  What form does this retribution that nature metes out to the vice of illicit intercourse take? Besides the various psychic punishments, the principal of which are remorse, and impure thoughts, there are physical punishments in the form of venereal diseases. So prevalent are these venereal diseases among lewd women, whether prostitutes or clandestines, that specialists in this field say that \"_all lewd women are diseased part of the time and some lewd women are diseased all the time_.\"  These sexual diseases are contagious--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24711"],["title","Little Prudy (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive)                         [Illustration: THE A.

Her name was Prudy Parlin, and she and her sister Susy, three years older, lived in Portland, in the State of Maine, though every summer they went to Willowbrook, to visit their grandmother.  At the very first of our story, Susy was more than six years old, and Prudy was between three and four. Susy could sew quite well for a girl of her age, and had a stint every day. Prudy always thought it very fine to do just as Susy did, so she teased her mother to let _her_ have some patchwork, too, and Mrs. Parlin gave her a few calico pieces, just to keep her little fingers out of mischief.  But when the squares were basted together, she broke needles, pricked her fingers, and made a great fuss; sometimes crying, and wishing there were no such thing as patchwork.  One morning she sat in her rocking-chair, doing what she thought was a \"_stint_.\" She kept running to her mother with every stitch, saying, \"Will that do?\" Her mother was very busy, and said, \"My little daughter must not come to me.\" So Prudy sat down near the door, and began to sew with all her might; but soon her little baby sister came along, looking so cunning, that Prudy dropped her needle, and went to hugging her.  \"O, little sister,\" cried she, \"I wouldn't have a horse come and eat you up for any thing in the world!\"  After this, of course, her mother had to get her another needle, and then thread it for her. She went to sewing again till she pricked her finger, and the sight of the wee drop of blood made her cry.  \"O, dear! I wish somebody would pity me!\" But her mother was so busy frying doughnuts that she could not stop to talk much; and the next thing she saw of Prudy she was at the farther end of the room, while her patchwork lay on the spice box.  \"Prudy, Prudy, what are you up to now?\"  \"Up to the table,\" said Prudy. \"O, mother, I'm so sorry, but I've broke a crack in the pitcher!\"  \"What will mamma do with you? You haven't finished your stint--what made you get out of your chair?\"  \"O, I thought grandma might want me to get her _speckles_. I thought I would go and find Zip too. See, mamma, he's so tickled to see me he shakes all over--every bit of him!\"  \"Where's your patchwork?\"  \"I don't know. You've got a double name, haven't you, doggie? It's Zip Coon, but it isn't a _very_ double name,--is it, mother?\"  When Mrs. Parlin had finished her doughnuts, she said, \"Pussy, you can't keep still two minutes. Now, if you want to sew this patchwork for grandma's quilt, I'll tell you what I shall do. There's an empty hogshead in the back kitchen, and I'll lift you into that, and you can't climb out. I'll lift you out when your stint is done.\"  \"O, what a funny little house,\" said Prudy, when she was inside; and as she spoke, her voice startled her--it was so loud and hollow. \"I'll talk some more,\" thought she, \"it makes such a queer noise.--'Old Mrs. Hogshead, I thought I'd come and see you, and bring my work. I like your house, ma'am, only I should think you'd want some windows. I s'pose you know who I am, Mrs. Hogshead? My name is Prudy. My mother didn't put me in here because I was a naughty girl, for I haven't done nothing--nor nothing--nor nothing. Do you want to hear some singing?      'O, come, come away,     From labor now reposin';     Let _busy Caro, wife of Barrow_,     Come, come away!'\"  \"Prudy, what's the matter?\" said mamma, from the next room.  \"Didn't you hear somebody singing?\" said Prudy; \"well, 'twas me.\"  \"O, I was afraid you were crying, my dear.\"  \"Then I'll stop,\" said the child. \"Now, Mrs. Hogshead, you won't hear me singing any more,--it _mortifies_ my mother very much.\"  So Prudy made her fingers fly, and soon said, \"Now, mamma, I've got it done, and I'm ready to be _took out_!\"  Just then her father came into the house. \"Prudy's in the hogshead,\" said Mrs. Parlin. \"Won't you please lift her out, father? I've got baby in my arms.\"  Mr. Parlin peeped into the hogshead. \"How in this world did you ever get in here, child?\" said he. \"I think I'll have to take you out with a pair of tongs.\"  Prudy laughed.  \"Give me your hands,\" said papa. \"Up she comes! Now, come sit on my knee,\" added he, when they had gone into the parlor, \"and tell me how you climbed into that hogshead.\"  \"Mother dropped me in, and I'm going to stay there till I make a bedquilt, only I'm coming out to eat, you know.\"  Mr. Parlin laughed; but just then the dinner bell rang, and when they went to the table, Prudy was soon so busy with her roasted chicken and custard pie that she forgot all about the patchwork.     CHAPTER II  PRUDY GOING UP TO HEAVEN   Prudy soon tired of sewing, and her mother said, laughing, \"If grandma Read has to wait for somebody's little fingers before she gets a bedquilt, poor grandma will sleep very cold indeed.\"  The calico pieces went into the rag-bag, and that was the last of Prudy's patchwork.  One day the children wanted to go and play in the \"new house,\" which was not quite done. Mrs. Parlin was almost afraid little Prudy might get hurt, for there were a great many loose boards and tools lying about, and the carpenters, who were at work on the house, had all gone away to see some soldiers. But at last she said they might go if Susy would be very careful of her little sister.  I dare say Susy meant to watch Prudy with great care, but after a while she got to thinking of something else. The little one wanted to play \"catch,\" but Susy saw a great deal more sport in building block houses.  \"Now I know ever so much more than you do,\" said Susy. \"I used to wash dishes and scour knives when I was four years old, and that was the time I learned you to walk, Prudy; so you ought to play with me, and be goody.\"  \"Then I will; but them blocks is too big, Susy. If I had _a axe_ I'd chop 'em: I'll go get _a axe_.\" Little Prudy trotted off, and Susy never looked up from her play, and did not notice that she was gone a long while.  By and by Mrs. Parlin thought she would go and see what the children were doing; so she put on her bonnet and went over to the \"new house.\" Susy was still busy with her blocks, but she looked up at the sound of her mother's footsteps.  \"Where is Prudy?\" said Mrs. Parlin, glancing around.  \"I'm 'most up to heaven,\" cried a little voice overhead.  They looked, and what did they see? Prudy herself standing on the highest beam of the house! She had climbed three ladders to get there. Her mother had heard her say the day before that \"she didn't want to shut up her eyes and die, and be all deaded up--she meant to have her hands and face clean, and go up to heaven on a ladder.\"  \"O,\" thought the poor mother, \"she is surely on the way to heaven, for she can never get down alive. My darling, my darling!\"  Poor Susy's first thought was to call out to Prudy, but her mother gave her one warning glance, and that was enough: Susy neither spoke nor stirred.  Mrs. Parlin stood looking up at her--stood as white and still as if she had been frozen! Her trembling lips moved a little, but it was in prayer; she knew that only God could save the precious one.  While she was begging Him to tell her what to do, a sudden thought flashed across her mind. She dared not speak, lest the sound of her voice should startle the child; but she had a bunch of keys in her pocket, and she jingled the keys, holding them up as high as possible, that Prudy might see what they were.  When the little one heard the jingling, she looked down and smiled. \"You goin' to let me have some cake and 'serves in the china closet, me and Susy?\"  Mrs. Parlin smiled--such a smile! It was a great deal sadder than tears, though Prudy did not know that--she only knew that it meant \"yes.\"  \"O, then I'm coming right down, 'cause I like cake and 'serves. I won't go up to heaven till _bime-by_!\"  Then "]]]
