A Highwayman's Wife, like a Soldier's, hath as little of his Pay, as of his Company.  _Peachum._ And had not you the common Views of a Gentlewoman in your Marriage, _Polly_?  _Polly._ I don't know what you mean, Sir.  _Peachum._ Of a Jointure, and of being a Widow.  _Polly._ But I love him, Sir; how then could I have Thoughts of parting with him?  _Peachum._ Parting with him! Why, this is the whole Scheme and Intention of all Marriage-Articles. The comfortable Estate of Widow-hood, is the only Hope that keeps up a Wife's Spirits. Where is the Woman who would scruple to be a Wife, if she had it in her Power to be a Widow, whenever she pleas'd? If you have any Views of this sort, _Polly_, I shall think the Match not so very unreasonable.  _Polly._ How I dread to hear your Advice! Yet I must beg you to explain yourself.  _Peachum._ Secure what he hath got, have him peach'd the next Sessions, and then at once you are made a rich Widow.  _Polly._ What, murder the Man I love! The Blood runs cold at my Heart with the very thought of it.  _Peachum._ Fie, _Polly_! What hath Murder to do in the Affair? Since the thing sooner or later must happen, I dare say, the Captain himself would like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a Stranger. Why, _Polly_, the Captain knows, that as 'tis his Employment to rob, so 'tis ours to take Robbers; every Man in his Business. So that there is no Malice in the Case.  _Mrs. Peachum._ Ay, Husband, now you have nick'd the Matter. To have him peach'd is the only thing could ever make me forgive her.   AIR XII. Now ponder well, ye Parents dear.  [Music]    _Polly._ O ponder well! be not severe;     So save a wretched Wife!   For on the Rope that hangs my Dear     Depends poor _Polly's_ Life.  _Mrs. Peachum._ But your Duty to your Parents, Hussy, obliges you to hang him. What would many a Wife give for such an Opportunity!  _Polly._ What is a Jointure, what is Widow-hood to me? I know my Heart. I cannot survive him.   AIR XIII. Le printems rapelle aux armes.  [Music]    The Turtle thus with plaintive Crying,       Her Lover dying,   The Turtle thus with plaintive Crying,       Laments her Dove.   Down she drops quite spent with Sighing.   Pair'd in Death, as pair'd in Love.  Thus, Sir, it will happen to your poor _Polly_.  _Mrs. Peachum._ What, is the Fool in Love in earnest then? I hate thee for being particular: Why, Wench, thou art a Shame to thy very Sex.  _Polly._ But hear me, Mother. --If you ever lov'd--  _Mrs. Peachum._ Those cursed Play-Books she reads have been her Ruin. One Word more, Hussy, and I shall knock your Brains out, if you have any.  _Peachum._ Keep out of the way, _Polly_, for fear of Mischief, and consider of what is proposed to you.  _Mrs. Peachum._ Away, Hussy. Hang your Husband, and be dutiful.      [Exit _Polly_.    Re-enter _Polly_, and listens behind column.  _Mrs. Peachum._ The Thing, Husband, must and shall be done. For the sake of Intelligence we must take other measures, and have him peached the next Session without her Consent. If she will not know her Duty, we know ours.  _Peachum._ But really, my Dear, it grieves one's Heart to take off a great Man. When I consider his Personal Bravery, his fine Stratagem, how much we have already got by him, and how much more we may get, methinks I can't find in my Heart to have a hand in his Death. I wish you could have made _Polly_ undertake it.  _Mrs. Peachum._ But in a Case of Necessity-- our own Lives are in danger.  _Peachum._ Then, indeed, we must comply with the Customs of the World, and make Gratitude give way to Interest. --He shall be taken off.  _Mrs. Peachum._ I'll undertake to manage _Polly_.  _Peachum._ And I'll prepare Matters for the _Old-Baily_.      [Exeunt severally.  _Polly._ Now I'm a Wretch, indeed. --Methinks I see him already in the Cart, sweeter and more lovely than the Nosegay in his Hand! --I hear the Crowd extolling his Resolution and Intrepidity! --What Vollies of Sighs are sent from the Windows of _Holborn_, that so comely a Youth should be brought to Disgrace! --I see him at the Tree! The whole Circle are in Tears! --even Butchers weep! --_Jack Ketch_ himself hesitates to perform his Duty, and would be glad to lose his Fee, by a Reprieve. What then will become of _Polly_! --As yet I may inform him of their Design, and aid him in his Escape. --It shall be so-- But then he flies, absents himself, and I bar myself from his dear dear Conversation! That too will distract me. --If he keep out of the way, my Papa and Mama may in time relent, and we may be happy. --If he stays, he is hang'd, and then he is lost for ever! --He intended to lie conceal'd in my Room, 'till the Dusk of the Evening: If they are abroad I'll this Instant let him out, lest some Accident should prevent him.      [Exit, and returns with _Macheath_.   _Macheath._  AIR XIV. Pretty Parrot, say--  [Music]      _Macheath._ Pretty _Polly_, say,     When I was away,   Did your fancy never stray     To some newer Lover?        _Polly._ Without Disguise,       Heaving Sighs,       Doting Eyes,   My constant Heart discover.     Fondly let me loll!      _Macheath._ O pretty, pretty _Poll_.  _Polly._ And are _you_ as fond as ever, my Dear?  _Macheath._ Suspect my Honour, my Courage, suspect any thing but my Love. --May my Pistols miss Fire, and my Mare slip her Shoulder while I am pursu'd, if I ever forsake thee!  _Polly._ Nay, my Dear, I have no Reason to doubt you, for I find in the Romance you lent me, none of the great Heroes were ever false in Love.   AIR XV. Pray, Fair one, be kind--  [Music]      _Macheath._ My Heart was so free,     It rov'd like the Bee,   'Till _Polly_ my Passion requited;     I sipt each Flower,     I chang'd every Hour,   But here every Flower is united.  _Polly._ Were you sentenc'd to Transportation, sure, my Dear, you could not leave me behind you-- could you?  _Macheath._ Is there any Power, any Force that could tear me from thee? You might sooner tear a Pension out of the Hands of a Courtier, a Fee from a Lawyer, a pretty Woman from a Looking-glass, or any Woman from Quadrille. --But to tear me from thee is impossible!   AIR XVI. Over the Hills and far away.  [Music]    Were I laid on _Greenland's_ Coast,   And in my Arms embrac'd my Lass;   Warm amidst eternal Frost,   Too soon the Half Year's Night would pass.    _Polly._ Were I sold on _Indian_ Soil,   Soon as the burning Day was clos'd,   I could mock the sultry Toil   When on my Charmer's Breast repos'd.    _Macheath._ And I would love you all the Day,    _Polly._ Every Night would kiss and play,    _Macheath._ If with me you'd fondly stray    _Polly._ Over the Hills and far away.  _Polly._ Yes, I would go with thee. But oh! --how shall I speak it? I must be torn from thee. We must part.  _Macheath._ How! Part!  _Polly._ We must, we must. --My Papa and Mama are set against thy Life. They now, even now are in Search after thee. They are preparing Evidence against thee. Thy Life depends upon a moment.   AIR XVII. Gin thou wert mine awn thing--  [Music]    Oh what Pain it is to part!   Can I leave thee, can I leave thee?   O what pain it is to part!   Can thy _Polly_ ever leave thee?   But lest Death my Love should thwart,   And bring thee to the fatal Cart,   Thus I tear thee from my bleeding Heart!     Fly hence, and let me leave thee.  One Kiss and then-- one Kiss-- be gone-- farewel.  _Macheath._ My Hand, my Heart, my Dear, is so riveted to thine, that I cannot unloose my Hold.  _Polly._ But my Papa may intercept thee, and then I should lose the very glimmering of Hope. A few Weeks, perhaps, may reconcile us all. Shall thy _Polly_ hear from thee?  _Macheath._ Must I then go?  _Polly._ And will not Absence change your Love?  _Macheath._ If you doubt it, let me stay-- and be hang'd.  _Polly._ O how I fear! how I tremble! --Go-- but when Safety will give you leave, you will be sure to see me again; for 'till then _Polly_ is wretched.   AIR XVIII. O the Broom, &c.  [Music]    _Macheath._ The Miser thus a Shilling sees,     Which he's oblig'd to pay,   With sighs resigns it by degrees,     And fears 'tis gone for ay.      [Parting, and looking back at each other with fondness; he at one     Door, she at the other.    _Polly._ The Boy, thus, when his Sparrow's flown,     The Bird in Silence eyes;   But soon as out of Sight 'tis gone,     Whines, whimpers, sobs and cries.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]   ACT II. SCENE I.  _A TAVERN near _Newgate_._    _Jemmy Twitcher_, _Crook-finger'd Jack_, _Wat Dreary_, _Robin of   Bagshot_, _Nimming Ned_, _Henry Paddington_, _Matt of the Mint_,   _Ben Budge_, and the rest of the Gang, at the Table, with Wine,   Brandy and Tobacco.  _Ben._ But pr'ythee, _Matt_, what is become of thy Brother _Tom_? I have not seen him since my Return from Transportation.  _Matt._ Poor Brother _Tom_ had an Accident this time Twelve-month, and so clever a made fellow he was, that I could not save him from those fleaing Rascals the Surgeons; and now, poor Man, he is among the Otamys at _Surgeons Hall_.  _Ben._ So it seems, his Time was come.  _Jemmy._ But the present Time is ours, and no body alive hath more. Why are the Laws levell'd at us? are we more dishonest than the rest of Mankind? What we win, Gentlemen, is our own by the Law of Arms, and the Right of Conquest.  _Crook._ Where shall we find such another Set of Practical Philosophers, who to a Man are above the Fear of Death?  _Wat._ Sound Men, and true!  _Robin._ Of try'd Courage, and indefatigable Industry!  _Ned._ Who is there here that would not die for his Friend?  _Harry._ Who is there here that would betray him for his Interest?  _Matt._ Shew me a Gang of Courtiers that can say as much.  _Ben._ We are for a just Partition of the World, for every Man hath a Right to enjoy Life.  _Matt._ We retrench the Superfluities of Mankind."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],["title","The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#5)"],["body"," The World is avaritious, and I hate Avarice. A covetous fellow, like a Jackdaw, steals what he was never made to enjoy, for the sake of hiding it. These are the Robbers of Mankind, for Money was made for the Free-hearted and Generous, and where is the Injury of taking from another, what he hath not the Heart to make use of?  _Jemmy._ Our several Stations for the Day are fixt. Good luck attend us all. Fill the Glasses.   AIR XIX. Fill every Glass, &c.  [Music]    _Matt._ Fill every Glass, for Wine inspires us,     And fires us   With Courage, Love and Joy.   Women and Wine should life employ.   Is there ought else on Earth desirous?    _Chorus._ Fill every Glass, &c.  _To them enter _Macheath_._  _Macheath._ Gentlemen, well met. My Heart hath been with you this Hour; but an unexpected Affair hath detain'd me. No Ceremony, I beg you.  _Matt._ We were just breaking up to go upon Duty. Am I to have the Honour of taking the Air with you, Sir, this Evening upon the Heath? I drink a Dram now and then with the Stagecoachmen in the way of Friendship and Intelligence; and I know that about this Time there will be Passengers upon the Western Road, who are worth speaking with.  _Macheath._ I was to have been of that Party-- but--  _Matt._ But what, Sir?  _Macheath._ Is there any Man who suspects my Courage?  _Matt._ We have all been Witnesses of it.  _Macheath._ My Honour and Truth to the Gang?  _Matt._ I'll be answerable for it.  _Macheath._ In the Division of our Booty, have I ever shewn the least Marks of Avarice or Injustice?  _Matt._ By these Questions something seems to have ruffled you. Are any of us suspected?  _Macheath._ I have a fixed Confidence, Gentlemen, in you all, as Men of Honour, and as such I value and respect you. _Peachum_ is a Man that is useful to us.  _Matt._ Is he about to play us any foul Play? I'll shoot him through the Head.  _Macheath._ I beg you, Gentlemen, act with Conduct and Discretion. A Pistol is your last Resort.  _Matt._ He knows nothing of this Meeting.  _Macheath._ Business cannot go on without him. He is a Man who knows the World, and is a necessary Agent to us. We have had a slight Difference, and 'till it is accommodated I shall be oblig'd to keep out of his way. Any private Dispute of mine shall be of no ill consequence to my Friends. You must continue to act under his Direction, for the moment we break loose from him, our Gang is ruin'd.  _Matt._ As a Bawd to a Whore, I grant you, he is to us of great Convenience.  _Macheath._ Make him believe I have quitted the Gang, which I can never do but with Life. At our private Quarters I will continue to meet you. A Week or so will probably reconcile us.  _Matt._ Your Instructions shall be observ'd. 'Tis now high time for us to repair to our several Duties; so 'till the Evening at our Quarters in Moor-Fields we bid you farewel.  _Macheath._ I shall wish myself with you. Success attend you.      [Sits down melancholy at the Table.   AIR XX. March in _Rinaldo_, with Drums and Trumpets.  [Music]    _Matt._ Let us take the Road.     Hark! I hear the Sound of Coaches!     The Hour of Attack approaches,   To your Arms, brave Boys, and load.     See the Ball I hold!   Let the Chymists toil like Asses,   Our Fire their Fire surpasses,     And turns all our Lead to Gold.      [The Gang, rang'd in the Front of the Stage, load their Pistols,     and stick them under their Girdles; then go off singing the first     Part in Chorus.  _Macheath._ What a Fool is a fond Wench! _Polly_ is most confoundedly bit. --I love the Sex. And a Man who loves Money, might as well be contented with one Guinea, as I with one Woman. The Town perhaps have been as much obliged to me, for recruiting it with free-hearted Ladies, as to any Recruiting Officer in the Army. If it were not for us, and the other Gentlemen of the Sword, _Drury-Lane_ would be uninhabited.   AIR XXI. Would you have a young Virgin, &c.  [Music]    If the Heart of a Man is deprest with Cares,   The Mist is dispell'd when a Woman appears;   Like the Notes of a Fiddle, she sweetly, sweetly   Raises the Spirits, and charms our Ears,   Roses and Lilies her Cheeks disclose,   But her ripe Lips are more sweet than those.     Press her,     Caress her,     With Blisses,     Her Kisses   Dissolve us in Pleasure, and soft Repose.  I must have Women. There is nothing unbends the Mind like them. Money is not so strong a Cordial for the Time. Drawer-- [Enter Drawer.] Is the Porter gone for all the Ladies according to my Directions?  _Drawer._ I expect him back every Minute. But you know, Sir, you sent him as far as _Hockley in the Hole_ for three of the Ladies, for one in _Vinegar-Yard_, and for the rest of them somewhere about _Lewkner's-Lane_. Sure some of them are below, for I hear the Bar-Bell. As they come I will shew them up. Coming, Coming.    Enter Mrs. _Coaxer_, _Dolly Trull_, Mrs. _Vixen_, _Betty Doxy_, _Jenny Diver_, Mrs. _Slammekin_, _Suky Tawdry_, and _Molly Brazen_.  _Macheath._ Dear Mrs. _Coaxer_, you are welcome. You look charmingly to-day. I hope you don't want the Repairs of Quality, and lay on Paint. --_Dolly Trull!_ kiss me, you Slut; are you as amorous as ever, Hussy? You are always so taken up with stealing Hearts, that you don't allow yourself Time to steal any thing else. --Ah _Dolly_, thou wilt ever be a Coquette! Mrs. _Vixen_, I'm yours, I always lov'd a Woman of Wit and Spirit; they make charming Mistresses, but plaguy Wives-- _Betty Doxy!_ Come hither, Hussy. Do you drink as hard as ever? You had better stick to good wholesom Beer; for in troth, _Betty_, Strong-Waters will in time ruin your Constitution. You should leave those to your Betters. --What! and my pretty _Jenny Diver_ too! As prim and demure as ever! There is not any Prude, though ever so high bred, hath a more sanctify'd Look, with a more mischievous Heart. Ah! thou art a dear artful Hypocrite. --Mrs. _Slammekin!_ as careless and genteel as ever! all you fine Ladies, who know your own Beauty, affect an Undress. --But see, here's _Suky Tawdry_ come to contradict what I was saying. Every thing she gets one way she lays out upon her Back. Why, _Suky_, you must keep at least a Dozen Tallymen. _Molly Brazen!_ [She kisses him.] That's well done. I love a free-hearted Wench. Thou hast a most agreeable Assurance, Girl, and art as willing as a Turtle. --But hark! I hear Music. The Harper is at the Door. _If Music be the Food of Love, play on._ Ere you seat yourselves, Ladies, what think you of a Dance? Come in. [Enter Harper.] Play the _French_ Tune, that Mrs. _Slammekin_ was so fond of.      [A Dance _a la ronde_ in the _French_ manner; near the end of it     this song and Chorus.   AIR XXII. Cotillon.  [Music]      Youth's the Season made for Joys,       Love is then our Duty,     She alone who that employs,       Well deserves her Beauty.         Let's be gay,         While we may,   Beauty's a Flower, despis'd in Decay.     Youth's the Season, &c.      Let us drink and sport to-day,       Ours is not to-morrow.     Love with Youth flies swift away,       Age is nought but Sorrow.         Dance and sing,         Time's on the Wing.   Life never knows the Return of Spring.    _Chorus._ Let us drink, &c.  _Macheath._ Now, pray Ladies, take your Places. Here Fellow. [Pays the Harper.] Bid the Drawer bring us more Wine. [Exit Harper.] If any of the Ladies choose Ginn, I hope they will be so free to call for it.  _Jenny._ You look as if you meant me. Wine is strong enough for me. Indeed, Sir, I never drink Strong-Waters, but when I have the Cholic.  _Macheath._ Just the Excuse of the fine Ladies! Why, a Lady of Quality is never without the Cholic. I hope, Mrs. _Coaxer_, you have had good Success of late in your Visits among the Mercers.  _Mrs. Coaxer._ We have so many Interlopers-- Yet with Industry, one may still have a little Picking. I carried a silver-flowered Lutestring, and a Piece of black Padesoy to Mr. _Peachum's_ Lock but last Week.  _Mrs. Vixen._ There's _Molly Brazen_ hath the Ogle of a Rattle-Snake. She rivetted a Linen-Draper's Eye so fast upon her, that he was nick'd of three Pieces of Cambric before he could look off.  _Brazen._ Oh dear Madam! --But sure nothing can come up to your handling of Laces! And then you have such a sweet deluding Tongue! To cheat a Man is nothing; but the Woman must have fine Parts indeed who cheats a Woman.  _Mrs. Vixen._ Lace, Madam, lies in a small Compass, and is of easy Conveyance. But you are apt, Madam, to think too well of your Friends.  _Mrs. Coaxer._ If any woman hath more Art than another, to be sure, 'tis _Jenny Diver_. Though her Fellow be never so agreeable, she can pick his Pocket as coolly, as if money were her only Pleasure. Now that is a Command of the Passions uncommon in a Woman!  _Jenny._ I never go to the Tavern with a Man, but in the View of Business. I have other Hours, and other sort of Men for my Pleasure. But had I your Address, Madam--  _Macheath._ Have done with your Compliments, Ladies; and drink about: You are not so fond of me, _Jenny_, as you use to be.  _Jenny._ 'Tis not convenient, Sir, to shew my Fondness among so many Rivals. 'Tis your own Choice, and not the Warmth of my Inclination that will determine you.   AIR XXIII. All in a misty Morning, &c.  [Music]    Before the Barn-Door crowing,     The Cock by Hens attended,   His Eyes around him throwing,     Stands for a while suspended.    Then One he singles from the Crew,     And cheers the happy Hen;   With how do you do, and how do you do,     And how do you do again.  _Macheath._ Ah _Jenny!_ thou art a dear Slut.  _Jenny._ A Man of Courage should never put any thing to the Risk but his Life. These are the Tools of a Man of Honour. Cards and Dice are only fit for cowardly Cheats, who prey upon their Friends.      [She takes up his Pistol. _Tawdry_ takes up the other.  _Tawdry._ This, Sir, is fitter for your Hand. Besides your Loss of Money, 'tis a Loss to the Ladies. Gaming takes you off from Women."]]]
