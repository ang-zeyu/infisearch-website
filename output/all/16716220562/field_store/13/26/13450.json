Captain Trevanion laughed confidently.  He felt certain of victory now, and regarded the match as a walk over.  \"Five down is a big handicap,\" said Bob.  \"Still the match is young yet.\"  \"He's had beastly luck at the last two holes,\" grumbled Dick Tresize, who was evidently deeply chagrined.  The next hole was halved in bogey.  Bob got his four easily, but Trevanion only halved his by a long and uncertain putt.  \"Five up at the sixth,\" shouted the Admiral.  \"Come, Bob, that's better, you've halved a hole at last.\"  Bob said nothing, but cast a look at Nancy, who was pale with excitement.  He could see how anxious she was, and noted the confident air with which Trevanion approached the next tee.  Although his position seemed almost hopeless, a feeling of confidence came into his heart.  He had measured his opponent by this time, and he knew he had got to his old mastery of his clubs.  He felt sure, too, that he could play the stronger game, even although he had lost hole after hole in succession.  Trevanion again drove, but this time his ball was off the line and landed in a huge basin of sand.  Bob's, on the other hand, was perfectly straight.  It carried the bunker a hundred and forty yards from the tee, and was well on its way to the green.  As a consequence, although the bogey was five, Bob did it in four and won the hole.  \"You played that well, Nancarrow,\" said Trevanion.  \"The wind helped me,\" replied Bob.  The next hole was also a five bogey; but again Bob, who reached the green in two, got out in four, while Trevanion took five.  He had reduced the difference between them to three.  The ninth hole was halved.  \"Three up at the turn for the Army,\" shouted the Admiral.  The tenth hole, as all who have played on the Leiant Links know, is very difficult.  If the player has a long drive, he can, if he has a good second, land on the green in two; but in order to do so he has to carry a very difficult piece of country, which, if he gets into it, is generally fatal.  Bob's drive was short, and it seemed impossible for him to carry the tremendous hazard with his second shot.  Trevanion, on the other hand, was in an easy position.  When he saw Bob's short drive he laughed contentedly.  \"I'm wanting my tea badly,\" he said to Nancy.  \"That's a pity,\" replied the girl.  \"It'll take another hour to play the next nine holes.\"  \"It looks as though the match will be over before then,\" he replied confidently.  \"I'll bet you a box of chocolates that we shall finish at the fourteenth.\"  \"Done!\" cried the girl, and there was a flash of anger in her eyes.  \"Of course Bob'll have to play short here,\" grumbled Dick Tresize.  \"He ought to have insisted on Trevanion giving him strokes.  By George, he's surely not going to be such a fool as to risk a brassy!\"  The next minute there was great cheering.  Bob's ball had surely mounted all difficulties and apparently landed on the green.  \"A magnificent shot!\" cried the Admiral.  \"By gad, Bob, but Vardon couldn't have done it better!\"  It was easy to see that Trevanion was annoyed as well as surprised at Bob's shot.  The bogey for the hole was five, and Bob had to all appearance made a four possible by a very fine brassy shot.  Trevanion had driven thirty yards further than Bob, but he had still a big sand-hill, covered with long grass, to carry.  Whether Bob's shot had made him fear that, after being five up, he might yet be beaten, it is impossible to say, certain it is that he missed his ball, and Bob won the hole.  \"Military down to two,\" cried the Admiral.  \"It's going to be a close match, after all.\"  The rest of the spectators became silent; they felt that things were becoming serious, and that they must not talk, especially as Trevanion had looked angrily at some one who had spoken as he was addressing his ball for the next drive.  The eleventh and the twelfth holes were halved, and so the game stood at two up for Trevanion and six to play.  \"I've won my box of chocolates, Captain Trevanion,\" Nancy could not help saying, as they walked to the thirteenth tee.  \"Even if you win the next two holes you can only be dormy at the fourteenth.\"  \"I shall buy the chocolates with all the pleasure in the world,\" replied the Captain.  \"You see, I didn't reckon on that brassy of Nancarrow's at the tenth.\"  \"I think you are going to have an expensive afternoon,\" she laughed.  Bob, who still retained the honour, addressed his ball.  A strong cross wind was blowing, but he made up his mind to carry the green, although it was considerably over two hundred yards, and guarded by a high mound.  If he could do so he stood a good chance of a three, and might rob his opponent of another hole.  He hit the ball clean and true, and as it left his club the spectators gave a gasp.  It looked as though it would strike the guiding-post, but to the relief of all, and especially of Nancy, it rose a foot above it, and was soon lost to sight.  \"By gosh, Bob, I believe you've driven the green!\" said Dick to Bob, in a whisper.  \"If you have, you stand a good chance.  You drive a longer ball than Trevanion.\"  It was easy to see by the change that had come over the Captain's face that he was becoming anxious.  He hit his ball with perfect precision, but it dropped on the tee side of the high mound.  Dick Tresize turned towards the green.  \"You are on, old chap,\" he said, as his friend came up.  \"It's at the corner of the green, but you should do it.\"  Trevanion played a good approach shot, and then Bob laid his approach putt dead.  His three was safe.  If Trevanion could not hole out, there would be but one hole between them.  Trevanion did his best, but the ball did not reach the hole by a few inches, and was not quite straight.  \"The Army down to one,\" said the Admiral.  By this time several people had been attracted by the news of the match, and among the new spectators was an amiable-looking gentleman who wore large, round spectacles.  He had been seemingly much impressed by Bob's last drive, and had loudly expressed himself to that effect.  \"I tell you,\" he said, \"I haf seen Vardon, and Braid, and all ze rest of zem play, but I neffer saw a finer shot, neffer.  It vas great.\"  He spoke so loudly that, when they were walking to the fourteenth tee, Trevanion, who was slightly ruffled, said:  \"Excuse me, sir, but if you knew the etiquette of golf, you would know that it is bad form to talk while people are playing.\"  The stranger lifted his hat, and bowed profoundly.  \"I apologise, sir,\" he said; \"nothing was further from my mind than to interfere with your play.  I vill take much care not to offend again.  I hope I did not offend you, sir,\" he added, bowing to Bob.  \"Not the slightest,\" replied Bob.  The stranger bowed again, and from that time was silent, although he followed the party at a distance.  The next three holes were halved, and there remained but two more to play.  Bob was very quiet, Trevanion looked grim and determined, the colour came and went on Nancy's face.  It seemed to her as though Bob's future and her own depended on the result of the next few minutes.  \"One up to the Military, and two to play,\" cried the Admiral.  \"If you halve this, you'll be dormy, Captain Trevanion,\" said George Tresize, who seemed very anxious for him to win.  The Captain did not reply.  Evidently he was in no mood for talk; as for the rest of the crowd, a deadly silence rested on it.  Like nearly all the holes on the Leiant Links, the seventeenth is blind, although it is just possible to see the top of the flag.  It is not an easy hole to play, as I know to my cost.  The green is guarded on the right by a hedge, which if you get over it, makes your case desperate.  If you go too far, you are caught by a bunker; while if you play to the left, the ground is so hummocky, that it is very difficult to lay your ball dead.  That is why, although the hole is barely two hundred yards long, the committee have given it a four bogey.  Bob took an iron, and played straight for the pin.  \"Good shot, but a bit short, I'm afraid,\" whispered Dick, as Bob stood aside for Trevanion to drive.  Trevanion also hit his ball clean, but it was a trifle to the left.  A little later they saw that both balls were on the green, although Bob's was several yards the nearer. Trevanion examined the ground carefully.  He felt that much depended on the approach putt.  If he laid himself dead, he was sure he could not be beaten.  Every one stood breathless while the ball ran over the hummocky ground.  \"By gosh, it's too merry!\" gasped George Tresize.  But he had not accounted for a steep ascent.  The ball rested less than two feet from the hole; Trevanion's three was safe.  Bob also carefully examined his ground, and then played his ball.  It went to the lip of the hole, and then half-hanging over, stopped.  For a second the little company held its breath, and then gave a gasp.  The ball fell in.  \"Beastly fluke!\" muttered Trevanion, between his set teeth.  \"A great putt!\" cried Dick.  \"All square and one to play,\" cried the Admiral.  Bob felt his heart bound as he addressed the ball for the last drive. What if after all he should miss it!  A mist hung before his eyes.  But no, he would not miss, and a second later he watched the ball as it soared over the hazard.  Trevanion's was only a few yards behind.  It required but a chip shot to reach the green, which lay in a hollow just over a turf-grown hedge, and guarded by a bunker.  They had now reached the final stage of the game.  One shot might win or lose the match.  Evidently Trevanion realised this as he took his mashie.  More than one saw his cigarette tremble between his lips; there could be no doubt that he was greatly excited.  Perhaps his nerves played him tricks, or perhaps in his anxiety he looked up before he hit his ball.  Anyhow he missed it, and he found himself badly bunkered.  Bob's chance had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25152"],["title","All for a Scrap of Paper: A Romance of the Present War (#7)"],["body",", and he took advantage of it.  His ball pitched over the hedge, and then rolled towards the hole.  He had a possible three.  Trevanion, on the other hand, failed to get out of the bunker at the first shot, and got too far with the second.  Bob had won the match.  \"Jolly hard luck, getting into the bunker, Trevanion,\" he said; but the other did not speak.  For the moment he was too chagrined.  \"Nancarrow wins the match on the last green; now for tea,\" shouted the Admiral.  \"Bob, my boy, you've played a great game.  I congratulate you.\"  \"A very fine game, Nancarrow,\" said Trevanion, who, like the sportsman he was, had got over his disappointment.  \"You played the last fourteen holes like a book.\"  \"Pardon me,\" said a voice, \"I hope I shall not be considered to indrude, but may I alzo congratulate you, sir.  I am not English, I am sorry to say, but I take advantage of the _Entente Cordiale_.  You haf given me much pleasure in watching you.\"  The stranger bowed as he spoke, and produced his card.  \"Allow me,\" he continued, as he presented it to Bob.  \"Thank you, Count von Weimer,\" replied Bob, as he read the card.  \"It is very kind of you.\"  \"Forgive me as a stranger in speaking to you,\" went on the Count, \"but I felt I must.  Never haf I seen such a feat of skill, and I cannot be silent.  I take advantage of the _Entente Cordiale_.  I bear a German name, but I am from Alsace, and my heart beats warm to you and your country,\" then with another bow he walked away.  \"Who is that old buffer?\" asked Dick.  \"You know as much about him as I,\" replied Bob; \"evidently he wanted to be friendly.\"  \"What did you say he was called?\" asked the Admiral.  \"Count von Weimer, Château Villar, Alsace, and Continental Club, London,\" said Bob, reading the card.  \"Von Weimer is a good name,\" said the Admiral, \"and the Continental is a good club; I've been there several times.  I shall be civil to him if I meet him again.  But now for tea.  By Jove, Trevanion, but the boy has given you a twisting!\"  \"Oh, Bob, I am glad!\" whispered Nancy, as they went towards the Club House.  \"At one time I--I; oh, Bob, I _am_ glad you've beaten him.\"  \"So am I,\" replied Bob, \"but I'm not thinking so much about the golf.\"  \"Now for tea,\" said Trevanion, with a laugh.  \"You've won on this field of battle, but in the next my turn will come.\"     CHAPTER V  Bob was in great spirits at tea that day.  He had won his match, and proved himself a stronger player than Trevanion.  Nancy, who sat by his side, was radiant with smiles, while evidently the Admiral looked on him with greater favour than ever before.  \"A remarkable feat, my boy,\" he said again and again.  \"To be five down to a man like Trevanion, and then to beat him, means not only skill, but nerve.  That's the thing I like about it--the nerve, the pluck.\"  \"A game is never lost until it's won, sir,\" said Bob sententiously.  \"That's it, my boy.  Stick to that.  What did I hear about your plan to go into Parliament?  Do you mean it?\"  \"If I have good luck, sir.\"  \"A great career, my lad, and you should do well.  I am so glad you've given up the idea of being a book-worm.  Of course your scholarship will come handy to you in Parliament, so perhaps you've been wise to stick to your books.  But the country wants men who can _do_ things.\"  \"I mean to do them too, sir.\"  \"Trelawney blood,\" laughed the old man.  \"Well, there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't do big things.  I always had hoped that Roger would go into Parliament; indeed, he was as good as nominated for St. Ia.  But he was killed in the Boer War, poor fellow.  A fine lad too, as fine a lad as ever stepped in shoeleather,\" and his eyes became moist.  \"Thank God we are at peace now!\" he added.  \"You are coming back with me to Penwennack?\" he went on, when presently the party were leaving the Club House.  \"I'd love to, sir, but I can't.  I must get back.  I promised mother.\"  \"Ah well, stick to your mother.  A lad who keeps his promise to his mother seldom goes wrong.  But come up to dinner to-morrow night, and bring your mother with you.\"  \"You may depend on me,\" cried Bob.  \"Thanks very much, Admiral, we shall be delighted.\"  \"Bob,\" said Nancy, \"you've done more to soften dad to-day, and to prepare the way for me, than if you had got ten fellowships.  He loves a plucky fight, and hates a coward.\"  \"And I'll fight,\" cried Bob, \"because I shall fighting for you, Nancy.\"  \"I wish you were going to spend the evening with us,\" she said ruefully.  \"I do want you with me.\"  \"And don't I wish it too!  But I told you how things stood.  Till to-morrow then.\"  \"Be sure to come early,\" cried Nancy, as she drove away.  Bob made his way over the Towans towards St. Ia, as happy as a king. Everywhere the sun seemed to be shining.  At his feet the wild thyme grew in profusion.  Acres upon acres were made purple by this modest flower.  The sea was glorious with many coloured hues, the whole country-side was beautiful beyond words.  What wonder that he was happy!  He was young and vigorous, the best and most beautiful girl in the world loved him, and his future was rosy hued.  In order to reach his mother's house, he had to pass through St. Ia, and he had barely entered the little town when he saw Count von Weimer, who had expressed his congratulations so fervently on the golf links.  \"Ah, this is lucky!\" cried the Count.  \"I was wondering if I should haf the good fortune to meet you again.  May I walk with you?  That is goot!\"  \"You are a stranger to St. Ia,\" said Bob.  \"Yes.  I have been drawn here by the beauty of the place, and--and because I want peace.\"  He still spoke in broken English, although I will no longer try to reproduce it.  \"You love peace?\" Bob ventured.  \"Love it!  Ah, young sir, you little know.  I am one of those unfortunate men who are placed in an awful position.  I am, although I bear a German name, French on my mother's side.  I love France too, and am at heart a Frenchman.  But then my house is in Alsace--Alsace, you understand.  France under German Government.  I can say here, what I could not say there.  I hate Germany, I hate her government, her militarism, her arrogance.  The Germans suspect my loyalty, and so I have come to England.\"  \"And you like England?\"  \"Ah, who can help loving it?  Your British flag means liberty, wherever it flies.  It stands for peace, brotherhood, progress.  That is why I think of buying a house near St. Ia, and settling down.  Realising my position in Alsace, you can understand.  Besides, what can be more beautiful than this?\" and he waved his hand toward the sunlit bay.  \"Yes, it's the most beautiful spot on earth!\" cried Bob.  \"It is indeed, and I love its peace.  I love the quiet ways of the people.  I saw a house yesterday which captivated, charmed me. Tre-Trelyon, yes, that's it; Trelyon, I was told it was called, and I hear it is for sale, or to let, I don't know which.\"  \"Yes, it is, and it is one of the finest places in the district.  Why, it belongs to Admiral Tresize, whom perhaps you saw on the links this afternoon.\"  \"What, that stout, hearty, John Bull gentleman?  Oh, yes, I saw him! What a splendid specimen of your British thoroughness.  It belongs to him, eh?\"  \"Yes, it formerly belonged to his wife's family, the Trelyons.  I'm sure he'd be glad of a good tenant.\"  \"Ah, but that is pleasant.  I could perhaps deal with him personally? I am, I suppose, what you would call a rich man, but I hate dealing with agents, and lawyers, and that kind of thing.  He is--friendly, this, what do you call him, Admiral----\"  \"Oh, yes, he's most friendly.\"  \"He's in the Navy, I suppose?\"  \"He's retired from active service, but he is still one of the most influential men in our Admiralty.\"  \"Ah, yes, but I'm afraid I have but little knowledge of these things. I am a man of peace.  I hate war of every sort.  I am at one with what you English people call--Quakers.  But ah, it looks like war again now.\"  \"You mean the Servian trouble?\"  \"Yes.  At first I thought the Austrians were going to be kind and reasonable.  But they have Germany behind them, and now, I suppose, they've sent impossible demands to Servia.  It is here in the evening paper.  It seems, too, that Russia is going to back up Servia, and that will mean trouble.\"  \"How?\"  \"I am not an authority on European politics, but I am sure that if Russia espouses the cause of Servia, Germany will throw in her lot with Austria.  Don't you see what follows?\"  \"You mean that Germany would declare war on Russia too?\"  \"Yes, and that is not all.  France, my own country, although I am an Alsatian, is bound to be dragged in.  And I am a man of peace.  I hate war.\"  \"I am with you there,\" cried Bob eagerly.  \"War was born in hell.\"  \"Ah, you say so, and you are a young man!  That is good!  But still you need not fear.  England, in spite of the _Entente Cordiale_, holds to her policy of splendid isolation.  She will not be dragged into the turmoil?\"  \"No, I think that is impossible.  You see we are not a military nation, in spite of a section of the community.  Our Army is small, and will, I hope, remain small.\"  \"Stick to that, my friend--stick to that.  Big armies only breed war, and war is a crime.  But about my desire to buy Tre-Trelyon--ah, your English names are hard to pronounce--do you, who know the owner, this bluff John Bull, Admiral--what do you call him?\"  \"Admiral Tresize.\"  \"Admiral Tresize, yes.  Do you think it would be possible for me to see him?\"  \"I'm quite sure it would be,\" replied Bob, who remembered what the Admiral had said.  \"I'm dining at his house to-morrow night.  I'll tell him what you have said.\"  \"Ah, that is kind, friendly of you; but I must not detain you longer. Good evening.\"  \"What a friendly old fellow,\" reflected Bob, as he walked away.  \"Yes, I can quite imagine how one who is a Frenchman at heart would be treated in Alsace,\" and then he forgot all about him.  As day followed day, disquieting news came from the Near"]]]
