Belgezad couldn't possibly have bribed the cop, so they both had to be gassed.  \"If he didn't see his assailant, how does he know who it was?\"  \"You were followed from the palace by Jomis Dobigel, who saw you put the necklace into the baggage locker. There are several other witnesses to that.\"  Drake leaned forward. \"Let me point out, my Lord Prosecutor, that the only evidence you have that I was anywhere near the palace is the word of Jomis Dobigel. And he didn't see me _inside_ the palace. I was outside the wall.\"  The Prosecutor shrugged. \"We admit the possibility of an assistant inside the walls of the palace,\" he said. \"We are investigating that now. But even if we never find your accomplice, we have proof that you were implicated, and that is enough.\"  \"What proof do you have?\" Drake asked blandly.  \"Why, the necklace itself, of course!\" The Prosecutor looked as though he suspected Drake of having taken leave of his senses.  Drake shook his head. \"That necklace is mine. I can prove it. It was made for me by a respectable jeweler on Seladon II. It's a very good imitation, but it's a phoney. They aren't diamonds; they're simply well-cut crystals of titanium dioxide. Check them if you don't believe me.\"  The Lord Prosecutor looked dumbfounded. \"But--what--why--\"  Drake looked sad. \"I brought it to give to my good friend, the Noble Belgezad. Of course it would be a gross insult to wear them at the Shan's Coronation, but he could wear them at other functions.  \"And how does my good friend repay me? By having me arrested. My Lord Prosecutor, I am a wronged man.\"  The Prosecutor swallowed heavily and stood up. \"The necklace has, naturally, been impounded by the police. I shall have the stones tested.\"  \"You'll find they're phonies,\" Drake said. \"And that means one of two things. Either they are not the ones stolen from Belgezad or else Belgezad has mortally insulted his Shan by wearing false jewels to the Coronation.\"  \"Well! We shall see about this!\" said the Lord Prosecutor.         *       *       *       *       *  Anson Drake, free as a lark, was packing his clothes in his hotel room when the announcer chimed. He punched the TV pickup and grinned. It was the girl.  When the door slid aside, she came in, smiling. \"You got away with it, Drake! Wonderful! I don't know how you did it, but--\"  \"Did what?\" Drake looked innocent.  \"Get away with the necklace, of course! I don't know how it happened that Dobigel was there, but--\"  \"But, but, but,\" Drake said, smiling. \"You don't seem to know very much at all, do you?\"  \"Wha--what do you mean?\"  Drake put his last article of clothing in his suitcase and snapped it shut. \"I'll probably be searched pretty thoroughly when I get to the spaceport,\" he said coolly, \"but they won't find anything on an innocent man.\"  \"Where is the necklace?\" she asked in a throaty voice.  Drake pretended not to hear her. \"It's a funny thing,\" he said. \"Old Belgezad would never let the necklace out of his hands except to get me. He thought he'd get it back by making sure I was followed. But he made two mistakes.\"  The girl put her arms around his neck. \"His mistakes don't matter as long as we have the necklace, do they?\"  Anson Drake was never a man to turn down an invitation like that. He held her in his arms and kissed her--long and lingeringly.  When he broke away, he went on as though nothing had happened.  \"Two mistakes. The first one was thinking up such an obviously silly plot. If it were as easy to steal jewels from the palace as all that, nothing would be safe on Thizar.  \"The second mistake was sending his daughter to trap me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The girl gasped and stepped back.  \"It was very foolish of you, Miss Belgezad,\" he went on calmly. \"You see, I happened to know that the real Norma Knight was sentenced to seven years in Seladon Prison over a week ago. Unfortunately, the news hadn't reached Thizar yet. I knew from the first that the whole thing was to be a frame-up. It's too bad that your father had to use the real necklace--it's a shame he lost it.\"  The girl's eyes blazed. \"You--you _thief_! You--\" She used words which no self-respecting lady is supposed to use.  Drake waited until she had finished, and then said: \"Oh, no, Miss Belgezad; I'm no thief. Your father can consider the loss of that necklace as a fine for running narcotics. And you can tell him that if I catch him again, it will be worse.  \"I don't like his kind of slime, and I'll do my best to get rid of them. That's all, Miss B.; it was nice knowing you.\"  He walked out of the room, leaving her to stand there in helpless fury.  His phony necklace had come in handy after all; the police had thought they had the real one, so they had never bothered to check the Galactic Mail Service for a small package mailed to Seladon II. All he'd had to do was drop it into the mail chute from his room and then cool his heels in jail while the Galactic Mails got rid of the loot for him.  The Necklace of Algol would be waiting for him when he got to Seladon II.   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ October 1956.

But now, he wanted to be like the      rest--even if he had to lose an eye and both ears to do it._   Rolf Dekker stared incredulously at the slim, handsome young Earther who was approaching the steps of Rolf's tumbling-down Spacertown shack. _He's got no ears_, Rolf noted in unbelief. After five years in space, Rolf had come home to a strangely-altered world, and he found it hard to accept.  Another Earther appeared. This one was about the same size, and gave the same impression of fragility. This one had ears, all right--and a pair of gleaming, two-inch horns on his forehead as well. _I'll be eternally roasted_, Rolf thought. _Now I've seen everything._  Both Earthers were dressed in neat, gold-inlaid green tunics, costumes which looked terribly out of place amid the filth of Spacertown, and their hair was dyed a light green to match.  He had been scrutinizing them for several moments before they became aware of him. They both spotted him at once and the one with no ears turned to his companion and whispered something. Rolf, leaning forward, strained to hear.  \"... beautiful, isn't he? That's the biggest one I've seen!\"  \"Come over here, won't you?\" the horned one called, in a soft, gentle voice which contrasted oddly with the raucous bellowing Rolf had been accustomed to hearing in space. \"We'd like to talk to you.\"  Just then Kanaday emerged from the door of the shack and limped down to the staircase.  [Illustration: The doctor refused to change Dekker, so Dekker was going to change the doctor.]  \"Hey, Rolf!\" he called. \"Leave those things alone!\"  \"Let me find out what they want first, huh?\"  \"Can't be any good, whatever it is,\" Kanaday growled. \"Tell them to get out of here before I throw them back to wherever they came from. And make it fast.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The two Earthers looked at each other uneasily. Rolf walked toward them.  \"He doesn't like Earthers, that's all,\" Rolf explained. \"But he won't do anything but yell.\"  Kanaday spat in disgust, turned, and limped back inside the shack.  \"I didn't know you were wearing horns,\" Rolf said.  The Earther flushed. \"New style,\" he said. \"Very expensive.\"  \"Oh,\" Rolf said. \"I'm new here; I just got back. Five years in space. When I left you people looked all alike. Now you wear horns.\"  \"It's the new trend,\" said the earless one. \"We're Individs. When you left the Conforms were in power, style-wise. But the new surgeons can do almost anything, you see.\"  The shadow of a frown crossed Rolf's face. \"Anything?\"  \"Almost. They can't transform an Earther into a Spacer, and they don't think they ever will.\"  \"Or vice versa?\" Rolf asked.  They sniggered. \"What Spacer would want to become an Earther? Who would give up that life, out in the stars?\"  Rolf said nothing. He kicked at the heap of litter in the filthy street. _What spacer indeed?_ he thought. He suddenly realized that the two little Earthers were staring up at him as if he were some sort of beast. He probably weighed as much as both of them, he knew, and at six-four he was better than a foot taller. They looked like children next to him, like toys. The savage blast of acceleration would snap their flimsy bodies like toothpicks.  \"What places have you been to?\" the earless one asked.  \"Two years on Mars, one on Venus, one in the Belt, one on Neptune,\" Rolf recited. \"I didn't like Neptune. It was best in the Belt; just our one ship, prospecting. We made a pile on Ceres--enough to buy out. I shot half of it on Neptune. Still have plenty left, but I don't know what I can do with it.\" He didn't add that he had come home puzzled, wondering why he was a Spacer instead of an Earther, condemned to live in filthy Spacertown when Yawk was just across the river.  They were looking at his shabby clothes, at the dirty brownstone hovel he lived in--an antique of a house four or five centuries old.  \"You mean you're rich?\" the Earther said.  \"Sure,\" Rolf said. \"Every Spacer is. So what? What can I spend it on? My money's banked on Mars and Venus. Thanks to the law I can't legally get it to Earth. So I live in Spacertown.\"  \"Have you ever seen an Earther city?\" the earless one asked, looking around at the quiet streets of Spacertown with big powerful men sitting idly in front of every house.  \"I used to live in Yawk,\" Rolf said. \"My grandmother was an Earther; she brought me up there. I haven't been back there since I left for space.\" _They forced me out of Yawk_, he thought. _I'm not part of their species. Not one of them._         *       *       *       *       *  The two Earthers exchanged glances.  \"Can we interest you in a suggestion?\" They drew in their breath as if they expected to be knocked sprawling.  Kanaday appeared at the door of the shack again.  \"Rolf. Hey! You turning into an Earther? Get rid of them two cuties before there's trouble.\"  Rolf turned and saw a little knot of Spacers standing on the other side of the street, watching him with curiosity. He glared at them.  \"I'll do whatever I damn well please,\" he shouted across.  He turned back to the two Earthers. \"Now, what is it you want?\"  \"I'm giving a party next week,\" the earless one said. \"I'd like you to come. We'd like to get the Spacer slant on life.\"  \"Party?\" Rolf repeated. \"You mean, dancing, and games, and stuff like that?\"  \"You'll enjoy it,\" the Earther said coaxingly. \"And we'd all love to have a real Spacer there.\"  \"When is it?\"  \"A week.\"  \"I have ten days left of my leave. All right,\" he said. \"I'll come.\"  He accepted the Earther's card, looked at it mechanically, saw the name--Kal Quinton--and pocketed it. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I'll be there.\"  The Earthers moved toward their little jetcar, smiling gratefully. As Rolf crossed the street, the other Spacers greeted him with cold, puzzled stares.         *       *       *       *       *  Kanaday was almost as tall as Rolf, and even uglier. Rolf's eyebrows were bold and heavy; Kanaday's, thick, contorted, bushy clumps of hair. Kanaday's nose had been broken long before in some barroom brawl; his cheekbones bulged; his face was strong and hard. More important, his left foot was twisted and gnarled beyond hope of redemption by the most skillful surgeon. He had been crippled in a jet explosion three years before, and was of no use to the Spacelines any more. They had pensioned him off. Part of the deal was the dilapidated old house in Spacertown which he operated as a boarding-house for transient Spacers.  \"What do you want to do that for?\" Kanaday asked. \"Haven't those Earthers pushed you around enough, so you have to go dance at one of their wild parties?\"  \"Leave me alone,\" Rolf muttered.  \"You like this filth you live in? Spacertown is just a ghetto, that's all. The Earthers have pushed you right into the muck. You're not even a human being to them--just some sort of trained ape. And now you're going to go and entertain them. I thought you had brains, Rolf!\"  \"Shut up!\" He dashed his glass against the table; it bounced off and dropped to the floor, where it shattered.  Kanaday's girl Laney entered the room at the sound of the crash. She was tall and powerful-looking, with straight black hair and the strong cheekbones that characterized the Spacers. Immediately she stooped and began shoveling up the broken glass.  \"That wasn't smart, Rolf,\" she said. \"That'll cost you half a credit. Wasn't worth it, was it?\"  Rolf laid the coin on the edge of the table. \"Tell your pal to shut up, then. If he doesn't stop icing me I'll fix his other foot for him and you can buy him a dolly.\"  She looked from one to the other. \"What's bothering you two now?\"  \"A couple of Earthers were here this morning,\" Kanaday said. \"Slumming. They took a fancy to our young friend here and invited him to one of their parties. He accepted.\"  \"He _what_? Don't go, Rolf. You're crazy to go.\"  \"Why am I crazy?\" He tried to control his voice. \"Why should we keep ourselves apart from the Earthers? Why shouldn't the two races get together?\"         *       *       *       *       *  She put down her tray and sat next to him. \"They're more than two races,\" she said patiently. \"Earther and Spacer are two different species, Rolf. Carefully, genetically separated. They're small and weak, we're big and powerful. You've been bred for going to space; they're the castoffs, the ones who were too weak to go. The line between the two groups is too strong to break.\"  \"And they treat us like dirt--like animals,\" Kanaday said. \"But _they're_ the dirt. They were the ones who couldn't make it.\"  \"Don't go to the party,\" Laney said. \"They just want to make fun of you. Look at the big ape, they'll say.\"  Rolf stood up. \"You don't understand. Neither of you does. I'm part Earther,\" Rolf said. \"My grandmother on my mother's side. She raised me as an Earther. She wanted me to be an Earther. But I kept getting bigger and uglier all the time. She took me to a plastic surgeon once, figuring he could make me look like an Earther. He was a little man; I don't know what he looked like to start with but some other surgeon had made him clean-cut and straight-nosed and thin-lipped like all the other Earthers. I was bigger than he was--twice as big, and I was only fifteen. He looked at me and felt my bones and measured me. 'Healthy little ape'--those were the words he used. He told my grandmother I'd get bigger and bigger, that no amount of surgery could make me small and handsome, that I was fit only for space and didn't belong in Yawk. So I left for space the next morning.\"  \"I see,\" Laney said quietly.  \"I didn't say good-bye. I just left. There was no place for me in Yawk; I couldn't pass myself off as an Earther any more. But I'd like to go back and"]]]
