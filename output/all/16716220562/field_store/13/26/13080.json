After noting the slight fatigue the device seemed to cause in this application, and the vagueness of the device's operation, Morely had disregarded the claim. But junior executives could put up with a little fatigue and inconvenience. And he could see that they did. It might even cut down the time they were always wasting, talking with one another. He rubbed his chin with one hand.  \"Well,\" he told himself, \"let's see how it works.\"  From the way Bond had acted in his office, the sector leader might be still wearing his headband. In fact, he probably was. Morely concentrated on the man, then concentrated on a single, peremptory thought.  \"_Bond! Can you receive me?_\"  The answer was prompt. \"_Yes, sir. You wanted me?_\"  \"_Of course, Idiot. Why do you think I called? Do you really believe these things would be suitable for routine communication? Could they supplement our normal system?_\"  \"_Certainly, sir. They should be very effective._\"  \"_Have you offered them to Consolidated yet?_\"  \"_Yes, sir. They've accepted them. They're beginning to tool up for production._\"  Morely winced. He had given the order, to be sure--and before creditable witnesses. Bond had been right in taking immediate action, and his speed would have been commendable in most cases. But this time, Morely regretted his subordinate's efficiency. It was possible the devices might have a practical use after all. Possibly he had been hasty in releasing them to the open market. He shrugged away his thoughts. After all, an administrator had to make quick decisions. He returned to his unusual conversation.  \"_Set up a line in research and make up sufficient of those communicators to outfit the executive personnel of this district._\"  \"_Yes, sir._\"  \"_And give me delivery as soon as you possibly can. How soon will that be?_\"  \"_We can do it in five days, sir._\"  \"_Make it three. That's all._\"  Morely took off his headband. It wasn't as good as a communicator sphere, but it would be good enough. He looked at the request from Communications. Possibly, he would be able to cut Kirk down still more. He scrawled a \"disapproved\" on the sheet and initialed it. He started to toss the sheet to the corner of his desk, then hesitated.  Drawing the request back to him, he added: \"Two subjects on same request. Resubmit as separate requests.\" He tossed the sheet to the desk corner, for the clerk to pick up. Let Kirk make up new requests, then worry about why his new construction request was still disapproved. He could always be advised to resubmit later, if the headbands didn't work out.         *       *       *       *       *  Miles away, Bond turned to an engineer.  \"Tool up and start producing these communicators as fast as you can make 'em, Morris. I'll tell you when to stop. The Old Man just ordered a batch of 'em, and this is one order I want to comply with, and fast!\"  He walked toward the small production office. Let's see, he had to produce enough for all the exec personnel in the district. Have to start finding out just how many of those guys there were.  \"Make delivery as soon as possible, huh? Cut my estimate by two days? I'll have 'em out over night, if I have to start driving people to do it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Morely looked up as the communicator beeped. He reached to the control panel and touched the switch. The face of his deputy appeared in the sphere.  \"The section chiefs and field leaders are in the conference room, sir.\"  \"Very good.\" Morely pushed back his chair. \"I'll be right in.\"  He stepped through the door and crossed the outer office to the conference room. As he entered, there was a rustle of motion. The section chiefs and field leaders stood at attention around the table, waiting. At each place at the table was a blank notepad. The district leader went immediately to the head of the table and sat down.  \"Gentlemen,\" he began, \"I'll make this short. I've called you in to try out a new device which I intend to use to help solve the ever-present problem of communication.\" He looked toward Ward Kirk, who had glanced up in surprise.  \"From time to time,\" he continued, \"requests for more and more communicator lines have been coming in to my office. Since no one else seemed to be able to do anything about it, I decided it was time for me to step in. After all, we can't expand our cables indefinitely. We haven't unlimited funds at our disposal and there are other projects demanding attention. Important projects.  \"A new electronic development has come to my attention, and it promises to relieve the load on our communicators. Each of you will be issued one of these devices, which I believe are called 'mental communicators,' or something of the sort. And you will draw sufficient of them to outfit those of your people who have occasion to use communication to any large degree. You will use them for all routine communications.\" He nodded to his deputy, who stepped to the door and beckoned.  Two men came in, carrying cartons, which they distributed around the room. Morely waited until one of the cartons was in the hands of each of the men before him, then he reached up to touch the headband he was wearing.  \"This is the device I'm speaking of,\" he said. \"Each of you will wear one of these at all times while you are on duty. You will find, after a little practice, that you will be able to call any associate who is similarly equipped. And you will use them in place of the conventional communications whenever possible.\" He cleared his throat raspingly.  \"Sufficient of these devices have been produced to outfit all the key people of this district. I shall leave it to you to distribute them to your subordinates, and to instruct those subordinates in their use. And I shall expect the load on our communicator cables to be appreciably diminished.\" He looked to one side of the room.  \"Bond.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You will instruct those present in the use of this new communicator.\" Morely rose and left the room.         *       *       *       *       *  As the district leader disappeared through the door, Harold Bond walked to the front of the room. In his hands, he held one of the headbands and a power pack.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is a form of communicator. I don't pretend to understand precisely how it operates, though I watched its development and set up a production line for it. All I know is that it works. And I know how to use it--to some extent.  \"The district leader remarked that one could learn to use it with a little practice, and he's right. Basically, anyone can use it as soon as he puts it on for the first time. But it's like so many other tools. The more you use it, the more proficient you get with it. And I suspect it has capabilities I haven't found yet.\" He shrugged.  \"Operation is simple in the extreme. Since the first model, refinements have been added, and it's unnecessary now for an operator to make any adjustments, other than intensity.\"  He picked up the power pack.  \"This is the power pack, which is plugged into the headband, thus.\" He paused as he connected the two plugs.  \"If you gentlemen will perform the operations as I do, this will take only a short time.\"  There was a crackling in the room as cartons were opened. Power packs and headbands rattled against the table for a moment, then Bond continued.  \"Having plugged in the power pack, you turn this small knob very slightly in a clockwise direction, then place the headband on your head. The knob is the switch and intensity control, and it's quite sensitive. Most people need very little intensity. If you have difficulty with communication, raise the intensity a little at a time, till thoughts come through clearly.\" He paused, as the men before him adjusted the headbands to their heads.  \"The power pack,\" he continued, \"may be placed in a pocket.\" He reached down. \"Personally, I carry mine in my shirt, since I find that convenient.\"  He looked around the room. Men were turning to stare at their neighbors. Bond could detect a current of uncertainty, then a sensation of pleased surprise. Snatches of thought drifted to him. He ignored them for the moment. Time enough to become acquainted with people later. He placed a hand over his mouth, so everyone could see he was not speaking.  \"_Can everyone receive me?_\"  There was a wave of affirmation, and Bond nodded.  \"_Simple, isn't it? Are there any questions?_\"  A jumble of thoughts made him waver. Most of them could have been phrased, \"How does this thing work? What does it do? Am I dreaming?\" Bond smiled in real amusement. He held up a hand.  \"_I felt the same way_,\" he thought reassuringly. \"_Sometimes. I still do. All I can tell you is what you've already found out for yourselves. It works. I'm told it's a sort of telepathic amplifier and radiator. But as I told you, I don't understand its principles. As to practice? I'm still meeting interesting people. So will you._\" He took off the headband.  \"_If anyone has any further questions on operation, I'll try to answer them_,\" he thought quickly. He glanced around the room. Three men were looking at him blankly. He took careful note of them, and mentally shook hands with himself. They were the ones he'd thought would blank out. He spoke aloud.  \"I'm sorry, gentlemen,\" he apologized. \"I forgot I might be out of communication. I'm not completely used to this mentacom, myself.\" He looked toward the deputy leader.  \"Do you have anything to add, sir?\"  The deputy shook his head. \"No,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I think the demonstration was adequate. He cast a quizzical look at Bond, then looked around the room.  \"You gentlemen will find a supply of these devices in the outer office. You may draw one for each person you wish outfitted. If any of you have further questions, I would suggest you get in touch with Community Research. They understand this thing.\" He waved toward the door. \"This meeting is adjourned.\"  He watched as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],["title","A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

CHAPTER I.  ANCIENT PAINTING, FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE CHRISTIAN ERA.   In speaking of art we often contrast the useful or mechanical arts with the Fine Arts; by these terms we denote the difference between the arts which are used in making such things as are necessary and useful in civilized life, and the arts by which ornamental and beautiful things are made.  The fine arts are Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Poetry, and Music, and though we could live if none of these existed, yet life would be far from the pleasant experience that it is often made to be through the enjoyment of these arts.  In speaking of Painting, just here I wish to include the more general idea of pictures of various sorts, and it seems to me that while picture-making belongs to the fine or beautiful arts, it is now made a very useful art in many ways. For example, when a school-book is illustrated, how much more easily we understand the subject we are studying through the help we get from pictures of objects or places that we have not seen, and yet wish to know about. Pictures of natural scenery bring all countries before our eyes in such a way that by looking at them, while reading books of travel, we may know a great deal more about lands we have never seen, and may never be able to visit.  Who does not love pictures? and what a pleasure it is to open a magazine or book filled with fine illustrations. St. Augustine, who wrote in the fourth century after Christ, said that \"pictures are the books of the simple or unlearned;\" this is just as true now as then, and we should regard pictures as one of the most agreeable means of education. Thus one of the uses of pictures is that they give us a clear idea of what we have not seen; a second use is that they excite our imaginations, and often help us to forget disagreeable circumstances and unpleasant surroundings. The cultivation of the imagination is very important, because in this way we can add much to our individual happiness. Through this power, if we are in a dark, narrow street, in a house which is not to our liking, or in the midst of any unpleasant happenings, we are able to fix our thoughts upon a photograph or picture that may be there, and by studying it we are able to imagine ourselves far, far away, in some spot where nature makes everything pleasant and soothes us into forgetfulness of all that can disturb our happiness. Many an invalid--many an unfortunate one is thus made content by pictures during hours that would otherwise be wretched. This is the result of cultivating the perceptive and imaginative faculties, and when once this is done, we have a source of pleasure within ourselves and not dependent on others which can never be taken from us.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--HARP-PLAYER. _From an Egyptian painting._]  It often happens that we see two persons who do the same work and are situated in the same way in the world who are very different in their manner; one is light-hearted and happy, the other heavy and sad. If you can find out the truth, it will result that the sad one is matter-of-fact, and has no imagination--he can only think of his work and what concerns him personally; but the merry one would surprise you if you could read his thoughts--if you could know the"]]]
