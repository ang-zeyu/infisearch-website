But I might have known Chris wouldn't. Of course I'll go.\"  \"And you'll make up your organdie?\"  \"I shall have to,\" laughed Carry, forgetting all her troubles for a moment, and feeling young and joyous over the prospect of a festivity. \"I haven't another thing that would do to wear to a wedding. If I hadn't that blessed organdie I couldn't go, that's all.\"  \"But you have it, and it will look lovely made up with a tucked skirt. Tucks are so fashionable now. And there's that lace of mine you can have for a bertha. I want you to look just right, you see. Enfield is a big place, and there will be lots of grandees at the wedding. Let's get the last fashion sheet and pick out a design right away. Here's one on the very first page that would be nice. You could wear it to perfection, Caddy you're so tall and slender. It wouldn't suit a plump and podgy person like myself at all.\"  Carry liked the pattern, and they had an animated discussion over it. But, in the end, Carry sighed, and pushed the sheet away from her, with all the brightness gone out of face.  \"It's no use, Patty. I'd forgotten for a few minutes, but it's all come back now. I can't think of weddings and new dresses, when the thought of that interest crowds everything else out. It's due next month--fifty dollars--and I've only ten saved up. I can't make forty dollars in a month, even if I had any amount of sewing, and you know hardly anyone wants sewing done just now. I don't know what we shall do. Oh, I suppose we can rent a couple of rooms in the village and _exist_ in them. But it breaks my heart to think of leaving our old home.\"  \"Perhaps Mr. Kerr will let us have more time,\" suggested Patty, not very hopefully. The sparkle had gone out of her face too. Patty loved their little home as much as Carry did.  \"You know he won't. He has been only too anxious for an excuse to foreclose, this long time. He wants the land the house is on. Oh, if I only hadn't been sick so long in the summer--just when everybody had sewing to do. I've tried so hard to catch up, but I couldn't.\" Carry's voice broke in a sob.  Patty leaned over the table and patted her sister's glossy dark hair gently.  \"You've worked too hard, dearie. You've just gone to skin and bone. Oh, I know how hard it is! I can't bear to think of leaving this dear old spot either. If we could only induce Mr. Kerr to give us a year's grace! I'd be teaching then, and we could easily pay the interest and some of the principal too. Perhaps he will if we both go to him and coax very hard. Anyway, don't worry over it till after the wedding. I want you to go and have a good time. You never have good times, Carry.\"  \"Neither do you,\" said Carry rebelliously. \"You never have anything that other girls have, Patty--not even pretty clothes.\"  \"Deed, and I've lots of things to be thankful for,\" said Patty cheerily. \"Don't you fret about me. I'm vain enough to think I've got some brains anyway, and I'm a-meaning to do something with them too. Now I think I'll go upstairs and study this evening. It will be warm enough there tonight, and the noise of the machine rather bothers me.\"  Patty whisked out, and Carry knew she should go to her sewing. But she sat a long while at the table in dismal thought. She was so tired, and so hopeless. It had been such a hard struggle, and it seemed now as if it would all come to naught. For five years, ever since her mother's death, Carry had supported herself and Patty by dressmaking. They had been a hard five years of pinching and economizing and going without, for Enderby was only a small place, and there were two other dressmakers. Then there was always the mortgage to devour everything. Carry had kept it at bay till now, but at last she was conquered. She had had typhoid fever in the spring and had not been able to work for a long time. Indeed, she had gone to work before she should. The doctor's bill was yet unpaid, but Dr. Hamilton had told her to take her time. Carry knew she would not be pressed for that, and next year Patty would be able to help her. But next year would be too late. The dear little home would be lost then.  When Carry roused herself from her sad reflections, she saw a crumpled note lying on the floor. She picked it up and absently smoothed it out. Seeing Patty's name at the top she was about to lay it aside without reading it, but the lines were few, and the sense of them flashed into Carry's brain. The note was an invitation to Clare Forbes's party! The Lea girls had known that the Forbes girls were going to give a party, but they had not expected that Patty would be invited. Of course, Clare Forbes was in Patty's class at school and was always very nice and friendly with her. But then the Forbes set was not the Lea set.  Carry ran upstairs to Patty's room. \"Patty, you dropped this on the floor. I couldn't help seeing what it was. Why didn't you tell me Clare had invited you?\"  \"Because I knew I couldn't go, and I thought you would feel badly over that. Caddy, I wish you hadn't seen it.\"  \"Oh, Patty, I _do_ wish you could go to the party. It was so sweet of Clare to invite you, and perhaps she will be offended if you don't go--she won't understand. Clare Forbes isn't a girl whose friendship is to be lightly thrown away when it is offered.\"  \"I know that. But, Caddy dear, it is impossible. I don't think that I have any foolish pride about clothes, but you know it is out of the question to think of going to Clare Forbes's party in my last winter's plaid dress, which is a good two inches too short and skimpy in proportion. Putting my own feelings aside, it would be an insult to Clare. There, don't think any more about it.\"  But Carry did think about it. She lay awake half the night wondering if there might not be some way for Patty to go to that party. She knew it was impossible, unless Patty had a new dress, and how could a new dress be had? Yet she did so want Patty to go. Patty never had any good times, and she was studying so hard. Then, all at once, Carry thought of a way by which Patty might have a new dress. She had been tossing restlessly, but now she lay very still, staring with wide-open eyes at the moonlit window, with the big willow boughs branching darkly across it. Yes, it was a way, but could she? _Could_ she? Yes, she could, and she would. Carry buried her face in her pillow with a sob and a gulp. But she had decided what must be done, and how it must be done.  \"Are you going to begin on your organdie today?\" asked Patty in the morning, before she started for school.  \"I must finish Mrs. Pidgeon's suit first,\" Carry answered. \"Next week will be time enough to think about my wedding garments.\"  She tried to laugh and failed. Patty thought with a pang that Carry looked horribly pale and tired--probably she had worried most of the night over the interest. \"I'm so glad she's going to Chris's wedding,\" thought Patty, as she hurried down the street. \"It will take her out of herself and give her something nice to think of for ever so long.\"  Nothing more was said that week about the organdie, or the wedding, or the Forbes's party. Carry sewed fiercely, and sat at her machine for hours after Patty had gone to bed. The night before the party she said to Patty, \"Braid your hair tonight, Patty. You'll want it nice and wavy to go to the Forbes's tomorrow night.\"  Patty thought that Carry was actually trying to perpetrate a weak joke, and endeavoured to laugh. But it was a rather dreary laugh. Patty, after a hard evening's study, felt tired and discouraged, and she was really dreadfully disappointed about the party, although she wouldn't have let Carry suspect it for the world.  \"You're going, you know,\" said Carry, as serious as a judge, although there was a little twinkle in her eyes.  \"In a faded plaid two inches too short?\" Patty smiled as brightly as possible.  \"Oh, no. I have a dress all ready for you.\" Carry opened the wardrobe door and took out--the loveliest girlish dress of creamy organdie, with pale pink roses scattered over it, made with the daintiest of ruffles and tucks, with a bertha of soft creamy lace, and a girdle of white silk. \"This is for you,\" said Carry.  Patty gazed at the dress with horror-stricken eyes. \"Caroline Lea, _that is your organdie!_ And you've gone and made it up for _me_! Carry Lea, what are you going to wear to the wedding?\"  \"Nothing. I'm not going.\"  \"You are--you must--you shall. I won't take the organdie.\"  \"You'll have to now, because it's made to fit you. Come, Patty dear, I've set my heart on your going to that party. You mustn't disappoint me--you _can't_, for what good would it do? I can never wear the dress now.\"  Patty realized that. She knew she might as well go to the party, but she did not feel much pleasure in the prospect. Nevertheless, when she was ready for it the next evening, she couldn't help a little thrill of delight. The dress was so pretty, and dainty, and becoming.  \"You look sweet,\" exclaimed Carry admiringly. \"There, I hear the Browns' carriage. Patty, I want you to promise me this--that you'll not let any thought of me, or my not going to the wedding, spoil your enjoyment this evening. I gave you the dress that you might have a good time, so don't make my gift of no effect.\"  \"I'll try,\" promised Patty, flying downstairs, where her next-door neighbours were waiting for her.  At two o'clock that night Carry was awakened to see Patty bending over her, flushed and radiant. Carry sat sleepily up. \"I hope you had a good time,\" she said.  \"I had--oh, I had--but I didn't waken you out of your hard-earned slumbers at this wee sma' hour to tell you that. Carry, I've thought of a way for you to go to the wedding. It just came to me at supper. Mrs. Forbes was sitting opposite to me, and her dress suggested it. You must make over Aunt Caroline's silk dress.\"  \"Nonsense,\" said Carry, a little crossly; even sweet-tempered people "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],["title","Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#8)"],["body","sometimes cross when they are wakened up for--as it seemed--nothing.  \"It's good plain sense. Of course, you must make it over and--\"  \"Patty Lea, you're crazy. I wouldn't dream of wearing that hideous thing. Bright green silk, with huge yellow brocade flowers as big as cabbages all over it! I think I see myself in it.\"  \"Caddy, listen to me. You know there's enough of that black lace of mother's for the waist, and the big black lace shawl of Grandmother Lea's will do for the skirt. Make it over--\"  \"A plain slip of the silk,\" gasped Carry, her quick brain seizing on all the possibilities of the plan. \"Why didn't I think of it before? It will be just the thing, the greens and yellow will be toned down to a nice shimmer under the black lace. And I'll make cuffs of black velvet with double puffs above--and just cut out a wee bit at the throat with a frill of lace and a band of black velvet ribbon around my neck. Patty Lea, it's an inspiration.\"  Carry was out of bed by daylight the next morning and, while Patty still slumbered, she mounted to the garret, and took Aunt Caroline's silk dress from the chest where it had lain forgotten for three years. Carry held it up at arm's length, and looked at it with amusement.  \"It is certainly ugly, but with the lace over it it will look very different. There's enough of it, anyway, and that skirt is stiff enough to stand alone. Poor Aunt Caroline, I'm afraid I wasn't particularly grateful for her gift at the time, but I really am now.\"  Aunt Caroline, who had given the dress to Carry three years before, was, an old lady of eighty, the aunt of Carry's father. She had once possessed a snug farm but in an evil hour she had been persuaded to deed it to her nephew, Edward Curry, whom she had brought up. Poor Aunt Caroline had lived to regret this step, for everyone in Enderby knew that Edward Curry and his wife had repaid her with ingratitude and greed.  Carry, who was named for her, was her favourite grandniece and often went to see her, though such visits were coldly received by the Currys, who always took especial care never to leave Aunt Caroline alone with any of her relatives. On one occasion, when Carry was there, Aunt Caroline had brought out this silk dress.  \"I'm going to give this to you, Carry,\" she said timidly. \"It's a good silk, and not so very old. Mr. Greenley gave it to me for a birthday present fifteen years ago. Maybe you can make it over for yourself.\"  Mrs. Edward, who was on duty at the time, sniffed disagreeably, but she said nothing. The dress was of no value in her eyes, for the pattern was so ugly and old-fashioned that none of her smart daughters would have worn it. Had it been otherwise, Aunt Caroline would probably not have been allowed to give it away.  Carry had thanked Aunt Caroline sincerely. If she did not care much for the silk, she at least prized the kindly motive behind the gift. Perhaps she and Patty laughed a little over it as they packed it away in the garret. It was so very ugly, but Carry thought it was sweet of Aunt Caroline to have given her something. Poor old Aunt Caroline had died soon after, and Carry had not thought about the silk dress again. She had too many other things to think of, this poor worried Carry.  After breakfast Carry began to rip the skirt breadths apart. Snip, snip, went her scissors, while her thoughts roamed far afield--now looking forward with renewed pleasure to Christine's wedding, now dwelling dolefully on the mortgage. Patty, who was washing the dishes, knew just what her thoughts were by the light and shadow on her expressive face.  \"Why!--what?\" exclaimed Carry suddenly. Patty wheeled about to see Carry staring at the silk dress like one bewitched. Between the silk and the lining which she had just ripped apart was a twenty-dollar bill, and beside it a sheet of letter paper covered with writing in a cramped angular hand, both secured very carefully to the silk.  \"Carry Lea!\" gasped Patty.  With trembling fingers Carry snipped away the stitches that held the letter, and read it aloud.      \"My dear Caroline,\" it ran, \"I do not know when you will find     this letter and this money, but when you do it belongs to you.     I have a hundred dollars which I always meant to give you     because you were named for me. But Edward and his wife do not     know I have it, and I don't want them to find out. They would     not let me give it to you if they knew, so I have thought of     this way of getting it to you. I have sewed five twenty-dollar     bills under the lining of this skirt, and they are all yours,     with your Aunt Caroline's best love. You were always a good     girl, Carry, and you've worked hard, and I've given Edward     enough. Just take this money and use it as you like.                                     \"Aunt Caroline Greenley.\"   \"Carry Lea, are we both dreaming?\" gasped Patty.  With crimson cheeks Carry ripped the other breadths apart, and there were the other four bills. Then she slipped down in a little heap on the sofa cushions and began to cry--happy tears of relief and gladness.  \"We can pay the interest,\" said Patty, dancing around the room, \"and get yourself a nice new dress for the wedding.\"  \"Indeed I won't,\" said Carry, sitting up and laughing through her tears. \"I'll make over this dress and wear it out of gratitude to the memory of dear Aunt Caroline.\"     Aunt Susanna's Thanksgiving Dinner.  BY L.M. MONTGOMERY   \"Here's Aunt Susanna, girls,\" said Laura who was sitting by the north window--nothing but north light does for Laura who is the artist of our talented family.  Each of us has a little pet new-fledged talent which we are faithfully cultivating in the hope that it will amount to something and soar highly some day. But it is difficult to cultivate four talents on our tiny income. If Laura wasn't such a good manager we never could do it.  Laura's words were a signal for Kate to hang up her violin and for me to push my pen and portfolio out of sight. Laura had hidden her brushes and water colors as she spoke. Only Margaret continued to bend serenely over her Latin grammar. Aunt Susanna frowns on musical and literary and artistic ambitions but she accords a faint approval to Margaret's desire for an education. A college course, with a tangible diploma at the end, and a sensible pedagogic aspiration is something Aunt Susanna can understand when she tries hard. But she cannot understand messing with paints, fiddling, or scribbling, and she has only unmeasured contempt for messers, fiddlers, and scribblers. Time was when we had paid no attention to Aunt Susanna's views on these points; but ever since she had, on one incautious day when she was in high good humor, dropped a pale, anemic little hint that she might send Margaret to college if she were a good girl we had been bending all our energies towards securing Aunt Susanna's approval. It was not enough that Aunt Susanna should approve of Margaret; she must approve of the whole four of us or she would not help Margaret. That is Aunt Susanna's way. Of late we had been growing a little discouraged. Aunt Susanna had recently read a magazine article which stated that the higher education of women was ruining our country and that a woman who was a B.A. couldn't, in the very nature of things, ever be a housewifely, cookly creature. Consequently, Margaret's chances looked a little foggy; but we hadn't quite given up hope. A very little thing might sway Aunt Susanna one way or the other, so that we walked very softly and tried to mingle serpents' wisdom and doves' harmlessness in practical portions.  When Aunt Susanna came in Laura was crocheting, Kate was sewing, and I was poring over a recipe book. That was not deception at all, since we did all these things frequently--much more frequently, in fact, than we painted or fiddled or wrote. But Aunt Susanna would never believe it. Nor did she believe it now.  She threw back her lovely new sealskin cape, looked around the sitting-room and then smiled--a truly Aunt Susannian smile.  [Illustration]  \"What a pity you forgot to wipe that smudge of paint off your nose, Laura,\" she said sarcastically. \"You don't seem to get on very fast with your lace. How long is it since you began it? Over three months, isn't it?\"  \"This is the third piece of the same pattern I've done in three months, Aunt Susanna,\" said Laura presently. Laura is an old duck. She never gets cross and snaps back. I do; and it's so hard not to with Aunt Susanna sometimes. But I generally manage it for I'd do anything for Margaret. Laura did not tell Aunt Susanna that she sold her lace at the Women's Exchange in town and made enough to buy her new hats. She makes enough out of her water colors to dress herself.  Aunt Susanna took a second breath and started in again.  \"I notice your violin hasn't quite as much dust on it as the rest of the things in this room, Kate. It's a pity you stopped playing just as I came in. I don't enjoy fiddling much but I'd prefer it to seeing anyone using a needle who isn't accustomed to it.\"  Kate is really a most dainty needlewoman and does all the fine sewing in our family. She colored and said nothing--that being the highest pitch of virtue to which our Katie, like myself, can attain.  \"And there's Margaret ruining her eyes over books,\" went on Aunt Susanna severely. \"Will you kindly tell me, Margaret Thorne, what good you ever expect Latin to do you?\"  \"Well, you see, Aunt Susanna,\" said Margaret gently--Magsie and Laura are birds of a feather--\"I want to be a teacher if I can manage to get through, and I shall need Latin for that.\"  All the girls except me had now got their accustomed rap, but I knew better than to hope I should escape.  \"So you're reading a recipe book, Agnes? Well, that's better than poring over a novel. I'm afraid you haven't been at it very long though. People generally don't read recipes upside down--and besides, you didn't quite cover up your portfolio. I see a"]]]
