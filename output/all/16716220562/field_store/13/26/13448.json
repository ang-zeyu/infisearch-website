I suppose I've seen it, and I expect I've been vexed that you've never told me.  I--I wanted you to.\"  \"Wanted me to!\" cried Bob.  \"You have never given me a chance. And--and you always seemed to care for--for those other fellows.\"  \"I wanted you to make your chances.  If--if a man loves a girl, he should dare anything to get her.  Anything.  What do I care about Hector Trevanion?  He hasn't a thought in his head above his latest horse and his newest uniform.  But how could I help being friendly with him, when you--have always on the slightest pretext been ready to leave me with him.\"  \"And you wanted me all the time!\"  There was a note of joy and triumph in his voice.  \"I don't know,\" replied the girl.  \"I'll be absolutely frank with you, Bob.  You are not the sort of man I wanted to love.  Yes, I'll admit it--I wanted to love a soldier, a sailor, a man of action.  I can never admire a man who will be content to spend his days in a library poring over old dusty books.  That's why I have been angry when I've heard you glorifying these useless old fossils.  And yet--oh, Bob!\" and the girl concluded with a sob.  \"Do you mean,\" and Bob's voice was tremulous, \"that you cared for me all the time, although you--you didn't like my plans for my future? That you preferred me to Trevanion?  Oh, Nancy!\"  \"As though a girl must care for six feet of flesh without brains because she isn't a blue-stocking.  Why--why--couldn't you see, Bob?\"  \"And I say--oh, Nancy, does this mean that you care for me--love me?\"  \"I'm afraid I do,\" she half-laughed, half-sobbed.  \"Afraid?\"  \"Yes, don't you see?  You are not in the least like the man I wanted to love.  You could have won your blue as a cricketer, but you wouldn't take the trouble to get it.  A man in Oxford told me that you could be the best three-quarter in the 'Varsity Rugby team, but that you were too lazy to play.  You've been a sort of negative creature, while I love a man of action.  What are old shrivelled manuscripts worth to the world to-day?  Who cares about the sayings of some old dead and forgotten German, or some obscure passages in _Bede's Ecclesiastical History_, when there's a great surging life all around us to-day? History is only a record of what took place in the past; I love the thought of a man who wants to make history, who sets his ideas to action.  And you, Bob, you have told me again and again that you want to spend your life in historical research, or some such useless thing.\"  \"But--but, Nancy, what does all that matter when I love you--love you with all my life?  Besides----\"  \"I come of a race of fighters,\" cried the girl.  \"When Philip of Spain sent over his Great Armada, to rob us of our liberty, one of my ancestors fought the Dons.  He gave ships and men to our country, and helped to save us from oppression.  When Napoleon cast a shadow over Europe, and threatened to destroy our country, men of my name were among the foremost in fighting him.  My grandfather represented St. Ia in Parliament, and he roused the country.  While you--oh, Bob, forgive me, but your ideal seems to be to sit in a library in Oxford, wearing a dirty old dressing-gown and iron-rimmed spectacles, reading or writing books which will be of no use to any one!  Is that a life for a man?\"  \"But if his mind is cast in that mould?\"  \"I haven't finished yet,\" went on the girl.  \"Forgive me, Bob, for talking so much.  I wouldn't only--oh, Bob, can't you see?  Why, at our last dance--when--when I had kept four for you, you never even asked for them.  And I--I wanted to dance them too; but--but I had to sit them out, and when other men begged me to let them put their names down on my card, I said I was tired.  Then, when I heard afterwards that you had gone into the library, and were reading some old book which hadn't been opened for years, I just--cried.\"  \"Oh, Nancy, I never dreamt of such a thing!  I--I never thought you wanted me.  I was just aching for you all the time, but I thought--why, you've always laughed at my dancing.  But there, now I know, I can do anything, be anything.  And there's nothing I won't do for you?\"  \"You are not vexed with me, are you?\"  \"I couldn't be vexed with you, Nancy.  I'd let myself be cut in bits for you.  And you love me, don't you?  Oh, it's too good to be true! but say you do, tell me that in spite of everything you love me?\"  \"Haven't I been telling you so all the time?  And--and yet you haven't asked me to--to----\"  \"What, Nancy?\"  \"Oh, I do hate a coward!\"  \"But what haven't I asked you?\"  \"Bob, isn't there something you want very much?\"  \"Yes, there is,\" replied Bob.  \"Something--that----  Nancy, you won't be vexed with me if I ask you?\"  \"Risk my being vexed,\" laughed the girl.  \"Then I want to take you in my arms, and kiss you--kiss you a hundred times.\"  \"Then, why don't you?\"  Bob looked around him, like one afraid.  They were beneath the shadow of a great rock.  At their feet was headland grass, wind-swept and grey, but peeping through the grass were thousands upon thousands of wild thyme, giving the little plateau a purple hue.  They were hidden from the gaze of any who might be on the great rock.  His heart beat so that his breath came with difficulty; he was trembling with a new-found joy--a joy so great that it almost gave him pain.  \"Oh, my love!--my love!\" he cried, as he took her in his arms, and his kisses were as pure as those with which a young mother lasses her firstborn.   \"What haven't I asked you?\" he said, a few minutes later.  They were sitting beneath the shadow of the rock now, and Nancy was rearranging her hat.  She did not reply, but her eyes were full of gladsome mischief as she looked at him.  \"I mean just now, when--when you said you had been telling me that you loved me, but I hadn't asked for something.  What was it?\"  \"You've made up for it since,\" and there was a laugh in her voice.  \"Do you mean that you wanted me to kiss you?  Oh, you are right, Nancy, I am an awful coward, but I'll make up for lost time now.\"  The sea continued to roll on the great rugged rock, which threw its mighty head far out into its depths.  Overhead the sea-birds hovered, sailing with graceful motion over the silvery waters, and uttering their mournful cry, while far out vessels ploughed their way up and down the Atlantic; but neither noticed.  They were happy in each other's love.  Nancy had forgotten the fact that Robert Nancarrow was not the kind of man she had meant to love, while he was far too happy to care for the lecture she had given him.  Her kisses were warm upon his lips, her words of love rung in his ears.  They were in the dreamland of happy lovers, while the sky of their lives was as free from clouds as the great dome of blue overhead.  He was the only man she had ever loved, or ever could love, while to him the maid, wilful and passionate though she might be, was perfect.  What were books, learning, and the fame of scholarship to him now?  He had won the love of the girl whom for years he had loved, and ever despaired of winning. She, who had seemed so far away from him, so far above him, had come to his arms, willingly, gladly.  She, with her proud old name, and almost lordly wealth, had chosen him, and forgotten everything in her choice.  It seemed too wonderful to be true, and he looked at her again and again in his wonder, proud beyond all words, yet almost afraid to believe in his good fortune.  \"Oh, Nancy, you are beautiful!\"  The light of joy flashed from her eyes.  What girl is there beneath the all-beholding heavens who does not long to know that the man she loves thinks her beautiful?--Who does not long for him to tell her?  \"And what a lovely dress you are wearing.\"  \"I've worn it three times since you came down from Oxford, and you've never once mentioned it.\"  \"I never saw it as I see it now.  I never saw as I see you now.  Nancy, there's no one like.  Bless you, my love, for loving me.\"  But I must not dwell on that happy hour, much as I would love to.  We who are older may laugh at \"Love's young dream,\" and grow cynical about its transitory nature.  We may say that lovers live in a fool's paradise, and that the dream of lovers ends in the tragedies of later years.  Still, there's nothing sweeter or purer on God's green earth than the love of a clean-minded honest lad for the maid he has chosen from all others.  It keeps the world young and hopeful; humanly speaking, it is life's greatest joy, and the man who can throw scorn upon its joys and utter cynical words about its reality has himself lost the pearl of great price.  It is he who is to be pitied, and not the lovers.  They hear the birds of paradise singing in the bowers of Eden, while he hears only the croaking of the raven.  They got back to realities presently.  Bob's new-found joy had led him to the realisation of the future.  \"I'm going to speak to your father to-night, Nancy.  I know he'll be angry, but that I don't mind a bit.\"  \"No, Bob, you must not speak to him--at least not yet.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because he'll refuse, and you mustn't speak to him until you can make him consent.\"  \"I don't understand, Nancy.\"  \"You see, he has exactly the same feeling that I have about men.  He would never consent to my being the wife of a book-worm.\"  \"Oh, I've thought that all out while I've been here,\" replied Bob confidently.  \"Yes, I know I've been unpractical--a dreamer, in fact. But I'm going to alter all that.  Now you've told me--that--that you love me, I feel I must become a man of action.  You've wakened something in me that I didn't know existed.  I haven't been half alive. I've imagined that only thoughts, ideas mattered; now I know differently.  I've lived only half-life.  Mark you, I don't altogether go back upon my faith--I only add a new element to it.  I've always said that we owe everything to thought.  I've said that thoughts covered the seas with floating cities, and converted the world into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25152"],["title","All for a Scrap of Paper: A Romance of the Present War (#3)"],["body"," whispering-gallery.  That thoughts have belted the globe with electric currents, and given us untold blessings.  Now I know that I've stated only half a truth.  The man who is simply a man of ideas, is like a bird trying to fly with one wing.  There must be action to put the ideas into use.  Oh, yes, I see it all.\"  \"Yes, yes, Bob; and what are you going to do?\"  \"I'm going to study for the Bar.  I'm going to set about it right away. And then I'm going into Parliament.  I've big ideas, Nancy--big ideas about governments, and about reforms in our laws.  There are great things that want doing, and I'm going to do them.  I'm going to get at the helm of government, and destroy abuses.  I am not going to be content by writing books about what is needed; I'm going to see that my ideas take shape in the laws of the country, and effect the betterment of the world.\"  Please do not smile at Robert Nancarrow's somewhat highfalutin talk, and set him down as a conceited prig.  Every young fellow who has ever done or been anything in the world, has at some time in his life had such thoughts.  Sad will it be for England as a nation when our boys do not dream impossible dreams, and think thoughts which wiseacres call foolishness.  \"That's splendid, Bob!\" cried Nancy, her eyes sparkling.  \"I should love you to go into Parliament--love to hear you speak in the House of Commons.  Why, you might be elected for St. Ia!  Dad has at great deal of influence there too, and could get you nominated.  But what things would you advocate?\"  \"I know,\" cried Bob.  \"I am going to create a peace party in England. Yes, I know some of your people have been soldiers, while my mother glories in the fact that many of the Trelawneys have been and are in the Army.  But think of the horrors of war.  Even now Europe is said to be sitting on a powder-barrel.  Every nation in Europe is being bled to death, in order to pay war taxes, even although at present there isn't a shadow of war in the sky.  Money that might be spent, and should be spent, on the betterment of the lives of the people and destroying, the possibility of poverty and want, is spent in Dreadnoughts and weapons to kill.  Hundreds of millions are being spent on the Army and Navy, while paltry sums are grudged for education and all those things which go to make up the manhood of the nation.\"  \"Yes, I know war is terrible, ghastly.  But how can you stop it?  You wouldn't advocate the destruction of our Army and Navy.  It would be madness, it would----\"  \"Not yet,\" interrupted Bob eagerly.  \"I would labour for a great European movement.  Take Germany for example.  The Germans are worse taxed than we are to pay for armaments, but the people don't want war. They are a peace-loving people.  The Kaiser doesn't want war.  He's said so a hundred times.  The Czar of Russia doesn't want war.  And yet hundreds upon hundreds of millions of money are being spent on war implements, while the people want bread.  Besides, a ghastly, warlike, unchristian spirit is kept alive by this eternal talk about the possibilities of war.  What is wanted is an agreement among the Governments of nations that there shall be no war.  We want to create an anti-war spirit in the hearts of the people, and so kill the terrible thing at the fountain-head.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" cried the girl, \"if all the nations could be persuaded to disarm, it would be splendid!  But, but----\"  \"It can be done,\" cried Bob.  \"I will give my life to it.  Everybody hates war in the abstract, but no one seems to throw himself heart and soul into a great peace crusade.  Even the Peace Society is half-hearted.  The cause of Peace hasn't been voiced of late years. That's it,\" and Bob rose to his feet excitedly; \"I see my work, Nancy. Neither your father nor any one else shall say that I'm unpractical, or that I sit still and do nothing.  Think of the glory of such a cause! Think of destroying for ever the ghastly horrors of war, of helping to bring about universal peace.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Nancy, \"it would be glorious, simply glorious.  I was only very little when the Boer War broke out, and when my eldest brother Roger went away to it, father gave a dinner, and all our friends came to bid him good-bye.  Although I was only a kiddie, I was allowed to sit up to it, and I remember some of the speeches that were made.  They promised him that he should be made a colonel and all that sort of thing, and there was such laughing and shouting.  Every one imagined it would be over in a few weeks; it seemed such a little thing to crush a few Boer farmers.  After that I used to watch dad's face as he read his newspaper, and wondered what he was so sad about.  Then one day some one brought him a letter which almost killed him.  I shall never forget it.  He staggered as though some one had struck him a blow, and groaned as if he were in agony.  Roger was killed.  It added years to dad's life, and he's never been the same since.\"  \"War is that kind of thing multiplied thousands of times,\" said Bob. \"There were unnumbered homes in England, yes, and in South Africa too, desolated by that war, when--when it ought to have been avoided.  Yes, my mind's made up.  I'm going into Parliament, and I'm going to make war against war.  The holiest and most Christlike work a man can undertake.  Shan't I tell your father to-night, Nancy?\"  \"No, no, not yet.  I'm afraid he might----  I'll prepare him little by little, and then, when the proper time comes, I'll tell you.  But, Bob,\" and the girl laughed gaily, \"I had almost to propose to you, hadn't I?\"  \"No,\" replied Bob.  \"I did the proposing, and you did the lecturing. That's what it'll be all our lives, I expect; but what do I care, as long as I have you?\"  \"I--I was afraid you were going to be a coward, though.\"  \"And you don't like cowards?\"  She became serious in a moment.  \"If there's anything I hate and despise, it's cowardice,\" she cried.  \"I think I could forgive anything but that.  It's--it's beneath even contempt.  Hark, what's that?\"  They heard a rustling sound behind them, and saw, close by, a newspaper blown towards them by the light summer breeze.  Bob put out his hand and caught it.  \"It's to-day's paper,\" he said. \"I haven't looked at mine to-day.\"  He read it almost mechanically.  Neither dreamed that this paper, carelessly dropped by a man who had come to see the famous rock, contained news on which depended not only the future of their own lives, but which altered the destinies of nations, and which turned a great part of Europe into a shambles.     CHAPTER III  This is what he read:     TERRIBLE TRAGEDY IN BOSNIA.    ASSASSINATION OF THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE   AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN THRONE.    BOMB THROWN INTO THE CAR OF THE ARCHDUKE   FERDINAND AND HIS CONSORT, THE DUCHESS OF   HOHENBERG.    OVERWHELMING INDIGNATION IN VIENNA.   GRIEF OF THE AGED EMPEROR.   These were the staring headlines which riveted the gaze of both, and for the moment made them silent.  \"Good heavens, how terrible!\" cried Nancy presently.  \"Ghastly beyond words,\" was Bob's reply.  \"It has come like a thunderbolt.  As I told you, I did not look at my paper this morning, and, as I have not been to St. Ia to-day, I saw no announcements.\"  \"And our papers were late this morning.  I have not seen them,\" rejoined Nancy.  \"Fancy the grief of the poor old Emperor!  Who did it?--and why was it done?\"  \"Evidently it was done by two young men, both anarchists, and both said to be Servians.\"  \"Aren't these anarchists terrible?  No king or queen in Europe seems to be safe.\"  \"This doesn't appear to have been done by anarchists in the usual sense of the term after all,\" said Bob, who hastily scanned the paper.  \"It seems there are suspicions of political causes.  This paper suggests that these fellows were agents of the Servian Government, who have a special grudge against the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, who was heir-presumptive to the Austrian Throne.  Are you interested in European politics, Nancy?\"  \"Not a bit.  I always skip foreign news.\"  \"If it is as this paper suggests, it might lead to serious complications.  You see, it was hoped by the Servians that at the close of the Balkan War they would be able to obtain a naval port on the Adriatic, and it is said they would have got it but for the Archduke. It is also commonly believed that a School of Servian Patriots have for years been struggling to make Bosnia and Herzegovina part of Greater Servia, owing to the preponderance of Serb population.  These two provinces, in spite of Russia, belong to Austria.\"  \"I suppose the Servians are awful people.  Always quarrelling and fighting, and that kind of thing,\" and Nancy crept closer to Bob as she spoke.  \"It's a wonderfully interesting part of Europe, although it was so little known before the war of the Balkan States with the Turks.  I say, Nancy, wouldn't it be fun to go there for our honeymoon?\"  \"It would be like going into a savage country.\"  \"Oh, no, not so bad as that.  I was talking a few weeks ago with a man who was a war correspondent during their squabble, and he told me a lot about Montenegro and Servia and Roumania.  He fairly fired my imagination, and made me long to go.  It would be great fun.\"  Nancy shook her head.  \"No, Bob,\" she said, with a blush, \"when that time comes, we'll go to some lovely spot somewhere on the Rhine, where we shall be among civilised people, and where there will be no possibility of meeting these half-civilised races.  But what do you think the Austrians will do?\"  \"Oh, of course, if this murder is simply a revolt of the anarchists, the murderers will be executed, and I suppose that will be the end of it; but if there is evidence which goes to show that they were emissaries of the Servian Government, it will lead to all sorts of complications.\"  \"What complications?\"  \"Well, of course, Austria will want an explanation from Servia, and if Servia doesn't give a satisfactory reply, there will be trouble.
