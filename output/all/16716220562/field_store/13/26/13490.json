This needs to be heated and water added each time it is used. This soil is put on pipes with a short stubby brush. The work when completed with the silvery joint and jet black borders appears to the uninitiated very artistic and neat, but when the black soil is worn away the uneven edges of the joint appear, disclosing the reason for using a black soil that covers all defects. The mechanic of today who takes pride in his ability for good workmanship will not cover his work with black soil.  It can readily be seen that the use of lampblack soil encourages poor workmanship, while the use of paste forces, to a certain extent, good workmanship on the part of the mechanic.  Before soil or paste is applied, the pipe needs to be cleansed. Grease and dirt accumulate on the pipe. The methods employed to remove all foreign matter are simply to scrape the surface with fine sand or emery paper; sand and water will also answer for this purpose. This cleans the surface and allows the soil or paste to stick to the pipe.   MAKING DIFFERENT SOLDER JOINTS  The tools used in making the different solder joints as described and illustrated in this chapter are shown in Fig. 14.  CUP JOINT.--The materials necessary for the work (Fig. 15): 12 inches of 1/2-inch AA lead pipe, paste, rosin, 1/2 and 1/2 solder.  If a gas furnace is not on the bench to heat the iron, then a gasoline furnace is necessary.  Each of the following operations must be done thoroughly to insure a perfect job:       _First_, with the SAW cut off 12 inches of 1/2-inch AA lead pipe      from the coil. When cutting off a piece of lead pipe from a coil or      reel, always straighten out 1 foot more than is needed. This leaves      1 foot of straight pipe always on the coil.       [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Tools used for making solder joints.]       _Second_, with the flat side of the RASP, square the ends of the      12-inch piece of pipe. (A good way to do this is to hold the pipe      at right angles with the edge of the bench, run the rasp across the      end of the pipe, keeping the rasp _parallel_ with the edge of the      bench. Apply this to all work when necessary to square the ends of      pipe.)       _Third_, cut the pipe with the saw, making two pieces each 6 inches      in length.       _Fourth_, square the ends just cut.       _Fifth_, rasp the edges of one end as shown in the cut. Hold the      work in such a way that the stroke of the rasp can be seen without      moving the pipe.       _Sixth_, take the other 6-inch piece of pipe and with the TURN PIN      spread one end of it. The turn pin must be struck squarely in the      center with the HAMMER, the point of the turn pin being kept in the      center of the pipe. The pipe should be turned after each blow of      the hammer. The pipe must not rest on the bench but should be held      in the hand while using the turn pin. If the pipe bends, it can be      straightened with BENDING IRONS. If the pipe is spread more on one      side than the other, the turn pin should be hit on the opposite      side so as to even the spread.       [Illustration: FIG. 15.]       _Seventh_, when the pipes are properly fitted, moisten the tips of      the fingers with paste and rub the paste on parts of pipe marked      \"paste.\" Put the pipe aside to allow the paste to dry.       _Eighth_, put the soldering iron on to heat.       _Ninth_, with the SHAVE HOOK scrape off the paste and surface dirt      as shown in the figure. The inside of the cup will look bright, but      must be scraped.       [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Cup joint.]       _Tenth_, place the two pieces into position as shown in Fig. 16,      sprinkle rosin on the joint, melt a few drops of solder on the      joint and with the iron melt the solder on the joint, drawing the      iron around the pipe keeping the solder melted around the iron all      the time.       _Eleventh_, fill the joint with solder and continue to draw the hot      iron around the joint until a smooth and bright surface is      obtained. To master the correct use of the soldering iron in this      work, considerable practice will be necessary.  OVERCAST JOINTS.--(Fig. 17.)       NOTE.--Each operation must be performed thoroughly.       _First_, saw off from a coil of 1-1/2-inch D lead pipe a 10-inch      piece of pipe.       _Second_, square the ends with the rasp, as previously explained.       _Third_, take a 1-1/2-inch DRIFT PLUG and drive through the pipe      (Fig. 18).       _Fourth_, saw the pipe into two pieces of 5 inches each.       _Fifth_, square the ends of the pipe with the rasp.       _Sixth_, rasp off the outside edge of one end of the pipe as shown.       _Seventh_, rasp off the inside edge of one end of the pipe.       _Eighth_, finish rasped surfaces with a file. Both surfaces should      have the same angle.       [Illustration: FIG. 17.]       [Illustration: FIG. 18.]       [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Overcast joint.]       _Ninth_, with a shave hook scrape the outside surface of each pipe      for about 1 inch from the end.       _Tenth_, put the soldering iron on to heat.       _Eleventh_, paste paper on the joint as shown in the cut.       _Twelfth_, fit the pieces together and lay on the bench. Drop some      melted solder on the joint and with the hot iron proceed to flow      the solder around the joint by turning the pipe. Use plenty of flux      (rosin). The pipes must be tacked in three or four places at first      or they will have a tendency to spread.       _Thirteenth_, to finish the joint, lift the iron straight up.  This joint when finished will have a bright smooth finish. The two foregoing joints need considerable practice and should be perfectly mastered before going on to the next job.   SEAMS  A description of the making of wiped seams for lead-lined tanks will not be attempted as very few are made now. The plumber, however, is often called upon to make a seam joining two pieces of sheet lead. The beginner will do well to go over the following exercise carefully and practice it thoroughly.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Flat seam.]  MATERIALS.--Two pieces of 8-pound sheet lead, 6 by 10 inches each; one bar of 1/2 and 1/2 solder; paste, paper, and rosin.  TOOLS.--Rasp, shave hook, and soldering iron.  The 10-inch side of each piece is rasped and fitted together. The edges are cleaned and paper is pasted on leaving 1/4 inch for solder. Paste without the paper can be put on. This will make a joint 1/2 inch wide.  Apply the rosin to the joint, then with the heated iron and some solder tack the seam on the top, then on the bottom and middle. This will prevent the seam from spreading when the lead is heated. Solder and rosin can now be put on the full length of the joint. With a hot iron proceed to float the solder down the seam. The soldering iron must not rest at full length on the pieces of lead or it will melt the lead and render the work useless. The solder will flow and form a clean neat seam, if the iron is at the right heat and the right amount of solder is put on. If the iron is too hot, the solder will flow instantly when the iron is laid on it and the solder will disappear as it runs through the seam. If the iron is too cold the solder will not melt enough to flow. Too much solder on the seam will cause it to overflow, that is, the solder will spread beyond the papered edges. After a little practice this surplus solder can be drawn in on the seam with the iron and carried along the seam to some point that has not enough solder. When the seam is completed the edges should be perfectly straight and even. The iron is carried along the seam with one stroke which makes the seam appear smooth and bright.     CHAPTER III  MIXTURES OF SOLDERS FOR SOLDERING IRON AND WIPING. CARE OF SOLDERS. MELTING POINTS OF METALS AND ALLOYS   The importance of good solder, that is, solder correctly mixed and thoroughly cleaned, should not be overlooked. Work is more quickly and neatly done and the job presents a more finished appearance when solder that is correctly made is used.  The solder used in the following work with the soldering iron is called 1/2 and 1/2. This means 1/2 (50 per cent.) lead and 1/2 (50 per cent.) tin.  In the mixture of solder, only pure metals should be used. The lead should be melted first and all the dross cleaned off. The tin should then be added and mixed.  The solder to be used in wiping the joints in the following chapter is a mixture of 37 per cent. tin and 63 per cent. lead. This is called wiping solder.  The following table gives the melting points, etc.:       ---------------+---------+------------------------------------------                     | Melting |           Metal     |  point  |      Mixture      ---------------+---------+------------------------------------------      Sulphur        |  228    | Pure      Tin            |  446    | Pure      Lead           |  626    | Pure      Zinc           |  680    | Pure      Fine solder    |  400    | 50 per cent. tin, 50 per cent. lead (wt.)      Wiping solder  |  370    | 37 per cent. tin, 63 per cent. lead (wt.)      ---------------+---------+------------------------------------------  To recognize fine solder, run off a bar into a mold and let it cool. If there is a frosted streak in the center, the metal has not enough tin. The surface should be bright. To recognize wiping solder, pour some on a brick. When this is cool, the top should be frosty and the under side should have four or five bright spots. The amount poured on the brick should be about the size of a half dollar. If poured on iron, the metal will cool too quickly and show bright all over the under side.  TO MAKE 1/2 AND 1/2 SOLDER OR PLUMBER'S FINE SOLDER.--The possibility of getting pure clean metals to mix solder is very remote. Old pieces of lead pipe, lead trap, old block tin pipe are used to make solder when pure metals are not at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25269"],["title","Elements of Plumbing (#3)"],["body","nd.       _First_, in a cast-iron pot melt the lead to about 800°, or a dull      red.       _Second_, clean off the dross.       _Third_, add (to a 15-pound pot) 1/2 pound of sulphur in three      applications. Each time mix the sulphur thoroughly with the metal      with a long stick.       _Fourth_, add tin before the last application of sulphur. Mix      thoroughly.       _Fifth_, pour off two bars and look for the frosty streak in the      center. Add a little more tin, if necessary.  TO MIX WIPING SOLDER.--       _First_, proceed as described in 1/2 and 1/2, melting the metals      and _burning_ out with sulphur, adding the percentage of tin      according to the preceding table. Then test the solder for bright      spots on the under side.       _Second_, keep the metal thoroughly mixed when burning and keep      all dross cleaned off the surface.  The working heat of wiping solder is 500°F. Sulphur is used to collect all zinc and dross. The sulphur should come in contact with all parts of the metal. This is why the metal should be stirred when the sulphur is put in.  A few good points in the economical care of solder are listed below.  CARE OF 1/2 AND 1/2 SOLDER.--       _First_, do not drop melted solder on the floor or dirty bench.       _Second_, use all small ends by melting on a new bar.       _Third_, put clean paper under work and use droppings.       _Fourth_, have the mold free from dirt when pouring.  CARE OF WIPING SOLDER.--       _First_, do not heat red hot.       _Second_, do not file brass where the filings will get into the      solder.       _Third_, do not allow lead chips to get into the solder.       _Fourth_, clean the solder occasionally.       _Fifth_, learn to distinguish solder from lead by its hardness.       _Sixth_, have different-shaped pot for lead and solder.       _Seventh_, do not _tin_ brass by dipping into solder.       _Eighth_, do not put cold or wet ladle into hot solder.  A pot holding about 15 pounds of solder is the size commonly in use.     CHAPTER IV  MAKING AND CARE OF WIPING CLOTHS   A good wiping cloth is essential for wiping joints. The exact size and the flexibility of the cloth depend a great deal upon the mechanic who handles the cloth. Some mechanics like a stiff cloth, but the writer has always used a flexible cloth. The sizes, shape, and methods of folding and breaking in as shown in Fig. 21 below have proved successful. Cloths made of whalebone ticking are inexpensive and make the best for ordinary use.  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Folding a wiping cloth.]       Size of cloth open               Size of cloth folded      14-1/2 by 14-1/2 inches  equals  3-1/4 by  3-1/4 inches      13-1/2 by 13-1/2 inches  equals  3     by  3     inches       8-1/2 by 12-1/2 inches  equals  2     by  3     inches  For the joint-wiping jobs to follow, the above sizes are the best. The largest size, 14-1/2 by 14-1/2 inches is used for _catch cloth_. The 13-1/2 by 13-1/2 inches is the _wiping cloth_. The 8-1/2 by 12-1/2 inches is the _branch cloth_.  Proceed as follows to cut and complete a cloth:       _First_, lay the ticking on the flat bench and square the sides      14-1/2 by 14-1/2 inches.       _Second_, the ticking should be cut off with shears and not torn      or cut with a knife.       _Third_, fold as shown in the cut.  Each fold should be moistened with a little water and pressed with a hot iron. The cloth should not be pulled or stretched, but should be kept as square as possible.  The first and second folds require a little care; the corners when folded to the center should be kept in a little, thus making the outside edge slightly rounded. If this is done, the corners will not stick out when the cloth is finished. After the cloth is carefully folded, pressed, and dried, take a needle and thread and sew the open corners about 1/2 inch in from the edge of the cloth. By carefully studying the cut, one can readily see each operation and, by following directions, make a perfect cloth.  When the cloth is done, an amount of oil sufficient to soak through about three layers of cloth should be applied and then rubbed on a smooth surface. The oil should be rubbed in well about the edges. It will not be necessary to apply anything else to the cloth to prepare it for wiping. Paste, soil, chalk, etc., are not needed and do not benefit the cloth. When using oil on the cloth, it must not be used too freely, that is, the cloth must not be soaked in oil, as oil is a rapid conductor of heat and the cloth would soon become too hot to handle.  CARE OF WIPING CLOTHS.--The ticking will burn if allowed to become too hot. If hot solder is poured directly on the cloth, it will soon burn and be destroyed.  Keep the surface on both sides of the cloth well oiled.  Use both sides of the cloth.  Use both wiping edges of the cloth.  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Wiping cloth folded has 16 thicknesses of ticking.]  When the cloth is not in use, it should not be thrown in with the other tools and allowed to curl up into all sorts of shapes, but should be kept in some flat place. A good way to keep the cloths is to have two pieces of wood between which the cloths may be kept and held there by means of a strap. The length of time which a wiping cloth can be used depends a great deal upon its making and upon the care which is given it.     CHAPTER V  PREPARING AND WIPING JOINTS   When the writer first started to carry the tools for a plumber and to prepare joints for wiping, the remark was often heard that joint wiping would soon be a thing of the past. I have heard this many times since from many different sources. Personally, I fail to see the passing of the wiped joint. More lead pipe is being made today than ever before, which goes to show that lead pipe is being used and the only successful way of joining is with the wiped joint. Some plumbers' helpers of today seem to think that joint wiping is of no account. To a certain extent, I can sympathize with them. Most of these boys are learning a trade in large cities and working for concerns that do nothing but a large contracting business. This large work is carried on differently from the small work. Wrought-iron or steel pipes are used to a great extent in this work and a very small amount of lead is used. Sometimes the job will be completed without the use of lead. The boy who works continually on this kind of work soon comes to think that lead pipes are no longer in use. The writer has found that a boy who has learned to do nothing but screw-pipe work is absolutely lost and cannot perform the duties of a plumber, other than screw-pipe work. It must be borne in mind that lead pipe and cast-iron pipe work are being used today in all parts of the country and in some parts more than in others. Therefore, the boy must grasp all branches of the trade that he has chosen to follow and not be a one-sided man. Joint wiping belongs to the plumber alone. The plumbing trade differs from all other trades in that it has joint wiping for its distinctive feature.  A few attempts at joint wiping will convince the beginner that it is not the easiest thing in the world to learn. Let me caution the beginner not to get discouraged. He must have patience and a firm resolve to master the art of joint wiping and not let it master him and keep him back.  So, as we now start on exercises of joint wiping, let the beginner constantly keep in mind that all boys must become perfectly skilled in the art of joint wiping before they can be considered plumbers. Keep in mind also that the examination that one must take to get a plumber's license contains an actual exercise in joint wiping. The one word of advice is not to get discouraged. Continued practice is the only way to success.  The soldering iron is, or should be, conquered by this time. As joint wiping is the next exercise, I shall go over a few general points that experience has taught me and cannot fail to be of assistance to the beginner if they are heeded. In fact, to become proficient, the beginner should remember all the points suggested under this heading. It is necessary in wiping to have good solder. In the chapter on solder, I have given the correct mixtures and how to recognize the proper mixtures. The place where wiping is to be done should be considered. No draught should be allowed to blow across the work as it tends to chill the solder and pipe. Proper support for the work should be procured. If gasoline is to be used for fuel to heat the solder, make sure that the tank is full before starting, otherwise the fire may go out just when the heat is needed most and the solder in the pot has become too cool to wipe with. Have a catch pan and keep all the solder droppings to put back into the pot, otherwise the solder will pile up and the fingers are likely to be pushed into the pile and badly burned. Hold the ladle about 2 inches above the work, the catch cloth about 1 inches below. Do not drop the solder in the same place. Keep moving the ladle. Do not pour the solder on the pipe in a steady stream, but drop it on. It is not a large amount of solder that is wanted on the joint at first, it is heat that is needed. This can be secured better by dropping the solder on than by pouring a large quantity on the pipe. The edges of the joint cool very quickly; therefore heat the edges well and keep them covered with molten solder until the joint is ready to wipe. When preparing joints for wiping, always do the work thoroughly and fit the pieces together tightly so that no solder can get through.  POINTS TO REMEMBER.--       _First_, good solder.       _Second_, place of wiping.       _Third_, support.       _Fourth_, full tank of gasoline.       _Fifth_, drip pan.       _Sixth_, ladle 2 inches above the work.       _Seventh_, cloth 1 inches below the work.       _Eighth_, move the ladle continually.       _Ninth_, _drop_ the solder.       _Tenth_, _heat_, not solder wanted at first.       _Eleventh_, heat the edges."]]]
