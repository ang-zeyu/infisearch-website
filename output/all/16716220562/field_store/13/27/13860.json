Bucongo was called before a conference of the Mission and reprimanded.  He offered excuses, but there was sufficient evidence to prove that this enthusiastic Christian had gone systematically to work, to found what amounted to a religion of his own.  The position was a little delicate, and any other Order than the Jesuits might have hesitated to tackle a reform which meant losing a very large membership.  The fate of Bucongo's congregation had been decided when, in his anger, he took canoe, and travelling for half a day, came to the principal Mission.  Father Carpentier, full-bearded, red of face and brawny of arm, listened in the shade of his hut, pulling thoughtfully at a long pipe.  \"And so, Pentini,\" concluded Bucongo, \"even Sandi puts shame upon me because I am a cross-God man, and he by all accounts is of the water-God ju-ju.\"  The father eyed this perturbed sheep of his flock thoughtfully.  \"O Bucongo,\" he said gently, \"in the river lands are many beasts. Those which fly and which swim; those that run swiftly and that hide in the earth. Now who of these is right?\"  \"Lord, they are all right but are of different ways,\" said Bucongo.  Father Carpentier nodded.  \"Also in the forest are two ants--one who lives in tree nests, and one who has a home deep in the ground. They are of a kind, and have the same business. Yet God put it into the little heads of one to climb trees, and of the other to burrow deeply. Both are right and neither are wrong, save when the tree ant meets the ground ant and fights him. Then both are wrong.\"  The squatting Bucongo rose sullenly.  \"Master,\" he said, \"these mysteries are too much for a poor man. I think I know a better ju-ju, and to him I go.\"  \"You have no long journey, Chief,\" said the father sternly, \"for they tell me stories of ghost dances in the forest and a certain Bucongo who is the leader of these--and of a human sacrifice. Also of converts who are branded with a cross of hot iron.\"  The chief looked at his sometime tutor with face twisted and puckered with rage, and turning without a word, walked back to his canoe.  The next morning Father Carpentier sent a messenger to Sanders bearing an urgent letter, and Sanders read the closely written lines with a troubled frown.  He put down the letter and came out on to the deck, to find Hamilton fishing over the side of the steamer. Hamilton looked round.  \"Anything wrong?\" he asked quickly.  \"Bucongo of the Lesser Isisi is wrong,\" said Sanders. \"I have heard of his religious meetings and have been a little worried--there will be a big ju-ju palaver or I'm very much mistaken. Where is Bones?\"  \"He has taken my sister up the creek--Bones says there are any number of egrets' nests there, and I believe he is right.\"  Sanders frowned again.  \"Send a canoe to fetch him back,\" he said. \"That is Bucongo's territory, and I don't trust the devil.\"  \"Which one--Bones or Bucongo?\" asked Hamilton innocently.  But Sanders was not feeling humorous.         *       *       *       *       *  At that precise moment Bones was sitting before the most fantastic religious assembly that ecclesiastic or layman had ever attended.  Fate and Bones had led the girl through a very pleasant forest glade--they left the light-draught _Wiggle_ half a mile down stream owing to the shoals which barred their progress, and had come upon Bucongo in an exalted moment.  With the assurance that he was doing no more than intrude upon one of those meetings which the missionizing Chief of the Lesser Isisi so frequently held, Bones stood on the outer fringe of the circle which sat in silence to watch an unwilling novitiate getting acquainted with Bucongo's god.  The novice was a girl, and she lay before an altar of stones surmounted by a misshapen _beti_ who glared with his one eye upon the devout gathering. The novice lay rigid, for the excellent reason that she was roped foot and hands to two pegs in the ground.  Before the altar itself was a fire of wood in which two irons were heating.  Bones did not take this in for a moment, for he was gazing open-mouthed at Bucongo. On his head was an indubitable mitre, but around the mitre was bound a strip of skin from which was suspended a circle of dangling monkey tails. For cope he wore a leopard's robe. His face was streaked red with camwood, and around his eyes he had painted two white circles.  He was in the midst of a frenzied address when the two white visitors came upon the scene, and his hand was outstretched to take the red branding-iron when the girl at Bones's side, with a little gasp of horror, broke into the circle, and wrenching the rough iron from the attendant's hand, flung it towards the circle of spectators, which widened in consequence.  \"How dare you--how dare you!\" she demanded breathlessly, \"you horrible-looking man!\"  Bucongo glared at her but said nothing; then he turned to meet Bones.  In that second of time Bucongo had to make a great decision, and to overcome the habits of a lifetime. Training and education to the dominion of the white man half raised his hand to the salute; something that boiled and bubbled madly and set his shallow brain afire, something that was of his ancestry, wild, unreasoning, brutish, urged other action. Bones had his revolver half drawn when the knobbly end of the chief's killing-spear struck him between the eyes, and he went down on his knees.  Thus it came about, that he found himself sitting before Bucongo, his feet and hands tied with native grass, with the girl at his side in no better case.  She was very frightened, but this she did not show. She had the disadvantage of being unable to understand the light flow of offensive badinage which passed between her captor and Bones.  \"O Tibbetti,\" said Bucongo, \"you see me as a god--I have finished with all white men.\"  \"Soon we shall finish with you, Bucongo,\" said Bones.  \"I cannot die, Tibbetti,\" said the other with easy confidence, \"that is the wonderful thing.\"  \"Other men have said that,\" said Bones in the vernacular, \"and their widows are wives again and have forgotten their widowhood.\"  \"This is a new ju-ju, Tibbetti,\" said Bucongo, a strange light in his eyes. \"I am the greatest of all cross-God men, and it is revealed to me that many shall follow me. Now you and the woman shall be the first of all white people to bear the mark of Bucongo the Blessed. And in the days to be you shall bare your breasts and say, 'Bucongo the Wonderful did this with his beautiful hands.'\"  Bones was in a cold sweat and his mouth was dry. He scarcely dare look at the girl by his side.  \"What does he say?\" she asked in a low voice. Bones hesitated, and then haltingly he stammered the translation of the threat.  She nodded.  \"O Bucongo,\" said Bones, with a sudden inspiration, \"though you do evil, I will endure. But this you shall do and serve me. Brand me alone upon the chest, and upon the back. For if we be branded separately we are bound to one another, and you see how ugly this woman is with her thin nose and her pale eyes; also she has long hair like the grass which the weaver birds use for their nests.\"  He spoke loudly, eagerly, and it seemed convincingly, for Bucongo was in doubt. Truly the woman by all standards was very ugly. Her face was white and her lips thin. She was a narrow woman too, he thought, like one underfed.  \"This you shall do for me, Bucongo,\" urged Bones; \"for gods do not do evil things, and it would be bad to marry me to this ugly woman who has no hips and has an evil tongue.\"  Bucongo was undecided.  \"A god may do no evil,\" he said; \"but I do not know the ways of white men. If it be true, then I will mark you twice, Tibbetti, and you shall be my man for ever; and the woman I will not touch.\"  \"Cheer oh!\" said Bones.  \"What are you saying--will he let us go?\" asked the girl.  \"I was sayin' what a jolly row there'll be,\" lied Bones; \"and he was sayin' that he couldn't think of hurtin' a charmin' lady like you. Shut your eyes, dear old Miss Hamilton.\"  She shut them quickly, half fainting with terror, for Bucongo was coming towards them, a blazing iron in his hand, a smile of simple benevolence upon his not unintelligent face.  \"This shall come as a blessing to you, Tibbetti,\" he said almost jovially.  Bones shut his teeth and waited.  The hot iron was scorching his silk shirt when a voice hailed the high-priest of the newest of cults.  \"O Bucongo,\" it said.  Bucongo turned with a grimace of fear and cringed backward before the levelled Colt of Mr. Commissioner Sanders.  \"Tell me now,\" said Sanders in his even tone, \"can such a man as you die? Think, Bucongo.\"  \"Lord,\" said Bucongo huskily, \"I think I can die.\"  \"We shall see,\" said Sanders.         *       *       *       *       *  It was not until after dinner that night that the girl had recovered sufficiently to discuss her exciting morning.  \"I think you were an awful brute,\" she addressed her unabashed brother. \"You were standing in the wood listening to and seeing everything, and never came till the last minute.\"  \"It was my fault,\" interrupted Sanders. \"I wanted to see how far the gentle Bucongo would go.\"  \"Dooced thoughtless,\" murmured Bones under his breath, but audible.  She looked at him long and earnestly then turned again to her brother.  \"There is one thing I want to know,\" she said. \"What was Bones saying when he talked to that horrible man? Do you know that Bones was scowling at me as though I was ... I hardly know how to express it. Was he saying nice things?\"  Hamilton looked up at the awning, and cleared his throat.  \"Play the game, dear old sir and brother-officer,\" croaked Bones.  \"He said----\" began Hamilton.  \"Live an' let live,\" pleaded Bones, all of a twitter. \"_Esprit de corps_ an' discretion, jolly old captain.\"  Hamilton looked at his subordinate steadily.  \"He asked to be branded twice in order that you might not be branded once,\" he said quietly.  The girl stared at Bones, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25803"],["title","The Keepers of the King's Peace (#6)"],["body","eyes were full of tears.  \"Oh, Bones!\" she said, with a little catch in her voice, \"you ... you are a sportsman.\"  \"Carry on,\" said Bones incoherently, and wept a little at the realization of that magnificent moment.     CHAPTER III  THE MAKER OF STORMS   Everybody knows that water drawn from rivers is very bad water, for the rivers are the Roads of the Dead, and in the middle of those nights when the merest rind of a moon shows, and this slither of light and two watchful stars form a triangle pointing to the earth, the spirits rise from their graves and walk, \"singing deadly songs,\" towards the lower star which is the source of all rivers. If you should be--which God forbid--on one of those lonely island graveyards on such nights you will see strange sights.  The broken cooking-pots which rest on the mounds and the rent linen which flutters from little sticks stuck about the graves, grow whole and new again. The pots are red and hot as they come from the fire, and the pitiful cloths take on the sheen of youth and fold themselves about invisible forms. None may see the dead, though it is said that you may see the babies.  These the wise men have watched playing at the water's edge, crowing and chuckling in the universal language of their kind, staggering groggily along the shelving beach with outspread arms balancing their uncertain steps. On such nights when M'sa beckons the dead world to the source of all rivers, the middle islands are crowded with babies--the dead babies of a thousand years. Their spirits come up from the unfathomed deeps of the great river and call their mortality from graves.  \"How may the waters of the river be acceptable?\" asks the shuddering N'gombi mother.  Therefore the N'gombi gather their water from the skies in strange cisterns of wicker, lined with the leaf of a certain plant which is impervious, and even carry their drinking supplies with them when they visit the river itself.  There was a certain month in the year, which will be remembered by all who attempted the crossing of the Kasai Forest to the south of the N'gombi country, when pools and rivulets suddenly dried--so suddenly, indeed, that even the crocodiles, who have an instinct for coming drought, were left high and dry, in some cases miles from the nearest water, and when the sun rose in a sky unflecked by cloud and gave place at nights to a sky so brilliant and so menacing in their fierce and fiery nearness that men went mad.  Toward the end of this month, when an exasperating full moon advertised a continuance of the dry spell by its very whiteness, the Chief Koosoogolaba-Muchini, or, as he was called, Muchini, summoned a council of his elder men, and they came with parched throats and fear of death.  \"All men know,\" said Muchini, \"what sorrow has come to us, for there is a more powerful ju-ju in the land than I remember. He has made M'shimba M'shamba afraid so that he has gone away and walks no more in the forest with his terrible lightning. Also K'li, the father of pools, has gone into the earth and all his little children, and I think we shall die, every one of us.\"  There was a skinny old man, with a frame like a dried goatskin, who made a snuffling noise when he spoke.  \"O Muchini,\" he said, \"when I was a young man there was a way to bring M'shimba M'shamba which was most wonderful. In those days we took a young maiden and hung her upon a tree----\"  \"Those old ways were good,\" interrupted Muchini; \"but I tell you, M'bonia, that we can follow no more the old ways since Sandi came to the land, for he is a cruel man and hanged my own mother's brother for that fine way of yours. Yet we cannot sit and die because of certain magic which the Stone Breaker is practising.\"  Now Bula Matadi (\"The Stone Breaker\") was in those days the mortal enemy of the N'gombi people, who were wont to ascribe all their misfortunes to his machinations. To Bula Matadi (which was the generic name by which the Government of the Congo Free State was known) was traceable the malign perversity of game, the blight of crops, the depredations of weaver birds. Bula Matadi encouraged leopards to attack isolated travellers, and would on great occasions change the seasons of the year that the N'gombi's gardens might come to ruin.  \"It is known from one end of the earth to the other that I am a most cunning man,\" Muchini went on, stroking his muscular arm, a trick of self-satisfied men in their moments of complacence; \"and whilst even the old men slept, I, Koosoogolaba-Muchini, the son of the terrible and crafty G'sombo, the brother of Eleni-N'gombi, I went abroad with my wise men and my spies and sought out devils and ghosts in places where even the bravest have never been,\" he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper, \"to the Ewa-Ewa Mongo, the Very Place of Death.\"  The gasp of horror from his audience was very satisfying to this little chief of the Inner N'gombi, and here was a moment suitable for his climax.  \"And behold!\" he cried.  By his side was something covered with a piece of native cloth. This covering he removed with a flourish and revealed a small yellow box.  It was most certainly no native manufacture, for its angles were clamped with neat brass corner-pieces set flush in the polished wood.  The squatting councillors watched their lord as with easy familiarity he opened the lid.  There were twenty tiny compartments, and in each was a slender glass tube, corked and heavily sealed, whilst about the neck of each tube was a small white label covered with certain devil marks.  Muchini waited until the sensation he had prepared had had its full effect.  \"By the Great River which runs to the Allamdani,\"[1] he said slowly and impressively, \"were white men who had been sent by Bula Matadi to catch ghosts. For I saw them, I and my wise men, when the moon was calling all spirits. They were gathered by the river with little nets and little gourds and they caught the waters. Also they caught little flies and other foolish things and took them to their tent. Then my young men and I waited, and when all were gone away we went to their tents and found his magic box--which is full of devils of great power--Ro!\"  [Footnote 1: This was evidently the Sanga River.]  He leapt to his feet, his eye gleaming. Across the starry dome of the sky there had flicked a quick flare of light.  There came a sudden uneasy stirring of leaves, a hushed whisper of things as though the forest had been suddenly awakened from sleep.  Then an icy cold breeze smote his cheek, and staring upward, he saw the western stars disappearing in swathes behind the tumbling clouds.  \"M'shimba M'shamba--he lives!\" he roared, and the crash of thunder in the forest answered him.  Bosambo, Chief of the Ochori, was on the furthermost edge of the forest, for he was following the impulse of his simple nature and was hunting in a country where he had no right to be. The storm (which he cursed, having no scruples about river and water, and being wholly sceptical as to ghosts) broke with all its fury over his camp and passed. Two nights later, he sat before the rough hut his men had built, discussing the strange ways of the antelope, when he suddenly stopped and listened, lowering his head till it almost touched the ground.  Clear to his keen ears came the rattle of the distant lokali--the drum that sends messages from village to village and from nation to nation.  \"O Secundi,\" said Bosambo, with a note of seriousness in his voice, \"I have not heard that call for many moons--for it is the war call of the N'gombi.\"  \"Lord, it is no war call,\" said the old man, shifting his feet for greater comfort, \"yet it is a call which may mean war, for it calls spears to a dance, and it is strange, for the N'gombi have no enemies.\"  \"All men are the enemies of the N'gombi,\" Bosambo quoted a river saying as old as the sun.  He listened again, then rose.  \"You shall go back and gather me a village of spears, and bring them to the borderland near the road that crosses the river,\" he said.  \"On my life,\" said the other.  Muchini, Chief of the Inner N'gombi, a most inflated man and a familiar of magical spirits, gathered his spears to some purpose, for two days later Bosambo met him by his border and the chiefs greeted one another between two small armies.  \"Which way do you go, Muchini?\" asked Bosambo.  Now, between Muchini and the Chief of the Ochori was a grievance dating back to the big war, when Bosambo had slain the N'gombi chief of the time with his own hands.  \"I go to the river to call a palaver of all free men,\" said Muchini; \"for I tell you this, Bosambo, that I have found a great magic which will make us greater than Sandi, and it has been prophesied that I shall be a king over a thousand times a thousand spears. For I have a small box which brings even M'shimba to my call.\"  Bosambo, a head and shoulders taller than the other, waved his hand towards the forest path which leads eventually to the Ochori city.  \"Here is a fine moment for you, Muchini,\" he said, \"and you shall try your great magic on me and upon my young men. For I say that you do not go by this way, neither you nor your warriors, since I am the servant of Sandi and of his King, and he has sent me here to keep his peace; go back to your village, for this is the way to Death.\"  Muchini glared at his enemy.  \"Yet this way I go, Bosambo,\" he said huskily, and looked over his shoulder towards his followers.  Bosambo swung round on one heel, an arm and a leg outstretched in the attitude of an athlete who is putting the shot. Muchini threw up his wicker shield and pulled back his stabbing-spear, but he was a dead man before the weapon was poised.  Thus ended the war, and the N'gombi folk went home, never so much as striking a blow for the yellow box which Bosambo claimed for himself as his own personal loot.  At the time, Mr. Commissioner Sanders, C.M.G., was blissfully ignorant of the miraculous happenings which have been recorded. He was wholly "]]]
