I've already asked Solomon Owl's opinion about this matter; and he advises me to take my child away from you by force, if necessary.\"  \"There's no sense in waiting any longer,\" one of Mr. Chippy's cousins interrupted. \"Let's go right in and seize the lad!\"  At that the mob crowded round Rusty Wren's door. And the pert gentleman who had just spoken thrust his head through the opening.  That, however, was as far as he was able to go. His shoulders were altogether too broad for the small, round passage. And though his relations attempted to push him into the house, they soon saw that they would never succeed in their undertaking.  \"Let me try!\" another of Mr. Chippy's cousins cried. But he had no better luck than the first.  Then each of the fourteen remaining cousins--and then Mr. Chippy himself--had his turn at the door. But every one of them found that he was about two sizes too big to squeeze through it.  Rusty Wren, watching then from inside his house, couldn't help laughing, although it was really no joke.  Though he was usually very mild, Mr. Chippy grew terribly angry the moment he heard Rusty's laughter. His sixteen cousins began to scold, too. Again they tried to crowd through Rusty Wren's door. And they made such an uproar that when Johnnie Green stepped out of the farmhouse before breakfast he couldn't help noticing them.  \"What's going on here?\" he cried. And he hurried to his \"wren house,\" as he called Rusty's home, and drove away the noisy visitors.  Then he shinned up the old cherry tree, to peep inside it. And as soon as he reached the tin can which was Rusty's home Johnnie Green thought he heard an unusual cry within it.  \"That doesn't sound like a wren!\" he exclaimed. \"It sounds exactly like a chipping sparrow!\" Then, as he looked, he saw Chippy, Jr.'s, head, with its bright bay cap, peer through the mouth of the syrup can.  \"There's a chippy inside my wren house!\" Johnnie Green shouted to his father, who had come to a window to see what was going on. \"How can I get him out?\"  \"Wait a moment!\" said Farmer Green. And soon he came and handed Johnnie a can-opener.  \"Cut out the end of the can!\" he directed. \"Then you'll be able to reach in and get the little beggar.\"  Naturally, Chippy, Jr., did not like to be called a \"beggar.\" But he couldn't very well prevent Farmer Green from saying whatever he pleased. So he kept still, while Johnnie Green quickly opened a great hole in Rusty's house. Then Johnnie carefully lifted Chippy, Jr., out of his prison and gave him a toss into the air.  That frightened young gentleman wasted no time. He stopped to touch his cap to nobody, but flew away to his home in the wild grapevine, on the stone wall, as fast as he could go.  Though he had kept quiet, the whole Wren family had made a great uproar. Glad as they were to get rid of their troublesome guest, they objected to having the whole front of their house torn out.  Indeed, Mrs. Rusty began to get ready to move out at once. And everybody knows that moving is no joke--especially if one has six children.  But Johnnie Green bent the tin into place again, so that it was almost the same as new. In fact, the house was even better than ever, because it was more airy.  And Rusty and his wife were so glad to see the last of Chippy, Jr., that afterward they never objected in the least when Johnnie Green called them \"my wrens.\" They had discovered that he was a good friend to have.     XX  AN INVITATION   Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, lived in the reeds on the bank of Black Creek. Although everybody called him \"Long Bill,\" like Rusty Wren he was actually short and chubby. His bill, however, was much longer than Rusty's. You see, he belonged to one branch of the Marsh Wren family; and they all had bills like that.  Long Bill Wren always claimed that his real name was William; but people generally smiled when he made that statement.  It was not often that Rusty met this cousin of his, for Rusty seldom ventured so far from home as Black Creek. And being very fond of water, Long Bill did not care to spend any of his valuable time in Farmer Green's dooryard.  Of course, there was the duck pond not far away--and the river, too. But the only water really close to Rusty's home was the watering-trough. And that was entirely too small to please Long Bill Wren. So no one ever saw him around the farm buildings.  For a long time Rusty had neither seen nor heard of his cousin, when one day Jolly Robin knocked at his door.  \"I won't come in,\" said Jolly (of course he couldn't have, anyhow--being far too big to get through Rusty's door!). \"I won't come in, for I merely want to give you a message. Old Mr. Crow came to the orchard to-day and he asked me to deliver an invitation from your cousin who lives near Black Creek.\"  \"That's Long Bill!\" Rusty Wren exclaimed.  Jolly Robin nodded. \"He's going to have a party,\" he explained. \"And he wants you to come to it.\"  \"When will it take place?\" Rusty asked eagerly.  \"To-morrow!\" said Jolly Robin.  \"It's rather short notice,\" Rusty Wren observed.  \"Mr. Crow has been keeping the message for you for some time,\" Jolly Robin explained. \"He said he thought it would be more of a surprise if you didn't know about the party too soon.\"  \"We'll be there, anyhow,\" Rusty's wife interrupted behind her husband's back. She had been listening with a good deal of interest to Jolly's message.  \"But you're not invited,\" Jolly Robin told her. \"This is a men's party--so Mr. Crow says.\"  \"You may tell old Mr. Crow that my husband won't be able to be present,\" Mrs. Rusty Wren snapped. \"He's going to be very busy to-morrow, for he promised to help me with my house-cleaning.\"  Rusty Wren looked worried. But he said nothing more just then. He wanted to go to his cousin's party. But he did not like to argue with his wife, especially in the presence of a neighbor.  Soon Jolly Robin said he must go back to the orchard, because he had to take care of his children while his wife went out to make a call.  Mrs. Rusty did not urge him to stay. And, since she seemed upset over something, Rusty thought it just as well if their visitor did not linger there too long.  \"I was just going to the orchard myself to hunt for insects,\" said Rusty. \"So I'll go with you.\"  Mrs. Rusty shot a quick look at him.  \"Remember! You're going to be busy at home to-morrow!\" she warned him.  \"Yes! yes!\" he said. And he seemed in a bit of a hurry to get to the orchard--it couldn't have been _to get away from home_.     XXI  OFF TO BLACK CREEK   As soon as they reached the orchard, Jolly Robin exclaimed, \"There's old Mr. Crow now, over there on the fence! He's come back to get your answer and take it to Long Bill Wren. I'll have to tell him you're sorry--but you're going to be too busy to-morrow to go to the party.\"  \"Tell him----\" said Rusty Wren--\"tell him that _although_ I expect to be busy, I am going to my cousin's party just the same.\"  Jolly Robin stopped and sat down on a branch of an apple tree, he was so surprised. \"My dear sir!\" he cried. \"You seem to have forgotten that your wife said you wouldn't be able to accept Long Bill's invitation.\"  \"My wife----\" said Rusty Wren--\"my wife sometimes makes mistakes. And this is one of them. I wouldn't miss my cousin's party for anything. And I don't intend to, either.\"  \"Good!\" cried Jolly Robin. \"I'm glad to see that you don't let your wife manage your affairs, though I _have_ heard differently about you, for some people say that----\" He stopped abruptly and looked carefully around. Whatever it may have been that he was about to say, for some reason he did not care to have his wife hear it. And he happened to think that perhaps Mrs. Robin might be near-by.  \"I don't care what people say,\" Rusty Wren told him. \"When my cousin gives a party it would be a shame if I couldn't go to it.\"  \"I quite agree with you,\" said Jolly Robin. \"And now I'll go and give old Mr. Crow your answer.\"  \"One moment!\" Rusty Wren exclaimed. \"What time will my cousin's party begin?\"  \"Five o'clock!\" Jolly Robin replied. \"And it will last till sundown.\"  The next morning Rusty Wren helped his wife so spryly that long before midday the house-cleaning was finished. Although she tried her best, Mrs. Rusty could think of no more tasks for her husband to do--except to feed the children. That was a duty that would not be finished until they were old enough to leave home and shift for themselves.  On this day Rusty Wren dropped so many dainties into their gaping mouths that his wife had to tell him that she didn't dare let the youngsters have anything more to eat until the next day.  \"And now you ought to stay in the house and have a good rest until just before sunset,\" she told Rusty. \"You've worked very hard ever since dawn. And I know you're tired.\"  But Rusty declared that he much preferred to be out of doors enjoying the fine weather.  His wife looked at him sharply when he said that. All day long neither of them had mentioned the party which Rusty's cousin, Long Bill Wren, was going to give at five o'clock that afternoon.  \"I think,\" said Rusty, as he moved about uncomfortably under his wife's gaze, \"I think that since I've a little time to spare I'd better go and see Mr. Frog, the tailor. You know you've been telling me that my Sunday coat is beginning to look shiny--and I suppose I really ought to have a new one.\"  Mrs. Rusty said that it was true--he did need a new coat. And she assured her husband that she would be delighted to have him go to the tailor's.  Now, she did not know that Mr. Frog had moved. She thought his shop was on the banks of Broad Brook. But that was just another mistake of hers. And if she had known where his tailoring parlors were then located, she would certainly have raised a good many objections to Rusty's visiting them on the day of his cousin's party. For Mr. Frog's shop was on the banks of Black Creek, where Long Bill Wren spent his summers.     XXII  THE FORGOTTEN GUEST   The shadows were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25824"],["title","The Tale of Rusty Wren (#7)"],["body","gthening--for the sun was far over in the west--when Rusty Wren reached Mr. Frog's tailor's shop overlooking Black Creek. Rusty pushed open the door and stepped inside, expecting to find Mr. Frog sitting cross-legged upon his table and sewing busily, according to the tailor's custom, until sunset, which marked the close of Mr. Frog's working day.  But Rusty had hardly entered the shop when he bumped into Mr. Frog with a crash; for Mr. Frog had been hurrying toward the door.  The collision bowled them both over upon the floor. But Mr. Frog did not appear annoyed in the least.  \"How-dy do!\" he said, almost before he had picked himself up. \"If you have come to see me on business, I'm sorry to say that I can't do anything for you to-day.... The fact is, I'm going to a singing-party this evening. And I don't want to be late.\"  \"Why--I'm going to a party, too!\" Rusty Wren exclaimed.  \"You must be mistaken--for there's to be no party here,\" Mr. Frog told him.  \"Oh! The party I'm going to will be held somewhere else,\" Rusty Wren explained.  \"That's interesting,\" said Mr. Frog, as he settled his hat more firmly upon his queerly shaped head. \"Who's having it--if I may ask?\"  Rusty Wren looked at the tailor as if he were much surprised.  \"Don't you know about it?\" he inquired. \"Do you mean to say that my cousin, Long Bill Wren, didn't invite you?\"  For a moment Mr. Frog appeared somewhat taken aback.  \"He must have forgotten me,\" he murmured. \"I haven't heard a word about his party before.... But I know it's a mistake,\" he added, with a smile.  \"No doubt!\" said Rusty Wren politely. \"I was going to Cousin Bill's home as soon as you had measured me for a new Sunday coat,\" he explained.  \"Then come right along now!\" Mr. Frog cried heartily. \"We'll go together. For I'm sure that Long Bill didn't mean to forget me. You know we're the best of friends. I make all his clothes for him; and he has never yet paid me a penny.\"  Rusty Wren hesitated. He was not quite sure that his cousin had intended to invite the nimble tailor to his party.  \"But your singing-party!\" he reminded Mr. Frog. \"You don't want to miss that!\" he said.  Mr. Frog caught him by a wing and laughed gaily.  \"Oh! That doesn't matter,\" he remarked with a careless air. \"We have a singing-party almost every night. I'd much rather go to your cousin's.\"  It is not strange that Rusty Wren should feel a little uncomfortable at the prospect of arriving at a party with a person who had received no invitation to it. But he could think of no way of ridding himself of Mr. Frog's company. So the two started off together towards the home of Long Bill Wren.  Rusty decided, however, that he would take his cousin to one side and explain to him in private how the tailor had happened to come with him.  But he soon found that no such explanation was necessary. For a certain reason, Long Bill Wren was in no wise annoyed. On the contrary, he seemed quite pleased.     XXIII  A STRANGE MISTAKE   Not wishing to be late at his cousin's party, which he understood was to begin at five o'clock, Rusty Wren hurried along the bank of Black Creek, while Mr. Frog did his best to keep pace with him.  Somewhat out of breath, the two arrived shortly at the home of Long Bill Wren. And, to their surprise, they saw not the least sign of any other guests.  \"It looks as if we were the first to get here,\" Rusty Wren remarked, as they drew near Long Bill's house in the reeds.  \"Well, somebody has to be first, you know,\" the tailor observed easily. \"I always like to be early at a party,\" he added, \"because then I am sure of getting plenty of refreshments.\"  If there were no other guests to be seen, neither was there any indication of a party about Long Bill's home. There was nothing to eat anywhere in sight; and no flag, nor gay Chinese lantern, nor decoration of any other kind adorned his house.  Rusty Wren had always thought his cousin's house a strange dwelling. Made of coarse grasses and reed stalks, it was round, like a big ball, with a doorway in one side. This queer building was fastened among the reeds a little distance above the ground. And it seemed to Rusty Wren that it must be a damp and unhealthful place to live.  \"It's odd that your cousin's not here to greet us,\" Mr. Frog croaked.  The words were scarcely out of his large mouth when Long Bill thrust his head and shoulders out of his door--for he had heard the voices in his front yard. He had on a shocking old coat--not at all the sort one would choose to wear when one expected guests.  \"Well, well!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm glad to see you, Cousin Rusty. And I'm certainly surprised, for it's more than a year since you've paid me a visit.\"  \"Aren't you glad to see me, too?\" Mr. Frog piped up a bit anxiously.  \"Certainly--to be sure!\" said Long Bill. \"But I'm not so surprised--though I understand that you usually attend a singing-party about this time o' day.\"  \"Yes!\" said Mr. Frog. \"But I'd much prefer to come to yours.\"  \"My what?\" inquired Long Bill Wren, as a puzzled look appeared upon his face.  \"Your party, of course!\" Mr. Frog replied with a wide smile.  Now, Rusty Wren wished he had not called at Mr. Frog's shop at all. If he had only come straight to his cousin's house, he thought that he would have spared himself--and his cousin, too--a good deal of trouble. And, since he didn't know what to say, he kept still for a few moments and let the others do all the talking.  Meanwhile, Long Bill hopped briskly outside his house, and joined them on the ground.  \"My party!\" he cried. \"Why, I know of no party here! Somebody has made a mistake. I haven't given a party for a year--just a year ago to-day.... I invited you at that time,\" he told Rusty Wren, \"but you didn't come. And I never received any word from you about the matter.\"  \"That's strange!\" said Rusty. \"This is the first I ever heard of the affair.\"  \"I engaged Mr. Crow to take your invitation to Jolly Robin in the orchard and ask him to give it to you,\" Long Bill informed his bewildered cousin.  \"That's just the way this invitation reached me yesterday!\" Rusty explained.  \"Ah! I see it all now,\" said Long Bill. And he began to laugh merrily. \"Mr. Crow's poor memory is to blame for your mistake. He forgot to deliver the message last year. And he happened to remember it only yesterday. So the news reached you just twelve months too late.\"  Although Long Bill Wren continued to laugh heartily, neither Mr. Frog nor Rusty could manage even a faint smile. Having expected a merry time and plenty to eat, they were both disappointed.  But Mr. Frog soon said that so far as he was concerned, he still had a singing-party that he could attend, so he didn't feel sad very long. And, after all, Rusty was glad to see his cousin, Long Bill Wren. They had a pleasant chat together for almost an hour. And Long Bill invited Rusty to stay to dinner.  Rusty thanked him and said, no! he must hasten home, because he had to go to bed early, on account of having to awaken Farmer Green at dawn the next morning.  When he returned to the old cherry tree Rusty had to answer a good many questions. His wife wanted to know what had kept him so long, and what Mr. Frog said, and what color his new Sunday coat was going to be.  When she learned that her husband's visit to the tailor had been all in vain, she looked very suspicious and said quickly:  \"You haven't been at a party, have you?\"  \"No, indeed!\" Rusty Wren replied. \"I haven't gone to a party for more than a year.\"  And he seemed quite indignant that his wife should have such a strange idea in her head.
