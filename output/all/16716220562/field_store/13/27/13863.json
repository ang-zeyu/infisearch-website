EDWARD  Yes, sir----                               NICOLAY  Hold that door tight this morning----                               EDWARD  Tight as a drum, sir----                               NICOLAY  If any men of importance try to crowd in before their time----                               EDWARD  I'll look out for them, sir--here's another bag of letters, Colonel Nicolay----                               NICOLAY  Another----?                               EDWARD  And there's two more outside----                               NICOLAY  My God----!                               EDWARD  Don't blame me, sir--I didn't write 'em----                               NICOLAY  No, I'll vouch for your loyalty to the President.                               EDWARD  Where'll I put these----?                               NICOLAY  Throw the bag in the corner--there's no room on his desk now----                               EDWARD      [_Obeying._]  Yes, sir----      [EDWARD _throws the bag in the corner of the room where_ NICOLAY     _has already piled the letters from the desk, and turns to_     NICOLAY. _He watches_ NICOLAY _destroying letters for a moment._]                               NICOLAY  Well, Edward----?                               EDWARD  Will you tell me one thing, Colonel Nicolay----?                               NICOLAY  If I can----                               EDWARD  What do they say in these letters to the President----? I've served through four administrations--I've never seen such piles of letters in the White House before----                               NICOLAY  Well, Edward--these letters ask two things of Abraham Lincoln: That he dismiss General Grant from command of the Army----                               EDWARD  The idiots----                               NICOLAY  And stop the war to-day--August 23, 1864,--make peace--peace at any price--to-day----                               EDWARD  God save us! After nearly four years--quit, with nothing settled----?                               NICOLAY  That's what these letters demand----                               EDWARD  You couldn't believe it---- No wonder his eyes sink back in his head, an' he looks as if he were seeing ghosts----      [_Pauses and starts._]                               NICOLAY  Watch out for that door, Edward----      [EDWARD _bows, and exits to door leading to the main corridor._     NICOLAY _returns to his task of reading the letters--one he tosses     into the basket wearily--one he crumples in anger and hurls into     the basket._]                               NICOLAY  The fools----!      [_He is absorbed in a letter when_ MRS. LINCOLN _enters in a state     of nervous excitement. He rises quickly, and goes to meet her._]  What is it, Mrs. Lincoln----?                               MRS. LINCOLN  I have just heard that the Republican National Committee is in Washington----!                               NICOLAY  They are----                               MRS. LINCOLN  In conference at Senator Winter's house----?                               NICOLAY  Yes----                               MRS. LINCOLN  What do they want?                               NICOLAY  There are ugly rumors----                               MRS. LINCOLN  What----? What----? What----?                               NICOLAY  I can't discuss it, Madam, until the Chief knows----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Mr. Lincoln doesn't know----                               NICOLAY  Not yet. He will, this morning. They've just sent a demand to me that he see them before his public reception begins----                               MRS. LINCOLN  You've heard something--you know something--tell me--I can't endure the suspense----                               NICOLAY  Only rumors--and they're too ugly to put into words--they're incredible----                               MRS. LINCOLN  All the same, you believe them----      [_Impetuously._]  What have you heard----?                               NICOLAY      [_Shakes his head._]  The Chief wouldn't like it if I talk, before he knows. I'll tell you a few things I'm _thinking_ in plain English--if you'd like to hear----                               MRS. LINCOLN  You can't make it too _plain_ to suit me----                               NICOLAY  In my opinion, the devil is to pay. Weak-kneed fools are deserting the Chief. Every man who loves Abraham Lincoln must get off his coat now and fight. He is the only man who can save this Nation to-day, and he's too big and generous to be trusted alone with wolves----                               MRS. LINCOLN  What can you mean----? The Republican National Committee have no power over the President of the United States----                               NICOLAY  No, Madam---- But they have certain powers over the Nominee of their party----                               MRS. LINCOLN  But Mr. Lincoln is already the nominee of his party for the second term ... chosen two months ago--and the election is but eight weeks off--what do you mean----?      [EDWARD _enters._]                               EDWARD  Miss Betty Winter to see you, Ma'am----                               MRS. LINCOLN  How fortunate--they're at her father's house----!                               NICOLAY  Yes----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Show her right in here, Edward----                               EDWARD  Yes, Madam----                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_To_ NICOLAY.]  And she's loyal to Mr. Lincoln--                               EDWARD      [_At door left._]  Right this way,--Miss Betty----      [BETTY _enters--a young woman 25 years old--poised, cultured,     charming._]                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Meeting Betty._]  Welcome--my child----                               BETTY  You're always so kind----!                               NICOLAY  Excuse me, ladies--while I go out and get rid of some of these people waiting to see the President----      [NICOLAY _exits._]                               MRS. LINCOLN  Tell me, dear, you've heard something--the Republican National Committee are at your father's----                               BETTY  They _were_ there--they've adjourned to Thaddeus Stevens' house across the street from us---- They were locked in with father for two hours----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Locked in----?                               BETTY      [_Nods._]  With the keyhole chinked up----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  And you didn't get a hint of what they're up to----?                               BETTY  Not the faintest----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Oh, Betty--they're discussing me----                               BETTY  They didn't mention your name----                               MRS. LINCOLN  How do you know----?                               BETTY  Well--I did hear a little----! I could hear from the next room when they got excited! It's Abraham Lincoln they're discussing--not his wife----                               MRS. LINCOLN  You're sure----?                               BETTY  Sure----! It sounded like a regular dog fight--with one big brute howling----      [_Imitates._]  --the President's name above the din----                               MRS. LINCOLN  But, you can't be sure, my dear----                               BETTY  What on earth could they be discussing you for----?                               MRS. LINCOLN  My loyalty, of course--you know that my brothers are in the Southern Army, fighting the Union. Fools have accused me of giving them important secrets of the Government. When I _hate_ them for all they have done to me and mine----!                               BETTY  But my dear Mrs. Lincoln--no one believes such lies about you now--not even in this bitter campaign--it's absurd----                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Hesitates._]  That is not the real thing I'm afraid of, child--it's something worse--I'm going to take you into my confidence now--may I?                               BETTY  I'll be tickled to death with the honor----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  And I'm going to ask you to help me----                               BETTY  I'll be in the Cabinet next----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  The truth is, I owe A. T. Stewart and Company an enormous bill for dresses--$60,000----                               BETTY  Sixty thousand--oh, my Lord! That's worse than mine----!                               MRS. LINCOLN  I had to get them! The world said the White House would be disgraced by my awkward husband's régime--I've shown them better! But I just couldn't tell Mr. Lincoln. He has no idea of the cost of clothes. If these jackals have found out and attack him on my account, the thought of it will kill me----                               BETTY  But you know he'd defend you against any one who dares attack you.                               MRS. LINCOLN  Yes, dear--but it would hurt him so to hear it from their brutal lips. I want you to find out from your father, if they know----                               BETTY  And if they know----?                               MRS. LINCOLN  Get here before they do, and I'll head them off--I'll tell Mr. Lincoln first----                               BETTY      [_Smiling._]  On one condition--that you help me----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Anything you ask----                               BETTY  I've promised my fiancé that I would get an appointment for him to see the President on something very important----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Mr. Lincoln will be here in a few minutes.

NICOLAY  Henry Raymond, their Chairman, is with them, and has just sent word demanding a hearing before your public reception this morning.                               LINCOLN  Make the appointment later. They're all distinguished men. They can wait while the humbler people have their turn. I came up here from the wilderness. I know what it means to have the great rush by me----      [_Laughs._]  No--I'll see the common folks first----                               NICOLAY  I think you'd better see this Committee right away, sir----                               LINCOLN  Why----?

We've enough of them flying around Washington to poison us all. They can only wish me to hedge on some of my principles in this crisis. I've made all the campaign statements I'm going to make. I've faith in the good sense of the people. I'm going to plant my feet squarely on that faith and wait the verdict of this election----                               NICOLAY  You won't see the Committee now----?

I want you to understand, sir, that as Secretary of War, I've the right to enter this room at any hour, day or night, announced or unannounced, and by God, I'm going to exercise that privilege!      [STANTON _paces the floor furiously._]                               LINCOLN      [_Laughing._]  Well, you're here now, and it's all right, Stanton--Easy! Easy, or we'll have to put some rocks in your pocket to hold you down. What can I do----?                               STANTON  Mr. President, I've come here this morning to make a square issue with you on the abuse of the pardoning power which you are making daily----                               LINCOLN  As Chief Magistrate of the people, I have been clothed with that power, Stanton----                               STANTON      [_Angrily._]  You have no right to exercise it under the present conditions! Discipline in our armies must be maintained. You are hamstringing me and every General in the field--by suspending the death penalty of our Courts-Martial. Men are deserting in thousands and we've got to put a stop to it.                               LINCOLN  That's what I say----! Bring to me the traitors who are causing them to desert, and see what I'll do to them!                               STANTON  You can't evade the issue I'm making, sir! You'll be asked this morning to pardon a deserter. I call a halt here and now--will you stop to-day the use of this pardoning power----?                               LINCOLN  I've got to hear both sides--it's my solemn duty----                               STANTON  All right, I'm done. There's my resignation as your Secretary of War--Good-by!      [STANTON _strides angrily to the door and_ LINCOLN _speaks as he     puts his hand on the knob._]                               LINCOLN  Wait a minute----                               STANTON  It's no use----                               LINCOLN  Come back here. I've something to say to you.      [STANTON _returns._]                               STANTON  You're wasting your breath----                               LINCOLN  Stanton, I appointed you Secretary of War against the advice of every man about me. You were a cantankerous Democrat and my enemy. You had said the meanest things about me that were ever spoken in Washington--and that's putting it pretty strong. You called me a low clown--the original gorilla. In spite of all this, I saw _your_ great qualities! I saw that you were absolutely fearless and absolutely honest, that your nerves were made of steel and your capacity for work was boundless. Even in your passions and hatreds, you showed a loyalty to the Union that rose above the parties and creeds of a lifetime. I like men of your strong personality. They stand between a nation and hell. And so, I appointed you, my bitter foe, to my cabinet. I've never regretted it for a minute in these years of blood and anguish. You've made the best Secretary of War this country ever had. In spite of your mean traits and your awful profanity, I've learned to love you! Now, you've resigned, and done your duty, as you see it. I've accepted your resignation, _conscripted_ you again, and reappointed you----!      [_Pauses and strokes his shoulder._]  Go back to your desk and stick to the rules--"]]]
