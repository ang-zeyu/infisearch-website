A. Lincoln]  WILLIAM H. TOWNSEND     A MAN OF THE PEOPLE   A DRAMA OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN    BY  THOMAS DIXON  AUTHOR OF \"THE BIRTH OF A NATION,\" \"THE CLANSMAN,\" \"THE LEOPARD'S SPOTS,\" ETC.    D. APPLETON AND COMPANY NEW YORK         LONDON MCMXX  COPYRIGHT, 1920, BY THOMAS DIXON  PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA    TO  WILLIAM HARRIS, JR.  WHOSE COURAGE AND HIGH IDEALS AS A PRODUCER GAVE TO THE AMERICAN STAGE THE EPOCH-MAKING PLAY  ABRAHAM LINCOLN     HISTORICAL NOTE   While the popular conception of Lincoln as the Liberator of the Slave is true historically, there is a deeper view of his life and character. He was the savior, if not the real creator, of the American Union of free Democratic States. His proclamation of emancipation was purely an incident of war. The first policy of his administration was to save the Union. To this fact we owe a united Nation to-day. It is this truth of history which I try to make a living reality in my play.  The scenes relating to the issues of our National life have been drawn from authentic records. The plot of the action is based on the letter of Colonel John Nicolay to Major Hay, dated August 25, 1864, in which the following opening paragraph is found:      \"Hell is to pay. The New York politicians have got a stampede on     that is about to swamp everything. Raymond and the National     Committee are here to-day. R. thinks a Commission to Richmond is     about the only salt to save us; while the President sees and says     it would be utter ruination. The matter is now undergoing     consultation. Weak-kneed damned fools are in the movement for a new     candidate to supplant the President. Everything is darkness, doubt,     and discouragement.\"  No liberty has been taken with an essential detail of history in the development of the action except to slightly shift the dates of two incidents for dramatic unity. In neither case does the change of date affect the validity of the scene as used.  THOMAS DIXON     DIVISION INTO ACTS   PROLOGUE: The Lincoln cabin in the woods of Indiana, 1820.

There is no shutter to the door and no window to the cabin._  _Right and Left of the door opening are rude benches of split logs. On the walls are stretched a coon and a small bear, squirrel and muskrat skins. In the foreground on the right is seen an old-fashioned wash pot set on three stones. Near the wash pot is fixed in the ground a pole, on the top of which are hung six gourds cut for martin swallows to nest in. Beside it are a rude bench and two wash tubs. On the left is a crude settee made of a split log with legs set in augur holes and a rough back made of saplings. An old-fashioned doctor's saddle-bags hang across the back of the settee. The trees are walnut, beech and oak--undergrowth of dogwood, sumac and wild grapevines. These vines, festooned over the cabin, give a sinister impression. A creek winds down through the hills behind the cabin._  AT RISE: SARAH _is seen softly tiptoeing toward the cabin door. She pauses, listens and slowly peeps inside. She listens again and then slips away and calls_.                                SARAH  Abe! Abe!      [SARAH _goes back to the door and peeps in and runs to the gate._]  Abe----! Ma's awake now!      [_She returns to the door, peeps in again and runs once more to the     gate._]  Abe----! He's feelin' her pulse! Come on in--don't stay out there in the woods....      [ABE _enters slowly._]                               ABE  What does he say?                               SARAH  He ain't said nothin' yet.                               ABE  He's a dumb doctor, anyhow. I couldn't get him to say a word comin', last night.                               SARAH  Well, he's here now, and there's his saddle-bags full of medicine. You've been ridin' all night--you look terrible tired! Go to bed and sleep a little----                               ABE  I can't--while Ma's so sick--I'm afraid to go to sleep----                               SARAH  Why----?                               ABE  You know why--Sarah----                               SARAH  Ah, she ain't goin' to die now. She's talkin' to the doctor--lie down just a little while and get to sleep before the sun comes up or ye can't sleep----      [_Pleading._]  --come on----                               ABE  No--I'm scared--the plague's killin' folks every day--and nobody knows what to do for 'em----      [_The_ DOCTOR _and_ TOM _enter from the cabin and come down     slowly--the_ DOCTOR _seems to be debating his course of action._]      [_Eagerly to_ DOCTOR.]  You can do somethin' for her, Doctor?

DOCTOR  What's that?                               TOM  You shan't bleed her--I don't know nothin' 'bout doctorin'--but I know that'll kill her----                               DOCTOR  I've a notion to give you the worst cussin' you ever had in your life, Tom Lincoln....                               TOM  'Twouldn't do no good--Doctor----                               DOCTOR      [_Throwing his arms up._]  'Twould do _me_ good!

There's no doctor in thirty miles---- You've been the doctor and nurse--mother and father to 'em all. And when they die, you go into the woods, cut down a tree, rip out the boards, make the coffin, dig the grave and lower the dead with a prayer--I'd like to cuss you, Tom Lincoln--but I can't--damn ye----!                               TOM  I'm sorry, Doctor--but I just couldn't let ye bleed her----                               DOCTOR  All right--good-by----      [_With a snort of anger, the_ DOCTOR _throws his lancet into his     saddle-bags, snaps them together, and starts for the gate._]                               ABE      [_Following the_ DOCTOR _to gate._]  Doctor----!

And Pa didn't mean to hurt yer feelin's--won't ye stay and help us? Can't ye do somethin' else for her----?      [_Pauses._]  I'll pay ye----! I'll work for ye a whole--year----                               DOCTOR  You'd work for me a year?                               ABE      [_Eagerly._]  I'll work for ye _five_ years if you'll just save her--just save her life--that's all--don't go--please, don't----                               DOCTOR      [_The_ DOCTOR _slips his arm around the boy, draws him close and     holds him a moment._]  You're a good boy, Abe----                               ABE  You'll stay----?                               DOCTOR  I'd stay and do something if I could, Sonny, but to tell ye the truth, I don't know what to do--I'm not quite sure I'm right about the bleedin', or I'd stay and make you both help me----      [_He pauses._]  But I'm not sure----! I'm not sure! And I don't know what else to do--I've got no medicine--so I can't stay. All I can tell ye is to keep her warm--and give her everything good to eat that she can take--she's in God's hands--Good-by----      [_The_ DOCTOR _hurries through the gate--and leaves_ ABE _and_ TOM     _gazing forlornly after him, as_ SARAH _comes from the house._]                               SARAH  I've got the towel and bowl all ready----      [_Pauses._]  What's the matter----?

But you remembered this cabin here in the deep woods and you were humble. I walked with you between two white pillars. It was still and solemn, in there. Outside I could hear the people calling your name. You bowed low and whispered in my ear: \"This is all yours, my Mother. I bought it for you with my life. All that I am I owe to you----\"      [_Her voice sinks to a whisper that is half a laugh of religious     ecstasy._]                               ABE      [_Joyfully._]  See how she's smilin'--Pa!

ACT I   SET SCENE: _The President's room in the White House, August 23, 1864. A flat desk left center. At right a long table and chairs. Doors open right and left. Large windows open center. Beside the center window stands an upright desk. In one corner a rack with map rollers and folios of maps on the floor and leaning against the wall._  AT RISE: _Colonel Nicolay, the President's Secretary, is seen writing before an enormous pile of mail. He reads a letter and throws it down in disgust. Reads another and hurls it into the waste basket. He rises--turns back to the desk and hurls an armful of the letters into the corner on the floor and removes enough letters to clear a space for his Chief to write._       [EDWARD _enters"]]]
