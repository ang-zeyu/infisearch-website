He was tall, lean, gaunt in figure, with a shambling walk, and his skin was tough and leathery; but in spite of all there was an honest, manly expression, which instantly inspired confidence. Both Harry and Jack liked him, but Dick Fletcher seemed to regard him with instinctive dislike.  \"What made you accept that scarecrow into our company?\" he asked, when Stackpole had left them to make his own arrangements for leaving the city.  Harry smiled.  \"He isn't a handsome man,\" he replied, \"but I think he will prove a valuable companion.\"  \"You took no notice of my objection to him,\" said Fletcher, frowning.  \"Our company was too small,\" returned Harry. \"From inquiry I find that parties seldom consist of less than half a dozen.\"  \"I know all about that,\" said Fletcher impatiently. \"You might have been guided by me.\"  \"I shall be to some extent,\" answered Harry, \"but not implicitly.\"  \"I am going to have trouble with that boy,\" thought Fletcher. \"Wait till we get on the road.\" Aloud he said: \"If you had mentioned the matter to me I would have found someone to go with us. You had better tell this Yankee that we haven't room for him, and I will do it now.\"  Fletcher's persistence only aroused vague suspicions in Harry's breast. He felt glad that Stackpole was neither a friend nor likely to prove a confederate of Dick Fletcher, and was resolved to hold on to him.  \"I have invited him, and I won't take back the invitation,\" he said.  \"How old are you?\" asked Fletcher abruptly.  \"Sixteen.\"  \"I should think you were sixty by the tone you assume,\" said Fletcher with a sneer.  \"Do I understand, Mr. Fletcher,\" asked Harry steadily, \"that you claim to control our party?\"  \"Seeing that I am more than twice as old as you are, I am the natural head of the expedition.\"  \"I cannot admit any such claim. If you are not satisfied to be simply a member of the party, like the rest of us, I shall not be offended if you back out even now.\"  This, however, did not suit Fletcher, and with a forced laugh he answered, \"You are a strange boy, Vane. I suppose it's the way with your countrymen. I don't want to back out, as you term it. I fancy we shall get along together.\"  \"I wish he had decided to leave us,\" said Harry when the two boys were alone. \"Somehow I distrust him.\"  \"I don't like him myself,\" said Jack, \"but I don't see what harm he can do us.\"  \"Nor I, but I feel safer with this Yankee addition to our party.\"  About ten o'clock the next morning the little party got off. It is needless to say that Obed Stackpole contributed his full share of expense, and more too, for he furnished the yoke of oxen that were to draw the cart which conveyed their provisions and other outfit.  \"I don't want to push in where I aint wanted,\" he said, \"but I'm used to oxen, and if you want me to, I'll drive these critters, and you three can foller along as you please.\"  \"That'll suit me,\" said Fletcher with unusual graciousness. \"I've no doubt you understand the business better than I do.\"  \"I ought to understand it,\" said Stackpole. \"I was raised on a farm in New Hampshire, and used to drive oxen when I wasn't tall enough to see over their backs. I never thought then that I'd be drivin' a team in Australy.\"  \"What led you to come out here, Mr. Stackpole?\" asked Harry.  \"Well, a kinder rovin' disposition, I guess. A year ago I was in Californy, but things didn't pan out very well, so when I read accounts of the gold fields out here, I jist dropped my pick and started, and here I am.\"  \"Didn't you find any gold-dust in California?\" asked Fletcher, with sudden interest.  \"Well, I found _some_,\" answered the Yankee, with drawling deliberation, \"but not enough to satisfy me. You see,\" he added, \"I've got two to make money for.\"  \"And who are those two?\" inquired Fletcher.  \"The first is my old dad--he's gettin' kinder broken down, and can't work as well as he could when he was a young man. He's got a thousand-dollar mortgage on his farm, and I want to pay that off. It'll kinder ease the old man's mind.\"  \"That a very excellent object, Mr. Stackpole,\" said Harry, who felt still more drawn to his plain, ungainly, but evidently good-hearted companion.  \"I think so myself,\" said Obed simply.  \"The other person is your wife, I fancy,\" said Fletcher.  \"I expect she will be my wife when I get forehanded enough,\" replied Obed. \"It's Suke Stanwood, one of Farmer Stanwood's gals. We was raised together, and we've been engaged for nigh on to five years.\"  \"Very romantic!\" said Fletcher, but there was a veiled sneer in his tone, as he scanned with contemptuous amusement the ungainly figure of his Yankee companion.  \"I don't know much about such things,\" said Obed, \"but I guess Suke and I will pull together well.\"  \"You are not exactly a young man,\" said Fletcher. \"You've waited some time.\"  \"I'm thirty-nine last birthday,\" said Obed. \"I was engaged ten years ago, but the girl didn't know her own mind, and she ran off with a man that came along with a photograph saloon. I guess it's just as well, for she was always rather flighty.\"  \"It is very strange she should have deserted a man of your attractions,\" said Fletcher with a smile.  Harry was indignant at this open ridicule of so honest and worthy a fellow as Stackpole, and he wondered whether the Yankee would be obtuse enough not to see it. His doubt was soon solved.  \"It looks to me as if you was pokin' fun at me, Fletcher,\" said Obed, with a quiet, steady look at the other. \"I'm a good-natured fellow in the main, but I don't stand any nonsense. I know very well I'm a rough looking chap, and I don't mind your sayin' so, but I aint willin' to be laughed at.\"  \"My dear fellow,\" said Fletcher smoothly, \"you quite mistake my meaning, I assure you. I am the last person to laugh at you. I think you are too modest, though. You are what may be called a 'rough diamond.'\"  \"I accept your apology, Fletcher,\" said Obed. \"If no offence was meant, none is taken. I don't know much about diamonds, rough or smooth, but at any rate I aint a paste one.\"  \"A good hit! Bravo!\" laughed Fletcher. \"You are a man of great penetration, Stackpole, and a decided acquisition to our party.\"  \"I'm glad you think so,\" said Obed dryly. \"If I remember right, you didn't want me to join you.\"  \"At first I did not, but I have changed my mind. I didn't know you then.\"  \"And I don't know you now,\" said Obed bluntly. \"If you don't mind, s'pose you tell us what brought you out here.\"  Fletcher frowned and regarded the Yankee suspiciously, as if seeking his motive in asking this question, but his suspicions were dissipated by a glance at that honest face, and he answered lightly, \"Really, there isn't much to tell. My father was a merchant of Manchester, and tried to make me follow in his steps, but I was inclined to be wild, incurred some debts, and finally threw up business and came out here.\"  \"Have you prospered as far as you've gone?\"  \"Yes and no. I've made money and I've spent it, and the accounts are about even.\"  \"That means you haven't much left.\"  \"Right you are, my friend, but in your steady company I mean to turn over a new leaf, and go in for money and respectability. Now I've made a clean breast of it, and you know all about me.\"  In spite of this statement there was not one of his three companions who did not feel sure that there was much in Fletcher's history which he had kept concealed, and possibly for very good reasons.     CHAPTER VI.  A NIGHT INCIDENT.  The path of a gold-seeker in Australia was beset with difficulties. The country about Melbourne, and far inland, was boggy, the soil being volcanic, and abounding in mud which appears to have no bottom. The road to the mines was all the worse for having been ploughed up by bullock teams, and worked into a slough which proved the discouragement of mining parties. Some were even months in traversing the comparatively small distance across the country to the goal they sought. But the attraction of money, which is said to make the mare go, enabled them to triumph at last over the obstacles that intervened. It was not long before our party began to understand the nature of the task they had undertaken. The cart sank up to the hubs in a bog, and the oxen stood still in patient despair.  \"Well, if this don't beat all creation!\" ejaculated Obed. \"I've been in the Western States, and I thought I knew something about mud, but Australy's ahead. I say, Fletcher, is there much of this that we've got to go through?\"  \"Mud's the rule, and dry land the exception,\" answered Fletcher coolly.  \"Well, that's comfortin'!\" remarked Stackpole, drawing a deep breath. \"I s'pose people do get through after a while.\"  \"Yes, generally. I was six weeks getting to the Ovens once.\"  \"I wish we had some ovens to bake this mud,\" said Obed, with a grim smile at his joke. \"It would take a powerful large one.\"  There was nothing for it but dogged perseverance. It took an hour to get the oxen and cart through a bog a hundred feet across, and the appearance of the party, when they finally reached the other side, was more picturesque than attractive.  \"How would Clinton get along here?\" suggested Harry. \"I can imagine the poor fellow's despair.\"  \"His trousers would suffer some,\" said Jack. \"I think it would break his heart. The sea is much nicer. If we could only go by water,\" and the young sailor looked down at his mud-bedraggled clothes, and his shoes caked thickly over with the tenacious mud.  \"Yes, the sea would be cleaner at any rate. I agree with you there, Jack.\"  Arrived on the other side of the bog, they were obliged to give the tired cattle a rest. Indeed, they needed rest themselves.  At the end of the day they made an encampment. As well as they could judge, they were about eight miles from Melbourne.  \"Eight miles; and how far is the whole distance?\" asked Harry.  \"About a hundred miles,\" answered Fletcher.  \"At this rate, we can go through in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26111"],["title","In A New World; or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia (#4)"],["body"," or thirteen days, then.\"  \"You mustn't expect this rate of speed,\" said Fletcher. \"We shan't average over five miles.\"  \"Well, I hope we'll get paid for it,\" said Obed. \"If we don't I'd better have stayed in Californy. We haven't any such mines as this in that country.\"  \"You'd better have stayed there,\" said Fletcher dryly, and he evidently wished that his companion had done so.  \"'Variety's the spice of life,' as my old schoolmaster used to say,\" responded Obed. \"I kinder want to see what Australy is like. All the same I don't want to stump through to the other side of the globe.\"  The travellers encamped for the night in a dry spot among a group of gum-trees, and it may readily be believed that all slept well. The boys felt dead tired, and it was with difficulty they were awakened in the morning.  About five o'clock Fletcher opened his eyes. He was one who slept fast, so to speak, and obtained as much refreshment from an hour's sleep as most people do from a period twice as long. He had been lying on the ground wrapped in a blanket, as was the case with the other members of the party.  Raising himself, and leaning on his elbow, he saw that they were all fast asleep. He nodded with satisfaction, and getting on his feet he approached Obed Stackpole with noiseless tread. The Yankee was sleeping with his mouth wide open, occasionally emitting a sonorous snore through his aquiline nose. He was not beautiful to look upon, as Fletcher evidently thought.  \"Ill-favored brute!\" he ejaculated. \"I'd like to choke him!\"  If any special advantage had been likely to accrue to him, Fletcher's conscience would not have been likely to stand in the way of violence; but his purpose now was different.  \"The fellow must have gold about him,\" muttered Fletcher. \"I wonder whether I can get at it without waking him up.\"  Obed seemed to be in a profound slumber, but it was a peculiarity of our Yankee friend to wake at the least touch. This, of course, was not known to Dick Fletcher, who felt that there would be no risk in a careful exploration of Obed's pockets.  He thrust his hand into one of the Yankee's pockets with the practiced skill of a pickpocket, when an entirely unexpected result followed.  \"Why, you skunk, what in creation are you about?\" exclaimed Obed, suddenly seizing Fletcher by the throat.  \"Let me go!\" said Fletcher, struggling violently, but ineffectually, to free himself.  \"Not till you've told me what you are after.\"  \"Let go, and I'll tell you.\"  Obed loosened his grip, saying sternly, \"Are you a pickpocket, my enterprising friend, or what is the meaning of all this business?\"  \"You had better not insult me!\" said Fletcher angrily. \"I'm no more a pickpocket than you are.\"  \"Then what is the meaning of your little game? Maybe you got up in your sleep.\"  \"No, I didn't. I just waked up, and thought I'd like to have a smoke, but had no matches. I thought you might have some in your pocket.\"  \"Why didn't you wake me up and ask me?\"  \"You looked so comfortable, and I thought you needed rest after a hard day's work, so I decided to help myself.\"  \"It looks like it,\" responded Obed dryly. \"So that's all you were after, was it?\"  \"Of course,\" said Fletcher, regaining confidence. \"What else could it be?\"  \"Well, it strikes me it's rather takin' a liberty with a gentleman to search his pockets while he's asleep, that's all! In Californy, Fletcher, if you had been caught doin' it, ten chances to one you'd have been lynched, and lynchin' isn't usually regarded as comfortable or desirable. Where's your cigar?\"  \"I haven't any, but I've got a pipe.\"  \"Well, I do happen to have a few matches in my other pocket, but I'd rather you'd ask for 'em next time.\"  \"I will. The fact is, I ought to have brought some with me. It's very strange, old traveller as I am.\"  \"It would have been a little better than borrowin' them of a sleepin' man without leave. Don't do it again, Fletcher.\"  \"I'm not very likely to borrow them of you again, except when you're awake,\" said Fetcher with a short laugh. \"Do you always wake up so easy?\" he asked, in some curiosity.  \"Always. I sleep mighty sound, but the least touch wakes me up.\"  \"I shall remember that,\" thought Fletcher. \"This Yankee is rather a dangerous man to tackle. I won't attempt it again unless I have the decided advantage.\"  \"I hope you'll excuse me, Mr. Stackpole,\" he said aloud in a smooth tone. \"I used to travel with a friend--a great chum of mine--and we never stood on ceremony with each other. I ought to have remembered that you and I are comparatively new acquaintances.\"  \"Perhaps it will be best,\" said Obed dryly. \"You see when I wake up I don't always have my wits about me, and I might cut up rough before I had time to think.\"  \"Oh, no apologies, I beg,\" said Fletcher, waving his hand.  \"Who's apologizin'?\" demanded Obed, in surprise.  \"Never mind, it's all right! I thought you were apologizing for seizing me by the throat. As you say, you waked up suddenly, and didn't have your wits about you.\"  \"Well, I know!\" ejaculated Obed half to himself. \"I didn't think of that way of puttin' it. You're a cute fellow, Fletcher.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Stackpole. Now I will have my smoke;\" and Fletcher, though he did not care for it, by way of removing any lingering suspicion, lit his pipe and puffed away with apparent pleasure.     CHAPTER VII.  PARTING COMPANY.  \"I mistrust that man Fletcher,\" said Obed to Harry Vane the next day, taking the opportunity when, at one of their rests, the man referred to had sauntered into the woods.  \"I don't like him myself,\" said Harry. \"Have you any particular reason for mistrusting him?\"  \"He was searchin' my pockets last night when he thought I was asleep,\" answered Obed, and he related the incident of the night before.  \"It looks suspicious,\" said Harry. \"I have not much money, but I don't care to lose what I have.\"  \"I should like to shake him, but I don't see how we can very well. He's a reg'lar member of the party.\"  \"We can be on our guard at any rate,\" said Harry. \"I'll tell Jack, and advise him to be careful also.\"  At this point Dick Fletcher returned. He looked suspiciously from one to the other, under the impression that something had been said about him. He asked no questions, however, and no information was volunteered. He could not but observe, however, that there was more or less restraint in the manner of his companions toward him, and that they were not disposed to be social.  That day they made nine miles, the road being slightly better than the day before. About five o'clock they reached a rude wayside inn, over the door of which was a swinging sign, on which was printed:  TRAVELLERS' REST.  \"We might as well stop here, instead of camping out,\" said Fletcher.  \"I'm agreeable,\" said Obed, \"if the tax isn't too high.\"  \"Oh, Linton is moderate in his charges,\" said Fletcher. \"I've known him a good while. He's a good fellow.\"  This was not a very valuable recommendation in the opinion of Obed and the two boys, but they had no objection to becoming guests of the establishment.  It was a rude building, and the accommodations were very limited. In fact, there were but two sleeping rooms. One of these Fletcher occupied, and the other was given up to the other members of the party, there being two beds.  \"I'd rather bunk in with you, if you don't mind,\" said Stackpole to Harry. \"I don't feel easy in the same room with Fletcher.\"  \"We shall be very glad of your company, Mr. Stackpole.\"  \"If I snore, just come and turn me over. I don't want to disturb nobody.\"  \"I think Jack and I will be too sound asleep to be disturbed by your snoring,\" said Harry with a laugh. \"However, if there is any occasion, I will follow your directions.\"  The landlord was a broad-shouldered man of moderate stature, who had lost the sight of one eye. The other, being covered with a green shade, gave him an ill look. His manner, however, was hearty, and showed a bluff, off-hand cordiality, as he welcomed the party to the hospitalities of the Travellers' Rest. He was familiarly called \"Larry,\" by Fletcher, who greeted him like an old comrade.  The supper consisted in part of their own supplies, with some small additions from the larder of the inn. It was, at any rate, an improvement upon their camp fare, and the boys enjoyed it.  After supper they sat down on a settle in front of the inn, but presently Fletcher strayed away into the woods at the back of the house. Some fifteen minutes later Larry Linton also got up, but ostentatiously went in a different direction.  \"I'm going a little ways to a squatter's to speak about some vegetables,\" he said.  \"If you don't mind company, I'll go along too,\" said Obed.  \"Better not,\" answered Larry. \"There's a boggy spot which a stranger is likely to fall into.\"  \"I've had enough of bogs,\" said Obed, shrugging his shoulders. \"Seems to me you haven't got much besides bogs out in Australy.\"  So Linton went off by himself. After he was fairly out of the way, Obed said, turning to the two boys. \"Did you think I wanted to go off with Linton?\"  \"I supposed so, as you made the proposal.\"  \"I only wanted to find out if he wanted me or not. I have my suspicions.\"  \"What kind of suspicions?\"  Harry was the speaker, as usual, for Jack never took the lead when Harry was present.  \"Fletcher and Linton are too thick together to suit me,\" answered the Yankee. \"Looks as if they was in league together.\"  \"Do you think they have arranged a meeting?\"  \"That's just what I do think.\"  \"But they have gone in different directions,\" objected Jack.  \"Bless your simple heart, my boy, that's done on purpose,\" said Obed. \"Can't they fetch round together without our knowing it?\"  \"I didn't think of that,\" Jack admitted.  \"Mr. Stackpole,\" said Harry after a moment's thought, \"if you and Jack will keep each other company, I will explore a little myself. I may happen to be at the conference.\"  \"Be careful if you do, Harry,\" said Obed. \"Don't run no risk.\"  \"I'll look out "]]]
