O you that are so strong and cold,     O blower, are you young or old?     Are you a beast of field and tree,     Or just a stronger child than me?       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!  [Illustration]     XXVI  KEEPSAKE MILL       Over the borders, a sin without pardon,       Breaking the branches and crawling below,     Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,       Down by the banks of the river, we go.      Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,       Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,     Here is the sluice with the race running under--       Marvellous places, though handy to home!      Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,       Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;     Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,       Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.      Years may go by, and the wheel in the river       Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,     Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever       Long after all of the boys are away.      Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,       Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;     Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,       Turning and churning that river to foam.      You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled,       I with your marble of Saturday last,     Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled,       Here we shall meet and remember the past.  [Illustration]     XXVII  GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN       Children, you are very little,     And your bones are very brittle;     If you would grow great and stately,     You must try to walk sedately.      You must still be bright and quiet,     And content with simple diet;     And remain, through all bewild'ring,     Innocent and honest children.  [Illustration: \"Happy play in grassy places.\"]      Happy hearts and happy faces,     Happy play in grassy places--     That was how, in ancient ages,     Children grew to kings and sages.      But the unkind and the unruly,     And the sort who eat unduly,     They must never hope for glory--     Theirs is quite a different story!      Cruel children, crying babies,     All grow up as geese and gabies,     Hated, as their age increases,     By their nephews and their nieces.  [Illustration]     XXVIII  FOREIGN CHILDREN       Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,     Little frosty Eskimo,     Little Turk or Japanee,     O! don't you wish that you were me?      You have seen the scarlet trees     And the lions over seas;     You have eaten ostrich eggs,     And turned the turtles off their legs.      Such a life is very fine,     But it's not so nice as mine:     You must often, as you trod,     Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.      You have curious things to eat,     I am fed on proper meat;     You must dwell beyond the foam,     But I am safe and live at home.        Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,       Little frosty Eskimo,       Little Turk or Japanee,     O! don't you wish that you were me?     XXIX  THE SUN'S TRAVELS       The sun is not a-bed, when I     At night upon my pillow lie;     Still round the earth his way he takes,     And morning after morning makes.      While here at home, in shining day,     We round the sunny garden play,     Each little Indian sleepy-head     Is being kissed and put to bed.      And when at eve I rise from tea,     Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea,     And all the children in the West     Are getting up and being dressed.  [Illustration]     XXX  THE LAMPLIGHTER       My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;     It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;     For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,     With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.      Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,     And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;     But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,     O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!      For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,     And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;     And O! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,     O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!      [Illustration:     \"... Many frightening sights abroad     Till morning in the land of Nod.\"]  [Illustration]     XXXI  MY BED IS A BOAT       My bed is like a little boat;       Nurse helps me in when I embark;     She girds me in my sailor's coat       And starts me in the dark.      At night, I go on board and say       Good night to all my friends on shore;     I shut my eyes and sail away       And see and hear no more.      And sometimes things to bed I take,       As prudent sailors have to do;     Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,       Perhaps a toy or two.      All night across the dark we steer:       But when the day returns at last     Safe in my room, beside the pier,       I find my vessel fast.     XXXII  THE MOON       The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;     She shines on thieves on the garden wall,     On streets and fields and harbour quays,     And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.      The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,     The howling dog by the door of the house,     The bat that lies in bed at noon,     All love to be out by the light of the moon.      But all of the things that belong to the day     Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;     And flowers and children close their eyes     Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.     XXXIII  THE SWING       How do you like to go up in a swing,       Up in the air so blue?     Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing       Ever a child can do!      Up in the air and over the wall,       Till I can see so wide,     Rivers and trees and cattle and all       Over the countryside--      Till I look down on the garden green,       Down on the roof so brown--     Up in the air I go flying again,       Up in the air and down!      [Illustration:     \"Cocked his shining eye and said:     'Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?'\"]  [Illustration]     XXXIV  TIME TO RISE       A birdie with a yellow bill     Hopped upon the window sill,     Cocked his shining eye and said:     'Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?'  [Illustration]     XXXV  LOOKING-GLASS RIVER       Smooth it slides upon its travel,       Here a wimple, there a gleam--         O the clean gravel!         O the smooth stream!      Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,       Paven pools as clear as air--         How a child wishes         To live down there!      We can see our coloured faces       Floating on the shaken pool         Down in cool places,         Dim and very cool;      Till a wind or water wrinkle,       Dipping marten, plumping trout,         Spreads in a twinkle         And blots all out.      See the rings pursue each other;       All below grows black as night,         Just as if mother         Had blown out the light!      Patience, children, just a minute--       See the spreading circles die;         The stream and all in it         Will clear by-and-by.  [Illustration]     XXXVI  FAIRY BREAD       Come up here, O dusty feet!       Here is fairy bread to eat.     Here in my retiring room,       Children, you may dine     On the golden smell of broom       And the shade of pine;     And when you have eaten well,     Fairy stories hear and tell.  [Illustration]     XXXVII  FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE       Faster than fairies, faster than witches,     Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;     And charging along like troops in a battle,     All through the meadows the horses and cattle:     All of the sights of the hill and the plain     Fly as thick as driving rain;     And ever again, in the wink of an eye,     Painted stations whistle by.      Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,     All by himself and gathering brambles;     Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;     And there is the green for stringing the daisies!      Here is a cart run away in the road     Lumping along with man and load;     And here is a mill and there is a river:     Each a glimpse and gone for ever!  [Illustration]     XXXVIII  WINTER-TIME       Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,     A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;     Blinks but an hour or two; and then,     A blood-red orange, sets again.      Before the stars have left the skies,     At morning in the dark I rise;     And shivering in my nakedness,     By the cold candle, bathe and dress.      Close by the jolly fire I sit     To warm my frozen bones a bit;     Or with a reindeer sled, explore     The colder countries round the door.      When to go out, my nurse doth wrap     Me in my comforter and cap:     The cold wind burns my face, and blows     Its frosty pepper up my nose.      Black are my steps on silver sod;     Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;     And tree and house, and hill and lake,     Are frosted like a wedding-cake.  [Illustration]     XXXIX  THE HAYLOFT       Through all the pleasant meadow-side       The grass grew shoulder-high,     Till the shining scythes went far and wide       And cut it down to dry.      These green and sweetly smelling crops       They led in waggons home;     And they piled them here in mountain tops       For mountaineers to roam.      Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,       Mount Eagle and Mount High;     The mice that in these mountains dwell,       No happier are than I!      O what a joy to clamber there,       O what a place for play,     With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,       The happy hills of hay.  [Illustration]     XL  FAREWELL TO THE FARM       The coach is at the door at last;     The eager children, mounting fast     And kissing hands, in chorus sing:     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      To house and garden, field and lawn,     The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25611"],["title","A Child's Garden of Verses (#3)"],["body","adow-gates we swang upon,     To pump and stable, tree and swing,     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      And fare you well for evermore,     O ladder at the hayloft door,     O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      Crack goes the whip, and off we go;     The trees and houses smaller grow;     Last, round the woody turn we swing:     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!  [Illustration]     XLI  NORTH-WEST PASSAGE   I. GOOD NIGHT.       When the bright lamp is carried in,     The sunless hours again begin;     O'er all without, in field and lane,     The haunted night returns again.      Now we behold the embers flee     About the firelit hearth; and see     Our faces painted as we pass,     Like pictures, on the window-glass.      Must we to bed indeed? Well then,     Let us arise and go like men,     And face with an undaunted tread     The long black passage up to bed.      Farewell, O brother, sister, sire!     O pleasant party round the fire!     The songs you sing, the tales you tell,     Till far to-morrow, fare ye well!  [Illustration]   2. SHADOW MARCH.      All round the house is the jet-black night;       It stares through the window-pane;     It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light,       And it moves with the moving flame.      Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum,       With the breath of the Bogie in my hair;     And all round the candle the crooked shadows come       And go marching along up the stair.      The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,       The shadow of the child that goes to bed--     All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp,       With the black night overhead.      [Illustration:     \"... Come from out the cold and gloom     Into my warm and cheerful room.\"]  [Illustration]   3. IN PORT.      Last, to the chamber where I lie     My fearful footsteps patter nigh,     And come from out the cold and gloom     Into my warm and cheerful room.      There, safe arrived, we turn about     To keep the coming shadows out,     And close the happy door at last     On all the perils that we past.      Then, when mamma goes by to bed,     She shall come in with tip-toe tread,     And see me lying warm and fast     And in the Land of Nod at last.     THE CHILD ALONE     THE CHILD ALONE  I  THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE       When children are playing alone on the green,     In comes the playmate that never was seen.     When children are happy and lonely and good,     The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.      Nobody heard him and nobody saw,     His is a picture you never could draw,     But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home,     When children are happy and playing alone.      He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass,     He sings when you tinkle the musical glass;     Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,     The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!      He loves to be little, he hates to be big,     'T is he that inhabits the caves that you dig;     'T is he when you play with your soldiers of tin     That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.      'T is he, when at night you go off to your bed,     Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;     For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,     'T is he will take care of your playthings himself!  [Illustration]     II  MY SHIP AND I       O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,       Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;     And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;     But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out       How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.      For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,       And the dolly I intend to come alive;     And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go,     It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow       And the vessel goes a divie-divie dive.      O it's then you'll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,       And you'll hear the water singing at the prow;     For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore,     To land upon the island where no dolly was before,       And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.  [Illustration]     III  MY KINGDOM       Down by a shining water well     I found a very little dell,         No higher than my head.     The heather and the gorse about     In summer bloom were coming out,         Some yellow and some red.      I called the little pool a sea;     The little hills were big to me;         For I am very small.     I made a boat, I made a town,     I searched the caverns up and down,         And named them one and all.      And all about was mine, I said,     The little sparrows overhead,         The little minnows too.     This was the world and I was king;     For me the bees came by to sing,         For me the swallows flew.      I played there were no deeper seas,     Nor any wider plains than these,         Nor other kings than me.     At last I heard my mother call     Out from the house at evenfall,         To call me home to tea.      And I must rise and leave my dell,     And leave my dimpled water well,         And leave my heather blooms.     Alas! and as my home I neared,     How very big my nurse appeared,         How great and cool the rooms!  [Illustration: \"This was the world and I was king.\"]  [Illustration]     IV  PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER       Summer fading, winter comes--     Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs,     Window robins, winter rooks,     And the picture story-books.      Water now is turned to stone     Nurse and I can walk upon;     Still we find the flowing brooks     In the picture story-books.      All the pretty things put by,     Wait upon the children's eye,     Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,     In the picture story-books.      We may see how all things are,     Seas and cities, near and far,     And the flying fairies' looks,     In the picture story-books.      How am I to sing your praise,     Happy chimney-corner days,     Sitting safe in nursery nooks,     Reading picture story-books?  [Illustration]     V  MY TREASURES       These nuts, that I keep in the back of the nest     Where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest,     Were gathered in autumn by nursie and me     In a wood with a well by the side of the sea.      This whistle we made (and how clearly it sounds!)     By the side of a field at the end of the grounds.     Of a branch of a plane, with a knife of my own,     It was nursie who made it, and nursie alone!      The stone, with the white and the yellow and grey,     We discovered I cannot tell _how_ far away;     And I carried it back although weary and cold,     For though father denies it, I'm sure it is gold.      But of all of my treasures the last is the king,     For there's very few children possess such a thing;     And that is a chisel, both handle and blade,     Which a man who was really a carpenter made.  [Illustration]     VI  BLOCK CITY       What are you able to build with your blocks?     Castles and palaces, temples and docks.     Rain may keep raining, and others go roam,     But I can be happy and building at home.      Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,     There I'll establish a city for me:     A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,     And a harbour as well where my vessels may ride.      Great is the palace with pillar and wall,     A sort of a tower on the top of it all,     And steps coming down in an orderly way     To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.      This one is sailing and that one is moored:     Hark to the song of the sailors on board!     And see on the steps of my palace, the kings     Coming and going with presents and things!      Now I have done with it, down let it go!     All in a moment the town is laid low.     Block upon block lying scattered and free,     What is there left of my town by the sea?      Yet as I saw it, I see it again,     The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men     And as long as I live and where'er I may be,     I'll always remember my town by the sea.  [Illustration]     VII  THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS       At evening when the lamp is lit,     Around the fire my parents sit;     They sit at home and talk and sing,     And do not play at anything.      Now, with my little gun, I crawl     All in the dark along the wall,     And follow round the forest track     Away behind the sofa back.      There, in the night, where none can spy,     All in my hunter's camp I lie,     And play at books that I have read     Till it is time to go to bed.      These are the hills, these are the woods,     These are my starry solitudes;     And there the river by whose brink     The roaring lions come to drink.      I see the others far away     As if in firelit camp they lay,     And I, like to an Indian scout,     Around their party prowled about.      So, when my nurse comes in for me,     Home I return across the sea,     And go to bed with backward looks     At my dear land of Story-books.  [Illustration]     VIII  ARMIES IN THE FIRE       The lamps now glitter down the street;     Faintly sound the falling feet     And the blue even slowly falls     About the garden trees and walls.      Now in the falling of the gloom     The red fire paints the empty room:     And warmly on the roof it looks,     And flickers on the backs of books.      Armies march by tower and spire     Of cities blazing, in the fire;     Till as I gaze with staring eyes,     The armies fade, the lustre dies.      Then once again the glow returns;     Again the phantom city burns;     And down the red-hot valley, lo!     The phantom armies marching go!      Blinking embers, tell me true     Where are those armies marching to,     And what the burning city is     That crumbles in your furnaces!  [Illustration]     IX  THE LITTLE LAND       When at home alone I sit     And am very tired of it,     I have just to shut my eyes    "]]]
