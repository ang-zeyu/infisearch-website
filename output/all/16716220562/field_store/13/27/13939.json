The papers in the case, received through the State and War     Departments, are herewith returned.      In this connection, I also notice a letter from the Hon. C. M. Clay,     our Minister to Russia, which has been referred to this office and     herewith returned, and on which I have to report. If the civilized     nations persist in refusing to discontinue and abandon the use of     sensitive explosive balls, then it would be well for this Government     to enter into the agreement suggested by Mr. Clay, whereby we may be     enabled to secure their use in case of necessity, by an agreement     with him, or his named authorized agent, for the payment of a     stipulated royalty on each that may be procured from him, or may be     used in the Government service.                 Respectfully, your obedient servant,                                                     A. B. DYER,                               _Brevet Major-General, Chief of Ordnance_.  I have recorded enough to show the recklessness and falsity of the charge against the Confederates of using such missiles in small arms during the late war, and the public is hereby specifically \"_informed whether the Nationals ever used them_.\"  In the Patent Office Report for 1863-4 will be found the following account of the Gardiner musket shell:      No. 40,468--Samuel Gardiner, jr., of New York, N. Y.--_Improvement     in Hollow Projectiles_--Patent dated November 3, 1863.      The shell to form the central chamber is attached to a mandrel, and     the metal forced into a mould around it.      Claim--Constructing shells for firearms by forcing the metal into a     mould around an internal shell supported on a mandrel.  I have a box of these shells in my possession. They are open for examination by any persons who may desire to see them.  This summer the distinguished officer who commanded the 143d regiment of Pennsylvania volunteers, United States army, at the battle of Gettysburg, informed me that during the last day of the battle, he and his men frequently heard, above their heads, amid the whistling of the minnie balls from the Confederate side, sharp, explosive sounds like the snapping of musket caps. He mentioned the matter to an ordnance officer at the time. The officer replied that what he heard was explosive rifle balls, which the Confederates had captured from the Union troops, who had lately received them from the Ordnance Department.  From the fact that the Gardiner shell is not fitted with a percussion cap at the point of the projectile, and is not easily exploded by hand, and from the additional fact that only about ten thousand are reported as having been used in action, I am willing to believe that the primary purpose of the Government of the United States in using them was the exploding of caissons. There is, moreover, no evidence that any of these shells were issued from the Ordnance Bureau after the year 1863. The Gardiner shells are so constructed as to have no different appearance in the cartridge from the common minnie ball--only the title on the box, and an examination of the ball when separate from the cartridge, giving any indication of its explosive character.  I know not _certainly_ if any other such projectiles were used by the United States troops, nor have I any especial desire to prosecute the investigation further than to prove the position taken in this paper.  It would be disingenuous in me if I failed to notice the fact that a charge somewhat similar to that which begins this article was made by a correspondent in the _Scientific American_ for September 6th, 1862, volume VII, page 151, as follows:      Recently it was my privilege to examine, in the hands of a man just     from Fortress Monroe, an explosive bullet, such as was used by the     Rebels in the six days' battle. It is conical in shape, about one     inch long, made of lead, and consists of two parts--viz: a solid     head piece and a cylindrical chamber, which are united together by a     screw. From the point of the bullet projects a little rod, which     passes down through a small hole in the head piece into the chamber     below, where it was connected with a percussion cap. The chamber     contains about a tablespoonful of powder. You can readily perceive     that if the bullet should encounter a bone or other hard substance     when entering a man's body, it will explode and thereby produce a     fatal wound.                                                                  F. J. C.     PHILADELPHIA, August 23, 1862.  In the Patent Office Report (United States) for 1863-4 will be found a shell exactly corresponding to this one:      No. 39,593--Joseph Nottingham Smith, New York, N. Y.--_Improvement     in Elongated Projectile for Firearms_--Patent dated August 18, 1863.      It consists of an elongated cylinder having a charge chamber in its     rear portion, which contains powder for propulsion. The point is a     pointed axical bolt, whose rear is furnished with a percussion cap,     to be exploded by the forward motion of a striker on the concussion     of the projectile.  Not having seen this ball, I cannot _certainly_ identify it with the ball mentioned by F. J. C., but it is evidently the same.  The inference is very natural that if these several projectiles, patented by the United States Patent Office, as the invention of Northern men, during the war, and used by the United States armies, were ever used by the Confederates, it was only as captured ammunition. It was hardly possible, at any reasonable cost, to run them through the blockade to the South.  In conclusion, it may be well to draw attention to Mr. Lossing's intimation in the note quoted at the beginning of this paper, that the men of the South were forced into the Confederate ranks against their will, while those of the North were volunteers. Does Mr. Lossing purposely forget the United States drafts made to fill up the depleted regiments in the field, and especially the draft of May, 1863, two months before the battle of Gettysburg, and the riots that occurred in New York city as the result of that draft? Does he purposely forget that the United States established recruiting offices in Europe to procure men for her armies?  It may be questioned whether as a historian Mr. Lossing is deserving even the notice of a novice in history; for, while he is known to be a voluminous writer of American history, he is also known to be a writer of many and great inaccuracies. A writer who has allowed himself to be so easily imposed upon as in his ready acceptance as true history of the Morgan Jones Welsh Indian fraud (American Historical Record, I, 250); who makes such glaring historical mistakes as his statement that General Braddock was defeated and killed at the \"battle of the Great Meadows\" (History of the Revolutionary War), and that Captain John Smith, the Virginia explorer, had explored the Susquehanna river as far north as the Wyoming Valley (Harper's Magazine, November, 1860), and who draws so largely on his imagination, and is so much controlled by his prejudices in his \"History of the Civil War,\" cannot be considered an entirely trustworthy historian. But because Mr. Lossing's histories have flooded the North, and are largely accepted as authentic narrations of events, it is due to the Confederates and the cause for which they so long and nobly battled, against such fearful odds, that the truth be made known and Mr. Lossing's misstatements exposed.  It is earnestly to be hoped that the facts presented in this paper will forever set at rest the malicious slander so often repeated against the Confederates, by many who are so willing to believe anything against them, of having authorized the use in military warfare of such atrocious and barbarous missiles as \"_explosive and poisoned_\" musket or rifle balls.                                                                  H. E. H.  BROWNSVILLE, PA., September 1, 1879.

But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”  It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.  All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:  “If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.”  “Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.  “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.  “Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the whole evening, I hope?”  “And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me to take me there.”  “I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”  “If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.  “Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.”  “What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”  Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in"]]]
