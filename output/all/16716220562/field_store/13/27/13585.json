Mysticism is, in essence, little more than a certain intensity and depth of feeling in regard to what is believed about the universe; and this kind of feeling leads Heraclitus, on the basis of his science, to strangely poignant sayings concerning life and the world, such as:  \"Time is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child's.\"  It is poetic imagination, not science, which presents Time as despotic lord of the world, with all the irresponsible frivolity of a child. It is mysticism, too, which leads Heraclitus to assert the identity of opposites: \"Good and ill are one,\" he says; and again: \"To God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\"  Much of mysticism underlies the ethics of Heraclitus. It is true that a scientific determinism alone might have inspired the statement: \"Man's character is his fate\"; but only a mystic would have said:  \"Every beast is driven to the pasture with blows\"; and again:  \"It is hard to fight with one's heart's desire. Whatever it wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of soul\"; and again:  \"Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.\"[1]  Examples might be multiplied, but those that have been given are enough to show the character of the man: the facts of science, as they appeared to him, fed the flame in his soul, and in its light he saw into the depths of the world by the reflection of his own dancing swiftly penetrating fire. In such a nature we see the true union of the mystic and the man of science--the highest eminence, as I think, that it is possible to achieve in the world of thought.  In Plato, the same twofold impulse exists, though the mystic impulse is distinctly the stronger of the two, and secures ultimate victory whenever the conflict is sharp. His description of the cave is the classical statement of belief in a knowledge and reality truer and more real than that of the senses:    \"Imagine[2] a number of men living in an underground cavernous   chamber, with an entrance open to the light, extending along the   entire length of the cavern, in which they have been confined, from   their childhood, with their legs and necks so shackled that they   are obliged to sit still and look straight forwards, because their   chains render it impossible for them to turn their heads round: and   imagine a bright fire burning some way off, above and behind them,   and an elevated roadway passing between the fire and the prisoners,   with a low wall built along it, like the screens which conjurors   put up in front of their audience, and above which they exhibit   their wonders.    I have it, he replied.    Also figure to yourself a number of persons walking behind this   wall, and carrying with them statues of men, and images of other   animals, wrought in wood and stone and all kinds of materials,   together with various other articles, which overtop the wall; and,   as you might expect, let some of the passers-by be talking, and   others silent.    You are describing a strange scene, and strange prisoners.    They resemble us, I replied.    Now consider what would happen if the course of nature brought them   a release from their fetters, and a remedy for their foolishness,   in the following manner. Let us suppose that one of them has been   released, and compelled suddenly to stand up, and turn his neck   round and walk with open eyes towards the light; and let us suppose   that he goes through all these actions with pain, and that the   dazzling splendour renders him incapable of discerning those   objects of which he used formerly to see the shadows. What answer   should you expect him to make, if some one were to tell him that in   those days he was watching foolish phantoms, but that now he is   somewhat nearer to reality, and is turned towards things more real,   and sees more correctly; above all, if he were to point out to him   the several objects that are passing by, and question him, and   compel him to answer what they are? Should you not expect him to be   puzzled, and to regard his old visions as truer than the objects   now forced upon his notice?    Yes, much truer....    Hence, I suppose, habit will be necessary to enable him to perceive   objects in that upper world. At first he will be most successful in   distinguishing shadows; then he will discern the reflections of men   and other things in water, and afterwards the realities; and after   this he will raise his eyes to encounter the light of the moon and   stars, finding it less difficult to study the heavenly bodies and   the heaven itself by night, than the sun and the sun's light by   day.    Doubtless.    Last of all, I imagine, he will be able to observe and contemplate   the nature of the sun, not as it _appears_ in water or on alien   ground, but as it is in itself in its own territory.    Of course.    His next step will be to draw the conclusion, that the sun is the   author of the seasons and the years, and the guardian of all things   in the visible world, and in a manner the cause of all those things   which he and his companions used to see.    Obviously, this will be his next step....    Now this imaginary case, my dear Glancon, you must apply in all its   parts to our former statements, by comparing the region which the   eye reveals to the prison house, and the light of the fire therein   to the power of the sun: and if, by the upward ascent and the   contemplation of the upper world, you understand the mounting of   the soul into the intellectual region, you will hit the tendency of   my own surmises, since you desire to be told what they are; though,   indeed, God only knows whether they are correct. But, be that as it   may, the view which I take of the subject is to the following   effect. In the world of knowledge, the essential Form of Good is   the limit of our enquiries, and can barely be perceived; but, when   perceived, we cannot help concluding that it is in every case the   source of all that is bright and beautiful,--in the visible world   giving birth to light and its master, and in the intellectual world   dispensing, immediately and with full authority, truth and   reason;--and that whosoever would act wisely, either in private or   in public, must set this Form of Good before his eyes.\"  But in this passage, as throughout most of Plato's teaching, there is an identification of the good with the truly real, which became embodied in the philosophical tradition, and is still largely operative in our own day. In thus allowing a legislative function to the good, Plato produced a divorce between philosophy and science, from which, in my opinion, both have suffered ever since and are still suffering. The man of science, whatever his hopes may be, must lay them aside while he studies nature; and the philosopher, if he is to achieve truth, must do the same. Ethical considerations can only legitimately appear when the truth has been ascertained: they can and should appear as determining our feeling towards the truth, and our manner of ordering our lives in view of the truth, but not as themselves dictating what the truth is to be.  There are passages in Plato--among those which illustrate the scientific side of his mind--where he seems clearly aware of this. The most noteworthy is the one in which Socrates, as a young man, is explaining the theory of ideas to Parmenides.  After Socrates has explained that there is an idea of the good, but not of such things as hair and mud and dirt, Parmenides advises him \"not to despise even the meanest things,\" and this advice shows the genuine scientific temper. It is with this impartial temper that the mystic's apparent insight into a higher reality and a hidden good has to be combined if philosophy is to realise its greatest possibilities. And it is failure in this respect that has made so much of idealistic philosophy thin, lifeless, and insubstantial. It is only in marriage with the world that our ideals can bear fruit: divorced from it, they remain barren. But marriage with the world is not to be achieved by an ideal which shrinks from fact, or demands in advance that the world shall conform to its desires.  Parmenides himself is the source of a peculiarly interesting strain of mysticism which pervades Plato's thought--the mysticism which may be called \"logical\" because it is embodied in theories on logic. This form of mysticism, which appears, so far as the West is concerned, to have originated with Parmenides, dominates the reasonings of all the great mystical metaphysicians from his day to that of Hegel and his modern disciples. Reality, he says, is uncreated, indestructible, unchanging, indivisible; it is \"immovable in the bonds of mighty chains, without beginning and without end; since coming into being and passing away have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them away.\" The fundamental principle of his inquiry is stated in a sentence which would not be out of place in Hegel: \"Thou canst not know what is not--that is impossible--nor utter it; for it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be.\" And again: \"It needs must be that what can be thought and spoken of is; for it is possible for it to be, and it is not possible for what is nothing to be.\" The impossibility of change follows from this principle; for what is past can be spoken of, and therefore, by the principle, still is.  Mystical philosophy, in all ages and in all parts of the world, is characterised by certain beliefs which are illustrated by the doctrines we have been considering.  There is, first, the belief in insight as against discursive analytic knowledge: the belief in a way of wisdom, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25447"],["title","Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays (#2)"],["body","sudden, penetrating, coercive, which is contrasted with the slow and fallible study of outward appearance by a science relying wholly upon the senses. All who are capable of absorption in an inward passion must have experienced at times the strange feeling of unreality in common objects, the loss of contact with daily things, in which the solidity of the outer world is lost, and the soul seems, in utter loneliness, to bring forth, out of its own depths, the mad dance of fantastic phantoms which have hitherto appeared as independently real and living. This is the negative side of the mystic's initiation: the doubt concerning common knowledge, preparing the way for the reception of what seems a higher wisdom. Many men to whom this negative experience is familiar do not pass beyond it, but for the mystic it is merely the gateway to an ampler world.  The mystic insight begins with the sense of a mystery unveiled, of a hidden wisdom now suddenly become certain beyond the possibility of a doubt. The sense of certainty and revelation comes earlier than any definite belief. The definite beliefs at which mystics arrive are the result of reflection upon the inarticulate experience gained in the moment of insight. Often, beliefs which have no real connection with this moment become subsequently attracted into the central nucleus; thus in addition to the convictions which all mystics share, we find, in many of them, other convictions of a more local and temporary character, which no doubt become amalgamated with what was essentially mystical in virtue of their subjective certainty. We may ignore such inessential accretions, and confine ourselves to the beliefs which all mystics share.  The first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination is belief in the possibility of a way of knowledge which may be called revelation or insight or intuition, as contrasted with sense, reason, and analysis, which are regarded as blind guides leading to the morass of illusion. Closely connected with this belief is the conception of a Reality behind the world of appearance and utterly different from it. This Reality is regarded with an admiration often amounting to worship; it is felt to be always and everywhere close at hand, thinly veiled by the shows of sense, ready, for the receptive mind, to shine in its glory even through the apparent folly and wickedness of Man. The poet, the artist, and the lover are seekers after that glory: the haunting beauty that they pursue is the faint reflection of its sun. But the mystic lives in the full light of the vision: what others dimly seek he knows, with a knowledge beside which all other knowledge is ignorance.  The second characteristic of mysticism is its belief in unity, and its refusal to admit opposition or division anywhere. We found Heraclitus saying \"good and ill are one\"; and again he says, \"the way up and the way down is one and the same.\" The same attitude appears in the simultaneous assertion of contradictory propositions, such as: \"We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\" The assertion of Parmenides, that reality is one and indivisible, comes from the same impulse towards unity. In Plato, this impulse is less prominent, being held in check by his theory of ideas; but it reappears, so far as his logic permits, in the doctrine of the primacy of the Good.  A third mark of almost all mystical metaphysics is the denial of the reality of Time. This is an outcome of the denial of division; if all is one, the distinction of past and future must be illusory. We have seen this doctrine prominent in Parmenides; and among moderns it is fundamental in the systems of Spinoza and Hegel.  The last of the doctrines of mysticism which we have to consider is its belief that all evil is mere appearance, an illusion produced by the divisions and oppositions of the analytic intellect. Mysticism does not maintain that such things as cruelty, for example, are good, but it denies that they are real: they belong to that lower world of phantoms from which we are to be liberated by the insight of the vision. Sometimes--for example in Hegel, and at least verbally in Spinoza--not only evil, but good also, is regarded as illusory, though nevertheless the emotional attitude towards what is held to be Reality is such as would naturally be associated with the belief that Reality is good. What is, in all cases, ethically characteristic of mysticism is absence of indignation or protest, acceptance with joy, disbelief in the ultimate truth of the division into two hostile camps, the good and the bad. This attitude is a direct outcome of the nature of the mystical experience: with its sense of unity is associated a feeling of infinite peace. Indeed it may be suspected that the feeling of peace produces, as feelings do in dreams, the whole system of associated beliefs which make up the body of mystic doctrine. But this is a difficult question, and one on which it cannot be hoped that mankind will reach agreement.  Four questions thus arise in considering the truth or falsehood of mysticism, namely:    I. Are there two ways of knowing, which may be called respectively   reason and intuition? And if so, is either to be preferred to the   other?    II. Is all plurality and division illusory?    III. Is time unreal?    IV. What kind of reality belongs to good and evil?  On all four of these questions, while fully developed mysticism seems to me mistaken, I yet believe that, by sufficient restraint, there is an element of wisdom to be learned from the mystical way of feeling, which does not seem to be attainable in any other manner. If this is the truth, mysticism is to be commended as an attitude towards life, not as a creed about the world. The meta-physical creed, I shall maintain, is a mistaken outcome of the emotion, although this emotion, as colouring and informing all other thoughts and feelings, is the inspirer of whatever is best in Man. Even the cautious and patient investigation of truth by science, which seems the very antithesis of the mystic's swift certainty, may be fostered and nourished by that very spirit of reverence in which mysticism lives and moves.   I. REASON AND INTUITION[3]  Of the reality or unreality of the mystic's world I know nothing. I have no wish to deny it, nor even to declare that the insight which reveals it is not a genuine insight. What I do wish to maintain--and it is here that the scientific attitude becomes imperative--is that insight, untested and unsupported, is an insufficient guarantee of truth, in spite of the fact that much of the most important truth is first suggested by its means. It is common to speak of an opposition between instinct and reason; in the eighteenth century, the opposition was drawn in favour of reason, but under the influence of Rousseau and the romantic movement instinct was given the preference, first by those who rebelled against artificial forms of government and thought, and then, as the purely rationalistic defence of traditional theology became increasingly difficult, by all who felt in science a menace to creeds which they associated with a spiritual outlook on life and the world. Bergson, under the name of \"intuition,\" has raised instinct to the position of sole arbiter of metaphysical truth. But in fact the opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct, intuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it is possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other beliefs no less instinctive. Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realm, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.  Where instinct and reason do sometimes conflict is in regard to single beliefs, held instinctively, and held with such determination that no degree of inconsistency with other beliefs leads to their abandonment. Instinct, like all human faculties, is liable to error. Those in whom reason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards themselves, though all admit it in regard to others. Where instinct is least liable to error is in practical matters as to which right judgment is a help to survival: friendship and hostility in others, for instance, are often felt with extraordinary discrimination through very careful disguises. But even in such matters a wrong impression may be given by reserve or flattery; and in matters less directly practical, such as philosophy deals with, very strong instinctive beliefs are sometimes wholly mistaken, as we may come to know through their perceived inconsistency with other equally strong beliefs. It is such considerations that necessitate the harmonising mediation of reason, which tests our beliefs by their mutual compatibility, and examines, in doubtful cases, the possible sources of error on the one side and on the other. In this there is no opposition to instinct as a whole, but only to blind reliance upon some one interesting aspect of instinct to the exclusion of other more commonplace but not less trustworthy aspects. It is such one-sidedness, not instinct itself, that reason aims at correcting.  These more or less trite maxims may be illustrated by application to Bergson's advocacy of \"intuition\" as against \"intellect.\" There are, he says, \"two profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. The first implies that we move round the object: the second that we enter into it. The first depends on the point of view at which we are placed and on the symbols by which we express ourselves. The second neither depends on a point of view nor relies on any symbol. The first kind of knowledge may be said to stop at the _relative_; the second, in those cases where it is possible, to attain the _absolute_.\"[4] The second of these, which is intuition, is, he says, \"the kind of _intellectual sympathy_ by which one places oneself within "]]]
