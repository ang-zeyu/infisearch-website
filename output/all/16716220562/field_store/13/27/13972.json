Hapgood          PREFACE.        A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about       Notre-Dame, the author of this book found, in an obscure nook of       one of the towers, the following word, engraved by hand upon the       wall:—         ἈΝÁΓΚΗ.        These Greek capitals, black with age, and quite deeply graven in       the stone, with I know not what signs peculiar to Gothic       caligraphy imprinted upon their forms and upon their attitudes,       as though with the purpose of revealing that it had been a hand       of the Middle Ages which had inscribed them there, and especially       the fatal and melancholy meaning contained in them, struck the       author deeply.        He questioned himself; he sought to divine who could have been       that soul in torment which had not been willing to quit this       world without leaving this stigma of crime or unhappiness upon       the brow of the ancient church.        Afterwards, the wall was whitewashed or scraped down, I know not       which, and the inscription disappeared. For it is thus that       people have been in the habit of proceeding with the marvellous       churches of the Middle Ages for the last two hundred years.       Mutilations come to them from every quarter, from within as well       as from without. The priest whitewashes them, the archdeacon       scrapes them down; then the populace arrives and demolishes them.        Thus, with the exception of the fragile memory which the author       of this book here consecrates to it, there remains to-day nothing       whatever of the mysterious word engraved within the gloomy tower       of Notre-Dame,—nothing of the destiny which it so sadly summed       up. The man who wrote that word upon the wall disappeared from       the midst of the generations of man many centuries ago; the word,       in its turn, has been effaced from the wall of the church; the       church will, perhaps, itself soon disappear from the face of the       earth.        It is upon this word that this book is founded.        March, 1831.             CONTENTS             PREFACE.             VOLUME I.           BOOK FIRST.           CHAPTER I.

Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen       days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the       bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the       town ringing a full peal.        The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which       history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in       the event which thus set the bells and the _bourgeois_ of Paris       in a ferment from early morning. It was neither an assault by the       Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt led along in procession,       nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor an entry of       “our much dread lord, monsieur the king,” nor even a pretty       hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris.       Neither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century,       of some plumed and bedizened embassy. It was barely two days       since the last cavalcade of that nature, that of the Flemish       ambassadors charged with concluding the marriage between the       dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its entry into       Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon, who,       for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an       amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish       burgomasters, and to regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a       very “pretty morality, allegorical satire, and farce,” while a       driving rain drenched the magnificent tapestries at his door.        What put the “whole population of Paris in commotion,” as Jehan       de Troyes expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double       solemnity, united from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the       Feast of Fools.        On that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Grève, a       maypole at the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de       Justice. It had been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the       preceding evening at all the cross roads, by the provost’s men,       clad in handsome, short, sleeveless coats of violet camelot, with       large white crosses upon their breasts.        So the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their       houses and shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn,       towards some one of the three spots designated.        Each had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole;       another, the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the       good sense of the loungers of Paris, that the greater part of       this crowd directed their steps towards the bonfire, which was       quite in season, or towards the mystery play, which was to be       presented in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice (the courts       of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that the curious       left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone       beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of       Braque.        The populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in       particular, because they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who       had arrived two days previously, intended to be present at the       representation of the mystery, and at the election of the Pope of       the Fools, which was also to take place in the grand hall.        It was no easy matter on that day, to force one’s way into that       grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest       covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not       yet measured the grand hall of the Château of Montargis). The       palace place, encumbered with people, offered to the curious       gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into which five or six       streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every moment       fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented       incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which       projected here and there, like so many promontories, into the       irregular basin of the place. In the centre of the lofty       Gothic[1] façade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly       ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting      "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2610"],["title","Notre-Dame de Paris (#1)"],["body"," on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves along       its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled       incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The       cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet,       produced a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time,       this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the       crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became       troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the buffet of       an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants, which       kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the       provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to       the _maréchaussée_, the _maréchaussée_ to our _gendarmeri_ of       Paris.        Thousands of good, calm, _bourgeois_ faces thronged the windows,       the doors, the dormer windows, the roofs, gazing at the palace,       gazing at the populace, and asking nothing more; for many       Parisians content themselves with the spectacle of the       spectators, and a wall behind which something is going on becomes       at once, for us, a very curious thing indeed.        If it could be granted to us, the men of 1830, to mingle in       thought with those Parisians of the fifteenth century, and to       enter with them, jostled, elbowed, pulled about, into that       immense hall of the palace, which was so cramped on that sixth of       January, 1482, the spectacle would not be devoid of either       interest or charm, and we should have about us only things that       were so old that they would seem new.        With the reader’s consent, we will endeavor to retrace in       thought, the impression which he would have experienced in       company with us on crossing the threshold of that grand hall, in       the midst of that tumultuous crowd in surcoats, short, sleeveless       jackets, and doublets.        And, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement       in the eyes. Above our heads is a double ogive vault, panelled       with wood carving, painted azure, and sown with golden       fleurs-de-lis; beneath our feet a pavement of black and white       marble, alternating. A few paces distant, an enormous pillar,       then another, then another; seven pillars in all, down the length       of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches of the double       vault, in the centre of its width. Around four of the pillars,       stalls of merchants, all sparkling with glass and tinsel; around       the last three, benches of oak, worn and polished by the trunk       hose of the litigants, and the robes of the attorneys. Around the       hall, along the lofty wall, between the doors, between the       windows, between the pillars, the interminable row of all the       kings of France, from Pharamond down: the lazy kings, with       pendent arms and downcast eyes; the valiant and combative kings,       with heads and arms raised boldly heavenward. Then in the long,       pointed windows, glass of a thousand hues; at the wide entrances       to the hall, rich doors, finely sculptured; and all, the vaults,       pillars, walls, jambs, panelling, doors, statues, covered from       top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumination, which,       a trifle tarnished at the epoch when we behold it, had almost       entirely disappeared beneath dust and spiders in the year of       grace, 1549, when du Breul still admired it from tradition.        Let the reader picture to himself now, this immense, oblong hall,       illuminated by the pallid light of a January day, invaded by a       motley and noisy throng which drifts along the walls, and eddies       round the seven pillars, and he will have a confused idea of the       whole effect of the picture, whose curious details we shall make       an effort to indicate with more precision.        It is certain, that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henri IV.,       there would have been no documents in the trial of Ravaillac       deposited in the clerk’s office of the Palais de Justice, no       accomplices interested in causing the said documents to       disappear; hence, no incendiaries obliged, for lack of better       means, to burn the clerk’s office in order to burn the documents,       and to burn the Palais de Justice in order to burn the clerk’s       office; consequently, in short, no conflagration in 1618. The old       Palais would be standing still, with its ancient grand hall; I       should be able to say to the reader, “Go and look at it,” and we       should thus both escape the necessity,—I of making, and he of       reading, a description of it, such as it is. Which demonstrates a       new truth: that great events have incalculable results.        It is true that it may be quite possible, in the first place,       that Ravaillac had no accomplices; and in the second, that if he       had any, they were in no way connected with the fire of 1618. Two       other very plausible explanations exist: First, the great flaming       star, a foot broad, and a cubit high, which fell from heaven, as       every one knows, upon the law courts, after midnight on the       seventh of March; second, Théophile’s quatrain,—      “Sure, ’twas but a sorry game     When at Paris, Dame Justice,     Through having eaten too much spice,     Set the palace all aflame.”        Whatever may be thought of this triple explanation, political,       physical, and poetical, of the burning of the law courts in 1618,       the unfortunate fact of the fire is certain. Very little to-day       remains, thanks to this catastrophe,—thanks, above all, to the       successive restorations which have completed what it spared,—very       little remains of that first dwelling of the kings of France,—of       that elder palace of the Louvre, already so old in the time of       Philip the Handsome, that they sought there for the traces of the       magnificent buildings erected by King Robert and described by       Helgaldus. Nearly everything has disappeared. What has become of       the chamber of the chancellery, where Saint Louis consummated his       marriage? the garden where he administered justice, “clad in a       coat of camelot, a surcoat of linsey-woolsey, without sleeves,       and a sur-mantle of black sandal, as he lay upon the carpet with       Joinville?” Where is the chamber of the Emperor Sigismond? and       that of Charles IV.? that of Jean the Landless? Where is the       staircase, from which Charles VI. promulgated his edict of       pardon? the slab where Marcel cut the throats of Robert de       Clermont and the Marshal of Champagne, in the presence of the       dauphin? the wicket where the bulls of Pope Benedict were torn,       and whence those who had brought them departed decked out, in       derision, in copes and mitres, and making an apology through all       Paris? and the grand hall, with its gilding, its azure, its       statues, its pointed arches, its pillars, its immense vault, all       fretted with carvings? and the gilded chamber? and the stone       lion, which stood at the door, with lowered head and tail between       his legs, like the lions on the throne of Solomon, in the       humiliated attitude which befits force in the presence of       justice? and the beautiful doors? and the stained glass? and the       chased ironwork, which drove Biscornette to despair? and the       delicate woodwork of Hancy? What has time, what have men done       with these marvels? What have they given us in return for all       this Gallic history, for all this Gothic art? The heavy flattened       arches of M. de Brosse, that awkward architect of the       Saint-Gervais portal. So much for art; and, as for history, we       have the gossiping reminiscences of the great pillar, still       ringing with the tattle of the Patru.        It is not much. Let us return to the veritable grand hall of the       veritable old palace. The two extremities of this gigantic       parallelogram were occupied, the one by the famous marble table,       so long, so broad, and so thick that, as the ancient land       rolls—in a style that would have given Gargantua an appetite—say,       “such a slice of marble as was never beheld in the world”; the       other by the chapel where Louis XI. had himself sculptured on his       knees before the Virgin, and whither he caused to be brought,       without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of royal       statues, the statues of Charlemagne and of Saint Louis, two       saints whom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven, as kings       of France. This chapel, quite new, having been built only six       years, was entirely in that charming taste of delicate       architecture, of marvellous sculpture, of fine and deep chasing,       which marks with us the end of the Gothic era, and which is       perpetuated to about the middle of the sixteenth century in the       fairylike fancies of the Renaissance. The little open-work rose       window, pierced above the portal, was, in particular, a       masterpiece of lightness and grace; one would have pronounced it       a star of lace.        In the middle of the hall, opposite the great door, a platform of       gold brocade, placed against the wall, a special entrance to       which had been effected through a window in the corridor of the       gold chamber, had been erected for the Flemish emissaries and the       other great personages invited to the presentation of the mystery       play.        It was upon the marble table that the mystery was to be enacted,       as usual. It had been arranged for the purpose, early in the       morning; its rich slabs of marble, all scratched by the heels of       law clerks, supported a cage of carpenter’s work of considerable       height, the upper surface of which, within view of the"]]]
