The ram was expected to come out to-day. On the 15th, at 11-1/2 a.m., the Valley City got under weigh, and arrived off Edenton at 11-1/2 o'clock p.m. Captain J. A. J. Brooks, Paymaster J. W. Sands, and Acting Master James G. Green, went ashore. At 5 p.m. they returned, and the Valley City got under weigh, and proceeded to the mouth of Roanoke river. The weather is cool and beautiful. At 10 a.m. of the 20th, I went aboard the Commodore Hull. At 12 m., returned aboard the Valley City. At 9-1/2 p.m., the Valley City steamed to off Edenton, to protect the tug Belle, which had got hard and fast aground during the day. On the 21st I went ashore at Edenton, and spent a pleasant time. I returned to the Valley City, when she proceeded to off Roanoke Island, where we arrived on the 22d at 8 o'clock a.m. At 9 o'clock a.m., Captain J. A. J. Brooks, Acting Assistant Paymaster J. W. Sands and I went ashore, and made the acquaintance of Dr. Walton, of the 103d Pennsylvania regiment, and Colonel Wardrobe, Commandant of Roanoke Island. I spent a very pleasant time in company with these gentlemen. In the evening I became acquainted with Lieutenant Wm. B. Cushing, U.S. Navy. I will quote a war reminiscence which was published in the Philadelphia _Weekly Times_ of June 7, 1879:      \"CUSHING, THE BRAVE.      \"_Reminiscence of His Heroic Adventure in Albemarle Sound:     By J. M. Batten, M.D., late U.S.N._      \"It was on the evening of October 22d, 1864, I first met Captain     Wm. B. Cushing. I was then attached to the United States steamer     Valley City, Captain J. A. J. Brooks commanding. The vessel was     anchored about a mile west of Roanoke Island, in Pamlico Sound.     Captain J. A. J. Brooks, Paymaster J. W. Sands and myself, left the     vessel in the morning, the wind blowing a strong breeze from the     west, and arrived at Roanoke Island. The wind continuing to blow     almost a hurricane, we attempted to return to the vessel in the     evening, but failed; consequently we were compelled to remain on     Roanoke Island all night. As I said, it was on this evening I first     met Captain Wm. B. Cushing. He then was a young man of twenty-one     or twenty-two years of age, wore long, light hair falling around     his neck, and was rather reserved in his manners. Captain Cushing,     Captain Brooks, Paymaster Sands and myself, occupied a room     together that night. The next morning when I awoke, I found that     Captain Cushing had gone. Upon making inquiry about him, I learned     he had departed at 4 a.m. of the 23d, in his torpedo launch, a boat     he had constructed at the Navy Yard, Brooklyn, for a certain     purpose, and had proceeded this far on his expedition with the     steam launch.      \"In referring to my diary, I find that on Friday, October 28, at     5:30 a.m., the Valley City weighed anchor and proceeded toward the     fleet. The weather was clear but windy. We arrived at the fleet at     6 p.m. The fleet was composed of twelve double-ender side-wheel     vessels, manned, armed and equipped, and commanded by Commodore Wm.     H. Macomb, and was anchored about six miles from the mouth of     Roanoke river, in Albemarle Sound, and fourteen miles from     Plymouth, where the Albemarle was stationed. My diary states that     at 7 p.m. we got under weigh, and proceeded to the mouth of Roanoke     river, where we arrived at 8:30 p.m. At 11 p.m. we were hailed by a     voice at the mouth of Roanoke river: \"Boat ahoy! send a boat!\" A     boat was sent, and the man who had left us so early in the morning     of the 23d of October--Captain William B. Cushing--was brought on     board the Valley City in his stocking feet, with only a coarse     flannel shirt and pantaloons to cover him. He was wet, cold, tired,     hungry and prostrated.      \"My diary states that after leaving us on the morning of the 23d of     October he steamed to the fleet in his torpedo launch, having     received from the crews of the fleet twelve volunteer men to     accompany him. On the evening of October 27th he proceeded with his     small torpedo launch, with a torpedo rigged on her bow, up the     Roanoke river. At 3:15 a.m., October 28th, exploded torpedo under     the ram Albemarle and sunk her. He (Captain Cushing) and another     man were the only ones saved from drowning or capture. Captain     Cushing, after blowing up the ram, jumped into the river, swam     ashore, lay in the swamps near Plymouth till night, then proceeded     through the swamps till he came to a creek, where he captured a     skiff belonging to a Confederate picket, and paddled himself to the     Valley City. The torpedo boat was sunk, and about a dozen men were     either drowned or captured. In the meantime, the fleet had moved up     to the mouth of Roanoke river. Upon learning that Captain Cushing     was on board the Valley City, Commodore Macomb ordered the riggings     of the fleet to be manned, and at the general signal to give     Captain Cushing three hearty good cheers; and such cheering--it     made those swamps, forests and waters resound with the voices of     glad-hearted men.      \"On the following day, October 29th, at 11 o'clock a.m., the fleet     weighed anchor with every man at his post, and proceeded up Roanoke     river, the Valley City leading, for the purpose of confirming the     report of Captain Cushing that the Albemarle ram was sunk; and, if     true, capturing Plymouth. This is a small town situated on the     right bank of the Roanoke river, eight miles from its mouth,     surrounded by swamps and large cypress trees as far as the eye can     reach. One mile above Plymouth the waters of the Roanoke river     divide, one forming the Cashie river, the other the Roanoke river.     At about two thirds of the distance from the mouth of the Roanoke     river to Plymouth, the Cashie river and the Roanoke river are     connected by what is called Middle river, so that these rivers in     their course at these points formed a figure resembling the capital     letter A, the left line the Roanoke river, the right line the     Cashie river, and the horizontal line the Middle river.      \"The fleet steamed up Roanoke river. The day was beautiful, the     birds were singing in the branches of the trees, the leaves of     which were gently rustling, and the water could be heard dripping     from the wheels of the fleet as they made their slow revolutions.     All else was quiet. No man said a word. This was not strange, for     we believed the river to be full of torpedoes and its banks lined     with sharpshooters. We ascended further and further up the river     till we came to Middle river, when the Valley City steamed through     Middle and up the Cashie river. The remainder of the fleet steamed     on up Roanoke river.      \"After arriving at a point in the Cashie river opposite Plymouth,     we heard heavy firing by the fleet, which continued an hour, and     then suddenly ceased. We thought, of course, that Plymouth had been     captured. At this point we picked up the other man who was with the     expedition, and who escaped. The Valley City continued to ascend     the Cashie river, and after encountering much difficulty on account     of the narrowness and crookedness of the river, we arrived at the     Roanoke river above Plymouth, where we could see the town, but we     could see no fleet nor American flag. We concluded then that the     Albemarle had not been sunk, but had driven the fleet back into the     Sound. Of course, it was not a very happy feeling to fear the ram     might prevent our retreat.      \"After some delay, and an exchange of shot with the enemy at     Plymouth, we descended the Cashie river to Albemarle Sound, where     we arrived at 8 p.m., and found the fleet at the mouth of Roanoke     river. They had ascended the Roanoke river till they came to some     obstruction which placed them at a disadvantage to the enemy; they     then descended the river.      \"Commodore Macomb was now convinced that the ram Albemarle was     sunk. The Valley City was now detached to convey Captain Cushing to     Fortress Monroe. We weighed anchor at 12:30 a.m., October 30th, and     proceeded through Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, and into the     Atlantic Ocean, and arrived at Fortress Monroe at 7 a.m., November     1. A fleet of about one hundred vessels was stationed there,     preparatory to making an onslaught on Wilmington. Captain Wm. B.     Cushing was received on board the flagship with a salute of     twenty-one guns, and, of course, was almost worshiped for his     heroic achievement. It was at Fortress Monroe I first saw the     United States steamer Kearsarge, of Commodore Winslow and Alabama     fame. My attention was directed to her by hearing an old sailor     say, 'Does she not sit like a duck on water?' And truly she did.      \"Captain Cushing is now dead. He certainly was one of the bravest     men that ever trod the decks of a man-of-war. Peace to his ashes!     Commodore Macomb is also dead; he died in your city of Brotherly     Love, while taking a bath. We all loved him. God bless him.\"      Published in the New York _Herald_, Thursday, November 3, 1864.      THE RAM ALBEMARLE.

I therefore took one of the Shamrock's     cutters in tow, with orders to cast off and board at that point in     case we were hailed.      \"Our boat succeeded in passing the pickets, and even the Southfield     within twenty yards, without discovery, and we were not hailed     until by the lookouts on the ram.      \"The cutter was then cut off and ordered below, while we made for     our enemy under a full head of steam. The rebels sprang their     rattle, rang the bell and commenced firing, at the same time     repeating their hail, and seeming much confused.      \"The light of the fire ashore showed me the iron-clad made fast to     the wharf, with logs around her, about thirty feet from her side.     Passing her closely, we made a complete circle, so as to strike her     fairly, and went into her bows on.      \"By this time the enemy's fire was very severe, but a dose of     canister at short range seemed to moderate their zeal and disturb     their aim.      \"Paymaster Swann, of the Otsego, was wounded near me, but how many     more I know not. Three bullets struck my clothing, and the air     seemed full of them.      \"In a moment we had struck the logs just abreast of the quarter     post, breaking them in some feet, our bows resting on them. The     torpedo boom was then lowered, and by a vigorous pull I succeeded     in diving the torpedo under the over-hang and exploding it.      \"At the same time the Albemarle's guns were fired. A shot seemed to     go crashing through my boat, and a dense mass of water rolled in     from the torpedo, filling the launch, and completely disabling her.      \"The enemy then continued their fire at fifteen feet range, and     demanded our surrender, which I twice refused, ordering the men to     save themselves, and removing my overcoat and shoes. Springing into     the river, I swam with others into the middle of the stream, the     rebels failing to hit us.      \"The most of our party were captured; some were drowned, and only     one escaped besides myself, and he in another direction.      \"Acting Master's mate, Woodman, of the Commodore Hull, met me in     the water half a mile below the town, and I assisted him as best I     could, but failed to get him ashore. Completely exhausted, I     managed to reach the shore, but was too weak to crawl out of the     water until just at daylight, when I managed to creep into the     swamp close to the fort.      \"While hiding close to the path, the Albemarle's officers passed,     and I judged from their conversation that the ram was destroyed.     Some hours traveling in the swamp served to bring me out well below     the town, when I sent a negro in to gain information, and found     that the ram was truly sunk. Proceeding through another swamp, I     came to a creek, and captured a skiff belonging to a picket of the     enemy, and with this, by eleven o'clock the next night, I made my     way out to the Valley City.      \"Acting Master's mate, William L. Howorth, of the Monticello,     showed as usual conspicuous bravery. He is the same officer who has     been with me twice in Wilmington Harbor. I trust he may be promoted     when exchanged, as well as Acting Third Assistant Engineer     Stolsbury, who, being for the first time under fire, handled his     engine promptly and with coolness. All the officers and men behaved     in the most gallant manner.      \"The cutter of the Shamrock boarded the Southfield, but found no     guns there. Four prisoners were taken there. The ram is now     completely submerged, and the enemy have sunk three schooners in     the river to obstruct the passage of our ships.      \"I desire to call the attention of the Admiral and department to     the spirit manifested by the sailors on the ships in these sounds.     But few hands were wanted, but all hands were eager to go into the     action, offering their chosen shipmates a month's pay to resign in     their favor.      \"I am sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,      \"W.

He did his duty well, and deserves a medal of honor.      \"Respectfully,      \"WM. B. CUSHING, U.S.N.\"       THE HERALD DESPATCHES.      [Mr. Galen H. Osborn's Despatch]      \"FORTRESS MONROE, VA., November 1, 1864.      \"The United States steamer Valley City arrived at Hampton Roads     from the blockading squadron of the Sounds of North Carolina, this     morning. She brings the glorious tidings of the destruction of the     rebel iron-clad ram Albemarle. The terror of the Sounds is at the     bottom of Roanoke river. She was blown up by a torpedo early on the     morning of the 28th ultimo; and her destruction is due to the     personal heroism and reckless daring of Lieut. W. B. Cushing, of     the Navy. All the particulars I have been able to collect     concerning this feat, which stands prominently forth as one of the     most gallant of the war, I hasten to forward for the information of     the _Herald's_ readers.      \"On the night of Thursday, October 27, Lieutenant Cushing, who has     on several previous occasions especially distinguished himself,     manned a steam-launch with a party of thirteen officers and men,     mostly volunteers, and proceeded, under cover of the darkness, up     the river towards Plymouth. Eight miles from the mouth of the     stream the Albemarle lay, surrounded by a pen of logs and timber,     established to prevent her destruction by torpedoes.      \"As he approached this framework, Lieut. Cushing was discovered by     the officers of the ram, who hailed him. He gave no answer, the     enemy meantime maintaining against him a severe and galling fire,     to which he replied effectively with frequent doses of canister.     Finding that he could not approach the ram as he desired, a     complete circle was made by the Lieutenant, and the launch was     again brought fairly against the \"crib,\" bows on, pushing back a     portion of it, and leaving the bows of the launch resting on the     broken timbers.      \"At this moment, by a most vigorous effort, Lieut. Cushing     succeeded in driving a torpedo under the over-hang of the ram, and     exploded it. Simultaneously with the explosion, one of the     Albemarle's guns was fired, and the shot went crashing through the     launch. At the same instant a dense volume of water from the     torpedo came rushing into the launch, utterly disabling her.      \"Lieut. Cushing then ordered his men to save themselves. He himself     threw off his coat and shoes and sprang into the water. Several of     his men were captured and some were drowned, but I have not been     able to ascertain his exact loss. Lieut. Cushing, taking to the     swamp, managed to secrete himself from the enemy's pickets, and     brought up alongside of the steamer Valley City at about 11 o'clock     the next night, in a small skiff which he discovered and     appropriated on his way.      \"The steamer Valley City brought Lieutenant Cushing as a passenger,     and he reported in person to the Admiral the accomplishment of the     daring mission he was specially selected to perform. Though much     fatigued by the severities of his recent task, he is yet in good     health and spirits, and is at this moment the hero of the squadron.     He is the same officer that went to Smithville and captured General     Whiting's chief of staff, while a regiment of troops was quartered     in the buildings on the opposite side of the way. It was he who     took a small boat up the Wilmington river, past the forts and     batteries, landed and captured a rebel mail, staid three days in     the enemy's country, and finally came away in safety with his     trophies. But this last act of his stamps him as one of the most     daring men in the service. To attack an iron-clad like the     Albemarle, with a launch and a baker's dozen of men, would seem the     height of reckless folly; but to have succeeded in such an     enterprise, is to have earned a life lease of glory.      \"In the affair, paymaster Swann, of the Otsego, is known to have     been wounded, and master's mate Howarth, of the Monticello,     captured. Lieut. Cushing speaks very highly of the conduct of all     who were with him.      \"The destruction of the ram was not definitely known until the     following day, the 29th, when negroes sent to gain information     returned with the glorious news. Reports from other quarters     corroborated this intelligence, and finally a reconnoissance by the     Valley City revealed the Albemarle resting on the bottom, with only     her smoke-stack visible above the water.      \"The yellow fever is said not to have entirely disappeared from     Newbern, although the succession of sharp frosts in that vicinity     has somewhat dispelled it. The steamer John Farron left for that     port yesterday, taking an immense mail, and a number of officers     who have been congregating here for some time, waiting for the     sickly season to terminate.\"       [Mr. Oscar G.
