She is plainly dressed in homespun cloth and does not     wear hoopskirts. The President greets her with the utmost     deference._]      [_Taking both her hands._]  My dear young lady--I'm glad to see you--good old Pennsylvania Dutch! I knew you before you spoke--my folks came down to Virginia from there, in the old Colonial days----                               THE SISTER      [_Overcome._]  Oh--Meester--Presiden--you are so goot to me--you are so kind----      [_Pauses overcome._]  I haf no speech----                               LINCOLN  Come now, tell me in your own way what I can do to help you----                               THE SISTER  Oh--Meester Presiden--you can do all--you can do any t'ing--und I am so happy to see you--I cannot begin----                               LINCOLN      [_Soothing her._]  Take your time, little girl--all the others will have to wait on you now----                               THE SISTER  Ya-ya--it is my turn now--ya, und I must hurry.

Well, little girl, you don't need anybody to speak for you--you speak for yourself--you're good and honest and love your brother--and by jings, you don't wear hoopskirts--I'm sorry to rile old Stanton again----      [_Laughs._]  But I'm going to pardon your brother----!

LINCOLN      [_To_ NICOLAY.]  Send her to Stanton, and tell him to rush that order to stay the execution. They shall not shoot this poor boy, ignorant of our laws, but if he can find the man who put that little book----      [_Holds up book._]  into his hand, advising desertion--I'll hang him on a gallows forty cubits high!

I demand the right to see you--to ask the pardon of one of my constituents.                               LINCOLN  All right! Out with it!                               CONGRESSMAN  He is one of the solid citizens of Massachusetts; a slave trader whose ship has been confiscated. He has spent five years in prison, and cannot pay the heavy fine in money imposed---- He is not a bad man at heart.                               LINCOLN  And he wants _me_ to pardon him--this slave-trader----!                               CONGRESSMAN  I ask it as a matter of justice--he has paid the penalty--five long years in prison----                               LINCOLN      [_Laughs._]  I might pardon a murderer from old Massachusetts, she's done glorious service in this war--but a man who can make a business of going to Africa and robbing her of helpless men, women and children and selling them into bondage----!      [_He pauses and stiffens._]  --before that man can have liberty by any act of mine, he can stay in jail and rot!                               NICOLAY      [_To the Congressman._]  Now, you've got it----!                               CONGRESSMAN      [_Crestfallen._]  Yes--I heard it----                               LINCOLN      [_Turning back to his desk, and examining his papers._]  Good---- Bring in the next one, John!      [_As_ NICOLAY _exits with the Congressman who continues to talk in     loud tones, a sweet little girl of twelve slips by and reaches the     President's desk unannounced. The President has taken his seat and     is writing. While the President continues to write, the little girl     slips close and watches him wistfully. He lifts his head, sees her,     and smiles._]  Why, what a wee girl--and you got in here all by yourself----?                               VIRGINIA  I slipped in when no one was looking----                               LINCOLN  Did you? What did you do that for?                               VIRGINIA  I was afraid they wouldn't let me in, if they knew what I wanted----                               LINCOLN      [_Tenderly._]  And what _do_ you want?                               VIRGINIA  If you please, sir--a pass to go through the lines to Virginia--my brother's there--he was shot in the last battle--and I want to see him.                               LINCOLN  Of course, you do--and you shall too.      [_He seizes his pen, writes a pass and hands it to her._]                               VIRGINIA      [_Breathlessly._]  Oh, thank you--thank you!                               LINCOLN      [_Casually placing his hand on her head._]  Of course, you're loyal----?      [VIRGINIA'S _lips quiver, she hesitates, looks up into his face     through dimmed eyes, and her slender body stiffens as she slowly     speaks._]                               VIRGINIA  Yes--loyal--with all my heart--to Virginia!      [_The trembling little fingers hand the pass back as the tears roll     down her cheeks. LINCOLN looks away to hide from her his own     emotion, stoops and takes her hand in his. His voice is low and     tender and full of feeling._]                               LINCOLN  I know what it cost you to say that, child. You're a brave little girl! And I'll love you always for this glimpse you've given me of a great spirit and a great people. That's why I can't let the South go---- They can't leave this Union. We need them---- Now I can trust you----?                               VIRGINIA      [_Eagerly._]  Yes, sir!      [NICOLAY _enters with a young mother and baby and hesitates at     sight of the little girl._]                               LINCOLN  Come on in, John--it's all right. I'm about through with this young lady----      [NICOLAY _brings the young mother to the desk and_ LINCOLN _takes_     VIRGINIA _down stage._]  Come down here, dear, so old man Nicolay can't hear us--he mightn't understand.      [_He sits on a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25814"],["title","A Man of the People: A Drama of Abraham Lincoln (#5)"],["body","and draws the girl close._]  You see, I understand you--and can trust you implicitly. Now if I give you back this and let you go--will you promise me that no word shall pass your lips of what you've seen inside our lines?                               VIRGINIA  Oh, yes--I promise----!                               LINCOLN      [_Handing her the pass._]  May God speed the day, child, when your people and mine shall no longer be enemies----                               VIRGINIA  Thank you, sir!                               LINCOLN  Run now!      [VIRGINIA _exits. At the door she throws him a kiss._]      [LINCOLN _comes quickly to the mother and greets her cheerily._]  Well, little mother, what's the matter?      [_She hesitates and appeals to_ NICOLAY.]                               NICOLAY  Tell him yourself----                               THE MOTHER      [_Trembling._]  If you please, sir, we ain't been married but a little over a year, and my husband's never seen the baby----                               LINCOLN  That's too bad----                               THE MOTHER  He's in the army and I couldn't stand it any longer--so I came down to Washington to get a pass to take the baby to him. But he wouldn't let me have it at the War Office----                               LINCOLN      [_Laughs._]  I'll bet old Mars wouldn't--Phew!      [_Pauses and turns to_ NICOLAY.]  What do you say. John--let's send her down?                               NICOLAY  The strictest orders have been issued to allow no more women to go to the front----                               LINCOLN  Humph----! Well, I'll tell you what we _can_ do--give her husband a leave of absence, and let _him_ come up here to see _them_!                               THE MOTHER      [_Laughing and crying._]  You don't mind my laughing, do you? I just can't help it--I can't stop! I can't stop laughing!                               LINCOLN  Laugh and cry as much as you please--but tell me where are you stopping?                               THE MOTHER  Nowhere yet, sir----                               LINCOLN  How's that?                               THE MOTHER  I went straight from the depot to the War Office and then I just walked the street blind with crying till I made up my mind to come here.                               LINCOLN  We'll fix that then! Nicolay will write you an order that will take you and your baby to a good hospital and care for you till your husband comes--and fix it so _he_ can stay here a week with you----                               THE MOTHER      [_Laughs._]  I just can't thank you! I'm so happy, all I can do is to laugh!                               LINCOLN  Laugh on, little mother--and off with you now--clear out!      [_The mother goes out laughing._]      [NICOLAY _shows the little mother out and returns to_ LINCOLN.]                               NICOLAY  The deputation of colored men whom you asked to come this morning are waiting, sir--will you see them now?                               LINCOLN  At once----      [LINCOLN _turns to his desk and takes up a document containing his     plan of Colonization and examines it as_ NICOLAY _and three     well-dressed colored men enter. They are typical Africans._]                               FIRST NEGRO      [_Bowing deferentially._]  Mr. President----!                               SECOND NEGRO      [_Tenderly._]  _Our_ Father Abraham----                               THIRD NEGRO      [_With religious feeling._]  We salute our Savior!                               LINCOLN  Welcome, my friends. I have sent for you this morning to place in your hands a copy of my plan for colonization and to ask your help----                               FIRST NEGRO  Yes, sir----      [_The ebony faces with their cream white teeth showing in smiles     and their wide rolling eyes make a striking contrast to the rugged     face and poise of the President._]                               LINCOLN  Your race is suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people. But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race. On this broad continent, not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours----                               FIRST NEGRO  It's so--yes, it's so----!                               LINCOLN  Go where you are treated best and the ban is still upon you. I cannot alter it if I would. It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated. For the sake of your people you should sacrifice something of your present comfort.                               FIRST NEGRO  Let our great leader show us the way----                               LINCOLN  The Colony of Liberia is an old one, and it is open to you. I am now arranging to open another in Central America. You are intelligent and know that success does not so much depend on external help as on self-reliance. If you will engage in the enterprise I will spend the money Congress has entrusted to me for this purpose. I ask you to consider it seriously, not for yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours for the present time, BUT FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND.                               FIRST NEGRO  We will, sir----!                               LINCOLN  The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of able-bodied men with their wives and children to go at once--men who \"can cut their own fodder\" so to speak----? Take this plan, show it to your people----      [_Hands the document to the First Negro._]  --and find this out for me----                               FIRST NEGRO  We'll do our best----                               THIRD NEGRO      [_Bowing out with religious ecstasy._]  Praise God forever for our Savior-Leader----!      [NICOLAY _ushers out the three Negroes and shows in a stately     black-robed figure in mourning for her dead. She walks quietly to     the President and extends her hand with a gracious smile._]                               THE WOMAN  Perhaps I've done wrong to take up your time----                               LINCOLN  My time belongs to the people, Madam----                               THE WOMAN  I've come to you, Mr. President, under an impulse I could not resist. Mr. Stoddard, your third Secretary, is my friend. He told me this morning that all night the sound of your footfall came from this room. He heard it at nine, at ten, at eleven. At midnight the Secretary of War left the door ajar and the steady tramp came with heavier sound. The last thing he heard at three was the muffled beat upstairs. The guard said it had not stopped at daylight. I saw you staggering alone under a Nation's sorrow and I wondered if you had been given the vision to see the dawn of a new life for our people. I know I'm looking into the eyes of the man whose word can stop this war and divide the Union--I have come to tell you that I lost my first born son at Fredericksburg--a lad of twenty----      [_She pauses and_ LINCOLN _bends and presses her hand._]  May God help you in your trials, Mr. President, as he has helped me in mine----                               LINCOLN      [_Startled._]  You lost your first born at Fredericksburg and come to say this to me?                               THE WOMAN  And I've been praying for you, day and night since----                               LINCOLN      [_Softly._]  Will you say that again, Madam----                               THE WOMAN  I have been praying for you, day and night, and I've come this morning to bring you this message--Be strong and courageous, and God will bring the Nation through!                               LINCOLN  You say this to me--standing beside the grave of your son?                               THE WOMAN  And beside the cot of my other boy of sixteen who was dangerously wounded in General Grant's last battle. I am proud of two such sons to lay on the altar of my country. I _had_ to tell you that I'm praying for you.      [LINCOLN _closes both hands over hers and holds them a moment in     silence._]                               LINCOLN      [_With upward gaze._]  How strange that you should come to me in this black hour with such a message. I've often wondered if the soul of my mother were not speaking to me! The day she died in the woods of Indiana, she told me that if dark hours came, her spirit would be watching, and she'd help me if she could! While you were talking to me--I got the tremor of her voice and the quiver of her lips--how strange!      [_Looking down into her face._]  Thank you, Madam! You have brought me medicine for both body and soul.      [LINCOLN _presses her hand again and she quietly goes as he gazes     after her._]      [NICOLAY _starts to follow her to the door_--LINCOLN _lifts his     hand._]  John, I'm rested now--I'm ready for any work----!                               NICOLAY  The National Committee have just arrived, sir.                               LINCOLN  All right--let them in!      [LINCOLN _resumes his place beside his desk and the Committee     headed by_ HENRY RAYMOND, _Editor of the New York Times, enter and     solemnly range themselves about the President._]      [_To_ HENRY RAYMOND--_taking his hand formally._]  Raymond, this is an unexpected honor you and your Committee do me. I thought you were at your desk in the _Times_ office pouring hot shot into the flanks of our enemies, and the boys were all at home fighting for the victory that must be ours on the first Tuesday in November. Not that you're unwelcome. You are the leaders of public opinion. The people rule this country, and I am their servant--what is it----?                               RAYMOND  You may be sure, Mr. President, that our mission is of the gravest importance. These gentlemen have brought such startling reports from their several states as to the bitterness and closeness of the fight, that they have"]]]
