[K] In the days of Lord Lyndhurst the old Court of Exchequer had equitable as well as common law jurisdiction.     Com[oe]dia Juris       Est omne jus forense quasi com[oe]dia;     Hic advocatus maximas partes agit     Laudatus undique a procuratoribus,     Labore vocis redditus ditissimus;     Cui brevia nil forensis et quaestus valent     Silenter ille spectat, at pro præmio     Fruitur quietus optime com[oe]dia.     Cases     Cases   MYLWARD _v._ WELDON      [The plaintiff was committed to the Fleet Prison on Feb. 8, 1596, by     order of the Lord Keeper, for drawing a replication of sixscore     sheets containing much impertinent matter which might well have been     contained in sixteen. On Feb. 10 the Lord Keeper ordered that on the     following Saturday the Warden of the Fleet should cut a hole through     the replication, and put the plaintiff's head through the hole and     let it hang about his shoulders with the written side outwards, and     lead the plaintiff bareheaded and barefaced round about Westminster     Hall, and show him at the bar of all the courts, and so back to the     Fleet.--Abridged from Spence's _Equitable Jurisdiction_, vol. i. p.     376.]      'Gainst Weldon Mylward files a bill,     But doth his replication fill     With scandalous and idle matter,     That would disgrace the maddest hatter.                         Woe is me for Mylward!      'Twas sixscore sheets, it might have been     Contained, and amply, in sixteen;     So after that the court hath risen     Must Mylward Fleetward go to prison.                         Woe is me for Mylward!      And two days afterwards 'tis meet     That by the Warden of the Fleet     He be led on in slow progression     Through every court that sits in session.                         Woe is me for Mylward!      The pleading writ with words so fair     Must Mylward like a tabard wear,     A hole therein, the Warden cuts it,     A head put through it, Mylward puts it.                         Woe is me for Mylward!      The bar makes merry at his shame;     What careth he? He winneth fame,     Three hundred years his reputation     Hath rested on that replication.                         Woe is me for Mylward!   HAMPDEN _v._ WALSH  (1 Queen's Bench Division, 189)      \"Five hundred pounds as stake I'll lay,\"     Says Hampden, \"that by such a day     No man of science proves to me     That earth not flat but round must be;     The earth is flat, and flats are they.\"     The sum Walsh holds right willingly;     But Wallace by philosophy     Proves roundness, and would take away             Five hundred pounds.      \"Proof me no proofs,\" quoth Hampden, \"Nay,     Let Wallace get it if he may,     I'll sue Walsh for it.\" So sues he.     \"Let Wallace,\" hold the judges three,     \"Take nought, let Walsh to Hampden pay             Five hundred pounds.\"   WILLIS _v._ THE BISHOP OF OXFORD  (2 Probate Division, 192)      Aid me, Muses! my endeavour is to sing a woful song,     How a very learned bishop in the Arches Court went wrong.     Aid me, for _duplex querela_ is an uninviting theme,     And the practice of the Arches raises no poetic dream.     'Tis the Reverend Child Willis, child in name but not in age,     Comes he to the Court of Arches burning with a noble rage,     Filing his _duplex querela_, claiming for himself thereby     Vicarage of Drayton Parslow, or to know the reason why.     \"Reason why?\" the bishop answers; \"that is not so far to seek.     Little Latin have you, Willis, innocent are you of Greek.     You were specially examined by my good Archdeacon Pott;     He reported to me promptly, 'Greek and Latin all forgot,     _Non idoneus_ is Willis, _minus et sufficiens_,     He may have a _sanum corpus_, but he lacks a _sana mens_.'\"     \"Nay,\" says Willis, \"such an answer is but trifling with the court,     I have preached a Latin sermon, and the classics are my forte,     You must name the books I failed in, you must give me every chance     Of a fresh examination at the hands of Lord Penzance.\"     Lord Penzance supported Willis: \"Bishop, you must file,\" said he,     \"Some more tangible objection, some less vague and general plea.     As it stands I cannot gather what it is you ploughed him in,     Whether Hellenistic aorists or the Latin word for sin.\"     But alas! the world has never known as yet what Willis did,     In the breast of the Archdeacon still it lies a secret hid.     Was his Latin prose defective? Did his style of writing show     More resemblance to Tertullian than to Tullius Cicero?     Were his dates a little shaky? Could it, could it be that he     Confidently made Augustine flourish at a date B.C.?     None will know save Pott, Archdeacon, for alas! the patroness     Showed no mercy to Child Willis in the day of his distress.     She revoked the presentation, leaving Willis in the lurch,     One of undisputed learning preached in Drayton Parslow church.     Doubly barren was his triumph, it was not a twelve-month ere     Death set up _his_ Court of Arches, Willis did not triumph there.   DASHWOOD _v._ JERMYN  (12 Chancery Division, 776)      Captain Dashwood, who had been     In the service of the Queen,     Sick of \"Eyes front\" and \"Attention,\"     Came to London on his pension.     At the \"Portland\" as he stayed,     Firm the friendship that he made     With one William Richards, who     Put up at the \"Portland\" too.     Passed six years, then he was wrapped in     Love's embraces, vanquished captain!     \"Yes,\" he cried, \"I will; no bar shall     Stop my wedding Edith Marshall.\"     But there was a bar, 'twas that     He was poorer than a rat;     Indian pensions do not run     More than just enough for one.     Edith, too, had not a cent,     Who would pay the rates and rent?     Two more years, and Richards moved     (He perchance had sometime loved),     Promised them an income clear,     'Twas five hundred pounds a year     For his life; when he was dead,     Then ten thousand pounds instead.     This to Dashwood in a letter     Wrote he, deeming it was better     They should marry soon while he     Lived their happiness to see.     'Twas a modest sum, but marriage     May be blest without a carriage,     Forty pounds a month and more     Keep the wolf from near the door.     So they wed for worse or better,     On the faith of Richards' letter.     Scarcely was a quarter's payment     Due when mourning was their raiment.     Richards died. Alas! no cash would     Find its way to Captain Dashwood.     Dashwood's head began to swim--     Not a shilling left to him!     \"Ha, I'll have it still,\" cried he;     \"Justice dwells in Chancery.\"     So the case was straightway taken     To the court of V.-C. Bacon.     Vainly Dashwood cash expended     The executors defended,     Claiming that what Richards wrote     Was not worth a five-pound note;     First because the dead testator     Well, not wisely, loved the \"cratur,\"     More than that, had often been     In delirium tremens seen;     Secondly, because he signed     When he did not know his mind;     Third, because pollicitation     Is not good consideration.     Law, of justice independent,     Gave its judgment for defendant.     Poorer than he was at first,     That unhappy plaintiff cursed,     With a special satisfaction     Cursed the day he brought his action.     Would that he'd in India tarried!     Would that he had never married!     He, alas, is tied for life     Pauper to a pauper wife,     Scarce consoled that on his name     Equity reports shower fame,     Bearing down to endless ages     Dashwood's story on their pages.   _EX PARTE_ JONES  (18 Chancery Division, 109)      Oh for the wily infant who married the widow and made     Profit of coke and of breeze, and never a penny he paid!     Oh for the Corporation of Birmingham cheated and snared,     Taking orders for coke that the widow and infant prepared!     Oh for the Court of Appeal, and oh for Lords Justices three!     Oh for the Act that infants from contracts may shake themselves free!     Oh for the common law with its store of things old and new!     Birmingham coke is good and good Coke upon Littleton too.   FINLAY _v._ CHIRNEY  (20 Queen's Bench Division, 494)      When love-sick man descends to folly       And gets engaged, he must not stray,     The jury takes the part of Polly,       And if he jilts her, he must pay.      The only way his fault to cover,       From damages and costs to fly,     To leave his jilted lady-lover       Without an action is--to die![L]  [L] The decision was to the effect that in most cases an action for breach of promise of marriage does not survive against the representatives of the promiser.   POLLARD _v._ PHOTOGRAPHIC COMPANY  (40 Chancery Division, 345)      \"Shall I take your photograph, my pretty maid?\"     \"You may if you like, kind sir,\" she said.      \"Do you like your photograph, my pretty maid?\"     \"It is more than flattering, sir,\" she said.      \"I'll publish your photograph, my pretty maid.\"     \"Indeed but you won't, kind sir,\" she said.      \"As a Christmas card, my pretty maid.\"     \"The very idea, kind sir!\" she said.      \"But what if I've done it, my pretty maid?\"     \"I'll get an injunction, sir,\" she said.      \"The law is with you, my pretty maid,\"     The learned judge of the Chancery said.      \"You have proved the negative, my pretty maid,     A difficult thing in law,\" he said.   THE MINNEAPOLIS CASE  (_Tried in Minnesota in 1892_)      Kind reader, tarry here, nor miss     The law of Minneapolis.     There was a carpenter called Brown,     A citizen of that great town,     Who stood his \"inexpressive she\"     A dollar's worth of comedy.     Was it a Gaiety burlesque,     Or labour of Norwegian desk?     Or did they spout in stagey tones     Morality by H. A. Jones?     Or tear romance to rags and set it     In heavy platitudes by Pettit?     I know not,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25281"],["title","Briefless Ballads and Legal Lyrics (#4)"],["body"," it matters not,     The subject I have clean forgot.     Sufficient that the pair did sit     In expectation in the pit,     An expectation not fulfilled,     'Twas otherwise by fortune willed.     Before this loving couple sat     In solitary state a hat--     A hat, I say, for in their wonder     They never noticed what was under,     The wearer must have been a \"human,\"     But might have been a man or woman.     'Twas like a mountain crowned with trees     Amid the pathless Pyrenees,     Or like a garden planned by Paxton,     Or colophon designed by Caxton,     So intricate the work; and flowers     Were trained to climb its soaring towers,     Convolvulus and candytuft,     And 'mid them water-wagtails stuffed.     Such splendour never yet, I wis,     Had shone in Minneapolis.     But Brown was in a sore dilemma,     A dollar he had paid for Emma     To see a play, and not a hat;     A dollar, it was dear at that.     And Emma--disappointment racked her,     She never saw a single actor.     So Brown, with visage thunder-black,     Demanded both his dollars back.     The man who took the cash said, \"Sonny,     Our rule is not to give back money.     But if you'll come another night,     Maybe you'll get a better sight.\"     So Brown went home and nursed his sorrow,     His writ he issued on the morrow.     A hundred dollars was his claim,     And the young lady claimed the same.     The case was argued, on revision     Of pleadings, this was the decision:     \"The theatre's defence is bad,     Brown paid for what he never had,     He paid when in the pit he sat     To see a play and not a hat.     To bring defendants to their senses,     I find for plaintiffs with expenses.\"     _Justitiæ columna sis_,     Wise judge of Minneapolis!   COMMONWEALTH _v._ MARZYNSKI  (21 New England Reports, 228 [Massachusetts, 1893])      [On a complaint for keeping open a tobacconist's shop on Sunday,     contrary to the law of Massachusetts, it was held that the court     will take judicial notice that tobacco and cigars are not drugs and     medicines, and will exclude the testimony of a witness who offers     evidence that they are.]      Against the statutes of the Old Bay State       Marzynski on a Sunday stood behind       His counter, well content his gain to find       In pipes not pills, cigars not carbonate.     From breakfast till 'twas dusk at half-past eight       Tobacco cheered this hardened sinner's mind,       The price of it his pockets, disinclined       To add their dime to the collection plate.     The State Attorney claimed the penalty;       \"Cigars are no cigars,\" said the defence,       \"But drugs, and we have witnesses to prove it.\"     \"Cigars to be cigars judicially       We notice, and reject the evidence.\"       So said the Court, and spat, and nought could move it.

So say old saws, my own in aid I crave;     Woe to the court whose judge once spake for fees,     Though he were readier than Isocrates!     An advocate that pleaded once for pelf     Scarce on the bench forgets his former self.                                    _Palladas._   XI. 75      This Olympicus of old     Had, Sebastus, I am told     Quite his share of upper gear,     Nose and chin and eye and ear.     All he lost, and by his fist--     He became a pugilist.     Loss of members with it drew     Loss of patrimony too.     When his birthright he would claim,     Into court his brother came     With a portrait, saying, \"Thus     Looked the old Olympicus.\"     None could any likeness see,     Disinherited was he.                                    _Lucillus._   XI. 141      A pig, a goat, an ox I lost:     I want them back at any cost,     And so retained, O woful fate!     Menecles for my advocate.     But tell me, will you, what have these     In common with Othryades?     The heroes of Thermopylæ     Have nought to do with theft from me.     Against Eutychides I bring     My action for a trivial thing.     Let Xerxes rest a little space,     And leave the Spartans in their place.     For if you don't put all this by     I'll go into the streets and cry,     \"The voice of Menecles is big,     But what about my stolen pig?\"                                    _Lucillus._      [This Epigram is probably an imitation of that of Martial, on p.     90.]   XI. 143      Pluto rejected at his gate     The soul of Mark the advocate;     \"No, Cerberus my dog,\" quoth he,     \"Will make you pleasant company;     But if within you needs must go,     Practise on poet Melito,     And you shall have, if he won't do,     Tityus and Ixion too.

Said plaintiff, \"Sir, I ask for five months' rent.\"     Defendant, \"Grinding corn all night I spent.\"     \"Why,\" quoth the judge, \"dispute? Your mother's claim     Is good, and you must both support the dame.\"                                    _Nicarchus._   XI. 350      Remember justice and her yoke, and know     That 'gainst the wicked votes of \"Guilty\" go.     Thou trustest in thy cunning speech, thy power     Of speaking words that vary with the hour.     Hope what thou wilt, thy trifling tricks are vain,     Thou canst not make the path of law less plain.                                    _Agathias._   XI. 376      Once to Diodorus came a client in a state of doubt,     And to that most learned counsel thus he set the matter out:     \"Alpha Beta found a slave-girl who had run away from me:     To a slave of his he wed her, though she was my property,     Well he knew she was my chattel; she has had a child or two;     Now I cannot tell for certain whose the children are, can you?\"     Diodorus thought, consulted all authorities on \"Slave,\"     To his client turned his furrowed brows and slowly answer gave:     \"'Tis to you or to the other who, you say, has done you wrong,     That the children of the handmaid rightfully of course belong,     Your best plan will be the matter in the proper court to place,     So you'll get a good opinion whether you have any case.\"                                    _Agathias._   PLAN, 193      \"Good Hermes, only just one cabbage plant.\"     \"Stop, stop, my thieving traveller, you can't.\"     \"What, grudge me one poor cabbage! is it so?\"     \"Nay, I don't grudge it, but the law says no.

I claim that by my neighbour's theft     Of she-goats three I was bereft.     The judge of course wants evidence,     But you go wandering far from thence,     And with a mighty voice declaim     Of Mithridates and the shame     Of Cannæ, and the lies of old     That Punic politicians told.     And why should you pass Sylla by,     The Marii and Mucii?
