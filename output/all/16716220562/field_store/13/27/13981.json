At the time of Harry's arrival it had less than half that number. The country bordering the river is not particularly inviting, but it was new, and the two boys regarded it with interest. The soil was barren and sandy, and the trees, which were numerous, were eucalyptus or gum trees, which do not require a rich soil, but grow with great rapidity on sterile soil.  \"What peculiar leaves?\" said Harry, \"they look like leather.\"  \"True,\" said the professor, \"and you notice that instead of having one surface toward the sky and the other toward the earth they are placed edgewise.\"  Soon they reached the mouth of the river, and there, just beyond the bar, rode the good ship _Arcturus_, on which the professor was to sail for Boston. His baggage was hoisted on board, and then the professor himself followed.  \"Will you come on board, boys?\" he asked.  \"No, sir; we will go back by the lighter.\"  \"Then good-by, and God bless you and bring you good luck.\"  Harry could not help feeling sober as he bade farewell to his good friend, the professor.  \"I have only you now, Jack,\" he said. \"I don't know what lies before us, but we must stick fast to each other in sunshine and in storm.\"  Jack's only answer was to seize Harry's hand and press it warmly. Nothing more was needed.     CHAPTER II.  PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.  The two boys returned to the Crown Hotel in time for dinner, of which they partook with the zest to be expected of boys thoroughly healthy. When the meal was over they repaired to the public room.  \"Now, Jack,\" said Harry, \"it is necessary for us to settle on our plans.\"  \"All right,\" said Jack.  \"Have you anything to propose?\"  \"No, Harry, you are smarter than I am, and I leave it to you.\"  \"Thank you, Jack, for your confidence, but we are on a par here. Neither of us knows much about Australia. We have a great deal to learn.\"  \"Then you had better decide for us both.\"  \"Very well, I accept the responsibility, but I prefer to talk over my plans with you. First of all, then, shall we stay in Melbourne, or strike for the mines?\"  \"Just as you say, Harry, but I would prefer the mines.\"  \"I feel that way myself, and for that reason I have been making some inquiries. There are three principal localities, Ballarat, Bendigo, and Ovens. We might try one of the three, and if we don't have good luck make our-way to another.\"  \"Which shall we try first?\"  \"I have thought of Bendigo. I hear of one party that cleared two thousand pounds out of one hole.\"  \"How much is that?\" asked Jack, who was not very well acquainted with any but United States currency.  \"It is equal to ten thousand dollars,\" answered Harry.  \"That's a big pile of money,\" said Jack, his eyes sparkling.  \"True, but we mustn't expect to be so fortunate. It isn't everybody who succeeds as well as that.\"  \"I should be satisfied with a thousand, Harry.\"  \"And what would you do with it, Jack?\"  \"Convey it home to my mother, Harry. But I would fix it so that my step-father couldn't get hold of it.\"  \"You are a good boy, Jack, for thinking so much of your mother. I wish I had a mother to provide for,\" and Harry Vane looked sober.  \"Do you know how far off Bendigo is, Harry?\"  \"About a hundred miles. That is, it is seventy-five miles to Mount Alexander, and the mines are twenty-five miles to the north of that.\"  \"It won't take us long to travel a hundred miles,\" said Jack hopefully.  \"On the contrary, it will be a long and difficult journey, as far as I can find out. The country is full of bogs, swamps, and moist land.\"  \"Then we can't walk?\"  \"No; the custom is to charter a cart, drawn by oxen, which will give a chance to carry a stock of provisions. The roads are not very well marked, and are often impassable.\"  This description rather discouraged Jack, who was more used to the sea and its dangers than to land travel.  \"I wish we could go by water,\" he said.  \"So do I, Jack, but unfortunately Bendigo happens to be inland. However, you've got good stout legs, and can get along as well as the thousands that do go. Besides, it will give us a fine chance to see the country.\"  \"Ye-es,\" said Jack doubtfully, for he had very little of the traveller's curiosity that prompts so many to visit strange lands.  \"There's another difficulty besides the mud,\" continued Harry thoughtfully.  \"What's that?\"  \"The bushrangers.\"  \"Who are they?\"  \"Haven't you heard of them?\" asked Harry in surprise.  \"I heard two men speaking of them last night, but I didn't take much notice.\"  \"They are highwaymen--robbers, who wander about and attack parties of miners and travellers, and unless successfully resisted, strip them of all their property.\"  \"Are we likely to meet them?\" said Jack eagerly.  \"I hope not; but we stand a chance of doing so.\"  \"When are we going to start?\" asked Jack with alacrity.  \"Do you want to meet these gentlemen, Jack?\" inquired Harry with a smile.  \"There'll be some fun about it,\" responded Jack.  Harry shrugged his shoulders.  \"I don't think there'll be much fun about being robbed,\" he said. \"I would rather they would give us a wide berth, for my part.\"  Jack did not answer, but from that time he was eager to set out for the mines. The hint of danger invested the journey with a charm it had not hitherto possessed in his eyes.  While the boys were conversing, a tall man, with heavy black whiskers and wearing a rough suit and a slouch hat, appeared to listen attentively. At this point he rose from his seat, and lounged over to where Harry and Jack were seated.  \"Young gentlemen,\" he said, \"do I understand that you are thinking of going to the mines?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Harry, surveying his inquirer with some attention.  \"And you talk of going to Bendigo?\"  \"Yes; do you know anything about the place?\"  \"I ought to. I only came from there last month.\"  \"What luck did you have there, may I ask?\"  \"Pretty fair. I brought back about a hundred and fifty pounds in gold dust:\"  \"And how long were you there?\"  \"Four weeks.\"  \"That is pretty good pay for the time.\"  \"That's so, especially as I made little or nothing the first three weeks. I struck it rich the last week.\"  \"What do you say to that, Jack?\" said Harry, turning to his companion; \"nearly eight hundred dollars in a month.\"  \"That pays better than being a sailor,\" answered Jack, smiling.  \"I should say it did.\"  \"When do you expect to start?\" asked the stranger.  \"As soon as we can get ready,\" Harry replied.  \"You are right there. Have you got money?\"  \"Why?\" asked Harry rather suspiciously.  \"It will cost something for an outfit.\"  \"Yes; we have a moderate sum with us.\"  \"That is well,\" said the stranger approvingly. \"Do you know,\" he continued meditatively, \"I have a great mind to go with you?\"  \"Then you are not satisfied with your pile?\" said Harry.  \"There's very little left of it,\" said their new acquaintance.  \"You haven't spent a hundred and fifty pounds in a month?\" said Harry in surprise.  \"Pretty much. I may have twenty pounds left.\"  \"You must have been living high, then.\"  \"No. I have lived plainly, but the faro table has taken most of it. I'm so near broke that I may as well go back to the mines for a fresh supply before my money is all gone.\"  \"We shall be glad of your company, sir. May I ask if you are an Australian?\"  \"I was born in England, but I have been out here half a dozen years.\"  \"And have not made your fortune yet?\"  \"It is my own fault. I have been unable to keep money after I got it.\"  \"We are from America.\"  \"I surmised it,\" said the stranger. \"That is a country I want to visit before I die. You have mines there, too.\"  \"Yes, but they are a long way from where we live.\"  \"My name is Fletcher--Dick Fletcher my friends call me.\"  \"I am Harry Vane, and my friend is Jack Pendleton.\"  \"We will drink to our better acquaintance. Here, John,\" addressing the barkeeper, \"three glasses of ale here.\"  \"If you won't mind, Jack and I will take sarsaparilla.\"  Fletcher stared at them in amazement.  \"You don't drink ale?\" he said.  \"We belong to the temperance society,\" said Harry, smiling.  \"You won't keep that up long at the mines,\" said Fletcher, shrugging his shoulders.  Harry did not reply, but quietly resolved that he would disprove that statement.     CHAPTER III.  FLETCHER ACTS SUSPICIOUSLY.  One circumstance led Harry to hurry his intended departure. He found to his dismay that the hotel charge for their very plain accommodations was a pound a day for each of them. The Crown inn was what would be called in an American city a one-horse hotel. There are plenty such to be found in the United States where the rate charged is but a dollar a day. But Melbourne was full of strangers, drawn thither by flaming accounts of the richness of the mines and the bright prospects of acquiring sudden fortunes, and war prices were prevalent everywhere.  \"Five dollars a day!\" exclaimed Jack in open-eyed amazement. \"Do they take us for millionaires?\"  \"I began to think they were imposing upon us,\" said Harry, \"till I made inquiries elsewhere. I find a pound a day is about the usual tariff for such accommodations as we have.\"  \"But we have only a small bedroom, and the meals are very common.\"  \"That is true, but it seems to make no difference.\"  \"Our money will soon be gone at that rate,\" said Jack soberly. \"Mine is already gone.\"  \"No, it isn't, Jack. We are going to share and share alike, you know.\"  \"But that is imposing on you, Harry,\" protested the young sailor earnestly.  \"Let me judge of that, Jack; I'd a good deal rather have your company and half of the money than be alone and have the whole.\"  \"Thank you, Harry. You are a true friend. I can't do much for you, but I'll do what I can.\"  \"If I had known of the high prices, I would have drawn more money from the professor,\" continued Harry. \"However, I can make this do. But I want to start to-morrow, if possible. We shall then be owing four days' board each, and that will make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26111"],["title","In A New World; or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia (#2)"],["body","dollars.\"  At this point Fletcher joined them.  \"By the way,\" said he nonchalantly, \"I want to ask a little favor.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Harry unsuspiciously.  \"I am rather short of money. Can you lend me five pounds?\"  Jack looked at Harry in alarm. He was afraid Harry would grant the favor, knowing his obliging disposition. But he didn't know our hero. Harry was ready to do anything for a near friend, but he was too prudent to waste his money on acquaintances who had no sort of claim on him.  \"I am sorry to refuse, Mr. Fletcher,\" he said, \"but Jack and I are ourselves very poorly provided with money, and just before you came in we were considering how we could manage to pay for the necessary outfit.\"  \"Haven't you got five pounds?\" asked Fletcher quickly.  \"Of course we have, or we should be unable to get to the mines.\"  \"Then I think you might oblige me,\" he continued, looking very much displeased.  \"I am the best judge of my circumstances,\" said Harry shortly.  Fletcher looked hard at him, and saw that the boy he had to deal with had a mind of his own, and was not to be imposed upon easily. Still he made a farther effort.  \"Then I think,\" he said coldly, \"I shall not be able to assist you in your preparations.\"  \"Just as you please,\" answered Harry promptly. \"As you volunteered, I accepted your proposal. Now I will act for myself. I have heard of a party about to start, and I will arrange to join it.\"  Fletcher felt that he was outgeneralled. He did not mean to let Harry and Jack slip through his fingers, for he had an idea, notwithstanding Harry's disclaimer, that he had a large sum of money, and thought he would be a good party to hang on to. He saw that he had made a false move, and hastened to repair it.  \"Excuse me,\" he said, assuming a hearty tone; \"I was hasty, and I apologize. You are right, and I like you too well to cut up rough, just because you can't do me a favor. There, take my hand, and we will make it all up.\"  \"With pleasure,\" answered Harry, as he accepted the proffered hand, and Jack followed his example. Nevertheless Fletcher's demand had produced an unpleasant effect upon him. The coarse-grained selfishness of the man had shown through his outward varnish of good-fellowship, and he felt that henceforth he must be on his guard.  \"I may have to ask for some money, however,\" continued Fletcher, in an off-hand manner, \"for it is necessary to buy supplies for our journey. You know we shan't be able to put up at hotels on our way, but must furnish our own meals.\"  \"So I have heard,\" answered Harry. \"What is it customary to take?\"  \"Well, it will be best to buy a bag of coffee, a sack of flour, some ship biscuits, potatoes, and sugar. That will do to start on, and we shall vary our diet by what we are able to kill on the way.\"  \"What can we kill?\"  \"Well, kangaroo meat isn't bad, and we can bring down a few birds occasionally.\"  \"Then we shall need guns?\"  \"Yes, it will be well to have them.\"  This was another expense upon which Harry had not calculated. He began to think that he had been very improvident. The professor would readily have left him a hundred dollars more, and as it would have been repaid with his own money, he was sorry he had not availed himself of it.  \"How much do you think the supplies will cost?\" asked Harry.  \"Well, you had better let me have ten pounds. I think that will be sufficient.\"  \"For the whole or for our share?\" asked Harry pointedly.  \"For your share,\" answered Fletcher after a pause. \"It seems to me you are very suspicious.\"  Really he had intended to make the two boys pay for the whole stock of provisions and save his own purse, for he had in reality as much money as they.  \"I only wanted to understand clearly,\" said Harry quietly. \"As we are in some sort partners, that is fair, is it not?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" returned Fletcher, but he did not respond with any alacrity. \"I'm always fair and above board, I am. No man can say that Dick Fletcher ever tried to get the best of him. Why, if I was better fixed I wouldn't let you two boys pay a cent. I'd shoulder the whole thing myself.\"  \"Your offer is a very kind one, Mr. Fletcher----\"  \"Don't say Mr. Fletcher; call me Dick,\" interrupted their new acquaintance.  \"I will if you wish it, though as you are so much older, it hardly seems proper. What I was going to say was that Jack and myself are determined to pay our share. We couldn't accept any such favor as you mention.\"  \"That's all right. Now, if you let me have the ten pounds I'll take all the trouble off your hands, and have everything ready for a start to-morrow morning.\"  \"I would prefer to go with you and help select the articles.\"  Fletcher looked disconcerted.  \"Oh, well, if you think I aint capable----\" he began.  \"I think nothing of the kind, but I want to learn as much as I can. I may have to do it alone some time.\"  It was well Harry adhered to his determination. It saved him three pounds, and Fletcher was forced to pay his share, as he had not intended to do. While they were making purchases they were accosted by a tall loose-jointed man, whom it was easy to recognize as a Yankee.  \"Goin' to the mines, boys?\" he asked in a strong nasal tone.  \"Yes,\" answered Harry.  \"So am I. I'd like to hook on to your party if you aint no objections.\"  For some reason Dick Fletcher did not appear to relish the proposal.  \"I don't think we can accommodate you,\" he said abruptly.  \"I think we can,\" said Harry, who was beginning to be distrustful of Fletcher, and felt safer in adding another to the party. \"There are but three of us, and we shall be glad of your company.\"  Dick Fletcher looked angry, but did not venture to oppose the plan further.     CHAPTER IV.  A TIMELY RESCUE.  On the last evening spent in Melbourne the boys decided to take a farewell walk about the city, not knowing when it would again be their fortune to see it. Neither Fletcher nor their new Yankee acquaintance was at hand, and they started by themselves. They did not confine themselves to the more frequented streets, but followed wherever fancy led.  They had no thought of an adventure, but one awaited them.  As they were turning the corner of a narrow street, their attention was suddenly excited by a sharp cry of blended surprise and fright.  \"What is it, Jack?\" asked Harry, grasping his companion by the arm.  He did not need to await a reply, for by the indistinct light he saw two men struggling a few rods further on. One appeared to be an old man, with white hair, the other was a man of middle age. Clearly it was a case of attempted robbery.  \"Run, Jack, run!\" said Harry, in excitement. \"Let us help the old man!\"  \"I'm with you,\" answered the young sailor briefly.  Harry had in his hand a heavy cane--his only weapon--but he did not stop to consider the personal risk he was running. As he drew near, the old man, whose feeble strength was quite unequal to a conflict with a man so much younger, swayed and fell backward. His assailant bent over him, and despite his feeble resistance began to search his pockets, at the same time indulging in savage threats. The old man gave himself up for lost, but help was nearer than he anticipated.  So occupied was the villain with his disgraceful work that he did not hear the approaching footsteps.  His first intimation of them came in a sounding blow over his shoulders, given by Harry's stick, which was laid on with a good will.  He jumped to his feet with an oath, and darted a rapid glance at his two assailants. Then, much to the surprise of Harry, he turned and ran rapidly away. It was a piece of great good luck, Harry thought, for he was not at all sure that he and Jack combined would have been a match for the highwayman.  \"Are you hurt, sir?\" asked Harry, bending over the old man.  \"Not seriously,\" was the reply. \"Will you kindly help me up?\"  With Jack's help Harry got the old man on his feet. He was a tall man, of splendid aspect, over sixty years of age. He looked like a gentleman of wealth and position.  \"You have had a narrow escape, sir,\" said our hero.  \"Yes, indeed,\" answered the old man, \"thanks to your brave interference. It surprises me that my brutal assailant should have run away from two boys.\"  \"I am surprised also, sir. I feared we should have a hard fight. I suppose his object was robbery.\"  \"Yes, he must have heard in some way that I had a large sum of money about me. Thanks to you, it is safe.\"  \"I am very glad, sir.\"  \"Do you mind accompanying me to my house? This attack has made me timid.\"  \"With pleasure, sir.\"  The old gentleman lived perhaps a quarter of a mile distant in a handsome house. He pressed the boys to enter, and they did so. He questioned them as to their plans, and then selecting two bank-notes of large denomination, urged the boys to accept them as a recognition of the help they had given him at a critical moment. The boys, however, declined positively to accept any compensation, but expressed their satisfaction at having been of service.  \"At least,\" said the old gentleman, \"you must promise to call on me when you return from the mines. There is my card.\"  \"That we will do with pleasure, sir,\" answered Harry.  He looked at the card, and read the name of Henry A. Woolson.  \"Harry,\" said Jack, as they resumed their walk, \"do you know that robber had a look like Fletcher?\"  \"So I thought, Jack, but I had only a glimpse, and could not be sure. I wish he were not to be in our party.\"  \"We must be on our guard; I don't fancy him much.\"  When the boys saw Fletcher in the morning he appeared as usual, and they were disposed to think they were mistaken. Yet the lurking suspicion occurred to them from time to time, and made them feel uneasy.  The next day they set out on their journey, accompanied by Dick Fletcher and Obed Stackpole.     CHAPTER V.  STARTING FOR THE MINES.  Harry may be considered rash in his immediate acceptance of his Yankee acquaintance as a member of their party, but there are some men who need no letters"]]]
