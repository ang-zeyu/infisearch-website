They are washed, too. Then after all the skins have been washed and softened they are thrown into lime and are left there until the fibre swells and the hair is loosened. The men you see with rubber gloves on are the limers. If they did not wear gloves they would get their hands burned and raw, for the lime and the chemicals used in the tan often make the hands and arms very sore.\"  \"But I don't see that the skins that are tossed into the lime pits come out with the hair off,\" objected Peter.  \"Bless your heart--the lime does not take the hair off. The men who unhair them have to do that. They lay the wet skins out on boards and with sharp knives pull and scrape off all the white hair.\"  \"Why don't they take off the brown or black hair as well?\"  \"Because only the white hair is removed by hand. That is kept separate and after being dried is sold to dealers for a good price. The colored hair is taken off by machinery and is sold too, but it is not so valuable.\"  \"I suppose plasterers can use hair like that,\" speculated Peter.  \"Yes, and upholsterers,\" added Jackson.  Peter smiled.  \"Carmachel told me nothing in a tannery was wasted,\" he said. \"I was surprised to find that even the lumps of fat and bits of flesh adhering to the skins, together with the parings that came off when the calfskins were trimmed down to an even thickness, were disposed of for glue stock or fertilizer.\"  \"Every scrap of stuff is used, I can tell you!\" assented Jackson. \"Calfskin, you know, is never split; it is not heavy enough for that. Besides it is more nearly uniform in weight than a skin like a bull's hide, for instance, which is very much heavier about the head. No, calfskin is fairly even and therefore, while wet, is just put between rollers where a thin, sharp blade shaves from the flesh side any part of it that is thicker than any other. It comes out of equal thickness all over. Do you understand?\"  Peter nodded.  \"And now have you this beamhouse process straight in your head so we can go on?\"  Jackson held up his hand and began to check off the successive steps on his fingers:  \"The skins are washed until the dirt and salt are out; they are worked in paddle-wheels, if necessary, until soft; they are limed; unhaired; and bated, or puered. By puering I mean that they are put through a liquid that takes out all the lime; if the lime is not carefully soaked out the skins will be burned and hard and cannot be tanned properly. After the puering the short-hairers remove any remaining hairs; the skins are thoroughly washed again, and at last are ready for tanning.\"  \"How are they tanned?\"  \"Why, by putting them into paddle-wheels filled with the tanning solution where they revolve as many as seven or eight hours. This solution is then changed for a weaker one, and they revolve again for a couple of hours more. Some skins are tanned in a mixture of chemicals which we buy all prepared; we call those chrome tanned. Others are soaked in a vegetable tan of hemlock, oak, chestnut, palmetto roots, gambier, or quebracho.\"  \"Or what?\"  \"Quebracho!\" Jackson rolled out the long word with a gusto. \"Quebracho is a tree something like the lignum-vit√¶ and grows in South America. The hardened gum comes in barrels and looks like rosin; sometimes, instead of being hard, it is shipped in a liquid state in big tank cars. There is about fifteen per cent. of tannin in quebracho and at the tanneries it can be diluted, of course, to any strength desired. We use it altogether here instead of using other vegetable tans.\"  \"But it says in my geography that every one uses oak or hemlock bark,\" objected Peter, sceptically.  \"Well, the Coddington Company doesn't. Bryant says we tan so much leather here that there would be no way of disposing of the quantities of bark left after the tannin had been extracted from it. Besides bark is scarce and expensive; then, too, it takes a car-load of bark to get even a decent amount of tannin and the freighting adds to the cost. Quebracho can be shipped by water and is therefore more economical, and for the varieties of leather we tan here it answers the purpose as well. It is lots of work to get the tannin out of oak or hemlock bark. The bark has to be ground up and put in a leaching-kettle full of water; after it has boiled the liquid is drained off and the tannin extracted. Using quebracho is a much simpler method. Of course we use oak and hemlock bark, though, in the sole leather tanneries over at Elmwood.\"  Peter regarded Jackson intently.  \"How did you come to know so much about all this business?\" he asked at last.  \"Oh, I don't know much,\" was the modest answer. \"I just wanted to learn what I could while I had the chance. You can't help being curious when you work so long in one room. Bryant saw I was interested and he's explained all the things I wanted to find out.\"  \"Then maybe you'll pass on some more of your information,\" laughed Peter, \"and tell me why some of the skins are tanned in quebracho and some in chrome.\"  \"As I told you,\" repeated Jackson good-naturedly, \"quebracho is a vegetable tan and chrome a chemical tan. The effect of each of these processes on the skins is different; so the process used depends on what sort of leather is wanted. At many tanneries chrome is used almost entirely for tanning calfskins because the process is so much quicker; chrome takes but about nine hours while quebracho tanning takes two weeks or thereabouts.\"  \"I see. And after the tanning?\"  \"The skins are inspected while wet and sorted for stock; they are then stamped with a letter or number so they can be identified; they are fat-liquored, and are dyed.\"  \"What is fat-liquored?\"  \"Fat-liquored means working the skins about in a mixture of soap and oil until they absorb these softening ingredients and become pliable. All leather, whether chrome or vegetable tanned, has to go through this process. The liquid is put into paddle-wheels just as the tanning mixture is. The dyeing is done in paddle-wheels too, and some kinds of leather have in addition a coat of dye rubbed into them by hand. It gives them a better surface.\"  \"What is your work, Jackson?\" asked Peter.  \"Oh, I've done about everything there is to do in a beamhouse. Just now I am inspecting and sorting the skins after they are tanned.\"  \"What is Mr. Bryant going to set me at?\"  \"I don't know. You will have to ask him. But no matter what he gives you to do you must not be discouraged, Strong. You were lucky to get any job at all in the tannery. They have turned away lots of boys your age--they do it every day.\"  Peter bit his lip to keep from smiling.  \"I suppose I ought to consider myself lucky,\" replied he.  \"Well, aren't you? To be young, and well, and to know that if you do your best you have a chance to work up to something better? I think it's great! I intend to work up. Some day I may be a partner in Coddingtons'--who knows! Then I'll dress my mother in silk every day in the week and I'll buy an automobile. I'd like to ride in one of those things just once. Did you ever?\"  \"Yes,\" admitted Peter cautiously.  \"Honest? Wasn't it bully? Where did you go?\"  But Peter was spared the difficult task of replying. Instead, Bryant summoned him, and he was given a wheel-barrow filled with wet skins which were to be carried from the soaking vats to the lime pits. All the rest of the morning back and forth he trudged wheeling load after load. It was stupid, dirty work, and he was glad when the noon whistle blew.  \"Let's eat our luncheon together, Strong,\" said Jackson, \"that is--unless you have somebody else you want to lunch with.\"  Peter assented only too gladly. It was far pleasanter to have a boy his own age to speak to than to eat by himself. Besides he liked Jackson.  But even in the fresh breeze that swept the open field, even while playing ball, even at home after a hot bath and clean clothing, Peter could still scent the odor of the beamhouse. It was days before he became accustomed to it and could feel, with Nat Jackson, that he was a lucky boy to have a \"job.\"     [Illustration]  CHAPTER IV  PETER'S MAIDEN SPEECH   Peter had been three weeks in the beamhouse and had in that time proved himself so useful that his pay had been raised from six to six dollars and a half a week. Very proud he was of his financial good fortune. With few demands in the way of clothing he was now able to lay aside quite a little sum toward the motorcycle he so much desired. The days at the tannery passed more quickly. Nat Jackson became his chum and the two lads were almost inseparable; they lunched together, played on the ball team, and often spent their Saturday afternoons in taking long walks or going to Nat's house. Peter, however, took great good care that Nat should not visit him.  The omission of this hospitality was not entirely unnoticed by young Jackson, and the conclusion he drew was that Peter lived humbly--perhaps poorly--in lodgings to which he did not consider it suitable to invite a guest. Nat thought this foolish pride on Peter's part and he meant to tell him so some time when they became better acquainted. It was a mistake, argued Nat, to be over-sensitive about one's poverty. If Peter was saving his money surely that was excuse enough. He had a right to live as he pleased. Furthermore what possible difference could it make in their friendship? Nat himself lived simply but very nicely on the meager salary that he earned. He and his mother rented two tiny bedrooms, a sunny little living-room, and a microscopic kitchen in a part of the town which, to be sure, was cheap and ugly; but Mrs. Jackson, Peter soon found, was one of the rare women who could make a home--a real home--almost anywhere. She often laughingly remarked that if she were to dwell in a snow hovel at the North Pole she believed she should cut a window in the side of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],["title","The Story of Leather (#6)"],["body"," and set a pot of flowers there, and Peter could well imagine her doing it.  She was a short, bright-eyed, motherly little person, with a quick appreciation of a joke, and a wonderful knack at cooking. Incidentally she had a quiet voice and chose soft colors in preference to crude ones. Peter gathered from her manner of speech and from the delicate modeling of her hands that at some time in her life she had occupied a very different position from the one she was now filling. But whatever that past might have been he gained no inkling of it either from her or from her son. Bravely, patiently, happily, she made a home for her boy--such a home that Peter Coddington visited it with the keenest pleasure and came away with a vague wonder what it was that those three wee rooms possessed which was lacking in his own richly furnished mansion.  Perhaps if it had not been for the encouragement of Nat and his mother Peter might not have had the grit to master his work at the beamhouse. A wholesome spur these two friends were to his flagging spirits. There was some subtle quality in Nat's mother that made a fellow want to do his very best--to be as much of a man as he could. And yet she said little to urge either of the lads to their task. It was just that she was so proud and so pleased when they did win any good fortune through their own endeavors. And so Peter forged bravely on, prodded by an unformulated desire to do well not only for the sake of his own parents, but that he might not disappoint the faith that Nat and Nat's mother had in him.  Even Mr. Coddington remarked one evening at dinner (and there was a twinkle in his eye when he said it) that he was highly gratified by the reports he heard of \"young Strong.\"  But as the summer advanced and the days grew hotter Mrs. Coddington watched her boy with anxious care and dropped more than one suggestion that it was time they all were off to the shore. None of her suggestions bore fruit, however, and by and by when she saw that Mr. Coddington had no intention of leaving Milburn she ceased to remonstrate further and Peter settled down to work and to keep as comfortable as he could during the hot weather. What a haven his home, with its green lawns and wide verandas, became, after those long, breathless hours in the tannery! Never before had he half appreciated his surroundings. Most of the houses where the men at the factory lived were huddled closely in that dingy part of the town where Nat Jackson's rooms were, and Peter soon discovered that after supper many of the workmen and their families came and sat in the ball field opposite Factory 1 where there was more air, and where some of the men actually slept when the nights were very hot. It was a blessing--that great open space! Peter wondered what they would have done without it.  He had been raising the query mentally one July morning on his way to work after a close, restless night in his big room on the hill. The day was a sultry one; no air stirred, and it was with a sigh that Peter entered the beamhouse. No sooner was he inside, however, than he at once saw that something was wrong. Knots of men were speaking together in undertones and seemed to be far more eager to talk than to take up their daily tasks. Only Bryant, who moved from one group to another, urging, coaxing, commanding, succeeded in compelling them to attend to what they had to do.  \"You fellows can do all the talking you want to at noon,\" he said. \"There will be no builders around to-day, I guess.\"  \"They'll do well to keep away!\" muttered an angry Swede, threateningly.  \"You go to unhairing skins, Olsen,\" Bryant commanded, putting his hand firmly but kindly on the broad shoulder of the man. \"You can scold your wrath all out this noon. Go on.\"  Sullenly the man obeyed.  \"What is the matter?\" Peter managed to whisper to Nat Jackson.  \"The men are furious; they are threatening to strike,\" returned Nat in an undertone.  \"To strike!\" exclaimed Peter. His thoughts flew to his father. \"What has happened?\" he questioned insistently.  \"Didn't you see last night's paper? Haven't you heard? Mr. Coddington is going to put up another tannery. He's going to build it on the ball field!\"  \"On the ball field! Our field!\"  \"So the paper says. Of course the land is his. But it does seem pretty tough!\"  Peter moved on, dazed.  To take away the field--the one out-of-door spot for luncheon and exercise! To deprive hundreds of stifled creatures of fresh air and sunlight! It was monstrous! Why hadn't his father mentioned the plan? Of course he did not realize what it would mean to the men or he never would have considered it. What would become of all those tired people who nightly left their bare little dwellings and sought a cool evening breeze in the field? Peter knew Nat and his mother always sat there until bedtime and many of the other workmen brought their wives and children. Once the boy had sat there himself. It was an orderly crowd that he had seen--children tumbling over each other on the grass; women seated on the benches and exchanging a bit of gossip; tired men stretched full-length on the turf resting in the quiet of the place.  Why, it was a crime to take the field away!  All the morning while he worked Peter's mind seethed with arguments against the building of the new factory. He longed to see his father and talk it out. Surely Mr. Coddington would listen if he realized the conditions. He was a kind man--not an inhuman brute. It seemed as if the noon whistle would never blow.  With Nat Jackson and a score of agitated workmen Peter went out into the shade opposite. Luncheon was forgotten, and ball, too. Instead a crowd gathered and on every hand there were mutterings and angry protests.  \"Of course Coddington can take the land. It's his. There is no law to prevent him from doing anything he wants to with it. What does he care for us?\" remarked an old, gray-haired tanner.  \"The working man is nothing to the rich man,\" grumbled another. \"All the millionaire wants is more money. Another factory means just that--more money! It's money, money, money--always money with the rich. The more they have the more they want.\"  Sick at heart, Peter listened.  \"Why don't you fellows do something about it?\" blustered a red-faced Italian. \"I'll bet you if we called a strike it would bring Coddington to terms. He'd a good sight rather give up building that factory than have us all walk out--'specially now when there's more work ahead than the firm can handle. I've been in five strikes in other places and we never failed yet to get what we started for.\"  \"Do you think you could drive a man like Mr. Coddington that way?\" It was Carmachel who spoke. \"You can walk out, all of you, if you choose. It would make no difference to him. If he has decided it is best to put up that tannery he'll put it up. A strike would do you no good and as a result your families would be without food and a roof over their heads all winter. You're a fine man, Ristori! Coddington pays you well. You take his money and are glad to get a job from him; then the first minute anything does not go to suit you you turn against him and cry: Strike! You don't know what loyalty means. Hasn't Coddington always been square with you? Hasn't he paid you good wages? Hasn't he added an extra bit to your envelope at Christmas? I'll not strike!\"  \"What would you have us do?\" was Ristori's hot retort. \"Would you have us sit by like dumb things and let him do anything to us he pleases?\"  \"Coddington is a reasonable man,\" Carmachel replied. \"Why don't some of you talk decently with him about all this?\"  \"Aye! And lose our jobs for our pains!\" sneered a swarthy Armenian.  A shout went up.  \"A strike! A strike!\" yelled a hundred voices.  \"Would you strike and see your families starve?\" cried Nat Jackson. \"I have a mother to support. I care more for her than for the field and everything on it. I shall not strike.\"  \"You white-livered young idiot!\" roared some one in the crowd.  \"I tell you, men,\" went on Carmachel, \"there is nothing to be gained by striking. Get together some of your best speakers from each factory and let them ask an interview of Mr. Coddington--now--this afternoon--before anything more is done about the new factory.\"  \"He'll not grant it!\"  \"Hasn't he always been fair with you?\"  \"Yes!\"  \"Aye!\"  \"So he has!\"  \"He has that!\"  Grudgingly the workmen admitted it, even the most rabid of them.  Drawn by an irresistible impulse Peter elbowed his way into the midst of the workmen.  \"I am sure Mr. Coddington will listen to you,\" he ejaculated earnestly. \"Choose your men and let them go to him. Give him a chance to see your side of it. He will be reasonable--I know he will.\"  \"It's the Little Giant,\" said one man to another.  \"Put it to vote,\" urged Peter. \"Come! How many are for going to Mr. Coddington? You fellows do not want a strike. Think what it would mean!\"  \"The lad's right. Up with the hands!\"  It was a crisis.  Peter trembled from head to foot.  A few hands were raised, then slowly a few more; more came. All over the field they shot into the air.  \"And now choose your representatives,\" called Peter quickly, dreading lest the tide of sentiment should turn.  \"Carmachel! He doesn't seem to fear losing his job,\" piped a voice. \"Put on Carmachel!\"  \"And Jackson; he said he would not strike anyway,\" called somebody else.  \"Bryant is a good fellow! Put Bryant on.\"  \"Put on some men from the other factories, too,\" demanded a Pole aggressively.  A committee of twelve were chosen.  \"Add the Little Giant as the thirteenth--just for luck!\" laughed a knee-staker.  There was a cry of approval.  \"The Little Giant! The Little Giant!\" rose in a chorus.  \"No! No, indeed! I couldn't!\" Peter protested violently.  \"Of course you could!\" contradicted Carmachel. \"Come, come! You mustn't be so modest, Strong. You are with us for keeping the field, aren't you?\"  \"Yes. But there are reasons that you don't understand why I couldn't-"]]]
