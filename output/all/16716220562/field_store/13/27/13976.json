Nevertheless, all was over for the poor cardinal, and he was       obliged to quaff to the dregs the bitter cup of being in such bad       company.        The reader has, probably, not forgotten the impudent beggar who       had been clinging fast to the fringes of the cardinal’s gallery       ever since the beginning of the prologue. The arrival of the       illustrious guests had by no means caused him to relax his hold,       and, while the prelates and ambassadors were packing themselves       into the stalls—like genuine Flemish herrings—he settled himself       at his ease, and boldly crossed his legs on the architrave. The       insolence of this proceeding was extraordinary, yet no one       noticed it at first, the attention of all being directed       elsewhere. He, on his side, perceived nothing that was going on       in the hall; he wagged his head with the unconcern of a       Neapolitan, repeating from time to time, amid the clamor, as from       a mechanical habit, “Charity, please!” And, assuredly, he was,       out of all those present, the only one who had not deigned to       turn his head at the altercation between Coppenole and the usher.       Now, chance ordained that the master hosier of Ghent, with whom       the people were already in lively sympathy, and upon whom all       eyes were riveted—should come and seat himself in the front row       of the gallery, directly above the mendicant; and people were not       a little amazed to see the Flemish ambassador, on concluding his       inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes, bestow a       friendly tap on that ragged shoulder. The beggar turned round;       there was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two       countenances, and so forth; then, without paying the slightest       heed in the world to the spectators, the hosier and the wretched       being began to converse in a low tone, holding each other’s       hands, in the meantime, while the rags of Clopin Trouillefou,       spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais, produced the       effect of a caterpillar on an orange.        The novelty of this singular scene excited such a murmur of mirth       and gayety in the hall, that the cardinal was not slow to       perceive it; he half bent forward, and, as from the point where       he was placed he could catch only an imperfect view of       Trouillerfou’s ignominious doublet, he very naturally imagined       that the mendicant was asking alms, and, disgusted with his       audacity, he exclaimed: “Bailiff of the Courts, toss me that       knave into the river!”        “Cross of God! monseigneur the cardinal,” said Coppenole, without       quitting Clopin’s hand, “he’s a friend of mine.”        “Good! good!” shouted the populace. From that moment, Master       Coppenole enjoyed in Paris as in Ghent, “great favor with the       people; for men of that sort do enjoy it,” says Philippe de       Comines, “when they are thus disorderly.” The cardinal bit his       lips. He bent towards his neighbor, the Abbé of Sainte-Geneviève,       and said to him in a low tone,—“Fine ambassadors monsieur the       archduke sends here, to announce to us Madame Marguerite!”        “Your eminence,” replied the abbé, “wastes your politeness on       these Flemish swine. _Margaritas ante porcos_, pearls before       swine.”        “Say rather,” retorted the cardinal, with a smile, “_Porcos ante       Margaritam_, swine before the pearl.”        The whole little court in cassocks went into ecstacies over this       play upon words. The cardinal felt a little relieved; he was       quits with Coppenole, he also had had his jest applauded.        Now, will those of our readers who possess the power of       generalizing an image or an idea, as the expression runs in the       style of to-day, permit us to ask them if they have formed a very       clear conception of the spectacle presented at this moment, upon       which we have arrested their attention, by the vast parallelogram       of the grand hall of the palace.        In the middle of the hall, backed against the western wall, a       large and magnificent gallery draped with cloth of gold, into       which enter in procession, through a small, arched door, grave       personages, announced successively by the shrill voice of an       usher. On the front benches were already a number of venerable       figures, muffled in ermine, velvet, and scarlet. Around the       dais—which remains silent and dignified—below, opposite,       everywhere, a great crowd and a great murmur. Thousands of       glances directed by the people on each face upon the dais, a       thousand whispers over each name. Certainly, the spectacle is       curious, and well deserves the attention of the spectators. But       yonder, quite at the end, what is that sort of trestle work with       four motley puppets upon it, and more below? Who is that man       beside the trestle, with a black doublet and a pale face? Alas!       my dear reader, it is Pierre Gringoire and his prologue.        We have all forgotten him completely.        This is precisely what he feared.        From the moment of the cardinal’s entrance, Gringoire had never       ceased to tremble for the safety of his prologue. At first he had       enjoined the actors, who had stopped in suspense, to continue,       and to raise their voices; then, perceiving that no one was       listening, he had stopped them; and, during the entire quarter of       an hour that the interruption lasted, he had not ceased to stamp,       to flounce about, to appeal to Gisquette and Liénarde, and to       urge his neighbors to the continuance of the prologue; all in       vain. No one quitted the cardinal, the embassy, and the       gallery—sole centre of this vast circle of visual rays. We must       also believe, and we say it with regret, that the prologue had       begun slightly to weary the audience at the moment when his       eminence had arrived, and created a diversion in so terrible a       fashion. After all, on the gallery as well as on the marble       table, the spectacle was the same: the conflict of Labor and       Clergy, of Nobility and Merchandise. And many people preferred to       see them alive, breathing, moving, elbowing each other in flesh       and blood, in this Flemish embassy, in this Episcopal court,       under the cardinal’s robe, under Coppenole’s jerkin, than       painted, decked out, talking in verse, and, so to speak, stuffed       beneath the yellow amid white tunics in which Gringoire had so       ridiculously clothed them.        Nevertheless, when our poet beheld quiet reestablished to some       extent, he devised a stratagem which might have redeemed all.        “Monsieur,” he said, turning towards one of his neighbors, a       fine, big man, with a patient face, “suppose we begin again.”        “What?” said his neighbor.        “Hé! the Mystery,” said Gringoire.        “As you like,” returned his neighbor.        This semi-approbation sufficed for Gringoire, and, conducting his       own affairs, he began to shout, confounding himself with the       crowd as much as possible: “Begin the mystery again! begin       again!”        “The devil!” said Joannes de Molendino, “what are they jabbering       down yonder, at the end of the hall?” (for Gringoire was making       noise enough for four.) “Say, comrades, isn’t that mystery       finished? They want to begin it all over again. That’s not fair!”        “No, no!” shouted all the scholars. “Down with the mystery! Down       with it!”        But Gringoire had multiplied himself, and only shouted the more       vigorously: “Begin again! begin again!”        These clamors attracted the attention of the cardinal.        “Monsieur Bailiff of the Courts,” said he to a tall, black man,       placed a few paces from him, “are those knaves in a holy-water       vessel, that they make such a hellish noise?”        The bailiff of the courts was a sort of amphibious magistrate, a       sort of bat of the judicial order, related to both the rat and       the bird, the judge and the soldier.        He approached his eminence, and not without a good deal of fear       of the latter’s displeasure, he awkwardly explained to him the       seeming disrespect of the audience: that noonday had arrived       before his eminence, and that the comedians had been forced to       begin without waiting for his eminence.        The cardinal burst into a laugh.        “On my faith, the rector of the university ought to have done the       same. What say you, Master Guillaume Rym?”        “Monseigneur,” replied Guillaume Rym, “let us be content with       having escaped half of the comedy. There is at least that much       gained.”        “Can these rascals continue their farce?” asked the bailiff.        “Continue, continue,” said the cardinal, “it’s all the same to       me. I’ll read my breviary in the meantime.”        The bailiff advanced to the edge of the estrade, and cried, after       having invoked silence by a wave of the hand,—        “_Bourgeois_, rustics, and citizens, in order to satisfy those       who wish the play to begin again, and those who wish it to end,       his eminence orders that it be continued.”        Both parties were forced to resign themselves. But the public and       the author long cherished a grudge against the cardinal.

Except, of      |  | course, for a miracle ...   |  |                             |  +-----------------------------+   The tumult in Convention Hall was a hurricane of sound that lashed at a sea of human beings that surged and eddied around the broad floor. Men and women, delegates and spectators, aged party wheelhorses and youngsters who would vote for the first time that November, all lost their identities to merge with that swirling tide. Over their heads, like agitated bits of flotsam, pennants fluttered and placards rose and dipped. Beneath their feet, discarded metal buttons that bore the names of two or three \"favorite sons\" and those that had touted the only serious contender against the party's new candidate were trodden flat. None of them had ever really had a chance.  The buttons that were now pinned on every lapel said: \"Blast 'em With Cannon!\" or \"Cannon Can Do!\" The placards and the box-shaped signs, with a trifle more dignity, said: WIN WITH CANNON and CANNON FOR PRESIDENT and simply JAMES H. CANNON.  Occasionally, in the roar of noise, there were shouts of \"Cannon! Cannon! Rah! Rah! Rah! Cannon! Cannon! Sis-boom-bah!\" and snatches of old popular tunes hurriedly set with new words:      _On with Cannon, on with Cannon!       White House, here we come!     He's a winner, no beginner;       He can get things done!       (Rah! Rah! Rah!)_  And, over in one corner, a group of college girls were enthusiastically chanting:      _He is handsome! He is sexy!     We want J. H. C. for Prexy!_  It was a demonstration that lasted nearly three times as long as the eighty-five-minute demonstration that had occurred when Representative Matson had first proposed his name for the party's nomination.         *       *       *       *       *  Spatially, Senator James Harrington Cannon was four blocks away from Convention Hall, in a suite at the Statler-Hilton, but electronically, he was no farther away than the television camera that watched the cheering multitude from above the floor of the hall.  The hotel room was tastefully and expensively decorated, but neither the senator nor any of the other men in the room were looking at anything else except the big thirty-six-inch screen that glowed and danced with color. The network announcer's words were almost inaudible, since the volume had been turned way down, but his voice sounded almost as excited as those from the convention floor.  Senator Cannon's broad, handsome face showed a smile that indicated pleasure, happiness, and a touch of triumph. His dark, slightly wavy hair, with the broad swathes of silver at the temples, was a little disarrayed, and there was a splash of cigarette ash on one trouser leg, but otherwise, even sitting there in his shirt sleeves, he looked well-dressed. His wide shoulders tapered down to a narrow waist and lean hips, and he looked a good ten years younger than his actual fifty-two.  He lit another cigarette, but a careful scrutiny of his face would have revealed that, though his eyes were on the screen, his thoughts were not in Convention Hall.  Representative Matson, looking like an amazed bulldog, managed to chew and puff on his cigar simultaneously and still speak understandable English. \"Never saw anything like it. Never. First ballot and you had it, Jim. I know Texas was going to put up Perez as a favorite son on the first ballot, but they couldn't do anything except jump on the bandwagon by the time the vote reached them. Unanimous on the first ballot.\"  Governor Spanding, a lantern-jawed, lean man sitting on the other side of Senator Cannon, gave a short chuckle and said, \"Came close not t' being unanimous. The delegate from Alabama looked as though he was going to stick to his 'One vote for Byron Beauregarde Cadwallader' until Cadwallader himself went over to make him change his vote before the first ballot was complete.\"  The door opened, and a man came in from the other room. He bounced in on the balls of his feet, clapped his hands together, and dry-washed them briskly. \"We're in!\" he said, with businesslike glee. \"Image, gentlemen! That's what does it: Image!\" He was a tall, rather bony-faced man in his early forties, and his manner was that of the self-satisfied businessman who is quite certain that he knows all of the answers and all of the questions. \"Create an image that the public goes for, and you're in!\"  Senator Cannon turned his head around and grinned. \"Thanks, Horvin, but let's remember that we still have an election to win.\"  \"We'll win it,\" Horvin said confidently. \"A properly projected image attracts the public--\"  \"Oh, crud,\" said Representative Matson in a growly voice. \"The opposition has just as good a staff of PR men as we do. If we beat 'em, it'll be because we've got a better man, not because we've got better public relations.\"  \"Of course,\" said Horvin, unabashed. \"We can project a better image because we've got better material to work with. We--\"  \"Jim managed to get elected to the Senate without any of your help, and he went in with an avalanche. If there's any 'image projecting' done around here, Jim is the one who does it.\"  Horvin nodded his head as though he were in complete agreement with Matson. \"Exactly. His natural ability plus the scientific application of mass psychology make an unbeatable team.\"  Matson started to say something, but Senator Cannon cut in first. \"He's right, Ed. We've got to use every weapon we have to win this election. Another four years of the present policies, and the Sino-Russian Bloc will be able to start unilateral disarmament. They won't have to start a war to bury us.\"  Horvin looked nervous. \"Uh ... Senator--\"  Cannon made a motion in the air. \"I know, I know. Our policy during the campaign will be to run down the opposition, not the United States. We are still in a strong position, but _if this goes on_--Don't worry, Horvin; the whole thing will be handled properly.\"  Before any of them could say anything, Senator Cannon turned to Representative Matson and said: \"Ed, will you get Matthew Fisher on the phone? And the Governor of Pennsylvania and ... let's see ... Senator Hidekai and Joe Vitelli.\"  \"I didn't even know Fisher was here,\" Matson said. \"What do you want him for?\"  \"I just want to talk to him, Ed. Get him up here, with the others, will you?\"  \"Sure, Jim; sure.\" He got up and walked over to the phone.  Horvin, the PR man, said: \"Well, Senator, now that you're the party's candidate for the Presidency of the United States, who are you going to pick for your running mate? Vollinger was the only one who came even close to giving you a run for your money, and it would be good public relations if you chose him. He's got the kind of personality that would make a good image.\"  \"Horvin,\" the senator said kindly, \"I'll pick the men; you build the image from the raw material I give you. You're the only man I know who can convince the public that a sow's ear is really a silk purse, and you may have to do just that.  \"You can start right now. Go down and get hold of the news boys and tell them that the announcement of my running mate will be made as soon as this demonstration is over.  \"Tell them you can't give them any information other than that, but give them the impression that you already know. Since you _don't_ know, don't try to guess; that way you won't let any cats out of the wrong bags. But you _do_ know that he's a fine man, and you're pleased as all hell that I made such a good choice. Got that?\"  Horvin grinned. \"Got it. You pick the man; I'll build the image.\" He went out the door.         *       *       *       *       *  When the door had closed, Governor Spanding said: \"So it's going to be Fisher, is it?\"  \"You know too much, Harry,\" said Senator Cannon, grinning. \"Remind me to appoint you ambassador to Patagonia after Inauguration Day.\"  \"If I lose the election at home, I may take you up on it. But why Matthew Fisher?\"  \"He's a good man, Harry.\"  \"Hell yes, he is,\" the governor said. \"Tops. I've seen his record as State Attorney General and as Lieutenant Governor. And when Governor Dinsmore died three years ago, Fisher did a fine job filling out his last year. But--\"  \"But he couldn't get re-elected two years ago,\" Senator Cannon said. \"He couldn't keep the governor's office, in spite of the great job he'd done.\"  \"That's right. He's just not a politician, Jim. He doesn't have the ... the personality, the flash, whatever it is that it takes to get a man elected by the people. I've got it; you sure as hell have it; Fisher doesn't.\"  \"That's why I've got Horvin working for us,\" said Senator Cannon. \"Whether I need him or not may be a point of argument. Whether Matthew Fisher needs him or not is a rhetorical question.\"  Governor Spanding lit a cigarette in silence while he stared at the quasi-riot that was still coming to the screen from Convention Hall. Then he said: \"You've been thinking of Matt Fisher all along, then.\"  \"Not Patagonia,\" said the senator. \"Tibet.\"  \"I'll shut up if you want me to, Jim.\"  \"No. Go ahead.\"  \"All right. Jim, I trust your judgment. I've got no designs on the Vice Presidency myself, and you know it. I like to feel that, if I had, you'd give me a crack at it. No, don't answer that, Jim; just let me talk.  \"What I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of good men in the party who'd make fine VP's; men who've given their all to get you the nomination, and who'll work even harder to see that you're elected. Why pass them up in favor of a virtual unknown like Matt Fisher?\"  Senator Cannon didn't"]]]
