Rollo wished to go in there and see the grounds; but the boy walked on, and so Rollo followed him. After a time the guide turned off into a field, and there took a path which led down toward a wood, where they could hear water running. When they came into the wood they saw the water. It was a large stream, large enough for a mill stream, and it ran foaming and tumbling down over its rocky bed in a very picturesque manner.  The walk led along the bank of the stream, under the trees. It was a wide and very pleasant walk, and was well gravelled. Here and there there were little seats, too, at pretty places formed by the windings of the glen.  After walking along a little way, and not coming to any thing more, Mrs. Holiday began to be tired.  \"I wonder,\" said she, \"if there is any thing remarkable to see at the end of this path.\"  \"I'll ask the boy,\" said Rollo.  \"Boy,\" he added, speaking to the little guide, \"what is there to see up here?\"  \"It is this,\" said the boy, pointing to the brook.  \"Isn't there any thing else besides this stream?\" asked Rollo.  \"No,\" said the boy.  \"He says there is not any thing else,\" said Rollo to his mother; \"and so I don't believe it is worth while to go any farther. We have seen this brook enough, and you will get very tired.\"  Mrs. Holiday sat down upon a green bench that happened to be near, at a turn of the stream, in order to take time to consider the question.  Mr. Holiday sat down beside her.  \"We will wait here, Rollo, while you go on with the boy, and see what you can find. I think there must be something or other remarkable, for they would not make so good a path as this to lead to nothing at all. You may go on with the boy, and see what it comes to, and then you can come back and tell us.\"  Rollo liked this plan very much, and so he and the boy walked on.  In about five minutes Mr. Holiday heard Rollo calling to him.  \"FA-THER! FA-THER!\" said he.  \"_Well_,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"_I hear_.\"  \"Come up here,\" said Rollo, calling out again. \"It is a very curious place indeed.\"  So Mr. and Mrs. Holiday rose, and after following the path a short distance farther through the wood, they came to where Rollo was. They found, to their astonishment, that there the brook which they had been following so long came to a sudden end, or rather to a sudden beginning; for the whole volume of water that composed it was seen here to come boiling up out of the ground in a sort of shallow basin, which was formed on the hill side at the head of the glen.  The place was very secluded, but it was very beautiful. It was shaded with trees, which overhung the paths, and the basin, and the various channels of water which flowed from it and around it. The water boiled up very copiously from between the stones that had been set up to form the margin of the basin, and also among the sands which formed the bottom of it. The walk was conducted all around this singular fountain; and it passed across the outlet, where the stream flowed away from it, over a neat little stone dike, which formed the edge of the basin on the lower side.  Rollo led the way to the middle of this dike, and his father and mother followed. They stood there for some time, looking down into the basin to see the water boil up from between the stones and among the sands.  \"This is a very curious place indeed,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  \"It certainly is,\" said Mr. Holiday.  \"Well, father,\" said Rollo, after gazing for some time into the bubbling and boiling fountain, \"where does all this water come from? What makes it come up out of the ground?\"  \"Why, the truth is,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"though it seems to come _up_, it really comes _down_.  \"Do you see all this mountain up here?\" he added. So saying he pointed to the land which seemed to rise to a great height above the head of the glen.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.  \"Well, this mountain,\" continued Mr. Holiday, \"is full of water. All mountains are full of water, for it rains on the summits and sides of them almost continually, and this keeps them always full. Generally this water drains off down into the valleys, through the beds of sand and gravel that lie in the heart of the mountain, and so is not particularly observed. Sometimes it breaks out in small springs, at various places on the mountain sides; and sometimes the shape of the rocks and openings in the mountain are such as to collect a great quantity of it in one place, where it breaks out into the open ground altogether, as it does here. There are a great many such fountains in Switzerland.\"  \"Are there any larger than this?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"ten times as large. Sometimes the water forms quite a little river almost immediately after it comes out of the ground.\"  \"I should like to see them,\" said Rollo.  \"Very likely you will see some of them,\" said his father.  \"But then, father,\" said Rollo, \"if this water all comes from the rain, I should think that when it stops raining on the mountain above, then or soon afterwards the water would stop boiling up here.\"  \"No,\" said his father; \"the mountain is so large, and the immense beds of sand, gravel, and rock which it contains hold so much water, that before all that has fallen in one rain has time to get drained away, another rain comes, and so there is a perpetual supply, especially for such fountains as come from channels that reach far into the mountain.\"  After rambling about this spot for some time, the party returned down the path; but instead of going back into the road again by the way they came, the boy led them through a gate into the grounds of the hotel which they had seen in coming.  The grounds were very beautiful, being shaded with trees, and full of walks; and the stream which came down the glen spread itself out in various directions all over them, filling a great number of channels and basins which had been opened here and there, and were seen in every direction among the trees and foliage. The water flowed very swiftly along from one of these basins to another, sometimes in a continuous torrent, and sometimes by a series of cascades and waterfalls; and in the bottoms of all the little ponds the water was seen boiling up in the clean gray sand, just as it had done in the fountain up the glen.  There were walks every where along the banks of these streams, and little bridges leading across them. There were seats, too, and bowers, and a great many other pretty places. At one spot under a tree was a large white swan, or rather a sculptured image of one, sitting on a marble stone, and pouring out a constant stream of clear cold water from his mouth. Underneath, on a little marble slab, was a tumbler, placed there to enable people to take a drink. Rollo stopped to take a drink; but instead of using the tumbler, he caught the water in a drinking cup which he had bought in Scotland, and which he always carried in his pocket.  After rambling about these grounds for some time, the party went back through the yard of the hotel to the village. There they dismissed the boy. Mr. Holiday gave him half a franc for guiding them. Then they got into their carriage again, and rode on.  In about an hour they came to a little village named Ferney, near which was the chateau that was formerly the residence of the celebrated philosopher Voltaire. The carriage stopped under some ancient trees, and Mr. and Mrs. Holiday and Rollo got out and walked up an avenue. At the head of the avenue they came to a gate which led into the grounds of the chateau.  There was a bell cord hanging by this gate, and a placard up, requesting visitors to ring the bell, and not to enter the grounds until the domestic should come to guide them.  \"Shall I ring, father?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"ring away.\"  So Rollo pulled the bell rope, and very soon a domestic came. He received the company very politely, and invited them to follow him.  Mr. and Mrs. Holiday and Rollo accordingly followed him into the yard. The domestic led them round to the front of the house, which was turned away from the road. The front faced a beautiful lawn, ornamented with walks and trees. In one place there was a table under the trees, with seats around it, as if the family were accustomed sometimes to take their tea there. From this lawn there was a beautiful view of the lake and of the mountains beyond.  The domestic led them into the house, and showed them the two rooms in it which contained most of the memorials of Voltaire. The most remarkable of these memorials was a marble monument which stood on one side of the room, and which Rollo said looked like an ornamental stove, that contained Voltaire's _heart_. His body was buried in Paris, but his heart was deposited in this sepulchral urn.  Besides this there were a number of pictures in the room, which had been placed there by Voltaire. Some of them had been given to him by the emperors and kings that he had been acquainted with.  Rollo, however, did not take much interest in any of these things. The singular appearance of the room and of the furniture interested him in some degree by its novelty, but in other respects he was very little amused by what he saw. He was glad when the visit to the house was over, and he came out again upon the lawn.  From the lawn there was a very splendid view. There was a broad and very fertile slope of land extending for several miles down to the shore of the lake. Beyond it was seen the blue expanse of the water, and still farther another magnificent slope of fertile and richly-cultivated land, which extended back beyond the lake to the foot of the mountains. A lofty range of snow-clad summits rose in the distance, the towering summit of Mont Blanc reposing like a monarch in the midst of them.

Dotty Dimple, after a night of pleasant sleep, greeted herself in the morning with a groan. It was as if she had said,--  \"O, dear! _you_ here again, Dotty? Why didn't you sleep longer?\"  Prudy noticed the cloud on her sister's face in a moment; she saw she had \"waked up wrong.\"  Now I have never told you how peculiarly trying it was to live with Dotty Dimple. She seemed to have, at the same time, the nature of a lion and a lamb. When the lion raged, then her eyes blazed, and she looked as if she belonged in a menagerie; but when nothing occurred to rouse her wild temper, she was as gentle and tender as a little lamb frisking by its mother's side on a summer's day.  Indeed, if I were to describe the loveliness of her manners, and the sweetness of her face, I ought to dip my pen in liquid sunshine; whereas, the blackest of ink would not be at all too dark to draw her picture when she was out of temper.  In her earliest childhood it had been worse than it was now. Then she had not tried in the least to control herself, and the lion had had his own way. After one of her wild outbursts, she would follow her mother about the house, saying, in a soft, pleading voice,--  \"Say, mamma, is I your little comfort?\"  Before answering Dotty, the poor mother had to call to mind all the good things the child had ever said or done, and fancy how dreadful it would be to lose her. Then she would reply,--  \"Yes, Dotty, you are mamma's dear little girl; but mamma doesn't like your naughty, naughty ways.\"  This failed to satisfy Miss Dimple. She would cry out again, in heart-broken tones,--  \"Is I your little comfort, mamma? _Is_ I?\"  So, sooner or later, Mrs. Parlin was obliged, for the sake of peace, to kiss the child, and answer, \"Yes.\" Then, perhaps, for twenty-four hours the lion would be curled up, asleep, and out of sight in his den, and the lamb would be playfully frisking about the house, a pet for everybody.  But often and often, when Susy and Prudy came in from school or play, they found their baby sister in disgrace, perched upon the wood-box in the kitchen, with feet and hands firmly tied. There she would sit, throwing out the loudest noise possible from her little throat. It was the young lion again, roaring in his cage.  Prudy, though her heart swelled with pity, dared not say,--  \"Don't scream so, little sister! Please don't pound so with your feet!\"  For when the lion fits were on, it was always safest to let the unhappy child alone. Prudy, who had no more temper than a humming-bird, and Susy, who was only moderately fretful once in a while, were made very unhappy by Dotty's dreadful behavior. At such times as I describe, they even looked guilty, and cast down their eyes, for they could not help feeling their sister's conduct as a family disgrace. They never spoke to any one about it, and bore all her freaks with wonderful patience. When the little one plucked at their hair or ears, they said, pitifully,--  \"It's worse for her than it is for us. It makes her throat _so_ sore to scream so.\"  They were especially careful never to provoke her to wrath. Perhaps, for the sake of peace, they yielded to her too much. If there was anything Dotty dearly loved, it was her own way; and the thing she most heartily despised was \"giving up.\"  At the time of which we now write she was no longer a mere baby, and her \"reasons,\" as Prudy had said, were \"beginning to grow.\" She was never placed on the wood-box now, with hands and feet tied; and as for pulling hair, she was ashamed of the practice.  On this particular morning she had \"waked up wrong.\" You all know what that means. Perhaps her dream stopped in the most interesting place, or perhaps some of the wonderful machinery of her body was out of order, and caused a twitching of the delicate nerves which lie under the skin. At any rate, when the cloudy sun peeped through the white curtains of Dotty's pleasant chamber, he found that little lady out of sorts.  \"There, now, how long have you been awake, Prudy? Why didn't you speak?\"  \"O, it isn't anywhere near breakfast time, Dotty; Norah hasn't ground the coffee yet.\"  \"Then I should think she might! She knows I'm hungry, and that makes her be as slow as a board nail!--I'll tell you what I wish, Prudy. I wish the whole world was a 'normous cling-stone peach, so I could keep eating for always, and never come to the stone.\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Prudy, pleasantly. \"I believe I'd rather have it a Bartlett pear--dead ripe.\"  \"H'm! You may have your old _Bartnot_ pears, Prudy Parlin; nobody wants 'em but just you! The next sweet, juicy peach that comes into this house I'll eat it myself, 'cause you don't like peaches; you just said you didn't!\"  Prudy was considerate enough to make no reply. By living with Dotty, she had learned many lessons in \"holding her peace.\"  \"Perhaps we'd better get up,\" suggested she, rubbing her eyes.  Whereupon Dotty pursed her little red lips.  \"Let's play keep house,\" answered she, for the sake of being cross-grained.  \"Well, I don't care much,\" said Prudy, anxious to keep the peace.  They proceeded to make a tent of the upper sheet, and converse upon the trials of this troublesome life, as Mr. and Mrs. Carter, the two heads of a family.  \"There's our Sammy,\" said Prudy, dolefully, \"our poor Sammy. I don't see, Mrs. Carter, what we shall do with that boy. Within a day or two he has taken to stealing acorns!\"  \"Acorns!\" responded Dotty, in a tragic tone. \"O, Mr. Carter, I _sejest_ the best thing we can do is to stand him up in the sink, and pump water on him!\"  \"I never thought of that, my dear wife! You are prob'bly correct!--prob'bly correct.--But what course _shall_ we pursue with Mary Ann, and Julia Ann, and Anna Maria? They all bite their finger nails--bite 'em down to the double-quick.\"  \"I would sejest, sejest--why don't you give those children some _proxitude_ of iron, my dear--through a knitting-needle? Hark!\" continued she, as Prudy scratched the top of the tent with her forefinger. \"There's a mouse in this house, Mr. Carter: you must set a trap as quick as you can spring!\"  \"Very correct,\" replied the obedient husband, \"very correct, Mrs. Carter. I'll call Jerusha to toast some cheese. Je-ru-_shay_!\"  \"What do you mean by Jerusha, Mr. Carter? We haven't any in the house.\"  \"O, she is our chambermaid, my dear.\"  \"But I won't '_low_ her to be Jerusher, Mr. Carter!\"  \"But, my dear wife, Jerusha is a proper name; it belongs to her.\"  \"No, it isn't a proper name either; it's a very _improper_ name, Prudy Parlin; and if you call her Jerusher so, I'll get us both _dis-vosed_!\"  Prudy saw it was useless to continue the game: Dotty was not in a mood to be satisfied. The two children arose and dressed themselves, Prudy taking peculiar care not to finish her own toilet first.  \"I'm going to tell you something,\" said Dotty, grimly, \"but you mustn't tell mamma. I've made up my mind to be naughty!\"  \"To be naughty?\"  \"Yes, that's what I said--naughty! I'm tired all out o' bein' good! First thing I thought was, I'd be bad all day. I want to fret, and I'm going to fret!\"  \"O, Do-otty! Dotty Di-imple!\"  \"You needn't say anything, Prudy Parlin. You can talk as grand as a whale. But if I want to go and be naughty, _you_ can't help yourself!\"  Prudy's face took on a look of real distress. What this little queer mixture of a girl might do, if she really chose to be naughty, it was not pleasant to fancy.  The two went down stairs together. As they entered the cheerful dining-room, the joyous sun burst into a round smile, as if he had thrown off his yesterday's vapors, and never meant to be low-spirited again. But Dotty looked foggier than ever.  It was a delightful room. The wallpaper was the color of rich cream; the pictures were beautiful; the table, with its snowy cloth and white dishes, was pleasant to the eye; still, it was not so much the objects to be seen as it was the \"air\" of the room which made it seem so delightful. You knew at once, as you looked at the people who gathered around the table that morning, that they all loved one another; and family love makes any house seem like home.  Grandma Read was there in her plain Quaker cap, with the nicely-starched kerchief crossed upon her bosom; Mr. Parlin in his drab "]]]
