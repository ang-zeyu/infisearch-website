He and Jan rather liked it.  \"Let's don't go to bed yet,\" said Jan to her brother, as they finished supper and went from the dining-room into the sitting-room, where they were allowed to play and have good times if they did not get too rough. And they did not often do this.  \"All right. It _is_ early,\" Ted agreed. \"But what can we do?\"  \"Let's pretend we have a camp here,\" went on Jan.  \"Where?\" asked Ted.  \"Right in the sitting-room,\" answered Jan. \"We can make-believe the couch is a tent, and we can crawl under it and go to sleep.\"  \"I wants to go to sleeps there!\" cried Trouble. \"I wants to go to sleeps right now!\"  \"Shall we take him back to mother?\" asked Ted, looking at his sister. \"If he's sleepy now he won't want to play.\"  \"I isn't too sleepy to play,\" objected Baby William. \"I can go to sleeps under couch if you wants me to,\" he added.  \"Oh, that'll be real cute!\" cried Janet. \"Come on, Ted, let's do it! We can make-believe Trouble is our little dog, or something like that, to watch over our tent, and he can go to sleep----\"  \"Huh! how's he going to _watch_ if he goes to _sleep_?\" Ted demanded.  \"Oh, well, he can make-believe go to sleep or make-believe watch, either one,\" explained Janet.  \"Yes, I s'pose he could do that,\" agreed Teddy.  Baby William opened his mouth wide and yawned.  \"I guess he'll do some _real_ sleeping,\" said Janet with a laugh. \"Come on, Trouble, before you get your eyes so tight shut you can't open 'em again. Come on, we'll play camping!\" and she led the way into the sitting room and over toward the big couch at one end.  Many a good time the children had had in this room, and the old couch, pretty well battered and broken now, had been in turn a fort, a steamboat, railroad car, and an automobile. That was according to the particular make-believe game the children were playing. Now the old couch was to be a tent, and Jan and Ted moved some chairs, which would be part of the pretend-camp, up in front of it.  \"It'll be a lot of fun when we go camping for real,\" said Teddy, as he helped his sister spread one of Grandma Martin's old shawls over the backs of some chairs. This was to be a sort of second tent where they could make-believe cook their meals.  \"Yes, we'll have grand fun,\" agreed Jan. \"No, you mustn't go to sleep up there, Trouble!\" she called to the little fellow, for he had crawled up on top of the couch and had stretched himself out as though to take a nap.  \"Why?\" he asked.  \"'Cause the tent part is under it,\" explained his sister. \"That's the top of the tent where you are. You can't go to sleep on _top_ of a tent. You might fall off.\"  \"I can fall off now!\" announced Trouble, as he suddenly thought of something. Then he gave a wiggle and rolled off the seat, bumping into Ted, who had stooped down to put a rug under the couch-tent.  \"Ouch!\" cried Ted. \"Look out what you're doing, Trouble! You bumped my head.\"  \"I--I bumped _my_ head!\" exclaimed the little fellow, rubbing his tangled hair.  \"He didn't mean to,\" said Janet. \"You mustn't roll off that way, Trouble. You might be hurt. Come now, go to sleep under the couch. That's inside the tent you know.\"  She showed him where Ted had spread the rug, as far back under the couch as he could reach, and this looked to Trouble like a nice place.  \"I go to sleeps in there!\" he said, and under the couch he crawled, growling and grunting.  \"What are you doing that for?\" asked Ted, in some surprise.  \"I's a bear!\" exclaimed Baby William. \"I's a bad bear! Burr-r-r-r!\" and he growled again.  \"Oh, you mustn't do that!\" objected Janet. \"We don't want any bears in our camp!\"  \"Course we can have 'em!\" cried Ted. \"That'll be fun! We'll play Trouble is a bear 'stead of a dog, and I can hunt him. Only I ought to have something for a gun. I know! I'll get grandpa's Sunday cane!\" and he started for the hall.  \"Oh, no. I don't want to play bear and hunting!\" objected Janet.  \"Why not?\"  \"'Cause it's too--too--scary at night. Let's play something nice and quiet. Let Trouble be our watch dog, and we can be in camp and he can bark and scare something.\"  \"What'll he scare?\" asked Ted.  Meanwhile Baby William was crawling as far back under the couch as he could, growling away, though whether he was pretending to be a bear, a lion or only a dog no one knew but himself.  \"What do you want him to scare?\" asked Ted of his sister.  \"Oh--oh--well, chickens, maybe!\" she answered.  \"Pooh! Chickens aren't any fun!\" cried Ted. \"If Trouble is going to be a dog let him scare a wild bull, or something like that. Anyhow chickens don't come to camp.\"  \"Well, neither does wild bulls!\" declared Janet.  \"Yes, they do!\" cried Ted, and it seemed as if there would be so much talk that the children would never get to playing anything. \"Don't you 'member how daddy told us about going camping, and in the night a wild bull almost knocked down the tent.\"  \"Well, that was real, but this is only make-believe,\" said Janet. \"Let Trouble scare the chickens.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Ted, who was nearly always kind to his sister. \"Go on and growl, Trouble. You're a dog and you're going to scare the chickens out of camp.\"  They waited a minute but Trouble did not growl.  \"Why don't you make a noise?\" asked Janet.  Trouble gave a grunt.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Ted.  \"I--I can't growl 'cause I'm all stuck under here,\" answered the voice of the little fellow, from far under the couch. \"I can't wiggle!\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Janet.  Teddy stooped and looked beneath the couch.  \"He's caught on some of the springs that stick down,\" he said. \"I'll poke him out.\"  He caught hold of Trouble's clothes and pulled the little fellow loose. But Trouble cried--perhaps because he was sleepy--and then his mother came and got him, leaving Teddy and Janet to play by themselves, which they did until they, too, began to feel sleepy.  \"You'll want to go to bed earlier than this when you go camping, my Curlytops,\" said Grandpa Martin, as the children came out of the sitting-room.  \"Are you really going to take them camping?\" asked Mother Martin after Jan and Ted had gone upstairs to bed.  \"I really am. There are some tents in the barn. I own part of Star Island and there's no nicer place to camp. You'll come, too, and so will Dick when he comes back from Cresco. We'll take Nora along to do the cooking. Will you come, Mother?\" and the Curlytops' grandfather looked at his gray-haired wife.  \"No, I'll stay on Cherry Farm and feed the hired men,\" she answered with a smile.  \"Why do they call it Star Island?\" asked Ted's mother.  \"Well, once upon a time, a good many years ago,\" said Grandpa Martin, \"a shooting star, or meteor, fell blazing on the island, and that's how it got its name.\"  \"Maybe it was a part of the star shining that the children saw to-night,\" said Grandma Martin. \"Though I don't see how it could be, for it fell many years ago.\"  \"Maybe,\" agreed her husband.  None of them knew what a queer part that fallen star was to have in the lives of those who were shortly to go camping on the island.  Early the next morning after breakfast, Ted and Jan went out to the barn to get Nicknack to have a ride.  \"Where is you? I wants to come, too!\" cried the voice of their little brother, as they were putting the harness on their goat.  \"Oh, there's Trouble,\" whispered Ted. \"Shall we take him with us, Jan?\"  \"Yes, this time. We're not going far. Grandma wants us to go to the store for some baking soda.\"  \"All right, we'll drive down,\" returned Ted. \"Come on, Trouble!\" he called.  \"I's tummin',\" answered Baby William. \"I's dot a tookie.\"  \"He means cookie,\" said Jan, laughing.  \"I know it,\" agreed Ted. \"I wish he'd bring me one.\"  \"Me too!\" exclaimed Janet.  \"I's dot a 'ot of tookies,\" went on Trouble, who did not always talk in such \"baby fashion.\" When he tried to he could speak very well, but he did not often try.  \"Oh, he's got his whole apron _full_ of cookies!\" cried Jan. \"Where did you get them?\" she asked, as her little brother came into the barn.  \"Drandma given 'em to me, an' she said you was to have some,\" announced the little boy, as he let the cookies slide out of his apron to a box that stood near the goat-wagon.  Then Baby William began eating a cookie, and Jan and Ted did also, for they, too, were hungry, though it was not long after breakfast.  \"Goin' to wide?\" asked Trouble, his mouth full of cookie.  \"Yes, we're going for a ride,\" answered Jan. \"Oh, Ted, get a blanket or something to put over our laps. It's awful dusty on the road to-day, even if it did rain last night. It all dried up, I guess.\"  \"All right, I'll get a blanket from grandpa's carriage. And you'd better get a cushion for Trouble.\"  \"I will,\" said Janet, and her brother and sister left Baby William alone with the goat for a minute or two.  When Jan came back with the cushion she went to get another cookie, but there were none.  \"Why Trouble Martin!\" she cried, \"did you eat them _all_?\"  \"All what?\"  \"All the cookies!\"  \"I did eat one and Nicknack--he did eat the west. He was hungry, he was, and he did eat the west ob 'em. I feeded 'em to him. Nicknack was a hungry goat,\" said Trouble, smiling.  \"I should think he was hungry, to eat up all those cookies! I only had one!\" cried Jan.  \"What! Did Nicknack get at the cookies?\" cried Ted, coming back with a light lap robe.  \"Trouble gave them to him,\" explained Janet. \"Oh dear! I was so hungry for another!\"  \"I'll ask grandma for some,\" promised Ted, and he soon came back with his hands full of the round, brown molasses cookies.  \"Hello, Curlytops, what can I do for you to-day?\" asked the storekeeper a little later, when the three children had driven up to his front door. \"Do you want a barrel of sugar put in your wagon or a keg of salt mack'rel? I have both.\"  \"We want baking soda,\" answered Jan.  \"And you shall have the best I've got. Where are you going--off to look for the end of the rainbow and get the pot of gold at the end?\" he asked jokingly.  \"No,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25477"],["title","The Curlytops on Star Island; Or, Camping out with Grandpa (#3)"],["body","e're not going far to-day,\" answered Ted.  \"Well, stop in when you're passing this way again,\" called out the storekeeper as Ted turned Nicknack around for the homeward trip. \"I'm always glad to see you.\"  \"Maybe you won't see us now for quite a while,\" answered Jan proudly.  \"No? Why not? You're not going to leave Cherry Farm I hope.\"  Ted stopped Nicknack that they might better explain.  \"We're going camping with grandpa on Star Island.\"  \"Where's that you're going?\" asked a farmer who had just come out of the store after buying some groceries.  \"Camping on Star Island in Clover Lake,\" repeated Ted.  \"Huh! I wouldn't go there if I were you,\" said the farmer, shaking his head.  \"Why not?\" asked Ted. \"Is it because of the blue light?\" and he looked at his sister to see if she remembered.  \"I don't know anything about a blue light,\" the farmer answered. \"But if I were your grandfather I wouldn't take you there camping,\" and the man again shook his head.  \"Why not?\" asked Janet, her eyes opening wide in surprise.  \"Well, I'll tell you why,\" went on the farmer. \"I was over on Star Island fishing the other day, and I saw a couple of tramps, or maybe gypsies, there. I didn't like the looks of the men, and that's why I wouldn't go there camping if I were you or your grandpa,\" and the farmer shook his head again as he unhitched his team of horses.     CHAPTER III  OFF TO STAR ISLAND   \"Oh Ted!\" exclaimed Janet, as she drove home in the goat-wagon with her brother and Baby William, \"do you s'pose we can't go camping with grandpa?\"  \"Why can't we?\" demanded Teddy.  \"'Cause of what that farmer said.\"  \"Oh, well, I guess grandpa won't be 'fraid of tramps on the island. It's part his, anyhow, and he can make 'em get off.\"  \"Yes, he could do that,\" agreed Janet, after thinking the matter over. \"But if they were gypsies?\"  \"Well, gypsies and tramps are the same. Grandpa can make the gypsies get off the island too.\"  \"They--they might take Trouble,\" faltered Jan in a low voice.  \"Who?\" asked Ted.  \"The gypsies.\"  \"Who take me?\" demanded Trouble himself. \"Who take me, Jam?\"  Sometimes he called his sister Jam instead of Jan.  \"Who take me?\" he asked, playfully poking his fingers in his sister's eyes.  \"Oh--nobody,\" she answered quickly, as she took him off her lap and put him behind her in the cart. She did not want to frighten her little brother. \"Let's hurry home and tell grandpa,\" Jan said to Ted, and he nodded his curly head to show that he would do that.  On trotted Nicknack, Trouble being now seated in the back of the wagon on a cushion, while Ted and Jan were in front.  \"Maybe it was tramps making a campfire that we saw last night,\" went on Jan after a pause, during which they came nearer to Cherry Farm.  \"A campfire blaze isn't blue,\" declared Ted.  \"Well, maybe this is a new kind.\"  Ted shook his head until his curls waggled.  \"I don't b'lieve so,\" he said.  \"Bang! There, me shoot you!\" suddenly cried Trouble, and Ted and Jan heard something fall with a thud on the ground behind them.  \"Whoa, there!\" cried Ted to Nicknack. \"What are you shootin', Trouble baby?\" he asked, turning to look at his little brother.  \"Me shoot a bunny rabbit,\" was the answer.  \"Oh, there _is_ a little bunny!\" cried Jan, pointing to a small, brown one that ran along under the bushes, and then came to a stop in front of the goat-wagon, pausing to look at the children.  \"Me shoot him,\" said Trouble, laughing gleefully.  \"What with?\" asked Ted, a sudden thought coming into his mind.  \"Trouble frow store thing at bunny,\" said the little boy. \"It bwoke an' all white stuff comed out!\"  \"Oh, Trouble, did you throw grandma's soda at the bunny?\" cried Jan.  \"Yes, I did,\" answered Baby William.  \"And it's all busted!\" exclaimed Ted, as he saw the white powder scattered about on the woodland path. \"We've got to go back to the store for some more. Oh, Trouble Martin!\"  \"I's didn't hurt de bunny wabbit,\" said Trouble earnestly. \"I's only make-be'ieve shoot him--bang!\"  \"I know you didn't hurt the bunny,\" observed Jan. \"But you've hurt grandma's soda. Is there any left, Ted?\" she asked, as her brother got out of the wagon to pick up the broken package.  \"A little,\" he answered. \"There's some in the bottom. I guess we'll go back to the store and get more. I want to ask that farmer again about the tramps on Star Island.\"  \"No, don't,\" begged Jan. \"Let's take what soda we have to grandma. Maybe it'll be enough. Anyhow, if we did go back for more Trouble might throw that out, too, if he saw a rabbit.\"  \"That's so. I guess we'd better leave him when we go to the store next time. How'd he get the soda, anyhow?\"  \"It must have jiggled out of my lap, where I was holding it, and then it fell in the bottom of the wagon and he got it. He didn't know any better.\"  \"No, I s'pose not. Well, maybe grandma can use this.\"  Teddy carefully lifted up the broken package of baking soda, more than half of which had spilled when Trouble threw it at the little brown rabbit. Baby William may have thought the package of soda was a white stone, for it was wrapped in a white paper.  \"Well, I'm glad he didn't hit the little bunny, anyhow,\" said Jan. \"Where is it?\" and she looked for the rabbit.  But the timid woodland creature had hopped away, probably to go to its burrow and tell a wonderful story, in rabbit language, about having seen some giants in a big wagon drawn by an elephant--for to a rabbit a goat must seem as large as a circus animal.  \"I guess Trouble can't hit much that he throws at,\" observed Ted, as he started Nicknack once more toward Cherry Farm.  \"He threw a hair brush at me once and hit me,\" declared Jan.  \"Yes, I remember,\" said Teddy. \"Here, Trouble, if you want to throw things throw these,\" and he stopped to pick up some old acorns which he gave his little brother. \"You can't hurt anyone with them.\"  Trouble was delighted with his new playthings, and kept quiet the rest of the way home tossing the acorns out of the goat-wagon at the trees he passed.  Grandma Martin said it did not matter about the broken box of soda, as there was enough left for her need; so Ted and Jan did not have to go back to the store.  \"But I'd like to ask that farmer more about the tramps on Star Island,\" said Ted to his grandfather, when telling what the man had said at the grocery.  \"I'll see him and ask him,\" decided Grandpa Martin.  It was two days after this--two days during which the Curlytops had much fun at Cherry Farm--that Grandpa Martin spoke at dinner one afternoon.  \"I saw Mr. Crittendon,\" he said, \"and he told me that he had seen you Curlytops at the store and mentioned the tramps on Star Island.\"  \"Are they really there?\" asked Jan eagerly.  \"Well, they might have been. But we won't let them bother us if we go camping. I'll make them clear out. Most of that island belongs to me, and the rest to friends of mine. They'll do as I say, and we'll clear out the tramps.\"  \"I hope you will, Grandpa,\" said Janet.  \"Did Mr. Crittendon say anything about the queer blue light Jan and Ted saw?\" asked Grandma Martin.  \"No, he hadn't seen that.\"  \"Where did the tramps come from? And is he sure they weren't gypsies?\" asked Jan's mother.  \"No, they weren't gypsies. We don't often see them around here. Oh, I imagine the tramps were the regular kind that go about the country in summer, begging their way. They might have found a boat and gone to the island to sleep, where no constable would trouble them.  \"But we're not afraid of tramps, are we, Curlytops?\" he cried, as he caught Baby William up in his arms and set him on his broad shoulder. \"We don't mind them, do we, Trouble?\"  \"We frow water on 'em!\" said Baby William, laughing with delight as his grandfather made-believe bite some \"souse\" off his ears.  \"That's what we will! No tramps for us on Star Island!\"  \"When are we going?\" asked Ted excitedly.  \"Yes, when?\" echoed Jan.  \"In a few days now. I've got to get out the tents and other things. We'll go the first of the week I think.\"  Ted and Jan could hardly wait for the time to come. They helped as much as they could when Grandpa Martin got the tents out of the barn, and they wanted to take so many of their toys and playthings along that there would have been no room in the boat for anything else if they had had their way.  But Mother Martin thinned out their collection of treasures, allowing them to take only what she thought would give them the most pleasure. Boxes of food were packed, and a little stove made ready to take along, for although a campfire looks nice it is hard to cook over.  Trouble got into all sorts of mischief, from almost falling out of the haymow once, to losing the bucket down the well by letting the chain unwind too fast. But a hired man caught him as he toppled off the hay in the barn, and Grandpa Martin got the bucket up from the well by tying the rake to a long pole and fishing deep down in the water.  At last the day came when the Curlytops were to go camping on Star Island. The boat was loaded with the tents and other things, and two or three trips were to be made half-way across the lake, for the island was about in the middle. Nicknack and his wagon were to be taken over and a small stable made for him under a tree not far from the big tent.  \"All aboard!\" cried Ted, as he and Jan took their places in the first boat. \"All aboard!\"  \"Isn't this fun!\" laughed Janet, who was taking care of Trouble.  \"Dis fun,\" echoed the little chap.  \"I'm sure we'll have a nice time,\" said Mother Martin. \"And your father will like it when he, too, can camp out with us.\"  \"I hope the tramps don't bother you,\" said Mr. Crittendon, who had come to help Grandpa Martin get his camping party ready.  \"Oh, we're not afraid of them!\" cried Ted.  \"Well, be careful; that's all I've got to say,\" went on the farmer. \"I'll let you have my gun, if you think you'll need it,\" he said to Grandpa Martin.  \"Nonsense! I won't need it, thank you. I'm not afraid of a few tramps. Besides I sent"]]]
