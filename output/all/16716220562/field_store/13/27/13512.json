[D] The casual ejector was John Doe, who was, like Richard Roe, an entirely imaginary person, of much importance in the old action of ejectment abolished in 1852.  [E] The allusion is to the \"Advocates' Widows Fund,\" subscribed to by all members of the Scottish bar, married or unmarried. The non-existent widow of the unmarried advocate has been a frequent subject of legal verse. See \"The Bachelor's Dream,\" by John Rankine, (_Journal of Jurisprudence_, vol. xxii. p. 155), \"My Widow,\" by David Crichton (_id._ vol. xxiv. p. 51).     The Squire's Daughter       We crawled about the nursery       In tenderest years in tether,     At six we waded in the sea       And caught our colds together.      At ten we practised playing at       A kind of heathen cricket,     A croquet mallet was the bat,       The Squire's old hat the wicket.      At twelve, the cricket waxing slow,       With home-made bow and arrow     We took to shooting--once I know       I all but hit a sparrow.      She took birds' nests from easy trees,       I climbed the oaks and ashes,     'Twas deadly work for hands and knees,       Deplorable for sashes.      At hide and seek one summer day       We played in merry laughter,     'Twas then she hid her heart away,       I never found it after.      So time slipped by until my call,       For out of the professions     I chose the Bar as best of all,       And joined the Loamshire Sessions.      The reason for it was that there       Her father, short and pursy,     Doled out scant justice in the chair       And even scanter mercy.      As Holofernes lost his head       To Judith of Bethulia,     So I fell victim, but instead       Of Judith it was Julia.      My speech left juries in the dark,       Of Julia I was thinking,     And once I heard a coarse remark       About a fellow drinking.      I practised verse in leisure time       Both in and out of season,     It was indubitably rhyme,       Occasionally reason.      I lacked the cheek to tell my woes,       Had not concealment fed on     My damask cheek, but left my nose       With twice its share of red on?      Too horrible was this suspense,       At last, in desperation     I went to Loamshire on pretence       Of death of a relation.      The Squire was beaming; \"Julia's gone       To London for a visit,     But with a wedding coming on       That's not surprising, is it?      \"Old friends like you will think, no doubt,       That she is young to marry,     But ever since she first came out,       She's been engaged to Harry.\"     Her Letter in Chambers       I sat by the fire and watched it blaze,       And dreamed that she wrote me a letter,     And for that dream to the end of my days       To Fancy I owe myself debtor.      Next day there came the postman's knock,       The morning was bright and sunny,     And showed me a sheaf of circulars, stock       Attempts to get hold of my money.      'Mid correspondence of this dull kind       A dainty notelet lay hidden,     It seemed as though it had half a mind       To consider itself forbidden.      The writing was like herself, complete,       With a touch of her queenly bearing,     So Venus wrote when she ordered in Crete       Her doves to take her an airing.      Inside it was just as promising,       'Twas a pressing invitation     To dine at her house to-morrow, and bring       My book for her approbation.      For I have published, be it confessed,       A little volume of verses,     And in the volume whatever is best       The praise of herself rehearses.      I sit by the fire, and again I dream       A happier dream than ever,     I see her beautiful eyes soft gleam       As she murmurs, \"How lovely--how clever!\"      Her criticism may be commonplace,       But who can be angry after     Now sweet with pity he marks her face,       Now bright with impulsive laughter?     Law and Poetry       In days of old did law and rime       A common pathway follow,     For Themis in the mythic time       Was sister of Apollo.      The Hindu statutes tripped in feet       As daintily as Dryads,     And law in Wales to be complete       Was versified in triads.      The wise Alfonso of Castile       Composed his code in metre     Thereby to make its flavour feel       A little bit the sweeter.      But law and rime were found to be       A trifle inconsistent,     And now in statutes poetry       Is wholly non-existent.      Still here and there some advocate       Before his fellows know it     Has had bestowed on him by fate       The laurel of the poet.      Let him who has been honoured so,       In truth a _rara avis_,     Find precedents in Cicero       And our Chief Justice Davis;      And more than all in Cino; he,       So plaintive a narrator     Of fair Selvaggia's cruelty,       Won fame as a glossator.      Let him remember Thomas More       And Scott and Alciatus,     And Grotius with an ample store       Of most divine afflatus.      But let him, if his bread and cheese       Depend on his profession,     Bethink him that the art of these       Was not their sole possession.      The stream that flows from Helicon       Is scarcely a Pactolus,     A richer prize is theirs who con       Dull treatises on _dolus_.      'Tis well that some bold spirits dare       To cut themselves asunder     From bonds of law like old Molière,       While lawyers gaze in wonder.      The world had been a poorer place       Had Goethe lived by pleading     Or Tasso won a hopeless case       With Ariosto leading.     Somewhere       Somewhere in a distant star,     Cities of Cocaigne there are,     Paradises of the Bar.      Somewhere 'neath another sun     Counsel cease to see the fun     Lurking in a judge's pun.      Somewhere courts are fair to see,     Beauty joins utility,     Ushers answer courteously.      Somewhere there are bailiwicks     Which for dock defences fix     Nothing under three-five-six.      Somewhere rises struggle sore     For revisorships no more,     Every shire has half a score.      Somewhere educated thought     Scientifically taught     Cross-examines as it ought.      Somewhere judgments are obeyed,     Executions are not stayed,     Fees are almost always paid.      Somewhere County Councils press     Banquets on the circuit mess,     Fleshpots in the wilderness.      Somewhere at Assizes grow     Prosecutions row on row,     Every man has six or so.      Somewhere, eager but for right,     Court and counsel cease to cite     Pointless cases recondite.      Somewhere headnotes give the ground     Whereupon the judges found     Judgments generally sound.      Somewhere juries use their sense,     Basing on the evidence     Verdicts of intelligence.      Somewhere rich embroideries     Woven cunningly of lies     Part in twain at truth's clear eyes.      Somewhere justice grows from wrong,     Till the right that suffered long     Sings at last its triumph song.      Somewhere--even in a place     Peopled by a perfect race--     One side holds a losing case.      Somewhere since the world began     Heaven hath made an honest man,     Somewhere in Aldebaran.     Roman Law       I am a \"coach\" in Roman law by fate,       But Nature must have meant me for a poet,     And while I struggle with a rule or date,       Poetic thoughts intrude before I know it.      The changing sunshine on the summer sea       Drives forth the law of _cessio bonorum_,     _Peculium castrense_ speaks to me       Of Horace and his _Dulce et decorum_.      I see the matine bee among the flowers       Instead of _testamentum militare_,     And wander far away from agent's powers       To picture me again some Maud or Mary.      In truth there is no sequence in the thought,       Why should the title _De Societate_     Suggest, not trading partners, as it ought,       But visions of my last night's valse with Katie?      But worse than this, when I have done my task,       Stern law again asserts her domination,     'Tis cruel 'mid the new-mown hay to bask,       And find one's mind is running on novation;      Or in the dusk, when glow-worms light the moss,       To hear the distant voice of Philomela     Expound the three varieties of _dos_       And wax right eloquent about _tutela_.      I had a little respite yesterday,       Dining with one who well knew how to dine us,     But when I slept, the charm soon fled away,       I dreamed I was a _prætor peregrinus_.      Dismasted in the deep of law I lie,       A poor reward it is to stand confessed as     The Virgil of the interdict _de vi_,       The Petrarch of the _patria potestas_.     Bologna       I go from colonnade to colonnade       In streets that Dante trod, and past the towers       Aslant toward heaven, and listen to the hours     Chimed by the bells of choirs where Dante prayed.     They cease; then lo! the foot of time seems stayed       Five hundred years and more, I find me bowers       Where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers     For one who reads Boccaccio in the shade.     The cowlèd students halt by two and threes       To hear the voice come thrilling through the trees,       Then tear themselves away to themes more trite.     Anon I mark the diligent hands that turn       Unlovely parchment scrolls whereby to learn       The beauty of inexorable right.     A Garden Party in the Temple       On hospitable thoughts intent     To me the Inner Temple sent           An invitation,     A garden party 'twas to be,     And I accepted readily           And with elation;     Good reason too, but oft the seeds     Of reason flower in senseless deeds.      I stood as savage as a bear,     For not a human being there           Knew I from Adam     I heard around in various tones,     \"_So_ glad to see you, Mr. Jones;\"           \"Good morning, Madam.\"     It seemed so painfully absurd     To stand and never speak a word.      I brought my doom upon myself,     And there I was upon the shelf           In melancholy.

I once met Chloris at a ball,           And in my folly     I went and suffered all this pain     In hopes to see her once again.      Of strawberries a pound at least     I ate, and made myself a beast           With tea and sherry;     And raspberries I ate and trembled,     Until I felt that I resembled           Myself a berry,     But 'twas the berry that at school     We used to call a gooseberry fool.      The I. C. R. V.[F] band droned on,     While guests had come and guests had gone           Since my arrival;     My brow grew gloomier with despair,     And on it sat the guilty air           Of a survival     Of some remorse for ancient crimes     Wrought in the pre-historic times.      My seventh cup of tea was done,     My seventh glass of wine begun,           Then of her coming     I was aware, nor shall forget     How she and that brown sherry set           My brains a-humming;     Well should I be rewarded soon     For all the weary afternoon.      Her eyes looked vaguely into mine     Without as much as half a sign           Of recognition.     My heart, my heart! the blow was sore,     But you have often been before           In this condition;     As said the bard of old, those eyes     Are not my only Paradise.[G]  [F] Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers.  [G] Dante, Par. xviii. 21.     The Spinning-House of the Future      \"Cada puta hile.\"--_Don Quixote_, i. 46.       Without my dinner here I lie,           And all because that proctor     With her stout bull-dogs passed, and I                       Mocked her.      For Clara is at Girton too,           That dragon is her tutor,     I threatened once what I would do,                       Shoot her.      Her life by Clara's tears was saved,           Wherefore she doth detest me,     And hither hungry and unshaved                       Pressed me.      I would that I could have commenced           An action 'gainst that devil,     Like that once brought by Kemp against                       Neville.[H]      To her I owe the statute framed           That one against it sinning     Should dwell within the house that's named                       Spinning.      Ah me! it runs in sections three:           Who speaks to Girton student     Is fined to teach him how to be                       Prudent.      Who loves a Girton girl must do           Twelve months on bread and water,     From a digestive point of view                       Slaughter.      Who kisses her commits a crime           By hanging expiated,     And she in tears must spend her time                       Gated.      Would that at Oxford I had been,           At Balliol or at Merton,     And then I never should have seen                       Girton.      Go down I must, no more shall I           And Clara cross the same bridge;     Still, Granta, art thou her and my                       Cambridge.      Some day on this her eyes may light,           This doggerel stiff and jointless,     And she may own it is not quite                       Pointless.  [H] An action brought in 1861 by a dressmaker at Cambridge against the Vice-Chancellor for false imprisonment in the Spinning-House (the University prison). The Court of Common Pleas held _inter alia_ that no action lies against a judge for a judicial decision on a matter within his jurisdiction (10 Common Bench Reports, New Series, 523).     How we found our Verdict       We sat in the jury-box, twelve were we all,     And the clock was just pointing to ten in the hall,     His Lordship he bowed to the jury, and we     Bowed back to his Lordship as gravely as he.      The case of _De Weller_ v. _Jones_ was the first,     And we all settled down and prepared for the worst     When old Smithers, Q.C., began slowly to preach     Of a promise of marriage and action for breach.      A barmaid the plaintiff was, wondrous the skill     Wherewith she was wont her tall tankards to fill,     The defendant, a publican, sought for his bride     Such a paragon, urged by professional pride.      But the course of true love ran no smoother for her     Than the Pas de Calais or the bark of a fir,     The defendant discovered a widow with gold     In the bank and the plaintiff was left in the cold.      An hour Smithers spoke, and he said that the heart     Of the plaintiff at Jones's fell touch flew apart,     But a cheque for a thousand might help to repair     The destruction effected by love and despair.      Miss de Weller was called, and in ladylike tones     She described all the injury suffered from Jones,     How he called her at first \"Angelina,\" and this     Soon cooled to \"Miss Weller,\" and lastly to \"Miss.\"      But the jury were shaken a little when Gore     Cross-examined about her engagements before,     For Jones was the sixth of the strings to her bow     And with five other verdicts she solaced her woe.      Re-examined by Smithers, she won us again,     For the tears of a maid are a terror to men,     Then his Lordship awoke from his nap and explained     How love that is frequent is love that is feigned.      Miss de Weller looked daggers, and under the paint     Of her cheeks she grew pale and fell down in a faint,     She played her trump-card in the late afternoon,     For damages satisfy girls who can swoon.      Till she fainted most thought that a farthing would do,     Though I was in favour of pounds--one or two;     But after the faint--and she _was_ so well dressed--     At a hundred the void in her heart was assessed.     A Greek Libel       ARCHILOCHUS.      Neobule, yesternight     Saw I thee in beauty dight,     On thy head a myrtle spray     Cast its shadow as the day     By the stars was put to flight.     Twining on thy temples white     Roses gave the myrtle light,     Sign thou wilt not say me nay,                   Neobule.     Loosened from its coilèd height     Streamed thy hair in thy despite     On thy shoulders soft to stray     And to bid the bard essay     Never but of thee to write,                   Neobule.       NEOBULE.      Sorry poet, who dost dare     Cast bold glances on my hair,     Let thy most presumptuous eyes     Seek another enterprise,     Ceasing now to linger there.     Hearken, I can tell thee where     Grow the bushes that will spare     Rods to teach thee humbler guise,                   Sorry poet.     Know I not that I am fair?     Need thy halting verse declare     What my mirror daily cries?     Rid me of thy silly sighs,     Rid me of thy hateful stare,                   Sorry poet.       ARCHILOCHUS.      Neobule, poets see     Dreams of things that are to be.     Vengeance is the poet's trade,     Come, iambus, to my aid     'Gainst the fools who scoff at me.     All the world will laugh with glee     When they mark my verses free     Grasp thee like a pillory,     And thy scorn with scorn repaid,                   Neobule.     E'en in death thou canst not flee     From the doom the Fates decree.     When my satire's keenest blade     Cuts thee to the heart, fond maid,     I shall laugh, but what of thee,                   Neobule?

O'er pauper settlements men fought amain,     And golden guineas followed in their train,     John Doe then flourished like a lusty tree,     And Richard Roe brought many a noble fee,     We mourn in unremunerated pain                           Those brave old days.  [I] See, for instance, the well-known case of _Mostyn_ v. _Fabrigas_, in which the plaintiff declared that the defendant on the 1st of September, in the year 1771, made an assault upon the said plaintiff at Minorca, to wit, at London, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bow, in the Ward of Cheap.
