It was unfavorable to Harry's purpose that these trees rise straight from the ground, and are not encumbered by underbrush. It was very pleasant walking though, and Harry sauntered along at his leisure. He almost forgot the object of his enterprise, until some half an hour later, in the stillness of the woods, his quick ear caught the sound of voices.  He was instantly on the alert. The voices, he doubted not, were those of Dick Fletcher and Larry Linton. He moved forward cautiously, and soon espied the speakers. They were sitting on the ground, under the overreaching boughs of a gigantic tree. Harry managed to get near enough to listen to the conversation, being himself concealed from view behind the trunk of a neighboring tree.  \"Is there much money in the party?\" he heard Linton ask.  \"I can't tell you. The boys haven't got much, but that long-legged Yankee has probably got considerable.\"  \"What sort of a man is he?\"  \"He's likely to prove a troublesome customer. He is muscular, as you can see, and not easily scared.\"  \"Has he any suspicion of you?\"  \"Yes; I put my foot in it the other night.\"  \"How's that?\"  \"I saw him sleeping like a boy, and thought there was no danger of his waking up, so I took the liberty to explore his pockets. Before I could say Jack Robinson he had me by the throat, and wanted to know what I was after.\"  \"That was awkward. How did you get out of it?\"  \"Lied out! Told him I was looking for matches, as I wanted a smoke.\"  \"Did he swallow it down?\"  \"He didn't contradict me, but it has made him watchful and suspicious. If I'd got the money, I was ready to make tracks, and leave them to find their way as they could.\"  At this point the two rose and walked away, leaving Harry in his position behind the tree. As soon as he thought it was safe he came out, and made the best of his way to the inn, getting there about fifteen minutes before Fletcher appeared, but without the landlord. During that interval he had time to communicate what he had heard to Obed Stackpole.  \"Just what I expected!\" said Obed. \"The treacherous skunk! So he's in league with the landlord, is he? I'll fix him.\"  He cautioned the two boys not to show by their manner that they had made any discovery, but to appear as usual.  The next morning the party started as usual. They plodded on for almost a mile, when Obed, turning quickly to Fletcher, said:  \"Let me look at that weapon of yours a minute.\"  Fletcher unsuspiciously handed it over.  \"I think I shall _keep_ this, Fletcher,\" said Obed, eying him steadily. \"I'm pained to have to bid you good-by.\"  \"What does all this mean?\" blustered Fletcher.  \"It means that your room is better than your company. We'd better part.\"  \"Would you rob me? That revolver is mine, and I paid for a share of the things in the cart.\"  \"I'll allow you the vally of them and pay you on the spot, but we can't go on together.\"  Suiting the action to the word, Mr. Stackpole handed over a handsome sum of money.  \"But I don't want to sell my revolver,\" repeated Fletcher. \"What am I to do out here alone, and unarmed.\"  \"You'd better go back to your friend Larry Linton. He'll look out for you.\"  \"You will regret this high-handed proceeding!\" exclaimed Fletcher angrily.  \"Maybe I shall, and maybe I shan't,\" answered Obed indifferently. \"I'll risk it.\"  Fletcher halted a moment as if undecided, then turned back, and was soon out of sight.     CHAPTER VIII.  A VICTIM OF TREACHERY.  All the party felt relieved to be rid of Fletcher. Without being able to prove anything against him, all believed him to be unworthy of confidence. Now they were a united party, and whatever might be the hardships of the trip they were ready to sympathize and co-operate with each other.  They had already learned that it was no holiday trip they had undertaken. The bogs have already been referred to. In addition the heat was oppressive in the middle of the day. Then the numerous insects that infest Australia--the ants, flies, and scorpions--were most troublesome. They had to be very careful to avoid being bitten, for the bite of any these is severe and dangerous. On the day succeeding their parting from Fletcher they accomplished but six miles, the road being unusually swampy.  \"I feel about tuckered out,\" said Obed, about the middle of the afternoon, just after he had extricated the team, by great personal effort, from a morass. \"If I'd 'a' known as much of the country before startin' I wouldn't have started at all.\"  \"It's a long road that has no ending,\" said Harry, smiling. He, too, was very tired, but youth is hopeful.  \"It's the worst country I ever travelled in, by a long shot. If I ever make my pile, I'll take the first steamer back to Frisco.\"  \"Who's that?\" suddenly exclaimed Jack.  Obed and Harry, looking up, saw a forlorn-looking figure approaching them. It was a man of middle age, and emaciated in appearance, looking the image of despair. He tottered rather than walked, from exceeding weakness.  \"For Heaven's sake give me something to eat! I am almost famished,\" he cried.  \"Why, certainly, friend,\" answered Obed, rising and advancing to meet the stranger. \"We don't keep a first-class hotel, but you're welcome to what we've got. Are you travellin' alone?\"  \"Yes, if you call it travelling. I've been dragging myself along for several days, hoping to find somebody that would give me aid.\"  \"Well, you've found somebody. Here, sit down, for you don't seem able to stand, and we'll provide for you. Harry, bring some biscuit and cold meat, won't you, and Jack had better build a fire. A cup of tea will put new life into you, my friend.\"  The biscuit were soaked in water and given to the stranger. He devoured them like a man in the last stages of hunger.  \"Go slow, my friend. Your stomach must be weak,\" said Obed.  \"If you only knew the gnawing at my vitals,\" said the new-comer. \"I have not tasted food for three days.\"  \"I never was in that fix, though I did go hungry for twenty-four hours once in Californy. You'd better believe I pitched in when I got to where victuals were.\"  \"How did that happen, Mr. Stackpole?\" asked Harry.  \"I was lost in the mountains,\" answered Obed, \"and couldn't find any trace of a livin' creature except an old miser, who pointed a musket at me, and didn't dare to let me into his hut. I don't think I could have stood it three days.\"  \"That goes to the right spot,\" said the stranger, after he had gulped down two cups of tea. \"Now I'm ready to die without complaining.\"  \"If it's all the same to you, I think you'd better get ready to live,\" said Obed.  \"I'd rather die now than suffer as I have done in the last three days,\"  \"You won't have to. We've got plenty and to spare.\"  \"But I have no money. I have been robbed of everything.\"  \"Robbed! How is that?\"  \"It's rather a long story. You may not have patience to hear it.\"  \"We've got time enough, and patience enough, but perhaps you don't feel strong enough to talk.\"  \"I didn't before you relieved my hunger. The food and the tea have put new life into me, as you predicted they would.\"  \"Then go ahead, stranger. We're all anxious to hear your story.\"  \"I am an Englishman,\" began the unknown, \"and my name is Ralph Granger. When the report reached England of the richness of the Australian gold-fields, I sold out my business, and was among the first to come out here. By the sale of my business I realized about five hundred pounds. Three hundred I left with my wife--I have no children--to keep her while I was gone. It is very fortunate that I took this precaution and left her so well provided for, since, had I brought all my money with me, it would all have been lost.\"  The three adventurers looked at each other soberly. The ill fortune of their new acquaintance did not augur very well for their good fortune.  \"Then you had bad luck,\" said Harry inquiringly.  \"On the contrary I had good luck,\" replied the stranger.  \"Good luck!\" repeated Harry in surprise. \"Then how----\"  \"How did I come into this plight? That is what you were about to ask?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You will soon learn. On reaching this country I was in doubt whether to go to Ballarat or Bendigo, but finally decided upon the latter.\"  \"We are bound for Bendigo,\" said Jack.  \"So I inferred. Ballarat is in a different direction. Very well, I reached Bendigo three months since. For a time I was unlucky. I found next to no gold, and the prices of living used up about all the money I had left after the expense of getting there. Just when I was on the point of giving up in despair my luck turned. I made a strike, and during the next six weeks I unearthed gold to the value of a thousand pounds.\"  \"That certainly wasn't bad luck.\"  \"It was extraordinarily good luck, and naturally drew the attention of the rest of the camp. This was unfortunate, for in such a settlement, as may well be supposed, there are many reckless adventurers, ex-convicts, and men utterly destitute of principle.\"  \"Then you were robbed at the camp?\"  \"Not then nor there. I took the precaution to send the greater part of my money to Melbourne by experts. Destitute and lost, I have six hundred pounds in Melbourne awaiting my arrival, but for all that, I should probably have starved to death but for my opportune meeting with you.\"  \"Come, then, you've got something to live for, after all,\" said Obed.  \"Yes, you are right. Let me once get to Melbourne and I am all right. I shall buy a passage ticket to Liverpool, and carry with me the balance of my money. With all that I have lost I shall go home richer than I came.\"  \"But how did you lose your money?\" asked Jack, who was eager to have his curiosity gratified.  \"When I got ready to leave the gold-fields, there was no party which I could join. I did not like to go alone. In this emergency a man who had been working an adjoining claim offered to go with me. He professed to have been fortunate, and to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26111"],["title","In A New World; or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia (#6)"],["body"," ready to go back to the city. I saw no reason to distrust him, and accepted his proposal. We bought each a horse, made other preparations, and set out together. He won upon my confidence, and I told him everything. He was very comfortably fixed himself, he told me, and was glad he had fallen in with me, as he had been afraid of being robbed on the journey. All went pleasantly for three days, but on the morning of the fourth day when I awoke I found myself alone. A little startled, I felt for my gold, which I carried in a belt around my waist. It was gone, and so was my horse. Of course you guess how it happened. My companion had robbed me during the night, and left me in the woods utterly destitute.\"  \"What was the name of your companion?\" asked Obed quickly.  \"He called himself Fletcher.\"  \"I thought so!\" exclaimed Obed, slapping his leg with emphasis. \"We know the gentleman a little ourselves.\"     CHAPTER IX.  A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE.  \"You have not met Dick Fletcher?\" said Ralph Granger in surprise.  \"Yes, we only parted from him this morning.\"  \"Did he rob you?\"  \"No, but he tried to.\"  Here Obed gave an account of Fletcher's searching his pockets during the night.  \"He thought I was sound asleep,\" he continued, \"and so I was, but it doesn't take much to wake me. When I gripped his throat, he concluded he'd tackled the wrong man.\"  \"Did you part company with him then?\"  \"No; he pretended he had been in search of matches, and I pretended to believe it, but kept a good look-out. Last evening we stopped at the Travellers' Rest, and Harry, here, overheard him and the landlord out in the woods concocting a scheme to rob us, so I just told the gentleman his room was better than his company, and he cleared out.\"  \"I am afraid he will turn up again,\" said Granger apprehensively.  \"We'll try to be ready for him,\" said Obed coolly, \"but I don't mean to borrow any trouble.\"  By this time their new acquaintance had satisfied his hunger. He turned gratefully to Obed Stackpole.  \"How can I thank you for your great kindness?\" he said earnestly. \"I feel that you have saved my life.\"  \"Tut, tut.\" said Obed, \"I've only done as you would have done in my place. Obed Stackpole isn't the man to let anyone go hungry when he has enough and to spare. But finish your story, my friend. How long is it since you parted company with that skunk, Fletcher?\"  \"I think it is only seven days, but it has seemed a month.\"  \"And didn't you meet anybody humane enough to relieve your hunger?\".  \"Yes, during the first four days, but not for the last three. Part of the time I lost my way, and did not meet anyone. I hope you will never know such torments as I have known in that time.\"  \"Amen to that! And now, my friend, what are your plans?\"  \"I should like to go back to Melbourne,\" said the stranger hesitatingly. \"If you say so, we'll fit you out with three days' provisions, and you can push on.\"  \"I hardly like to go alone.\"  \"I am sorry, for your sake, that we are going the other way. You see we haven't made our pile yet, and must go on. I wish we were on our way back, with our pockets well lined. Although you have been robbed, you've got a good sum waiting for you in Melbourne.\"  \"True; I shall be all right when I get there, but as I am at present situated, it seems very uncertain when I shall have that good fortune.\"  \"I'll tell you what you'd better do, Granger. Come along with us, and join the first party we meet bound for the city. You will, at all events, be sure of your victuals till then.\"  \"I believe your advice to be good, and will accept your kind invitation. When I met you I was about worn out, but the tea and food have put new life in me, and my strength has returned.\"  After an hour's halt, the little party resumed their march. They were compelled to go so slowly, in consequence of the difficulties of the way, not caring, of course, to get ahead of the oxen, that Granger was easily able to keep up. He proved to be a pleasant addition to the party, and all were glad to have exchanged Fletcher for him. They were not destined to travel long together, however, for before nightfall they fell in with a party of eight persons bound for Melbourne. The two parties halted, and had a conference. Granger's story being told, they agreed to let him join their party, in consideration of a fair compensation which he agreed to make on his arrival at Melbourne.  \"Good-by, Granger,\" said Obed, as they parted. \"I think you're all right now. I wish you good luck for the balance of your journey.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Stackpole,\" said Granger, grasping the Yankee's hand cordially. \"If I do, I shall feel that I am indebted to you for my good fortune. I shudder to think what would have been my fate if I hadn't fallen in with you.\"  \"Then don't think of it! Good-by. Perhaps we shall meet again.\"  Granger also shook hands with Harry and Jack, and so they parted on the best of terms.  \"I wonder whether we shall meet with any more of that mean skunk Fletcher's victims,\" said Obed. \"He's in a pretty mean business.\"  \"There's no doubt about that,\" said Harry. \"I'd rather live poor all my life than live by fleecing my neighbors.\"  Toward the close of the day they entered a much pleasanter country. In place of sandy clay, baked hard in the sun, alternating here and there with a moist bog, they came to tall grass, trees of great height, and meadows suitable for grazing. The cattle revelled in the rich feed, and Obed suffered them to eat their fill, feeling that they had worked hard and deserved it. Though it was rather earlier than usual, they decided to encamp for the night near the margin of a creek, shaded by trees of a gigantic size.  Harry looked longingly at the clear stream, and a vision rose before him of a pond in his native town where he had been accustomed to bathe.  \"Jack,\" said he, \"let's have a swim.\"  \"I'm with you,\" said Jack promptly. \"I'll bet you a shilling I'll be in the water first.\"  \"I'll make a try for it anyway.\" But Jack, being more simply dressed, was as good as his word, and plunged into the creek first. Harry was scarcely half a minute behind. The boys swam, dived, and frolicked as boys of their age will, and were loath to come out at the last. After their experience of mud and heat the bath seemed to them delicious.  \"I haven't enjoyed myself so much since I came to Australia,\" said Harry with a deep sigh of satisfaction. \"I wish I could have a bath every evening.\"  \"So do I,\" said Jack; \"I mean to have another to-morrow morning.\"  They slept soundly all night, but early in the morning, as consciousness returned, Harry was startled by the sound of hearty laughter. He looked at Jack and Obed in amazement, but both were fast asleep. Indeed, the sound seemed to come from above. He looked up into the tree beneath which they had encamped, but could see no person concealed among the branches. He did, however, notice a peculiar looking bird, and it dawned upon him that the laughter proceeded from it. He remembered now to have heard of the bird peculiar to Australia, popularly known as \"the laughing jackass.\" This was the first chance he had had of hearing it, and he woke up Obed and Jack to hear it also.  \"That beats all I ever heard,\" said Mr. Stackpole. \"I wish he'd tell us what's the joke, and we'll laugh too.\"  This was not the only sound they heard. A flock of white cockatoos were roosting on the tree, and favored the party with their dissonant cries. They are described as having \"most sharp and rasping voices.\"  \"If that's singing,\" said Obed. \"I shan't be afraid to try it myself.\"  \"Don't you sing, Mr. Stackpole?\" asked Jack, smiling.  \"I thought I could once, when I was in my teens. I attended a singing school, and went in the attic one Sunday mornin' to practise. Soon my father was at the foot of the stairs, and asked me what I meant by sawin' boards up in the attic Sunday mornin'.\"  Of course the boys laughed, but in spite of Obed's disclaimer thought they would prefer listening to him to the cockatoos.  They got ready to move at seven, the boys having made sure of a bath first. They were not destined to proceed far, however. About ten o'clock, as they were skirting the woods, six men on horseback rode out from the leafy covert. They seemed inclined to dispute the passage of the party.  \"What can they want?\" ejaculated Harry, with a startled look.  \"I expect they are bushrangers,\" said Obed.    CHAPTER X.  FLETCHER TURNS UP AGAIN.  Harry didn't need to be told that bushrangers in Australia correspond to bandits in Italy and highwaymen in other countries. The escaped convicts and desperate characters who are naturally attracted to a new country, readily adopted the wild and lawless life of the bushrangers. Stories of their outrages were common enough, and among the dangers apprehended in a journey to or from the mines, that of meeting with a party of this gentry was perhaps the most dreaded.  Though Obed Stackpole betrayed no emotion, but was outwardly quiet, his heart sank within him when he saw the bushrangers strung along the road.  \"I guess our trip to the mines must be given up,\" said he in a low voice to Harry.  Meanwhile Harry had been scanning the faces of the men who confronted them, and made a surprising discovery.  \"Look, Obed,\" he said eagerly, \"at that man on the extreme right.\"  Mr. Stackpole did look.  \"Dick Fletcher, as I'm a living sinner!\" he ejaculated.  But at this point the leader of the bushrangers broke silence.  \"Do you surrender?\" he asked in brief, commanding accents.  \"I think we shall have to, squire,\" answered Obed, to whom the demand was naturally addressed. \"But I would like to ask a question or two if you don't mind.\"  \"Go on.\"  \"Are we prisoners of war? I didn't know for my part that there was any war in this country.\"  \"I have no time for foolish discussion,\" was the stern reply. \"You must give up what money you have about you.\"  \"It's mighty inconvenient, squire. I'm a good many thousand miles away"]]]
