[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25396"],["title","Dotty Dimple At Home (#3)"],["body","; and it was in the parlor chamber of that house that Mrs. Parlin and her three children were standing, glad to find themselves together once more, after the night of confusion.  Grandma Read, who was as patient as her daughter, \"tried to gather into stillness,\" and settle herself as soon as possible to her Bible. But the change from the Sabbath-like quiet of her old room to the confusion of this noisy dwelling must have tried her severely.  Mr. and Mrs. Eastman, and Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, were busy enough from morning till night, day after day, searching for missing goods, and aiding the sufferers from the fire. The Eastman mansion was left to the tender mercies of the five children--the Parlins, and Florence, and Johnny.  Master Percy would probably look insulted if he were to be classed among the children. In his younger days he had had his share in ringing people's door-bells and then running away; now, in his maturer years, he did not scruple to tease little folks, when they could be \"tickled with a straw\" held under the chin, or when they were easily vexed, and answered him back with an angry word or a furious scowl. He liked to torture his \"cousin Dimple.\" He said she shot out quills like a little porcupine. She was a \"regular brick,\" almost as smart as Johnny, and that was saying a great deal; for Percy regarded the youthful Johnny as a very promising child. He was sorry to have him corrected for trifling follies. If Percy had had the care of him, the little fellow would not have lived long, for the older brother quite approved of such amusements as crossing pins on the railroad track, running under horses' feet, and walking on the dizzy roof of a house.  Mr. Eastman was always very busy, and his wife had a deal of visiting to do, so it usually happened that Johnny had more liberty than was good for him.  Mrs. Parlin knew this, and did not like to have Dotty thrown very much in his society, but just now it certainly could not be avoided; Dotty's constant desire to \"get out doors and run somewhere\" seemed to be fully gratified, for Johnny despised the inside of a house more than she did, and they both roamed about during the day like a couple of gypsies.  Sometimes Prudy went with them, but their games were rather rough for her taste. Susy and Florence were generally together, painting with water-colors, pasting scrapbooks, and doing a variety of things in which they did not care to have Prudy join. The dear little girl might have been lonely, and possibly grieved, if she had been anything but a \"bird-child.\" As it was, she sang when she had no one to talk with, and, whether the rain fell or the sun shone, always awoke with a smile, and found the world as beautiful as a garden.  She amused herself by writing in her little red journal, which had come out of the fire unharmed. Here is her account of the tragedy:--      \"_July 7th._ I ought to tell about the fire; but I can't write with     mother's pen any more than Zip can write with a sponge.      \"I am so sorry, but a boy fired a cracker. He didn't mean to burn up     the city at all. He just touched it off for fun.      \"There was going to be a procession, but I believe it didn't     _process_. I never saw anything whiz and crack so in all my life!     The fire danced and ran all over the city as if it was alive! It     burnt just as if it was glad of it. The trees are all black where     the green was scorched off. You wouldn't think it was summer. It     doesn't look like winter. Father says it looks like a graveyard.      \"Dotty lost her tea-set. Susy thought she should faint away, but she     didn't--we couldn't find the camphor bottle. A man saved six eggs     and the pepper box.      \"It was real too bad _grandma's_ room was burnt up! When I went into     grandma's room I used to feel just like singing. Mother says that     isn't so bad as wickedness. She says it is 'home where the heart     is.'      \"Dotty hasn't had any temper for five days. Finis.\"  Just about this time a letter came from Willowbrook, saying Mrs. Clifford was quite ill, and asking Mrs. Parlin to go to her. Aunt Louisa said it was fortunate that the children could stay at their aunt Eastman's. She did not know that Mrs. Parlin left them there very reluctantly, having her own private fears that her youngest daughter might fall into mischief.  Dotty kissed her mother good by, and promised to be perfect; but Mrs. Parlin knew too well how the child's resolutions were apt to wither away for want of root.     CHAPTER IV.  PLAYING HINDOO.   \"Johnny, Johnny, come to the window, quick!\" said Dotty; \"see this bird!\"  \"I've seen birds before,\" replied her little cousin, coolly, and walking as slowly as possible.  \"But this one peeps as if he was hurt; see how he pecks to get in.\"  \"Don't you take him in!\" exclaimed Angeline, the kitchen girl; \"it's a bad sign to have birds come fluttering round a window.\"  \"What do you mean by a _sign_?\" asked Dotty, who had never heard of any silly superstitions in her life.  \"Let him alone,\" cried Johnny, \"or you'll die before the week's out, sure's you live!\"  Dotty laughed. \"A bird can't make me die,\" said she, seizing the trembling little oriole, and holding him close to her bosom. \"O, you birdie darling! Did your mamma go 'way off, and couldn't find a worm? Dotty'll be your mamma, so she will.\"  She put him in a basket stuffed with rags, and hung over him tenderly for half an hour.  \"You're bringing down trouble, I'm afraid, child,\" said Angeline, gravely, as she walked back and forth, doing her work.  Mrs. Parlin, away off at Willowbrook, was at that moment bathing Mrs. Clifford's forehead. I think she might have dropped the sponge in dismay if she had known what pernicious nonsense was finding its way into Dotty's ears.  Just as Angeline was in the midst of a ghost story, Johnny rushed in again.  \"Come,\" said he, shaking Dotty by the shoulders, \"let's go play poison.\"  \"O, no, Johnny. I'm hearing the nicest, awfullest story! And then it rains so, too!\"  \"Doesn't, either. Only sprinkles. And when it sprinkles, it's a _sure_ sign it isn't going to rain.\"  \"Who told you so?\"  \"Your grandmother Read. She's a Quaker, and she can't lie. Come, Dot Parlin; if you don't like poison, come out and play soldier.\"  \"I don't want to play a single thing; so there, now, Johnny Eastman!\"  \"Then you're a cross old party, miss.\"  \"I'm not a party at all. I'm only one girl.\"  \"O, Dotty!\" called Prudy from the cellar-way; \"take care! take care!\"  \"So I am taking care,\" returned Dotty, stoutly. \"For my own mother doesn't 'low me to go out doors and get rained on, and he knows it.\"  It was coming, Prudy feared--her sister's naughty temper. She saw a shadow no larger than a man's hand; but it would not do to let it grow. She must brush it away at once.  \"Let's play something in the house,\" said she, quickly.  \"All right,\" returned Johnny; \"only not sit down.\"  \"Yes, let's _do_ sit down,\" interposed Dotty, with a view to thwarting Johnny.  \"Suppose we play Hindoo,\" suggested Prudy, \"if we can get Susy and Flossy into it.\"  \"Play what?\"  \"Why, play we are Hindoos, and live away off in the Indian Ocean.\"  \"Fishes or sharks?\" asked Johnny, growing interested.  \"O, _people_; and they act so queer. Mother played it with us once, when Susy had the toothache.\"  The older girls were hard to be persuaded. They did not like to leave their shell-work; but they came at last.  \"Johnny shall be Joggo,\" said Susy; \"that's a boy's name; Prudy will be 'Drop of Honey,' and Flossy 'Young Beauty,' and Dotty 'Summer Moon,' and I 'Onno.'\"  \"'Young Beauty' 's the prettiest,\" said Dotty; \"if I can't play that, I'd rather stay with my birdie, and not play.\"  \"Why,\" cried Susy, \"how foo--;\" but catching Prudy's eye, she added, \"you may as well be Young Beauty; Flossy wouldn't mind. But now I think of it, Prudy, we can't play school, for girls don't go to school in India.\"  \"Make believe you are boys, then,\" observed Johnny, whose interest in the game had flagged since he knew that Hindoos were not sharks.  \"We'll play it's six o'clock in the morning,\" continued Susy.  \"That isn't school time,\" remonstrated Dotty.  \"O, yes, it is, in India. I'm the teacher. Give me a stick, please.\"  \"Here's my old riding-whip,\" said Flossy, producing it from the wood-box. Things were tucked away in very queer places at Mrs. Eastman's.  Susy tied a string about her waist for a girdle, stuck the whip into it, and began to march the floor with great dignity.  \"Now school has begun. You must all come in, and bow 'way down to the ground, and say, 'O, respected teacher, grant us knowledge.' They are very polite in India.--All but Prudy, she may stay behind and play truant.\"  The three pupils came forward, touched their foreheads to the floor, and repeated the sentence as directed, Johnny rendering it,--  \"O, respectful Susy Parlin, don't you whip me!\"--at the same time turning a somerset.  \"I forgot one thing,\" said the teacher, as her obedient pupils stood upright again, with flushed faces. \"You ought to have brought me a present, every one of you, such as a fig of tobacco rolled up in a banana leaf, or--\"  \"We didn't know you chewed,\" said Florence, laughing.  \"Now you take your seats. No, not there! On the floor! What do you suppose? You're in India, children. There are mats on the floor (we'll pretend).\"  The children seated themselves.  \"O, we ought to say a prayer to the Muse; but I can't remember what it is. No matter. Multiplication Table comes next. Mother says it's just the same thing in India that it is in America.\"  The school repeated part of the table, making very absurd mistakes intentionally. Susy walked the floor like a general. \"Angeline, please look up some more palm-leaf fans, and some splinters of wood.\"  Angeline was the soul of good nature, and left her baking to hunt in the meal-room for the fans.  \"A pretty kind of school!\" growled Johnny. \"Don't they do anything out there in Hindoo but just"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25396"],["title","Dotty Dimple At Home (#4)"],["body","themselves?\"  \"O, we pretend these fans are green, just off the trees. We are studying arithmetic, all so fast, and ciphering on these leaves with reeds--(that's our splinters). Indian boys don't know what slates are. They think these leaves are good enough. They come off of the tallest palm trees. Fans don't grow in this country. Where did you ever see a leaf as broad as this?\"  \"Poh, plenty of 'em in Kennebec County!\" said Johnny, confidently.  \"Now,\" said the teacher, after a few moments of mock arithmetic, \"now I've looked at my watch, and find it's seven o'clock. How _conscionable_ late! And that Drop of Honey hasn't come to school yet! Joggo, you and Young Beauty go and bring her!\"  Prudy, who was sitting at a little distance, under a swing-table, eating ginger snaps, was suddenly seized upon by the two little Indian constables.  \"Why, what an idea!\" said Prudy, with her mouth full; \"I didn't know that was the way to play it.\"  \"Yes,\" said Susy, \"truants must come to school. If they don't come they must be arrested.\"  \"Why, I've _been a-resting_ all the time,\" said Prudy, laughing.  \"Well, that doesn't make any difference, Miss Honey Drop,\" said Johnny, taking her by the shoulders, while Dotty dragged her feet. There was great laughing and scrambling, during which Prudy swallowed a crumb the wrong way, and was finally carried into school on a litter.  \"Now, I should judge,\" said the heartless teacher, looking sternly at the crimson-faced victim, \"I should judge that this wicked creature ought to have a terrific whipping!\"  \"That's so!\" shouted Johnny; \"we found Honey Drop top of a house, firing mud into a man's eyes.\"  \"Yes, so we did,\" said Dotty, fully restored to good humor, \"black mud; Honey's a bad Nindian. If you can't whip her hard enough, Joggie will help.\"  \"There, now!\" said the teacher, after dealing several \"love-pats\" with great pretended force; \"now I should think 'twas time for school to be out. As you go by me, each of you, I must strike you just as many times as you were minutes late. Now go home, and eat rice for your dinners.\"  \"Well, I don't think it's much of a play, any way,\" said Johnny.  \"Who said it was?\" retorted Florence. \"Susy and I didn't want to come down; we did it just to please you.\"  \"Please _me_!\" sniffed Johnny. \"_I_ wanted to play poison, out in the yard!\"  \"I do wish,\" thought Susy, privately, \"that cousin Flossy would be more polite to little Johnny. I really think he wouldn't be so rude if she would treat him as a lady should.\"  \"There's another play we used to have,\" said Prudy, \"where you sit round on the floor, right among the dishes, and eat your supper.\"  \"Well, I declare for it,\" said Angeline, \"those people off there do need missionaries more than ever I thought they did.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Susy, \"they tell such horrid stories to their little children. The children don't dare go out after dark, for they suppose there are demons up in the high trees, just ready to dart down and whisk them off.\"  \"Angeline tells just such stories her _own_ self,\" said Dotty.  \"Then she's a heathen,\" said Florence, who usually spoke the first thought that came into her head.  \"If that's the case,\" retorted Angeline, with dignity, \"you'd better all walk out of this kitchen before you are entirely ruined.\"  As Angeline was evidently in earnest, the children slowly took their way into the dining-room.  \"Are there real live ghosts, though, Susy?\" asked Dotty, anxiously; \"and if a bird comes to the window will you die?\"  \"Why, no, indeed, child! Mother told me once, when I was right little, that I mustn't let people tell me such foolish stories. If Angeline talks so to you, you must stop your ears. Now, remember!\"  Dotty remembered; but she was not quite convinced. Those awful stories might be true, after all; perhaps Susy didn't know.     CHAPTER V.  RUNNING WILD.   You begin to see how the children were running wild at Mrs. Eastman's. One morning Dotty climbed the hat-tree to get away from her cousin Percy.  \"Don't believe 'cousin Dimple' knows a hat-tree wasn't made for little girls to sit on,\" said Percy.  \"No, 'twas made to swing on,\" replied Dotty, tilting herself backward and forward like a bird on a bough. \"I'm going to stay here till somebody carries me off pick-aback.\"  Percy, having nothing better to do, took his little cousin on his shoulders, danced her about the hall and through the house, and finally tossed her backward into a pile of shavings. Dotty sprang up, shook off the shavings, and ran after Percy, laughing so boisterously that Angeline said to the chambermaid,--  \"I know of one person that will be glad when Mrs. Parlin gets back.\"  \"And I know of another,\" replied Janey. \"The child behaved like a lady when she first came; but what can you expect in this house with those boys?\"  \"How's that bird?\" said Percy, as he and Dotty raced through the kitchen. \"Can he stand on both legs yet?\"  \"Yes, indeed! He could stand on _three_ legs if he had 'em. He's most well--I must go and 'tend to him.\"--(\"I wonder what's going to happen that's bad,\" thought she, as she fed the bird in her own chamber with cream biscuit. \"I hope it isn't a fire!\")--\"Why, Johnny Eastman, I shouldn't think your mamma'd let you scream so loud!\"  \"Then you must hear the first time. Come, let's go out and have some fun; mother's gone to Cumberland.\"  As if Johnny did not have fun all day, and every day, whether his mother was at home or abroad!  \"Prudy,\" said Dotty, \"good by, for Johnny 'n' I are going down to the beach to get some shells.\"  Prudy looked up from her writing.  \"Don't go near the water,\" said she; then throwing her arms about her little sister, she sang,--      \"If you love me as I love you,     No knife shall cut our love in two.\"  \"Well, I do,\" replied Dotty, with an affectionate hug, \"and I sha'n't go near the water.\"  \"You won't forget?\" said Prudy, anxiously. \"You know mamma's as afraid of the water as she can be.\"  \"What are you after?\" cried Angeline, half a minute afterwards. \"Of all the rummaging children!\" At the same time she gave Dotty a nice cake warm from the oven.  \"I'm looking for my hat,\" said the little girl, shutting the sink door. \"Last time I saw it 'twas in a barrel somewhere.\"  But it happened to be in a hogshead.  \"I think this is a real nice sort of world,\" thought Dotty, as she and Johnny trudged off in the pleasant sunshine. \"I do think, just to myself--though I wouldn't say it out loud--that I'm as nice as anybody. I don't know what Prudy'd do 'thout me; and I guess Susy'd cry her eyes out!\"  \"What you thinking about?\" said Johnny.  \"O, 'bout a good many things! Let's run; it tires me to pieces to walk!\"  \"Look!\" cried Johnny, \"there's Mandoline!\"  And such a pretty sight as bareheaded Mandoline presented! She was a little Jewess, with such beauty, perhaps, as that of the women we read about in the Bible. She had dark, wavy hair, like sea-foam with ink tipped over in it. Her eyes were like gems; there was a brilliant color in her cheeks, and her mouth was so sweet that      \"Upon her lip the honey bee     Might build her waxen throne.\"  Dotty did not know why she liked Mandoline so well, but like her she did. Mrs. Parlin was afraid Mandoline had not been taught to respect the truth, and had often desired her little daughter not to play with the beautiful Jewess.  But \"Lina\" went to Mrs. Eastman's, and Mrs. Eastman petted her. Dotty thought it could not be wrong to associate with a little girl her auntie liked so well.  \"Come with us, Lina,\" said Johnny.  \"Where are you going?\"  \"Going to make a Bunger Hill Monuement,\" replied Dotty. \"We know where the shells grow real thick.\"  \"But I've lost my shaker. A dog's got it.\"  \"O, no matter, _you_ don't care,\" said Dotty, in a grandmotherly tone, \"for _I_ won't let anybody laugh at you.\"  Lina yielded. The three children tripped along together, taking up Freddy Jackson on the way--a deaf and dumb boy, who only knew when it thundered by the jar he could feel. Everybody was kind to Freddy. Dotty Dimple, with all her faults, was never known to be impatient with the poor boy.  The children reached the sea-shore, which _was_ somewhere \"near the water,\" though Dotty had assured Prudy to the contrary. Shell-gathering is more exciting work than picking strawberries in the country; for strawberries are all very much alike, whereas shells present some variety.  But in this instance it was very dull business, for the reason that there were no shells to be found. They had all become weary of groping about in the sand, when Johnny looked at the bay, and observed a boy coming towards them, rowing a boat.  \"Hilloa, there!\" shouted the boy.  \"Hilloa!\" responded Johnny. \"If that isn't Sol Rosenberg!\" (This was Mandoline's brother.) \"Where you going, Sol?\"  \"Nowhere particular. Get in and go too?\"  \"Yes,\" said Johnny, \"Fred Jackson and I. Fred can steer as straight's a needle. I'll paddle, you know.\"  \"Girls too,\" added Solomon, gallantly.  With one accord the children walked eagerly towards the boat, which, by this time, Solomon had moored against the beach. All but Dotty.  \"Are you old enough, Solly Rosenberg, old enough and know enough not to drown us all to pieces?\"  Young Solomon laughed.  \"If I can't manage a small concern like this!\"  \"But four, and one more, make _five_, Solly!\"  \"You don't say so! Well, I could carry sixteen, if they were all such little snips as you are!\"  \"Dot Parlin thinks she weighs as much as two tons,\" said Johnny, in an irritating tone.  \"I'm dreadful 'fraid,\" murmured the little Jewess, shaking the wayward hair out of her magnificent eyes; \"but I'll go if you will, Dotty Dimple.\"  Dotty shoved her feet into the sand and reflected.  \"My mamma is afraid of the water; but then she was upset in a scursion, and that's why she's afraid.\"  \"What kind of thing is a _scursion_?\" asked Johnny.  \"A Sabbath school picnic. And she wasn't upset either, only she 'xpected to be.\"  \"Come on!\" called Solly. \"All"]]]
