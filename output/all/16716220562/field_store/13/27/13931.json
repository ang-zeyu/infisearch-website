SIEPERT, B.S.  Professor of Manual Arts, Bradley Polytechnic Institute Editor, Shop Problems Series (on tracing paper) Editor, Shop Notes and Problems Department of MANUAL TRAINING MAGAZINE  [Illustration]  THE MANUAL ARTS PRESS PEORIA, ILLINOIS     _Copyright 1916_ The Manual Arts Press  Fourth Edition, 1919     FOREWORD.   Years ago a country boy heard or read that if a simple box having a hole of a certain size were set upon a post in March or early April it would not be long before bluebirds would be around to see if the place would do as a summer cottage. So he took an old paint keg such as white lead is sold in, nailed a cover across the top, cut an opening in the side and then placed it on a post ten or twelve feet high. Only a day or two passed before a soft call-note was heard, a flash of blue, and the songster had arrived. His mate came a few days later and the paint keg with its tenants became the center of interest in my life. A second brood was reared in midsummer and when the cool days of September came a fine flock left for the South. Each year the house was occupied until the post decayed and the paint keg fell down, but in memory the sad call-note is still heard when spring comes, for it is house hunting time once more, and the bluebirds are looking for the home they had known.  That boys elsewhere may know the joy of the companionship of birds, this little book is written. Birds will come and live near the houses of men whenever food and water are to be had, safety from enemies is given, and when homes are built for them to replace the shelters nature offered before men came with their cultivated fields and crowded cities. The following pages give pictures and drawings of houses that boys have built and in which birds have lived. These houses are planned for the species of birds that have become accustomed to civilization so that they will inhabit the houses put up for them.  The author is indebted to Professor Chas. A. Bennett of Bradley Institute and Mr. L. L. Simpson of The Manual Arts Press for helpful suggestions and encouragement; to John Friese for making the drawings; and to the following for the use of the originals of the illustrations which tell most of the story.

Certain varieties of birds will nest in homes built for them if these houses are of the right shape and dimensions. Other birds may be just as desirable but do not build nests and rear their young in boy-made nesting boxes. We are therefore mainly concerned with the first group which select cavities in trees for their homes if nothing better is to be found.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. BLUE BIRDS, ADULTS AND YOUNG BIRD.]   BLUEBIRD.  This bird may be found during the summer months in most of the states east of the Rocky Mountains, Figs. 1 and 59. It spends its winter in the southern states and southward, returning north in March and April. The principal items of food are grasshoppers, caterpillars and beetles. It should have a house measuring about 5\" in length and width, inside measurements, and 8\" or more in depth. The entrance hole should be 1-1/2\" in diameter and placed near the top, so that the young birds cannot get out until strong enough to have some chance of escape from their enemies after they leave the nest. While authorities differ as to the need of cleaning after a season's use, it seems wise to provide the house with some device whereby the bottom may be removed for such purposes. Houses for this species are shown in Figs. 11, 21, 22 and 24.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. (ROBIN)]   ROBIN.  Robins usually announce the coming of spring when they return to their breeding grounds in the northern states, where they are general favorites. Figs. 2 and 60. The nest is usually built of mud and lined with grasses; placed in the fork of a tree or on some sheltered ledge. Robins take kindly to nesting shelves put up for them and it is well to put up several since but one brood is reared in each nest built. This old nest should be removed after the young birds have gone. A simple shelf is shown in the lower left hand corner of the photograph, Fig. 24, as well as in Figs. 20 and 49.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. (CHICKADEES)]   CHICKADEE.  The chickadee is one of the brave little spirits who spends the entire winter with us, Fig. 3. We can be of considerable service to him during the cold weather by providing food shelters. During the summer months his home is usually found in some decaying stump, hence nesting boxes of the rustic type placed in some remote spot of the orchard or park are most attractive to him.   WREN.  When all other song birds fail to take advantage of a house built for them, the wren may still be counted on. Almost any sort of home from a tin can or hollow gourd on up is satisfactory if put in a safe place and provided with an opening 1\" or slightly less in diameter, so the sparrows must stay out, Figs. 4 and 5. Good homes are shown in Figs. 10, 14, 15, 16 and others.  [Illustration: FIG. 4. WREN AND RUSTIC HOUSE.]   HOUSE FINCH.  The house finch has made many enemies because of its fondness for cultivated fruits and berries. However, it has some redeeming features in its song and beauty. The nest is usually placed in the fork of a limb--evergreens being favorite nesting places. The house shown in Fig. 51 is suitable for these birds but is also acceptable to wrens.  [Illustration: FIG. 5. WRENS.]  [Illustration: FIG. 6. FLICKER.]   WOODPECKER.  The favorite of this interesting family is the little downy, Fig. 7. Living largely upon harmful grubs and insects, this bird does an immense amount of good by protecting our forests from insect scourges. Woodpeckers do not build nests as most birds do, but excavate a deep cavity in some dead tree leaving a quantity of chips at the bottom on which the eggs are laid. Nesting boxes should be of the rustic type made as shown in Fig. 12, leaving some sawdust mixed with a little earth in the cavity. These houses should be placed on trees in a park or orchard. Boys should be able to tell the difference between the woodpeckers beneficial to man and the sapsucker whose misdeeds often cause considerable damage to fruit trees. A nuthatch is also seen in Fig. 7 enjoying a meal of sunflower seed.  [Illustration: FIG. 7. DOWNY WOODPECKER (ABOVE) NUTHATCH (BELOW).]   FLICKER.  The flickers spend much of their time on the ground in search of ants which form the larger percentage of their food. Since ants sometimes cause considerable trouble for other birds, a pair of flickers are worth cultivating for the sake of the work they can do. Artificial nesting boxes of sufficient depth and size are quite readily used, Figs. 6, 20 and 25.   MARTIN.  Nearly everyone knows swallows of one variety or another. The most beautiful of the family are the martins, Fig. 8. This bird is of great service against the inroads of wasps, bugs and beetles. It prefers to live in colonies even though the males fight bitterly at times. Martin houses should have at least several rooms, each separate from all the others. Houses have been built to accommodate fifty and more families. Smaller ones are shown in Figs. 8, 9, 13 and 45.  [Illustration: FIG. 8. A MARTIN COLONY.]  [Illustration: FIG. 9. THE PEER GYNT COTTAGE FOR MARTINS.]  Fig. 9 is a miniature reproduction of Peer Gynt's cottage for a martin house. This house was not only an attractive thing to make, but martins selected it for their home during the past summer.     CONSTRUCTION OF BIRD HOUSES.   Bird houses may be divided into three main classes: (1) those made of sawed lumber to specified dimensions; (2) the rustic type made of (a) slabs of wood with the bark left on, or (b) pieces of tree trunk, or (c) of sawed lumber trimmed with bark or twigs; and (3) cement or stucco houses. In each case the entrance should slant slightly upward to keep the rain out.  [Illustration: FIG. 10. WREN"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25990"],["title","Bird Houses Boys Can Build (#1)"],["body","S.]  Almost any sort of lumber may be used, but birds take most readily to that which has been weathered out of doors. A kind should be used which does not warp or check badly; white pine and cypress meet these requirements and are worked with ease. Yellow poplar is used and cedar with or without the bark left on has its friends for houses of the first or second classes.  Nesting boxes of sawed lumber should be painted on the outside to improve their appearance and to preserve them against the effect of the weather. It is often wise to leave a small amount of unpainted surface around the entrance, and all paint should be thoroughly dry before houses are expected to be occupied. Colors selected will depend somewhat upon the neighborhood, but white, grey, dull greens or browns are often used.   DIMENSIONS OF NESTING BOXES.  The following table, copied from Farmers Bulletin, No. 609, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, gives in small space valuable information about dimensions that experience and investigation have indicated as good for particular varieties of birds. This list includes many varieties that do not commonly live in houses built for them, however. As time goes on, we may expect to find more of these birds living in our nesting boxes because they are apt to seek the same sort of home as the one in which they were reared. The table is given to be of service to those wishing to plan new houses not shown here.  _Dimensions of nesting boxes for various species of birds._  =================+==========+==========+==========+==========+=========                  |   Floor  |   Depth  | Entrance | Diameter |  Height     Species.     |    of    |    of    |  above   |    of    |  above                  |  cavity. |  cavity. |  floor.  | entrance.|  ground. -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------                  | _Inches._| _Inches._| _Inches._| _Inches._|  _Feet._ Bluebird         |  5 by  5 |        8 |       6  |   1-1/2  |  5 to 10 Robin            |  6 by  8 |        8 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  6 to 15 Chickadee        |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/8  |  6 to 15 Tufted titmouse  |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  |  6 to 15 White-breasted   |          |          |          |          |         nuthatch |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  | 12 to 20 House wren       |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |     7/8  |  6 to 10 Bewick wren      |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |   1      |  6 to 10 Carolina wren    |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/8  |  6 to 10 Dipper           |  6 by  6 |        6 |       1  |   3      |  1 to  3 Violet-green     |          |          |          |          |          swallow |  5 by  5 |        6 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/2  | 10 to 15 Tree swallow     |  5 by  5 |        6 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/2  | 10 to 15 Barn swallow     |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  8 to 12 Martin           |  6 by  6 |        6 |       1  |   2-1/2  | 15 to 20 Song sparrow     |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [2]    |   [2]    |  1 to  3 House finch      |  6 by  6 |        6 |       4  |   2      |  8 to 12 Phoebe           |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  8 to 12 Crested          |          |          |          |          |       flycatcher |  6 by  6 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   2      |  8 to 20 Flicker          |  7 by  7 | 16 to 18 |      16  |   2-1/2  |  6 to 20 Red-headed       |          |          |          |          |       woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   2      | 12 to 20 Golden-fronted   |          |          |          |          |       woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   2      | 12 to 20 Hairy woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   1-1/2  | 12 to 20 Downy woodpecker |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  |  6 to 20 Screech owl      |  8 by  8 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   3      | 10 to 30 Sparrow hawk     |  8 by  8 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   3      | 10 to 30 Saw-whet owl     |  6 by  6 | 10 to 12 |      10  |   2-1/2  | 12 to 20 Barn owl         | 10 by 18 | 15 to 18 |       4  |   6      | 12 to 18 Wood duck        | 10 by 18 | 10 to 15 |       3  |   6      |  4 to 20 -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------  [Footnote 1: One or more sides open.]  [Footnote 2: All sides open.]   HOUSES OF SAWED LUMBER.  The boy with an outfit of tools at home, or with a teacher of manual training interested in birds, can make all of the houses to be described in this section. Figs. 10 and 11 show simple houses for wrens and bluebirds. Drawings for this type of house are shown in Figs. 14, 15 and 21. While the surfaces of lumber used for these houses may or may not be planed, care must be taken that all pieces are sawed or planed to the correct sizes with edges and ends square and true so there will be no bad cracks for drafts and rain to enter. Be careful to nail the pieces together so that they will not have occasion to crack or warp. A good way to save time and lumber is to prepare a piece of stock, getting it of the right thickness, width and length, and then to saw up this stock on lines carefully laid out as shown in the drawings of the bluebird and wren houses, flicker nest, robin shelf and finch house. The most difficult houses to build are those for martins. In Fig. 45 is given a drawing for a small home arranged to care for eight families, while the photographs, Figs. 8, 9, 38, 66 and 67 show larger, finer and more difficult houses. The doors or openings are 2-1/2\" in diameter and can be made with an expansion bit or a key-hole saw. All of these houses are to be made so they may be cleaned. Sometimes the bottom is hinged on two screws or nails, and held in proper place by a dowel (bluebird house, Fig. 21); or screwed in place (wren house, Fig. 21, and martin house, Fig. 45); or hinged and held in place by a brass spring (wren house, Fig. 14).  [Illustration: FIG. 11. HOUSES FOR WRENS AND BLUEBIRDS.]  [Illustration: FIG. 12. RUSTIC HOUSES.]   RUSTIC HOUSES.  The first group of houses of this type are shown in Figs. 12, 35 and 36. These are made of slabs of wood with the bark left on, and in some cases, of the bark alone if it can be secured of sufficient thickness. It is usually a good plan to drive a sufficient number of nails into the bark to keep it in place, otherwise it will drop off. Houses such as these attract birds that would avoid a freshly painted imitation of some large residence or public building. Figs. 20 and 37 show houses made of a section of a tree split or sawed in halves, the nest cavity hollowed out, and then fastened together again with screws. The top should be covered with a board or piece of tin to keep out rain. The third division of this type of house is made of sawed lumber and then trimmed with bark or twigs. In this way the same frames may be made to appear as very different bird houses when completed. Such houses are shown in Figs. 30 to 34. Sometimes a pail is used for the frame and then covered with bark, as the center house of Fig. 28. This house has a partition placed half-way up making it a two family apartment, and is provided with ventilating and cleaning devices.   CEMENT AND STUCCO HOUSES.  Houses may be cast of concrete as Fig. 39. This requires a mold or form, and takes considerable planning to insure success. A form is made whose inside dimensions are those of the outside of the bird house, and of the desired shape. A second form, or core, to be placed inside of the first form, is made as large as the inside of the bird house. The two forms must be mounted so they will remain in the right relation while concrete is placed in the space between them. After this has set, the forms may be removed, cleaned and used again. The roof is generally made separately and put in position last. Or the roof can be cast as a part of the house in which case the bottom is inserted last. Birds do not take as kindly to this type of house as a rule, as to those made of wood.  [Illustration: FIG. 13. STUCCO HOUSE FOR MARTINS.]  The stucco house has many possibilities. Fig. 38, shows a group of such houses designed to match the general appearance of garages in good residence districts. The frame is made of wood and the stucco applied by one of the methods in use on large houses. Seventh grade boys have made such houses, using 3/8\" material for the frames, tacking on wire netting and then plastering each side of the house in turn with concrete. The sides were given a pebble-dash surface, while the roof was finished with a steel trowel to give a smooth surface that will shed water readily, Fig. 13.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.
