She was plated with iron, which completely protected her inmates from solid shot; she had two two-hundred-pounder Brooke's rifled guns on the inside of this iron encasement, and one port-hole to each of her four sides. She was very unwieldy, but in a body of water like the Albemarle or Pamlico Sound no wooden vessel could cope with her.  Friday, August 25.--I visited Edenton to-day for the first time. It is situated pleasantly on the bank of Edenton Bay, as it is called, but really Albemarle Sound. The people are kind, courteous, educated, and hospitable. There were magnificent residences in the place, each of which was surrounded by a large yard with shade trees, having that comfortable, spacious, home-like appearance, which so many of the buildings in Southern cities present. When the officers of the Valley City first visited Edenton, they were treated very coolly by the people; but gradually they became quite sociable, and we were invited to visit many of the families of the place--in fact, one of our officers afterwards married an Edenton lady. Edenton was a sort of neutral ground, at which the Federal officers and Confederate officers often met. On August 31, the day was clear and cool. Nothing took place of any note except a false alarm that the ram was coming down the river, causing some excitement aboard the Valley City.  Thursday, September 1, 1864, the double-ender Shamrock came up from the fleet. Last night some army gunboats took an armed body of men up the Chowan river, to be landed and marched across to Plymouth for the purpose of destroying the Albemarle. The project was not successful. The day is cool and hazy. The double-ender Wyalusing came up from the fleet during the night. The Albemarle ram is expected out to-night.  2d.--The ram did not make her appearance. The double-enders all went to Edenton. The weather is pleasant.  On the 4th I went to Edenton and spent the afternoon at Mr. B.'s, and made the acquaintance of his daughters. On the 6th, H. T. Wood, paymaster's clerk, and myself, went aboard a tug, and were conveyed to the United States steamer Shamrock, from whence we boarded the Trumpeter, where Dr. P. H. Barton and myself held a medical survey upon H. T. Wood, and sent him to the United States Naval Hospital at Norfolk, Va. I accompanied him. We left the Shamrock at 7 o'clock p.m., in the Trumpeter, and anchored at 1 a.m., September 7th, and at 6 o'clock a.m. weighed anchor, and arrived at Roanoke Island at 8 a.m. We left Roanoke Island at 1 p.m., and at 8 p.m. we changed to the Fawn, and after steaming two hours anchored for the night. On the 8th we weighed anchor at 5 a.m., and changed boats to the Undine at 11 a.m., and arrived at Norfolk at 1 p.m., when I immediately took H. T. Wood to the hospital. I stopped at the National Hotel.  On the 9th I went to Quartermaster's office at Norfolk to procure transportation to Roanoke Island, but I was a half hour too late, the boat Undine having left at 8 o'clock a.m. At 5 p.m. I heard that the Fawn, which had made connection with the Undine in the Dismal Swamp Canal, and the boat I would have been aboard had I not been too late for the Undine, was captured and burned by the Confederates. In the evening I went to the theatre. I passed the time pleasantly at Norfolk in viewing whatever there was of beauty and interest in the place. On Sunday morning I attended service at the Episcopal church, and also in the evening, in company with Mr. Y., of Bellefonte, Center county, Pa. On Monday the 12th, and Tuesday 13th, Mr. Y. and I promenaded the principal streets and visited places of interest.  At 6 p.m., Wednesday, September 14, I left Norfolk in the C. W. Thomas, which steamed to Fortress Monroe, where she arrived at 7-1/2 p.m., when I got aboard the John Farran, and steamed by the way of the Atlantic Ocean to Cape Hatteras, through the Swash, and through Pamlico sound to Neuse river, and thence up to Newbern, where we arrived at 7 p.m. of the 15th. Having expended all the money that I took with me but a few cents, I felt perplexed as to how I should reach the Valley City, which I supposed was at the mouth of the Roanoke river, where I had left her; but on going ashore at Newbern, I soon learned that she was anchored off that place, having steamed there during my absence. I quickly arrived aboard her, feeling delighted that I was once more among my old naval companions. The next thing of interest I learned was, that Newbern was being visited by an endemic of yellow fever.  Having already passed twice through the Dismal Swamp Canal, and would have steamed through it the third time had I not been too late for the boat that was destroyed, but I was destined to pass through it still again on my passage home. Lossing, in his history of the American Revolution, in volume I, page 311, gives a very complete description of the Dismal Swamp, through which this canal passes. He says:      \"Schemes for internal improvements, for facilitating the     development of the resources of the country, often occupied     Washington's most serious attention. At the time we are     considering, he was engaged, with some other enterprising     gentlemen, in a project to drain the Dismal Swamp, an immense     morass lying partly in Virginia and partly in North Carolina, and     extending thirty miles from north to south, and ten miles from east     to west. Within its dark bosom, and nowhere appearing above its     surface, are the sources of five navigable rivers and several     creeks; and in its centre is a body of water known as Drummond's     lake, so named from its alleged discoverer. A great portion of the     morass is covered with tall cypresses, cedars, hemlocks, and     junipers, draped with long mosses, and covered with creeping vines.     In many places it is made impassable by fallen trees, thick brakes,     and a dense growth of shrubbery. Thomas Moore, who visited it in     1804, has well indicated its character in the following stanzas of     his legendary poem, called 'The Lake of the Dismal Swamp:'          \"'Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds--           His path was rugged and sore;         Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,         Through many a fen where the serpent feeds,           And man never trod before!          \"'And when on earth he sank to sleep,           If slumber his eyelids knew,         He lay where the deadly vine doth weep         In venomous tears, and nightly steep           The flesh with blistering dew!'      \"'They tell of a young man,' says Moore, in his introduction to his     poem, 'who lost his mind upon the death of a girl he loved, and     who, suddenly disappearing from his friends, was never afterwards     heard of. As he frequently said, in his ravings, that the girl was     not dead, but gone to the Dismal Swamp, it was supposed that he had     wandered into that dreary wilderness, and had died of hunger, or     had been lost in some of the dreadful morasses.' The poet makes him     say:            \"'They made her grave too cold and damp,             For a soul so warm and true,           And she has gone to the lake of the Dismal Swamp,           Where all night long by her fire-fly lamp,             She paddles her white canoe.            \"'And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,             And her paddles I soon shall hear;           Long and loving our life shall be,           And I'll hide the maid in a cypress-tree,             When the footsteps of Death are near.'      \"Towards the southern portion of the swamp there is a tract covered     with reeds, without any trees. These are continually green, and, as     they wave in the wind, have the appearance of water. On that     account it is called 'The Green Sea.' The eastern borders of the     swamp are covered with tall reeds, closely interlaced with thorny     bamboo-briers, and present almost an impassable barrier even to the     wild beasts that prowl there. Into this dismal region Washington     penetrated, on foot and on horseback, until he reached the lake in     its centre. He circumtraversed this lake, in a journey of almost     twenty miles, sometimes over a quaking bog, and at others in mud     and water; and just at sunset he reached the solid earth on the     margin of the swamp, where he passed the night. The next day he     completed his explorations, and having observed the soil, its     productions, the lake and its altitude, he returned home, convinced     that the immense morass might be easily drained, for it lay     considerably higher than the surrounding country. Through his     influence the Virginia Legislature gave a charter to an association     of gentlemen who constituted the 'Dismal Swamp Company.' Some, less     sanguine of success than Washington, withheld their co-operation,     and the project was abandoned for the time.      \"It was reserved for the enterprise of a later day to open the     Dismal Swamp to the hand of industry. A canal now passes through it     from north to south, upon the bosom of which immense quantities of     shingles and lumber are floated to accessible deposits. By that     canal the swamp might be easily drained, and converted into fine     tillable land. To every visitor there, the wisdom and forecast of     Washington, in suggesting such improvement a hundred years ago, is     most remarkably manifest.\"  Friday, September 16, 1864.--The Valley City left Newbern at 4 o'clock p.m., with Paymaster Louis Sands of the United States steamer Shamrock aboard, and arrived at Roanoke Island on the 17th, at 11 a.m., and at 2-1/2 p.m. left Roanoke Island. At 9 p.m. arrived at the fleet, and put stores, which the Valley City had conveyed from Newbern, aboard the Shamrock. On the 18th, at 6-1/2 p.m., left the mouth of Roanoke Island to go on an expedition up the Chowan river, and arrived at Winton, on the right bank of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25764"],["title","Reminiscences of Two Years in the United States Navy (#4)"],["body","river, at the junction of Meherrin river, at 8 o'clock a.m. of the 19th. Winton was entirely destroyed in the early part of the war, leaving nothing but here and there a wall, a chimney, or foundation wall standing. An armed party went ashore and captured some cotton, and came in contact with some Confederate pickets, with whom they had a little skirmish, or exchange of shots. We left Winton at 4 o'clock p.m., and arrived off Edenton at 9 o'clock p.m., where we anchored for the night. At 7 o'clock a.m. of the 20th we got under weigh, and proceeded to the fleet, where we arrived at 9 o'clock a.m. At 1 p.m. we steamed to the mouth of Roanoke river, where we anchored. On the 22d we got under weigh, and at 1:35 p.m. arrived at Edenton. Captain J. A. J. Brooks, Acting Assistant Paymaster J. W. Sands and myself went ashore, and called on Mr. Samuel B.'s family, and spent a very pleasant time. At 3:40 p.m. we returned aboard, and proceeded to our old anchorage at the mouth of Roanoke river. The weather was cloudy and hazy. On Friday 23d, at 12-1/2 p.m., the ram Albemarle made her appearance at the mouth of Roanoke river. We immediately fired our signal gun, and got under weigh, and steamed towards the United States steamer Otsego, commanded by Captain Arnold, which was anchored further down the Albemarle Sound. As we passed the Otsego, Captain Arnold ordered the Valley City to steam as rapidly as possible towards the fleet, and the Otsego would follow after. We soon met the fleet steaming towards the mouth of Roanoke river. The Valley City and Otsego soon fell into line, and arrived at the mouth of Roanoke river. By this time the ram had returned up the river. The fleet remained reconnoitering at the mouth of the river till 6 p.m., when it returned to its old anchorage. The appearance of the ram at the mouth of Roanoke river caused some excitement aboard the fleet, for we were anxious to have the ram come out into Albemarle Sound, so as to have a chance, if possible, to sink her. On the 27th, at 11-1/2 a.m., the Valley City steamed down to Edenton, and remained there two hours, and came back to our old anchorage.  On the 29th, at 3-1/2 o'clock a.m., the Valley City weighed anchor, and proceeded to and up Scuppernong river. At 11-1/2 o'clock a.m. we got aground in a position transversely across the river, with the stern of the vessel towards the left bank. About seven hundred yards distant on the left bank of the river, in the bushes and wood, a concealed Confederate battery was situated. In making an effort to get afloat, the guns of the Valley City were run out of position, the decks were crowded with hawsers and ropes, and the propeller had a hawser tangled in it; so that the steamer was in a very helpless and dangerous position. We were not aware that this battery was situated in the place named till at 3-1/2 p.m. they opened fire on the Valley City, and continued firing till half past 5 o'clock p.m. It was some time before the Valley City could clear her decks and get into position to bring the guns to bear on the enemy. In the meantime Commodore W. H. Macomb sent orders to Captain J. A. J. Brooks to blow the Valley City up and leave her as best we could; but when the Valley City got her guns to bear on the enemy's battery, they were silenced at 5-1/2 p.m. The shells and bullets from the Confederate batteries ashore fell around us fast and thick, but fortunately nobody aboard was seriously injured, notwithstanding the vessel was struck several times by shell, and also by a number of bullets. At 9:20 o'clock p.m., after throwing coal overboard, emptying the boiler, and with the assistance of the tug Belle, which came up, we got afloat, and were towed by the tug Belle down into Albemarle Sound, along side of the Otsego. On the 30th the hawser was taken out of the propeller. At 1:15 p.m. the Valley City got under weigh, and steamed alongside of the Tacony for coal.  I append an extract from the _North Carolina Confederate_, published at Raleigh, N.C., bearing on the brush up the Scuppernong river:      \"BRUSH WITH THE YANKEE GUNBOATS.      \"The Goldsborough _State Journal_ gives an account of quite a     spirited little brush between a small detachment of our troops and     some of the Yankee gunboats, which attempted to go up the     Scuppernong river, in which the Yankees came out second best.      \"On attempting to ascend the river, two boats were attacked and     forced back by Lieutenant Sharp, commanding Captain Pitt's company     of cavalry, assisted by two pieces of artillery under Lieutenant     Williams of Lee's light battery, and Lieutenant McWaston of the     50th North Carolina regiment, with thirty infantry.      \"One of the boats got aground at the mouth of the river, about     seven hundred yards from the shore, where she was well peppered for     some time by both our artillery and sharpshooters, one shot     striking her near the water-line.      \"So hot was the fire upon this craft that the Yankees were all     driven from their guns.      \"Three more gunboats at length came up to their relief, and opened     fiercely on our little party, who courageously held their ground     and fought them, till the approach of night and scarcity of     ammunition admonished us to retire beyond the range of the enemy's     guns.      \"We had three men slightly wounded, and one howitzer was somewhat     damaged by a shell.      \"The enemy's loss has not been ascertained, but it must have been     considerable, as their _wooden_ gunboat was aground and under the     fire of our artillery for some three hours, and it was well     ascertained that every man had to seek shelter below from the     deadly aim of our sharpshooters.      \"Hit him again, Colonel W.\"  Mr. Milton Webster, Executive Officer of the Valley City, says of this \"brush\" with the Confederates:      \"It is a pity about that '_deadly aim_,' for we did not have a man     injured, and one of the men and myself were over the stern exposed     to their guns, and though their shot fell all around us, we were     not struck. A pretty correct account of the time of the action and     position of the Valley City is given, but there was not a man left     his station during the action, although their sharpshooters fired     at and left marks of their bullets all round our port-holes, and     the gangway to which we afterwards shifted a gun to bear on them.      \"The three other boats did not even get within range of the enemy,     on account of drawing too much water. They, however, fired one shot     at long range, after the enemy had retired, and this shot was made     merely to get the range of the enemy in case another attack should     be made on the Valley City before she got afloat. One of the two     boats they speak of was a tug-boat that went with the Valley City     up the river to assist her to get afloat in case she got aground,     and was manned by two officers--one an ensign, the other an     engineer--and five men. The tug-boat was not armed.      \"It is very singular that they, in their account of the brush,     should italicize the word _wooden_, as much as to say we had an     iron-clad.      \"I saved one of their shells that lit on the deck of the Valley     City, which fortunately did not explode. If the Valley City had     been afloat, she would have silenced their batteries sooner.\"  On Saturday, October 1, at 4 o'clock a.m., the Valley City got under weigh, and steamed to Edenton. Captain J. A. J. Brooks, Acting Master James G. Green, J. W. Sands and myself went ashore, and visited Mr. Samuel B.'s, and spent the time very pleasantly. At 4 o'clock p.m. we returned to the Valley City, and got under weigh, and proceeded to our old station at the mouth of the Roanoke river. On the 3d, the U.S. steamers Commodore Hull and Tacony and the tug Belle came up and anchored near us. On the 6th, I was ordered aboard the Otsego, to hold a medical survey on one of the officers of that vessel, for the purpose of sending him to the U.S. Naval Hospital at Norfolk. When I returned aboard the Valley City, I found a refugee aboard, suffering from yellow fever. She was taken to Edenton aboard the Valley City, where she died of the disease. We called on Mr. Samuel B.'s family. At 5-1/2 o'clock p.m. we got under weigh, and proceeded towards Roanoke Island. At 12 p.m. we anchored. Early in the morning of the 7th, we steamed to off Roanoke Island, where we arrived at 8 o'clock a.m. On the 8th there was a breeze from the northwest, and the day was clear and beautiful. At 2 o'clock p.m., Paymaster J. W. Sands, Acting Master's mate John Maddock, and myself, with six men, sailed in a small boat to Roanoke Island. There was a heavy sea, and the wind was blowing quite a gale. We landed at Roanoke Island, but did not remain long ashore before we took the boat for the purpose of sailing back to the Valley City. We did not succeed. We then took the sails down, and the men rowed us to the vessel.  On the 9th, at 6 o'clock a.m., we got under weigh, and steamed up to the mouth of the Alligator river, where we arrived at 9 o'clock a.m. The Shamrock was lying close by. The weather was cold. At 1:30 o'clock p.m., the Valley City proceeded up the Alligator river. At 7 p.m. we anchored off Newport News. On the 10th, at 4 a.m., two armed boats' crews were sent ashore on a reconnoitering expedition, but returned at 1 p.m. without accomplishing anything. At 2 p.m. the Valley City got under weigh, and proceeded down Alligator river, and anchored at 3 p.m. The weather is cool, and there was frost last night.  Thursday, October 11th, at 5 a.m., the launches were ordered up Frying-pan river. At 10 a.m. I went with Captain J. A. J. Brooks in pursuit of the launches, and after rowing about six miles we came in sight of them. At 2-1/2 p.m. we returned with the launches. At 4 p.m. the Valley City weighed anchor, and at 8 p.m. anchored in Albemarle Sound. On the 12th, at 6 a.m., we"]]]
