You are welcome to the package!\"  \"You will find out later on,\" Mackinder said, as he started to leave the room in company with Norton, \"that I've been trying to help you out of mighty suspicious circumstances. You are ungrateful!\"  \"Good-bye!\" called out Jimmie. \"Don't slam the door!\"  For a moment the boys gazed at one another in amazement after the two men had left the room. They were excited and puzzled.  \"Well, this is a stunner!\" declared Ned at length.  \"Who is this Mackinder, who is Norton, what is in this 'U-13' package that he wants, how did it get into our baggage, why was it put there, where are we going, when do we eat!\" demanded Jimmie in a breath.  \"That's the way to talk, Jimmie!\" cried Harry, laughing in spite of the situation that the boys all felt to be a serious one.  \"The last question is the most important!\" stated Jack. \"I'm in favor of the eats part and that without further delay.\"  \"Come on, boys,\" suggested Ned. \"Let's eat first and talk things over afterward. I'm nearly famished myself, and Jimmie is hungry, too!\"  In a short time the lads were seated in a quaint restaurant ordering strange dishes. They were hungry, as only healthy, active boys can be. The food was well cooked and appetizing. They ate heartily.  \"Now, I'm in favor of getting to the docks as quick as possible,\" announced Jimmie, pushing his plate away. \"Let's get our passage settled.\"  All were in favor of this arrangement. After paying for their breakfast the lads set out in search of a ship upon which they might secure passage to the United States. But they were not to secure this easily.  Extended inquiry during the forenoon elicited the information that there was no vessel clearing from the port of Amsterdam for any place in America. Although they made every effort to find a steamer which would afford them the accommodations they sought none was found.  Inquiry at the railway station disclosed the fact that their airship, the Grey Eagle, now dismantled and packed in boxes, was at the freight sheds waiting a claimant. Until they could find a vessel to carry it home the boys preferred to let it remain in its present location.  After dinner they continued their inquiries for a vessel. At length they learned of a full-rigged three-masted ship that was to clear in a few days for New York. Regretting even this short delay the lads decided to attempt to secure passage, although the journey would be a long one.  Ned secured the services of a boatman, who offered to row them out to the ship, which lay at anchor in the harbor. The man charged them what the boys considered an extraordinary price for the service, but explained that the weather was unfavorable and that at any moment a storm might break. To this the boys could but agree. A glance at the sky convinced them that a storm of rather unusual violence was gathering.  \"Take him up, anyhow, Ned!\" urged Harry. \"We want to get home!\"  \"All right, then, here goes!\" declared Ned, stepping aboard the waterman's craft. \"Pull away, my friend, we're all aboard.\"  In a short time the man was threading his way amongst the shipping in the harbor. From their position so low upon the water the masts and spars of the vessels looked to be of extraordinary height to the boys, who viewed every object with keen interest.  A hail from the boatman was answered by a man from the deck of the ship. He thrust his head over the rail inquiringly.  \"Where's your captain?\" asked Ned, as the man appeared.  \"What do you want of the captain?\" asked the man in a surly voice.  \"We want to talk with him,\" replied Ned. \"We'll explain to him.\"  \"He's busy now and don't want to be disturbed. Tell me what you want and I'll give him your message. Maybe he'll see you!\"  \"We want to arrange passage on your ship to the United States.\"  \"I'll see what he's got to say,\" replied the man, moving away.  While he was gone the boys examined the vessel closely. Jimmie pronounced the vessel very much to his liking. He admired the lines and pointed with pride to the modeling of the stern.  \"Hello!\" the boy cried excitedly, his arm extended still in the act of indicating the ship, \"there goes our friend Mackinder in a launch!\"  \"Where?\" asked Ned eagerly, turning about in his seat.  \"Right astern of us!\" replied Jimmie. \"I wonder what he was doing aboard this ship. He seems to be in a hurry to get ashore.\"  \"Maybe he wasn't on this ship at all,\" was Harry's objection. \"He might have been out on the harbor for a pleasure ride.\"  \"Sure, he's just the chap to take a pleasure ride on the harbor with a storm brewing! I've got a picture of that chap joy-riding!\"  \"I hope he doesn't see us,\" declared Jack. \"He might have enough influence with the captain to prevent our securing passage on this ship.\"  The conversation was interrupted by the advent of the captain, who looked over the rail at the little craft riding alongside.  \"What do you want?\" he inquired in a business-like tone.  \"We want to arrange passage on your ship to New York, Captain,\" stated Ned respectfully. \"We understand you are to sail soon. We are citizens of the United States homeward bound. Can you help us out?\"  \"Not this trip!\" decided the captain instantly.  \"We are able to pay well for our accommodations,\" continued the boy. \"It is rather important that we get home as quickly as possible.\"  \"Possibly,\" returned the captain shortly.  Nonplussed, Ned was at a loss to find words with which to urge his request further. The captain's distant manner gave him no encouragement.  \"We'll not be the slightest trouble, Captain,\" the lad presently continued. \"We understand you'll be loaded in a few days and will sail for New York direct. Cannot you arrange to accommodate us?\"  \"This isn't a passenger vessel,\" stated the captain.  \"Well, then, couldn't we sign articles and work our way over? We'd be willing to pay whatever you think is right for that privilege.\"  \"You want to get me into trouble with the authorities, don't you?\" replied the other, preparing to move away.  \"But, Captain, just think a moment. There must be some way in which you can arrange it. Don't leave us in a foreign country!\"  \"You seem to have done pretty well in foreign countries as it is! If you can pull off the stunts you have just done I guess you'll get over to New York all right--if that's where you want to go!\"  \"What do you mean? I don't understand you!\"  \"Oh, you don't, eh? Well, to put it plainly, this is a peaceable, neutral ship doing honest trading. I carry freight, not spies!\"  With these words the captain disappeared. The boys gasped in astonishment at the words and looked at each other speechless.  Ned motioned to the boatman to return to the dock. His puzzled frown showed plainly that the boy was at a loss to understand the situation.  \"I've got it!\" almost shouted Jimmie, as the lads were once more on land. \"I know what the answer is! I've been reading my little dream book!\"  \"All right, wise man, let's have it! Don't keep it bottled up!\"  \"Mackinder!\" declared Jimmie impressively.  \"You don't mean to say that he beat us to the ship and managed to get the captain to refuse us passage on his vessel?\" asked Ned.  \"I believe I'm right at that!\" maintained Jimmie, stoutly.  \"Then the only thing we can do is to try to find some coasting vessel to carry us out of the Zuider Zee into the North Sea and make a port in England. We can then go overland to Liverpool and get a ship from there home. Suppose we try that?\" offered Ned.  The boys were passing along a covered dock at the moment. As they turned a corner they saw Mackinder standing near. A smile of triumph lighted his face.     CHAPTER IV  THE LENA KNOBLOCH   \"What did I tell you?\" inquired Jimmie, as the boys passed the man. \"There he stands with his arms folded and grins like a cream stealing cat! I wish I had a half a brick! We'll have to watch out for him!\"  \"It surely looks as if you were right, Jimmie!\" assented Ned.  \"But what gets me,\" put in Harry, \"is why he should be after us! What have we done? He seems to have information that we're criminals!\"  \"It looks mighty strange that he should have stolen the package out of that hut and then continue to insist that we have it,\" remarked Ned. \"Are you sure he's the same fellow, Jimmie?\"  \"It's the very same hand,\" declared the lad, \"and that hand is a dead give away! I wonder he didn't wear a glove or bandage!\"  \"Maybe he didn't have time when he got the package,\" explained Jack. \"Can anyone tell me how the thing got into our kits?\"  This question was unanswerable by any of the lads. Puzzling over the strange adventures they had recently encountered the lads proceeded to their hotel, where they spent some time in freshening both themselves and their uniforms and in rearranging their baggage.  At supper time they were tired and very hungry. At the first opportunity they proceeded to the restaurant where they had formerly eaten.  Jimmie's spirits revived as food was set before them. In a moment he was laughing and chatting away without a care in the world. His good humor was infectious. Soon all four boys were in a merry mood.  \"I wish we could get a civilized paper,\" declared Jack at length. \"I'd really like to see what's going on in the world.\"  \"Maybe we can get one at the desk. Or possibly the cashier can tell us where they will have English papers for sale,\" suggested Harry.  \"Here comes a man who looks as if he were a native,\" spoke up Jimmie. \"I'll bet he can tell us a whole lot of things we want to know!\"  The boys glanced up to observe a man approaching their table. He was evidently a seafaring man. His dress and manner betokened the deep sea mariner. A decided air of the ocean marked him to the boys' eyes.  \"Goot efening, Chentlemen!\" the stranger said as he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25798"],["title","Boy Scouts in the North Sea; Or, The Mystery of a Sub (#4)"],["body",".  \"Howdy!\" replied Jimmie, with a wave of his hand. \"What'll you have?\"  \"Vell,\" replied the visitor, \"schnapps vas goot, but you couldn't get 'em here. Dis isn't no blace for dot! No, sir!\"  \"I wasn't inviting you to have a drink,\" snapped Jimmie somewhat confusedly, \"I meant to ask you what's on your mind.\"  \"So-o-o-o!\" exclaimed the newcomer with a long drawn expression of surprise. His shaggy eyebrows raised as he extended his chin and shrugged his shoulders, pantomiming an apology. \"So, dot's it, eh?\"  \"Sure thing!\" answered Jimmie, regaining his composure in a measure but with his face still flushed. \"We want to know what you're after.\"  \"Vell,\" went on the visitor, \"my name's Captain Johannes von Kluck. Don'd forgot dot 'Captain' part, eider. Und I haf learned dot you chentlemans vas lookin' for a fine, fast ship. Und I have chust dot!\"  As he made this announcement Captain von Kluck smiled a wide look of friendship at the entire party. It was a wonderful smile, beginning at the tiny wrinkles surrounding the corners of his eyes. From there it spread all over his face, gradually distorting the features until, as Jimmie afterward declared, the boys were forced to smile in spite of themselves.  \"And where does your fine ship go, Captain von Kluck?\" asked Ned.  \"Chust vherefer you vant to go!\" declared the captain solemnly. \"Me, I am a goot navigator, und mine mate he is, too, a goot von!\"  \"We want to go to New York,\" continued Ned. \"If you can arrange to furnish us passage to that port, we'll pay you well.\"  To this the captain answered by spreading his hands and shrugging his shoulders until they nearly reached his ears. Over his beaming face spread a look of despair. He slowly shook his head.  \"To New York I cannot go!\" he answered dolefully. \"Bud I vill put you ashore in England, und from dere you can easy get a ship!\"  \"Well, that's better than nothing at all!\" admitted Ned.  \"Sure!\" declared Jimmie. \"Anything to get out of this place!\"  \"When can you be ready to sail, Captain?\" inquired Ned.  \"Who, me?\" questioned the captain in a tone of surprise.  \"Nobody else but you, your crew and we boys!\" laughed Ned.  \"Sure! Dot's all ridt!\" nodded von Kluck. \"Vhell, I'm ready now. Yet I haf some cheeses on board to put, und some odder tings!\"  \"Can you accommodate the boxes containing our airship?\" asked Jimmie. \"We have the Grey Eagle over here at the railroad station and don't want to leave it behind us when we leave the country.\"  \"Maybe it vould on de schip go!\" consented von Kluck.  \"Hurrah!\" exultantly cried the lads. \"That's fine!\"  \"How big is your ship, Captain?\" asked Ned, \"and what's her name?\"  \"Mine schip is der Lena Knobloch!\" smiled the captain. \"Dot's vot you English beoples call garlic. Und id vas a goot schip alreaty!\"  \"Well, then,\" suggested Ned, \"suppose the captain takes supper here as our guest. Two of us will remain with him to arrange details while the other two hasten away and get a truck to take the boxes to the dock. Can you give us directions for reaching the vessel, Captain?\"  \"Sure,\" assented the captain, seating himself. \"Und I know a man vot vould haul your goots, too. I get him,\" he added.  \"In that case, we'll all go over together,\" proposed Jack. \"I don't like the idea of separating while we're in a strange town.\"  \"Perhaps the captain can tell us where we can get some English papers,\" ventured Jimmie. \"We'd like to get the latest news.\"  Wheeling in his chair the captain bawled out an order in Dutch. A waiter came bustling up with an air of deference. Evidently he knew the captain and understood that no delay would be tolerated.  A few words were rapidly spoken, whereupon the waiter hastened away to return presently with several newspapers. These were spread upon the table before the boys, who began a perusal of their contents.  \"Gee whiz!\" exclaimed Jimmie, glancing at the headlines of the paper which had fallen to his lot. \"Listen to this--three vessels sunk in the mouth of the Mersey river by a German submarine identified as the 'U-13.' Then there's been two vessels sunk at the mouth of the Thames!\"  \"What sunk them?\" inquired Harry.  \"It says here that they were sunk by a German submarine. In each case the diver has been identified as the 'U-13' by the crews of the ill-fated vessels. Now, that's going some!\"  \"Let's see,\" pondered Harry, \"the Thames is the river leading to London, while the Mersey is the river leading to Liverpool.\"  \"Right you are, Old Scout, go to the head of the class!\"  \"Hush, Jimmie, no nonsense!\" cautioned Ned.  \"What I was thinking about,\" continued Harry, \"is the distance a boat would have to travel to get from one place to the other. It must be all of seven hundred miles around Land's End. A boat would have to be speedy to cover that distance so quickly!\"  \"How quickly?\" demanded Jimmie. \"The paper says the three ships were sunk at the Mersey on Wednesday morning. Those at the Thames, or rather 'off Margate,' as the article states, were sunk Thursday afternoon. That wouldn't be such an impossible feat after all!\"  \"Twenty miles an hour sustained speed for about twenty-eight hours is running along at a pretty good clip, just the same!\"  \"Well, the vessel did it!\" declared Jimmie. \"The paper says that about six o'clock Wednesday morning the Wanderer, a vessel laden with foodstuffs from Australia, was hailed by the crew of a submarine. They were permitted to take to the small boats and then the Wanderer was torpedoed, going down at once. The submarine was positively identified as the 'U-13.' Then the other paragraph says that at about eight o'clock on Thursday evening the steamer Adventure from Buenos Ayres with a cargo of flour for London was treated in the same manner off Margate by the 'U-13'!\"  \"Isn't it a little strange that the submarine should have attacked a peaceful merchant vessel?\" inquired Jack. \"That isn't war!\"  \"Evidently it is the intention to blockade all English ports and shut off the food supply of the nation,\" ventured Ned. \"You see the article relates that all the ships were loaded with food and destined to English ports. It must be a blockade movement!\"  \"Here's an account,\" announced Harry, \"that says a steamer was hailed by a submarine a few miles off the Lizard Head. It escaped by its superior speed, but only by a narrow margin, for the submarine launched a torpedo that barely missed striking the after portion of the ship!\"  \"Maybe it was the same little old 'U-13,'\" suggested Jimmie.  \"Oh, you 'U-13'!\" laughed Jack. \"You're some boat, all right!\"  \"Say!\" shouted Jimmie, jumping quickly to his feet. The boy glanced about the group with startled looks. \"What about that 'U-13' package? Do you suppose it was intended for the submarine?\"  The boys exchanged puzzled looks. Perplexity was expressed in every face. A look of worry began to appear on Ned's countenance.  \"I wonder who Mackinder is and what he has to do with that package,\" the lad said presently. \"Boys, we're surely stumbling into a mess of something. We'll have to be careful!\"  \"Captain,\" demanded Jimmie, turning to von Kluck, \"what do you know about this 'U-13' business? What is the 'U-13'?\"  Leaning back in his chair the captain drew a long breath. He filled a great pipe from a capacious pouch. Gravely he packed the tobacco into the immense bowl, accompanying the procedure with sundry shakes of his head. Not until the pipe was drawing freely did he reply.  \"Ach, id vas vot der Deutsch say it 'Unterseeboot'! You English say it submarine! Und dot liddle schip goes 'Boom'! und down goes der big schips under der vasser! Und dey stay, too!\" he concluded.  \"Yes, we know that,\" assented Jimmie, punctuating his statement with a poke at the paragraph he had just read, \"but who owns it?\"  \"Vhell, der Chermans dey claim to haf a big share in id!\"  \"Then if we start out for England in this Lena Knobloch of yours how do we know that the 'U-13' won't come along and take a poke at us just out of pure spite?\" questioned the lad.  \"Vhell, maybe she vill,\" agreed von Kluck, between puffs. \"Bud if you vhas like me, you iss willing to took a chance. I go, und das Lena goes, und by und by maybe we make blenty money und go ashore to shtay.\"  \"You take it easy, I must say!\" returned Jimmie, somewhat amused.  \"Are you going out just the same, Captain?\" inquired Jack.  \"Sure!\" proclaimed the captain, in no uncertain tones.  \"Then let's be getting that truck and take the Grey Eagle boxes aboard the Lena Knobloch!\" cried Jack. \"The sooner it's over the easier I'll feel. I'm beginning to get nervous about all this 'U-13' business!\"  After paying their bill the boys set out in company with the captain to find the trucker. That individual put up a strong protest at taking out his horses at the unseemly hour, but a piece of coin slipped into his hand at the opportune moment by Ned soon changed his mind.  Another piece of money changing hands at the proper moment secured the consent of the official in charge of the freight sheds to the delivery of the boxes containing the precious Grey Eagle.  Making the affair a pleasure jaunt the lads lost no time in loading the cases aboard the truck. Merrily they set off for the dock.  Upon arriving in the vicinity of his vessel the captain shed his jovial air like an overcoat. He bawled out orders to his crew, emphasizing his commands with sundry fistic punctuations. The men evidently knew with whom they had to deal, for they fell to the work with a will.  The boys turned back to the hotel to secure their hand baggage.  A small cart drawn by two huge dogs was approaching. In the vehicle were some milk cans. The figure of a woman guided the strange team.  \"This is rather early for the milklady!\" laughed Jimmie.  \"That's no woman!\" declared Jack. \"Look at that walk!\"  \"That's Mackinder!\" Jimmie cried. \"See the scar on his hand!\"     CHAPTER V  TWO MYSTERIOUS CHANGES   \"Hey, you!\" shouted Jimmie, dashing across the street in the direction of the queer"]]]
