It looks like a boat, but it isn't; it's a wherry.\"  \"Who allowed thee to go on the water?\"  \"Nobody.\"  \"Did thee think thee was doing right?\"  \"No'm.\"  \"Who rowed the boat?\"  \"Some boys--two--and Johnny, grandma.\"  \"Hasn't thy mother told thee not to go on the water?\"  \"She said I mus'n't sail, and I never. I _wherried_.\"  \"Why, Dotty Parlin,\" said Prudy, \"you'll scare me so I'll never get my breath again! You didn't go off on that bay with some boys?\"  \"Yes, I did,\" replied Dotty, trying to look defiant. \"_You_ wouldn't have dared to, Prudy.\"  \"Thee may get in my lap, Alice, and tell me all about it,\" said grandma Read, laying down her knitting-work.  Dotty curled herself into a little heap in her grandmother's arms.  \"My head aches,\" said she, \"and I love to lay it against your soft _kerjif_.\"  \"Well, dear, so thee may. Now, tell me what made thee go on the water?\"  \"'Cause, 'cause, grandma, Solly Rosenbug asked me to go, and Johnny tried to make me _not_ go. I asked Solly was he old enough, and knew enough, and he said he did; but he didn't any such thing. And grandma, there it was, right in the middle of the solid water! And began to spin and dance round. We couldn't stop it from dancing; the more we held on, the quicker it went. Way up and down, grandma, and the rain raining, and our feet all sopping, and pouring right into that wherry like a--a catara-duct. They were all afraid but me, and I was awful afraid too. You see I thought we should tip right over, and I didn't want to be drowned, and couldn't swim.\"  \"Why, Dotty, how you make me tremble!\" cried Prudy.  \"The way Johnny paddled!\" continued Dotty, triumphantly. \"Solly _said_ he couldn't. I could have paddled better, only I didn't dare to.\"  \"_You_ paddle!\"  \"No, I didn't. The wind blew me so I couldn't; 'twas much's ever I kept in the wherry. I had to hold on to Lina, too; she was just as 'fraid!\"  Here grandma Read pressed Dotty close to her heart, as if she wished to make sure the child was really alive.  \"'He gave his angels charge concerning thee,'\" murmured she. \"Tell me, child, how thee ever got to the shore.\"  \"O, the captain took us in a sail-boat! He called us crazy chickens, but said he didn't scold. I was the first one that saw the sail; and then Solly rowed us to it, and it took us in, just as wet as ever was. Johnny lost that paddle. So we got home; and, O, how my head aches!\"  \"What a strange, strange child to tell a story!\" said grandma Read, shaking her head. \"But I've seen thee before. I understand thy odd ways. Thee is deeply ashamed of such wicked conduct--that I am very sure. Thee must be aware, Alice, that it is only by the Lord's mercy thee is safe on dry land, instead of being drowned in the depths of the sea.\"  Dotty shuddered, and curled her crimson face more closely against the white kerchief.  \"But I will not chide thee now. Thy mother will do what is right and proper when she comes home. But now thee must have a bowl of ginger tea, and go straight to bed.\"  Dotty made no objection. Indeed she was glad to find herself tucked warmly under blankets and coverlets, for she was still chilly, and her head grew worse continually. It was also a great relief to her that she had told the whole story. She knew her father would be sorely displeased; but he had never punished her in his life, and it was not likely he would do it now, while her head ached so dreadfully.  She wasn't going to tell anybody how sorry she was; but she had made up her mind to this--that she would never _look_ at salt water again as long as she lived.     CHAPTER VIII.  MAMMA AND \"LITTLE ME.\"   \"O, dear!\" thought Dotty, as she lay through the long afternoon, wakeful and feverish, \"I should think there was a drum inside o' my head, and somebody was pounding on it,--tummy, tum, tum.\"  Grandma had said it was best to leave her alone, in the hope that she might fall asleep. But the sleep would not come, though dreams did, one after another, like pictures in a panorama.  When she shut her eyes, she could see a little red boat rocking on the water like a cradle; then a great wave would dash against it, and turn it over, with all its passengers. The screaming sea-gulls seemed to be looking far down into the water in search of the sinking children; but the children could not look up to see the gulls, for their eyes were closed, and they were \"drowned in the depths of the sea.\"  Dotty tried to shut out these horrid pictures. If her dear mamma were only here to talk to her, and lay a cool hand on her head--that mamma she had just disobeyed! Then Dotty repeated some verses she had learned long ago:--      \"At night my mamma comes up stairs,--     She comes to hear me say my prayers;     And while I'm kneeling on her knee,     She always kisses little me.\"  When it came to the last line the poor child buried her face in the pillow. Papa was good, and grandma was good; but there was no one like anybody's own mamma, after all.  \"'She always kisses little me,'\" murmured Dotty. \"'She _always_ kisses little me.' She gives me twenty kisses when I go to bed, 'cept when I'm naughty, and then I don't have but ten.\"  Dotty counted the number of knobs on the bureau drawers, and then went on:--  \"I think if I was in my mamma's place, and had _me_ to take care of, I'd throw me out of the window; I wouldn't keep such a girl!\"  Dotty had great satisfaction in scolding herself when she was all alone. It was a way she had of \"doing her own punishing.\"  Presently, while engaged in the soothing business of calling herself names, she dropped off to sleep. She dreamed of red wherries and \"white waves;\" but never once dreamed that her mother had come, and was bending over the bed, actually \"kissing little me.\"  \"Poor thing,\" said Mrs. Parlin to herself, \"if she doesn't have a settled fever I shall be thankful. Will the time ever come when my little daughter will learn to obey her mother?\"  Mrs. Parlin stole out of the room very softly; but a sly little rogue, observing that she left the creaking door a little ajar, watched an opportunity, and stole in on her \"tipsy toes.\" It was \"wee Katie.\" Mrs. Parlin had brought her home, to keep her out of the way of Mrs. Clifford, who was still quite ill.  The first thing which roused Dotty to consciousness was a feeling of suffocation. O, was she in the bay? Was she drowning? Something lay very close over her mouth; but it was not water: in fact it was a pillow; and on the pillow sat little Katie with her whole weight. But being a very restless child, it is not likely she would have remained in that position long enough to strangle her cousin, even if Dotty had not thrown up her arms and released herself suddenly.  \"Why, Katie Clifford, is that you?\"  \"Yes, this is me!\" replied Katie, with a voice as sweet as a wind-harp. \"You didn't know _I_ was comin'. You turned your face away: you wouldn't look to me!\"  \"I s'pose I was asleep, Katie. You didn't mean to sit down on my head, _did_ you, darling?\"  \"Yes, I did meant to. But you is sick. Folks mus'n't talk.\"  \"No,\" replied Dotty, smiling, \"when folks are sick they mustn't talk.\"  \"Well,\" said Katie, putting her finger on her lip, \"_they is_!\"  \"O, Katie!\" cried Dotty, a new idea seizing her, \"where's mother? Did she come with you?\"  Katie shook her head.  \"My dee mamma velly sick.\"  \"Yes, I know; but where's _my_ mamma? Did she come with you in the cars?\"  Katie shook her head again.  \"Who did come with you, then? You didn't come alone?\"  \"No, there was folks.\"  By this time Dotty had sprung out of bed, and was rushing out of the room to learn whether her mother had come. Mrs. Parlin met her at the door.  \"My darling child,\" said she, hugging and kissing her just as tenderly as if she had never been \"wherrying.\" \"You'd better lie down again, and let me bathe your head.\"  Dotty sprang into bed instantly. She was glad her mother had asked her to do something, so she might prove her desire to obey. She liked the touch of those cool fingers on her forehead.  \"O, mamma,\" said she, \"you do make me feel better. It felt a while ago as if they were beating drums in there.\"  \"Is your neck stiff, dear?\"  Katie thrust her little prying fingers under Dotty's chin, tickling her, of course.  \"No, auntie,\" said she, \"'tisn't any stiff, her neck isn't.\"  \"But it's sore, mother. Not so sore, though, as it was when Jennie Vanee and I got caught in the thunder and lightning.\"  After she had said this, Dotty blushed, for the words recalled to her mind another act of disobedience. No wonder she had thought herself such a naughty girl, fit only to be thrown out of the window!  \"What sort of a child has Dotty been since I have been gone?\" asked Mrs. Parlin of Mrs. Eastman, as they both sat by the bedside.  Mrs. Eastman stroked the sheet with her white, jewelled hand before she replied. She was thinking how the little girl had turned the house upside down, and, as she believed, made Johnny more mischievous than ever; so she hesitated a moment.  \"A tolerably good child.\"  This was all Mrs. Eastman could say; and it was as much as Mrs. Parlin had dared hope. She knew how Johnny and Dotty encouraged each other in rude behavior. She looked at her beautiful little daughter with pain, and wondered, as she had many times wondered before, if these bitter experiences she was suffering would ever have the effect to make her a better child.  Dotty did not understand the tender, regretful glance of her mother's eyes. She was not as yet very well acquainted with the English"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25396"],["title","Dotty Dimple At Home (#8)"],["body","nguage, and did not know what \"tolerably\" meant; she supposed it meant \"remarkably.\"  \"It's so queer,\" she thought, \"that auntie should tell my mamma I've been tol'ably good! Why, I haven't, I know I haven't: I've been tol'ably bad!\"  She looked up at her auntie in surprise, and at that moment there entered into her small mind a doubt of Mrs. Eastman's truthfulness. It was a very faint doubt, which she did not express even to herself. It was almost incredible that a grown-up lady should tell the \"thing which is not,\" or even color the truth by so much as the shadow of a shade. Still, when auntie had called Dotty a tol'ably good girl, she must have known it was a mistake!  Dotty did not have a fever; but for several days she was not at all well, and spent most of the time in her grandmamma's room, on the lounge. It would have been a good opportunity for reflection, if Katie had not been in the house. As it was, Dotty did think of her own conduct for several minutes at a time, during the intervals when Katie was not dancing attendance upon her. She decided never to disobey her mother again, and said so. This, you remember, was nothing new; she had made the same resolve fifty times before, and broken it as often.  Johnny, her little companion in naughtiness, escaped without so much as a sore throat; but he suffered in another way. His father, learning of his exploit upon the water, and being greatly incensed, punished him severely. It was not often that Johnny was corrected, and this time he was very indignant. He reflected that if it had not been for Dotty Dimple his sin would not have been found out. Dotty had ceased to be a \"brick;\" she was a tell-tale--a hateful, mean tell-tale; and he wished she would go home and stay there.  \"I'll pay her for this business,\" said Johnny, talking to his boots.  Just how he was going to \"pay\" his little cousin he did not know. As for being sorry for his disobedience, I doubt if Johnny thought of such a thing. He knew he had been in much peril, and now, while the remembrance of the fright was still fresh in his mind, he was not likely to fall into the same temptation again--that was all.  Johnny missed his little lively cousin in his out-of-door sports; but he was so angry with her that he scarcely ever went up stairs to see her; and when he did go, amused himself by putting his mouth down to her ear, and crying,--  \"E, for shame, Dot Parlin! Fore I'd run and tell!\"  But Dotty did not know that her cousin Johnny was harboring such bitter thoughts against her. She had a high temper herself; but anger did not rankle in her heart for days and days, as it did in Johnny's. She was not eager, like him, for revenge.  The Parlins were now making ready to go into their new hired house.  They were all longing for a place they could call \"home.\"  During the few days, while they yet remained at Mrs. Eastman's, very few events occurred which are worth recording. For one thing, Dotty's bird died. She had loved it for its helplessness; but Angeline said,--  \"You needn't be sorry. What did I tell you when you took that bird into the window? I knew something would happen; but didn't know as it would be a boat-wreck exactly.\"  Dotty, and even Prudy, had received some very foolish ideas from Angeline. The Portland fire had affected the Parlin family in more ways than one; and it would be long before the three little girls would settle into their usual quiet habits again.     CHAPTER IX.  THE NEW HOME.   \"Prudy,\" said Dotty, \"you needn't say that word 'wherrying' to me any more. Mamma said there mus'n't anybody tease me about that, because I've--I've repented it all up.\"  \"O, I'm so glad!\" replied Prudy.  \"I'll never take another bird into the window,\" continued Dotty; \"it's almost as bad as a ghost.\"  \"You never saw a ghost, Dotty. Nobody ever did.\"  \"Yes, indeed; Angeline has seen 'em as thick as spatter! They come when you're asleep, and there don't anybody know it. I shouldn't dare open my eyes in the night. They're wrapped in a sheet, all white, and their eyes snap like fire. Angeline says they do.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" said Prudy, stoutly; \"my mother told me 'twasn't true.\"  \"P'r'aps mamma doesn't wake up in the night,\" said Dotty, \"and p'r'aps the ghosts never come where she is. Why, Prudy, they're made out o' nothing! If you stick a knife into 'em it goes right through, and don't touch their blood, for they haven't got any blood. They don't care for knives--they're just like bubbles.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" replied Prudy, again. \"I think it's wicked. My mother wouldn't like it if she knew how much you sat in Angeline's lap and talked about ghosts. _I_ don't want to see any or hear any.\"  \"I do, though!\" cried Dotty. \"I shouldn't be afraid--the leastest speck. I'd go right up to 'em, and, said I, 'How do you do, sir?' And then they would melt like a wink. It blows 'em right out the moment you speak.\"  \"Does it, though?\" said Johnny, who had been listening at the door. \"You don't say so! Call me when you see your ghostses, and let me talk to 'em too.\"  \"And _me_! What _is_ um?\" said wee Katie, toddling in with her mouth full of candy.  \"There, there!\" cried Dotty Dimple, \"you've been a-listening, Johnny Eastman.\"  \"Don't care! 'Tisn't so bad as being a tell-tale, Miss!\" said Johnny, ending the sentence in a naughty tone.  \"Why, Johnny, you mus'n't say that!\"  \"Why, Johnny,\" echoed Katie, \"you _musser_ say _that_!\"  \"Say what?\"  \"Say _Miss_.\"  The children all laughed at this.  \"Come, little ones,\" said Mr. Parlin, appearing at the door, \"put on your hats; we are ready to start.\"  Prudy clapped her hands--an action which cousin Percy did not consider very polite.  \"It shows,\" said he, \"how glad you are to leave us.\"  \"O, but we are going _home_, you know, Percy! Only think of having a home to go to!\"  \"It isn't the burnt one, though,\" remarked Dotty, as she danced off the door-step; \"and I 'spect I'll never see that darling little tea-set any more.\"  The new house was not in the least like the old one. Susy was always bewailing the contrast. She did not like the wallpaper; the carpets were homely; the rooms were, some of them, too large, and the door-yard, certainly, too small.  \"But it's better than nothing,\" said Prudy, who, for one, was heartily tired of visiting.  \"I think,\" said Mrs. Parlin, smiling, \"this is a very good opportunity for my little daughters to learn to make the best of everything. We cannot have the old house, so we will try not to long for it. We never wish for the moon, you know.\"  \"Katie does,\" laughed Susy.  \"We cannot have the old home again, so we will make the new one as happy as we can. Isn't that the best way?\"  \"Of course it is, mamma,\" replied all the children.  \"'Course, indeed, it is!\" said Katie, trying to pull up the carpet in her search for a lost three-cent piece.  \"I'm glad father's dressing-gown and slippers didn't get scorched,\" said Prudy; \"and the piano sounds as sweetly as ever it did. It sounds to me just as if there was a family in there, living inside.\"  \"Like what?\"  \"O, you know there are four parts playing at once, and it seems as if it was a man and his wife, and two children, all singing together!\"  \"I'm glad we brought so many flowers from aunt Eastman's,\" said Susy, brightening; \"now we'll trim all the rooms.\"  \"That is right,\" said Mrs. Parlin. \"This is the first night in the new house: let us make it as cheerful as we can for dear papa. Susy, you may as well practise that new tune he likes so well.\"  \"O, mamma,\" said Prudy, \"I'll tell you what I'll do! I'll make some vinegar candy!--if you'll boil it, you know, and pull it.\"  \"A very brilliant idea, my daughter. Your part will be the looking on, I suppose.\"  \"And what'll _I_ do?\" queried Dotty, twisting the inevitable lock of front hair; \"if papa would only give me some money, I'd go and buy him a present.\"  \"The wisest thing you can do just now, dear, is to wash that berry-stain off your lips; then you may bring me a fresh ruffle to baste in the neck of this dress.\"  Dotty obeyed at once. She was always glad to wear that white delaine with the scarlet spots.  The whole family were so very busy during the afternoon, that they forgot to feel any regrets for the old home. The furniture had been brought and arranged some time before, and the most Mrs. Parlin expected to do to-day was to make the house as pleasant as possible. Susy was allowed to attend to the flowers; the three others looked on, and watched Mrs. Parlin, while she made vinegar candy, filled some tarts with jelly, and helped Norah set the supper-table.  \"How nice!\" said Prudy, rubbing her hands. \"Sometimes I don't much care if our house was burnt up.\"  \"Nor I either,\" said Dotty. \"This house has got a good deal the best places to hide in.\"  Mrs. Parlin smiled, in her sweet, contented way. She was thinking how many blessings we can all find in our lot if we only look for them. Not that she would ever have known about the \"nice places to hide in\" if the children had not mentioned them.  \"Dotty,\" said she, \"you may run up and ask grandmother if she will dare drink any coffee to-night.\"  Prudy and Dotty tripped up the broad staircase, which wound about so much that Prudy said it twisted her like a string. Katie ran after them, catching her breath.  There sat the dear grandmamma, knitting some winter stockings for Prudy. There were no curtains at the windows, and the August sunshine fell on her calm face, bathing it with warm light. The carpet had not been put down yet, and the children's feet made a hollow sound on the bare floor.  \"Why, grandma,\" said Prudy, \"it wouldn't be nice here a bit, only the room has got _you_ in it!\"  \"Bless thy little heart, Prudence! It will be nice enough here to-morrow night. I wouldn't have thy mother touch it to-day.\"  \"I've got a gamma to my house,\" said Katie, passing her little fingers over Mrs. Read's white kerchief; \"but um don't have hang-fiss on um neck.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Read, in"]]]
