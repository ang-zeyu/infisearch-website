I want to see you!\"  The pseudo milk vendor gave a quick glance at the approaching boy. A street lamp cast a flickering glare upon the automatic which Jimmie had drawn from his pocket. Without waiting to explain or ask questions the person addressed deserted the dog team instantly.  With but a single look over its shoulder the figure darted toward a building at the head of the quay. Boots clattered on the pavement, while the long stride clearly indicated to the boys that Jimmie and Jack had been correct in their surmise that the garb of a woman milk vendor had been assumed as a disguise.  Although Jimmie's speed was great, the lad's sprint was not sufficient to permit him to overtake his quarry.  \"He'll never make it!\" declared Jack, tugging away at his own automatic and preparing to follow his comrade.  \"Come on, fellows, let's get a move on!\" suggested Harry. \"That fellow will just about get into a corner somewhere and knock Jimmie over the head. He's capable of worse than that, I believe!\"  All three lads hastened after the fleeing figure of their red-headed chum and the one whom he was pursuing.  An open door in the building indicated that the race had turned in that direction. Producing an electric searchlight Ned urged caution. Directly the lads heard the sound of a falling body. This was at once followed by an exclamation of surprise and disgust. They recognized the tones as those of their companion.  \"Are you there, Jimmie?\" called Ned, swinging the beam from his searchlight about the interior, lighting up a collection of merchandise piled in the warehouse. Jimmie was nowhere to be seen.  \"Where could he have gone so suddenly?\" queried Harry.  \"Maybe Mackinder hit him over the head!\" ventured Jack.  \"Mackinder better be careful how he monkeys with this crew!\" was Harry's belligerent comment. \"Maybe that guy'll get all that's coming to him and get it right in the neck!\"  For a moment the boys stood listening intently for some indication of the presence of their comrade. Once Ned thought he heard a soft footfall. He put out his hand to touch Jack on the arm.  \"Ss-s-sh!\" he hissed. \"What was that?\"  \"Rat, maybe!\" suggested Jack. \"Turn your searchlight this way a minute. I want to see where this passage leads.\"  Ned swung the searchlight in the direction indicated. Its lance of flame pierced the gloom, revealing tiers of boxes and piles of bags and bales heaped up in orderly array. Sufficient space had been left between the heaps of merchandise to provide passageway.  \"Come on,\" cried Jack, \"we're losing time standing here!\"  Scarcely had the boy uttered the words ere an object came hurtling through the air. It struck the searchlight fairly upon the lens. There was a quick cry of distress from Ned, a rattle of broken glass, the tinkle of the falling searchlight. For a moment complete silence reigned. The next instant there was a rush of a heavy body.  Taken by surprise the boys were not prepared for the onslaught. They went down like ten pins. Harry received a blow on the jaw that nearly put him out for the count. Jack declared afterwards that his stomach would never cease aching from the punch that landed there.  Ned had been bringing up the rear of the little party, hence suffered least. He felt about quickly for the searchlight as he lay on the floor. Before he could recover it the boys heard the outer door slam and knew that someone had passed out of the building after the sudden attack. Who it might have been they could only conjecture.  \"Oh, my poor jaw!\" groaned Harry. \"I'm knocked out!\"  \"No, you're not!\" protested Ned. \"That only shook you up!\"  \"Sure!\" agreed Jack. \"Shook us all up so we'll get a little more 'pep'. Let's hurry up and follow that guy!\"  \"Wait a minute,\" objected Ned. \"We want to find Jimmie first!\"  \"Right-O!\" agreed Harry. \"I think my jaw is better now. Where are we going, anyway? Do you suppose that was Jimmie that floored us just now? Maybe he thought Mackinder had pals coming in!\"  \"I don't believe it,\" stated Ned. \"Jimmie must have known that Mackinder was alone with the milk wagon. He also knew that we would follow him here. Possibly the lad is farther along in the warehouse, lost amongst this merchandise. That must have been Mackinder!\"  \"You're right, Ned!\" declared Jack. \"He probably misled Jimmie in here and then dashed out as we came in!\"  \"But where is Jimmie now?\" queried Harry. \"I don't hear him!\"  \"Oh, Jimmie!\" called Ned in a loud tone.  To this hail there was no answer. Complete silence reigned.  \"That's mighty funny!\" puzzled Harry. \"Get your searchlight and let's hunt him up. He can't have gotten far away.\"  A short search by all three boys resulted in the recovery of the searchlight. Beyond the damaged lens the instrument had suffered no injury. It was still serviceable and cast a strong beam of light.  By its aid the lads followed the passage, stepping rapidly forward. They were becoming alarmed over the failure of their chum to respond to their calls. All feared that Mackinder might have done the lad harm. Momentarily their anxiety increased.  \"Here's a side passage!\" declared Harry, who brought up the rear of the little procession. \"Where does this go?\"  \"Wait a minute with that searchlight, Ned!\" called Jack, who followed Ned closely. \"Throw it back here a minute for Harry!\"  Before the light could be brought into service Harry had taken a step into the passage he had just discovered. A sharp cry of surprise brought Jack and Ned to his side in an instant.  The lads saw Harry bending over the form of their missing chum. Jimmie lay in a heap, blocking the passageway.  Fearful that their first suspicions had been correct, the boys scarcely dared investigate. Jack began growling out uncomplimentary remarks concerning Mackinder. Ned quickly forced his way to Harry's side.  \"Here, let me see him!\" Ned cried, throwing the flame of his searchlight on the recumbent form. \"Why, he's all huddled up!\"  \"All in a bunch!\" agreed Harry. \"I wonder if he's hurt!\"  \"Roll him over,\" directed Ned. \"Let's get him out of here!\"  \"Why, he's tied!\" cried Harry, in a startled voice.  \"Tied?\" questioned Jack, pushing forward. \"Who tied him?\"  \"And gagged!\" went on Harry, his voice vibrating with indignation. \"Mackinder will pay for this!\" the lad continued. \"We'll get him!\"  Without the loss of a moment Harry was swiftly relieving Jimmie of the object which prevented speech. A small block of wood had been forced between Jimmie's teeth. This had been secured in place by tying a handkerchief over his face. The gag had been extremely effective, even though it was uncomfortable and crude.  As the gag was removed Jimmie wagged his jaw a few times to relieve the strained muscles. He nodded his appreciation.  \"How are you feeling, Jimmie?\" was Ned's solicitous inquiry.  \"All right,\" replied the lad. \"Untie my hands, will you?\"  \"Gee, but you're an artist, Jimmie!\" cried Jack. \"We'll get you a job as 'Tricko, The Handcuff King'! I want to say right now,\" the boy went on in mock seriousness, \"there are very few people who can tie themselves up so completely and so quickly as this job has been done!\"  \"You win the argument!\" decided Jimmie, ironically. \"If I get my tutor where I can lay hands on him I'll show him a trick or two that wasn't in the first chapter. He's in for some instruction all right!\"  \"What happened, Jimmie?\" asked Ned, carefully passing his knife through the bonds that confined the other's hands and feet.  \"Well, when I came slamming along into the warehouse I was only a few feet behind the milk maid!\" began Jimmie. \"I at once crept in on tiptoe, because I reasoned that he would be slugging along, making considerable noise. I didn't know that there were goods in here.  \"I couldn't see him anywhere. From that I concluded that he had either stopped or had taken to tiptoeing, too. I had my 'gat' ready and started in. I felt along the bales and boxes a ways. Just as I heard you fellows come into the door something tripped me and down I went.  \"Before I could say a word he had shoved that thing into my mouth, pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket, tied it around my face and then tied my hands together under my knees. Say,\" the lad continued earnestly, \"that guy never got his knowledge out of a correspondence course! He's been there and helped skin 'em! He's smooth!\"  \"Where's your automatic?\" asked Harry.  \"I don't know,\" replied Jimmie. \"Let's have the bug a minute. I'm sure I heard it fall, but I can't say whether Mackinder got it or not!\"  \"Mackinder?\" questioned Ned. \"How do you know it was he?\"  \"Because as he was tying my hands together I had a chance to feel of the back of his right hand. I could feel the scar as plainly as could be. It was the same scar I saw before he started to run and the same scar I saw when the 'U-13' package was pinched!\"  \"I'd like to take a poke at him just for luck!\" declared Jack.  \"I don't know about that,\" stated Jimmie. \"I can't help but admire a fellow as capable as he is. He tied me up so quickly and cleverly and yet so effectively. I'd like to take lessons of him!\"  \"Here's your gun!\" joyously announced Harry. \"And here's the milkmaid's dress he shed in here after he trussed you up.\"  \"Now, then,\" began Ned, as the party was again complete and ready for action, \"let's get out of here and get our baggage.\"  \"Let's get Mackinder first,\" proposed Jack.  \"I vote 'No' on that question, Mr. Chairman!\" declared Jimmie.  \"Why?\" questioned Jack, with surprise. \"What's the matter?\"  \"Well, there are several matters!\" declared Jimmie. \"I don't feel that we'd gain anything by chasing him. The 'U-13' package is not in our possession and he knows it. Besides, he's a clever guy and we might get the worst of it if we step out of our way to go after him.\"  \"I agree with Jimmie,\" announced Ned. \"Let's get aboard the Lena Garlic and get started on our way as soon as possible.\"  \"You mean Lena Knobloch!\" corrected Harry.  \"It's the same"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25798"],["title","Boy Scouts in the North Sea; Or, The Mystery of a Sub (#6)"],["body","g!\" declared Ned. \"Knobloch means garlic!\"  \"All right, then, let's get going!\" agreed Jack.  The boys lost little time in proceeding to their hotel, where they went directly to their room. Here a scene of confusion awaited them. Their possessions lay scattered around in disorder.  \"Well, Great Frozen Hot Boxes!\" cried Jimmie. \"What's this?\"  \"Mackinder and Norton again, I'll bet my head!\" said Jack.  \"Weren't satisfied with their first search,\" agreed Jimmie.  \"Came back here and went through everything. Then I'll bet Mackinder grabbed that milk cart and dogs, slipped on an old lady's dress and chased down to the dock to see if he could stop us!\" put in Jack. \"When he found we were armed he just cut it and ran away!\"  \"Boys, we will do well to pack up and get aboard that vessel as quickly as possible!\" declared Ned. \"Through a mistake we're under suspicion, and it won't pay us to remain here another minute!\"  Replacing their belongings in the bags with skill and despatch the lads were soon ready. They at once proceeded to the dock.  Tramping aboard they proceeded to the cabin at the after end of the vessel. Entering they discovered Captain von Kluck seated at the little table. Before him was a bottle and a glass.  \"Well, Captain,\" began Ned, \"we're here and ready to go!\"  \"So-o-o?\" queried von Kluck. \"Vhell, if you're reatty to go, vhy go! But you don'd go on dis schip. Vhe don'd carry bassengers!\"     CHAPTER VI  A DIFFICULT DEPARTURE   Astounded at the statement of the captain, whom they had begun to regard as a friend but whose present manner indicated anything but friendship, the boys glanced at each other in some degree of alarm.  \"Just what do you mean by that, Captain?\" inquired Ned. \"I thought it was understood that we were to have passage on your boat!\"  \"Vhell, den I forgot dot vhe don'd carry bassengers!\"  \"And I suppose it took Mackinder to refresh your memory!\" snapped Jimmie, stepping forward with an outward thrust of his chin.  At the mention of Mackinder's name the captain gave a quick start. His glance at Jimmie was one of uneasiness and alarm.  \"Vot do you know about Mackinter?\" he inquired.  \"I know this,\" stated Jimmie, angrily. \"He's a fake and if you know when you're well off you'll let go your lines right now!\"  \"Yes, Captain,\" added Ned, \"we found Mackinder trying to detain us because he fancies we have done something wrong or because he thinks we have something he wants. Who he may be we don't know!\"  \"I know!\" stated the captain, stoutly. \"I know dot feller is a officer in der British army, und vhen he says shtay, den I shtay!\"  \"An officer in the British army!\" gasped Jimmie.  \"I think I see now why he wants that package!\" declared Ned. \"He thinks that we are bringing some instructions or something to the submarine named 'U-13' and he's trying to intercept the despatches!\"  \"Well, he's welcome to the 'U-13' package as far as we're concerned!\" maintained Jimmie. \"What we want is to get home to the little old U. S. A., and that right quick. So, Captain, we'll go now, if you please!\"  \"No!\" decided the captain bluntly. \"Vhe don'd go!\"  \"But you may listen to reason!\" said Jimmie, drawing his automatic. \"I don't like to hold you up, but you're going to get out of town right now and we're going with you!\"  \"Put dot gun oop!\" cried the captain, starting from his seat.  \"I will on one condition!\" declared the boy. \"If you get under way at once without any more monkey business I'll keep it in my pocket. If you don't I'll use it! We are neutral and we're going to remain neutral if we have to fight to do so!\"  \"Vhell, I guess dere's no real goot reason vhy vhe shouldn't go, anyhow!\" decided the captain. \"Mackinter don'd got no license to shtop us. Aber he don'd like id, he couldt lump id!\"  \"Now you're talking sense!\" declared Jimmie. \"But, remember! No tricks, or we'll feel like starting something ourselves!\"  \"All right!\" consented von Kluck, secretly anxious to help the boys. \"Chust come along und make me leaf port. Dot let's me ouid!\"  Upon von Kluck's appearing at the companionway the crew immediately assumed an air of attention. Some were grouped about the capstan, where they were watching the sky and speculating on the character of the approaching storm. Others were occupied at various duties about the vessel. Every man seemed to stand in fear of the captain.  Bawling out a hoarse order, von Kluck at once assumed command of the deck. Lines were thrown down from the belaying pins. A group of men tailed onto the halyards, hoisting the foresail, staysail and jib.  The Lena Knobloch was a schooner-rigged vessel with two masts. The boys noted with a considerable degree of satisfaction that she was built along clipper lines, vastly different from the round-bowed type of vessel commonly seen in those waters.  Under jib, staysail and foresail the vessel swung around as the dock lines were let go. Gathering speed with the force of a favorable wind the little vessel plunged ahead. Von Kluck was evidently planning on leaving the harbor without the use of a tug--a somewhat difficult, if not dangerous, experiment.  Urged by the vociferous driving of the mate men were already hauling on the halyards of the mainsail. With the added press of sail the Lena Knobloch heeled over until her lee rail was nearly awash.  A strong wind was coming out of the northwest, favoring the maneuver of von Kluck, but kicking up considerable commotion on the harbor. Waves were running so high as to make navigation of small craft exceedingly difficult if not dangerous.  Carrying full staysail, jib, foresail and mainsail the schooner plunged into the waves, sending cascades of water over her forecastle with every leap. She was loaded deeply and the boys could see that she would prove to be what the sailors term a \"wet ship.\"  Every moment the speed was increasing. The mate had trimmed the sheets to the exact point for greatest efficiency.  Suddenly all hands were startled by a hail from a point on the starboard bow. They saw a small motor boat riding dizzily upon the crest of a wave one moment to be dropped out of sight in the trough the next.  \"Ahoy, the Knobloch!\" came a cry.  \"Ahoy, the launch!\" bawled out the mate in a voice of thunder. \"What do you want? Stand off or we'll run you down!\"  \"We want those passengers of yours!\" was the reply.  \"All right, come on and get 'em!\" yelled the mate above the noise of singing wind in the rigging. \"We can't stop now!\"  \"If you don't heave to I'll fire!\" was the answer.  \"Good night!\" cried Jimmie from a position near the lee rail, where he could look out beneath the main boom. \"That's Mackinder!\"  A revolver shot sounded amidst the tumult of rushing waters and singing rigging. The echo was quickly bitten off by the rising wind. The shot sounded dully above the humming and roaring.  Before Ned could detain him Jimmie fired. Faintly the boys heard a crash aboard the motor boat. The green starboard sidelight of the launch disappeared. Urged on by the tremendous press of wind in her sails the Lena Knobloch was fast dropping the launch astern.  No other shots were fired at the schooner. Scrambling from his position at the starboard rail Jimmie made his way aft to a point beside the helmsman. Here he peered eagerly into the darkness astern.  \"I can't see them at all!\" he announced, turning presently to his companions, who were grouped about the little skylight.  \"Perhaps we've shaken them off for keeps!\" ventured Jack. \"Did you see who that was with Mackinder?\"  \"I thought,\" said Harry, \"that it was his pal, Norton!\"  \"Well, they're safely out of reach now!\" declared Ned. \"I'm glad of it, too! If we can hold on at this gait we'll soon reach a port in England, where we can transship the Grey Eagle and get home.\"  \"I only hope the real 'U-13' doesn't come along and demand that package from us!\" laughed Harry. \"They might take a notion to send us to the bottom if we don't deliver it on demand!\"  \"Let us hope they're busy on the west coast of England by this time!\" suggested Jack. \"I don't want any more 'U-13' in mine!\"  \"Vhat's dot about der 'U-13'?\" inquired von Kluck, coming up to the little group. \"Is id der 'U-13' dot you're skipping?\"  In a few words Ned related the important details of their experience with the 'U-13' package and with Mackinder.  \"And so,\" the boy concluded, \"we were just hoping that the real 'U-13' wouldn't show up and claim the package that we haven't got!\"  \"No danger!\" reassured von Kluck. \"Dis vindt keeps dose fellers under vasser deep! Dey like rough vedder not at all!\"  \"Hurrah!\" joyfully cried Jimmie. \"Blow, winds; blow hard!\" the lad continued, stretching his hands to windward in an appealing attitude. \"Blow hard enough to keep the submarines submarooned!\"  A laugh went round as the boys listened to Jimmie's coined word. They were all heartily in sympathy with the expressed wish that the wind would blow hard enough to keep the submarines from the surface.  \"But, den,\" continued von Kluck, with a frown that wrinkled his heavy brows, \"dot's not all. Dere's mines floatin' round der Nord Sea dot dem verdom Deutsches blanted. Maybe vhe hit one of dem und if vhe do--\"  Here the captain shrugged his shoulders, spreading his hands palm upward and extending them with a final toss aloft to indicate the hopelessness of a situation such as he intimated might befall them.  \"Can't we dodge a mine?\" queried Jimmie.  \"Sure, if vhe can see id!\" declared von Kluck.  \"That's the trouble,\" explained Ned. \"These mines float deep and before a ship can know of its danger--Bang!\"  \"Well, Ned,\" announced Jimmie with a grin, as he wrinkled his freckled nose, \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll bet you my old hat that if we do hit a mine and get blown up I go higher than you do!\"  \"All right,\" agreed Ned, laughing in spite of the seriousness of the situation. \"We'll ask von Kluck to be the judge.\"  \"Von Kluck don't seem to be very much worried over the prospect of hitting a mine!\""]]]
