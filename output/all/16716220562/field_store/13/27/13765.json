PREFACE   As this little book goes to press, Massachusetts, by an act of its legislature, is made the fourteenth state in this country that requires the pupils in the primary, as well as in the higher grades of public schools, to be taught the effects of alcoholics and other narcotics upon the human system, in connection with other facts of physiology and hygiene.  The object of all this legislation is, not that the future citizen may know the technical names of bones, nerves, and muscles, but that he may have a _=timely=_ and _=forewarning=_ knowledge of the effects of alcohol and other popular poisons upon the human body, and therefore upon life and character.  With every reason in favor of such education, and the law requiring it, its practical tests in the school-room will result in failure, unless there shall be ready for teacher and scholar, a well-arranged, simple, and practical book, bringing these truths down to the capacity of the child.  A few years hence, when the results of this study in our Normal Schools shall be realized in the preparation of the teacher, we can depend upon her adapting oral lessons from advanced works on this theme, but now, the average primary teacher brings to this study no experience, and limited previous study.  To meet this need, this work has been prepared. Technical terms have been avoided, and only such facts of physiology developed as are necessary to the treatment of the effects of alcohol, tobacco, opium, and other truths of hygiene.  To the children in the Primary Schools of this country, for whom it was prepared, this work is dedicated.

JOINTS AND BONES.   [Illustration: L]ITTLE girls like a jointed doll to play with, because they can bend such a doll in eight or ten places, make it stand or sit, or can even play that it is walking.  [Illustration: _Jointed dolls._]  As you study your own bodies to-day, you will find that you each have better joints than any dolls that can be bought at a toy shop.   HINGE-JOINTS.  Some of your joints work like the hinges of a door, and these are called hinge-joints.  You can find them in your elbows, knees, fingers, and toes.  How many hinge-joints can you find?  Think how many hinges must be used by the boy who takes off his hat and makes a polite bow to his teacher, when she meets him on the street.  How many hinges do you use in running up-stairs, opening the door, buttoning your coat or your boots, playing ball or digging in your garden?  You see that we use these hinges nearly all the time. We could not do without them.   BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS.  All our joints are not hinge-joints.  Your shoulder has a joint that lets your arm swing round and round, as well as move up and down.  Your hip has another that lets your leg move in much the same way.  [Illustration: _The hip-joint._]  This kind of joint is the round end or ball of a long bone, which moves in a hole, called a socket.  Your joints do not creak or get out of order, as those of doors and gates sometimes do. A soft, smooth fluid, much like the white of an egg, keeps them moist and makes them work easily.   BONES.  What parts of our bodies are jointed together so nicely? Our bones.  How many bones have we?  If you should count all your bones, you would find that each of you has about two hundred.  Some are large; and some, very small.  There are long-hones in your legs and arms, and many short ones in your fingers and toes. The backbone is called the spine.  [Illustration: _Backbone of a fish._]  If you look at the backbone of a fish, you can see that it is made up-of many little bones. Your own spine is formed in much the same way, of twenty-four small bones. An elastic cushion of gristle (grĭs´l) fits nicely in between each little bone and the next.  When you bend, these cushions are pressed together on one side and stretched on the other. They settle back into their first shape, as soon as you stand straight again.  If you ever rode in a wheelbarrow, or a cart without springs, you know what a jolting it gave you. These little spring cushions keep you from being shaken even more severely every time you move.  Twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side, curve around from the spine to the front, or breast, bone. (_See page 38._)  They are so covered with flesh that perhaps you can not feel and count them; but they are there.  Then you have two flat shoulder-blades, and two collar-bones that almost meet in front, just where your collar fastens.  Of what are the bones made?  Take two little bones, such as those from the legs or wings of a chicken, put one of them into the fire, when it is not very hot, and leave it there two or three hours. Soak the other bone in some weak muriatic (mū rĭ ăt´ĭk) acid. This acid can be bought of any druggist.  You will have to be careful in taking the bone out of the fire, for it is all ready to break. If you strike it a quick blow, it will crumble to dust. This dust we call lime, and it is very much like the lime from which the mason makes mortar.  [Illustration: _Bone tied to a knot._]  The acid has taken the lime from the other bone, so only the part which is not lime is left. You will be surprised to see how easily it will bend. You can twist it and tie it into a knot; but it will not easily break.  You have seen gristle in meat. This soft part of the bone is gristle.  Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people; so children's bones bend easily.  I know a lady who has one leg shorter than the other. This makes her lame, and she has to wear a boot with iron supports three or four inches high, in order to walk at all.  One day she told me how she became lame.  \"I remember,\" she said, \"when I was between three and four years old, sitting one day in my high chair at the table, and twisting one foot under the little step of the chair. The next morning I felt lame; but nobody could tell what was the matter. At last, the doctors found out that the trouble all came from that twist. It had gone too far to be cured. Before I had this boot, I could only walk with a crutch.\"   CARE OF THE SPINE.  Because the spine is made of little bones with cushions between them, it bends easily, and children sometimes bend it more than they ought.  If you lean over your book or your writing or any other work, the elastic cushions may get so pressed on the inner edge that they do not easily spring back into shape. In this way, you may grow round-shouldered or hump-backed.  This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all the room they need for breathing. While you are young, your bones are easily bent. One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you stand unevenly. This is more serious, because you are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],["title","Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#1)"],["body",", and you may grow crooked before you know it.  Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or lame, all your lives.  When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore, break more easily.  You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall, and possibly break their bones.   CARE OF THE FEET.  Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing nails and other sore places on the feet. All of these are very hard to get rid of. No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot.   OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO?  Perhaps some boy will say: \"Grown people are always telling us, 'this will do for men, but it is not good for boys.'\"  Tobacco is not good for men; but there is a very good reason why it is worse for boys.  If you were going to build a house, would it be wise for you to put into the stone-work of the cellar something that would make it less strong?  Something into the brick-work or the mortar, the wood-work or the nails, the walls or the chimneys, that would make them weak and tottering, instead of strong and steady?  It would he had enough if you should repair your house with poor materials; but surely it must be built in the first place with the best you can get.  You will soon learn that boys and girls are building their bodies, day after day, until at last they reach full size.  Afterward, they must be repaired as fast as they wear out.  It would be foolish to build any part in a way to make it weaker than need be.  Wise doctors have said that the boy who uses tobacco while he is growing, makes every part of his body less strong than it otherwise would be. Even his bones will not grow so well.  Boys who smoke can not become such large, fine-looking men as they would if they did not smoke.  Cigarettes are small, but they are very poisonous. Chewing tobacco is a worse and more filthy habit even than smoking. The frequent spitting it causes is disgusting to others and hurts the health of the chewer. Tobacco in any form is a great enemy to youth. It stunts the growth, hurts the mind, and cripples in every way the boy or girl who uses it.  Not that it does all this to every youth who smokes, but it is always true that no boy of seven to fourteen can begin to smoke or chew and have so fine a body and mind when he is twenty-one years old as he would have had if he had never used tobacco. If you want to be strong and well men and women, do not use tobacco in any form.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.            1. What two kinds of joints have you?            2. Describe each kind.            3.

[Illustration: W]HAT makes the limbs move?  You have to take hold of the door to move it back and forth; but you need not take hold of your arm to move that.  What makes it move?  Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open.  This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to the door, out near its edge.  When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and shuts it.  If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again, each time you bend the joint.  What you feel, is a muscle (mŭs´sl), and it works your joints very much as the rubber strap works the hinge of the door.  One end of the muscle is fastened to the bone just below the elbow joint; and the other end, higher up above the joint.  When it tightens, or contracts, as we say, it bends the joint. When the arm is straightened, the muscle returns to its first shape.  There is another muscle on the outside of the arm which stretches when this one shortens, and so helps the working of the joint.  Every joint has two or more muscles of its own to work it.  Think how many there must be in our fingers!  If we should undertake to count all the muscles that move our whole bodies, it would need more counting than some of you could do.   TENDONS.  You can see muscles on the dinner table; for they are only lean meat.  [Illustration: _Tendons of the hand._]  They are fastened to the bones by strong cords, called tendons (tĕn´dŏnz). These tendons can be seen in the leg of a chicken or turkey. They sometimes hold the meat so firmly that it is hard for you to get it off. When you next try to pick a \"drum-stick,\" remember that you are eating the strong muscles by which the chicken or turkey moved his legs as he walked about the yard. The parts that have the most work to do, need the strongest muscles.  Did you ever see the swallows flying about the eaves of a barn?  Do they have very stout legs? No! They have very small legs and feet, because they do not need to walk. They need to fly.  The muscles that move the wings are fastened to the breast. These breast muscles of the swallow must be large and strong.   EXERCISE OF THE MUSCLES.  People who work hard with any part of the body make the muscles of that part very strong.  The blacksmith has big, strong muscles in his arms because he uses them so much.  You are using your muscles every day, and this helps them to grow.  Once I saw a little girl who had been very sick. She had to lie in bed for many weeks. Before her sickness she had plenty of stout muscles in her arms and legs and was running about the house from morning till night, carrying her big doll in her arms.  After her sickness, she could hardly walk ten steps, and would rather sit and look at her playthings than try to lift them. She had to make new muscles as fast as possible.  Running, coasting, games of ball, and all brisk play and work, help to make strong muscles.  Idle habits make weak muscles. So idleness is an enemy to the muscles.  There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you.   WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES.  Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could not work your joints for you as the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of their strength. In this way, people often grow very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will soon learn. But they can not work any better on account of having this fat. They are not really any stronger for it.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. How are the joints moved?             2. Where are the muscles in your arms, which help                 you to move your elbows?             3. Show why joints must have muscles.             4. What do we call the muscles of the lower                 animals?             5. What fasten the muscles to the bones?             6. Why do chickens and turkeys need strong muscles                 in their legs?             7. Why do swallows need strong breast muscles?             8. What makes the muscles of the blacksmith's arm                 so strong?             9. What will make your muscles strong?            10. What will make them weak?            11. What does alcohol often do to the muscles?            12. Can fatty muscles work well?            13. Why does not drinking beer make one stronger?     CHAPTER III.  NERVES.   [Illustration: H]OW do the muscles know when to move?  You have all seen the telegraph wires, by which messages are sent from one town to another, all over the country.  You are too young to understand how this is done, but you each have something inside of you, by which you are sending messages almost every minute while you are awake.  We will try to learn a little about its wonderful way of working.  In your head is your brain. It is the part of you which thinks.  As you would be very badly off if you could not think, the brain is your most precious part, and you have a strong box made of bone to keep it in.  [Illustration: _Diagram of the nervous system._]  We will call the brain the central telegraph office. Little white cords, called nerves, connect the brain with the rest of the body.  A large cord called the spinal cord, lies"]]]
