The judge, \"Your wrath abate.       I must have time to give true judgment here.\"                                    _Cino da Pistoia._      [Imitated by Petrarch in the conclusion of the Canzone, _Quell'     antico mio dolce empio signore_.]   TO ROME      Tell me, proud Rome, why dost these edicts read,       These many laws by prince or people made,       Or answers by the prudent duly weighed,       When now thou canst the world no longer lead?     Thou readest, sad one, of each ancient deed       Where thy unconquered sons their might displayed,       Afric and Egypt at thy feet were laid,       But slavery, not rule, is now thy meed.     What boots it that thou wast of old a queen,       And over foreign nations heldest rein,       If thou and all thy fame no more exist?     Forgive me, God, if all my days have been       Devoted to man's laws, unjust and vain       Unless Thy law within the heart be fixed.                                    _Cino da Pistoia._   JUSTICE      Ah! justice is a virtue bepraised and full of worth,     It castigates the sinner, and peoples all the earth,     And kings with care should guard it--instead they now forget     The gem that is most precious in all the coronet.     Some think they may do justice by cruelty, I wist;     But 'tis an evil counsel, for justice must consist     In showing deeds of mercy, in knowledge of the truth,     And executing judgment it executes with ruth.                                    _Pedro Lopez de Ayala._   THE POET AND THE ADVOCATE       Glory and gain thus mixed distract the thought,     We owe to honour all, to fortune nought;     The poet, like the soldier, scorns for pay     Peruvian gold, but seeks the wreath of bay.     How is the advocate the poet's peer?     The poet's glory is complete and clear;     He far outlives the advocate's renown,     Patru is e'en by Scarron's name weighed down.     The bar of Greece and Rome you point me out,     A bar that trained great men, I do not doubt,     For then chicane with language void of sense     Had not deformed the law and eloquence.     Purge the tribune of all this monstrous growth,     I mount it, and my soul will sink, though loth,     Will yield to fortune and will speak in prose.     But since reform in this so slowly grows,     Leave me my tastes, for I aspire to be     By verse ennobled to posterity,     To hold first place in arts above the law,     More grave and noble than it ever saw.     Fraud in this age of ours unpunished can     Tread down the equity so dear to man.     Can you for spirits just and generous find     A fairer cause to plead before mankind?     Mother or stepmother let Fortune be,     The theatre and not the bar for me;     For client virtue, truth for counsel's wage;     For judge the present and the coming age.                                    _Piron_, _La Métromanie_, Act iii.

In 1882, Leo Pinsker, a Jewish physician of Odessa, disturbed by the pogroms of 1881, made a keen analysis of the position of the Jews, declared that anti-Semitism was a psychosis and incurable, that the cause of it was the abnormal condition of Jewish life, and that the only remedy for it was the removal of the cause through self-help and self-liberation. The Jewish people must become an independent nation, settled on the soil of their own land and leading the life of a normal people. Moses Hess in his \"Rome and Jerusalem\" classified the Jewish question as one of the nationalist struggles inspired by the French Revolution. Perez Smolenskin and E. Ben-Yehuda urged the revival of Hebrew and the resettlement of Palestine as the foundation for the rebirth of the Jewish people. Herzl was unaware of the existence of these works. His eyes were not directed to the problem in the same manner. When he wrote \"The Jewish State\" he was a journalist, living in Paris, sending his letters to the leading newspaper of Vienna, the _Neue Freie Presse_, and writing on a great variety of subjects. He was led to see Jewish life as a phenomenon in a changing world. He had adapted himself to a worldly outlook on all life. Through his efforts, the Jewish problem was raised to the higher level of an international question which, in his judgment, should be given consideration by enlightened statesmanship. He was inspired to give his pamphlet a title that arrested attention.         *       *       *       *       *  He wrote \"The Jewish State\" in a mood of restless agitation. His ideas were thrown pell-mell into the white heat of a spontaneous revelation. What was revealed dazzled and blinded him. Alex Bein, in his excellent biography, gives an intriguing description, drawn from Herzl's \"Diaries,\" of how \"The Jewish State\" was born. It was the revelation of a mystic vision with flashes and overtones of prophecy. This is what Bein says:      \"Then suddenly the storm breaks upon him. The clouds open. The     thunder rolls. The lightning flashes about him. A thousand     impressions beat upon him at the same time--a gigantic vision.     He cannot think; he is unable to move; he can only write;     breathless, unreflecting, unable to control himself or to     exercise his critical faculties lest he dam the eruption, he     dashes down his thoughts on scraps of paper--walking, standing,     lying down, on the street, at the table, in the night--as if     under unceasing command. So furiously did the cataract of his     thoughts rush through him, that he thought he was going out of     his mind. He was not working out the idea. The idea was working     him out. It would have been an hallucination had it not been so     informed by reason from first to last.\"  Not only did the Magic Title evoke a widespread interest among the intellectuals of the day, but it brought Jews out of the ghettos and made them conscious of their origin and destiny. It made them feel that there was a world that might be won for their cause, hitherto never communicated to strangers. Through Herzl, Jews were taught not to fear the consequences of an international movement to demand their national freedom. Thereafter, with freedom, they were to speak of a Zionist Congress, of national funds, of national schools, of a flag and a national anthem, and the redemption of their land. Their spirits were liberated and in thought they no longer lived in ghettos. Herzl taught them not to hide in corners. At the First Congress he said, \"We have nothing to do with conspiracy, secret intervention or indirect methods. We wish to put the question in the arena and under the control of free public opinion.\" The Jews were to be active factors in their emancipation and, if they wished it, what was described in \"The Jewish State\" would not be a dream but a reality.         *       *       *       *       *  The beginnings of the Jewish renaissance preceded the appearance of \"The Jewish State\" by several decades. In every section of Russian Jewry and extending to wherever the Jews clung to their Hebraic heritage, there was an active Zionist life. The reborn Hebrew was becoming an all-pervading influence. There were scores of Hebrew schools and academies. Hebrew journals of superior quality had a wide circulation. Ever since the pogroms of 1881, the ideas of Pinsker and Smolenskin and Gordon were discussed with great interest and deep understanding. There were many Zionist societies in Russia, in Poland, in Rumania, in Galicia and even in the United States. In \"The Jewish State\" Herzl alludes to the language of The Jewish State and passes Hebrew by as a manifestation of no great significance. He has a poorer opinion of Yiddish, the common language of Jews, which he regards as \"the furtive language of prisoners.\" This was obviously an oversight. With the advent of Herzl, however, Zionism was no more a matter of domestic concern only. It was no longer internal Jewish problem only, not a theme for discussion only at Zionist meetings, not a problem to heat the spirits of Jewish writers. The problem of Jewish exile now occupied a place on the agenda of international affairs.         *       *       *       *       *  Herzl was not so distant from his people as many of the Russian Zionists at first surmised. He was familiar with the social anti-Semitism of Austria and Germany. He knew of the disabilities of the Jews in Russia. There are many references in his feuilletons to matters of Jewish interest. He had read an anti-Semitic book written by Eugen Dühring called \"The Jewish Problem as a Problem of Race, Morals and Culture.\" One of his closest friends had gone to Brazil for a Jewish committee to investigate the possibility of settling Jews in that part of South America. In 1892 he wrote an article on French anti-Semitism in which he considered the solution of a return to Zion and seemed to reject it. He wrote \"The New Ghetto\" two years before \"The Jewish State\" appeared. He was present at the trial of Alfred Dreyfus in December, 1894. He witnessed the degradation of Dreyfus and heard the cries of \"Down with the Jews\" in the streets of Paris. He read Edouard Drumont's anti-Semitic journal \"La France Juive\" and said, \"I have to thank Drumont for much of the freedom of my present conception of the Jewish problem.\" While he was in Paris he was stirred as never before by the feeling that the plight of the Jews was a problem which would have to have the cooperation of enlightened"]]]
