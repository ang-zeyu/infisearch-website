Once I felt one of 'em a-twisting and rolling under my foot like a big log that had came to life. I guess I must have jumped twice as high as my own head and I lit on the back of one of the naygurs that was guiding us.  \"He didn't know what struck him; probably thought it was a tiger for I sunk my hooks into his hide. He let out a yell and went ripping and snorting through that jungle and me not having sense enough to let go, until a grape vine about as thick as a manilla rope chucked me under the chin and I fell flat on my back and I guess that naygur is still running.\"  Here the captain who was evidently enjoying the narrative hugely, burst into a volcanic roar of laughter.  \"I can see yer yet, Pete, on that bounding buck of a nigger, and him a-hiking through the jungle and a-yelling like a wild Injun.\"  \"I remember you got out of the way mighty quick,\" said Pete, \"when you heard us a-coming behind you.\"  \"It certainly was a curious spectacle,\" said the Captain, \"but go on with your yarn, Pete.\"  \"The further we went into the jungle the worse it got. The mosquitoes fairly ate us alive and they wern't the only cannibals in those woods by any means. There was a tribe of man-eaters beyond the Big River and we didn't try to capture any of them. They wern't our stripe of bacon.  \"We went on for six days, with the monkeys chattering over our heads all day and the mosquitoes serenading us at night. Talk about birds, there was a whole menagerie of them and their colors beat the handkerchiefs that these greasers wear around their throats and you can't get ahead of that for color.  \"One night we got in range of the village we were after and there was a great pow-wow going on. There was a big fire in the circle of the grass huts and some big black bucks were doing a dance around it. Just then I saw--\"  \"Hold on, Pete,\" said the Captain in a low, gruff voice, \"somebody is coming our way.\"     CHAPTER V  THE FOUR BOYS   \"Hey, Jim, where are we going to make camp?\" It was his brother Jo's genial voice.  \"Not until we can strike water,\" replied Jim. \"No more dry camps for me.\"  \"I don't think much of the coast range, or the Sierras, either.\" It was Juarez Hoskins' well-remembered voice, with its rather low, deep tones.  \"Give me the Rockies every time.\"  Juarez was nothing if not loyal to his mountains.  \"I don't think any of the mountains are much to brag of.\"  It is hardly necessary to say that it is Tom Darlington who is now speaking, for the discerning reader is pretty well acquainted with his style by this time.  \"There's always something to look out for,\" continued Tom, \"if it isn't Indians it's rattlesnakes, and you have got to choose between a cloudburst or no water at all. Give me the East every time.\"  \"You make me exhausted talking about the East,\" said Jim. \"Why didn't you stay there when you were there? I had just as soon take a chance with a rattlesnake as with an ice cream soda.\"  \"Tom would like to _play_ Indian,\" cut in Jo, \"with turkey feathers sticking up from a red flannel band around his head. And creeping upon a flock of sheep pretending that they are antelope and that cows are real live bears.\"  \"Yes,\" said Jim, \"you have lined it out all right, Jo. Then when they were tired of playing Injun, Tom and his little playmates could pretend that they were Daniel Boone's men with wildskin panties on.\"  \"Shut up, boys,\" said Juarez, coming to Tom's rescue. \"What's the use in rubbing it in? The East is all right for some folks and if the boys back there can't have real adventures they have to do the best they can. After all, Jim, you are an Eastern boy. You can't get away from that.\" Jim writhed under the implication but replied good humoredly.  \"You're right, Juarez, old chap, but I can't help stirring up Tom once in a while. It is good for him too. It keeps his liver active, so he won't get bilious.\"  \"Juarez has got more sense than you two put together,\" said Tom.  \"Forget all about it now, Tommy,\" urged Juarez good-naturedly, getting the aforesaid Tommy by the nape of the neck with one vigorous brown hand and giving him a shake.  Thus under Juarez's straightforward management the family quarrel was abated.  \"We might just as well ride now, boys,\" said Jim. \"The horses are good and rested and we will soon be going down grade instead of up.\"  The horses had been following in single file back of the four boys. They were to be trusted not to cut up any shindigs or to wander from the narrow mountain trail. The boys had had them a long time and together they had gone through the numerous hardships and adventures. They were as perfectly trained as Uncle Sam's cavalry horses.  The horses halted as the boys dropped back to their sides, and they swung into the saddle simultaneously. Jim rode in the lead on a splendid gray, with a powerful arching neck, strong shoulders and hindquarters made for speed. Him, he called Caliente. Next rode Tom on a pretty bay. Then Jo on a black of medium size but finely built for speed and endurance. Juarez brought up the rear on his roan, a sinewy animal with a broncho strain in him which was liable to crop out at unexpected moments.  It is to be noticed that there was a certain formation in the way the column rode. Jim, the strong and resourceful in front, and Tom, the less experienced and capable, following, forming the first division. The second division was composed of Jo and Juarez.  Juarez having an equally important position with the leader, for he was rear guard, a more trying position sometimes than being in front for in their travels through dangerous regions, it was the man in the rear who was more apt to be cut off by the wily Indians. But the cool and crafty Juarez was not likely to be caught napping.  Even now you notice as they ride along through the comparatively safe region of the coast range that Jim and Juarez are ever on the alert, glancing this way and that, halting to examine some peculiar mark on the trail, and not a motion of tree or bush upon either mountain slope escapes their attention. They had lived too long in the midst of treacherous enemies, Indians and outlaws, to be taken off their guard. They had been in Mexico on a venture the outcome of which was all their fondest dreams could wish for. Their expedition over, Tom was for going home, to at least deposit the treasure they had gained, but the others had outvoted him, and now the long pleasure trip to Hawaii was their object.  Now, if they but had known it, they were riding to meet the most deadly danger that they had yet encountered. For as you know, Captain Broom and his party were advancing to meet them. In an open or running fight, we know perfectly well that the boys could take care of themselves, but in the skipper of the Sea Eagle, they were to meet a far more dangerous opponent than in Eagle Feather, described in \"The Frontier Boys in Colorado\" or Cal Jenkins in Kansas and in Mexico as detailed in \"Overland Trail\" and in \"Mexico.\" In compliance with a determined plan, they were now on their way to Hawaii.  Not only had Captain Broom the craftiness and cruelty of the Indian, but the cool, hard judgment of the New England Yankee, coupled with a knowledge of their possessions, supposedly limited to themselves alone. The Mexican spy, who had reported the route the boys were going to take, had given the game into his master's hands.  \"I wonder what has become of our one-eyed greaser friend,\" said Jim, \"we haven't seen any sign of him since he gave us the shake a week ago at the hunting camp. I kind of thought we might run across him again.\"  \"It's good riddance to bad rubbish,\" said Juarez in a surly tone. \"If I had my way I'd hang him to the first oak tree on general principles and on account of his personal appearance. I bet he is a treacherous little rat.\"  \"He isn't very pretty, that's a fact,\" admitted Jim, \"but he is a useful little beast about the camp and can do a lot of chores.\"  \"I kind of like to hear him play his guitar,\" put in Jo, \"and sing those Mexican tunes. They certainly sound pretty.\"  \"He's a picturesque beggar too,\" remarked Tom. \"Just the kind that in the old days would have been made a king's jester. They dressed 'em up in a blazing bright style then. That hump would have made his fortune.\"  Tom, as you remember, was an authority on Romance, and as pertaining to which he always carried two favorite volumes, much worn by hard travel and frequent usage, but which no amount of ridicule by his brothers could make him give up.  \"Have it your own way,\" acceded Juarez, \"but he is not the sort of animal that I would recommend for a household pet.\"  \"Well, he is gone,\" said Jim, \"so we don't need to worry about him.\"  \"I don't know but that I would a little rather have him in sight,\" said Juarez. \"Then you know where he is.\"  Jim laughed good-naturedly at the prejudice that Juarez showed against the little greaser and put it down to his darkly suspicious nature acquired by his life among the Indians. It would have been better if Jim had taken more stock in his comrade's suspicions. Now, Jim was not to be caught napping when once an enemy had declared himself, but it was his nature to be open-minded and unsuspicious.  The four Frontier Boys were riding up a winding trail through a narrow mountain valley, having reached a point almost level with the summits, which rose several thousand feet above the eastern plain. It had been a hard, all day climb, and the horses were tired and the gray dust was caked upon their sweaty riders.  Let us take a look at our old acquaintances, Jim, Tom, Jo and Juarez, to see if they have changed any since we saw them last. They are dressed about as we have always known them. In gray"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25473"],["title","Frontier Boys on the Coast; Or, In the Pirate's Power (#4)"],["body","shirts and pants of the same color, moccasins on their feet and on their heads battered sombreros with the flaps turned back.  Their coats are tied back of the saddles, and their shirts open at the throat for the air is hot and dry in that California mountain valley. Their rifles are swung across their shoulders held by straps, revolvers in the holsters at their hips.  Jim sits in the saddle tall and sinewy, grown somewhat thinner by constant exercise and by the drying effect of the desert air. His skin is baked to an absolute brown. Juarez, too, is black as an Indian and he rather looks like one with his hair quite long and of a coarse black fibre. The boys look a little fine-drawn but sinewy and strong and fit for any adventure.     CHAPTER VI  THE HUNCHBACK   The shadows were already falling on that side of the range as the boys rode slowly into a narrow pass. The shade was a decided relief from the glare of the California sun that they had encountered all day.  \"Gosh, but I should like to have a cool breath from the Rockies,\" declared Juarez with emphasis, \"This sort of a climate makes me tired. Nothing but the sun staring at you all the time. It goes down clear and comes up with the same kind of a grin on its face.\"  \"It will be cooler when we get on the other side,\" said Jim, encouragingly, \"and it won't be long now.\"  \"I hope we will strike water on the other side,\" remarked Jo. \"I'm tired of looking at that bald-headed stream down there,\" indicating the dry blistered bed of a former water-course.  Nothing more was said until of a sudden they rode to the top of the Pass, and saw a new landscape spread out before them.  It was a broad and beautiful view, with the sun striking the wide Pacific, with a blazing glare of silver and below the wooded slope of the mountains, stretched an apparently level plain, where roamed countless cattle, and innumerable sheep. It had all the breadth characteristic of the Californian landscape.  \"That's a pretty good looking view,\" remarked Jim admiringly. He would have been still more interested if he could have seen a trim-looking black vessel in a small cove directly west but a good many miles distant.  \"I wonder if it isn't going to rain,\" said Tom. \"See those clouds rolling in over the ocean.\"  \"Rain!\" ejaculated Jim with superior wisdom, a wisdom that appertains particularly to older brothers, \"I guess not. Those are fog clouds. That's a sure sign in this country that it won't rain.\"  \"Well, I'm glad to see them, anyway,\" said Juarez. \"It looks sort of stormy even if it isn't.\"  It was restful, there was no question about that, the change from the constant glare of a white sun in a blue sky, to the soft damp grayness of the fog. It was already rolling over the level plain towards the mountains and, in a short time, a high fog was spread over the whole sky.  The boys had ridden down the western side of the range for a distance of a half mile, when Jim suddenly waved his hand backward in a sign of caution for the column to halt. He leaned forward, looking intently in a northwesterly direction to a point on the opposite side of the mountain valley. Juarez followed the direction of the leader's look with a keen gaze.  \"I was sure that I saw some one slipping through the undergrowth on the opposite side over there,\" Jim finally said, \"but I could not make sure whether it was a man or some sort of animal.\"  \"I noticed the bushes shaking,\" said Juarez, \"but I did not see anything.\"  \"Might have been a brown bear,\" hazarded Jo.  \"They do have them in this range,\" put in Tom.  \"Perhaps it is the bear that we hunted for two days on the other slope,\" said Juarez, \"and he has come to give himself up.\"  \"We had better keep our eyes open,\" advised Jim, though he did not take the trouble to unsling his rifle. \"Jo, you and Tom watch the upper side, Juarez will take care of the trail in front.\"  \"All right, boss,\" said Juarez, cheerfully.  \"How much reward, captain, for the first glimpse of the lost child?\" inquired Jo.  Jim paid no attention to this sally, but kept his eye on the trail ahead. The trees were quite thick on either side of the trail and as dusk was coming on, it was difficult to make out any object clearly.  Just as Jim rode around a turn in the trail, Caliente reared and leaped to one side and a less skillful rider would have been thrown.  \"Easy, old boy,\" said the rider, patting his horse's neck. Caliente stood trembling and snorting and watching a curious object that was struggling up the bank towards the trail.  It was hard to tell what it was, whether man or beast and the dusk only served to make it more obscure. Then the object scrambled up on to the trail and Jim at once recognized the dwarf Mexican with his high-crowned sombrero and his velvet suit richly slashed. With his crooked back and one eye, he was anything but a prepossessing-looking creature. Caliente, when he, too, recognized who it was, put back his ears and rushed with bared teeth for the Mexican.  Spitting out a curse, the greaser jumped to one side with a marked agility, and Jim succeeded after a struggle in bringing his furious steed to terms, but he had his hands full and there were not very many men who could manage Caliente when he got into one of his rages.  \"Hi! Manuel,\" (every Mexican was Manuel to the boys), cried Jim, \"look out for my Tiger, he wants to eat that velvet suit of yours.\"  \"Si, Senor,\" called Manuel from a safe station on a granite rock. \"He is a tiger as your Honor says.\"  One would have expected to hear the crooked little greaser speak in a harsh croaking voice, but instead it had a rich sonorous quality.  \"Do you know where there is any water in this country?\" asked Jo. \"We are as dry as a desert.\"  \"Certainly, Senor, I will show you,\" replied Manuel. (It was true that Manuel spoke in Spanish of which language the boys had a working knowledge, due to their sojourn in the southwest. But I shall put his words in English.) \"Where is Senor Juarez?\" inquired the dwarf. \"I do not see him.\"  \"The Senor is still with us,\" replied Jim, gravely, \"but you cannot see him on account of the dusk, but you might hear him,\" he added in a lower tone.  It was true that Juarez was growling to himself about the greaser for whom you know he had a cordial antipathy, a feeling which was reciprocated by the Mexican.  \"Lead on, Manuel,\" urged Jim, \"we want to make camp before morning.\"  \"But, Senor, the tiger will eat me up,\" objected the Mexican.  \"I will take care of Caliente. He won't bite you. Go ahead.\"  \"Si, Senor,\" assented Manuel.  Then he jumped down from the rock and took the trail at a discreet distance ahead of Jim's horse, who was held in check by his rider though his temper seemed in no wise abated. There was something sinister in the figure of the Mexican as he led the way down the trail.  All in black, except the gray of his hat with its golden cord and the tinsel of his clothes. There was something malignant in his make-up and even the unimaginative Jim was affected by the presence of the Mexican, while Juarez was very uneasy, and asked Jo and Tom to allow him to move up next to the Captain. This they did, though it left Jo as rear guard on that rocky trail.  He seemed quite isolated but he had become sufficiently enured to danger and though he kept a wary eye, he was not nervous. The boys had unholstered their pistols and Juarez kept a straight eye on the moving shadow in the darkness ahead. At the first sign of attack or treachery, he was going to get that particular Manuel.  \"I've got my eye on the little varmint,\" said Juarez in a low voice to Jim. \"He may be leading us into an ambush.\"  \"Oh, I guess not,\" said Jim, with a note of hesitation in his voice. \"We have got to find water anyway. The horses are suffering for it, and this beggar can show us where we can locate it.\"  Just then Manuel threw up his hand with a shrill whistle that had every malignant intention in it. Juarez raised his pistol just ready to fire, when the Mexican laughed shrilly.  \"Senor Juarez very nervous. I just stretch and whistle a little and he want to shoot.\"  A peculiar smile came over Juarez's face, but he said nothing. All the stolid Indian in his nature came to the surface. He merely grunted contemptuously at the Mexican's remark and this made the volatile Manuel uneasy in his turn, for he wanted to realize that his malice had struck home, but Juarez did not give him that satisfaction. There was a sort of hidden duel between these two, the subtle Mexican and the crafty Indian nature of Juarez. It remained to be seen who would win.  The four Frontier Boys went silently along down the dark canyon, each one occupied with his own thoughts and the ill-omened Mexican guide in the lead. Juarez kept a sharp lookout on either side of the trail expecting an ambush. His horse seemed to feel something of the strain his rider was under, as a horse will. Once he shied at something he saw in a clump of bushes, and nearly went off the trail. It was only with the aid of Juarez's horsemanship that he clawed his way back to safety. The Mexican was much amused at this incident, and Jim gave him a sharp call down.     CHAPTER VII  FARMER BROOM   We must now return to Captain Broom and his escort, whom we left sitting on a hill covered with trees near the Sebastian rancho. Old Pete's story had been interrupted by the skipper's warning,--\"Somebody is coming our way.\"  There was no question about that, they could hear the someone coming towards the hill whistling cheerfully. Then the form of a man could be seen, coming up the slope of the elevation.  \"I wonder where those altogether blessed cows are,\" he was heard saying in Spanish, but of course, this is a free and not a literal translation.  \"They are generally hiding under these trees,\" he continued. The sailors kept absolutely still and old Pete covered the bowl of his pipe with his hand so that its light might not discover them.  \"Carambe!\" cried the Mexican"]]]
