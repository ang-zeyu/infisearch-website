Von Scheldmann knocked the top off the wine bottle with a blow from a stone, and, with care to avoid the sharp edges of the glass, he drank long and deep. As he bit greedily into the sandwich, his teeth met on something thin and tenuous, and he pulled the two bits of bread apart. Inside was a scrap of paper. With a curse, he was about to throw the paper away, when some pencilled words caught his eye.  \"I leave it to God,\" he read, \"to decide whether you live or die. If you have not drunk any wine, do not, for it is poisoned. If you have, you are lost, and nothing can save you. The victorious French will find your corpse, and will rejoice. VÃ¦ victis! Woe to the conquered!\"  And even as he read the hurriedly written words, von Scheldmann felt the first awful sense of numbness that presaged the end.     VII  THE ODD JOBS   We sat in a railway carriage and told each other, as civilians love to do, what was the quickest way to end the war. \"You ought to be able to hold nearly 400 yards of trench with a company,\" my friend was saying. \"You see, a company nowadays gives you 250 fighting men to man the trenches.\"  And then the muddy figure in the corner, the only other occupant of the carriage, woke up. \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" he snorted as he tossed his cap up on to the rack, and put his feet on the opposite seat.  \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" he repeated. \"You're lucky if your company can produce more than 150 men to man the trenches; you forget altogether about the odd jobs. Take the company I'm in at the front, for instance. Do you imagine we've got 250 men to man the trenches? First of all there are always men being hit and going sick, or men who are sent off to guard lines of communication, and their places aren't filled up by fresh drafts for weeks. As for the odd jobs, there's no end to them. My own particular pal is a telephone orderly--he sits all day in a dug-out and wakes up at stated hours to telephone 'No change in the situation' to battalion headquarters. It's true that he does jolly good work when the Huns 'strafe' his wire and he has to go out and mend it, but he doesn't go forward in an attack; he sits in his dug-out and telephones like blazes for reinforcements while the Germans pepper his roof for him with 'whizz-bangs.'  \"Then there's old Joe White, the man like a walrus, who left us months ago to go and guard divisional headquarters; there are five officers' servants who are far too busy to man a trench; there is a post corporal, who goes down to meet the transport every night to fetch the company's letters, and who generally brings up a sack of bread by mistake or drops the parcels into shell holes that are full of water; there's a black, greasy fellow who calls himself a cook, and who looks after a big 'tank' called a 'cooker,' from which he extracts oily tea, and meat covered with tea-leaves. Besides all these fellows there are sixteen sanitary men who wander about with tins of chloride of lime and keep the trench clean--they don't man the trenches; then there are three battalion orderlies, who run about with messages from headquarters and who wake the captain up, as soon as he gets to sleep, to ask him to state in writing how much cheese was issued to his men yesterday or why Private X has not had his hair cut.  \"Do you imagine this finishes the list? Not a bit of it. There are half a dozen machine gunners who have nothing to do with company work; half a dozen men and a quartermaster-sergeant attached to the transport to look after the horses and to flirt with girls in farms; two mess waiters whose job it is to feed the officers; and there are four men who have the rottenest time of anyone--they're the miners who burrow and dig, dig and burrow day and night towards the German lines; poor half-naked fellows who wheel little trucks of earth to the pit shaft or who lie on their stomachs working away with picks. And it's always an awful race to see if they'll blow up the Germans, or if it will be the other way about.  \"There are still more odd jobs, and new ones turn up every day. Mind you, I'm not grumbling, for many of these fellows work harder than we do, and we must have someone to feed us and to keep the place clean. But the difficulty is nowadays to find a man who's got time to stand in the trench and wait for the Hun to attack, and that's what you people don't seem to realise.\"  \"And what do you do?\" asked my friend as the other stopped to yawn.  \"What do I do? What do you think I've been talking for all this time?\" said the man in khaki. \"I'm the fellow who stands in the trench and waits for the Hun to attack. That's a jolly long job, and I've got some sleep owing to me for it, too.\"  Whereupon he stretched himself out on the seat, pillowed his head on his pack, and proceeded to extract noisy payment of his debt.  \"That rather complicates matters, doesn't it?\" said my friend, when the muddy figure had safely reached the land of dreams. \"If you've only got 150 fighting men in a company, your division has a strength of ...\" and he proceeded to count away on his fingers as hard as he could. Presently he gave it up in despair, and a brilliant idea seemed to strike him.  \"Those generals and staff fellows,\" he said, \"must have a lot of brains after all.\" And we have come to the conclusion that we will not criticise them any more, for they must know as well as we do, if not still better, how to win the war.     VIII  THE \"KNUT\"   We were sitting round the fire in the club, discussing that individual colloquially known as the \"knut.\"  \"The 'knut,'\" said Green, \"is now virtually extinct, he is killed by war. As soon as he gets anywhere near a trench, he drops his cloak of affectation, and becomes a reasonable human being--always excepting, of course, certain young subalterns on the staff.\"  Rawlinson leant forward in his chair. \"I'm not sure,\" he said, \"that I agree with you. It all depends upon how you define a 'knut.'\"  \"A 'knut' is a fellow with a drawl and an eyeglass,\" said someone.  \"That just fits my man. I know of an exception to your rule. I know of a 'knut' who did not disappear at the front.\"  \"Tell us about him,\" suggested Jepson.  Rawlinson hesitated, and glanced round at each of us in turn. \"It's not much of a story,\" he said at length, \"but it stirred me up a bit at the time--I don't mind telling it you if you think it sufficiently interesting.\"  We filled up our glasses, and lay back in our chairs to listen to the following tale:         *       *       *       *       *  \"When I was at Trinity I kept rooms just above a fellow called Jimmy Wynter. He wasn't a pal of mine at all, as he had far too much money to chuck about--one of these rich young wastrels, he was. He could drop more than my annual allowance on one horse, and not seem to notice it at all. In the end he got sent down for some rotten affair, and I was rather glad to see the last of him, as the row from his rooms was appalling. He always had an eyeglass and wonderfully cut clothes, and his hair was brushed back till it was as shiny as a billiard ball. I put him down, as did everyone else, as an out-and-out rotter, and held him up as an example of our decadent aristocracy.  \"When I went out to the front, our Regular battalion was full up, and I was sent to a Welsh regiment instead. The first man I met there was none other than this fellow Wynter, still with his eyeglass and his drawl. In time, one got quite accustomed to him, and he was always fairly amusing--which, of course, is a great thing out there--so that in the end I began to like him in a sort of way.  \"All this seems rot, but it helps to give you an idea of my man, and it all leads up to my story, such as it is.  \"We came in for that Loos show last year. After months and months of stagnation in the trenches, we were suddenly called to Headquarters and told that we were to make an attack in about two hours' time.  \"I don't know if any of you fellows came in for a bayonet charge when you were out at the Front. Frankly, I felt in a hell of a funk, for it's not the same thing to leave your trench and charge as it is to rush an enemy after you've been lying in an open field for an hour or two. The first hour and a half went all right, what with fusing bombs, arranging signals, and all that sort of thing, but the last half-hour was the very devil.  \"Most of us felt a bit jumpy, and the double rum ration went in two shakes. We knew that we shouldn't worry when the whistles went for the charge, but the waiting was rather trying. Personally I drank more neat brandy than I have ever done before or since, and then sat down and tried to write one or two letters. But it wasn't a brilliant success, and I soon left my dug-out and strolled along to C Company.  \"The idea was for A and C Companies to attack first, followed by B and D companies. A battalion of the Westshires was in support to us.  \"C Company Officer's dug-out was not a mental haven of rest. With one exception, everyone was a bit nervy, everyone was trying not to show it, and everyone was failing dismally. The exception was Jimmy Wynter. He was sitting on a pile of sandbags in the corner, his eyeglass in his eye, looking at an old copy of _La Vie Parisienne_, with evident relish. His hand was as steady as a rock, and he hadn't had a drop of rum or brandy to give him Dutch courage. While everyone else was fighting with excitement, Jimmy Wynter was sitting there, studying the jokes of his paper, as calmly as though he were sitting here in this old club. It was only then that it occurred to me that there was something in the fellow after all.  \"At last the time drew near for our push, and we waited, crouching under the parapet, listening to our artillery plunking away like blazes. At last"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25470"],["title","Mud and Khaki: Sketches from Flanders and France (#7)"],["body","whistles blew, a lot of fellows cheered, yelled all sorts of idiotic things, and A and C Companies were over the parapet on the way to the Huns.  \"I am no hand at a description of a charge, but it really was wonderful to watch those fellows; the sight of them sent every vestige of funk from me, and the men could hardly wait for their turn to come. Just before we went, I had one clear vision of Jimmy Wynter. He was well ahead of his platoon, for he was over six foot and long-legged at that. I could see his eyeglass swinging on the end of its black cord, and in his hand he carried a pickaxe. Such ordinary weapons as revolvers, rifles, and bayonets had no apparent attraction for him.  \"What happened next I had no time to see, for our turn came to hop over the parapet, and there wasn't much time to think of other people. Allan, his servant, told me later all that occurred, for he was next to Jimmy all the time. They got to the Hun trenches and lost a lot of men on the wire. Away to the left the enemy had concealed a crowd of machine guns in one of the slag heaps, and they played awful havoc among our chaps. According to Allan, Jimmy chose a place where the wire had almost all gone, took a huge leap over the few remaining strands, and was the first of C Company to get into the trench.  \"Somehow he didn't get touched--I'll bet Allan had something to do with that; for he loved his master. With his pick he cracked the skull of the first Boche who showed signs of fight, and, losing his hold of his weapon, he seized the man's rifle as he fell. No wonder the poor blighters fled, for Jimmy Wynter must have looked like Beelzebub as he charged down on them. His hat had gone, and his hair stuck out from his head like some modern Struwwelpeter. With the rifle swinging above his head, he did as much to clear the trench as did the rest of the platoon all put together.  \"When we arrived on the scene the few who remained of A and C Companies were well on their way to the second line of trenches. Here again Jimmy Wynter behaved like a demon with his rifle and bayonet, and in five minutes' time we were in complete possession of two lines of trenches along a front of two hundred yards. I do not even mention the number of Germans that Allan swore his master had disposed of, but the name of Wynter will long be a by-word in the regiment. The funny part of it is that, up to that time, he hadn't had a single scratch. However, Fate may overlook a man for a short time, but he is generally remembered in the end. So it was with poor old Jimmy.  \"He was leading a party down a communicating trench, bombing the Huns back yard by yard, when a hand grenade landed almost at his feet. He jumped forward, in the hope that he would have time to throw it away before it went off, but it was fused too well. Just as he picked it up, the damned thing exploded, and Jimmy Wynter crumpled up like a piece of paper.  \"I was coming along the trench a few minutes later, seeing that our position was being made as secure as possible before the counter-attack came, when I found him. He was lying in one of the few dug-outs that had not been hit, and Allan and another man were doing what they could for him.  \"You could see he was very nearly done for, but, after a few seconds, he opened his eyes and recognised me.  \"'Hullo, Rawlinson,' he whispered; 'some damned fool has hit me. Hurts like the very devil.'  \"I muttered some banal words of comfort, and continued to tie him up--though God knows it was a pretty hopeless task. I hadn't even any morphia I could give him to make things better.  \"Suddenly he raised his arm and fumbled about in search of something.  \"'What do you want?' I asked.  \"'Where the deuce is my eyeglass?' And the drawl seemed to catch horribly in his throat.  \"I put the rim of the eyeglass into his hand; the glass itself had gone.  \"'Must wear the damned thing,' he murmured, and he tried to raise it to his face--but his hand suddenly stopped half-way and fell, and he died.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was silence in the club room for a minute or so, and the ticking of the clock was oppressively loud. Then Jepson raised his glass.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said. \"Here's to the 'Knut,'\" and gravely we drank to the toast.     IX  SHOPPING   As the Captain sat down to breakfast, he turned to speak to me: \"I propose ...\" he began, but Lawson interrupted him. \"Oh, John dear,\" he said, \"this is so sudden.\"  The Captain took no notice of the interruption. \"... that you and I go shopping this afternoon.\"  \"Jane,\" I called to an imaginary maid, \"please tell Parkes to bring the car round at eleven o'clock; we are going shopping in Bond Street, and lunching at the Ritz.\"  \"You all seem to think you're deucedly funny this morning,\" growled the Captain as he pushed aside a piece of cold bacon with the end of his knife. \"The pure air of the billets seems to have gone to your heads so that I think a parade would suit you this afternoon.\"  We sobered down at the threat. \"No, seriously,\" I said, \"I'd love to go if I can get anything to ride.\"  \"You can have the Company's pack horse. I'll order both beasts for two o'clock.\"  Now the Captain's horse stands far more hands than any really respectable horse should, and the Captain is well over six feet in his socks; I, on the other hand, am nearer five feet than six, and the pack pony is none too big for me. Again, the Captain is thin and I am fat, so that even the sentry could scarcely repress his smile as we set forth on our quest--a modern Don Quixote, and a Sancho Panza with a hole in the back of his tunic.  But we had little time to think of our personal appearances, for our way lay over the Mont Noir, and there are few places from which you can get a more wonderful view, for you can follow the firing line right away towards the sea, and your field glasses will show you the smoke rising from the steamers off Dunkirk. We paused a moment, and gazed over the level miles where Poperinghe and Dixmude and the distant Furnes lay sleepy and peaceful, but, even as we looked, a \"heavy\" burst in Ypres, and a long column of smoke rose languidly from the centre of the town.  \"We shan't do much more shopping in that old spot,\" said the Captain as he turned his horse off the road, and set forth across country to Bailleul.  The Captain has hunted with nearly every pack of hounds in England, while I have hunted with none, so that I was hot and thirsty and uncommonly sore when we clattered into the town. Leaving the Captain to see the horses stabled at the HÃ´tel du Faucon, I slipped off to get a drink.  \"Here,\" said the Captain when he tracked me down, \"don't try that game on again or you'll have to take the early parade to-morrow. Besides, you're supposed to be Company Interpreter, and you've no right to leave me to the mercy of two savage grooms like that. I advise you to take care, young man.\"  My qualifications for the post of Company Interpreter lie in the fact that I once, in company of various other youths of my age, spent a fortnight in and around the Casino at Trouville. Peters of our company knows a long list of nouns taking \"x\" instead of \"s\" in the plural, but my knowledge is considered more practical--more French.  And now comes a confession. To retain a reputation requires a lot of care, and to keep my position as Company Interpreter and outdo my rival Peters I always carried about with me a small pocket dictionary--if anyone ever noticed it, he probably mistook it for a Service Bible--in which I searched for words when occasion offered. I had carefully committed to memory the French equivalents for all the articles on our shopping list--a pot of honey, a bottle of Benedictine, a pair of unmentionable garments for Lawson, and a toothbrush--so that I walked across the main square with a proud mien and an easy conscience.  Pride, they tell us, comes before a fall. We had successfully fought our way through the crowds of officers and mess waiters who swarm in Bailleul, we had completed our purchases, we were refreshing ourselves in a diminutive tea shop, when the Captain suddenly slapped his thigh.  \"By Jove,\" he said, \"I promised to buy a new saucepan for the Company cook. Good job I remembered.\"  What on earth was the French for a saucepan? I had no opportunity of looking in my dictionary, for it would look too suspicious if I were to consult my Service Bible during tea.  \"I don't think we shall have time to look for an ironmonger's,\" I said.  \"You blithering ass,\" said the Captain, \"there's one just across the road. Besides, we don't have dinner before eight as a rule.\"  The fates were working against me. I made one more effort to save my reputation. \"We should look so funny, sir, riding through Bailleul with a great saucepan. We might send the Company cook to buy one to-morrow.\"  I remained in suspense for a few moments as the Captain chose another cake. He looked up suddenly. \"We'll get it home all right,\" he said, \"but I believe the fact of the matter is that you don't know what to ask for.\"  \"We'll go and get the beastly thing directly after tea,\" I said stiffly, for it is always offensive to have doubts cast on one's capabilities, the more so when those doubts are founded on fact. Besides, I knew the Captain would love to see me at a loss, as French has been his touchy point ever since the day when, having a sore throat, he set out to buy a cure for it himself. The chemist, mistaking his French and his gestures, had politely led him to the door and pointed out a clothier's across the way, expressing his regret the while that chemists in France do not sell collars.  When we entered the ironmonger's shop I could see nothing in the shape of a saucepan that I could point out to the man, so I made a shot in the dark. \"Je dÃ©sire,\" I said, \"une soucoupe.\"  \"Parfaitement, m'sieu,\" said the shopman, and he produced a host of saucers of every description--saucers in tin, saucers in china, saucers big and"]]]
