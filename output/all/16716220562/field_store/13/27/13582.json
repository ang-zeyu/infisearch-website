The new object to come into view was the elbow of a man, and the shining barrel of a gun followed.  \"A guard, I'll wager my commission,\" was Deck's thought. \"I wonder if he is alone and if I can capture him single-handed.\"  The major, having led the way into many a hot fight, was not the one to hang back in such an emergency as this. Even while wondering if the man on the bridge was alone, he hurried forward, keeping the tree between himself and the individual. The bridge was gained and the tree was but three yards off when a partly loose plank tipped up, making enough noise to attract the attention of the man, who leaped forward, pointing his gun as he came.  \"Halt!\" he spluttered, but the word was still on his lips when Deck ducked, caught the gun barrel with his left hand, and with his right levelled his pistol full into the sentinel's face.  \"Surrender, or you are a dead man!\" commanded Major Deck, sternly. \"Let go of the gun.\"  The fellow, taken completely by surprise, hesitated, as if inclined to argue the point. \"Wha--what?\" he stammered. \"See yere, this ain't fair, nohow!\"  \"Let go, or I'll fire,\" was Deck's only answer, and he fingered the trigger of his revolver nervously.  In a second more he had the gun in his possession, and then he compelled the man to throw up both hands. \"Now march up the road away from the bridge,\" he continued. \"And no treachery, or I'll put a ball through you on the spot.\"  \"I reckon I have fell in with Deck Lyon,\" said the sentinel, with a sickly grin, as he moved on as the major had commanded.  \"I am Deck Lyon; but I don't know you, although I've seen you at Bowling Green. What do they call you?\"  \"They call me Sergeant Hank Scudder in our company.\"  [Illustration: \"SURRENDER, OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN!\"  _Page 32._]  \"And what company is that?\"  \"Cap'n Casswell's command--unattached.\"  \"Casswell's guerillas, eh?\"  \"We ain't guerillas--we belong to the boys in gray.\"  \"Does your captain hold a commission from headquarters?\"  \"'Tain't fer me to answer thet question, Major.\"  \"From the fact that you refuse to answer it, I infer that he does not; consequently he is nothing but a guerilla, and worse, and you are--\"  \"Hold on, Major, don't be too hard on a poor fellow who has his living to make.\"  \"This isn't making a living--it's stealing one. Tell me truthfully, is Gaffy Denny with your company?\"  \"Gaffy Denny is first leftenant, Major.\"  \"Where are the others?\"  \"Somewhere around the house and barns.\"  \"How long since you arrived here?\"  \"'Bout an hour and a half ago.\"  \"How many are there here? Answer me truthfully, or, my word for it, I and my friends will hang you to one of yonder trees.\"  \"Got many friends with yer, Major?\"  \"Enough. Now answer my question,\" and again Deck's weapon came up on a level with the guerilla's head.  \"There air twenty-five on us, I reckon.\"  \"Were you the only man left on guard?\"  \"I dunno.\"  \"Who put you on guard?\"  \"Leftenant Denny.\"  \"Isn't Captain Casswell in command?\"  \"No, the cap'n was shot down in a skirmish three days ago--back of Edmonton, and he's laying at the house of a friend ten miles from yere.\"  While talking the pair had moved across the road, and now Deck turned his prisoner in the direction of the clearing. Soon they came in sight of General, Clinker, and one other of the slaves.  \"The first prisoner, General,\" said the young officer. \"Have you anything with which to bind him?\"  \"Look yere, Major, this ain't handsome!\" cried Sergeant Hank Scudder, in alarm.  \"Handsome or not, you can thank your stars that I didn't shoot you dead on the bridge,\" rejoined Deck. \"How about a cord, General?\"  \"We dun got one, Mars'r Deck,\" answered the slave, and producing it he and Clinker soon bound the guerilla's hands behind him, after which the rope at his wrists was passed around a stout tree.  Deck's next movement was in the direction of the raft, for nothing was to be seen of Artie, and he was anxious to know how the young captain was faring. He had hardly reached the pile of logs to which the raft was moored, when a sharp cry rang out on the frosty air.  \"Help! General, Woolly, Clinker! Help!\" There followed another cry, and leaping through the brush and onto the logs Deck saw his cousin battling manfully in a hand-to-hand conflict with two rough men in gray, one of whom was trying to possess himself of the captain's sabre.  In such an emergency Major Deck did not hesitate as to a proper course of action. Had the men been regular Confederates he would have been justified in shooting at them; being guerillas he felt himself even more justified. He took careful aim and fired, and the rascal who had just wrenched the sabre from Artie's grasp fell, shot through the thigh, an ugly wound though not a fatal one.  Surprised at the counter-demonstration thus made, the second guerilla turned to see from what direction the shot had come. Giving him no chance in which to take in the situation, Deck fired a second time, the bullet whistling past the man in gray's shoulder. With a yell the fellow started to retreat from the logs, slipped on the wet and frost-covered surface beneath him, and rolled over and over until he went with a loud splash into the creek, not to reappear upon the surface of the icy current until fifty feet away.  \"Artie, are you hurt?\" demanded Deck, as he watched the man who had gone overboard.  \"N--no, but th--that man nearly choked the life out of me,\" was the answer, with a cough. \"Don't let him get away,\" and the young captain nodded toward the guerilla who was making for the plantation side of the creek.  \"He shan't get away.\" Deck elevated his voice and his shooter at the same time. \"Come back here, unless you want a hole put through your head!\" he called out.  To this the guerilla did not reply. But he kept on swimming, and seeing this both Deck and Artie fired. A yell of pain was the answer to the shots, and the man turned around.  \"Are you coming back?\" demanded Deck.  \"Yes! yes! don't shoot ag'in!\" came with something like a groan.  The wounded man on the logs was writhing in pain, but nothing could be done for him just now, and Deck and Artie watched the man in the water. \"I'm a goner!\" came from the individual of a sudden, and throwing up both arms he disappeared from view.  For the instant Deck stared blankly and Artie looked at him. \"Was that a genuine move, or is he shamming?\" questioned the captain.  \"I take it he is shamming,\" answered the major. \"I don't believe he was badly wounded at all. Wait,\" and he continued to watch.  In half a minute the body of the guerilla appeared, a hundred feet below the logs. \"Turn back here, or I'll put a bullet through your body for luck!\" sang out Deck, and raised his pistol again.  \"Don't! don't!\" came the quick reply. \"I'll come--don't hit me ag'in, Cap'n!\"  In less than five minutes after this the guerilla was on the raft once more. Deck was on the point of marching him up into the grove by the creek road when Levi Bedford came up in the canoe, demanding to know what the several shots meant. He was highly pleased to think that three men had already been put out of the contest.  \"I've discovered the guerillas moving around at the back of the mansion and around the largest of the barns,\" he said. \"Now that you have used your pistols the best thing to do, in my opinion, is to get over to the fort and take possession of it.\"  \"You are right,\" returned Deck. \"Let us go over on the raft, as first proposed; but General can come around by the bridge and bring all of the horses, or keep them where they will be handy in case they are wanted. We ought not to give these guerillas the least chance to escape.\"  The General was called from his hiding-place and matters were explained. While he went off with the horses, Levi Bedford led the way to the raft and unmoored her, fastening the painter to the stern of the canoe, which, though so called, was, as old readers already know, really a round-bottom rowboat. The overseer, Deck, and Artie entered the canoe, the first two at the oars, while the slaves deposited themselves on the raft, doing what they could to aid their progress over the stream by means of several sweeps which had been picked up.     CHAPTER IV  A FIRST VICTORY OVER THE ENEMY   It may be asked why a rush was not made upon the mansion and barns, instead of the stealthy advance now under way. The answer to this is, Deck and the others knew that the force to be encountered was larger than their own, and probably just as well, if not better, armed. Moreover, the young major felt that some of the guerillas must be on the lookout from the mansion, and an advance across the lawn in front and to one side, or the meadow to the rear and the other side, could only have been accomplished after a serious loss of life. The guerillas of Kentucky were for the most part \"dead-shots,\" and the youthful commander was not inclined to risk his men in the open against their superior numbers.  The creek at the point where the raft had been moored was between sixty and seventy feet wide, consequently the journey to the other side did not occupy over five minutes, even though the raft was an unwieldy thing to handle. As soon as they were near enough to do so, all hands leaped into the meadow grass, and started on a rush for Fort Bedford.  Bang! bang! bang! The three shots in rapid succession came from the rear of the largest barn, and Deck felt something rush through his cap and his hair beneath. A groan came from Clinker, who was struck in the side. The negro staggered but kept on, his eyes rolling and staring from a pain that was new to him.  \"'Tain't much, I reckon,\" he panted, in reply to Levi Bedford's question. \"Anybuddy else hit?\"  Nobody was, and without halting to return the fire they pressed on. Soon they were under the shelter of the ice-hou"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25440"],["title","An Undivided Union (#5)"],["body","se, as dark and silent as the rest of the plantation had previously appeared.  \"I left it locked up,\" explained Levi Bedford, when Artie gave a cry as he caught sight of the door. The heavy slabs of wood had been smashed in with a stout log used as a battering-ram, and a hasty search revealed the fact that the arms and ammunition, the overseer had mentioned, had been carried away.  As the party passed into the building several more shots were fired at them, but the bullets merely found resting-places in the woodwork or flattened themselves on the stone walls. Levi Bedford now saw one of the shooters near the edge of the barn and fired his rifle, but whether or not the shot took effect he could not ascertain.  \"Well, we are here,\" said Artie, after Clinker's wound had been examined and dressed. \"The question is, what's next?\"  Deck silently counted their forces again. As General was absent, they numbered but eight including himself. He shook his head seriously.  \"We are but eight, and if that captured rascal is to be believed they have three times that number,\" he said.  \"But our other negroes must be around somewhere,\" said Artie, \"and they'll need some men to guard the women folks,--unless they have locked them up,--or--or--\"  \"Or done away with them,\" finished Deck, bitterly. \"For myself, I am ready to make a dash forward, be the consequence what it may. But I can't ask it of you and the slaves,\" and he turned to the overseer.  \"I'll do whatever you think best, Major,\" responded Levi, warmly. \"But supposing I go out with a flag of truce and learn what they have to say?\"  \"Hadn't I better go along?\" asked Deck, eagerly.  \"If you wish--yes.\"  A handkerchief was soon tied to a stick, and, leaving Artie in command of the armed slaves, the young major and the overseer sallied forth, waving the flag of truce over their heads. They started toward the mansion, but before half the distance was covered a loud and rough voice from the barn called upon them to halt, and they halted.  \"Come this way with thet rag!\" was the next order. \"If ye go to the house we'll open fire on ye!\"  As there seemed no help for it, Deck and Levi turned toward the barn. While still a hundred feet from the building they were ordered to halt again, and then a man in gray, wearing a tangled beard of black, with matted hair to match, came forth to greet them.  \"Well?\" he demanded laconically, as the major and the overseer paused.  \"Dan Wolfall, what does this mean?\" demanded Levi, recognizing the individual as a former citizen of Barcreek, and one who had left \"between two days\" because of a horse stealing which had been laid at his door.  Wolfall grinned, thereby showing a set of uneven yellow teeth, much the worse for constant tobacco chewing. \"I reckon as how it means we-uns is in persession o' this yere plantation,\" he answered slowly, shifting his quid from one jaw to the other.  \"Whom do you mean by we-uns?\" asked Deck.  \"Me an' the rest o' Captain Casswell's company o' Confederates, sonny. Say, you feel big in them sodger clothes, don't ye?\" Wolfall asked, with another grin.  \"Do you know that you are liable to be shot down or hung as outlaws?\" went on Deck.  \"Reckon we air jest as liable ter be shot down as Confed'rates, ain't we?\"  \"Such men as you would be a disgrace even to the Confederacy, Wolfall,\" interposed Levi Bedford, his honest eyes flashing fire. \"Years ago Duncan Lyon saved you from a long term in prison, and this is how you reward his brother and his nephews.\"  \"Don't preach, Bedford, I ain't ust to hearin' on it. Times is changed, an' if the Lyonses is gwine to take a stand ag'in the best interests o' this State, why they hev got to take the consequences, thet's all.\"  \"Kentucky has declared for the Union and we are on the right side,\" said Deck. \"Let us come to an understanding of the situation. What have you done with my mother and my two sisters?\"  \"I reckon Leftenant Denny has 'em safe, sonny. Them's nice clothes, sonny, but a gray suit would look a heap sight better.\"  \"Are they still at the mansion?\"  \"They air onless the leftenant has took 'em away.\"  \"What do you propose to do here?\"  \"Enjoy ourselves, sonny.\"  \"Which means that you are going to confiscate all our stores and steal our valuables.\"  \"As you please, sonny. If yer come only to abuse such gents as we air, better be gittin' back, sonny,\" and now the Kentucky guerilla tapped his horse pistol significantly.  \"How many are there of you?\" went on Deck, hardly able to resist keeping his hands from the ruffian.  \"Twict as many as half, sonny. Is that all ye want ter know?\"  \"I see you are not inclined to meet me fairly,\" continued Deck, sternly. \"I order you to leave this place at once.\"  \"Ain't obeyin' orders jest now, sonny.\"  \"Very well; then you and your comrades in this raid must take the consequences if you are captured. Moreover, my men and I will shoot you down like dogs if we get the chance,\" and Deck turned back, followed by Levi.  \"Thet shootin' won't be all one-sided!\" called the guerilla after the pair, and disappeared into the barn.  When the major and the overseer returned to Fort Bedford, Artie wished to know immediately what had been accomplished.  \"Nothing,\" answered Deck, his face clouded in perplexing thoughts. He was almost \"stumped,\" although he did not care to admit it.  A shout was now heard along the creek, and looking from the fort those within saw five colored men standing at the clearing. They were the slaves that had followed the first detachment to Lyndhall. With the colored men were three whites, farmers living in the vicinity who had called at Lyndhall on business and who had been persuaded by Margie and Kate to join in the defence of Riverlawn.  \"Eight more guns,\" said Artie. \"That gives us sixteen all told. Hang me, if I'm not in for making a rush!\"  Deck's face began to brighten. \"Levi, how many men do you think are at the barn?\"  \"I saw four looking from behind the doors,\" answered the overseer. \"Those with Wolfall made five. I don't believe there were any more.\"  \"Then I'll tell you what I'll do,\" went on the young commander. \"As secretly as I can, I'll recross the creek and join the men in the clearing. I'll bring them around to the meadow by the road, and along the berry bushes at the other side of the lawn. There will be nine of us, and as soon as we are in a position to attack the barn, I'll fire two shots in quick succession. Then you must make a demonstration against the house. But be careful that it doesn't cost you any lives.\"  Both Levi and Artie were quick-witted enough to see the advantage of Deck's plan and readily agreed to it. Without the loss of a moment the major left the fort, crawling on his hands and knees through the grass to the creek.  Here the canoe and the raft were found as they had been left. Detaching the boat from the logs, he leaped in, and crouching low, sculled for the opposite shore with all speed. He was taking a big risk and knew it, and expected every instant to receive a shot from the enemy.  But none came, thanks to Levi, who, calculating the time he would be thus exposed, ran to the opening of the fort and called on several to do the same. As no good chance for an aim was given, the guerillas did not open with their guns, but they kept their eyes on the fort, and the creek was for the time being neglected.  On reaching the edge of the clearing, Deck did not lose a moment, but hurried the slaves and the white men back to the road and to the bushes lining the upper side. As they marched along on the double quick he explained the situation to Ralph Bowman, Sandran Dowleigh, and Carson Lee, the three farmers, all natives of the county, and all Union men to the core.  \"They ought to be wiped out,\" said Bowman, with a vigorous nod of his head. \"I know Wolfall and Denny well, and a rope over a tree is the medicine they need.\"  \"I've got my Long Sam with me,\" put in Carson Lee, tapping his long rifle affectionately. \"Just let me get one peep at Denny or Wolfall, thet's all.\" Lee was a crack shot, and on more than one occasion had taken the first prize at target-shooting.  It took the best part of a quarter of an hour to reach the meadow Deck had mentioned. Here there was a slight rise of ground, beyond which stood the barn. From their position only the top of the structure could be seen. Crawling Indian fashion to the top of the rise, the major inspected the situation again. As before, not a soul was in sight.  Before moving forward he had stationed one of the slaves some distance closer to the mansion. The man was armed with a double-barrelled gun, and as Deck waved his handkerchief two reports rang out, the signal agreed upon. Hardly had the echo of the gun died away than Levi, Artie, and the others emerged from the fort, and began moving around the meadow toward the front of the house.  The demonstration did just what was expected. Several men appeared at the mansion windows, to fire in vain at the detachment from the fort, they keeping pretty well out of range. From the barn poured the five guerillas counted by Levi, anxious to learn if their services were needed elsewhere.  By this time Deck's command was at the top of the rise, and the major called on his men to take careful aim and fire, discharging his pistol at the same moment. Carson Lee picked out Wolfall and the ruffian dropped like a log, shot through the head. Two of the others went down, one hit in the arm and the other in the side. The two remaining stopped in perplexity, not knowing whether to return to their original shelter or run for the mansion.  \"Charge!\" cried Major Deck, rushing for the barn with all the swiftness of his youthful legs. \"Come on, boys; don't let one of them get away!\" And he continued to fire as he advanced, finally succeeding in hitting one of the remaining pair of guerillas in the calf of the leg, a painful though not a serious wound. Seeing the turn of affairs, the last ruffian, also wounded, sped"]]]
