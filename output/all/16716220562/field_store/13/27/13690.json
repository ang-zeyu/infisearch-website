Just how much influence had the Redax had over them? He knew from his own experience that sometimes he had an odd double reaction--two different feelings which almost sickened him when they struck simultaneously. And he was beginning to suspect that with some of the others the return to the past had been far more deep and lasting. Now Jil-Lee was actually to reason out what had happened. While Deklay had reverted to an ancestor who had ridden with Victorio or Magnus Colorado! Travis had a flash of premonition, a chill which made him half foresee a time when the past and the present might well split them apart--fatally.  \"Devil or _ga-n_.\" A man with a quiet face, rather deeply sunken eyes, spoke for the first time. \"We are in two minds because of this Redax, so let us not do anything in haste. Back in the desert world of the People I have seen the _mba'a_, and he was very clever. With the badger he went hunting, and when the badger had dug up the rat's nest, so did the _mba'a_ wait on the other side of the thorny bush and catch those who would escape that way. Between him and the badger there was no war. These two who sit over yonder now--they are also hunters and they seem friendly to us. In a strange place a man needs all the help he can find. Let us not call names out of old tales, which may mean nothing in fact.\"  \"Buck speaks straightly,\" Jil-Lee agreed. \"We seek a camp which can be defended. For perhaps there are men here whose hunting territory we have invaded, though we have not yet seen them. We are a people small in number and alone. Let us walk softly on trails which are strange to our feet.\"  Inwardly Travis sighed in relief. Buck, Jil-Lee ... for the moment their sensible words appeared to swing the opinions of the party. If either of them could be established as _haldzil_, or clan leader, they would all be safer. He himself had no aspirations in that direction and dared not push too hard. It had been his initial urging which had brought them as volunteers into the project. Now he was doubly suspect, and especially by those who thought as Deklay, he was considered too alien to their old ways.  So far their protests had been fewer than he anticipated. Although brothers and sisters had followed each other into the team after the immemorial desire of Apaches to cling to family ties, they were not a true clan with solidity of that to back them, but representatives of half a dozen.  Basically, back on Terra, they had all been among the most progressive of their people--progressive, that is, in the white man's sense of the word. Travis had a fleeting recognition of his now oblique way of thinking. He, too, had been marked by the Redax. They had all been educated in the modern fashion and all possessed a spirit of adventure which marked them over their fellows. They had volunteered for the team and successfully passed the tests to weed out the temperamentally unfit or fainthearted. But all that was before Redax....  Why had they been submitted to that? And why this flight? What had pushed Dr. Ashe and Murdock and Colonel Kelgarries, time agents he knew and trusted, into dispatching them without warning to Topaz? Something had happened, something which had given Dr. Ruthven ascendancy over those others and had started them on this wild trip.  Travis was conscious of a stir about the firelit circle. The men were rising, moving back into the shadows, stretching out on the blankets they had found among other stores on the ship. They had discovered weapons there--knives, bows, quivers of arrows, all of which they had been trained to use in the intensive schooling of the project and which needed no more repair than they themselves could give. And the rations they carried were field supplies, few of them. Tomorrow they must begin hunting in earnest....  \"Why has this thing been done to us?\" Buck was beside Travis, those quiet eyes sliding past him to seek the fire once more. \"I do not think you were told when the rest of us were not----\"  Travis seized upon that. \"There are those who say that I knew, agreed?\"  \"That is so. Once we stood at the same place in time--in our thoughts, our desires. Now we stand at many places, as if we climbed a stairway, each at his own speed--a stairway the Pinda-lick-o-yi has set us upon. Some here, some there, some yet farther above....\" He sketched a series of step outlines in the air. \"And in this there is trouble--\"  \"The truth,\" Travis agreed. \"Yet it is also true that I knew nothing of this, that I climb with you on these stairs.\"  \"So I believe. But there comes a time when it is best not to be a woman stirring a pot of boiling stew but rather one who stands quietly at a distance--\"  \"You mean?\" Travis pressed.  \"I say that alone among us you have crossed the stars before, therefore new things are not so hard to understand. And we need a scout. Also the coyotes run in your footsteps, and you do not fear them.\"  It made good sense. Let him scout ahead of the party, taking the coyotes with him. Stay away from the camp for a while and speak small--until the people on Buck's stairway were more closely united.  \"I go in the morning,\" Travis agreed. He could slip away tonight, but just now he could not force himself away from the fire, from the companionship.  \"You might take Tsoay with you,\" Buck continued.  Travis waited for him to enlarge on that suggestion. Tsoay was one of the youngest of their group, Buck's own cross-cousin and near-brother.  \"It is well,\" Buck explained, \"that we learn this land, and it has always been our custom that the younger walk in the footprints of the older. Also, not only should trails be learned, but also men.\"  Travis caught the thought behind that. Perhaps by taking the younger men as scouts, one after another, he could build up among them a following of sorts. Among the Apaches, leadership was wholly a matter of personality. Until the reservation days, chieftains had gained their position by force of character alone, though they might come successively from one family clan over several generations.  He did not want the chieftainship here. No, but neither did he want growing whispers working about him to cut him off from his people. To every Apache severance from the clan was a little death. He must have those who would back him if Deklay, or those who thought like Deklay, turned grumbling into open hostility.  \"Tsoay is one quick to learn,\" Travis agreed. \"We go at dawn--\"  \"Along the mountain range?\" Buck inquired.  \"If we seek a protected place for the rancheria, yes. The mountains have always provided good strongholds for the People.\"  \"And you think there is need for a fort?\"  Travis shrugged. \"I have been one day's journey out into this world. I saw nothing but animals. But that is no promise that elsewhere there are no enemies. The planet was on the tapes we brought back from that other world, and so it was known to the others who once rode between star and star as we rode between ranch and town. If they had this world set on a journey tape, it was for a reason; that reason may still be in force.\"  \"Yet it was long ago that these star people rode so....\" Buck mused. \"Would the reason last so long?\"  Travis remembered two other worlds, one of weird desert inhabited by beast things--or had they once been human, human to the point of possessing intelligence?--that had come out of sand burrows at night to attack a spaceship. And the second world where the ruins of a giant city had stood choked with jungle vegetation, where he had made a blowgun from tubes of rustless metal as a weapon gift for small winged men--but were they men? Both had been remnants of that ancient galactic empire.  \"Some things could so remain,\" he answered soberly. \"If we find them, we must be careful. But first a good site for the rancheria.\"  \"There is no return to home for us,\" Buck stated flatly.  \"Why do you say that? There could be a rescue ship later--\"  The other raised his eyes again to Travis. \"When you slept under the Redax how did you ride?\"  \"As a warrior--raiding ... living....\"  \"And I--I was one with _go'ndi_,\" Buck returned simply.  \"But--\"  \"But the white man has assured us that such power--the power of a chief--does not exist? Yes, the Pinda-lick-o-yi has told us so many things. He is busy, busy with his tools, his machines, always busy. And those who think in another fashion cannot be measured by his rules, so they are foolish dreamers. Not all white men think so. There was Dr. Ashe--he was beginning to understand a little.  \"Perhaps I, too, am standing still, halfway up the stairway of the past. But of this I am very sure: For us, there will be no return to our own place. And the time will come when something new shall grow from the seed of the past. Also it is necessary that you be one of the tenders of that growth. So I urge you, take Tsoay, and the next time, Lupe. For the young who may be swayed this way and that by words--as the wind shakes a small tree--must be given firm roots.\"  In Travis education warred with instinct, just as the picture Redax had planted in his mind had warred with his awaking to this alien landscape. Yet now he believed he must be guided by what he felt. And he knew that no man of his race would claim _go'ndi_, the power of spirit known only to a great chief, unless he had actually felt it swell within him. It might have been fostered by hallucination in the past, but the aura of it carried into the here and now. And Travis had no doubts that Buck believed implicitly in what he said, and that belief carried credulity to others.  \"This is wisdom, _Nantan_--\"  Buck shook his head. \"I am no _nantan_, no chief. But of some things I am sure. You also be sure of what lies within you, younger brother!\"  On the third day, ranging eastward along the base of the mountain range, Travis found what he believed would be an acceptable camp site. There was a canyon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],["title","The Defiant Agents (#7)"],["body","a good spring of water cut round by well-marked game trails. A series of ledges brought him up to a small plateau where scrub wood could be used to build the wickiups. Water and food lay within reach, and the ledge approach was easy to defend. Even Deklay and his fellow malcontents were forced to concede the value of the site.  His duty to the clan accomplished, Travis returned to his own concern, one which had haunted him for days. Topaz had been taped by men of the vanished star empire. Therefore, the planet was important, but why? As yet he had found no indication that anything above the intelligence level of the split horns was native to this world. But he was gnawed by the certainty that there _was_ something here, waiting.... And the desire to learn what it was became an ever-burning ache.  Perhaps he was what Deklay had accused him of being, one who had come to follow the road of the Pinda-lick-o-yi too closely. For Travis was content to scout with only the coyotes for company, and he did not find the loneliness of the unknown planet as intimidating as most of the others.  He was checking his small trail pack on the fourth day after they had settled on the plateau when Buck and Jil-Lee hunkered down beside him.  \"You go to hunt--?\" Buck broke the silence first.  \"Not for meat.\"  \"What do you fear? That _ndendai_--enemy people--have marked this as their land?\" Jil-Lee questioned.  \"That may be true, but now I hunt for what this world was at one time, the reason why the ancient star men marked it as their own.\"  \"And this knowledge may be of value to us?\" Jil-Lee asked slowly. \"Will it bring food to our mouths, shelter for our bodies--mean life for us?\"  \"All that is possible. It is the unknowing which is bad.\"  \"True. Unknowing is always bad,\" Buck agreed. \"But the bow which is fitted to one hand and strength of arm, may not be suited to another. Remember that, younger brother. Also, do you go alone?\"  \"With Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu I am not alone.\"  \"Take Tsoay with you also. The four-footed ones are indeed _ga-n_ for the service of those they like, but it is not good that man walks alone from his kind.\"  There it was again, the feeling of clan solidarity which Travis did not always share. On the other hand, Tsoay would not be a hindrance. On other scouts the boy had proved to have a keen eye for the country and a liking for experimentation which was not a universal attribute even among those of his own age.  \"I would go to find a path through the mountains; it may be a long trail,\" Travis half protested.  \"You believe what you seek may lie to the north?\"  Travis shrugged. \"I do not know. How can I? But it will be another way of seeking.\"  \"Tsoay shall go. He keeps silent before older warriors as is proper for the untried, but his thoughts fly free as do yours,\" Buck replied. \"It is in him also, this need to see new places.\"  \"There is this,\" Jil-Lee got to his feet, \"--do not go so far, brother, that you may not easily find a way to return. This is a wide land, and within it we are but a handful of men alone----\"  \"That, too, I know.\" Travis thought he could read more than one kind of warning in Jil-Lee's words.         *       *       *       *       *  They were the second day away from the plateau camp, and climbing, when they chanced upon the pass Travis had hoped might exist. Before them lay an abrupt descent to what appeared to be open plains country cloaked in a dusky amber Travis now knew was the thick grass found in the southern valleys. Tsoay pointed with his chin.  \"Wide land--good for horses, cattle, ranches....\"  But all those lay far beyond the black space surrounding them. Travis wondered if there was any native animal which could serve man in place of the horse.  \"Do we go down?\" Tsoay asked.  From this point Travis could sight no break far out on the amber plain, no sign of any building or any disturbance of its smooth emptiness. Yet it drew him. \"We go,\" he decided.  Close as it had looked from the pass, the plain was yet a day and a night, spent in careful watching by turns, ahead of them. It was midmorning of the second day that they left the foothill breaks, and the grass of the open country was waist high about them. Travis could see it rippling where the coyotes threaded ahead. Then he was conscious of a persistent buzzing, a noise which irritated faintly until he was compelled to trace it to its source.  The grass had been trampled flat for an irregular patch, with a trail of broken stalks out of the heart of the plain. At one side was a buzzing, seething mass of glitter-winged insects which Travis already knew as carrion eaters. They arose reluctantly from their feast as he approached.  He drew a short breath which was close to a grunt of astounded recognition. What lay there was so impossible that he could not believe the evidence of his eyes. Tsoay gave a sharp exclamation, went down on one knee for a closer examination, then looked at Travis over his shoulder, his eyes wide, more than a trace of excitement in his voice.  \"Horse dung--and fresh!\"     5   \"There was one horse, unshod but ridden. It came here from the plains and it had been ridden hard, going lame. There was a rest here, maybe shortly after dawn.\" Travis sorted out what they had learned by a careful examination of the ground.  Nalik'ideyu and Naginlta, Tsoay, watched and listened as if the coyotes as well as the boy could understand every word.  \"There is that also--\" Tsoay indicated the one trace left by the unknown rider, an impression blurred as if some attempt had been made to conceal it.  \"Small and light, the rider is both. Also in fear, I think--\"  \"We follow?\" Tsoay asked.  \"We follow,\" Travis assented. He looked to the coyotes, and as he had learned to do, thought out his message. This trail was the one to be followed. When the rider was sighted they were to report back if the Apaches had not yet caught up.  There was no visible agreement; the coyotes simply vanished through the wall of grass.  \"Then there are others here,\" Tsoay said as he and Travis began their return to the foothills. \"Perhaps there was a second ship--\"  \"That horse,\" Travis said, shaking his head. \"There was no provision in the project for the shipping of horses.\"  \"Perhaps they have always been here.\"  \"Not so. To each world its own species of beasts. But we shall know the truth when we look upon that horse--and its rider.\"  It was warmer this side of the mountains, and the heat of the plains beat at them. Travis thought that the horse might well be seeking water if allowed his head. Where did he come from? And why had his rider gone in haste and fear?  This was rough, broken country and the tired, limping horse seemed to have picked the easiest way through it, without any hindrance from the man with him. Travis spotted a soft patch of ground with a deep-set impression. This time there had been no attempt at erasure; the boot track was plain. The rider had dismounted and was leading the horse--yet he was moving swiftly.  They followed the tracks around the bend of a shallow cut and found Nalik'ideyu waiting for them. Between her forefeet was a bundle still covered with smears of soft earth, and behind her were drag marks from a hole under the overhang of a bush. The coyote had plainly just disinterred her find. Travis squatted down to examine it, using his eyes before his hands.  It was a bag made of hide, probably the hide of one of the split horns by its color and the scraps of long hair which had been left in a simple decorative fringe along the bottom. The sides had been laced together neatly by someone used to working in leather, the closing flap lashed down tightly with braided thong loops.  As the Apache leaned closer to it he could smell a mixture of odors--the hide itself, horse, wood smoke, and other scents--strange to him. He undid the fastenings and pulled out the contents.  There was a shirt, with long full sleeves, of a gray wool undyed from the sheep. Then a very bulky short jacket which, after fingering it doubtfully, Travis decided was made of felt. It was elaborately decorated with highly colorful embroidery, and there was no mistaking the design--a heavy antlered Terran deer in mortal combat with what might be a puma. It was bordered with a geometric pattern of beautiful, oddly familiar work. Travis smoothed it flat over his knee and tried to remember where he had seen its like before ... a book! An illustration in a book! But which book, when? Not recently, and it was not a pattern known to his own people.  Twisted into the interior of the jacket was a silklike scarf, clear, light blue--the blue of Terra's cloudless skies on certain days, so different from the yellow shield now hanging above them. A small case of leather, with silhouetted designs cut from hide and affixed to it, designs as intricate and complex as the embroidery on the jacket--art of a high standard. In the case a knife and spoon, the bowl and blade of dull metal, the handles of horn carved with horse heads, the tiny wide-open eyes set with glittering stones.  Personal possessions dear to the owner, so that when they must be abandoned for flight they were hidden with some hope of recovery. Travis slowly repacked them, trying to fold the garments into their original creases. He was still puzzled by those designs.  \"Who?\" Tsoay touched the edge of the jacket with one finger, his admiration for it plain to read.  \"I don't know. But it is of our own world.\"  \"That is a deer, though the horns are wrong,\" Tsoay agreed. \"And the puma is very well done. The one who made this knows animals well.\"  Travis pushed the jacket back into the bag and laced it shut. But he did not return it to the hiding place. Instead, he made it a part of his own pack. If they did not succeed in running down the fugitive, he wanted an opportunity for closer study, a chance to remember just where he had seen that picture before.  The narrow valley where they had"]]]
