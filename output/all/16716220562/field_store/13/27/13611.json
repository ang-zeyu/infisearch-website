If any tramps were there they've gone.\"  \"Wa-all, maybe,\" said the farmer, with a shake of his head. \"Good luck to you, anyhow!\"  \"Thanks!\" laughed Grandpa Martin.  \"All aboard!\" called Ted once more.  Then Sam, the hired man, and Grandpa Martin began to row the boat.  The Curlytops were off for Star Island, to camp out with grandpa.     CHAPTER IV  OVERBOARD   \"Trouble! sit still!\" ordered Janet.  \"Yes, Trouble, you sit still!\" called Mother Martin, as the Curlytops' grandfather and his man pulled on the oars that sent the boat out toward the middle of the lake. \"Don't move about.\"  \"I wants to splash water.\"  \"Oh, no, you mustn't do that! Splashing water isn't nice,\" said Baby William's mother.  \"'Ike drandpa does,\" Trouble went on, pointing to the oars which the farmer was moving to and fro. Now and then a little wave hit the broad blades and splashed little drops into the boat.  \"Trouble want do that!\" declared the little fellow.  \"No, Trouble mustn't do that,\" said his mother. \"Grandpa isn't splashing the water. He's rowing. Sit still and watch him.\"  Baby William did sit still for a little while, but not for very long. His mother held to the loose part of his blue and white rompers so he would not get far away, but, after a bit, she rather forgot about him, in talking to Ted and Jan about what they were to do and not to do in camp.  Suddenly grandpa, who had been rowing slowly toward Star Island, dropped his oars and cried:  \"Look out there, Trouble!\"  \"Oh, what's the matter?\" asked Mother Martin, looking around quickly.  \"Trouble nearly jumped out of the boat,\" explained Grandpa Martin. \"I just grabbed him in time.\"  And so he had, catching Baby William by the seat of his rompers and pulling him back on the seat from which he had quickly sprung up.  \"What were you trying to do?\" asked Mrs. Martin.  \"Trouble want to catch fish,\" was the little fellow's answer.  \"Yes! I guess a fish would catch _you_ first!\" laughed Ted.  \"I'll sit by him and hold him in,\" offered Janet, and she remained close to her small brother during the remainder of the trip across the lake. He did not again try to lean far over as he had done when his grandfather saw him and grabbed him.  \"Hurray!\" cried Teddy, as he sprang ashore. \"Now for the camp! Can I help put up the tents, Grandpa?\"  \"Yes, when it's time. But first we must bring the rest of the things over. We'll finish that first and put up the tents afterward. We have two more boatloads to bring.\"  \"Then can't I help do that?\"  \"Yes, you may do that,\" said Grandpa Martin with a smile.  \"Can't I come, too?\" asked Janet. \"I'm almost as strong as Teddy.\"  \"I think you'd better stay and help me look after Trouble,\" said Mrs. Martin. \"Nora will be busy getting lunch ready for us, which we will eat before the tents are up.\"  \"Oh, then I can help at that!\" cried Janet, who was eager to be busy. \"Come on, Nora! Where are the things to eat, Mother? I'm hungry already!\"  \"So'm I!\" cried Ted. \"Can't we eat before we go back for the other boatload, Grandpa?\"  \"Yes, I guess so. You Curlytops can eat while Sam and I unload the boat. I'll call you Teddy, when I'm ready to go back.\"  \"All right, Grandpa.\"  The tents were to be put up and camp made a little way up from the shore near the spot at which they had landed. Grandpa Martin took out of the boat the different things he had brought over, and stacked them up on shore. Parts of the tents were there, and things to cook with as well as food to eat. More things would be brought on the next two trips, when another of the hired men was to come over to help put up the tents and make camp.  \"Oh, I just know we'll have fun here, camping with grandpa!\" laughed Jan, as she picked up her small brother who had slipped and fallen down a little hill, covered with brown pine needles.  \"Let's go and look for something,\" proposed Ted, when he had run about a bit and thrown stones in the lake, watching the water splash up and hundreds of rings chase each other toward shore.  \"What'll we look for?\" asked Janet, as she took hold of Trouble's hand, so he would not slip down again.  \"Oh, anything we can find,\" went on Ted. \"We'll have some fun while we're waiting for grandpa to get out the things to eat.\"  \"I want something to eat!\" cried Trouble. \"I's hungry!\"  \"So'm I--a little bit,\" admitted Jan.  \"Maybe we could find a cookie--or something--before they get everything unpacked,\" suggested Teddy, and this was just what happened. Grandpa Martin had some cookies in a paper bag in his pocket. Grandma Martin had put them there, for she felt sure the children would get hungry before their regular lunch was ready on the island. And she knew how hungry it makes anyone, children especially, to start off on a picnic in the woods or across a lake.  \"There you are, Curlytops!\" laughed Grandpa Martin, as he passed out the molasses and sugar cookies. \"Now don't drop any of them on your toes!\"  \"Why not?\" Ted wanted to know.  \"Oh, because it might break them--I mean it might break your cookies,\" and Grandpa Martin laughed again.  \"Come now, we'll go and look for things,\" proposed Ted, as he took a bite of his cookie, something which Jan and Trouble were also doing.  \"What'll we look for?\" Jan asked again.  \"Oh, maybe we can find a cave or a den where a--where a fox lives,\" he said, rather stumbling over his words.  At first Ted had been going to say that perhaps they would look for a bear's den, but then he happened to remember that even talk of a bear, though of course there were none on Star Island, might scare his little brother and Jan. So he said \"fox\" instead.  \"Is there a fox here?\" Jan asked.  \"Maybe,\" said Ted. \"Anyhow, let's go off and look.\"  \"Don't go too far!\" called Grandpa Martin after them, as he started to unload the boat and get the camp in order. \"And don't go too near the edge of the lake. I don't want you to fall in and have your mother blame me.\"  \"No, we won't!\" promised Ted. \"Come on,\" he called to his little brother and sister. \"Oh, there you go again!\" he cried, as he saw Trouble stumble and fall. \"What's the matter?\" he asked.  \"It's these pine needles. They're awfully slippery,\" answered Janet. \"I nearly slipped down myself. Did you hurt yourself, Trouble?\" she asked the little fellow.  He did not answer directly, but first looked at the place where he had fallen. He could easily see it, because the pine needles were brushed to one side. Then Baby William tried to turn around and look at the back of his little bloomers.  \"No, I isn't hurted,\" he said.  Janet and Ted laughed.  \"I guess maybe he thought he might have broken his leg or something,\" remarked Teddy. \"Now come on and don't fall any more, Trouble.\"  But the little fellow was not quite ready to go on. He stooped over and looked at the ground where he had fallen.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Janet, who was waiting to lead him on, holding his hand so he would not fall.  \"Maybe he lost something,\" said Teddy. \"Has he got any pockets in his bloomers, Jan?\"  \"No, mother sewed 'em up so he wouldn't put his hands in 'em all the while--and his hands were so dirty they made his bloomers the same way. He hasn't any pockets.\"  \"Then he couldn't lose anything,\" decided Ted. He was always losing things from his pockets, so perhaps he ought to know about what he was talking. \"What is it, Trouble?\" he asked, for the little fellow was still stooping over and looking carefully at the ground near the spot where he had fallen.  \"I--I satted right down on him,\" said Trouble at last, as he picked up something from the earth. \"I satted right down on him, but I didn't bust him,\" and he held out something on a little piece of wood.  \"What's he got?\" asked Ted.  \"Oh, it's only an ant!\" answered Janet. \"I guess he saw a little ant crawling along, just before he fell, and he sat down on him. Did you think you'd hurt the little ant, Trouble?\"  \"I satted on him, but I didn't hurt him,\" answered the little boy. \"He can wiggle along nice--see!\" and he showed the ant, crawling about on the piece of wood. Perhaps the little ant wondered how in the world it was ever going to get back to the ground again.  \"Put him down and come on,\" said Ted. \"We want to find something before grandpa puts up the tent. Maybe we can find the den where the fox lives.\"  Trouble carefully put the little ant back on the ground.  \"I satted on him, but I didn't hurted him,\" again said the little fellow, grunting as he stood up straight again. Janet took his hand and they followed Teddy off through the forest.  It was very pleasant in the woods on Star Island. The sun was shining brightly and the waters of the lake sparkled in the sun. The children felt glad and happy that they had come camping with their grandpa, and they knew that the best fun was yet to happen.  \"Let's look around for holes now,\" said Teddy, after they had gone a little way down a woodland path.  \"What sort of holes?\" asked Janet.  \"Holes where a fox lives,\" answered her brother. \"If we could find a fox maybe we could tame it.\"  \"Wouldn't it bite?\" the little girl asked.  \"Well, maybe a little bit at first, but not after it got tame,\" said Teddy. \"Come on!\"  They walked a little way farther, and then Jan suddenly cried:  \"Oh, I see a hole!\"  She pointed to one beneath the roots of a big tree.  \"That's a fox den, I guess!\" exclaimed Teddy. \"We'll watch and see what comes out.\"  The children hid in the bushes where they could look at the hole in the ground. For some time they waited, and then they began to get tired. The Curlytops were not used to keeping still.  \"I'm going to sneeze!\" said Trouble suddenly, and sneeze he did. And just then a little brown animal bounced out from under a bush and ran into the hole.  \"Oh, it's a bunny rabbit!\" cried Janet. \"He lives in that hole! Come on, Ted, let's walk. We've found out what it was. It isn't a fox, it's a bunny! Let's go and find something else "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25477"],["title","The Curlytops on Star Island; Or, Camping out with Grandpa (#5)"],["body","the island. Maybe we can find a big cave.\"  \"And maybe we'll find out what that blue light was,\" cried Ted eagerly.  \"I guess I don't want to look for that,\" remarked Jan slowly.  \"Why not?\"  \"'Cause don't you 'member what Hal said about there bein' ghosts on this island?\" and Janet looked over her shoulder, though it was broad daylight.  \"Pooh!\" laughed her brother. \"I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.\"  \"I don't--but----\"  \"I'm not afraid!\" declared Teddy. \"And I'm going to look and see if I can't find the lost star that fell on the island.\"  \"Grandpa said it all burned up.\"  \"Well, maybe a little piece of it was left. Anyhow I'm going to look.\"  So they looked, but they found nothing like the blue light, and then Ted said he was hungry and wanted to eat.  Nora and Mrs. Martin had set out a little lunch for the children on top of a packing box, and the Curlytops and Trouble were soon enjoying the sandwiches and cake, while their grandfather and the hired man finished unloading the boat. In a little while Grandpa Martin called:  \"All aboard, Teddy, if you're going back with me!\"  \"I'm coming!\" was the answer. \"I'm coming!\"  It did not take Grandpa Martin long to pull back to the mainland in the boat which was empty save for himself and Ted. The lake was smooth, a little wind making tiny waves that gently lapped the side of the boat.  \"I think we'd better bring Nicknack over this trip,\" said Grandpa Martin, when a second farm hand met him on shore and began to help load the boat for the second trip. \"The sooner we get that goat over on the island the better I'll feel.\"  \"Why, you're not afraid of him, are you?\" asked the hired man whose name was George.  \"No. But I don't know how easy it's going to be to ferry him over. He may start some of his tricks. So we won't put much in the boat this time. We'll leave plenty of room for the goat and the cart.\"  \"Oh, Nicknack will be good,\" declared Ted. \"I know he will. Won't you, Nicknack?\" and he put his arms around his pet. The goat had been driven down near the dock whence the boat started for Star Island.  \"Well, unharness him and we'll get him on board,\" said the farmer. \"Then we'll see what happens next.\"  Nicknack made no fuss at all about being unharnessed. His wagon was first wheeled on the boat, which was a large one and broad. Then Ted started Nicknack toward the craft.  \"Giddap!\" cried Teddy to Nicknack. \"We're going to camp on Star Island, and you can have lots of fun! Giddap!\"  Nicknack stood still on the dock for a few seconds, and he seemed to be sniffing the boat and the water in which it floated. Then with a little wiggle of his funny, short tail, he jumped down in near his wagon, and began eating some grass which Ted had pulled and placed there for him.  \"It's a sort of bait, like a piece of cheese in a mouse trap,\" remarked Ted, as he saw the goat nibbling. \"Isn't he good, Grandpa?\"  \"He's good now, Teddy; but whether he'll be good all the way over is something I can't say. I hope so.\"  George put in the boat as much as could safely be carried, with the goat as a passenger, and then he and Grandpa Martin began rowing toward Star Island. At first everything went very well. Nicknack seemed a little frightened when the boat tipped and rocked, but Ted patted him and fed him more grass, which Nicknack liked very much.  \"I knew he'd be good!\" Teddy said, when they were almost at the island, and could see Jan waving to them. \"I knew he'd like the boat ride, Grandpa.\"  \"Yes, he seems to like it. Now if we----\"  But just then something happened.  The wind suddenly blew rather hard, roughening the water and causing the boat to tip. Nicknack was jostled over against the wagon, and some water splashed on him.  \"Baa-a-a-a-a!\" bleated the goat.  Then, before anyone could stop him, he gave a leap over Teddy's head, and into the water splashed Nicknack.  The goat had leaped overboard into the deepest part of Clover Lake!     CHAPTER V  THE BAG OF SALT   \"Oh! Oh!\" cried Teddy. \"Oh, there goes my nice goat! Catch him, Grandpa! Stop him!\"  Grandpa Martin stopped rowing and looked in surprise at the goat. So did the hired man.  \"Well, just look!\" exclaimed George.  \"Oh, he'll be drowned! He'll be drowned!\" wailed Teddy, tears coming into his eyes, for he loved Nicknack. \"He'll be drowned!\"  Grandpa Martin rested his hands on the oars and looked into the water. Then he smiled.  \"I guess you'd have hard work drowning that goat,\" he said. \"He's swimming like a fish!\"  \"And right straight for Star Island!\" added the hired man. \"That's a smart goat all right! He knows where he wants to go, and the shortest way to get there!\"  Surely enough Nicknack was swimming toward the island. When he jumped out of the boat he floundered a little in the water, and splashed some on Teddy. Then he struck out, paddling as a dog does with his front feet. Nicknack turned himself about until he was headed toward the island, and then he swam straight toward it.  \"Oh, won't he drown, Grandpa?\" asked Teddy.  \"I don't believe so, my boy! I guess Nicknack knows more than we thought he did. Maybe he didn't like the way we rowed, or he may have wanted a bath. Anyhow he jumped overboard, but he'll be all right.\"  \"See him go!\" cried the hired man.  Nicknack was swimming quite fast. Of course a goat is not as good a swimmer as is a duck or a fish, but Ted's pet did very well. On shore were Nora, Mrs. Martin, Janet, Trouble, and the farm hand who had gone over in the first boatload. They were watching the goat swimming toward them.  \"Did you throw him into the water, Teddy?\" asked Janet, as soon as the boat was near enough so that talking could be heard.  \"He jumped in,\" Ted answered. \"Isn't he a good swimmer?\"  \"I should say so! Here, Nicknack! Come here!\" Janet called.  The goat, which had been headed toward a spot a little way down the island from where Janet and her mother stood, turned at the sound of the little girl's voice and came in her direction.  \"Oh, he knows me!\" she cried in delight. \"Now don't shake yourself the way Skyrocket does, and get me all wet!\" she begged, as Nicknack scrambled out on shore, water dripping from his hairy coat.  But the goat did not act like a dog, who gives himself a great shaking whenever he comes on shore after having been in the water. Nicknack just let it drip off him, and began to nibble some of the grass that grew on the island. He was making himself perfectly at home, it seemed.  The goat-wagon and the other things were soon landed, and then Grandpa Martin and one of the hired men went back for the last load. When that came back and the things were piled up near the tents, the work of setting up the camp went on. There was much yet to be done.  Ted and Jan helped all they could in putting up the tents. So did Mother Martin and Nora, who was large and strong. She could pull on a rope about as well as a man, and there were many ropes that needed tightening and fastening around pegs driven into the ground so the tents would not blow over in the wind.  Nicknack had been tied to a tree, near which, a little later, Ted and Jan were going to make him a little bower of leaves and branches. That was to be his stable until a better one could be built by Grandpa Martin--one that would keep Nicknack dry when it rained.  At last the tents were up, one for sleeping, another for cooking, and a third where the Curlytops and the others would eat their meals. It was a fine camp that Grandpa Martin made, and he knew just how to do it right, even to digging little trenches, or ditches, around the tents so the water would run off when it stormed.  \"And now let's take a walk and see what we can find,\" suggested Ted to Janet, when Mother Martin said they might play about until supper was ready, for they had called the lunch they had eaten their dinner.  \"Don't go too far,\" cautioned Mother Martin.  \"Oh, we can't get lost on this island,\" said Ted. \"All we'd have to do, if we were, would be to walk along the shore until we came to this camp.\"  \"I know that. But it wasn't so much about your getting lost that I was thinking,\" said Mrs. Martin.  \"Oh, you mean--the tramps?\" half whispered Janet.  \"Well, I don't know whether there are any here or not,\" went on her mother. \"But it's best to be careful until grandpa has had a chance to look about. Where is grandpa now?\"  \"He's getting some water at the spring,\" Ted answered.  There was a fine spring on Star Island, not far from the place where the tents had been set up, and Mr. Martin was now bringing pails of water from that and pouring them into a barrel which would hold so much that even Trouble would have plenty to drink no matter how thirsty he was.  \"Well, don't go too far away until either grandpa or I have a chance to go with you,\" added Mrs. Martin.  \"Me come, too,\" called Trouble, as he saw his brother and sister starting off.  \"Oh, Mother!\" exclaimed Teddy.  \"No, you stay with mother,\" said Mrs. Martin. \"I'll give you a nice drink of milk.\"  \"Don't want milk. I's had milk. Trouble want Ted an' Jan.\"  \"But you can't go with them, my dear. Come on, we'll go and throw stones into the lake and make-believe it's a great, big ocean!\"  Baby William pouted a little at first. He liked to have his own way. But when he saw what fun his mother was having tossing stones into the lake and making the water splash up, Trouble did the same, laughing at the fun he was having.  \"Dis a ocean, Momsey?\" he asked as he set a little stick afloat, making believe it was a boat.  \"Well, we'll call it an ocean,\" Mrs. Martin answered. \"But this water is fresh, and that in the ocean is very salty. Some day I'll take you and my two little Curlytops to the real ocean, and you can taste how salty the waves are. Now we'll throw some more stones.\"  Meanwhile Ted and Jan started for a little walk down the path that went the whole length of Star Island.  \"Shall we take Nicknack?\" asked Jan.  \"No, let's wait until he dries off after his bath,\" decided"]]]
