We are fated serfs to freedom--sky and sea;       We have failed where slummy cities overflow;     But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth,     And we go into the dark as fighters go.      Yes, we go into the night as brave men go,     Though our faces they be often streaked with woe;             Yet we're hard as cats to kill,             And our hearts are reckless still,     And we've danced with death a dozen times or so.      And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,       And you'll find us herding cattle in the South.     We like strong drink and fun; and when the race is run,       We often die with curses in our mouth.      We are wild as colts unbroke, but never mean;       Of our sins we've shoulders broad to bear the blame;     But we'll never stay in town, and we'll never settle down,       And we'll never have an object or an aim.      No, there's that in us that time can never tame;     And life will always seem a careless game;             And they'd better far forget--             Those who say they love us yet--     Forget, blot out with bitterness our name.     NEW YEAR'S EVE       It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;       Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;     And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad           New Year,       Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.      They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon, and it's cheery and           bright in there       (God! but I'm weak--since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);     I'll just go over and slip inside--I mustn't give way to despair--       Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.      They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me, and they'll call me a           whiskey soak;       (\"Have a drink? Well, thankee kindly, sir, I don't mind if I do.\")     A drivelling, dirty gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;       Sunk and sodden and hopeless--\"Another? Well, here's to you!\"      McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;       The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got           fired;     I'll just sneak into a corner, and they'll let me alone a bit;       The room is reeling round and round ... O God, but I'm tired, I'm           tired....             *       *       *       *       *      Roses she wore on her breast that night. Oh, but their scent was sweet;       Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;     The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,       And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of           love.      Then sudden the laughter died on her lips, and lowly she bent her head;       And oh, there came in the deep, dark eyes a look that was heaven           to see     And the moments went, and I waited there, and never a word was said,       And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red, and shyly gave it to           me.      Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up           like day;       And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny           brow;     \"She is mine, she is mine for evermore!\" the violins seemed to say,       And the bells were ringing the New Year in--O God! I can hear them           now.      Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad           refrain?       Don't you remember that last goodbye, and the dear eyes dim with           tears?     Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,       Of lives that would blend like an angel-song in the bliss of the           coming year?      Oh, what have I lost! What have I lost! Ethel, forgive, forgive!       The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.     'Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live!       I have sinned, I have sunk to the lowest depths--but oh, I have           suffered so!      Hark! Oh hark! I can hear the bells!... Look! I can see her there,       Fair as a dream ... but it fades ... And now--I can hear the           dreadful hum     Of the crowded court ... See! the Judge looks down ... NOT GUILTY,           my Lord, I swear ...       The bells, I can hear the bells again ... Ethel, I come, I come!...             *       *       *       *       *      \"Rouse up, old man, it's twelve o'clock. You can't sleep here, you           know.       Say! ain't you got no sentiment? Lift up your muddled head;     Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go--       You darned old dirty hobo ... My God! Here, boys! He's DEAD!\"     COMFORT       Say! You've struck a heap of trouble--       Bust in business, lost your wife;     No one cares a cent about you,       You don't care a cent for life;     Hard luck has of hope bereft you,       Health is failing, wish you'd die--     Why, you've still the sunshine left you,       And the big, blue sky.              Sky so blue it makes you wonder               If it's heaven shining through;             Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,               Sun so bright it dazzles you;             Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging               All their fragrance on the breeze;             Dancing shadows, green, still meadows--               Don't you mope, you've still got these.      These, and none can take them from you;       These, and none can weigh their worth.     What! you're tired and broke and beaten?--       Why, you're rich--you've got the earth!     Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,       While the blue sky bends above,     You've got nearly all that matters,       You've got God, and God is love.     PREMONITION       'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright       (Oh, I remember so well, so well),     I walked with my love in a sea of light,       And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell.          And sudden the moon grew strangely dull,           And sudden my love had taken wing;         I looked on the face of a grinning skull,           I strained to my heart a ghastly thing.      'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still       In my arms with her tender eyes aglow,     And she wondered why my lips were chill,       Why I was silent and kissed her so.          A year has gone and the moon is bright,           A gibbous moon like a ghost of woe;         I sit by a new-made grave to-night,           And my heart is broken--it's strange, you know.     THE TRAMPS       Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped God's land together,       And we sang the old, old Earth-song, for our youth was very sweet;     When we drank and fought and lusted, as we mocked at tie and tether,       Along the road to Anywhere, the wide world at our feet.      Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had its story;       When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest was still unstale;     When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as, bathed in amber glory,       Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale.      Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster;       There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet O we loved it so!     As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was our master,       And no man guessed what dreams were ours, as swinging heel and toe,     We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic road to Anywhere,       The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years ago.     _L'ENVOI_       _You who have lived in the Land,       You who have trusted the trail;     You who are strong to withstand,       You who are swift to assail;     Songs have I sung to beguile,       Vintage of desperate years     Hard as a harlot's smile,       Bitter as unshed tears._                        _Little of joy or mirth,                         Little of ease I sing;                       Sagas of men of earth,                         Humanly suffering,                       Such as you all have done;                         Savagely faring forth,                       Sons of the midnight sun,                         Argonauts of the North._      _Far in the land God forgot       Glimmers the lure of your trail;     Still in your lust are you taught       Even to win is to fail.

THE CANAL.   It happened one summer, when Rollo was between seven and eight years of age, that there was a vacation at the school which he was attending at that time. The vacation commenced in the latter part of August, and was to continue for four or five weeks. Rollo had studied pretty hard at school, and he complained that his eyes ached sometimes.  The day before the vacation commenced, his father became somewhat uneasy about his eyes; and so he took him to a physician, to see what should be done for them. The physician asked Rollo a good many questions, all of which Rollo endeavored to answer as correctly as he could.  At length, the physician told Rollo's father that all he needed was to let his eyes rest. \"I think he had better not use them at all,\" said he, \"for reading or writing, for several weeks; and not to be out much in the hot sun.\"  Rollo felt very much rejoiced at hearing this prescription, though still he looked very sober; for he felt somewhat awed and restrained by being in the doctor's office. There were a good many large books, in cases upon one side of the room; and strange, uncouth-looking pictures hanging up, which, so far as Rollo could see, did not look like any thing at all. Then there was an electric machine upon a stand in one corner, which he was afraid might in some way \"shock\" him; and some frightful-looking surgical instruments in a little case, which was open upon the table in the middle of the room.  In fact, Rollo was very glad to escape safely out of the doctor's office; and he was, if possible, still more rejoiced that he had so light and easy a prescription. He had thought that, perhaps, the doctor would put something on his eyes, and bandage them up, so that he could not see at all; or else give him some black and bitter medicines to take every night and morning.  Instead of that, he said to himself, as he came out at the door, \"I have only got to keep from studying, and that will be capital. I can play all the time. True, I can't read any story books; but, then, I am willing to give the story books up, if I don't have to study.\"  Rollo had usually been obliged to read, or study, or write a little, even in vacations; for his mother said that boys could not be happy to play all the time. Rollo, however, thought that she was mistaken in this. It is true that she had sometimes allowed him to try the experiment for a day or two, and in such cases he had always, somehow or other, failed of having a pleasant time. But then he himself always attributed the failure to some particular difficulty or source of trouble, which happened to come up then, but which would not be likely to occur again.  In fact, in this opinion Rollo was partly correct. For it was true that each day, when he failed of enjoying himself, there was some peculiar reason for it, and exactly that reason would not be likely to exist another day. But then the difficulty with playing, or attempting to amuse one's self all the time, is, that it produces such a state of mind, that almost any thing becomes a source of uneasiness or dissatisfaction; and something or other is likely to occur, or there will be something or other wanting, which makes the time pass very heavily along.  It is so with men as well as boys. Men sometimes are so situated that they have nothing to do but to try to amuse themselves. But these men are generally a very unhappy class. The poorest laborer, who toils all day at the hardest labor, is happier than they.  So that the physician's prescription was, in reality, a far more disagreeable one than Rollo had imagined.  When Rollo reached home, he told his mother that he was not to have any thing more to do with books for a month.  \"And you look as if you were glad of it,\" said she, with a smile.  \"Yes, mother, I am,\" said Rollo, \"rather glad.\"  \"And what do you expect to do with yourself all that time?\" said she.  \"O, I don't know,\" said Rollo. \"Perhaps I shall help Jonas, a part of the time, about his work.\"  \"That will be a very good plan for a part of the time,\" said his mother; \"though he is doing pretty hard work just now.\"  \"What is he doing?\"  \"He is digging a little canal in the marsh, beyond the brook, to drain off the water.\"  \"O, I can dig,\" said Rollo, \"and I mean to go now and help him.\"  This was about the middle of the forenoon; and Rollo, taking a piece of bread for a luncheon, and a little tin dipper, to get some water with, to drink, out of the brook, walked along towards the great gate which led to the lane behind his father's house. It was a pleasant, green lane, and there were rows of raspberry-bushes on each side of it, along by the fences. Some years before, there had been no raspberries near the house; but one autumn, when Jonas had a good deal of ploughing to do down the lane, he ploughed up the ground by the fences in this lane, making one furrow every time he went up and down to his other work. Then in the spring he ploughed it again, and by this time the turf had rotted, and so the land had become mellow. Then Jonas went away with the wagon, one afternoon, about two miles, to a place where the raspberries were very abundant, and dug up a large number of them, and set them out along this lane, on both sides of it; and so, in a year or two, there was a great abundance of raspberries very near the house.  Rollo stopped to eat some raspberries as he walked along. He thought they would do exceedingly well with his bread, to give a little variety to his luncheon. After he had eaten as many as he wanted, he thought he would gather his dipper full for Jonas, as he was busy at work, and could not have time to gather any for himself.  He got his dipper full very quick, for the raspberries were thick and large. He thought it was an excellent plan for Jonas to plant the raspberry-bushes there; but then he thought it was a great deal of trouble to bring them all from so great a distance.  \"I wonder,\" said he to himself, as he sat upon a log, thinking of the subject, \"why it would not have been just as well to plant raspberries themselves, instead of setting out the bushes. The raspberries must be the seeds. I mean to take some of these big ones, and try. I dare say they'll grow.\"  But then he reflected that the spring was planting time, and he knew very well that raspberries would not keep till spring; and so he determined to ask Jonas about it. He accordingly rose up from the log, and walked along, carrying his dipper, very carefully, in his hand.  At length, he reached the brook. There was a rude bridge over it made of two logs, placed side by side, and short boards nailed across them for a foot-way. It was only wide enough for persons to walk across. The cattle and teams always went across through the water, at a shallow place, just below the bridge.  Rollo lay down upon the bridge, and looked into the water. There were some skippers and some whirlabouts upon the water. The skippers were long-legged insects, shaped somewhat like a cricket; and they stood tiptoe upon the surface of the water. Rollo wondered how they could keep up. Their feet did not sink into the water at all, and every now and then they would give a sort of leap, and away they would shoot over the surface, as if it had been ice. Rollo reached his hand down and tried to catch one, to examine his feet; but he could not succeed. They were too nimble for him. He thought that, if he could only catch one, and have an opportunity to examine his feet, he could see how it was that he could stand so upon the water. Rollo was considering whether it was possible or not, that Jonas might make something, like the skippers' feet, for _him_, to put upon his feet, so that _he_ might walk on the water, when suddenly he heard a bubbling sound in the brook, near the shore. He looked there, and saw some bubbles of air coming up out of the bottom, and rising to the top of the water. He thought this was very singular. It was not strange that the air should come up through the water to the top, for air is much lighter than water; the wonder was, how the air could ever get down there.  From wondering at this extraordinary phenomenon, Rollo began to wonder at another quite different question; that is, where all the water in the brook could come from. He looked at a little cascade just above the bridge, where the water rushed through a narrow place between two rocks, and watched it a few minutes, wondering that it should continue running so all the time, forever; and surprised also that he had never wondered at it before.  He looked into the clear, transparent current, which poured steadily down between the rocks, and said to"]]]
