They even had to send to New York to get some of her orders filled.  What do you suppose anyone wants old dried up roots for?\"  \"You can well guess that old Turkish woman, or whatever she is, can do woozy things with 'yarbs,'\" said Cleo, giving the provincial pronunciation to the word \"herbs.\"  Then they noted the chime in the hall calling the hour for lights out, and consequently folded their note books to comply with the rules.  \"But just suppose she is feeding them to Mary!  Oh, maybe that's what's the matter with her!\" and Cleo bounced from the divan over to the desk to make one last note in the day's records.  \"There!  I shall be sure to remember it was I who--originated that.  I'm sure it is going to be part of our plot!\"  \"And I guess,\" ventured Grace, \"that they get the roots--for--well, for hair tonic,\" she floundered.  \"Roots ought to be good for bald heads!\"  \"Hair roots would be, of course,\" put in Madaline, excusing a yawn, \"but I never saw them advertised.\"  \"When I go in business I shall advertise real hair roots, planted on bald heads.  Satisfaction guaranteed or money refunded,\" quoted Grace.  \"Anyone may have marvelous hair by applying Madame Gracia's hair roots,\" added Cleo.  \"Just rub it on and watch it sprout!  Well, we will go over Second Mountain to-morrow morning, as Aunt Audrey is away, and we will be left entirely to ourselves.  But I must not forget very first thing to write to mother.  You know she and dad are going West next week, and I may spend the entire summer with Aunt Audrey.  You girls are to stay as long as you like, for Flosston Mill magnates, including both your fathers, may have to come to New York for headquarters, and then all our families will leave Pennsylvania.\"  \"Isn't that glorious!\" Grace exclaimed.  \"I think it's a perfectly splendid idea to have all our dads in the one firm.  They can't do anything to separate us,\" and she gave Cleo an appreciative hug.  \"Don't forget to dress in uniform to-morrow,\" Cleo reminded her chums. \"We have had enough vacation from scouting I think.  I'm really sick for my old, practical self.\"  \"Well, I renew my pledge every day, of course,\" Madaline declared. \"But I do feel lonely for my nice, tidy uniform.  Do you suppose we shall attract attention around here?\"  \"No, indeed,\" answered Cleo.  \"I saw a group of girls yesterday in scout uniform.  I suppose there is a troop here.  But we don't have to look it up unless we get still more lonely.  Well, good night, girlies. I am going to try the new dream pillow.  Isn't it darling?\" and she pressed her cheek to the tiny heart-shaped down pillow, with its embroidered motto case, the latest remembrance from her loving mother.  \"We might make them for gifts,\" remarked Grace.  \"I think them too sweet for words!\"  \"And that perfume is--orchid, isn't it?\" asked Madaline.  \"It is too delicate for anything else.\"  \"Yes, momsey likes orchid, and dad buys it, so I guess that's her sachet.  Good-night again, girls, and to-morrow we go hunting our wood-nymph; and, girls,\" with a premonitory perk of her shapely head, \"be sure to lock your window because it is right off the porch roof, and with Aunt Audrey away, we can't be sure of old Michael's police ability.\"  \"Oh, Cleo,\" gulped Madaline, who, being dimply, always seemed the baby of the trio, \"do you think anyone would climb up the post poles?\"  \"No, certainly not, silly,\" replied Cleo with a show of scorn, \"but you see, I must share the responsibility when Aunt Audrey is away, and it is always best to keep windows directly off low roofs locked.  Then, if anyone should try to get in we would be sure to hear them.  Run away now, and try on your new Billie Burkes.  Maybe I'll come in and inspect them when I get myself ready.\"  The low mountain house presently echoed with the girls' laughter, for indulging in their usual propensity to prolong recreation, a dressing-up contest was crowded in the hour of undressing.  Billie Burks and boudoir caps, under long capes and wild draperies, furnished equipment adequate and ridiculous, so that even Jennie, who was dragged from her mending out to the second hall to serve as audience, found herself laughing foolishly at the girl scouts' antics.  Cleo impersonated \"Walla-Hoola,\" with a string of twenty neckties (borrowed from Uncle Guy's room) dangling around her waist, over a combination of pink crÃªpe and bluebird pajamas.  At the back of her neck, in savage glee, was propped the piano feather duster, the same being somewhat supported by another necktie of Kelly green hue, that banded her classic brow.  Madaline \"tried on\" Circe, all swathed up in a billowy white mosquito netting, that might never again be used as a bed canopy.  She found her \"rock\" on a third floor landing, and clung frantically to the stairs post, while the wild sea of perfectly good oak steps dashed savagely at her uncovered toes.  She also pink-pinked Cleo's ukelele, according to Circean traditions.  Grace rolled around the floor in the ocean waves--the lost soul who was to be saved by someone, anyone would do, so far as Grace was concerned. All she had to worry about apparently was the roll.  Had she been a little older, and just a little more rotund, one might have suspected her indulging in a treatment; but it required, finally, the combined strength of Cleo and Jennie to extricate the \"lost soul\" from the meshes into which that roll and a couple of fine silkoline quilts had engulfed her.  \"Mrs. Dunbar wouldn't like to have the quilts soiled,\" interposed Jennie wisely, \"and now, girls, dear, do run along to bed.  You've had a fine time, and I enjoyed the show first rate.\"  \"Thank you, Jennie!\" panted Grace, crawling out of her cocoon like a human caterpillar.  \"We had a lovely time also.  And, Jennie, will you please be sure to leave your door open?  Michael may be a very sound sleeper, and you know we all have to be on guard to-night.\"  \"Indeed, Grace, not a step could come up that gravel path, or through the grass itself, but I would hear it\"--Jennie was proud of her nocturnally acute sense of sound, or suspicion of mere noises--\"and you may sleep sound as Michael himself, for nothing will come near this lodge unbeknownst to Jennie Marlow.\"  \"That's a good Jennie,\" Cleo patted the trusted servant, \"and if I hear even the tiniest bit of a noise, like a chipmunk, or a tree toad, you can expect me to come pouncing into your nice big feather bed.\"  \"And leave us!\" protested Madaline, who was no longer the entrancing Circe.  \"There'll be room for all of you, crosswise, like our old buckboard,\" Jennie assured them once more, and this time the \"good-night\" was allowed to take effect.  A half hour later Cragsnook was snuggled in the stillness of a beautifully soft night, pillowed against the Jersey mountains, and cradled in the sweet scented foliage of giant tulip trees and ambitious beeches.  The trees at night seemed unfathomable, and this denseness increased the darkness and magnified the shadows.  But the three girl scouts under Jennie Marlow's protection, slept and dreamed of their next day's quest in search of Mary, the phantom wood nymph, or Mary the fleet-footed maid of Second Mountain.  She must surely live somewhere between Bellaire and that mountain, beyond which the girls had no definite idea of territory.  A pretty lake formed the boundary, and up to that line they had planned their search.     CHAPTER V  ON THE TRAIL  After all their preparations for burglars or other scary visitors, it was rather disappointing to come down to breakfast next morning just as calm and complaisant as usual; in fact it was calmer, for the absence of Aunt Audrey was readily felt in something like loneliness.  Madaline was even threatened with a fit of homesickness.  Jennie brought the muffins, and it struck Cleo she was quieter than usual.  A snappy \"good morning\" in that tone that implies \"eat in a hurry and clear out,\" added another note to the already discordantly charged atmosphere.  \"Do you know, girls,\" announced Grace, pushing aside her grapefruit, \"I feel exactly as if something were surely going to happen to-day.\"  \"So do I,\" spoke up Cleo; \"I feel as if a nice early hike over the big gray mountain is going to happen, and I am sure of it.\"  \"But I mean something odd and queer,\" insisted Grace.  \"Did you feel that way the day you tied the man to the tree?\" teased Cleo.  \"If you did, I'm not going out with you,\" spoke up Madaline, disregarding table manners to the extent of making a pyramid from her yellow muffin crumbs.  \"I feel awfully queer, too, and I'm not going to take a risk with Grace, if she's going to be reckless.\"  \"Can't see why you should fear me, Madie.\"  Then noticing the homesick look on the usually dimpling face, Grace \"broke out,\" as Cleo called her spells of exhilaration.  \"I'll tell you,\" offered Grace.  \"We'll take our mountain sticks, loaded water pistols, and I have Benny's air gun, and we'll go hunting.  Of course we wouldn't really shoot bunnies, but--we'll shoo them.  Andy Mack told me yesterday the woods are just full of all kinds of young hunters now, but they are mostly from the city, and after flowers.  You can take a bag or a basket, Madaline, to carry home your precious roots in, because you know what a time we always have spoiling our hats that way.\"  Madaline gave a wan little smile, for her, and then surprised her chums with declaring she believed she would stay home and help Jennie transplant some lettuce, as she loved to do transplanting. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25626"],["title","The Girl Scouts at Bellaire; Or, Maid Mary's Awakening (#4)"],["body"," Whether or not the remark was overheard in the kitchen, Jennie swung open the door as Madaline finished speaking, and as she confronted the girls there was no mistaking the look on her closely lined face.  Jennie was mad!  \"Lettuce!\" she repeated.  \"Indeed we have none to transplant.  My beautiful bed is entirely destroyed!\"  \"Oh, how?\" exclaimed the girls.  \"I don't know,\" replied the maid, still seething with indignation, \"but I'm likely to think it wasn't a mountain rabbit that did the damage, for the plants were yanked up by the roots, and bunnies just nibble the tops!\"  \"Oh, that's such a shame!\" declared Cleo, \"and you were counting on having it just right when Uncle Guy returns.  Who would do that?\"  \"Well, there's some awful queer folks around here lately,\" went on Jennie, as she slipped the breakfast dishes on the tray.  \"They don't know anything about folks' rights.  Think everything growing is common property.  There's one old woman who pretends she doesn't understand me when I tell her to stop digging in the lawn, and what she digs is nothing but old roots and weed stuff,\" and Jennie threw back her shoulders, assuming an attitude of righteous indignation.  \"What kind of looking woman is she?\" asked Cleo, thinking, of course, of the queer woman in the foreign costume.  \"She looks like a circus parade,\" Jennie declared, \"but she's no more circus than I am.  It's lots easier to hide mistakes when one pretends she's foreign and doesn't understand.\"  \"And has she a little girl with her?\" questioned Grace.  Even Madaline was interested now.  \"Yes, poor child.  A half-scared-to-death little thing, that runs like a bunnie if you speak to her,\" replied the maid.  \"That's just whom we are looking for,\" declared Cleo.  \"We saw them the day we came, and felt that the little girl needed friends.  Then at the Cross Country Run the other day she almost knocked Andy Mack down; she jumped out so suddenly just as he turned into the last lap.  She is crazy, I think,\" finished Cleo.  \"Then, I'm not going to hunt her,\" declared Madaline, \"crazy folks are dangerous.\"  Jennie laughed at their expressed fears.  \"That child isn't crazy,\" she declared, \"but it's a wonder she isn't, with that old woman tagging around.  Well, I don't suppose she stole my lettuce, but I'm going to watch out for people on these grounds after this,\" and Jennie swung herself through the double acting door with such energy, the portal made a swift return trip on its hinges.  \"There's some connection between buying roots in the drug store, digging roots from the lawns, and--maybe she took the lettuce,\" figured Cleo.  \"Oh, come on,\" implored Grace.  \"I'm sure we will find that little fairy out to-day, and I promise you, Madie, I won't do anything rash. Come along, there's a dear,\" and Grace slipped her arms around the girl who threatened to come down with a fit of lonesomeness.  \"Come on, maybe we'll meet Andy's little brother.\"  \"I'll go, not on account of the little brother though,\" quickly explained Madaline, to forestall a laugh.  But it was the little brother, Malcolm by name and Mally by adoption, who \"happened to meet\" the girls, just under the mountain.  \"Where y'u goin'?\" he inquired, winding up his kite string, regardless of the trees between the kite and his hand.  \"Hunting,\" answered Grace.  \"Want to come?\"  \"Huntin' what?\" asked Mally.  \"We're not sure, but we'll take anything we can find, even little boys!\" teased Cleo.  \"Oh, will you!\" Mally fired back.  \"You don't have to.  Say, Madaline, I know where there's some Jack-in-the-Pulpits,\" he added, sidling up to Madaline.  \"The kind you were looking for the other day.  Jack Hagan is going to meet me over by the creek at ten, and if you girls want to come along I'll show you where to hunt things.\"  \"No bears?\" protested Cleo.  \"Well, there's weasles and mink in that creek, and you'd think they were bears if one of those grabbed you,\" Mally declared.  \"Lead the way!\" ordered Grace, mounting her staff on her shoulder, and the little hunters started off.  \"Say, Mally,\" began Cleo, as they struck a clearance in the otherwise tangled brush and bramble path, \"do you ever see a little girl who has big long braids, and never wears a hat?\"  \"Sure,\" replied the boy.  \"That's Mary.  Her old granddad's a nut.\"  \"Has she a granddad?\" Cleo followed.  \"I knew it.  A girl like that always has.  Where do they live?\"  \"Don't you know?  Huh!\" Mally answered scornfully.  \"Thought everybody knew old Doc Benson.  He's a nut on flowers and growin' things.\"  \"But where does he live?  Could we go near his house?\" Grace asked eagerly.  \"If the old lady doesn't chase you,\" replied the boy, making a running jump over a huge stone, one of the many bowlder rocks that continually roll down the mountain.  \"Suppose she does.  She can't hurt us, can she?\" pursued Cleo.  \"One of the fellows said she hurt him all right,\" declared Mally.  \"She shook him 'til he lost all his marbles.  Hey, Jack!\" he yelled, cupping his hands to his red lips.  \"Here we are, over near the swamp!\"  Jack evidently spied his chum at that moment, for although tall brush obstructed his view of the hunters, he answered with a \"Whoo-hoo,\" and ran along in their direction.  It took but a few moments for him to reach the party.  \"I'm late,\" he apologized, his grin and freckles supplying real local color to the dramatic statement.  \"Had to dig a big fern root for Mary.\"  \"Oh, for our Mary--the queer Mary?\" exclaimed Grace.  \"They call her Maid Mary,\" went on Jack, \"but she ain't big enough to be no maid.  She couldn't cook nor nuthin'.\"  \"Maid Mary!\" repeated Cleo.  \"That's awfully romantic.  Wherever did she get the maid tacked on?\"  \"That's her name,\" insisted Jack.  \"She al'lus says it is, when you ask her.\"  \"But where is she now?  We want to see her,\" said Grace.  \"Come along then and I'll show you where she's diggin'.  She's al'lus diggin' roots.\"  Now, all keyed up, and plainly excited that Jack and Mally should lead them so readily to their quarry, the girls followed the boys in silence--the boys, however, did plenty of talking to fill in the breach.  They evidently cared less for Maid Mary than they did for \"Sunnies,\" and as the creek was their hunting ground for the wily little fish and they were now going away from the pools and puddles that ran and swelled into the creek, both lads were inclined to travel faster than even scout girls could follow over the rough hills.  \"There she is!\" exclaimed Mally, pointing to a white speck in a green field.  \"Better run up quiet or she'll dash off like a deer,\" and making some mysterious sign to Jack, the erstwhile pathfinders darted off themselves toward their clew.  \"There she is,\" repeated Grace, \"and as brother Benny would say, Now it is up to us!\"     CHAPTER VI  A LITTLE MAID IN CLOVER  \"Do hurry, Madie, she may run away!\" warned Cleo.  They were hurrying indeed, and the request seemed superfluous, for never did three girls make more haste in crossing that stretch of meadow.  In fact Grace and Cleo were running, and now Madaline jumped to their pace.  \"Do you think maybe they keep goats?\" the latter managed to ask, and in spite of their serious haste both Cleo and Grace shouted in laughter.  \"Goats!\" they both exclaimed.  \"Because if they do I'm not going near the old place.  I'm awfully afraid of goats and geese.\"  \"Because you're so nice and fat!\" teased Cleo.  \"You're afraid they'll take you for--for sausage.  But--here we are!  Don't let us frighten the child,\" and her voice was now lowered to a whisper.  The little girl, with the long brown braids, sat in a bed of beautiful pink clover, and with her back to the intruders she had not yet sensed their approach.  As before, she wore a white dress and no hat.  \"Hello!\" spoke Grace cautiously.  She sprang up, but Cleo placed her hand kindly on the basket of ferns and clovers.  \"Oh, don't go!\" pleaded Cleo.  \"We want to talk to you.\"  \"But I can't,\" faltered the child, and the rich cultured tone betrayed her good breeding.  In fact she used the long \"a\" in can't and the girls at once decided she was English.  \"Oh, why not?\" Cleo followed up quickly.  \"Don't you want to know us? We are strangers here.\"  \"I should love to know you,\" the girl replied, and the tanned skin was suffused with a conscious blush, \"but I am not permitted to make friends.\"  \"But we are Girl Scouts,\" argued Grace, assuming her most cajoling air, \"and we are supposed to make friends with everybody,\" she finished. Grace tactfully fondled a beautiful spray of clover that was making its way out of Mary's basket.  This action evidently pleased the child, for she smiled, and handed the spray over to its admirer.  \"I have read of Girl Scouts,\" answered the stranger, \"and if only granddaddy would allow me what a wonderful time we could have!  Do you all gather flowers in nature study, as your books say you should?\"  \"Oh, yes, indeed we do,\" replied Cleo heartily.  \"Do sit down on this little mound where you were when we came along, and let us have a nice quiet talk.  No one is near to hear us!\"  At that the strange girl glanced furtively toward a clump of blackberry bushes and put her finger to her lips.  \"Reda is there, my nurse, you know, and she is very strict.  I could win granddaddy over only for her,\" and the deep-set eyes seemed to freeze over in that glassy stare the girls had noticed before.  \"Quick, tell us, where do you live?  May we go to your house?  Perhaps your grandfather would like us?\"  Cleo was crowding her questions, lest the woman called Reda should suddenly pounce upon them.  \"Perhaps,\" said the girl, now so dreamy and vague the girls almost felt helpless to pursue their mission.  \"Do tell us where, please!\" pleaded Grace, watching the bushes swish back from the place she felt Reda was concealed in.  \"By the big twin chestnuts,\" replied the child.  \"What is your name?\" asked Cleo eagerly.  \"Maid Mary!\" again came an answer, but the little stranger was now"]]]
