KING.      That, living, you might learn to live, and rule      Yourself and Poland.       SEG.      By the means you took      To spoil for either?       KING.      Nay, but, Segismund!      You know not--cannot know--happily wanting      The sad experience on which knowledge grows,      How the too early consciousness of power      Spoils the best blood; nor whether for your long      Constrain'd disheritance (which, but for me,      Remember, and for my relenting love      Bursting the bond of fate, had been eternal)      You have not now a full indemnity;      Wearing the blossom of your youth unspent      In the voluptuous sunshine of a court,      That often, by too early blossoming,      Too soon deflowers the rose of royalty.       SEG.      Ay, but what some precocious warmth may spill,      May not an early frost as surely kill?       KING.      But, Segismund, my son, whose quick discourse      Proves I have not extinguish'd and destroy'd      The Man you charge me with extinguishing,      However it condemn me for the fault      Of keeping a good light so long eclipsed,      Reflect! This is the moment upon which      Those stars, whose eyes, although we see them not,      By day as well as night are on us still,      Hang watching up in the meridian heaven      Which way the balance turns; and if to you--      As by your dealing God decide it may,      To my confusion!--let me answer it      Unto yourself alone, who shall at once      Approve yourself to be your father's judge,      And sovereign of Poland in his stead,      By justice, mercy, self-sobriety,      And all the reasonable attributes      Without which, impotent to rule himself,      Others one cannot, and one must not rule;      But which if you but show the blossom of--      All that is past we shall but look upon      As the first out-fling of a generous nature      Rioting in first liberty; and if      This blossom do but promise such a flower      As promises in turn its kindly fruit:      Forthwith upon your brows the royal crown,      That now weighs heavy on my aged brows,      I will devolve; and while I pass away      Into some cloister, with my Maker there      To make my peace in penitence and prayer,      Happily settle the disorder'd realm      That now cries loudly for a lineal heir.       SEG.      And so--      When the crown falters on your shaking head,      And slips the sceptre from your palsied hand,      And Poland for her rightful heir cries out;      When not only your stol'n monopoly      Fails you of earthly power, but 'cross the grave      The judgment-trumpet of another world      Calls you to count for your abuse of this;      Then, oh then, terrified by the double danger,      You drag me from my den--      Boast not of giving up at last the power      You can no longer hold, and never rightly      Held, but in fee for him you robb'd it from;      And be assured your Savage, once let loose,      Will not be caged again so quickly; not      By threat or adulation to be tamed,      Till he have had his quarrel out with those      Who made him what he is.       KING.      Beware! Beware!      Subdue the kindled Tiger in your eye,      Nor dream that it was sheer necessity      Made me thus far relax the bond of fate,      And, with far more of terror than of hope      Threaten myself, my people, and the State.      Know that, if old, I yet have vigour left      To wield the sword as well as wear the crown;      And if my more immediate issue fail,      Not wanting scions of collateral blood,      Whose wholesome growth shall more than compensate      For all the loss of a distorted stem.       SEG.      That will I straightway bring to trial--Oh,      After a revelation such as this,      The Last Day shall have little left to show      Of righted wrong and villainy requited!      Nay, Judgment now beginning upon earth,      Myself, methinks, in sight of all my wrongs,      Appointed heaven's avenging minister,      Accuser, judge, and executioner      Sword in hand, cite the guilty--First, as worst,      The usurper of his son's inheritance;      Him and his old accomplice, time and crime      Inveterate, and unable to repay      The golden years of life they stole away.      What, does he yet maintain his state, and keep      The throne he should be judged from? Down with him,      That I may trample on the false white head      So long has worn my crown! Where are my soldiers?      Of all my subjects and my vassals here      Not one to do my bidding? Hark! A trumpet!      The trumpet--       (He pauses as the trumpet sounds as in Act I.,       and masked Soldiers gradually fill in behind the Throne.)       KING (rising before his throne).      Ay, indeed, the trumpet blows      A memorable note, to summon those      Who, if forthwith you fall not at the feet      Of him whose head you threaten with the dust,      Forthwith shall draw the curtain of the Past      About you; and this momentary gleam      Of glory that you think to hold life-fast,      So coming, so shall vanish, as a dream.       SEG.      He prophesies; the old man prophesies;      And, at his trumpet's summons, from the tower      The leash-bound shadows loosen'd after me      My rising glory reach and over-lour--      But, reach not I my height, he shall not hold,      But with me back to his own darkness!       (He dashes toward the throne and is enclosed by the soldiers.)       Traitors!      Hold off! Unhand me!--Am not I your king?      And you would strangle him!--      But I am breaking with an inward Fire      Shall scorch you off, and wrap me on the wings      Of conflagration from a kindled pyre      Of lying prophecies and prophet-kings      Above the extinguish'd stars--Reach me the sword      He flung me--Fill me such a bowl of wine      As that you woke the day with--       KING.      And shall close,--      But of the vintage that Clotaldo knows.       (Exeunt.)     ACT III.     SCENE I.--The Tower, etc., as in Act I. Scene I.  Segismund, as at first, and Clotaldo.       CLOTALDO.      Princes and princesses, and counsellors      Fluster'd to right and left--my life made at--      But that was nothing      Even the white-hair'd, venerable King      Seized on--Indeed, you made wild work of it;      And so discover'd in your outward action,      Flinging your arms about you in your sleep,      Grinding your teeth--and, as I now remember,      Woke mouthing out judgment and execution,      On those about you.       SEG.      Ay, I did indeed.       CLO.      Ev'n now your eyes stare wild; your hair stands up--      Your pulses throb and flutter, reeling still      Under the storm of such a dream--       SEG.      A dream!      That seem'd as swearable reality      As what I wake in now.       CLO.      Ay--wondrous how      Imagination in a sleeping brain      Out of the uncontingent senses draws      Sensations strong as from the real touch;      That we not only laugh aloud, and drench      With tears our pillow; but in the agony      Of some imaginary conflict, fight      And struggle--ev'n as you did; some, 'tis thought,      Under the dreamt-of stroke of death have died.       SEG.      And what so very strange too--In that world      Where place as well as people all was strange,      Ev'n I almost as strange unto myself,      You only, you, Clotaldo--you, as much      And palpably yourself as now you are,      Came in this very garb you ever wore,      By such a token of the past, you said,      To assure me of that seeming present.       CLO.      Ay?       SEG.      Ay; and even told me of the very stars      You tell me here of--how in spite of them,      I was enlarged to all that glory.       CLO.      Ay, By the false spirits' nice contrivance thus      A little truth oft leavens all the false,      The better to delude us.       SEG.      For you know      'Tis nothing but a dream?       CLO.      Nay, you yourself      Know best how lately you awoke from that      You know you went to sleep on?--      Why, have you never dreamt the like before?       SEG.      Never, to such reality.       CLO.      Such dreams      Are oftentimes the sleeping exhalations      Of that ambition that lies smouldering      Under the ashes of the lowest fortune;      By which, when reason slumbers, or has lost      The reins of sensible comparison,      We fly at something higher than we are--      Scarce ever dive to lower--to be kings,      Or conquerors, crown'd with laurel or with gold,      Nay, mounting heaven itself on eagle wings.      Which, by the way, now that I think of it,      May furnish us the key to this high flight      That royal Eagle we were watching, and      Talking of as you went to sleep last night.       SEG.      Last night? Last night?       CLO.      Ay, do you not remember      Envying his immunity of flight,      As, rising from his throne of rock, he sail'd      Above the mountains far into the West,      That burn'd about him, while with poising wings      He darkled in it as a burning brand      Is seen to smoulder in the fire it feeds?       SEG.      Last night--last night--Oh, what a day was that      Between that last night and this sad To-day!       CLO.      And yet, perhaps,      Only some few dark moments, into which      Imagination, once lit up within      And unconditional of time and space,      Can pour infinities.       SEG.      And I remember      How the old man they call'd the King, who wore      The crown of gold about his silver hair,      And a mysterious girdle round his waist,      Just when my rage was roaring at its height,      And after which it all was dark again,      Bid me beware lest all should be a dream.       CLO.      Ay--there another"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2587"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#8)"],["body"," of dreams,      That once the dreamer 'gins to dream he dreams,      His foot is on the very verge of waking.       SEG.      Would it had been upon the verge of death      That knows no waking--      Lifting me up to glory, to fall back,      Stunn'd, crippled--wretcheder than ev'n before.       CLO.      Yet not so glorious, Segismund, if you      Your visionary honour wore so ill      As to work murder and revenge on those      Who meant you well.       SEG.      Who meant me!--me! their Prince      Chain'd like a felon--       CLO.      Stay, stay--Not so fast,      You dream'd the Prince, remember.       SEG.      Then in dream      Revenged it only.       CLO.      True. But as they say      Dreams are rough copies of the waking soul      Yet uncorrected of the higher Will,      So that men sometimes in their dreams confess      An unsuspected, or forgotten, self;      One must beware to check--ay, if one may,      Stifle ere born, such passion in ourselves      As makes, we see, such havoc with our sleep,      And ill reacts upon the waking day.      And, by the bye, for one test, Segismund,      Between such swearable realities--      Since Dreaming, Madness, Passion, are akin      In missing each that salutary rein      Of reason, and the guiding will of man:      One test, I think, of waking sanity      Shall be that conscious power of self-control,      To curb all passion, but much most of all      That evil and vindictive, that ill squares      With human, and with holy canon less,      Which bids us pardon ev'n our enemies,      And much more those who, out of no ill will,      Mistakenly have taken up the rod      Which heaven, they think, has put into their hands.       SEG.      I think I soon shall have to try again--      Sleep has not yet done with me.       CLO.      Such a sleep.      Take my advice--'tis early yet--the sun      Scarce up above the mountain; go within,      And if the night deceived you, try anew      With morning; morning dreams they say come true.       SEG.      Oh, rather pray for me a sleep so fast      As shall obliterate dream and waking too.       (Exit into the tower.)       CLO.      So sleep; sleep fast: and sleep away those two      Night-potions, and the waking dream between      Which dream thou must believe; and, if to see      Again, poor Segismund! that dream must be.--      And yet, and yet, in these our ghostly lives,      Half night, half day, half sleeping, half awake,      How if our waking life, like that of sleep,      Be all a dream in that eternal life      To which we wake not till we sleep in death?      How if, I say, the senses we now trust      For date of sensible comparison,--      Ay, ev'n the Reason's self that dates with them,      Should be in essence or intensity      Hereafter so transcended, and awake      To a perceptive subtlety so keen      As to confess themselves befool'd before,      In all that now they will avouch for most?      One man--like this--but only so much longer      As life is longer than a summer's day,      Believed himself a king upon his throne,      And play'd at hazard with his fellows' lives,      Who cheaply dream'd away their lives to him.      The sailor dream'd of tossing on the flood:      The soldier of his laurels grown in blood:      The lover of the beauty that he knew      Must yet dissolve to dusty residue:      The merchant and the miser of his bags      Of finger'd gold; the beggar of his rags:      And all this stage of earth on which we seem      Such busy actors, and the parts we play'd,      Substantial as the shadow of a shade,      And Dreaming but a dream within a dream!       FIFE.      Was it not said, sir,      By some philosopher as yet unborn,      That any chimney-sweep who for twelve hours      Dreams himself king is happy as the king      Who dreams himself twelve hours a chimney-sweep?       CLO.      A theme indeed for wiser heads than yours      To moralize upon--How came you here?--       FIFE.      Not of my own will, I assure you, sir.      No matter for myself: but I would know      About my mistress--I mean, master--       CLO.      Oh, Now I remember--Well, your master-mistress      Is well, and deftly on its errand speeds,      As you shall--if you can but hold your tongue.      Can you?       FIFE.      I'd rather be at home again.       CLO.      Where you shall be the quicker if while here      You can keep silence.       FIFE.      I may whistle, then?      Which by the virtue of my name I do,      And also as a reasonable test      Of waking sanity--       CLO.      Well, whistle then;      And for another reason you forgot,      That while you whistle, you can chatter not.      Only remember--if you quit this pass--       FIFE.      (His rhymes are out, or he had call'd it spot)--       CLO.      A bullet brings you to.      I must forthwith to court to tell the King      The issue of this lamentable day,      That buries all his hope in night.      (To FIFE.)      Farewell. Remember.       FIFE.      But a moment--but a word!      When shall I see my mis--mas--       CLO.      Be content:      All in good time; and then, and not before,      Never to miss your master any more.      (Exit.)       FIFE.      Such talk of dreaming--dreaming--I begin      To doubt if I be dreaming I am Fife,      Who with a lad who call'd herself a boy      Because--I doubt there's some confusion here--      He wore no petticoat, came on a time      Riding from Muscovy on half a horse,      Who must have dreamt she was a horse entire,      To cant me off upon my hinder face      Under this tower, wall-eyed and musket-tongued,      With sentinels a-pacing up and down,      Crying All's well when all is far from well,      All the day long, and all the night, until      I dream--if what is dreaming be not waking--      Of bells a-tolling and processions rolling      With candles, crosses, banners, San-benitos,      Of which I wear the flamy-finingest,      Through streets and places throng'd with fiery faces      To some back platform--      Oh, I shall take a fire into my hand      With thinking of my own dear Muscovy--      Only just over that Sierra there,      By which we tumbled headlong into--No-land.      Now, if without a bullet after me,      I could but get a peep of my old home      Perhaps of my own mule to take me there--      All's still--perhaps the gentlemen within      Are dreaming it is night behind their masks--      God send 'em a good nightmare!--Now then--Hark!      Voices--and up the rocks--and armed men      Climbing like cats--Puss in the corner then.       (He hides.)       (Enter Soldiers cautiously up the rocks.)       CAPTAIN.      This is the frontier pass, at any rate,      Where Poland ends and Muscovy begins.       SOLDIER.      We must be close upon the tower, I know,      That half way up the mountain lies ensconced.       CAPT.      How know you that?       SOL.      He told me so--the Page      Who put us on the scent.       SOL. 2.      And, as I think,      Will soon be here to run it down with us.       CAPT.      Meantime, our horses on these ugly rocks      Useless, and worse than useless with their clatter--      Leave them behind, with one or two in charge,      And softly, softly, softly.       SOLDIERS.      --There it is!      --There what?      --The tower--the fortress--      --That the tower!--      --That mouse-trap! We could pitch it down the rocks      With our own hands.      --The rocks it hangs among      Dwarf its proportions and conceal its strength;      Larger and stronger than you think.      --No matter;      No place for Poland's Prince to be shut up in.      At it at once!       CAPT.      No--no--I tell you wait--      Till those within give signal. For as yet      We know not who side with us, and the fort      Is strong in man and musket.       SOL.      Shame to wait      For odds with such a cause at stake.       CAPT.      Because      Of such a cause at stake we wait for odds--      For if not won at once, for ever lost:      For any long resistance on their part      Would bring Basilio's force to succour them      Ere we had rescued him we come to rescue.      So softly, softly, softly, still--       A SOLDIER (discovering Fife).      Hilloa!       SOLDIERS.      --Hilloa! Here's some one skulking--      --Seize and gag him!      --Stab him at once, say I: the only way      To make all sure.      --Hold, every man of you!      And down upon your knees!--Why, 'tis the Prince!      --The Prince!--      --Oh, I should know him anywhere,      And anyhow disguised.      --But the Prince is chain'd.      --And of a loftier presence--      --'Tis he, I tell you;      Only bewilder'd as he was before.      God save your Royal Highness! On our knees      Beseech you answer us!       FIFE.      Just as you please.      Well--'tis this country's custom, I suppose,      To take a poor man every now and then      And set him ON the throne; just for the fun      Of tumbling him again into the dirt.      And now my turn is come. 'Tis very pretty.       SOL.      His wits have been distemper'd with their drugs.      But do you ask him, Captain.       CAPT.      On my knees,      And in the name of all who kneel with me,      I do beseech your Highness answer to      Your royal title.       FIFE.      Still, just as you please.      In my own poor opinion of myself--      But that may all be dreaming, which it seems      Is very much the fashion in this country      No Polish prince at all, but a poor lad      From Muscovy; where only help me back,      I promise never to contest the crown      Of Poland with whatever gentleman      You fancy to set up.       SOLDIERS.      --From Muscovy?      --A spy then--      --Of Astolfo's--      --Spy! a spy      --Hang him at once!       FIFE.      No, pray don't dream of that!       SOL.      How dared you then set yourself up for our Prince Segismund?       FIFE.      _I_ set up!--_I_ "]]]
