The bullet sped true to its mark, and the guerilla went down, shot through the right knee.  \"Hang yer cursed Yankee trick!\" he groaned, as Deck came up to him, totally uninjured from the shot aimed at him a minute previously. Lying as he was, he attempted to fire again, but the major kicked the pistol from his grasp and Faraway pounced upon him and pinned him to the ground.  \"Any kind of a trick would be justifiable in capturing such a rascal as you,\" said Deck, as he directed Faraway to disarm the prisoner. This done, and making sure that the fellow could not walk away, they propped him up on the creek bridge and left him.  Returning to the vicinity of the mansion, Deck found that one other guerilla had been captured by Artie and Clinker, and that white men and negroes were scattered in all directions endeavoring to round up the remainder. The search for the fleeing ones was kept up until midnight, and two others were wounded and taken into custody.  All the prisoners were either marched or carried to Fort Bedford, and here the wounded ones were cared for as tenderly as though they were friends instead of enemies. The dead were laid out for burial, unless the bodies should be claimed by relatives or friends.  Deck had bound a silk handkerchief around his neck, which felt stiff where the bullet had scratched it. Artie had been hurt, too, but the wound was of small consequence. The Unionists received even greater care than the guerillas.  It was exactly two o'clock in the morning when Deck came into the mansion thoroughly worn out by what he had passed through. Mrs. Lyon had ordered Diana (not Dinah, if you please) to prepare the best meal Riverlawn could afford, and while the family and the other whites sat down in the dining room, the negroes made themselves comfortable in the spacious kitchen. In the meantime the prisoners at the fort were kept under close guard and a messenger was despatched to notify the county authorities of what had taken place.  The mansion had been turned topsy-turvy, and a few articles of bric-Ã -brac had been smashed, but otherwise the loss did not seem to be of much consequence outside of the fact that two dozen silver spoons and a gold butter dish were missing, also some wine and whiskey put down in the cellar by Duncan Lyon and which the family of Noah had never touched.  \"I do not mind the liquor, but I do mind the loss of my mother's spoons,\" said Mrs. Noah. \"However, I am glad matters are no worse.\"  \"I was afraid they would break open father's safe,\" said Deck, referring to the strong box in the library, in which the colonel was wont to keep his cash and his private papers. \"I was much relieved to see it still locked up.\"  While Deck had been speaking Levi came in, and now he turned to Mrs. Lyon. \"That safe--I left it open for you,\" he cried hurriedly. \"Did you--\"  \"I left it open,\" gasped Mrs. Lyon, falling back in her chair. \"I forgot all about it until just now--the guerillas scared me so when they marched in. If they--\"  \"The safe is shut--but still--\" began Deck, and arising hastily he hurried to the library, with Levi, Artie, and the women folks at his heels. The door refused to budge and Levi worked the combination, a new device Noah Lyon had had put on the door just before leaving home for the seat of war.  When the strong box came open a mass of private papers and account-books fell out upon the carpeted floor, and it was easy to surmise that the guerillas had looted the safe of all that could be made valuable to them. Levi declared three hundred dollars in gold gone, also two hundred in United States paper money, besides a small box of jewellery, the most valuable articles in which had been a diamond ring and a diamond stud Duncan Lyon had worn during his life, and of which no disposition had ever been made.  \"We are five hundred dollars out by this raid,\" said Artie, while Mrs. Lyon shook her head sadly. \"We had better question the prisoners about this.\"  He went off to do so, accompanied by Levi. While they were gone Deck proceeded to arrange the scattered books and papers and restore them to their original resting places.  \"Hullo!\" he ejaculated, as he picked up an empty envelope. It was marked! \"Not to be opened till five years from the date of my death. Duncan Lyon.\"  \"The secret envelope uncle left to father!\" cried out Hope. \"Oh, Deck, where are the contents?\"  \"That is what I should like to know,\" responded her brother, kneeling down with a hand lamp, the better to see. A large batch of papers were sorted with great care, but nothing which might have belonged in the envelope was unearthed.  \"This is worse than the loss of the money or the spoons,\" sobbed Mrs. Lyon, bursting into tears. \"Your father has always been very careful of that secret communication, which he thought related to your Uncle Duncan's slaves. I am sure he will be much put out when he finds the contents of the envelope gone.\"  Mrs. Lyon's tears set the girls to crying, and it took some time for Deck to quiet the three. In the meanwhile he had all the female colored help in the mansion search for the missing paper. These people brought him a dozen or more sheets from out-of-the-way corners, but all proved valueless, and at length Deck strode down to the fort.  The prisoners had been searched, but nothing had been found on them of value. Each man was closely questioned, and the timid guerilla who had carried the second flag of truce that afternoon admitted that he had seen a certain fellow known as Totterly at the safe and had seen the guerilla tear open an envelope, look over its contents and then cram a paper in his coat pocket. Totterly had also taken a chamois bag--the bag which contained the three hundred dollars in gold. Who had taken the paper money was not known to the timid prisoner, nor did he know anything about the spoons.  \"I didn't want to jine them sodgers,\" he whined. \"Gaffy Denny talked me into it. Wish I had a-stayed on my dad's plantation in Logan County.\"  \"Yes, you would have been much better off,\" answered Deck, briefly.  The discovery of the loss sustained put a damper on the supper, and several of Diana's best dishes were hardly touched. But nothing could just then be done, and after Mrs. Lyon and the girls had told how they had been surprised by Gaffy Denny and his men and locked up in the storeroom off of the dining apartment, each of the party retired to catch a few hours of sleep. It is safe to say the lady of the mansion and the girls hardly closed their eyes, but Deck and Artie were growing used to excitement and had slumbered in the very midst of a battlefield, and they rested soundly.  On the day following, several of the county authorities put into appearance, and the prisoners were taken away to Bowling Green, some to the prison, and the wounded ones to a hospital. A vigorous search was instituted for Totterly, but nothing was learned about him further than that he had confiscated a horse at a little settlement known as Culver's, and had been seen riding with all speed directly south for the Tennessee State line.  Deck and Artie accompanied the prisoners to the county seat, and on returning to Riverlawn in the afternoon an hour's call was made at Lyndhall--a space of time all too short for the major, for Kate Belthorpe wished to know all about the affair at the mansion, and he was impatient to ask her about herself. Artie, knowing a thing or two or imagining he did, very considerately drew Margie Belthorpe to listen to what he might have to relate, so the affectionate pair were left alone part of the time, something which Deck very much appreciated, and to which pretty Kate did not at all object. The girl shuddered when he was forced to admit that he had been scratched on the neck by a bullet, and flinging her arms about his shoulders begged him to be more prudent in the future, and this he promised--for her sake, as he said in a whisper, and the compact was sealed with a kiss which if not exactly brotherly or sisterly was fully as affectionate.  \"I suppose you proposed, didn't you?\" said Artie, when he and Deck were galloping home. \"I gave you the best chance in the world.\"  \"I--I--don't be foolish, Artie,\" returned the young major, and blushed. \"No,\" he went on, after a pause, \"I didn't--but--I reckon it's all right--at least I hope it is;\" and Artie clapped him on the back heartily and said he was positive it was all right, and they shook hands. After that the cousins were more brotherly than ever before.     CHAPTER VII  IN WHICH THE ENEMY'S SUPPLIES ARE CONFISCATED   \"Deck, what is that glittering over there?\" cried Artie, as they were crossing the creek bridge. \"I declare, it's one of mother's spoons!\"  \"You're right, Artie,\" answered the major, leaping to the ground. \"And here is another. That rascal I wounded must have thrown them away after I left him on the bridge bench.\"  Artie dismounted also, and the pair began a rigorous search for the balance of the missing silverware. Four additional spoons were brought to light, all having lain within a distance of two yards of each other.  \"That's all,\" said Artie, after looking around for quarter of an hour without finding any more. \"More than likely several of the guerillas divided the tableware between them.\"  Mrs. Lyon was much pleased over the recovery of even a part of the stolen property, and a hunt was immediately instituted at the various spots where the prisoners had been shot down or captured. Before night a dozen and a half spoons were in, also the gold butter dish. The other spoons were never found, although long after it was learned that the thief had thrown them into the creek.  Immediately after learning what was to be ascertained concerning Totterly, Levi had gone off with General"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25447"],["title","Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/Canadian Libraries)              *       *       *       *       *      +-----------------------------------------------------------+     | Transcriber's Note:                                       |     |                                                           |     | Inconsistent hyphenation in the original document has     |     | been preserved.                                           |     |                                                           |     | Mathematical equations and variables are marked with      |     | [Math:] to reduce confusion between underscores used for  |     | italics and underscores used to indicate subscripts.      |     | Subscripts are indicated with underscores, with the       |     | subscripted character marked with {}'s, i.e.: x_{t}       |     |                                                           |     | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.

Ltd., Watford, Herts._     PREFACE   The following essays have been written and published at various times, and my thanks are due to the previous publishers for the permission to reprint them.  The essay on \"Mysticism and Logic\" appeared in the _Hibbert Journal_ for July, 1914. \"The Place of Science in a Liberal Education\" appeared in two numbers of _The New Statesman_, May 24 and 31, 1913. \"The Free Man's Worship\" and \"The Study of Mathematics\" were included in a former collection (now out of print), _Philosophical Essays_, also published by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. Both were written in 1902; the first appeared originally in the _Independent Review_ for 1903, the second in the _New Quarterly_, November, 1907. In theoretical Ethics, the position advocated in \"The Free Man's Worship\" is not quite identical with that which I hold now: I feel less convinced than I did then of the objectivity of good and evil. But the general attitude towards life which is suggested in that essay still seems to me, in the main, the one which must be adopted in times of stress and difficulty by those who have no dogmatic religious beliefs, if inward defeat is to be avoided.  The essay on \"Mathematics and the Metaphysicians\" was written in 1901, and appeared in an American magazine, _The International Monthly_, under the title \"Recent Work in the Philosophy of Mathematics.\" Some points in this essay require modification in view of later work. These are indicated in footnotes. Its tone is partly explained by the fact that the editor begged me to make the article \"as romantic as possible.\"  All the above essays are entirely popular, but those that follow are somewhat more technical. \"On Scientific Method in Philosophy\" was the Herbert Spencer lecture at Oxford in 1914, and was published by the Clarendon Press, which has kindly allowed me to include it in this collection. \"The Ultimate Constituents of Matter\" was an address to the Manchester Philosophical Society, early in 1915, and was published in the _Monist_ in July of that year. The essay on \"The Relation of Sense-data to Physics\" was written in January, 1914, and first appeared in No. 4 of that year's volume of _Scientia_, an International Review of Scientific Synthesis, edited by M. Eugenio Rignano, published monthly by Messrs. Williams and Norgate, London, Nicola Zanichelli, Bologna, and FÃ©lix Alcan, Paris. The essay \"On the Notion of Cause\" was the presidential address to the Aristotelian Society in November, 1912, and was published in their _Proceedings_ for 1912-13. \"Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description\" was also a paper read before the Aristotelian Society, and published in their _Proceedings_ for 1910-11.

Some men have achieved greatness through one of these impulses alone, others through the other alone: in Hume, for example, the scientific impulse reigns quite unchecked, while in Blake a strong hostility to science co-exists with profound mystic insight. But the greatest men who have been philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism: the attempt to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what always must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make philosophy, to some minds, a greater thing than either science or religion.  Before attempting an explicit characterisation of the scientific and the mystical impulses, I will illustrate them by examples from two philosophers whose greatness lies in the very intimate blending which they achieved. The two philosophers I mean are Heraclitus and Plato.  Heraclitus, as every one knows, was a believer in universal flux: time builds and destroys all things. From the few fragments that remain, it is not easy to discover how he arrived at his opinions, but there are some sayings that strongly suggest scientific observation as the source.  \"The things that can be seen, heard, and learned,\" he says, \"are what I prize the most.\" This is the language of the empiricist, to whom observation is the sole guarantee of truth. \"The sun is new every day,\" is another fragment; and this opinion, in spite of its paradoxical character, is obviously inspired by scientific reflection, and no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding how the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the night. Actual observation must also have suggested to him his central doctrine, that Fire is the one permanent substance, of which all visible things are passing phases. In combustion we see things change utterly, while their flame and heat rise up into the air and vanish.  \"This world, which is the same for all,\" he says, \"no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be, an ever-living Fire, with measures kindling, and measures going out.\"  \"The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.\"  This theory, though no longer one which science can accept, is nevertheless scientific in spirit. Science, too, might have inspired the famous saying to which Plato alludes: \"You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\" But we find also another statement among the extant"]]]
