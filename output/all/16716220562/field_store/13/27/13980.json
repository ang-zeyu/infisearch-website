What's the matter?\"  Instead of answering, Dr. Frank Cannon turned to the Navy medic. \"I'll let the commander explain that. What's your diagnosis, doctor?\"  The commander ran his tongue nervously over his lips before speaking. \"There's apparently a small blood clot in the brain, Mr. President, interfering with the functioning of the efferent nerves.\"  \"Permanent?\"  \"We don't know yet, sir. We hope not.\"  President Cannon sighed. \"Well. Thank you, commander. And now, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak to my brother--alone.\"  The commander glanced at Dr. Frank, then back at the President. \"Certainly, sir.\" He turned to leave.  \"Just a moment, commander,\" Dr. Frank said. \"There'll be news reporters out there. Tell them--\" He frowned a little. \"Tell them that the President is conscious and quite rational, but that there is still some weakness. I don't think anything more than that will be necessary.\"  \"I agree. Certainly, doctor.\" At the door, the commander paused and said: \"I'll keep everyone out until you call.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Dr. Frank as the door closed behind the Navy man.  As soon as it closed, President Cannon struggled to get up.  \"Don't try it, kid,\" the doctor said, \"those muscles are paralyzed, even if you aren't sick. Here, let me help you.\"  \"How did it come off?\" Cannon asked as his brother propped him up.  \"Perfectly. No one doubts that it's a stroke. Now what?\"  \"Give me a cigarette.\"  \"All right, but watch it. Use your right hand, and smoke with the right side of your mouth. Here.\" The doctor lit a cigarette and handed it to his brother. \"Now, what's the next step?\"  \"The next step is to tell Matthew Fisher,\" said the President.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Frank Cannon scowled. \"Why? Why not just go through with the thing and let him be fooled along with the rest? It seems to me he'd be ... well, more secure in his own position if he didn't know.\"  \"No.\" The President hunched himself up on his pillows. \"Can't you raise the head of this bed?\"  Dr. Frank touched a button on the bedside panel, and the upper portion of the bed rose smoothly at an angle. \"Better?\"  \"Fine. Much better.\"  \"You were saying--\"  \"Yeah. About Matt Fisher. He has to know. He'll guess eventually, in the next four years, anyway--unless I hide away somewhere. And I have no intention of doing that.  \"Oh, I'm not trying to show Matt what a great guy I am, Frank. You know better than that, and so will he. But Matt will have to have all the facts at hand, if he's to do his job right, and it seems to me that this is a pretty important fact. What do you say, Frank?\"  The doctor nodded slowly. \"I think you know more about the situation than I do. And I trust your judgment, kid. And Matt's, too, I guess.\"  \"No.\" President Cannon's voice was firm as he looked at his brother with one bright eye. \"Don't trust Matt's judgment, because he doesn't have any.\"  Dr. Frank looked astonished. \"Then _what_--?\" He stopped.  \"Matthew Fisher,\" said President Cannon authoritatively, \"doesn't need judgment any more than _you_ need instinct. No more so, and no less. I said he doesn't have any judgment, but that's not exactly true. He has it, but he only uses it for routine work, just as you or I use instinct. We can override our instinctive reactions when we have to. Matt can override his judgment when he has to.  \"I don't pretend to know how Fisher's mind works. If I did, I wouldn't be doing this. But I _do_ know that Matt Fisher--by some mental process I can't even fathom--almost invariably knows the _right_ thing to do, and he knows it without using judgment.\"  \"And you're still convinced that this is the only way out?\" Dr. Frank asked. \"Couldn't you stay in office and let him run things under cover?\"  \"We discussed all this months ago, Frank,\" Cannon said wearily. \"My reasons remain the same. Matt couldn't possibly operate efficiently if he had to go through me every time. And I am human, too; I'd have a tendency to impose my own judgment on his decisions.  \"No, Frank; this is the only way it can work. This country needs Matthew Fisher as President, but he could never have been elected. Now I've done my job; now it's time for me to get out of the way and turn the Presidency over to a man who can handle the office far better than any other man I know.\"  \"You make him sound like some sort of superman,\" said Dr. Frank with a wry grin.  \"Hell,\" said President Cannon, \"you don't think I'd turn this job over to anything less, do you?\" He chuckled. \"Call him in, will you?\"         *       *       *       *       *          PRESIDENT CANNON RESIGNS!        Ill Health Given As Reason;           Doctors Say Recovery         Unlikely In Near Future.     VP Fisher To Take Oath Tomorrow.

A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne. The gentleman was known to the public as Professor Hemmenway, who announced himself on the programme of his entertainment as \"The Magician of Madagascar,\" though he freely confessed to his confidential friends that he had never seen the island of that name.  The two boys were Harry Vane and Jack Pendleton, American boys of sixteen. One had come to Australia as assistant to the professor, and had been accustomed to sing one or two popular songs at the magical entertainments which he gave, besides rendering himself generally useful. Jack Pendleton was a young sailor, who had resolved to try his fortune in the new country, either at the mines or in any other employment offering fair compensation, before resuming his profession. Harry and the professor had been passengers on board Jack's ship, and the two boys had struck up an enduring friendship. The ship had been wrecked, and they had spent some weeks together on an uninhabited island, from which they were finally rescued, as related in a preceding story, \"Facing the World.\" It had been the professor's intention to give a series of performances in Melbourne and other parts of Australia, but the unexpected delay had led him to change his plans, and he now proposed to return to America at once. Harry Vane, however, having no near family ties, for he was an orphan, felt inclined to stay with Jack, and try his luck for a time in the New World, which appealed strongly to his imagination and youthful love of adventure. The day had arrived for the professor's departure, and he and the two boys were waiting for the lighter to take him down the Yarra Yarra River to the point of embarkation, eight miles distant.  \"Harry,\" said the professor kindly, \"I don't like to leave you here. You are only sixteen, and I feel that it is a great undertaking for you to attempt to make a living so many thousand miles from your native land. I shall feel anxious about you.\"  \"I don't feel anxious about myself, professor,\" said Harry, with the confidence natural to youth. \"I am young and strong, and I mean to succeed.\"  \"But suppose you fall sick?\"  \"Then Jack will look out for me.\"  \"You may be sure of that, Harry,\" said the young sailor, with a glance of affection at Harry.  \"You might both fall sick.\"  \"Is it best to borrow trouble?\" said Harry, smiling. \"I think we shall come out all right. But I am sorry you won't stay with us, professor.\"  Professor Hemmenway shook his head.  \"I am three times your age, Harry,\" he said, \"and am not as hopeful or sanguine as you. Besides, I have a wife and children at home who are already very anxious at my long silence; I did indeed mean to make a professional tour of Australia, but the shipwreck, and those lonely weeks on the island changed my plans. Henceforth I shall restrict myself to America. I have a competence already, and can make an income at home twice as large as my expenses. Why should I incur any risks?\"  \"I don't know but you are right, professor, but Jack and I are not so fortunate. Neither of us has a competence, and our prospects are probably better here than at home.\"  \"Remember, Harry, that if you return I shall be glad to continue your engagement and will even increase your salary.\"  Jack Pendleton fixed his eyes anxiously on Harry's face. He feared that he would yield to the professor's persuasion, and leave him, but his anxiety was soon removed.  \"Thank you, professor,\" said Harry, \"but I don't want to leave Jack. If I return in bad luck, I may look you up and see whether the offer still holds good.\"  \"Do so. You will always find a friend in me. But that reminds me, Harry, of an important consideration. If you are to remain here, you will want some money.\"  \"I have sixty dollars which I have saved up in your service.\"  \"And how much have you, Jack?\"  The young sailor colored, and looked a little uneasy.  \"I have only ten dollars,\" he answered.  \"That is, we have seventy dollars between us, Jack,\" said Harry promptly.  \"That is too little,\" said the professor, shaking his head. \"You must let me be your banker.\"  \"On one condition, professor, with thanks for your kindness.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"A gentleman at home, Mr. Thomas Conway, President of the Craven County Railroad, has charge of two hundred and fifty dollars belonging to me. I was fortunate enough to save a railroad train from destruction, and this is the money the passengers raised for me. I will give you an order on him for the amount of your loan.\"  \"That is unnecessary, Harry; I am willing to wait till your return to America.\"  \"Something might happen to me, professor, and I shall feel more comfortable to think that my debts are paid.\"  \"Have your own way, then, Harry. Shall I give you the whole amount?\"  \"No, professor, I am afraid it would make me less enterprising.\"  \"How much shall it be?\"  \"Jack and I have seventy dollars between us. A hundred more ought to be sufficient.\"  \"As you please, Harry, but if you get into trouble, promise to communicate with me, and send for assistance.\"  \"I will, sir.\"  At this moment a carriage drew up in front of the inn.  \"It is the carriage I ordered to take me to the lighter,\" said the professor. \"You and Jack must go with me to the ship and see the last of me.\"  \"With great pleasure, sir. Come along, Jack.\"  The hackman put the professor's trunk aboard the carriage, and they set out for the banks of the river. It was a new trunk, bought in Melbourne, for the professor's trunk and clothing had been lost at the time of the shipwreck. His first care had been to get a complete outfit in Melbourne, and he was now as well provided as when he left New York.  The two boys found the trip down the river a pleasant one. The trip by land would have been considerably shorter, but the professor preferred the river. The distance to the mouth is nine miles. Vessels would be able to ascend the river but for two bars which obstruct its course. The city of Melbourne is situated chiefly on the north bank, and is at"]]]
