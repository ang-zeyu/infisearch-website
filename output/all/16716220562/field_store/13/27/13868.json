Remember the world is a large place and there are plenty of fine positions waiting for the men who prove themselves big enough to fill them.\"  Peter took the superintendent's hand but he forgot to answer. Somehow Mr. Tyler's words awakened a train of thoughts which were so entirely new that he could not immediately drive them from his mind. So the great universe of work demanded that you should fill your position, not rattle round in it! The mere fact that one had a rich father did not help much then after all. It might aid you in keeping your job, to be sure, but it could not aid you in doing it. Evidently at the Coddington tanneries there were plenty of men ready to take your chance if you were not smart enough to hold on to it yourself. Peter decided that it behooved him to \"hustle.\" It was a novel sensation to feel this spur to action.  As he thus philosophized he was following his guide, who now turned down a flight of steep steps into a yard slippery with black mud and deeply rutted by the wheels of heavy wagons. A double track with a row of freight cars flanked the building opposite, and from these cars a group of men were unloading bundles of skins and tossing them on the platform. The men were dressed in faded jumpers and overalls and some of them wore rubber aprons.  They glanced up an instant as Peter drew near.  \"Carmachel,\" called the man who was showing the way, \"this young fellow is to help at unloading and later, the boss says, he is to watch you fellows sort skins. He is a green lad and,\" added the messenger with a grin of enjoyment at some joke that Peter did not at all comprehend, \"his name is Strong.\"  Carmachel, a grizzled Irishman, looked up--a twinkle in his eye.  \"It's Strong he'll have to be if he is to work here,\" he answered with a chuckle in which the others joined. \"I say, young one,\" he continued kindly, \"you're not figuring on unloading skins in those clothes, are you?\"  \"I was,\" replied Peter, nodding.  \"Well, before you begin, you better have another think. It will be the end of your glad rags. It's truth I'm tellin' you. Step inside the doorway and wriggle yourself into those brown jeans you'll see hangin' there.\"  Peter went in.  He took down the jeans from a peg behind the door. The clothes were dirty, sticky with salt, and in them lingered a loathsome aroma of wet hides. Instinctively he shrank from touching them. Then, gritting his teeth, he put them on. This he did more out of appreciation for the rough kindliness of the old Irishman than because he feared to injure his clothes; his father would give him plenty more suits if that one was spoiled.  When he went out on the platform Carmachel eyed him.  \"That's more like it,\" he said. \"Now get busy. We want to pull these cars out of the yard by noon. Step lively.\"  Peter crossed the wet, slippery platform to the car where the other men were working. The skins were folded neatly and tied with stout cord. He lifted the bundle nearest at hand, then dropped it. It was solid, sticky, and damp.  \"They're wet!\" he exclaimed.  \"For certain they're wet!\" roared the Irishman with a noisy guffaw. \"You're as green as the skins themselves--greener, for you are not even salted.\"  The gang on the platform shouted at the joke.  Peter's anger rose, but he struggled to take their chaffing in good part.  \"You see, I don't know a thing about all this business,\" confessed he, frankly. \"You fellows who do will have to tell me.\"  The answer struck the right note with the men.  \"How could you be expected to know, sonny?\" called a red-faced Swede kindly. \"Every boy who comes into the tannery has to learn.\"  \"Pitch a few skins out of the car, lad, while I tell you some things,\" broke in Carmachel. \"You are unloading calfskins; that's the only kind we tan at Factory 1. Over at Factory 2 they tan sheepskins, and at Factory 3 cowhides. In each of these factories the skins are treated and prepared for the trade quite differently, as you will learn by and by if you have the chance to go through the other buildings. These calfskins that we are unloading came from the Chicago slaughter-houses, where as soon as they were taken off the animals they were salted; folded with the head, tail, and small parts inside; tied in bales such as you see; and shipped. They are what we call green-salted. We also get green-salted skins from the abattoirs of the city of Paris, and from lots of other places, too. Sometimes, though, skins are salted green and are then dried like those you saw piled up in the shed; those we call dry-salted. They came from Norway, Sweden, and South America. Then we have dry hides which are dried without being salted at all. Remember now--green-salted, dry-salted, and dry.\"  Peter repeated the terms.  At the same time he did his share in tossing the heavy bales of moist skins to the platform. It was strenuous work. Before an hour was up his back and arms ached with the unaccustomed exercise. Tennis and football were as nothing to this! Still he went on uncomplainingly. His unflagging energy appealed to the men.  \"Knock off, lad, and rest a bit,\" called Carmachel at last. \"You're not toughened to this job as we are. It's a precious lame back you'll have to-morrow if you keep at it like this the first time.\"  Gratefully Peter straightened up and took a long breath. Then he glanced at his hands.  \"You'll be losing your gentlemanly white hands, if that's what's worrying you,\" grinned Carmachel, reading his thoughts with disconcerting keenness.  \"Oh, I'm not afraid of my hands,\" replied Peter, mortified at being detected in such a foolish reflection. \"I was just thinking that they are beginning to look the part.\"  \"If you are aiming to work up through the tannery they'll likely look the part more by the time you've got a few coats of lime and blacking on them,\" was Carmachel's dry response. \"Now we'll let the others finish this work. You come inside and you shall have a new job. You've done enough unloading for your first day.\"  Obediently Peter followed into the shed, where other men were busy cutting the cords from round the skins, looking them over, and tossing some into one pile and some into another.  \"These fellows that you see are sorting the calfskins according to their weight,\" explained Carmachel. \"We get them flat--by that I mean that when the bales are made up all sizes and qualities of skins are tied in together. These men put the fine, heavy ones in one pile, the medium weight in another, the light weight in another, the imperfect ones in another, and so on.\"  \"I do not see how they can tell so quickly,\" said Peter.  \"They couldn't if they hadn't done it a good many times before. They are skilled men. Watch them. It does not take them many minutes to determine the value of a skin.\"  \"And what are those other men doing?\" Peter questioned, pointing to a group of workmen who were engaged in swiftly cutting off parts of the skins with long knives.  \"Oh, they are taking off the heads and other good-for-nothing parts which are sold for glue stock. Nothing is wasted in a tannery, let me tell you! After the skins leave this room they will be sent to the beamhouse, where they will be soaked in water until all the dirt and salt is out of them. Usually this takes from twenty-four to forty-eight hours.\"  \"What's the beamhouse?\" was Peter's query.  \"The beamhouse? I'll not be telling you. 'Twould be a sin to spoil your first sight of it.\" Carmachel shook his head. \"No, young one, I'll tell you nothing of the beamhouse. You'll find out in time. There's many a pleasant spot awaiting you in this tannery.\"  A general snicker went around.  Again Peter did not understand.  \"Now,\" declared Carmachel briskly, \"you have idled long enough. Take that knife and go to cutting the twine from those bales of skins.\"  At this task the boy worked faithfully until the noon whistle blew. At its first blast all the men dropped what they were doing and Peter, who did the same, followed them into a washroom, where he scoured his hands with sand soap. Somehow he did not feel as scornful toward his box of lunch as he had when he had tucked it under his arm in the early morning. Instead he made his way out into the vacant field opposite where he saw the men congregating, and sitting down in the shade of one of the factories, lifted the tin cover with keenest anticipation. How good it seemed to rest, and how faint he was! He devoured the food hurriedly with the quick greed of hunger. He then glanced about him. Some boys and men were sauntering with bat and ball out into the open field. Apparently a noontide game was a part of the daily program, for two nines were quickly organized and a match was under way in the twinkling of an eye. The other workmen drew near to watch the play and so did Peter. He wondered how any one could summon energy enough to toss a ball. They couldn't be as tired as he was! The game began. Before it had proceeded beyond the first inning it was obvious that the teams were unevenly matched.  [Illustration: A MATCH WAS UNDER WAY]  \"It's the sheepskins against the calfskins--Factory 1 against Factory 2,\" explained a man at his elbow. \"Factory 1 could do 'em if we had a decent pitcher. O'Brien, who is pitching, isn't much even when he's in the best of trim; to-day he happens to have a sprained finger, so he's worse than usual.\"  Instantly Peter was alert. Wasn't he Factory 1? He forgot his fatigue--forgot everything except how it felt to pitch when one had a sprained finger.  \"I can pitch a ball,\" he ventured modestly.  \"Can you then? O'Brien!\" bawled the man. \"Here's a lad who says he can pitch. Give him a try, won't you?\"  Despite aching muscles and tired back Peter suddenly found himself on the diamond with the ball in his hands. It was the first familiar experience that had come to him that day. His blood warmed. He sent a twirler over the plate and was greeted by a roar from "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],["title","The Story of Leather (#4)"],["body","Factory 1 men. The ball dropped with a smack into the hands of the catcher.  Peter tried another.  He pitched a third.  Vainly the man at the bat tried to hit them.  \"Three strikes and out!\" called the umpire.  The crowd cheered.  On went the game.  \"Who's pitching?\" asked one man of another.  Nobody knew.  \"Carmachel says his name is Strong,\" some one at last informed the workmen.  \"Hurrah for little Strong!\" yelled a big Swede.  \"Three cheers for the Little Giant!\" piped a shrill voice.  On every hand the cry was taken up.  \"Three cheers for the Little Giant!\"  Then suddenly the one o'clock whistle sounded. Peter came back to the realities of life. He dropped his gloves. Already, as if the earth had opened, players and audience had vanished. In through the waiting doors of the tanneries filed the men. But Peter Coddington had won a place for himself, and with it a new name. Henceforth throughout the works he was known as \"The Little Giant.\"     [Illustration]  CHAPTER III  A NEW FRIEND   For a week Peter worked patiently cutting ropes from freshly received shipments of skins, trimming the skins, and learning to sort them. Every night he went home exhausted after his day's work. Sometimes it was hard to realize that he was the same boy who, but a short time before, had jauntily sauntered out to play tennis every evening with his classmates. He couldn't have played tennis now had he tried, and he was not sorry when the rumor reached him that it was commonly reported at the high school that he had been sent away to a distant military academy. So that was the reason why the fellows had not hunted him up! Perhaps it was just as well. It saved many embarrassing questions, and he was much too worn out when night came to do anything but fall into his bed. Still he did not complain of his fatigue. He was too proud to do that. Moreover had he not brought the entire situation upon himself? He would swallow his medicine in silence.  But he knew from his mother's troubled questions; from her unusual care that his luncheon be tempting and nourishing; from the solicitous gaze she fixed on him that the present ordeal worried her not a little. Once he overheard her say to his father: \"The boy isn't strong enough to stand it! He will be ill.\"  \"Don't have any anxiety about Peter,\" was the retort. \"The young scoundrel finds energy enough, I hear, to play ball with the men every noon time. He is the star pitcher of Factory 1.\" A chuckle came from the older man. \"It is something of a joke, too,\" he continued, \"for I thought I had put him beyond all possible range of a bat and ball. Don't fret any more about him. Let him alone. He is showing more pluck than I dreamed he possessed.\"  \"But suppose he should overdo.\"  \"He won't overdo.\"  And the prediction was true. Tired as he was every night Peter awoke in the morning entirely refreshed. The lameness of back and muscles soon wore away. At the end of the week, when he received his first pay envelope, no boy in the wide world ever felt as rich as he. Six dollars! Six dollars of his very own! To be sure his father had often given him twice that amount; but receiving it as a present was a vastly different matter from earning it.  \"I mean to save up for a motorcycle,\" Peter declared. \"Then I could ride to the tannery every day.\"  \"So you could,\" agreed Mr. Coddington. \"It is not a bad idea. Don't forget, though, that you will be needing clothes now and then. You spoke last night of wanting some flannel shirts to wear to work.\"  \"Yes, but you----\"  Mr. Coddington shook his head.  \"I have bought your clothes up to this time,\" he answered, \"but now that you have a salary of your own it is time you relieved me of that expense.\"  \"Oh--of--of--course,\" Peter stammered. \"I guess, though, I can get the motorcycle and pay for my clothes, too, without any trouble. How much do clothes cost?\"  \"Let me see!\" Mr. Coddington took out a small expense book and turned its pages rapidly. \"Clothing for Peter. Here it is. Last year I spent for you $638.\"  \"For me! For my clothes?\" gasped the boy. \"Did I spend $638? Why, I had no idea of it! I could have gone without some of those overcoats and things as well as not if I had known they cost so much. That's an awful lot for a boy to spend, isn't it?\"  \"It's a plenty.\"  \"Why, it's more than I will earn in a whole year.\"  \"Yes, I am afraid it is--at least, for the present.\"  Peter was thoughtful.  \"I can see that it's good-bye to the motorcycle,\" he said at last, disappointment in every feature.  With an impulsive gesture Mr. Coddington thrust his hand into the breast pocket where his check-book lay; then resolutely took out the hand and put it behind him.  \"There seems to be no way but for you to do without a motorcycle for a while, son,\" he replied. \"Do not be discouraged, though. You are now pretty well stocked with the necessary clothing and in consequence will not require many new things for some time. If you are not too proud to wear your old suits to work you can easily put aside some money each week.\"  \"I do not care how old and shabby my clothes are,\" smiled Peter. \"It does not make much difference what I wear to the tannery if I can just have some flannel shirts, overalls, and rubber boots. I've packed away my white tennis suits in moth-balls, you know, since I went into the mill.\"  They both laughed.  As flannel shirts and overalls were inexpensive and easily obtained, and as Peter already had rubber boots it was possible to begin the saving for the motorcycle without further delay.  In the meantime orders came that Strong was to leave his task of trimming skins and present himself at the beamhouse. Reluctantly he bade farewell to Carmachel and the other men--his first friends at the tannery--and on the following Monday morning he made his way into the long, low room where he had been told the skins were tanned. The room was a revelation, and a none too pleasant one at that! If he had thought the unloading and sorting department unsavory what should he say of this? The floor of the beamhouse was slippery with water, lime, and tanning solutions; unpleasant fumes of wet skins made heavy the air; revolving paddle-wheels suspended from the ceiling dripped upon the passer-by; and men, dragging saturated skins from vats in the floor, piled them in heaps where the water oozing from them trickled out into the general sloppiness and transformed the floor into a great shallow pool of moisture. Back and forth through this wetness moved workmen who, as they wheeled barrows of freshly tanned skins, left a wake of slime behind them. Peter looked about in consternation. The steaming odor of the room was nauseating and filled him with disgust. Could he stand it? And they called this a promotion! What wonder that Carmachel had chuckled when asked what the beamhouse was!  As Peter stood hesitating, a prey to these confused impressions, a lad about his own age touched him on the shoulder.  \"Bryant, the foreman, wants to speak to you,\" he said.  Peter roused himself and followed the boy.  In a corner of the room the foreman greeted him.  \"How are you, Strong?\" he began. \"You see you are no stranger to me, for I have watched you play ball at noon time. I am glad we are to have you in our department.\"  \"Thank you, sir. Yes, Mr. Tyler said I was to report here for the present.\"  \"That's good. We can put you to work, all right. Before you begin, however, I should like to have you look about and get an idea what we do in here. A man always enjoys his work better and does it more intelligently, I contend, if he has some notion of the process in which he is to have a share. Jackson is about your age and has been in this room a long time.\" (He indicated the boy at Peter's elbow.) \"Suppose he takes you around and shows you what happens to the skins after they are sent in here to us.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  Jackson seemed pleased at the task assigned him.  \"I'm glad you are coming into the beamhouse to work, Strong,\" he ventured timidly. \"There are not many boys here my age. You won't like it at first, I'm afraid, but you will soon get used to it.\"  \"I don't believe I shall like it at all,\" was Peter's rueful reply. \"It's an awful place, isn't it?\"  \"Oh, it's not so bad as it seems. You won't mind it--really you won't. Of course the smell is disagreeable and it is wet and sloppy, too; but Bryant, the foreman, is a mighty white fellow and the men, although mostly foreigners, are pleasant enough. I myself was so thankful to get any work that I did not much care what it was.\"  \"Have you been here long?\" questioned Peter.  \"Ever since I was old enough to go to work--a year this August.\"  \"And you've been in this room all that time!\"  \"Yes. It takes quite a while to get a promotion here at the tannery. My pay has been raised to nine dollars, though. Maybe I wasn't glad to get the money! You see, I support my mother.\" Jackson threw back his head proudly.  \"You? You support yourself and your mother?\" repeated Peter incredulously.  \"Sure I do! Why not?\"  \"But you--why, you are not much older than I am!\"  \"I'm sixteen. Mother and I get on very well on what I earn, even though it isn't much. Don't you have anybody to take care of?\"  \"No.\"  Jackson regarded Peter with astonishment.  \"I should think you would be rich as a lord if you have all your money to yourself!\" he exclaimed. \"What on earth do you find to do with it?\"  Once--and the time was not far passed, either--Peter would have laughed at the naive question; now he answered gravely:  \"Oh, I am saving some of it.\"  \"That's right. I can't save a cent at present, but some time I hope to get a better salary and then I shall be able to. Now let's go over to the other end of the room and see where they are putting the skins to soak in those big vats of water to get out the salt and dirt. That's the first thing they do after the skins are sent into the beamhouse. You remember how stiff and hard the dry skins were when you unloaded them."]]]
