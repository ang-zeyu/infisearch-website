LTD., 4 STATIONERS' HALL COURT : : LONDON, E.C.   _Copyright_ _First published April 1917_   TO  R.V.K.C.  AND MY OTHER FRIENDS  IN THE REGIMENT     APOLOGIA   There has been so much written about the trenches, there are so many war photographs, so many cinema films, that one might well hesitate before even mentioning the war--to try to write a book about it is, I fear, to incur the censure of the many who are tired of hearing about bombs and bullets, and who prefer to read of peace, and games, and flirtations.  But, for that very reason, I venture to think that even so indifferent a war book as mine will not come entirely amiss. When the Lean Years are over, when the rifle becomes rusty, and the khaki is pushed away in some remote cupboard, there is great danger that the hardships of the men in the trenches will too soon be forgotten. If, to a minute extent, anything in these pages should help to bring home to people what war really is, and to remind them of their debt of gratitude, then these little sketches will have justified their existence.  Besides, I am not entirely responsible for this little book. Not long ago, I met a man--fit, single, and young--who began to grumble to me of the hardships of his \"funkhole\" in England, and, incidentally, to belittle the hardships of the man at the front. After I had told him exactly what I thought of him, I was still so indignant that I came home and began to write a book about the trenches. Hence _Mud and Khaki_. To him, then, the blame for this minor horror of war. I wash my hands of it.  And I try to push the blame off on to him, for I realise that I have undertaken an impossible task--the most practised pen cannot convey a real notion of the life at the front, as the words to describe war do not exist. Even you who have lost your husbands and brothers, your fathers and sons, can have but the vaguest impression of the cruel, thirsty claws that claimed them as victims. First must you see the shattered cottages of France and Belgium, the way in which the women clung to their homes in burning Ypres, the long streams of refugees wheeling their poor little _lares et penates_, their meagre treasures, on trucks and handcarts; first must you listen to the cheery joke that the Angel of Death finds on the lips of the soldier, to the songs that encourage you in the dogged marches through the dark and the mud, to the talk during the long nights when the men collect round the brazier fire and think of their wives and kiddies at home, of murky streets in the East End, of quiet country inns where the farmers gather of an evening.  No words, then, can give an exact picture of these things, but they may help to give colour to your impressions. Heaven forbid that, by telling the horrors of war, the writers of books should make pessimists of those at home! Heaven forbid that they should belittle the dangers and hardships, and so take away some of the glory due to \"Tommy\" for all he has suffered for the Motherland! There is a happy mean--the men at the front have found it; they know that death is near, but they can still laugh and sing.  In these sketches and stories I have tried, with but little success, to keep that happy mean in view. If the pictures are very feeble in design when compared to the many other, and far better, works on the same subject, remember, reader, that the intention is good, and accept this apology for wasting your time.  A few of these sketches and articles have already appeared elsewhere. My best thanks are due to the Editors of the _Daily Mail_ and the _Daily Mirror_ for their kind permission to include several sketches which appeared, in condensed forms, in their papers. I am also grateful to the Editor of Cassell's _Storyteller_ for his permission to reproduce \"The Knut,\" which first saw print in that periodical.  VERNON BARTLETT.

THE CLEARING HOUSE                    178     MUD AND KHAKI     I  IN HOSPITAL   Close behind the trenches on the Ypres salient stands part of \"Chapel Farm\"--the rest of it has long been trampled down into the mud by the many hundreds of men who have passed by there. Enough of the ruin still stands for you to trace out the original plan of the place--a house and two barns running round three sides of the farmyard that is foetid and foul and horrible.  It is an uninviting spot, for, close by, are the remains of a dead cow, superficially buried long ago by some working party that was in a hurry to get home; but the farm is notable for the fact that passing round the north side of the building you are out of view, and safe, and that passing round the south side you can be seen by the enemy, and are certain to be sniped.  If you must be sniped, however, you might choose a worse place, for the bullets generally fly low there, and there is a cellar to which you can be carried--a filthy spot, abounding in rats, and damp straw, and stained rags, for the place once acted as a dressing-station. But still, it is under cover, and intact, with six little steps leading up into the farmyard.  And one day, as I led a party of men down to the \"dumping ground\" to fetch ammunition, I was astonished to hear the familiar strains of \"Gilbert the Filbert\" coming from this desolate ruin. The singer had a fine voice, and he gave forth his chant as happily as though he were safe at home in England, with no cares or troubles in the world. With a sergeant, I set out to explore; as our boots clattered on the cobble-stones of the farmyard, there was a noise in the cellar, a head poked up in the entrance, and I was greeted with a cheery \"Good morning, sir.\"  We crawled down the steps into the hovel to learn the singer's story. He was a man from another regiment, who had come down from his support dug-out to \"nose around after a spud or two.\" The German sniper had \"bagged\" him in the ankle and he had crawled into the cellar--still with his sandbag of \"spuds\"--to wait until someone came by. \"I 'adn't got nothing to do but wait,\" he concluded, \"and if I'd got to wait, I might jest as well play at bein' a bloomin' canary as 'owl like a kid what's 'ad it put acrost 'im.\"  We got a little water from the creaky old pump and took off his \"first field dressing\" that he had wound anyhow round his leg. To my surprise--for he was so cheerful that I thought he had only a scratch--I found that his ankle was badly smashed, and that part of his boot and sock had been driven right into the wound.  \"Yes, it did 'urt a bit when I tried to walk,\" he said, as I expressed surprise. \"That's jest the best part of it. I don't care if it 'urts like 'ell, for it's sure to mean 'Blighty' and comfort for me.\"  And that is just the spirit of the hospitals--the joy of comfort and rest overbalances the pain and the operation. To think that there are still people who imagine that hospitals are of necessity sad and depressing! Why, even the children's wards of the London Hospital are not that, for, as you look down the rows of beds, you see surprise and happiness on the poor little pinched faces--surprise that everything is clean and white, and that they are lying between proper sheets; happiness that they are treated kindly, and that there are no harsh words. As for a military hospital, while war lays waste the world, there is no place where there is more peace and contentment.  Hospital, for example, is the happiest place to spend Christmas. About a week before the day there are mysterious whispers in the corners, and furtive writing in a notebook, and the clinking of coppers. Then, next day, a cart comes to the door and deposits a load of ivy and holly and mistletoe. The men have all subscribed to buy decorations for their temporary home, and they set about their work like children--for where will you find children who are younger than the \"Tommies\"? Even the wards where there are only \"cot cases\" are decorated, and the men lie in bed and watch the invaders from other wards who come in and smother the place with evergreens. There is one ward where a man lies dying of cancer--here, too, they come, making clumsy attempts to walk on tip-toe, and smiling encouragement as they hang the mistletoe from the electric light over his bed.  And at last the great day comes. There are presents for everyone, and a bran pie from which, one by one, they extract mysterious parcels wrapped up in brown paper. And the joy as they undo them! There are table games and packets of tobacco, writing pads and boxes of cigarettes,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25470"],["title","Mud and Khaki: Sketches from Flanders and France (#1)"],["body"," fountain pens which will nearly turn the Matron's hair grey, and bags of chocolates. They collect in their wards and turn their presents over, their eyes damp with joy; they pack up their games or their chocolate to send home to their wives who are spending Christmas in lonely cottage kitchens; they write letters to imaginary people just for the joy of using their writing blocks; they admire each others' treasures, and, sometimes, make exchanges, for the man who does not smoke has drawn a pipe, and the man in the corner over there, who has lost both legs, has drawn a pair of felt slippers!  Before they know where they are, the lunch is ready, and, children again, they eat far more than is good for them, until the nurses have to forbid them to have any more. \"No, Jones,\" they say, \"you can't have a third helping of pudding; you're supposed to be on a milk diet.\"  Oh, the happiness of it all! All day they sing and eat and talk, until you forget that there is war and misery in the world; when the evening comes they go, flushed and happy, back to their beds to dream that great black Germans are sitting on them, eating Christmas puddings by the dozen, and growing heavier with each one.  But upstairs in the little ward the mother sits with her son, and she tries with all her force to keep back the tears. They have had the door open all day to hear the laughter and fun, and on the table by the bed lie his presents and the choicest fruit and sweets. Until quite late at night she stays there, holding her son's hand, and telling of Christmases when he was a little boy. Then, when she gets up to go, the man in bed turns his head towards the poor little pile of presents. \"You'd better take those, mother,\" he says. \"They won't be much use to me. But it's the happiest Christmas I've ever had.\" And all the poor woman's courage leaves her, and she stoops forward under the mistletoe and kisses him, kisses him, with tears streaming down her face.         *       *       *       *       *  Most stirring of all are the clearing hospitals near the firing line. They are crowded, and all night long fresh wounded stumble in, the mud caked on their uniforms, and their bandages soiled by dark stains. In one corner a man groans unceasingly: \"Oh, my head ... God! Oh, my poor head!\" and you hear the mutterings and laughter of the delirious.  But if the pain here is at its height, the relief is keenest. For months they have lived in hell, these men, and now they have been brought out of it all. A man who has been rescued from suffocation in a coal mine does not grumble if he has the toothache; a man who has come from the trenches and death does not complain of the agony of his wound--he smiles because he is in comfortable surroundings for once.  Besides, there is a great feeling of expectation and hope, for there is to be a convoy in the morning and they are all to be sent down to the base--all except the men who are too ill to be moved and the two men who have died in the night, whose beds are shut off by red screens. The \"cot cases\" are lifted carefully on to stretchers, their belongings are packed under their pillows, and they are carried down to the ambulances, while the walking cases wander about the wards, waiting for their turn to come. They look into their packs for the fiftieth time to make sure they have left nothing; they lean out of the windows to watch the ambulance roll away to the station; they stop every orderly who comes along to ask if they have not been forgotten, or if there will be room for them on the train; they make new acquaintances, or discover old ones. One man meets a long-lost friend with a huge white bandage round his neck. \"Hullo, you poor devil,\" he says, \"how did you get it in the neck like that? was it a bullet or a bit of a shell?\" The other swears, and confesses that he has not been hit at all, but is suffering from boils.  For, going down to the base are wounded and sick of every sort--men who have lost a limb, and men who have only the tiniest graze; men who are mad with pain, and men who are going down for a new set of false teeth; men with pneumonia, and men with scabies. It is only when the boat leaves for England that the cases can be sorted out. It is only then that there are signs of envy, and the men whose wounds are not bad enough to take them back to \"Blighty\" curse because the bullet did not go deeper, or the bit of shrapnel did not touch the bone.         *       *       *       *       *  It is a wonderful moment for the \"Tommies\" when they reach their convalescent hospital in England. Less than a week ago many of them were stamping up and down in a slushy trench wondering \"why the 'ell there's a bloomin' war on at all.\" Less than a week ago many of them never thought to see England again, and now they are being driven up to the old Elizabethan mansion that is to be their hospital.  As the ambulance draws up outside the porch, the men can see, where the hostess used to welcome her guests of old, the matron waiting with the medical officer to welcome them in. One by one they are brought into the oak-panelled hall, and a nurse stoops over them to read their names, regiments, and complaints off the little labels that are fastened to their tunic buttons. As they await their turns, they snuff the air and sigh happily, they talk, and wink, and smile at the great carved ceiling, and forget all they have gone through in the joy of that splendid moment.  Away in one of the wards a gramophone is playing \"Mother Machree,\" and the little nurse, who hums the tune to herself as she leans over each man to see his label, sees a tear crawling through the grey stubble on one's cheek. He is old and Irish, and had not hoped to hear Irish tunes and to see fair women again. But he is ashamed of his emotion, and he tells a little lie. \"Sure, an' it's rainin' outside, nurse,\" he says.  And the nurse, who knows the difference between a raindrop and a tear--for was she not standing on the step five minutes ago, admiring the stars and the moon?--knows her part well, and plays it. \"I thought I heard the rain dripping down on the porch just now,\" she says, \"I hope you poor men did not get wet,\" and she goes on to her next patient.         *       *       *       *       *  How they love those days in hospital! How the great rough men love to be treated like babies, to be petted and scolded, ordered about and praised! How grand it is to see the flowers, to feel one's strength returning, to go for drives and walks, to find a field that is not pitted by shell holes! And how cheerful they all are, these grown-up babies!  The other day I opened the door of the hospital and discovered a \"convoy\" consisting of three legless and two armless men, trying to help each other up the six low steps, and shouting with laughter at their efforts. And one of them saw the pity on my face, for he grinned.  \"Don't you worry about us,\" he said. \"I wouldn't care if I 'ad no arms nor eyes nor legs, so long as I was 'ome in Blighty again. Why\"--and his voice dropped as he let me into the secret--\"I've 'ad a li'l boy born since I went out to the front, an' I never even seed the li'l beggar yet. Gawd, we in 'orspital is the lucky ones, an' any bloke what ain't killed ought to be 'appy and bright like what we is.\"  And it is the happiness of all these men that makes hospital a very beautiful place, for nowhere can you find more courage and cheerfulness than among these fellows with their crutches and their bandages.  There was only one man--Bill Stevens--who seemed despondent and miserable, and we scarcely wondered--he was blind, and lay in bed day after day, with a bandage round his head, the only blind man in the hospital. He was silent and morbid, and would scarcely mutter a word of thanks when some man came right across the ward on his crutches to do him a trifling service, but he had begged to be allowed to stay in the big ward until the time came for him to go off to a special hostel for the men who have lost their sight. And the men who saw him groping about helplessly in broad daylight forgave him his surliness, and ceased to wonder at his despondency.  But even Bill Stevens was to change, for there came a day when he received a letter.  \"What's the postmark?\" he demanded.  \"Oxford,\" said the nurse. \"Shall I read it to you?\"  But Bill Stevens clutched his letter tight and shook his head, and it was not until lunch-time that anything more was heard of it. Then he called the Sister to him, and she read the precious document almost in a whisper, so secret was it. Private Bill Stevens plucked nervously at the bedclothes as the Sister recited the little love sentences:--How was dear Bill? Why hadn't he told his Emily what was wrong with him? That she, Emily, would come to see him at four o'clock that afternoon, and how nice it would be.  \"Now you keep quiet and don't worry,\" said the Sister, \"or you'll be too ill to see her. Why, I declare that you're quite feverish. What have you got to worry about?\"  \"You see, it's like this 'ere,\" confided Bill Stevens. \"I ain't dared to tell 'er as 'ow I was blind, and it ain't fair to ask 'er to marry a bloke what's 'elpless. She only thinks I've got it slightly, and she won't care for me any more now.\"  \"You needn't be frightened,\" said the Sister. \"If she's worth anything at all, she'll love you all the more now.\" And she tucked him up and told him to go to sleep.  Then, when Emily arrived, the Sister met her, and broke the news. \"You love him, don't you?\" she asked, and Emily blushed, and smiled assent through her tears.  \"Then,\" said the Sister, \"do your best to cheer him up. Don't let him think you're distressed at his blindness,\" and she took the girl along to the ward where Bill Stevens lay waiting, restless and feverish.  \"Bill darling,\" said Emily. \"It's me. How are you? Why have you got that bandage on?\" But long before poor Bill could find words to break the news to her she stooped over him"]]]
