She might be too nervous, and I guess she and Jennie had a fine time planting their lettuce after the shower,\" said Grace quietly.  \"Oh, did you get caught in the shower?\" anxiously asked Madaline with trowel in hand, and beautifully decked out in one of Mrs. Dunbar's artist's smocks, somewhat bedaubed with paint.  \"We were alarmed.  The lightning struck a tree over in the orchard.\"  \"But it couldn't strike us, for we were buried in a beautiful cave, and if we had only known what a perfectly fine little bandit hang-out we were going to discover, we would have brought our hike packs along. Sorry you missed it all, Madie,\" said Cleo affectionately.  \"But we had a visitor,\" announced Madaline.  \"He came just after you left, and he asked so many questions, Jennie sent me out with an excuse to get Michael.  He said he was looking for a place to board, but we knew better.  He was looking for information,\" she declared.  \"We transplanted a whole bed of tomatoes though.  Don't I bear evidence of the applied arts in my smock and with the aroma of the green vines proclaiming me--the man with the rake?\" she finished grandly.  \"A lovely little speech, Madaline.  You are a very artistic farmer,\" Cleo complimented.  \"And I hope your tomatoes tomate beautifully.  But tell us about your visitor?\"  \"Oh, he wore a yellow duster, like an automobile coat and----\"  \"That's the man we saw!\" Grace interrupted, forgetting in her excitement the plan of keeping their adventure from Madaline.  \"Yes, he went toward Second Mountain,\" continued Madaline, unsuspiciously, \"and Jennie told Michael to be sure and let Shep loose, so he would know we had a big dog around.  Jennie doesn't like Shep to run through her garden, of course, but she said it would be a good thing to have that man know we were guarded.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Cleo, exchanging glances with Grace.  \"It's a good thing to have a dog in a big forest like this.  Aunt Audrey home?\"  \"Nope,\" replied Madaline.  \"Come on, let's dress, Jennie promised to go to the Lake with us after dinner.\"  \"Oh, goody, goody,\" exclaimed Cleo.  \"Come on, Grace.  I feel like an escaped eel in these togs.  We had a good time in our old scout uniforms, didn't we?  Nothing like it in a good drenching downpour,\" and she spread out her khaki skirt at each hip in imitation pannier effect, although the effect was rather slippery, to say the least.  It was while Madaline was washing, Cleo and Grace made opportunity to exchange opinions on the strange visitor.  \"Do you suppose he is following us?\" asked Grace.  \"If so, don't you think we had better tell Jennie?\"  \"I shouldn't like to,\" demurred Cleo, \"because you know that would surely put the kibosh on our hikes.  If Aunt Audrey were home I feel certain she would allow us our liberty, conditionally, of course. Pshaw!  I wish the horrid man had kept away.  Isn't it mean!\"  Madaline appeared, rosy and shining, from the lavatory; evidently her gardening experience had been both enjoyable and profitable.  Garbed in pretty dainty frocks, and carrying gorgeously brilliant sweaters, the trio, with Jennie as chaperon, raced off to the lake directly after dinner.  The evening was delightfully clear and cool after the shower, and the promise of a row out through the willow-bound water was sufficient lure to banish from their minds all thoughts of the suspicious man and the threatening old woman.  A group of boys down on the little pavilion was found to include Andy and Mally Mack, as well as Jack Hagan, and very generously they offered to give the girls a boat ride.  \"Anything from a tug to a canoe!\" proffered Andy, \"and you may row, sail or paddle.\"  \"That's lovely,\" acknowledged Cleo, \"but we promised to take a big flat boat so Jennie may come this time,\" she smiled gratefully.  \"We would love a canoe ride, some evening when Aunt Audrey is home.\"  Doing the next best thing to taking part in the sail, that of providing the big flat bottom boat for the party, the boys promptly rowed up to the clear end of the float and assisted Jennie to embark.  Of course the girls hopped in, disdaining so much as the kind hand Andy offered them, and with a united push they were sent out into the pool, that now in sunset looked like \"a rummage sail [Transcriber's note: sale?] in a paint shop,\" as Grace described the brilliantly lighted waters.  Regretful glances were sent after that \"big flat bottom boat,\" but women like Jennie had to be humored, and even good natured boys realized this.  Grace and Cleo rowed up the stream.  Many pleasure craft were afloat, and the visitors already knew a number of Bellaire girls and boys who called pleasant greetings.  The lake, wide at the basin, narrowed off into a tiny stream as it followed the course, tracing its origin in the mountain springs. Willows thick as a tasseled hedge hid the banks, and teased the boat as the girls ducked and dipped their way, determined to go to the end, or till they touched bottom.  \"It will be almost dark in that dense thicket,\" Jennie warned them, \"and you know we are a good mile from nowhere.\"  \"Oh, just a little farther,\" begged Cleo; \"we want to say we went to the very end.\"  \"Very well,\" agreed Jennie, who was plainly enjoying the delightful sail in the colorful twilight.  \"Look!\" exclaimed Grace suddenly.  \"There's someone in wading!  Oh! see, it's our little Mary.\"  \"Sure enough,\" followed Cleo.  \"How can she be away down here so late? Let's call.\"  \"No, wait till we are a little nearer,\" suggested Grace, thinking quickly, a call meant for Mary might also be heard by someone else. \"We can row almost up to her.\"  Pulling their oars with a firm stroke it took but a few minutes to come within speaking distance of the girl, who now, seeing the approaching boat, was standing knee deep in a golden path of water.  \"Who is she?\" asked Jennie, gazing intently at the odd figure, for as ever Mary wore white, and her heavy braids fell into the big pocket made of her up-turned skirt.  She looked like some elfin sprite painted in pastels, with all the soft greens of foliage, and the wonderfully mellow tints of crimsoned gold shed from the sunset, surrounding the picture and forming an inimitable background.  \"Oh, that's our little friend Mary,\" Cleo replied to Jennie's question. \"She's lovely, and Aunt Audrey knows about her.\"  This last of course was said to assure Jennie of the propriety of her charges making friends with the girl in wading.  \"Mary!  Mary!\" called Grace.  \"Come on for a sail!  We have room!\"  It was typical of Grace to do a thing like that--to call out the invitation without consulting anyone, or considering possible consequences.  \"Hello, girls!\" came back Mary's response.  \"I'd love to go--if----\"  As Cleo at least expected, there was someone in the background watching Mary, but the assurance in Mary's voice, that of a new note of courage, further emboldened Cleo.  \"Oh come on, Mary,\" she urged.  \"We will just row you around here if you like.  Jump in!\" Cleo insisted, while Mary, now clinging to the side of the boat with one hand, depended on the other to keep her light skirts clear of the water.  \"Oh, I am so glad you came,\" she said.  \"I did not know just what to do.  I thought I might see some of the boys who would help me.  Is this your mother?\"  She stopped suddenly, and stared at the astonished Jennie.  \"No, this is Jennie, our friend, our manager,\" Cleo replied kindly. \"But she is just as safe as a mother; you need not fear to speak before her.  How can we help you?\"  \"Janos came to-day,\" Mary almost whispered, \"and I am so afraid of him now.  He knows I have friends.  He saw you in the cave, but I did not know you were there during the storm.\"  She was speaking quickly, fearfully, in fact, and had no chance to observe the changes working through Jennie's quizzical expression.  \"And he knows where you live----\"  \"Was it he who came to our house this afternoon?\" asked Madaline. \"Does he wear an auto duster?\"  \"Yes, that is Janos.  And now he wants to get us all away again.  O dear! poor granddaddy!  I know he is sick, but he thinks he is all right,\" and the child almost sobbed in her helplessness.  \"But is someone watching you now?  Is Reda over there?\" asked Cleo, indicating the willow banks.  \"No, I ran down and said I was going to find my basket I left somewhere before the storm.  But they surely will come soon.\"  \"If you are afraid, child,\" spoke up Jennie, \"just you come along with us.  We can get a car in the village and I will take you home myself.\"  Four pair of grateful eyes sent their thanks to Jennie.  Mary touched her hand as it rested on the side of the boat.  \"Oh, that is so good of you.  But--Janos and Reda are not like Americans, they are from the tropics, you know, and different.  Oh, we are so miserable and unhappy!\"  Tears now glistened in the heavy lashes that fringed her dark eyes, and no one seemed to know just what to say next.  Cleo was first to recover herself.  \"If you could possibly come with us to the landing we might make some excuse for picking you up, and Jennie could go home with you.  We might all go.  I'll tell you!\" a sudden inspiration breaking in on the difficult situation.  \"Jump in.  We will row back as quickly as we can and send the boys over to Bailey's for a big car.  Then we will all drive up the mountain with you.  We will have the man for protection, and if your old Reda is not good-natured we will not let you stay there to-night.  Would your grandfather care?  Might he allow you to spend a night with us?\"  All the hidden and suppressed hopes in that strangely veiled countenance seemed to burst through now, and Mary's expression, from one of almost impenetrable gloom, assumed a strange light--perhaps borrowed from the sunset.  \"Oh, it is too good to be true!\" she sighed.  \"Someone at last is not afraid to help me!\"     CHAPTER IX  THE SECRET SPRING  That settled it.  Before Mary realized "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25626"],["title","The Girl Scouts at Bellaire; Or, Maid Mary's Awakening (#8)"],["body","position she was sitting securely in the broad seat at the stern of the gliding boat, with Madaline's arm around her, while her delighted fingers trailed through the water, and her almost frightened gaze was fastened on Jennie's face.  \"You are a real woman,\" she surprised her friends by declaring.  \"Do you know I have not seen anyone like you to talk to since Loved One went away.  She was my mother,\" the child said solemnly.  \"When did she die?\" Jennie ventured.  \"When I was eleven.  I am thirteen now.\"  \"And where did you live then?\" pressed Cleo, feeling the time was opportune for obtaining something of Mary's history.  \"Oh, very, very far away, on an island off Central America,\" came the surprising answer.  \"Do your relatives live there?\" inquired Grace, gently.  \"No, they all died with the fever, that is, Loved One did, and daddy was lost at sea.  Reda thinks I had it, and she says I must not do things like other girls or it will come back and kill me, but I don't believe her now.  Since I have known you girls I feel so much stronger and wiser,\" she finished quaintly, with a significant toss of her head.  \"The idea of telling you you were sick, and scaring you into it,\" indignantly spoke Jennie, in whom an instant dislike for the sinister Reda had taken root.  \"A good way to make a child sick, I should say. But what right has she over you?  Is she a relative?\"  \"A relative?\" and Mary almost laughed.  \"No, indeed.  Nothing but an old nurse, and not my real nurse either.  You see, when granddaddy--as I call him--had to leave the tropics, we had to take the first steamer to get away, and I had no one to care for me after Loved One went, so we just had to accept Reda.  Then Janos is her brother, I guess, or some sort of relative, and I could get along with her if he would stay away.  I can't tell you the whole story, for it is granddaddy's secret, and I have promised him I would never, never tell anyone why we are up here in the mountains, and why I can't use my own name!\"  Again that veil dropped over the soft dark eyes.  No one felt like speaking then, for they noticed the girl swallowing hard to choke back the sorrow that threatened to overcome her.  \"Well, here we are almost in.\"  It was Jennie who broke the silence, as the boat, now out in the broad open lake, became one of the many turning in at nightfall.  \"And there are the boys waiting to land us. You don't suppose, Mary, that old woman will make trouble for you?\" This with a show of anxiety at the rather difficult position the party now found themselves in.  \"No, I am not a bit alarmed.  They may think I have got lost, or I might have fallen in the water.  Perhaps she and Janos would be glad if I never came back.  Then they would have granddaddy all to themselves, and I suppose they would torture him to find out his secret.  Oh! dear!\" she sighed, \"if it were not for him I believe I would just run away.\"  \"You must never think of that,\" Jennie counseled, \"unless of course those foreigners torment you.  Cleo, you tell Andy to charge the car to your uncle, Mr. Dunbar, and be sure to say we are in a hurry.\"  Arrangements were made so promptly Mary was almost bewildered.  Another wonder had suddenly come into the life of the timid little girl.  She was actually riding in an automobile.  How magical is the power of true friends!  \"It's just like my dream,\" she said naïvely.  \"I dreamed last night I had a ride in an airship, and I haven't been in an automobile since we came to Bellaire.\"  \"When was that?\" asked Madaline, who kept very close to Mary as if considering the stranger her own especial charge.  \"About four months ago--in winter,\" Mary replied.  \"First we stopped in a city, then Janos brought us out here.\"  Cleo wanted to ask why Mary always gathered flowers and roots, but conscious that many personal questions were more necessary than these, she felt those less important must wait for another time.  \"Oh, see!\" suddenly exclaimed Mary.  \"There go Janos and Reda looking for me!  Now we can all go in and be talking to granddaddy when they come back.  Isn't that fortunate!\"  Everyone thought so, for, in spite of all their scout courage, the girls were not especially anxious to run headlong into the arms of two foreigners, who would undoubtedly be angry.  The prospect of meeting a benevolent old grandfather was much more comfortable to speculate upon.  \"Turn in here,\" Mary told the driver, and her friends noticed a certain dignity in her command, usually found only among those accustomed to give orders.  \"There's grandie,\" she called.  \"See, he is coming to meet us.  Drive slowly, he is not strong on his limbs.\"  The man they approached was not old, but very tall, stooped and distinguished looking.  As the car drew up he threw back his shoulders and stood like some figure posed in defiance.  \"Granddaddy, here I am!\" called Mary, attempting to climb out; \"were you frightened about me?\"  \"Mary!  Mary!\" he exclaimed.  \"What does it mean?\" and each word sounded like a low moan.  Plainly he was trying to figure out what had happened that the child should return with strangers.  Likely he had feared an accident.  \"It only means, Grandie, that we have friends, and you are not to refuse them.  Let us hurry in before Reda returns.  Can your man wait?\" she asked Jennie.  \"Not very long, I'm afraid,\" Jennie replied.  \"We too have folks who may be anxious about us.  But we will be glad to meet your grandfather.\"  How the girls blessed her for this!  \"Call him professor.  Everyone does,\" Mary managed to say as they alighted.  \"Come in, welcome!\" announced the man, turning to the foot path that outlined the drive leading to the house.  It was a queer party that left the auto and silently followed Mary and the professor up to the artistic cottage, that stood almost hidden in tall, heavy chestnut trees.  In spite of the general loss of this sort of tree, those sheltering the terra cottage bungalow were especially healthy and majestic, as could be seen even in the fast descending nightfall.  Mary rushed on ahead and touched the electric light button inside the door, then she threw open the portal, quite like an experienced little hostess.  \"This is the Imlay studio,\" remarked Jennie, who was the only one in the party familiar with Bellaire.  \"I thought it was closed when he died so suddenly.\"  \"Did he die here?\" asked the man Mary called Grandie, a note of alarm in his voice.  \"Oh no, he was abroad and did not return,\" replied Jennie.  It was evident this information brought relief to the questioner, for under the light that shone from the spray of brass lanterns his face perceptibly softened.  Somehow all the mysterious influence which had seemed to surround Mary at their first meeting with her was now oppressively noticeable within that house.  It was scantily furnished with what remained of artist Imlay's belongings, but the air of suspicion usually associated with old, abandoned places seemed to fairly seethe through the air.  Even Jennie felt it, and to the scout girls, more vividly conscious always of any antagonism, the surroundings were actually uncanny.  \"Won't you sit down?\" said Mary, observing the almost rigid attitude of her callers.  But each politely declined to share the seat offered on the handsome low divan.  Grace noticed its carvings looked rather ferocious, while Madaline clung to Jennie, without any pretense of apology.  Cleo was now peering at something behind the stained glass door that separated the long living room from that adjoining.  It was not exactly a light, yet it passed back and forth and threw weird shadows through the glass.  She was wondering if the people kept any other servant than Reda, who was surely not in the house at the time.  Scuffling about aimlessly, the professor suddenly dropped wearily into a big oaken chair, and as Mary turned toward him she too caught sight of the shadows now flickering through the leaded glass, with sinister effect and creepy significance.  It might be the shaded glow of a small flash light.  \"Grandie!\" Mary gasped.  \"Who are they?  Did Janos bring--anyone?  Oh, don't move!  It may be a trap!\"  \"Mary, Mary!\" he moaned, \"must I leave you!\" and choking sobs shook the man so convulsively that Jennie dashed across the room and put her hand on the trembling form.  \"Sir!\" she spoke almost in a whisper.  \"You must not fear any harm from those wild people.  We know they are trying to injure you, but the little girls have found a way to help.  We have a man and a car at the door,\" she said close to his ear.  \"Can't you and the child leave this horrible place at once?\"  She spoke quickly, in muffled tones.  \"Oh, if we only could!\" Mary sobbed.  \"Grandie dear, you are falling ill!  What have they done to you?  I heard Janos threaten Reda!\"  The figure in the chair was now sagging into a helpless heap.  Cleo and Grace, quick to sense the necessity for prompt action, had both hurried to the door to call the driver from the car.  Even Madaline forgot her own timidity, and seeing a switch button for what she thought to be lights, she crossed to the corner and quickly pressed a tiny button. As she did so she felt something like a wire with a spool attached, and almost unconsciously she gave the spool a yank.  Instantly a flood of light of marvelous brilliancy engulfed the room.  \"Oh!\" Madaline screamed, shocked by the glare and a queer sizzling noise that hissed through the room.  Jennie covered her eyes and clung to a chair, but Mary jumped to her feet and stood staring silently at the leaded glass door.  \"Don't move!\" she ordered.  There was a sudden crash, the sound of splintering glass, and then the room fell again into the sullen light reflected only from the group of hanging brass lanterns, the artistic shades for the regulation electric lights.  \"They are gone!\" breathed Mary.  \"Oh, what a miracle that was!  You touched the wire--that sent a current all about them!  Grandie!\"  She threw her arms"]]]
