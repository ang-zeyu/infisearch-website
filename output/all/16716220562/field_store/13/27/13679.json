We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade     Of that lone birch-tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.      \"We were just like a great big family, and every man had his squaw,     And we lived such a wild, free, fearless life beyond the pale of the           law;     Till sudden there came a whisper, and it maddened us every man,     And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began.      \"Oh, those Dawson days, and the sin and the blaze, and the town all           open wide!     (If God made me in His likeness, sure He let the devil inside.)     But we all were mad, both the good and the bad, and as for the           women, well--     No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell.      \"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.     I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade, but she shook me in the end.     It put me queer, and for near a year I never drew sober breath,     Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on           death.      \"Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks;     Roaming its giant valleys, scaling its god-like peaks;     Bathed in its fiery sunsets, fighting its fiendish cold,     Twenty years in the Yukon ... twenty years--and I'm old.      \"Old and weak, but no matter, there's 'hooch' in the bottle still.     I'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow, and mush down the trail to Bill.     It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome--I'll just lay down on the bed,     To-morrow I'll go ... to-morrow ... I guess I'll play on the red.      \"... Come, Kit, your pony is saddled. I'm waiting, dear, in the           court ...     ... Minnie, you devil, I'll kill you if you skip with that flossy           sport ...     ... How much does it go to the pan, Bill?... play up, School, and           play the game ...     ... Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name ...\"      _This was the song of the parson's son, as he lay in his bunk alone,     Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in, and his blue lips           ceased to moan,     And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone._     THE SPELL OF THE YUKON       I wanted the gold, and I sought it;       I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.     Was it famine or scurvy--I fought it,       I hurled my youth into the grave.     I wanted the gold and I got it--       Came out with a fortune last fall,--     Yet somehow life's not what I thought it,       And somehow the gold isn't all.      No! There's the land. (Have you seen it?)       It's the cussedest land that I know,     From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it,       To the deep, deathlike valleys below.     Some say God was tired when He made it;       Some say it's a fine land to shun;     Maybe: but there's some as would trade it       For no land on earth--and I'm one.      You come to get rich (damned good reason),       You feel like an exile at first;     You hate it like hell for a season,       And then you are worse than the worst.     It grips you like some kinds of sinning;       It twists you from foe to a friend;     It seems it's been since the beginning;       It seems it will be to the end.      I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow       That's plumb-full of hush to the brim;     I've watched the big, husky sun wallow       In crimson and gold, and grow dim,     Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,       And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;     And I've thought that I surely was dreaming,       With the peace o' the world piled on top.      The summer--no sweeter was ever;       The sunshiny woods all athrill;     The grayling aleap in the river,       The bighorn asleep on the hill.     The strong life that never knows harness;       The wilds where the caribou call;     The freshness, the freedom, the farness--       O God! how I'm stuck on it all.      The winter! the brightness that blinds you,       The white land locked tight as a drum,     The cold fear that follows and finds you,       The silence that bludgeons you dumb.     The snows that are older than history,       The woods where the weird shadows slant;     The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery,       I've bade 'em good-bye--but I can't.      There's a land where the mountains are nameless,       And the rivers all run God knows where;     There are lives that are erring and aimless,       And deaths that just hang by a hair;     There are hardships that nobody reckons;       There are valleys unpeopled and still;     There's a land--oh, it beckons and beckons,       And I want to go back--and I will.      They're making my money diminish;       I'm sick of the taste of champagne.     Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish       I'll pike to the Yukon again.     I'll fight--and you bet it's no sham-fight;       It's hell!--but I've been there before;     And it's better than this by a damsite--       So me for the Yukon once more.      There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting;       It's luring me on as of old;     Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting,       So much as just finding the gold.     It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder,       It's the forests where silence has lease;     It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder,       It's the stillness that fills me with peace.     THE CALL OF THE WILD       Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,       Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,     Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,       Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?     Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking           through it,       Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?     Have you strung your soul to silence? Then for God's sake go and do it;       Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.      Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sage-brush desolation,       The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?     Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,       And learned to know the desert's little ways?     Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,       Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?     Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its moods and changes?       Then listen to the wild--it's calling you.      Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig           a-quiver?       (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)     Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,       Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?     Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,       Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?     And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?       Then hearken to the wild--it's wanting you.      Have you suffered, starved, and triumphed grovelled, down, yet           grasped at glory,       Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?     \"Done things\" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,       Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?     Have you seen God in His splendours, heard the text that nature           renders?       (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)     The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things--       Then listen to the wild--it's calling you.      They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their           preaching,       They have soaked you in convention through and through;     They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching--       But can't you hear the wild?--it's calling you.     Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;       Let us journey to a lonely land I know.     There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,       And the wild is calling, calling ... let us go.     THE LONE TRAIL       _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,     Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.     Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-bye;     The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die._      The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;     You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways           divide;     And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,     Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.     And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy           needs,     And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.     And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of           the mouth,     And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.     And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone           camp-fire,     And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.     And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the           orchid glows,     And you rave to your grave with the fever, and they rob the corpse           for its clothes.     And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your           bones,     And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like           stones.     And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,     And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.     And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail, and the snows where your           torn feet freeze,     And you whittle away the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25546"],["title","Songs of a Sourdough (#2)"],["body","clay, and crawl on your hands and           knees.     Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;     By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're           fain.     By your bones they will follow behind you, till the ways of the           world are made plain.      _Bid good-bye to sweetheart, bid good-bye to friend;     The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.     Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;     Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._     THE HEART OF THE SOURDOUGH       There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon;     There where the sullen sun-dogs glare in the snow-bright, bitter noon,     And the glacier-gutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June:      There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows;     There where the Silences are spawned, and the light of hell-fire flows     Into the bowl of the midnight sky, violet, amber, and rose:      There where the rapids churn and roar, and the ice-floes bellowing run;     Where the tortured, twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun--     I've packed my kit and I'm going, boys, ere another day is done.             *       *       *       *       *      I knew it would call, or soon or late, as it calls the whirring wings;     It's the olden lure, it's the golden lure, it's the lure of the           timeless things;     And to-night, O God of the trails untrod, how it whines in my           heart-strings!      I'm sick to death of your well-groomed gods, your make-believe and           your show;     I long for a whiff of bacon and beans, a snug shake-down in the snow,     A trail to break, and a life at stake, and another bout with the foe;      With the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life, the wild that would           crush and rend;     I have clinched and closed with the naked North, I have learned to           defy and defend;     Shoulder to shoulder we've fought it out--yet the Wild must win in           the end.      I have flouted the Wild. I have followed its lure, fearless,           familiar, alone;     By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own;     Yet the Wild must win, and a day will come when I shall be overthrown.      Then when as wolf-dogs fight we've fought, the lean wolf-land and I;     Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky;     Even as lean wolf-dog goes down will I go down and die.     THE THREE VOICES       The waves have a story to tell me,       As I lie on the lonely beach;     Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,       The wind has a lesson to teach;     But the stars sing an anthem of glory       I cannot put into speech.      The waves tell of ocean spaces,       Of hearts that are wild and brave,     Of populous city places,       Of desolate shores they lave;     Of men who sally in quest of gold       To sink in an ocean grave.      The wind is a mighty roamer;       He bids me keep me free,     Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,       Hardy and pure as he;     Cling with my love to nature       As a child to the mother-knee.      But the stars throng out in their glory,       And they sing of the God in man;     They sing of the mighty Master,       Of the loom His fingers span;     Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole,       And weft in the wondrous plan.      Here by the camp-fire's flicker,       Deep in my blanket curled,     I long for the peace of the pine-gloom       When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,     And the wind and the wave are silent,       And world is singing to world.     THE PINES       We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;     The grey moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,     And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam           shines.      On the flanks of the storm-gored ridges are our black battalions           massed;     We surge in a host to the sullen coast, and we sing in the ocean blast;     From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast.      To the niggard lands were we driven; 'twixt desert and foe are we           penned.     To us was the Northland given, ours to stronghold and defend;     Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end.      Ours from the bleak beginning, through the æons of death-like sleep;     Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing           deep;     Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier-creep.      Wind of the East, wind of the West, wandering to and fro,     Chant your songs in our topmost boughs, that the sons of men may know     The peerless pine was the first to come, and the pine will be last           to go!      We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;     The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole, and our ancients crash           and roar;     But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.      We spring from the gloom of the canyon's womb; in the valley's lap           we lie;     From the white foam-fringe where the breakers cringe to the peaks           that tusk the sky     We climb, and we peer in the crag-locked mere that gleams like a           golden eye,--      Gain to the verge of the hog-back ridge where the vision ranges free:     Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see;     A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery.      Sun, moon and stars, give answer; shall we not staunchly stand     Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,     Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last lone land!     THE HARPY       _There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she;     She was old, so old, yet her years all told were but a score and three;     And she knew by heart, from finish to start, the Book of Iniquity._      There is no hope for such as I, on earth nor yet in Heaven;     Unloved I live, unloved I die, unpitied, unforgiven;     A loathèd jade I ply my trade, unhallowed and unshriven.      I paint my cheeks, for they are white, and cheeks of chalk men hate;     Mine eyes with wine I make to shine, that men may seek and sate;     With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait.      Until they come, the nightly scum, with drunken eyes aflame;     Your sweethearts, sons, ye scornful ones--'tis I who know their shame;     The gods ye see are brutes to me--and so I play my game.      For life is not the thing we thought, and not the thing we plan;     And woman in a bitter world must do the best she can;     Must yield the stroke, and bear the yoke, and serve the will of man;      Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire;     Though be she loved for love alone, or be she loved for hire;     For every man since life began is tainted with the mire.      And though you know he love you so, and set you on love's throne,     Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs, and let your heart be stone,     Lest you be left (as I was left) attainted and alone.      From love's close kiss to hell's abyss is one sheer flight, I trow;     And wedding-ring and bridal bell are will-o'-wisps of woe;     And 'tis not wise to love too well, and this all women know.      Wherefore, the wolf-pack having gorged upon the lamb, their prey,     With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolf-pack pay;     With velvet paws and flensing claws, a tigress roused to slay.      One who in youth sought truest truth, and found a devil's lies;     A symbol of the sin of man, a human sacrifice:     Yet shall I blame on man the shame? Could it be otherwise?      Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride?     The Maker marred, and evil-starred I drift upon His tide;     And He alone shall judge His own, so I His judgment bide.      _Fate has written a tragedy; its name is \"The Human Heart.\"     The theatre is the House of Life, Woman the mummer's part:     The Devil enters the prompter's box and the play is ready to start._     THE LURE OF LITTLE VOICES       There's a cry from out the Loneliness--Oh, listen, Honey, listen!       Do you hear it, do you fear it, you're a-holding of me so?     You're a-sobbing in your sleep, dear, and your lashes, how they           glisten--       Do you hear the Little Voices all a-begging me to go?      All a-begging me to leave you. Day and night they're pleading, praying,       On the North-wind, on the West-wind, from the peak and from the           plain;     Night and day they never leave me--do you know what they are saying?       \"He was ours before you got him, and we want him once again.\"      Yes, they're wanting me, they're haunting me, the awful lonely places;       They're whining and they're whimpering as if each had a soul;     They're calling from the wilderness, the vast and god-like spaces,       The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.      They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming       In the womb of desolation where was never man before;     As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming;       And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.      And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying:       The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child;     My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them sleeping, waking;       It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild.      I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;       But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.     Oh, it's cruel, dearie, cruel, and it's God knows how I'm grieving;       But His Loneliness is calling and He knows I must obey.     THE SONG OF THE WAGE-SLAVE       When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,     I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.     And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met-"]]]
