RAYMOND  That with your personality and record against General McClellan's, your Democratic opponent--the election for us is lost.                               LINCOLN  Your statement is blunt. But, as I have been renominated for a second term, my administration has been endorsed by our party, and the election is only eight weeks off--there is but one conclusion possible--and that is, that you should roll up your sleeves and get to work.                               RAYMOND  The National Committee, Mr. President, has reached a different conclusion----                               LINCOLN  Yes----?                               RAYMOND  In view of your unpopularity, in view of the criticism of your policies, and your conduct of the war--they have decided to ask you to withdraw from the ticket and permit them to name a new candidate----                               LINCOLN      [_Springing to his feet._]  What----!                               RAYMOND  I _have_ stated it bluntly----                               LINCOLN  And this is your unanimous verdict, gentlemen----?                               ALL  Yes.                               LINCOLN      [_Paces the floor a moment and then faces the Committee._]  It surpasses human belief! Future generations will hold it incredible--that you, my party leaders, should heap this insult upon the man who led you to your first and only victory. That you should come here to-day to ask me to quit under fire, to sacrifice without a blow all I hold worth fighting for on this earth----!                               RAYMOND  The Committee made their request solely on the ground of patriotic duty--and ask you for the sacrifice upon the same grounds. They have found it impossible to defend your policies----                               LINCOLN      [_Brusquely._]  What policies?                               RAYMOND  Understand me, Mr. President--I am telling you the conclusion of this Committee----                               LINCOLN  All right, Raymond--fire away--spare me the oratory, please--just give me the plain reasons, one at a time, why you wish me to get off the ticket----                               RAYMOND  The first policy found indefensible has been your handling of the border slave states of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri. You have not yet declared the slaves free in these states, the only ones in which you actually have the power to do so--at all.                               LINCOLN  The first policy of my Administration has been to save for the Union the great border states--for the simple reason--with these border slave states, we have such a balance of power that the Union _may_ be saved! Without these states, the Union _cannot_ be saved! Therefore in my Proclamation of Emancipation, I purposely did not raise the question of the right or wrong of slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. But the Constitution of the United States, which I have sworn to uphold in the border states of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, guarantees to their people the right to hold slaves if they choose.                               RAYMOND  But why pat on the back the slaveholder of Maryland and strike at the slaveholder of South Carolina?                               LINCOLN  Because Maryland is loyal to the Union, and South Carolina is fighting it. My Proclamation was not a sermon on the rights of man--black or white. It was an act of war--a blow aimed at the heart of the seceding South to break its wealth and power, end the war, and save the Union. I know the spell of _State loyalty_ in the South, gentlemen. I was born there. Many a mother in Richmond wept the day our flag fell from their Capitol. But they brushed their tears away and sent their sons to the front the next day, to fight that flag--_in the name of Virginia_! So would thousands of mothers in these border slave states, if I put them to the test. In God's own time slavery will be destroyed. I have saved these states for our cause by conciliation and compromise. I will not apologize for this act.      [_He lifts his hand to stop interruption._]  My paramount object is to save the Union, and not, either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union, without freeing a slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it _helps to save this Union_!      [_Pauses and faces his accusers._]  I'll test this question right here--will the three Committeemen from Kentucky, Missouri and Maryland stand up for a minute?      [_The three Committeemen rise._]  Will the gentleman from Kentucky tell me what would have been the effect if I had included his state in my proclamation freeing the slaves----?                               THE KENTUCKY COMMITTEEMAN  The state would have seceded from the Union, sir.                               LINCOLN  Just so, and in Missouri?                               THE MISSOURI COMMITTEEMAN  The Legislature would have joined the Confederacy within twenty-four hours.                               LINCOLN  And Maryland----?                               THE MARYLAND COMMITTEEMAN  Maryland would have promptly cut the railroads leading into Washington, isolated the Capital and joined the South.                               LINCOLN  And with the loss of our Capital, Europe, eager to strike, would have recognized the Confederacy, would they not?                               THE MARYLAND COMMITTEEMAN  Undoubtedly, sir----                               LINCOLN  So I hold----                               THE MARYLAND COMMITTEEMAN  Our State believed you when you said in your Inaugural: \"I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists!\"                               LINCOLN  Then you three gentlemen, at least, are with me on this issue?                               ALL THREE  Yes--! Yes--! Yes--!                               LINCOLN  I thought so----      [_To Raymond._]  What next?                               RAYMOND  Your plan to _colonize_ the Negro race as expressed in your Proclamation of Emancipation and in the bill which you have had passed through Congress has hurt your best friends----                               LINCOLN  And why should it? My views on that subject were known to all men before you nominated me first in Chicago, four years ago. I said then that I believed there is a sharp physical difference between the white and black races, and I have always linked colonization with freedom. The Negro cannot remain in a free democracy unless we absorb him into our social and political life. Therefore, we must colonize him. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to future generations--above all, we owe it to the Negro himself. He was brought here by cruel force. At our own expense, therefore, we should return him to the home of his fathers, and build there a free republic for his children. We should give him our language and our ideals, and we should give him millions of our money, until he can stand alone. We must face this problem squarely now.                               RAYMOND  Yet you compromise on other issues.                               LINCOLN  Only because I must to save the Union. Trim and hedge on _this_ issue, and future generations will feel their way back to it through blood and tears. I have always held that the happiness and progress of this Union of Free Democratic States will be secure only in the separation of the white and black races, and I will not eat my words!----      [_Pauses._]  --the next charge in your bill of indictment, gentlemen?                               RAYMOND  I now present the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, leader of Congress, the representative of the radical wing of our party, who have split our organization by nominating another candidate for President--Mr. Stevens will give their views.                               STEVENS      [_Pompously to the Committee._]  The radical wing of the party, gentlemen, has been the only creative force within it--and is the only thing that gives it an excuse for being to-day.                               LINCOLN      [_Firmly._]  Which means that you think that I am superfluous and always have been--I thank you--proceed!                               STEVENS  We denounce first your policy of reconstruction in the South as weak and vacillating--a civil and military failure. As the army advances, the South should be held as conquered soil, its civilization torn up by the roots, the property of the Southern white people confiscated and given to the negroes. The ballot must be taken from the whites and given to their slaves. We demand this just vengeance and we will be content with nothing less!                               LINCOLN  Stevens, I greet with shame your demands! Surely the vastness of this war, its grim battles, its heroism, its anguish, its sublime earnestness, should sink all schemes of revenge. Before the grandeur of its simple story our children will walk with uncovered heads. Conquered soil! The South has never been out of this Union. Secession was null and void from the beginning. I say to the South now, as I have always said: \"Come back home! You can have peace at any moment, by simply laying down your arms and submitting to the National Authority.\" When the South lies crushed at our feet, God's vengeance shall be enough.                               STEVENS  The life of our party, sir, demands that the Negro be given the ballot and made the ruler of the South. This is not vengeance. It is justice--it is patriotism.                               LINCOLN  The Nation cannot be healed until the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25814"],["title","A Man of the People: A Drama of Abraham Lincoln (#7)"],["body","is healed. Let the gulf be closed in which we bury strifes and hatreds. The good sense of our people will never consent to your scheme of vengeance.                               STEVENS  The people have no sense! And a new fool is born every second.                               LINCOLN  I have an abiding faith in their honesty and good purpose. I have trusted the people before, and they have not failed me.                               STEVENS  Bah----!                               LINCOLN  I can't tell you, Stevens, how your venomous plans sicken me. I'd rather work with you than fight you, if it's possible. But the line is drawn now--we've got to fight--and I'm not afraid of you.                               STEVENS  You had better listen----                               LINCOLN  I'll suffer my right arm to be severed from my body before I'll sign one measure of revenge on a brave, fallen foe!                               STEVENS  I have always known you had a sneaking admiration for the South!                               LINCOLN  I love the South--it is a part of this Union! And when the curse of slavery is lifted, it should be the garden spot of the world--I love every foot of its soil--every hill and valley, and every man, woman and child in it. I am an American!                               STEVENS  The kind of an American that makes the election of your opponent, General George B. McClellan, a certainty----                               LINCOLN  Well, who would you put in my place?      [_He faces_ RAYMOND _and_ STEVENS, _and dead silence follows._]  Come on--out with his name----!      [_They remain silent._]  You can't name him? Let me try to nominate him for you---- On a platform of proscription and revenge, the hanging of rebel leaders, the confiscation of the property of the white people of the South and its bestowment upon the negroes, the taking of the ballot from the whites and setting their slaves to rule over them--on this program I resign as your candidate and nominate for President, the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens----                               THE COMMITTEE      [_In a wild uproar._]  No! No! No! Not by a damn sight! To hell with Stevens!      [LINCOLN _quietly laughs and_ STEVENS _angrily lifts his hand to     quiet them._]                               STEVENS  Now that you've had your joke--let me remind you that the radical wing of the Republican Party has already named General John C. Fremont against you----                               LINCOLN      [_To the Committee._]  What say you, gentlemen----? Shall I resign in favor of the bolter who attempted to dictate to you your platform and your candidate before your convention met? Do you ask me to resign in favor of General Fremont?                               THE COMMITTEE  No! No! Down with the bolter! To the devil with Fremont. No! No! No! Damnation--no----      [RAYMOND _quiets the uproar._]                               STEVENS  I am not asking you to nominate Fremont. We split the party and named Fremont because we wouldn't have you. Get off the ticket and we will withdraw Fremont and put up a man who can be elected! Whatever the chances of General Fremont at this moment the election of McClellan on a Democratic Copperhead Platform is conceded by your own party councils. McClellan is even now choosing his Cabinet----                               LINCOLN  They say it is not wise to count chickens before they're hatched--we still have our chance!                               STEVENS  You have no chance! You have _already_ been weighed and found wanting! In the Congressional election, what happened?--your majorities were wiped out. Maine cut you down from nineteen thousand to four! The Democrats swept Ohio. Indiana deserted us. In Pennsylvania even, we lost by four thousand. New York elected Horatio Seymour against us. New Jersey turned you down. Wisconsin was a tie. In your own state of Illinois, the Democrats won by seventeen thousand----!                               LINCOLN  Even so, Stevens--the ballots in _this_ election have not yet been counted! My faith in the ultimate good sense of the people is unshaken. You can fool some of the people all the time. You can fool all of the people sometimes. But you can't fool all the people all the time!                               STEVENS  That's why we ask you to get off the ticket! You are to-day the most unpopular man who ever sat in the Presidential chair. For the first time in our history the effigy of a living President--your effigy--has been publicly burned in the streets of American towns and cities, amid the curses and jeers of the men who elected you! Your administration is a failure--your conduct of the war a series of blunders----                               LINCOLN      [_Brusquely._]  For example----                               STEVENS      [_Furiously._]  For one thing--you have never yet chosen a successful General. The South has not changed Commanders since Jeff Davis appointed Robert E. Lee. In thirty days of the last campaign in a series of massacres, Lee has killed and wounded sixty-two thousand of our men--more than he himself commanded--and Grant has only reached the point where McClellan stood in 1862. He could have marched there by McClellan's old line without the loss of a man. Washington is piled with the wounded, the dying and the dead. Your mail is choked with letters demanding the removal of this butcher as our Commander, and you refuse--why?                               LINCOLN      [_Smiling calmly._]  Well, now that you've _really_ let off steam, I think you'll feel better, Stevens----!                               STEVENS  I demand, sir, an answer to my question--why have you not removed Grant?                               LINCOLN      [_Quickly._]  Because I can't spare him! He is the one General we have developed who knows how to fight--his business is not to reach any particular spot where McClellan stood. McClellan was generally _standing_ somewhere--he was a great engineer--of the stationary type---- Grant is a fighter. His business is to find and destroy Lee's army--and his sledge hammer blows are winning this war!                               STEVENS  Winning--is he? And yet Lee sends a division under Jubal Early and reconquers the Valley of Virginia--invades Maryland and Pennsylvania, throws his shells into Washington and burns the home of one of your Cabinet----                               LINCOLN  And if old Jubal Early had been a little _earlier_, he would have burned Washington, too--but thank God, Grant got here in time--didn't he? What have you got to say to that?                               STEVENS  That Lee's strategy has been superb, his moral victory complete! He holds Grant by the throat while he invades the North, and _shells_ our Capitol--a feat that not one of your generals has yet done for Richmond in four years--and still you cling to Grant----!                               LINCOLN      [_Angrily._]  Now, I'm going to talk plain English to you, Stevens. You're an Abolitionist, and you can't do Grant justice. Your crowd demanded his removal after the battle of Shiloh--and you made it so hot for me then, I had to appoint General Halleck his superior, to save him for the country. You can't forget that Grant is a Democrat, and therefore he may vote for McClellan against our party, in this election!                               STEVENS  I've heard that he _is_ for McClellan.                               LINCOLN  Exactly! And you can't forget that his wife is a Southern woman whose dowry was in Slaves, and therefore at this moment, Grant is constructively a slaveholder, whose slaves I have not freed----                               STEVENS  I protest----                               LINCOLN  It's no use--I know the process of your mind--I can see the wheels go round inside! You tell me that the star of Grant has set in a welter of blood before Lee's army. I do not believe it. I know that miles of hospital barracks are the witnesses of our agony. I know that every city, town and village is in mourning. From these stricken homes there has arisen a storm of protest against the new leader of the army. The word butcher is bandied from lip to lip. They tell me that Grant is merely a bulldog fighter--that he can win only as long as thousands are poured into his ranks to take the place of the dead--They tell me that he has no genius, no strategy, no skill. My reply to this is simple but unanswerable. We must fight to win. Grant is the ablest general we have developed. His losses are appalling--but the struggle is on now to the bitter end! Our resources are exhaustless. The South cannot replace _her_ fallen soldiers--and therefore _her_ losses are fatal! If we continue to fight, five millions cannot whip twenty millions--the end is certain--and we're now locked in the last death grapple before--VICTORY!                               STEVENS  It's a waste of time to talk----!                               LINCOLN  I've thought so from the first, but I've tried to be polite----                               STEVENS      [_Trying to go._]  Good day, sir----!                               LINCOLN      [_Cordially._]  Good day, Stevens----      [_Pauses._]  You know this meeting reminds me of what happened in Illinois once----                               STEVENS      [_Throwing up his hands in anger._]  I won't hear it, sir! You and your stories are sending this country to hell--it's not more than a mile from there now!                               LINCOLN  I believe it _is_ just a mile from here to the Capitol where you sit!                               STEVENS      [_Going in rage._]  Damnation!      [STEVENS _goes muttering furiously._]                               RAYMOND  You will consider our request, Mr. President?                               LINCOLN  Raymond, this is the most brutal insult ever offered"]]]
