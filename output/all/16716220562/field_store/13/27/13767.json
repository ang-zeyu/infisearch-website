[Illustration: A]LCOHOL looks like water, but it is not at all like water.  Alcohol will take fire, and burn if a lighted match is held near it; but you know that water will not burn.  When alcohol burns, the color of the flame is blue. It does not give much light: it makes no smoke or soot; but it does give a great deal of heat.  A little dead tree-toad was once put into a bottle of alcohol. It was years ago, but the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it did the first day it was put in. What has kept it so?  It is the alcohol. The tree-toad would have soon decayed if it had been put into water. So you see that alcohol keeps dead bodies from decaying.  Pure alcohol is not often used as a drink. People who take beer, wine, and cider get a little alcohol with each drink. Those who drink brandy, rum, whiskey, or gin, get more alcohol, because those liquors are nearly one half alcohol.  You may wonder that people wish to use such poisonous drinks at all. But alcohol is a deceiver. It often cheats the man who takes a little, into thinking it will be good for him to take more.  Sometimes the appetite which begs so hard for the poison, is formed in childhood. If you eat wine-jelly, or wine-sauce, you may learn to like the taste of alcohol and thus easily begin to drink some weak liquor.  The more the drinker takes, the more he often wants, and thus he goes on from drinking cider, wine, or beer, to drinking whiskey, brandy, or rum. Thus drunkards are made.  People who are in the habit of taking drinks which contain alcohol, often care more for them than for any thing else, even when they know they are being ruined by them.

When is the appetite sometimes formed?             8. Why should you not eat wine-sauce or                wine-jelly?             9. How are drunkards made?     CHAPTER VIII.  TOBACCO.   [Illustration: A] FARMER who had been in the habit of planting his fields with corn, wheat, and potatoes, once made up his mind to plant tobacco instead.  Let us see whether he did any good to the world by the change.  The tobacco plants grew up as tall as a little boy or girl, and spread out broad, green leaves.  By and by he pulled the stalks, and dried the leaves. Some of them he pressed into cakes of tobacco; some he rolled into cigars; and some he ground into snuff.  If you ask what tobacco is good for, the best answer will be, to tell you what it will do to a man or boy who uses it, and then let you answer the question for yourselves.  Tobacco contains something called nicotine (nĭk´o tĭn). This is a strong poison. One drop of it is enough to kill a dog. In one cigar there is enough, if taken pure, to kill two men.  [Illustration]  Even to work upon tobacco, makes people pale and sickly. Once I went into a snuff mill, and the man who had the care of it showed me how the work was done.  The mill stood in a pretty place, beside a little stream which turned the mill-wheel. Tall trees bent over it, and a fresh breeze was blowing through the open windows. Yet the smell of the tobacco was so strong that I had to go to the door many times, for a breath of pure air.  I asked the man if it did not make him sick to work there.  He said: \"It made me very sick for the first few weeks. Then I began to get used to it, and now I don't mind it.\"  He was like the boys who try to learn to smoke. It almost always makes them sick at first; but they think it will be manly to keep on. At last, they get used to it.  The sickness is really the way in which the boy's body is trying to say to him: \"There is danger here; you are playing with poison. Let me stop you before great harm is done.\"  Perhaps you will say: \"I have seen men smoke cigars, even four or five in a day, and it didn't kill them.\"  It did not kill them, because they did not swallow the nicotine. They only drew in a little with the breath. But taking a little poison in this way, day after day, can not be safe, or really helpful to any one.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. What did the farmer plant instead of corn,                wheat, and potatoes?             2. What was done with the tobacco leaves?             3. What is the name of the poison which is in                tobacco?             4. How much of it is needed to kill a dog?             5. What harm can the nicotine in one cigar do, if                taken pure?             6. Tell the story of the visit to the snuff mill.             7. Why are boys made sick by their first use of                tobacco?             8. Why does not smoking a cigar kill a man?             9. What is said about a little poison?     CHAPTER IX.  OPIUM.   [Illustration: A]LCOHOL and tobacco are called narcotics (nar kŏt´iks). This means that they have the power of putting the nerves to sleep. Opium (ō´pĭ ŭm) is another narcotic.  It is a poison made from the juice of poppies, and is used in medicines.  Opium is put into soothing-syrups (sĭr´ŭps), and these are sometimes given to babies to keep them from crying. They do this by injuring the tender nerves and poisoning the little body.  How can any one give a baby opium to save taking patient care of it?  Surely the mothers would not do it, if they knew that this soothing-syrup that appears like a friend, coming to quiet and comfort the baby, is really an enemy.  [Illustration: _Don't give soothing-syrup to children._]  Sometimes, a child no older than some of you are, is left at home with the care of a baby brother or sister; so it is best that you should know about this dangerous enemy, and never be tempted to quiet the baby by giving him a poison, instead of taking your best and kindest care of him.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. What is a narcotic?             2. Name three narcotics?             3. From what is opium made?             4. For what is it used?             5. Why is soothing-syrup dangerous?     CHAPTER X.  WHAT ARE ORGANS?   [Illustration: A]N organ is a part of the body which has some special work to do. The eye is the organ of sight. The stomach (stŭm´ăk) is an organ which takes care of the food we eat.   THE TEETH.  [Illustration: _Different kinds of teeth._]  Your teeth do not look alike, since they must do different kinds of work. The front ones cut, the back ones grind.  They are made of a kind of bone covered with a hard smooth enamel (ĕn ăm´el). If the enamel is broken, the teeth soon decay and ache, for each tooth is furnished with a nerve that very quickly feels pain.   CARE OF THE TEETH.  Cracking nuts with the teeth, or even biting thread, is apt to break the enamel; and when once broken, you will wish in vain to have it mended. The dentist can fill a hole in the tooth; but he can not cover the tooth with new enamel.  Bits of food should be carefully picked from between the teeth with a tooth-pick of quill or wood, never with a pin or other hard and sharp thing which might break the enamel.  The teeth must also be well brushed. Nothing but perfect cleanliness will keep them in good order. Always brush them before breakfast. Your breakfast will taste all the better for it. Brush them at night before you go to bed, lest some food should be decaying in your mouth during the night.  Take care of these cutters and grinders, that they may not decay, and so be unable to do their work well.   THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN.  You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone.  These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony case or box.  In it are some of the most useful organs of the body.  This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may say it is two stories high.  The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen (ăb dō´mĕn).  In the chest, are the heart and the lungs.  In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs.   THE STOMACH.  The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you will say, when I tell you what it can do.  The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called gastric (găs´trĭk) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.  Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and apples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up the bag and lay it away on a shelf for a few hours, and then show you that the beef had disappeared, so had the apples, so had the potatoes, the bread and milk, sugar, and salt, and the bag was filled only with a thin, grayish fluid? Would you not call it a magical bag?  Now, your stomach and mine are just such magical bags.  We put in our breakfasts, dinners, and suppers; and, after a few hours, they are changed. The gastric juice has been mixed with them. The strong muscles that form the outside of the stomach have been squeezing the food, rolling it about, and mixing it together, until it has all been changed to a thin, grayish fluid.   HOW DOES ANYBODY KNOW THIS?  A soldier was once shot in the side in such a way that when the wound healed, it left an opening with a piece of loose skin over it, like a little door leading into his stomach.  A doctor who wished to learn about the stomach, hired him for a servant and used to study him every day.  He would push aside the little flap of skin and put into the stomach any kind of food that he pleased, and then watch to see what happened to it.  In this way, he learned a great deal and wrote it down, so that other people might know, too. In other ways, also, which it would take too long to tell you here, doctors have learned how these magical food-bags take care of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],["title","Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#5)"],["body","food.   WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED?  Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal and milk to make you grow into a big man or woman.  Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part of milk?  That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do not look like milk.  If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and busy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to each part and feed it.  When the food in the stomach is mixed and prepared, it is ready to be sent through the body; some is carried to the bones, some to the muscles, some to the nerves and brain, some to the skin, and some even to the finger nails, the hair, and the eyes. Each part needs to be fed in order to grow.   WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD?  Children need each day to make larger and larger bones, larger muscles, and a larger skin to cover the larger body.  Every day, each part is also wearing out a little, and needing to be mended by some new food. People who have grown up, need their food for this work of mending.   CARE OF THE STOMACH.  One way to take care of the stomach is to give it only its own work to do. The teeth must first do their work faithfully.  The stomach must have rest, too. I have seen some children who want to make their poor stomachs work all the time. They are always eating apples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to rest. If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a machine would.  The stomach can not work well, unless it is quite warm. If a person pours ice-water into his stomach as he eats, just as the food is beginning to change into the gray fluid of which you have learned, the work stops until the stomach gets warm again.   ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.  You remember about the man who had the little door to his stomach. Sometimes, the doctor put in wine, cider, brandy, or some drink that contained alcohol, to see what it would do. It was carried away very quickly; but during the little time it stayed, it did nothing but harm.  It injured the gastric juice, so that it could not mix with the food.  If the doctor had put in more alcohol, day after day, as one does who drinks liquor, sores would perhaps have come on the delicate lining of the stomach. Sometimes the stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the drinker dies. If the stomach can not do its work well, the whole body must suffer from want of the good food it needs.[C]   TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.  The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare the food, before it goes into the stomach. Tobacco makes the mouth very dry, and more saliva has to flow out to moisten it.  But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva, and that must not be swallowed. It must be spit out, and with it is sent the saliva that was needed to help prepare the food.  Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad sores in the mouth, and often causes a disease of the throat.  You can tell where some people have been, by the neatness and comfort they leave after them.  You can tell where the tobacco-user has been, by the dirty floor, and street, and the air made unfit to breathe, because of the smoke and strong, bad smell of old tobacco from his pipe and cigar and from his breath and clothes.

FOOTNOTE:  [Footnote C: The food is partly prepared by the liver and some other organs.]     CHAPTER XI.  WHAT DOES THE BODY NEED FOR FOOD?   [Illustration: N]OW that you know how the body is fed, you must next learn what to feed it with; and what each part needs to make it grow and to keep it strong and well.   WATER.  A large part of your body is made of water. So you need, of course, to drink water, and to have it used in preparing your food.  Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs in the ground. From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our houses.  Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well from which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket.  Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead mixed with it. Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you drank it.  Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or a stable.  If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by it. It is better to go thirsty, until you can get good water.  A sufficient quantity of pure water to drink is just as important for us, as good food to eat.  We could not drink all the water that our bodies need. We take a large part of it in our food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in beefsteak and bread.   LIME.  Bones need lime. You remember the bone that was nothing but crumbling lime after it had been in the fire.  Where shall we get lime for our bones?  We can not eat lime; but the grass and the grains take it out of the earth. Then the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk, and in the milk we drink, we get some of the lime to feed our bones.  [Illustration: _Lime being prepared for our use._]  In the same way, the grain growing in the field takes up lime and other things that we need, but could not eat for ourselves. The lime that thus becomes a part of the grain, we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and other foods.   SALT.  Animals need salt, as children who live in the country know very well. They have seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick up the salt that the farmer gives them.  Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out places where there are salt springs, and go in great herds to get the salt.  We, too, need some salt mixed with our food. If we did not put it in, either when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the food itself.   FLESH-MAKING FOODS.  Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making foods. These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat and eggs. Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground. Meat and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the cattle and hens eat.   FAT-MAKING FOODS.  We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to keep us warm and make us comfortable. So we must have certain kinds of food that will make fat.  [Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._]  There are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other things in this world. When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is fat badly made, and in the wrong place.  The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from fat-making foods.  In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as in cold countries people need such food all the time.  The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat. You would not be well unless you ate some fat or butter or oil.   WHAT WILL MAKE FAT?  Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat meat. As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of food. Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food. Fat meat comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane, maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains.  Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten. The starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it can mix with the blood and help feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit, it changes its starch to sugar. You can tell this by the difference in the taste of ripe and unripe apples.   CANDY.  Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more sugar than is good for them. You would starve if fed only on sugar.  We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it were not for the poison with which it is often colored.  Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such. There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves.  If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all dissolve and disappear. Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and disappear.  If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white earth. This is not good food for anybody. Candy-makers often put it into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. Why do we need food?             2.
