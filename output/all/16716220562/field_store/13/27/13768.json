[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:            Roast beef,           Potatoes,           Tomatoes,           Squash,           Bread,           Butter,           Salt,           Water,           Peaches,           Bananas,           Oranges,           Grapes.  What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to make up this dinner?  The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked. Cooking prepares them to be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach. If they were not cooked, this work would be very hard. Instead of going on quietly and without letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in the overworked stomach.  The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it.  When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your homes. You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as much as food poorly cooked.  \"A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good doctor.\"   THE SALIVA.  Next to the cooking comes the eating.  As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called saliva (sa lī´vá), moistens and mixes with it.  Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken into the blood.  You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar. Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker. The cracker is made mostly of starch, because wheat is full of starch. At first, the cracker is dry and tasteless. Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into sugar.  All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have more than its share to do. That is hardly fair.  If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its work, the stomach will have extra work. But it will find it hard to do more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain.  It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as plain as words.   SWALLOWING.  Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing. Is there any thing wonderful about that?  We have two passages leading down our throats. One is to the lungs, for breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.  Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way?  The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube. It has at its top a little trap-door. This opens when we breathe and shuts when we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage behind, which leads to the stomach.  If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door has to open, and some bit of food may slip in. The windpipe will not pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back. Then we say the food chokes us. If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the person will die.   HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.  But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid.  Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into the blood.  The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.  Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts that may be broken.  Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be mended?  If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave them a while, do you think they would grow together?  No, indeed!  But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it bone food every day, until it had grown together again.  So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. What shall we have for dinner?             2.

[Illustration: H]ERE are the names of some of the different kinds of food. If you write them on the blackboard or on your slates, it will help you to remember them.                    _Water._ _Salt._ _Lime._            Meat,  }                 Sugar,  }           Milk,  }                 Starch, }           Eggs,  }                 Fat,    } for fat and heat.           Wheat, } for muscles.    Cream,  }           Corn,  }                 Oil,    }           Oats,  }  Perhaps some of you noticed that we had no wine, beer, nor any drink that had alcohol in it, on our bill of fare for dinner. We had no cigars, either, to be smoked after dinner. If these are good things, we ought to have had them. Why did we leave them out?       _We should eat in order to grow strong and keep strong._   STRENGTH OF BODY.  If you wanted to measure your strength, one way of doing so would be to fasten a heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass the rope over a pulley. Then you might take hold at the other end of the rope and pull as hard and steadily as you could, marking the place to which you raised the weight. By trying this once a week, or once a month, you could tell by the marks, whether you were gaining strength.  But how can we gain strength?  We must exercise in the open air, and take pure air into our lungs to help purify our blood, and plenty of exercise to make our muscles grow.  We must eat good and simple food, that the blood may have supplies to take to every part of the body.   ALCOHOL AND STRENGTH.  People used to think that alcohol made them strong.  Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone, or nerve, or brain?  You have already answered \"No!\" to each of these questions.  If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor nerve, nor brain, it can not give you any strength.   BEER.  Some people may tell you that drinking beer will make you strong.  The grain from which the beer is made, would have given you strength. If you should measure your strength before and after drinking beer, you would find that you had not gained any. Most of the food part of the grain has been turned into alcohol.   CIDER.  The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider. As soon as the cider begins to turn sour, or \"hard,\" as people say, alcohol begins to form in it.  Pure water is good, and apples are good. But the apple-juice begins to be a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it. In cider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours after it is pressed out of the apples.  None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real strength.  Then why do people think they can?  Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the brain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted.  The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more than they really can. This false feeling of strength lasts only a little while. When it has passed, men feel weaker than before.  A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by the captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places.  Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was the custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum. This liquor is distilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol. This rum was given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great storm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give them twice as much rum as usual.  [Illustration]  The captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no stronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt weaker. So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship. Once out on the ocean, of course the men could not get any.  At first, they did"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],["title","Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#7)"],["body","like it; but the captain was very careful to have their food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet and cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink. By the time they had crossed the ocean, the men said: \"The captain is right. We have worked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum.\"   STRENGTH OF MIND.  We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind.  Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind.  Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy.  Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars?  If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. What things were left out of our bill of fare?             2. How could you measure your strength?             3. How can you gain strength?             4.

How does alcohol affect the strength of the                mind?     CHAPTER XIV.  THE HEART.   [Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for each of us.  It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger.   HOW THE HEART WORKS.  Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water through a hose upon a burning building.  As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. These tubes are called arteries (är´tĕr iz).  Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called veins (vānz). You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist.  If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the steady beating of the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart is pumping and the blood flowing.  The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right.  Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we eat and drink, to every part of the body.  To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every part.  So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part, just what it needs.   THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN.  As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food. It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.  We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood. If we take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain. There it affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions.   EXERCISE.  When you run, you can feel your heart beating. It gets an instant of rest between the beats.  Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the body better than a fire could do.   DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?  Your heart is made of muscle. You know what harm alcohol does to the muscles.  Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart? No more than a fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm. Besides, alcohol makes the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1. Where is the heart placed?             2. Of what is it made?             3.

How does exercise in the fresh air help the                heart?            10. What harm does alcohol do to the heart?     CHAPTER XV.  THE LUNGS.   [Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food to every part. It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter that can no longer be used. By the time it is ready to be sent back by the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red. It is dull and bluish in color, because it is full of impurities.  If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look blue.  If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to pump out bad blood next time? No, for the heart has neighbors very near at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again.   THE LUNGS.  These neighbors are the lungs. They are in the chest on each side of the heart. When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or expand, to take in the air. Then they contract again, and the air passes out through your mouth or nose. The lungs must have plenty of fresh air, and plenty of room to work in.  [Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._]  If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand, they can not take in so much air as they should. Then the blood can not be made pure, and the whole body will suffer.  For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one of impure air.  In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body again.  How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can not yet understand. By and by, when you are older, you will learn more about it.   CARE OF THE LUNGS.  Do the lungs ever rest?  You never stop breathing, not even in the night. But if you watch your own breathing you will notice a little pause between the breaths. Each pause is a rest. But the lungs are very steady workers, both by night and by day. The least we can do for them, is to give them fresh air and plenty of room to work in.  You may say: \"We can't give them more room than they have. They are shut up in our chests.\"  I have seen people who wore such tight clothes that their lungs did not have room to take a full breath. If any part of the lungs can not expand, it will become useless. If your lungs can not take in air enough to purify the blood, you can not be so well and strong as God intended, and your life will be shortened.  If some one was sewing for you, you would not think of shutting her up in a little place where she could not move her hands freely. The lungs are breathing for you, and need room enough to do their work.   THE AIR.  The lungs breathe out the waste matter that they have taken from the blood. This waste matter poisons the air. If we should close all the doors and windows, and the fireplace or opening into the chimney, and leave not even a crack by which the fresh air could come in, we would die simply from staying in such a room. The lungs could not do their work for the blood, and the blood could not do its work for the body.  Impure air-will poison you. You should not breathe it. If your head aches, and you feel dull and sleepy from being in a close room, a run in the fresh air will make you feel better.  The good, pure air makes your blood pure; and the blood then flows quickly through your whole body and refreshes every part.  We must be careful not to stay in close rooms in the day-time, nor sleep in close rooms at night. We must not keep out the fresh air that our bodies so much need.  It is better to breathe through the nose than through the mouth. You can soon learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth shut when walking or running.  If you keep the mouth shut and breathe through the nose, the little hairs on the inside of the nose will catch the dust or other impurities that are floating in the air, and so save their going to the lungs. You will get out of breath less quickly when running if you keep your mouth shut.   DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?  The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (mŭs´ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe.  All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves.  You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them?   REVIEW QUESTIONS.             1.
