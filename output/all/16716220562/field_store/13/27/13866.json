I'm going to waive the insult and give your request my earnest thought. If I can save the Union--that's the only question--that's the only question!                               RAYMOND  You will give us your answer to-day?                               LINCOLN      [_Firmly._]  No. I must have time to think. As I've listened to you, the conviction grows on me that the life of the Union _may_ be bound with mine now, and I'm not going to give up--_without a fight_.                               RAYMOND      [_Brusquely._]  We cannot leave Washington _without your answer_, Mr. President.                               LINCOLN  You'll get it in due time.                               RAYMOND  The time is short----                               LINCOLN  It may be long enough yet, to save the Nation----                               RAYMOND      [_Firmly._]  The Committee _must_ take definite action before we leave--we will give you ten days to decide----                               LINCOLN  I understand. Good day, gentlemen!                               ALL      [_Bowing out._]  Good day, Mr. President.      [LINCOLN _stands erect, with_ NICOLAY _watching them go in silence.     When the last man is gone, he turns to_ NICOLAY.]                               LINCOLN  It's infamous, John! Infamous!      [MRS. LINCOLN _enters hurriedly._]  Don't tell her the nasty things old Thad said to me. It will hurt her.                               NICOLAY  Of course not.                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Tensely._]  What is it, Father--what did they say?      [_He pauses and she presses him tremblingly._]  What did they say? What did they say?                               LINCOLN      [_With dreamy look._]  They told me in plain English that I am the most unpopular man in the United States--that my conduct of the war is a series of blunders, my administration a failure!                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Relieved._]  Oh!--is _that_ all!                               LINCOLN  What more----?                               MRS. LINCOLN  I thought they had something important to tell you----                               LINCOLN      [_Laughs._]  Oh!----                               MRS. LINCOLN  That is of no importance, because it's a lie----                               LINCOLN  But, if they believe it, and millions of people believe it----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Well, they won't. I've something important to ask of you--Betty Winter's in my room and wants to bring her lover here to see you alone for an hour to-night----                               LINCOLN  I'll see Miss Betty Winter any time--she is my good friend--make it nine o'clock.                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Going._]  At nine--don't forget now!                               LINCOLN  I'll not----      [MRS. LINCOLN _exits._]  John, is General McClellan at home?                               NICOLAY  I saw him to-day, sir.                               LINCOLN  Go to his house immediately and tell him I want to see him here at eight o'clock to-night. Say that it's a matter of the gravest importance--both to him and to the country--he can't refuse.                               NICOLAY  Yes, sir.                               LINCOLN  Say to General McClellan that I would come to him but for the fact that it would attract attention which I wish to avoid. It will be the best for both that this meeting should not be known. Ask him to come in a closed carriage. Assure him that you will meet him at the door and he will see no one but me----                               NICOLAY  You can't take me into your confidence, Chief?                               LINCOLN      [_Pauses._]  Partly--I'm going to put McClellan to the supreme test, John. If he will make me one pledge on the Copperhead issue which I will ask of him, I'll name for this Committee a candidate they're not looking for--I'll give them the surprise of their life--so help me God!                               NICOLAY  I don't think the General will give that pledge, sir.                               LINCOLN      [_Gazing upward and folding his arms._]  I wonder!--I wonder if he will!      [NICOLAY _exits._]  I wonder if he will----   CURTAIN     ACT II   SET SCENE: _The same as Act I at a quarter to eight the same evening_.  AT RISE: EDWARD, _the old Doorman, is straightening the furniture in the room. He clumsily clears the floor of a litter of letters and places them in the corner with the unopened bag.

LINCOLN _enters and watches him fix the draperies._                                MRS. LINCOLN      [_Speaking suddenly._]  Edward----!

LINCOLN.]  Just--er drawin'--er the curtains, Madam.                               MRS.

LINCOLN  Who told you to draw them?                               EDWARD  Colonel Nicolay!                               MRS. LINCOLN  Where is he?                               EDWARD  Down-stairs, on the door.                               MRS. LINCOLN  In your place?                               EDWARD  Yes'm----                               MRS. LINCOLN  While you're up here acting as house maid?                               EDWARD      [_Embarrassed._]  Well, so it seems, Madam----                               MRS.

LINCOLN      [_Sarcastically._]  And you haven't the slightest idea--I suppose?                               EDWARD  Not the slightest. My experience as Doorman of the White House has taught me that my first duty is to obey the orders of my Chief----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Mr. Lincoln asked you to remain on duty here to-night?                               EDWARD      [_Bows._]  Asked me as a particular personal favor to him, that I remain on duty until eight o'clock and dismiss all the other White House attendants----                               MRS. LINCOLN  The _guard_ has been dismissed!                               EDWARD  Yes, Madam, both of them--inside and out.                               MRS. LINCOLN  Ask Colonel Nicolay to come here----                               EDWARD      [_Hesitates._]  Yes'm----                               MRS.

LINCOLN _quickly examines the President's desk, looking for a     memorandum of his appointments--she finds a pad and reads._]                               MRS.

MRS. LINCOLN  Who has this mysterious appointment with the President at eight o'clock--the name is blank.                               NICOLAY  I am forbidden to discuss it with any one.                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Angrily._]  Indeed!                               NICOLAY  I am sorry.                               MRS. LINCOLN  Do you know who is coming?                               NICOLAY  Yes----                               MRS.

I have asked him to say nothing about this appointment.                               NICOLAY  You can trust him implicitly, sir----      [NICOLAY _exits._]                               MRS. LINCOLN  But, you can't trust your wife, to-night, it seems----                               LINCOLN      [_Whimsically._]  Well, you know you're a woman, Mother----                               MRS. LINCOLN      [_Angrily._]  Thank God----                               LINCOLN  Amen! So say I!                               MRS. LINCOLN  You're _afraid_ to tell me--who this man is----?                               LINCOLN  I may tell you to-morrow----                               MRS. LINCOLN  When--you've-made-some-fatal-blunder----                               LINCOLN  I'll make no mistake this time----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Then why are you afraid of my woman's intuition----                               LINCOLN      [_Smiling._]  I'm not afraid of your _intuition_, Mother----                               MRS. LINCOLN  Thank you.                               LINCOLN  I didn't say it!----      [_Laughs._]  --But you know you do _talk_ too much sometimes!                               MRS.

But he was not thinking of the garage; he could not, in fact, even have told you the color of its vivid tiling. No! He had far more important things to think of than that--disquieting things which worried him and made him very unhappy. For about the twentieth time he took from his pocket his school report and ran his eye down the column of figures written upon the white card. He did not read because the reading gave him pleasure. Neither was the bit of pasteboard white any more. Instead it was thumbed and worn at the corners until it had gradually assumed a dismal grayish hue--a color quite in harmony with Peter's own mood.  Peter really did not need to look at the report at all, for already he could close his eyes and see before him in glaring type:    Algebra        40   History        20   Latin          30   French         30   Drawing        25  What a horrible fascination there was in those marks! He found himself repeating them aloud to impress upon his mind the fact that they actually were true. But what was far more tragic than these testimonials of defeat was a foot-note written in red ink in the well-known hand of Mr. Christopher, the principal of the school. It read:  \"In consequence of Peter Coddington's poor scholarship and unsatisfactory deportment it is against the rules of the Milburn High School that he retain any position in school athletics until such time as both his studies and his conduct reach the standard required by the school authorities.\"  It was that single sentence that made Peter's face so grave. The marks alone were bad enough. He was heartily ashamed of them because he knew that if he had studied even a reasonable amount of time he could easily have passed in every subject. It was by no means difficult work for a boy of his ability. But to be put off the ball team! Why, it was on his pitching that the whole Milburn school was pinning its faith in the coming game against Leighton Academy. \"Peter will save the day!\" the fellows had declared. What would they say when they discovered that their hero was to be dropped from the team--that he had not passed one of the freshman examinations?  Half the pride and glory of the freshman class centered about Peter. Throughout the grammar school he had made a wonderful record in athletics; his unerring drop kick had won him fame at football long before he was out of the sixth grade, and he could pitch a ball with a speed and curve almost professional in its nicety. \"Wait until Peter Coddington gets into the high school!\" had been the cry. \"Milburn can then wipe up the ground with every school within reach.\" As Peter had never been much of a student the gate of this temple of learning had been difficult to reach; but at last the day came when he managed to squeak inside the coveted portals where all the honors promised him were at once laid at his feet. He became a member of the football eleven, pitcher on the freshman nine, president of his class. Friends swarmed about him, for he had a pleasant way of greeting everybody, he treated generously, and he had a winsome little chuckle that spread merriment wherever he went.  None of these qualities, however, helped his poor scholarship, which he jauntily excused by explaining to his father at the end of the first quarter that he had not really got into the game yet. In consequence Mr. Coddington listened and was patient. When the mid-year record dropped even lower Peter's argument was that it took time to adjust one's self to novel conditions. But as spring brought no improvement Mr. Coddington, a man of few words, remarked severely: \"I will give you one more chance, son.\"  The list of figures in Peter's hand were the fruit of that chance.  Peter had a wholesome awe of his father. He was not a man to be bamboozled. On the contrary Mr. Coddington was a keen, direct person who came straight to a point in a few terse sentences; predominant in his character was an unflinching sense of justice which was, however, fortunately tempered with enough kindness to make a misdoer mortified but never afraid in his presence. Peter admired his father tremendously and if for one reason more than another because he was so \"square.\" Never during all the span of the lad's fifteen years could he recall a single instance when Mr. Coddington had broken his word. It was this knowledge that made Peter so uncomfortable as he glanced once more at the bedraggled report card. What had his father meant by saying he would grant him one more chance?  The boy wished now that he had considered the matter in a more serious light. He had known all along that his marks were dropping behind, and every morning he had vaguely resolved to make a spurt that day so that when examination time came he might cross the tape neck and neck with if not in advance of the other fellows. The promised spurt, however, had not been made. Instead he had drifted along, studying only enough to keep his head above water and putting all his zeal into tennis or baseball until the present climax with its direful calamity had been reached.  Unquestionably it was perfectly fair that he should forfeit his place on the team. All the boys knew the rule of the school. But somehow it did not seem _real_. When a fellow could kick a goal and pitch a ball as he could something must surely intervene to prevent such a fate. Nothing dreadful had ever happened to Peter before. It was not likely, he argued optimistically, that it could happen now. Considerably cheered by this logic he slipped his grimy report into its still more grimy envelope and began to whistle. Buoyed up by comfortable reveries he whistled fully five minutes, when the tune came to an abrupt end. A step on the gravel had arrested it. Looking around Peter saw his father coming along the drive toward him.  \"Not at the game to-day, Peter?\" exclaimed the elder man in surprise.  \"No, sir.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"I did not feel like going, Father.\"  \"Not feel like going! Why, that's something new for you. You're not sick?\"  Peter was conscious of a swift scrutiny.  \"I'm worried about something,\" he blurted out.  \"I'm sorry to hear that, my boy. What is the trouble? Grass stains on your new white tennis flannels?\"  Peter shook his head in reply to the smiling question.  \"It is a real trouble this time,\" he answered.  Silently he drew from his pocket the crumpled envelope which he handed to his father. As Mr. Coddington took out the card and scanned it rapidly the quizzical expression that had lighted his face gave way to a frown of displeasure.  \"Well?\" he questioned.  \"I'm mighty sorry, Father,\" began Peter. \"You see I kept thinking I would make up my work before the exams came; but somehow I have been hustling more for the baseball championship than----\"  A curt question cut short further apologies:  \"Your studies have not been too difficult for you, then?\"  \"Oh, no. I can easily make them up with a tutor,\" was the eager response. \"I guess if you ask Mr. Christopher he will let me take the examinations over again before school closes and the next time----\"  \"There is to be no next time,\" put in his father quietly.  Peter stared.  \"Wh-a-t--do--you mean, sir?\"  \"You will see.\"  Without another word the older man turned away. Peter saw him walk to the garage, and a few moments later the motor-car shot past, spun down the drive, and the music of its siren horn announced that it was turning into the street. Where had his father gone so suddenly?  He had but just come home, and it was never his custom to dash off in such an abrupt fashion. It was easy to see that he was annoyed about the school report. That was not strange--of course he would be. Peter was"]]]
