Anyway, there was no trouble. Harry figured there wouldn't be, as long as he stayed in line and went through the proper motions. It was all a matter of pretending to conform, pretending to agree, pretending to believe.  So he watched his step--_except in the dreams, and then he was always falling into the yawning abyss_.  He kept his nose clean--_but in the dreams he smelled the blood and brimstone of the pit_.  He managed to retain a cheerful smile at all times--_though, in the dreams, he screamed_.  Eventually, he even met Myrna. She was the pretty little brunette whom Ritchie had mentioned, and she did her best to console him--_only in dreams, when he embraced her, he was embracing a writhing coil of slimy smoke_.  It may have been that Harry Collins went a little mad, just having to pretend that he was sane. But he learned the way, and he managed. He saved the madness (_or was it the reality?_) for the dreams.  Meanwhile he waited and said nothing.  He said nothing when, after three months or so, Myrna was suddenly \"transferred\" without warning.  He said nothing when, once a week or so, he went in to visit with Dr. Manschoff.  He said nothing when Manschoff volunteered the information that Ritchie had been \"transferred\" too, or suggested that it would be best to stay on for \"further therapy.\"  And he said nothing when still a third nurse came his way; a woman who was callid, complaisant, and nauseatingly nymphomaniac.  The important thing was to stay alive. Stay alive and try to learn.         *       *       *       *       *  It took him almost an additional year to find out what he wanted to find out. More than eight months passed before he found a way of sneaking out of his room at night, and a way of getting into that Third Unit through a delivery door which was occasionally left open through negligence.  Even then, all he learned was that the female patients did have their living quarters here, along with the members of the staff and--presumably--Dr. Leffingwell. Many of the women _were_ patients rather than nurses, as claimed, and a good number of them were in various stages of pregnancy, but this proved nothing.  Several times Harry debated the possibilities of taking some of the other men in his Unit into his confidence. Then he remembered what had happened to Arnold Ritchie and decided against this course. The risk was too great. He had to continue alone.  It wasn't until Harry managed to get into Unit Four that he got what he wanted (what he _didn't_ want) and learned that reality and dreams were one and the same.  There was the night, more than a year after he'd come to the treatment center, when he finally broke into the basement and found the incinerators. And the incinerators led to the operating and delivery chambers, and the delivery chambers led to the laboratory and the laboratory led to the incubators and the incubators led to the nightmare.  In the nightmare Harry found himself looking down at the mistakes and the failures and he recognized them for what they were, and he knew then why the incinerators were kept busy and why the black smoke poured.  In the nightmare he saw the special units containing those which were not mistakes or failures, and in a way they were worse than the others. They were red and wriggling there beneath the glass, and on the glass surfaces hung the charts which gave the data. Then Harry saw the names, saw his own name repeated twice--once for Sue, once for Myrna. And he realized that he had contributed to the successful outcome or issue of the experiments (_outcome? Issue? These horrors?_) and that was why Manschoff must have chosen to take the risk of keeping him alive. Because he was one of the _good_ guinea pigs, and he had spawned, spawned living, mewing abominations.  He had dreamed of these things, and now he saw that they were real, so that nightmare merged with _now_, and he could gaze down at it with open eyes and scream at last with open mouth.  Then, of course, an attendant came running (_although he seemed to be moving ever so slowly, because everything moves so slowly in a dream_) and Harry saw him coming and lifted a bell-glass and smashed it down over the man's head (_slowly, ever so slowly_) and then he heard the others coming and he climbed out of the window and ran.  The searchlights winked across the courtyards and the sirens vomited hysteria from metallic throats and the night was filled with shadows that pursued.  But Harry knew where to run. He ran straight through the nightmare, through all the fantastic but familiar convolutions of sight and sound, and then he came to the river and plunged in.  Now the nightmare was not sight or sound, but merely sensation. Icy cold and distilled darkness; ripples that ran, then raced and roiled and roared. But there had to be a way out of the nightmare and there had to be a way out of the canyon, and that way was the river.  Apparently no one else had thought of the river; perhaps they had considered it as a possible avenue of escape and then discarded the notion when they realized how it ripped and raged among the rocks as it finally plunged from the canyon's mouth. Obviously, no one could hope to combat that current and survive.  But strange things happen in nightmares. And you fight the numbness and the blackness and you claw and convulse and you twist and turn and toss and then you ride the crests of frenzy and plunge into the troughs of panic and despair and you sweep round and round and sink down into nothingness until you break through to the freedom which comes only with oblivion.  Somewhere beyond the canyon's moiling maw, Harry Collins found that freedom and that oblivion. He escaped from the nightmare, just as he escaped from the river.  The river itself roared on without him.  And the nightmare continued, too....     5. Minnie Schultz--2009   When Frank came home, Minnie met him at the door. She didn't say a word, just handed him the envelope containing the notice.  \"What's the matter?\" Frank asked, trying to take her in his arms. \"You been crying.\"  \"Never mind.\" Minnie freed herself. \"Just read what it says there.\"  Frank read slowly, determinedly, his features contorted in concentration. Vocational Apt had terminated his schooling at the old grade-school level, and while like all students he had been taught enough so that he could read the necessary advertising commercials, any printed message of this sort provided a definite challenge.  Halfway through the notice he started to scowl. \"What kind of monkey business is this?\"  \"No monkey business. It's the new law. Everybody that gets married in Angelisco takes the shots, from now on. Fella from State Hall, he told me when he delivered this.\"  \"We'll see about this,\" Frank muttered. \"No damn government's gonna tell me how to run my life. Sa free country, ain't so?\"  Minnie's mouth began to twitch. \"They're coming back tomorra morning, the fella said. To give me the first shots. Gee, honey, I'm scared, like. I don't want 'em.\"  \"That settles it,\" Frank said. \"We're getting out of this place, fast.\"  \"Where'd we go?\"  \"Dunno. Someplace. Texas, maybe. I was listening to the 'casts at work today. They don't have this law in Texas. Not yet, anyway. Come on, start packing.\"  \"Packing? But how'll we get there?\"  \"Fly. We'll jet right out.\"  \"You got prior'ty reservations or something?\"  \"No.\" The scowl returned to Frank's forehead. \"But maybe if I pitch 'em a sob story, tell 'em it's our honeymoon, you know, then we could--\"  Minnie shook her head. \"It won't work, honey. You know that. Takes six months to get a prior'ty clearance or whatever they call it. Besides, your job and all--what'll you do in Texas? They've got your number listed here. Why, we couldn't even _land_, like. I bet Texas is even more crowded than Angelisco these days, in the cities. And all the rest of it is Ag Culture project, isn't it?\"  Frank was leaning against the sink, listening. Now he took three steps forward and sat down on the bed. He didn't look at her as he spoke.  \"Well, we gotta do something,\" he said. \"You don't want those shots and that's for sure. Maybe I can have one of those other things instead, those whaddya-call-'ems.\"  \"You mean where they operate you, like?\"  \"That's right. A vas-something. You know, sterilize you. Then we won't have to worry.\"  Minnie took a deep breath. Then she sat down and put her arm around Frank.  \"But you wanted kids,\" she murmured. \"You told me, when we got married, you always wanted to have a son--\"  Frank pulled away.  \"Sure I do,\" he said. \"A son. That's what I want. A _real_ son. Not a freak. Not a damned little monster that has to go to the Clinic every month and take injections so it won't grow. And what happens to you if you take _your_ shots now? What if they drive you crazy or something?\"  Minnie put her arm around Frank again and made him look at her. \"That's not true,\" she told him. \"That's just a lot of Naturalist talk. I know.\"  \"Hell you do.\"  \"But I do, honey! Honest, like! May Stebbins, she took the shots last year, when they asked for volunteers. And she's all right. You seen her baby yourself, remember? It's the sweetest little thing, and awful smart! So maybe it wouldn't be so bad.\"  \"I'll ask about being operated tomorrow,\" Frank said. \"Forget it. It don't matter.\"  \"Of course it matters.\" Minnie looked straight at him. \"Don't you think I know what you been going through? Sweating it out on that job day after day, going nuts in the traffic, saving up the ration coupons so's we'd have extra food for the honeymoon and all?  \"You didn't have to marry me, you know that. It was just like we could have a place of our own together, and kids. Well, we're gonna have 'em, honey. I'll take the shots.\"  Frank shook his head but said nothing.  \"It won't be so bad,\" Minnie went on. \"The shots don't hurt at all, and they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25778"],["title","Polly's Business Venture (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

The report had gone out that they might expect to reach quarantine before five o'clock, but it would be too late to dock that night, therefore the captain had planned an evening's entertainment for all on board.  \"Miss Brewster! Miss Polly Brewster! Polly Brewster!\" came a call from one of the young boys of the crew who was acting as messenger for the wireless operator.  \"Polly, he is calling you! I wonder what it is?\" cried Eleanor Maynard, Polly's dearest friend.  \"Here, boy! I am Polly Brewster,\" called Polly, waving her hand to call his attention to herself.  \"Miss Polly Brewster?\" asked the uniformed attendant politely, lifting his cap.  \"Yes.\"  He handed her an envelope such as the wireless messages are delivered in, and bowed to take his leave of the group of girls. Polly gazed at the outside of the envelope but did not open it. Her friends laughed and Nancy Fabian, the oldest girl of the five, said teasingly:  \"Isn't it delicious to worry one's self over who could have sent us a welcome, when we _might_ know for certain, if we would but act prosaically and open the seal.\"  The girls laughed, and Eleanor remarked, knowingly: \"Oh, _Polly_ knows who it is from! She just wants to enjoy a few extra thrills before she reads the message.\"  \"Nolla, I do _not_ know, and you know it! You always make 'a mountain from a mole-hill.' I declare, you are actually growing to be childish in your old age!\" retorted Polly, sarcastically.  Her latter remark drew forth a peal of laughter from the girls, Eleanor included. But Polly failed to join in the laugh. She cast a withering glance at Eleanor, and walked aside to open the envelope. The four interested girls watched her eagerly as she read the short message.  Polly would have given half of her mine on Grizzly Slide, to have controlled her expression. But the very knowledge that the four friends were critically eyeing her, made her flush uncomfortably as she folded up the paper again, and slipped it in her pocket.  \"Ha! What did I tell you! It is from HIM!\" declared Eleanor, laughingly.  Dorothy Alexander was duly impressed, for she had firmly believed, hitherto, that Polly was a man-hater. The manner in which she had scorned Jimmy Osgood on that tour of England would have led anyone to believe that such was the case. Now the tell-tale blush and Eleanor's innuendo, caused Dorothy to reconsider her earlier judgment.  Polly curled her full red lip at Eleanor's remark, and was about to speak of something of general interest, when Dorothy unexpectedly asked a (to her) pertinent question.  \"Polly, has anyone ever proposed to you?\"  Eleanor laughed softly to herself, and Polly sent poor Dodo a pitying glance. \"Is that little head of yours entirely void of memory, Dodo?\" said she.  Then, without waiting for a reply, Polly continued: \"Did not Jimmy propose to me, as well as to every one of you girls?\"  \"Oh, but I didn't mean that sort of an affair,\" explained Dorothy. \"I mean--were you ever in love with anyone who thought he loved _you_?\"  \"Oh, isn't this a delightful conversation? I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world!\" laughed Eleanor.  \"Nolla,\" rebuked Polly, seriously, \"your head has been so turned since all those poor fortune-hunters in Europe flattered you, that I fear you will never succeed in business with me. I shall have to find someone else who will prove trustworthy and work.\"  Polly's threat did not appear to disturb Eleanor very much, for she laughed merrily and retorted: \"Dodo, if I answer your question for Polly, what will you do for me, some day?\"  \"Nolla, you mind your own affairs!\" exclaimed Polly, flushing again. \"Dodo is such a tactless child that she never stops to consider whether her questions are too personal, or not. But _you_--well, you know better, and I forbid you to discuss me any further.\"  \"Come, come, girls! This little joke is really going too far, if Polly feels hurt about it. Let us drop the subject and talk about the dance the Captain is going to give us tonight,\" suggested Nancy.  \"I'm going to wear the new gown mother got in Paris,\" announced Dorothy. \"Ma says we can save duty on it if I wear it before it reaches shore.\"  The other girls laughed, and Eleanor added: \"That's a good plan, Dodo. I guess I will follow your example. I've got so many dutiable things in my trunks, that I really ought to economise on something.\"  \"Well, I won't wear one of my new dresses tonight for just that reason. If I want them badly enough, to bring them all the way from Paris where we get them so much cheaper than on this side, then I'm willing to pay Uncle Sam his revenue on them,\" said Polly, loftily.  \"Ho! I don't believe it is duty you are saving, as much as indulging in perverseness by not donning one of your most fetching gowns,\" declared Eleanor.  \"Maybe it is,\" said Polly, smiling tantalizingly at her chum. \"Perhaps I want to keep the freshness of them for someone in New York, eh?\"  \"Certainly! _He_ will be there to meet you, sure thing!\" laughed Eleanor.  At that, Dorothy drew Eleanor aside and, when Polly was not looking, whispered eagerly: \"Do tell me who he is?\"  But Eleanor laughingly shook her head and whispered back: \"I dare not! That is Polly's secret!\"  But she did not add for Dorothy's edification, that try as she would, she (Eleanor) had never been able to make Polly confess whether she preferred one swain to another. As Eleanor considered this a weakness in her own powers of persuasion, she never allowed anyone to question her that far.  Had anyone of the four girls dreamed of who the sender of the wireless was, what a buzzing there would have been! Eleanor Maynard would have been so pleased at the possibility of a romance, that she would have acted even more tantalizing, in Polly's opinion, than she had been of late months.  Perhaps you are not as well acquainted with Polly and her friends, however, as I am, and it would be unkind to continue their experiences for your entertainment, until after you are duly informed of how Polly happened to leave her home in Oak Creek and also what had passed during the Summer in Europe.  Polly Brewster was born and reared on a Rocky Mountain ranch, in Colorado, and had until her fourteenth year, never been farther from her home than Oak Creek, which was the railroad station and post office of the many ranchers of that section.  Eleanor Maynard, the younger daughter of Mr. Maynard who was a prosperous banker of Chicago, accompanied her sister Barbara and Anne Stewart, the teacher, when they spent a summer on the ranch. Their thrilling adventures during the first half of that summer are told in the book called \"Polly of Pebbly Pit,\" the first volume of this series.  After the discovery of the gold mine on Grizzly Slide, and the subsequent troubles with the claim-jumpers, Polly and her friends sent for John Brewster who was engaged to Anne Stewart, and Tom Latimer, John's best friend, to leave their engineering work on some mines, for the time being, and hasten to Pebbly Pit to advise about the gold mine, and to take action to protect the girls. These experiences are told in the second volume of this series.  Success being assured in the mining plans of the gold vein on Grizzly Slide, and the valuable lava cliffs located on Pebbly Pit ranch also finding a market as brilliant gems for use in jewelry, Polly and Eleanor decided to accompany Anne Stewart to New York, where she was going to teach in an exclusive school for young ladies.  In the third book, Polly and Eleanor's adventures in New York are told. Their school experiences; the amateur theatricals at which Polly saved a girl from the fire, and thus found some splendid friends; and the new acquaintance, Ruth Ashby, who was the only child of the Ashbys. They also met Mr. Fabian in a most unusual manner, and through him, they became interested in Interior Decorating, to study it as a profession. When the school-year ended, all these friends invited the two girls to join their party that was planned to tour Europe and visit noted places where antiques are exhibited.  The following fourth book describes the amusing incidents of the three girls "]]]
