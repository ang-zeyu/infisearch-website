Now, with my little gun, I crawl     All in the dark along the wall,     And follow round the forest track     Away behind the sofa back.      There, in the night, where none can spy,     All in my hunter's camp I lie,     And play at books that I have read     Till it is time to go to bed.      These are the hills, these are the woods,     These are my starry solitudes;     And there the river by whose brink     The roaring lions come to drink.      I see the others far away     As if in firelit camp they lay,     And I, like to an Indian scout,     Around their party prowled about.      So, when my nurse comes in for me,     Home I return across the sea,     And go to bed with backward looks     At my dear land of Story-books.  [Illustration]     ARMIES IN THE FIRE       The lamps now glitter down the street;     Faintly sound the falling feet;     And the blue even slowly falls     About the garden trees and walls.      Now in the falling of the gloom     The red fire paints the empty room:     And warmly on the roof it looks,     And flickers on the backs of books.      Armies march by tower and spire     Of cities blazing, in the fire;--     Till as I gaze with staring eyes,     The armies fade, the lustre dies.      Then once again the glow returns;     Again the phantom city burns;     And down the red-hot valley, lo!     The phantom armies marching go!      Blinking embers, tell me true     Where are those armies marching to,     And what the burning city is     That crumbles in your furnaces!  [Illustration]     THE LITTLE LAND       When at home alone I sit,     And am very tired of it,     I have just to shut my eyes     To go sailing through the skies--     To go sailing far away     To the pleasant Land of Play;     To the fairy land afar     Where the Little People are;     Where the clover-tops are trees,     And the rain-pools are the seas,     And the leaves, like little ships,     Sail about on tiny trips;     And above the daisy tree       Through the grasses,     High o'erhead the Bumble Bee       Hums and passes.      In that forest to and fro     I can wander, I can go;     See the spider and the fly,     And the ants go marching by,     Carrying parcels with their feet     Down the green and grassy street.     I can in the sorrel sit     Where the ladybird alit.     I can climb the jointed grass       And on high     See the greater swallows pass       In the sky,     And the round sun rolling by     Heeding no such things as I.      Through that forest I can pass     Till, as in a looking-glass,     Humming fly and daisy tree     And my tiny self I see,     Painted very clear and neat     On the rain-pool at my feet.     Should a leaflet come to land     Drifting near to where I stand,     Straight I'll board that tiny boat     Round the rain-pool sea to float.      Little thoughtful creatures sit     On the grassy coasts of it;     Little things with lovely eyes     See me sailing with surprise.     Some are clad in armour green--     (These have sure to battle been!)--     Some are pied with ev'ry hue,     Black and crimson, gold and blue;     Some have wings and swift are gone;--     But they all look kindly on.      [Illustration: THE LITTLE LAND]        When my eyes I once again       Open, and see all things plain:     High bare walls, great bare floor;     Great big knobs on drawer and door;     Great big people perched on chairs,     Stitching tucks and mending tears,     Each a hill that I could climb,     And talking nonsense all the time--       O dear me,       That I could be     A sailor on the rain-pool sea,     A climber in the clover tree,     And just come back, a sleepy-head,     Late at night to go to bed.     GARDEN DAYS  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     NIGHT AND DAY       When the golden day is done,       Through the closing portal,     Child and garden, flower and sun,       Vanish all things mortal.      As the blinding shadows fall       As the rays diminish,     Under evening's cloak, they all       Roll away and vanish.      Garden darkened, daisy shut,       Child in bed, they slumber--     Glow-worm in the highway rut,       Mice among the lumber.      In the darkness houses shine,       Parents move with candles;     Till on all, the night divine       Turns the bedroom handles.      Till at last the day begins       In the east a-breaking,     In the hedges and the whins       Sleeping birds a-waking.      In the darkness shapes of things,       Houses, trees and hedges,     Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings       Beat on window ledges.      These shall wake the yawning maid;       She the door shall open--     Finding dew on garden glade       And the morning broken.      There my garden grows again       Green and rosy painted,     As at eve behind the pane       From my eyes it fainted.      Just as it was shut away,       Toy-like, in the even,     Here I see it glow with day       Under glowing heaven.      Every path and every plot,       Every bush of roses,     Every blue forget-me-not       Where the dew reposes.      \"Up!\" they cry, \"the day is come       On the smiling valleys:     We have beat the morning drum;       Playmate, join your allies!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     NEST EGGS       Birds all the sunny day       Flutter and quarrel     Here in the arbour-like       Tent of the laurel.      Here in the fork       The brown nest is seated;     Four little blue eggs       The mother keeps heated.      While we stand watching her       Staring like gabies,     Safe in each egg are the       Bird's little babies.      Soon the frail eggs they shall       Chip, and upspringing     Make all the April woods       Merry with singing.      Younger than we are,       O children, and frailer,     Soon in blue air they'll be,       Singer and sailor.      We, so much older,       Taller and stronger,     We shall look down on the       Birdies no longer.      They shall go flying       With musical speeches     High over head in the       Tops of the beeches.      In spite of our wisdom       And sensible talking,     We on our feet must go       Plodding and walking.  [Illustration]     THE FLOWERS       All the names I know from nurse:     Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,     Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,     And the Lady Hollyhock.      Fairy places, fairy things,     Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,     Tiny trees for tiny dames--     These must all be fairy names!      Tiny woods below whose boughs     Shady fairies weave a house;     Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,     Where the braver fairies climb!  [Illustration: THE FLOWERS]      Fair are grown-up people's trees,     But the fairest woods are these;     Where, if I were not so tall,     I should live for good and all.     SUMMER SUN       Great is the sun, and wide he goes     Through empty heaven without repose;     And in the blue and glowing days     More thick than rain he showers his rays.      Though closer still the blinds we pull     To keep the shady parlour cool,     Yet he will find a chink or two     To slip his golden fingers through.      The dusty attic spider-clad     He, through the keyhole, maketh glad;     And through the broken edge of tiles     Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.      Meantime his golden face around     He bares to all the garden ground,     And sheds a warm and glittering look     Among the ivy's inmost nook.      Above the hills, along the blue,     Round the bright air with footing true,     To please the child, to paint the rose,     The gardener of the World, he goes.  [Illustration]     THE DUMB SOLDIER       When the grass was closely mown,     Walking on the lawn alone,     In the turf a hole I found,     And hid a soldier underground.      Spring and daisies came apace;     Grasses hide my hiding place;     Grasses run like a green sea     O'er the lawn up to my knee.      Under grass alone he lies,     Looking up with leaden eyes,     Scarlet coat and pointed gun,     To the stars and to the sun.      When the grass is ripe like grain,     When the scythe is stoned again,     When the lawn is shaven clear,     Then my hole shall reappear.      I shall find him, never fear,     I shall find my grenadier;     But for all that's gone and come,     I shall find my soldier dumb.      He has lived, a little thing,     In the grassy woods of spring;     Done, if he could tell me true,     Just as I should like to do.      He has seen the starry hours     And the springing of the flowers;     And the fairy things that pass     In the forests of the grass.      In the silence he has heard     Talking bee and ladybird,     And the butterfly has flown     O'er him as he lay alone.      Not a word will he disclose,     Not a word of all he knows.     I must lay him on the shelf,     And make up the tale myself.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     AUTUMN FIRES       In the other gardens       And all up the vale,     From the autumn bonfires       See the smoke trail!      Pleasant summer over       And all the summer flowers,     The red fire blazes,       The grey smoke towers.      Sing a song of seasons!       Something bright in all!     Flowers in the summer,       Fires in the fall!  [Illustration]     THE GARDENER       The gardener does not love to talk,     He makes me keep the gravel walk;     And when he puts his tools away,     He locks the door and takes the key.      Away behind the currant row,     Where no one else but cook may go,     Far in the plots, I see him dig,     Old and serious, brown and big.      He digs the flowers, green, red, and blue,     Nor wishes to be spoken to.     He digs the flowers and cuts the hay,     And never seems to want to play.      Silly gardener! summer goes,     And winter comes with pinching toes,     When in the garden bare and brown     You must lay your barrow down.      Well now,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25609"],["title","A Child's Garden of Verses (#5)"],["body"," while the summer stays,     To profit by these garden days     O how much wiser you would be     To play at Indian wars with me!  [Illustration]     HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS       Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground     That now you smoke your pipe around.     Has seen immortal actions done     And valiant battles lost and won.      Here we had best on tip-toe tread,     While I for safety march ahead,     For this is that enchanted ground     Where all who loiter slumber sound.      Here is the sea, here is the sand,     Here is simple Shepherd's Land,     Here are the fairy hollyhocks,     And there are Ali Baba's rocks.      But yonder, see! apart and high,     Frozen Siberia lies; where I,     With Robert Bruce and William Tell,     Was bound by an enchanter's spell.     ENVOYS  [Illustration]     TO WILLIE AND HENRIETTA           If two may read aright         These rhymes of old delight         And house and garden play,     You too, my cousins, and you only, may.          You in a garden green         With me were king and queen,         Were hunter, soldier, tar,     And all the thousand things that children are.          Now in the elders' seat         We rest with quiet feet,         And from the window-bay     We watch the children, our successors, play.          \"Time was,\" the golden head         Irrevocably said;         But time which none can bind,     While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.  [Illustration]     TO MY MOTHER       You too, my mother, read my rhymes     For love of unforgotten times,     And you may chance to hear once more     The little feet along the floor.  [Illustration]     TO AUNTIE       _Chief of our aunts_--not only I,     But all your dozen of nurselings cry--     _What did the other children do?_     _And what were childhood, wanting you?_  [Illustration]  [Illustration: TO AUNTIE]  [Illustration]     TO MINNIE       The red room with the giant bed     Where none but elders laid their head;     The little room where you and I     Did for awhile together lie     And, simple suitor, I your hand     In decent marriage did demand;     The great day nursery, best of all,     With pictures pasted on the wall     And leaves upon the blind     A pleasant room wherein to wake     And hear the leafy garden shake     And rustle in the wind--     And pleasant there to lie in bed     And see the pictures overhead--     The wars about Sebastopol,     The grinning guns along the wall,     The daring escalade,     The plunging ships, the bleating sheep,     The happy children ankle-deep     And laughing as they wade;     All these are vanished clean away,     And the old manse is changed to-day;     It wears an altered face     And shields a stranger race.     The river, on from mill to mill,     Flows past our childhood's garden still;     But ah! we children never more     Shall watch it from the water-door.     Below the yew--it still is there--     Our phantom voices haunt the air     As we were still at play,     And I can hear them call and say:     \"_How far is it to Babylon?_\"      Ah, far enough, my dear,     Far, far enough from here--     Yet you have farther gone!     \"_Can I get there by candlelight?_\"     So goes the old refrain.     I do not know--perchance you might--     But only, children, hear it right,     Ah, never to return again!     The eternal dawn, beyond a doubt,     Shall break on hill and plain,     And put all stars and candles out     Ere we be young again.      To you in distant India, these     I send across the seas,     Nor count it far across.     For which of us forgets     The Indian cabinets,     The bones of antelope, the wings of albatross,     The pied and painted birds and beans,     The junks and bangles, beads and screens,     The gods and sacred bells,     And the loud-humming, twisting shells!     The level of the parlour floor     Was honest, homely, Scottish shore;     But when we climbed upon a chair,     Behold the gorgeous East was there!     Be this a fable; and behold     Me in the parlour as of old,     And Minnie just above me set     In the quaint Indian cabinet!     Smiling and kind, you grace a shelf     Too high for me to reach myself.     Reach down a hand, my dear, and take     These rhymes for old acquaintance' sake!  [Illustration]     TO MY NAME-CHILD                                    1      Some day soon this rhyming volume, if you learn with proper speed,     Little Louis Sanchez, will be given you to read.     Then shall you discover, that your name was printed down     By the English printers, long before, in London town.      In the great and busy city where the East and West are met,     All the little letters did the English printer set;     While you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play,     Foreign people thought of you in places far away.      Ay, and while you slept, a baby, over all the English lands     Other little children took the volume in their hands;     Other children questioned, in their homes across the seas:     Who was little Louis, won't you tell us, mother, please?                                    2      Now that you have spelt your lesson, lay it down and go and play,     Seeking shells and seaweed on the sands of Monterey,     Watching all the mighty whalebones, lying buried by the breeze,     Tiny sandpipers, and the huge Pacific seas.      And remember in your playing, as the sea-fog rolls to you,     Long ere you could read it, how I told you what to do;     And that while you thought of no one, nearly half the world away     Some one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     TO ANY READER       As from the house your mother sees     You playing round the garden trees,     So you may see, if you will look     Through the windows of this book,     Another child, far, far away,     And in another garden, play.     But do not think you can at all,     By knocking on the window, call     That child to hear you. He intent     Is all on his play-business bent.     He does not hear; he will not look,     Nor yet be lured out of this book.     For, long ago, the truth to say,     He has grown up and gone away,     And it is but a child of air     That lingers in the garden there.

There, then, awhile in chains we lay,     In wintry dungeons, far from day;     But ris'n at length, with might and main,     Our iron fetters burst in twain.      Then all the horns were blown in town;     And to the ramparts clanging down,     All the giants leaped to horse     And charged behind us through the gorse.      On we rode, the others and I,     Over the mountains blue, and by     The Silver River, the sounding sea,     And the robber woods of Tartary.      A thousand miles we galloped fast,     And down the witches' lane we passed,     And rode amain, with brandished sword,     Up to the middle, through the ford.      Last we drew rein--a weary three--     Upon the lawn, in time for tea,     And from our steeds alighted down     Before the gates of Babylon."]]]
