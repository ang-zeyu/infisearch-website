Cushing, of the Navy. The great mailed monster that has so long     excited the apprehensions of the Navy Department, and held in the     Sound a force greatly in excess of that which was usually stationed     there, now lies quietly at the bottom of the Roanoke river, a     subject of curious contemplation and dread to the fish that     frequent these waters. In the squadron every one feels a sense of     relief in realizing the fact that the Albemarle is no longer     afloat, or capable of doing further damage; for it is no secret     that she was one of the toughest customers for wooden vessels to     confront that has yet floated. Her raid on the flotilla, on the 5th     of last May, proved that fact beyond a shadow of a doubt. She then     encountered and fought to great advantage three heavily armed     double-enders--the Sassacus, Mattabessett and Wyalusing--and     retired, after a long contest, but slightly damaged. While she     floated, no post held by us and accessible to her was safe. She     could go her way as she chose, in spite of the efforts of our     wooden vessels, unless some accident occurred to her which should     prevent her steaming. None of the light-draft monitors were ready     to confront her, and she threatened to clear our forces out of the     State of North Carolina.      \"Such was the state of affairs subsequent to the 5th of May. Our     squadron in Albemarle Sound had been largely increased by the     addition of several light draught, heavily-armed vessels; but, even     with these, it was somewhat doubtful whether the possession of the     Sound was insured us; so it was determined to get rid of the     monster in some more expeditious and certain way.      \"Lieutenant William B. Cushing, a young officer of great bravery,     coolness and resource, submitted a project to Admiral Lee, in June     last, by which he hoped, if successfully carried out, to rid the     Sound of the Albemarle, and insure us its possession. Admiral Lee     entered warmly into the scheme, as did the Navy Department, which     immediately detached Lieutenant Cushing from the Monticello, and     placed him on special duty, at the same time giving him every     facility to carry out the object in view.      \"Lieutenant Cushing at once proceeded to New York, and in     conjunction with Admiral Gregory, Captain Boggs, and Chief Engineer     Wm. W. W. Wood, fitted one of the new steam picket boats, which is     about the size of a frigate launch, with a torpedo arrangement, and     then took her down into the Sound for duty. Having made several     reconnoissances up the Roanoke river, which gave him some valuable     information, and having perfected his arrangements, on the night of     the 27th ultimo he got under way from the squadron off the mouth of     the river, and steamed boldly up stream. In the steam launch were     Lieutenant Cushing, Paymaster T. H. Swann, a volunteer from the     Otsego, Master's Mate W. L. Howorth, of the gunboat Monticello, and     Third Assistant Engineer Stolsbury, in charge of the engine, with a     crew of ten men, nearly all of whom volunteered for the service. An     armed cutter of the Shamrock, with an officer and ten men, was     towed along for the purpose of attending to some of the minor     details of the work. It was known that the enemy had pickets along     the river banks, and on the wreck of the gunboat Southfield sunk by     the Albemarle last spring, and which lay about a mile below the     town of Plymouth. The pickets, who were in the habit of stationing     themselves on the hurricane deck of the Southfield--the only     portion of the wreck above water--were to be turned over to the     care of the Shamrock's cutter when the proper time came, whilst     those along the river were to be passed in silence, and without     giving alarm, if possible.      \"At about midnight the little picket-boat entered the narrow river,     and steamed silently and cautiously up without giving the least     alarm. The Southfield and three schooners alongside of her, engaged     in raising her up, were passed at a short distance--almost within     biscuit-toss--without challenge or hail. It was not till Lieutenant     Cushing reached within pistol-shot of the Albemarle, which lay     alongside of the dock at Plymouth, that he was hailed, and then in     an uncertain sort of way, as though the lookouts doubted the     accuracy of their vision. He made no reply, but continued to press     towards the rebel monster, and was for the second time hailed. He     paid no attention to the challenge, but kept straight on his way,     first detaching the Shamrock's cutter, to go below and secure the     rebel pickets on the Southfield.      \"In another instant, as he closed in on the ram Albemarle, the     rebel Captain Walley, in a very dignified, pompous, studied manner,     shouted, 'What boat is that?'  The reply was an invitation for him     to go to ----!  Thereupon arose a terrible clamor. The rattle was     vigorously sprung, the bells on the ship were sharply rung, and     hands were called to quarters, evidently in great consternation and     some confusion. A musketry fire was immediately opened on the     torpedo-boat, and a charge of canister was fired, injuring some of     the crew. Along the dock to which the Albemarle was tied, were a     large number of soldiers, evidently stationed there to guard     against a landing of our force after a surprise; and in front of     their lines blazed cheerily up a number of their camp fires, which     threw a strong light on the rebel vessel and the bosom of the     river. By the aid of this glare Lieutenant Cushing discovered the     raft of floating timbers which surrounded the ram on the accessible     sides, to guard against the approach of rams and torpedoes; and by     the aid of the same light he plainly saw the large body of soldiers     thronging to the wharf and blazing away at his boat. To quiet these     fellows, he brought the bow of his boat around a little, and     discharged a heavy stand of canister into them from his     twelve-pounder howitzer mounted at the bow, and sent them flying.     Making a complete circle under a scorching musketry fire, at less     than thirty yards, he came around, bow on, at full steam, and     struck the floating guard of timbers, pressing them towards the     hull of the ram. His boat soon lost headway, and came to a     standstill, refusing to back off or move ahead. The moment for     decisive action had now arrived. The enemy fired muskets and     pistols almost in his face, from the ports of the ram, and from the     hundred small arms on shore. Several of his men were injured, and     Paymaster Swann had fallen severely wounded. The officers and crew     of the Albemarle cried out: 'Now we've got him! Surrender!     surrender! or we will blow you to pieces!' The case looked     desperate, indeed; but Lieutenant Cushing was as cool and     determined at that moment as one could be under the most agreeable     circumstances. He knew that the decisive moment had come, and he     did not allow it to glide from his hands. He seized the lanyard to     the torpedo and the line of the spar, and crowding the spar until     he brought the torpedo under the over-hang of the Albemarle, he     detached it by one effort, and the next second he pulled the     lanyard of the torpedo, and exploded it under the vessel on her     port side, just below the port-hole of the two-hundred-pounder     Brooke's rifle, which at that moment was discharged at the boat. An     immense volume of water was thrown out by the explosion of the     torpedo, almost drowning all in the steam-launch; and to add to the     peril of the moment, the heavy shell from the enemy's gun had gone     through the bottom of the boat, knocking the splinters about in a     terrible style. She at once began to sink in the most rapid manner,     and Lieutenant Cushing ordered all hands to save themselves as best     they might. He divested himself of his coat and shoes, and plunged     into the river, followed by those of his men who were able to do     so. All struck for the middle of the river under a hot fire of     musketry, the balls perforating their clothing and striking all     about them, and in two or three instances, it is feared, so badly     wounding the swimmers that they sunk before boats from shore could     reach them. Lieutenant Cushing heard the rebels take to boats and     push after the survivors, demanding their surrender. Many gave up,     but two of his seamen were drowned near by him--whether from wounds     received or exhaustion, he could not state. Paymaster Swann was     wounded and is a prisoner; but how many others fell into the rebel     hands has not as yet been ascertained. Lieutenant Cushing swam down     the river half a mile, until, exhausted and chilled by the cold     water, he was compelled to struggle to the shore, which he reached     about daybreak. After lying in the weeds along the river bank for     some time, he recovered his strength sufficiently to crawl into the     swamp further, till daylight found him lying in the swamp grass,     between two paths, and in speaking distance of the enemy's fort.     While lying there but partially screened by the low sedge, he saw     rebel officers and men walk by, and heard their conversation, which     was entirely devoted to the affair of the morning. From their     remarks he learned that the torpedo had done its work effectively     and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25764"],["title","Reminiscences of Two Years in the United States Navy (#8)"],["body","y, and that his great object was accomplished. He did     not learn any of the details of the sinking, but heard it stated     that the ram had gone down by her dock, and was a complete loss. He     also learned of the capture of the paymaster and some others of his     crew from the same source.      \"Finding that there was great danger of his detection if he     remained in his exposed position all day, lying within a few yards     of two frequented paths, and so near the river, he began to move     slowly away towards the swamp. He was obliged to move cautiously,     so he lay on his back, and by pushing his heels into the ground, he     slowly pushed himself along, and after a long and exhausting     effort, passed over the sixty yards of ground that lay between him     and better cover. Once concealed, he laid up for the day and rested     himself. He was fortunate enough before midnight to get hold of a     negro, whom he sent into town to learn the extent of his success.     The negro obeyed his instructions, and reported that the Albemarle     was out of sight--'clar gone sunk.'      \"At night, Lieutenant Cushing struck through the swamp, and after     the greatest and most exhausting toil and pain--as he was in his     stocking-feet, and continually plunging over roots, briers, logs,     oyster-shells, and lacerating his flesh severely--he reached a     point four miles below the town, where he discovered a skiff used     by a picket. Watching his chance, he seized this, and, with a     single paddle, paddled off to the squadron, four miles distant,     which he reached in safety. Only one besides himself--William     Holton, a sailor on the Chicopee, who had volunteered on the     occasion--returned to the squadron. He was picked up by the Valley     City, the following day, nearly exhausted.      \"Lieutenant Cushing immediately came here on the special     despatch-boat Valley City, and reported to Admiral D. D. Porter.     To-night he will go to Washington and report to the Department. He     is worn out and in need of rest, which we hope he will be permitted     to enjoy.      \"This last brave and gallant action of his is likely to gain him an     advance of one grade in his rank, and it will also, if the law is     rightly construed, be a great financial success, which is somewhat     more substantial. His share of the prize-money from the Albemarle,     if she is fairly placed at a valuation, would be in the     neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars, an acceptable sum to any     one. Lieutenant Cushing has been ordered to the command of the     gun-boat Monticello, which will await him until his return from a     short leave.      \"The destruction of the Albemarle will release the large squadron     of powerful light-draught vessels which have, since her _debut_     last May, been maintained in the Sound. They can go elsewhere now.      \"On a reconnoissance by the Valley City, to within a mile of     Plymouth, it was discovered that the enemy had sunk the schooners     which were engaged in attempting to raise the Southfield, directly     across the channel, thus temporarily blockading the river. Although     the town was in sight, not a trace could be seen of the rebel ram;     and it is proved in other ways, beyond a doubt, that she lies in     thirty feet of water, from which it will be impossible to raise her     again.      \"Captain Walley, who had assumed command of the ship only three     weeks ago--relieving Captain Cook, who commanded her in the action     of May last--began his duties in a very bombastic style. He     mustered his officers and men, and assured them that in three weeks     he could again attack the enemy and sink and scatter his fleet, and     then he would re-take Newbern and drive the Yankees from every foot     of North Carolina soil. With the Albemarle and their aid, with the     co-operation of the gallant army, he would, before the new year,     regenerate the state, and leave not a trace of a Yankee within its     borders.      \"It is not improbable that he might have effected a good deal of     damage, and perhaps have endangered for the time being our tenure     of Newbern and Roanoke Island, as he was nearly ready for his raid.     Thanks, however, to the gallant Cushing and his brave comrades,     through whose coolness, courage, and skill the _coup de main_ was     so admirably administered to the mailed monster, all danger has     passed, and another destructive blow has been given to the     declining rebel navy.      \"A meed of credit and praise should be awarded to Chief Engineer     William W. W. Wood, of the navy, to whose inventive abilities and     experience in submarine warfare we owe the contrivance of the     torpedo and the successful arrangement by which it is handled and     exploded. The one fired by Lieutenant Cushing contained but fifty     pounds of powder; but it did its work to a charm. There was no     chance of its failing in his hands. The entire arrangement is     exceedingly ingenious, and it would be manifestly improper to     describe at this time.      \"The cutters of the Shamrock, we omitted to mention, captured four     rebel soldiers on picket on the Southfield, and brought them along     safely to the squadron.       \"THE ALBEMARLE.      \"The Albemarle was an iron-clad vessel, similar in general features     to the Merrimac and Tennessee, but much stronger. It is said her     iron mail was twelve inches in thickness, and backed by several     feet of solid timber. She was armed with two two-hundred pound     Brooke's rifles, and was perfectly shot-proof. Her weak point     proved to be below. She could have been captured only by ramming,     and for that purpose much heavier vessels were needed than any that     could be got into the Sound. The torpedo was the only means of     destroying her, and that proved successful when tried.      \"The Albemarle is probably the last formidable vessel that the     rebels have in the inland waters of North Carolina, and they will     hardly have an opportunity of building more.\"       \"THE HERO OF THE ALBEMARLE IN WASHINGTON.      \"WASHINGTON, NOV. 2, 1864.      \"Lieutenant Cushing arrived here to-day, bringing with him the     official report of the particulars attending his destruction of the     rebel ram Albemarle. This act relieves all the sounds of North     Carolina from floating enemies, and thus leaves them free to the     operations of our fleet. Lieutenant Cushing is a citizen of, and     was appointed from, the State of New York. He is satisfied that a     large number of lives must have been lost by the blowing up, as the     Albemarle's guns were all manned. The Secretary of the Navy will     recommend to Congress a vote of thanks, and he will be promoted to     a Lieutenant Commander.\"  After landing Captain Wm. B. Cushing aboard the flag-ship of the fleet, the Valley City the same day, at 2-1/4 p.m., weighed anchor, and proceeded to Norfolk, Va., and from thence to the United States Navy Yard at Gosport, Va., and was put there on the dry dock for repairs. After the repairs of the Valley City were finished, on Sunday, November 27, at 4-1/2 p.m., we got under weigh, and arrived at Hampton Roads, Va., at 6-1/2 o'clock p.m. On Monday, November 28th, at 11-1/2 o'clock, a.m., we weighed anchor, and arrived at Hatteras Inlet at 9-1/2 o'clock a.m., Tuesday, November 29. At 2 o'clock a.m., on Wednesday, November 30, the Valley City arrived at Plymouth, and at 3-1/2 o'clock of the same morning the Valley City was ordered to Newbern: we weighed anchor and proceeded towards Newbern. We arrived at Roanoke Island at 11-1/2 o'clock a.m. Our orders were then countermanded, and at 2 p.m. the Valley City steamed towards Plymouth, where we arrived at 10. p.m.  During the month of November, 1864, whilst the Valley City was absent at Norfolk, the remainder of the fleet, commanded by Commander Wm. H. Macomb, steamed up the Roanoke river, then across through Middle river, and then up the Cashie river to Roanoke river, down which it steamed and made an attack on Plymouth, which, after a hot action, fell into the hands of the Federals. The ram Albemarle was soon afterwards raised by the United States government.  On Thursday, December 1, I went ashore at Plymouth, and observed the ram Albemarle as she lay at the bottom of the river. At 12:15 p.m., we left Plymouth, and arrived at off Edenton at 2 p.m., and at 4 p.m., the Valley City weighed anchor for Roanoke Island, where we arrived at 8 o'clock, a.m., December 2, and at 9-1/2 o'clock p.m. the Valley City left Roanoke Island, arrived at Newbern at 1 o'clock p.m., Saturday, December 3d; Sunday, December 4, I attended church at Newbern.  Monday, December 5, I visited the graves of Captain Charles W. Flusser and Acting Assistant-Surgeon George W. Wilson. The latter died after two hours' sickness, of yellow fever. He was stationed, at the time, on the United States steamer Hetzel, off Newbern, and was the surgeon of that vessel when he contracted the disease. He was a young man, and was expecting soon to return North and visit his aged parents, and also a betrothed young lady. They waited, but he never came.  On Tuesday, December 6th, at 4 o'clock p.m., we left Newbern, with Commander W. H. Macomb and his son on board, and on Wednesday, December 7, at 8-1/2 o'clock a.m., we arrived off Roanoke Island. The Valley City left Roanoke Island at 12 o'clock m., and arrived at Plymouth at 10 p.m. On Thursday, December 8, at 12-1/2 o'clock p.m., we left Plymouth and arrived at Edenton at 2-1/2 o'clock p.m. We left Edenton at 8 o'clock p.m., and anchored at 10 o'clock p.m., at the mouth of the Roanoke river, where the U.S. steamer Ceres and a schooner were anchored. On Friday, December 9, at 9 o'clock a.m., the Valley City weighed anchor and proceeded to Plymouth, where she arrived at 10 o'clock a.m.   RAINBOW BLUFF.  HOW A FLEET WENT UP THE ROANOKE AND"]]]
