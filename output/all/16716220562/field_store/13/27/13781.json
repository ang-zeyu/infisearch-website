In places the legs and arms protruded, brushing us as we passed. However, this was war and quite ethical.  Naturally we had to crowd by the other occupants of the trench. And each took a poke at us as we went by, some with their bayonets, saying: \"Verdamnt Engländer\" and: \"Engländer Schwein,\"--pigs of English. Also quite a number of them spoke English after a fashion. There was in these men none of the soldier's usual tolerance or good-natured pity for an enemy who had fought well and had then succumbed to the fortunes of war. Instead, a blind and vicious rage which took no account of our helpless condition.  They cuffed us, they buffeted us, they pricked us cruelly with their saw bayonets and then laughed and sneered as we flinched and dodged awkwardly aside. Then they cursed us.  Shortly, we were led into the presence of a man whom I shall remember if I live to be a hundred. He wore glasses and on his upper lip there bloomed such a dainty moustache as is affected by \"Little Willie\" as Tommy calls the German Crown Prince. He had the eye of a rat. It snapped so cruel a hate that one's blood stopped.  He seized me by the right shoulder with his left hand: \"You Corporal! You Corporal!\" as though that fact of itself condemned me, and at the same time tugging at his holster until he found his revolver, which he placed against my temple. Then and there I fervently prayed that he would pull the trigger and end it all. I was fed up. The all-day bombardment, the last terrible slaughter of helpless men, the rain and cold, combining with the pain of the raw wound in my side, had gotten on my nerves. With the revolver still at my head I turned to Scarfe: \"They're going to do us in, Charlie. I only hope they'll do it proper. None of that bayonet stuff. Bullets for me.\" Already the Prussians were crowding round us threateningly again, with their saw-edged bayonets ready, some fixed in the rifle, others clasped short, like daggers, for such a butchering as they had had earlier in the afternoon, when I had been so nearly axed.  \"Might as well kill us outright as scare us to death,\" complained Scarfe bitterly.  Nevertheless our hearts leaped when a moment later our mysterious black officer friend hove in sight. Life is sweet.  He asked them what they did with us. The tableau answered for itself before the words had left his lips. And then we had to listen to our fate discussed in language and gesture so eloquent and so fraught with terrible importance to us that our sensitized minds could miss no smallest point of each fine shade of cruel meaning.  \"Little Willie\" thought it scarce worth their while to bother with so small a bag; that it would not be worth the trouble to send a miserable ten of _Verdamnt Engländer_ back to the Fatherland--Better to kill them like the swine they were.  Our blood froze to hear the man and to see the poison of that rat soul of his exuding from his every pore, in every gesture and in each fresh inflection of his rasping voice. And all his men shouted their fierce approval and shook in our faces their bloody butcher's bayonets. It was a bitter draught. If they had killed us then it would have had to have been done in most cold blood, exceeding even the murder of Taylor in planned brutality. He at least had not known that it was coming and had not felt this insane fear which we now experienced and which made us wonder how they would do it. Would each have to watch the other's end? And would it be done by bullet or by bayonet? We greatly feared it would be the latter. We pictured ourselves held down as hogs are--our throats slit----!  The dark officer thought otherwise and minced no words in the saying. Our hearts leapt out to him warmly, in gratitude.  He sharply ordered them to desist, at which they slunk sullenly away, as hungry dogs do from a bone.  I felt an uncomfortable physical sensation and ran my hand uneasily beneath my shirt. I was covered with a fine sweat.     CHAPTER VII  PULLING THE LEG OF A GERMAN GENERAL    Polygon Wood and Picadilly Again--German Headquarters--Surprising   Kitchener--\"Your Infantry's No Good\"--The Germans Give Us News of   the Regiment.   We were then escorted under heavy guard out over the fields in the rear, past the nearby farmhouse, which was simply filled with snipers. The latter, however, did not shoot at us, presumably because they might have hit some of our numerous guards. We seemed to be working right through the heart of the German Army. Everywhere the troops were massed. Along the road they lay in solid formation on both sides. If we had had artillery to play on them now they would have suffered tremendous losses. The whole countryside presented a living target. All the way they shouted \"Schwein\" and taunted us in both languages. Every shell-hole, farmhouse, hut, dugout and old trench on the three-mile stretch between the Front and Polygon Wood contributed its quota.  The regiment had evacuated Polygon Wood on the night of the third. Across the old trail our fatigue parties had tramped new ones in the mud, up past Regent Street, Leicester Square and Picadilly. We passed them all.  We were marched over to the little settlement of pine-bough huts which the regiment had previously taken over from the French. The men with me greeted them like old friends. Here was the Sniper's Hut, there the Commanding Officer's. This was the hut in which the brave Joe Waldron had \"gone West,\" that on the site of one where fourteen of \"ours\" had stopped a shell while they slept. Memories submerged us and made us weak. Even the guiding rope that our men had used to hold themselves to the trail of nights still held its place for groping German hands.  Beside it lay the fragments of the French signboards, jocular advertisements of mud baths for trench fever, the _hôtel_ this and the _maison_ that. One of my companions pointed to a larger hut which he said our fellows had called the Hotel Cecil. The board was missing now. And no German signboard took its place. Their wit did not run in so richly innocent a channel.  The huts lay just off the race track in front of the ruined château, buried deep in the remnants of what had once been the beautiful park of a large country estate. These huts were now the German headquarters.  There was as much English as German talked there that day. Everywhere there was cooking going on, mostly in portable camp kitchens.  As we came to a halt one big fellow smoking a pipe observed nonchalantly: \"You fellows are lucky. Our orders were to take no Canadian prisoners.\"  The man was so casual, so utterly matter-of-fact and there was about his remark so simple an air of directness and of finality that there was no escaping his sincerity, unduly interested though we were.  Another officer said \"Engländer?\"  The big fellow said \"Kanadien.\" The other raised his brows and shoulders: \"Uhh!\"  A younger officer came up: \"Never mind, boys: Your turn to-day. Might be mine to-morrow.\" Turning to the others, he too said: \"Engländer?\"      [Illustration: WOUNDED CANADIANS RECEIVING FIRST AID IN A     SUPPORT TRENCH AFTER AN ATTACK.]  \"No! Canadian.\"  \"Oh!\" And he appeared to be pleasantly surprised. He asked me for a souvenir and pointed to the brass Canada shoulder straps and the red cloth \"P. P. C. L. I.'s\" on the shoulders of the others. But I had already shoved my few trinkets down my puttees while lying back of the trench that afternoon. Scarfe, however, gave up his \"Canada\" straps.  The young officer gave him in return a carved nut with silver filigree work and gave another man a silver crucifix for the bronze maple leaves from the collar of his tunic. And, more important still, he gave us all a cigarette, while he had a sergeant give us coffee.  That, the cigarette, was I think much the best of anything we received then or for some time to come. Since the bombardment and our wounding, our nerves had fairly ached for the sedative which, good, bad or indifferent, would steady the quivering harp strings of our nerves. And a cigarette did that.  The headquarters staff appeared on the scene. They wanted information, just as ours would have done under similar circumstances, but these took a different method to acquire it. As before, in the trench, they selected me for the spokesman. The senior officer, a general apparently, addressed me: \"How many troops are there in front of our attack?\"  I lied: \"I don't know.\"  He shook a threatening finger at me. \"I'll tell you this, my man: We have a pretty good idea of how many troops lay behind you and if in any particular you endeavour to lead us astray it will go very hard with all of you. Now answer my question!\" His English was good.  I cogitated. It would not do to tell him the terrible truth. That was certain. So I took a chance. \"Three divisions.\" He appeared to be satisfied. The fact was, there were none behind us. We were utterly without supporting troops.  \"And Kitchener's Army? How many of them are there here?\"  \"Why, they haven't even come over yet, sir.\"  \"Don't tell me that: I know better. They've been out here for months.\"  \"But they haven't,\" I persisted. I told the truth this time.  \"Yes,\" he shouted angrily.  \"No,\" I flung back.  \"Well, how many of them are there?\"  The division yarn had gone down well. And perhaps I was slightly heated. My spirit ran ahead of my judgment. \"Five and a half to seven million,\" I said.  He exploded. And called me everything but a soldier. I could not help but reflect that I had overdone it a bit. And I certainly thought that I was \"for it\" then and there.  To make matters worse he asked the others and they, profiting by my mistake and following the lead of the first man questioned, put Kitchener's army at four and a half million; which was only a trifle of four million out. So I determined to be reasonable. When he came to me again I confirmed the latter figure, explaining my earlier statement by my lack of exact knowledge. And so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25683"],["title","The Escape of a Princess Pat (#6)"],["body","particular storm blew over.  The general came back to me again. \"You Canadians thought this was going to be a picnic, didn't you?\" He was very sarcastic.  \"No, we didn't, sir.\"  \"Well, you thought it was going to be a walk through to Berlin, didn't you?\"  \"Why, no. We thought it was the other way about, sir,\" I ventured.  He shifted: \"Well, what do you think of us anyhow?\"  \"Your artillery was all right but your infantry was no good.\" I began to feel shaky again. However, he took that calmly enough.  \"Oh! So our infantry was no good.\"  \"We could have held them all right, sir.\"  He ruminated on that a moment, rumbled in his throat and abruptly changed the subject, in an unpleasant fashion, however.  \"You're the fellows we want to get hold of. You cut the throats of our wounded.\"  I denied it and we argued back and forth over that for several minutes, and very heatedly. He referred to St. Julien and said that this thing had occurred there. I said and quite truthfully that we had not been at St. Julien, that we were in the Imperial and not the Canadian Army and had been spectators in near-by trenches of the St. Julien affair. I even went into some detail to explain that we were a special corps of old soldiers who, not being able to rejoin their old regiments, had at the outbreak of war formed one of their own and had been accepted as such and sent to France months ahead of the Canadian contingent. I added that I myself had just rejoined the regiment, having got my \"Blighty\" in March at St. Eloi and as proof of my other statements I further volunteered that I was one of the 2nd Gordons and after the South African War had gone to Canada where I had finished my reserve several years since.  He listened but was plainly unconvinced. Another officer broke in: \"I can explain it, sir. These men were in the 80th Brigade and the 27th Division. Colonel Farquhar was their Commanding Officer and Captain Buller took command when Colonel Farquhar was killed.\" We stared at one another in amazement, for it was all quite true.  This finished that examination. We did not tell them that Colonel Buller had been blinded a few days before and had been succeeded by that Major Hamilton Gault who had been so largely instrumental in raising us.  None of our wounds had received the slightest attention. Cox in particular suffered cruelly but refused to whimper. Royston's head was swollen to the size of a water bucket and he was in great pain. We left them here and never saw them again. Cox died two weeks later of a blood poisoning which was the combined result of our rough surgery and the wanton neglect of our captors. I do not think he was ever able to write his mother as he wished. At least she wrote me later for information. There was no need of his dying even though it might have been necessary to have amputated his arm higher up. Royston was exchanged to Switzerland and recovered from his wounds except for the loss of an eye.     CHAPTER VIII  THE PRINCESS PATRICIA'S GERMAN UNCLE    Roulers--The Old Woman and the Gentle Uhlans--Billeted in a   Church--Quizzed by a Prince.   We were marched to Roulers, which we reached well after dark. A considerable crowd of soldiers and civilians awaited our coming. The Belgian women and children congregated in front of the church while we waited to be let in, and threw us apples and cigarettes. The uhlans and infantrymen rushed them with the flat side of their swords and the butts of their muskets; and mistreated them. They knocked one old woman down quite close to where I stood. So we had to do without and were not even permitted to pick up the gifts that lay at our feet, much less the old woman.  The church had been used as a stable quite recently and the stone-flagged floor was deep with the decayed straw and accumulated filth of men and horses. We lay down in it and got what rest we could for the remainder of the night. There were about one hundred and fifty prisoners in all--Shropshires, Cheshires, King's Royal Rifles and other British regiments--all from our division and mostly from our brigade. Other small parties continued to come in during the night, but there were no more P.P.'s. In the morning a large tub of water was carried in and each man was given a bit of black bread and a slice of raw fat bacon. The latter was salty and so thoroughly unappetizing that I cannot recall that any one ate his ration, for in spite of the fact that we had been twenty-four hours without food, we were so upset by the experiences we had undergone, so shattered by shell fire and lack of rest that we were perhaps inclined to be more critical of our food than normal men would have been.  Shortly afterward a high German officer came in with his staff. He was a stout and well-built man of middle age or over, typically German in his general characteristics but not half bad looking. His uniform was covered with braid and medals. Every one paid him the utmost deference. He stopped in the middle of the room.  \"Are there any Canadians here?\"  I stepped forward. \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I mean the Princess Patricia's Canadians.\"  \"Yes, sir. I am. And here's some more of them,\" and I pointed at the prostrate figures of my companions, where they sprawled on the flagstones.  \"Princess Patricia's Regiment?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, the Princess Patricia is my niece--awfully nice girl. I hope it won't be long before I see her again.\"  I grinned: \"Well, I hope it won't be long before I see her, too, sir.\"  The other fellows joined us, the straw and the smell of it still sticking to their clothes as they formed a little knot about the Prince and his staff.  The scene was incongruous, the smart uniforms of the immaculately kept staff officers contrasting strangely with our own unkempt foulness. We occupied the centre of the stage. Around us were grouped the men of our sister regiments, most of them lying on the floor in a dazed condition. There were few who came forward to listen. They were too tired, and to them at least, this was merely an incident--one of a thousand more important ones. Odd parts of clothes hung on the ornate images and decorations of the room. A German rifle hung by its sling from the patient neck of a life-sized Saviour, while further over, the vermin-infested shirt of a Britisher hung over the rounded breasts of a brooding Madonna, with the Infant in her lap.  At the door a small group of guards stood stiffly to a painful attention and continued so to do whilst royalty touched them with the shadow of its wings.  The Prince questioned us further and I told him that I had been on a guard of honor to the Princess when she had been a child and when her father, the Duke of Connaught had been the General Officer Commanding at Aldershot.  He laughed back at us and was altogether very friendly. \"You'll go to a good camp and you'll be all right if you behave yourselves.\"  Scarfe shoved in his oar here, grousing in good British-soldier fashion: \"I don't call it very good treatment when they steal the overcoats from wounded men.\"  \"Who did that?\" He was all steel, and I saw a change come over the officers of the staff.  \"The chaps that took us prisoners,\" said Scarfe.  \"What regiment were they?\" The Prince glanced at an aide, who hastily drew out a notebook and began to take down our replies.  \"The 21st Prussians, sir.\"  \"Do you know the men?\"  \"Their faces but not their names.\"  \"Of what rank was the officer in charge?\"  We did not know, but thought him a company officer of the rank of captain perhaps. He asked for other particulars which we gave to the best of our knowledge.  \"I'll attend to that,\" he said. However, we heard no more of it. We refrained from complaining about the actual ill-treatment and indignities we had been subjected to, the murder of our unoffending comrades, or the lack of attention to our wounds, as we rightly judged that we should only have earned the enmity of our guards.  \"May I have your cap badge?\" the Prince asked, decently enough.  I lied brazenly: \"Sorry, sir; I've lost mine.\"  The fact was I had shoved it down under my puttees while lying back of the trench the previous afternoon.  Scarfe said: \"You can have mine, sir.\"  He took it. \"Thanks so much.\" He glanced at the aide again; rather sharply this time, I thought. The latter blushed and hastily extracted a wallet, from which he handed Scarfe a two-mark piece, equal to one and ten pence, or forty-four cents. He gave us his name before leaving, and my recollection is that it was something like Eitelbert. Evidently he was a brother of the Duchess of Connaught, whom we knew to have been a German princess whose brothers and other male relatives all enjoyed high commands among our foes.     CHAPTER IX  HOW THE GERMAN RED CROSS TENDED THE CANADIAN WOUNDED    \"Come Out Canadians!\"--The Crucifixion--\"Nix! Nix!\"--Civilian   Hate--\"Engländer Schwein!\"   We remained in the fouled church all of that day and night and until the following morning. No more food appeared. We were marched down to the railroad under heavy escort, crowded into freight cars and locked in. The guards were distributed in cars of their own, alternating with ours. Our wounds remained unattended to.  At every station they thundered: \"Come out, Canadians!\" They lined us up in a row while a staff officer put the same questions to us in nearly every case. They were particularly interested in the quality of our rations and asked if it was not true that we were starving and if our pay had not been stopped. The guards invariably explained to the civilians that these were the Canadians who had cut the throats of the German wounded.  We did not know how to explain the prevalence of this impression. On the contrary, we were aware of the story of the crucifixion of three of the Canadian Division during Ypres. The tale had come smoking hot to our men in the Polygon Wood trenches during the great battle. It gave in great detail all the salient facts which were that after recapturing certain lost"]]]
