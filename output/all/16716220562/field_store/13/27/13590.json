They passed down a broad staircase into a noble hall, and from thence into a library whose broad, low, mullioned stone window opened into what had been the inner court of the castle, whose ramparts and flanking corner towers were still there; but the echoing stones that had once paved it had given place to verdant lawn, trim flower-beds ablaze with bloom, quaintly-cut shrubs, and creepers which beautified the walls once so bare and grim.  \"I want to talk to you, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, sinking into a great formal chair.  \"Bring your stool and sit down.\"  \"Got too big for the stool, mother,\" said the boy; \"I can't double up my legs close enough.  I'll sit here.\"  He threw himself upon the thick carpet at her feet, and rested his arms upon her lap.  \"Want to talk to me?  I'd rather hear you read.\"  \"Not now, my dear.\"  \"Why, what's the matter, mother?\" said the boy, anxiously.  \"You're as white as can be.  Got one of your headaches?\"  \"No, my boy,--at least, my head does ache.  But it is my heart, Roy,--my heart.\"  \"Then you've heard bad news,\" cried the boy.  \"Oh, mother, tell me; what is it?  Not about father?\"  \"No, no; Heaven forbid, my dear,\" cried Lady Royland, wildly.  \"It is the absence of news that troubles me so.\"  \"I ought to say us,\" said Roy, angrily; \"but I'm so selfish and thoughtless.\"  \"Don't think that, my boy.  You are very young yet, but I do wish you would give more thought to your studies with Master Pawson.\"  The boy frowned.  \"I wish you'd let me read with you, mother,\" he said.  \"I understand everything then, and I don't forget it; but when that old--\"  \"Master Palgrave Pawson,\" said Lady Royland, reprovingly, but with a smile.  \"Oh, well, Master Palgrave Pawson.  P.P., P.P.  What a mouthful it seems to be!\"  \"Roy!\"  \"I've tried, mother; but I do get on so badly with him.  I can't help it; I don't like him, and he doesn't like me, and it will always be the same.\"  \"But why?  Why do you not like him?\"  \"Because--because--well, he always smiles at me so.\"  \"That does not seem as if he disliked you.  Rather the reverse.\"  \"He's so smooth and oily.\"  \"It is only his manner, my dear.  He seems to be very sincere, and to have your welfare at heart.\"  \"Yes, that's it, mother; he won't let me alone.\"  \"But he is your tutor, my dear.  You know perfectly well that he came to be your father's secretary and your tutor combined.\"  \"Yes, I know, mother,\" said the boy, impatiently; \"but somehow he doesn't seem to teach me.\"  \"But he is very studious, and tries hard.\"  \"Yes, I know.  But he seems to think I'm about seven instead of nearly seventeen, and talks to me as if I were a very little boy, and--and--and we don't get on.\"  \"This sounds very sad, Roy, and I cannot bear to have a fresh trouble now.  Your studies are so important to us.\"  Roy reached up to get his arms round his mother's neck, drew her head down, and kissed her lovingly.  \"And she shan't have any more trouble,\" he cried.  \"I'll get wonderfully fond of old Paw.\"  \"Roy!\"  \"Master Palgrave Pawson, then; and I'll work at my lessons and classics like a slave.  But you will read with me, too, mother?\"  \"As much as you like, my son.  Thank you.  That has taken away part of my load.\"  \"I wish I could take away the rest; but I know you're fidgeting because father hasn't written, and think that something has happened to him. But don't you get fancying that, because there can't be anything. They've only gone after a mob of shoemakers and tailors with a counterpane for flag, and father will scatter them all like dead leaves.\"  \"Roy!  My boy, these are not your words?\"  \"No, mother; old Ben Martlet said something of that kind to me this morning.\"  \"Does he not know, then, how serious it is?\"  \"Serious?  What do you mean by serious?\"  Lady Royland drew a deep breath, and laid her hand upon her side as if in pain.  \"Why, mother,\" repeated the boy, \"what do you mean by serious?\"  \"This trouble--this rising, my dear.  We have had no news, but Master Pawson has had letters from London, and he tells me that what was supposed to be a little petty discontent has grown into a serious revolution.\"  Roy gazed in his mother's troubled face as if he did not quite comprehend the full extent of her words.  \"Well, and if it has, mother, what then?\"  \"What then, my boy?\"  \"Yes.  You've nothing to fidget about.  Father is there with his men, and he'll soon put a stop to it all.  You know how stern he can be when people misbehave.\"  \"My dear Roy, this, I am afraid, is going to be no little trouble that your father can put down with his men.  Master Pawson tells me that there is every prospect of its being a civil war.\"  \"What!  Englishmen fighting against Englishmen?\"  \"Yes; a terrible fratricidal war.\"  \"But who has quarrelled, mother?  Oh, the king will soon stop it.\"  \"Roy, my boy, we have kept you so shut up here in this retired place for home study, instead of parting with you to send you to one of the great schools, that in some things you are as ignorant as I.\"  \"Oh, mother!\" cried the boy, laughing.  \"You ignorant!  I only wish I were half as learned and clever.  Why, father said--\"  \"Yes, yes, dear; but that is only book-learning.  We have been so happy here that the jarring troubles of politics and the court have not reached our ears; and I, for one, never gave them a thought till, after all these years of peacefulness, your father found himself compelled to obey the call of duty, and left us.  We both thought that it was only for a week or two, and then the disturbance would be at an end; but every letter he has sent me has contained worse news, till now it is nearly a month since I have heard from him.\"  \"Then it is because he is putting down the rioters,\" said Roy, quickly.  \"Rioters, my boy!  Rebels you should say, for I fear that a great attempt is to be made to overthrow the monarchy.  Master Pawson's informants assure him that this is the case, and before long, he says, there must be an encounter between the Royal and the Parliamentary troops.\"  \"Is Master Pawson right, mother?  Royal troops--Parliamentary troops? Why, they're all the same.\"  \"No, Roy; there is a division--a great division, I fear, and discontented people are taking the side against the king.\"  \"Then I'm sorry for them,\" said the boy, flushing.  \"They'll get a most terrible beating, these discontented folks.\"  \"Let us hope so, my boy, so that there may be an end to this terrible anxiety.  To those who have friends whom they love in the army, a foreign war is dreadful enough; but when I think of the possibility of a war here at home, with Englishmen striving against Englishmen, I shudder, and my heart seems to sink.\"  \"Look here,\" cried the boy, as he rose and stood with his hand resting upon his mother's shoulder, \"you've been fidgeting and fancying all sorts of things, because you haven't heard from father.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" said Lady Royland, faintly.  \"Then you mustn't, mother.  'Tis as I say; he is too busy to write, or else he hasn't found it easy to send you a letter.  I'll take the pony and ride over to Sidecombe and see when the Exeter wagon comes in. There are sure to be letters for you, and even if there are not, it will make you more easy for me to have been to see, and I can bring you back what news there is.  I'll go at once.\"  Lady Royland took hold of her son's hand and held it fast.  \"No,\" she said, making an effort to be firm.  \"We will wait another day. I have been fidgeting, dear, as you say, and it has made me nervous and low-spirited; but I'm better now for talking to you, my boy, and letting you share my trouble.  I dare say I have been exaggerating.\"  \"But I should like to ride over, mother.\"  \"You shall go to-morrow, Roy; but even then I shall be loath to let you. There, you see I am quite cheerful again.  You are perfectly right; your father is perhaps away with his men, and he may have sent, and the letter has miscarried in these troublous times.\"  \"I shouldn't like to be the man who took it, if it has miscarried,\" said the boy, laughing.  \"Poor fellow! it may have been an accident.  There, go to Master Pawson now; and Roy, my dear, don't talk about our trouble to any one for the present.\"  \"Not to old Pawson?\"  \"Master Pawson.\"  \"Not to Master Pawson?\" said Roy, smiling.  \"Not unless he speaks to you about it; then, of course, you can.\"  \"But he won't, mother.  He only talks to me about the Greek and Latin poets and about music.  I say, you don't want to see me squeezing a big fiddle between my knees and sawing at it with a bow as if I wanted to cut all the strings, do you, mother?\"  \"My dear boy, not unless you wished to learn the violoncello.\"  \"Well, I don't,\" said Roy, pettishly; \"but old Master Pawson is always bringing his out of its great green-baize bag and talking to me about it.  He says that he will instruct me, and he is sure that my father would have one sent to me from London if I asked him.  Just as if there are not noises enough in the west tower now without two of us sawing together.  _Thrrum, thrrum, throomp, throomp, throomp_!\"  Roy struck an attitude as if playing, running his left hand up and down imaginary strings while he scraped with his right, and produced no bad imitation of the vibrating strings with his mouth.  \"I should not dislike for you to play some instrument to accompany my clavichord, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, smiling at the boy's antics.  \"Very well, then; I'll learn the trumpet,\" cried the lad.  \"I'm off now to learn--not music.\"  \"One moment, Roy, my dear,\" said Lady Royland, earnestly.  \"Don't let your high spirits get the better of your discretion.\"  \"Of course not, mother.\"  \"You do not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],["title","The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#3)"],["body","me, my dear.  I am speaking very seriously now. I mean, do not let Master Pawson think that you ridicule his love of music.  It would be very weak and foolish, and lower you in his eyes.\"  \"Oh, I'll mind, mother.\"  \"Recollect that he is a scholar and a gentleman, and in your father's confidence.\"  Roy nodded, and his lips parted as if to speak, but he closed them again.  \"What were you going to say, Roy?\"  \"Oh, nothing, mother.\"  \"Nothing?\"  \"Well, only--that--I was going to say, do you like Master Pawson?\"  \"As your tutor and your father's secretary, yes.  He is a very clever man, I know.\"  \"Yes, he's a very clever man,\" said Roy, as, after kissing his mother affectionately, he went off towards the west tower, which had been specially fitted up as study and bedchamber for the gentleman who had come straight from Oxford to reside at Sir Granby Royland's seat a couple of years before this time.  \"Yes, he's a very clever man,\" said Roy to himself; \"but I thought I shouldn't like him the first day he came, and I've gone on thinking so ever since.  I don't know why, but-- Oh, yes, I do,\" cried the boy, screwing up his face with a look of disgust: \"it's because, as he says, I've no soul for music.\"  For just at that moment a peculiar long-drawn wailing sound came from the open window of the west tower, and a dog lying curled up on the grass in the sun sprang up and began to bark, finishing off with a long, low howl, as it stretched out its neck towards the open window.  \"Poor old Nibbs! he has no soul for it, either,\" said the boy to himself, as his face lit up with a mirthful expression.  \"It woke him up, and he thought it was cats.  Wonder what tune that is?  He won't want me to interrupt him now.  Better see, though, and speak to him first, and then I'll go and see old Ben polish the armour.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.  The wail on one string went on, and naturally sounded louder as Roy Royland opened a door to stand gazing in at the quaint octagonal room, lit by windows splayed to admit more light to the snug quarters hung with old tapestry, and made cosy with thick carpet and easy-chair, and intellectual with dwarf book-cases filled with choice works.  These had overflowed upon the floor, others being piled upon the tops of chairs and stacked in corners wherever room could be found, while some were even ranged upon the narrow steps of the corkscrew stone staircase which led to the floor above, occupied by Master Palgrave Pawson for a bedchamber, the staircase being continued up to the leads, where it ended in a tiny turret.  \"I wonder what father will say, my fine fellow, when he finds what a lot of his books you've brought up out of the library,\" said Roy to himself, as he stood watching the plump, smooth-faced youngish man, who, with an oblong music-book open before him on the table, was seated upon a stool, with a 'cello between his legs, gravely sawing away at the strings, and frowning severely whenever, through bad stopping with his fingers--and that was pretty often--he produced notes \"out of tune and harsh.\"  The musician was dressed, according to the fashion of the day, in dark velvet with a lace collar, and wore his hair long, so that it inconvenienced him; the oily curls, hanging down on either side of his fat face like the valance over an old-fashioned four-post bedstead, swaying to and fro with the motion of the man's body, and needing, from time to time, a vigorous shake to force them back when they encroached too far forward and interfered with his view of the music.  The slow, solemn, dirge-like air went on, but the player did not turn his head, playing away with grave importance, and giving himself a gentle inclination now and then to make up for the sharp twitches caused by the tickling hair.  \"You saw me,\" said Roy, speaking to himself, but at the musician, \"for one of your eyes turned this way; but you won't speak till you've got to the end of that bit of noise.  Oh, how I should like to shear off those long greasy curls!  They make you look worse even than you do when they're all twisted up in pieces of paper.  It doesn't suit your round, fat face.  You don't look a bit like a cavalier, Master P.P.; but I suppose you're a very good sort of fellow, or else father would not have had you here.\"  Just then the music ended with an awkwardly performed run up an octave and four scrapes across the first and second strings.  \"Come in, boy,\" said the player, taking up a piece of resin to apply to the hair of the bow, \"and shut the door.\"  He spoke in a highly-pitched girlish voice, which somehow always tickled Roy and made him inclined to laugh, and the desire increased upon this occasion as he said, solemnly--  \"Saraband.\"  \"Oh!  Who's she?\" said the boy, wonderingly.  The secretary threw his head back, shaking his curls over his broad turn-down collar, and smiled pityingly.  \"Ah,\" he said, \"now this is another proof of your folly, Roy, in preferring the society of the servants to that of the noble works with which your father has stored his library.  What ignorance!  A saraband is a piece of dance music, Italian in origin; and that was a very beautiful composition.\"  \"Dance?\" cried the boy.  \"People couldn't dance to a tune like that.  I thought it was an old dirge.\"  \"Want of taste and appreciation, boy.  But I see you would prefer something light and sparkling.  I will--sit down--play you a coranto.\"  It was on Roy's lips to say, \"Oh, please don't,\" but he contented himself with crossing the room, lifting some books off an oaken window-seat, his tutor watching him keenly the while, and putting them on the floor; while, with his head still thrown back on one side, Master Palgrave Pawson slowly turned over the leaves of his music-book with the point of his bow.  Roy seated himself, with a sigh, after a glance down through the open window at the glistening moat dotted with the great silver blossoms and dark flat leaves of the water-lilies, seeing even from there the shadowy forms of the great fish which glided slowly among the slimy stalks.  \"Ready?\" said the musician, giving his hand a flourish.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Roy, aloud; and then to himself, \"Oh, what an awful fib.\"  Then he wrinkled up his brows dismally, and began to think of old Ben polishing the armour and swords; but the next moment his face smoothed out stiffly, and he grew red in his efforts to keep from laughing aloud, for Master Pawson commenced jerking and snatching from the strings a remarkable series of notes, which followed one another in a jigging kind of fairly rapid sequence, running up and down the gamut and in and out, as if the notes of the composer had suddenly become animated, and, like some kind of tiny, big-headed, long-tailed goblins, were chasing one another in and out of the five lines of the stave, leaping from bar to bar, never stopping for a rest, making fun of the flats and sharps, and finally pausing, breathless and tired, as the player now finally laid down the bow, took out a fine laced handkerchief, and began to wipe his fingers and mop his brow.  \"There,\" he said, smiling; \"you like that bright, sparkling composition better?\"  \"No,\" said Roy, decisively; \"no, I don't think I do.\"  \"I am glad of it; very glad of it.  I was afraid that you preferred the light and trivial coranto to the graceful saraband.\"  \"But, I say.  Master Pawson, the Italians surely don't dance to such music as that?\"  \"I have never been in Italy, my dear pupil, but I believe they do. Going?\"  Roy had risen from his chair.  \"Yes, sir; I thought, as you were practising, you would not want me to stop and read to-day, and you are writing a letter, too.\"  \"Letter?\" said the secretary, hurriedly reaching towards an open sheet upon the table and turning it over with the point of his bow.  \"Oh, that?  Yes, some notes--some notes.  Well, it is a fine day, and exercise is good, and perhaps I shall run through a few more compositions.  So you can go, and we will study a little in the evening, for we must not neglect our work, Roy, my dear pupil; we must not neglect our work.\"  \"No, sir.  Thank you, sir,\" said the boy; and, for fear of a change of decision, he hurried from the room and made his way out upon the old ramparts, to begin walking leisurely round the enclosed garden, and looking outward from the eminence upon which the castle was built across the moat at the foot, and away over the sunny forest towards the village and little church, whose spire rose about two miles away.  \"I wish he wouldn't always call me `my dear pupil,' and smile at me as if he looked down from ever so high up.  I don't know how it is, but I always feel as if I don't like him.  I suppose it's because he's so plump and smooth.  \"Seems hard,\" mused the boy, seating himself in one of the crenellations of the rampart, and thinking deeply, \"that he should get letters with news from London, and poor mother not have a line.  That was a letter on the table, though he pretended it was not, for I could see it began like one.  I didn't want to read it.  Perhaps he was ashamed of being always writing letters.  Don't matter to me.  Afraid, perhaps, that he'll be told that he ought to attend more to teaching me.  Wish he'd be always writing letters.  I can learn twice as much reading with mother.\"  It was very beautiful in that sunny niche in the mouldering stones close to the tower farthest away from that occupied by the secretary, and a spot much favoured by the boy, for from there he could look right over the square gate-way with its flanking towers, and the drawbridge which was never drawn, and the portcullis which was never lowered.  \"Can't hear him playing here,\" thought Roy that day; and he congratulated himself upon the fact, without pausing to think that the distance was so short that the notes should have been audible.  Roy had been successful in getting off his reading with the tutor, but he was very undecided what to do next,"]]]
