A lieutenant in our regiment, and not drink! I see! You haven't learned yet; but it won't take you long. Your case is exactly my own. I was about your age when I went to the Crimea, and didn't know wine from brandy. After the battle of Balaclava, where I did some little thing which excited the admiration of the nobs in command, Lord Raglan sent for me, and invited me to take a glass of wine with him. Of course, I could not refuse his lordship, especially as he was in the very act of complimenting me for what he was pleased to call my gallant conduct. I drank my first glass of wine then. It was Sicily Madeira, and light, sweet wine; and, my dear fellow, you shall begin with the same, and we will drink the health of Senator Guilford and his fair daughter. Waiter, one brandy smash and one Sicily Madeira.\"  \"Really, Captain de Banyan, you must excuse me,\" stammered Somers, completely bewildered by the eloquent and insinuating manners of his brilliant companion, who had spoken loud enough to attract the attention of a dozen idlers greedy for excitement of any kind, and to whom the latter part of his remarks seemed to be addressed, rather than to the timid young man in front of him.  Captain de Banyan appeared to have a point to carry; which was nothing less than to overcome the conscientious scruples of the young officer. He had spoken loud enough to attract the attention of these miserable tipplers, that Somers might be over-awed by their presence, and intimidated by their sneers, and thus compelled to taste the intoxicating cup. The squad of fast men who had taken positions near the table were interested in the scene, and impatient to see the pure soul tumbled from its lofty eminence.  \"Here's the nectar!\" almost shouted the captain as the waiter placed the drinks upon the table. \"Wine for you; brandy for me. You will be promoted to brandy one of these days, my boy, when your head is stronger and your nerves stiffer. Lieutenant Somers, here's to the health of the patriot statesman, Senator Guilford, and his lovely daughter;\" and the captain pushed aside the straw in the vile compound, and raised the glass to his lips.  Somers was embarrassed at his position, and bewildered by the dashing speeches of his companion. A dozen pair of leering eyes were fixed upon him; a dozen mouths were wrinkled into sottish smiles, called up by his sufferings at that critical moment. He reached forth his hand, and grasped the slender stem of the wine-glass; but his arm trembled more than that of the most hardened toper in the group before him. He had been trembling in the presence of that squad of tyrants--those leer-eyed grinning debauchees, who seemed to be opening the gate of hell, and bidding him enter.  \"Tom Somers,\" said the still small voice which had spoken to him a thousand times before in the perils and temptations through which he had passed, \"you have behaved yourself very well thus far. You have been promoted for bravery on the battlefield; and now will you cower in the presence of this brilliant brawler, and these weak-minded, cowardly tipplers? What would your mother say if she could see you now, with your shaking hand fastened to the wine-cup? What would Lilian Ashford say? Dare you drink the health of Emmie Guilford in such a place as this? You should have smote the lips that mentioned her name in such a presence!\"  He drew back his hand from the glass. His muscles tightened up, as they had on the bloody field of Williamsburg. Tom Somers was himself again.  \"Come, Somers, you don't drink,\" added the captain sarcastically.  \"No, I thank you; I never drink,\" he answered resolutely, as he cast a steady glance of pity and contempt at the bloated crew who had been reveling in his embarrassment.  \"You won't refuse now?\"  \"Most decidedly.\"  \"Lieutenant Somers, I took you for a young man of pluck. I'm disappointed. You will pardon me, my dear fellow; but I can't help regarding your conduct as rather shabby.\"  \"I never drink, as I have said before, and I do not intend to begin now. If I have been shabby, I hope you will excuse me.\"  \"Certainly I will excuse you, when you atone for your folly, and drink with me.\"  The spectators laughed, and evidently thought the captain had made a point.  \"Then I can never atone for my folly, as you call it,\" replied Somers, his courage increasing as the trial demanded it.  \"What would Lord Raglan have said if I had refused to drink his Sicily Madeira?\"  \"Very likely he would have said just what you said; but there would have been no more sense in it then than now.\"  \"Bully for young 'un!\" said a seedy dandy, whose love of fancy drinks had made a compromise with his love of dress.  \"I will leave it to these gentlemen to decide whether I have not spoken reason and good sense.\"  \"I will leave you and these _gentlemen_ to settle that question to suit yourselves, and I will bid you good-evening,\" said Somers, rising from his chair.  The unpleasant emphasis which he placed upon the word \"gentlemen\" created a decided sensation among the group of idlers; and, as he stepped from behind the table, he was confronted by a young man with bloodshot eyes and bloated cheeks, but dressed in the extreme of fashion.  \"Sir, you wear the colors of the United States Army,\" said the juvenile tippler; \"but you can't be permitted to insult a gentleman with impunity.\"  Lieutenant Somers wanted to laugh in the face of this specimen of bar-room chivalry, for he forcibly reminded him of a belligerent little bantam-rooster that paraded the barnyard of his mother's cottage at Pinchbrook; but he was prudent enough not to give any further cause of offense. Bestowing one glance at this champion of the tippler's coterie, he turned aside, and attempted to move towards the door.  \"Stop, sir,\" continued the young man, who plainly wanted to make a little capital out of a fight, in defense of the dignity of his friends. \"You can't go without an apology, or--or a fight,\" added the bully, shaking his head significantly, as he placed himself in front of the young lieutenant.  \"What am I to apologize for?\" asked Somers.  \"You insulted the whole party of us. You intimated that we were no gentlemen.\"  \"I haven't spoken to any of you since I came in,\" protested Somers. \"I never had anything to do with you, and I don't know whether you are gentlemen or not.\"  \"You hear that, gentlemen!\" added the bully.  \"I think I have said all that is necessary to say; with your leave I will go,\" said Somers.  \"Stop, sir!\" snarled the young ruffian, putting his hand on the lieutenant's collar.  \"Take your hand off!\" said he sternly.  The fellow complied.  \"This thing has gone far enough, sir,\" said Captain de Banyan, stepping between Somers and his assailant. \"Lieutenant Somers is my friend; and, if you put the weight of your little finger upon him, I'll annihilate you quicker than I did a certain Austrian field-marshal at the battle of Solferino. Gentlemen, permit me to apologize for my inexperienced friend if he has uttered any indiscreet word.\"  \"He must apologize!\" blustered the young ruffian. \"He says we are no gentlemen. Let him prove it.\"  \"You have proved it yourself, you little ape,\" replied the captain, as he stepped up to the bar, and paid his reckoning, bestowing no more attention upon the ruffled little bully than if he had been a very small puppy; which perhaps he was not, by a strict construction of terms.  \"I demand satisfaction!\" roared the flashy little toper. \"Apologize, or fight!\"  \"Neither, my gay and festive lark,\" said the captain with abundant good humor, as he took Somers's arm, and sauntered leisurely towards the door. \"Now, my dear fellow, we will go and hear what Lieutenant-Colonel Staggerback has to say about the battle of Bull Run. I was in that action, and rallied the Fire Zouaves when Colonel Ellsworth was killed.\"  \"Colonel Ellsworth! He wasn't killed at Bull Run!\" exclaimed Somers, astonished beyond measure at the singular character which his companion was developing.  \"You are right; he was killed at Ball's Bluff.\"  \"I think not; but were you at Bull Run?\"  \"Certainly I was. I was on General Frémont's staff.\"  \"Were you, indeed? Whew!\"  \"What may be the precise meaning of that whistle? Do you think I was not there?\"  \"Well, I don't remember to have seen you there?\"  \"Very likely you did not; but you will call to mind the fact, that things were rather mixed up in that action. But never mind that: we will talk those things over when we get down upon the Peninsula, and have nothing else to think about. Do you really mean to say, my dear fellow, that you never drink at all?\"  \"I do not.\"  \"Well, I have heard of a man climbing up to the moon on a greased rainbow; but I never heard of an officer before that didn't drink.\"  \"I'm afraid you haven't been very careful in the choice of your companions. I know a great many that never taste liquor under any circumstances.\"  \"It may be so; and I am willing to confess that I have found one. I wouldn't have believed it before if I had read it in the Constitution of the United States. I owe you an apology, then, for letting on in that saloon. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, my dear fellow; but I thought you were joking.\"  \"I hope you will not repeat the experiment, then; though I shall consider myself fair game if I ever enter another rum-shop,\" replied Somers.  They proceeded to the place designated for the lecture; and Captain de Banyan betrayed his interest in that memorable battle, where he had served on the staff of General Frémont, by going to sleep before the eloquent \"participant\" had got half-way through the exordium. Lieutenant Somers listened attentively until he was satisfied that Colonel Staggerback either was not in the battle, or that he had escorted \"Bull Run Russell\" off the field.  When the lecture was finished, Somers awakened his edified"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25886"],["title","The Young Lieutenant; or, The Adventures of an Army Officer (#5)"],["body","n, and they returned to the hotel; though the captain hinted several times on the way that the \"elephant\" could be seen to better advantage in New York than in any other city in the Union. The young lieutenant had an utter disgust for the elephant, and took no hints. Before he retired that night, he thanked God, more earnestly and devoutly than usual, that he had been enabled to pass unscathed through the fires of temptation. He was still in condition to look his mother in the face.     CHAPTER V  ON THE SKIRMISH LINE   In the morning our travelers resumed their journey, more refreshed and in better condition for service than if they had spent the evening in chasing the \"elephant\" from one to another of the gilded dens of dissipation with which the metropolis abounds. In spite of his errors and sins, Somers could not help liking his dashing companion. He was a dangerous person; but his enthusiasm was so captivating, that he could not close his heart against him. But, while he liked the captain, he hated his vices.  They stopped in Philadelphia only long enough to dine, and in Baltimore only long enough for supper; arriving at Washington in the evening. Captain de Banyan again proposed to \"go round;\" which, rendered into unmistakable English, meant to visit the drinking-houses and gambling-saloons of the city, to say nothing of worse places. Lieutenant Somers had grown wise by experience; and no amount of persuasion could induce him to leave the hotel. It was horrible to him to think of spending even his leisure time in the haunts of dissipation, when his country was bleeding from a thousand wounds; when his gallant comrades in the Army of the Potomac were enduring peril and hardship in front of the enemy. He had no taste for carousing at any time, and every fiber of his moral nature was firmly set against the vices which lured on his reckless companion.  Lieutenant Somers stayed at the hotel that evening, listening to the conversation of the officers who had been at the front within a few days. The great battle of Fair Oaks had been fought during his absence, and there was every prospect that the most tremendous operations of the war would soon commence. He listened with the deepest interest to the accounts from the army, and needed none of the stimulus of the bar-room or the gambling-saloon to furnish him with excitement. He was soon to be an actor in the momentous events of the campaign; and the thought was full of inspiration, and lifted him up from the gross and vulgar tastes of his companion.  Before noon the next day, somewhat against the inclination of Captain de Banyan, the two officers were on board a steamer bound down the river. After some delays, they arrived at White House, on the Pamunkey River; and then proceeded by railroad nearly to the camp of the regiment, at Poplar Hill, in the very depths of White Oak Swamp.  \"My blessed boy!\" shouted Sergeant Hapgood when Lieutenant Somers appeared in the camp.  The veteran rushed upon him, and, not content to shake his hand he proceeded to hug him in the most extraordinary manner.  \"I am glad to see you, Hapgood! How have you been since I left?\" said Somers.  \"First-rate! Bless my withered old carcass, Tom, but I thought I never should see you again. Why, Tom, how handsome you've grown! Well, you'll be a brigadier one of these days, and there won't be a better-looking officer on the field. Dear me, Tom---- Beg pardon; I forgot that you are an officer; and I mustn't call you Tom any more.\"  \"Never mind that, uncle,\" added Somers, laughing. \"It would hardly be good discipline for a sergeant to call an officer by a nickname; but we will compromise, and you shall call me Tom when we are not on duty, and there is no one within hearing.\"  \"Compromise! Don't never use that word to me. After we fit the battle of Bull Run, I gouged that word out of my dictionary. No, sir! You are a leftenant now; and I shall allus call you Leftenant Somers, even if there ain't nobody within ten mile of us.\"  \"Just as you please, uncle; but, whatever you call me, we shall be just as good friends as we ever were.\"  \"That's so, Leftenant Somers.\"  \"Precisely, Sergeant Hapgood.\"  \"Now, what's the news in Pinchbrook?\" asked the veteran.  But, before Somers had a chance to tell the news from home, he was welcomed to the camp, and cheered, by officers and men; and his account of what had transpired in Pinchbrook during his thirty days' furlough was eagerly listened to by a large and attentive audience. He received in return a full history of the regiment during his absence. Though the narrative of sundry exciting events, such as forays upon pig-sties, poultry-yards, and kitchen-gardens, was highly amusing, there was a tale of sadness to tell--of deaths by disease and on the battlefield.  Many cheerful hearts that were beating with life and hope a few weeks before, were now silent in the grave--the soldier's mausoleum in a strange land. But soldiers have no time to weep over a dead past; they must live in the hope of a glorious future; and when they had dropped a tear to the memory of the noble and the true who had fallen on the field or died in the hospital, victims of the pestilential airs of the swamp, they laughed as merrily as ever, careless of Death's poised arrows which were always aimed at them.  Captain de Banyan took his place in the regiment, where Somers found that he was prodigiously popular, even after a few hours' acquaintance with his new command; but who he was, where he came from, and how he had procured his commission, was a mystery to officers and men. He told tremendous stories about the Crimea and the Italian war; and now for the first time intimated that he was the only survivor of the company which led the advance at the storming of Chapultepec, in the Mexican war. However much the officers enjoyed his stories, it is not probable that all of them believed what they heard.  Lieutenant Somers was perfectly familiar with the company and battalion drill; and, having quick perception and abundant self-possession, he was competent at once to perform his duties as an officer. He had no vices to be criticized by the men, who respected him not only for his bravery on the battlefield, but for his good moral character; for even the vicious respect the virtues which they practically contemn. Being neither arbitrary nor tyrannical, he was cheerfully obeyed; and his company never appeared better than when, by the temporary absence of his superior, it was under his command.  He was, however, allowed but a short time to become acquainted with the routine of the new duty before he was summoned to participate in those tremendous events which have passed into history as at once the most brilliant and disastrous operations of the war; brilliant in that our gallant army was almost invariably victorious, disastrous in that they were the forerunners of the ultimate failure of a hopeful campaign. The victory at Fair Oaks had raised the hopes of that brave, thinking army.  The picket-lines were within a few miles of Richmond, and the soldiers were burning with enthusiasm to be led against the enemy in front of them. They were ready to lay down their lives on the altar of their bleeding country, if the survivors could grasp the boon of peace within the buttressed walls of the rebel capital--peace that would hurl to the ground the defiant traitors, and insure the safety and perpetuity of free institutions. The notes of victory, those thinking soldiers believed, would reverberate through the coming ages, and point an epoch from which America would date her grandest and most sublime triumphs.  But not then was the great rebellion to be overthrown; for not yet had the leaven of Liberty leavened the whole lump; not yet had the purposes of a mysterious Providence been accomplished; and the brave men who sighed for victory and peace in the swamps of the Chickahominy were doomed to years of blood and toil, of victory and defeat, as they marched on, alike through both, to the consummation of a nation's glorious triumph, not over paltry armies of arrogant traitors, but over the incarnation of Evil, over Heaven-defying institutions, whose downfall established forever principles as eternal as God Himself.  Lieutenant Somers was filled with the spirit of the army. He felt that the salvation of his country depended upon the valor of that army; and, impressed with the magnitude of the interests at stake, he was resolved to do his whole duty. With cheerful alacrity he obeyed the summons which brought Grover's brigade into line of battle on the morning of the eventful 25th of June. What was to be accomplished was not for him to know; but forward moved the line through the swamp, through the woods, through the pools of stagnant waters up to the hips of the soldiers.  Impressed by the responsibility of his position, Lieutenant Somers encouraged the weak as they struggled through the mire on their trying march, and with fit words stimulated the enthusiasm of all. After a march of about a mile, a heavy skirmish line was thrown out, which soon confronted that of the rebels.  \"Now, Somers, my dear fellow, the concert is about to open,\" said Captain de Banyan. \"By the way, my boy, this reminds me of Magenta, where----\"  \"Oh, confound Magenta!\" exclaimed Somers.  \"Why, my dear fellow, you are as petulant as a belle that has lost her beau.\"  \"You don't propose to tell us a story about Magenta at such a time as this, do you?\"  \"Well, I confess I have a weakness in that direction. Magenta was a great battle. But I'm afraid you are a little nervous,\" laughed the captain.  \"Nervous? Do you think I'm a coward?\" demanded Somers.  \"I know you are not; but you might be a little nervous for all that.\"  At that instant, the sharp crack of a single rifle was heard, and Somers observed a slight jerk in the brim of the captain's felt hat.  \"Bravo!\" exclaimed Captain de Banyan as he took off his hat, and pointed to a hole"]]]
