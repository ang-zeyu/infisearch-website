You like it, don't you, Jenny?\"  \"Heavenly!\" said Jenny, rolling her eyes up with such a comically blissful expression that Elise nearly choked.  As Patty had agreed, the luncheon was good and substantial, rather than elaborate. The broiled chicken, dainty vegetables, and pretty salad all met the guests' hearty approval and appreciation; and when the ice cream was served, Mrs. Greene discovered she had both a fork and a spoon at her disposal.  \"Well, I never!\" she observed. \"Ain't that handy, now? I s'pose you take whichever one you like.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mona. \"You see, there is strawberry sauce for the ice cream, and that makes it seem more like a pudding.\"  \"So it does, so it does,\" agreed Mrs. Greene, \"though, land knows, it ain't much like the puddin's I'm accustomed to. Cottage, rice, and bread is about the variety we get, in the puddin' line. Not but what I'm mighty grateful to get those.\"  \"I like chocolate pudding,\" said Jenny, in a low voice, and apparently with great effort. Patty knew she made the remark because she thought it her duty to join in the conversation; and she felt such heroism deserved recognition.  \"So do I,\" she said, smiling kindly at Jenny. \"In fact, I like anything with chocolate in it.\"  \"So do I,\" returned Jenny, a little bolder under this expressed sympathy of tastes. \"Once I had a whole box of chocolate candies,--a pound box it was. I've got the box yet. I'm awful careful of the lace paper.\"  \"I often get boxes of candy,\" said Celeste, unable to repress this bit of vanity. \"My customers give them to me.\"  \"My,\" said Jenny, \"that must be fine. Is it grand to be a manicure?\"  \"I like it,\" said Celeste, \"because it takes me among nice people. They're mostly good to me.\"  \"My ladies are nice to me, too,\" observed Anna. \"I only sew in nice houses. But I don't see the ladies much. It's different with you, Miss Arleson.\"  \"Well, I don't see nice ladies,\" broke in Jenny. \"My, how those queens of society can snap at you! Seems 'if they blame me for everything: the stock, the price, the slow cash boys,--whatever bothers 'em, it's all my fault.\"  \"That is unkind,\" said Clementine. \"But shopping does make some people cross.\"  \"Indeed it does!\" returned Jenny. \"But I'm going to forget it just for to-day. When I sit here and see these things, all so beautiful and sparkly and bright, I pretend there isn't any shop or shopping in all the world.\"  Jenny's smile was almost roguish, and lighted up her pale face till she looked almost pretty.  Then they had coffee, and snapping crackers with caps inside, and they put on the caps and laughed at each other's grotesque appearance.  Mrs. Greene's cap was a tri-corne, with a gay cockade, which gave her a militant air, quite in keeping with her strong face. Patty had a ruffled night-cap, which made her look grotesque, and Anna Gorman had a frilled sunbonnet.  Celeste had a Tam o' Shanter, which just suited her piquant face, and Jenny had a Scotch cap, which became her well.  \"Now,\" said Mona, as she rose from the table, \"I'm going to give you each a bunch of these carnations----\"  \"To take home?\" broke in Jenny, unable to repress her eagerness.  \"Yes; and I'll have them put in boxes for you, along with your cards and souvenirs, which, of course, you must take home also. And, if there's room, I'll put in some of these Christmas tree thingamajigs, and you can use them for something at Christmas time.\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Jenny; \"maybe my two kid brothers won't just about go crazy over 'em! Says I to myself, just the other day, 'What's going in them kids' stockings is more'n I know; but something there must be.' And,--here you are!\"  \"Here you are!\" said Mona, tucking an extra snapping cracker or two in Jenny's box.  \"We plan to go for a motor ride, now,\" said Mona. \"I wonder if you girls are dressed warmly enough.\"  All declared that they were, but Mona provided several extra cloaks and wraps, lest any one should take cold.  \"We have two cars for our trip,\" she explained; \"Miss Farrington's limousine and my own. Has any one any preference which way we shall go?\"  \"Well,\" said Mrs. Greene, \"if you ask me, I'd like best to ride up Fifth Avenue. There ought to be some fine show of dress, a bright afternoon like this. And there ain't anything I admire like stylish clothes. That's a real handsome gown you got on, Miss Fairfield.\"  \"Do you like it?\" said Patty, smiling.  \"Yes, I do. It's fashionable of cut, and yet it ain't drawed so tight as some. And a becomin' colour, too.\"  \"It's a dandy,\" observed Jenny. \"I see lots of good clothes on my customers, but they don't all have such taste as Miss Fairfield's. And all you other ladies here,\" she added, politely, glancing round.  \"Now, are we all ready?\" asked Mona, looking over the group. \"Mrs. Greene, I fear you won't be warm enough, though your jacket _is_ thick, isn't it? But I'm going to throw this boa round your neck, by way of precaution. Please wear it; I have another.\"  \"My land! if this ain't luxuriant,\" and Mrs. Greene smoothed the neckpiece and muff that Mona put on her. \"What is this fur, Miss Galbraith?\"  \"That is caracul. Do you like it?\"  \"Like it? Well, I think it's just too scrumptious for anything. I'll remember the feel of it for a year. And so genteel looking, too.\"  \"Yes, it's a good fur,\" said Mona, carelessly throwing a sable scarf round her own throat. \"Now, let us start.\"  Down went the eight in an elevator, and Mrs. Greene was overjoyed to find that she was attended with quite as much deference as Mona herself. Elise and Clementine took their guests in the Farrington car, leaving Patty and Mona, with their guests, for the Galbraith car.  Celeste Arleson enjoyed the ride, but she was not so openly enthusiastic as Mrs. Greene.  \"My!\" exclaimed that worthy, as she bobbed up and down on the springy cushions; \"to think it's come at last! Why, I _never_ expected to ride in one of these. I saved up once for a taxicab ride, but I had to use my savings for a case of grippe, so I never felt to try it again.\"  \"Did you have grippe?\" said Patty, sympathetically; \"that was too bad.\"  \"Well, no; it wasn't _my_ grippe. Leastways, I didn't have it. It was a lady that lived in the same boardin' house, along with me. But she'd had misfortune, and lost her money, so I couldn't do no less than to help her. Poor thing! she was crossed in love and it made her queer. But that Rosy,--you know, that redhead boy, Miss Fairfield?\"  \"Yes, I do,\" returned Patty, smiling.  \"Well, he says she was queered in love, and it made her cross! She works in our place, you know. Well, cross she is; and, my land! if she wasn't cross when she had the grippe! You know, it ain't soothin' on folks' nerves.\"  \"No,\" said Patty; \"so I've understood. Well, Mrs. Greene, now you can see plenty of fashionable costumes. Do you enjoy it?\"  \"My! I'm just drinkin' 'em in! Furs is worn a lot this year, ain't they? Well, I don't wonder. Why, I feel real regal in this fur of yours, Miss Galbraith. I don't know when I've had such a pleasure as the wearin' of this fur.\"  \"Now, we'll go through the park and up Riverside Drive,\" said Mona, as they neared Eighty-sixth Street. It was pleasant in the Park, and the fine motors, with their smartly-apparelled occupants, delighted Mrs. Greene's very soul.  \"Where would you like to go, Celeste?\" asked Mona; \"or do you like the Park and the River drive?\"  \"If I might, Miss Galbraith, I'd like to go to Grant's Tomb. I've always wanted to go there, but I never can get a spare hour,--or if I do, I'm too tired for the trip.\"  \"Certainly, you shall. Would you like that, Mrs. Greene?\"  \"Oh, land, yes! I've never been there, either. Quite some few times I've thought to go, but something always interferes.\"  So to Grant's Tomb they went. The other car followed, and all went in to look at the impressive mausoleum.  \"Makes you feel kind o' solemn,\" said Mrs. Greene, as they came out. \"Think of lyin' there in that eternal rock, as you might say, and the whole nation comin' to weep over your bier.\"  \"They don't all weep,\" observed Celeste.  \"Well, in a manner o' speakin', they do,\" said Mrs. Greene, gently. \"Not real tears, maybe; but, you know, to weep over a bier, is a figger of speech; and so far as its meanin' goes, Grant's got it. And, after all, it's the meanin' that counts.\"  It was nearing sundown as they started down the Drive, and Mona proposed that they go to a tea room, and then take their guests to their several homes.  \"Oh, how pretty!\" said Mrs. Greene, as they all went into the Marie Jeannette Tea Room.  The younger girls chose chocolate, but Mrs. Greene said, \"Give me a cup of tea. There's nothing like it, to my mind. And to think of having tea in this beautiful place, all decked with posies. I'll just throw this fur a little open, but keep it over my shoulders. It looks so luxuriant that way.\"  Mona ordered dainty sandwiches and little fancy cakes--and after a pleasant half-hour they started homeward. They left Celeste at her home first, and then took Mrs. Greene to hers.  \"I live way down on East Eleventh Street,\" she said, apologetically; \"and I oughtn't to let you go clear down there with me. But,--oh, well, I might as well own up,--I'd just love to roll up to our door in this car!\"  \"And so you shall,\" said Mona, appreciating this bit of feminine vanity. \"And, Mrs. Greene, if you'll accept them, I'd like to make you a present of those furs. I don't need them, for I have several other sets, and you're very welcome to them.\"  \"My land!\" said Mrs. Greene, and then could say no more, for her voice choked, and two tears rolled down her cheeks.  \"And to think I thought you ladies were stuck up!\" she said, in a voice of contrition. \"Why, two angels straight from Heaven couldn't be more kind or whole-soulder than you two are. But, Miss Galbraith, I can't accept such a gift,--I--I ought not to.\"  Mrs. Greene was caressing the fur as she spoke, and Mona patted her hand, saying laughingly:  \"I couldn't take"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25862"],["title","The Chamber of Life (#0)"],["body","+-------------------------------------------------------+ |This etext was produced from Amazing Stories July 1962,| |a reprint from Amazing Stories October 1929.

PEYTON WERTENBAKER    _Copyright 1929 by E. P. Inc._     A Strange Awakening   My first sensation was one of sudden and intense cold--a chill that shot through my body and engulfed it like a charge of electricity. For a moment I was conscious of nothing else. Then I knew that I was sinking in cold water, and that I was fighting instinctively against the need to gasp and breathe fresh air. I kicked weakly and convulsively. I opened my eyes, and squeezed them as the bright green water stung them. Then I hung for an instant as if suspended over the depths, and began to rise. It seemed hours before I shot up into the open air again, and was drinking it deeply and thankfully into my tortured lungs. The sun touched my head warmly like the hand of a benign god.  Floating gently, I lay there for a long while before I even looked about me. There was a vague confusion in my head, as if I had just awakened from a long sleep. Some memory seemed to be fading away, something I could still feel but couldn't understand. Then it was gone, and I was alone and empty, riding on the water.  I glanced about, puzzled. Only a few yards away rose the gray stone side of the embankment, with its low parapet, and behind that the Drive. There was no one in sight--not even a car--and the open windows of the apartment houses across the Drive seemed very quiet. People slept behind them.  It was only a little after dawn. The sun, blazing and tinted with pink, had hardly risen from the horizon. The lake was still lined with dark shadows behind glittering ridges of morning sunlight, and a cool breeze played across my face, coming in from the east. Over the city, the sound of a street car rumbling into motion, rising and dying away, was like the crowing of a rooster in the country.  I shivered, and began to swim. A few strokes brought me to the embankment, and I clambered up, almost freezing as I left the water. I was fully clothed, but without a hat. Perhaps I had lost it in the lake. I stood there, dripping and chill, and suddenly I realized that I had just waked up in the water. I had no recollection of falling in, nor even of being there. I could remember nothing of the previous night.  A glance along the Drive told me where I was, at the corner of Fifty-third street. My apartment was only a few blocks away. Had I been walking in my sleep? My mind was a blank, with turbulent, dim impressions moving confusedly under the surface.         *       *       *       *       *  Trembling in the chill air, I started up the Drive. I must go home and change at once. Something came back to me--a memory of talking to some friends at the Club. But was that last night? Or months ago? It was as though I had slept for months. We had had a few drinks--could I have been drunk, and fallen into the lake on my way home? But I never took more than two or three drinks. Something had happened.  Then I remembered the stranger. We had all been sitting about the lounge, talking of something. What had we been discussing? Franklin had mentioned Einstein's new theory--we had played with that for a while, none of us with the least idea what it was about. Then the conversation had shifted slowly from one topic to another, all having to do with scientific discoveries.  Somewhere in the midst of it, Barclay had come in. He brought with him a guest--a straight, fine-looking man with a military carriage, about fifty years old. Barclay had introduced him as Mr. Melbourne. He spoke with a slight southern accent.  In some way Melbourne and I gravitated into a corner. We went on with the conversation while the others left it. They drifted into politics, drawing together about the table where the whisky stood, leaving us alone.  Melbourne had been a fascinating man to talk to. He discussed topics ranging from theories of matter to the early Cretan culture, and related them all to one dominant scientific thread. He spoke like a man of wide knowledge and experience.... As I walked up the Drive, bits of his conversation came disjointedly back to me with the clarity and significance of sentences from Spengler.  An early-morning taxi went by slowly as I crossed the Drive to my apartment. The driver stopped a moment, and looked at me in astonishment.  \"What's the matter, buddy,\" he said, \"you look all wet. Fall in the lake?\" I smiled, embarrassed.  \"Looks that way, doesn't it?\" I answered.  \"Can I take you anywhere?\"  \"No,\" I said, \"I live here.\" He grinned, and started off again.  \"Wish I'd been in on that party!\" he called back, as he drove away.  I frowned, once more with that puzzled feeling, and went in.     Melbourne's Story   Glimpses of last night came back to me and pieced themselves together slowly while I undressed and drew the water for my bath.  Melbourne had been interested to know that I worked for Bausch, the motion picture producer.  \"Perhaps you could be of aid to me some time,\" he said thoughtfully.  \"In what way, Mr. Melbourne?\" I asked him.  \"I can talk to you about that later,\" he replied cryptically. \"Tell me about your work.\"  So I told him the conception I had of the motion pictures to be made in the future. He listened with keen interest.  \"I visualize a production going beyond anything done today,\" I said, \"and yet one that would be possible now, if there were someone capable of creating it. A picture with sound and color, reproducing faithfully the ordinary life about us, its tints and voices, even the noises of the city--or traffic passing in the street and newsboys crying the scores of the afternoon games--vividly and naturally. My picture would be so carefully constructed that the projector could be stopped at any moment and the screen would show a scene as harmonious in design and composition and coloring, and as powerful in feeling, as a painting by Rockwell Kent.\" After a pause I added, \"And I'd give almost anything if I could do it myself.\"  Melbourne looked at me sympathetically, reflectively.  \"It might be possible,\" he said after a time.  \"What do you mean, Mr. Melbourne?\" He puffed at a cigar, and considered.  \"It's not something I could explain to you off-hand,\" he said. \"It's strange and it's new. It needs preparation.\"  \"I'm ready to listen,\" I said with eager interest. He smiled.  \"Perhaps I had better tell you a little of my life.\"  \"Go on,\" I answered briefly.  \"I had ideas much like yours when I was a boy,\" he began his story. \"In high school and college I had believed myself an artist. I was a good musician, and I dabbled with painting and literature. I wanted to come back for post-graduate work, though, and something attracted me to science. I had put off studying mathematics until my graduating year, only to find that it fascinated me. And I was curious about physics.         *       *       *       *       *  \"While I was studying for my Master's degree and my Doctorate, I felt the need of some interest to merge all the divergent sides of my nature. Something that would give me a chance to be both the artist and the man of science. That was a quarter of a century ago. The motion picture and the phonograph were just coming into the public eye. They seemed to supply just the field for which I felt a need.  \"I had much the same idea as yourself, except that there were no discoveries to back it--no color photography, no method for harmonizing sound and sight. Indeed, neither the screen nor the phonograph had come to be regarded yet as essentially more than a toy. But, like yourself, I had vision. And enthusiasm. And an intense desire to create.  \"After I had taken my degrees, I went to work with almost abnormal intensity. With sufficient income to live as I desired, I fitted up my laboratory and concentrated on the thing I wanted to do. I spent years at it. I gave my youth--or, at least, the best of my youth--to that labor. Long before sound and color pictures were perfected commercially, I had developed similar processes for myself. But they were not what I wanted. The real thing was beyond my grasp, and I couldn't see how to attain it.  \"I worked feverishly. I think I must have worked myself into a sort of frenzy, a sort of madness. I never mingled with people, and I became bitter and despondent. One day my nerves broke down. I smashed everything in my laboratory, all my models, all my apparatus, and I burned the plans and papers I had labored over for years.  \"My physician told me that I must rest and recuperate. He told me I must interest myself again in daily life, in people and inanimate things. So I went away. For the next few years I traveled. I tore myself away from everything scientific and plunged into the business of living. Almost overnight I became an adventurer, tasting sensations with the same ardor I had once given to my work. I went back to art, to painting and literature and music. I was a connoisseur of wines and of foods and of women. I was an experimenter with life.  \"Little by little, though, the zest of that passed away. I grew tired of my dilettantism. And eventually I found that, even while I had been moving about the world and experiencing its curious values, my mind had been grappling quietly, subconsciously, with my old problem. The change in my life had given me the wider outlook, the keener understanding necessary to the accomplishment of my task. In the end, I went back to it again with renewed vigor. With greater power, too, and greater sanity.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Melbourne paused here. Sensing his need, I"]]]
