STANDISH.   NEW YORK, April 22, 1899.     CHAPTER I.  OFF FOR EUROPE.   \"Off------\"  \"At last!\"  \"Hurrah!\"  The tramp steamer \"Eagle\" swung out from the pier and was fairly started en her journey from New York to Liverpool.  On the deck of the steamer stood a group of five persons, three of whom had given utterance to the exclamations recorded above.  On the pier swarmed a group of Yale students, waving hands, hats, handkerchiefs, bidding farewell to their five friends and acquaintances on the steamer. Over the water came the familiar Yale cheer. From the steamer it was answered.  In the midst of the group on deck was Frank Merriwell. Those around him were Bruce Browning, Jack Diamond, Harry Rattleton and Tutor Wellington Maybe.  It was Frank's scheme to spend the summer months abroad, while studying in the attempt to catch up with his class and pass examinations on re-entering college in the fall. And he had brought along his three friends, Browning, Diamond and Rattleton. They were on their way to England.  Frank was happy. Fortune had dealt him a heavy blow when he was compelled by poverty to leave dear old Yale, but he had faced the world bravely, and he had struggled like a man. Hard work, long hours and poor pay had not daunted him.  At the very start he had shown that he possessed something more than ordinary ability, and while working on the railroad he had forced his way upward step by step till it seemed that he was in a fair way to reach the top of the ladder.  Then came disaster again. He had lost his position on the railroad, and once more he was forced to face the world and begin over.  Some lads would have been discouraged. Frank Merriwell was not. He set his teeth firmly and struck out once more. He kept his mouth shut and his eyes open. The first honorable thing that came to his hand to do he did. Thus it happened that he found himself on the stage.  Frank's success as an actor had been phenomenal. Of course, to begin with, he had natural ability, but that was not the only thing that won success for him. He had courage, push, determination, stick-to-it-iveness. When he started to do a thing he kept at it till he did it.  Frank united observation and study. He learned everything he could about the stage and about acting by talking with the members of the company and by watching to see how things were done.  He had a good head and plenty of sense. He knew better than to copy after the ordinary actors in the road company to which he belonged. He had seen good acting enough to be able to distinguish between the good and bad. Thus it came about that the bad models about him did not exert a pernicious influence upon him.  Frank believed there were books that would aid him. He found them. He found one on \"Acting and Actors,\" and from it he learned that no actor ever becomes really and truly great that does not have a clear and distinct enunciation and a correct pronunciation. That is the beginning. Then comes the study of the meaning of the words to be spoken and the effect produced by the manner in which they are spoken.  He studied all this, and he went further. He read up on \"Traditions of the Stage,\" and he came to know all about its limitations and its opportunities.  From this it was a natural step to the study of the construction of plays. He found books of criticism on plays and playwriting, and he mastered them. He found books that told how to construct plays, and he mastered them.  Frank Merriwell was a person with a vivid imagination and great mechanical and constructive ability. Had this not been so, he might have studied forever and still never been able to write a successful play. In him there was something study could not give, but study and effort brought it out. He wrote a play.  \"John Smith of Montana\" was a success. Frank played the leading part, and he made a hit.  Then fate rose up and again dealt him a body blow. A scene in the play was almost exactly like a scene in another play, written previously. The author and owner of the other play called on the law to \"protect\" him. An injunction was served on Merry to restrain him from playing \"John Smith.\" He stood face to face with a lawsuit.  Frank investigated, and his investigation convinced him that it was almost certain he would be defeated if the case was carried into the courts.  He withdrew \"John Smith.\"  Frank had confidence in himself. He had written a play that was successful, and he believed he could write another. Already he had one skeletonized. The frame work was constructed, the plot was elaborated, the characters were ready for his use.  He wrote a play of something with which he was thoroughly familiar---college life. The author or play-maker of ability who writes of that with which he is familiar stands a good chance of making a success. Young and inexperienced writers love to write of those things with which they are unfamiliar, and they wonder why it is that they fail.  They go too far away from home for their subject.  At first Frank's play was not a success. The moment he discovered this he set himself down to find out why it was not a success. He did not look at it as the author, but as a critical manager to whom it had been offered might have done.  He found the weak spots. One was its name. People in general did not understand the title, \"For Old Eli.\" There was nothing \"catchy\" or drawing about it.  He gave it another name. He called it, \"True Blue: A Drama of College Life.\"  The name proved effective.  He rewrote much of the play. He strengthened the climax of the third act, and introduced a mechanical effect that was very ingenious. And when the piece next went on the road it met with wonderful success everywhere.  Thus Frank snatched success from defeat.  It is a strange thing that when a person fights against fate and conquers, when fortune begins to smile, when the tide fairly turns his way, then everything seems to come to him. The things which seemed so far away and so impossible of attainment suddenly appear within easy reach or come tumbling into his lap of their own accord.  It was much this way with Frank. He had dreamed of going back to college some time, but that time had seemed far, far away. Success brought it nearer.  But then it came tumbling into his lap. No one had been found to claim the fortune he discovered in the Utah Desert. Investigation had shown that there were no living relatives of the man who had guarded the treasure till his death. That treasure had been turned over to Frank.  Frank had brought his play to New Haven, and his old college friends had given him a rousing welcome. And now he had made plans to return to college in the fall, while his play was to be carried on the road by a well-known and experienced theatrical manager.  The friends who had been with Frank when he discovered the treasure, with the exception of Toots, the colored boy, had refused to accept shares of the fortune. Then Merry had insisted on taking them abroad with him, and here they were on the steamer \"Eagle,\" bound for Liverpool.  Toots, dressed like a \"swell,\" was on the pier. He shouted with the others, waving his silk hat.  The crowd was cheering now:       \"Beka Co ax Co ax Co ax!      Breka Co ax Co ax Co ax!        O-----up! O-----up!          Parabolou!        Yale! Yale! Yale!        'Rah! 'rah! 'rah!          Yale!\"     CHAPTER II.  SURPRISING THE FRENCHMAN.   \"Bah! Ze American boy, he make me--what you call eet?--vera tired!\"  Frank turned quickly and saw the speaker standing near the rail not far away. He was a man between thirty-five and forty years of age, dressed in a traveling suit, and having a pointed black beard. He was smoking.  An instant feeling of aversion swept over Merry. He saw the person was a supercilious Frenchman, critical, sneering, insolent, a man intolerant with everything not of France and the French.  This man was speaking to another person, who seemed to be a servant or valet, and who was very polite and fawning in all his retorts.  \"Ah! look at ze collectshung on ze pier,\" continued the sneering speaker. \"Someone say zey belong to ze great American college. Zey act like zey belong to ze--ze--what you call eet?--ze menageray. Zey yell, shout, jump--act like ze lunatic.\"  \"It is possible, monsieur,\" said Frank, with a grim smile, \"that they are copying their manners after Frenchmen at a Dreyfus demonstration.\"  The foreigner turned haughtily and stared at Frank. Then he shrugged his shoulders, turned away and observed to his companion:  \"Jes' like all ze Americans--ah!--what eez ze word?--fresh.\"  The other man bowed and rubbed his hands together.  \"Haw!\" grunted Browning, lazily. \"How do you like that, Frank?\"  \"Oh, I don't mind it,\" murmured Merry. \"I consider the source from which it came, and regard it as of no consequence.\"  Diamond was glaring at the Frenchman, for it made his hot Southern blood boil to hear a foreigner criticize anything American. Like all youthful Americans, his great admiration and love for his own country made him intolerant of criticism.  Frank had a cooler head, and he was not so easily ruffled.  Rattleton was unable to express his feelings.  Tutor Maybe looked somewhat perturbed, for he was an exceedingly mild and peaceable man, and the slightest suggestion of trouble was enough to agitate him.  But the Frenchman did not deign to look toward Frank again, and it seemed that all danger of trouble was past.  The \"Eagle\" sailed slowly down the harbor, signaling now and then to other boats.  Frank, Jack, Bruce and Harry formed a fine quartette, and they sang:       \"Soon we'll be in London town;        Sing, my lads, yo! heave, my lads, ho!      And see the queen, with her golden crown;        Heave, my lads, yo-ho!\"  The Frenchman made an impatient gesture, and showed annoyance,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10904"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Nobility; Or, The Tragedy of the Ocean Tramp (#1)"],["body","caused Frank to laugh.  Behind them Brooklyn Bridge spanned the river, looking slender and graceful, like a thing hung in the air by delicate threads.  Close at hand were Governor's Island and the Statue of Liberty. The Frenchman was pointing it out.  \"Ze greatest work of art in all America,\"' he declared, enthusiastically; \"an' France give zat to America. Ze Americans nevare think to put eet zere themselves. France do more for America zan any ozare nation, but ze Americans forget. Zey forget Lafayette. Zey forget France make it possibul for zem to conquaire Engalande an' get ze freedom zey ware aftaire. An' now zey--zey--what you call eet?--toady to Engalande. Zey pretende to love ze Engaleesh. Bah! Uncale Sam an' John Bull both need to have some of ze conaceit taken out away from zem.\"  \"It would take more than France, Spain, Italy and all the rest of the dago nations to do the job!\" spluttered Harry Rattleton, who could not keep still longer.  \"Maurel,\" said the Frenchman, speaking to his companion, \"t'row ze insolent dog ovareboard!\"  \"Oui, monsieur!\"  Quick as thought the man sprang toward Harry, as if determined to execute the command of his master.  He did not put his hands on Rattleton, for Frank was equally swift in his movements, and blocked the fellows' way, coolly saying:  \"I wouldn't try it if I were you.\"  \"Out of ze way!\" snarled the man, who was an athlete in build. \"If you don't, I put you ovare, too!\"  \"I don't think you will.\"  \"Put him ovare, Maurel,\" ordered the Frenchman, with deadly coolness.  The athletic servant clutched Frank, but, with a twist and a turn, Merry broke the hold instantly, kicked the fellow's feet from beneath him, and dropped him heavily to the deck.  Bruce Browning stooped and picked the man up as if he were an infant. Every year seemed to add something to the big collegian's wonderful strength, and now the astounded Frenchman found himself unable to wiggle.  Browning held the man over the rail turning to Frank to ask:  \"Shall I give him a bath, Merriwell?\"  \"I think you hadn't better,\" laughed Frank. \"Perhaps he can't swim, and--\"  \"He can swim or sink,\" drawled Bruce. \"It won't make any difference if he sinks. Only another insolent Frenchman out of the way.\"  The master was astounded. Up to that moment he had regarded the young Americans as scarcely more than boys and he had fancied his athletic servant could easily frighten them. Instead of that, something quite unexpected by him had happened.  The astounded servant showed signs of terror, but in vain he struggled. He was helpless in the clutch of the giant collegian.  The master seemed about to interfere, but Frank Merriwell confronted him in a manner that spoke as plainly as words.  \"Out of ze way!\" snarled the man.  \"Speaking to me?\" inquired Merry, lifting his eyebrows.  \"Oui! oui!\"  \"I am sorry, but I can't accommodate you till my friend gets through with your servant, who was extremely fresh, like most Frenchmen.\"  \"Zis to me!\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Sare, I am M. Rouen Montfort, an' I--\"  \"It makes no difference to me if you are the high mogul of France. You are on the deck of an English vessel, and you are dealing with Americans.\"  The Frenchman flung his cigar aside and seemed to feel for a weapon.  Frank stood there quietly, his eyes watching every movement.  \"If you have what you are seeking about your person,\" he said, with perfect calmness, \"I advise you not to draw it. If you do, as sure as you are sailing down New York harbor, I'll fling you over the rail, weapon and all!\"  That was business, and it was not boasting. Frank actually meant to throw the man into the water if he drew a weapon.  M. Rouen Montfort paused and stared at Frank Merriwell, beginning to understand that he was not dealing with an ordinary youth.  \"Fool!\" he panted. \"You geeve me ze eensult I will haf your life!\"  \"You have already insulted me, my friends and everything American. It's your turn to take a little of the medicine.\"  \"Eef we were een France--\"  \"Which we are not. We are still in America, the land of the free. But I don't care to have a quarrel with you. Bruce put the fellow down. If he minds his business in the future, don't throw him overboard.\"  \"All right,\" grunted the big fellow; \"but I was just going to drop him in the wet.\"  He put the man down, and the fellow seemed undecided what to do.  Harry Rattleton laughed.  \"Now wake a talk--no, I mean take a walk,\" he cried. \"It will be a good thing for your health.\"  \"Come, Maurel,\" said the master, with an attempt at dignity; \"come away from ze fellows!\"  Maurel was glad enough to do so. He had thought to frighten the youths without the least trouble, but had been handled with such ease that even after it was all over he wondered how it could have happened.  M. Montfort walked away with great dignity, and Maurel followed, talking savagely and swiftly in French.  \"Well, it wasn't very hard to settle them,\" grinned Browning.  \"But we have not settled them,\" declared Frank. \"There will be further trouble with M. Rouen Montfort and his man Maurel.\"     CHAPTER III.  A FRESH YOUNG MAN.   Frank and his three friends bad a stateroom together. The tutor was given a room with other parties.  The weather for the first two days was fine, and the young collegians enjoyed every minute, not one of them having a touch of sea-sickness till the third day.  Then Rattleton was seized, and he lay in his bunk, groaning and dismal, even though he tried to be cheerful at times.  Browning enjoyed everything, even Rattleton's misery, for he could be lazy to his heart's content.  They had enlivened the times by singing songs, those of a nautical flavor, such as \"Larboard Watch\" and \"A Life on the Ocean Wave,\" having the preference.  Now it happened that the Frenchman occupied a room adjoining, and he was very much annoyed by their singing. He pounded on the partition, and expressed his feelings in very lurid language, but that amused them, and they sang the louder.  \"M. Montfort seems to get very agitated,\" said Frank, laughing.  \"But I hardly think there is any danger that he will do more than hammer on the partition,\" grunted Bruce. \"He's kept away from us since he found he could not frighten anybody.\"  \"He's a bluffer,\" was Diamond's opinion.  \"He's a great fellow to play cards,\" said Merry. \"But he seems to ply for something more than amusement.\"  \"How's that?\" asked Jack, interested.  \"I've noticed that he never cares for whist or any game where there are no stakes. He gets into a game only when there's something to be won.\"  \"Well, it seems to me that he's struck a poor crowd on this boat if he's looking for suckers. He should have shipped on an ocean liner. What does he play?\"  \"He seems to have taken a great fancy to draw poker. 'Pocaire' is what he calls it. He pretended at first that he didn't know much of anything about the game, but, if I am not mistaken, he's an old stager at it. I watched the party playing in the smoking-room last night.\"  \"Who played?\" asked Bruce.  \"The Frenchman, a rather sporty young fellow named Bloodgood, a small, bespectacled man, well fitted with the name of Slush, and an Englishman by the name of Hazleton.\"  \"That's the crowd that played in the Frenchman's stateroom to-day,\" groaned Rattleton from his berth.  \"Played in the stateroom?\" exclaimed Frank. \"I wonder why they didn't play in the smoking-room?\"  \"Don't know,\" said Harry; \"but I fancy there was a rather big game on, and you know the Frenchman has the biggest stateroom on the boat, so there was plenty of room for them. They could play there without interruption.\"  \"There seems to be something mysterious about that Frenchman,\" said Frank.  \"I think there's something mysterious about several passengers on this boat,\" grunted Browning. \"I haven't seen much of this young fellow Bloodgood, but he strikes me as a mystery.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well he seems to have money to burn, and I don't understand why such a fellow did not take passage on a regular liner.\"  \"As far as that goes,\" smiled Merry, \"I presume some people might think it rather singular that we did not cross the pond in a regular liner; but then they might suppose it was a case of economy with us.\"  While they were talking there came a rap on their door which Frank threw open.  Just outside stood a young man with a flushed face and distressed appearance. He was dressed in a plaid suit, and wore a red four-in-hand necktie, in which blazed a huge diamond. There were two large solitaire rings on his left hand, and he wore a heavy gold chain strung across his vest.  \"Beg your pardon, dear boys,\" he drawled. \"Hope I'm not intruding.\"  Then he walked in and closed the door.  \"My name's Bloodgood,\" he said--\"Raymond Bloodgood. I've seen you fellows together, and you seem like a jolly lot. Heard you singing, you know. Great voices--good singing.\"  Then he stopped speaking, and they stared at him, wondering what he was driving at. For a moment there was an awkward pause, and then Bloodgood went on:  \"I was up pretty late last night, you know. Had a little game in the smoking-room. Plenty of booze, and all that, and I'm awfully rocky to-day. Got a splitting headache. Didn't know but some of you had a bromo seltzer, or something of the sort. You look like a crowd that finds such things handy occasionally.\"  At this Frank laughed quietly, but Diamond looked angry and indignant.  \"What do you take us for?\" exclaimed the Virginian, warmly. \"Do you think we are a lot of boozers?\"  Bloodgood turned on Jack, lifting his eyebrows.  \"My dear fellow--\" he began.  But Frank put in:  \"We have no use for bromo seltzer, as none of us are drinkers.\"  \"Oh, of course not,\" said the intruder, with something like a sneer. \"None of us are drinkers, but then we're all liable to get a little too much sometimes, especially when we sit up late and play poker.\"  Frank saw that Diamond had taken an instant dislike to the youth with the diamonds and the red necktie, and he felt like averting"]]]
