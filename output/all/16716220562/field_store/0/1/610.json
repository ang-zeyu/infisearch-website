A neighbor was willing to pay fifteen dollars for this, and Mrs. Harding, with her husband's consent, agreed to part with it.  \"If ever we are able we will buy another,\" said Timothy.  \"And, at any rate, we can do without it,\" said his wife.  \"Rachel will miss it.\"  \"She said the other day that it was not comfortable, and ought never to have been bought; that it was a shameful waste of money.\"  \"In that case she won't be disturbed by our selling it.\"  \"No, I should think not; but it's hard to tell how Rachel will take anything.\"  This remark was amply verified.  The sofa was removed while the spinster was out, and without any hint to her of what was going to happen. When she returned, she looked around for it with surprise.  \"Where's the sofy?\" she asked.  \"We've sold it to Mrs. Stoddard,\" said Mrs. Harding, cheerfully.  \"Sold it!\" echoed Rachel, dolefully.  \"Yes; we felt that we didn't need it, and we did need money. She offered me fifteen dollars for it, and I accepted.\"  Rachel sat down in a rocking-chair, and began straightway to show signs of great depression of spirits.  \"Life's full of disappointments!\" she groaned. \"Our paths is continually beset by 'em. There's that sofa. It's so pleasant to have one in the house when a body's sick. But, there, it's gone, and if I happen to get down, as most likely I shall, for I've got a bad feeling in my stummick this very minute, I shall have to go upstairs, and most likely catch my death of cold, and that will be the end of me.\"  \"Not so bad as that, I hope,\" said Mrs. Harding, cheerfully. \"You know when you was sick last, you didn't want to use the sofa; you said it didn't lay comfortable. Besides, I hope before you are sick we may be able to buy it back again.\"  Aunt Rachel shook her head despondingly.  \"There ain't any use in hoping that,\" she said. \"Timothy's got so much behindhand that he won't be able to get up again; I know he won't!\"  \"But, if he only manages to find steady work soon, he will.\"  \"No, he won't,\" said Rachel, positively. \"I'm sure he won't. There won't be any work before spring, and most likely not then.\"  \"You are too desponding, Aunt Rachel.\"  \"Enough to make me so. If you had only taken my advice, we shouldn't have come to this.\"  \"I don't know what advice you refer to, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Harding, patiently.  \"No, I don't expect you do. My words don't make no impression. You didn't pay no attention to what I said, that's the reason.\"  \"But if you'll repeat the advice, Rachel, perhaps we can still profit by it,\" answered Mrs. Harding, with imperturbable good humor.  \"I told you you ought to be layin' up something agin' a rainy day. But that's always the way. Folks think when times is good it's always a-goin' to be so, but I know better.\"  \"I don't see how we could have been much more economical,\" said Mrs. Harding, mildly.  \"There's a hundred ways. Poor folks like us ought not to expect to have meat so often. It's frightful to think what the butcher's bill must have been for the last two months.\"  Inconsistent Rachel! Only the day before she had made herself very uncomfortable because there was no meat for dinner, and said she couldn't live without it. Mrs. Harding might have reminded her of this, but the good woman was too kind and forbearing to make the retort. She really pitied Rachel for her unhappy habit of despondency. So she contented herself by saying that they must try to do better in future.  \"That's always the way,\" muttered Rachel; \"shut the stable door after the horse is stolen. Folks never learn from experience till it's too late to be of any use. I don't see what the world was made for, for my part. Everything goes topsy-turvy, and all sorts of ways except the right way. I sometimes think 'tain't much use livin'!\"  \"Oh, you'll feel better by and by, Rachel.\"  \"No, I shan't; I feel my health's declinin' every day. I don't know how I can stand it when I have to go to the poorhouse.\"  \"We haven't gone there yet, Rachel.\"  \"No, but it's comin' soon. We can't live on nothin'.\"  \"Hark, there's Jack coming,\" said his mother, hearing a quick step outside.  \"Yes, he's whistlin' just as if nothin' was the matter. He don't care anything for the awful condition of the family.\"  \"You're wrong there, Rachel; Jack is trying every day to get something to do. He wants to do his part.\"  Rachel would have made a reply disparaging to Jack, but she had no chance, for our hero broke in at this instant.  \"Well, Jack?\" said his mother, inquiringly.  \"I've got a plan, mother,\" he said.  \"What's a boy's plan worth?\" sniffed Aunt Rachel.  \"Oh, don't be always hectorin' me, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, impatiently.  \"Hectorin'! Is that the way my own nephew talks to me?\"  \"Well, it's so. You don't give a feller a chance. I'll tell you what I'm thinking of, mother. I've been talkin' with Tom Blake; he sells papers, and he tells me he makes sometimes a dollar a day. Isn't that good?\"  \"Yes, that is very good wages for a boy.\"  \"I want to try it, too; but I've got to buy the papers first, you know, and I haven't got any money. So, if you'll lend me fifty cents, I'll try it this afternoon.\"  \"You think you can sell them, Jack?\"  \"I know I can. I'm as smart as Tom Blake, any day.\"  \"Pride goes before a fall!\" remarked Rachel, by way of a damper. \"Disappointment is the common lot.\"  \"That's just the way all the time,\" said Jack, provoked.  \"I've lived longer than you,\" began Aunt Rachel.  \"Yes, a mighty lot longer,\" interrupted Jack. \"I don't deny that.\"  \"Now you're sneerin' at me on account of my age, Jack. Martha, how can you allow such things?\"  \"Be respectful, Jack.\"  \"Then tell Aunt Rachel not to aggravate me so. Will you let me have the fifty cents, mother?\"  \"Yes, Jack. I think your plan is worth trying.\"  She took out half a dollar from her pocketbook and handed it to Jack.  \"All right, mother. I'll see what I can do with it.\"  Jack went out, and Rachel looked more gloomy than ever.  \"You'll never see that money again, you may depend on't, Martha,\" she said.  \"Why not, Rachel?\"  \"Because Jack'll spend it for candy, or in some other foolish way.\"  \"You are unjust, Rachel. Jack is not that kind of boy.\"  \"I'd ought to know him. I've had chances enough.\"  \"You never knew him to do anything dishonest.\"  \"I suppose he's a model boy?\"  \"No, he isn't. He's got faults enough, I admit; but he wouldn't spend for his own pleasure money given him for buying papers.\"  \"If he buys the papers, I don't believe he can sell them, so the money's wasted anyway,\" said Rachel, trying another tack.  \"We will wait and see,\" said Mrs. Harding.  She saw that Rachel was in one of her unreasonable moods, and that it was of no use to continue the discussion.     CHAPTER IV  MRS. HARDING TAKES A BOARDER   Jack started for the newspaper offices and bought a supply of papers.  \"I don't see why I can't sell papers as well as other boys,\" he said to himself. \"I'm going to try, at any rate.\"  He thought it prudent, however, not to buy too large stock at first. He might sell them all, but then again he might get \"stuck\" on a part, and this might take away all his profits.  Jack, however, was destined to find that in the newspaper business, as well as in others, there was no lack of competition. He took his place just below the Astor House, and began to cry his papers. This aroused the ire of a rival newsboy a few feet away.  \"Get away from here!\" he exclaimed, scowling at Jack.  \"What for?\" said Jack.  \"This is my stand.\"  \"Keep it, then. This is mine,\" retorted Jack, composedly.  \"I don't allow no other newsboys in this block,\" said the other.  \"Don't you? You ain't the city government, are you?\"  \"I don't want any of your impudence. Clear out!\"  \"Clear out yourself!\"  \"I'll give you a lickin'!\"  \"Perhaps you will when you're able.\"  Jack spoke manfully; but the fact was that the other boy probably was able, being three years older, and as many inches taller.  Jack kept on crying his papers, and his opponent, incensed at the contemptuous disregard of his threats, advanced toward him, and, taking Jack unawares, pushed him off the sidewalk with such violence that he nearly fell flat. Jack felt that the time for action had arrived. He dropped his papers temporarily on the sidewalk, and, lowering his head, butted against his young enemy with such force as to double him up, and seat him, gasping for breath, on the sidewalk. Tom Rafferty, for this was his name, looked up in astonishment at the unexpected form of the attack.  \"Well done, my lad!\" said a hearty voice.  Jack turned toward the speaker, and saw a stout man dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons. He was dark and bronzed with exposure to the weather, and there was something about him which plainly indicated the sailor.  \"Well done, my lad!\" he repeated. \"You know how to pay off your debts.\"  \"I try to,\" said Jack, modestly. \"But where's my papers?\"  The papers, which he had dropped, had disappeared. One of the boys who had seen the fracas had seized the opportunity to make off with them, and poor Jack was in the position of a merchant who had lost his stock in trade.  \"Who took them papers?\" he asked, looking about him.  \"I saw a boy run off with them,\" said a bystander.  \"I'm glad of it,\" said Tom Rafferty, sullenly.  Jack looked as if he was ready to pitch into him again, but the sailor interfered.  \"Don't mind the papers, my lad. What were they worth?\"  \"I gave twenty cents for 'em.\"  \"Then here's thirty.\"  \"I don't think I ought to take it,\" said Jack. \"It's my loss.\"  \"Take it, my boy. It won't ruin me. I've got plenty more behind.\"  \"Thank you, sir; I'll go and buy some more papers.\"  \"Not to-night. I want you to take a cruise with me.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  \"I suppose you'd like to know who I am?\" said the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10729"],["title","Jack's Ward; Or, The Boy Guardian (#3)"],["body","lor, as they moved off together.  \"I suppose you're a sailor.\"  \"You can tell that by the cut of my jib. Yes, my lad, I'm captain of the _Argo_, now in port. It's a good while since I've been in York. For ten years I've been plying between Liverpool and Calcutta. Now I've got absence to come over here.\"  \"Are you an American, sir?\"  \"Yes; I was raised in Connecticut, but then I began going to sea when I was only thirteen. I only arrived to-day, and I find the city changed since ten years ago, when I used to know it.\"  \"Where are you staying--at what hotel?\"  \"I haven't gone to any yet; I used to stay with a cousin of mine, but he's moved. Do you know any good boarding place, where they'd make me feel at home, and let me smoke a pipe after dinner?\"  An idea struck Jack. They had an extra room at home, or could make one by his sleeping in the sitting room. Why shouldn't they take the stranger to board? The money would certainly be acceptable. He determined to propose it.  \"If we lived in a nicer house,\" he said, \"I'd ask you to board at my mother's.\"  \"Would she take me, my lad?\"  \"I think she would; but we are poor, and live in a small house.\"  \"That makes no odds. I ain't a bit particular, as long as I can feel at home. So heave ahead, my lad, and we'll go and see this mother of yours, and hear what she has to say about it.\"  Jack took the way home well pleased, and, opening the front door, entered the sitting room, followed by the sailor.  Aunt Rachel looked up nervously, and exclaimed: \"A man!\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said the stranger. \"I'm a man, and no mistake. Are you this lad's mother?\"  \"No, sir!\" answered Rachel, emphatically. \"I am nobody's mother.\"  \"Oh, an old maid!\" said the sailor, whose mode of life had made him unceremonious.  \"I am a spinster,\" said Rachel, with dignity.  \"That's the same thing,\" said the visitor, sitting down opposite Aunt Rachel, who eyed him suspiciously.  \"My aunt, Rachel Harding, Capt. Bowling,\" introduced Jack. \"Aunt Rachel, Capt. Bowling is the commander of a vessel now in port.\"  Aunt Rachel made a stiff courtesy, and Capt. Bowling eyed her curiously.  \"Are you fond of knitting, ma'am?\" he asked.  \"I am not fond of anything,\" said Rachel, mournfully. \"We should not set our affections upon earthly things.\"  \"You wouldn't say that if you had a beau, ma'am,\" said Capt. Bowling, facetiously.  \"A beau!\" repeated Rachel, horror-stricken.  \"Yes, ma'am. I suppose you've had a beau some time or other.\"  \"I don't think it proper to talk on such a subject to a stranger,\" said Aunt Rachel, primly.  \"Law, ma'am, you needn't be so particular.\"  Just at this moment, Mrs. Harding entered the room, and was introduced to Capt. Bowling by Jack. The captain proceeded to business at once.  \"Your son, here, ma'am, told me you might maybe swing a hammock for me somewhere in your house. I liked his looks, and here I am.\"  \"Do you think you would be satisfied with our plain fare, and humble dwelling, Capt. Bowling?\"  \"I ain't hard to suit, ma'am; so, if you can take me, I'll stay.\"  His manner was frank, although rough; and Mrs. Harding cheerfully consented to do so. It was agreed that Bowling should pay five dollars a week for the three or four weeks he expected to stay.  \"I'll be back in an hour,\" said the new boarder. \"I've got a little business to attend to before supper.\"  When he had gone out, Aunt Rachel began to cough ominously. Evidently some remonstrance was coming.  \"Martha,\" she said, solemnly, \"I'm afraid you've done wrong in taking that sailor man.\"  \"Why, Rachel?\"  \"He's a strange man.\"  \"I don't see anything strange about him,\" said Jack.  \"He spoke to me about having a beau,\" said Aunt Rachel, in a shocked tone.  Jack burst into a fit of hearty laughter. \"Perhaps he's going to make you an offer, Aunt Rachel,\" he said. \"He wants to see if there's anybody in the way.\"  Rachel did not appear so very indignant.  \"It was improper for a stranger to speak to me on that subject,\" she said, mildly.  \"You must make allowances for the bluntness of a sailor,\" said Mrs. Harding.  For some reason Rachel did not seem as low-spirited as usual that evening. Capt. Bowling entertained them with narratives of his personal adventures, and it was later than usual when the lamps were put out, and they were all in bed.     CHAPTER V  THE CAPTAIN'S DEPARTURE   \"Jack,\" said the captain, at breakfast, the next morning, \"how would you like to go round with me to see my vessel?\"  \"I'll go,\" said Jack, promptly.  \"Very likely he'll fall over into the water and be drowned,\" suggested Aunt Rachel, cheerfully.  \"I'll take care of that, ma'am,\" said Capt. Bowling. \"Won't you come yourself?\"  \"I go to see a vessel!\" repeated Rachel.  \"Yes; why not?\"  \"I am afraid it wouldn't be proper to go with a stranger,\" said Rachel, with a high sense of propriety.  \"I'll promise not to run away with you,\" said the captain, bluntly. \"If I should attempt it, Jack, here, would interfere.\"  \"No, I wouldn't,\" said Jack. \"It wouldn't be proper for me to interfere with Aunt Rachel's plans.\"  \"You seem to speak as if your aunt proposed to run away,\" said Mr. Harding, jocosely.  \"You shouldn't speak of such things, nephew; I am shocked,\" said Rachel.  \"Then you won't go, ma'am?\" asked the captain.  \"If I thought it was consistent with propriety,\" said Rachel, hesitating. \"What do you think, Martha?\"  \"I think there is no objection,\" said Mrs. Harding, secretly amazed at Rachel's entertaining the idea.  The result was that Miss Rachel put on her things, and accompanied the captain. She was prevailed on to take the captain's arm at length, greatly to Jack's amusement. He was still more amused when a boy picked up her handkerchief which she had accidentally dropped, and, restoring it to the captain, said, \"Here's your wife's handkerchief, gov'nor.\"  \"Ho! ho!\" laughed the captain. \"He takes you for my wife, ma'am.\"  \"Ho! ho!\" echoed Jack, equally amused.  Aunt Rachel turned red with confusion. \"I am afraid I ought not to have come,\" she murmured. \"I feel ready to drop.\"  \"You'd better not drop just yet,\" said the captain--they were just crossing the street--\"wait till it isn't so muddy.\"  On the whole, Aunt Rachel decided not to drop.  The _Argo_ was a medium-sized vessel, and Jack in particular was pleased with his visit. Though not outwardly so demonstrative, Aunt Rachel also seemed to enjoy the expedition. The captain, though blunt, was attentive, and it was something new to her to have such an escort. It was observed that Miss Harding was much less gloomy than usual during the remainder of the day. It might be that the captain's cheerfulness was contagious. For a stranger, Aunt Rachel certainly conversed with him with a freedom remarkable for her.  \"I never saw Rachel so cheerful,\" remarked Mrs. Harding to her husband that evening after they had retired. \"She hasn't once spoken of life being a vale of tears to-day.\"  \"It's the captain,\" said her husband. \"He has such spirits that it seems to enliven all of us.\"  \"I wish we could have him for a permanent boarder.\"  \"Yes; the five dollars a week which he pays are a great help, especially now that I am out of work.\"  \"What is the prospect of getting work soon?\"  \"I am hoping for it from day to day, but it may be weeks yet.\"  \"Jack earned fifty cents to-day by selling papers.\"  \"His daily earnings are an important help. With what the captain pays us, it is enough to pay all our living expenses. But there's one thing that troubles me.\"  \"The rent?\"  \"Yes, it is due in three weeks, and as yet I haven't a dollar laid by to meet it. It makes me feel anxious.\"  \"Don't lose your trust in Providence, Timothy. He may yet carry us over this difficulty.\"  \"So I hope, but I can't help feeling in what straits we shall be, if some help does not come.\"  Two weeks later, Capt. Bowling sailed for Liverpool.  \"I hope we shall see you again sometime, captain,\" said Mrs. Harding.  \"Whenever I come back to New York, I shall come here if you'll keep me,\" said the bluff sailor.  \"Aunt Rachel will miss you, captain,\" said Jack, slyly.  Capt. Bowling turned to the confused spinster.  \"I hope she will,\" said he, heartily. \"Perhaps when I see her again, she'll have a husband.\"  \"Oh, Capt. Bowling, how can you say such things?\" gasped Rachel, who, as the time for the captain's departure approached, had been subsiding into her old melancholy. \"There's other things to think of in this vale of tears.\"  \"Are there? Well, if they're gloomy, I don't want to think of 'em. Jack, my lad, I wish you were going to sail with me.\"  \"So do I,\" said Jack.  \"He's my only boy, captain,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"I couldn't part with him.\"  \"I don't blame you, ma'am, not a particle; though there's the making of a sailor in Jack.\"  \"If he went away, he'd never come back,\" said Rachel, lugubriously.  \"I don't know about that, ma'am. I've been a sailor, man and boy, forty years, and here I am, well and hearty to-day.\"  \"The captain is about your age, isn't he, Aunt Rachel?\" said Jack, maliciously.  \"I'm only thirty-nine,\" said Rachel, sharply.  \"Then I must have been under a mistake all my life,\" said the cooper to himself. \"Rachel's forty-seven, if she's a day.\"  This remark he prudently kept to himself, or a fit of hysterics would probably have been the result.  \"I wouldn't have taken you for a day over thirty-five, ma'am,\" said the captain, gallantly.  Rachel actually smiled, but mildly disclaimed the compliment.  \"If it hadn't been for my trials and troubles,\" she said, \"I might have looked younger; but they are only to be expected. It's the common lot.\"  \"Is it?\" said the captain. \"I can't say I've been troubled much that way. With a stout heart and a good conscience we ought to be jolly.\"  \"Who of us has a good conscience?\" asked Rachel, in a melancholy tone.  \"I have, Aunt Rachel,\" answered Jack.  \"You?\" she exclaimed, indignantly. \"You, that tied a tin kettle to a dog's tail yesterday, and chased the poor cat till she almost died of"]]]
