The men were soon reclothed and also well fed, an abundance of ammunition was brought up, and a cheerfulness prevailed not before enjoyed in many weeks.  Neither officers nor men looked upon themselves any longer as doomed.  The weak and languid appearance of the troops, so visible before, disappeared at once.  I do not know what the effect was on the other side, but assume it must have been correspondingly depressing.  Mr. Davis had visited Bragg but a short time before, and must have perceived our condition to be about as Bragg described it in his subsequent report.  \"These dispositions,\" he said, \"faithfully sustained, insured the enemy's speedy evacuation of Chattanooga for want of food and forage.  Possessed of the shortest route to his depot, and the one by which reinforcements must reach him, we held him at our mercy, and his destruction was only a question of time.\"  But the dispositions were not \"faithfully sustained,\" and I doubt not but thousands of men engaged in trying to \"sustain\" them now rejoice that they were not.  There was no time during the rebellion when I did not think, and often say, that the South was more to be benefited by its defeat than the North.  The latter had the people, the institutions, and the territory to make a great and prosperous nation.  The former was burdened with an institution abhorrent to all civilized people not brought up under it, and one which degraded labor, kept it in ignorance, and enervated the governing class. With the outside world at war with this institution, they could not have extended their territory.  The labor of the country was not skilled, nor allowed to become so.  The whites could not toil without becoming degraded, and those who did were denominated \"poor white trash.\"  The system of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the people poor.  The non-slaveholders would have left the country, and the small slaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbor.  Soon the slaves would have outnumbered the masters, and, not being in sympathy with them, would have risen in their might and exterminated them.  The war was expensive to the South as well as to the North, both in blood and treasure, but it was worth all it cost.  The enemy was surprised by the movements which secured to us a line of supplies.  He appreciated its importance, and hastened to try to recover the line from us.  His strength on Lookout Mountain was not equal to Hooker's command in the valley below.  From Missionary Ridge he had to march twice the distance we had from Chattanooga, in order to reach Lookout Valley; but on the night of the 28th and 29th an attack was made on Geary at Wauhatchie by Longstreet's corps.  When the battle commenced, Hooker ordered Howard up from Brown's Ferry.  He had three miles to march to reach Geary.  On his way he was fired upon by rebel troops from a foot-hill to the left of the road and from which the road was commanded.  Howard turned to the left, charged up the hill and captured it before the enemy had time to intrench, taking many prisoners.  Leaving sufficient men to hold this height, he pushed on to reinforce Geary.  Before he got up, Geary had been engaged for about three hours against a vastly superior force.  The night was so dark that the men could not distinguish one from another except by the light of the flashes of their muskets.  In the darkness and uproar Hooker's teamsters became frightened and deserted their teams.  The mules also became frightened, and breaking loose from their fastenings stampeded directly towards the enemy.  The latter, no doubt, took this for a charge, and stampeded in turn.  By four o'clock in the morning the battle had entirely ceased, and our \"cracker line\" was never afterward disturbed.  In securing possession of Lookout Valley, Smith lost one man killed and four or five wounded.  The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry, captured.  In the night engagement of the 28th-9th Hooker lost 416 killed and wounded.  I never knew the loss of the enemy, but our troops buried over one hundred and fifty of his dead and captured more than a hundred.  After we had secured the opening of a line over which to bring our supplies to the army, I made a personal inspection to see the situation of the pickets of the two armies.  As I have stated, Chattanooga Creek comes down the centre of the valley to within a mile or such a matter of the town of Chattanooga, then bears off westerly, then north-westerly, and enters the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain.  This creek, from its mouth up to where it bears off west, lay between the two lines of pickets, and the guards of both armies drew their water from the same stream.  As I would be under short-range fire and in an open country, I took nobody with me, except, I believe, a bugler, who stayed some distance to the rear.  I rode from our right around to our left. When I came to the camp of the picket guard of our side, I heard the call, \"Turn out the guard for the commanding general.\"  I replied, \"Never mind the guard,\" and they were dismissed and went back to their tents. Just back of these, and about equally distant from the creek, were the guards of the Confederate pickets.  The sentinel on their post called out in like manner, \"Turn out the guard for the commanding general,\" and, I believe, added, \"General Grant.\"  Their line in a moment front-faced to the north, facing me, and gave a salute, which I returned.  The most friendly relations seemed to exist between the pickets of the two armies.  At one place there was a tree which had fallen across the stream, and which was used by the soldiers of both armies in drawing water for their camps.  General Longstreet's corps was stationed there at the time, and wore blue of a little different shade from our uniform. Seeing a soldier in blue on this log, I rode up to him, commenced conversing with him, and asked whose corps he belonged to.  He was very polite, and, touching his hat to me, said he belonged to General Longstreet's corps.  I asked him a few questions--but not with a view of gaining any particular information--all of which he answered, and I rode off.    CHAPTER XLII.  CONDITION OF THE ARMY--REBUILDING THE RAILROAD--GENERAL BURNSIDE'S SITUATION--ORDERS FOR BATTLE--PLANS FOR THE ATTACK--HOOKER'S POSITION --SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS.  Having got the Army of the Cumberland in a comfortable position, I now began to look after the remainder of my new command. Burnside was in about as desperate a condition as the Army of the Cumberland had been, only he was not yet besieged.  He was a hundred miles from the nearest possible base, Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, and much farther from any railroad we had possession of.  The roads back were over mountains, and all supplies along the line had long since been exhausted.  His animals, too, had been starved, and their carcasses lined the road from Cumberland Gap, and far back towards Lexington, Ky. East Tennessee still furnished supplies of beef, bread and forage, but it did not supply ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, or small rations, such as coffee, sugar, salt and rice.  Sherman had started from Memphis for Corinth on the 11th of October. His instructions required him to repair the road in his rear in order to bring up supplies.  The distance was about three hundred and thirty miles through a hostile country.  His entire command could not have maintained the road if it had been completed.  The bridges had all been destroyed by the enemy, and much other damage done.  A hostile community lived along the road; guerilla bands infested the country, and more or less of the cavalry of the enemy was still in the West.  Often Sherman's work was destroyed as soon as completed, and he only a short distance away.  The Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee River at Eastport, Mississippi.  Knowing the difficulty Sherman would have to supply himself from Memphis, I had previously ordered supplies sent from St. Louis on small steamers, to be convoyed by the navy, to meet him at Eastport.  These he got.  I now ordered him to discontinue his work of repairing roads and to move on with his whole force to Stevenson, Alabama, without delay.  This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger, who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over Muscle Shoals; it was delivered at Iuka on the 27th.  In this Sherman was notified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland, East Tennessee, and might be going to Nashville, in which event his troops were in the best position to beat them there.  Sherman, with his characteristic promptness, abandoned the work he was engaged upon and pushed on at once.  On the 1st of November he crossed the Tennessee at Eastport, and that day was in Florence, Alabama, with the head of column, while his troops were still crossing at Eastport, with Blair bringing up the rear.  Sherman's force made an additional army, with cavalry, artillery, and trains, all to be supplied by the single track road from Nashville.  All indications pointed also to the probable necessity of supplying Burnside's command in East Tennessee, twenty-five thousand more, by the same route.  A single track could not do this.  I gave, therefore, an order to Sherman to halt General G. M. Dodge's command, of about eight thousand men, at Athens, and subsequently directed the latter to arrange his troops along the railroad from Decatur north towards Nashville, and to rebuild that road.  The road from Nashville to Decatur passes over a broken country, cut up with innumerable streams, many of them of considerable width, and with valleys far below the road-bed.  All the bridges over these had been destroyed, and the rails taken up and twisted by the enemy.  All the cars and locomotives not carried off had been destroyed as effectually as they knew how to destroy them.  All bridges and culverts "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1068"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant â€” Volume 2 (#4)"],["body","been destroyed between Nashville and Decatur, and thence to Stevenson, where the Memphis and Charleston and the Nashville and Chattanooga roads unite.  The rebuilding of this road would give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply the army.  From Bridgeport, a short distance farther east, the river supplements the road.  General Dodge, besides being a most capable soldier, was an experienced railroad builder.  He had no tools to work with except those of the pioneers--axes, picks, and spades.  With these he was able to intrench his men and protect them against surprises by small parties of the enemy.  As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completed back to Nashville, the first matter to consider after protecting his men was the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country.  He had his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find, or all they needed, and all the cattle for beef, and such other food as could be found.  Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills along the line of the army.  When these were not near enough to the troops for protection they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road. Blacksmith shops, with all the iron and steel found in them, were moved up in like manner.  Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making the tools necessary in railroad and bridge building.  Axemen were put to work getting out timber for bridges and cutting fuel for locomotives when the road should be completed.  Car-builders were set to work repairing the locomotives and cars.  Thus every branch of railroad building, making tools to work with, and supplying the workmen with food, was all going on at once, and without the aid of a mechanic or laborer except what the command itself furnished.  But rails and cars the men could not make without material, and there was not enough rolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its full capacity.  There were no rails except those in use.  To supply these deficiencies I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had at Vicksburg to be sent to Nashville, and all the cars he had except ten. I also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river and on the Memphis and Charleston road, and ordered the cars, locomotives and rails from all the railroads except the Memphis and Charleston to Nashville.  The military manager of railroads also was directed to furnish more rolling stock and, as far as he could, bridge material. General Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days after receiving his orders.  The number of bridges to rebuild was one hundred and eighty-two, many of them over deep and wide chasms; the length of road repaired was one hundred and two miles.  The enemy's troops, which it was thought were either moving against Burnside or were going to Nashville, went no farther than Cleveland. Their presence there, however, alarmed the authorities at Washington, and, on account of our helpless condition at Chattanooga, caused me much uneasiness.  Dispatches were constantly coming, urging me to do something for Burnside's relief; calling attention to the importance of holding East Tennessee; saying the President was much concerned for the protection of the loyal people in that section, etc.  We had not at Chattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery, much less a supply train.  Reinforcements could not help Burnside, because he had neither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them; hardly, indeed, bread and meat for the men he had.  There was no relief possible for him except by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and about Chattanooga.  On the 4th of November Longstreet left our front with about fifteen thousand troops, besides Wheeler's cavalry, five thousand more, to go against Burnside.  The situation seemed desperate, and was more aggravating because nothing could be done until Sherman should get up. The authorities at Washington were now more than ever anxious for the safety of Burnside's army, and plied me with dispatches faster than ever, urging that something should be done for his relief.  On the 7th, before Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville, I ordered Thomas peremptorily to attack the enemy's right, so as to force the return of the troops that had gone up the valley.  I directed him to take mules, officers' horses, or animals wherever he could get them to move the necessary artillery.  But he persisted in the declaration that he could not move a single piece of artillery, and could not see how he could possibly comply with the order.  Nothing was left to be done but to answer Washington dispatches as best I could; urge Sherman forward, although he was making every effort to get forward, and encourage Burnside to hold on, assuring him that in a short time he should be relieved.  All of Burnside's dispatches showed the greatest confidence in his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out. He even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he held south and west of Knoxville, so as to draw the enemy farther from his base and make it more difficult for him to get back to Chattanooga when the battle should begin.  Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon; but from there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains. Burnside's suggestion, therefore, was a good one, and it was adopted.  On the 14th I telegraphed him:  \"Sherman's advance has reached Bridgeport.  His whole force will be ready to move from there by Tuesday at farthest.  If you can hold Longstreet in check until he gets up, or by skirmishing and falling back can avoid serious loss to yourself and gain time, I will be able to force the enemy back from here and place a force between Longstreet and Bragg that must inevitably make the former take to the mountain-passes by every available road, to get to his supplies.  Sherman would have been here before this but for high water in Elk River driving him some thirty miles up that river to cross.\"  And again later in the day, indicating my plans for his relief, as follows:  \"Your dispatch and Dana's just received.  Being there, you can tell better how to resist Longstreet's attack than I can direct.  With your showing you had better give up Kingston at the last moment and save the most productive part of your possessions.  Every arrangement is now made to throw Sherman's force across the river, just at and below the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, as soon as it arrives.  Thomas will attack on his left at the same time, and together it is expected to carry Missionary Ridge, and from there push a force on to the railroad between Cleveland and Dalton.  Hooker will at the same time attack, and, if he can, carry Lookout Mountain.  The enemy now seems to be looking for an attack on his left flank.  This favors us.  To further confirm this, Sherman's advance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton.  The remainder of his force will pass over a new road just made from Whiteside to Kelly's Ferry, thus being concealed from the enemy, and leave him to suppose the whole force is going up Lookout Valley. Sherman's advance has only just reached Bridgeport.  The rear will only reach there on the 16th.  This will bring it to the 19th as the earliest day for making the combined movement as desired.  Inform me if you think you can sustain yourself until this time.  I can hardly conceive of the enemy breaking through at Kingston and pushing for Kentucky.  If they should, however, a new problem would be left for solution.  Thomas has ordered a division of cavalry to the vicinity of Sparta. I will ascertain if they have started, and inform you.  It will be entirely out of the question to send you ten thousand men, not because they cannot be spared, but how would they be fed after they got even one day east from here?\"  Longstreet, for some reason or other, stopped at Loudon until the 13th. That being the terminus of his railroad communications, it is probable he was directed to remain there awaiting orders.  He was in a position threatening Knoxville, and at the same time where he could be brought back speedily to Chattanooga. The day after Longstreet left Loudon, Sherman reached Bridgeport in person and proceeded on to see me that evening, the 14th, and reached Chattanooga the next day.  My orders for battle were all prepared in advance of Sherman's arrival (*15), except the dates, which could not be fixed while troops to be engaged were so far away.  The possession of Lookout Mountain was of no special advantage to us now.  Hooker was instructed to send Howard's corps to the north side of the Tennessee, thence up behind the hills on the north side, and to go into camp opposite Chattanooga; with the remainder of the command, Hooker was, at a time to be afterwards appointed, to ascend the western slope between the upper and lower palisades, and so get into Chattanooga valley.  The plan of battle was for Sherman to attack the enemy's right flank, form a line across it, extend our left over South Chickamauga River so as to threaten or hold the railroad in Bragg's rear, and thus force him either to weaken his lines elsewhere or lose his connection with his base at Chickamauga Station.  Hooker was to perform like service on our right.  His problem was to get from Lookout Valley to Chattanooga Valley in the most expeditious way possible; cross the latter valley rapidly to Rossville, south of Bragg's line on Missionary Ridge, form line there across the ridge facing north, with his right flank extended to Chickamauga Valley east of the ridge, thus threatening the enemy's rear on that flank and compelling him to reinforce this also.  Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, occupied the centre, and was to assault while the enemy was engaged with most of his forces on his two flanks.  To carry out this plan, Sherman was to cross the Tennessee at Brown's Ferry and move east of Chattanooga to a point"]]]
