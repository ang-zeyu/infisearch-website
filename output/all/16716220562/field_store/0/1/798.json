The writer chanced to be dining with Mr. Kreisler soon after his arrival in this country, after his dismissal from the hospital where he recovered from his wound.  For nearly two hours he listened, thrilled and moved, to the great violinist's modest, vivid narrative of his experiences and adventures.  It seemed in the highest degree desirable that the American public should have an opportunity of reading this narrative from the pen of one in whose art so many of us take a profound interest.  It also was apparent that since so little of an authentic nature had been heard from the Russo-Austrian field of warfare, this story would prove an important contribution to the contemporary history of the war.  After much persuasion, Mr.  Kreisler reluctantly acceded to the suggestion that he write out his personal memories of the war for publication.  He has completed his narrative in the midst of grave difficulties, writing it piecemeal in hotels and railway trains in the course of a concert tour through the country.  It is offered by the publishers to the public with confidence that it will be found one of the most absorbing and informing narratives of the war that has yet appeared.  F.  G.      Four Weeks In The Trenches    I    In trying to recall my impressions during my short war duty as an officer in the Austrian Army, I find that my recollections of this period are very uneven and confused.  Some of the experiences stand out with absolute clearness; others, however, are blurred.  Two or three events which took place in different localities seem merged into one, while in other instances recollection of the chronological order of things is missing.  This curious indifference of the memory to values of time and space may be due to the extraordinary physical and mental stress under which the impressions I am trying to chronicle were received.  The same state of mind I find is rather characteristic of most people I have met who were in the war.  It should not be forgotten, too, that the gigantic upheaval which changed the fundamental condition of life overnight and threatened the very existence of nations naturally dwarfed the individual into nothingness, and the existing interest in the common welfare left practically no room for personal considerations.  Then again, at the front, the extreme uncertainty of the morrow tended to lessen the interest in the details of to-day; consequently I may have missed a great many interesting happenings alongside of me which I would have wanted to note under other circumstances.  One gets into a strange psychological, almost hypnotic, state of mind while on the firing line which probably prevents the mind's eye from observing and noticing things in a normal way.  This accounts, perhaps, for some blank spaces in my memory.  Besides, I went out completely resigned to my fate, without much thought for the future.  It never occurred to me that I might ever want to write my experiences, and consequently I failed to take notes or to establish certain mnemo-technical landmarks by the aid of which I might now be able to reconstruct all details.  I am, therefore, reduced to present an incoherent and rather piecemeal narrative of such episodes as forcibly impressed themselves upon my mind and left an ineradicable mark upon my memory.  The outbreak of the war found my wife and me in Switzerland, where we were taking a cure.  On the 31st of July, on opening the paper, I read that the Third Army Corps, to which my regiment (which is stationed in Graz) belonged, had received an order for mobilization.  Although I had resigned my commission as an officer two years before, I immediately left Switzerland, accompanied by my wife, in order to report for duty.  As it happened, a wire reached me a day later calling me to the colors.  We went by way of Munich.  It was the first day of the declaration of the state of war in Germany.  Intense excitement prevailed.  In Munich all traffic was stopped; no trains were running except for military purposes.  It was only due to the fact that I revealed my intention of rejoining my regiment in Austria that I was able to pass through at all, but by both the civil and military authorities in Bavaria I was shown the greatest possible consideration and passed through as soon as possible.  We reached Vienna on August first.  A startling change had come over the city since I had left it only a few weeks before.  Feverish activity everywhere prevailed.  Reservists streamed in by thousands from all parts of the country to report at headquarters.  Autos filled with officers whizzed past.  Dense crowds surged up and down the streets.  Bulletins and extra editions of newspapers passed from hand to hand.  Immediately it was evident what a great leveler war is.  Differences in rank and social distinctions had practically ceased.  All barriers seemed to have fallen; everybody addressed everybody else.  I saw the crowds stop officers of high rank and well-known members of the aristocracy and clergy, also state officials and court functionaries of high rank, in quest of information, which was imparted cheerfully and patiently.  The imperial princes could frequently be seen on the Ring Strasse surrounded by cheering crowds or mingling with the public unceremoniously at the cafes, talking to everybody.  Of course, the army was idolized.  Wherever the troops marched the public broke into cheers and every uniform was the center of an ovation.  While coming from the station I saw two young reservists, to all appearances brothers, as they hurried to the barracks, carrying their small belongings in a valise.  Along with them walked a little old lady crying, presumably their mother.  They passed a general in full uniform.  Up went their hands to their caps in military salute, whereupon the old general threw his arms wide open and embraced them both, saying: \"Go on, my boys, do your duty bravely and stand firm for your emperor and your country.  God willing, you will come back to your old mother.\" The old lady smiled through her tears.  A shout went up, and the crowds surrounding the general cheered him.  Long after I had left I could hear them shouting.  A few streets farther on I saw in an open cafe a young couple, a reservist in field uniform and a young girl, his bride or sweetheart. They sat there, hands linked, utterly oblivious of their surroundings and of the world at large.  When somebody in the crowd espied them, a great shout went up, the public rushing to the table and surrounding them, then breaking into applause and waving hats and handkerchiefs.  At first the young couple seemed to be utterly taken aback and only slowly did they realize that the ovation was meant for them.  They seemed confused, the young girl blushing and hiding her face in her hands, the young man rising to his feet, saluting and bowing.  More cheers and applause.  He opened his mouth as if wanting to speak.  There was a sudden silence.  He was vainly struggling for expression, but then his face lit up as if by inspiration.  Standing erect, hand at his cap, in a pose of military salute, he intoned the Austrian national hymn.  In a second every head in that throng was bared.  All traffic suddenly stopped, everybody, passengers as well as conductors of the cars, joining in the anthem.  The neighboring windows soon filled with people, and soon it was a chorus of thousands of voices.  The volume of tone and the intensity of feeling seemed to raise the inspiring anthem to the uttermost heights of sublime majesty.  We were then on our way to the station, and long afterwards we could hear the singing, swelling like a human organ.  What impressed me particularly in Vienna was the strict order everywhere.  No mob disturbances of any kind, in spite of the greatly increased liberty and relaxation of police regulations. Nor was there any runaway chauvinism noticeable, aside from the occasional singing of patriotic songs and demonstrations like the one I just described.  The keynote of popular feeling was quiet dignity, joined to determination, with an undercurrent of solemn gravity and responsibility.  I had stopped in Vienna only long enough to bid good-bye to my father, and left for the headquarters of my regiment in Graz.  I reported there for duty and then went to join the Fourth Battalion, which was stationed at Leoben, one hour away from Graz, my orders being to take command of the first platoon in the sixteenth company.  My platoon consisted of fifty-five men, two buglers, and an ambulance patrol of four.  In Leoben my wife and I remained a week, which was spent in organizing, equipping, requisitioning, recruiting, and preliminary drilling.  These were happy days, as we officers met for the first time, friendships and bonds being sealed which subsequently were tested in common danger and amidst privation and stress.  Many of the officers had brought their wives and soon delightful intercourse, utterly free from formality, developed, without any regard or reference to rank, wealth, or station in private life.  Among the reserve officers of my battalion were a famous sculptor, a well-known philologist, two university professors (one of mathematics, the other of natural science), a prince, and a civil engineer at the head of one of the largest Austrian steel corporations.  The surgeon of our battalion was the head of a great medical institution and a man of international fame.  Among my men in the platoon were a painter, two college professors, a singer of repute, a banker, and a post official of high rank.  But nobody cared and in fact I myself did not know until"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10967"],["title","Four Weeks in the Trenches: The War Story of a Violinist (#1)"],["body"," later what distinguished men were in my platoon.  A great cloak of brotherhood seemed to have enveloped everybody and everything, even differences in military rank not being so obvious at this time, for the officers made friends of their men, and in turn were worshipped by them.  My wife volunteered her services as Red Cross nurse, insisting upon being sent to the front, in order to be as near me as could be, but it developed later that no nurse was allowed to go farther than the large troop hospitals far in the rear of the actual operations. Upon my urgent appeal she desisted and remained in Vienna after I had left, nursing in the barracks, which are now used for hospital work.  In fact, almost every third or fourth house, both private and public, as well as schools, were given to the use of the government and converted into Red Cross stations.  The happy days in Leoben came to an abrupt end, my regiment receiving orders to start immediately for the front.  We proceeded to Graz, where we joined the other three battalions and were entrained for an unknown destination.  We traveled via Budapest to Galicia, and left the train at Strij, a very important railroad center south of Lemberg.  It must be understood that the only reports reaching us from the fighting line at that time were to the effect that the Russians had been driven back from our border, and that the Austrian armies actually stood on the enemy's soil.  Strij being hundreds of miles away from the Russian frontier, we could not but surmise that we were going to be stationed there some time for the purpose of training and maneuvering.  This belief was strengthened by the fact that our regiment belonged to the Landsturm, or second line of reserves, originally intended for home service.  We were, however, alarmed that very same night and marched out of Strij for a distance of about twenty miles, in conjunction with the entire Third Army Corps.  After a short pause for the purpose of eating and feeding the horses, we marched another twenty-two miles.  This first day's march constituted a very strong test of endurance in consequence of our comparative softness and lack of training, especially as, in addition to his heavy rifle, bayonet, ammunition, and spade, each soldier was burdened with a knapsack containing emergency provisions in the form of tinned meats, coffee extract, sugar, salt, rice, and biscuits, together with various tin cooking and eating utensils; furthermore a second pair of shoes, extra blouse, changes of underwear, etc.  On top of this heavy pack a winter overcoat and part of a tent were strapped, the entire weight of the equipment being in the neighborhood of fifty pounds.  The day wore on.  Signs of fatigue soon manifested themselves more and more strongly, and slowly the men dropped out one by one, from sheer exhaustion.  No murmur of complaint, however, would be heard.  Most of those who fell out of line, after taking a breathing space for a few minutes, staggered on again. The few that remained behind joined the regiment later on when camp was established.  We wondered then at the necessity of such a forced march, being unable to see a reason for it, unless it was to put us in training.  Night had fallen when we reached a small monastery in the midst of a forest, where the peaceful surroundings and the monastic life, entirely untouched by the war fever, seemed strange indeed.  Camp was established, tents erected, fires were lighted, and coffee made. Soon a life of bustling activity sprang up in the wilderness, in the midst of the forest which only a few hours before had been deserted.  It made a weird and impressive picture in the wonderful starlight night, these soldiers sitting around the camp fires softly singing in chorus; the fantastic outlines of the monastery half hidden in the woods; the dark figures of the monks moving silently back and forth amongst the shadows of the trees as they brought refreshments to the troops; the red glow of the camp fires illuminating the eager and enthusiastic faces of the young officers grouped around the colonel; the snorting and stamping of the horses nearby; an occasional melodic outcry of a sentinel out in the night; all these things merging into an unforgettable scene of great romanticism and beauty.  That night I lay for a long while stretched near the smoldering ashes of the camp fire, with my cape as a blanket, in a state of lassitude and somnolence, my soul filled with exaltation and happiness over the beauty around me.  The rest, however, was of very short duration, for at six o'clock in the morning we were aroused, camp was broken up and soon afterwards we started on a forced march of twenty-two miles without a halt, during which we twice had to wade knee-deep through rivers. By midday most of the men were so exhausted that they could hardly crawl along.  It was remarkable that the comparatively weaker and more refined city-bred people who had done little physical work in their lives, most of them being professional men, withstood hardships better than the sturdy and, to all appearances, stronger peasants; the only explanation for it being perhaps that the. city-bred people, in consequence of their better surroundings and by reason of their education, had more will power and nervous strength than the peasants.  At half-past two we reached a clearing in the midst of a wood through which a river flowed.  Here camp was again established and a half hour later all the hardships of the march were once more forgotten in the bustle of camp life.  This time we had a full rest until the next morning at four o'clock, when suddenly orders for marching were given.  After we had been under way for about three hours we heard far-away, repeated rumbling which sounded like distant thunder.  Not for a moment did we associate it with cannonading, being, as we supposed, hundreds of miles away from the nearest place where Russians could possibly be.  Suddenly a mounted ordnance officer came rushing with a message to our colonel.  We came to a halt and all officers were summoned to the colonel who, addressing us in his usual quiet, almost businesslike way, said: \"Gentlemen, accept my congratulations, I have good news for you, we may meet the enemy to-day and I sincerely hope to lead you to the fight before evening.\" We were thunderstruck at the sudden realization that the Russians had penetrated so deeply into Galicia. The despondency which followed this startling revelation, however, was quickly replaced by the intense excitement of meeting the enemy so soon.  We hurried back to our companies, imparting the news to the men, who broke forth into shouts of enthusiasm.  All the fatigue so plainly noticeable only a few minutes before, suddenly vanished as if by magic, and every one seemed alert, springy, and full of spirit.  We energetically resumed the march in the direction of the distant rumbling, which indicated that the artillery of our advance guard had engaged the enemy.  My regiment then was part of the main body of a division.  A second division advanced on the road parallel to ours, about a mile and a quarter to our left.  Both columns belonged to the Third Army Corps and kept up constant communication with each other through mounted dispatch bearers and motor cycles.  The cannonading had meanwhile come perceptibly nearer, and in the midst of the dense forest we again came to a short halt.  Orders were given to load rifles, and upon emerging from the woods we fell into open formation, the men marching abreast, the companies at a distance of three hundred yards, with the battalions at a distance of about a thousand yards.  We were slowly entering the range of the Russian artillery.  About a mile ahead we could see numbers of harmless looking round clouds, looking like ringlets of smoke from a huge cigar, indicating the places where shrapnel had exploded in mid-air.  Our men, not being familiar with the spectacle, took no notice of it, but we officers knew its significance, and I daresay many a heart beat as wildly as mine did.  We marched on until the command was given for us to deploy, and soon afterwards the first shrapnel whizzed over our heads.  It did no harm, nor did the second and third, but the fourth hit three men in the battalion in the rear of us.  Our forward movement, however, was not interrupted, and we did not see or hear anything beyond two or three startled cries.  The next shell burst right ahead of us, sending a shower of bullets and steel fragments around.  A man about twenty yards to the right of my company, but not of my platoon, leaped into the air with an agonizing cry and fell in a heap, mortally wounded.  As we were advancing very swiftly, I only saw it as in a dream, while running by.  Then came in rapid succession four or five terrific explosions right over our heads, and I felt a sudden gust of cold wind strike my cheek as a big shell fragment came howling through the air, ploughing the ground viciously as it struck and sending a spray of sand around.  We ran on perhaps a quarter of a mile, when from the rear came the sharp command, \"Down,\" and the next second we lay on the ground, panting and exhausted, my heart almost bursting with the exertion.  Simultaneously the whizzing of a motor above our heads could be heard and we knew why the enemy's shrapnel had so suddenly found us.  It was a Russian aeroplane which presumably had signaled our approach, together with the range, to the Russian gunners, and now was probably directing their fire and closely watching its effect, for a chain of hills was hiding us from the view of the enemy, who consequently had to fire indirectly.  The air craft hovered above our heads, but we were forbidden to fire at it, the extremely difficult, almost vertical aim promising little success, aside from the danger of our bullets falling back among us.  Our reserves in the rear had apparently sighted the air craft too, for soon we heard a volley "]]]
