CLAUD. EPITH.   THE SECOND EDITION.   LONDON:  PRINTED BY J. NICHOLS,  FOR J. JOHNSON, ST. PAUL'S CHURCH YARD. M, DCC, XC.   ADVERTISEMENT.  The general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science, and to lead her votaries from the looser analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter ones, which form the ratiocination of philosophy. While their particular design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of BOTANY; by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science, and recommending to their attention the immortal works of the Swedish Naturalist LINNEUS.  In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the physiology of Plants is delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they may be supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables. But the publication of this part is deferred to another year, for the purpose of repeating some experiments on vegetation, mentioned in the notes. In the second poem, or LOVES OF THE PLANTS, which is here presented to the Reader, the Sexual System of LINNEUS is explained, with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.  The author has withheld this work, (excepting a few pages) many years from the press, according to the rule of Horace, hoping to have rendered it more worthy the acceptance of the public,--but finds at length, that he is less able, from disuse, to correct the poetry; and, from want of leizure, to amplify the annotations.  In this second edition, the plants Amaryllis, Orchis, and Cannabis are inserted with two additional prints of flowers; some alterations are made in Gloriosa, and Tulipa; and the description of the Salt-mines in Poland is removed to the first poem on the Economy of Vegetation.    PREFACE.   Linneus has divided the vegetable world into 24 Classes; these Classes into about 120 Orders; these Orders contain about 2000 Families, or Genera; and these Families about 20,000 Species; besides the innumerable Varieties, which the accidents of climate or cultivation have added to these Species.  The Classes are distinguished from each other in this ingenious system, by the number, situation, adhesion, or reciprocal proportion of the males in each flower. The Orders, in many of these Classes, are distinguished by the number, or other circumstances of the females. The Families, or Genera, are characterized by the analogy of all the parts of the flower or fructification. The Species are distinguished by the foliage of the plant; and the Varieties by any accidental circumstance of colour, taste, or odour; the seeds of these do not always produce plants similar to the parent; as in our numerous fruit-trees and garden flowers; which are propagated by grafts or layers.  The first eleven Classes include the plants, in whose flowers both the sexes reside; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither united, nor unequal in height when at maturity; and are therefore distinguished from each other simply by the number of males in each flower, as is seen in the annexed PLATE, copied from the Dictionaire Botanique of M. BULLIARD, in which the numbers of each division refer to the Botanic Classes.  CLASS I. ONE MALE, _Monandria_; includes the plants which possess but One Stamen in each flower.  II. TWO MALES, _Diandria_. Two Stamens.  III. THREE MALES, _Triandria_. Three Stamens.  IV. FOUR MALES, _Tetrandria_. Four Stamens.  V. FIVE MALES, _Pentandria_. Five Stamens.  VI. SIX MALES, _Hexandria_. Six Stamens.  VII. SEVEN MALES, _Heptandria_. Seven Stamens.  VIII. EIGHT MALES, _Octandria_. Eight Stamens.  IX. NINE MALES, _Enneandria_. Nine Stamens.  X. TEN MALES, _Decandria_. Ten Stamens.  XI. TWELVE MALES, _Dodecandria_. Twelve Stamens.   The next two Classes are distinguished not only by the number of equal and disunited males, as in the above eleven Classes, but require an additional circumstance to be attended to, _viz._ whether the males or stamens be situated on the calyx, or not.  XII. TWENTY MALES, _Icosandria_. Twenty Stamens inserted on the calyx or flower-cup; as is well seen in the last Figure of No. xii. in the annexed Plate.  XIII. MANY MALES, _Polyandria_. From 20 to 100 Stamens, which do not adhere to the calyx; as is well seen in the first Figure of No. xiii. in the annexed Plate.   In the next two Classes, not only the number of stamens are to be observed, but the reciprocal proportions in respect to height.  XIV. TWO POWERS, _Didynamia_. Four Stamens, of which two are lower than the other two; as is seen in the two first Figures of No. xiv.  XV. FOUR POWERS, _Tetradynamia_. Six Stamens; of which four are taller, and the two lower ones opposite to each other; as is seen in the third Figure of the upper row in No. 15.  The five subsequent Classes are distinguished not by the number of the males, or stamens, but by their union or adhesion, either by their anthers, or filaments, or to the female or pistil.  XVI. ONE BROTHERHOOD, _Monadelphia_. Many Stamens united by their filaments into one company; as in the second Figure below of No. xvi.  XVII. TWO BROTHERHOODS, _Diadelphia_. Many Stamens united by their filaments into two Companies; as in the uppermost Fig. No. xvii.  XVIII. MANY BROTHERHOODS, _Polyadelphia_. Many Stamens united by their filaments into three or more companies, as in No. xviii.  XIX. CONFEDERATE MALES, _Syngenesia_. Many Stamens united by their anthers; as in first and second Figures, No. xix.  XX. FEMININE MALES, _Gynandria_. Many Stamens attached to the pistil.   The next three Classes consist of plants, whose flowers contain but one of the sexes; or if some of them contain both sexes, there are other flowers accompanying them of but one sex.  XXI. ONE HOUSE, _Monoecia_. Male flowers and female flowers separate, but on the same plant.  XXII. TWO HOUSES, _Dioecia_. Male flowers and female flowers separate, on different plants.  XXIII. POLYGAMY, _Polygamia_. Male and female flowers on one or more plants, which have at the same time flowers of both sexes.   The last Class contains the plants whose flowers are not discernible.  XXIV. CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, _Cryptogamia_.  The Orders of the first thirteen Classes are founded on the number of Females, or Pistils, and distinguished by the names, ONE FEMALE, _Monogynia_. TWO FEMALES, _Digynia_. THREE FEMALES, _Trigynia_, &c. as is seen in No. i. which represents a plant of one male, one female; and in the first Figure of No. xi. which represents a flower with twelve males, and three females; (for, where the pistils have no apparent styles, the summits, or stigmas, are to be numbered) and in the first Figure of No. xii. which represents a flower with twenty males and many females; and in the last Figure of the same No. which has twenty males and one female; and in No. xiii. which represents a flower with many males and many females.  The Class of TWO POWERS, is divided into two natural Orders; into such as have their seeds naked at the bottom of the calyx, or flower cup; and such as have their seeds covered; as is seen in No. xiv. Fig. 3. and 5.  The Class of FOUR POWERS, is divided also into two Orders; in one of these the seeds are inclosed in a silicule, as in _Shepherd's purse_. No. xiv. Fig. 5. In the other they are inclosed in a silique, as in _Wall-flower_. Fig. 4.  In all the other Classes, excepting the Classes Confederate Males, and Clandestine Marriage, as the character of each Class is distinguished by the situations of the males; the character of the Orders is marked by the numbers of them. In the Class ONE BROTHERHOOD, No. xvi. Fig. 3. the Order of ten males is represented. And in the Class TWO BROTHERHOODS, No. xvii. Fig. 2. the Order ten males is represented.  In the Class CONFEDERATE MALES, the Orders are chiefly distinguished by the fertility or barrenness of the florets of the disk, or ray of the compound flower.  And in the Class of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, the four Orders are termed FERNS, MOSSES, FLAGS, and FUNGUSSES.  The Orders are again divided into Genera, or Families, which are all natural associations, and are described from the general resemblances of the parts of fructification, in respect to their number, form, situation, and reciprocal proportion. These are the Calyx, or Flower-cup, as seen in No. iv. Fig. 1. No. x. Fig. 1. and 3. No. xiv. Fig. 1. 2. 3. 4. Second, the Corol, or Blossom, as seen in No. i. ii. &c. Third, the Males, or Stamens; as in No. iv. Fig. 1. and No. viii. Fig. 1. Fourth, the Females, or Pistils; as in No. i. No. xii. Fig. 1. No. xiv. Fig. 3. No. xv. Fig. 3. Fifth, the Pericarp or Fruit-vessel; as No. xv. Fig. 4. 5. No. xvii. Fig. 2. Sixth, the Seeds.  The illustrious author of the Sexual System of Botany, in his preface to his account of the Natural Orders, ingeniously imagines, that one plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning; and that the intermarriages of these produced one plant of every Genus, or Family; and that the intermarriages of these Generic, or Family plants, produced all the Species: and lastly, that the intermarriages of the individuals of the Species produced the Varieties.  In the following POEM, the name or number of the Class or Order of each plant is printed in italics; as \"_Two_ brother swains.\" \"_One_ House contains them.\" and the word \"_secret_\" expresses the Class of Clandestine Marriage.

GENTLE READER!  Lo, here a CAMERA OBSCURA is presented to thy view, in which are lights and shades dancing on a whited canvas, and magnified into apparent life!--if thou art perfectly at leasure for such trivial amusement, walk in, and view the wonders of my INCHANTED GARDEN.  Whereas P. OVIDIUS NASO, a great Necromancer in the famous Court of AUGUSTUS CAESAR, did by art poetic transmute Men, Women, and even Gods and Goddesses, into Trees and Flowers; I have undertaken by similar art to restore some of them to their original animality, after having remained prisoners so long in their respective vegetable mansions; and have here exhibited them before thee. Which thou may'st contemplate as diverse little pictures suspended over the chimney of a Lady's dressing-room, _connected only by a slight festoon of ribbons_. And which, though thou may'st not be acquainted with the originals, may amuse thee by the beauty of their persons, their graceful attitudes, or the brilliancy of their dress.  FAREWELL.  [Illustration]            THE          LOVES          OF THE          PLANTS.            CANTO I.          Descend, ye hovering Sylphs! aerial Quires,         And sweep with little hands your silver lyres;         With fairy footsteps print your grassy rings,         Ye Gnomes! accordant to the tinkling strings; 5      While in soft notes I tune to oaten reed         Gay hopes, and amorous sorrows of the mead.--         From giant Oaks, that wave their branches dark,         To the dwarf Moss, that clings upon their bark,         What Beaux and Beauties crowd the gaudy groves, 10    And woo and win their vegetable Loves.         How Snowdrops cold, and blue-eyed Harebels blend         Their tender tears, as o'er the stream they bend;         The lovesick Violet, and the Primrose pale         Bow their sweet heads, and whisper to the gale; 15    With secret sighs the Virgin Lily droops,         And jealous Cowslips hang their tawny cups.         How the young Rose in beauty's damask pride         Drinks the warm blushes of his bashful bride;         With honey'd lips enamour'd Woodbines meet, 20    Clasp with fond arms, and mix their kisses sweet.--          Stay thy soft-murmuring waters, gentle Rill;         Hush, whispering Winds, ye ruflling Leaves, be still;         Rest, silver Butterflies, your quivering wings;         Alight, ye Beetles, from your airy rings;   [_Vegetable Loves_. l. 10. Linneus, the celebrated Swedish naturalist, has demonstrated, that ail flowers contain families of males or females, or both; and on their marriages has constructed his invaluable system of Botany.]   25    Ye painted Moths, your gold-eyed plumage furl,         Bow your wide horns, your spiral trunks uncurl;         Glitter, ye Glow-worms, on your mossy beds;         Descend, ye Spiders, on your lengthen'd threads;         Slide here, ye horned Snails, with varnish'd shells; 30    Ye Bee-nymphs, listen in your waxen cells!--          BOTANIC MUSE! who in this latter age         Led by your airy hand the Swedish sage,         Bad his keen eye your secret haunts explore         On dewy dell, high wood, and winding shore; 35    Say on each leaf how tiny Graces dwell;         How laugh the Pleasures in a blossom's bell;         How insect Loves arise on cobweb wings,         Aim their light shafts, and point their little stings.          First the tall CANNA lifts his curled brow 40    Erect to heaven, and plights his nuptial vow;   [_Canna_. l. 39. Cane, or Indian Reed. One male and one female inhabit each flower. It is brought from between the tropics to our hot-houses, and bears a beautiful crimson flower; the seeds are used as shot by the Indians, and are strung for prayer-beads in some catholic countries.]           The virtuous pair, in milder regions born,         Dread the rude blast of Autumn's icy morn;         Round the chill fair he folds his crimson vest,         And clasps the timorous beauty to his breast.  45    Thy love, CALLITRICHE, _two_ Virgins share,         Smit with thy starry eye and radiant hair;--         On the green margin sits the youth, and laves         His floating train of tresses in the waves;         Sees his fair features paint the streams that pass, 50    And bends for ever o'er the watery glass.          _Two_ brother swains, of COLLIN'S gentle name,         The same their features, and their forms the same,   [_Callitriche_, l. 45. Fine-Hair, Stargrass. One male and two females inhabit each flower. The upper leaves grow in form of a star, whence it is called Stellaria Aquatica by Ray and others; its stems and leaves float far on the water, and are often so matted together, as to bear a person walking on them. The male sometimes lives in a separate flower.]  [_Collinsonia_. l. 51. Two males one female. I have lately observed a very singular circumstance in this flower; the two males stand widely diverging from each other, and the female bends herself into contact first with one of them, and after some time leaves this, and applies herself to the other. It is probable one of the anthers may be mature before  the other? See note on Gloriosa, and Genista. The females in Nigella, devil in the bush, are very tall compared to the males; and bending over in a circle to them, give the flower some resemblance to a regal crown. The female of the epilobium angustisolium, rose bay willow herb, bends down amongst the males for several days, and becomes upright again when impregnated.]  [_Genista_. l. 57. Dyer's broom. Ten males and one female inhabit this flower. The males are generally united at the bottom in two sets, whence Linneus has named the class \"two brotherhoods.\" In the Genista, however, they are united in but one set. The flowers of this class are called papilionaceous, from their resemblance to a butterfly, as the pea-blossom. In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately observed a curious circumstance, the males or stamens are in two sets, one set rising a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper set does not arrive at their maturity so soon as the lower, and the stigma, or head of the female, is produced amongst the upper or immature set; but as soon as the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keel-leaf, or hood of the flower, it bends itself round in an instant, like a French horn, and inserts its head, or stigma, amongst the lower or mature set of males. The pistil, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set, by the time they become mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously. See note on Collinsonia, Gloriosa, Draba.]           With rival love for fair COLLINIA sigh,         Knit the dark brow, and roll the unsteady eye. 55    With sweet concern the pitying beauty mourns,         And sooths with smiles the jealous pair by turns.          Sweet blooms GENISTA in the myrtle shade,         And _ten_ fond brothers woo the haughty maid.         _Two_ knights before thy fragrant altar bend, 60    Adored MELISSA! and _two_ squires attend.         MEADIA'S soft chains _five_ suppliant beaux confess,         And hand in hand the laughing belle address;         Alike to all, she bows with wanton air,         Rolls her dark eye, and waves her golden hair.   [_Melissa_. l. 60. Balm. In each flower there are four males and one female; two of the males stand higher than the other two; whence the name of the class \"two powers.\" I have observed in the Ballota, and others of this class, that the two lower stamens, or males become mature before the two higher. After they have shed their dust, they turn themselves away outwards; and the pistil, or female, continuing to grow a little taller, is applied to the upper stamens. See Gloriosa, and Genista.  All the plants of this class, which have naked seeds, are aromatic. The Marum, and Nepeta are particularly delightful to cats; no other brute animals seem pleased with any odours but those of their food or prey.]  [_Meadia_. l. 61. Dodecatheon, American Cowslip. Five males and one female. The males, or anthers, touch each other. The uncommon beauty of this flower occasioned Linneus to give it a name signifying the twelve heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The pistil is much longer than the stamens, hence the flower-stalks have their elegant bend, that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust of the anthers. And the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew drops from sliding down and washing off this dust prematurely; and at the same time exposing it to the light and air. As soon as the seeds are formed, it erects all the flower-stalks to prevent them from falling out; and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this a mechanical effect, or does it indicate a vegetable storgé to preserve its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Gloriosa.  In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the filaments are very short compared with the slyle. Hence it became necessary, 1st. to furnish the stamens with long anthers. 2d. To lengthen and bend the peduncle or flower-slalk, that the  flower might hang downwards. 3d. To reflect the petals. 4th. To erect these peduncles when the germ was fecundated. We may reason upon this"]]]
