The chiefs of the invading tribes knew no law except the rule of       the sword. If they saw anything which they wanted, they took it.       Rich cities were plundered at will. They did not admit any man’s       ownership of anything. In the old days when the tribes were       roaming around, there was no private ownership of land.       Everything belonged to the tribe in common. Each man had a vote       in the council of the tribe.        Among these invaders, as with all barbarous tribes, there was no       such thing as an absolute rule. A chief was obeyed because the       greater part of his people considered him the best leader in war.       Often, no doubt, when a chief had lost a battle and the majority       of the tribe had lost confidence in him, he resigned and let them       choose a new chief. (For the same reason we frequently hear today       that the prime minister, or leader of the government, of some       European country has resigned.) In spite of the fact, then, that       the chief was stronger than any other man in the tribe, if the       majority of his warriors had combined against him to put another       man in his place he could not have withstood them. Government, in       its beginning, was based upon the consent of the governed. All       men in the primitive tribe were equal in rank, except as one was       a better fighter than another, and the chief held the leadership       in war only because the members of his tribe allowed him to keep       it.  [Illustration: A Frankish Chief.]        It must be remembered that in these early days, the people had no       fixed place of abode. Their only homes were rude huts which they       could put up or tear down at very short notice; and so when they       heard of more fertile lands or a warmer climate across the       mountains to the south they used to pull up stakes and migrate in       a body, never to return. It was always the more savage and       uncivilized peoples who were most likely to migrate. The lands       which they wished to seize they generally found already settled       by other tribes, more civilized and hence more peaceful, occupied       in trade and agriculture, having gradually turned to these       pursuits from their former habits of hunting and fighting.       Sometimes these more civilized and peace-loving people were able,       by their better weapons and superior knowledge of the art of       fortifying, to beat back the invasion of the immigrating       barbarians. Oftener, though, the rougher, ruder tribes were the       victors, and settled down among the people they had conquered, to       rule them, doing no work themselves, but forcing the conquered       ones to feed and clothe them.  [Illustration: Movable Huts of Early Germans]        History is full of instances of such conquests, and they were       taking place, no doubt, ages before the times from which our       earliest records date. The best examples, however, are to be       found in the invasions of the Roman Empire by the Germanic tribes       to which we have referred above. The country between the Rhine       River and the Pyrenees Mountains, which had been called Gaul when       the Gauls lived there, became France when the Franks conquered       the Gauls and stayed to live among them. In like manner, two       German tribes became the master races in Spain. The Burgundians       came down from the shores of the Baltic Sea and gave their name       to their new home in the fertile valley of the Saône (Sōn); the       Vandals came out of Germany to roam through Spain, finally       founding a kingdom in Africa; while the Lombards crossed the Alps       to become the masters of the Valley of the Po, whither the Gauls       had gone before them, seven hundred years earlier.  [Illustration: Goths on the March]  [Illustration: Franks Crossing the Rhine]        The island now known as Great Britain, which was inhabited two       thousand years ago by the Britons and Gaels, Celtic peoples, was       overrun and conquered in part about 450 A.D. by the Saxons and       Angles, Germanic tribes, after whom part of the island was called       Angleland. (The men from the south of England are of the same       blood as the Saxons in the German army, against whom they had to       fight in the great war.) Then came Danes, who partially conquered       the Angles and Saxons, and after them, in 1066 A.D., the country       was again conquered by the Normans, descendants of some Norsemen,       who, one hundred and fifty years before, had come down from       Norway and conquered a large territory in the northwestern part       of France.  [Illustration: Men of Normandy Landing in England.]        In some cases, the conquered tribes moved on to other lands,       leaving their former homes to their conquerors. In this way the       Britons and Gaels gave up the greater part of their land to the       Angles and Saxons and withdrew to the hills and mountains of       Wales, Cornwall, and northern Scotland. In other cases, the       conquered people and their conquerors inhabited the same lands       side by side, as the Normans settled down in England among the       Anglo-Saxons.        In the early days of savagery, one tribe would frequently make a       raid upon another neighboring tribe and bring home with it some       captives who became slaves, working without pay for their       conquerors and possessing no more rights than beasts of burden.       (This custom exists today in the interior of Africa, and was       responsible for the infamous African slave trade. Black captives       were sold to white traders through the greed of their captors,       who forgot that their own relatives and friends might be carried       off and sold across the seas by some other tribe of blacks.)        When these slaves were kept as the servants of their conquerors,       their number was very small as compared with that of their       masters. When, on the other hand, a tribe settled among a people       whom they had conquered, they often found themselves fewer in       numbers, and kept their leadership only by their greater strength       and fighting ability.        Here there had arisen a new situation: all men were no longer       equal, led by a chief of their own choosing, but instead, the       greater part of them now had no voice in the government. They had       become subjects, working to earn their own living and also, as       has been said, to support in idleness their conquerors.        This ability of the few to rule the many and force them to       support their masters was increased as certain peoples learned       better than others how to make strong armor and effective       weapons. Nearly five hundred years before the time of Christ, at       the battle of Marathon (Măr′ȧ thŏn), the Greeks discovered       that one Greek, clad in metal armor and armed with a long spear,       was worth ten Persians wearing leather and carrying a bow and       arrows or a short sword. One hundred and sixty years later, a       small army of well-equipped Macedonian Greeks, led by that       wonderful general, Alexander the Great, defeated nearly forty       times its number of Persians in a great battle in Asia and       conquered a vast empire.  [Illustration: Alexander Defeating the Persians]        In later times, as better and better armor was made, the question       of wealth entered in. The chief who had money enough to buy the       best arms for his men could defeat his poorer neighbor and force       him to pay money as to a ruler. Finally, in the so-called “Middle       Ages,” before the invention of gunpowder, one knight, armed from       crown to sole in steel, was worth in battle as much as one       hundred poorly-armed farmers or “peasants” as they are called in       Europe.  In the “Dark Ages,”[2] after all these barbarians that we have named had swarmed over Europe, and before the governments of modern times were fully grown, there were hundreds of robber chiefs, who, scattered throughout a country, were in the habit of collecting tribute at the point of the sword from the peaceful peasants who lived near. This tribute they collected in some cases, regularly, a fixed amount each month or year, just as if they had a right to collect it, like a government tax collector. It might be money or food or fodder, or fuel. The robber chiefs were well armed themselves and were able to give good weapons and armor to their men, who lived either in the chief’s castle or in small houses built very near it. They likewise plundered any travelers who came by, unless their numbers and weapons made them look too dangerous to be attacked. But the regular tribute forced from the peaceful farmers was the chief source of their income. The robber chief and his men lived a life of idleness when they were not out upon some raid for plunder, and the honest, industrious peasants worked hard enough to support both their own families and those of the robbers.   [2] The “Dark Ages” came before the “Middle Ages.” They were called  “dark” because the barbarians had extinguished nearly all civilization  and learning.  [Illustration: A Knight in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11200"],["title","The World War and What was Behind It; Or, The Story of the Map of Europe (#5)"],["body","]        These robber chiefs had no right but might. They were outlaws,       and lived either in a country which had no government and laws,       or in one whose government was too weak to protect its people.       They were no worse, however, than the so-called feudal barons who       came after them, who oppressed the people even more, because they       had on their side whatever law and government existed in those       days.        Now let us stop to consider how first there came to be kings. In       the early days of the human race and also in later days among       barbarous peoples, the land was very sparsely settled. The reason       lay in the chief occupations of the men. A small tribe might       inhabit a great stretch of territory through which they wandered       to keep within reach of plenty of game. As time went on, however,       the population increased, and, as agriculture took the place of       hunting, and homes became more lasting, tribes found themselves       living in smaller and smaller tracts of land, and hence nearer to       their neighbors. In some cases, constant fighting went on, just       as Caesar tells us that two thousand years ago, the Swiss and the       Germans fought almost daily battles back and forth across the       Rhine. In other cases, the tribes found it better for all       concerned to make treaties of peace with their neighbors, and if       they did not exchange visits and mix on friendly terms, at least       they did not attack each other.        Finally, one day there would come to several tribes which had       treaties with each other a common danger, such as an invasion by       some horde of another race or nation. Common interest would drive       them together for mutual protection, and the chief of some one of       them would be chosen to lead their joint army. In this way, we       find the fifteen tribes of the Belgians uniting against the Roman       army led by Julius Caesar, and electing as king over them the       chief of one of the tribes “on account of his justice and       wisdom.” Five years later, in the year 52 B.C., we find       practically all the inhabitants of what is now France united into       a nation under the leadership of Vercingetorix (Vẽr sin jet′ō       riks) in one last effort to free themselves from Rome. Five       hundred years later, the Romans themselves were driven to join       forces with two of the Germanic tribes to check the swift       invasion of the terrible Huns.        In some cases, these alliances were only for a short time and the       kingships were merely temporary. In other cases, the wars that       drove the tribes to unite under one great chief or king lasted       for years or even centuries, so that new generations grew up who       had never lived under any other government than that of a king.       Thus when the wars were ended, the tribes continued to be ruled       by the one man, although the reason for the kingship had ceased       to be. In the days of the Roman republic, from 500 to 100 B.C.,       when grave danger arose, the senate, or council of elders,       appointed one man who was called the dictator, and this dictator       ruled like an absolute monarch until the danger was past. Then,       like the famous Cincinnatus, he gave up the position and retired       to private life. The first lasting kingships, then, began, as it       were, by the refusal of some dictator to resign when the need for       his rule was ended.        By this time, the custom of choosing the son of a chief or king       to take his father’s place was fairly well settled, and it did       not take long to have it understood as a regular thing that at a       king’s death he should be followed by his oldest son. Often there       were quarrels and even civil wars caused by ambitious younger       sons, who did not submit to their elder brothers without a       struggle, but as people grew to be more civilized and       peace-loving, they found it better to have the oldest son looked       upon as the rightful heir to the kingship.        As kingdoms grew larger, and more and more people came to be       busied in agriculture, trade, and even, on a small scale, in       manufacture, the warriors grew fewer in proportion, and people       began to forget that the king was originally only a war leader,       and that the office was created through military need. They came       to regard the rule of the king as a matter of course and stopped       thinking of themselves as having any right to say how they should       be governed. Kings were quick to foster this feeling. For the       purpose of making their own positions sure, they were in the       habit of impressing it upon their people that the kingship was a       divine institution. They proclaimed that the office of king was       made by the gods, or in Christian nations, by God, and that it       was the divine will that the people of the nations should be       ruled by kings. The great Roman orator, Cicero (Sĭs′erō), in a       speech delivered in the year 66 B.C., referring to people who       lived in kingdoms, says that the name of king “seems to them a       great and sacred thing.” This same feeling has lasted through all       the ages down to the present time, and the majority of the people       in European kingdoms, even among the educated classes, still look       upon a king as a superior being, and are made happy and proud if       they ever have a chance to do him a service of any sort.           Questions for Review             Why was it that in barbarian tribes there was no private           ownership of land?            What is meant by saying that government was based upon the           consent of the governed?            Was there anything besides love of plunder that induced the           German tribes to move southward?            Explain the beginnings of slavery.            Explain the value of armor in early times.            What is meant by the “Dark Ages”?            What is meant by saying that the fighting men were parasites?            When the first kings were chosen was it intended that they           should be rulers for life?            Is it easy for a man in power to retain this power?            Why is it that most Europeans bow low before a king?     Chapter IV. Master and Man        The land is the king’s.—He lends it to barons.—Barons lend it to       knights and smaller barons.—Smaller barons collect rent for it       from the peasants.—A father’s lands are lent to his son.—Barons       pay for the land by furnishing men for the king’s wars.—No       account is taken of the rights of the peasant.—The peasant, the       only producer, is despised by the fighting men.—If a baron       rebels, his men must rebel also.—Dukes against kings.—What killed       the feudal system.—Feudal wrongs alive today.         When one great tribe or nation invaded and conquered a country,       as the Ostrogoths came into Italy in the year 489 A.D., or as the       Normans entered England in 1066, their king at once took it for       granted that he owned all the conquered land. In some cases, he       might divide the kingdom up among his chiefs, giving a county to       each of forty or fifty leaders. These great leaders (dukes or       barons, as they were called in the Norman-French language, or       earls, as the English named them) would in turn each divide up       his county among several less important chiefs, whom we may call       lesser or little barons. Each little baron might have several       knights and squires, who lived in or near his castle and had       received from him tracts of land corresponding in size, perhaps,       to the American township and who, therefore, fought under his       banner in war.  [Illustration: A Norman Castle in England]        Each baron had under him a strong body of fighting men,       “men-at-arms,” as they were called, or “retainers,” who in return       for their “keep,” that is, their food and lodging, and a chance       to share the plunder gained in war, swore to be faithful to him,       became his men, and gave him the service called homage. (This       word comes from _hōmō_, the Latin for “man.”) The lesser baron,       in turn, swore homage to, and was the “man” of the great baron or       earl. Whenever the earl called on these lesser chiefs to gather       their fighting men and report to him, they had to obey, serving       him as unquestioningly as their squires and retainers obeyed       them. The earl or duke swore homage to the king, from whom he had       received his land.        This, then, was the feudal system (so named from the word       _feudum_, which, in Latin, meant a piece of land the use of which       was given to a man in return for his services in war), a system       which reversed the natural laws of society, and stood it on its       apex, like a cone balanced on its point. For instead of saying       that the land was the property of the people of the tribe or       nation, it started by taking for granted that the land all       belonged to the king. The idea was that the king did not give the       land, outright, to his dukes and earls, but that he gave them, in       return for their faithful support and service in war, the _use_       of the land during their lifetime, or so long as they remained       true to him. In _Macbeth_, we read how, for his treason, the       lands of the thane (earl) of Cawdor were taken from him by the       Scottish king and given to the thane of Glamis. The lands thus       lent were called fiefs. Upon the death of the tenant, they went       back to the king or duke who had given them in the first place,       and he at once gave them to some other one of his followers upon       the same terms. It often happened that upon the death of an earl       or baron his son was granted the"]]]
