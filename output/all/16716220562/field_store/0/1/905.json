Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.                       Enter Juliet.      Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.     A lover may bestride the gossamer     That idles in the wanton summer air,     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.    Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.    Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.    Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.    Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy     Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue     Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both     Receive in either by this dear encounter.    Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,     Brags of his substance, not of ornament.     They are but beggars that can count their worth;     But my true love is grown to such excess     cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.    Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone     Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.                                                        [Exeunt.]     ACT III. Scene I. A public place.  Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.     Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.     And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.    Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters     the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and     says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the     second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.    Ben. Am I like such a fellow?    Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in     Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be     moved.    Ben. And what to?    Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,     for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a     man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.     Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an     eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels     as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as     addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a     man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog     that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a     tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with     another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt     tutor me from quarrelling!    Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should     buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.    Mer. The fee simple? O simple!                         Enter Tybalt and others.     Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.    Mer. By my heel, I care not.    Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.     Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.    Mer. And but one word with one of us?     Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.    Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me     occasion.    Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving    Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.    Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make     minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my     fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!    Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.     Either withdraw unto some private place     And reason coldly of your grievances,     Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.    Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.     I will not budge for no man's pleasure,                          Enter Romeo.     Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.    Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!     Your worship in that sense may call him man.    Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford     No better term than this: thou art a villain.    Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage     To such a greeting. Villain am I none.     Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.    Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.    Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,     But love thee better than thou canst devise     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;     And so good Capulet, which name I tender     As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.    Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!     Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]     Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?    Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?    Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. That I     mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,      dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out     of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your     ears ere it be out.    Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]    Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.    Mer. Come, sir, your passado!                                                    [They fight.]    Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.     Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!     Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath     Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.     Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!          Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies                                            [with his Followers].    Mer. I am hurt.     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.     Is he gone and hath nothing?    Ben. What, art thou hurt?    Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.                                                     [Exit Page.]    Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.    Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;     but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you     shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this     world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a     mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a     villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil     came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.    Rom. I thought all for the best.    Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!     They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,     And soundly too. Your houses!                                  [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].    Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,     My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt     In my behalf- my reputation stain'd     With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour     Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate     And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel                        Enter Benvolio.     Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!     That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.    Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;     This but begins the woe others must end.                         Enter Tybalt.     Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.    Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?     Away to heaven respective lenity,     And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!     Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul     Is but a little way above our heads,     Staying for thine to keep him company.     Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.    Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,     Shalt with him hence.    Rom. This shall determine that.                                        They fight. Tybalt falls.    Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.     Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death     If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!    Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!    Ben. Why dost thou stay?                                                      Exit Romeo.                       Enter Citizens.     Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?     Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?    Ben. There lies that Tybalt.    Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.     I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.     Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,                      and [others].     Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?    Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.    Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!     O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd     Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,     For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.     O cousin, cousin!    Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?    Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.     Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink     How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal     Your high displeasure. All this- uttered     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;     Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats     Cold death aside and with the other sends     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity     Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,     'Hold,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],["title","The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#8)"],["body","ds! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;     But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,     And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.    Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;     Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,     And all those twenty could but kill one life.     I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.     Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.    Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?    Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;     His fault concludes but what the law should end,     The life of Tybalt.    Prince. And for that offence     Immediately we do exile him hence.     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine     That you shall all repent the loss of mine.     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.     Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,     Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.     Bear hence this body, and attend our will.     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene II. Capulet's orchard.  Enter Juliet alone.     Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,     Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner     As Phaeton would whip you to the West     And bring in cloudy night immediately.     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,     That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo     Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,     And learn me how to lose a winning match,     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,     With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,     Think true love acted simple modesty.     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night     Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.     Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,     Take him and cut him out in little stars,     And he will make the face of heaven so fine     That all the world will be in love with night     And pay no worship to the garish sun.     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,     But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,     Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day     As is the night before some festival     To an impatient child that hath new robes     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,                  Enter Nurse, with cords.      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords     That Romeo bid thee fetch?    Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.                                              [Throws them down.]    Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands    Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!     We are undone, lady, we are undone!     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!    Jul. Can heaven be so envious?    Nurse. Romeo can,     Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!    Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.     Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.     I am not I, if there be such an 'I';     Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'     If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.    Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,     (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,     All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.    Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!     To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!    Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman     That ever I should live to see thee dead!    Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?     Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?     My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!     For who is living, if those two are gone?    Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.    Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?    Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!    Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!     Despised substance of divinest show!     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-     A damned saint, an honourable villain!     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend     In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?     Was ever book containing such vile matter     So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell     In such a gorgeous palace!    Nurse. There's no trust,     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.     Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.     Shame come to Romeo!    Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue     For such a wish! He was not born to shame.     Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd     Sole monarch of the universal earth.     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!    Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?    Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?     But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!     Your tributary drops belong to woe,     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,     That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;     But O, it presses to my memory     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death     Was woe enough, if it had ended there;     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,     Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,     Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?     But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,     'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.     Where is my father and my mother, nurse?    Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.    Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.     Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,     Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.     He made you for a highway to my bed;     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.     Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!    Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo     To comfort you. I wot well where he is.     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.    Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight     And bid him come to take his last farewell.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene III. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar [Laurence].     Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.     Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,     And thou art wedded to calamity.                           Enter Romeo.     Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand     That I yet know not?    Friar. Too familiar     Is my dear son with such sour company.     I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.    Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?    Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-     Not body's death, but body's banishment.    Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';     For exile hath more terror in his look,     Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'    Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.    Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.     Hence banished is banish'd from the world,     And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'     Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'     Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.    Friar. O"]]]
