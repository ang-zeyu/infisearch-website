Faith Sir, you must pardon me;                 I cannot chuse but laugh to see you merry.                 If you do this, O King; nay, if you dare do it;                 By all these gods you swore by, and as many                 More of my own; I will have fellows, and such                 Fellows in it, as shall make noble mirth;                 The Princess, your dear Daughter, shall stand by me                 On walls, and sung in ballads, any thing:                 Urge me no more, I know her, and her haunts,                 Her layes, leaps, and outlayes, and will discover all;                 Nay will dishonour her. I know the boy                 She keeps, a handsome boy; about eighteen:                 Know what she does with him, where, and when.                 Come Sir, you put me to a womans madness,                 The glory of a fury; and if I do not                 Do it to the height?  _King_.    What boy is this she raves at?  _Meg_.     Alas! good minded Prince, you know not these things?                 I am loth to reveal 'em. Keep this fault                 As you would keep your health from the hot air                 Of the corrupted people, or by heaven,                 I will not fall alone: what I have known,                 Shall be as publick as a print: all tongues                 Shall speak it as they do the language they                 Are born in, as free and commonly; I'le set it                 Like a prodigious star for all to gaze at,                 And so high and glowing, that other Kingdoms far                 and Forreign                 Shall read it there, nay travel with it, till they find                 No tongue to make it more, nor no more people;                 And then behold the fall of your fair Princess.  _King_.    Has she a boy?  _Cle_.       So please your Grace I have seen a boy wait                 On her, a fair boy.  _King_.    Go get you to your quarter:                 For this time I'le study to forget you.  _Meg_.     Do you study to forget me, and I'le study                 To forget you.                                [_Ex_. King, Meg. _and_ Guard.  _Cle_.      Why here's a Male spirit for _Hercules_, if ever there                 be nine worthies of women, this wench shall ride                 astride, and be their Captain.  _Di_.        Sure she hath a garrison of Devils in her tongue, she                 uttereth such balls of wild-fire. She has so netled the                 King, that all the Doctors in the Country will scarce                 cure him. That boy was a strange found out antidote to                 cure her infection: that boy, that Princess boy: that brave,                 chast, vertuous Ladies boy: and a fair boy, a well spoken                 boy: All these considered, can make nothing else--but                 there I leave you Gentlemen.  _Thra_.     Nay we'l go wander with you.                                                [_Exeunt_.                    _Actus Tertius. Scena Prima_.    _Enter _Cle. Di. _and _Thra.  _Cle_.       Nay doubtless 'tis true.  _Di_.         I, and 'tis the gods                 That rais'd this Punishment to scourge the King                 With his own issue: Is it not a shame                 For us, that should write noble in the land;                 For us, that should be freemen, to behold                 A man, that is the bravery of his age,                 _Philaster_, prest down from his Royal right,                 By this regardless King; and only look,                 And see the Scepter ready to be cast                 Into the hands of that lascivious Lady,                 That lives in lust with a smooth boy, now to be                 Married to yon strange Prince, who, but that people                 Please to let him be a Prince, is born a slave,                 In that which should be his most noble part,                 His mind?  _Thra_.     That man that would not stir with you,                 To aid _Philaster_, let the gods forget,                 That such a Creature walks upon the earth.  _Cle_.       _Philaster_ is too backward in't himself;                 The Gentry do await it, and the people                 Against their nature are all bent for him,                 And like a field of standing Corn, that's mov'd                 With a stiff gale, their heads bow all one way.  _Di_.        The only cause that draws _Philaster_ back                 From this attempt, is the fair Princess love,                 Which he admires and we can now confute.  _Thra_.     Perhaps he'l not believe it.  _Di_.        Why Gentlemen, 'tis without question so.  _Cle_.       I 'tis past speech, she lives dishonestly.                 But how shall we, if he be curious, work                 Upon his faith?  _Thra_.     We all are satisfied within our selves.  _Di_.        Since it is true, and tends to his own good,                 I'le make this new report to be my knowledge,                 I'le say I know it, nay, I'le swear I saw it.  _Cle_.       It will be best.  _Thra_.     'Twill move him.                                         [ _Enter_ Philaster.  _Di_.        Here he comes. Good morrow to your honour,                 We have spent some time in seeking you.  _Phi_.       My worthy friends,                 You that can keep your memories to know                 Your friend in miseries, and cannot frown                 On men disgrac'd for vertue: A good day                 Attend you all. What service may I do worthy your                 acceptation?  _Di_.        My good Lord,                 We come to urge that vertue which we know                 Lives in your breast, forth, rise, and make a head,                 The Nobles, and the people are all dull'd                 With this usurping King: and not a man                 That ever heard the word, or knew such a thing                 As vertue, but will second your attempts.  _Phi_.       How honourable is this love in you                 To me that have deserv'd none? Know my friends                 (You that were born to shame your poor _Philaster_,                 With too much courtesie) I could afford                 To melt my self in thanks; but my designs                 Are not yet ripe, suffice it, that ere long                 I shall imploy your loves: but yet the time is short of                 what I would.  _Di_.        The time is fuller Sir, than you expect;                 That which hereafter will not perhaps be reach'd                 By violence, may now be caught; As for the King,                 You know the people have long hated him;                 But now the Princess, whom they lov'd.  _Phi_.      Why, what of her?  _Di_.        Is loath'd as much as he.  _Phi_.      By what strange means?  _Di_.        She's known a Whore.  _Phi_.       Thou lyest.  _Di_.         My Lord--  _Phi_.       Thou lyest,                                        [_Offers to draw and is held_.                  And thou shalt feel it; I had thought thy mind                 Had been of honour; thus to rob a Lady                 Of her good name, is an infectious sin,                 Not to be pardon'd; be it false as hell,                 'Twill never be redeem'd, if it be sown                 Amongst the people, fruitful to increase                 All evil they shall hear. Let me alone,                 That I may cut off falshood, whilst it springs.                 Set hills on hills betwixt me and the man                 That utters this, and I will scale them all,                 And from the utmost top fall on his neck,                 Like Thunder from a Cloud.  _Di_.        This is most strange;                 Sure he does love her.  _Phi_.       I do love fair truth:                 She is my Mistress, and who injures her,                 Draws vengeance from me Sirs, let go my arms.  _Thra_.     Nay, good my Lord be patient.  _Cle_.       Sir, remember this is your honour'd friend,                 That comes to do his service, and will shew you                 Why he utter'd this.  _Phi_.       I ask you pardon Sir,                 My zeal to truth made me unmannerly:                 Should I have heard dishonour spoke of you,                 Behind your back untruly, I had been                 As much distemper'd, and enrag'd as now.  _Di_.        But this my Lord is truth.  _Phi_.      O say not so, good Sir forbear to say so,                 'Tis the truth that all womenkind is false;                 Urge it no more, it is impossible;                 Why should you think the Princess light?  _Di_.        Why, she was taken at it.  _Phi_.       'Tis false, O Heaven 'tis false: it cannot be,                 Can it? Speak Gentlemen, for love of truth speak;                 Is't possible? can women all be damn'd?  _Di_.        Why no, my Lord.  _Phi_.      Why then it cannot be.  _Di_.        And she was taken with her boy.  _Phi_.      What boy?  _Di_.        A Page, a boy that serves her.  _Phi_.      Oh good gods, a little boy?  _Di_.        I, know you him my Lord?  _Phi_.      Hell and sin know him? Sir, you are deceiv'd;                 I'le reason it a little coldly with you;                 If she were lustful, would she take a boy,                 That knows not yet desire? she would have one                 Should meet her thoughts and knows the sin he acts,                 Which is the great delight of wickedness;                 You are abus'd, and so is she, and I.  _Di_.        How you my Lord?  _Phi_.      Why all the world's abus'd                 In an unjust report.  _Di_.        Oh noble Sir your vertues                 Cannot look into the subtil thoughts of woman.                 In short my Lord, I took them: I my self.  _Phi_.       Now all the Devils thou didst flie from my "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10850"],["title","Philaster; Or, Love Lies a Bleeding (#7)"],["body","rage,                 Would thou hadst ta'ne devils ingendring plagues:                 When thou didst take them, hide thee from my eyes,                 Would thou hadst taken Thunder on thy breast,                 When thou didst take them, or been strucken dumb                 For ever: that this foul deed might have slept in                 silence.  _Thra_.    Have you known him so ill temper'd?  _Cle_.      Never before.  _Phi_.      The winds that are let loose,                 From the four several corners of the earth,                 And spread themselves all over sea and land,                 Kiss not a chaste one. What friend bears a sword                 To run me through?  _Di_.        Why, my Lord, are you so mov'd at this?  _Phi_.      When any falls from vertue I am distract,                 I have an interest in't.  _Di_.        But good my Lord recal your self,                 And think what's best to be done.  _Phi_.       I thank you. I will do it;                 Please you to leave me, I'le consider of it:                 Tomorrow I will find your lodging forth,                 And give you answer                 The readiest way.  _Di_.        All the gods direct you.  _Thra_.    He was extream impatient.  _Cle_.      It was his vertue and his noble mind.                           [_Exeunt_ Di. Cle. _and_ Thra.  _Phi_.       I had forgot to ask him where he took them,                 I'le follow him. O that I had a sea                 Within my breast, to quench the fire I feel;                 More circumstances will but fan this fire;                 It more afflicts me now, to know by whom                 This deed is done, than simply that 'tis done:                 And he that tells me this is honourable,                 As far from lies, as she is far from truth.                 O that like beasts, we could not grieve our selves,                 With that we see not; Bulls and Rams will fight,                 To keep their Females standing in their sight;                 But take 'em from them, and you take at once                 Their spleens away; and they will fall again                 Unto their Pastures, growing fresh and fat,                 And taste the waters of the springs as sweet,                 As 'twas before, finding no start in sleep.                 But miserable man; See, see you gods,                                                [_Enter_ Bellario.                  He walks still; and the face you let him wear                 When he was innocent, is still the same,                 Not blasted; is this justice? Do you mean                 To intrap mortality, that you allow                 Treason so smooth a brow? I cannot now                 Think he is guilty.  _Bell_.      Health to you my Lord;                 The Princess doth commend her love, her life,                 And this unto you.  _Phi_.       Oh _Bellario_,                 Now I perceive she loves me, she does shew it                 In loving thee my boy, she has made thee brave.  _Bell_.      My Lord she has attired me past my wish,                 Past my desert, more fit for her attendant,                 Though far unfit for me, who do attend.  _Phi_.       Thou art grown courtly boy. O let all women                 That love black deeds, learn to dissemble here,                 Here, by this paper she does write to me,                 As if her heart were Mines of Adamant                 To all the world besides, but unto me,                 A maiden snow that melted with my looks.                 Tell me my boy how doth the Princess use thee?                 For I shall guess her love to me by that.  _Bell_.      Scarce like her servant, but as if I were                 Something allied to her; or had preserv'd                 Her life three times by my fidelity.                 As mothers fond do use their only sons;                 As I'de use one, that's left unto my trust,                 For whom my life should pay, if he met harm,                 So she does use me.  _Phi_.       Why, this is wondrous well:                 But what kind language does she feed thee with?  _Bell_.      Why, she does tell me, she will trust my youth                 With all her loving secrets; and does call me                 Her pretty servant, bids me weep no more                 For leaving you: shee'l see my services                 Regarded; and such words of that soft strain,                 That I am nearer weeping when she ends                 Than ere she spake.  _Phi_.       This is much better still.  _Bell_.      Are you ill my Lord?  _Phi_.       Ill? No _Bellario_.  _Bell_.      Me thinks your words                 Fall not from off your tongue so evenly,                 Nor is there in your looks that quietness,                 That I was wont to see.  _Phi_.       Thou art deceiv'd boy:                 And she stroakes thy head?  _Bell_.      Yes.  _Phi_.       And she does clap thy cheeks?  _Bell_.      She does my Lord.  _Phi_.       And she does kiss thee boy? ha!  _Bell_.      How my Lord?  _Phi_.       She kisses thee?  _Bell_.      Not so my Lord.  _Phi_.       Come, come, I know she does.  _Bell_.      No by my life.  _Phi_.      Why then she does not love me; come, she does,                 I had her do it; I charg'd her by all charms                 Of love between us, by the hope of peace                 We should enjoy, to yield thee all delights                 Naked, as to her bed: I took her oath                 Thou should'st enjoy her: Tell me gentle boy,                 Is she not paralleless? Is not her breath                 Sweet as _Arabian_ winds, when fruits are ripe?                 Are not her breasts two liquid Ivory balls?                 Is she not all a lasting Mine of joy?  _Bell_.      I, now I see why my disturbed thoughts                 Were so perplext. When first I went to her,                 My heart held augury; you are abus'd,                 Some villain has abus'd you; I do see                 Whereto you tend; fall Rocks upon his head,                 That put this to you; 'tis some subtil train,                 To bring that noble frame of yours to nought.  _Phi_.       Thou think'st I will be angry with thee; Come                 Thou shalt know all my drift, I hate her more,                 Than I love happiness, and plac'd thee there,                 To pry with narrow eyes into her deeds;                 Hast thou discover'd? Is she fain to lust,                 As I would wish her? Speak some comfort to me.  _Bell_.     My Lord, you did mistake the boy you sent:                 Had she the lust of Sparrows, or of Goats;                 Had she a sin that way, hid from the world,                 Beyond the name of lust, I would not aid                 Her base desires; but what I came to know                 As servant to her, I would not reveal, to make                 my life last ages.  _Phi_.      Oh my heart; this is a salve worse than the main disease.                 Tell me thy thoughts; for I will know the least                 That dwells within thee, or will rip thy heart                 To know it; I will see thy thoughts as plain,                 As I do know thy face.  _Bell_.     Why, so you do.                 She is (for ought I know) by all the gods,                 As chaste as Ice; but were she foul as Hell                 And I did know it, thus; the breath of Kings,                 The points of Swords, Tortures nor Bulls of Brass,                 Should draw it from me.  _Phi_.      Then 'tis no time to dally with thee;                 I will take thy life, for I do hate thee; I could curse                 thee now.  _Bell_.      If you do hate you could not curse me worse;                 The gods have not a punishment in store                 Greater for me, than is your hate.  _Phi_.       Fie, fie, so young and so dissembling;                 Tell me when and where thou di[d]st enjoy her,                 Or let plagues fall on me, if I destroy thee not.  _Bell_.      Heaven knows I never did: and when I lie                 To save my life, may I live long and loath'd.                 Hew me asunder, and whilst I can think                 I'le love those pieces you have cut away,                 Better than those that grow: and kiss these limbs,                 Because you made 'em so.  _Phi_.       Fearest thou not death?                 Can boys contemn that?  _Bell_.      Oh, what boy is he                 Can be content to live to be a man                 That sees the best of men thus passionate, thus                 without reason?  _Phi_.      Oh, but thou dost not know what 'tis to die.  _Bell_.     Yes, I do know my Lord;                 'Tis less than to be born; a lasting sleep,                 A quiet resting from all jealousie;                 A thing we all pursue; I know besides,                 It is but giving over of a game that must be lost.  _Phi_.      But there are pains, false boy,                 For perjur'd souls; think but on these, and then                 Thy heart will melt, and thou wilt utter all.  _Bell_.      May they fall all upon me whilst I live,                 If I be perjur'd, or have ever thought                 Of that you charge me with; if I be false,                 Send me to suffer in those punishments you speak of;                 kill me.  _Phi_.      Oh, what should I do?                 Why, who can but believe him? He does swear                 So earnestly, that if it were not true,                 The gods would not endure him.  Rise _Bellario_,                 Thy protestations are so deep; and thou                 Dost look so truly, when thou utterest them,                 That though I [know] 'em false, as were my hopes,                 I cannot urge thee further; but thou wert                 To blame to injure me, for I must love                 Thy "]]]
