And even supposing they had married, what had happened to the second husband? Widow or no widow, second marriage or no second marriage, defensible or indefensible, was this the right friend for a lad still fresh from Eton, the only son of his mother, who had sent me in secret to his side?  There was only one answer to the last question, whatever might be said or urged in reply to all the rest. I could not but feel that Catherine Evers had been justified in her instinct to an almost miraculous degree; that her worst fears were true enough, so far as the lady was concerned; and that Providence alone could have inspired her to call in an agent who knew what I knew, and who therefore saw his duty as plainly as I already saw mine. But it is one thing to recognise a painful duty and quite another thing to know how to minimise the pain to those most affected by its performance. The problem was no easy one to my mind, and I lay awake upon it far into the night.  Tired out with travel, I fell asleep in the end, to awake with a start in broad daylight. The sun was pouring through the uncurtained dormer-window of my room under the roof. And in the sunlight, looking his best in knickerbockers, as only thin men do, with face greased against wind and glare, and blue spectacles in rest upon an Alpine wideawake, stood the lad who had taken his share in keeping me awake.  \"I'm awfully sorry,\" he began. \"It's horrid cheek, but when I saw your room full of light I thought you might have been even earlier than I was. You must get them to give you curtains up here.\"  He had a note in his hand and I thought by his manner there was something that he wished and yet hesitated to tell me. I accordingly asked him what it was.  \"It's what we were speaking about last night!\" burst out Bob. \"That's why I've come to you. It's these silly fools who can't mind their own business and think everybody else is like themselves! Here's a note from Mrs. Lascelles which makes it plain that that old idiot George is not the only one who has been talking about us, and some of the talk has reached her ears. She doesn't say so in so many words, but I can see it's that. She wants to get out of our expedition to Monte Rosa hut--wants me to go alone. The question is, ought I to let her get out of it? Does it matter one rap what this rabble says about us? I've come to ask your advice--you were such a brick about it all last night--and what you say I'll do.\"  I had begun to smile at Bob's notion of \"a rabble\": this one happened to include a few quite eminent men, as you have seen, to say nothing of the average quality of the crowd, of which I had been able to form some opinion of my own. But I had already noticed in Bob the exclusiveness of the type to which he belonged, and had welcomed it as one does welcome the little faults of the well-night faultless. It was his last sentence that made me feel too great a hypocrite to go on smiling.  \"It may not matter to you,\" I said at length, \"but it may to the lady.\"  \"I suppose it does matter more to them?\"  The sunburnt face, puckered with a wry wistfulness, was only comic in its incongruous coat of grease. But I was under no temptation to smile. I had to confine my mind pretty closely to the general principle, and rather studiously to ignore the particular instance, before I could bring myself to answer the almost infantile inquiry in those honest eyes.  \"My dear fellow, it must!\"  Bob looked disappointed but resigned.  \"Well, then, I won't press it, though I'm not sure that I agree. You see, it's not as though there was or ever would be anything between us. The idea's absurd. We are absolute pals and nothing else. That's what makes all this such a silly bore. It's so unnecessary. Now she wants me to go alone, but I don't see the fun of that.\"  \"Does she ask you to go alone?\"  \"She does. That's the worst of it.\"  I nodded, and he asked me why.  \"She probably thinks it would be the best answer to the tittle-tattlers, Bob.\"  That was not a deliberate lie; not until the words were out did it occur to me that Mrs. Lascelles might now have another object in getting rid of her swain for the day. But Bob's eyes lighted in a way that made me feel a deliberate liar.  \"By Jove!\" he said, \"I never thought of that. I don't agree with her, mind, but if that's her game I'll play it like a book. So long, Duncan! I'm not one of those chaps who ask a man's advice without the slightest intention of ever taking it!\"  \"But I haven't ventured to advise you,\" I reminded the boy, with a cowardly eye to the remotest consequences.  \"Perhaps not, but you've shown me what's the proper thing to do.\" And he went away to do it there and then, like the blameless exception that I found him to so many human rules.  I had my breakfast upstairs after this, and lay for some considerable time a prey to feelings which I shall make no further effort to expound; for this interview had not altered, but only intensified them; and in any case they must be obvious to those who take the trouble to conceive themselves in my unenviable position.  And it was my ironic luck to be so circumstanced in a place where I could have enjoyed life to the hilt! Only to lie with the window open was to breathe air of a keener purity, a finer temper, a more exhilarating freshness, than had ever before entered my lungs; and to get up and look out of the window was to peer into the limpid brilliance of a gigantic crystal, where the smallest object was in startling focus, and the very sunbeams cut with scissors. The people below trailed shadows like running ink. The light was ultra-tropical. One looked for drill suits and pith headgear, and was amazed to find pajamas insufficient at the open window.  Upon the terrace on the other side, when I eventually came down, there were cane chairs and Tauchnitz novels under the umbrella tents, and the telescope out and trained upon a party on the Matterhorn. A group of people were waiting turns at the telescope, my friend Quinby and the hanging judge among them. But I searched under the umbrella tents as well as one could from the top of the steps before hobbling down to join the group.  \"I have looked for an accident through that telescope,\" said the jocose judge, \"fifteen Augusts running. They usually have one the day after I go.\"  \"Good morning, sir!\" was Quinby's greeting; and I was instantly introduced to Sir John Sankey, with such a parade of my military history as made me wince and Sir John's eye twinkle. I fancied he had formed an unkind estimate of my rather overpowering friend, and lived to hear my impression confirmed in unjudicial language. But our first conversation was about the war, and it lasted until the judge's turn came for the telescope.  \"Black with people!\" he ejaculated. \"They ought to have a constable up there to regulate the traffic.\"  But when I looked it was long enough before my inexperienced eye could discern the three midges strung on the single strand of cobweb against the sloping snow.  \"They are coming down,\" explained the obliging Quinby. \"That's one of the most difficult places, the lower edge of the top slope. It's just a little way along to the right where the first accident was.... By the way, your friend Evers says he's going to do the Matterhorn before he goes.\"  It was unwelcome hearing, for Quinby had paused to regale me with a lightning sketch of the first accident, and no one had contradicted his gruesome details.  \"_Is_ young Evers a friend of yours?\" inquired the judge.  \"He is.\"  The judge did not say another word. But Quinby availed himself of the first opportunity of playing Ancient Mariner to my Wedding Guest.  \"I saw you talking to them,\" he told me confidentially, \"last night, you know!\"  \"Indeed.\"  He took me by the sleeve.  \"Of course I don't know what you said, but it's evidently had an effect. Evers has gone off alone for the first time since he has been here.\"  I shifted my position.  \"You evidently keep an eye on him, Mr. Quinby.\"  \"I do, Clephane. I find him a diverting study. He is not the only one in this hotel. There's old Teale on his balcony at the present minute, if you look up. He has the best room in the hotel; the only trouble is that it doesn't face the sun all day; he's not used to being in the shade, and you'll hear him damn the limelight-man in heaps one of these fine mornings. But your enterprising young friend is a more amusing person than Belgrave Teale.\"  I had heard enough of my enterprising young friend from this quarter.  \"Do you never make any expeditions yourself, Mr. Quinby?\"  \"Sometimes.\" Quinby looked puzzled. \"Why do you ask?\" he was constrained to add.  \"You should have volunteered instead of Mrs. Lascelles to-day. It would have been an excellent opportunity for prosecuting your own rather enterprising studies.\"  One would have thought that one's displeasure was plain enough at last; but not a bit of it. So far from resenting the rebuff, the fellow plucked my sleeve, and I saw at a glance that he had not even listened to my too elaborate sarcasm.  \"Talk of the--lady!\" he whispered. \"Here she comes.\"  And a second glance intercepted Mrs. Lascelles on the steps, with her bold good looks and her fine upstanding carriage, cut clean as a diamond in that intensifying atmosphere, and hardly less dazzling to the eye. Yet her cotton gown was simplicity's self; it was the right setting for such natural brilliance, a brilliance of eyes and teeth and colouring, a more uncommon brilliance of expression. Indeed it was a wonderful expression, brave rather than sweet, yet capable of sweetness too, and for the moment at least nobly free from the defensive bitterness which was to mark it later. So she stood upon the steps, the talk of the hotel, trailing, with characteristic independence, a cane chair behind her, while she sought a shady place for it, even as I had stood"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],["title","No Hero (#7)"],["body","for her: before she found one I was hobbling toward her.  \"Oh, thanks, Captain Clephane, but I couldn't think of allowing you! Well, then, between us, if you insist. Here under the wall, I think, is as good a place as any.\"  She pointed out a clear space in the rapidly narrowing ribbon of shade, and there I soon saw Mrs. Lascelles settled with her book (a trashy novel, that somehow brought Catherine Evers rather sharply before my mind's eye) in an isolation as complete as could be found upon the crowded terrace, and too intentional on her part to permit of an intrusion on mine. I lingered a moment, nevertheless.  \"So you didn't go to that hut after all, Mrs. Lascelles?\"  \"No.\" She waited a moment before looking up at me. \"And I'm afraid Mr. Evers will never forgive me,\" she added after her look, in the rich undertone that had impressed me overnight, before the cigarette controversy.  I was not going to say that I had seen Bob before he started, but it was an opportunity of speaking generally of the lad. Thus I found myself commenting on the coincidence of our meeting again--he and I--and again lying before I realised that it was a lie. But Mrs. Lascelles sat looking up at me with her fine and candid eyes, as though she knew as well as I which was the real coincidence, and knew that I knew into the bargain. It gave me the disconcerting sensation of being detected and convicted at one blow. Bob Evers failed me as a topic, and I stood like the fool I felt.  \"I am sure you ought not to stand about so much, Captain Clephane.\"  Mrs. Lascelles was smiling faintly as I prepared to take her hint.  \"Doesn't it really do you any harm?\" she inquired in time to detain me.  \"No, just the opposite. I am ordered to take all the exercise I can.\"  \"Even walking?\"  \"Even hobbling, Mrs. Lascelles, if I don't overdo it.\"  She sat some moments in thought. I guessed what she was thinking, and I was right.  \"There are some lovely walks quite near, Captain Clephane. But you have to climb a little, either going or coming.\"  \"I could climb a little,\" said I, making up my mind. \"It's within the meaning of the act--it would do me good. Which way will you take me, Mrs. Lascelles?\"  Mrs. Lascelles looked up quickly, surprised at a boldness on which I was already complimenting myself. But it is the only way with a bold woman.  \"Did I say I would take you at all, Captain Clephane?\"  \"No, but I very much hope you will.\"  And our eyes met as fairly as they had done by matchlight the night before.  \"Then I will,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"because I want to speak to you.\"     CHAPTER V  A MARKED WOMAN   We had come farther than was wise without a rest, but all the seats on the way were in full view of the hotel, and I had been irritated by divers looks and whisperings as we traversed the always crowded terrace. Bob Evers, no doubt, would have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to them. I myself could pretend to do so, but pretence was evidently one of my strong points. I had not Bob's fine natural regardlessness, for all my seniority and presumably superior knowledge of the world.  So we had climbed the zigzags to the right of the Riffelberg and followed the footpath overlooking the glacier, in the silence enjoined by single file, but at last we were seated on the hillside, a trifle beyond that emerald patch which some humourist has christened the Cricket-ground. Beneath us were the serracs of the Gorner Glacier, teased and tousled like a fringe of frozen breakers. Beyond the serracs was the main stream of comparatively smooth ice, with its mourning band of moraine, and beyond that the mammoth sweep and curve of the Théodule where these glaciers join. Peak after peak of dazzling snow dwindled away to the left. Only the gaunt Riffelhorn reared a brown head against the blue. And there we sat, Mrs. Lascelles and I, with all this before us and a rock behind, while I wondered what my companion meant to say, and how she would begin.  I had not to wonder long.  \"You were very good to me last night, Captain Clephane.\"  There was evidently no beating about the bush for Mrs. Lascelles. I thoroughly approved, but was nevertheless somewhat embarrassed for the moment.  \"I--really I don't know how, Mrs. Lascelles!\"  \"Oh, yes, you do, Captain Clephane; you recognised me at a glance, as I did you.\"  \"I certainly thought I did,\" said I, poking about with the ferrule of one of my sticks.  \"You know you did.\"  \"You are making me know it.\"  \"Captain Clephane, you knew it all along; but we won't argue that point. I am not going to deny my identity. It is very good of you to give me the chance, if rather unnecessary. I am not a criminal. Still you could have made me feel like one, last night, and heaps of men would have done so, either for the fun of it or from want of tact.\"  I looked inquiringly at Mrs. Lascelles. She could tell me what she pleased, but I was not going to anticipate her by displaying an independent knowledge of matters which she might still care to keep to herself. If she chose to open up a painful subject, well, the pain be upon her own head. Yet I must say that there was very little of it in her face as our eyes met. There was the eager candour that one could not help admiring, with the glowing look of gratitude which I had done so ridiculously little to earn; but the fine flushed face betrayed neither pain, nor shame, nor the affectation of one or the other. There was a certain shyness with the candour. That was all.  \"You know quite well what I mean,\" continued Mrs. Lascelles, with a genuine smile at my disingenuous face. \"When you met me before it was under another name, which you have probably quite forgotten.\"  \"No, I remember it.\"  \"Do you remember my husband?\"  \"Perfectly.\"  \"Did you ever hear--\"  Her lip trembled. I dropped my eyes.  \"Yes,\" I admitted, \"or rather I saw it for myself in the papers. It's no use pretending I didn't, nor yet that I was the least bit surprised or--or anything else!\"  That was not one of my tactful speeches. It was culpably, might indeed have been wilfully, ambiguous; and yet it was the kind of clumsy and impulsive utterance which has the ring of a good intention, and is thus inoffensive except to such as seek excuses for offence. My instincts about Mrs. Lascelles did not place her in this category at all. Nevertheless, the ensuing pause was long enough to make me feel uneasy, and my companion only broke it as I was in the act of framing an apology.  \"May I bore you, Captain Clephane?\" she asked abruptly. I looked at her once more. She had regained an equal mastery of face and voice, and the admirable candour of her eyes was undimmed by the smallest trace of tears.  \"You may try,\" said I, smiling with the obvious gallantry.  \"If I tell you something about myself from that time on, will you believe what I say?\"  \"You are the last person whom I should think of disbelieving.\"  \"Thank you, Captain Clephane.\"  \"On the other hand, I would much rather you didn't say anything that gave you pain, or that you might afterward regret.\"  There was a touch of weariness in Mrs. Lascelles's smile, a rather pathetic touch to my mind, as she shook her head.  \"I am not very sensitive to pain,\" she remarked. \"That is the one thing to be said for having to bear a good deal while you are fairly young. I want you to know more about me, because I believe you are the only person here who knows anything at all. And then--you didn't give me away last night!\"  I pointed to the grassy ledge in front of us, such a vivid green against the house now a hundred feet below.  \"I am not pushing you over there,\" I said. \"I take about as much credit for that.\"  \"Ah,\" sighed Mrs. Lascelles, \"but that dear boy, who turns out to be a friend of yours, he knows less than anybody else! He doesn't even suspect. It would have hurt me, yes, it would have hurt even me, to be given away to him! You didn't do it while I was there, and I know you didn't when I had turned my back.\"  \"Of course you know I didn't,\" I echoed rather testily as I took out a cigarette. The case reminded me of the night before. But I did not again hand it to Mrs. Lascelles.  \"Well, then,\" she continued, \"since you didn't give me away, even without thinking, I want you to know that after all there isn't quite so much to give away as there might have been. A divorce, of course, is always a divorce; there is no getting away from that, or from mine. But I really did marry again. And I really am the widow they think I am.\"  I looked quickly up at her, in pure pity and compassion for one gone so far in sorrow and yet such a little way in life. It was a sudden feeling, an unpremeditated look, but I might as well have spoken aloud. Mrs. Lascelles read me unerringly, and she shook her head, sadly but decidedly, while her eyes gazed calmly into mine.  \"_It_ was not a happy marriage, either,\" she said, as impersonally as if speaking of another woman. \"You may think what you like of me for saying so to a comparative stranger; but I won't have your sympathy on false pretences, simply because Major Lascelles is dead. Did you ever meet him, by the way?\"  And she mentioned an Indian regiment. But the major and I had never met.  \"Well, it was not very happy for either of us. I suppose such marriages never are. I know they are never supposed to be. Even if the couple are everything to each other, there is all the world to point his finger, and all the world's wife to turn her back, and you have to care a good deal to get over that. But you may have been desperate in the first instance; you may have said to yourself that the fire couldn't be much worse than the frying-pan. In that case, of course, you deserve no sympathy, and nothing is more irritating to me than the sympathy I don't deserve. It's a matter of temperament; I'm obliged to speak out, even if it puts people more against me than they were already. No, you needn't say anything, Captain Clephane; you didn't express your sympathy, I stopped you "]]]
