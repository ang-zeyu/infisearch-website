When the boat was finished, he began to talk to it as follows: \"My boat, pot, you may go, pot, to find me a wife, pot, prettier than my friend's wife, pot.\" The boat sailed away, and reached a large river, just as some men were looking for a boat to take across the body of their grandmother, in order to bury it in the cemetery of the town. When they saw the boat they were glad to get across the river so easily, so they lifted the body and placed it in the boat. When the boat felt that something was on board, she sailed swiftly towards home, leaving the men behind. Parotpot was watching, and when he saw the boat coming, he began to talk thus: \"My boat, pot, is coming, pot, to bring me, pot, a pretty lady, pot, to marry me, pot.\" But, alas! a dead grandmother, instead of a pretty lady! He was so angry that he seized his bolo and chopped the boat to pieces, leaving the body to float away.  But Parotpot thought that he might succeed better with a fish-trap, like his friend Camanla's. When he had finished it, he sent it to the river, saying: \"My taon, pot, go now to the river, pot, and catch many fishes, pot, for my dinner, pot.\" The taon went. It was Sunday and the people of the town were killing cattle for their Sunday dinner, and throwing the waste into the river. All this filth floated into the taon and filled it. Then it ran back home. While the taon had been gone, Parotpot had been making preparations for a great dinner. He cooked the rice and washed the dishes, and then invited his friends to come to his house and share his excellent dinner. When he saw the taon coming, he said: \"My taon, pot, is coming now, pot, to bring me many fine fish, pot, for my dinner, pot.\" When his neighbors saw what was in the taon, they laughed, and Parotpot said: \"I can never be as happy as my friend Camanla.\" Then he took the taon and threw it into the fire.   CHAPTER 4  Juan, the Student.  There was once a poor couple who lived happily in a quiet place. They had one son, named Juan, whom at first they loved very much; but afterwards, either because their extreme poverty made it difficult for them to support him, or because of his wickedness and waywardness, they began to hate him, and made plans to kill him.  In order to carry out this purpose, the father called his son to him one evening, and said: \"My son, to-morrow we will go to the mountain to get some lumber with which to repair our house. I want you to prepare our breakfast very early, so that we may set out before the sun rises.\"  On the next morning they arose very early and ate their breakfast. As it consisted only of rice and a few small fishes, it was soon finished, and they set out for the mountain. When they had arrived at a lonely spot, the man seized his son and fastened him to a large tree. Then he took his bolo and cut down the tree in such a way as to cause it to fall on the boy and kill him. Then he returned home, thinking that he should have no more trouble on account of his son.  Early the next morning, the man heard a noise as of some one approaching the house. On opening a window he perceived his son, whom he supposed he had killed on the previous day, coming towards the house and bearing a heavy load of wood. When the boy had come near he asked where he should put the wood. At first the father was too much frightened to reply, but at last he told his son to put the wood down near the house.  For a long time Juan lived at home, but his parents hated him continually, and at last decided to give him poison. One day they sent him on a long trip, giving him seven pieces of poisoned bread for his food along the way. When he had become weary and hungry from walking, he sat down under a tree and began to open the handkerchief to get from it some of the bread to eat. Suddenly a number of crows flew down from the tree, seized the bread, ate it, and almost immediately died. The boy at once perceived the intention of his parents and returned home. As soon as he arrived there, he declared to his father and mother his intention of leaving them and going elsewhere to live. As soon as they heard him, they were full of joy, and readily gave him the desired permission.  He went to a distant town, and decided to study. He made such progress that his teachers were charmed with his diligence. He was very fond of debates with his schoolmates, and one day asked them the following riddle: \"Two tried to kill one, one killed seven, two were left, and one went away.\" They searched through the books for the answer to the riddle, but as they were unable to find it, they agreed that Juan was the cleverest one among them, since they could not answer his riddle.  One day the student met a young lady to whom he gave the riddle. She asked for a little time in which to study it, and this being granted, went home, disguised herself as a young man and, returning, asked Juan to tell the answer to the riddle. \"For I know,\" she said, \"that many students have tried to find the solution of this riddle, but have not been successful.\" Juan finally granted her request, and told her the answer to the riddle, which was the story of his life.  Then the young lady returned home, put on her own clothes, and went back to the student's house, to give him the answer to his riddle. When Juan heard her answer, he thought her a very clever young woman, since she had succeeded where so many young men had failed, so he fell in love with the young lady and married her.   CHAPTER 5  The Two Wives and the Witch.  There was once a man who had a wife that was not pretty. He became tired of looking at her, and so went away and married another wife.  His first wife was in great sorrow, and wept every day. One day as she was crying by the well, where she had gone for water, a woman asked her: \"Why are you weeping?\" The wife answered: \"Because my husband has left me and gone to live with another wife.\" \"Why?\" said the witch, for that is what the woman was.  \"Because I have not a pretty face,\" answered the wife. While she was talking the witch touched the wife's face, and then she said: \"I cannot stay here any longer,\" and went off.  When the wife reached home she looked in the glass and saw that her face had been changed until it was the most beautiful in the town. Very soon a rumor spread through the town that in such and such a house there was living a very beautiful woman. Many young men went to see the pretty woman, and all were pleased with her beauty.  The bad husband went also. He was astonished that his wife was not at home, and that a pretty woman was living there alone. He bowed to the lady and avowed his love. The lady at first refused to believe him, and said: \"If you will leave the woman who is now your wife and come to live with me right along I will take you for my husband.\" The man agreed, and went to live with the pretty woman.  The other woman was very angry when she heard the news, for it was reported that the pretty woman was the man's first wife, who had been changed by a witch. She determined to try what the witch could do for her, and went to get water at the same well.  The witch appeared and asked: \"Why are you weeping, my good woman?\" The woman told her that her husband had gone away to live with the pretty woman. As she was speaking, the witch touched her face, and said: \"Go home, my good woman, and do not weep, for your husband will come very soon to see you.\"  When she heard this she ran home as fast as she could. All the people whom she met on the road were afraid of her, because she was so ugly. Her nose was about two feet long, her ears looked like large handkerchiefs, and her eyes were as big as saucers. Nobody recognized her, not even her mother. All were afraid of such a creature. When she saw in the glass how ugly she was, she refused to eat, and in a few days she died.   CHAPTER 6  The Living Head.  There once lived a man and his wife who had no children. They earnestly desired to have a son, so they prayed to their God, Diva, that he would give them a son, even if it were only a head.  Diva pitied them, and gave them a head for a son. Head, for that was his name, grew up, and gradually his father and mother ceased to think of his misfortune, and grew to love him very much.  One day Head saw the chief's daughter pass the house, and fell in love with her. \"Mother,\" he said, \"I am in love with the chief's daughter and wish to marry her. Go now, I pray you, to the chief and ask him to give me his daughter to be my wife.\" \"Dear Head,\" answered his mother, \"it is of no use to go on such an errand, the chief's daughter will surely not be willing to marry only a head.\" But Head insisted, so, in order to quiet him, his mother went to the chief and made known her son's desire. Of course she met with a refusal, and returned home and told Head the result of her errand.  Head went downstairs into the garden and began to sink into the ground.  \"Head, come up,\" said his mother, \"and let us eat.\"  \"Sink! sink! sink!\" cried Head.  \"Head, come up and let us eat!\" repeated his mother.  \"Sink! sink! sink!\" was Head's answer, and he continued to sink until he could no longer be seen. His mother tried in vain to take him out. After a while a tree sprang up just where Head had sunk, and in a short time it bore large, round fruit, almost as large as a child's head. This is the origin of the orange-tree.   CHAPTER 7  Juan Pusong.  The Visayans tell many stories which have as their hero Juan Pusong, or Tricky John. As the name implies, he is represented as being deceitful and dishonest, sometimes very cunning, and, in some of the stories told of him, endowed with miraculous power. The stories are very simple and of not very great excellence. The few which follow will serve as samples of the narratives told of this popular hero.    I. Juan Pusong was a lazy boy.

His mother, however, believed him to be in school, and each day prepared some dainty for him to eat upon his return home. Juan was not satisfied with deceiving his mother in this way, but used to play tricks on her.  \"Mother,\" he said, one day, \"I have already learned to be a seer and to discover what is hidden. This afternoon when I come home from school I will foretell what you have prepared for me.\"  \"Will you?\" said his mother joyfully, for she believed all he said, \"I will try to prepare something new and you will not be able to guess it.\"  \"I shall, mother, I shall, let it be whatever it may,\" answered Juan. When it was time to go to school, Juan pretended to set out, but instead he climbed a tree which stood near the kitchen, and hiding himself among the leaves, watched through the window all that his mother did.  His mother baked a bibingca, or cake made of rice and sweet potato, and hid it in a jar. \"I will bet anything,\" she said, \"that my son will not guess what it is.\" Juan laughed at his mother's self-conceit. When it was time for school to close he got down, and with a book in his hand, as though he had really come from school, appeared before his mother and said: \"Mother, I know what you are keeping for me.\"  \"What is it?\" asked his mother.  \"The prophecy that I have just learned at school says that there is a bibingca hidden in the olla.\" The mother became motionless with surprise. \"Is it possible?\" she asked herself, \"my son is indeed a seer. I am going to spread it abroad. My son is a seer.\"  The news was spread far and wide and many people came to make trial of Pusong's powers. In these he was always successful, thanks to his ability to cheat.    II. One day a ship was anchored in the harbor. She had come from a distant island. Her captain had heard of Pusong's power and wished to try him. The trial consisted in foretelling how many seeds the oranges with which his vessel was loaded contained. He promised to give Juan a great quantity of money if he could do this.  Pusong asked for a day's time. That night he swam out to the vessel, and, hidden in the water under the ship's stern, listened to the conversation of the crew. Luckily they were talking about this very matter of the oranges, and one of them inquired of the captain what kind of oranges he had.  \"My friend,\" said the captain, \"these oranges are different from any in this country, for each contains but one seed.\"  Pusong had learned all that he needed to know, so he swam back to the shore, and the next morning announced that he was ready for the trial.  Many people had assembled to hear the great seer. Pusong continued to read in his book, as though it was the source of his information. The hour agreed upon struck, and the captain of the vessel handed an orange to Juan and said: \"Mr. Pusong, you may tell us how many seeds this orange contains.\"  Pusong took the orange and smelled it. Then he opened his book and after a while said: \"This orange you have presented me with contains but one seed.\"  The orange was cut and but the one seed found in it, so Pusong was paid the money. Of course he obtained a great reputation throughout the country, and became very rich.    III. Juan Pusong's father drove his cows out one day to pasture. Juan slipped secretly from the house, and going to the pasture, took the cows into the forest and tied them there. When his father was going for the cows he met Juan and asked: \"Where did you come from?\" The boy replied: \"I have just come from school. What are you looking for?\"  \"I am looking for our cows,\" said his father.  \"Why did n't you tell me that before,\" asked Juan. \"Wait a minute,\" and he took his little book from his pocket and, looking into it, said: \"Our cows are in such a place in the forest, tied together. Go and get them.\" So his father went to the place where Juan said the cows were and found them. Afterwards it was discovered that Juan could not read even his own name, so his father beat him for the trick he had played.    IV. Pusong and Tabloc-laui. Pusong had transgressed the law, and was for this reason put into a cage to be in a short time submerged with it into the sea.  Tabloc-laui, a friend of Pusong's, passed by and saw him in the cage. \"What are you there for?\" Tabloc-laui asked.  \"Oh!\" answered Pusong, \"I am a prisoner here, as you see, because the chief wants me to marry his daughter and I don't want to do it. I am to stay here until I consent.\"  \"What a fool you are!\" said Tabloc-laui. \"The chief's daughter is pretty, and I am surprised that you are not willing to marry her.\"  \"Hear me, Tabloc-laui!\" said the prisoner. \"If you want to marry the chief's daughter, let me out and get in here in my place; for tomorrow they will come and ask you if you will consent. Then you will be married at once.\"  \"I am willing!\" exclaimed Tabloc-laui. \"Get out and I will take your place!\"  Next morning the chief ordered his soldiers to take the cage with the prisoner to the sea and submerge it in the water.  Tabloc-laui, on seeing the soldiers coming toward him, thought they would make inquiries of him as Pusong had said.  \"I am ready now,\" he said, \"I am ready to be the princess's husband.\"  \"Is this crazy fellow raving?\" asked the soldiers. \"We are ordered to take you and submerge you in the sea.\"  \"But,\" objected Tabloc-laui, \"I am ready now to marry the chief's daughter.\"  He was carried to the sea and plunged into the water, in spite of his crying, \"I am not Pusong! I am Tabloc-laui!\"  The next week the chief was in his boat, going from one fish-trap to another, to inspect them. Pusong swam out to the boat.  The chief, on seeing him, wondered, for he believed that Pusong was dead. \"How is this?\" he asked. \"Did you not drown last week?\"  \"By no means. I sank to the bottom, but I found that there was no water there. There is another world where the dead live again. I saw your father and he charged me to bid you go to him, and afterwards you will be able to come back here, if you wish to do so.\" \"Is that really true, Pusong?\" asked the chief. \"Yes, it is really true,\" was the reply.  \"Well, I will go there. I will have a cage made and go through the way you did.\"  So the next morning the chief was submerged in the water, with the hope of coming back. When a considerable time had elapsed without seeing his return, his servants searched for Pusong, in order to punish him, but he had escaped to the mountains.    V. The Enchanted Prince. There was once a king who had three young and beautiful daughters named Isabel, Catalina, and Maria.  In the capital city of the kingdom lived a young man known by the name of Juan Pusong. He had as friends an ape, named Amo-Mongo, and a wildcat, whose name was Singalong. The three friends were passing one day in front of the palace, and, seeing the three young ladies, were greatly charmed by their beauty.  Pusong, who posed as a young aristocrat of considerable learning, determined to go before the king and declare his love for the Princess Isabel. The king received him favorably, and offered him a seat; but Juan refused to sit down until he should know the result of his request.  The king was astonished at his manner, and asked him what he wanted. Juan replied that he had presumptuously allowed himself to be charmed by the beauty of the Princess Isabel, and humbly requested the king's consent to their marriage. The king had the princess summoned before him, and in the presence of Pusong asked her if she would accept this man as her husband. She dutifully expressed her willingness to do whatever her father wished, so the king granted the request of Pusong, who was immediately married to Isabel.  When Amo-Mongo saw how successful Pusong had been, he presented himself before the king, as his friend had done, and requested the hand of the Princess Catalina. The king, somewhat unwillingly, gave his consent, and these two were also married.  When Singalong saw to what high positions his friends had attained, he became desirous of like fortune, so he went to the king and obtained his consent to his marriage with the Princess Maria.  All three of the king's sons-in-law lived with their wives at the palace, at the king's expense. The latter seeing that his daughters' husbands were lazy fellows, determined to make them useful, so he sent Pusong and Amo-Mongo out to take charge of his estates in the country, while to Singalong he gave the oversight of the servants who worked in the kitchen of the palace.  Pusong and Amo-Mongo went out to the hacienda with the intention of doing something, but when they arrived there, they found so much to do that they concluded that it would be impossible to attend to everything and so decided to do nothing.  The latter, after merely looking over the estate, entered the forest, in order to visit his relatives there. His fellow monkeys, who knew of his marriage with the princess, believed him to be of some importance, and begged him to save them from the famine which was devastating the forest. This Amo-Mongo, with much boasting of his wealth, promised to do, declaring that at the time of harvest he would give them plenty of rice.  When Pusong and his companion returned to the palace they were asked by the king how many acres they had cleared. They replied that they had cleared and planted about one thousand acres. The king was satisfied with their answer, and, at Amo-Mongo's request, gave orders for a large quantity of rice to be carried from the storehouse to the spot in the forest where his son-in-law had promised the monkeys that they should find it.  On the other hand, Singalong during the day did nothing, and as the king never saw him at work he disliked his third son-in-law very much. Yet every morning there were great piles of fish and vegetables in the palace kitchen. Amo-Mongo, knowing that his brother-in-law"]]]
