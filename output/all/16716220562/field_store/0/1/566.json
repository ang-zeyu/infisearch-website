I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized with me in the least when they found me uninjured.  I rather enjoyed the joke myself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later, and I believe before the mutineers were tried.  I hope they got clear, because, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in the brain of a very weak and sick man.  After reaching shore, or Shell Island, the labor of getting to Corpus Christi was slow and tedious.  There was, if my memory serves me, but one small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the 4th infantry arrived.  Others were procured later.  The distance from Shell Island to Corpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles.  The channel to the bay was so shallow that the steamer, small as it was, had to be dragged over the bottom when loaded.  Not more than one trip a day could be effected.  Later this was remedied, by deepening the channel and increasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation.  Corpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name, formed by the entrance of the Nueces River into tide-water, and is on the west bank of that bay.  At the time of its first occupancy by United States troops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably less than one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American trading post, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers.  All goods were put up in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable for loading on pack mules.  Two of these packages made a load for an ordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones.  The bulk of the trade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes.  The Mexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer in exchange except silver.  The trade in tobacco was enormous, considering the population to be supplied.  Almost every Mexican above the age of ten years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette.  Nearly every Mexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco, powdered by rolling in the hands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.  The cigarettes were made by the smokers as they used them.  Up to the time of which I write, and for years afterwards--I think until the administration of President Juarez--the cultivation, manufacture and sale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk of the revenue collected from internal sources.  The price was enormously high, and made successful smuggling very profitable.  The difficulty of obtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female, used it at that time.  I know from my own experience that when I was at West Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, and the mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority of the cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it.  I failed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but the majority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.  Under Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything that the mother-country could supply.  This rule excluded the cultivation of the grape, olive and many other articles to which the soil and climate were well adapted.  The country was governed for \"revenue only;\" and tobacco, which cannot be raised in Spain, but is indigenous to Mexico, offered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object of government.  The native population had been in the habit of using \"the weed\" from a period, back of any recorded history of this continent. Bad habits--if not restrained by law or public opinion--spread more rapidly and universally than good ones, and the Spanish colonists adopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives.  Spain, therefore, in order to secure the largest revenue from this source, prohibited the cultivation, except in specified localities--and in these places farmed out the privilege at a very high price.  The tobacco when raised could only be sold to the government, and the price to the consumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities, and the capacity of the people to pay.  All laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain, and the officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown, and sent out to the New El Dorado.  The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant of how to legislate or how to rule. When they gained their independence, after many years of war, it was the most natural thing in the world that they should adopt as their own the laws then in existence.  The only change was, that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and the recipient of the revenues.  The tobacco tax, yielding so large a revenue under the law as it stood, was one of the last, if not the very last, of the obnoxious imposts to be repealed.  Now, the citizens are allowed to cultivate any crops the soil will yield.  Tobacco is cheap, and every quality can be produced. Its use is by no means so general as when I first visited the country.  Gradually the \"Army of Occupation\" assembled at Corpus Christi.  When it was all together it consisted of seven companies of the 2d regiment of dragoons, four companies of light artillery, five regiments of infantry --the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th--and one regiment of artillery acting as infantry--not more than three thousand men in all.  General Zachary Taylor commanded the whole.  There were troops enough in one body to establish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers for all they were capable of in case of battle.  The rank and file were composed of men who had enlisted in time of peace, to serve for seven dollars a month, and were necessarily inferior as material to the average volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight, and also to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union. The men engaged in the Mexican war were brave, and the officers of the regular army, from highest to lowest, were educated in their profession. A more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe ever fought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his first two engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil.  The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed territory furthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient to provoke hostilities.  We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was essential that Mexico should commence it.  It was very doubtful whether Congress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, the Executive could announce, \"Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,\" and prosecute the contest with vigor.  Once initiated there were but few public men who would have the courage to oppose it.  Experience proves that the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, no matter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life or history.  Better for him, individually, to advocate \"war, pestilence, and famine,\" than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun.  The history of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter, compared with that of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against his government while protected by it.  The most favorable posthumous history the stay-at-home traitor can hope for is--oblivion.  Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the invaders from her soil, it became necessary for the \"invaders\" to approach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly, preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to a point near Matamoras.  It was desirable to occupy a position near the largest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutely invading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.  The distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred and fifty miles.  The country does not abound in fresh water, and the length of the marches had to be regulated by the distance between water supplies.  Besides the streams, there were occasional pools, filled during the rainy season, some probably made by the traders, who travelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande, and some by the buffalo. There was not at that time a single habitation, cultivated field, or herd of domestic animals, between Corpus Christi and Matamoras.  It was necessary, therefore, to have a wagon train sufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage, officers' baggage, rations for the army, and part rations of grain for the artillery horses and all the animals taken from the north, where they had been accustomed to having their forage furnished them.  The army was but indifferently supplied with transportation.  Wagons and harness could easily be supplied from the north but mules and horses could not so readily be brought.  The American traders and Mexican smugglers came to the relief.  Contracts were made for mules at from eight to eleven dollars each.  The smugglers furnished the animals, and took their pay in goods of the description before mentioned.  I doubt whether the Mexicans received in value from the traders five dollars per head for the animals they furnished, and still more, whether they paid anything but their own time in procuring them.  Such is trade; such is war.  The government paid in hard cash to the contractor the stipulated price.  Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a large band of wild horses feeding; as numerous, probably, as the band of buffalo roaming further north was before its rapid extermination commenced.  The Mexicans used to capture these in large numbers and bring them into the American settlements and sell them.  A picked animal could be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars, but taken at wholesale, they could be bought for thirty-six dollars a dozen.  Some of these were purchased for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1067"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant — Volume 1 (#8)"],["body",", and answered a most useful purpose. The horses were generally very strong, formed much like the Norman horse, and with very heavy manes and tails.  A number of officers supplied themselves with these, and they generally rendered as useful service as the northern animal in fact they were much better when grazing was the only means of supplying forage.  There was no need for haste, and some months were consumed in the necessary preparations for a move.  In the meantime the army was engaged in all the duties pertaining to the officer and the soldier.  Twice, that I remember, small trains were sent from Corpus Christi, with cavalry escorts, to San Antonio and Austin, with paymasters and funds to pay off small detachments of troops stationed at those places.  General Taylor encouraged officers to accompany these expeditions.  I accompanied one of them in December, 1845.  The distance from Corpus Christi to San Antonio was then computed at one hundred and fifty miles. Now that roads exist it is probably less.  From San Antonio to Austin we computed the distance at one hundred and ten miles, and from the latter place back to Corpus Christi at over two hundred miles.  I know the distance now from San Antonio to Austin is but little over eighty miles, so that our computation was probably too high.  There was not at the time an individual living between Corpus Christi and San Antonio until within about thirty miles of the latter point, where there were a few scattering Mexican settlements along the San Antonio River.  The people in at least one of these hamlets lived underground for protection against the Indians.  The country abounded in game, such as deer and antelope, with abundance of wild turkeys along the streams and where there were nut-bearing woods.  On the Nueces, about twenty-five miles up from Corpus Christi, were a few log cabins, the remains of a town called San Patricio, but the inhabitants had all been massacred by the Indians, or driven away.  San Antonio was about equally divided in population between Americans and Mexicans.  From there to Austin there was not a single residence except at New Braunfels, on the Guadalupe River.  At that point was a settlement of Germans who had only that year come into the State.  At all events they were living in small huts, about such as soldiers would hastily construct for temporary occupation.  From Austin to Corpus Christi there was only a small settlement at Bastrop, with a few farms along the Colorado River; but after leaving that, there were no settlements except the home of one man, with one female slave, at the old town of Goliad.  Some of the houses were still standing.  Goliad had been quite a village for the period and region, but some years before there had been a Mexican massacre, in which every inhabitant had been killed or driven away.  This, with the massacre of the prisoners in the Alamo, San Antonio, about the same time, more than three hundred men in all, furnished the strongest justification the Texans had for carrying on the war with so much cruelty.  In fact, from that time until the Mexican war, the hostilities between Texans and Mexicans was so great that neither was safe in the neighborhood of the other who might be in superior numbers or possessed of superior arms.  The man we found living there seemed like an old friend; he had come from near Fort Jessup, Louisiana, where the officers of the 3d and 4th infantry and the 2d dragoons had known him and his family.  He had emigrated in advance of his family to build up a home for them.    CHAPTER V.  TRIP TO AUSTIN--PROMOTION TO FULL SECOND LIEUTENANT--ARMY OF OCCUPATION.  When our party left Corpus Christi it was quite large, including the cavalry escort, Paymaster, Major Dix, his clerk and the officers who, like myself, were simply on leave; but all the officers on leave, except Lieutenant Benjamin--afterwards killed in the valley of Mexico --Lieutenant, now General, Augur, and myself, concluded to spend their allotted time at San Antonio and return from there.  We were all to be back at Corpus Christi by the end of the month.  The paymaster was detained in Austin so long that, if we had waited for him, we would have exceeded our leave.  We concluded, therefore, to start back at once with the animals we had, and having to rely principally on grass for their food, it was a good six days' journey.  We had to sleep on the prairie every night, except at Goliad, and possibly one night on the Colorado, without shelter and with only such food as we carried with us, and prepared ourselves.  The journey was hazardous on account of Indians, and there were white men in Texas whom I would not have cared to meet in a secluded place. Lieutenant Augur was taken seriously sick before we reached Goliad and at a distance from any habitation.  To add to the complication, his horse--a mustang that had probably been captured from the band of wild horses before alluded to, and of undoubted longevity at his capture--gave out. It was absolutely necessary to get for ward to Goliad to find a shelter for our sick companion.  By dint of patience and exceedingly slow movements, Goliad was at last reached, and a shelter and bed secured for our patient.  We remained over a day, hoping that Augur might recover sufficiently to resume his travels.  He did not, however, and knowing that Major Dix would be along in a few days, with his wagon-train, now empty, and escort, we arranged with our Louisiana friend to take the best of care of the sick lieutenant until thus relieved, and went on.  I had never been a sportsman in my life; had scarcely ever gone in search of game, and rarely seen any when looking for it.  On this trip there was no minute of time while travelling between San Patricio and the settlements on the San Antonio River, from San Antonio to Austin, and again from the Colorado River back to San Patricio, when deer or antelope could not be seen in great numbers. Each officer carried a shot-gun, and every evening, after going into camp, some would go out and soon return with venison and wild turkeys enough for the entire camp.  I, however, never went out, and had no occasion to fire my gun; except, being detained over a day at Goliad, Benjamin and I concluded to go down to the creek--which was fringed with timber, much of it the pecan--and bring back a few turkeys.  We had scarcely reached the edge of the timber when I heard the flutter of wings overhead, and in an instant I saw two or three turkeys flying away.  These were soon followed by more, then more, and more, until a flock of twenty or thirty had left from just over my head.  All this time I stood watching the turkeys to see where they flew--with my gun on my shoulder, and never once thought of levelling it at the birds.  When I had time to reflect upon the matter, I came to the conclusion that as a sportsman I was a failure, and went back to the house.  Benjamin remained out, and got as many turkeys as he wanted to carry back.  After the second night at Goliad, Benjamin and I started to make the remainder of the journey alone.  We reached Corpus Christi just in time to avoid \"absence without leave.\"  We met no one not even an Indian --during the remainder of our journey, except at San Patricio.  A new settlement had been started there in our absence of three weeks, induced possibly by the fact that there were houses already built, while the proximity of troops gave protection against the Indians.  On the evening of the first day out from Goliad we heard the most unearthly howling of wolves, directly in our front.  The prairie grass was tall and we could not see the beasts, but the sound indicated that they were near.  To my ear it appeared that there must have been enough of them to devour our party, horses and all, at a single meal.  The part of Ohio that I hailed from was not thickly settled, but wolves had been driven out long before I left.  Benjamin was from Indiana, still less populated, where the wolf yet roamed over the prairies.  He understood the nature of the animal and the capacity of a few to make believe there was an unlimited number of them.  He kept on towards the noise, unmoved.  I followed in his trail, lacking moral courage to turn back and join our sick companion. I have no doubt that if Benjamin had proposed returning to Goliad, I would not only have \"seconded the motion\" but have suggested that it was very hard-hearted in us to leave Augur sick there in the first place; but Benjamin did not propose turning back.  When he did speak it was to ask: \"Grant, how many wolves do you think there are in that pack?\" Knowing where he was from, and suspecting that he thought I would over-estimate the number, I determined to show my acquaintance with the animal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct, and answered:  \"Oh, about twenty,\" very indifferently.  He smiled and rode on.  In a minute we were close upon them, and before they saw us.  There were just TWO of them.  Seated upon their haunches, with their mouths close together, they had made all the noise we had been hearing for the past ten minutes.  I have often thought of this incident since when I have heard the noise of a few disappointed politicians who had deserted their associates.  There are always more of them before they are counted.  A week or two before leaving Corpus Christi on this trip, I had been promoted from brevet second-lieutenant, 4th infantry, to full second-lieutenant, 7th infantry.  Frank Gardner,(*1) of the 7th, was promoted to the 4th in the same orders.  We immediately made application to be transferred, so as to get back to our old regiments.  On my return, I found that our application had been approved at Washington. While in the 7th infantry I was in the company of Captain Holmes, afterwards a Lieutenant-general in the Confederate army. I never came in contact with him in the war of the Rebellion, nor did he render any very conspicuous service "]]]
