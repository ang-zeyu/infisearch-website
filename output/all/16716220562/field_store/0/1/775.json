Here was a sight to come again and rend the memory.  The crowds were endeavoring to get away over one of the two avenues of escape still open.  I estimated that between five in the afternoon and the following dawn three hundred thousand persons must have passed through the city's gates.  They were the people of Antwerp itself, swelled by exiles from Alost, Aerschot, Malines, Termonde, and other cities to the south and west.  Intermittently for two days and nights I watched them from my room in the Queen's.  From five yards beneath my window ledge came the shuffle, shuffle of unending feet, the creak and groans of heavy cart wheels, the talk and babble of guttural tongues, the yelp of hounds, as the thousands moved and wept and surged and jostled along throughout the night and into the uncertain mist of that October morning.  They were so close I could have jumped into their carts or dropped a pebble on their heads. Infinitely more impressive than the retreat of the allied armies or the victorious entry of the Germans a little later, was the pageant of this pitiful army without guns or leaders.  The twenty-foot entrance to that pontoon bridge seemed to me like the mouth of a funnel through which poured the dense misery of an entire nation.  Think of this army's composition: a great city was emptying itself of human life; not only a great city, but all the people driven to it from the outside, all who had congregated in Belgium's last refuge and its strongest fort.  They bore themselves bravely, the greater number plodding along silently in the footsteps of those who went ahead, with no thoughts of their direction, some of them even chatting and laughing.  You saw great open wagons carrying baby carriages, perambulators, pots and kettles, an old chair, huge bundles of household goods, and the ubiquitous Belgian bicycle strapped to the side.  There were small wagons, and more great wagons crowded with twenty, thirty, forty people: aged brown women, buried like shrunk walnuts in a mass of shawls, girls sitting listlessly on piles of straw, and children fitfully asleep or very much awake and crying lustily.  Sometimes the men and boys mounted their bicycles, rode for a dozen yards, were stopped by the procession, and then, for want of better occupation, rang their bells.  One saw innumerable yelping dogs: big Belgian police hounds harnessed to the cart and doing their share of work, others sniffing along the outskirts and plainly advertising for an owner.  There were noisy cattle, too, some of which escaped.  Long after the city was evacuated I saw a cow bellowing under an archway of the Cathedral of Notre Dame.  In this way the city emptied itself, but so slowly that the very slowness of the movement wore the marchers out.  Each family group was limited to the speed of its oldest member.  Hundreds gave it up and lay by the road, or formed little gypsy camps under the trees.  At night these were lighted by fires, overshadowed by the greater fire from the distant burning city, and beside them stretched dumb-looking souls, watching vaguely those who still had strength to move.  Watching these wretches got so on my nerves that I had to get out and do something.  With a British intelligence officer, formerly of Sir John French's staff, I wandered down to the southern quarter of the city known as Berchem.  As usual, the guns at the outer forts had been booming throughout the evening.  From the city's ramparts you could not only feel the shudder of the earth, but you could see occasional splashes of flame from the Belgian batteries, answered, in the dim distance to the south, by smaller, less vivid splashes issuing from the mouths of the German instruments of \"Culture\" which throughout the night pounded ruthlessly on the unprotected houses without the city limits.  On the way home we stopped in at the British field hospital to see a wounded British friend.     Chapter VI  The Surrender Of Antwerp    As we left the British field hospital, on the Rue de Leopold, a shrieking skyrocket whizzed by above us and buried its hissing head in the river to the north.  One or two more fell at a distance of several hundred yards, and in the southern part of the city flames from several houses shot up into the quiet, windless night.  The bombardment was on--the time was 12.07 Wednesday midnight.  For a moment I did not realize that this was the beginning of the end of Antwerp.  I had heard so much gun-fire and seen so many bombs dropping from aeroplanes that I did not fully appreciate the significance of these shells.  I scribbled a few notes in my diary, unstrapped my money belt, and then picked out an empty bed at the Queen's Hotel and tumbled in.  I must have slept for six or seven hours.  When I arose everything was quiet.  The hotel was apparently deserted.  I remember being particularly irritated because there was no one in the kitchen who would give me breakfast, so I made myself some tea and then strolled into the street.  It so happened that the Germans had been pumping lead steadily into the city for six hours and that this was the morning lull.  The Germans are methodical in everything.  When they bombard a city they stop for breakfast.  As I walked down the Avenue de Keyser I thought at first it was Sunday--or rather a year of Sundays all rolled into one.  Overnight the city had been transformed into a tomb.  Shops were closed; iron shutters were pulled down everywhere; trolley cars stood in the street as they had been left.  My own footsteps resounded fearfully on the pavement, and I walked five blocks before I saw a human being.  I stopped at the American Consul's office on the Place de Meir, only to find the place was locked.  A frightened face behind the grating told me that the consul had taken his wife to the country--good place to be in, I thought.  Things began to seem lonely.  I heard shells falling and saw flames in the southern quarter of the city, and decided to go in that direction to look up an American correspondent and two photographers who had asked me to bunk with them in the cellar of a little abandoned house at 74 Rue de Peage.  Turning down a little side street leading toward the Boulevard de Leopold, I was greeted by a clap of thunder overhead.  A shell demolished a house across the street and about thirty yards down. The concussion knocked over a couple of babies.  I picked them up, put them back in the doorway of the house where they seemed to belong, saying over and over again mechanically, \"There, there, don't cry. There is nothing to be frightened about\"; and then, just to show how little I myself was frightened I began to run.  I ran for all I was worth.  I ran right into the fire.  The shells were falling fairly thick on the Boulevard de Leopold; every two or three hundred yards a house was partially destroyed; bricks and glass littered the pavement, and occasionally, every quarter of a mile or so, I saw a figure skulking along under the eaves of a building, crouching and ducking in time to the nasty music of the shells.  But I decided that the middle of the street was the safest part.  When I had gone about a quarter of a mile I got my nerve again.  I put my hands in my pockets, lighted a cigarette, and was just saying to myself, \"This is pretty good fun, after all,\" when CRASH!! CRASH!! two, or possibly three, shells, bursting in rapid succession, tore down houses a hundred yards ahead of me.  Then one struck in the street, and jagged fragments of angry shrapnel skidded along the pavement like a thrown stone skipping along the surface of the water.  I was again trembling all over.  Was the game worth the candle, I asked myself.  \"I've come three thousand miles and overcome every obstacle just to get into this horrible mess.  If I get disfigured--no, I'd much rather be killed--will it--\"  \"Crash!! Bang!!\" went a monster shell as I turned the corner.  Two doors from the corner of a narrow street covered with bricks and mortar fluttered a United States flag, and beneath it the door of 74 Rue de Peage.  This place was later spoken of as \"Thompson's fort,\" because Donald C.  Thompson, a Kansas photographer, took possession of it after the Belgian family fled, and plundered the neighborhood for coffee, rolls, and meat, with which he stocked his little cellar.  The house next door had already been struck, and shattered glass littered the pavement.  The doorstep of 74 was covered by a couple of mattresses and sand-bags.  Beneath this, in a dingy sort of coal-bin, heaped with straw, I found crouching the tenants of \"Thompson's fort.\"  Next to Berchem, the southern quarter of the city, where the Germans were approaching, the Rue de Peage was the worst spot in Antwerp.  We sat for a time listening to the shells.  There were here, in addition to Thompson, Edwin Weigel, a Chicago photographer; Edward Eyre Hunt, of \"Collier's Weekly\"; and the Dutch Vice-Consul.  We heard the distant resounding Boom ... Boom ... Boom ... ed ...  Boom ... Boom ... Boom.  An interval of perhaps a second's silence, then a faint moaning, a crescendo wail, the whirr and rush of a snarling, shrieking skyrocket overhead, and a crash, like all the thunders of the universe rolled into one, when the shell struck, followed by the roar of falling brick as a neighboring house came pouring into the street.  \"Whee.....wheee.....Hi.....HIOU UIOUW,\" we heard.  \"Whee ... whEEE ...  whEEE ... UIOUW ... OUWW ... SSH ... SSHSHHH ... BANG ... BANG!!!!!!\"  \"Whee.....wheee.....Hi.....HIOUUIOUW,\" we heard.  \"Whee ... whEEE ... whEEE ... UIOUW... OUWW... SSH ... SSHSHHH... BANG... BANG!!!!!!\"  I tried to persuade the other fellows to come up to the Queen's Hotel along the Scheldt waterfront on the northern side of the city, where I was then encamped.  It was a safer locality because the Germans had not yet got the range of the northern end of the city.

CHAPTER I.   _The backwoods settlement--Crusoe's parentage, and early history--The agonizing pains and sorrows of his puppyhood, and other interesting matters_.  The dog Crusoe was once a pup. Now do not, courteous reader, toss your head contemptuously, and exclaim, \"Of course he was; I could have told _you_ that.\" You know very well that you have often seen a man above six feet high, broad and powerful as a lion, with a bronzed shaggy visage and the stern glance of an eagle, of whom you have said, or thought, or heard others say, \"It is scarcely possible to believe that such a man was once a squalling baby.\" If you had seen our hero in all the strength and majesty of full-grown doghood, you would have experienced a vague sort of surprise had we told you--as we now repeat--that the dog Crusoe was once a pup--a soft, round, sprawling, squeaking pup, as fat as a tallow candle, and as blind as a bat.  But we draw particular attention to the fact of Crusoe's having once been a pup, because in connection with the days of his puppyhood there hangs a tale.  This peculiar dog may thus be said to have had two tails--one in connection with his body, the other with his career. This tale, though short, is very harrowing, and as it is intimately connected with Crusoe's subsequent history we will relate it here. But before doing so we must beg our reader to accompany us beyond the civilized portions of the United States of America--beyond the frontier settlements of the \"far west,\" into those wild prairies which are watered by the great Missouri River--the Father of Waters--and his numerous tributaries.  Here dwell the Pawnees, the Sioux, the Delawarers, the Crows, the Blackfeet, and many other tribes of Red Indians, who are gradually retreating step by step towards the Rocky Mountains as the advancing white man cuts down their trees and ploughs up their prairies. Here, too, dwell the wild horse and the wild ass, the deer, the buffalo, and the badger; all, men and brutes alike, wild as the power of untamed and ungovernable passion can make them, and free as the wind that sweeps over their mighty plains.  There is a romantic and exquisitely beautiful spot on the banks of one of the tributaries above referred to--long stretch of mingled woodland and meadow, with a magnificent lake lying like a gem in its green bosom--which goes by the name of the Mustang Valley. This remote vale, even at the present day, is but thinly peopled by white men, and is still a frontier settlement round which the wolf and the bear prowl curiously, and from which the startled deer bounds terrified away. At the period of which we write the valley had just been taken possession of by several families of squatters, who, tired of the turmoil and the squabbles of the _then_ frontier settlements, had pushed boldly into the far west to seek a new home for themselves, where they could have \"elbow room,\" regardless alike of the dangers they might encounter in unknown lands and of the Redskins who dwelt there.  The squatters were well armed with axes, rifles, and ammunition. Most of the women were used to dangers and alarms, and placed implicit reliance in the power of their fathers, husbands, and brothers to protect them; and well they might, for a bolder set of stalwart men than these backwoodsmen never trod the wilderness. Each had been trained to the use of the rifle and the axe from infancy, and many of them had spent so much of their lives in the woods that they were more than a match for the Indian in his own peculiar pursuits of hunting and war. When the squatters first issued from the woods bordering the valley, an immense herd of wild horses or mustangs were browsing on the plain. These no sooner beheld the cavalcade of white men than, uttering a wild neigh, they tossed their flowing manes in the breeze and dashed away like a whirlwind. This incident procured the valley its name.  The new-comers gave one satisfied glance at their future home, and then set to work to erect log huts forthwith. Soon the axe was heard ringing through the forests, and tree after tree fell to the ground, while the occasional sharp ring of a rifle told that the hunters were catering successfully for the camp. In course of time the Mustang Valley began to assume the aspect of a thriving settlement, with cottages and waving fields clustered together in the midst of it.  Of course the savages soon found it out and paid it occasional visits. These dark-skinned tenants of the woods brought furs of wild animals with them, which they exchanged with the white men for knives, and beads, and baubles and trinkets of brass and tin. But they hated the \"Pale-faces\" with bitter hatred, because their encroachments had at this time materially curtailed the extent of their hunting-grounds, and nothing but the numbers and known courage of the squatters prevented these savages from butchering and scalping them all.  The leader of this band of pioneers was a Major Hope, a gentleman whose love for nature in its wildest aspects determined him to exchange barrack life for a life in the woods. The major was a first-rate shot, a bold, fearless man, and an enthusiastic naturalist. He was past the prime of life, and being a bachelor, was unencumbered with a family. His first act on reaching the site of the new settlement was to commence the erection of a block-house, to which the people might retire in case of a general attack by the Indians.  In this block-house Major Hope took up his abode as the guardian of the settlement. And here the dog Crusoe was born; here he sprawled in the early morn of life; here he leaped, and yelped, and wagged his shaggy tail in the excessive glee of puppyhood; and from the wooden portals of this block-house he bounded forth to the chase in all the fire, and strength, and majesty of full-grown doghood.  Crusoe's father and mother were magnificent Newfoundlanders. There was no doubt as to their being of the genuine breed, for Major Hope had received them as a parting gift from a brother officer, who had brought them both from Newfoundland itself. The father's name was Crusoe, the mother's name was Fan. Why the father had been so "]]]
