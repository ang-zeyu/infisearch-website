Nobody'll take any stock in it.\"  Frank was angry. It was something unusual for his word to be doubted, and he felt like expressing his feelings decidedly.  He was saved the trouble. The grimy stoker who had witnessed the struggle and the fall appeared in the door of the engine-room. He saw Frank and cried:  \"Hello, you! So you're all right? Wonder you wasn't killed. You came down with a rush, young feller, but you went back just as quick.\"  Frank understood instantly.  \"Here is a man who saw it!\" he cried. \"He will tell you that I am not lying.\"  The engineer turned to the stoker.  \"How did he happen to fall?\" he asked.  \"He didn't fall,\" declared the begrimed coal heaver.  \"No? What then--\"  \"'Nother chap jumped on his back and flung him down. It's wonderful he wasn't killed.\"  Frank was triumphant. He regarded the engineer and his assistant with a grim smile on his face.  \"This is incredible!\" exclaimed the engineer. \"Who could have done such a thing?\"  \"Somebody who came from this room!\" rang out Merry's clear voice.  \"This shall be investigated!\" declared the engineer. \"Look around! See if you can find the man who attacked you. The only ones here are myself, Mr. Gregory, and the wipers.\"  \"I want a look at those wipers,\" said Frank.  \"You shall have it. Mr. Gregory and I were talking together over here all the time you were gone.\"  \"Oh, I do not suspect you,\" said Merry; \"but I want a good look at those wipers.\"  \"Did you see the man who threw you into the stoke-hole?\"  \"No, but--\"  \"Then how will you know who it was if you see him?\"  \"Whoever did so had a reason for the act--a motive. He must have known me before. I may know him.\"  \"Come,\" invited the engineer.  He called one of the wipers down from amid the sliding shafts and moving machinery. The man came unhesitatingly.  Frank took a square look at this man, who did not seek to avoid inspection.  \"Never saw him before,\" confessed Merry.  The wiper was dismissed.  \"Hackett,\" called the engineer.  The other wiper did not seem to hear. He pretended to be very busy, and kept at work.  \"Hackett!\"  He could not fail to hear that. He kept his face turned away, but answered:  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Come here. I want you.\"  The wiper hesitated. Then he turned and slowly approached. His face was besmeared till scarcely a bit of natural color showed, and his hat was pulled low over his eyes. He shambled forward awkwardly, and stood in an awkward position, with his eyes cast down.  Frank looked at him closely and started. Then, in a perfectly calm manner, but with a trace of triumph in his voice, he declared:  \"This is the fellow who did the job!\"     CHAPTER IX.  IN IRONS.   \"What?\" cried the engineer, in astonishment.  \"How do you know?\" asked the engineer's assistant, incredulously.  \"That's it--how do you know?\" demanded the engineer. \"You said you did not see the person who attacked you.\"  \"I did not.\"  \"Yet you say this is the man.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"I know him.\"  \"You do?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You have seen him before?\"  \"I should say so, on several occasions. He is one of my bitterest enemies. This is not the first time he has tried to kill or injure me. He has made the attempt many times before. He is the only person here who would do such a thing.\"  \"If this is true,\" said the engineer, grimly, \"he shall pay dearly for his work!\"  The assistant nodded.  \"What have you to say, Hackett?\" demanded the engineer.  \"I say it's a lie!\" growled the fellow. \"I never saw this chap before he came into the engine-room. He doesn't know me, and I don't know him.\"  \"You hear what Hackett has to say,\" said the engineer, turning to Frank.  \"I hear what this fellow has to say, but his name is not Hackett.\"  \"Is not?\"  \"No, no more than mine is Hackett.\"  \"Then what is his name?\"  \"His name is Harris!\" asserted Merry, \"and he is a gambler and a crook. I'll guarantee that he has not been long on the 'Eagle.'\"  \"No; we took him on in New York scarcely two hours before we sailed. We needed a man, and he applied for any kind of a job. Found he had worked round machinery, and we took him as wiper and general assistant.\"  \"It was not so many weeks ago that he attacked me at New Haven,\" said Frank. \"He failed to do me harm. When he found I was going abroad he declared he would go along on the same steamer. At the time he must have thought I was going by one of the regular liners; but it is plain he followed me up pretty close and found I was going over this way. As there is no second-class passage on this boat, he decided he could not travel in the same class with me without being discovered, and he resolved to go as one of the crew, if he could get on that way. That's how he happens to be here.\"  \"If what you say is true, it will go pretty hard with Mr. Harris. We'll have him ironed and--\"  A cry of rage broke from the lips of the accused.  \"There is no proof!\" he snarled. \"No one can swear I attacked this fellow and threw him into the stoke-hole!\"  \"Oh, yes!\" said the stoker who had come up from below. \"I saw the whole business. By the light from the furnaces, I plainly saw the man who did it, and you are the man!\"  \"That settles it!\" declared the engineer. \"You'll make the rest of the voyage in irons, Mr. Harris!\"  \"Then I'll give you something to iron me for!\" shouted the furious young villain.  He leaped on Frank Merriwell with the fierceness of a wounded tiger.  Frank was not expecting the assault, and, for the moment, he was taken off his guard.  They were close to the moving machinery. Within four feet of them a huge plunging rod was playing up and down, moved by a steel bar that weighed many tons. Harris attempted to fling Frank beneath this bar, where he would be struck and crushed.  The villain nearly succeeded, so swift and savage was his attack.  Frank realized that the purpose of the wretch was to fling him into the machinery, and he braced himself to resist as quickly as possible.  Shouts of consternation broke from the engineer and his assistant. They sprang forward to seize Harris and help Frank.  But, before they could interfere, Frank broke the hold of his enemy, forced him back and struck him a terrible blow between the eyes felling him instantly.  Merriwell stood over Harris, his hands clenched his eyes gleaming.  \"Get up!\" he cried. \"Get up you dog! I can't strike you when you are down, and I'd give a hundred dollars to hit you just once more!\"  But Harris did not get up. He realized that his second attempt had failed, and he stood in awe of Frank's terrible fists. He looked up at those gleaming eyes, and turned away quickly, feeling a sudden great fear.  Did Frank Merriwell bear a charmed life?  Surely it seemed that way to Harris just then. For the first time, perhaps, the young rascal began to believe that it was not possible to harm the lad he hated with all the intensity of his nature.  The engineer and his assistants grabbed Harris and held him, the former swearing savagely. They dragged the fellow to his feet, but warned him to stand still.  Harris did so. For the moment, at least, he was completely cowed.  A man was sent for the captain, with instructions to tell him just what occurred. Of course the captain of the steamer was the only person who could order one of the men placed in irons.  The captain came in in a little while, and he listened in great amazement to the story of what had taken place. His face was hard and grim. He asked Frank a few questions, and then he ordered that Harris be ironed and confined in the hold.  \"Mr. Merriwell,\" said the captain, \"I am very sorry that this happened on my ship.\"  \"It's all right, captain,\" said Frank. \"You are in no way to blame. The fellow shipped with the intention of doing just what he did, if he found an opportunity.\"  \"It will go hard-with him,\" declared the master. \"He'll not get out of this without suffering the penalty.\"  Harris was sullen and silent. Frank spoke to him before he was led away.  \"Harris,\" he said, \"you have brought destruction on yourself. I can't say that I arm sorry for you, for, by your persistent attacks on me, you have destroyed any sympathy I might have felt. You have ruined your own life.\"  \"No!\" snarled Sport. \"You are the one! You ruined me! If I go to prison for this, I'll get free again sometime, and I'll not forget you, Frank Merriwell! All the years I am behind the bars will but add to the debt I owe you. When I come forth to freedom, I'll find you if you are alive, and I'll have your life!\"  Then he was marched away between two stout men, his irons clanking and rattling.     CHAPTER X.  THE GAME IN THE NEXT ROOM.   When Merry appeared in his stateroom he was greeted with a storm of questions.  \"Well, what does this mean?\"  \"Trying to dodge us?\"  \"Running away?\"  \"Muts the whatter with you--I mean what's the matter?\"  \"Where have you been?\"  \"Stand and give an account of yourself!\"  Then he told them a little story that astounded them beyond measure. He explained how he had taken a fancy to look the steamer over and had fallen in with the engineer. Then he related how he had visited the engine room and been thrown into the stoke-hole.  But when he told the name of his assailant the climax was capped.  \"Harris?\" gasped Rattleton, incredulously.  \"Harris?\" palpitated Diamond, astounded.  \"Harris?\" roared Browning, aroused from his lazy languidness.  \"On this steamer?\" they shouted in unison.  \"On this steamer,\" nodded Frank, really enjoying the sensation he had created.  \"He--he attacked you?\" gurgled Rattleton, seeming to forget his recent sickness.  \"He did.\"  \"And you escaped after being thrown into the stoke-hole?\" fluttered Diamond.  \"I am here.\"  \"And you didn't kill the cur on sight?\" roared Browning.  \"He is in the hold in irons.\"  \"Serves him right!\" was the verdict of Frank's three friends.  \"Well, this is what I call a real sensation!\" said the Virginian. \"You certainly found something, Frank!\"  \"Well, that fellow has reached the end of his rope at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10904"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Nobility; Or, The Tragedy of the Ocean Tramp (#7)"],["body",",\" said Harry, with intense satisfaction, once more stretching himself in his bunk.  \"That's pretty sure,\" nodded Jack. \"Attempted murder on the high seas is a pretty serious thing.\"  \"He'll get pushed for it all right this time,\" grunted Browning, beginning to recover from his astonishment.  Then they talked the affair over, and Frank gave them his theory of Sport's presence on the steamer, which seemed plausible.  \"This is something rather more interesting than the superstitious man or the Frenchman,\" said Diamond.  \"The superstitious man was interesting at first,\" observed Merry; \"but I've a fancy that he might prove a bore.\"  Then Bruce grunted:       \"Say, does Fact and Reason err,      And, if they both err, which the more?      The man of the smallest calibre      Is sure to be the greatest bore.\"  While they were talking, the sound of voices came from the stateroom occupied by the Frenchman. Soon it became evident that quite a little party had gathered in that room.  The boys paid no attention to the party till it came time to turn in for the night. Then they became aware that something was taking place in the adjoining room, and it was not long before they made out that it was a game of poker.  As they became quiet, they could hear the murmur of voices, and, occasionally, some person would speak distinctly, \"seeing,\" \"raising\" or \"calling.\"  Diamond began to get nervous.  \"Say,\" he observed, \"that makes me think of old times. Many a night I've spent at that.\"  \"What's the matter with you?\" said Frank. \"Do you want to go in there and take a hand?\"  \"Well,\" Jack confessed, \"I do feel an itching.\"  \"I feel like getting some sleep,\" grunted Bruce, \"and they are keeping me awake.\"  \"Why are they playing in a stateroom, anyhow?\" exclaimed Frank. \"It's no place for a game of cards at night.\"  \"That's so,\" agreed Rattleton, dreamily. \"But you are keeping me awake by your chatter a good deal more than they are. Shut up, the whole lot of you!\"  There was silence for a time, and then, with a savage exclamation, Diamond sprang out of his berth and thumped on the partition, crying:  \"Come, gentlemen, it's time to go to bed! You are keeping us awake.\"  There was no response.  Jack went back to bed, but the murmuring continued in the next stateroom, and the rattle of chips could be heard occasionally.  \"What are we going to do about it, Merriwell?\" asked Jack, savagely.  \"We can complain.\"  But making a complaint was repellent to a college youth, who was inclined to regard as a cheap fellow anybody who would do such a thing, and Diamond did not agree to that.  \"Well,\" said Frank, \"I suppose I can go in there and clean them all out.\"  \"How?\"  \"At their own game,\" laughed Merry, muffledly.  \"If anybody in this crowd tackles them that way I'll be the one,\" asserted the Virginian.  \"Then nobody here will tackle them that way,\" said Frank, remembering how he had once saved Diamond from sharpers in New Haven.  Frank was a person who believed that knowledge of almost any sort was likely to prove of value to a man at some stage of his career, and he had made a practice of learning everything possible. He had studied up on the tricks of gamblers, so that he knew all about their methods of robbing their victims. Being a first-class amateur magician, his knowledge of card tricks had become of value to him in more than one instance. He felt that he would be able to hold his own against pretty clever card-sharps, but he did not care or propose to have any dealings with such men, unless forced to do so.  The boys kept still for a while. Their light was extinguished, but, up near the ceiling, a shaft of light came through the partition from the other room.  Diamond saw it. He jumped up and dragged a trunk into position by that partition. Mounted on the trunk, he applied his eye to the orifice and discovered that he could see into the Frenchman's room very nicely.  \"What can you see?\" grunted Browning.  \"I can see everyone in there,\" answered Jack.  \"Name them.\"  \"The Frenchman, the Englishman, the superstitious man, and our fresh friend, Bloodgood.\"  \"Same old crowd,\" murmured Frank.  \"Yes, and a hot old game!\" came from the youth on the trunk. \"My! my! but they are whooping her up! They've got plenty to drink, and they are playing for big dust.\"  \"Tell them to saw up till to-morrow,\" mumbled Bruce.  Jack did not do so, however. He remained on the trunk, watching the game, seeming greatly interested.  A big game of poker interested him any time. It was through the influence of Frank that he had been led to renounce the game, but the thirst for its excitements and delights remained with him, for he had come from a family of card-players and sportsmen.  \"Come, come!\" laughed Frank, after a while; \"I can hear your teeth chattering, old man. Get off that trunk and turn in.\"  \"Wait!\" fluttered Jack--\"wait till I see this hand played out.\"  In less than half a minute he cried:  \"It's a skin game! I knew it was!\"  \"What's the lay?\" asked Merry.  \"That infernal Frenchman is a card-sharp!\"  \"I suspected as much.\"  \"His pal is the Englishman. They are standing in together.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Sure thing. They are bleeding Bloodgood and Slush. Bloodgood thinks he's pretty sharp, and I have not much sympathy for him; but I am sorry for poor little Slush. He should have paid attention to some of his signs and omens. He knew something disastrous would happen during this voyage, and I rather think it will happen to him.\"  Then Diamond thumped the wall again, crying:  \"Stop that business in there! Mr. Slush, you are playing cards with crooks--you are being robbed! Get out of that game as soon as you can!\"  There was a sudden silence in the adjoining room, and then M. Rouen Montfort was heard to utter an exclamation in French, following which he cried:  \"I see you to-morrow, saire! I make you swallow ze lie!\"  \"You may see me any time you like!\" Diamond flung back.     CHAPTER XI.  THE HORRORS OF THE HOLD.   To the surprise of the four youths, M. Montfort utterly ignored them on the following day, instead of seeking \"trouble,\" as had been anticipated.  \"Well,\" said Jack, in disgust, \"he has less courage than I thought. He is just a common boasting Frenchman.\"  \"He is not a common Frenchman.\" declared Frank. \"I believe he is a rascal of more than common calibre.\"  \"But he lacks nerve, and I have nothing but contempt for him,\" said the Virginian. \"I didn't know but he would challenge me to a duel.\"  \"What if he had?\"  \"What if he had?\" hissed the hot-blooded Southern youth. \"I'd fought him at the drop of the hat!\"  \"That's all right, but you know most Frenchmen fight well in a duel.\"  \"I don't know anything of the kind. They are expert fencers, but I notice it is mighty seldom one of them is killed in a duel. They sometimes draw a drop of blood, and then they consider that 'honor is satisfied,' and that ends it.\"  It was midway in the forenoon that Frank met Mr. Slush on deck. The little man was looking more doleful and dejected than ever, if possible.  \"The--ah--the moon showed rather yellow last night,\" he said. \"That is a--a sure sign of disaster.\"  \"Well,\" said Merry, with a smile, \"I think the disaster will befall you, sir, if you do not steer clear of the crowd you were in last night.\"  Mr. Slush looked surprised.  \"Might I--ah--inquire your meaning?\" he faltered.  \"I mean that you are playing poker with card-sharps, and they mean to rob you,\" answered Frank, plainly.  \"I--I wonder how you--er--know so much,\" said the little man, with something like faint sarcasm, as Frank fancied.  \"It makes little difference how I know it, but I am telling you the truth. I am warning you for your good, sir.\"  \"Er--ahem! Thank you--very much.\"  Mr. Slush walked away.  \"Well, I'm hanged if he doesn't take it coolly enough!\" muttered Frank, perplexed.  Frank felt an interest to know how Sport Harris was getting along. He walked forward and found the captain near the steps that led to the bridge.  In reply to Merry's inquiry, the captain said:  \"Oh, don't worry about him. There are rats down there in the hold, but I guess he'll be able to fight them off. He'll have bread and water the rest of the voyage.\"  After that Merry could not help thinking of Harris all alone in the darkness of the hold, with swarms of rats around him, eating dry bread, washed down with water.  Frank felt that the youthful villain did not deserve any sympathy, but, despite himself, he could not help feeling a pang of pity for him.  When he expressed himself thus to his friends, however, they scoffed at him.  \"Serves the dog right!\" flashed Diamond. \"He is getting just what he deserves, and I'm glad of it!\"  \"He will get what he deserves when we reach the other side,\" grunted Browning.  \"No,\" said Merry; \"he is an American, and he'll have to be taken back to the United States for punishment.\"  \"Well, he'll get it all right.\"  \"Well, I don't care to think that he may be driven mad shut up in the dark hold with the rats.\"  This feeling grew on Frank. At last he went to the captain and asked liberty to see Harris.  The request was granted, and, accompanied by two men, Frank descended into the hold.  Down there, amid barrels and casks, they came upon Harris. Frank heard the irons rattle, and then a gaunt-looking, wild-eyed creature rose up before them, shown by the yellow light of the lanterns.  Frank Merriwell had steady nerves, but, despite himself, he started.  The appearance of the fellow had changed in a most remarkable manner. Harris looked as if he was overcome with terror.  \"There he is,\" said one of the men, holding up his lantern so the light fell more plainly on the wretched prisoner.  \"Have you come to take me out of here?\" cried Harris, in a tone of voice that gave Frank a chill. \"For God's sake, take me out of this place! I'll go mad if I stay here much longer! It is full of rats! I could not sleep last night--I dare not close my eyes for a minute! Please--please take me out of here!\""]]]
