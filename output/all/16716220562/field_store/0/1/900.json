He says Merry is altogether too 'soon' for a fresh, and he must be taken down. I tell you I've got it straight. He'll put up some kind of a game to enable Diamond to get square.\"  \"Well, this is rather interesting,\" confessed Frank, showing that he was aroused. \"I'll have to look out for Mr. Browning.\"  \"He's a hard fellow to go against,\" solemnly said Dismal Jones. \"He's a Le Boule man, and they say he may take his choice of the other big societies next year.\"  \"Oh, what's that amount to?\"  \"It amounts to something here; but then he's a fighter, and he is authority on fighters and fighting.\"  \"He is too fat to fight.\"  \"They say he can train down in a week. He was the greatest freshman half-back ever known at Yale.\"  \"Half-back--Browning a half-back! Oh, say, that fellow couldn't play football!\"  \"Not a great deal now, perhaps, but he could last year. He'd be on the regular team now, but his father swore to take him out of college if he didn't stop it. You see, Browning is not entirely to blame for his laziness. He inherits it from his father, and the old man will not allow him to lead in athletics, so whatever he does must be done secretly.\"  Frank was interested. He wondered how a fellow like Bruce Browning could come to be know as \"king of the sophomores,\" unless such a title was applied to him in derision. Now he began to understand that Browning was something more than the lazy mischief planner that he had seemed.  Frank's interest in Browning grew.  \"And you say he is backing Diamond?\"  \"That's the way it looks from the road.\"  \"Well, Mr. Bruce Browning may need some attention. It is he who puts the sophs up to their jobs on us. We ought to put up a big one on him.\"  \"That's right! that's right!\"  \"Merry,\" said Jones, \"set the complicated machinery of your fertile brain to work and see what it will bring forth.\"  \"That's right! that's right!\"  \"I'll have to take time to think it over.\"  \"We have a few soph scalps,\" grinned Rattleton, pointing to a number of caps with which the walls were decorated, all of which had been snatched from the heads of sophomores. \"Have the rest of you fellows done as well?\"  \"I have lost two,\" confessed Dan Dorman. \"They seem to single me out as easy fruit.\"  \"And haven't you made an attempt to get one in return?\" asked Bandy Robinson.  \"I haven't had a good chance.\"  \"If you wait for a good chance you'll never get a scalp. You must snatch 'em whenever you can.\"  \"By Jove!\" laughed Frank, \"this talk about scalps has given me an idea.\"  \"Let's have it!\" exclaimed several of the boys in unison.  \"Not now,\" he said. \"Wait till I have perfected it.\"  Roll Ditson strolled in, smoking a cigarette, and said:  \"Hello, Merry! Hello, fellows! What's up? Council of war?\"  \"Just that,\" said Dan Dorman. \"Merry is perfecting a scheme to put a horse on Browning.\"  \"Eh? Browning? Great Scott! Is that so? He's a bad man to monkey with. Better let him alone, Merry.\"  Ditson had a patronizing way that was offensive to Frank, who had given him numberless digs; but he was too thick to tumble or he deliberately refused to take Merriwell's words as they were intended.  \"You'll have to kick him before he knows he's not wanted,\" Rattleton had said.  \"Thank you for your advice,\" said Frank, with mild sarcasm--\"thank you exceedingly! Perhaps you are right.\"  \"Oh, I know I am. I don't want to get the king after me, and I don't believe you care to have him on your trail. He is the most influential soph in college. Why, his name is on a table down at Morey's.\"  Ditson looked around as if his last statement had settled the question of Browning's vast superiority over all sophomores.  Morey's was the favorite resort of the students, and no freshman could enter there. It was an old frame house, with low-posted rooms, and there one could drink everything except beer. No beer could be had at Morey's.  Morey's was headquarters for the Society of the Cup. This cup had six handles and was kept in a locked closet. On the cup was engraved in large letters the word \"Velvet,\" which is a well-known Yale drink, composed of champagne and Dublin stout, a drink that is mild and soft, but has a terrific \"kick.\"  Besides the word \"Velvet,\" a number of students' names were engraved on the cup, and no one whose name was not there could ask the proprietor to show the cup.  The marked tables were two round tables on which names of the frequenters of the place had been cut in the hard wood. One table had been filled with six hundred and seventy-five names and was suspended against the wall, where it would revolve, and the other tables were fast filling up.  Merriwell laughed at Ditson's statement.  \"I don't see as it is such a wonderful thing for a soph to get his name on one of those tables,\" he said. \"If you had said that Browning's name was on the cup, it would have seemed a matter of some consequence.\"  \"It may be, for all I know. Sophs are not in the habit of telling us everything. Steer clear of Browning, Merry, old man.\"  \"Thanks again! You have made me so nervous that I think I will take your advice.\"  \"That's right, my boy--that's right,\" nodded Ditson, swelling with importance. \"Always listen to your uncle, my lad, and you will never go wrong.\"  The other lads seemed rather disappointed, but Merriwell said nothing more of his scheme to get a \"horse\" on Browning--that is, he said nothing more that night.     CHAPTER VII.  A SURPRISE.   It was singular how quickly Browning learned that Merriwell had contemplated working a job on him. It seemed an absolute certainty that some one of the party in Merriwell's room had gone forth and \"blowed.\" Who had done so was a question.  As was the most natural thing, considering his dislike for the fellow, Frank felt that Roll Ditson was the telltale. Of this he had no proof, however, and he was too just to openly condemn a man without proof.  It was certain that Browning had learned all about it, for he sent word to Merriwell to go slow. At the same time, in all public places he avowed the utmost contempt and disregard for the freshman who had done up Diamond.  \"The boy is altogether too new,\" Browning sneered. \"What he needs is polishing off, and he is bound to get it.\"  Now, Frank had won admiration from the sophomores, and there were one or two who did not like Browning and would have given not a little to have seen him beaten at anything.  This being the case, it is not surprising that Merriwell received an anonymous note warning him to keep in his room on a certain evening and look out for squalls.  Frank knew Browning would not come alone, and he determined to be prepared. With this object in view, he gathered ten stout freshmen and had them come to his room early on the evening mentioned.  The curtains were drawn closely, and the arrivals were astonished to see a lot of Indian toggery piled up on tables and chairs, imitation buckskin suits, feathered headdresses, bows, arrows, tomahawks, and so forth. On Merriwell's table was a full supply of Indian red grease paint.  \"Oh, say,\" gasped Ned Stover, his eyes bulging, \"what's this--a powwow outfit?\"  \"This is the result of the idea you fellows gave me when you spoke of capturing scalps the other evening,\" laughed Frank. \"Select your suits, gentlemen, and proceed to make up.\"  \"Make up? What for?\"  \"Just you make up, and I will tell you what for afterward.\"  Merriwell's influence was sufficient to induce them to obey, and he aided them in the work.  \"Blate grazes--I mean great blazes!\" chuckled Rattleton, as he rubbed the war paint on his face. \"Won't we make a bloodthirsty gang of roble ned men--er, noble red men!\"  The boys aided each other, and Frank assisted them all.  \"Aren't you going to make up, Merry?\" asked Bandy Robinson.  \"Not now. I am to be the decoy.\"  \"The decoy? What's in the wind, anyway?\"  \"Well, I have it pretty straight that some sophs, led by Browning, are coming to take me out for an airing to-night.\"  \"Eh? Take you out?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And he means to take them in,\" laughed Rattleton, arranging a war bonnet on his head.  \"That's just it,\" nodded Frank. \"If they come here, we'll be ready for them. If they do not come, we'll call on Mr. Browning.\"  \"I'm afraid this is rather a serious matter,\" said Dismal Jones.  \"Oh, don't begin to croak!\" cried Rattleton. \"Merriwell knows his business. Hurry up with your makeup. Can't tell how early the sophs will call.\"  So the boys hastened to complete their disguise, and a decidedly savage-looking band they were when all was completed. Frank surveyed them with satisfaction.  \"Ah! my bold warriors!\" he cried. \"I am proud of you. To-night--to-night we deal the enemy a terrible and deadly blow.\"  \"We're ready to hear what the layout is,\" eagerly said Ned Stover.  \"Well, you are to retire to Robinson's room, which is exactly opposite this, and wait. I have two fellows outside to let me know when the enemy approaches and to take a hand in the game at the right time. When I whistle you are to make your way into this room if you have to break down the door. That's all.\"  The boys retired to Robinson's room, where they smoked and waited with great impatience.  Frank sat down and coolly went at his studies.  Nearly an hour passed, and then there was a sound of wheels outside. The sound stopped before the door.  A few moments later some one ascended the stairs and there came a knock on the door.  \"Come in,\" called Frank.  The door opened, and Roll Ditson sauntered in, smoking the inevitable cigarette.  \"Hello, Merry!\" he cried, looking around. \"All alone?\"  \"All alone, Ditson,\" yawned Frank. \"It's beastly stupid but I am having a hard pull at my studies.\"  \"Better come out with me and get a little air. It's stuffy here.\"  \"Oh, you'll have to excuse me to-night. I don't believe I'll go out.\"  Ditson urged, but Frank persisted in refusing. Roll stopped near a table and picked up a stick of grease paint.  \"Hello! what's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],["title","Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#7)"],["body","this?\" he exclaimed. \"Aren't going into amateur theatricals, are you, Merry?\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" smiled Frank. \"I may do a turn.\"  Ditson looked at Merriwell curiously, as if in doubt concerning his sincerity, but Frank simply continued to smile.  \"Indian red,\" said Roll, reading the lettering on the stick. \"You don't mean to become a big chief, do you?\"  \"Perhaps so.\"  \"Well, you are pretty sure to become a big chief here at Yale, old man,\" said Ditson, with apparent earnestness. \"You will be a leader here some day.\"  \"Think so?\"  \"Oh, I am dead sure of it.\"  \"Thank you.\"  Merriwell yawned again.  \"Oh, come on!\" Ditson urged. \"You're stupid from digging over those books. Come out and have a walk.\"  \"No.\"  \"You won't?\"  \"You'll have to excuse me to-night, Ditson.\"  \"All right. But say, I came near forgetting something. As I came in, there was a fellow down to the door who said he wanted to see you.\"  \"A fellow? Who was it?\"  \"Don't know. Some of the students, I think.\"  \"Oh, if that is the case, go down and bring him up, Ditson. You can open the door and let him in without disturbing Mrs. Harrington.\"  \"All right,\" nodded Roll. \"Sorry you won't come out, old fel. You'll get grouchy. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night.\"  Ditson went out, and Frank heard him descending the stairs.  \"There'll be music in the air,\" muttered Merriwell as he again lay back in his chair, elevating his feet to the top of the table. \"But the surprisers are liable to be surprised.\"  He heard the front door creak. Often he wondered why Mrs. Harrington did not grease the hinges.  Frank had good ears, and it was not long before he was sure he could hear rustlings and whisperings in the hall. Then one person seemed to ascend the stairs very slowly, but he made out that there were two or three others with that one, the others stepping as softly as possible.  Merriwell remained cool and apparently quite unaware that anything unusual was taking place.  The footsteps reached the head of the stairs and advanced to the door, on which there was a distinct knock.  \"Come in!\" Frank once more called.  The door was promptly flung open, and into the room strode a person who was wrapped in a big overcoat and wore a wide-brimmed hat slouched over his eyes. His face nearly to his eyes was covered with bushy whiskers.  \"Hello!\" exclaimed Frank, as if surprised. \"Who are you?\"  \"'Sh!\" hissed the stranger, with a warning gesture. \"Are we alone?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Where is your roommate?\"  \"Out.\"  The fellow whistled sharply, and the next minute four masked lads appeared at the door and leaped into the room. One of them slammed the door shut and the others sprang at Frank.  Merriwell flung a book at the first one, and it struck the fellow's mask, tearing it from his face.  The well-known countenance of Bruce Browning was exposed!  \"Good-evening, Browning!\" cheerfully called the lively freshman as he darted behind the table. \"I have been expecting a call from you.\"  \"Grab him!\" directed Browning. \"Get hold of him!\"  Frank was on the point of uttering a whistle, but it was not required, for the whistle that came from the lips of the disguised fellow had served as a signal to the painted braves.  There was a bang at the door, which flew open as if assaulted by a catapault, and into the room poured the disguised freshmen.  The Indians leaped upon the masked sophomores, and for a short time a very sharp struggle took place.  Bruce Browning did his best to escape from the room, but three of the savages laid hold of him, and he was finally subdued.  \"Out of the house with them as soon as possible,\" ordered Frank. \"Come on, two or three of you. We must nail the hack and the fellows outside.\"  Down to the door he led the way.  Mrs. Harrington came out into the hall, caught a glimpse of the painted faces, uttered a wild shriek of terror, and dodged back, slamming the door.  \"All ready?\" said Frank as he prepared to fling open the front door.  \"All ready!\" panted Harry Rattleton, close behind him.  \"Don't let anybody get away,\" warned Merriwell. \"I will look after the driver.\"  \"Go ahead.\"  Creak! open swung the door, and out into the night leaped a youth who seemed to be hotly pursued by four painted and bloodthirsty-appearing redskins.  The hack was standing exactly as Frank expected it would be, and he was on the box with the driver at two springs.  \"It's all right,\" he asserted. \"We've got the fellow up there, though he did kick up some. A part of our gang was rigged up like Indians, and they nipped him all right.\"  \"It's the divil's own set ye shtudints are!\" muttered the driver. \"Av ye hurry, Oi'll sthay to take him away; but Oi'll not remain here long, fer it's th' cops will be down on us roight away.\"  \"We'll get away ahead of the cops, don't fear that,\" declared Frank. \"They're bringing him downstairs now. We had to take two or three others with him; but well not bother with them long.\"  \"Arrah! th' poor freshman!\" said the driver. \"Oi'd not loike to be in his place this noight!\"  He was completely fooled, thinking all the time that Frank was one of the party he had brought there to capture the freshman.  As they rushed out Frank had seen a fellow standing near the open door of the hack, and that fellow had promptly taken to flight at sight of the Indians, two of whom pursued him hotly.  Frank hoped they would be able to overtake the fugitive, for if one of the party escaped he would report to the sophs, who were bound to make a big hustle to rescue their captured comrades.  The disguised freshmen came downstairs, bearing their captives, who were swiftly thrust into the hack, which was a big, roomy, old-fashioned affair.  As many of the freshmen as could do so piled inside and upon the hack, and then Frank gave the signal, the driver whipped up his horse and away they went.  \"East Rock,\" said Frank.  \"Eh?\" exclaimed the driver. \"Thot's not pwhere ye wur goin' in th' firrust place.\"  \"We have changed the programme. East Rock is where we are bound for now.\"  \"All roight, me b'y.\"  The triumphant freshmen felt like shouting and singing in jubilant mood. Indeed, Rattleton could not refrain from \"letting off steam,\" as he called it, and he gave one wild howl of triumph that made the streets echo:  \"'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight!\"  \"Break it off!\" sharply commanded Frank. \"Want to let the sophs know we're up to something?\"  \"I don't care.\"  \"They might raise a rescue party and follow us.\"  \"But they wouldn't frop any chost--I mean chop any frost with us.\"  \"Pwhat's thot?\" came suspiciously from the driver. \"An' is it not softmores ye are yersilves?\"  \"Of course we are,\" returned Harry, instantly.  \"Thin pwhat fer do ye yell fer 'Umpty-eight?\"  \"Oh, it's a way we have. Don't mind it, but keep on driving if you want to retain your scalp, paleface. We are mighty bad Injuns!\"  The driver knew how to pick out the darkest and most deserted streets. By the time the outskirts of the city were reached the freshmen were bubbling over.  Frank Merriwell improvised a stanza of a song, and in a few moments the entire band caught the words and the tune. As the hack rolled along toward East Rock the freshmen sang:    \"We belong to good old 'Umpty-eight,   For she's a corker, sure as fate, sure as fate.     We have met the sophomores,     And they're feeling awful sore;   So hurrah for good old 'Umpty-eight! 'Umpty-eight!\"  \"Begobs! ye're th' quarest gang av softmores Oi iver saw!\" cried the driver. \"An' it's not wan av yez Oi remimber takin' up to th' freshman's boording house.\"  \"We have changed,\" explained Ned Stover.  \"And it's the first change I have seen for a week,\" declared Harry Rattleton. \"I'm waiting to hear from the governor.\"  \"Howld on,\" said the driver. \"Oi want to see the mon thot hired me.\"  He threatened to pull up, but Frank caught the whip and cracked it over the horses.  \"What do you want?\" asked Merriwell.  \"Oi want me pay.\"  Now, Frank knew well enough that the driver had received his pay in advance, but he was beginning to suspect that the party that hired him had come to grief, and so he was for exacting an extra payment from the victors.  \"Look here, driver,\" said Frank, sternly, \"I want your number.\"  \"Pwhat fer?\"  \"In case it may appear later on that you have received money at two separate and distinct times for doing the same piece of work.\"  \"Get oop!\" yelled the driver. \"It's ownly foolin' Oi wur.\"  So the hack rolled on its way, with the happy freshmen smoking and singing, while the captive sophs ground their teeth and railed at the bitter luck.  Inside the hack Dismal Jones, most hideously bedaubed, was smoking a cigarette and brandishing a wooden tomahawk at the same time, while he sat astride of Bruce Browning, who was on the floor.  \"This is a sad and solemn occasion, paleface,\" croaked Dismal. \"You have driven the noble red man from his ancestral halls, which were the dim aisles of the mighty forests; you have pushed him across the plains, and you have tried to crowd him off the earth into the Pacific Ocean. Ugh! You have pursued him with deadly firearms and still more deadly fire water. You have been relentless in your hatred and your greed. You have even been so unreasonable that whenever a poor red man has secured a few paleface scalps as trophies to hang in his wigwam you have taken your trusty rifles and gone forth with great fury and shot the poor Indian full of hard bullets. You have done heap many things that you would not have done if you had not done so. But now, poor, shivering dog of a paleface, the injured red man has arisen at last in his might. If we are to perish, we are to perish; but before we perish, we will enjoy the gentle pleasure of roasting a few white men at the stake. Ugh! We have held a council of war, we have excavated the hatchet, we have smashed the pipe of peace to flinders, or something of the sort, and have struck out upon the war trail.\"  \"You act as if you had struck out,\" growled one of the captives.  \"That's because he has had "]]]
