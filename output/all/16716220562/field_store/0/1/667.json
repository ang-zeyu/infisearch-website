Thank heaven that I had the sense to turn away from him and to       marry a better, if poorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes,       when I heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in       an aviary, and I was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that I       would have nothing more to do with him.’ She rummaged in a       bureau, and presently she produced a photograph of a woman,       shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife. ‘That is my own       photograph,’ she said. ‘He sent it to me in that state, with his       curse, upon my wedding morning.’        “‘Well,’ said I, ‘at least he has forgiven you now, since he has       left all his property to your son.’        “‘Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre, dead or       alive!’ she cried, with a proper spirit. ‘There is a God in       heaven, Mr. Holmes, and that same God who has punished that       wicked man will show, in His own good time, that my son’s hands       are guiltless of his blood.’        “Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which       would help our hypothesis, and several points which would make       against it. I gave it up at last and off I went to Norwood.        “This place, Deep Dene House, is a big modern villa of staring       brick, standing back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped       lawn in front of it. To the right and some distance back from the       road was the timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire.       Here’s a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook. This window on the       left is the one which opens into Oldacre’s room. You can look       into it from the road, you see. That is about the only bit of       consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade was not there, but his       head constable did the honours. They had just found a great       treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the ashes       of the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains       they had secured several discoloured metal discs. I examined them       with care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons.       I even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of       ‘Hyams,’ who was Oldacres tailor. I then worked the lawn very       carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has made       everything as hard as iron. Nothing was to be seen save that some       body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which       is in a line with the wood-pile. All that, of course, fits in       with the official theory. I crawled about the lawn with an August       sun on my back, but I got up at the end of an hour no wiser than       before.        “Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom and examined       that also. The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and       discolourations, but undoubtedly fresh. The stick had been       removed, but there also the marks were slight. There is no doubt       about the stick belonging to our client. He admits it. Footmarks       of both men could be made out on the carpet, but none of any       third person, which again is a trick for the other side. They       were piling up their score all the time and we were at a       standstill.        “Only one little gleam of hope did I get—and yet it amounted to       nothing. I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had       been taken out and left on the table. The papers had been made up       into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the       police. They were not, so far as I could judge, of any great       value, nor did the bank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such       very affluent circumstances. But it seemed to me that all the       papers were not there. There were allusions to some       deeds—possibly the more valuable—which I could not find. This, of       course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade’s       argument against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew       that he would shortly inherit it?        “Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent,       I tried my luck with the housekeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her       name—a little, dark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong       eyes. She could tell us something if she would—I am convinced of       it. But she was as close as wax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane       in at half-past nine. She wished her hand had withered before she       had done so. She had gone to bed at half-past ten. Her room was       at the other end of the house, and she could hear nothing of what       had passed. Mr. McFarlane had left his hat, and to the best of       her belief his stick, in the hall. She had been awakened by the       alarm of fire. Her poor, dear master had certainly been murdered.       Had he any enemies? Well, every man had enemies, but Mr. Oldacre       kept himself very much to himself, and only met people in the way       of business. She had seen the buttons, and was sure that they       belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night. The       wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. It       burned like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot, nothing       could be seen but flames. She and all the firemen smelled the       burned flesh from inside it. She knew nothing of the papers, nor       of Mr. Oldacre’s private affairs.        “So, my dear Watson, there’s my report of a failure. And yet—and       yet—” he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction—“I       _know_ it’s all wrong. I feel it in my bones. There is something       that has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it. There was a       sort of sulky defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty       knowledge. However, there’s no good talking any more about it,       Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes our way I fear that       the Norwood Disappearance Case will not figure in that chronicle       of our successes which I foresee that a patient public will       sooner or later have to endure.”        “Surely,” said I, “the man’s appearance would go far with any       jury?”        “That is a dangerous argument my dear Watson. You remember that       terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in       ’87? Was there ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school young       man?”        “It is true.”        “Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory, this       man is lost. You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now       be presented against him, and all further investigation has       served to strengthen it. By the way, there is one curious little       point about those papers which may serve us as the starting-point       for an inquiry. On looking over the bank-book I found that the       low state of the balance was principally due to large checks       which have been made out during the last year to Mr. Cornelius. I       confess that I should be interested to know who this Mr.       Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large       transactions. Is it possible that he has had a hand in the       affair? Cornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip       to correspond with these large payments. Failing any other       indication, my researches must now take the direction of an       inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these       checks. But I fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end       ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly       be a triumph for Scotland Yard.”        I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night,       but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed,       his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The       carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with       the early editions of the morning papers. An open telegram lay       upon the table.        “What do you think of this, Watson?” he asked, tossing it across.        It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:        Important fresh evidence to hand. McFarlane’s guilt definitely       established. Advise you to abandon case.—LESTRADE.        “This sounds serious,” said I.        “It is Lestrade’s little cock-a-doodle of victory,” Holmes       answered, with a bitter smile. “And yet it may be premature to       abandon the case. After all, important fresh evidence is a       two-edged thing, and may possibly cut in a very different       direction to that which Lestrade imagines. Take your breakfast,       Watson, and we will go out together and see what we can do. I       feel as if I shall need your company and your moral support       today.”        My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his       peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit       himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron       strength until he has fainted from pure inanition. “At present I       cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion,” he would say       in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was not surprised,       therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind       him, and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid       sightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was       just such a suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates       Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner       grossly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10806"],["title","The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories (#0)"],["body","SWORD OF WELLERAN AND OTHER STORIES  By Lord Dunsany  Author of \"Time and the Gods,\" etc.    DEDICATED  with deep gratitude to those few, known to me or unknown, who have cared for either of my former books, \"The Gods of Pegana,\" \"Time and the Gods.\"     The Sword of Welleran  Where the great plain of Tarphet runs up, as the sea in estuaries, among the Cyresian mountains, there stood long since the city of Merimna well-nigh among the shadows of the crags.  I have never seen a city in the world so beautiful as Merimna seemed to me when first I dreamed of it.  It was a marvel of spires and figures of bronze, and marble fountains, and trophies of fabulous wars, and broad streets given over wholly to the Beautiful.  Right through the centre of the city there went an avenue fifty strides in width, and along each side of it stood likenesses in bronze of the Kings of all the countries that the people of Merimna had ever known.  At the end of that avenue was a colossal chariot with three bronze horses driven by the winged figure of Fame, and behind her in the chariot the huge form of Welleran, Merimna's ancient hero, standing with extended sword.  So urgent was the mien and attitude of Fame, and so swift the pose of the horses, that you had sworn that the chariot was instantly upon you, and that its dust already veiled the faces of the Kings.  And in the city was a mighty hall wherein were stored the trophies of Merimna's heroes.  Sculptured it was and domed, the glory of the art of masons a long while dead, and on the summit of the dome the image of Rollory sat gazing across the Cyresian mountains towards the wide lands beyond, the lands that knew his sword.  And beside Rollory, like an old nurse, the figure of Victory sat, hammering into a golden wreath of laurels for his head the crowns of fallen Kings.  Such was Merimna, a city of sculptured Victories and warriors of bronze.  Yet in the time of which I write the art of war had been forgotten in Merimna, and the people almost slept.  To and fro and up and down they would walk through the marble streets, gazing at memorials of the things achieved by their country's swords in the hands of those that long ago had loved Merimna well.  Almost they slept, and dreamed of Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.  Of the lands beyond the mountains that lay all round about them they knew nothing, save that they were the theatre of the terrible deeds of Welleran, that he had done with his sword.  Long since these lands had fallen back into the possession of the nations that had been scourged by Merimna's armies.  Nothing now remained to Merimna's men save their inviolate city and the glory of the remembrance of their ancient fame.  At night they would place sentinels far out in the desert, but these always slept at their posts dreaming of Rollory, and three times every night a guard would march around the city clad in purple, bearing lights and singing songs of Welleran.  Always the guard went unarmed, but as the sound of their song went echoing across the plain towards the looming mountains, the desert robbers would hear the name of Welleran and steal away to their haunts.  Often dawn would come across the plain, shimmering marvellously upon Merimna's spires, abashing all the stars, and find the guard still singing songs of Welleran, and would change the colour of their purple robes and pale the lights they bore.  But the guard would go back leaving the ramparts safe, and one by one the sentinels in the plain would awake from dreaming of Rollory and shuffle back into the city quite cold. Then something of the menace would pass away from the faces of the Cyresian mountains, that from the north and the west and the south lowered upon Merimna, and clear in the morning the statues and the pillars would arise in the old inviolate city.  You would wonder that an unarmed guard and sentinels that slept could defend a city that was stored with all the glories of art, that was rich in gold and bronze, a haughty city that had erst oppressed its neighbours, whose people had forgotten the art of war.  Now this is the reason that, though all her other lands had long been taken from her, Merimna's city was safe.  A strange thing was believed or feared by the fierce tribes beyond the mountains, and it was credited among them that at certain stations round Merimna's ramparts there still rode Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.  Yet it was close on a hundred years since Iraine, the youngest of Merimna's heroes, fought his last battle with the tribes.  Sometimes indeed there arose among the tribes young men who doubted and said: 'How may a man for ever escape death?'  But graver men answered them: 'Hear us, ye whose wisdom has discerned so much, and discern for us how a man may escape death when two score horsemen assail him with their swords, all of them sworn to kill him, and all of them sworn upon their country's gods; as often Welleran hath.  Or discern for us how two men alone may enter a walled city by night, and bring away from it that city's king, as did Soorenard and Mommolek.  Surely men that have escaped so many swords and so many sleety arrows shall escape the years and Time.'  And the young men were humbled and became silent.  Still, the suspicion grew.  And often when the sun set on the Cyresian mountains, men in Merimna discerned the forms of savage tribesmen black against the light, peering towards the city.  All knew in Merimna that the figures round the ramparts were only statues of stone, yet even there a hope lingered among a few that some day their old heroes would come again, for certainly none had ever seen them die.  Now it had been the wont of these six warriors of old, as each received his last wound and knew it to be mortal, to ride away to a certain deep ravine and cast his body in, as somewhere I have read great elephants do, hiding their bones away from lesser beasts.  It was a ravine steep and narrow even at the ends, a great cleft into which no man could come by any path.  There rode Welleran alone, panting hard; and there later rode Soorenard and Mommolek, Mommolek with a mortal wound upon him not to return, but Soorenard was unwounded and rode back alone from leaving his dear friend resting among the mighty bones of Welleran.  And there rode Soorenard, when his day was come, with Rollory and Akanax, and Rollory rode in the middle and Soorenard and Akanax on either side. And the long ride was a hard and weary thing for Soorenard and Akanax, for they both had mortal wounds; but the long ride was easy for Rollory, for he was dead.  So the bones of these five heroes whitened in an enemy's land, and very still they were, though they had troubled cities, and none knew where they lay saving only Iraine, the young captain, who was but twenty-five when Mommolek, Rollory, and Akanax rode away.  And among them were strewn their saddles and their bridles, and all the accoutrements of their horses, lest any man should ever find them afterwards and say in some foreign city: 'Lo! the bridles or the saddles of Merimna's captains, taken in war,' but their beloved trusty horses they turned free.  Forty years afterwards, in the hour of a great victory, his last wound came upon Iraine, and the wound was terrible and would not close.  And Iraine was the last of the captains, and rode away alone.  It was a long way to the dark ravine, and Iraine feared that he would never come to the resting-place of the old heroes, and he urged his horse on swiftly, and clung to the saddle with his hands. And often as he rode he fell asleep, and dreamed of earlier days, and of the times when he first rode forth to the great wars of Welleran, and of the time when Welleran first spake to him, and of the faces of Welleran's comrades when they led charges in the battle.  And ever as he awoke a great longing arose in his soul as it hovered on his body's brink, a longing to lie among the bones of the old heroes.  At last when he saw the dark ravine making a scar across the plain, the soul of Iraine slipped out through his great wound and spread its wings, and pain departed from the poor hacked body, and, still urging his horse forward, Iraine died.  But the old true horse cantered on till suddenly he saw before him the dark ravine and put his forefeet out on the very edge of it and stopped. Then the body of Iraine came toppling forward over the right shoulder of the horse, and his bones mingle and rest as the years go by with the bones of Merimna's heroes.  Now there was a little boy in Merimna named Rold.  I saw him first, I, the dreamer, that sit before my fire asleep, I saw him first as his mother led him through the great hall where stand the trophies of Merimna's heroes.  He was five years old, and they stood before the great glass casket wherein lay the sword of Welleran, and his mother said: 'The sword of Welleran.'  And Rold said: 'What should a man do with the sword of Welleran?'  And his mother answered: 'Men look at the sword and remember Welleran.'  And they went on and stood before the great red cloak of Welleran, and the child said: 'Why did Welleran wear this great red cloak?' And his mother answered: 'It was the way of Welleran.'  When Rold was a little older he stole out of his mother's house quite in the middle of the night when all the world was still, and Merimna asleep dreaming of Welleran, Soorenard, Mommolek, Rollory, Akanax, and young Iraine.  And he went down to the ramparts to hear the purple guard go by singing of Welleran.  And the purple guard came by with lights, all singing in the stillness, and dark shapes out in the desert turned and fled.  And Rold went back again to his mother's house with a great yearning towards the name of Welleran, such as men feel for very holy things.  And in time Rold grew to know the pathway all round the ramparts, and the six equestrian statues that were there guarding Merimna still. "]]]
