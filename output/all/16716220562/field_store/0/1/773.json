A relay of aides, orderlies, and secretaries led us from courtyard to corridor and from corridor to staff headquarters and into the Holy of Holies--the office of the commandant.  Grim, stern,--but courteous throughout the interview,--the major paced the floor beside his desk.  He seemed anxious enough to be rid of the \"crazy Americans\" who had wandered through the Belgian and German lines, not altogether satisfied with their integrity, yet not wishing to take a hostile attitude.  I asked him when he thought the war would be over.  At the moment the German major, Vice-Consul Van Hee, and I were the only persons in the room.  \"I do not know,\" he said, as if thinking aloud; \"I really do not know. America is the only country that has not fired on us yet, but all the rest --\" Then he added thoughtfully, \"Perhaps it is better that you go.  But you cannot return to Ghent or Antwerp; you must go back to Germany.\" He stopped as if he had gone too far, and then sharply commanded the orderly to remove us.  Forty-eight hours later Mr. Van Hee got his release.  To Luther and myself was given a curious sort of pass, beset with limitations, which at times caused us royal treatment and as often proved a fatal baggage tag.  I have always believed a joker lay hidden somewhere in that document.  It started with a flattering description of our status (as given by ourselves), but below it directed us to be taken into Aix-la-Chapelle, Germany, and under no circumstances to be returned within the Belgian lines.  We had seen a great deal too much for that.  In spite of our protestations of good faith and promises to keep dark what we had seen, the military authorities considered us much safer under German guard.  We were to be taken on the southern route by way of Namur.  To drive home the importance of obeying this order we were reminded of the regulation, printed in French and posted throughout the city, \"that whosoever passed the city limits or approached the fighting line without military permit, or on the pretense of having such a permit, or whosoever deviated from the route laid down would be shot 'sur le champ.'\" That same evening, however, army orders declared that the Namur route was closed.  We got a second War Office pass sending us to Aix by way of Louvain, Tirlemont, and Liege.  Armed with these we went down to an old Major Bock von W------, in charge of transportation at Schaerbeek, on the outskirts of the city.  I showed him the passes and said with a painful attempt at levity, \"Major, we can't obey both of these, so we 're going to get shot either way we go.  If it is all the same to you I would rather die on your route.\" To my great relief the old fellow laid back his gray head and emitted a series of long, loud Teuton laughs.  He was the first German I had heard laugh and it did me good.  I knew we were safe.  On the understanding that the business was strictly confidential and that no other citizens or suspects were to know of it, he gave us a permit for the military trains.  It had been the intention of the War Office to pack us under guard with the herds on one of those Government refugee trains.  But to live and sleep with the soldiers as we were now to do, to see their marches, to absorb their uninformed and boastful talk, to study their guns, munitions, and equipment, was better than our highest hopes.  \"You have to do a lot of quick transporting?\" I asked before saying good-bye to Major von W------.  \"Yes,\" was the answer.  \"They 're at us from all sides.  Some of the men we are now transporting have been under fire in two countries, and now they will see service in a third.\" He knew that I had come from Ghent and from Antwerp, which the Germans were about to bombard, yet, to his credit, it should be said that he did not ask for information of Belgian activities.  Similarly, although the soldiers, as a rule, and one man high in the civil government of Brussels, asked what was going on in Antwerp, it was noticeable that German officers recognized the obligations of neutrality.  Of how we left Brussels and of the first part of the eastward trip, I am going to quote from the jottings in the log-book, which was written up at some length after we left Aix-la-Chapelle:--  \"Early on the morning of the 22d, I went up to Consul Watts's office to get the mail pouch I had promised him to carry.  Luther and I then boarded a trolley car going northwest past the Gare du Nord and on to Schaerbeek, a junction on the outskirts of Brussels.  Although the Major Bayer passes, with von W------'s counter-signature, got us as far as Schaerbeek, we were challenged by the guards at the railroad station.  The stations were watched with the most astounding precaution.  Of course there was no such thing as a ticket; once inside the gate you could jump a troop train, ammunition car, or blow up the track if you felt like it.  Wherefore they guarded the stations carefully.  \"At the gates had a terrible pow-wow with an officious Bavarian who called himself the Officer-of-the-Day.  I played all my best German cards, including Count von Bemstorffs letter.  At the end of half an hour our pig-headed officer shipped us back to Brussels.  We returned to von W------, then in Brussels, who vised our pass with a note to the effect that although we were civilians, exceptional circumstances demanded our hurried return to Aix by military train.  \"When we eventually got into the Schaerbeek station we had two hours to wait.  Walked up and down the tracks or sat on the platform, keeping an eye on everything that was going on.  Luther says I spent most of my time trying not to look like an Englishman.  Occasionally, when we spoke a word of English, some officer would shoot us a 42 cm.  glance and demand our papers.  We were undoubtedly marked figures, because in the first place no civilians were allowed along the railway line, especially foreigners.  \"Watched several westbound loads go by until about two o'clock, when they made up a combination train consisting of Red Cross coaches and empty freight trucks going back to Aix for fresh loads of men and ammunition.  Aix is the great distributing center for the line of communication into northern Belgium.  Most of the open cars were empty, barring occasional gun carriages on the way home for repairs; in the closed freight cars lay a few wounded first line men, a half a dozen male nurses, and some privates on furlough.  Speaking of nurses, I haven't--so far at least-seen a woman nurse nearer the scene of action than a base hospital, i.e., one of the big hospitals in Antwerp, Brussels, or Ghent.  Luther and I, closely followed by the two guards that had trailed us from the time we had got inside the station, climbed into a freight car, apparently used as a box stall on the out trip, and bare except for a pile of damp straw in one corner. Interminable journey.  Most of the time we stood on sidings waiting for the outbound traffic.  Made fair time to Louvain,--i.e., an hour and a half,--and stayed there two hours, for which I was thankful, as it gave me a chance to look around.  Interviewed soldiers, citizens, and a Jesuit priest, of which more later.  One hour more to Tirlemont.  Then seven hours to Liege, where we arrived at 2 A.M., were smothered for two hours in that tunnel, and took six and three quarters hours more from Liege to Verviers--a distance of less than fifteen miles! It was another five hours to Aix.  \"Saw tremendous troop movements along Brussels-Louvain-Verviers line of communication.  During the first day thirty-five troop and transport trains went past us, moving towards the western frontier, the larger part to strengthen the German attack on Antwerp, which we had not long left behind us, others to discharge their loads as near as possible to Lille, Tournai, and Mons.  The average train was twenty cars long, making about seven hundred carloads, with two hundred or more in each car, giving a total of more than 140,000 fighting men. We stopped counting at the end of the first day.  \"After we left Louvain I got out occasionally and stretched my legs along the tracks, but Luther, not being able to talk German, stuck pretty close to his diggings.  Had a great time at a little town called Neerwinden, where we stayed about half an hour.  A crowd of soldiers from our train joined a group cooking supper in the moonlight at one of the soup kitchens along the tracks.  They fed me lukewarm stew and slabs of rye bread, then went on singing and arguing without paying much attention to me.  One bald-headed, stocky private told the crowd the news that von Hindenburg had captured Warsaw.  Later a crowd of big brutes, apparently pretty drunk, swaggered down and clapped me on the back with a 'Who are you, my friend?'  \"'Amerikaner,' I explained, not thinking it necessary to mention the war correspondent part.  They set up a cheer, clapped me on the back, and finally lifted me to their shoulders for a triumphal ride up and down the railroad ties, all the time yelling out 'Amerikaner! Hurrah! Amerikaner!'  \"A few hundred years seemed the night we spent locked in that box-car prison.  A five-days' equinoctial storm had given way to the coldest day of the autumn: our car, raw and dank as a dungeon, joggled along endlessly until afternoon gave way to evening and evening to chilly night.  Hour after hour we looked out upon the rolling fields and burnt farmhouses along the path where General von Emmich's army had passed.  As the moon crawled up over the rain-bathed foothills of the Ourthe Mountains, the temperature dropped far below the freezing point. For ages we lay awake braced against the cold.  The soldier next me, who had been through the fight at Maubeuge, coughed throughout the night--a hollow, retching cough. \"Tuberculosis,\" the Red Cross doctor"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10918"],["title","The Log of a Noncombatant (#5)"],["body","me, although the fellow had got through his army tests all right.  Between two and four in the morning we stuck in the middle of a tunnel of the northern Vosges Mountains, two hundred feet, perhaps, beneath the surface of the ground.  The sliding door on the left side of our car was locked: on the other side jagged walls, dripping wet to the touch, jutted so close that a thin man couldn't have walked between them and the car.  Everywhere pitch blackness, the blackness of the tomb.  The consumptive soldier pulled a candle from his kit, balanced it in the straw, and over it warmed his hands.  If that candle had toppled over in the straw we wouldn't have had a rat's chance in the fire.  It was impossible to get out of our car or to communicate with another except by tapping.  The fellows in the next car must have been considerably frightened, for after about an hour they began yelling and pounding at the walls.  All you could hear was a roaring sound that caromed against the walls of the cavern.  Smoke from the engine drifted back to choke us.  It hit the consumptive worst.  The poor fellow began blowing and coughing, then rolled feebly on his back and gasped.  During the worst of the smoke one of the soldiers in the next car set up a rollicking song, and others followed his example.  We could hear the clank of beer bottles as they finished, the echoes of the song reverberating loudly, then faintly, then louder again up and down the length of that interminable vault.  A draught of air cleared the smoke away and it didn't bother us again.  At four in the morning we steamed out of the tunnel into the open.  A little after that I must have dozed off, for I woke with a start when the consumptive stumbled over me.  \"There you are,\" he said, throwing a bundle beside me; \"I thought you'd need it.\"  Noticing, when he lit his pipe at dawn, that we had no army blankets and were pretty nearly frozen, this \"barbarian\" had jumped out of the car in the Liege freight yards, had run a quarter of a mile to the nearest army kitchen depot, and had stolen for us a couple of heaping blankets' full of warm, dry straw.  It was impossible to believe that these men had committed the atrocities reported at Termonde and Roosbeek, at Malines and Louvain.  At close range it was easy to see that the prevalent conception of the \"barbarians\" was the purest kind of rot--the picture created and fostered by the Allied press, of a vicious and besotted beast with natural brutality accentuated by alcoholic rage. With such men as individuals it seemed to us that neutral observers could have no quarrel.  To the Kaiser's privates who have been fighting for a cause they do not thoroughly understand, was due, we thought, the greatest respect; to the officers, too, who understand what they are doing and are game in the face of odds; and most of all to the suffering German people.  But to the German war machine, we reflected, was due a terrible punishment--the lesson it must learn not only for Germany's enlightenment, but for the sake of civilization and humanity.     Chapter IV  A Clog Dance On The Scheldt    When the German major at Aix-la-Cha-pelle stamped on our passports:-- \"Gesehen.  Gut Zum Austritt Kommandant 2 Kompagnie, Landsturm Batl. Aachen,\" we were free, so we thought, to shake the dust of Germany from our feet.  Hoisting our rucksacks, we gave up box cars in favor of a civilized passenger train, northward bound, and at noon crossed the Dutch border at Simplefeldt.  For three hours we talked English, consulted maps, took notes, and asked questions where and when we pleased.  The holiday cost us dear.  At the end of that time we were under lock and key in the town of Maastricht, the Province of Limburg, and the supposedly free and neutral Kingdom of the Netherlands.  We suspected at the time, and in view of what I learned upon a later trip to Berlin I am quite certain, that the long arm of the German Secret Service had reached out for us across the border.  Having started from Antwerp during its investment, but prior to its siege by the German army, we were now on the third stage of a round trip which was to land one of us back in the Belgian temporary capital in time for the bombardment.  During the previous two weeks we had been stopped, questioned, and sometimes examined, no less than one hundred and thirty times.  Thirteen, we calculated, was our average number of hold-ups on our early \"marching days\"; that is to say, during those wanderings which led us by foot, train, ox cart, and automobile past the double sector of Antwerp's fortifications, through the Belgian fighting lines to Ghent and Termonde, and thence into the arms of the German pickets on the outskirts of Brussels.  And now, as the heavy door of the Maastricht police headquarters slammed in our faces, and the key rattled in the guardroom lock, my companion in crime threw down his hat and coat in rage.  Between us we treated our fellow-prisoners to a quarter of an hour's tirade on the American citizen's right to freedom, swore that the Kingdom of the Netherlands would repent this outrage, and each of us politely assured the other it was all the other fellow's fault.  All of which, though true, had no effect on the sniffling young woman across the way, nor the sleeper on the hardwood bench next mine, nor the bald-headed, big-lipped police sergeant who bent over his desk in the corner, impervious to these usual outbursts of the newly arrested, as he laboriously scrawled in the police blotter the report of the day's round-up.  \"Sit down!\" he bellowed as I advanced toward the pen door, and tried to open it.  When he resumed his scratching I did my best to explain in a German-French-Dutch dialect of my own invention that we wished to see Mons. le Commissaire at once; that we had only come to inspect the concentration camp of German and Belgian prisoners, and that we were leaving town that day.  I particularly emphasized this point. We were, in fact, I assured him in several different ways, leaving that very afternoon--as soon as the disagreeable mistake of our arrest was rectified.  He may or may not have understood this: at all events, he wore an expression as blank and graven as Jack Rose upon the witness stand.  His only answer was a vacant stare at the pit of my stomach, followed by a slow scratch-scratching on the police blotter.  In fact our arrest on that occasion was rather a Jack Rose affair; that is to say, it started by our being invited to headquarters, suspicious but not certain of our status until we finally landed behind the iron doors.  Without doubt Maastricht authorities were waiting for us even as we stepped off the train, showing that we were doomed from the time we left the border.  Our captor, an unctuous, pink-cheeked politzei, made his appearance not far from the internment camp. Where were we going, and why?  \"To see the prisoners,\" we said.  \"It is possible,\" said the spider to the fly, \"zat I can get for you permission if you will come to ze guardhouse.  Ze capitain is there.\"  The \"guardhouse\" proved a precinct police station, and the captain was not there: instead we found a mixed crowd of civilians and militaires who looked us over and shook their heads.  Next we were taken to military headquarters \\n the center of the town.  For fifteen minutes we hunted the evasive captain while I ran through my head the various sets of credentials stuffed in different pockets; for, being in Dutch territory, although only a few miles from the Belgian frontier on one side and the German frontier on the other, I was not quite certain which to produce.  Among my letters I carried one from the German Ambassador, Count von Bernstorff, to the Foreign Office in Berlin; one from Professor Hugo Munsterberg at Harvard, and a note from the secretary of the Belgian Legation at The Hague. Unfortunately I did not have with me at the time a very helpful letter from Colonel Roosevelt, ending with the statement that the bearer \"is an American citizen, a non-combatant, and emphatically not a spy.\" I had promised the Colonel to use this, my trump card, only in case of necessity--and once, on a later occasion, I did so with immediate effect.  On the whole, I now decided in favor of a United States passport decorated with my picture and enough vises to resemble the diplomatic history of the Continent.  \"The captain is not here.  We go to the commissaire at headquarters,\" said the polite politzei.  It was then that we cut loose, told him to bring the commissaire or the burgomaster to us, and started to walk off. It was a bad move.  So far he had handled us with a velvet grip, but at the first sign of insurrection he showed his teeth, locked arms with each of us, and, signaling another officer to follow, forthwith marched us off to police headquarters and our ultimate resting-place, the guardroom cell.  How long we stayed there I don't know--long enough, at all events, to get a glimpse of the Dutch police system and the third degree as practiced in the Lowlands.  There swung open a great iron door leading to the street and the market-place, not so large but fully as busy as Washington Market the week before Thanksgiving.  Through it, sobbing and screaming, their hats gone and their hair torn, came two women, roughly handled by gendarmes and followed by a mob escort.  They were thrown weeping and expostulating into an adjoining cell.  A gendarme came out with trickles of blood on his face.  He mopped his brow and complained of feminine finger-nails.  Close behind him followed a male friend of the imprisoned women.  He pleaded with the sergeant at the desk, while the moans of the women, under pressure to confess their crime, came from their cell. But Jack Rose only scratched and scratched monotonously, and now and then gazed at the middle of the speaker's stomach.  In the mean time we fell back into our habit of talking for publication. With an intimacy that would have surprised those"]]]
