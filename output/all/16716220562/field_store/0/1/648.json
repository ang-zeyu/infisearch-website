The idea is as new and as strange as if you had never known it.  \"What lies beyond the surface of the solar globe?  Something must;  something as much rarer and thinner than the ether as the ether is rarer and thinner than prakriti.  Can you not guess?  \"It is Prana, the life force of the universe.  As prakriti is made from ether, so ether is made from prana.  It is made in the same way.  Each atom of the ether is the centre of a molecule of prana, surrounded by an atmosphere of pranic atoms, exactly as your prakritic atom is surrounded by an atmosphere of etheric atoms.  You say that each atom of prakriti is the centre of a molecule of ether.  So it is.  But each atom of that etheric molecule is the centre of a pranic molecule.  Each atom of your physical matter is triple, not double.  \"You say that all physical phenomena come from the chording vibration of the etheric and prakritic atoms of the two planes of matter.  Yes.  But do you not see that all vital phenomena come from the chording vibration of the pranic, etheric, and prakritic atom of the three planes of matter which are in each atom?  \"In the living leaf the three planes are sounding in chord in each atom of it.  In the dead leaf, drying up and falling to pieces, only the lower two are sounding in chord.  The silver chord has been broken.  \"Each atom of prakriti you say has the potentiality of some kind of phenomenon.  We add 'and of life also.'  The potentialities of life are in every atom of prakriti.  Even the atom of iron may live in the blood.  It cannot become a part of any living organism until its prana is sounding the chord of life in unison with the ether and prakriti--the threefold silver chord.  \"What is the centre of this prana?  It is Alcyone.  There are other solar globes beside ours circling around Alcyone, and we have been considering only our own solar globe of ether.  Alcyone is the centre of the prana in which they revolve as the sun is the centre of our ether in which the planets revolve.  As this prana has a centre around which we revolve with other solar systems, then it must have a center of gravity.  \"Then this prana is a globe.  \"The prana does not then fill this material universe.  There must be yet another form of matter rarer and finer than prana, from which prana is made, as ether is made from prana and prakriti from ether.  Have we any other class of phenomena to explain, except vital and physical?  Yes, there is a very important class, mental.  And here we have the explanation, if we exercise our reason.  \"These pranic globes are floating in an ocean of manasa, matter in its rarest form.  \"Each atom of prana is formed from manasa, exactly as ether was formed from prana, and each pranic atom in the universe is the centre of a manasic molecule, having an atmosphere of manasic atoms.  \"So we are not exact in giving the prakritic atom three planes or octaves of vibration.  It has four.  You merely surround it with etheric atoms, and this is correct so far as it goes.  You only wish to explain physical problems.  But there are other problems to be explained, problems of life and mind, and the same knowledge you have explains them as well as the others, if you simply avail yourself of it.  That you do not consider the atom as four-fold instead of two-fold is your own fault.  I have not told you anything you did not already know.  I have only asked you to apply your present knowledge of physics to these problems of life and mind, and apply your reasoning powers.  \"The chording vibration in an atom of matter of  \"The two planes produces Force, or phenomena  \"The three planes produces Life--the silver chord  \"The four planes produces Mind--the golden chord.  \"You say there is no gulf between the prakritic and etheric worlds;  that it is one continuous world;  and all its phenomena are by continuity and not impact.  That is true, but it is not the whole truth.  \"There is no gulf to cross between the prakritic and etheric worlds;  none to cross between that and the manasic.  The four worlds are one great world, continuous, interchangeable.  Through the four as well as through the two, there is continuity and not impact.  Whether it is an atom or a world, the four are there. Nothing, no combination of atoms, no matter of any kind, however small or large, can exist in this prakritic world unless it has the four elements, which from time immemorial our philosophers have called Earth, Water, Fire, Air, meaning the four globes or forms of matter in the universe.  We do not have to leave the earth to live in the etheric globe.  It is here.  Nor do we have to go millions of miles to reach the pranic globe.  It is here. The problems of light and heat are no easier than the problems of birth and death.  The pranic globe is within us;  within everything.  So is the manasic.  \"It is here on these higher planes that the chances for worthy study are greatest.  At least we think so, though you may not. We live on the manasic--pranic--etheric globe on precisely the same terms that we live on this of prakriti, and the problems of the three are equally open to us.  \"If there are any who care to follow up the line of thought I have opened, who care for the questions that interest us of the East, I will talk as long as they care to listen, provided they will not ask for knowledge that will give them power over others, which cannot fail to be used for evil.\"  This is but a glimpse of Hindu physics, yet it has helped us in the metaphysics.  We now understand the chain of globes--in part.  The earth is fourfold.  As each atom of the earth is fourfold, so their aggregations give us prakritic earth, an etheric earth, a pranic earth, and a manasic earth--in coadunition and not like the skin of an onion.  They are separate and distinct globes, each on its own plane.  It is four down and three up for the Angel entering matter, whether from the outmost boundary of manasic matter, or the surface of the earth, or the cover of a baseball.  The \"chain of globes\" in the Secret Doctrine represents the unity of the material universe.  The three-fold nature of the astral model is revealed, and the unity of all prakritic things.  But more than that, to many minds, will be the explanation it gives of why there are but four planes of vibration in matter;  that the highest form of development in prakriti shows only four elements, prakriti or body, sensation or force, life, and mind, and that these last three, present in all things in esse, become present in posse when they work together harmonically.     Chapter Six  Our Place on Earth   The next time our wise man from the east was asked to \"say a few words and make his own topic,\" he spoke, perhaps, as follows:  \"How large do you think the earth is?  You answer promptly, 7,912 miles in diameter.  You are as far out of the way as you were in supposing that our sun could be a centre of gravity of a lot of planets revolving around it and around Alcyone without being a globe of ether.  Now that it has been mentioned, you see very clearly for yourself that it must be a solar globe of ether.  It follows from one of your physical axioms.  When I tell you why the earth is and must be about fifty thousand miles in diameter, you will see that it must be so, and that you knew it all the time, but never stopped to formulate your knowledge.  You have had the knowledge for three centuries without applying it.  \"It was in 1609 that your greatest astronomer, John Kepler, announced as one of three harmonic laws by which the universe was governed, that the squares of the times of the planets were proportional to the cubes of their distances from the sun;  and that this law was true in physics and everywhere.  No one of your scientists has had the wisdom to study out what it meant, and for three centuries, for 291 years, you have repeated his words like so many parrots, instead of using the key he gave you to unlock the mysteries of the universe.  A corollary of his law is that the planets move in their orbits because they are impelled thereto between the two forces, and move in a mean curve between them;  but it was not until 1896 that you discovered that the mean between two forces is always a curve and never a straight line.  You have not a text book in a school today that does not repeat this fundamental and absurd error--which you have known for three centuries to be an error--that the motion resulting from a mean between forces is \"in a straight line.\"  The curves resulting here are not to be measured easily, and are so large that small segments appear straight lines;  and it was not until Carpenter demonstrated it mathematically that any one could believe it true.  \"There are two great forces in this universe.  Your grandfathers called them Centripetal and Centrifugal forces;  your fathers called them Gravity and Apergy, names which still cling to them; and you call them Attraction and Repulsion.  \"It was Kepler, not Newton, who discovered that Attraction or Gravity was in inverse proportion to the square of the distance.  \"You know the meaning of this mystic phrase, 'as the squares of the distance.'  You understand that it means the attraction at two feet is only one-fourth the attraction at one foot;  at four feet only one-sixteenth;  at eight feet, only one sixty-fourth.  \"But who knows or cares for Kepler's great law of Repulsion, or Apergy?  That was that the 'square of the times are as the cubes of the distance.'  It has lain fallow for centuries.  No one of your western physicists has ever studied it, or tried to explain it.  It remains just where Kepler left it, as the mere law of orbital revolution of the planets only.  \"It is the key to the proper understanding of the universe.  \"'The squares of the times are as the cubes of the distance' means that all motion is the result"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],["title","Ancient and Modern Physics (#7)"],["body"," two forces acting upon prakriti, and that where the two forces are balanced, or equal, the result in motion is a circle or ellipse, the square of the Repulsion being equal to the cube of the Attraction to make them equal and produce a circle.  In other cases they produce hyperbola and parabola.  \"This is a little dry--nearly all fundamental knowledge is--but the reward of patience is great.  \"The orbital speed of the earth is about 60,000 miles per hour. The attraction of the sun exactly equals the repulsion created by the motion;  more accurately, the speed created by the repulsion. The result of the two forces working together at exact balance is a circle.  An ellipse is a circle bent a little, and the ellipse in which the earth actually moves comes from varying attraction and repulsion.  Kepler's second law covers that.  \"If the orbital speed of the earth were a mile less per hour, or even a foot less, then the earth would wind up around the sun as a dog gets wound up with his chain around a tree.  If this speed were a mile more per hour, then the earth would wind out, each year getting farther and farther away, until finally it would be lost.  When the speed is exactly proportional to the pull--that is, when it is as 1.6 is to 2,--the result is a circular orbit, the eccentricity of which is caused by certain fluctuations in the attraction and repulsion.  \"Suppose a planet were to be placed so that it would have a time of two years.  Its distance from the sun would be 1.6 that of the earth.  Why?  Because to get the time doubled we would have to take the square root of 4;  and to get the distance the cube root of the same number, 4.  If you wish to be very exact the cube root is 1.5889, but 1.6 is near enough for all ordinary work.  \"If you wanted to find out the distance of a planet revolving in six months you would divide the earth's distance by 1.6.  \"In proportion you get any time or distance you may desire with absolute accuracy.  The distance of any planet from the sun gives its time, or its time gives its distance--when that of any of the others is known.  This law applies throughout the universe; in everything and everywhere.  It is not a law of orbital revolution alone, but a law of all motion.  \"Our moon has a time of 29 days and a speed of about 50,000 miles per day.  If the speed were greater it would leave us, if less it would wind up, falling to the earth in the form of a spiral.  \"At what distance would it have to be to have a time of fourteen days? Divide 240,000 miles by 1.6.  A seven-day moon, would be 1.6 that distance.  And the exact distance for a one-day moon, for a moon that would always be in the same place in the heavens, moving as the earth revolved on its axis, would be about 24,998 miles.  \"This gives us the line of 24-hour axial rotation, the true surface of the earth, and the sheer-line of prakritic matter. Beyond that line is the ether;  within that line is prakriti.  \"It is the line of no weight, where gravity and apergy exactly balance.  Inside that line gravity exceeds apergy and everything revolving in less time, or that time, must fall to the centre. It is the true surface of any 24-hour globe of this size and weight.  A moon to revolve around the earth in less than one day must move faster than the earth to develop enough apergy to overcome the attraction.  That phenomenon we see in the moons of Mars, which are within its atmosphere;  within the planet itself.  \"We of the East learned this true size of the earth over six thousand years ago, from observing the moons of Jupiter.  The times of the first three are doubled.  We asked ourselves what this meant and found that their distance was increased by the cube root of 4 when their times were increased by the square root of 4;  that time was to distance as 1.6 was to 2.  Then we applied the key, and found it unlocked many mysteries.  \"The first lesson this taught us was that we did not live on the earth, but within the earth, at the line of liquid and gaseous changes, where the three forms of matter meet and mingle and interchange with each other.  We lived at the bottom of a gaseous ocean 21,000 miles above us, and 4,000 miles from the centre of the globe.  It gave us an entirely new conception of the earth, and of our place in it.  \"We saw that we lived in a narrow belt, or skin, of the earth, not more than 100 miles thick, perhaps not more than ten miles. Within this belt the prakritic elementary substances varied their condition, combined, and made forms by increasing or decreasing vibration.  It was the creative and destructive zone, the evolutionary \"mother\"--the liquid level of the prakriti--the seat of all physical phenomena.  Fifty miles above, the masses of nitrogen and oxygen and argon were too cold to change their rate of vibration.  Fifty miles below the surface of the earth all things were too hot for changes in vibration.  In this kinetic belt, between two static masses our bodies had been made, and also, in all probability, all combinations of the elementary substances.  It was four thousand miles to the centre of the static prakritic mass beneath us;  twenty-one thousand miles to the surface of the static prakritic mass above us, and the small kinetic belt between was only one hundred miles thick.  But we had one consolation, the prakriti we had was all kinetic, and the best in the whole mass.  \"The second lesson it taught us was that as the earth had been made in the etheric globe, in a corresponding skin or plane of kinetic etheric energy, with our ether the best of the solar output, that we ourselves were subject through our ether to the phenomena of that kinetic solar plane in precisely the same way we now are to the phenomena of the kinetic prakritic plane.  Once rid of the fallacious notion that we were creatures of the surface of the earth, once clearly conscious that we were creatures of the interior, of the bottom of this gaseous ocean, then we could understand not only how the earth could be created in this etheric globe, but how we could be creatures of the solar globe living on it.  \"When we learned that lesson, and learned it well, it dawned upon us that we were living in the pranic globe at the same kinetic level or plane of that globe, the line where its solids and liquids and gases mingled and passed from one state to another, the kinetic belt in which our solar globe has been made, and that we were living as truly on that globe as we were on this prakritic globe.  Our position on each globe was the same.  \"And then the great truth came that we lived in the manasic globe, at the same kinetic level;  and that we lived our lives on the four globes simultaneously.  Our bodies are fourfold.  Every atom is fourfold, ready to respond in our minds to the vibrations of the Manasic world, in our vitality to the pranic vibrations of the pranic world, in our nerves to the etheric vibrations of the etheric world, and in our prakriti to vibrations of the prakritic world.  Each one of our bodies lived on its own earth globe, for there were four globes of this earth--in coadunition--in its corresponding kind of globe.  \"The four earth globes became one globe, as our four bodies were one body;  and the chain of four kinds of globes in matter became one globe, as the manasic with the others on it.  \"These four kinds of globes were the beginning and the end of matter, as we distinguish and know matter.  They were not the end of vibration;  or of planes of vibration;  or of realms beyond this material universe;  but they were the limits of all that is common to each and every atom of this lower plane of vibration.  \"It is upon this solid and perfect foundation of physics, that accounts for and explains every kind of phenomena, we have constructed our metaphysics.  All that belongs to these four lower planes we consider and treat as physics.  All that relates to the planes beyond we consider metaphysics.  Can you teach a child equation of payments before he knows the first four rules? You would not attempt such a task.  The first four rules are the physics of arithmetic;  all beyond is the metaphysics of arithmetic.  It flows out of them.  Can you comprehend our system of metaphysics until you have clearly and completely mastered our physics?  Would you not get into a fog at the very start?  \"There can be no system of metaphysics without a solid foundation of physics.  The idea is unthinkable.  The one grows out of the other.  It is its life;  its fruit, its flower.  \"You have no western system of physics.  Your physics are without form and void;  patchwork, constantly changing.  There is no substantial foundation for any system of metaphysics.  What you say or do in physics is fragmentary or chaotic.  \"It is perfectly true, so far as you have gone through the first invisible world of ether, you are much more masters of detail than we are.  \"We have not cared particularly for the minor details by which explosives are made, or metals obtained from oxides.  We have preferred to push on into realms beyond as fast as we could, seeking first the Kingdom of Heaven and its Righteousness, knowing that when it was found all these things would be added unto us.\"     Chapter Seven  The Four Globes   That we live in the earth, not on the earth, is one of the most important of the facts of eastern physics in the study of its metaphysics.  The mathematical and physical proof that the physical earth is 50,000 miles in diameter should not be passed over lightly in our haste to get on, for the perfect understanding of all this fact implies makes easy the comprehension of how we live etherically in the solar etheric globe, of how we live pranically in the stellar pranic globe, and how we live manasically in the manasic globe.  As we live within the narrow \"skin\" of phenomena, not more than 100 miles thick, of this prakritic globe, with the whole earth within the corresponding skin of phenomena of the solar etheric globe,"]]]
