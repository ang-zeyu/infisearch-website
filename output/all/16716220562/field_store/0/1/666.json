Mr.       Jonas Oldacre is a well-known resident of that suburb, where he       has carried on his business as a builder for many years. Mr.       Oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep       Dene House, at the Sydenham end of the road of that name. He has       had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits, secretive       and retiring. For some years he has practically withdrawn from       the business, in which he is said to have massed considerable       wealth. A small timber-yard still exists, however, at the back of       the house, and last night, about twelve o’clock, an alarm was       given that one of the stacks was on fire. The engines were soon       upon the spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it       was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had       been entirely consumed. Up to this point the incident bore the       appearance of an ordinary accident, but fresh indications seem to       point to serious crime. Surprise was expressed at the absence of       the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire, and       an inquiry followed, which showed that he had disappeared from       the house. An examination of his room revealed that the bed had       not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open, that a       number of important papers were scattered about the room, and       finally, that there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight       traces of blood being found within the room, and an oaken       walking-stick, which also showed stains of blood upon the handle.       It is known that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late visitor in       his bedroom upon that night, and the stick found has been       identified as the property of this person, who is a young London       solicitor named John Hector McFarlane, junior partner of Graham       and McFarlane, of 426, Gresham Buildings, E.C. The police believe       that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very       convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be       doubted that sensational developments will follow.           “LATER.—It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr. John Hector           McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the           murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. It is at least certain that a           warrant has been issued. There have been further and sinister           developments in the investigation at Norwood. Besides the           signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it           is now known that the French windows of his bedroom (which is           on the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were           marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the           wood-pile, and, finally, it is asserted that charred remains           have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire. The           police theory is that a most sensational crime has been           committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his own           bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across           to the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all           traces of the crime. The conduct of the criminal           investigation has been left in the experienced hands of           Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is following up the           clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.”        Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and fingertips together       to this remarkable account.        “The case has certainly some points of interest,” said he, in his       languid fashion. “May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane,       how it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to       be enough evidence to justify your arrest?”        “I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with my parents, Mr.       Holmes, but last night, having to do business very late with Mr.       Jonas Oldacre, I stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my       business from there. I knew nothing of this affair until I was in       the train, when I read what you have just heard. I at once saw       the horrible danger of my position, and I hurried to put the case       into your hands. I have no doubt that I should have been arrested       either at my city office or at my home. A man followed me from       London Bridge Station, and I have no doubt—Great heaven! what is       that?”        It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps       upon the stair. A moment later, our old friend Lestrade appeared       in the doorway. Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or       two uniformed policemen outside.        “Mr. John Hector McFarlane?” said Lestrade.        Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.        “I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of       Lower Norwood.”        McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into       his chair once more like one who is crushed.        “One moment, Lestrade,” said Holmes. “Half an hour more or less       can make no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to       give us an account of this very interesting affair, which might       aid us in clearing it up.”        “I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,” said       Lestrade, grimly.        “None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested       to hear his account.”        “Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything,       for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past,       and we owe you a good turn at Scotland Yard,” said Lestrade. “At       the same time I must remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to       warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against       him.”        “I wish nothing better,” said our client. “All I ask is that you       should hear and recognize the absolute truth.”        Lestrade looked at his watch. “I’ll give you half an hour,” said       he.        “I must explain first,” said McFarlane, “that I knew nothing of       Mr. Jonas Oldacre. His name was familiar to me, for many years       ago my parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart.       I was very much surprised therefore, when yesterday, about three       o’clock in the afternoon, he walked into my office in the city.       But I was still more astonished when he told me the object of his       visit. He had in his hand several sheets of a notebook, covered       with scribbled writing—here they are—and he laid them on my       table.        “‘Here is my will,’ said he. ‘I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast       it into proper legal shape. I will sit here while you do so.’        “I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment       when I found that, with some reservations, he had left all his       property to me. He was a strange little ferret-like man, with       white eyelashes, and when I looked up at him I found his keen       grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression. I could hardly       believe my own as I read the terms of the will; but he explained       that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation, that he       had known my parents in his youth, and that he had always heard       of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured that his       money would be in worthy hands. Of course, I could only stammer       out my thanks. The will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed       by my clerk. This is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I       have explained, are the rough draft. Mr. Jonas Oldacre then       informed me that there were a number of documents—building       leases, title-deeds, mortgages, scrip, and so forth—which it was       necessary that I should see and understand. He said that his mind       would not be easy until the whole thing was settled, and he       begged me to come out to his house at Norwood that night,       bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters. ‘Remember, my       boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until       everything is settled. We will keep it as a little surprise for       them.’ He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise       it faithfully.        “You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not in a humour to       refuse him anything that he might ask. He was my benefactor, and       all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular. I       sent a telegram home, therefore, to say that I had important       business on hand, and that it was impossible for me to say how       late I might be. Mr. Oldacre had told me that he would like me to       have supper with him at nine, as he might not be home before that       hour. I had some difficulty in finding his house, however, and it       was nearly half-past before I reached it. I found him——”        “One moment!” said Holmes. “Who opened the door?”        “A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.”        “And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?”        “Exactly,” said McFarlane.        “Pray proceed.”        McFarlane wiped his damp brow, and then continued his narrative:        “I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal       supper was laid out. Afterwards, Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into       his bedroom, in which there stood a heavy safe. This he opened       and took out a mass of documents, which we went over together. It       was between eleven and twelve when we finished. He remarked that       we must not disturb the housekeeper. He showed me out through his       own French window,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/108"],["title","The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#7)"],["body"," which had been open all this time.”        “Was the blind down?” asked Holmes.        “I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down.       Yes, I remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the       window. I could not find my stick, and he said, ‘Never mind, my       boy, I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep       your stick until you come back to claim it.’ I left him there,       the safe open, and the papers made up in packets upon the table.       It was so late that I could not get back to Blackheath, so I       spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing more       until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.”        “Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr. Holmes?” said       Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this       remarkable explanation.        “Not until I have been to Blackheath.”        “You mean to Norwood,” said Lestrade.        “Oh, yes, no doubt that is what I must have meant,” said Holmes,       with his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more       experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain       could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him       look curiously at my companion.        “I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr.       Sherlock Holmes,” said he. “Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my       constables are at the door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting.”       The wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance       at us walked from the room. The officers conducted him to the       cab, but Lestrade remained.        Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of       the will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon       his face.        “There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there       not?” said he, pushing them over.        The official looked at them with a puzzled expression.        “I can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the       second page, and one or two at the end. Those are as clear as       print,” said he, “but the writing in between is very bad, and       there are three places where I cannot read it at all.”        “What do you make of that?” said Holmes.        “Well, what do _you_ make of it?”        “That it was written in a train. The good writing represents       stations, the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing       passing over points. A scientific expert would pronounce at once       that this was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere save in       the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a       succession of points. Granting that his whole journey was       occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an express,       only stopping once between Norwood and London Bridge.”        Lestrade began to laugh.        “You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories,       Mr. Holmes,” said he. “How does this bear on the case?”        “Well, it corroborates the young man’s story to the extent that       the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday.       It is curious—is it not?—that a man should draw up so important a       document in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not       think it was going to be of much practical importance. If a man       drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective, he       might do it so.”        “Well, he drew up his own death warrant at the same time,” said       Lestrade.        “Oh, you think so?”        “Don’t you?”        “Well, it is quite possible, but the case is not clear to me       yet.”        “Not clear? Well, if that isn’t clear, what _could_ be clearer?       Here is a young man who learns suddenly that, if a certain older       man dies, he will succeed to a fortune. What does he do? He says       nothing to anyone, but he arranges that he shall go out on some       pretext to see his client that night. He waits until the only       other person in the house is in bed, and then in the solitude of       a man’s room he murders him, burns his body in the wood-pile, and       departs to a neighbouring hotel. The blood-stains in the room and       also on the stick are very slight. It is probable that he       imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the       body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his       death—traces which, for some reason, must have pointed to him. Is       not all this obvious?”        “It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too       obvious,” said Holmes. “You do not add imagination to your other       great qualities, but if you could for one moment put yourself in       the place of this young man, would you choose the very night       after the will had been made to commit your crime? Would it not       seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between       the two incidents? Again, would you choose an occasion when you       are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in? And,       finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body, and       yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal?       Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.”        “As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a       criminal is often flurried, and does such things, which a cool       man would avoid. He was very likely afraid to go back to the       room. Give me another theory that would fit the facts.”        “I could very easily give you half a dozen,” said Holmes. “Here       for example, is a very possible and even probable one. I make you       a free present of it. The older man is showing documents which       are of evident value. A passing tramp sees them through the       window, the blind of which is only half down. Exit the solicitor.       Enter the tramp! He seizes a stick, which he observes there,       kills Oldacre, and departs after burning the body.”        “Why should the tramp burn the body?”        “For the matter of that, why should McFarlane?”        “To hide some evidence.”        “Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had       been committed.”        “And why did the tramp take nothing?”        “Because they were papers that he could not negotiate.”        Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner       was less absolutely assured than before.        “Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and       while you are finding him we will hold on to our man. The future       will show which is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes:       that so far as we know, none of the papers were removed, and that       the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for       removing them, since he was heir-at-law, and would come into them       in any case.”        My friend seemed struck by this remark.        “I don’t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very       strongly in favour of your theory,” said he. “I only wish to       point out that there are other theories possible. As you say, the       future will decide. Good-morning! I dare say that in the course       of the day I shall drop in at Norwood and see how you are getting       on.”        When the detective departed, my friend rose and made his       preparations for the day’s work with the alert air of a man who       has a congenial task before him.        “My first movement Watson,” said he, as he bustled into his       frockcoat, “must, as I said, be in the direction of Blackheath.”        “And why not Norwood?”        “Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close       to the heels of another singular incident. The police are making       the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second,       because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal. But       it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is       to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first       incident—the curious will, so suddenly made, and to so unexpected       an heir. It may do something to simplify what followed. No, my       dear fellow, I don’t think you can help me. There is no prospect       of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. I       trust that when I see you in the evening, I will be able to       report that I have been able to do something for this unfortunate       youngster, who has thrown himself upon my protection.”        It was late when my friend returned, and I could see, by a glance       at his haggard and anxious face, that the high hopes with which       he had started had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away       upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits.       At last he flung down the instrument, and plunged into a detailed       account of his misadventures.        “It’s all going wrong, Watson—all as wrong as it can go. I kept a       bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for       once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong.       All my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other,       and I much fear that British juries have not yet attained that       pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my       theories over Lestrade’s facts.”        “Did you go to Blackheath?”        “Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the       late lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard. The       father was away in search of his son. The mother was at home—a       little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and       indignation. Of course, she would not admit even the possibility       of his guilt. But she would not express either surprise or regret       over the fate of Oldacre. On the contrary, she spoke of him with       such bitterness that"]]]
