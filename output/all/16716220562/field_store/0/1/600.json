CHAPTER I BEN BARCLAY MEETS A TRAMP   \"Give me a ride?\"  Ben Barclay checked the horse he was driving and looked attentively at the speaker.  He was a stout-built, dark-complexioned man, with a beard of a week's growth, wearing an old and dirty suit, which would have reduced any tailor to despair if taken to him for cleaning and repairs.  A loose hat, with a torn crown, surmounted a singularly ill-favored visage.  \"A tramp, and a hard looking one!\" said Ben to himself.  He hesitated about answering, being naturally reluctant to have such a traveling companion.  \"Well, what do you say?\" demanded the tramp rather impatiently. \"There's plenty of room on that seat, and I'm dead tired.\"  \"Where are you going?\" asked Ben.  \"Same way you are--to Pentonville.\"  \"You can ride,\" said Ben, in a tone by means cordial, and he halted his horse till his unsavory companion climbed into the wagon.  They were two miles from Pentonville, and Ben had a prospect of a longer ride than he desired under the circumstances.  His companion pulled out a dirty clay pipe from his pocket, and filled it with tobacco, and then explored another pocket for a match.  A muttered oath showed that he failed to find one.  \"Got a match, boy?\" he asked.  \"No,\" answered Ben, glad to have escaped the offensive fumes of the pipe.  \"Just my luck!\" growled the tramp, putting back the pipe with a look of disappointment.  \"If you had a match now, I wouldn't mind letting you have a whiff or two.  \"I don't smoke,\" answered Ben, hardly able to repress a look of disgust.  \"So you're a good boy, eh?  One of the Sunday school kids that want to be an angel, hey?  Pah!\" and the tramp exhibited the disgust which the idea gave him.  \"Yes, I go to Sunday school,\" said Ben coldly, feeling more and more repelled by his companion.  \"I never went to Sunday school,\" said his companion.  \"And I wouldn't. It's only good for milksops and hypocrites.\"  \"Do you think you're any better for not going?\" Ben couldn't help asking.  \"I haven't been so prosperous, if that's what you mean.  I'm a straightforward man, I am.  You always know where to find me.  There ain't no piety about me.  What are you laughin' at?\"  \"No offense,\" said Ben.  \"I believe every word you say.\"  \"You'd better.  I don't allow no man to doubt my word, nor no boy, either.  Have you got a quarter about you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Nor a dime?  A dime'll do.\"  \"I have no money to spare.\"  \"I'd pay yer to-morrer.\"  \"You'll have to borrow elsewhere; I am working in a store for a very smell salary, and that I pay over to my mother.\"  \"Whose store?\"  \"Simon Crawford's; but you won't know any better for my telling you that, unless you are acquainted in Pentonville\"  \"I've been through there.  Crawford keeps the grocery store.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What's your name?\"  \"Ben Barclay,\" answered our hero, feeling rather annoyed at what he considered intrusive curiosity.  \"Barclay?\" replied the tramp quickly.  \"Not John Barclay's son?\"  It was Ben's turn to be surprised.  He was the son of John Barclay, deceased, but how could his ill-favored traveling companion know that?  \"Did you know my father?\" asked the boy, astonished.  \"I've heerd his name,\" answered the tramp, in an evasive tone.  \"What is your name?\" asked Ben, feeling that be had a right to be as curious as his companion.  \"I haven't got any visitin' cards with me,\" answered the tramp dryly.  \"Nor I; but I told you my name.\"  \"All right; I'll tell you mine.  You can call me Jack Frost.\"  \"I gave you my real name,\" said Ben significantly.  \"I've almost forgotten what my real name is,\" said the tramp.  \"If you don't like Jack Frost, you can call me George Washington.\"  Ben laughed.  \"I don't think that name would suit, he said.  George Washington never told a lie.\"  \"What d'ye mean by that?\" demanded the tramp, his brow darkening.  \"I was joking,\" answered Ben, who did not care to get into difficulty with such a man.  \"I'm going to joke a little myself,\" growled the tramp, as, looking quickly about him, he observed that they were riding over a lonely section of the road lined with woods.  \"Have you got any money about you?\"  Ben, taken by surprise, would have been glad to answer \"No,\" but he was a boy of truth, and could not say so truly, though he might have felt justified in doing so under the circumstances.  \"Come, I see you have.  Give it to me right off or it'll be worse for you.\"  Now it happened that Ben had not less than twenty-five dollars about him.  He had carried some groceries to a remote part of the town, and collected two bills on the way.  All this money he had in a wallet in the pocket on the other side from the tramp.  But the money was not his; it belonged to his employer, and he was not disposed to give it up without a struggle; though he knew that in point of strength he was not an equal match for the man beside him.  \"You will get no money from me,\" he answered in a firm tone, though be felt far from comfortable.  \"I won't, hey!\" growled the tramp.  \"D'ye think I'm goin' to let a boy like you get the best of me?\"  He clutched Ben by the arm, and seemed in a fair way to overcome opposition by superior strength, when a fortunate idea struck Ben.  In his vest pocket was a silver dollar, which had been taken at the store, but proving to be counterfeit, had been given to Ben by Mr. Crawford as a curiosity.  This Ben extracted from his pocket, and flung out by the roadside.  \"If you want it, you'll have to get out and get it,\" he said.  The tramp saw the coin glistening upon the ground, and had no suspicion of its not being genuine.  It was not much--only a dollar--but he was \"dead broke,\" and it was worth picking up.  He had not expected that Ben had much, and so was not disappointed.  \"Curse you!\" he said, relinquishing his hold upon Ben.  \"Why couldn't you give it to me instead of throwing it out there?\"  \"Because,\" answered Ben boldly, \"I didn't want you to have it.\"  \"Get out and get it for me!\"  \"I won't!\" answered Ben firmly.  \"Then stop the horse and give me a chance to get out.\"  \"I'll do that.\"  Ben brought the horse to a halt, and his unwelcome passenger descended, much to his relief.  He had to walk around the wagon to get at the coin.  Our hero brought down the whip with emphasis on the horse's back and the animal dashed off at a good rate of speed.  \"Stop!\" exclaimed the tramp, but Ben had no mind to heed his call.  \"No, my friend, you don't get another chance to ride with me,\" he said to himself.  The tramp picked up the coin, and his practiced eye detected that it was bogus.  \"The young villain!\" he muttered angrily.  \"I'd like to wring his neck.  It's a bad one after all.\" He looked after the receding team and was half disposed to follow, but he changed his mind, reflecting, \"I can pass it anyhow.\"  Instead of pursuing his journey, he made his way into the woods, and, stretching himself out among the underbrush, went to sleep.  Half a mile before reaching the store, Ben overtook Rose Gardiner, who had the reputation of being the prettiest girl in Pendleton--at any rate, such was Ben's opinion.  She looked up and smiled pleasantly at Ben as he took off his hat.  \"Shall you attend Prof. Harrington's entertainment at the Town Hall this evening, Ben?\" she asked, after they had interchanged greetings.  \"I should like to go,\" answered Ben, \"but I am afraid I can't be spared from the store.  Shall you go?\"  \"I wouldn't miss it for anything.  I hope I shall see you there.\"  \"I shall want to go all the more then.\" answered Ben gallantly.  \"You say that to flatter me,\" said the young lady, with an arch smile.  \"No, I don't,\" said Ben earnestly.  \"Won't you get in and ride as far as the store?\"  \"Would it be proper?\" asked Miss Rose demurely.  \"Of course it would.\"  \"Then I'll venture.\"  Ben jumped from the wagon, assisted the young lady in, and the two drove into the village together.  He liked his second passenger considerably better than the first.     CHAPTER II BEN AND HIS MOTHER   Ben Barclay, after taking leave of the tramp, lost no time in driving to the grocery store where he was employed.  It was a large country store, devoted not to groceries alone, but supplies of dry-goods, boots and shoes, and the leading articles required in the community. There were two other clerks besides Ben, one the son, another the nephew, of Simon Crawford, the proprietor.  \"Did you collect any money, Ben?\" asked Simon, who chanced to be standing at the door when our hero drove up.  \"Yes, sir; I collected twenty-five dollars, but came near losing it on the way home.\"  \"How was that?  I hope you were not careless.\"  \"No, except in taking a stranger as a passenger.  When we got to that piece of woods a mile back, he asked me for all the money I had.\"  \"A highwayman, and so near Pentonville!\" ejaculated Simon Crawford. \"What was he like?\"  \"A regular tramp.\"  \"Yet you say you have the money.  How did you manage to keep it from him?\"  Ben detailed the stratagem of which he made use.  \"You did well,\" said the storekeeper approvingly.  \"I must give you a dollar for the one you sacrificed.\"  \"But sir, it was bad money.  I couldn't have passed it.\"  \"That does not matter.  You are entitled to some reward for the courage and quick wit you displayed.  Here is a dollar, and--let me see, there is an entertainment at the Town Hall this evening, isn't there?\"  \"Yes, sir.  Prof. Harrington, the magician, gives an entertainment,\" said Ben eagerly.  \"At what time does it commence?\"  \"At eight o'clock.\"  \"You may leave the store at half-past seven.  That will give you enough time to get there.\"  \"Thank you, sir.  I wanted to go to the entertainment, but did not like to ask for the evening.\"  \"You have earned it.  Here is the dollar,\" and Mr. Crawford handed the money to his young clerk, who received it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10724"],["title","The Store Boy (#1)"],["body","gratefully.  A magical entertainment may be a very common affair to my young readers in the city, but in a country village it is an event. Pentonville was too small to have any regular place of amusement, and its citizens were obliged to depend upon traveling performers, who, from time to time, engaged the Town Hall.  Some time had elapsed since there had been any such entertainment, and Prof. Harrington was the more likely to be well patronized.  Ben, who had the love of amusement common to boys of his age, had been regretting the necessity of remaining in the store till nine o'clock, and therefore losing his share of amusement when, as we have seen, an opportunity suddenly offered.  \"I am glad I met the tramp, after all,\" he said to himself.  \"He has brought me luck.\"  At supper he told is mother what had befallen him, but she tool a more serious view of it than he did.  \"He might have murdered you, Ben,\" she said with a shudder.  \"Oh, no; he wouldn't do that.  He might have stolen Mr. Crawford's money; that was the most that was likely to happen.\"  \"I didn't think there were highwaymen about here.  Now I shall be worrying about you.\"  \"Don't do that mother; I don't feel in any danger.  Still, if you think it best, I will carry a pistol.\"  \"No, no, Ben!  it might go off and kill you.  I would rather run the risk of a highwayman.  I wonder if the man is prowling about in the neighborhood yet?\"  \"I don't think my bogus dollar will carry him very far.  By the way, mother, I must tell yon one strange thing.  He asked me if I was John Barclay's son.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Mrs. Barclay, in a tone of great surprise.  \"Did he know your name was Barclay?\"  \"Not till I told him.  Then it was he asked if I was the son of John Barclay.\"  \"Did he say he knew your father?\"  \"I asked him, but he answered evasively.\"  \"He might have seen some resemblance--that is, if he had ever met your father.  Ah!  it was a sad day for us all when your poor father died. We should have been in a very different position,\" the widow sighed.  \"Yes, mother,\" said Ben; \"but when I get older I will try to supply my father's place, and relieve you from care and trouble.\"  \"You are doing that in a measure now, my dear boy,\" said Mrs. Barclay affectionately.  \"You are a great comfort to me.\"  Ben's answer was to go up to his mother and kiss her.  Some boys of his age are ashamed to show their love for the mother who is devoted to them, but it a false shame, that does them no credit.  \"Still, mother, you work too hard,\" said Ben.  \"Wait till I am a man, and you shall not need to work at all.\"  Mrs. Barclay had been a widow for five years.  Her husband had been a commercial traveler, but had contracted a fever at Chicago, and died after a brief illness, without his wife having the satisfaction of ministering to him in his last days.  A small sum due him from his employers was paid over to his family, but no property was discovered, though his wife had been under the impression that her husband possessed some.  He had never been in the habit of confiding his business affairs to her, and so, if he had investments of any kind, she could not learn anything about them.  She found herself, therefore, with no property except a small cottage, worth, with its quarter acre of land, perhaps fifteen hundred dollars.  As Ben was too small to earn anything, she had been compelled to raise about seven hundred dollars on mortgage, which by this time had been expended for living.  Now, Ben was earning four dollars a week, and, with her own earnings, she was able to make both ends meet without further encroachments upon her scanty property; but the mortgage was a source of anxiety to her, especially as it was held by Squire Davenport, a lawyer of considerable means, who was not overscrupulous about the methods by which he strove to increase his hoards.  Should he at any time take it into his head to foreclose, there was no one to whom Mrs. Barclay could apply to assume the mortgage, and she was likely to be compelled to sacrifice her home.  He had more than once hinted that he might need the money but as yet had gone no further.  Mrs. Barclay had one comfort, however, and a great one.  This was a good son.  Ben was always kind to his mother--a bright, popular, promising boy--and though at present he was unable to earn much, in a few years he would be able to earn a good income, and then his mother knew that she would be well provided for.  So she did not allow herself to borrow trouble but looked forward hopefully, thanking God for what He had given her.  \"Won't you go up to the Town Hall with me, mother?\" asked Ben.  I am sure you would enjoy it.\"  \"Thank you, Ben, for wishing me to have a share in your amusements,\" his mother replied, \"but I have a little headache this evening, and I shall be better off at home.\"  \"It isn't on account of the expense you decline, mother, is it?  You know Mr. Crawford gave me a dollar, and the tickets are but twenty-five cents.\"  \"No, it isn't that, Ben.  If it were a concert I might be tempted to go in spite of my headache, but a magical entertainment would not amuse me as much as it will you.\"  \"Just as you think best, mother; but I should like to have you go. You won't feel lonely, will you?\"  \"I am used to being alone till nine o'clock, when you are at the store.\"  This conversation took place at the supper table.  Ben went directly from the store to the Town Hall, where he enjoyed himself as much as he anticipated.  If he could have foreseen how his mother was to pass that evening, it would have destroyed all is enjoyment.     CHAPTER III MRS. BARCLAY'S CALLERS   About half-past eight o'clock Mrs. Barclay sat with her work in her hand.  Her headache was better, but she did not regret not having accompanied Ben to the Town Hall.  \"I am glad Ben is enjoying himself,\" she thought, \"but I would rather stay quietly at home.  Poor boy!  he works hard enough, and needs recreation now and then.\"  Just then a knock was heard at the outside door.  \"I wonder who it can be?\" thought the widow.  \"I supposed everybody would be at the Town Hall.  It may be Mrs. Perkins come to borrow something.\"  Mrs. Perkins was a neighbor much addicted to borrowing, which was rather disagreeable, but might have been more easily tolerated but that she seldom returned the articles lent.  Mrs. Barclay went to the door and opened it, fully expecting to see her borrowing neighbor.  A very different person met her view.  The ragged hat, the ill-looking face, the neglected attire, led her to recognize the tramp whom Ben had described to her as having attempted to rob him in the afternoon.  Terrified, Mrs. Barclay's first impulse was to shut the door and bolt it.  But her unwelcome visitor was too quick for her.  Thrusting his foot into the doorway, he interposed an effectual obstacle in the way of shutting the door.  \"No, you don't, ma'am!\" he said, with as laugh.  \"I understand your little game.  You want to shut me out.\"  \"What do you want?\" asked the widow apprehensively.  \"What do I want?\" returned the tramp.  \"Well, to begin with, I want something to eat--and drink,\" he added, after a pause.  \"Why don't you go to the tavern?\" asked Mrs. Barclay, anxious for him to depart.  \"Well, I can't afford it.  All the money I've got is a bogus dollar your rogue of a son gave me this afternoon.\"  \"You stole it from him,\" said the widow indignantly.  \"What's the odds if I did.  It ain't of no value.  Come, haven't you anything to eat in the house?  I'm hungry as a wolf.\"  \"And you look like one!\" thought Mrs. Barclay, glancing at his unattractive features; but she did not dare to say it.  There seemed no way of refusing, and she was glad to comply with his request, if by so doing she could soon get rid of him.  \"Stay here,\" she said, \"and I'll bring you some bread and butter and cold meat.\"  \"Thank you, I'd rather come in,\" said the tramp, and he pushed his way through the partly open door.  She led the way uneasily into the kitchen just in the rear of the sitting room where she had been seated.  \"I wish Ben was here,\" she said to herself, with sinking heart.  The tramp seated himself at the kitchen table, while Mrs. Barclay, going to the pantry, brought out part of a loaf of bread, and butter, and a few slices of cold beef, which she set before him.  Without ceremony he attacked the viands and ate as if half famished.  When about half through, he turned to the widow, and asked:  \"Haven't you some whisky in the house?\"  \"I never keep any,\" answered Mrs. Barclay.  \"Rum or gin, then?\"  I ain't partic'lar.  I want something to warm me up.\"  \"I keep no liquor of any kind.  I don't approve of drink, or want Ben to touch it.\"  \"Oh, you belong to the cold water army, do you?\" said the tramp with a sneer.  \"Give me some coffee, then.\"  \"I have no fire, and cannot prepare any.\"  \"What have you got, then?\" demanded than unwelcome guest impatiently.  \"I can give you a glass of excellent well water.\"  \"[illegible] Do you want to choke me?\" returned the tramp in disgust.  \"Suppose I mix you some molasses and water,\" suggested the widow, anxious to propitiate her dangerous guest.  \"Humph!  Well, that will do, if you've got nothing better.  Be quick about it, for my throat is parched.\"  As soon as possible the drink was prepared and set beside his plate. He drained it at a draught, and called for a second glass, which was supplied him.  Presently, for all things must have an end, the tramp's appetite seemed to be satisfied.  He threw himself back in his chair, stretched his legs, and, with his hands in his pockets, fixed his eyes on the widow.  \"I feel better,\" he said.  \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"Now, if you'll be kind enough, leave the house, for I expect Ben back before long.\"  \"And you don't want him to get hurt,\" laughed the tramp.  \"Well, I do owe him a flogging for a trick he played on me.\"  \"Oh, pray, go away!\" said Mrs. Barclay, apprehensively.  \"I have given"]]]
