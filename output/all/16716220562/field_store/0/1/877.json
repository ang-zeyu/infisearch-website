A lad who tries hard can do nearly anything.\"  \"Can he?\" said Robin.  \"To be sure he can; so you try, and when you can hit anything you shoot at you'll be half a man.  And when you've done growing you'll be one quite.\"  \"Shall I ever be as big as you?\" asked Robin.  \"I hope not,\" said Little John, laughing.  \"I'm too big.\"  \"Are you?\" said Robin.  \"I should like to be as big as you.\"  \"No, no, don't,\" cried Little John. \"You go on growing till you're a six-footer, and then you stop.  All that grows after that's waste o' good stuff, and gets in your way.  Big uns like me are always knocking their heads against something.\"  \"But how am I to know when I'm six feet high?\" said Robin.  \"Oh! I'll tell you, I'll keep measuring you, my lad.\"  \"And how am I to stop growing?\"  Little John took off his cap and scratched his head, as he wrinkled up his big, good-humored face.  \"Well, I don't quite know,\" he said; \"but there's plenty o' time yet, and we shall see.  Might put a big stone in your hat; or keep you in a very dry place; or tie your shoulders down to your waist--no, that wouldn't do.\"  \"Why?\" said Robin promptly.  \"Because it wouldn't stop your legs growing, and it's boys' legs that grow the most when they're young.  I say, though, what's become of all those arrows I made you?\"  \"Shot them away.\"  \"And only two left.  You mustn't waste arrows like that.  Why didn't you look for them after you shot?\"  \"I did,\" cried Robin, \"but they will hide themselves so.  They creep right under the grass and among the weeds so that you can't find them again.  But you'll make me some more, won't you?\"  \"Well,\" said Little John, \"I suppose I must; but you will have to be more careful, young un.  I can't spend all my time making new arrows for you.  But there, I want you to shoot so that the captain will be proud of you, and some day you'll have to shoot a deer.\"  \"I don't think I should like to shoot a deer,\" said the boy, shaking his head.  \"Why not?\"  They're good to eat.\"  \"They look so nice and kind, with their big soft eyes.\"  \"Well, a man then.\"  \"Oh, no!  I shouldn't like to shoot a man.\"  \"What not one of the captain's enemies who had come to kill him?\"  \"I don't think I should mind so much then.  Look here, Little John, I'd shoot an arrow into his back, to prick him and make him run away.\"  \"And so you shall, my lad,\" cried Little John, and he set to work directly to cut some wood for arrows to refill the boy's quiver; and when those were lost, he made some more, for young Robin was always shooting and losing them; but Little John said it did not matter, for he was going to be a famous marksman, and the big fellow looked as proud of his pupil as could be.  But Little John did not stop at teaching young Robin to shoot, for one day the boy found him smoothing and scraping a nice new piece of ash as thick as his little finger, which was not little at all.  \"You don't know what this is for,\" said the big fellow.  \"It looks like a little quarter-staff,\" said young Robin, \"like all the men have.\"  \"Well done.  Guessed it first time. Now guess who it is for?\"  \"Me,\" said the boy promptly.  And so it was, and what was more, Little John, in the days which followed, taught him how to handle it so as to give blows and guard himself, till the little fellow became as clever and active as could be, making the men roar with laughter when in a bout he managed to strike so quickly that his staff struck leg or arm before his opponent could guard.  \"Why, you're getting quite a forester, Robin,\" said the captain, smiling, \"and what with your skill with bow and quarter-staff you'll soon be able to hold your own.\"  Robin Hood's words were put to the proof in autumn, for one day when the acorns had swollen to such a size that they could no longer sit in their cups, and came rattling down from the sunny side of the great oak-trees, young Robin was having a glorious ramble.  He had filled his satchel with brown hazel nuts, had a good feast of blackberries, and stained his fingers.  He had had a long talk to a tame fawn which knew him and came when he whistled, and tempted a couple of squirrels down with some very brown nuts, laying them upon the bark of a fallen tree, and then drawing back a few yards, with the result that the bushy-tailed little animals crept softly down, nearer and nearer, ending by making a rush, seizing the nuts, and darting back to the security of a high branch of a tree.  \"I shouldn't hurt you,\" said Robin, as he stood leaning upon his little quarter-staff, watching them nibble away the ends of the nuts to get at the sweet kernel.  \"If I wanted to I could unsling my bow, string it, and bring you down with an arrow; but I don't want to.  Why can't you both be as tame as my fawn?\"  The squirrels made no answer, but went on nibbling the nuts, and suddenly darted up higher in the tree, while Robin grew so much interested in the movements of the active little creatures that he heard no sound behind him, nor did he awaken to the fact that he was being stalked by some one creeping bare-footed from tree to tree to get within springing distance, till all at once he felt the whole weight of something alighting on his back and driving him forward so that he dropped his quarter-staff and came down on hands and knees.  \"Got yer, have I, at last?\" cried a familiar voice, as he felt his ribs nipped, his assailant having seated himself on his back. \"Didn't I tell yer I'd wait, and you was to bring me back a lot to eat?\"  Young Robin waited for no more, but in his agony of spirit he gave himself a wrench sidewise, dislodging his rider, and made an effort to struggle up again.  But his old enemy held fast, and after a sharp struggle Robin stood panting, face to face with the young swineherd, who had him tightly by the doublet with both hands.  \"You let go,\" cried young Robin fiercely.  \"You'll tear my coat.\"  \"I means to tear it right off dreckly,\" said the boy, grinning.  \"I want a noo un again, and it'll just do.  I'm a-going to have them bow and arrows too, and the knife and cap, I'll let you see!  Going and hiding away all this time, when I told yer to come back!\"  \"You let me go,\" panted Robin, looking vainly round for help.  \"Nay, there aren't no one a-nigh, and I've got yer fast.  Why didn't yer come back as I told you?\"  \"I didn't want to,\" said Robin angrily.  \"You let me go.  I'll call Little John to you.\"  \"Call him, and I'll knock his ugly old eye out,\" cried the boy.  \"I don't care for no Little Johns.  I've got you now, and I'm going to pay you for not coming back before.  And I know,\" he snarled, \"you're a thief; that's what you are.\"  \"I'm not,\" cried Robin fiercely, and he made a desperate struggle to get away to where his little quarter-staff lay half hidden amongst the bracken.  \"You let me go.\" But his efforts to get free were vain.  \"Yes, I'll let you go, p'raps, when I've done with you and got all I wants,\" said the boy, in a husky, satisfied tone, as he seemed to gloat over his victim.  \"No, I won't; you're a thief, and a deer-stealer, and I shall just take yer to one of the King's keepers.\"  Young Robin set his teeth and made another struggle, but quite in vain, for he was no match in strength for his adversary.  \"What!  Hold still!  Wo ho, kicker!  Quiet, will yer!\" snarled the boy.  \"If yer don't leave off I'll drag yer through all the worst brambles and pitch yer to my tigs.  D'yer hear?\" he shouted.  Robin paused breathlessly, and stood gazing wildly at his enemy.  \"Yer thought I was giving yer up, did yer, but I wasn't.  I've been watching for yer ever since yer run away.  I knowed I should ketch yer some day.  Errrr! yer young thief!\"  He tightened his grip of Robin's shoulders, grinned at him like an angry dog, and gave him a fierce shake, while his victim breathed hard as he pressed his teeth together, and there was the look in his eyes as if he were some newly captured wild creature seeking a way to escape.  \"Kerm along,\" snarled the young swineherd.  \"I dropped my staff just back here, and as soon as I gets it, I'm going to stand over yer while yer strips off all them things; and if yer tries to get away I'll break yer legs, and yer can't run then.\"  Robin drew a breath which sounded like a deep sigh, and ceased his struggling, letting his enemy force him to walk backward among the bracken and nearly fall again and again, till all at once the savage young lout shouted:  \"Ah, here it is'\" and loosening one hand, he was in the act of stooping to pick up the staff he had dropped in leaping upon his victim, who now made a bound which sent the boy face downward on to his staff, while Robin dashed off to where his own quarter-staff lay among the bracken--a spot he had glanced at again and again.  He seized it in an instant, and was about to bound away among the trees, but his enemy had recovered himself, and staff in hand, came after him at so terrible a rate that Robin only avoided a swishing blow at his legs by dodging round a tree, which received the stroke.  The next moment Robin faced round in the open beyond the tree, and stood on guard as he had been taught.  \"Ah, would yer?\" snarled the young swineherd; \"take that then.\"  Whisk went the staff and then crack as it was received by Robin across his own, and then, profiting by Little John's lessons, he brought his own over from the left and delivered a sounding blow on his assailant's head.  The swineherd uttered a savage yell as he staggered back, but came fiercely on again, striking with all his might, but so wildly that Robin easily avoided the blow, and brought his own staff down whack, crash, on his enemy's shoulders, producing a couple more yells of pain.  From that moment Robin had it all his own way, for he easily guarded himself from the swineherd's fierce strokes and retorted with swinging blows on first one arm, then on the other. Then he brought his staff down with a blow beside his enemy's left"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11097"],["title","Young Robin Hood (#6)"],["body","eg, then half behind the right, making him dance and limp as he yelled and sought in vain to beat down his active little adversary, who delivered a shower of cleverly directed blows in response to the wild swoops given with the worst of aim.  In the heat and excitement Robin had felt no fear. He was on his mettle, and fighting for liberty, to gain which he felt that he must effectually beat his enemy; and thanks to Little John's lessons he thrashed him so well that at the end of five minutes the young swine-herd received a final stroke across the knuckles which made him shriek, drop his staff, and turn to run down a long straight avenue in the forest where the ground was open.  Robin in his excitement began to run after him to continue the beating, but the swineherd went too fast, and on the impulse of the moment the victor stopped short, dropping his own staff and unslinging his bow from where it hung.  In less time than it takes to tell the bow was strung and an arrow fitted, drawn to the head, and with a twang it was loosed after the flying lad, now a hundred yards away; but as soon as it was shot Robin repented.  \"It'll kill him,\" he thought, and his heart seemed to stand still.  For the boy's teacher had taught well, and here was the proof. Truly as if a long careful aim had been taken the arrow sped many times faster than the swineherd ran, and Robin's eyes dilated as he saw his adversary give a sudden spring and fall upon his face, uttering a hideous yell.  Robin, full of repentance, started off to his enemy's help, but before he had gone many yards the swineherd sprang up and began to run faster than ever, while when Robin reached the spot there lay his arrow, but the lad was gone.  \"Only pricked him a bit,\" said Little John, when he heard of the adventure.  \"Serve the young wretch right.  But the quarter-staff. My word, big un, I'd have given something to have been there to hear his bones rattle.  Well, I didn't teach you for naught.  But look here, if you meet that fellow in the forest again don't you wait for him to begin; you go at him at once.\"  Robin nodded his head, but he never saw the swineherd again.     CHAPTER VII  Young Robin's father, the Sheriff, suffered very sadly from the loss of his son and his goods, and Robin's aunt came to Nottingham and wept bitterly over the loss of the little boy she loved dearly. For David, the old servant in whose charge Robin had been placed when he was going home, had done what too many weak people do, tried to hide one fault by committing another.  Robin was given into his charge to protect and take safely home to his father, and when the attack was made by the outlaw's men, instead of doing anything to protect the little fellow and save him from being injured by Robin Hood's people, he thought only of himself.  He threw his charge into the first bushes he came to, and galloped away, hardly stopping till he reached Nottingham town.  There the first question the Sheriff asked was, not what had become of the pack mules and the consignment of cloth, but where was Robin, and the false servant said that he had fought hard to save him in the fight, but fought in vain, and that the poor boy was dead.  And then months passed and a year had gone by, and people looked solemn and said that it seemed as if the Sheriff would never hold up his head again.  But they thought that he should have gathered together a number of fighting men and gone and punished Robin Hood and his outlaws for carrying off that valuable set of loads of cloth.  But Robin's father cared nothing for the cloth or the mules; he could only think of the bright happy little fellow whom he loved so well, and whom he wept for in secret at night when there was no one near to see.  Robin's aunt when she came and tried to comfort him used to shake her head and wipe her eyes.  She said little, only thought a great deal, and she came over again and again to try and comfort her dead sister's husband; but it made no difference, for the Sheriff was a sadly altered man.  Then all at once there was a change, and it was at a time when Robin's aunt was over to Nottingham.  For one day a man came to the Sheriff's house and wanted him.  But the Sheriff would not see him, for he took no interest in anything now, and told his servant that the man must send word what his business was.  The servant went out, and came back directly.  \"He says, sir, that he was taken prisoner by Robin Hood's men a week ago, and that he has just come from the camp under the greenwood tree, and has brought you news, master.\"  The Sheriff started up, trembling, and told his servant to bring the strange man in.  It was no beaten and wounded ruffian, but a hale and hearty fellow, who looked bright and happy, and before he could speak and tell his news the Sheriff began to question him.  \"You have come from the outlaws' camp?\" he said with his voice trembling.  \"Yes, Master Sheriff.\"  \"They took you prisoner, and beat and robbed you?\"  \"Oh! no, Master Sheriff; they took me before Robin Hood, and he asked me what I was doing there, and whether I was not afraid to cross his forest, and I up and told him plainly that I wasn't. Then he said how was that when I must have heard what a terrible robber he was.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" cried the Sheriff, \"and what did you say.\"  \"I said that I had lived about these parts all my life and I never heard that he did a poor man any harm. Then he laughed, and all his people laughed too, and he said I was a merry fellow.  'Give him plenty to eat and drink,' he said, 'for two or three days, and then send him on his way.'  Yes, Master Sheriff, that he did, and a fine jolly time I had.  Why, I almost felt as if I should like to stay altogether.\"  And all this time the Sheriff was watching the man very keenly, and suddenly he caught him by the arm.  [Illustration: The Sheriff was watching the man very keenly, and suddenly caught him by the arm.]  \"Speak out,\" he said; \"you did not come to tell me only that.  What is it you are keeping back?  Why don't you speak?\"  \"Because, master,\" said the man softly, \"I was afraid you couldn't bear it, for I was a father once and my son died, and though you never knew me, I knew you, and was sorry when the news came that your little boy was killed.  Can you bear to hear good news as well as bad?\"  The Sheriff was silent for a few minutes, during which he closed his eyes and his lips moved, and he looked so strange that Robin's aunt crossed the room to where he sat, and took hold of his hand, as she whispered loving words.  \"Yes, yes,\" he said softly, \"I can bear it now.  Speak, pray speak, and tell me all.\"  \"But you will not be angry with me if I am wrong, Master Sheriff?\"  \"No, no,\" said Robin's father; \"speak out at once.\"  \"Well, Master Sheriff, no one would tell me when I asked questions, but there's a little fellow there, dressed all in Lincoln green, like one of Robin Hood's fighting men, with his sword and bugle, and bow and arrows, and somehow I began to think, and then I began to ask, whether he was Robin Hood's son; but those I asked only shook their heads.  \"That made me think all the more, and one day I managed to follow him but among the trees to where I found him feeding one of the wild deer, which followed him about like a dog.\"  \"I waited a bit, and then stepped out to him, and what do you think he did?  He strung his bow, fitted an arrow to it before I knew where I was, and drew it to the head as if he was going to shoot me.  'Do you know where Nottingham is?' I said, and he lowered his bow.  'Yes,' he said, 'of course.  Do you know my father?'  'Do I know the Sheriff?' I said; 'of course.'  'Are you going there soon?' he cried, and I nodded.  'Then you go to my father,' he cried, 'and tell him to tell aunt that I'm quite well, and that some day I'm coming home.\"  The man stopped, for just then the Sheriff closed his eyes again and said something very softly, which Robin's aunt heard, and she sank upon her knees and covered her face with her hands.  Then the Sheriff sprang to his feet, looking quite a different man.  \"Here,\" he said to the bringer of the news, and he gave him some gold pieces.  \"Could you find your way back to the outlaws' camp in the forest?\"  \"Oh! yes, Master Sheriff, that I could, though they did bind a cloth over my face when they brought me away.\"  \"And you could lead me and a strong body of fighting men right to the outlaws' camp?\"  \"I could, Master Sheriff,\" said the man, beginning slowly to lay the gold pieces back one by one upon the table; \"but I can't do evil for good.\"  \"What?\" cried the Sheriff angrily.  \"They are robbers and outlaws, and every subject of the King has a right to slay them.\"  \"May be, Master Sheriff,\" said the man drily; \"but I'm not going to fly at the throat of one who did nothing but good to me.  They tell me that Robin Hood's a noble earl who offended the King, and had to fly for his life.  What I say is, he's a noble kind-hearted gentleman, and if it was my boy he had there, looking as happy as the day is long, I'd go to him without any fighting men.\"  \"How, then?\" cried the Sheriff.  \"Just like a father should, master, and ask him for my boy like a man.\"  \"That will do,\" said the Sheriff.  \"You can go.\"  The man turned to leave the room, when the Sheriff said sharply:  \"Stop!  You are leaving the gold pieces I gave you.\"  \"Yes, I can't take pay to lead anyone to fight against Robin Hood and his men.\"  \"Those pieces were for the news you brought me,\" said the Sheriff. \"Yes, take them, for you have behaved like an honest man.\"  But the Sheriff did not take the man's advice, neither did he listen to the appeal of young Robin's aunt.  For, as Sheriff of Nottingham, he said to himself that it was his duty to destroy or scatter the band of outlaws who had lived in Sherwood Forest for so long a time.  So he gathered a strong body of crossbow-men, and others with spears and swords, besides asking for the help of two gallant"]]]
