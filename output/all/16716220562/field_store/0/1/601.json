What business can you have with me?\"  \"More than you think.  You are the widow of John Barclay, ain't you?\"  \"Yes; did you know my husband?\"  \"Yes; that is, I saw something of him just before he died.\"  \"Can you tell me anything about his last moments?\" asked the widow, forgetting the character of her visitor, and only thinking of her husband.  \"No, that isn't in my line.  I ain't a doctor nor yet a minister.  I say, did he leave any money?\"  \"Not that we have been able to find out.  He owned this hone, but left no other property.\"  \"That you know of,\" said the tramp, significantly.  \"Do you know of any?\" asked Mrs. Barclay eagerly.  \"How did you happen to know him?\"  \"I was the barkeeper in the hotel where he died.  It was a small house, not one of your first-class hotels.\"  \"My husband was always careful of his expenses.  He did not spend money unnecessarily.  With his prudence we all thought he must have some investments, but we could discover none.\"  \"Have you got any money in the house?\" asked the tramp, with seeming abruptness.  \"Why do you ask?\" returned the widow, alarmed.  \"Surely, you would not rob me?\"  \"No, I don't want to rob you.  I want to sell you something.\"  \"I don't care to buy.  It takes all our money for necessary expenses.\"  \"You don't ask what I have to sell.\"  \"No, because I cannot buy it, whatever it may be.\"  \"It is--a secret,\" said the tramp.  \"A secret!\" repeated Mrs. Barclay, bewildered.  \"Yes, and a secret worth buying.  Your husband wasn't so poor as you think.  He left stock and papers representing three thousand dollars, and I am the only man who can put you in the way of getting it.\"  Mrs. Barclay was about to express her surprise, when a loud knock was head at the outer door.  \"Who's that?\" demanded the tramp quickly.  \"Is it the boy?\"  \"No, he would not knock.\"  \"Then, let me get out of this,\" he said, leaping to his feet.  \"Isn't there a back door?\"  \"Yes, there it is.\"  He hurried to the door, unbolted it, and made his escape into the open beyond the house, just as the knock was repeated.  Confused by what she had heard, and the strange conduct of her visitor, the widow took the lamp and went to the door.  To her surprise she found on opening it, two visitors, in one of whom she recognized Squire Davenport, already referred to as holding a mortgage on her house.  The other was a short, dark-complexioned man, who looked like a mechanic.  \"Excuse me the lateness of my call, Mrs. Barclay,\" said the squire smoothly.  \"I come on important business.  This is Mr. Kirk, a cousin of my wife.\"  \"Walk in, gentlemen,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"This is night of surprises,\" she thought to herself.     CHAPTER IV UNPLEASANT BUSINESS   It was now nine o'clock, rather a late hour for callers in the country, and Mrs. Barclay waited not without curiosity to hear the nature of the business which had brought her two visitors at that time.  \"Take seats, gentlemen,\" she said, with the courtesy habitual to her.  Squire Davenport, who was disposed to consider that he had a right to the best of everything, seated himself in the rocking-chair, and signed his companion to a cane chair beside him.  \"Mr. Kirk,\" he commenced, \"is thinking of coming to Pentonville to live.\"  \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mrs. Barclay politely.  Perhaps she would not have said this if she had known what was coming next.  \"He is a carpenter,\" continued the squire, \"and, as we have none in the village except old Mr. Wade, who is superannuated, I think he will find enough to do to keep him busy.\"  \"I should think so,\" assented the widow.  \"If he does not, I can employ him a part of the time on my land.\"  \"What has all this to do with me?\" thought Mrs. Barclay.  She soon learned.  \"Of course he will need a house,\" pursued the squire, \"and as his family is small, he thinks this house will just suit him.\"  \"But I don't wish to sell,\" said the widow hurriedly.  \"I need this house for Ben and myself.\"  \"You could doubtless find other accommodations.  I dare say you could hire a couple of rooms from Elnathan Perkins.\"  \"I wouldn't live in that old shell,\" said Mrs. Barclay rather indignantly, \"and I am sure Ben wouldn't.\"  \"I apprehend Benjamin will have no voice in the matter,\" said Squire Davenport stiffly.  \"He is only a boy.\"  \"He is my main support, and my main adviser,\" said Mrs. Barclay, with spirit, \"and I shall not take any step which is disagreeable to him.\"  Mr. Kirk looked disappointed, but the squire gave him an assuring look, as the widow could see.  \"Perhaps you may change your mind,\" said the squire significantly.  \"I am under the impression that I hold a mortgage on this property.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" assented Mrs. Barclay apprehensively.  \"For the sum of seven hundred dollars, if I am not mistaken.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I shall have need of this money for other purposes, and will trouble you to take it up.\"  \"I was to have three months' notice,\" said the widow, with a troubled look.  \"I will give you three months' notice to-night,\" said the squire.  \"I don't know where to raise the money,\" faltered Mrs. Barclay.  \"Then you had better sell to my friend here.  He will assume the mortgage and pay you three hundred dollars.\"  \"But that will be only a thousand dollars for the place.\"  \"A very fair price, in my opinion, Mrs. Barclay.\"  \"I have always considered it worth fifteen hundred dollars,\" said the widow, very much disturbed.  \"A fancy price, my dear madam; quite an absurd price, I assure you. What do you say, Kirk?\"  \"I quite agree with you, squire,\" said Kirk, in a strong, nasal tone. \"But then, women don't know anything of business.\"  \"I know that you and your cousin are trying to take advantage of my poverty,\" said Mrs. Barclay bitterly.  \"If you are a carpenter, why don't you build a house for yourself, instead of trying to deprive me of mine?\"  \"That's my business,\" said Kirk rudely.  \"Mr. Kirk cannot spare the time to build at present,\" said the squire.  \"Then why doesn't he hire rooms from Elnathan Perkins, as you just recommended to me?\"  \"They wouldn't suit him,\" said the squire curtly.  \"He has set his mind on this house.\"  \"Squire Davenport,\" said Mrs. Barclay, in a softened voice, \"I am sure you cannot understand what you ask of me when you seek to take my home and turn me adrift.  Here I lived with my poor husband; here my boy was born.  During my married life I have had no other home.  It is a humble dwelling, but it has associations and charms for me which it can never have for no one else.  Let Mr. Kirk see some other house and leave me undisturbed in mine.\"  \"Humph!\" said the squire, shrugging his shoulders; \"you look upon the matter from a sentimental point of view.  That is unwise.  It is simply a matter of business.  You speak of the house as yours.  In reality, it is more mine than yours, for I have a major interest in it.  Think over my proposal coolly, and you will see that you are unreasonable.  Mr. Kirk may be induced to give you a little more--say three hundred and fifty dollars--over and above the mortgage, which, as I said before, he is willing assume.\"  \"How does it happen that you are willing to let the mortgage remain, if he buys, when you want the money for other purposes?\" asked the widow keenly.  \"He is a near relative of my wife, and that makes the difference, I apprehend.\"  \"Well, madam, what do you say?\" asked Kirk briskly.  \"I say this, that I will keep the house if I can.\"  \"You needn't expect that I will relent,\" said the squire hastily.  \"I do not, for I see there is no consideration in your heart for a poor widow; but I cannot help thinking that Providence will raise up some kind friend who will buy the mortgage, or in some other way will enable me to save my home.\"  You are acting very foolishly, Mrs. Barclay, as you will realize in time.  I give you a week in which to change your mind.  Till then my friend Kirk's offer stands good.  After that I cannot promise.  If the property sold at auction I shouldn't he surprised if it did not fetch more than the amount of my lien upon it.\"  \"I will trust in Providence, Squire Davenport.\"  \"Providence won't pay off your mortgage, ma'am,\" said Kirk, with a coarse laugh.  Mrs. Barclay did not answer.  She saw that he was a man of coarse fiber and did not care to notice him.  \"Come along, Kirk,\" said the squire.  \"I apprehend she will be all right after a while.  Mrs. Barclay will see her own interest when she comes to reflect.\"  \"Good-evening, ma'am,\" said Kirk.  Mrs. Barclay inclined her head slowly, but did not reply.  When the two had left the house she sank into a chair and gave herself to painful thoughts.  She had known that Squire Davenport had the right to dispossess her, but had not supposed he would do so as long as she paid the interest regularly.  In order to do this, she and Ben had made earnest efforts, and denied themselves all but the barest necessities.  Thus far she had succeeded.  The interest on seven hundred dollars at six per cent. had amounted to forty-two dollars, and this was a large sum to pay, but thus far they had always had it ready.  That Squire Davenport, with his own handsome mansion, would fix covetous eyes on her little home, she had not anticipated, but it had come to pass.  As to raising seven hundred dollars to pay off the mortgage, or induce any capitalist to furnish it, she feared it would be quite impossible.  She anxiously waited for Ben's return from the Town Hall in order to consult with him.     CHAPTER V PROFESSOR HARRINGTON'S ENTERTAINMENT   Meanwhile Ben Barclay was enjoying himself at Professor Harrington's entertainment.  He was at the Town Hall fifteen minutes before the time, and secured a seat very near the stage, or, perhaps it will be more correct to say, the platform.  He had scarcely taken his seat when, to his gratification, Rose Gardiner entered the hall and sat down"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10724"],["title","The Store Boy (#3)"],["body","him.  \"Good-evening, Ben,\" she said pleasantly.  \"So you came, after all.\"  Ben's face flushed with pleasure, for Rose Gardiner was, as we have said, the prettiest girl in Pentonville, and for this reason, as well as for her agreeable manners, was an object of attraction to the boys, who, while too young to be in love, were not insensible to the charms of a pretty face.  I may add that Rose was the niece of the Rev. Mr. Gardiner, the minister of the leading church in the village.  \"Good-evening, Rose,\" responded Ben, who was too well acquainted with the young lady to address her more formally; \"I am glad to be in such company.\"  \"I wish I could return the compliment,\" answered Rose, with a saucy smile.  \"Don't be too severe,\" said Ben, \"or you will hurt my feelings.\"  \"That would be a pity, surely; but how do do you happen to get off this evening?  I thought you spent your evenings at the store.\"  \"So I do, generally, but I was excused this evening for a special reason,\" and then he told of his adventure with the tramp.  Rose listened with eager attention.  \"Weren't you terribly frightened?\" she asked.  \"No,\" answered Ben, adding, with a smile: \"Even if I had been, I shouldn't like to confess it.\"  \"I should have been so frightened that I would have screamed,\" continued the young lady.  \"I didn't think of that,\" said Ben, amused.  \"I'll remember it next time.\"  \"Oh, now I know you are laughing at me.  Tell me truly, weren't you frightened?\"  \"I was only afraid I would lose Mr. Crawford's money.  The tramp was stronger than I, and could have taken it from me if he had known I had it.\"  \"You tricked him nicely.  Where did he go?  Do you think he is still in town?\"  \"He went into the woods.  I don't think he is in the village.  He would be afraid of being arrested.\"  At that very moment the tramp was in Ben's kitchen, but of that Ben had no idea.  \"I don't know what I should do if I met him,\" said Rose.  \"You see I came alone.  Aunt couldn't come with me, and uncle, being a minister, doesn't care for such things.\"  \"Then I hope you'll let me see you home,\" said Ben gallantly.  \"I wouldn't like to trouble you,\" said Rose, with a spice of coquetry. \"It will take you out of your way.\"  \"I don't mind that,\" said Ben eagerly.  \"Besides there won't be any need.  You say the tramp isn't in the village.\"  \"On second thoughts, I think it very likely he is,\" said Ben.  \"If you really think so--\" commenced Rose, with cunning hesitation.  \"I feel quite sure of it.  He's a terrible looking fellow.\"  Rose smiled to herself.  She meant all the time to accept Ben's escort, for he was a bright, attractive boy, and she liked his society.  \"Then perhaps I had better accept your offer, but I am sorry to give you so much trouble.\"  \"No trouble at all,\" said Ben promptly.  Just then Prof. Harrington came forward and made his introductory speech.  \"For my first experiment, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, when this was over, \"I should like a pocket handkerchief.\"  A countrified-looking young man on the front seat, anxious to share in the glory of the coming trick, produced a flaming red bandanna from his pocket and tendered it with outstretched hand.  \"You are very kind,\" said the professor, \"but this will hardly answer my purpose.  I should prefer a linen handkerchief.  Will some young lady oblige me?\"  \"Let him have yours, Rose,\" suggested Ben.  Rose had no objection, and it was passed to the professor.  \"The young lady will give me leave to do what I please with the handkerchief?\" asked the professor.  Rose nodded assent.  \"Then,\" said the professor, \"I will see if it is proof against fire.\"  He deliberately unfolded it, crushed it in his hand, and then held it in the flame of a candle.  Rose uttered a low ejaculation.  \"That's the last of your handkerchief, Rose,\" said Ben.  \"You made me give it to him.  You must buy me another,\" said the young lady.  \"So I will, if you don't get it back safe.\"  \"How can I?\"  \"I don't know.  Perhaps the professor does,\" answered Ben.  \"Really,\" said the professor, contemplating the handkerchief regretfully.  \"I am afraid I have destroyed the handkerchief; I hope the young lady will pardon me.\"  He looked at Rose, but she made no sign.  She felt a little disturbed, for it was a fine handkerchief, given her by her aunt.  \"I see the young lady is annoyed,\" continued the magician.  \"In that case I must try to repair damages.  I made a little mistake in supposing the handkerchief to be noncombustible.  However, perhaps matters are not so bad as they seem.\"  He tossed the handkerchief behind a screen, and moved forward to a table on which was a neat box.  Taking a small key from his pocket, he unlocked it and drew forth before the astonished eyes of his audience the handkerchief intact.  \"I believe this is your handkerchief, is it not?\" he asked, stepping down from the platform and handing it back to Rose.  \"Yes,\" answered Rose, in amazement, examining it carefully, and unable to detect any injury.  \"And it is in as good condition as when you gave it to me?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"So much the better.  Then I shall not be at the expense of buying a new one.  Young man, have you any objections to lending me your hat?\"  This question was addressed to Ben.  \"No, sir.\"  \"Thank you.  I will promise not to burn it, as I did the young lady's handkerchief.  You are sure there is nothing in it?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  By this time the magician had reached the platform.  \"I am sorry to doubt the young gentleman's word,\" said the professor, \"but I will charitably believe he is mistaken.  Perhaps he forgot these articles when he said it was empty,\" and he drew forth a couple of potatoes and half a dozen onions from the hat and laid them on the table.  There was a roar of laughter from the audience, and Ben looked rather confused, especially when Rose turned to him and, laughing, said:  \"You've been robbing Mr. Crawford, I am afraid, Ben.\"  \"The young gentleman evidently uses his hat for a market-basket,\" proceeded the professor.  \"Rather a strange taste, but this is a free country.  But what have we here?\"  Out came a pair of stockings, a napkin and a necktie.  \"Very convenient to carry your wardrobe about with you,\" said the professor, \"though it is rather curious taste to put them with vegetables.  But here is something else,\" and the magician produced a small kitten, who regarded the audience with startled eyes and uttered a timid moan.  \"Oh, Ben!  let me have that pretty kitten,\" said Rose.  \"It's none of mine!\" said Ben, half annoyed, half amused.  \"I believe there is nothing more,\" said the professor.  He carried back the hat to Ben, and gave it to him with the remark:  \"Young man, you may call for your vegetables and other articles after the entertainment.\"  \"You are welcome to them,\" said Ben.  \"Thank you; you are very liberal.\"  When at length the performance was over, Ben and Rose moved toward the door.  As Rose reached the outer door, a boy about Ben's age, but considerably better dressed, stepped up to her and said, with a consequential air:  \"I will see you home, Miss Gardiner.\"  \"Much obliged, Mr. Davenport,\" said Rose, \"but I have accepted Ben's escort.\"     CHAPTER VI TWO YOUNG RIVALS   Tom Davenport, for it was the son of Squire Davenport who had offered his escort to Rose, glanced superciliously at our hero.  \"I congratulate you on having secured a grocer's boy as escort,\" he said in a tone of annoyance.  Ben's fist contracted, and he longed to give the pretentious aristocrat a lesson, but he had the good sense to wait for the young lady's reply.  \"I accept your congratulations, Mr. Davenport,\" said Rose coldly.  \"I have no desire to change my escort.\"  Tom Davenport laughed derisively, and walked away.  \"I'd like to box his ears,\" said Ben, reddening.  \"He doesn't deserve your notice, Ben,\" said Rose, taking his arm.  But Ben was not easily appeased.  \"Just because his father is a rich man,\" he resumed.  \"He presumes upon it,\" interrupted Rose, good-naturedly.  \"Well, let him.  That's his chief claim to consideration, and it is natural for him to make the most of it.\"  \"At any rate, I hope that can't be said of me,\" returned Ben, his brow clearing.  \"If I had nothing but money to be proud of, I should be very poorly off.\"  \"You wouldn't object to it, though.\"  \"No, I hope, for mother's sake, some day to be rich.\"  \"Most of our rich men were once poor boys,\" said Rose quietly.  \"I have a book of biographies at home, and I find that not only rich men, but men distinguished in other ways, generally commenced in poverty.\"  \"I wish you'd lend me that book,\" said Ben.  \"Sometimes I get despondent and that will give me courage.\"  \"You shall have it whenever you call at the house.  But you mustn't think too much of getting money.\"  \"I don't mean to; but I should like to make my mother comfortable.  I don't see much chance of it while I remain a 'grocer's boy,' as Tom Davenport calls me.\"  \"Better be a grocer's boy than spend your time in idleness, as Tom does.\"  \"Tom thinks it beneath him to work.\"  \"If his father had been of the sane mind when he was a boy, he would never have become a rich man.\"  \"Was Squire Davenport a poor boy?\"  \"Yes, so uncle told me the other day.  When he was a boy he worked on a farm.  I don't know how he made his money, but I presume he laid the foundation of his wealth by hard work.  So, Tom hasn't any right to look down upon those who are beginning now as his father began.\"  They had by this time traversed half the distance from the Town Hall to the young lady's home.  The subject of conversation was changed and they began to talk about the evening's entertainment.  At length they reached the minister's house.  \"Won't you come in, Ben?\" asked Rose.  \"Isn't it too late?\"  \"No, uncle always sits up late reading, and will be glad to see you.\"  \"Then I will come in for a few minutes.\"  Ben's few minutes extended to three-quarters of an hour.  When he came out, the moon was obscured and it was"]]]
