There's Godfrey Preston just passed with some books under his arm.\"  \"Just so.\"  \"I suppose Andrew would like to be going to school with other boys of his age.\"  \"Just so.\"  \"Don't you think we could spare him to go half the day?\"  \"Just so,\" said Sophia, with alacrity.  \"There isn't so much work to do now as there was in the summer, and he could do his chores early in the morning. He could go to school in the forenoon and work in the afternoon.\"  \"Just so, Priscilla. Shall we give him less wages?\"  \"No, I think not. He needs the money to give his mother.\"  \"Call him in and tell him,\" suggested Sophia.  \"It will do at dinner time.\"  \"Just so.\"  When the dinner was over, and Andy rose from the table, Miss Priscilla introduced the subject.  \"Are you a good scholar, Andrew?\"  \"I'm a mighty poor one, ma'am.\"  \"Did you ever study much?\"  \"No, ma'am, I've had to work ever since I was so high,\" indicating a point about two feet from the ground.  \"Dear me,\" said Sophia, \"you must have been very small.\"  \"Yes, ma'am, I was very small of my size.\"  \"I've been thinking, Andrew, that perhaps we could spare you half the day, so that you could go to school in the forenoon--you could learn something in three hours--should you like it?\"  \"Would I like it, ma'am? Wouldn't I, though? I don't want to grow up a poor, ignorant crathur, hardly able to read and write.\"  \"Then you can go to school to-morrow, and ask the teacher if he will take you for half the day. You can get up early, and get your chores done before school.\"  \"Oh, yes, ma'am, I can do that easy.\"  \"I think we have some schoolbooks in the house. Some years ago we had a nephew stay with us, and go to school. I think his books are still in the closet.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am. It'll save me buyin', and I haven't got any money to spare.\"  \"We shall give you the same wages, Andrew, though you will work less.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am. You're very kind.\"  \"Try to improve your time in school, as becomes the great-grandson of such a distinguished orator.\"  \"I'll try, ma'am,\" said Andy, looking a little queer at this allusion to the great Edmund Burke. In fact, he was ashamed of having deceived the kind old ladies, but didn't like now to own up to the deception lest they should lose confidence in him. But he determined hereafter to speak the truth, and not resort to deception.  The next morning, at twenty minutes of nine, Andy left the house provided with books, and joyfully took his way to the schoolhouse, which was a quarter of a mile distant. As he ascended the small hill on which it stood, he attracted the attention of a group of boys who had already arrived. Among them was his old adversary, Godfrey Preston.  \"Is that Irish boy coming to school?\" he said in a tone of disgust.  \"What? Andy Burke? I hope so,\" said Charles Fleming, \"he's a good fellow.\"  \"He's only an Irish boy,\" said Godfrey, with a sneer.  \"And I am only an American boy,\" said Charles, good-humoredly.  \"You can associate with him if you want to; I shan't,\" said Godfrey.  \"That's where I agree with you, Godfrey,\" said Ben Travers, who made himself rather a toady of Godfrey's.  Andy had now come up, so that Charles Fleming did not reply, but called out, cordially:  \"Are you coming to school, Andy?\"  \"Yes,\" said Andy.  \"I'm glad of it.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Andy. \"What's the matter with them fellows,\" as Godfrey and Bill Travers walked off haughtily, tossing their heads.  Charles Fleming laughed.  \"They don't think we are good enough for their company,\" he said.  \"I'm not anxious for it,\" said Andy. \"I like yours better.\"  \"I didn't think you could get away from work to come to school. Are you working for Miss Grant now?\"  \"Yes, but she lets me come to school half the day. She's a bully ould lady.\"  \"Well, half a loaf's better than no bread. Will you sit with me? I've got no one at my desk. Say yes.\"  \"It's just what I'd like, Charlie, but maybe Godfrey Preston wants to sit with me. I wouldn't like to disappoint him,\" said Andy, with sly humor.  \"Sit with me till he invites you, then.\"  \"That'll be a long day.\"  They went into the schoolhouse, and Andy deposited his books in the desk next to Charlie Fleming's. He couldn't have wished for a better or more agreeable companion. Charlie was the son of Dr. Fleming, the village physician, and was a general favorite in the town on account of his sunny, attractive manner. But, with all his affability, he was independent and resolute, if need be. He was one of the leaders of the school. Godfrey aspired also to be a leader, and was to some extent on account of his father's wealth and high standing, for, as we have seen, Colonel Preston was not like his son. Still, it is doubtful whether anyone was much attached to Godfrey. He was too selfish in disposition, and offensively consequential in manner, to inspire devoted friendship. Ben Travers, however, flattered him, and followed him about, simply because he was the son of a rich man. Such cases occur sometimes among American schoolboys, but generally they are too democratic and sensible to attach importance to social distinctions in the schoolroom, or in the playground.  When the teacher--a certain Ebenezer Stone, a man of thirty or upward--entered, Andy went up to him and asked permission to attend school a part of the time. As there had been such cases in former terms, no objection was offered by the teacher, and Andy went back to his seat, a regularly admitted member of the school.  It was found necessary to put him in a low class to begin with. He was naturally bright, but, as we know, his opportunities of learning had been very limited, and he could not be expected to know much. But Andy was old enough now to understand the worth of knowledge, and he devoted himself so earnestly to study that in the course of three weeks he was promoted to a higher class. This, however, is anticipating.  When recess came, the scholars poured out upon the playround. Charles Fleming and Godfrey Preston happened to pass out side by side.  \"I see you've taken that Irish boy to sit with you,\" he said.  \"You mean Andy Burke? Yes, I invited him to be my desk-fellow.\"  \"I congratulate you on your high-toned and aristocratic associate,\" observed Godfrey, sarcastically.  \"Thank you. I am glad to have him with me.\"  \"I wouldn't condescend to take him into my seat.\"  \"Nor do I. There isn't any condescension about it.\"  \"He works for a living.\"  \"So does my father, and so does yours. Are you going to cut your father's acquaintance for that reason?\"  \"My father could live without work.\"  \"He doesn't choose to, and that's where he shows his good sense.\"  \"It's a different kind of work from sawing and splitting wood, and such low labor.\"  \"It strikes me, Godfrey, that you ought to have been born somewhere else than in America. In this country labor is considered honorable. You ought to be living under a monarchy.\"  \"I don't believe in associating with inferiors.\"  \"I don't look upon Andy Burke as my inferior,\" said Charlie. \"He is poor, to be sure, but he is a good fellow, and helps support his mother and sister, as I would do in his place.\"  \"Charlie Fleming,\" was heard from the playground, \"come and choose up for baseball.\"  Without waiting for an answer, Charlie ran to the field alongside the schoolhouse, where the game was to take place.     CHAPTER XI A GAME OF BALL   \"Come here,\" said Conrad Fletcher; \"come here, Charlie, and choose up for a game. We must make haste, or recess will be over.\"  \"All right, Conrad.\"  The first choice devolved upon Conrad. He chose Ephraim Pinkham, noted as a catcher.  \"I take Elmer Rhodes,\" said Charlie.  \"John Parker,\" said Conrad.  \"Henry Strauss.\"  \"Godfrey Preston,\" was Conrad's next choice.  \"Can you play, Andy?\" asked Charlie.  \"Yes,\" said Andy.  \"Then, I take you.\"  \"I've a good mind to resign,\" said Godfrey, in a low voice, to Ben Travers. \"I don't fancy playing with that Irish boy.\"  However, he was too fond of playing to give up his place, notwithstanding his antipathy to Andy.  Charlie Fleming's side went in first, and Charlie himself went to the bat. The pitcher was Godfrey. He was really a fair pitcher, and considered himself very superior. Charlie finally succeeded in hitting the ball, but rather feebly, and narrowly escaped losing his first base. He saved it, however.  Next at the bat was Elmer Rhodes. He hit one or two fouls, but not a fair ball. Finally he was put out on three strikes; meanwhile, however, Charlie Fleming got round to third base. Henry Strauss succeeded in striking the ball, but it was caught by center field, rapidly sent to first base, before Henry could reach it, then thrown to the catcher in time to prevent Charlie Fleming from getting in. He ran half-way to home base, but seeing his danger, ran back to third base. Next Andy took the bat.  \"Knock me in, Andy,\" called out Charlie Fleming.  \"All right\" said Andy, quietly.  \"Not if I can prevent it,\" said Godfrey to himself, and he determined by sending poor balls, to get our hero out on three strikes. The first ball, therefore, he sent about six feet to the right of the batter. Andy stood in position, but, of course, was far too wise to attempt hitting any such ball. The next ball went several feet above his head. Of this, too, he took no notice. The third would have hit him if he had not dodged.  \"Why don't you knock at the balls?\" asked Godfrey.  \"I will, when you give better ones,\" said Andy, coolly.  \"I don't believe you know how to bat,\" said Godfrey, with a sneer.  \"I don't believe you know how to pitch,\" returned Andy.  \"How's that?\" sending another ball whizzing by his left ear.  \"I want them waist-high,\" said Andy. \"My waist is about two feet lower than my ears.\"  Godfrey now resolved to put in a ball waist-high, but so swiftly that Andy could not hit it; but he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11111"],["title","Only an Irish Boy; Or, Andy Burke's Fortunes (#8)"],["body","never seen Andy play. Our hero had a wonderfully quick eye and steady hand, and struck the ball with such force to left field, that not only Charlie Fleming got in, without difficulty, but Andy himself made a home run.  \"That's a splendid hit,\" exclaimed Charlie, with enthusiasm. \"I didn't think you could play so well.\"  \"I've played before to-day,\" said Andy, composedly. \"I told you I would get you in, and I meant what I said.\"  Godfrey looked chagrined at the result. He meant to demonstrate that Andy was no player, but had only contributed to his brilliant success; for, had he not sent in so swift a ball, the knock would not have been so forcible.  As there were but six on a side, two outs were considered all out.  \"Who will catch?\" asked Charlie Fleming; \"I want to pitch.\"  \"I will,\" said Andy.  \"All right! If you can catch as you can bat, we'll cut down their score.\"  Andy soon showed that he was no novice at catching. He rarely let a ball pass him. When Godfrey's turn came to bat, one was already out, and Andy determined to put Godfrey out if it was a possible thing. One strike had been called, when Godfrey struck a foul which was almost impossible to catch. But now Andy ran, made a bound into the air, and caught it--a very brilliant piece of play, by which Godfrey and his side were put out. The boys on both sides applauded, for it was a piece of brilliant fielding which not one of them was capable of. That is, all applauded but Godfrey. He threw down his bat spitefully, and said to Fleming:  \"You didn't give me good balls.\"  \"I gave you much better than you gave Andy,\" said Charlie.  \"That's so!\" chimed in two other boys.  \"I won't play any more,\" said Godfrey.  Just then the bell rang, so that the game was brought to a close. Andy received the compliments of the boys on his brilliant playing. He received them modestly, and admitted that he probably couldn't make such a catch again. It was very disagreeable to Godfrey to hear Andy praised. He was rather proud of his ball-playing, and he saw that Andy was altogether his superior, at any rate in the opinion of the boys. However, he ingeniously contrived to mingle a compliment with a sneer.  \"You're more used to baseball than to books,\" he said.  \"True for you,\" said Andy.  \"You're a head taller than any of the boys in your class.\"  \"I know that,\" said Andy. \"I haven't been to school as much as you.\"  \"I should be ashamed if I didn't know more.\"  \"So you ought,\" said Andy, \"for you've been to school all your life. I hope to know more soon.\"  \"Anyway, you can play ball,\" said Charlie Fleming.  \"I'd rather be a good scholar.\"  \"I'll help you, if you want any help.\"  \"Thank you, Charlie.\"  They had now entered the schoolroom, and Andy took up his book and studied hard. He was determined to rise to a higher class as soon as possible, for it was not agreeable to him to reflect that he was the oldest and largest boy in his present class.  \"Very well,\" said the teacher, when his recitation was over. \"If you continue to recite in this way, you will soon be promoted.\"  \"I'll do my best, sir,\" said Andy, who listened to these words with pleasure.  \"I wish you were coming in the afternoon, too, Andy,\" said his friend, Charlie Fleming, as they walked home together.  \"So do I, Charlie, but I must work for my mother.\"  \"That's right, Andy; I'd do the same in your place. I haven't such foolish ideas about work as Godfrey Preston.\"  \"He ain't very fond of me,\" said Andy, laughing.  \"No; nor of anybody else. He only likes Godfrey Preston.\"  \"We got into a fight the first day I ever saw him.\"  \"What was it about?\"  \"He called my mother names, and hit me. So I knocked him flat.\"  \"You served him right. He's disgustingly conceited. Nobody likes him.\"  \"Ben Travers goes around with him all the time.\"  \"Ben likes him because he is rich. If he should lose his property, you'd see how soon he would leave him. That isn't a friend worth having.\"  \"I've got one consolation,\" said Andy, laughing; \"nobody likes me for my money.\"  \"But someone likes you for yourself, Andy,\" said Charlie.  \"Who?\"  \"Myself, to be sure.\"  \"And I like you as much, Charlie,\" said Andy, warmly. \"You're ten times as good a fellow as Godfrey.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Charlie. \"That isn't saying very much, Andy.\"  So the friendship was cemented, nor did it end there. Charlie spoke of Andy's good qualities at home, and some time afterward Andy was surprised by an invitation to spend the evening at Dr. Fleming's. He felt a little bashful, but finally went--nor was he at all sorry for so doing. The whole family was a delightful one, and Andy was welcomed as a warm friend of Charlie's, and, in the pleasant atmosphere of the doctor's fireside, he quite forgot that there was one who looked down upon him as an inferior being.  Dr. Fleming had himself been a poor boy. By a lucky chance--or Providence, rather--he had been put in the way of obtaining an education, and he was not disposed now, in his prosperity, to forget his days of early struggle.  Andy found that, in spite of the three hours taken up at school, he was able to do all that was required of him by the Misses Grant. They were glad to hear of his success at school, and continued to pay him five dollars a week for his services. This money he regularly carried to his mother, after paying for the new clothes, of which he stood so much in need.     CHAPTER XII A LITTLE DIFFICULTY   It has already been said that Godfrey Preston was a conceited and arrogant boy. He had a very high idea of his own importance, and expected that others would acknowledge it; but he was not altogether successful. He would like to have had Andy Burke look up to him as a member of a superior class, and in that case might have condescended to patronize him, as a chieftain might in the case of a humble retainer. But Andy didn't want to be patronized by Godfrey. He never showed by his manner that he felt beneath him socially, and this greatly vexed Godfrey.  \"His mother used to iron at our house,\" he said to Ben Travers one day; \"but my mother discharged her. I don't see why the boys treat him as an equal. I won't, for my part.\"  \"Of course, he isn't your equal,\" said the subservient Ben. \"That's a good joke.\"  \"He acts as if he was,\" said Godfrey, discontentedly.  \"It's only his impudence.\"  \"You are right,\" said Godfrey, rather liking this explanation. \"He is one of the most impudent boys I know. I wish my father would send me to a fashionable school, where I shouldn't meet such fellows. That's the worst of these public schools--you meet all sorts of persons in them.\"  \"Of course you do.\"  \"I suppose this Burke will be a hod-carrier, or something of that kind, when he is a man.\"  \"While you are a member of Congress.\"  \"Very likely,\" said Godfrey, loftily; \"and he will claim that he was an old schoolmate of mine. It is disgusting.\"  \"Of course it is. However, we needn't notice him.\"  \"I don't mean to.\"  But in the course of the next week there was an occurrence which compelled Godfrey to \"notice\" his detested schoolfellow.  Among the scholars was a very pleasant boy of twelve, named Alfred Parker. He was the son of a poor widow, and was universally liked for his amiable and obliging disposition. One morning, before school, he was engaged in some game which required him to run. He accidentally ran against Godfrey, who was just coming up the hill, with considerable force. Now, it was very evident that it was wholly unintentional; but Godfrey was greatly incensed.  \"What do you mean by that, you little scamp?\" he exclaimed, furiously.  \"Excuse me, Godfrey; I didn't mean to run into you.\"  \"That don't go down.\"  \"Indeed, I didn't. I didn't see you.\"  \"I can't help it. You ought to have been more careful. Take that, to make you more careful.\"  As he said this, he seized him by the collar, and, tripping him, laid him flat on his back.  \"For shame, Godfrey!\" said another boy standing by; but as it was a small boy, Godfrey only answered:  \"If you say that again, I'll serve you the same way.\"  Alfred tried to get up, but Godfrey put his knee on his breast.  \"Let me up, Godfrey,\" said Alfred, piteously. \"I can't breathe. You hurt me.\"  \"I'll teach you to run into me,\" said the bully.  \"I didn't mean to.\"  \"I want to make sure of your not doing it again.\"  \"Do let me up,\" said Alfred.  In return, Godfrey only pressed more heavily, and the little fellow began to cry. But help was near at hand. Andy Burke happened to come up the hill just then, and saw what was going on. He had a natural chivalry that prompted him always to take the weaker side. But besides this, he liked Alfred for his good qualities, and disliked Godfrey for his bad ones. He did not hesitate a moment, therefore, but ran up, and, seizing Godfrey by the collar with a powerful grasp, jerked him on his back in the twinkling of an eye. Then, completely turning the tables, he put his knee on Godfrey's breast, and said:  \"Now, you know how it is yourself. How do you like it?\"  \"Let me up,\" demanded Godfrey, furiously.  \"That's what Alfred asked you to do,\" said Andy, coolly. \"Why didn't you do it?\"  \"Because I didn't choose,\" answered the prostrate boy, almost foaming at the mouth with rage and humiliation.  \"Then I don't choose to let you up.\"  \"You shall suffer for this,\" said Godfrey, struggling, but in vain.  \"Not from your hands. Oh, you needn't try so hard to get up. I can hold you here all day if I choose.\"  \"You're a low Irish boy!\"  \"You're lower than I am just now,\" said Andy.  \"Let me up.\"  \"Why didn't you let Alfred up?\"  \"He ran against me.\"  \"Did he mean to?\"  \"No, I didn't, Andy,\" said Alfred, who was standing near. \"I told Godfrey so, but he threw me over, and pressed on my breast so hard that it hurt me.\"  \"In this way,\" said Andy, increasing the pressure on his prostrate enemy.  Godfrey renewed his struggles, but in vain.  \"Please let him up now, Andy,\" said Alfred, generously.  \"If he'll promise not to touch you any more,"]]]
