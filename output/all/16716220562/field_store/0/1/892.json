But now he is sleeping most beautifully, so I feel sure he has taken a turn, and that we shall pull him through.\"  \"Yes,\" said Katherine, as she followed Mrs. Burton into the store to look after the fire.  \"I think he will get better now,\" but her tone was so dull and lacking in spirit that her sister faced round upon her in quick consternation.  \"What is the matter? Do you feel ill? Why, you are white as chalk, and you look as if you had seen a ghost!\"  \"I don't think there are any ghosts to see in this part of the world,\" Katherine replied, with a brave attempt at a laugh, \"unless, indeed, the unquiet spirit of some Hudson's Bay Company's agent, done to death by treacherous Indians, haunts these shores.\"  \"Or some poor sealer caught in the ice and frozen to death,\" murmured Mrs. Burton, with a sobbing catch in her breath.  Katherine, who was putting wood in the stove, turned suddenly, catching her sister in a warm, impulsive hug.  \"There are no ghosts nor unquiet spirits among those brave men who meet death while doing their daily work, darling!\" she said earnestly.  \"But I fancy some of those old H.B.C. agents were fearful rogues, and well deserved the fate they met at the hands of the outraged red men.\"  \"Perhaps so; I don't know.  But I don't like seeing you look so pale, Katherine.  Come and have your tea, and I will send one of the boys to look after Father for a little while.\"  Katherine followed her sister from the store into the kitchen, wondering as she went if tea, however hot, would have the power to drive away the creeping chill at her heart.  Miles went off to take charge of the sickroom, while Phil set tea, chattering all the time concerning the gossip of the store which had come to his ears during the last few days.  \"The men are saying that most likely, if Mr. Selincourt is such a rich man, he will be sure to have a steamer run up through the Strait two or three times during the summer with provisions, and so it will be bad for Father and the store,\" he said, carefully setting the cracked cup for Miles, although by rights it was his own turn to have it.  \"What nonsense people talk!\" exclaimed Mrs. Burton, with a scornful laugh.  \"Mr. Selincourt will have his hands full with managing the fishing fleet, and if he is so unwise as to turn general trader, I dare say we can find some way of underselling him or enticing his customers away.\"  Katherine put down her cup of tea with an unsteady movement which spilled some of the contents over the tablecloth.  Here was a view of the situation which she had not thought to be compelled to face. If Mr. Selincourt did anything which took their trade away, and left them face to face with starvation, would it be their duty to sit down meekly and bear such an injustice, without attempting a blow in self-defence, and all because of that evil from the past which, although so long buried, had suddenly come to life again?  \"Katherine, how frightened you look!  You surely are not worrying about a bit of store gossip, which has probably not the slightest foundation in fact?\" Mrs. Burton said in remonstrance.  \"It is of no use to worry about anything so remote as Mr. Selincourt and the fishing fleet,\" Katherine answered languidly. \"But I am so tired that bed for a few hours seems the most desirable thing on earth.\"  \"Then go, dear, and get a good rest,\" said her sister.  But, although Katherine lay down and covered herself with the bedclothes, sleep was long in coming, while the burden she had taken made her heart heavy as lead.     CHAPTER VI  Business Bothers  For a few days 'Duke Radford appeared to get better with astonishing rapidity.  He left his bed, and crept across the store, to sit in the rocking-chair by the kitchen stove, and said he was now quite well.  But when he had pulled up thus far towards strength again, he stopped short, unable to get any farther.  In vain Mrs. Burton plied him with every nourishing food she could think of: an invalid he remained, weak and depressed, all his old energy and enterprise under a cloud, and with a settled melancholy which nothing could lift.  It was then that the burden of life descended with such crushing force on Katherine.  The work of the store must go on, and it was harder in winter than in summer.  She spent long hours burrowing among the piles of merchandise in the underground chamber beneath the store, where were kept the goods bought and brought to Roaring Water Portage when the waters were open.  Or, with Miles for a companion, she went long distances across the snowy wastes, delivering stores by dog team and sledge.  This was all very well on the still days, when the sun shone with cloudless brilliancy in a clear sky, and the dogs tore along like mad creatures, and the whole of the expedition would seem like a frolic; but there were other days when things were very different.  Sometimes a raging wind would sweep in from the bay, laden with a terrible stinging damp, which kind of cold pierced like daggers.  Or a roaring north wind would howl through the forests, snapping off big trees from their roots as if they were only twigs, while earth, air, and sky were a confusion of whirling snowflakes.  These were the dangerous days, and they never ventured far from home when such blizzards were raging, unless it was for the three miles' run down to Seal Cove, where the trail had been dug out, and the snow banked, at the beginning of winter.  There were a large number of sealing and walrus boats laid up in ice between Roaring Water Portage and Seal Cove.  Most of these had men living on board, who passed the days in loafing, in setting traps for wolves, or in boring holes through the ice for fishing. Many of them spent a great portion of their time in the little house at the bend of the river, where Oily Dave dispensed bad whisky and played poker with his customers from morning to night, or, taking a rough average, for sixteen hours out of the twenty-four.  These were the men whom Katherine most dreaded to encounter.  They looked bold admiration, and roared out compliments at the top of husky voices, but they ventured nothing further; her manner was too repressive, and the big dogs which always accompanied her were much too fierce to be trifled with.  Mrs. Burton had left off lamenting the chances of damage to her sister's complexion from exposure, for she realized that Katherine must be breadwinner now, and the stern necessities of life had to be first consideration for them all.  One day Katherine found to her surprise that some tin buckets of lard were missing from the store.  It was only the day before that, rummaging in the far corner of the cellar, she had unearthed six of these buckets, which had apparently been forgotten, as the date chalked on them was eighteen months old.  With much hard work she hauled four of them to the store above, ripped the cover from one, so that the contents might be retailed at so much per pound, and left the other three standing in a row on a shelf which was remote from the stove.  But now two were gone, and looking at the one which had been opened she saw that it was only half full.  For a moment she supposed that there must have been a considerable run on lard during the previous evening, while she was teaching night school, with Miles on duty in the store.  It had been such a fine clear evening that many people were abroad who would otherwise have been in bed, or at any rate shut up in the stuffy little cabins of the snow-banked sealers.  A minute of thought, however, showed her that such a demand for lard would have been so much out of the common as to have elicited some comment from Miles at closing time.  Each bucket would contain something over thirty pounds in weight, so the sale of over sixty pounds' weight of lard in one evening would have been something of a record for Roaring Water Portage. Miles was busy at the wood pile; she could not leave the store to go and question him then, so had to wait with what patience she could muster until he came indoors again.  Her father had not left his bed yet; indeed he rarely did leave it now until noon or later, when he dressed himself, walked across the kitchen, and sat in the rocking-chair until it was time for bed again.  The life would have seemed dreary and monotonous enough if it had not been for the hard and constant work, which made the days of that winter fly faster for Katherine than any winter had ever flown before.  She did not mind the work.  Young, strong, and with plenty of energy, the daily toil seemed rather pleasant than otherwise. It was business bothers like this about the missing lard which tried her patience and temper.  Presently Miles came in, his face red and warm from hard work in the open air, but puckered into a look of worry, which found a reflection on the countenance of Katherine.  \"We are running out of fish for the dogs, Katherine.  Have we been using it too fast, do you think?\" he asked.  \"Surely not.  The poor creatures cannot work unless they are well fed, and they have never had more than they could eat. How much longer will it last?\"  \"Three days perhaps, not more,\" Miles answered.  \"It has seemed to go all at once.\"  \"Just so.  I should fancy the fish has suffered in the same way as the lard.  You had better keep the door of the fish-house locked in future.  I wonder where we can get some more fish?  People's stocks of dried fish will be getting low now, I expect,\" Katherine said, wrinkling her brows and trying to think of a likely place where the want could be supplied.  \"I know where we could get fresh fish, pretty nearly any amount of it, if you didn't mind the bother of catching it.  We could freeze it and keep it so.  But what about the lard?  You meant it to be sold, didn't you?\"  \"Yes, of course; but how much did you sell?\" asked Katherine, with a hope that he really had sold it all and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11111"],["title","Only an Irish Boy; Or, Andy Burke's Fortunes (#0)"],["body","AN IRISH BOY           Or, Andy Burke's Fortunes                       by                Horatio Alger, Jr.   Author of \"Paul the Peddler,\" \"Phil the Fiddler,\"       \"Strive and Succeed,\" \"Slow and Sure,\"             \"Try and Trust,\" etc.     CONTENTS    Chapter         I.

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL      ONLY AN IRISH BOY     CHAPTER I ANDY BURKE   \"John, saddle my horse, and bring him around to the door.\"  The speaker was a boy of fifteen, handsomely dressed, and, to judge from his air and tone, a person of considerable consequence, in his own opinion, at least. The person addressed was employed in the stable of his father, Colonel Anthony Preston, and so inferior in social condition that Master Godfrey always addressed him in imperious tones.  John looked up and answered, respectfully:  \"Master Godfrey, your horse is sick of the disease, and your father left orders that he wasn't to go out on no account.\"  \"It's my horse,\" said Godfrey; \"I intend to take him out.\"  \"Maybe it's yours, but your father paid for him.\"  \"None of your impudence, John,\" answered Godfrey, angrily. \"Am I master, or are you, I should like to know!\"  \"Neither, I'm thinking,\" said John, with a twinkle in his eye. \"It's your father that's the master.\"  \"I'm master of the horse, anyway, so saddle him at once.\"  \"The colonel would blame me,\" objected John.  \"If you don't, I'll report you and get you dismissed.\"  \"I'll take the risk, Master Godfrey,\" said the servant, good-humoredly. \"The colonel won't be so unreasonable as to send me away for obeying his own orders.\"  Here John was right, and Godfrey knew it, and this vexed him the more. He had an inordinate opinion of himself and his own consequence, and felt humiliated at being disobeyed by a servant, without being able to punish him for his audacity. This feeling was increased by the presence of a third party, who was standing just outside the fence.  As this third party is our hero, I must take a separate paragraph to describe him. He was about the age of Godfrey, possibly a little shorter and stouter. He had a freckled face, full of good humor, but at the same time resolute and determined. He appeared to be one who had a will of his own, but not inclined to interfere with others, though ready to stand up for his own rights. In dress he compared very unfavorably with the young aristocrat, who was biting his lips with vexation. In fact, though he is my hero, his dress was far from heroic. He had no vest, and his coat was ragged, as well as his pants. He had on a pair of shoes two or three times too large for him. They had not been made to order, but had been given him by a gentleman of nearly double his size, and fitted him too much. He wore a straw hat, for it was summer, but the brim was semi-detached, and a part of his brown hair found its way through it.  Now Godfrey was just in the mood for picking a quarrel with somebody, and as there was no excuse for quarreling any further with John, he was rather glad to pitch into the young stranger.  \"Who are you?\" he demanded, in his usual imperious tone, and with a contraction of the brow.  \"Only an Irish boy!\" answered the other, with a droll look and a slight brogue.  \"Then what business have you leaning against my fence?\" again demanded Godfrey, imperiously.  \"Shure, I didn't know it was your fence.\"  \"Then you know now. Quit leaning against it.\"  \"Why should I, now? I don't hurt it, do I?\"  \"No matter--I told you to go away. We don't want any beggars here.\"  \"Shure, I don't see any,\" said the other boy, demurely.  \"What are you but a beggar?\"  \"Shure, I'm a gintleman of indepindent fortune.\"  \"You look like it,\" said Godfrey, disdainfully. \"Where do you keep it?\"  \"Here!\" said the Irish boy, tapping a bundle which he carried over his shoulder, wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief, with a stick thrust through beneath the knot.  \"What's your name?\"  \"Andy Burke. What's yours?\"  \"I don't feel under any obligations to answer your questions,\" said Godfrey, haughtily.  \"Don't you? Then what made you ask me?\"  \"That's different. You are only an Irish boy.\"  \"And who are you?\"  \"I am the only son of Colonel Anthony Preston,\" returned Godfrey, impressively.  \"Are you, now? I thought you was a royal duke, or maybe Queen Victoria's oldest boy.\"  \"Fellow, you are becoming impertinent.\"  \"Faith, I didn't mean it. You look so proud and gintale that it's jist a mistake I made.\"  \"You knew that we had no dukes in America,\" said Godfrey, suspiciously.  \"If we had, now, you'd be one of them,\" said Andy.  \"Why? What makes you say so?\"  \"You're jist the picture of the Earl of Barleycorn's ildest son that I saw before I left Ireland.\"  Godfrey possessed so large a share of ridiculous pride that he felt pleased with the compliment, though he was not clear about its sincerity.  \"Where do you live?\" he asked, with a slight lowering of his tone.  \"Where do I live? Shure, I don't live anywhere now, but I'm going to live in the village. My mother came here a month ago.\"  \"Why didn't you come with her?\"  \"I was workin' with a farmer, but the work gave out and I came home. Maybe I'll find work here.\"  \"I think I know where your mother lives,\" said John, who had heard the conversation. \"She lives up the road a mile or so, in a little house with two rooms. It's where old Jake Barlow used to live.\"  \"Thank you, sir. I guess I'll be goin', then, as my mother'll be expectin' me. Do you know if she's well?\" and a look of anxiety came over the boy's honest, good-natured face.  The question was addressed to John, but of this Godfrey was not quite sure. He thought the inquiry was made of him, and his pride was touched.  \"What should I know of your mother, you beggar?\" he said, with a sneer. \"I don't associate with such low people.\"  \"Do you mane my mother?\" said Andy, quickly, and he, too, looked angry and threatening.  \"Yes, I do. What are you going to do about it?\" demanded Godfrey.  \"You'd better take it back,\" said Andy, his good-humored face now dark with passion.  \"Do you think I am afraid of such a beggar as you?\" sneered Godfrey. \"You appear to forget that you are speaking to a gentleman.\"  \"Shure, I didn't know it,\" returned Andy, hotly. \"You're no gentleman if you insult my mother, and if you'll come out here for a minute I'll give you a bating.\"  \"John,\" said Godfrey, angrily, \"will you drive that beggar away?\"  Now, John's sympathies were rather with Andy than with his young master. He had no great admiration for Godfrey, having witnessed during the year he had been in his father's employ too much of the boy's arrogance and selfishness to feel much attachment for him. Had he taken any part in the present quarrel, he would have preferred espousing the cause of the Irish boy; but that would not have been polite, and he therefore determined to preserve his neutrality.  \"That ain't my business, Master Godfrey,\" he said. \"You must fight your own battles.\"  \"Go away from here,\" said Godfrey, imperiously advancing toward that part of the fence against which Andy Burke was leaning.  \"Will you take back what you said agin' my mother?\"  \"No, I won't.\"  \"Then you're a blackguard, if you are a rich man's son.\"  The blood rushed to Godfrey's face on the instant. This was a palpable insult. What! he, a rich man's son, the only son and heir of Colonel Anthony Preston, with his broad acres and ample bank account--he to be called a blackguard by a low Irish boy. His passion got the better of him, and he ran through the gate, his eyes flashing fire, bent on exterminating his impudent adversary.     CHAPTER II A SKIRMISH   Andy Burke was not the boy to run away from an opponent of his own size and age. Neither did he propose to submit quietly to the thrashing which Godfrey designed to give him. He dropped his stick and bundle, and squared off scientifically at his aristocratic foe.  Godfrey paused an instant before him.  \"I'm going to give you a thrashing,\" he said; \"the worst thrashing you ever had.\"  \"Are you, now?\" asked Andy, undismayed. \"Come on, thin; I'm ready for you.\"  \"You're an impudent young ruffian.\"  \"So are you.\"  Godfrey's aristocratic blood boiled at this retort, and he struck out at Andy, but the latter knew what was coming, and, swift as a flash, warded it off, and fetched Godfrey a blow full upon his nose, which started the blood. Now, the pain and the sight of the blood combined filled him with added fury, and he attempted to seize Andy around the waist and throw him. But here again he was foiled. The young Irish boy evaded his grasp, and, seizing him in turn, by an adroit movement of the foot, tripped him up. Godfrey fell heavily on his back.  Andy withdrew a little, and did not offer to hold him down, as Godfrey would have been sure to do under similar circumstances. \"Have you got enough?\" he asked.  \"That wasn't fair,\""]]]
