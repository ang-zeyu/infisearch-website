Just wait--a minute.”  She stood quivering and blazing with wrath, and watched this savage fight his drunkenness. He acted like a man who had been suddenly shocked into a rational state of mind, and he was now battling with himself to hold on to it. Madeline saw the dark, damp hair lift from his brows as he held it up to the cool wind. Above him she saw the white stars in the deep-blue sky, and they seemed as unreal to her as any other thing in this strange night. They were cold, brilliant, aloof, distant; and looking at them, she felt her wrath lessen and die and leave her calm.  The cowboy turned and began to talk.  “You see--I was pretty drunk,” he labored. “There was a fiesta--and a wedding. I do fool things when I'm drunk. I made a fool bet I'd marry the first girl who came to town.... If you hadn't worn that veil--the fellows were joshing me--and Ed Linton was getting married--and everybody always wants to gamble.... I must have been pretty drunk.”  After the one look at her when she had first put aside her veil he had not raised his eyes to her face. The cool audacity had vanished in what was either excessive emotion or the maudlin condition peculiar to some men when drunk. He could not stand still; perspiration collected in beads upon his forehead; he kept wiping his face with his scarf, and he breathed like a man after violent exertions.  “You see--I was pretty--” he began.  “Explanations are not necessary,” she interrupted. “I am very tired--distressed. The hour is late. Have you the slightest idea what it means to be a gentleman?”  His bronzed face burned to a flaming crimson.  “Is my brother here--in town to-night?” Madeline went on.  “No. He's at his ranch.”  “But I wired him.”  “Like as not the message is over in his box at the P.O. He'll be in town to-morrow. He's shipping cattle for Stillwell.”  “Meanwhile I must go to a hotel. Will you please--”  If he heard her last words he showed no evidence of it. A noise outside had attracted his attention. Madeline listened. Low voices of men, the softer liquid tones of a woman, drifted in through the open door. They spoke in Spanish, and the voices grew louder. Evidently the speakers were approaching the station. Footsteps crunching on gravel attested to this, and quicker steps, coming with deep tones of men in anger, told of a quarrel. Then the woman's voice, hurried and broken, rising higher, was eloquent of vain appeal.  The cowboy's demeanor startled Madeline into anticipation of something dreadful. She was not deceived. From outside came the sound of a scuffle--a muffled shot, a groan, the thud of a falling body, a woman's low cry, and footsteps padding away in rapid retreat.  Madeline Hammond leaned weakly back in her seat, cold and sick, and for a moment her ears throbbed to the tramp of the dancers across the way and the rhythm of the cheap music. Then into the open door-place flashed a girl's tragic face, lighted by dark eyes and framed by dusky hair. The girl reached a slim brown hand round the side of the door and held on as if to support herself. A long black scarf accentuated her gaudy attire.  “Senor--Gene!” she exclaimed; and breathless glad recognition made a sudden break in her terror.  “Bonita!” The cowboy leaped to her. “Girl! Are you hurt?”  “No, Senor.”  He took hold of her. “I heard--somebody got shot. Was it Danny?”  “No, Senor.”  “Did Danny do the shooting? Tell me, girl.”  “No, Senor.”  “I'm sure glad. I thought Danny was mixed up in that. He had Stillwell's money for the boys--I was afraid.... Say, Bonita, but you'll get in trouble. Who was with you? What did you do?”  “Senor Gene--they Don Carlos vaqueros--they quarrel over me. I only dance a leetle, smile a leetle, and they quarrel. I beg they be good--watch out for Sheriff Hawe... and now Sheriff Hawe put me in jail. I so frighten; he try make leetle love to Bonita once, and now he hate me like he hate Senor Gene.”  “Pat Hawe won't put you in jail. Take my horse and hit the Peloncillo trail. Bonita, promise to stay away from El Cajon.”  “Si, Senor.”  He led her outside. Madeline heard the horse snort and champ his bit. The cowboy spoke low; only a few words were intelligible--“stirrups... wait... out of town... mountain... trail ... now ride!”  A moment's silence ensued, and was broken by a pounding of hoofs, a pattering of gravel. Then Madeline saw a big, dark horse run into the wide space. She caught a glimpse of wind-swept scarf and hair, a little form low down in the saddle. The horse was outlined in black against the line of dim lights. There was something wild and splendid in his flight.  Directly the cowboy appeared again in the doorway.  “Miss Hammond, I reckon we want to rustle out of here. Been bad goings-on. And there's a train due.”  She hurried into the open air, not daring to look back or to either side. Her guide strode swiftly. She had almost to run to keep up with him. Many conflicting emotions confused her. She had a strange sense of this stalking giant beside her, silent except for his jangling spurs. She had a strange feeling of the cool, sweet wind and the white stars. Was it only her disordered fancy, or did these wonderful stars open and shut? She had a queer, disembodied thought that somewhere in ages back, in another life, she had seen these stars. The night seemed dark, yet there was a pale, luminous light--a light from the stars--and she fancied it would always haunt her.  Suddenly aware that she had been led beyond the line of houses, she spoke:  “Where are you taking me?”  “To Florence Kingsley,” he replied.  “Who is she?”  “I reckon she's your brother's best friend out here.” Madeline kept pace with the cowboy for a few moments longer, and then she stopped. It was as much from necessity to catch her breath as it was from recurring fear. All at once she realized what little use her training had been for such an experience as this. The cowboy, missing her, came back the few intervening steps. Then he waited, still silent, looming beside her.  “It's so dark, so lonely,” she faltered. “How do I know... what warrant can you give me that you--that no harm will befall me if I go farther?”  “None, Miss Hammond, except that I've seen your face.”     II. A Secret Kept  Because of that singular reply Madeline found faith to go farther with the cowboy. But at the moment she really did not think about what he had said. Any answer to her would have served if it had been kind. His silence had augmented her nervousness, compelling her to voice her fear. Still, even if he had not replied at all she would have gone on with him. She shuddered at the idea of returning to the station, where she believed there had been murder; she could hardly have forced herself to go back to those dim lights in the street; she did not want to wander around alone in the dark.  And as she walked on into the windy darkness, much relieved that he had answered as he had, reflecting that he had yet to prove his words true, she began to grasp the deeper significance of them. There was a revival of pride that made her feel that she ought to scorn to think at all about such a man. But Madeline Hammond discovered that thought was involuntary, that there were feelings in her never dreamed of before this night.  Presently Madeline's guide turned off the walk and rapped at a door of a low-roofed house.  “Hullo--who's there?” a deep voice answered.  “Gene Stewart,” said the cowboy. “Call Florence--quick!”  Thump of footsteps followed, a tap on a door, and voices. Madeline heard a woman exclaim: “Gene! here when there's a dance in town! Something wrong out on the range.” A light flared up and shone bright through a window. In another moment there came a patter of soft steps, and the door opened to disclose a woman holding a lamp.  “Gene! Al's not--”  “Al is all right,” interrupted the cowboy.  Madeline had two sensations then--one of wonder at the note of alarm and love in the woman's voice, and the other of unutterable relief to be safe with a friend of her brother's.  “It's Al's sister--came on to-night's train,” the cowboy was saying. “I happened to be at the station, and I've fetched her up to you.”  Madeline came forward out of the shadow.  “Not--not really Majesty Hammond!” exclaimed Florence Kingsley. She nearly dropped the lamp, and she looked and looked, astounded beyond belief.  “Yes, I am really she,” replied Madeline. “My train was late, and for some reason Alfred did not meet me. Mr.--Mr. Stewart saw fit to bring me to you instead of taking me to a hotel.”  “Oh, I'm so glad to meet you,” replied Florence, warmly. “Do come in. I'm so surprised, I forget my manners. Why, Al never mentioned your coming.”  “He surely could not have received my messages,” said Madeline, as she entered.  The cowboy, who came in with her satchel, had to stoop to enter the door, and, once in, he seemed to fill the room. Florence set the lamp down upon the table. Madeline saw a young woman with a smiling, friendly face, and a profusion of fair hair hanging down over her dressing-gown.  “Oh, but Al will be glad!” cried Florence. “Why, you are white as a sheet. You must be tired. What a long wait you had at the station! I heard the train come in hours ago as I was going to bed. That station is lonely at night. If I had known you were coming! Indeed, you are very pale. Are you ill?”  “No. Only I am very tired. Traveling so far by rail is harder than I imagined. I did have rather a long wait after arriving at the station, but I can't say that it was lonely.”  Florence Kingsley searched Madeline's face with keen eyes, and then took a long, significant look at the silent Stewart. With that she deliberately and quietly closed a door leading into another room.  “Miss Hammond, what has happened?” She had lowered her voice.  “I do not wish to recall all that has happened,” replied Madeline. “I shall tell Alfred, however, that I would rather have met a hostile Apache than a cowboy.”  “Please don't tell"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1095"],["title","The Light of the Western Stars (#3)"],["body","that!” cried Florence. Then she grasped Stewart and pulled him close to the light. “Gene, you're drunk!”  “I was pretty drunk,” he replied, hanging his head.  “Oh, what have you done?”  “Now, see here, Flo, I only--”  “I don't want to know. I'd tell it. Gene, aren't you ever going to learn decency? Aren't you ever going to stop drinking? You'll lose all your friends. Stillwell has stuck to you. Al's been your best friend. Molly and I have pleaded with you, and now you've gone and done--God knows what!”  “What do women want to wear veils for?” he growled. “I'd have known her but for that veil.”  “And you wouldn't have insulted her. But you would the next girl who came along. Gene, you are hopeless. Now, you get out of here and don't ever come back.”  “Flo!” he entreated.  “I mean it.”  “I reckon then I'll come back to-morrow and take my medicine,” he replied.  “Don't you dare!” she cried.  Stewart went out and closed the door.  “Miss Hammond, you--you don't know how this hurts me,” said Florence. “What you must think of us! It's so unlucky that you should have had this happen right at first. Now, maybe you won't have the heart to stay. Oh, I've known more than one Eastern girl to go home without ever learning what we really are cut here. Miss Hammond, Gene Stewart is a fiend when he's drunk. All the same I know, whatever he did, he meant no shame to you. Come now, don't think about it again to-night.” She took up the lamp and led Madeline into a little room. “This is out West,”  she went on, smiling, as she indicated the few furnishings; “but you can rest. You're perfectly safe. Won't you let me help you undress--can't I do anything for you?”  “You are very kind, thank you, but I can manage,” replied Madeline.  “Well, then, good night. The sooner I go the sooner you'll rest. Just forget what happened and think how fine a surprise you're to give your brother to-morrow.”  With that she slipped out and softly shut the door.  As Madeline laid her watch on the bureau she noticed that the time was past two o'clock. It seemed long since she had gotten off the train. When she had turned out the lamp and crept wearily into bed she knew what it was to be utterly spent. She was too tired to move a finger. But her brain whirled.  She had at first no control over it, and a thousand thronging sensations came and went and recurred with little logical relation. There were the roar of the train; the feeling of being lost; the sound of pounding hoofs; a picture of her brother's face as she had last seen it five years before; a long, dim line of lights; the jingle of silver spurs; night, wind, darkness, stars. Then the gloomy station, the shadowy blanketed Mexican, the empty room, the dim lights across the square, the tramp of the dancers and vacant laughs and discordant music, the door flung wide and the entrance of the cowboy. She did not recall how he had looked or what he had done. And the next instant she saw him cool, smiling, devilish--saw him in violence; the next his bigness, his apparel, his physical being were vague as outlines in a dream. The white face of the padre flashed along in the train of thought, and it brought the same dull, half-blind, indefinable state of mind subsequent to that last nerve-breaking pistol-shot. That passed, and then clear and vivid rose memories of the rest that had happened--strange voices betraying fury of men, a deadened report, a moan of mortal pain, a woman's poignant cry. And Madeline saw the girl's great tragic eyes and the wild flight of the big horse into the blackness, and the dark, stalking figure of the silent cowboy, and the white stars that seemed to look down remorselessly.  This tide of memory rolled over Madeline again and again, and gradually lost its power and faded. All distress left her, and she felt herself drifting. How black the room was--as black with her eyes open as it was when they were shut! And the silence--it was like a cloak. There was absolutely no sound. She was in another world from that which she knew. She thought of this fair-haired Florence and of Alfred; and, wondering about them, she dropped to sleep.  When she awakened the room was bright with sunlight. A cool wind blowing across the bed caused her to put her hands under the blanket. She was lazily and dreamily contemplating the mud walls of this little room when she remembered where she was and how she had come there.  How great a shock she had been subjected to was manifest in a sensation of disgust that overwhelmed her. She even shut her eyes to try and blot out the recollection. She felt that she had been contaminated.  Presently Madeline Hammond again awoke to the fact she had learned the preceding night--that there were emotions to which she had heretofore been a stranger. She did not try to analyze them, but she exercised her self-control to such good purpose that by the time she had dressed she was outwardly her usual self. She scarcely remembered when she had found it necessary to control her emotions. There had been no trouble, no excitement, no unpleasantness in her life. It had been ordered for her--tranquil, luxurious, brilliant, varied, yet always the same.  She was not surprised to find the hour late, and was going to make inquiry about her brother when a voice arrested her. She recognized Miss Kingsley's voice addressing some one outside, and it had a sharpness she had not noted before.  “So you came back, did you? Well, you don't look very proud of yourself this mawnin'. Gene Stewart, you look like a coyote.”  “Say, Flo if I am a coyote I'm not going to sneak,” he said.  “What 'd you come for?” she demanded.  “I said I was coming round to take my medicine.”  “Meaning you'll not run from Al Hammond? Gene, your skull is as thick as an old cow's. Al will never know anything about what you did to his sister unless you tell him. And if you do that he'll shoot you. She won't give you away. She's a thoroughbred. Why, she was so white last night I thought she'd drop at my feet, but she never blinked an eyelash. I'm a woman, Gene Stewart and if I couldn't feel like Miss Hammond I know how awful an ordeal she must have had. Why, she's one of the most beautiful, the most sought after, the most exclusive women in New York City. There's a crowd of millionaires and lords and dukes after her. How terrible it'd be for a woman like her to be kissed by a drunken cowpuncher! I say it--”  “Flo, I never insulted her that way,” broke out Stewart.  “It was worse, then?” she queried, sharply.  “I made a bet that I'd marry the first girl who came to town. I was on the watch and pretty drunk. When she came--well, I got Padre Marcos and tried to bully her into marrying me.”  “Oh, Lord!” Florence gasped. “It's worse than I feared.... Gene, Al will kill you.”  “That'll be a good thing,” replied the cowboy, dejectedly.  “Gene Stewart, it certainly would, unless you turn over a new leaf,”  retorted Florence. “But don't be a fool.” And here she became earnest and appealing. “Go away, Gene. Go join the rebels across the border--you're always threatening that. Anyhow, don't stay here and run any chance of stirring Al up. He'd kill you just the same as you would kill another man for insulting your sister. Don't make trouble for Al. That'd only make sorrow for her, Gene.”  The subtle import was not lost upon Madeline. She was distressed because she could not avoid hearing what was not meant for her ears. She made an effort not to listen, and it was futile.  “Flo, you can't see this a man's way,” he replied, quietly. “I'll stay and take my medicine.”  “Gene, I could sure swear at you or any other pig-head of a cowboy. Listen. My brother-in-law, Jack, heard something of what I said to you last night. He doesn't like you. I'm afraid he'll tell Al. For Heaven's sake, man, go down-town and shut him up and yourself, too.”  Then Madeline heard her come into the house and presently rap on the door and call softly:  “Miss Hammond. Are you awake?”  “Awake and dressed, Miss Kingsley. Come in.”  “Oh! You've rested. You look so--so different. I'm sure glad. Come out now. We'll have breakfast, and then you may expect to meet your brother any moment.”  “Wait, please. I heard you speaking to Mr. Stewart. It was unavoidable. But I am glad. I must see him. Will you please ask him to come into the parlor a moment?”  “Yes,” replied Florence, quickly; and as she turned at the door she flashed at Madeline a woman's meaning glance. “Make him keep his mouth shut!”  Presently there were slow, reluctant steps outside the front door, then a pause, and the door opened. Stewart stood bareheaded in the sunlight. Madeline remembered with a kind of shudder the tall form, the embroidered buckskin vest, the red scarf, the bright leather wristbands, the wide silver-buckled belt and chaps. Her glance seemed to run over him swift as lightning. But as she saw his face now she did not recognize it. The man's presence roused in her a revolt. Yet something in her, the incomprehensible side of her nature, thrilled in the look of this splendid dark-faced barbarian.  “Mr. Stewart, will you please come in?” she asked, after that long pause.  “I reckon not,” he said. The hopelessness of his tone meant that he knew he was not fit to enter a room with her, and did not care or cared too much.  Madeline went to the door. The man's face was hard, yet it was sad, too. And it touched her.  “I shall not tell my brother of your--your rudeness to me,” she began. It was impossible for her to keep the chill out of her voice, to speak with other than the pride and aloofness of her class. Nevertheless, despite her loathing, when she had spoken so far it seemed that kindness and pity followed involuntarily. “I choose to overlook what you did because you were not wholly accountable, and because there must be no trouble between Alfred and you. May I rely on you to keep silence and to seal the lips of that priest? And you know there was a man killed or injured there last night. "]]]
