A WOMAN'S JOURNEY ROUND THE WORLD, from Vienna to Brazil, Chili, Tahiti, China, Hindostan, Persia, and Asia Minor.    BY IDA PFEIFFER.  An unabridged translation from the German.    PREFACE.    I have been called, in many of the public journals, a \"professed tourist;\" but I am sorry to say that I have no title to the appellation in its usual sense.  On the one hand I possess too little wit and humour to render my writings amusing; and, on the other, too little knowledge to judge rightly of what I have gone through.  The only gift to which I can lay claim is that of narrating in a simple manner the different scenes in which I have played a part, and the different objects I have beheld; if I ever pronounce an opinion, I do so merely on my own personal experience.  Many will perhaps believe that I undertook so long a journey from vanity.  I can only say in answer to this--whoever thinks so should make such a trip himself, in order to gain the conviction, that nothing but a natural wish for travel, a boundless desire of acquiring knowledge, could ever enable a person to overcome the hardships, privations, and dangers to which I have been exposed.  In exactly the same manner as the artist feels an invincible desire to paint, and the poet to give free course to his thoughts, so was I hurried away with an unconquerable wish to see the world.  In my youth I dreamed of travelling--in my old age I find amusement in reflecting on what I have beheld.  The public received very favourably my plain unvarnished account of \"A Voyage to the Holy Land, and to Iceland and Scandinavia.\" Emboldened by their kindness, I once more step forward with the journal of my last and most considerable voyage, and I shall feel content if the narration of my adventures procures for my readers only a portion of the immense fund of pleasure derived from the voyage by                                           THE AUTHORESS.  Vienna, March 16, 1850.    With the hope that we may forward the views of the authoress, and be the means of exciting the public attention to her position and wants, we append the following statement by Mr. A. Petermann, which appeared in the Athenaeum of the 6th of December, 1851:  \"Madame Pfeiffer came to London last April, with the intention of undertaking a fresh journey; her love of travelling appearing not only unabated, but even augmented by the success of her journey round the world.  She had planned, as her fourth undertaking, a journey to some of those portions of the globe which she had not yet visited--namely, Australia and the islands of the Asiatic Archipelago; intending to proceed thither by the usual route round the Cape.  Her purpose was, however, changed while in London.  The recently discovered Lake Ngami, in Southern Africa, and the interesting region to the north, towards the equator--the reflection how successfully she had travelled among savage tribes, where armed men hesitated to penetrate, how well she had borne alike the cold of Iceland and the heat of Babylonia--and lastly, the suggestion that she might be destined to raise the veil from some of the totally unknown portions of the interior of Africa--made her determine on stopping at the Cape, and trying to proceed thence, if possible, northwards into the equatorial regions of the African Continent.  \"Madame Pfeiffer left for the Cape, on the 22nd of May last, in a sailing vessel--her usual mode of travelling by sea, steamboats being too expensive.  She arrived safely at Cape Town on the 11th of August, as I learned from a letter which I received from her last week, dated the 20th of August.  From that letter the following are extracts:--  \"'The impression which this place (Cape Town) made on me, was not an agreeable one.  The mountains surrounding the town are bare, the town itself (London being still fresh in my recollection) resembles a village.  The houses are of only one story, with terraces instead of roofs.  From the deck of the vessel a single tree was visible, standing on a hill.  In short, on my arrival I was at once much disappointed, and this disappointment rather increases than otherwise.  In the town the European mode of living is entirely prevalent--more so than in any other place abroad that I have seen. I have made a good many inquiries as to travelling into the interior; and have been, throughout, assured that the natives are everywhere kindly disposed to travellers, and that as a woman I should be able to penetrate much farther than a man,--and I have been strongly advised to undertake a journey as far as the unknown lakes, and even beyond.  Still, with all these splendid prospects and hopes, I fear I shall travel less in this country than in any other.  Here, the first thing you are told is, that you must purchase waggons, oxen, horses, asses,--hire expensive guides, etc., etc.  How far should I reach in this way with my 100 pounds sterling?  I will give you an example of the charges in this country:--for the carriage of my little luggage to my lodgings I had to pay 10s. 6d.!  I had previously landed in what I thought the most expensive places in the world--London, Calcutta, Canton, etc.--had everywhere a much greater distance to go from the vessel to my lodgings, and nowhere had I paid half of what they charged me here. Board and lodging I have also found very dear.  Fortunately, I have been very kindly received into the house of Mr. Thaewitzer, the Hamburgh consul, where I live, very agreeably, but do not much advance the object which brought me here.  I shall, in the course of the month, undertake a short journey with some Dutch boers to Klein Williams; and I fear that this will form the beginning and the end of my travels in this country.'  \"From these extracts it will be seen that the resolute lady has at her command but very slender means for the performance of her journeys.  The sum of 100 pounds, which was granted to her by the Austrian government, forms the whole of her funds.  Private resources she has none.  It took her twenty years to save enough money to perform her first journey!--namely, that to the Holy Land. While in London, she received scarcely any encouragement; and her works were not appreciated by the public, or indeed known, till she had left this country.  It is to be regretted that the want of a little pecuniary assistance should deter the enterprising lady from carrying out her projected journey in Southern Africa.  Though not a scientific traveller, she is a faithful recorder of what she sees and hears; and she is prepared to note the bearings and distances of the journey, make meteorological observations, and keep a careful diary--so that the results of her projected journey would perhaps be of as much interest as those of other travellers of greater pretensions.\"    CONTENTS.

On the first of May, 1846, I left Vienna, and, with the exception of slight stoppages at Prague, Dresden, and Leipsic, proceeded directly to Hamburgh, there to embark for the Brazils.  In Prague I had the pleasure of meeting Count Berchthold, who had accompanied me during a portion of my journey in the East.  He informed me that he should like to be my companion in the voyage to the Brazils, and I promised to wait for him in Hamburgh.  I had a second most interesting meeting on the steamer from Prague to Dresden, namely, with the widow of Professor Mikan.  In the year 1817, this lady had, on the occasion of the marriage of the Austrian Princess Leopaldine with Don Pedro I., followed her husband to the Brazils, and afterwards made with him a scientific journey into the interior of the country.  I had often heard this lady's name mentioned, and my joy at making her personal acquaintance was very great.  In the kindest and most amiable manner she communicated to me the results of her long experience, and added advice and rules of conduct, which proved afterwards highly useful.  I arrived in Hamburgh on the 12th of May; and, as early as the 13th, might have embarked on board a fine fast-sailing brig, which, besides, was christened the \"Ida,\" like myself.  With a heavy heart I saw this fine vessel set sail.  I was obliged to remain behind, as I had promised my travelling companion to await his arrival.  Week after week elapsed, with nothing but the fact of my staying with my relatives to lighten the dreariness of suspense; at last, about the middle of June, the Count came, and shortly afterwards we found a vessel--a Danish brig, the \"Caroline,\" Captain Bock, bound for Rio Janeiro.  I had now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],["title","A Woman's Journey Round the World (#1)"],["body","me a long voyage, which could not be made under two months at the least, and which, possibly, might last three or four. Luckily I had already lived for a considerable period on board sailing vessels during my former travels, and was therefore acquainted with their arrangements, which are very different from those of steamers.  On board a steamer everything is agreeable and luxurious; the vessel pursues her rapid course independent of the wind, and the passengers enjoy good and fresh provisions, spacious cabins, and excellent society.  In sailing vessels all this is very different, as, with the exception of the large East Indiamen, they are not fitted up for passengers.  In them the cargo is looked upon as the principal thing, and in the eyes of the crew passengers are a troublesome addition, whose comfort is generally very little studied.  The captain is the only person who takes any interest in them, since a third or even the half of the passage-money falls to his share.  The space, too, is so confined, that you can hardly turn yourself round in the sleeping cabins, while it is quite impossible to stand upright in the berths.  Besides this, the motion of a sailing vessel is much stronger than that of a steamer; on the latter, however, many affirm that the eternal vibration, and the disagreeable odour of the oil and coals, are totally insupportable.  For my own part, I never found this to be the case; it certainly is unpleasant, but much easier to bear than the many inconveniences always existing on board a sailing vessel.  The passenger is there a complete slave to every whim or caprice of the captain, who is an absolute sovereign and holds uncontrolled sway over everything.  Even the food depends upon his generosity, and although it is generally not absolutely bad, in the best instances, it is not equal to that on board a steamer.  The following form the ordinary diet:  tea and coffee without milk, bacon and junk, soup made with pease or cabbage, potatoes, hard dumplings, salted cod, and ship-biscuit.  On rare occasions, ham, eggs, fish, pancakes, or even skinny fowls, are served out.  It is very seldom, in small ships, that bread can be procured.  To render the living more palatable, especially on a long voyage, passengers would do well to take with them a few additions to the ship's fare.  The most suitable are:  portable soup and captain's biscuit--both of which should be kept in tin canisters to preserve them from mouldiness and insects--a good quantity of eggs, which, when the vessel is bound for a southern climate, should first be dipped in strong lime-water or packed in coal-dust; rice, potatoes, sugar, butter, and all the ingredients for making sangaree and potato-salad, the former being very strengthening and the latter very cooling.  I would strongly recommend those who have children with them to take a goat as well.  As regards wine, passengers should take especial care to ask the captain whether this is included in the passage-money, otherwise it will have to be purchased from him at a very high rate.  There are also other objects which must not be forgotten, and above all a mattress, bolster, and counterpane, as the berths are generally unfurnished.  These can be purchased very cheaply in any seaport town.  Besides this, it is likewise advisable to take a stock of coloured linen.  The office of washerwoman is filled by a sailor, so that it may easily be imagined that the linen does not return from the wash in the best possible condition.  When the sailors are employed in shifting the sails, great care must be taken to avoid injury by the falling of any of the ropes.  But all these inconveniences are comparatively trifling; the greatest amount of annoyance begins towards the end of the voyage.  The captain's mistress is his ship.  At sea he allows her to wear an easy neglige, but in port she must appear in full dress.  Not a sign of the long voyage, of the storms, of the glowing heat she has suffered, must be visible.  Then begins an incessant hammering, planing, and sawing; every flaw, every crack or injury is made good, and, to wind up, the whole vessel is painted afresh.  The worst of all, however, is the hammering when the cracks in the deck are being repaired and filled up with pitch.  This is almost unbearable.  But enough of annoyances.  I have described them merely to prepare, in some degree, those who have never been to sea.  Persons residing in sea-port towns do not, perhaps, stand in need of this, for they hear these matters mentioned every day; but such is not the case with us poor souls, who have lived all our lives in inland cities. Very often we hardly know how a steamer or a sailing vessel looks, much less the mode of life on board them.  I speak from experience, and know too well what I myself suffered on my first voyage, simply because, not having been warned beforehand, I took nothing with me save a small stock of linen and clothes.  At present I will proceed with the progress of my voyage.  We embarked on the evening of the 28th of June, and weighed anchor before daybreak of the 29th.  The voyage did not commence in any very encouraging manner; we had very little, in fact almost no wind at all, and compared to us every pedestrian appeared to be running a race:  we made the nine miles to Blankenese in seven hours.  Luckily the slow rate at which we proceeded was not so disagreeable, as, at first, for a considerable period we beheld the magnificent port, and afterwards could admire, on the Holstein side, the beautiful country houses of the rich Hamburghers, situated upon charming eminences and surrounded by lovely gardens.  The opposite side, belonging to Hanover, is as flat and monotonous as the other is beautiful.  About here the Elbe, in many places, is from three to four miles broad.  Before reaching Blankenese the ships take in their stock of water from the Elbe.  This water, although of a dirty and thick appearance, is said to possess the valuable quality of resisting putridity for years.  We did not reach Gluckstadt (37 miles from Hamburgh) before the morning of the 30th.  As there was not now a breath of wind, we were entirely at the mercy of the stream, and began drifting back.  The captain, therefore, ordered the men to cast anchor, and profited by the leisure thus forced upon him to have the chests and boxes made fast on the deck and in the hold.  We idlers had permission granted us to land and visit the town, in which, however, we found but little to admire.  There were eight passengers on board.  The four cabin places were taken by Count B--, myself, and two young people who hoped to make their fortune sooner in the Brazils than in Europe.  The price of a passage in the first cabin was 100 dollars (20 pounds 16s. 8d.), and in the steerage 50 dollars (10 pounds 8s. 4d.).  In the steerage, besides two worthy tradesmen, was a poor old woman who was going, in compliance with the wish of her only son, who had settled in the Brazils, to join him there, and a married woman whose husband had been working as a tailor for the last six years in Rio Janeiro.  People soon become acquainted on board ship, and generally endeavour to agree as well as possible, in order to render the monotony of a long voyage at all supportable.  On the 1st of July we again set sail in rather stormy weather.  We made a few miles, but were soon obliged to cast anchor once more. The Elbe is here so wide, that we could hardly see its banks, and the swell so strong, that sea-sickness began to manifest itself among our company.  On the 2nd of July, we again attempted to weigh anchor, but with no better success than the day before.  Towards evening we saw some dolphins, called also _tummler_, or tumblers, as well as several gulls, which announced to us that we were fast nearing the sea.  A great many vessels passed quickly by us.  Ah! they could turn to account the storm and wind which swelled out their sails, and drove them rapidly towards the neighbouring port.  We grudged them their good fortune; and perhaps we had to thank this specimen of Christian love on our part, that on the 3rd of July, we had not got further than Cuxhaven, seventy-four miles from Hamburgh.  The 4th of July was a beautifully fine day, for those who could remain quietly on shore; but for those on board ship it was bad enough, as there was not the slightest breath of wind stirring.  To get rid of our lamentations, the captain launched out in praises of the charming little town, and had us conveyed to land.  We visited the town, as well as the bathing establishment and the lighthouse, and afterwards actually proceeded as far as a place called the \"Bush,\" where, as we were told, we should find a great abundance of strawberries.  After wandering about, over fields and meadows, for a good hour in the glowing heat, we found the Bush, it is true, but instead of strawberries, discovered only frogs and adders there.  We now proceeded into the scanty wood, where we saw about twenty tents erected.  A bustling landlord came up, and offering us some glasses of bad milk, said that every year a fair is held in the Bush for three weeks, or rather, on three successive Sundays, for during the week days the booths are closed.  The landlady also came tripping towards us, and invited us, in a very friendly manner, to spend the next Sunday with them.  She assured us that we should \"amuse ourselves charmingly;\" that we elder members of the company should find entertainment in the wonderful performances of the tumblers and jugglers, and the younger gentlemen find spruce young girls for partners in the dance.  We expressed ourselves much pleased at this invitation, promised to be sure to come, and then extended our walk to Ritzebuttel, where we admired a small castle and a miniature park.  5th July.  Nothing is so changeable as the weather:  yesterday we were revelling in sunshine, and today we were surrounded by a thick, dark fog; and yet this,"]]]
