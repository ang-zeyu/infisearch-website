If that is true, it is wonderful.  Not a word in the papers yet, but your press is not censored as ours is.  I fancy you know these things in New York before we do, although we are now getting a newspaper from Meaux regularly.  But there is never anything illuminating in it.  The attitude of the world to the Belgian question is a shock to me.  I confess to have expected more active indignation at such an outrage.  Everything is very quiet here.  Our little commune sent two hundred men only, but to take two hundred able-bodied men away makes a big hole, and upsets life in many ways.  For some days we were without bread: bakers gone.  But the women took hold and, though the bread is not yet very good, it serves and will as long as flour holds out.  No one complains, though we already lack many things. No merchandise can come out yet on the railroads, all the automobiles and most of the horses are gone, and shops are shy of staple things.  Really I don't know which are the more remarkable, the men or the women. You may have read the proclamation of the Minister of Agriculture to the women of France, calling on them to go into the fields and get in the crops and prepare the ground for the sowing of the winter wheat that the men on returning might not find their fields neglected nor their crops lost.  You should have seen the old men and the women and the youngsters respond.  It is harvest-time, you know, just as it was in the invasion of 1870.  In a few weeks it will be time to gather the fruit.  Even now it is time to pick the black currants, all of which go to England to make the jams and jellies without which no English breakfast table is complete.  For days now the women and children have been climbing the hill at six in the morning, with big hats on their heads, deep baskets on their backs, low stools in their hands.  There is a big field of black-currant bushes beside my garden to the south.  All day, in the heat, they sit under the bushes picking away.  At sundown they carry their heavy baskets to the weighing-machine on the roadside at the foot of the hill, and stand in line to be weighed in and paid by the English buyers for Crosse and Blackwell, Beach, and such houses, who have, I suppose, some special means of transportation.  That work is, however, the regular work for the women and children. Getting in the grain is not.  Yet if you could see them take hold of it you would love them.  The old men do double work.  Amelie's husband is over seventy.  His own work in his fields and orchard would seem too much for him.  Yet he and Amelie and the donkey are in the field by three o'clock every morning, and by nine o'clock he is marching down the hill, with his rake and hoe on his shoulder, to help his neighbors.  There is many a woman working in the fields to-day who was not trained to it.  I have a neighbor, a rich peasant, whose two sons are at the front.  Her only daughter married an officer in the Engineer Corps. When her husband joined his regiment she came home to her mother with her little boy.  I see her every day, in a short skirt and a big hat, leading her boy by the hand, going to the fields to help her mother.  If you don't think that is fine, I do.  It is only one of many cases right under my eyes.  There are old men here who thought that their days of hard work were over, who are in the fields working like boys.  There is our blacksmith--old Pere Marie--lame with rheumatism, with his white-haired wife working in the fields from sunrise to sunset.  He cheerfully limps up the hill in his big felt slippers, his wife carrying the lunch basket, and a tiny black-and-tan English dog called \"Missy,\" who is the family baby, and knows lots of tricks, trotting behind, \"because,\" as he says, \"she is so much company.\" The old blacksmith is a veteran of 1870, and was for a long time a prisoner at Konigsburg.  He likes nothing better than to rest a bit on a big stone at my gate and talk of 1870. Like all Frenchmen of his type he is wonderfully intelligent, full of humor, and an omnivorous reader. Almost every day he has a bit of old newspaper in his pocket out of which he reads to la dame Americaine as he calls me, not being able to pronounce my name.  It is usually something illuminating about the Germans, when it is not something prophetic. It is wonderful how these old chaps take it all to heart.  All the time my heart is out there in the northeast.  It is not my country nor my war--yet I feel as if it were both.  All my French friends are there, all my neighbors, and any number of English friends will soon be, among them the brother of the sculptor you met at my house last winter and liked so much.  He is with the Royal Field Artillery. His case is rather odd.  He came back to England in the spring, after six years in the civil service, to join the army.  His leave expired just in time for him to reenter the army and see his first active service in this war.  Fortunately men seem to take it all as a matter of course.  That consoles some, I find.  I have just heard that there are two trains a day on which civilians can go up to Paris IF THERE ARE PLACES LEFT after the army is accommodated. There is no guaranty that I can get back the same day.  Still, I am going to risk it.  I am afraid to be any longer without money, though goodness knows what I can do with it.  Besides, I find that all my friends are flying, and I feel as if I should like to say \"good-bye\"--I don't know why, but I feel like indulging the impulse. Anyway, I am going to try it.  I am going armed with every sort of paper--provisional passport from our consul, permis de sejour from my mayor here, and a local permit to enter and leave Paris, which does not allow me to stay inside the fortifications after six o'clock at night, unless I get myself identified at the prefecture of the arrondissement in which I propose to stay and have my passport vised.     X    August 24, 1914.   I seem to be able to get my letters off to you much more regularly than I dared to hope.  I went up to Paris on the 19th, and had to stay over one night.  The trip up was long and tedious, but interesting.  There were soldiers everywhere.  It amused me almost to tears to see the guards all along the line.  We hear so much of the wonderful equipment of the German army.  Germany has been spending fortunes for years on its equipment. French taxpayers have kicked for years against spending public moneys on war preparations.  The guards all along the railroad were not a jot better got up than those in our little commune.  There they stand all along the track in their patched trousers and blouses and sabots, with a band round the left arm, a broken soldier cap, and a gun on the shoulder.  Luckily the uniform and shaved head do not make the soldier.  Just before we reached Chelles we saw the first signs of actual war preparations, as there we ran inside the wire entanglements that protect the approach to the outer fortifications at Paris, and at Pantin we saw the first concentration of trains--miles and miles of made-up trains all carrying the Red Cross on their doors, and line after line of trucks with gray ammunition wagons, and cannons.  We were being constantly held up to let trainloads of soldiers and horses pass.  In the station we saw a long train being made up of men going to some point on the line to join their regiments.  It was a crowd of men who looked the lower laboring class.  They were in their working clothes, many of them almost in rags, each carrying in a bundle, or a twine bag, his few belongings, and some of them with a loaf of bread under the arm.  It looked as little martial as possible but for the stern look in the eyes of even the commonest of them.  I waited on the platform to see the train pull out.  There was no one to see these men off.  They all seemed to realize.  I hope they did.  I remembered the remark of the woman regarding her husband when she saw him go: \"After all, I am only his wife.  France is his mother\"; and I hoped these poor men, to whom Fate seemed not to have been very kind, had at least that thought in the back of their minds.  I found Paris quiet, and every one calm--that is to say, every one but the foreigners, struggling like people in a panic to escape.  In spite of the sad news--Brussels occupied Thursday, Namur fallen Monday--there is no sign of discouragement, and no sign of defeat. If it were not for the excitement around the steamship offices the city would be almost as still as death.  But all the foreigners, caught here by the unexpectedness of the war, seemed to be fighting to get off by the same train and the same day to catch the first ship, and they seemed to have little realization that, first of all, France must move her troops and war material.  I heard it said--it may not be true--that some of the consular officers were to blame for this, and that there was a rumor abroad among foreigners that Paris was sure to be invested, and that foreigners had been advised to get out, so that there should be as few people inside the fortifications as possible. This rumor, however, was prevalent only among foreigners.  No French people that I saw seemed to have any such feeling.  Apart from the excitement which prevailed in the vicinity of the steamship offices and banks the city had a deserted look.  The Paris that you knew exists no longer.  Compared with it this Paris is a dead city. Almost every shop is closed, and must be until the great number of men gone to the front can be replaced in some way. There are streets in which every closed front bears, under a paper flag pasted on shutter or door, a sign saying, \"Closed on account of the mobilization\"; or, \"All the men with the colors.\"  There are almost no men in the streets.  There are no busses or tramways, and cabs and automobiles are rare.  Some branches of the underground are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11011"],["title","A Hilltop on the Marne (#8)"],["body","at certain hours, and the irregular service must continue until women, and men unfit for military service, replace the men so suddenly called to the flag, and that will take time, especially as so many of the organizers as well as conductors and engineers have gone.  It is the same with the big shops.  However, that is not important.  No one is in the humor to buy anything except food.  It took me a long time to get about.  I had to walk everywhere and my friends live a long way apart, and I am a miserable walker.  I found it impossible to get back that night, so I took refuge with one of my friends who is sailing on Saturday.  Every one seems to be sailing on that day, and most of them don't seem to care much how they get away--\"ameliorated steerage,\" as they call it, seems to be the fate of many of them.  I can assure you that I was glad enough to get back the next day.  Silent as it is here, it is no more so than Paris, and not nearly so sad, for the change is not so great.  Paris is no longer our Paris, lovely as it still is.  I do not feel in the mood to do much.  I work in my garden intermittently, and the harvest bug (bete rouge we call him here) gets in his work unintermittently on me.  If things were normal this introduction to the bete rouge would have seemed to me a tragedy. As it is, it is unpleasantly unimportant.  I clean house intermittently; read intermittently; write letters intermittently.  That reminds me, do read Leon Daudet's \"Fantomes et Vivantes\"--the first volumes of his memoirs. He is a terrible example of \"Le fils a papa.\" I don't know why it is that a vicious writer, absolutely lacking in reverence, can hold one's attention so much better than a kindly one can.  In this book Daudet simply smashes idols, tears down illusions, dances gleefully on sacred traditions, and I lay awake half the night reading him,--and forgot the advancing Germans.  The book comes down only to 1880, so most of the men he writes about are dead, and most of them, like Victor Hugo, for example, come off very sadly.  Well, I am reconciled to living a long time now,--much longer than I wanted to before this awful thing came to pass,--just to see all the mighty good that will result from the struggle.  I am convinced, no matter what happens, of the final result.  I am sure even now, when the Germans have actually crossed the frontier, that France will not be crushed this time, even if she be beaten down to Bordeaux, with her back against the Bay of Biscay.  Besides, did you ever know the English bulldog to let go? But it is the horror of such a war in our times that bears so heavily on my soul.  After all, \"civilization\" is a word we have invented, and its meaning is hardly more than relative, just as is the word \"religion.\"  There are problems in the events that the logical spirit finds it hard to face.  In every Protestant church the laws of Moses are printed on tablets on either side of the pulpit.  On those laws our civil code is founded.  \"Thou shalt not kill,\" says the law.  For thousands of years the law has punished the individual who settled his private quarrels with his fists or any more effective weapon, and reserved to itself the right to exact \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" And here we are today, in the twentieth century, when intelligent people have long been striving after a spiritual explanation of the meaning of life, trying to prove its upward trend, trying to beat out of it materialism, endeavoring to find in altruism a road to happiness, and governments can still find no better way to settle their disputes than wholesale slaughter, and that with weapons no so-called civilized man should ever have invented nor any so-called civilized government ever permitted to be made.  The theory that the death penalty was a preventive of murder has long ago been exploded. The theory that by making war horrible, war could be prevented, is being exploded to-day.  And yet--I KNOW that if the thought be taken out of life that it is worth while to die for an idea a great factor in the making of national spirit will be gone.  I KNOW that a long peace makes for weakness in a race.  I KNOW that without war there is still death.  To me this last fact is the consolation.  It is finer to die voluntarily for an idea deliberately faced, than to die of old age in one's bed; and the grief of parting no one ever born can escape.  Still it is puzzling to us simple folk--the feeling that fundamental things do not change: that the balance of good and evil has not changed.  We change our fashions, we change our habits, we discover now and then another of the secrets Nature has hidden, that delving man may be kept busy and interested.  We pride ourselves that science at least has progressed, that we are cleaner than our progenitors.  Yet we are no cleaner than the Greeks and Romans in the days when Athens and Rome ruled the world, nor do we know in what cycle all we know to-day was known and lost.  Oh, I can hear you claiming more happiness for the masses! I wonder.  There is no actual buying and selling in open slave markets, it is true, but the men who built the Pyramids and dragged the stone for Hadrian's Villa, were they any worse off really than the workers in the mines today? Upon my soul, I don't know.  Life is only a span between the Unknown and the Unknowable.  Living is made up in all centuries of just so many emotions.  We have never, so far as I know, invented any new one. It is too bad to throw these things at you on paper which can't answer back as you would, and right sharply I know.  Nothing going on here except the passing now and then of a long line of Paris street busses on the way to the front.  They are all mobilized and going as heroically to the front as if they were human, and going to get smashed up just the same.  It does give me a queer sensation to see them climbing this hill.  The little Montmartre-Saint-Pierre bus, that climbs up the hill to the funicular in front of Sacre-Coeur, came up the hill bravely.  It was built to climb a hill. But the Bastille-Madeleine and the Ternes-Fille de Calvaine, and Saint-Sulpice-Villette just groaned and panted and had to have their traction changed every few steps.  I thought they would never get up, but they did.  Another day it was the automobile delivery wagons of the Louvre, the Bon Marche, the Printemps, Petit-Saint-Thomas, La Belle Jardiniere, Potin--all the automobiles with which you are so familiar in the streets of Paris.  Of course those are much lighter, and came up bravely.  As a rule they are all loaded.  It is as easy to take men to the front, and material, that way as by railroad, since the cars go. Only once have I seen any attempt at pleasantry on these occasions. One procession went out the other day with all sorts of funny inscriptions, some not at all pretty, many blackguarding the Kaiser, and of course one with the inevitable \"A Berlin\" the first battle-cry of 1870.  This time there has been very little of that.  I confess it gave me a kind of shiver to see \"A Berlin--pour notre plaisir\" all over the bus.  \"On to Berlin!\" I don't see that that can be hoped for unless the Germans are beaten to a finish on the Rhine and the allied armies cross Germany as conquerors, unopposed.  If they only could! It would only be what is due to Belgium that King Albert should lead the procession \"Under the Lindens.\" But I doubt if the maddest war optimist hopes for anything so well deserved as that.  I don't dare to, sure as I am of seeing Germany beaten to her knees before the war is closed.     XI    September 8, 1914.   Oh, the things I have seen and felt since I last wrote to you over two weeks ago.  Here I am again cut off from the world, and have been since the first of the month.  For a week now I have known nothing of what was going on in the world outside the limits of my own vision.  For that matter, since the Germans crossed the frontier our news of the war has been meager.  We got the calm, constant reiteration--\"Left wing--held by the English--forced to retreat a little.\" All the same, the general impression was, that in spite of that, \"all was well.\" I suppose it was wise.  On Sunday week,--that was August 30,--Amelie walked to Esbly, and came back with the news that they were rushing trains full of wounded soldiers and Belgian refugies through toward Paris, and that the ambulance there was quite insufficient for the work it had to do.  So Monday and Tuesday we drove down in the donkey cart to carry bread and fruit, water and cigarettes, and to \"lend a hand.\"  It was a pretty terrible sight.  There were long trains of wounded soldiers.  There was train after train crowded with Belgians--well-dressed women and children (evidently all in their Sunday best)--packed on to open trucks, sitting on straw, in the burning sun, without shelter, covered with dust, hungry and thirsty.  The sight set me to doing some hard thinking after I got home that first night.  But it was not until Tuesday afternoon that I got my first hint of the truth. That afternoon, while I was standing on the platform, I heard a drum beat in the street, and sent Amelie out to see what was going on. She came back at once to say that it was the garde champetre calling on the inhabitants to carry all their guns, revolvers, etc., to the mairie before sundown.  That meant the disarming of our departement, and it flashed through my mind that the Germans must be nearer than the official announcements had told us.  While I stood reflecting a moment,--it looked serious,--I saw approaching from the west side of the track a procession of wagons. Amelie ran down the track to the crossing to see what it meant, and came back at once to tell me that they were evacuating the towns to the north of us.  I handed the basket of fruit I was holding into a coach of the train just pulling into the station, and threw my last package of cigarettes after it; and, without a word, Amelie and I "]]]
