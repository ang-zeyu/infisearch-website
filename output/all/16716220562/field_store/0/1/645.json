Stumbling blocks in Eastern Physics     PREFACE   The Editor of the Theosophical Forum in April, 1901, noted the death of Mr. Thomas E. Willson in the previous month in an article which we reproduce for the reason that we believe many readers who have been following the chapters of \"Ancient and Modern Physics\" during the last year will like to know something of the author.  In these paragraphs is said all that need be said of one of our most devoted and understanding Theosophists.  In March, 1901, The Theosophical Forum lost one of its most willing and unfailing contributors.  Mr. T.E. Willson died suddenly, and the news of his death reached me when I actually was in the act of preparing the concluding chapter of his \"Ancient and Modern Physics\" for the April number.  Like the swan, who sings his one song, when feeling that death is near, Mr. Willson gave his brother co-workers in the Theosophical field all that was best, ripest and most suggestive in his thought in the series of articles the last of which is to come out in the same number with this.  The last time I had a long talk with T.E. Willson, he said\"  \"For twenty years and more I was without a hearing, yet my interest and my faith in what I had to say never flagged, the eagerness of my love for my subject never diminished.\"  This needs no comment.  The quiet and sustained resistance to indifference and lack of appreciation, is truly the steady ballast which has prevented our Theosophical ship from aimless and fatal wanderings, though of inclement weather and adverse winds we had plenty.  For many long years Mr. Willson was the librarian of the New York \"World.\"  In the afternoons he was too busy to see outsiders, but, beginning with five o'clock in the afternoon until he went home somewhere in the neighbourhood of midnight, he always was glad to see his friends.  He had a tiny little room of his own, very near the top of the tremendous building, his one window looking far above the roofs of the tallest houses in the district.  There he sat at his desk, generally in his shirt sleeves, if the weather was at all warm, always busy with some matter already printed, or going to be, a quiet, yet impressive and dignified figure.  The elevated isolation, both figuratively and literally speaking, in which T.E. Willson lived and worked, in the midst of the most crowded thoroughfares of New York, always made me think of Professor Teufelsdrockh on the attic floor of \"the highest house in the Wahngasse.\"  The two had more than one point of resemblance.  They shared the loftiness of their point of view, their sympathetic understanding of other folks, their loneliness, and, above all, their patient, even humorous resignation to the fact of this loneliness.  Yet in his appearance Mr. Willson was not like the great Weissnichtwo philosopher.  In fact, in the cast of his features and in his ways, Mr. Willson never looked to me like a white man. In British India I have known Brahmans of the better type exactly with the same sallow complexion, same quick and observant brown eye, same portly figure and same wide-awakeness and agility of manner.  Last summer I heard, on good authority, that Mr. Willson had thought himself into a most suggestive way of dealing with the problems of matter and spirit, a way which, besides being suggestive, bore a great resemblance to some theories of the same nature, current in ancient India.  Consequently Mr. Willson was offered, for the first time in his life, a chance of expressing his views on matter and spirit in as many articles and in as extensive a shape as he chose.  The way he received this tardy recognition of the fact that he had something to say was highly instructive.  He did not put on airs of unrecognized greatness, though, I own, the occasion was propitious;  he did not say, \"I told you so;\"  he simply and frankly was glad, in, the most childlike way.  And now that I have used the word, it occurs to me that \"childlike\" is an adjective the best applied to this man, in spite of his portliness, and his three score and more winters.  Many a pleasant hour I have spent in the small bookroom of the great \"World\" building.  With Mr. Willson talk never flagged.  We discussed the past and the future of our planetary chain, we built plans for the true and wholesome relation of sexes, we tried to find out--and needless to say never did--the exact limit where matter stopped being matter and became spirit;  we also read the latest comic poems and also, from time to time, we took a header into the stormy sea of American literature in order to find out what various wise heads had to say, consciously or unconsciously, in favour of our beloved Theosophical views.  And all this, being interrupted every three minutes or so by some weary apparition from some workroom in the \"World\" with some such question:  \"Mr. Willson, how am I to find out the present whereabouts of this or that Russian man-of-war?  Mr. Willson, what is the melting point of iron?  Mr. Willson, when was `H.M.S. Pinafore' produced for the first time?\" etc., etc.  And every time, Mr. Willson got up in the leisurely manner peculiar to him, reached for some book from the shelves that lined the room, gave the desired information, and as leisurely returned to the \"pranic atom,\" or to \"come and talk man talk, Willy,\" or to whatever our subject chanced to be at the time.  Mr. Willson's gratitude to the Theosophical Forum for its recognition was disproportionately great.  As he wrote to the Editor:  \"give me any kind of work, writing for you, reviewing, manuscript or proof reading, I shall do anything, I shall undertake any job, even to taking editorial scoldings in all good nature, only give me work.\"  His devotion to Theosophical thought and work in all their ramifications was just as great, as was his freedom from vanity, his perfectly natural and unaffected modesty.  At the news of his death many a heart was sincerely sad, but none so sad as the heart of the editor of the Theosophical Forum.  For a friend and co-worker like T.E. Willson, ever ready to give material help and moral encouragement, is not easily replaced.  For a soul so pure of any kind of selfishness the transition from the turmoil of life to the bright dreams of death must have been both easy and enviable. --------------     Chapter One  The Physical Basis if Metaphysics   The Hindu system of physics, on which the metaphysical thought of the East is based, does not in its beginnings differ widely from the latest physics of the West;  but it goes so much farther that our physics is soon lost sight of and forgotten.  The Hindu conception of the material universe, taken from the Upanishads and some open teaching, will serve for an illustration.  They divide physical matter into four kinds--prakriti, ether, prana, and manasa--which they call \"planes.\"  These differ only in the rate of vibration, each plane vibrating through one great octave, with gulfs of \"lost\" octaves between.  The highest rate of vibration of prakriti is measured by the thousand, the lowest of the ether by trillions, and the lowest of prana by--never mind; they have, and we have not, the nomenclature.  The earth, they teach, is a globe of prakriti, floating in an ocean of ether, which, as it has the sun for its center of gravity, must necessarily be a globe.  This etheric sun-globe has a diameter of over 300,000,000,000 miles.  All the planets revolve around the sun far within its atmosphere.  The etheric sun-globe revolves on its axis once in about 21,000 years, and this revolution causes the precession of the equinoxes.  This etheric sun-globe is revolving around Alcyone with other etheric globes having suns for their centers and solar systems of prakritic globes within them in a great year of 5,640,000,000 of our common years.  Its orbit has a diameter of 93,000,000,000,000,000 miles.  Beyond the etheric globes, and between them, is a third form of matter called prana, as much rarer and finer than the ether as the ether is rarer and finer than prakriti.  As this prana has Alcyone for a center of gravity, it is necessarily a globe;  and there are many of these pranic globes floating in a vast ocean of manasa--a form of matter as much finer than prana as prana is finer than ether, or ether than prakriti.  With this manasa (which is a globe) the material, or physical, universe ends;  but there are spiritual globes beyond.  The material universe is created from manasa, downward, but it does not respond to or chord with the vibration of the globes above, except in a special instance and in a special way, which does not touch this inquiry.  The physical universe of the ancient (and modern) Hindu physicist was made up of these four kinds or planes of matter, distributed in space as \"globes within globes.\"  Professor Lodge in 1884 put forth the theory that prakriti (physical matter) as we call it, was in its atoms but \"whirls\" of ether.  Since then speculative science has generally accepted the idea that the physical atom is made up of many cubic feet of ether in chemical union, as many quarts of oxygen and hydrogen unite chemically to make a drop of water.  This is an old story to the Hindu sage.  He tells his pupils that the great globe of manasa once filled all space, and there was nothing else. Precisely as on this earth we have our elementary substances that change from liquids into solids and gases, so on this manasic globe there were elementary substances that took the form of liquids, solids and gases.  Its manasic matter was differentiated and vibrated through one octave, as the prakritic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],["title","Ancient and Modern Physics (#1)"],["body","does on the earth.  Its substances combined as that does.  One combination produced prana.  The prana collected, and formed globes.  On these pranic globes the process was repeated, with ether as the result, and the etheric globes formed.  Then the process was repeated on the etheric globes, as the modern scientists have discovered, and prakriti and prakritic globes came into being.  The true diameter of the earth, the ancient Hindu books say, is about 50,000 miles.  That is to say, the true surface of the earth is the line of twenty-four-hour axial rotation;  the line where gravity and apergy exactly balance;  where a moon would have to be placed to revolve once in 86,400 seconds.  Within that is prakriti;  without is ether.  It is also the line of no friction, which does exist between matter of different planes. There is friction between prakriti, between ether, between prana; but not between ether and prana, or ether and prakriti.  Friction is a phenomenon confined to the matter of each plane separately. We live at the bottom of this gaseous ocean--on its floor --21,000 miles from the surface and only 4,000 miles from the center.  Here, in a narrow \"skin\" limited to a few miles above and below us, is the realm of phenomena, where solid turns into liquid and liquid into gas, or vice versa.  The lesson impressed upon the pupil's mind by Hindu physics is that he lives far within the earth, not on it.  There is a comparatively narrow \"skin\" of and for phenomena within the etheric sun-globe, say the Eastern teachers, where the etheric solids, liquids, and gases meet and mingle and interchange.  Within this \"skin\" are all the planets--the \"gaseous\" atmosphere of the etheric globe stretching millions of miles beyond the outermost planetary orbit.  The earth is in this skin or belt of etheric phenomena, and its ether is in touch with the ether \"in manifestation\" on the etheric globe.  The sun and other etheric globes are within the corresponding \"skin\" of phenomena of the pranic globes.  The prana, manifesting as solid, liquid, and gas, or in combination and in forms, is in perfect touch with that of the etheric globe, and through that with the prana of the earth.  That our prana is in touch with that on the pranic globe in all its manifestations means much in metaphysics. The same is true of the manasic globe, and of our manasa.  The great lesson the Eastern physics burns into the pupil is that we are living not only within the prakritic earth, but within each of the other globes as well in identically the same way and subject to the same laws.  Our lives are not passed on one globe, but in four globes.  It is as if one said he lived in Buffalo, Erie county, New York, United States;  that he was a citizen of each and subject to the laws of each.  This question of the four globes, of the four planes of matter, of the four skins, and of the four conditions or states of all matter and necessarily of all persons, from the purely material standpoint, is not only the foundation of Oriental physics, but the very essence of Oriental metaphysics--its starting-point and corner-stone.  To one who carries with him, consciously or unconsciously, the concrete knowledge of the physics, the abstract teaching of the metaphysics presents no difficulty;  it is as clear as crystal.  But without the physical teaching the metaphysical is not translatable.  Our Western physics teaches that physical matter is divided into two kinds prakriti (commonly called \"physical matter\") and ether; that the differences of each of the elementary prakritic substances (iron, copper, sulphur, oxygen) are in their molecules, the fundamental atom being the same;  that each of these elementary substances vibrates only through one octave, though on different keys;  that it changes from solid to liquid and gas as the rate of vibration is increased and from gas to liquid and solid as its vibration is decreased within its octave; that the ether obeys identical laws;  that it has elementary substances vibrating through one octave only, and that these are solids, liquids, or gases on the etheric plane as prakriti is on this;  that these etheric substances change and combine in every way that prakriti does;  and that while all our prakritic substances vibrate within (say) fifty simply octaves, the lowest vibration of etheric matter begins over one thousand octaves beyond our highest, making a gulf to leap.  The Eastern physics presents this with a wealth of detail that dazes the Western student, and then adds:  \"But beyond the etheric plane (or octave) of vibration for matter there is a third plane (or octave) of vibration called prana and beyond that a fourth called manasa.  What is true of one plane is true of the other three. One law governs the four.  As above so below.  There is no real gulf;  there is perfect continuity.\"  The Western scientist teaches as the foundation of modern physics that \"each and every atom of prakritic matter is the center of an etheric molecule of many atoms;\"  that \"no two prakritic atoms touch,\" although their etheric envelopes or atmospheres do touch; and that \"all physical phenomena are caused by the chording vibration of the prakritic atom and its envelope of ether,\" each \"sounding the same note hundreds of octaves apart.\"  The \"solid earth\" with its atmosphere represents the atom with its ether. As all the oxygen and hydrogen do not combine to make the drop of water, some remaining in mechanical union to give it an atmosphere, and about one-fourth of its bulk being gas, so the atom formed of the ether does not use all the ether in its chemical union, retaining some in mechanical union for its envelope or atmosphere.  The Hindu physics goes much farther along this road.  It says that, when the pranic globes were formed, each atom of prana had its manasic envelope--was the center of a manasic molecule. When the etheric globes formed, each atom of ether was the center of a pranic molecule, each atom of which was surrounded with manasa.  When the prakriti was formed from the ether, each and every atom of prakriti had the triple etheric-pranic-manasic envelope.  \"Each and every prakritic atom is the center of an etheric molecule,\" says our Western science;  but that of the East adds this:  \"And each atom of that etheric molecule is the center of a pranic molecule, and each atom of prana in that pranic molecule is the center of a manasic molecule.\"  The four great globes of matter in the material universe are represented and reproduced in each and every atom of prakriti, which is in touch with each one of the four globes and a part of it.  The same is true of any aggregation of prakriti--of the earth itself and of all things in it, including man.  As there are four atoms in each one, so there are four earths, four globes, consubstantial, one for each of the four elements, and in touch with it.  One is formed of prakritic atoms--the globe we know; another, of the ether forming their envelopes;  another, of the prana envelopes of ether, and a fourth of the manasa around the pranic atom.  They are not \"skins\";  they are consubstantial. And what is true of atoms or globes is true of animals.  Each has four \"material\" bodies, with each body on the corresponding globe --whether of the earth or of the Universe.  This is the physical basis of the famous \"chain of seven globes\" that is such a stumbling-block in Hindu metaphysics.  The spirit passes through four to get in and three to get out--seven in all.  The Hindu understands without explanation.  He understands his physics.  The Hindu physics teaches, with ours, that \"the ether is the source of all energy,\" but, it adds, \"as prana is the source of all life, and manasa of all mind.\"  \"When the prakritic atom is vibrating in chord with its etheric envelope,\" say our textbooks, \"we have physical phenomena --light, heat, electricity.\"  \"Yes,\" says the Hindu teacher;  \"but when the atom and its ether and its prana are vibrating in chord, we have life and vital phenomena added to the energy.  When the atom and its ether, prana, and manasa are vibrating in chord, we have mind and mental phenomena added to the life and energy.\" Each atom has energy, life, and mind in posse.  In the living leaf the prakriti, ether, and prana are sounding the threefold silver chord of life.  In the animal, the manasa is sounding the same note with them, making the fourfold golden chord of mind.   Even in the plant there may be a faint manasic overtone, for the potentiality of life and mind is in everything.  This unity of the physical universe with the physical atom, and with all things created--earth, animal, or crystal--is the physical backbone of Oriental metaphysics.  Prakriti, ether, prana, and manasa are in our vernacular the Earth, Air, Fire, and Water of the old philosophers--the \"Four Elements.\"  The Oriental physics has been guarded most jealously.  For many thousands of years it has been the real occult and esoteric teaching, while the Oriental metaphysics has been open and exoteric.  It could not be understood without the key, and the key was in the physics known only to \"the tried and approved disciple.\"  A little has leaked out--enough to whet the appetite of the true student and make him ask for more.     Chapter Two  The Two Kinds of Perception   To the savage, matter appears in two forms--solid and liquid. As he advances a step he learns it has three forms--solid, liquid and gas.  He cannot see the gas, but he knows it is there.  A little further on he learns that matter as he knows it is only a minute portion of the great universe of matter--the few chords that can be struck on the five strings of his senses, and limited to one octave or key.  Whether the particular matter he investigates has a solid, a liquid, or a gaseous form depends upon its rate of vibration.  If it is a liquid, by raising its rate of vibration one third it becomes a gas;  by reducing it one third it becomes a solid."]]]
