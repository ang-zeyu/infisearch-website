We crawled across some temporary beams reconstructed by Belgian engineers, and entered the ruins with a handful of Termonde's citizens who had come back for the first time to see what was left of their homes.  \"I will take you to the center,\" said Verhagen.  \"That is where my house was.\"  A quarter of a mile behind us, as the alderman sat upon a rock beside the gravestone, lay the thin neck of the Upper Scheldt, less than one hundred yards wide at this point, where it curved between the lines of charred and flattened buildings.  We could still see the rush of water tumbling and splashing through the wreckage of the bridge we had just crossed.  Twice it had been dynamited and twice rebuilt in part, so that at present a single line of slippery beams, suspended a few feet above the water and supported by some heavy wire, was all that remained between ourselves and the retreating road to Ghent.  From the direction of Alost came the desultory boom of German guns; across the stream behind us the Belgian outposts whiled away the time with cigarettes and cards.  Shaggy horses dozed against the gun trucks, and the men of artillery, some stretched at full length in the sun, others sitting bolt upright with arms folded, slept soundly on the gun carriages.  We could hear the stream gurgling.  We could hear the creak of a lazy windmill, and, coming somewhere from the smoking piles, the hideous howl of starving hounds.  Of other human sounds there were none except the voice of Verhagen.  Ten days before Termonde had been a thriving town; that day it was a heap of smouldering ashes.  America had heard a good deal about Tirlemont and Louvain, but not much of Termonde.  Because this was a war of millions, it did not count in the news--for it was only a community of twelve thousand inhabitants, as pretty and quaint as the province of Flanders boasts, the prosperous center of its rope and cordage manufacture, with fifteen hundred houses, barracks, two statues, a town-hall, five churches, an orphan asylum, and a convent.  Now only one of the churches stood, as well as the building where the officers were quartered, the Museum of Antiquity, and perhaps a dozen others.  Across the moat, which led to the gateway of what were formerly the inner fortifications, were piles of rotting horseflesh. The bronze statue of De Smet, the Jesuit missionary, looked calmly on the scene.  All the rest was blotted out.  There was no sign of hot-tempered impetuous work of a handful of drunken Uhlans, a fire started in anger and driven by the wind throughout the entire town. There was not a breath of wind.  That the night was calm was shown by the fact that here and there single houses, even houses built of boards, were spared at the commander's word.  The convent was burnt and pillaged, stones and mortar littered the street in front of the Hotel de Ville, and upon the sidewalk lay the famous bells which came crashing to the street below when shells burst in the belfry. From cellar to garret nearly every remaining house was systematically drenched with naphtha and the torch applied, and when all was over hundreds of gallons were tossed into the River Scheldt.  Over a small group of houses in the poorer section of the city, where the prostitutes were quartered, grim Prussian humor, or perhaps a sense of value received, had prompted the conquerors to write in great white chalk marks in German script, \"Gute Leute.  Nicht brennen!\" (Good people.  Do not burn!)  For an hour we walked through the silence of ashes and stone, stumbling over timber and debris, tangled and twisted wire, a fallen statue, broken bells or the cross-piece of a spire; we made our way through piles of beds, chairs, singed mattresses, and stepped over the carcass of a horse with its belly bloated and flies feasting on its glassy eyes.  We entered an apothecary shop where the clock still ticked upon the counter.  Thinking there could be no reason of war to call for the destruction of the orphan asylum, we entered its portals to investigate.  Before us lay burnt beds and littered glass.  We searched what ten days before had been a convent, and crawled over heaps of logs and brick into narrow alleys that reminded one of Naples or Pompeii--alleys where the walls stood so close as to hide the light of sun but not the odor of charred vats and sewage and smouldering, smelling things, long dead.  Not far from there the way widened into the light, and before us, breaking the rays of sunset, stood the cross above a heap of cobblestones.  \"They are buried here,\" said Verhagen, \"and here too is my house.\"  Another alderman, a friend of Verhagen, who had been allowed to remain in Termonde most of the four days that the Germans stayed, had the story detailed in his little pocket diary.  On Thursday, September 3, he said, he was just leaving his rope and twine factory when he heard the sounds of musketry to the south.  A small force of Belgian outposts were completely surprised by a part of the Ninth German Army Corps under General von Boehn.  They were completely outclassed.  Before retreating, however, they let the enemy have a couple of volleys.  In the return fire they lost six of their men.  They then retreated into the town and across the bridge.  Nothing happened after dark, but the next morning at nine o'clock the cannonading started.  Inside of half an hour, according to the villagers, the entire German force of the One Hundred and Sixty-second and One Hundred and Sixty-third Uhlans and the Ninetieth Regiment of infantry of the Ninth Army Corps were in the town.  They entered simultaneously by three different roads.  The burgomaster was ordered immediately to provide rations for the regiment.  But the burgomaster was away.  He was given twelve hours to return.  When he did not return, the burning began, according to the townspeople.  \"The soldiers did not wish to burn the town,\" said one man; \"but the orders were orders of war.\" He recounted that four Uhlans entered his house with a bow, and a knock at the door, politely helped themselves to his cellar, drank a toast to his wife, put his chairs in the street, and sat there playing his phonograph.  They said they were sorry, but the house must be burnt.  But before pouring on the naphtha and lighting the flame they freed his canary bird.  Verhagen and the priest agreed that fright brought on an attack to a woman about to become a mother, and that she fell in the Rue de l'Eglise. A German lieutenant saw the trouble, put her on a stretcher made of window shutters, and called the German army doctor.  She was sent to a field hospital and tenderly cared for until she and the child could be moved.  Such incidents in strange relief, told by men who had lost everything, lent corroboration, if such were necessary, to the burden of their story of the relentless destruction of the town itself.  Our little band was the first to enter the ruins of Termonde after its abandonment by the Ninth German Army Corps.  And by a coincidence, we were the last to leave.  That very evening, at precisely the time we were crawling across the broken timbers that spanned the Scheldt and connected us with Belgium-owned Belgium, the Germans again pumped heavy artillery fire into the town.  This was later known as the second German bombardment and occupation of Termonde.  Because of superior artillery range, the attack had the cruel advantage of the man who can strike and still stay out of reach.  On that evening at six-thirty, the Teutons sent a few warning shells into the debris, and then the first column of scouts entered simultaneously by the two southern gates.  It was just at six-thirty that our party started back for Ghent.  As we crawled across on all fours the remaining beams cracked beneath our feet and the Belgian engineers called on us to hurry. \"Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber,\" we thought as the last of us got across; but unlike Horatius at the bridge, we were on the right side when engineers applied the match to a small charge of dynamite, and the beams crashed and the remaining planks of Termonde's bridge writhed and twisted in the rushing waters.  Twenty-seven miles away, when we whirled through the gates of Ghent later in the evening, we said \"Au revoir\" to Verhagen and the mendicant priest, and went to our rooms.  At midnight came a rap at the door; my gray-haired alderman broke into the room, bursting with the latest news, his eyes aflame with excitement.  \"Revanche!\" he exclaimed dramatically; \"our enemies have paid for it in blood!\"  Sure enough, after a few preliminary shells--a sort of here-we-come salvo--the head of the German column had entered, and a party of staff officers, for purposes of reconnaissance, immediately mounted the spire of the only remaining church.  The officers of the Ninth German Army Corps swept the landscape with their glasses, but the level plains gave nothing to their sight.  They saw only the ashes of Termonde, the river, and the straight stretch of sandy roads and stucco hamlets beyond.  They did not notice a valley of covered ground and a quarter-mile stretch of trees and shrubbery, where three squads of Belgian field artillery were neatly hidden.  Here the men took cover at the first sound of cannonade.  Quietly in their retreat the Belgian artillery officers had figured the range and elevation of the cathedral tower, not over fifteen hundred yards away.  Just as darkness was setting in and the figures in the belfry were clearly visible, the battery sergeant sharply dropped his arm.  \"C-r-r-m-p-h!\" coughed the field pieces as the gunners drew the levers home.  There were four sharp reports, four flashes of flame and smoke, the crescendo moan of tons of flying steel--and the church tower, the bells, and the German officers came crashing to the ground.

We had looked upon the ear-marks and horrible results of battles; had heard guns, smelt the blood and ether of wounded, and seen the ruins over which had rolled the wave of battle.  We knew that ahead of us there had been much fighting in the Sempst-Alost-Vilvorde- Tirlemont region.  The Germans at that moment, if not actually advancing toward Antwerp, were skirmishing and making feints in every direction, with the ultimate disposition of their forces carefully concealed.  Of course, we had no official permission to be at the front with either army; in fact, up to that point we had received nothing but official threats on the subject of what would happen to us in case we went ahead.  But as no one did more than threaten, we kept on going, since we preferred that mode of procedure to sitting around in Paris or Berlin on the chance of one of those \"personally conducted\" tours of inspection, whose purpose is to show the correspondent everything except actual fighting.  It was our hope during that early part of the war to see as much as possible of the German army, realizing that, if captured, we should undoubtedly be sent either backward or forward along the German line of communication in conquered Belgium.  Once within the German outposts we pleaded like Brer Rabbit not to be thrown into the German brier patch.  So of course we landed in it.  After a few days in Brussels they shipped us Eastward to Aix-la-Chapelle by way of Lou-vain, Tirlemont, and Liege.  It was two days after the second bombardment of Termonde--at 7 A.M., to be exact--that Luther and I started from Ghent for Brussels in a military automobile, the property of the Belgian Government, and again loaned for the occasion to Julius Van Hee, American Vice- Consul, then Acting Consul at Ghent.  We carried with us a United States Government mail pouch, a packet of mail from Dr. Henry van Dyke, at The Hague, addressed to Brand Whitlock, the American Minister at Brussels, and another packet of mail from Henry W. Diederick, United States Consul-General at Antwerp.  Mr. Van Hee hoped to obtain from the German authorities in Brussels some smallpox vaccine to take back to Ghent, where a smallpox epidemic was feared.  Once out of the town limits of Ghent we bowled along at top speed, with the American colors trembling fore and aft and impressive- looking signs pasted on windshield and side-flaps.  The autumn rains descended heavily upon us, drenching everything except the carefully protected mail bags.  Six miles southeast of Ghent, we ran into a regiment of Belgian infantry moving back from the direction of Brussels, and farther on a squad of cavalry and some more cavalry outposts; then two companies of bicycle patrol, the men with their heads bent over the handlebars, Mausers slung over their shoulders, pedaling heavily through the mud and slush of a cold September storm.  A few mitrailleuses, known as the Minerva type, and mounted on armored motor-cars, were trained on the ravine through which the road dipped a thousand yards ahead of us.  They had sighted the German outposts on the crest of a hill opposite us about three quarters of a mile away.  In a very poor kind of trench, hastily constructed in the beet-fields, and little more than body deep, the men lay on their bellies in the mud, nervously fingering their muskets and adjusting the sights.  A third company of bicycle scouts were ordered to advance for the purpose of drawing fire.  I doubt if that particular body of men had ever before been under fire. Never was the fear of death more plainly written on human face.  All of the men went ahead without flinching or failing, but the muscles of their jaws were knotted, their faces were the color of chalk, and one or two dismounted for a moment, subject to the physical effects of fear.  I have seen men tremble before important physical contests: Jeffries, stepping into the prize ring at Reno, Nevada, ready for the beating of his life and the loss of reputation.  I have seen murderers condemned to death.  Charles Becker, as I watched him taking his death sentence that evening in the Criminal Courts Building, did not give one the same uncanny feeling as this handful of Belgian scouts pedaling out to meet the German fire.  I do not intend to say the Belgians were not brave men, for this was an isolated instance.  And indeed there was something gruesome about that little company offered for the slaughter, simply for the purpose of locating the German batteries.  The men understood the meaning of the order and appreciated the odds against them.  The mitrailleuses pointed down the road we were headed on, and the Belgian gun-captain told us they were going to clean things up as soon as their own scouts drew fire and the first Teuton helmet appeared above the crest.  Naturally we were ordered back.  Had we continued on this road we should have been between the Belgian fire behind and the German fire in front, for the Germans would undoubtedly have mistaken us for a scouting party in an armored car. As it was, Luther jumped to the wheel and insisted on seeing the thing through.  We went ahead for about half a mile.  I told him that if the shrapnel began to burst too close he would find me tucked safely underneath the car examining the gasoline tanks or in the nearest farmhouse cellar, and I believe he would have. But nothing came close to us on that occasion.  My real \"baptism\" was reserved for another day, because Van Hee suddenly wrenched the wheel from Luther and turned our machine down a side road.  It was a case of out of the firing line into the frying-pan, for the side road led us into a trap from which there was no turning back--the territory patrolled by the burly pickets of the Ninth German Army Corps, forming part of the Kaiser's army of occupation in Brussels.  Out of earshot, and certainly out of sight of that skirmish, we were speeding at a great rate along a level, lonely road flanked by beet-fields and long lines of graceful elms that shook hands overhead, when:  \"HALT! WOHIN? WO GEHEN SIE?\" rang suddenly out of the darkness as two figures jumped from behind a farmhouse and leveled their rifles at us.  I shall always remember that sharp command as the cold, gray muzzles followed us like a sportsman covering a bevy of quail. Our fat Belgian chauffeur, violinist in times of peace, and posing that day as an American,--one of those men who look as if they would bleed water if you pricked them with a bayonet,--needed no second warning.  Running the German gauntlet was not precisely his hobby. Down went the emergency brake and the car jolted to a sudden halt.  A bristle-whiskered German giant under a canvas-covered helmet stuck his head through the flaps, and for more than ten minutes he and another sentinel searched our knapsacks and credentials and inspected the Government mail pouches which we carried.  The sentries were far from satisfied.  We said little at first, realizing, nevertheless, that we had run between the opposing trenches and up to the German outposts without actually drawing fire.  That, at least, was something of a comfort.  Then, as if the answer was the price of admission, the big one asked us if we had seen many British soldiers around Antwerp and Ghent. We had previously decided that the answer to such talk was, \"None of your business.\" But the fellow's bayonet was infernally bright and sharp and his countenance like ice.  It wasn't only the equinoctial rain that made us shiver.  While I was trying to limber up my German vocabulary he passed us along to his Ober-leutenant in the hut along the roadside.  The Ober- Ieutenant was grave.  He said we must report to army headquarters in Brussels, and that under no circumstances should we be allowed to return within the Belgian lines.  In this way began our eight days' confinement within the lines of the German Army of the North under General von Boehn.  Just as we had been warned repeatedly, so we discovered in reality that to cross between two opposing lines was no joking matter.  Bad enough, particularly in the early days of the war, to a correspondent without permission at the front.  To work up from the rear (if you had permission) was at least according to the rules of the game.  But to cross between hostile armies--that was the one forbidden act.  The fact that we were with an American Consul was not sufficient.  Three days later Van Hee was allowed to return, but the remainder of the party, that is to say, Willard Luther and myself, were given a free trip into German territory and incidentally more than a week's chance to study the German army from within.  Those next eight days Luther and I spent as willing and, on the whole, decently treated captives within the lines of the German Army of the North, talking freely with cultivated officers and grimy men of the ranks, and in this way learning much of the German war machine, the opinions of the officers and the men at their command.  It would be interesting to tell how in Brussels we dodged from War Office to cafe, from cafe to consulate, from consulate back to War Office, and later were worried and watched and suspected; how we were shipped back across the German border on a combination Red Cross and ammunition train; how we were locked for much of the night in a half-mile tunnel of the northern Vosges Mountains, and there, in the groping darkness of our box-car prison, shared the soldier's biscuit and his bottle, so coming to know the Kaiser's private as a companion and not as the barbarian his enemies paint him.  The day after we got inside the German lines we went before Major Heinrich Bayer, at that time military commandant in Brussels in the absence of General von der Goltz.  Jostling through the street and jamming the courtyard of the War Office was a crowd of a thousand persons--mothers, children, whole families begging for relief or"]]]
