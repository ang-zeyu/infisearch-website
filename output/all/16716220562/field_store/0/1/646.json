It is known to us only by its vibration in that octave.  Each kind of matter has a different octave--is set on a higher or lower key, so to speak, but all octaves of vibration are between the highest of hydrogen gas and the lowest of carbon.  In mechanical compounds, such as air or brass, the rate of vibration of the compound is the least common multiple of the two or more rates.  In chemical compounds, such as water or alcohol, the rate is that of the highest, the others uniting in harmonic fractions.  All matter as we know it through our senses--prakriti, as it is called in the Secret Doctrine to distinguish it from non-sensual matter--is the vibration of an universal Something, we do not know what, through these different octaves.  The elementary substances (so-called) are one and the same thing--this Something--in different keys and chords of vibration;  keys that run into one another, producing all sorts of beautiful harmonies.  Taking any one of these elements, or any of their compounds, all we know of it is limited strictly to its changes during vibration through one octave.  What happens when the vibration goes above or below the octave has not yet been treated hypothetically.  While some elements are vibrating on higher and some on lower keys, we can consider them all as vibrating within one great octave, that octave of the universal Something which produces sensual matter, or prakriti.  But matter is not confined, we know, to this great octave, although our sensual knowledge of it is strictly confined to it. How do we know it?  Knowledge comes to us in two ways, and there are two kinds of knowledge.  1. That which comes through our senses, by observation and experience.  This includes reasoning from relation.  2. That which comes through intuition--or, as some writers inaccurately say, \"through the formal laws of thought.\"  All the observation and experience of the rising and the setting of the sun for a thousand centuries could only have confirmed the first natural belief that it revolved daily around the earth; nor by joining this experience with other experiences could any deduction have come from our reason that would have opposed it. Not our reason but our intuition said that the sun stood still and the earth revolved daily.  The oldest books in existence tell us that this axial revolution of the earth was not only known in the very dawn of time but that it has been known to every race (except our own of European savages) from before the time thought was first transmitted by writing.  Ask the ablest living geographer or physicist to prove to you that the earth revolves daily and he will reply that it would be the job of his life.  It can be done at great expense and great labor, but that is because we know the answer and can invent a way of showing it, not because there are any observations from which a deduction would naturally follow.  Nearly if not all our great discoveries have come to us through intuition and not from observation and experience.  When we know the lines on which to work, when intuition has given us the KEY, then the observation and experience men prize so highly, and the reason they worship so devoutly, will fill in the details.  The knowledge that flows from observation and the reasoning from the facts it records, is never more than relatively true, it is always limited by the facts, and any addition to the facts requires the whole thing to be restated.  We never know all the facts;  seldom even the more important;  and reason grasps only details.  Lamarck's theory of evolution, known to all Asiatic races from time immemorial, was the intuitional and absolute knowledge that comes to all men when they reach a certain stage of development. Reason could never have furnished it from the facts, as Cuvier proved in the great debate in the French Academy in 1842, when he knocked Lamarck out, for the time being, because \"it did not conform to the facts, and did not follow from any relation of the facts.\"  Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence, as an explanation of the origin of species, was from observation and experience.  It was based on observed facts. But Darwin was an evolutionist--a disciple of Lamarck.  He held the Key.  He used the Key.  The value of Darwin's work does not lie in his discovering that some bugs have been derived from other bugs and that the intermediate bugs have died off.  Its overwhelming value to mankind was in showing that work on the theory of evolution was correct work and that the theory was true.  When the intuition of man points out the way the reason of man can follow the path and macadam the road.  It usually does and claims all the credit for itself as the original discoverer.  This knowledge through intuition is absolute and exact.  It is not relatively true.  It is absolutely and invariably true.  No additional facts will ever modify it, or require a restatement.  When Sir William Hamilton based his Logic on the dictum that \"All knowledge is relative, and only relatively true,\" the proposition was self-evidently false.  It was in itself a statement of absolute knowledge about a certain thing.  It was in itself knowledge that was not relative.  All knowledge could not be relative if this knowledge was not.  This knowledge could not be either absolute or relative without upsetting his whole proposition, for, if relative, then it was not always true; and if absolute, then it was never true.  Sir William did not know the distinction between the two kinds of knowledge, and what he meant to say was that \"All knowledge obtained by observation and experience is relative, and only relatively true.\"  His knowledge of this relativity was not obtained by observation or from reason.  It could not possibly have been obtained in that way.  It came from intuition, and it was absolute and exact.  A man may have absolute and exact knowledge and yet not be able to put it into words that exactly express it to another.  Hamilton had this knowledge.  But it was not clearly formulated even in his own mind.  He had two separate and distinct meanings for the word \"knowledge,\" without being conscious of it.  We have yet to coin a proper word to express what comes to us through intuition.  The old English word \"wisdom\" originally did. The old verb \"wis\" was meant what a man knew without being told it, as \"ken\" meant knowledge by experience.  Try and prove by reason that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, or that a part can never be greater than the whole, and your reason has an impossible task.  \"You must take them for axioms,\" it says.  You must take them because you wis them, not because you know (ken) them.  Intuitional knowledge must not be confounded with the relative knowledge that flows through the reason:  that \"If the sum of two numbers is one and their difference is five,\" the numbers are minus two and plus three.  The point cannot be too strongly enforced that there is a distinction between the sources of what we know, and that while all we know through our sensations is only relatively true, that which we know from intuition is invariably and absolutely true. This is seen through a glass darkly, in theology, where intuition is called inspiration and not differentiated from reason.  The false notion that we can only learn by observation and experience, that the concept can never transcend the observation, that we can only know what we can prove to our senses, has wrought incalculable injury to progress in philosophy.  Because our sensual knowledge of matter begins and ends with vibration in one octave it does not follow that this ends our knowledge of it.  We may have intuitional knowledge, and this intuitional knowledge is as susceptible to reason as if we had obtained it by observation.  The knowledge that comes through intuition tells us of matter vibrating in another great octave just beyond our own, which Science has chosen to name the etheric octave, or plane.  The instant our intuition reveals the cause of phenomena our reason drops in and tells us it is the chording vibration of the matter of the two planes--the physical and etheric--that produces all physical phenomena.  It goes further and explains its variations.  This knowledge of another octave or plane of matter comes from the logical relations of matter and its physical phenomena;  but there was nothing in the observation or experience of mankind that would have led us to infer from reason an etheric plane of matter.  It was \"revealed\" truth.  But the flash of revelation having once made the path apparent, the light of reason carries us through all the winding ways.  Our knowledge of the ether is not guess-work or fancy, any more than our geometry is, because it is based on axioms our reason cannot prove.  In both cases the basic axioms are obtained from intuition;  the structural work from reason.  Our knowledge of the ether may be as absolute and exact as our knowledge of prakriti, working on physical as we work on geometrical axioms.  The recognition of the two sources of knowledge, the work of the spirit within us and of the mind within us, is absolutely necessary to correctly comprehend the true significance of the results of modern science and to accept the ancient.     Chapter Three  Matter and Ether   It is not worthwhile translating Homer into English unless the readers of the translation understand English.  It is not worthwhile attempting to translate the occult Eastern physics into the language of our Western and modern physics, unless those who are to read the translation understand generally and broadly what our own modern physics teach.  It is not necessary that they should know all branches of our modern physics in all their minute ramifications;  but it is necessary that they should understand clearly the fundamental principles upon which our scientific"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],["title","Ancient and Modern Physics (#3)"],["body"," technical knowledge of today rests.  These fundamental principles have been discovered and applied in the past fifty years--in the memory of the living.  They have revolutionized science in all its departments.  Our textbooks on Chemistry, Light, Heat, Electricity and Sound have had to be entirely re-written;  and in many other departments, notably in medicine and psychology, they have yet to be re-written.  Our textbooks are in a transition state, each new one going a step farther, to make the change gradual from the old forms of belief to the new, so that even Tyndall's textbook on \"Sound\" is now so antedated, or antiquated, that it might have been written in darkest Africa before the pyramids were built, instead of twenty years ago.  All this change has flowed from the discovery of Faraday that there are two states or conditions of matter.  In one it is revealed by one of our five senses, visible, tangible, smellable, tastable, or ponderable matter.  This is matter as we know it. It may be a lump of metal or a flask of gas.  The second condition or state of matter is not revealed by either of our five senses, but by the sixth sense, or intuition of man. This is the ether--supposed to be \"matter in a very rarefied form, which permeates all space.\"  So rare and fine is this matter that it interpenetrates carbon or steel as water interpenetrates a sponge, or ink a blotting pad.  In fact, each atom of \"physical\" matter--by which is meant matter in the first condition--floats in an atmosphere of ether as the solid earth floats in its atmosphere of air.  \"No two physical atoms touch,\" said Faraday.  \"Each physical atom is the centre of an etheric molecule, and as far apart from every other atom as the stars in heaven from one another.\"  This is true of every form of physical matter, whether it is a lump of metal, a cup of liquid, or a flask of gas;  whether it is a bronze statue or a living man;  a leaf, a cloud, or the earth itself.  Each and every physical atom is the centre of an etheric molecule made up of many atoms of the ether.  This duality of matter was a wonderful discovery, revolutionizing every department of science.  It placed man in actual touch with the whole visible universe.  The ether in a man's eye (and in his whole body) reaches in one unbroken line--like a telegraph wire --from him to the sun, or the outermost planet.  He is not separate and apart from \"space,\" but a part of it.  Each physical atom of his physical body is the centre of an etheric molecule, and he has two bodies, as St. Paul said, a visible physical and an invisible etheric body;  the latter in actual touch with the whole universe.  Faraday went one step further.  He demonstrated that all physical phenomena come from the chording vibration of the physical atom with the surrounding etheric atoms, and that the latter exercise the impelling force on the former.  Step into the sunshine.  The line of ether from the sun is vibrating faster than the ether in the body, but the higher impels the lower, the greater controls the lesser, and soon both ethers are in unison. The physical atoms must coincide in vibration with their etheric envelopes, and the \"note\" is \"heat.\"  Step into the shade, where the ocean of ether is vibrating more slowly, and the ether of the body reduces its vibration.  \"The ether is the origin of all force and of all phenomena.\"  This etheric matter follows identical laws with prakritic matter, or, accurately, the laws of our matter flow from the etheric matter from which it is made.  The ether has two hundred or more elementary substances, each atom of our eighty or ninety \"elements\" being the chemical union of great masses of two or more of the etheric elements or their combinations.  These etheric elementary substances combine and unite;  our elementary substances simply following in their combinations the law which they inherit from their parents.  They take form and shape.  They vibrate through one octave, and take solid liquid or gaseous form in ether, as their types here in our world take it in prakriti, as their vibrations are increased or diminished.  In short, the ether is the prototype of our physical or prakritic world, out of which it is made and a product of which it is.  As this ether is \"physical\" matter, the same as prakriti, one harmonic law covering both, and as this ether fills all space, Modern Science divides physical matter into two kinds, which, for convenience in differentiation, are here called prakritic and etheric.  Matter is something--science does not know or care to know what --in vibration.  A very low octave of vibration produces prakriti;  a very high octave of vibration produces ether.  The vibration of prakriti ends in thousands;  that of ether begins in billions.  Between them there is a gulf of vibrations that has not yet been bridged.  For that reason science divides matter into two \"planes,\" or octaves, of vibration--the matter of this visible and tangible plane being called prakriti and that of the invisible and intangible plane being called etheric.  Across this gulf the two planes respond to each other, note for note, the note in trillions chording when the note in thousands is struck. Note for note, chord for chord, they answer one another, and the minutest and the most complex phenomena are alike the result of this harmonic vibration, that of the ether supplying Force and that of the prakriti a Medium in which it can manifest.  This knowledge of ether is not guesswork or fancy, and, while it is as impossible of proof as the axioms of geometry, it is worthy the same credence and honor.  We are working on physical axioms exactly as we work on geometrical axioms.  Modern science represents each and every prakritic atom as a globe like the earth, floating in space and surrounded by an atmosphere of ether.  \"The subdivision of prakritic matter until we reach etheric atoms chemically united to make the physical unit\" is the correct definition of an atom.  The prakritic physical atom has length, breadth and thickness.  And it has an atmosphere of ether which not only interpenetrates the atom as oxygen and hydrogen interpenetrate the drop of water, but furnishes it with an envelope as the oxygen and hydrogen furnish the drop of water with one.  Each physical atom is the centre of an etheric molecule composed of many etheric atoms vibrating at a greater or lesser speed and interpenetrating the atom.  Each may be considered a miniature earth, with its aerial envelope, the air, penetrating all parts of it.  The etheric plane of matter not only unites with this prakritic plane through the atom but it interpenetrates all combinations of it;  beside the atom as well as through the atom.  The grain of sand composed of many prakritic atoms is also composed of many times that number of etheric atoms.  The grain of sand is etheric matter as well as prakritic matter.  It exists on the etheric plane exactly the same as it exists on the prakritic, and it has etheric form as well as prakritic form.  As each atom of this physical world of ours--whether of land, or water, or air;  whether of solid, liquid or gas--is the centre of an etheric molecule, we have two worlds, not one:  a physical world and an etheric one;  a visible world and an invisible world;  a tangible world and an intangible world;  a world of effect and a world of cause.  And each animal, including man, is made in the same way.  He has a prakritic body and an etheric body;  a visible body and an invisible body;  an earthly body and one \"not made with hands,\" in common touch with the whole universe.     Chapter Four  What a Teacher Should Teach   Let us suppose that a certain wise teacher of physics places a row of Bunsen burners under a long steel bar having a Daniell's pyrometer at one end, and addresses his class (substantially) as follows:  \"At our last lecture we found that the matter of the universe permeated all space, but in two conditions, which we agreed to call physical and etheric, or tangible and intangible.  It is all the same matter, subject to the same laws, but differing in the rate of vibration, the physical matter vibrating through one great octave or plane, and the etheric vibrating through another great octave or plane one degree higher--the chording vibration of the matter of the two planes in one note producing what we call energy or force, and with it phenomena.  \"This is a bar of steel 36 inches long.  It is composed of physical atoms but no two physical atoms touch.  Each physical atom is as far apart from every other atom as the stars in heaven from one another--in proportion to their size.  The atoms and the spaces between them are so small to our sight that they seem to touch.  If we had a microscope of sufficient power to reveal the atom, you would see that no two atoms touch, and that the spaces between them are, as Faraday says, very great in proportion to their size.  I showed you last term that what appeared to be a solid stream of water, when magnified and thrown upon a screen, was merely a succession of independent drops that did not touch.  I can not yet give you proof of the bar of iron being composed of independent atoms, but that is the fault of our instruments, and you must take my word for it until the proof is simplified and made easy of application.  \"Each one of these physical atoms is a miniature world.  It is the center of an ocean of ether, composed of many atoms;  and while no two physical atoms touch, their etheric atmospheres do touch, and any change in the vibration of the etheric atmosphere of one will be imparted to that of the next.  As the vibration of the physical atom must be in harmony with that of its etheric atmosphere, any change coming to one will be imparted to the next, and the next, through the ether surrounding them.  \"You can see that the index at the end of the bar has moved, showing that it is now longer.  That means the etheric atoms are now vibrating"]]]
