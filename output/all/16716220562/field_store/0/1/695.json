When the German people find out what has happened to them and why, that heritage surely ought to show in some reaction against the present autocratic regime, after the War closes, if not before, perhaps even to the extent of making Germany a republic.  That would be some compensation for the waste and destruction of the War. Meantime Germany stands now, ruthlessly, for the dedication of Man to the State.  One can understand why a Prussian minister forbade the teaching of Froebel's ideas in Prussia during the latter period of the educator's life.  So one understands the hatred of Goethe because he refused allegiance to a narrow nationalism and remained cosmopolitan in his world-view.  Similarly Hegel, with his justification of absolute monarchy and his theory of the German state as the acme of all spiritual evolution, was the acclaimed orthodox philosopher of Prussia, while the individualist, Schopenhauer, was neglected and despised.  One must have lived in Germany to realize the absolute control of the State over the individual--the incessant surveillance, the petty regulations, the constant interference with private life.  It was to escape just this vexatious control, with the arduous militarism in which it culminates, that so vast a multitude of Germans left their native land and came to the United States--not all of whom have shown appreciation and loyalty to the free land that welcomed them.     III  THE IDEAS FOR WHICH THE ALLIED NATIONS FIGHT  In contrast to the idea for which Germany now stands, the Anglo-Saxon instinctively and tenaciously believes in the liberty and initiative of the individual.  We, of course, are no longer Anglo-Saxon. When De Tocqueville in 1831 visited our country, surveyed our institutions and, after returning home, made his trenchant diagnosis of our democracy, he could justly designate us Anglo-Americans.  That time is past; we are to-day everything and nothing: a great nation in the womb of time, struggling to be born.  Nevertheless, Anglo-American ideas still dominate and inspire our civilization. It is, indeed, remarkable to what an extent this is true, in the face of the mingling of heterogeneous races in our population. As English is our speech, so Anglo-American ideas are still the soul of our life and institutions.  This is evident in the jealousy of authority.  We resent the intrusion of the government into affairs of private life, and prefer to submit to annoyances and even injustice on the part of other individuals, rather than to have protection at the price of paternalistic regulation by the state. We resent any law that we do not see is necessary to the general welfare, and are rather lawless even then.  This shows clearly in our reaction on legislation in regard to drink.  The prohibition of intoxicating liquor is about the surest way to make an Anglo-Saxon want to go out and get drunk, even when he has no other inclination in that direction.  In Boston, under the eleven o'clock closing law, men in public restaurants will at times order, at ten minutes of eleven, eight or ten glasses of beer or whiskey, for fear they might want them, whereas, if the restriction had not been present, two or three would have sufficed.  Not long ago we saw the very labor leaders who forced the Adamson law through congress, threatening to disobey any legislation limiting their own freedom of action, even though vitally necessary to the freedom of all.  The general behavior under automobile and traffic regulation illustrates the tendency evenmore clearly.  Thinking over the list of acquaintances who own automobiles, one finds it hard to recall one who would not break the speed law at a convenient opportunity.  Even a staid college professor, who has walked the walled-in path all his life: let him get a Ford runabout, and in three months he is exultant in running as close as possible to every foot traveler and in exceeding the speed limit at any favorable chance. These are not beautiful expressions of our national spirit, but they serve to illustrate our instinctive individualism.  Especially are we jealous of highly centralized authority.  De Tocqueville argued that we would never be able to develop a strong central government, and that our democracy would be menaced with failure by that lack.  That his prophecy has proved false and our federal government has become so strong is due only to the accidents of our history and the exigency of the tremendous problems we have had to solve.  The same individualistic spirit is strong in England.  It has been particularly evident, during the War, in the resentment of military authority as applied to labor conditions.  The artisans and their leaders dreaded to give up liberties for which they had struggled through generations, for fear that those rights would not be readily accorded them again after the War. It must be admitted that this fear is justified.  The same spirit was evident in the fight on conscription. This attitude has been a handicap to England in successfully carrying on the War, as it is to us; but it shows how strong is the essential spirit of democracy in both lands.  In France, the Revolution was at bottom an affirmation of individualism --of the right of the people, as against classes and kings, to seek life, liberty and happiness. The great words, _Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,_ that the French placed upon their public buildings in the period of the Revolution, are the essential battle-cry of true democracy,--as it is to be, rather than as it is at present.  Through her peculiar situation, threatened and overshadowed by potential enemies, France has been forced to a policy of militarism, with a large subordination of the individual to the state.  The subordination, however, is voluntary.  That is touchingly evident in the beautiful fraternization of French officers and men in the present War.  With our Anglo-Saxon reserve, we smile at the pictures of grave generals kissing bearded soldiers, in recognition of valor, but it is a significant expression of the voluntary equality and brotherhood of Frenchmen in this War.  The reason France has risen with such splendid courage and unity is the consciousness of every Frenchman that complete defeat in this War would mean that there would be no France in the future, that Paris would be a larger Strassburg, and France a greater Alsace-Lorraine.  While the subordination has been thus voluntary, surely the French soldiers, man for man, have proved themselves the equal of any soldiers on earth.  The anomaly of the first two years of the War was the presence of the vast Russian autocratic empire on the side of the allied democracies. For Russia, however, the War was of the people, rather than of the autocracy at the top, and one saw that Russia would emerge from the War changed and purified.  What one could not foresee was that, under the awakening of the people, Russia could pass, in a day, through a Revolution as profound in its character and consequences as the great explosion in France.  It would be almost a miracle if so complete a Revolution, in such a vast, benighted empire, were not followed by decades of recurrent chaos and anarchy.  If Russia avoids this fate, she will present a unique experience in history. The tendency to abrogate all authority, the spectacle of regiments of soldiers becoming debating societies to discuss whether or not they shall obey orders and fight, are ominous signs for the next period.  Emancipated Russia must learn, if necessary through bitter suffering, that liberty is not license, that democracy is not anarchy, but voluntary and intelligent obedience to just laws and the chosen executors of those laws.  Meantime, whatever her immediate future may be, Russia's transformation has clarified the issue and justified her place with the allied democracies.  However long and confused her struggle, there can be no return to the past, and, in the end, her Revolution means democracy.  Thus, in democracy, the State exists for Man.  Other forms of society seek the interest or welfare of an individual, a group or a class, democracy aims at the welfare, that is, the liberty, happiness, growth, intelligence, helpfulness of _all the people_.  Under all the welter of this world struggle, it is therefore these great contrasting ideas that are being tested out, perhaps for all time.  What is their relative value for efficiency, initiative, invention, endurance, permanence; beneath all, what is their final value for the happiness and helpfulness of all human beings?     IV  MORAL STANDARDS AND THE MORAL ORDER  There is only one moral order of the universe--one range of moral as of physical law.  For instance, the law of gravitation--simplest of physical principles--holds the last star in the abyss of space, rounds the dew-drop on the petal of a spring violet and determines the symmetry of living organisms; but it is one and unchanging, a fundamental pull in the nature of matter itself.  So with moral laws: they are not superadded to life by some divine or other authority.  They are simply the fundamental principles in the nature of life itself, which we must obey to grow and be happy.  If the moral order is one and unchanging, man does change in relation to it, and moral standards are relative to the stage of his growth. History is filled with illustrations of this relativity of ethical standards.  For instance: human slavery doubtless began as an act of beneficence on the part of some philanthropist well in advance of his age.  The first man who, in the dim dawn of history, said to the captive he had made in war, \"I will not kill you and eat you; I will let you live and work for me the rest of your life\": that man instituted human slavery; but it was distinctly a step upward, from something that had been far worse.  Homer represents Ulysses as the favorite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10837"],["title","The Soul of Democracy (#2)"],["body","of Pallas Athena, goddess of wisdom: why?  Baldly stated, because Ulysses was the shrewdest and most successful liar in classic antiquity.  If Ulysses were to appear in a society of decent men to-day, he would be excluded from their companionship, and for the same reason that led Homer to glorify him as the favorite pupil of the goddess of wisdom.  Thus what is a virtue at one stage of development becomes a vice as man climbs to higher recognition of the moral order.  Just because the moral standard is relative, it is absolutely binding where it applies.  In other words, if you see the light shining on your path, you owe obedience to the light; one who does not see it, does not owe obedience in the same way.  If you do not obey your light, your punishment is that you lose the light--degenerate to a lower plane, and it is the worst punishment imaginable.  Thus the same act may be for the undeveloped life, non-moral, for the developed, distinctly immoral.  Before the instincts of personal modesty and purity were developed, careless sex-promiscuity meant something entirely different from what a descent to it means in our society.  When a man of some primitive tribe went out and killed a man of another tribe, the action was totally different morally from .the murder by a man of one community of a citizen of a neighboring town to-day.  This gradual elevation of moral standards, or growth in the recognition of the sacredness of life and the obligation to other individuals, can be traced historically as a long and confused process.  There was a time, in the remote past, when no law was recognized except that of the strong arm. The man who wanted anything, took it, if he was strong enough, and others submitted to his superior force.  Then follows an age when the family is the supreme social unit.  Each member of the family group feels the pain or pleasure of all the others as something like his own, but all outside this circle are as the beasts.  This is the condition among the Veddahs of Ceylon, studied so interestingly by Haeckel.  Living in isolated family groups, scattered through the tropical wilderness: one man, one woman and their children forming the social unit: they as nearly represent primitive life as any other body of people now on the earth.  Then follows a long roll of ages when the tribe is the highest social unit. Each member of the tribe is conscious of the sacredness of life of all the other members and of some obligation toward them; but men of other tribes may be slain as freely as the beasts.  Then comes a period when appreciation of the sacredness of life is extended over all those of the same race, tested generally by their speaking somewhat the same language.  That was the condition in classic antiquity: it was \"Jew and Gentile,\" \"Greek and barbarian\"--the very word \"barbarous\" coming from the unintelligible sounds, to the Greeks, of those who spoke other than the Hellenic tongue.  Even Plato, with all his far-sighted humanism, says, in the _Republic_, that in the ideal state, \"Greeks should deal with barbarians as Greeks now deal with one another.\"  If one remembers what occurred in the Peloponnesian war--how Greek men voted to kill all the men of military age in a conquered Greek city and sell all the women and children into slavery--one will see that Plato's dream of humanity was not so very wide.  From that time on, there has been further extension of the appreciation of the sacredness of life and of the consciousness of moral obligation toward other human beings.  We are far from the end of the path.  Our sympathies are still limited by accidents of time and place, race and color; but we have gone far enough to see what the end would be, were we to reach it: a sympathy so wide, an appreciation of the sacredness of life so universal, that each of us would feel the joy or sorrow of every other human being, alive to-day or to be alive to-morrow, as something like his own.  Moreover, in all civilized society, we have gone far enough to renounce the right to private vengeance and adjustment of quarrels: we live under established courts of law, with organized civil force to carry out their judgments.  This gives relative peace and security, and a general, if imperfect, application of the moral law.     V  THE PRESENT STATE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS  The astounding anomaly of modern civilization is the way we have lagged behind in applying to groups and nations of men the moral laws, universally recognized as binding over individuals.  For instance, about twenty years ago we coined and used widely the phrase, \"soulless corporation,\" to designate our great combinations of capital in industry and commerce.  Why was that phrase used so widely?  The answer is illuminating: we took it for granted that an individual employer would treat his artisans to some extent as human beings and not merely as cog-wheels in a productive machine; but we also took it for granted that an impersonal corporation, where no individual was dominantly responsible, would regard its artisans merely as pieces of machinery, with no respect whatever for their humanity.  The supreme paradox, however, is in the relation of nations: it is there that we have most amazingly lagged behind in applying the moral laws universally accepted in the relations of individuals.  For instance, long before this War began we heard it proclaimed, even proudly, by certain philosophers, in more than one nation, that the state is the supreme spiritual unit, that there is no law higher than its interest, that the state makes the law and may break it at will.  When a great statesman in Germany, doubtless in a moment of intense anger and irritation, used the phrase that has gone all across the earth, \"_scrap of paper_,\" for a sacred treaty between nations, he was only making a pungent practical application of the philosophy in question.  Do we regard self-preservation as the highest law for the individual? Distinctly not.  Here is a crowded theater and a sudden cry of fire, with the ensuing panic: if strong men trample down and kill women and children, in the effort to save their own lives, we regard them with loathing and contempt.  On the other hand, it is just this plea of national self-preservation that the German regime has used in cynical justification of its every atrocity--the initial violation of Belgium, the making war ruthlessly on civil populations, the atrocious spying and plotting in the bosom of neutral and friendly nations, the destruction of monuments of art and devastation of the cities, fields, orchards and forests of northern France, and finally the submarine warfare on the world's shipping.  No civilized human being would, for a moment, think of using the plea of self-preservation to justify comparable conduct in individual life.  Consider international diplomacy: much of it has been merely shrewd and skillful lying.  If you will review the list of the most famous diplomats of Europe for the last thousand years, you will find that a considerable portion of them won their fame and reputation by being a little more shrewd and successful liars than the diplomats with whom they had to deal in other lands.  In other words, their conduct has been exactly on the plane that Ulysses represented in personal life, afar back in classic antiquity.  Take an illustration a little nearer home.  If you were doing business on one side of the street and had two competitors in the same line, across the way, and a cyclone swept the town, destroying their establishments and sparing yours: you, as an individual, would be ashamed to take advantage of the disaster under which your rivals were suffering, using the time while they were out of business to lure their customers away from them and bind those customers to you so securely that your competitors would never be able to get them back.  You would scorn such conduct as an individual; but when it comes to a relation of the nations: during the first two years of the War, from the highest government circles down to the smallest country newspaper, we were urged to take advantage of the disaster under which our European rivals were suffering, win their international customers away from them and bind those customers to us so securely that Europe would never be able to get them back.  Not that we were urged to industry and enterprise--that is always right--but actually to seek to profit by the sufferings of others--conduct we would regard as utterly unworthy in personal life.  If your neighbor were to say, \"My personal aspirations demand this portion of your front yard,\" and he were to attempt to fence it in: the situation is unimaginable; but when a nation says, \"My national aspirations demand this portion of your territory,\" and proceeds to annex it: if the nation is strong enough to carry it out, a large part of the world acquiesces.  The relations of nations are thus still largely on the plane of primitive life among individuals, or, since nations are made up of civilized and semi-civilized persons, it would be fairer to say that the relations of nations are comparable to those prevailing among individuals when a group of men goes far out from civil society, to the frontier, beyond the reach of courts of law and their police forces: then nearly always there is a reversion to the rule of the strong arm. That is what Kipling meant in exclaiming,  \"There's never a law of God or man runs north of fifty-three.\"  That condition prevailed all across our frontier in the early days. For instance, the cattle men came, pasturing their herds on the hills and plains, using the great expanse of land not yet taken up by private ownership.  A little later came the sheep men, with vast flocks of sheep, which nibbled every blade of grass and other edible plant down to the ground, thus starving out the cattle.  What followed?  The cattle men got together by night, rode down the sheep-herders, shot them or drove them"]]]
