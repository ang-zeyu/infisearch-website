The city of his birth was no exception to the rule: since Becquer's death it has made but little effort to requite his deep devotion or satisfy his youthful dreams. You may search \"the bank of the Guadalquivir that leads to the ruined convent of San Jerónimo,\" you may spy among the silvery poplars or the willows growing there, you may thrust aside the reeds and yellow lilies or the tangled growth of morning-glories, but all in vain--no \"white stone with a cross\" appears. You may wander through the city's many churches, but no tomb to the illustrious poet will you find, no monument in any square. His body sleeps well-nigh forgotten in the cemetery of San Nicolás in Madrid.  If you will turn your steps, however, to the _barrio_ of Seville in which the celebrated D. Miguel de Mañara, the original type of _Juan Tenorio_ and the _Estudiante de Salamanca_, felt the mysterious blow and saw his own funeral train file by, and will enter the little street of the Conde de Barajas, you will find on the facade of the house No. 26 a modest but tasteful tablet bearing the words     EN ESTA CASA NACIÓ   GUSTAVO ADOLFO   BECQUER   XVII FEBRERO MDCCCXXXVI.[1]    [Footnote 1: This memorial, which was uncovered on January 10th,   1886, is due to a little group of Becquer's admirers, and especially   to the inspiration of a young Argentine poet, Román Garcia Pereira   (whose _Canto á Becquer_, published in _La Ilustración Artística_,   Barcelona, December 27, 1886, is a tribute worthy of the poet who   inspired it), and to the personal efforts of the illustrious Seville   scholar, Don José Gestoso y Pérez. It is only fair to add here that   there is also an inferior street in Seville named for Becquer.]  Here Gustavo Adolfo Dominguez Becquer opened his eyes upon this inhospitable world. Eight days later he was baptized in the church of San Lorenzo.[1] He was one of a family of eight sons, Eduardo, Estanislao, Valeriano, Gustavo Adolfo, Alfredo, Ricardo, Jorge, and Jose. His father, Don Jose Dominguez Becquer, was a well-known Seville genre painter. He died when Gustavo was but a child of five, too young to be taught the principles of his art; but he nevertheless bequeathed to him the artistic temperament that was so dominant a trait in the poet's genius. Becquer's mother, Doña Joaquina, survived his father but a short time, and left her children orphaned while they were yet very young. Gustavo was but nine and a half years old at the time of his mother's death. Fortunately an old and childless uncle, D. Juan Vargas, took charge of the motherless boys until they could find homes or employment.    [Footnote 1: The following is a copy of his baptismal record:    \"En jueves 25 de Febrero de 1836 años D. Antonio Rodriguez Arenas   Pbro. con licencia del infrascrito Cura de la Parroquial de Sn.   Lorenzo de Sevilla: bautizó solemnemente á Gustavo Adolfo que nació   en 17 de dicho mes y año hijo de José Dominguez Vequer (_sic_) y   Doña Juaquina (_sic_) Bastida su legitima mujer. Fué su madrina Doña   Manuela Monchay vecina de la collación de Sn. Miguel á la que se   advirtió el parentesco espiritual y obligaciones y para verdad lo   firmé.--Antonio Lucena Cura.\" See La _Illustración Artística_,   Barcelona, December 27, 1886, pp. 363-366. Citations from this   periodical will hereafter refer to the issue of this date.]  Gustavo Adolfo received his first instruction at the College of San Antonio Abad. After the loss of his mother his uncle procured for him admission to the College of San Telmo, a training school for navigators, situated on the banks of the Guadalquivir in the edifice that later became the palace of the Dukes of Montpensier. This establishment had been founded in 1681 in the ancient suburb of Marruecos as a reorganization of the famous _Escuela de Mareantes_ (navigators) of Triana. The Government bore the cost of maintenance and instruction of the pupils of this school, to which were admitted only poor and orphaned boys of noble extraction. Gustavo fulfilled all these requirements. Indeed, his family, which had come to Seville at the close of the sixteenth century or at the beginning of the seventeenth century, from Flanders, was one of the most distinguished of the town. It had even counted among its illustrious members a Seville Veinticuatro, and no one who was unable to present proof of noble lineage could aspire to that distinction.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Don Martin Becquer, _mayorazgo_ and _Veinticuatro_, of   Seville, native of Flanders, married Doña Úrsula Díez de Tejada.   Born to them were Don Juan and Doña Mencia Becquer. The latter   married Don Julián Dominguez, by whom she had a son Don Antonio   Domínguez y Becquer, who in turn contracted marriage with Doña Maria   Antonia Insausti y Bausa. Their son was Don Jose Dominguez Insausti   y Bausa, husband of Doña Joaquina Bastida y Vargas, and father of   the poet Becquer.\" The arms of the family \"were a shield of azure   with a chevron of gold, charged with five stars of azure, two leaves   of clover in gold in the upper corners of the shield, and in the   point a crown of gold.\" The language of the original is not   technical, and I have translated literally. See _Carta á M. Achille   Fouquier_, by D. Jose Gestoso y Pérez, in _La Ilustración   Artística_, pp. 363-366.]  Among the students of San Telmo there was one, Narciso Campillo, for whom Gustavo felt a special friendship,--a lad whose literary tastes, like his own, had developed early, and who was destined, later on, to occupy no mean position in the field of letters. Writing of those days of his youth, Señor Campillo says: \"Our childhood friendship was strengthened by our life in common, wearing as we did the same uniform, eating at the same table, and sleeping in an immense hall, whose arches, columns, and melancholy lamps, suspended at intervals, I can see before me still.  \"I enjoy recalling this epoch of our first literary utterance (_vagido_), and I say _our_, for when he was but ten years old and I eleven, we composed and presented in the aforesaid school (San Telmo) a fearful and extravagant drama, which, if my memory serves me right, was entitled Los _Conjurados_ ('The Conspirators'). We likewise began a novel. I wonder at the confidence with which these two children, so ignorant in all respects, launched forth upon the two literary lines that require most knowledge of man, society, and life. The time was yet to come when by dint of painful struggles and hard trials they should possess that knowledge, as difficult to gain as it is bitter!\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Article on Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, by Narciso Campillo,   in La Ilustración Artística, pp. 358-360]  Shortly after the matriculation of young Becquer, the College of San Telmo was suppressed by royal orders, and the lad found himself in the streets. He was then received into the home of his godmother, Doña Manuela Monchay, who was a woman of kind heart and much intelligence. She possessed a fair library, which was put at the disposal of the boy; and here he gratified his love for reading, and perfected his literary taste. Two works that had considerable influence upon him at this time were the Odes of Horace, translated by P. Urbano Campos, and the poems of Zorrilla. He began to write verses of his own, but these he later burned.  \"In 1849,\" says Señor Campillo, \"there were two noteworthy painters in Seville, whose studios were open to and frequented by numerous students, future rivals, each in his own imagination, of the glories of Velasquez and Murillo. One of these studios, situated in the same building as the Museo de Pinturas, was that of D. Antonio Cabral Bejarano, a man not to be forgotten for his talent, and perhaps also for his wit, the delight of those who knew him. The other, situated in an upper room of the Moorish _alcázar de Abdelasis_, near the patio _de Banderas_, was directed by D. Joaquin Dominguez Becquer, a brother and disciple of D. Jose, Gustavo's father.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Narciso Campillo, _loc_. cit.]  In spite of this relationship, Gustavo Adolfo, at the age of fourteen, entered the studio of Bejarano. There he remained for two years, practicing the art of drawing, for which he had a natural talent. He then came under the instruction of his uncle, who, judging that his nephew was even better qualified for a literary than for an artistic career, advised him to follow the former, and procured for him a few Latin lessons. Meanwhile Gustavo continued to enlarge his poetical horizon by reading from the great poets and by the contemplation of the beauties of nature. With his friend Campillo he composed the first three cantos of a poem entitled La _Conquista de Sevilla_, and with him he wandered about the beautiful city of his birth and dreamed such dreams as the one with which this Introduction begins.  Gustavo's godmother, who was a woman in easy circumstances and without children or near relatives, would doubtless have bequeathed to him her property had he fulfilled her wishes and settled down to an honorable mercantile life. But the child, who had learned to draw and to compose almost before he could write, and who had always paled before the simplest problem of arithmetic, could not reconcile himself to such a life. The artist within him rebelled, and at the age of seventeen and a half, feeling the attraction of the capital strong upon him, he bade farewell to the friends of his youth and set out to seek for fame and fortune. It was in the autumn of 1854 that Becquer arrived in Madrid, \"with empty pockets, but with a head full of treasures that were not, alas, to enrich him.\" Here he encountered an indifference that he had not dreamed of; and here he remained in the shadow of oblivion, eking out a miserable existence of physical as well as mental suffering, in utter loneliness of spirit, until he was joined"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10814"],["title","Legends, Tales and Poems (#2)"],["body"," 1856 by one who came to be his lifelong friend and first biographer--Ramón Rodriguez Correa, who had come to the capital with the same aims as Becquer, and whose robust health and jovial temperament appealed singularly to the sad and ailing dreamer. The new-found friend proved indeed a godsend, for when, in 1857, Gustavo was suffering from a terrible illness, Correa, while attending him, chanced to fall upon a writing entitled _El caudillo de las manos rojas, tradición india_. Charmed by its originality in form and conception, he urged his friend to publish it. Becquer acquiesced, and the story was accepted and published by La _Crónica_. The joy of this first success, and perhaps the material aid that resulted, must have had a great deal to do with Gustavo's speedy recovery.  A short time after this he entered with his friend Correa the office of the _Dirección de Bienes Nacionales_ as copyist, at the munificent salary of some $150 a year. The employment was decidedly contrary to his taste, and to amuse his tedium he used often to sketch or read from his favorite poets. One day, as he was busy sketching, the Director entered, and, seeing a group about Gustavo's chair,--for the young artist's sketches were eagerly awaited and claimed by his admiring associates,--stole up from behind and asked, \"What is this?\" Gustavo, suspecting nothing, went on with his sketch, and answered in a natural tone, \"This is Ophelia, plucking the leaves from her garland. That old codger is a grave-digger. Over there...\" At this, noticing that every one had risen, and that universal silence reigned, Becquer slowly turned his head. \"Here is one too many,\" said the Director, and the artist was dismissed that very day.  It cannot be said that he received the news of his dismissal regretfully, for he had accepted the position largely to please a sympathetic friend. Slight as was the remuneration, however, it had aided him to live; and when this resource was removed, Gustavo was again obliged to depend upon his wits. His skill with the brush served him in good stead at this time, and he earned a little money by aiding a painter who had been employed by the Marquis of Remisa to decorate his palace, but who could not do the figures in the fresco.  In 1857, together with other _littérateurs_, Becquer undertook the preparation and direction of a work entitled _Historia de los Templos de España_.[1] Like so many of the author's plans, this work remained unfinished; but from the single volume that appeared can be seen how vast was the scope of the work, and how scholarly its execution. Gustavo is himself the author of some of the best pages contained in the volume, as, for example, those of the Introduction and of the chapters on _San Juan de los_ Reyes. He is likewise the author of many of the excellent sketches that adorn the work, notably that of the _portada_. These sketches, as well as others published elsewhere, show how eminent his work as artist would have been, had he decided to cultivate that field instead of literature.    [Footnote 1: The complete title of the work is _Historia de los   Templos de España, publicada bajo la protección de SS. MM. AA. y muy   reverendos señores arzobispos y obispos--dirigida por D. Juan de la   Puerta Vizcaino y D. Gustavo Adolfo Becquer. Tomo I, Madrid, 1857.   Imprenta y Estereotipia Española de los Señores Nieto y Compañía._]  Essentially an artist in temperament, he viewed all things from the artist's standpoint. His distaste for politics was strong, and his lack of interest in political intrigues was profound. \"His artistic soul, nurtured in the illustrious literary school of Seville,\" says Correa, \"and developed amidst Gothic Cathedrals, lacy Moorish and stained-glass windows, was at ease only in the field of tradition. He felt at home in a complete civilization, like that of the Middle Ages, and his artisticopolitical ideas and his fear of the ignorant crowd made him regard with marked predilection all that was aristocratic and historic, without however refusing, in his quick intelligence, to recognize the wonderful character of the epoch in which he lived. Indolent, moreover, in small things,--and for him political parties were small things,--he was always to be found in the one in which were most of his friends, and in which they talked most of pictures, poetry, cathedrals, kings, and nobles. Incapable of hatred, he never placed his remarkable talent as a writer at the service of political animosities, however certain might have been his gains.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Ramón Rodriguez Correa, _Prólogo_, in _Obras de   Becquer_, vol. I, xvi.]  Early in his life in Madrid, Gustavo came under the influence of a charming young woman, Julia Espín y Guillén.[1] Her father was director of the orchestra in the Teatro Real, and his home was a rendezvous of young musicians, artists, and _littérateurs_. There Gustavo, with Correa, Manuel del Palacio, Augusto Ferrán, and other friends, used to gather for musical and literary evenings, and there Gustavo used to read his verses. These he would bring written on odd scraps of paper, and often upon calling cards, in his usual careless fashion.    [Footnote 1: She later married Don Benigno Quiroga Ballesteros, an   illustrious engineer, congressman, minister of state, and man of   public life, who is still living. She died in January, 1907.]  His friends were not slow in discovering that the tall, dark, and beautiful Julia was the object of his adoration, and they advised him to declare his love openly. But his timid and retiring nature imposed silence upon his lips, and he never spoke a word of love to her. It cannot be said, moreover, that the impression created upon the young lady by the brilliant youth was such as to inspire a return of his mute devotion. Becquer was negligent in his dress and indifferent to his personal appearance, and when Julia's friends upbraided her for her hardness of heart she would reply with some such curt and cruel epigram as this: \"Perhaps he would move my heart more if he affected my stomach less.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Facts learned from conversation with Don Manuel del   Palacio, since deceased.    The editor of this sketch is indebted to the courtesy of the   Exc^{mo}. Sr. D. Benigno Quiroga Ballesteros and to his lately   deceased wife, Doña Julia, the muse of at least some of Becquer's   _Rimas_, for an opportunity to examine a couple of albums containing   some of the poet's verse and a most interesting collection of pencil   sketches, which but confirm his admiration for Becquer's artistic   talent. Here is a list of the sketches:    _First Album:_    Lucia di Lamermoor--Eleven sketches, including frontispiece.    A dream, or rather a nightmare, in which a man is pictured in a   restless sleep, with a small devil perched upon his knees, who   causes to fly as a kite above the sleeper's head a woman in graceful   floating garments.    A fat and jolly horned devil in the confessional box, with a   confessor of the fair sex kneeling at one side, while at the extreme   right two small acolytes point out to each other a suspicious   looking tail that protrudes from beneath her skirts, thus stamping   her as Satan's own.    A belfry window with a swinging bell, and bestriding the bell a   skeleton tightly clutching the upper part of it--ringing the   _ánimas_ perhaps.    Gustavo himself seated smoking, leaning back in his chair, and in   the smoke that rises a series of women, some with wings.    A nun in horror at discovering, as she turns down the covers of her   bed, a merry devil.    A woman's coffin uncovered by the sexton, while a lover standing by   exclaims, \"¡¡Cáscaras!! ¡cómo ha cambiado!\"    A scene at the _Teatro Real_ with Señor Espin y Guillén in a small   group behind the scenes, and a prima donna singing. Actors standing   apart in the wings.    A visit to the cemetery. A skeleton thrusting out his head from his   burial niche, and a young man presenting his card. \"DIFUNTO: No   recibo. VISITANTE: Pues hai (_sic_) queda la targeta (_sic_).\"    A fine sketch of \"Eleonora,\" a stately form in rich   fifteenth-century garb.    A number of sketches of women, knights, monks, devils, soldiers,   skeletons, etc.    _Second Album: Les morts pow rire, Bizarreries dédiées à   Mademoiselle Julie, par G. A. Becker (sic)_.    Fantastic frontispiece of skulls, bones, and leafy fronds, and two   young lovers seated, sketching.    Skeletons playing battledore and shuttlecock with skulls.    A tall slim skeleton and a round short one.    Skeletons at a ball.    A skeleton widow visiting her husband's grave.    The husband returning her visit, and coming to share her lunch in   the park.    A circus of skeletons, in two scenes: (1) Leaping through the hoop.   (2) One skeleton balancing himself, head downward, on the head of   another who is standing.    A skeleton singer on the stage.    A skeleton horse leaping a hurdle.    A skeleton drum-major with his band.    A skeleton bull-fight.    A duel between skeletons.    A tournament on skeleton horses.    A woman recently deceased, surrounded by skeletons offering their   compliments. They are presented by one of their number, with hat in   hand.    A balcony courting scene between skeleton lovers.    The word _FIN_ in bones concludes the series of grotesque and   uncanny sketches, which but emphasize a fact ever present in the   poet's mind--that while we are in life we _are_ in death.]  Finding his devotion to Julia unrequited, Becquer, in a rebellious mood, and having come under the influence of the charms and blandishments of a woman of Soria, a certain Casta Estéban y Navarro, contracted, in or about the year 1861, an unfortunate marriage, which embittered the rest of his life and added cares and expenses which he could ill support. He lived with his wife but a short time, during which period two sons were born to them--Gustavo, whose later career was unfortunately not such as to"]]]
