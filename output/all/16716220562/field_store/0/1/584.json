Do you know,\" she continued, sinking her voice to a whisper, \"I believe there is something the matter with her mind.\"  \"Really!\" said Oh-Pshaw, her voice shaking ever so slightly.  \"She doesn't seem to realize what she is saying, at all,\" said Carmen. \"Do you remember when Dr. Grayson introduced her he said she was real good and pious, but she isn't a bit pious. She didn't bring any Bible with her and she didn't say any prayers before she went to bed.\"  \"Maybe she said them to herself after she was in bed,\" remarked Oh-Pshaw, when she could control her voice again. \"Lots of people do, you know.\"  \"I don't believe she did,\" replied Carmen in a tone of conviction. \"I watched her. She made shadow animals with her fingers on the tent wall in the moonlight the minute she got into bed, and she kept it up until she went to sleep.\"  Out of the corner of her eye Oh-Pshaw saw the Lone Wolf moving toward them, and hastily changed the subject. \"Why did you put your bathing suit on when you didn't have any intention of going into the water?\" she asked, seizing upon the first thing that came into her mind.  \"It looks so well on me,\" replied Carmen. \"Don't you think it does?\"  \"Y-yes, it d-does,\" admitted Oh-Pshaw, her teeth suddenly beginning to chatter, and she realized that she was sitting out too long in her wet bathing suit. \"I g-guess I'll g-go up and get dressed,\" she finished, between the shivers that shook her like a reed.  The Lone Wolf came up to her and taking her own sweater off wrapped it around her and hustled her off toward her tent.  Just then the cry of \"All out!\" sounded on the dock and the swimmers came flocking out of the water with many an exclamation of regret that the time was up.  \"Oh, please, Tiny, may I do this one dive?\" coaxed Bengal from one of the boards on the tower. \"I'm all in a position to do it--see?\"  \"Time's up,\" replied Tiny inexorably, and Bengal reluctantly relinquished her dive and climbed down from the tower.  \"Next test for Sharks a week from today!\" called Tiny in her megaphone voice to the Perches, as she mounted the diving tower in preparation for her own initial plunge. The swimming instructors had their own swimming time after the girls were out of the water.  Gladys and Migwan were dripping their way back to Ponemah, one on either side of Bengal Virden, who was entertaining them with tales of former years at camp, when they were startled to see Miss Peckham standing on top of a high rock wildly waving them back.  \"Don't go near the tent!\" she shrieked.  \"Why not?\" called Migwan in alarm, as the three girls stood still in the path, the water which was dripping out of their bathing suits collecting in a puddle around their feet.  \"There's a snake underneath the tent, a great big snake,\" answered Miss Peckham in terrified tones.  \"Well, what of it?\" demanded Bengal coolly. \"I've seen lots of snakes. I'm not afraid of them. Come on, let's get a forked stick, and let's kill it.\"  She stooped to wring out the water which had collected in the bottom of her bathing suit and then started forward toward Ponemah.  Miss Peckham, high on her rock, raised a great outcry. \"Stay where you are!\" she commanded. \"Don't you go near that tent.\"  Bengal kept on going, looking about her for a forked stick.  \"Bengal _Virden_!\" screamed Miss Peckham, in such a tone of terror that Bengal involuntarily stood still in her tracks, dropping the stick she was in the act of picking up. \"It's a deadly poisonous snake,\" gasped Miss Peckham, beginning to get breathless from fright, \"a monstrous black one with red rings on it. I saw it crawling among the leaves. It reared up and menaced me with its wicked head. Don't you stir another step!\" she commanded as Bengal seemed on the point of going on.  \"What's the matter?\" asked a voice behind them, and there was Miss Judy, just coming out of her tent with her wet bathing suit in her hand.  \"There's a terrible poisonous snake under our tent,\" replied Miss Peckham. \"I was just coming out of the door after my nap when I saw it gliding underneath. It's down there now, under the bushes.\"  \"How queer!\" replied Miss Judy, looking with concern at her wildly excited cousin. \"We've never had large snakes around here. What color did you say it was?\"  \"It had broad, alternate rings of red and black,\" replied Miss Peckham, with the air of one quoting from an authority, \"the distinguishing marks of the coral snake, one of the seventeen poisonous reptiles out of the one hundred and eleven species of snakes found in the United States.\"  \"A coral snake!\" gasped Miss Judy, in real alarm, while the other three, taking fright from the tone of her voice, began to back down the path.  Other dwellers in the Alley came along to see what the commotion was about and were warned back in an important tone by Miss Peckham. The timid ones took to their heels and fled to the other end of camp, while the more courageous hung about as near as they dared come and stared fascinated at the miniature jungle of ferns and bushes that grew under Ponemah to a height of two or three feet. Sahwah, whose insatiable curiosity as usual got the better of her fears, climbed a tree quite close to Ponemah and peered down through the branches, all agog with desire to see the dread serpent show itself.  \"Come down from there--quick!\" called someone in a nervously shaking voice. \"Don't you know that snakes climb trees?\"  \"Nonsense,\" retorted Sahwah. \"Whoever heard of a snake climbing a tree?\"  An argument started below, several voices upholding each side, some maintaining emphatically that snakes did climb trees; others holding out quite as determinedly that they didn't.  \"Anyway, _this_ one might,\" concluded the one who had started the argument, in a triumphant tone.  \"What are we going to do?\" someone asked Miss Judy.  \"I'll get father to come and shoot it,\" replied Miss Judy.  Just then there came an excited shriek from Sahwah. \"It's coming out! I see the bushes moving.\"  The girls scattered in all directions; Miss Peckham, up on her rock, covered her ears with her hands, as though there was going to be an explosion.  \"Here it comes!\"  Sahwah, leaning low over her branch, nearly fell out of the tree in her excitement, as her eye caught the gleam of red and black among the bushes. Miss Judy scrambled up on the rock beside Miss Peckham.  There was a violent agitation of the ferns and bushes underneath Ponemah, a sort of scrambling movement, accompanied by a muffled squeaking, and then a truly remarkable creature bounced into view--a creature whose body consisted of a long stocking, red and black in alternate stripes, in the toe of which some live animal frantically squeaked and struggled, leaping almost a foot from the ground in its efforts to escape from its prison, and dragging the gaudy striped length behind it through a series of thrillingly lifelike wriggles.  \"Hi!\" called Sahwah with a great shout of laughter. \"It's nothing but a stocking with something in it.\"  In reaction from her former alarm Miss Judy laughed until she fell off the rock, and sat helplessly on the ground watching the frantic struggles of the creature in the stocking to free itself. Hearing the laughter, those who had fled at the first alarm came hastening back, and all promptly went into hysterics when they saw the stocking writhing on the ground, and all were equally as helpless as Miss Judy and Sahwah.  \"Only Tiny Armstrong's stocking!\" gasped Miss Judy, wiping away her tears of merriment with her middy sleeve. \"I told her they would cause a riot in camp!\"  Only Miss Peckham did not laugh; she looked crossly around at the desperately amused girls.  \"Oh, Miss Peckham,\" gurgled Bengal, \"you said it reared up and menaced you with its great, wicked h-head! You said its hood was swelled up with ferocity and venom, and it hissed sibilantly at you.\"  Bengal rolled over and over on the ground, shrieking with mirth.  Miss Peckham, her face a dull red, moved off in the direction of the tent.  Others came up, excitedly demanding to know what the joke was.  \"She thought it was a coral snake, and it was Tiny's stocking,\" giggled Bengal, going into a fresh spasm.  \"Well, what if I did?\" remarked Miss Peckham, turning around and looking at her frigidly. \"It's a mistake anybody could easily make, I'm sure.\" And she went stiffly up into the tent.  Sahwah and Miss Judy had somewhat recovered their composure by this time, and having captured the wildly agitated stocking they released from it a half-grown chipmunk, who, beside himself with fright and bewilderment, dashed away into the woods like a flash.  \"How frightened he was, poor little fellow!\" cried Migwan compassionately. \"It wasn't any joke for _him_. He must have been nearly frantic in there. How do you suppose he ever got in?\"  \"Walked in, or fell in, possibly,\" replied Miss Judy, \"and then couldn't find his way out again. Tiny had those modest little stockings of hers hanging on the tent ropes this morning, and it was easy enough for a chipmunk to get in.\"  Carrying the stocking between them, and followed by all the girls who had been standing around, Sahwah and Miss Judy started for Bedlam to tell Tiny about the panic her hosiery had caused, but halfway to Bedlam the trumpet sounded for dinner and the deputation broke up in a wild rush for the bungalow. Miss Peckham carefully avoided Miss Judy's eye all through dinner.  When the Winnebagos sauntered back to their tents for rest hour they all found large, wafer-sealed envelopes lying in conspicuous places upon their respective tables. Sahwah pounced upon the one in Gitchee-Gummee and looked at it curiously. On it was written in large red letters:    TO THE DWELLERS IN GITCHEE-GUMMEE  IMPORTANT!!!  \"Whatever "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10688"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at Camp Keewaydin; Or, Paddles Down (#8)"],["body","this be?\" she asked in mystified tones. Miss Judy was not in the tent.  \"Open it,\" commanded Agony.  Sahwah slit the envelope with the knife that she always kept hanging at her belt, and pulled out a sheet of rough, brown paper, on which was drawn the picture of a girl bound fast to a tree by ropes that went round and round her body, while a band of Indians danced a savage war dance around her. Underneath was printed in the same large red letters as those which adorned the outside of the envelope:     BE DOWN ON THE DOCK AT SUNDOWN   WITHOUT FAIL PREPARED TO UNDERGO         THE ORDEAL WHICH ALL      DWELLERS IN THE ALLEY MUST     SUFFER BEFORE BEING WELCOMED            INTO THE INNER           CIRCLE OF ALLEY               SPIRITS.    WARNING: MENTION NOT THIS SUMMONS       TO A LIVING SOUL OR AWFUL       WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCES.      SIGNED: THE TERRIBLE TWELVE.    P.S. BRING YOUR BATHING SUITS.  \"What on earth?\" cried Hinpoha in bewilderment.  \"It's the Alley Initiation!\" exclaimed Sahwah. \"I heard someone asking when it was going to be. Mary Sylvester and Jo Severance and several more of the old girls were talking about it while they were in the water today. It seems that the girls who have lived in the Alley before always hold an initiation for the new girls before they let them in on their larks.\"  \"I wonder what they're going to do to us,\" mused Hinpoha. \"That advice to bring your bathing suit sounds suspicious to me.\"  \"Do you suppose they're going to throw us into the river?\" asked Agony.  \"Nonsense,\" replied Sahwah. \"Half the new girls in the Alley can't swim. Dr. Grayson wouldn't allow it, anyway. He made a girl come out of the water during swimming hour this morning for trying to duck another girl. They'll just make us ridiculous, that's all.\"  \"Well, whatever they ask us to do, let's not make a fuss,\" said Hinpoha. \"Here comes Miss Judy. Put that letter out of sight and act perfectly unconcerned.\"  Sahwah whipped the envelope into her suitcase and flung herself down on her bed; the others followed her example; and when a moment later Miss Judy stepped into the tent and looked quizzically at the trio she found them apparently wrapped in placid slumber.  Shortly before seven that evening, when the Avenue girls were dancing in the bungalow, Sahwah and Hinpoha and Agony quietly detached themselves from the group and slipped down to the dock to find Katherine and Oh-Pshaw and Jean Lawrence already down there, swinging their feet over the end of the pier and waiting for something to happen. Down the hillside other forms were stealing; Migwan, and Gladys, and Bengal Virden, followed by Tiny Armstrong, until practically all the inhabitants of the Alley were gathered upon the dock. Miss Judy was leaning over the edge of the pier untying the launch.  The neophytes watched intently every move that the old girls made, and were somewhat reassured when they saw that they had brought their bathing suits, too.  \"Are all assembled?\" asked Miss Judy, straightening up and looking over her shoulder inquiringly.  \"Not yet,\" answered Mary Sylvester, taking an inventory of girls present.  \"Who isn't here yet?\"  \"Carmen Chadwick and the Lone Wolf. Oh, they're coming now, so is Miss Amesbury.\"  Migwan felt a little flustered as Miss Amesbury came smiling into their midst. She didn't in the least mind being initiated, but she did rather hate to have Miss Amesbury see her made ridiculous. She would much rather not have her looking on.  Carmen Chadwick looked quite pale and scared as she joined the group on the dock, and took hold of Katherine's arm as if to seek her protection.  \"All ready now?\" asked Miss Judy.  \"Ay, ay, skipper,\" replied Tiny Armstrong.  \"Man the boat!\" commanded Miss Judy.  The girls got into the launch and Miss Judy started the engine. They rode a short distance up the river to the Whaleback, a small island shaped, as its name indicated, like a whale's back. It was quite flat, only slightly elevated above the surface of the water. On one side it had rather a wide beach covered with stones and littered with driftwood; behind this beach rose a dense growth of pines that extended down to the very edge of the water on the other side of the island.  The initiation party disembarked upon the beach. A huge fire was laid ready and Miss Judy lit it, then she requested the new girls to sit down in a place which she designated at one side of it, while the old girls seated themselves in a row opposite. Sahwah took note that the new girls were in the full glare of the firelight, while the old ones sat in the shadow.  Miss Judy opened the ceremonies. Stepping into the light, she addressed the neophytes. \"Since the dwellers in the Alley live together in such intimate companionship it is necessary that all be properly introduced to each other, so that we shall never mistake our own. We shall now proceed with the introductions. As soon as a new girl or councilor recognizes herself in the pictures we shall proceed to draw, let her come forward and bow to the ground three times in acknowledgment, uttering the words, 'Behold, it is I! who else _could_ it be?'\"  She poked up the fire to a brighter blaze and then sat down beside Tiny Armstrong on the end of a log. As she seated herself Jo Severance rose and came forward demurely. Jo was an accomplished elocutionist, and a born mimic. Assuming a timid, shrinking demeanor, and speaking in a high, shrill voice, she piped,    \"Mother, may I go out to swim?\"   \"Yes, my darling daughter,   Put on your nice new bathing suit,   But don't go near the water!\"  \"Don't you think it's unladylike to have your muscles all hard and developed?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Oh-Pshaw buried her face in her handkerchief with a convulsive giggle. The voice, the intonation, the expression, were Carmen Chadwick to a T. But how did the Alleys know about her attitude toward bathing? She had not told anyone. Then she recalled that the Lone Wolf had walked behind them on the pier that morning when Carmen had been talking to her. Had the Lone Wolf also heard them talking about her? Agony wondered in a sudden rush of embarrassment.  There was no mistaking the first \"portrait.\" All eyes were focused upon Carmen, and blushing and shrinking she went forward to make the required acknowledgment.  \"Beh-hold, it is I; w-who else could it be?\" she faltered, and it sounded so irresistibly funny that the listeners went into spasms of mirth.  Carmen crept back to her place and hid her face in Katherine's lap while Jo Severance passed on to the next \"portrait.\" Climbing up an enormous tree stump, she flung out her arms and began to shriek wildly, waving back an imaginary group of girls. Then she proclaimed in important tones: \"It had broad, alternating rings of black and red, the distinguishing marks of the coral snake, one of the seventeen poisonous reptiles out of the one hundred and eleven species of snakes found in the United States. It reared up and menaced me with its great, wicked--\"  The remainder of her speech was lost in the great roar of laughter that went up from old and new girls alike.  Miss Peckham turned fiery red, and looked angrily from Jo Severance to Miss Judy, but there was no help for it; she had to go forward and claim the portrait.  \"Behold, it is I; who else _could_ it be?\" she snapped, and the mirth broke out louder than before. The \"who else _could_ it be?\" was so like Miss Peckham.  One by one the other candidates were shown their portraits, that is, as many as had displayed any conspicuous peculiarities.  \"O Pom-pom! O dear Pom-pom, O _darling_ Pom-pom!\" gushed Jo, rolling her eyes in ecstasy, and Bengal Virden, laughing sheepishly, went forward.  Miss Amesbury watched the performance with tears of merriment rolling down her cheeks. \"I never saw anything so funny!\" she exclaimed to Mary Sylvester. \"That phrase, 'who else _could_ it be' is a perfect gem.\"  Agony was somewhat disappointed that her portrait was not painted; it would have drawn her into more notice. So far she was only \"among those present\" at camp. None of the old girls had paid any attention to her.  After all the portraits had been painted the rest of the girls were called upon to do individual stunts. Some sang, some made speeches, some danced, and the worse the performance the greater the applause from the initiators. One slender, dark-eyed girl with short hair whistled, with two fingers in her mouth. At the first note Migwan and Gladys started and clasped each other's hands. The mystery of the fairy piping they had heard in the woods that first afternoon was solved. The same clear, sweet notes came thrilling out between her fingers, alluring as the pipes of Pan. The whistler was a girl named Noel Carrington; she was one of the younger girls whom nobody had noticed particularly before. Her whistling brought wild applause which was perfectly sincere; her performance delighted the audience beyond measure. She was called back again and again until at last, quite out of breath, she begged for mercy, when she was allowed to retire on the condition that she would whistle some more as soon as she got her breath back.  Noel's performance closed the stunts. When she had sat down Miss Judy rose and said that she guessed the Alley dwellers were pretty well acquainted with each other, and would now go for a swim in the moonlight. Soon all but Carmen Chadwick were splashing in the silvery water, playing hide and seek with the moonbeams on the ripples and feeling a thrill and a magic in the river which was never there in the daylight. After a glorious frolic they came out to stand around the fire and eat marshmallows until it was time to go back to camp.  \"Initiation wasn't so terrible after all,\" Carmen confided to Katherine in the launch.  \"Heaps of fun,\" replied Katherine, laughing reminiscently.  \"Isn't Miss Peckham a prune?\" whispered Sybil's voice behind Katherine. \"I'm glad she's not my councilor.\"  \"She's "]]]
