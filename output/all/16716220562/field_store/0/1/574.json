There are two streams called Chickamauga emptying into the Tennessee River east of Chattanooga--North Chickamauga, taking its rise in Tennessee, flowing south, and emptying into the river some seven or eight miles east; while the South Chickamauga, which takes its rise in Georgia, flows northward, and empties into the Tennessee some three or four miles above the town. There were now one hundred and sixteen pontoons in the North Chickamauga River, their presence there being unknown to the enemy.  At night a division was to be marched up to that point, and at two o'clock in the morning moved down with the current, thirty men in each boat.  A few were to land east of the mouth of the South Chickamauga, capture the pickets there, and then lay a bridge connecting the two banks of the river.  The rest were to land on the south side of the Tennessee, where Missionary Ridge would strike it if prolonged, and a sufficient number of men to man the boats were to push to the north side to ferry over the main body of Sherman's command while those left on the south side intrenched themselves.  Thomas was to move out from his lines facing the ridge, leaving enough of Palmer's corps to guard against an attack down the valley.  Lookout Valley being of no present value to us, and being untenable by the enemy if we should secure Missionary Ridge, Hooker's orders were changed.  His revised orders brought him to Chattanooga by the established route north of the Tennessee.  He was then to move out to the right to Rossville.  Hooker's position in Lookout Valley was absolutely essential to us so long as Chattanooga was besieged.  It was the key to our line for supplying the army.  But it was not essential after the enemy was dispersed from our front, or even after the battle for this purpose was begun.  Hooker's orders, therefore, were designed to get his force past Lookout Mountain and Chattanooga Valley, and up to Missionary Ridge.  By crossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come into Chattanooga Valley in rear of the line held by the enemy across the valley, and would necessarily force its evacuation.  Orders were accordingly given to march by this route.  But days before the battle began the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of action were all considered.  The passage over the mountain was a difficult one to make in the face of an enemy.  It might consume so much time as to lose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where they were more wanted.  After reaching Chattanooga Valley, the creek of the same name, quite a formidable stream to get an army over, had to be crossed.  I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep Lookout Mountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge.  By marching Hooker to the north side of the river, thence up the stream, and recrossing at the town, he could be got in position at any named time; when in this new position, he would have Chattanooga Creek behind him, and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause the evacuation by the enemy of his line across the valley and on Lookout Mountain.  Hooker's order was changed accordingly.  As explained elsewhere, the original order had to be reverted to, because of a flood in the river rendering the bridge at Brown's Ferry unsafe for the passage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring all the troops together against Missionary Ridge.  The next day after Sherman's arrival I took him, with Generals Thomas and Smith and other officers, to the north side of the river, and showed them the ground over which Sherman had to march, and pointed out generally what he was expected to do.  I, as well as the authorities in Washington, was still in a great state of anxiety for Burnside's safety. Burnside himself, I believe, was the only one who did not share in this anxiety. Nothing could be done for him, however, until Sherman's troops were up.  As soon, therefore, as the inspection was over, Sherman started for Bridgeport to hasten matters, rowing a boat himself, I believe, from Kelly's Ferry.  Sherman had left Bridgeport the night of the 14th, reached Chattanooga the evening of the 15th, made the above-described inspection on the morning of the 16th, and started back the same evening to hurry up his command, fully appreciating the importance of time.  His march was conducted with as much expedition as the roads and season would admit of.  By the 20th he was himself at Brown's Ferry with the head of column, but many of his troops were far behind, and one division (Ewing's) was at Trenton, sent that way to create the impression that Lookout was to be taken from the south.  Sherman received his orders at the ferry, and was asked if he could not be ready for the assault the following morning.  News had been received that the battle had been commenced at Knoxville.  Burnside had been cut off from telegraphic communications.  The President, the Secretary of War, and General Halleck, were in an agony of suspense.  My suspense was also great, but more endurable, because I was where I could soon do something to relieve the situation.  It was impossible to get Sherman's troops up for the next day.  I then asked him if they could not be got up to make the assault on the morning of the 22d, and ordered Thomas to move on that date.  But the elements were against us.  It rained all the 20th and 21st. The river rose so rapidly that it was difficult to keep the pontoons in place.  General Orlando B. Willcox, a division commander under Burnside, was at this time occupying a position farther up the valley than Knoxville --about Maynardville--and was still in telegraphic communication with the North.  A dispatch was received from him saying that he was threatened from the east.  The following was sent in reply:  \"If you can communicate with General Burnside, say to him that our attack on Bragg will commence in the morning.  If successful, such a move will be made as I think will relieve East Tennessee, if he can hold out.  Longstreet passing through our lines to Kentucky need not cause alarm.  He would find the country so bare that he would lose his transportation and artillery before reaching Kentucky, and would meet such a force before he got through, that he could not return.\"  Meantime, Sherman continued his crossing without intermission as fast as his troops could be got up.  The crossing had to be effected in full view of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain.  Once over, however, the troops soon disappeared behind the detached hill on the north side, and would not come to view again, either to watchmen on Lookout Mountain or Missionary Ridge, until they emerged between the hills to strike the bank of the river.  But when Sherman's advance reached a point opposite the town of Chattanooga, Howard, who, it will be remembered, had been concealed behind the hills on the north side, took up his line of march to join the troops on the south side.  His crossing was in full view both from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout, and the enemy of course supposed these troops to be Sherman's.  This enabled Sherman to get to his assigned position without discovery.    CHAPTER XLIII.  PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE--THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE ENEMY --SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE--BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN --GENERAL HOOKER'S FIGHT.  On the 20th, when so much was occurring to discourage--rains falling so heavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown's Ferry and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge; news coming of a battle raging at Knoxville; of Willcox being threatened by a force from the east--a letter was received from Bragg which contained these words:  \"As there may still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga, I deem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their early withdrawal.\" Of course, I understood that this was a device intended to deceive; but I did not know what the intended deception was.  On the 22d, however, a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leaving our front, and on that day Buckner's division was sent to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville, and another division started to follow but was recalled.  The object of Bragg's letter, no doubt, was in some way to detain me until Knoxville could be captured, and his troops there be returned to Chattanooga.  During the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon boats, completed, one hundred and sixteen in all, were carried up to and placed in North Chickamauga. The material for the roadway over these was deposited out of view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of the Tennessee, where the north end of the bridge was to rest.  Hearing nothing from Burnside, and hearing much of the distress in Washington on his account, I could no longer defer operations for his relief.  I determined, therefore, to do on the 23d, with the Army of the Cumberland, what had been intended to be done on the 24th.  The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made very strong for defence during the months it had been besieged.  The line was about a mile from the town, and extended from Citico Creek, a small stream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into the Tennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga, on the left, to Chattanooga Creek on the right.  All commanding points on the line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery.  The important elevations within the line had all been carefully fortified and supplied with a proper armament.  Among the elevations so fortified was one to the east of the town, named Fort Wood.  It owed its importance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town and Missionary Ridge, where most of the strength of the enemy was.  Fort Wood had in it twenty-two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1068"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant â€” Volume 2 (#6)"],["body","of artillery, most of which would reach the nearer points of the enemy's line.  On the morning of the 23d Thomas, according to instructions, moved Granger's corps of two divisions, Sheridan and T. J. Wood commanding, to the foot of Fort Wood, and formed them into line as if going on parade, Sheridan on the right, Wood to the left, extending to or near Citico Creek.  Palmer, commanding the 14th corps, held that part of our line facing south and southwest. He supported Sheridan with one division (Baird's), while his other division under Johnson remained in the trenches, under arms, ready to be moved to any point. Howard's corps was moved in rear of the centre.  The picket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other.  At two o'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance.  By this time the clouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his elevated position all that was going on.  The signal for advance was given by a booming of cannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line.  The rebel pickets were soon driven back upon the main guards, which occupied minor and detached heights between the main ridge and our lines.  These too were carried before halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce their advance guards.  But it was not without loss on both sides. This movement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one we occupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had occupied up to this time.  The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the other way.  During the following night they were made strong.  We lost in this preliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded, while the enemy probably lost quite as heavily, including the prisoners that were captured. With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up from Missionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended the fighting for the first day.  The advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only have been assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should have rested more easily.  But we were doing the best we could for him and the cause.  By the night of the 23d Sherman's command was in a position to move, though one division (Osterhaus's) had not yet crossed the river at Brown's Ferry.  The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered it impossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops to cross; but I was determined to move that night even without this division.  Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report to Hooker, if he could not cross by eight o'clock on the morning of the 24th.  Because of the break in the bridge, Hooker's orders were again changed, but this time only back to those first given to him.  General W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of the Military Division.  To him were given the general direction of moving troops by the boats from North Chickamauga, laying the bridge after they reached their position, and generally all the duties pertaining to his office of chief engineer.  During the night General Morgan L. Smith's division was marched to the point where the pontoons were, and the brigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manning the boats and surprising the enemy's pickets on the south bank of the river.  During this night also General J. M. Brannan, chief of artillery, moved forty pieces of artillery, belonging to the Army of the Cumberland, and placed them on the north side of the river so as to command the ground opposite, to aid in protecting the approach to the point where the south end of the bridge was to rest.  He had to use Sherman's artillery horses for this purpose, Thomas having none.  At two o'clock in the morning, November 24th, Giles A. Smith pushed out from the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats, each loaded with thirty brave and well-armed men.  The boats with their precious freight dropped down quietly with the current to avoid attracting the attention of any one who could convey information to the enemy, until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga. Here a few boats were landed, the troops debarked, and a rush was made upon the picket guard known to be at that point.  The guard were surprised, and twenty of their number captured.  The remainder of the troops effected a landing at the point where the bridge was to start, with equally good results.  The work of ferrying over Sherman's command from the north side of the Tennessee was at once commenced, using the pontoons for the purpose.  A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist.  The rest of M. L. Smith's division came first, then the division of John E. Smith.  The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching their position.  By daylight the two entire divisions were over, and well covered by the works they had built.  The work of laying the bridge, on which to cross the artillery and cavalry, was now begun.  The ferrying over the infantry was continued with the steamer and the pontoons, taking the pontoons, however, as fast as they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge.  By a little past noon the bridge was completed, as well as one over the South Chickamauga connecting the troops left on that side with their comrades below, and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of the Tennessee.  Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge.  By one o'clock he started with M. L. Smith on his left, keeping nearly the course of Chickamauga River; J. E. Smith next to the right and a little to the rear; and Ewing still farther to the right and also a little to the rear of J. E. Smith's command, in column, ready to deploy to the right if an enemy should come from that direction.  A good skirmish line preceded each of these columns.  Soon the foot of the hill was reached; the skirmishers pushed directly up, followed closely by their supports. By half-past three Sherman was in possession of the height without having sustained much loss.  A brigade from each division was now brought up, and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand. The enemy did not seem to be aware of this movement until the top of the hill was gained.  There had been a drizzling rain during the day, and the clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of Missionary Ridge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley.  But now the enemy opened fire upon their assailants, and made several attempts with their skirmishers to drive them away, but without avail.  Later in the day a more determined attack was made, but this, too, failed, and Sherman was left to fortify what he had gained.  Sherman's cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge was completed, and by half-past three the whole of it was over both bridges and on its way to strike the enemy's communications at Chickamauga Station.  All of Sherman's command was now south of the Tennessee. During the afternoon General Giles A. Smith was severely wounded and carried from the field.  Thomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the 24th, there was nothing for him to do this day except to strengthen his position.  Howard, however, effected a crossing of Citico Creek and a junction with Sherman, and was directed to report to him.  With two or three regiments of his command he moved in the morning along the banks of the Tennessee, and reached the point where the bridge was being laid. He went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end, and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and moving himself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadway put upon it.  Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm between them, which was now narrow and in a few minutes closed.  While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga, Hooker was engaged on the west.  He had three divisions: Osterhaus's, of the 15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; Geary's, 12th corps, Army of the Potomac; and Cruft's, 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland.  Geary was on the right at Wauhatchie, Cruft at the centre, and Osterhaus near Brown's Ferry.  These troops were all west of Lookout Creek.  The enemy had the east bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched, and three brigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked.  These brigades occupied the summit of the mountain.  General Carter L. Stevenson was in command of the whole.  Why any troops, except artillery with a small infantry guard, were kept on the mountain-top, I do not see.  A hundred men could have held the summit--which is a palisade for more than thirty feet down--against the assault of any number of men from the position Hooker occupied.  The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker's command was rugged, heavily timbered, and full of chasms, making it difficult to advance with troops, even in the absence of an opposing force.  Farther up, the ground becomes more even and level, and was in cultivation.  On the east side the slope is much more gradual, and a good wagon road, zigzagging up it, connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit.  Early on the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division, supported by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect a crossing.  The remainder of Cruft's division was to seize the bridge over the creek, near the crossing of the railroad. Osterhaus was to move up to the bridge and cross it.  The bridge was seized by Gross's brigade after a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it.  This attracted the enemy so that Geary's movement farther up was not observed.  A heavy mist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of the mountain.  He crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured the picket of over forty men on guard near by.  He then commenced ascending the mountain directly in his front.  By this time the enemy was seen coming down from their camps on the mountain slope, and filing"]]]
