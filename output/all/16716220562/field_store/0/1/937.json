And yet it is rather hard, when one's still reasonably young, with almost everything before one--to be a marked woman all one's time!\"  Up to her last words, despite an inviting pause after almost every sentence, I had succeeded in holding my tongue; though she was looking wistfully now at the distant snow-peaks and obviously bestowing upon herself the sympathy she did not want from me (as I had been told in so many words, if not more plainly in the accompanying brief encounter between our eyes), yet had I resisted every temptation to put in my word, until these last two or three from Mrs. Lascelles. They, however, demanded a denial, and I told her it was absurd to describe herself in such terms.  \"I am marked,\" she persisted, \"wherever I go I may be known, as you knew me here. If it hadn't been you it would have been somebody else, and I should have known of it indirectly instead of directly; but even supposing I had escaped altogether at this hotel, the next one would probably have made up for it.\"  \"Do you stay much in hotels?\"  There had been something in the mellow voice which made such a question only natural, yet it was scarcely asked before I would have given a good deal to recall it.  \"There is nowhere else to stay,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"unless one sets up house alone, which is costlier and far less comfortable. You see, one does make a friend or two sometimes--before one is found out.\"  \"But surely your people--\"  This time I did check myself.  \"My people,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"have washed their hands of me.\"  \"But Major Lascelles--surely _his_ people--\"  \"They washed their hands of him! You see, they would be the first to tell you, he had always been rather wild; but his crowning act of madness in their eyes was his marriage. It was worse than the worst thing he had ever done before. Still, it is not for me to say anything, or feel anything, against his family....\"  And then I knew that they were making her an allowance; it was more than I wanted to know; the ground was too delicate, and led nowhere in particular. Still, it was difficult not to take a certain amount of interest in a handsome woman who had made such a wreck of her life so young, who was so utterly alone, so proud and independent in her loneliness, and apparently quite fine-hearted and unspoilt. But for Bob Evers and his mother, the interest that I took might have been a little different in kind; but even with my solicitude for them there mingled already no small consideration for the social solitary whom I watched now as she sat peering across the glacier, the foremost figure in a world of high lights and great backgrounds, and whom to watch was to admire, even against the greatest of them all. Alas! mere admiration could not change my task or stay my hand; it could but clog me by destroying my singleness of purpose, and giving me a double heart to match my double face.  Since, however, a detestable duty had been undertaken, and since as a duty it was more apparent than I had dreamt of finding it, there was nothing for it but to go through with the thing and make immediate enemies of my friends. So I set my teeth and talked of Bob. I was glad Mrs. Lascelles liked him. His father was a remote connection of mine, whom I had never met. But I had once known his mother very well.  \"And what is she like?\" asked Mrs. Lascelles, calling her fine eyes home from infinity, and fixing them once more on me.     CHAPTER VI  OUT OF ACTION   Now if, upon a warm, soft, summer evening, you were suddenly asked to describe the perfect winter's day, either you would have to stop and think a little, or your imagination is more elastic than mine. Yet you might have a passionate preference for cold sun and bracing airs. To me, Catherine Evers and this Mrs. Lascelles were as opposite to each other as winter and summer, or the poles, or any other notorious antitheses. There was no comparison between them in my mind, yet as I sat with one among the sunlit, unfamiliar Alps, it was a distinct effort to picture the other in the little London room I knew so well. For it was always among her books and pictures that I thought of Catherine, and to think was to wish myself there at her side, rather than to wish her here at mine. Catherine's appeal, I used to think, was to the highest and the best in me, to brain and soul, and young ambition, and withal to one's love of wit and sense of humour. Mrs. Lascelles, on the other hand, struck me primarily in the light of some splendid and spirited animal. I still liked to dwell upon her dancing. She satisfied the mere eye more and more. But I had no reason to suppose that she knew right from wrong in art or literature, any more than she would seem to have distinguished between them in life itself. Her Tauchnitz novel lay beside her on the grass and I again reflected that it would not have found a place on Catherine's loftiest shelf. Catherine would have raved about the view and made delicious fun of Quinby and the judge, and we should have sat together talking poetry and harmless scandal by the happy hour. Mrs. Lascelles probably took place and people alike for granted. But she had lived, and as an animal she was superb! I looked again into her healthy face and speaking eyes, with their bitter knowledge of good and evil, their scorn of scorn, their redeeming honesty and candour. The contrast was complete in every detail except the widowhood of both women; but I did not pursue it any farther; for once more there was but one woman in my thoughts, and she sat near me under a red parasol--clashing so humanly with the everlasting snows!  \"You don't answer my question, Captain Clephane. How much for your thoughts?\"  \"I'll make you a present of them, Mrs. Lascelles. I was beginning to think that a lot of rot has been written about the eternal snows and the mountain-tops and all the rest of it. There a few lines in that last little volume of Browning--\"  I stopped of my own accord, for upon reflection the lines would have made a rather embarrassing quotation. But meanwhile Mrs. Lascelles had taken alarm on other grounds.  \"Oh, _don't_ quote Browning!\"  \"Why not?\"  \"He is far too deep for me; besides, I don't care for poetry, and I was asking you about Mrs. Evers.\"  \"Well,\" I said, with some little severity, \"she's a very clever woman.\"  \"Clever enough to understand Browning?\"  \"Quite.\"  If this was irony, it was also self-restraint, for it was to Catherine's enthusiasm that I owed my own. The debt was one of such magnitude as a life of devotion could scarcely have repaid, for to whom do we owe so much as to those who first lifted the scales from our eyes and awakened within us a soul for all such things? Catherine had been to me what I instantly desired to become to this benighted beauty; but the desire was not worth entertaining, since I hardly expected to be many minutes longer on speaking terms with Mrs. Lascelles. I recalled the fact that it was I who had broached the subject of Bob Evers and his mother, together with my unpalatable motive for so doing. And I was seeking in my mind, against the grain, I must confess, for a short cut back to Bob, when Mrs. Lascelles suddenly led the way.  \"I don't think,\" said she, \"that Mr. Evers takes after his mother.\"  \"I'm afraid he doesn't,\" I replied, \"in that respect.\"  \"And I am glad,\" she said. \"I do like a boy to be a boy. The only son of his mother is always in danger of becoming something else. Tell me, Captain Clephane, are they very devoted to each other?\"  There was some new note in that expressive voice of hers. Was it merely wistful, was it really jealous, or was either element the product of my own imagination? I made answer while I wondered:  \"Absolutely devoted, I should say; but it's years since I saw them together. Bob was a small boy then, and one of the jolliest. Still I never expected him to grow up the charming chap he is now.\"  Mrs. Lascelles sat gazing at the great curve of Th√©odule Glacier. I watched her face.  \"He _is_ charming,\" she said at length. \"I am not sure that I ever met anybody quite like him, or rather I am quite sure that I never did. He is so quiet, in a way, and yet so wonderfully confident and at ease!\"  \"That's Eton,\" said I. \"He is the best type of Eton boy, and the best type of Eton boy,\" I declared, airing the little condition with a flourish, \"is one of the greatest works of God.\"  \"I daresay you're right,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, smiling indulgently; \"but what is it? How do you define it? It isn't 'side,' and yet I can quite imagine people who don't know him thinking that it is. He is cocksure of himself, but of nothing else; that seems to me to be the difference. No one could possibly be more simple in himself. He may have the assurance of a man of fifty, yet it isn't put on; it's neither bumptious nor affected, but just as natural in Mr. Evers as shyness and awkwardness in the ordinary youth one meets. And he has the _savoir faire_ not to ask questions!\"  Were we all mistaken? Was this the way in which a designing woman would speak of the object of her designs? Not that I thought so hardly of Mrs. Lascelles myself; but I did think that she might well fall in love with Bob Evers, at least as well as he with her. Was this, then, the way in which a woman would be likely to speak of the young man with whom she had fallen in love? To me the appreciation sounded too frank and discerning and acute. Yet I could not call it dispassionate, and frankness was this woman's outstanding merit, though I was beginning to discover others as well. Moreover, the fact remained that they had been greatly talked about; that at any rate must be stopped and I was there to stop it.  I began to pick my words.  \"It's all Eton, except what is in the blood, and it's all a question of manners, or rather of manner. Don't misunderstand me, Mrs. Lascelles. I don't say that Bob isn't independent in character as well as in his ways, but only that when all's said he's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11162"],["title","The Story of Little Black Mingo (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]  THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK MINGO   By The Author Of 'The Story Of Little Black Sambo'     The Story of Little Black Mingo.   Once upon a time there was a little black girl, and her name was Little Black Mingo.  [Illustration]  She had no father and mother, so she had to live with a horrid cross old woman called Black Noggy, who used to scold her every day, and sometimes beat her with a stick, even though she had done nothing naughty.  [Illustration]  One day Black Noggy called her, and said, \"Take this chatty down to the river and fill it with water, and come back as fast as you can, _quick now_!\"  [Illustration]  So Little Black Mingo took the chatty and ran down to the river as fast as she could, and began to fill it with water, when Cr-r-rrrack!!! Bang!!! a horrible big Mugger poked its nose up through the bottom of the chatty and said \"Ha ha! Little Mingo, I'm going to eat you up!\"  [Illustration]  Little Black Mingo did not say anything. She turned and ran away as fast as ever she could, and the Mugger ran after her. But the broken chatty round his neck caught his paws, so he could not overtake her.  [Illustration]  But when she got back to Black Noggy, and told her how the Mugger had broken the chatty, Black Noggy was fearfully angry. \"You naughty girl,\" she said, \"you have broken the chatty yourself, I have a good mind to beat you.\" And if she had not been in such a hurry for the water she _would_ have beaten her.  [Illustration]  Then she went and fetched the great big chatty that the dhobi used to boil the clothes in. \"Take this,\" said she, \"and mind you don't break it, or I _will_ beat you.\"  \"But I can't carry that when it is full of water,\" said Little Black Mingo.  \"You must go twice, and bring it half full each time,\" said Black Noggy.  [Illustration]  So Little Black Mingo took the dhobi's great big chatty, and started again to go to the river. But first she went to a little bank above the river, and peeped up and down, to see if she could see the old Mugger anywhere. But she could not see him, for he was hiding under the very bank she was standing on, and though his tail stuck out a little she never saw him at all.  She would have liked to run home, but she was too much afraid that Black Noggy would beat her.  So Little Black Mingo crept down to the river, and began to fill the big chatty with water. And while she was filling it the Mugger came creeping softly down behind her and caught her by the tail, saying, \"Aha, Little Black Mingo, now I've got you.\"  And Little Black Mingo said, \"Oh! please don't eat me up, great big Mugger.\"  [Illustration]  \"What will you give me, if I don't eat you up?\" said the Mugger. But Little Black Mingo was so poor she had nothing to give. So the Mugger caught her in his great cruel mouth and swam away with her to an island in the middle of the river and set her down beside a huge pile of eggs.  [Illustration]  \"Those are my eggs,\" said he; \"to-morrow a little mugger will come out of each, and then we will have a great feast, and we will eat you up.\"  Then he waddled off to catch fish for himself, and left Little Black Mingo alone beside the big pile of eggs.  And Little Black Mingo sat down on a big stone and hid her face in her hands, and cried bitterly, because she couldn't swim, and she didn't know how to get away.  [Illustration]  Presently she heard a queer little squeaky noise that sounded like \"Squeak, Squeak, Squeak!!! Oh Little Black Mingo, help me or I shall be drowned.\" She got up and looked to see what was calling, and she saw a bush coming floating down the river with something wriggling and scrambling about in it, and as it came near she saw that it was a Mongoose that was in the bush. So she waded out as far as she could, and caught hold of the bush and pulled it in, and the poor Mongoose crawled up her arm on to her shoulder, and she carried him to shore.  [Illustration]  When they got to shore the Mongoose shook himself, and Little Black Mingo wrung out her petticoat, and so they both very soon got dry.  [Illustration]  The Mongoose then began to poke about for something to eat, and very soon he found the great big pile of Mugger's eggs. \"Oh, joy!\" said he, \"what's this?\"  \"Those are Mugger's eggs,\" said Little Black Mingo.  [Illustration]  \"I'm not afraid of Muggers!\" said the Mongoose; and he sat down and began to crack the eggs, and eat the little muggers as they came out. And he threw the shells into the water, so that the old Mugger should not see that any one had been eating them. But he was careless, and he left one eggshell on the edge, and he was hungry and he ate so many that the pile got much smaller, and when the old Mugger came back he saw at once that some one had been meddling with them.  So he ran to Little Black Mingo, and said, \"How dare you eat my eggs?\"  \"Indeed, indeed I didn't,\" said Little Black Mingo.  \"Then who could it have been?\" said the Mugger, and he ran back to the eggs as fast as he could, and sure enough when he got back he found the Mongoose had eaten a whole lot more!!  [Illustration]  Then he said to himself, \"I must stay beside my eggs till they are hatched into little muggers, or the Mongoose will eat them all.\" So he curled himself into a ring round the eggs and went to sleep.  [Illustration]  But while he was asleep the Mongoose came to eat some more of the eggs, and ate as many as he wanted, and when the Mugger woke this time, oh! _what_ a rage he was in, for there were only six eggs left! He roared so loud that all the little muggers inside the shells gnashed their teeth, and tried to roar too.  [Illustration]  Then he said, \"I know what I'll do, I'll fetch Little Black Mingo's big chatty and cover my eggs with that, then the Mongoose won't be able to get at them.\" So he swam across to the shore, and fetched the dhobi's big chatty, and covered the eggs with it. \"Now, you wicked little Mongoose, come and eat my eggs if you can,\" said he, and he went off quite proud and happy.  [Illustration]  By and by the Mongoose came back, and he was terribly disappointed when he found the eggs all covered with the big chatty.  [Illustration]  So he ran off to Little Black Mingo, and asked her to help him, and Little Black Mingo came and took the big chatty off the eggs, and the Mongoose ate them every one.  \"Now,\" said he, \"there will be no little muggers to make a feast for to-morrow.\"  \"No,\" said Little Black Mingo, \"but the Mugger will eat me all by himself I am afraid.\"  \"No he won't,\" said the Mongoose, \"for we will sail away together in the big chatty before he comes back.\"  [Illustration]  So he climbed on to the edge of the chatty, and Little Black Mingo pushed the chatty out into the water, and then she clambered into it and paddled with her two hands as hard as she could, and the big chatty just sailed beautifully.  So they got across safely, and Little Black Mingo filled the chatty half full of water and took it on her head, and they went up the bank together.  [Illustration]  But when the Mugger came back, and found only empty egg-shells he was fearfully angry. He roared and he raged, and he howled and he yelled, till the whole island shook, and his tears ran down his cheeks and pattered on the sand like rain.  [Illustration]  So he started to chase Little Black Mingo and the Mongoose, and he swam across the river as fast as ever he could, and when he was half way across he saw them landing, and as he landed they hurried over the first ridge.  [Illustration]  So he raced after them, but they ran, and just before he caught them they got into the house, and banged the door in his face. Then they shut all the windows, so he could not get in anywhere.  \"All right,\" said he, \"you will have to come out some time, and then I will catch you both, and eat you up.\"  So he hid behind the back of the house and waited.  [Illustration]  Now Black Noggy was just coming home from the bazaar with a tin of kerosene on her head, and a box of matches in her hand.  And when he saw her the Mugger rushed out and gobbled her up, kerosene tin, matches and all!!!  [Illustration]  When Black Noggy found herself in the Mugger's dark inside, she wanted to see where she was, so she felt for the match-box and took out a match and lit it. But the Mugger's teeth had made holes in the kerosene tin, so that the flame of the match caught the kerosene, and  BANG!!  [Illustration]  the kerosene exploded, and blew the old Mugger and Black Noggy into little bits.  [Illustration]  At the fearful noise Little Black Mingo and the Mongoose came running out, and there they found Black Noggy and the old Mugger all blown to bits.  So Little Black Mingo and the Mongoose got the nice little house for their very own, and there they lived happy ever after. And Little Black Mingo got the Mugger's head for her seat, and the Mongoose got Black Noggy's handkerchief for his. But he was so wee he used to put it on the Mugger's nose, and there they sat, and had their tea every evening."]]]
