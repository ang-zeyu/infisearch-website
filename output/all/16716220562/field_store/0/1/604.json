Do me the favor to accept this.\"  She opened her portemonnaie, and taking from it a banknote, handed it to Ben.  In surprise he looked at it, and saw that it was a twenty-dollar bill.  \"Did you know this was a twenty-dollar bill?\" he asked in amazement.  \"Certainly,\" answered the lady, with a smile.  \"It is less than ten per cent. of the amount I would have lost but for you.  I hope it will be of service to you.\"  \"I feel rich with it,\" answered Ben.  \"How can I thank you, Mrs. Hamilton?\"  \"Call on me at No. ---- Madison Avenue, and do it in person, when you next come to the city,\" said the lady, smiling.  \"Now, if you will kindly call that stage, I will bid you good-by--for the present.\"  Ben complied with her request, and joyfully resumed his walk down Broadway.     CHAPTER XIII A STARTLING EVENT   Though Ben had failed in the main object of his expedition, he returned to Pentonville in excellent spirits.  He felt that he had been a favorite of fortune, and with good reason.  In one day he had acquired a sum equal to five weeks' wages.  Added to the dollar Mr. Crawford had contributed toward his expenses, he had been paid twenty-one dollars, while he had spent a little less than two.  It is not every country boy who goes up to the great city who returns with an equal harvest.  If Squire Davenport had not threatened to foreclose the mortgage, he would have felt justified in buying a present for his mother.  As it was, he feared they would have need of all the money that came in to meet contingencies.  The train reached Pentonville at five o'clock, and about the usual time Ben opened the gate and walked up to the front door of his modest home.  He looked so bright and cheerful when he entered her presence that Mrs. Barclay thought be must have found and been kindly received by the cousin whom he had gone up to seek.  \"Did you see Mr. Peters?\" she asked anxiously.  \"No, mother; he is in Europe.\"  A shadow came over the mother's face.  It was like taking from her her last hope.  \"I was afraid you would not be repaid for going up to the city,\" she said.  \"I made a pretty good day's work of it, nevertheless, mother.  What do you say to this?\" and he opened his wallet and showed her a roll of bills.  \"Is that Mr. Crawford's money?\" she asked.  \"No, mother, it is mine, or rather it is yours, for I give it to you.\"  \"Did you find a pocketbook, Ben?  If so, the owner may turn up.\"  \"Mother, the money is mine, fairly mine, for it was given me in return for a service I rendered a lady in New York.\"  \"What service could you have possibly rendered, Ben, that merited such liberal payment?\" asked his mother in surprise.  Upon this Ben explained, and Mrs. Barclay listened to his story with wonder.  \"So you see, mother, I did well to go to the city,\" said Ben, in conclusion.  \"It has turned out so, and I am thankful for your good fortune.  But I should have been better pleased if you had seen Mr. Peters and found him willing to help us about the mortgage.\"  \"So would I, mother, but this money is worth having.  When supper is over I will go to the store to help out Mr. Crawford and report my purchase of goods.  You know the most of our trade is in the evening.\"  After Ben had gone Mrs. Barclay felt her spirits return as she thought of the large addition to their little stock of money.  \"One piece of good fortune may be followed by another,\" she thought. \"Mr. Peters may return from Europe in time to help us.  At any rate, we have nearly three months to look about us, and God may send us help.\"  When the tea dishes were washed and put away Mrs. Barclay sat down to mend a pair of Ben's socks, for in that household it was necessary to make clothing last as long as possible, when she was aroused from her work by a ringing at the bell.  She opened the door to admit Squire Davenport.  \"Good-evening,\" she said rather coldly, for she could not feel friendly to a man who was conspiring to deprive her of her modest home and turn her out upon the sidewalk.  \"Good-evening, widow,\" said the squire.  \"Will you walk in?\" asked Mrs. Barclay, not over cordially.  \"Thank you, I will step in for five minutes.  I called to see if you had thought better of my proposal the other evening.\"  \"Your proposal was to take my house from me,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"How can you suppose I would think better of that?\"  \"You forget that the house is more mine than yours already, Mrs. Barclay.  The sum I have advanced on mortgage is two-thirds of the value of the property.\"  \"I dispute that, sir.\"  \"Let it pass,\" said the squire, with a wave of the hand.  \"Call it three-fifths, if you will.  Even then the property is more mine than yours.  Women don't understand business, or you would see matters in a different light.\"  \"I am a woman, it is true, but I understand very well that you wish to take advantage of me,\" said the widow, not without excusable bitterness.  \"My good lady, you forget that I am ready to cancel the mortgage and pay you three hundred and fifty dollars for the house.  Now, three hundred and fifty dollars is a handsome sum--a very handsome sum.  You could put it in the savings bank and it would yield you quite a comfortable income.\"  \"Twenty dollars, more or less,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"Is that what you call a comfortable income?  How long do you think it would keep us alive?\"  \"Added, of course, to your son's wages.  Ben is now able to earn good wages.\"  \"He earns four dollars a week, and that is our main dependence.\"  \"I congratulate you.  I didn't suppose Mr. Crawford paid such high wages.\"  \"Ben earns every cent of it.\"  \"Very possibly.  By the way, what is this that Tom was telling me about Ben being sent to New York to buy goods for the store?\"  \"It is true, if that is what you mean.\"  \"Bless my soul!  It is very strange of Crawford, and I may add, not very judicious.\"  \"I suppose Mr. Crawford is the best judge of that, sir.\"  \"Even if the boy were competent, which is not for a moment to be thought of, it is calculated to foster his self-conceit.\"  \"Ben is not self-conceited,\" said Mrs. Barclay, ready to resent any slur upon her boy.  \"He has excellent business capacity, and if he were older I should not need to ask favors of anyone.\"  \"You are a mother, and naturally set an exaggerated estimate upon your son's ability, which, I presume, is respectable, but probably not more.  However, let that pass.  I did not call to discuss Ben but to inquire whether you had not thought better of the matter we discussed the other evening.\"  \"I never shall, Squire Davenport.  When the time comes you can foreclose, if you like, but it will never be done with my consent.\"  \"Ahem!  Your consent will not be required.\"  \"And let me tell you, Squire Davenport, if you do this wicked thing, it won't benefit you in the end.\"  Squire Davenport shrugged his shoulders.  \"I am not at all surprised to find you so unreasonable, Mrs. Barclay,\" he said.  \"It's the way with women.  I should be glad if you would come to look upon the matter in a different light; but I cannot sacrifice my own interests in any event.  The law is on my side.\"  \"The law may be on your side, but the law upholds a great deal that is oppressive and cruel.\"  \"A curious set of laws we should have if women made them,\" said the squire.  \"They would not bear so heavily upon the poor as they do now.\"  \"Well, I won't stop to discuss the matter.  If you come to entertain different views about the house, send word by Ben, and we will arrange the details without delay.  Mr. Kirk is anxious to move his family as soon as possible, and would like to secure the house at once.\"  \"He will have to wait three months at least,\" said Mrs. Barclay coldly.  \"For that time, I believe the law protects me.\"  \"You are right there; but at the end of that tine you cannot expect as liberal terms as we are now prepared to offer you.\"  \"Liberal!\" repeated the widow, in a meaning tone.  \"So I regard it,\" said the squire stiffly.  \"Good-evening.\"  An hour later Mrs. Barclay's reflections were broken in upon by the ominous clang of the engine bell.  This is a sound which always excites alarm in a country village.  \"Where's the fire?\" she asked anxiously, of a boy who was running by the house.  \"It's Crawford's store!\" was the startling reply.  \"It's blazin' up like anything.  Guess it'll have to go.\"  \"I hope Ben'll keep out of danger,\" thought Mrs. Barclay, as she hurriedly took her shawl and bonnet and started for the scene of excitement.     CHAPTER XIV BEN SHOWS HIMSELF A HERO   A fire in a country village, particularly where the building is a prominent one, is sure to attract a large part of the resident population.  Men, women, and children, as well as the hook and ladder company, hurried to the scene of conflagration.  Everybody felt a personal interest in Crawford's.  It was the great emporium which provided all the families in the village with articles of prime and secondary necessity.  If Paris can be called France, then Crawford's might be called Pentonville.  \"Crawford's on fire!\" exclaimed old Captain Manson.  \"Bless my soul! It cannot be true.  Where's my cane?\"  \"You don't mean to say you're goin' to the fire, father?\" asked his widowed daughter in surprise, for the captain had bowed beneath the weight of eighty-six winters, and rarely left the domestic hearth.  \"Do you think I'd stay at home when Crawford's was a-burning?\" returned the captain.  \"But remember, father, you ain't so young as you used to be.  You might catch your death of cold.\"  \"What!  at a fire?\" exclaimed the old man, laughing at his own joke.  \"You know what I mean.  It's dreadfully imprudent.  Why, I wouldn't go myself.\"  \"Shouldn't think you would, at your time of life!\" retorted her father, chuckling.  So the old man emerged into the street, and hurried as fast as his unsteady limbs would allow, to the fire.  \"How"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],["title","Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#0)"],["body","Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders    OUTLINES OF LESSONS IN BOTANY.

In this study, as in all scientific teaching, the teacher's aim should be to foster in his pupils the power of careful observation and clear expression. The actual amount of knowledge gained at school must needs be small, and often quickly forgotten, but the habit of right study is an invaluable possession.  The former method of teaching Botany was confined almost wholly to dry, technical classification. The pupil learned to find the name and order of a plant, but its structure, its habits, its life in short, were untouched by him. We know now that Nature is the best text-book. The pupil should first ask his questions of her and try to interpret her answers; then he may learn with profit what those who better understand her speech have to tell him.  This method of teaching, however, requires much, very much, of the teacher. He must be himself intelligent, well trained, and able to give time to the preparation of his lessons. It seems to us, who are but amateurs, as if it were impossible to teach thus without a thorough comprehension of the whole field. Our own ignorance oppresses us so much that we feel tempted to say that we cannot attempt it. But if the work of leading children to observe the wonders about them is to be done at all, it must be done by us, who are not masters of our subject, and we must find out for ourselves how we can best accomplish this result, since we have so little to guide us.  It is with the hope that the experience of one who has tried to do this with some fair amount of success may be of use to other puzzled experimenters, that I venture to write out some outlines of lessons in Botany for beginners.  The method of beginning with the simpler forms of life is one that appeals to the scientific tendencies of the day. It seems logical to begin with lower forms and work up to the higher. But this method is only suitable for mature minds. We do not teach a child English by showing him the sources of the language; he learns it by daily use. So also the beginning of the study of any Natural Science by the young should be the observation of the most obvious things about them, the things which they can see, and handle, and experiment upon naturally, without artificial aids. Therefore this book concerns itself only with the Flowering Plants.  The author believes that the simplest botanical study should afford the means of identifying plants, as a large part of the student's pleasure in the science will be the recognition of the things about him. The present volume affords the basis for future classification, which Part II, on flowers, will develop. It is, doubtless, as good a way, perhaps the best, to begin with a single plant, and study root, stem, leaves, and flowers as belonging to a whole, but the problem is complicated by practical difficulties. In our climate there are but two months of the school year when flowers are easily obtained. On the other hand, the material for these lessons can be got throughout the winter, and the class, well trained in methodical work, will begin the study of flowers at the season when every day brings some fresh wonder of beauty.  The author will receive gladly any criticisms or suggestions.  JANE H. NEWELL.  175 Brattle St., Cambridge     INTRODUCTION.   The lessons here outlined are suitable for children of twelve years of age, and upwards. For younger pupils they would require much adaptation, and even then they would not be so good as some simpler method, such as following the growth of one plant, and comparing it with others at every step. The little ones profit most by describing the very simple things that they see, without much reference to theories.  The outlines follow the plan of Dr. Gray's First Lessons and How Plants Grow, and are intended to be used in connection with either of those books. The necessary references will be found at the end of every section. The book contains also references to a course of interesting reading in connection with the subjects of the lessons.  The lessons may begin, like the text-books, with the subject of Germination, if the seeds are planted before they are required for use, but it is generally preferable to use the first recitation with the class for planting the seeds, in order to have them under the direct care of the pupils. Some general talks about plants are therefore put at the beginning to occupy the time until the seedlings are ready for study.  Some Nasturtiums (_Tropæolum majus_) and Morning-Glories should be planted from the first in boxes of earth and allowed to grow over the window, as they are often used for illustrations.     I.  PLANTS AND THEIR USES.[1]   [Footnote 1: This section may be omitted, and the lessons begun with Seedlings, if the teacher prefer.]  What is Botany? The pupils are very apt to say at first that it is learning about _flowers_. The teacher can draw their attention to the fact that flowers are only a part of the plant, and that Botany is also the study of the leaves, the stem, and the root. Botany is the science of _plants_. Ask them what the Geranium is. Tell them to name some other plants. The teacher should keep a few growing plants in the schoolroom for purposes of illustration.  Ask them what else there is in the world besides plants. By this question the three kingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral, are brought up. It will give occasion for a discussion of the earth and what it contains, the mountains, formed of rocks and soil, the plants growing on the earth, and the animals that inhabit it, including man. Let them name the three kingdoms with some example of each. Which of these kingdoms contain living things? The words _organic_ and _inorganic_ can be brought in here. An _organ_ ([Greek: Ergon], meaning work) is any part that does a special work, as the leaves, the stem of a plant, and the eye, the ear of animals. An _organism_ is a living being made up of such organs. The inorganic world contains the mineral kingdom; the organic world includes the vegetable and animal kingdoms.  One's aim in these lessons should always be to tell the pupils as little as possible. Try to lead them to think out these things for themselves.  Ask them how plants differ from animals. They will say that plants are fixed to one place, while animals can move about; that plants have no will or consciousness, and that animals have. These answers are true when we compare the higher animals with plants, but the differences become lost as we descend in the scale and approach the border land where botanist and zoologist meet on a common ground. Sea-anemones are fixed to the rock on which they grow, while some of the lower plants are able to move from place to place, and it is hardly safe to affirm that a jelly-fish is more conscious of its actions than is a Sensitive Plant, the leaves of which close when the stem is touched.  There is no real division between animals and plants. We try to classify the objects about us into groups, according to the closeness of their relationships, but we must always remember that these hard lines are ours, not Nature's. We attempt, for purposes of our own convenience, to divide a whole, which is so bound together that it cannot be separated into parts that we can confidently place on different sides of a dividing line.   1. _Plants as Food-Producers_.--The chief distinguishing characteristic of plants is one that the pupils may be led to think out for themselves by asking them what animals feed upon. To help them with this, ask them what they had for breakfast. Oatmeal is mentioned, perhaps. This is made from oats, which is a plant. Coffee and tea, bread made from wheat, potatoes, etc., all come from plants.[1] Beef, butter and milk come from the cow, but the cow lives upon grass. The plant, on the other hand, is nourished upon mineral or inorganic matter. It can make its own food from the soil and the air, while animals can only live upon that which is made for them by plants. These are thus the link between the mineral and animal kingdoms. Ask the scholars if they can think of anything to eat or drink that does not come from a plant. With a little help they will think of salt and water. These could not support life. So we see that animals receive all their food through the vegetable kingdom. One great use of plants is that they are _food-producers_.  [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany, for use in Schools.
