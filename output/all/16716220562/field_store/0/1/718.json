Friends, no more,                 Our years may he corrupted: 'Tis an age                 We dare not trust our wills to: do you love me?  _Thra_.     Do we love Heaven and honour?  _Phi_.       My Lord _Dion_, you had                 A vertuous Gentlewoman call'd you Father;                 Is she yet alive?  _Di_.        Most honour'd Sir, she is:                 And for the penance but of an idle dream,                 Has undertook a tedious Pilgrimage.                                                    [ _Enter a_ Lady.  _Phi_.       Is it to me, or any of these Gentlemen you come?  _La_.        To you, brave Lord; the Princess would intreat                 Your present company.  _Phi_.       The Princess send for me! y'are mistaken.  _La_.         If you be call'd _Philaster_, 'tis to you.  _Phi_.       Kiss her hand, and say I will attend her.  _Di_.         Do you know what you do?  _Phi_.        Yes, go to see a woman.  _Cle_.        But do you weigh the danger you are in?  _Phi_.        Danger in a sweet face?                  By _Jupiter_ I must not fear a woman.  _Thra_.     But are you sure it was the Princess sent?                 It may be some foul train to catch your life.  _Phi_.       I do not think it Gentlemen: she's noble,                 Her eye may shoot me dead, or those true red                 And white friends in her face may steal my soul out:                 There's all the danger in't: but be what may,                 Her single name hath arm'd me.                                                            [_Ex_. Phil.  _Di_.

[_Ex. Gentlemen_.     _Enter_ Arethusa _and a_ Lady.  _Are_.       Comes he not?  _La_.        Madam?  _Are_.      Will _Philaster_ come?  _La_.        Dear Madam, you were wont                 To credit me at first.  _Are_.      But didst thou tell me so?                 I am forgetful, and my womans strength                 Is so o'recharg'd with danger like to grow                 About my Marriage that these under-things                 Dare not abide in such a troubled sea:                 How look't he, when he told thee he would come?  _La_.        Why, well.  _Are_.      And not a little fearful?  _La_.        Fear Madam? sure he knows not what it is.  _Are_.      You are all of his Faction; the whole Court                 Is bold in praise of him, whilst I                 May live neglected: and do noble things,                 As fools in strife throw gold into the Sea,                 Drown'd in the doing: but I know he fears.  _La_.        Fear? Madam (me thought) his looks hid more                 Of love than fear.  _Are_.      Of love? To whom? to you?                 Did you deliver those plain words I sent,                 With such a winning gesture, and quick look                 That you have caught him?  _La_.        Madam, I mean to you.  _Are_.      Of love to me? Alas! thy ignorance                 Lets thee not see the crosses of our births:                 Nature, that loves not to be questioned                 Why she did this, or that, but has her ends,                 And knows she does well; never gave the world                 Two things so opposite, so contrary,                 As he and I am: If a bowl of blood                 Drawn from this arm of mine, would poyson thee,                 A draught of his would cure thee. Of love to me?  _La_.        Madam, I think I hear him.  _Are_.       Bring him in:                 You gods that would not have your dooms withstood,                 Whose holy wisdoms at this time it is,                 To make the passion of a feeble maid                 The way unto your justice, I obey.                                                         [ _Enter_ Phil.  _La_.       Here is my Lord _Philaster_.  _Are_.     Oh! 'tis well:                 Withdraw your self.  _Phi_.       Madam, your messenger                 Made me believe, you wisht to speak with me.  _Are_.       'Tis true _Philaster,_ but the words are such,                 I have to say, and do so ill beseem                 The mouth of woman, that I wish them said,                 And yet am loth to speak them. Have you known                 That I have ought detracted from your worth?                 Have I in person wrong'd you? or have set                 My baser instruments to throw disgrace                 Upon your vertues?  _Phi_.       Never Madam you.  _Are_.       Why then should you in such a publick place,                 Injure a Princess and a scandal lay                 Upon my fortunes, fam'd to be so great:                 Calling a great part of my dowry in question.  _Phi_.      Madam, this truth which I shall speak, will be                 Foolish: but for your fair and vertuous self,                 I could afford my self to have no right                 To any thing you wish'd.  _Are.        Philaster,_ know                 I must enjoy these Kingdoms.  _Phi_.      Madam, both?  _Are_.      Both or I die: by Fate I die _Philaster,_                 If I not calmly may enjoy them both.  _Phi_.       I would do much to save that Noble life:                 Yet would be loth to have posterity                 Find in our stories, that _Philaster_ gave                 His right unto a Scepter, and a Crown,                 To save a Ladies longing.  _Are_.      Nay then hear:                 I must, and will have them, and more.  _Phi_.      What more?  _Are_.      Or lose that little life the gods prepared,                 To trouble this poor piece of earth withall.  _Phi_.      Madam, what more?  _Are_.      Turn then away thy face.  _Phi_.      No.  _Are_.      Do.  _Phi_.       I cannot endure it: turn away my face?                 I never yet saw enemy that lookt                 So dreadful, but that I thought my self                 As great a Basilisk as he; or spake                 So horribly, but that I thought my tongue                 Bore Thunder underneath, as much as his:                 Nor beast that I could turn from: shall I then                 Begin to fear sweet sounds? a Ladies voice,                 Whom I do love? Say you would have my life,                 Why, I will give it you; for it is of me                 A thing so loath'd, and unto you that ask                 Of so poor use, that I shall make no price                 If you intreat, I will unmov'dly hear.  _Are_.      Yet for my sake a little bend thy looks.  _Phi_.      I do.  _Are_.      Then know I must have them and thee.  _Phi_.      And me?                  _Are_. Thy love: without which, all the Land                 Discovered yet, will serve me for no use,                 But to be buried in.  _Phi_.       Is't possible?  _Are_.       With it, it were too little to bestow                 On thee: Now, though thy breath doth strike me dead                 (Which know it may) I have unript my breast.  _Phi_.       Madam, you are too full of noble thoughts,                 To lay a train for this contemned life,                 Which you may have for asking: to suspect                 Were base, where I deserve no ill: love you!                 By all my hopes I do, above my life:                 But how this passion should proceed from you                 So violently, would amaze a man, that would be jealous.  _Are_.      Another soul into my body shot,                 Could not have fill'd me with more strength and spirit,                 Than this thy breath: but spend not hasty time,                 In seeking how I came thus: 'tis the gods,                 The gods, that make me so; and sure our love                 Will be the nobler, and the better blest,                 In that the secret justice of the gods                 Is mingled with it.  Let us leave and kiss,                 Lest some unwelcome guest should fall betwixt us,                 And we should part without it.                 _Phi_. 'Twill be ill                 I should abide here long.  _Are_.       'Tis true, and worse                 You should come often: How shall we devise                 To hold intelligence? That our true lovers,                 On any new occasion may agree, what path is best to                 tread?  _Phi_.       I have a boy sent by the gods, I hope to this intent,                 Not yet seen in the Court; hunting the Buck,                 I found him sitting by a Fountain side,                 Of which he borrow'd some to quench his thirst,                 And paid the Nymph again as much in tears;                 A Garland lay him by, made by himself,                 Of many several flowers, bred in the bay,                 Stuck in that mystick order, that the rareness                 Delighted me: but ever when he turned                 His tender eyes upon 'um, he would weep,                 As if he meant to make 'um grow again.                 Seeing such pretty helpless innocence                 Dwell in his face, I ask'd him all his story;                 He told me that his Parents gentle dyed,                 Leaving him to the mercy of the fields,                 Which gave him roots; and of the Crystal springs,                 Which did not stop their courses: and the Sun,                 Which still, he thank'd him, yielded him his light,                 Then took he up his Garland and did shew,                 What every flower as Country people hold,                 Did signifie: and how all ordered thus,                 Exprest his grief: and to my thoughts did read                 The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10850"],["title","Philaster; Or, Love Lies a Bleeding (#3)"],["body","lecture of his Country Art                 That could be wisht: so that, me thought, I could                 Have studied it. I gladly entertain'd him,                 Who was glad to follow; and have got                 The trustiest, loving'st, and the gentlest boy,                 That ever Master kept: Him will I send                 To wait on you, and bear our hidden love.                                                       [ _Enter_ Lady.  _Are_.      'Tis well, no more.  _La_.        Madam, the Prince is come to do his service.  _Are_.      What will you do _Philaster_ with your self?  _Phi_.      Why, that which all the gods have appointed out for me.  _Are_.      Dear, hide thy self. Bring in the Prince.  _Phi_.      Hide me from _Pharamond!_                 When Thunder speaks, which is the voice of _Jove,_                 Though I do reverence, yet I hide me not;                 And shall a stranger Prince have leave to brag                 Unto a forreign Nation, that he made _Philaster_                 hide himself?  _Are_.      He cannot know it.  _Phi_.       Though it should sleep for ever to the world,                 It is a simple sin to hide my self,                 Which will for ever on my conscience lie.  _Are_.      Then good _Philaster,_ give him scope and way                 In what he saies: for he is apt to speak                 What you are loth to hear: for my sake do.  _Phi_.       I will.                                            [ _Enter_ Pharamond.  _Pha_.     My Princely Mistress, as true lovers ought,                 I come to kiss these fair hands; and to shew                 In outward Ceremonies, the dear love                 Writ in my heart.  _Phi_.       If I shall have an answer no directlier,                 I am gone.  _Pha_.     To what would he have an answer?  _Are_.      To his claim unto the Kingdom.  _Pha_.     Sirrah, I forbear you before the King.  _Phi_.      Good Sir, do so still, I would not talk with you.  _Pha_.      But now the time is fitter, do but offer                 To make mention of right to any Kingdom,                 Though it be scarce habitable.  _Phi_.      Good Sir, let me go.  _Pha_.     And by my sword.  _Phi_.      Peace _Pharamond:_ if thou--  _Are_.      Leave us Philaster.  _Phi_.      I have done.  _Pha_.     You are gone, by heaven I'le fetch you back.  _Phi_.      You shall not need.  _Pha_.     What now?  _Phi_.      Know Pharamond,                 I loath to brawl with such a blast as thou,                 Who art nought but a valiant voice: But if                 Thou shalt provoke me further, men shall say                 Thou wert, and not lament it. _Pha_.      Do you slight                 My greatness so, and in the Chamber of the Princess!  _Phi_.       It is a place to which I must confess                 I owe a reverence: but wer't the Church,                 I, at the Altar, there's no place so safe,                 Where thou dar'st injure me, but I dare kill thee:                 And for your greatness; know Sir, I can grasp                 You, and your greatness thus, thus into nothing:                 Give not a word, not a word back: Farewell.

I think he would discharge it well. But Madam,                 I hope our hearts are knit; and yet so slow                 The Ceremonies of State are, that 'twill be long                 Before our hands be so: If then you please,                 Being agreed in heart, let us not wait                 For dreaming for me, but take a little stoln                 Delights, and so prevent our joyes to come.  _Are_.      If you dare speak such thoughts,                 I must withdraw in honour.                                                            [_Exit_ Are.  _Pha_.      The constitution of my body will never hold out till                 the wedding; I must seek elsewhere.                                                            [_Exit_ Pha.                    _Actus Secundus.  Scena Prima_.    _Enter_ Philaster _and_ Bellario.  _Phi_.      And thou shalt find her honourable boy,                 Full of regard unto thy tender youth,                 For thine own modesty; and for my sake,                 Apter to give, than thou wilt be to ask, I, or deserve.  _Bell_.      Sir, you did take me up when I was nothing;                 And only yet am something, by being yours;                 You trusted me unknown; and that which you are apt                 To conster a simple innocence in me,                 Perhaps, might have been craft; the cunning of a boy                 Hardened in lies and theft; yet ventur'd you,                 To part my miseries and me: for which,                 I never can expect to serve a Lady                 That bears more honour in her breast than you.  _Phi_.       But boy, it will prefer thee; thou art young,                 And bearest a childish overflowing love                 To them that clap thy cheeks, and speak thee fair yet:                 But when thy judgment comes to rule those passions,                 Thou wilt remember best those careful friends                 That plac'd thee in the noblest way of life;                 She is a Princess I prefer thee to.  _Bell_.      In that small time that I have seen the world,                 I never knew a man hasty to part                 With a servant he thought trusty; I remember                 My Father would prefer the boys he kept                 To greater men than he, but did it not,                 Till they were grown too sawcy for himself.  _Phi_.      Why gentle boy, I find no fault at all in thy behaviour.  _Bell_.      Sir, if I have made                 A fault of ignorance, instruct my youth;                 I shall be willing, if not apt to learn;                 Age and experience will adorn my mind                 With larger knowledge: And if I have done                 A wilful fault, think me not past all hope                 For once; what Master holds so strict a hand                 Over his boy, that he will part with him                 Without one warning? Let me be corrected                 To break my stubbornness if it be so,                 Rather than turn me off, and I shall mend.  _Phi_.       Thy love doth plead so prettily to stay,                 That (trust me) I could weep to part with thee.                 Alas! I do not turn thee off; thou knowest                 It is my business that doth call thee hence,                 And when thou art with her thou dwel'st with me:                 Think so, and 'tis so; and when time is full,                 That thou hast well discharged this heavy trust,                 Laid on so weak a one, I will again                 With joy receive thee; as I live, I will;                 Nay weep not, gentle boy; 'Tis more than time                 Thou didst attend the Princess.  _Bell_.      I am gone;                 But since I am to part with you my Lord,                 And none knows whether I shall live to do                 More service for you; take this little prayer;                 Heaven bless your loves, your fights, all your designs.                 May sick men, if they have your wish, be well;                 And Heavens hate those you curse, though I be one.                                                                  [_Exit_.  _Phi_.      The love of boyes unto their Lords is strange,                 I have read wonders of it; yet this boy                 For my sake, (if a man may judge by looks,                 And speech) would out-do story. I may see                 A day to pay him for his loyalty.                                                              [_Exit_ Phi.    _Enter_ Pharamond.  _Pha_.      Why should these Ladies stay so long? They must                 come this way; I know the Queen imployes 'em not,                 for the Reverend Mother sent me word they would all                 be for the Garden. If they should all prove honest now,                 I were in a fair taking; I was never so long without                 sport in my life, and in my conscience 'tis not my                 fault: Oh, for our Country Ladies! Here's one                 boulted, I'le hound at her.    _Enter_ Galatea.  _Gal_.       Your Grace!  _Pha_.      Shall I not be a trouble?  _Gal_.       Not to me Sir.  _Pha_.      Nay, nay, you are too quick; by this sweet hand.  _Gal_.      You'l be forsworn Sir, 'tis but an old glove. If you                 will talk at distance, I am for you: but good Prince,                 be not bawdy, nor do not brag; these two I bar, and                 then I think, I shall have sence enough to answer                 all the weighty _Apothegmes_ your Royal blood shall                 manage.  _Pha_.     Dear Lady, can you love?  _Gal_.      Dear, Prince, how dear! I ne're cost you a Coach                 yet, nor put you to the dear repentance of a Banquet;                 here's no Scarlet Sir, to blush the sin out it was given                 for: This wyer mine own hair covers: and this face has                 been so far from being dear to any, that it ne're cost                 penny painting: And for the rest of my poor Wardrobe,                 such as you see, it leaves no hand behind it, to make                 the jealous Mercers wife curse our good doings.  _Pha_.      You mistake me Lady.  _Gal_.      Lord, I do so; would you or I could help it.  _Pha_.      Do Ladies of this Country use to give no more respect                 to men of my full being?  _Gal_.       Full being! I understand you not, unless your Grace                 means growing to fatness; and"]]]
