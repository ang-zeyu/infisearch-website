The face of the staff officer was grave, but his voice could not conceal his elation.  \"My general,\" he reported, \"I found this man in the act of giving information to the enemy. There is a wireless--\"  General Andre rose slowly. He looked neither at the officer nor at his prisoner. With frowning eyes he stared down at the maps upon his table.  \"I know,\" he interrupted. \"Some one has already told me.\" He paused, and then, as though recalling his manners, but still without raising his eyes, he added: \"You have done well, sir.\"  In silence the officers of the staff stood motionless. With surprise they noted that, as yet, neither in anger nor curiosity had General Andre glanced at the prisoner. But of the presence of the general the spy was most acutely conscious. He stood erect, his arms still raised, but his body strained forward, and on the averted eyes of the general his own were fixed.  In an agony of supplication they asked a question.  At last, as though against his wish, toward the spy the general turned his head, and their eyes met. And still General Andre was silent. Then the arms of the spy, like those of a runner who has finished his race and breasts the tape exhausted, fell to his sides. In a voice low and vibrant he spoke his question.  \"It has been so long, sir,\" he pleaded. \"May I not come home?\"  General Andre turned to the astonished group surrounding him. His voice was hushed like that of one who speaks across an open grave.  \"Gentlemen,\" he began, \"my children,\" he added. \"A German spy, a woman, involved in a scandal your brother in arms, Henri Ravignac. His honor, he thought, was concerned, and without honor he refused to live. To prove him guiltless his younger brother Charles asked leave to seek out the woman who had betrayed Henri, and by us was detailed on secret service. He gave up home, family, friends. He lived in exile, in poverty, at all times in danger of a swift and ignoble death. In the War Office we know him as one who has given to his country services she cannot hope to reward. For she cannot return to him the years he has lost. She cannot return to him his brother. But she can and will clear the name of Henri Ravignac, and upon his brother Charles bestow promotion and honors.\"  The general turned and embraced the spy. \"My children,\" he said, \"welcome your brother. He has come home.\"  Before the car had reached the fortifications, Marie Gessler had arranged her plan of escape. She had departed from the ch√¢teau without even a hand-bag, and she would say that before the shops closed she must make purchases.  Le Printemps lay in their way, and she asked that, when they reached it, for a moment she might alight. Captain Thierry readily gave permission.  From the department store it would be most easy to disappear, and in anticipation Marie smiled covertly. Nor was the picture of Captain Thierry impatiently waiting outside unamusing.  But before Le Printemps was approached, the car turned sharply down a narrow street. On one side, along its entire length, ran a high gray wall, grim and forbidding. In it was a green gate studded with iron bolts. Before this the automobile drew suddenly to a halt. The crew of the armored car tumbled off the rear seat, and one of them beat upon the green gate. Marie felt a hand of ice clutch at her throat. But she controlled herself.  \"And what is this?\" she cried gayly.  At her side Captain Thierry was smiling down at her, but his smile was hateful.  \"It is the prison of St. Lazare,\" he said. \"It is not becoming,\" he added sternly, \"that the name of the Countess d'Aurillac should be made common as the Paris road!\"  Fighting for her life, Marie thrust herself against him; her arm that throughout the journey had rested on the back of the driving-seat caressed his shoulders; her lips and the violet eyes were close to his.  \"Why should you care?\" she whispered fiercely. \"You have _me_! Let the Count d'Aurillac look after the honor of his wife himself.\"  The charming Thierry laughed at her mockingly.  \"He means to,\" he said. \"I _am_ the Count d'Aurillac!\"     PLAYING DEAD   To fate, \"Jimmie\" Blagwin had signalled the \"supreme gesture.\" He had accomplished the Great Adventure. He was dead.  And as he sat on his trunk in the tiny hall bedroom, and in the afternoon papers read of his suicide, his eyes were lit with pleasurable pride. Not at the nice things the obituaries told of his past, but because his act of self-sacrifice, so carefully considered, had been carried to success. As he read Jimmie smiled with self-congratulation. He felt glad he was alive; or, to express it differently, felt glad he was dead. And he hoped Jeanne, his late wife, now his widow, also would be glad. But not _too_ glad. In return for relieving Jeanne of his presence he hoped she might at times remember him with kindness. Of her always would he think gratefully and tenderly. Nothing could end his love for Jeanne--not even this suicide.  As children, in winter in New York, in summer on Long Island, Jimmie Blagwin and Jeanne Thayer had grown up together. They had the same tastes in sports, the same friends, the same worldly advantages. Neither of them had many ideas. It was after they married that Jeanne began to borrow ideas and doubt the advantages.  For the first three years after the wedding, in the old farmhouse which Jimmie had made over into a sort of idealized country club, Jeanne lived a happy, healthy, out-of-door existence. To occupy her there were Jimmie's hunters and a pack of joyous beagles; for tennis, at week-ends Jimmie filled the house with men, and during the week they both played polo, he with the Meadow Brooks and she with the Meadow Larks, and the golf links of Piping Rock ran almost to their lodge-gate. Until Proctor Maddox took a cottage at Glen Cove and joined the golf-club, than Jeanne and Jimmie on all Long Island no couple were so content.  At that time Proctor Maddox was the young and brilliant editor of the _Wilderness_ magazine, the wilderness being the world we live in, and the Voice crying in it the voice of Proctor Maddox. He was a Socialist and Feminist, he flirted with syndicalism, and he had a good word even for the I.W.W. He was darkly handsome, his eyeglasses were fastened to a black ribbon, and he addressed his hostess as \"dear lady.\" He was that sort. Women described him as \"dangerous,\" and liked him because he talked of things they did not understand, and because he told each of them it was easy to see it would be useless to flatter _her_. The men did not like him. The oldest and wealthiest members of the club protested that the things Maddox said in his magazine should exclude him from the society of law-abiding, money-making millionaires. But Freddy Bayliss, the leader of the younger crowd, said that, to him, it did not matter what Maddox said in the _Wilderness_, so long as he stayed there. It was Bayliss who christened him \"the Voice.\"  Until the Voice came to Glen Cove all that troubled Jeanne was that her pony had sprained a tendon, and that in the mixed doubles her eye was off the ball. Proctor Maddox suggested other causes for discontent.  \"What does it matter,\" he demanded, \"whether you hit a rubber ball inside a whitewashed line, or not? That energy, that brain, that influence of yours over others, that something men call--charm, should be exerted to emancipate yourself and your unfortunate sisters.\"  \"Emaciate myself,\" protested Jeanne eagerly; \"do you mean I'm taking on flesh?\"  \"I said 'emancipate,'\" corrected Maddox. \"I mean to free yourself of the bonds that bind your sex; for instance, the bonds of matrimony. It is obsolete, barbarous. It makes of women--slaves and chattels.\"  \"But, since I married, I'm _much_ freer,\" protested Jeanne. \"Mother never let me play polo, or ride astride. But Jimmie lets me. He says cross saddle is safer.\"  \"Jimmie _lets_ you!\" mocked the Voice. \"_That_ is exactly what I mean. Why should you go to him, or to any man, for permission? Are you his cook asking for an evening out? No! You are a free soul, and your duty is to keep your soul from bondage. There are others in the world besides your husband. What of your duty to them? Have you ever thought of them?\"  \"No, I have not,\" confessed Jeanne. \"Who do you mean by 'them'? Shop-girls, and white slaves, and women who want to vote?\"  \"I mean the great army of the discontented,\" explained the Voice.  \"And should I be discontented?\" asked Jeanne. \"Tell me why.\"  So, then and on many other occasions, Maddox told her why. It was one of the best things he did.  People say, when the triangle forms, the husband always is the last to see. But, if he loves his wife, he is the first. And after three years of being married to Jeanne, and, before that, five years of wanting to marry Jeanne, Jimmie loved her devotedly, entirely, slavishly. It was the best thing _he_ did. So, when to Jeanne the change came, her husband recognized it. What the cause was he could not fathom; he saw only that, in spite of her impatient denials, she was discontented, restless, unhappy. Thinking it might be that for too long they had gone \"back to the land,\" he suggested they might repeat their honeymoon in Paris. The idea was received only with alarm. Concerning Jeanne, Jimmie decided secretly to consult a doctor. Meanwhile he bought her a new hunter.  The awakening came one night at a dance at the country club. That evening Jeanne was filled with unrest, and with Jimmie seemed particularly aggrieved. Whatever he said gave offense; even his eagerness to conciliate her was too obvious. With the other men who did not dance, Jimmie was standing in the doorway when, over the heads of those looking in from the veranda, he saw the white face and black eyes of Maddox. Jimmie knew Maddox did not dance, at those who danced had heard him jeer, and his presence caused him mild surprise. The editor,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11144"],["title","Somewhere in France (#5)"],["body"," leaning forward, unconscious that he was conspicuous, searched the ballroom with his eyes. They were anxious, unsatisfied; they gave to his pale face the look of one who is famished. Then suddenly his face lit and he nodded eagerly. Following the direction of his eyes, Jimmie saw his wife, over the shoulder of her partner, smiling at Maddox. Her face was radiant; a great peace had descended upon it.  Jimmie knew just as surely as though Jeanne had told him. He walked out and sat down on the low wall of the terrace with his back to the club-house and his legs dangling. Below him in the moonlight lay the great basin of the golf links, the white rectangle of the polo fields with the gallows-like goals, and on a hill opposite, above the tree-tops, the chimneys of his house. He was down for a tennis match the next morning, and the sight of his home suggested to him only that he ought to be in bed and asleep.  Then he recognized that he never would sleep again. He went over it from the beginning, putting the pieces together. He never had liked Maddox, but he had explained that by the fact that, as Maddox was so much more intelligent than he, there could be little between them. And it was because every one said he was so intelligent that he had looked upon his devotion to Jeanne rather as a compliment. He wondered why already it had not been plain to him. When Jeanne, who mocked at golf as a refuge for old age, spent hours with Maddox on the links; when, after she had declined to ride with her husband, on his return he would find her at tea with Maddox in front of the wood fire.  That night, when he drove Jeanne home, she still was joyous, radiant; it was now she who chided him upon being silent.  He waited until noon the next morning and then asked her if it were true. It was true. Jeanne thanked him for coming to her so honestly and straightforwardly. She also had been straightforward and honest. They had waited, she said, not through deceit but only out of consideration for him.  \"Before we told you,\" Jeanne explained, \"we wanted to be quite sure that _I_ was sure.\"  The \"we\" hurt Jimmie like the stab of a rusty knife.  But he said only: \"And you _are_ sure? Three years ago you were sure you loved _me_.\"  Jeanne's eyes were filled with pity, but she said: \"That was three years ago. I was a child, and now I am a woman. In many ways you have stood still and I have gone on.\"  \"That's true,\" said Jimmie; \"you always were too good for me.\"  \"_No_ woman is good enough for you,\" returned Jeanne loyally. \"And your brains are just as good as mine, only you haven't used them. I have questioned and reached out and gained knowledge of all kinds. I am a Feminist and you are not. If you were you would understand.\"  \"I don't know even what a Feminist is,\" said Jimmie, \"but I'm glad I'm not one.\"  \"A Feminist is one,\" explained Jeanne, \"who does not think her life should be devoted to one person, but to the world.\"  Jimmie shook his head and smiled miserably.  \"_You_ are _my_ world,\" he said. \"The only world I know. The only world I want to know.\"  He walked to the fireplace and leaned his elbows on the mantel, and buried his head in his hands. But that his distress might not hurt Jeanne, he turned and, to give her courage, smiled.  \"If you are going to devote yourself to the World,\" he asked, \"and not to any one person, why can't I sort of trail along? Why need you leave me and go with--with some one else?\"  \"For the work I hope to do,\" answered Jeanne, \"you and I are not suited. But Proctor and I are suited. He says he never met a woman who understands him as I do.\"  \"Hell!\" said Jimmie. After that he did not speak for some time. Then he asked roughly:  \"He's going to marry you, of course?\"  Jeanne flushed crimson.  \"Of course!\" she retorted. Her blush looked like indignation, and so Jimmie construed it, but it was the blush of embarrassment. For Maddox considered the ceremony of marriage an ignoble and barbaric bond. It degraded the woman, he declared, in making her a slave, and the man in that he accepted such a sacrifice. Jeanne had not argued with him. Until she were free, to discuss it with him seemed indecent. But in her own mind there was no doubt. If she were to be the helpmate of Proctor Maddox in uplifting the world, she would be Mrs. Proctor Maddox; or, much as he was to her, each would uplift the world alone. But she did not see the necessity of explaining all this to Jimmie, so she said: \"Of course!\"  \"I will see the lawyers to-morrow,\" said Jimmie. \"It will take some time to arrange, and so,\" he added hopefully, \"you can think it over.\"  Jeanne exclaimed miserably:  \"I have thought of nothing else,\" she cried, \"for six months!\"  Jimmie bent above her and laid his hand upon her shoulder.  \"I am sorry, so sorry,\" he said. \"If I'd any brains I'd have seen how it was long ago. Now I'll not waste time. You'll be rid of me as quick as the courts can fix it.\"  He started for the door, but Jeanne caught his hand.  \"Won't you kiss me, Jimmie?\" she said.  Jimmie hesitated unhappily and Jeanne raised her eyes to his.  \"Not since we were married, Jimmie,\" she said, \"has any one kissed me but you.\"  So Jimmie bent and kissed her. She clung to his sleeve.  \"Jimmie,\" she begged, \"you haven't told me you forgive me. Unless you forgive me I can't go on with it. Tell me you forgive me!\"  \"Forgive you?\" protested Jimmie. \"I love you!\"  When Jimmie went to the office of the lawyer, who also was his best friend, and told him that Jennie wanted a separation, that young man kicked the waste-paper basket against the opposite wall.  \"I'll not do it,\" he protested, \"and I won't let you do it, either. Why should you smear your name and roll in the dirt and play dead to please Jeanne? If Jeanne thinks I'm going to send you to a Raines hotel and follow you up with detectives to furnish her with a fake divorce, you can tell her I won't. What are they coming to?\" demanded the best friend. \"What do they want? A man gives a woman all his love, all his thoughts, gives her his name, his home; only asks to work his brains out for her, only asks to see her happy. And she calls it 'charity,' calls herself a 'slave'!\" The best friend kicked violently at the place where the waste-basket had been. \"_Give_ them the vote, I say,\" he shouted. \"It's all they're good for!\"  The violence of his friend did not impress Jimmie. As he walked up-town the only part of the interview he carried with him was that there must be no scandal. Not on his account. If Jeanne wished it, he assured himself, in spite of the lawyer, he was willing, in the metaphor of that gentleman, to \"roll in the dirt and play dead.\" \"Play dead!\" The words struck him full in the face. Were he dead and out of the way, Jeanne, without a touch of scandal, could marry the man she loved. Jimmie halted in his tracks. He believed he saw the only possible exit. He turned into a side street, and between the silent houses, closed for the summer, worked out his plan. For long afterward that city block remained in his memory; the doctors' signs on the sills, the caretakers seeking the air, the chauffeurs at the cab rank. For hours they watched the passing and repassing of the young man, who with bent head and fixed eyes struck at the pavement with his stick.  That he should really kill himself Jimmie did not for a moment contemplate. To him self-destruction appeared only as an offense against nature. On his primitive, out-of-door, fox-hunting mind the ethics of suicide lay as uneasily as absinthe on the stomach of a baby. But, he argued, by _pretending_ he were dead, he could set Jeanne free, could save her from gossip, and could still dream of her, love her, and occupy with her, if not the same continent, the same world.  He had three problems to solve, and as he considered them he devotedly wished he might consult with a brain more clever than his own. But an accomplice was out of the question. Were he to succeed, everybody must be fooled; no one could share his secret. It was \"a lone game, played alone, and without my partner.\"  The three problems were: first, in order to protect his wife, to provide for the suicide a motive other than the attentions of Maddox; second, to make the suicide look like a real suicide; third, without later creating suspicion, to draw enough money from the bank to keep himself alive after he was dead. For his suicide Jeanne must not hold herself to blame; she must not believe her conduct forced his end; above every one else, she must be persuaded that in bringing about his death she was completely innocent. What reasons then were accepted for suicide?  As to this, Jimmie, refusing to consider the act justified for any reason, was somewhat at a loss. He had read of men who, owing to loss of honor, loss of fortune, loss of health, had \"gone out.\" He was determined he owed it to himself not to go out under a cloud, and he could not lose his money, as then there would be none to leave Jeanne; so he must lose his health. As except for broken arms and collar-bones he never had known a sick-bed, this last was as difficult as the others, but it must serve. After much consideration he decided he would go blind. At least he would pretend he was going blind. To give a semblance of truth to this he would that day consult distinguished oculists and, in spite of their assurances, would tell them that slowly and surely his eyesight was failing him. He would declare to them, in the dread of such a catastrophe, he was of a mind to seek self-destruction. To others he would confide the secret of his blindness and his resolution not to survive it. And, later, all of these would remember and testify.  The question of money also was difficult. After his death he no longer could sign a check or negotiate securities. He must have cash. But if from the bank he drew large sums of actual money, if he converted stocks and bonds into cash and a week later disappeared, apparently forever, questions as"]]]
