Come on, youngster, an' take yer shot.\"  The youth came forward with evident reluctance. \"It's of no manner o' use,\" he whispered to Joe Blunt as he passed, \"I can't depend on my old gun.\"  \"Never give in,\" whispered Blunt, encouragingly.  Poor Varley's want of confidence in his rifle was merited, for, on pulling the trigger, the faithless lock missed fire.  \"Lend him another gun,\" cried several voices.  \"'Gainst rules laid down by Major Hope,\" said Scraggs.  \"Well, so it is; try again.\"  Varley did try again, and so successfully, too, that the ball hit the nail on the head, leaving a portion of the lead sticking to its edge.  Of course this was greeted with a cheer, and a loud dispute began as to which was the better shot of the two.  \"There are others to shoot yet,\" cried the major. \"Make way. Look out.\"  The men fell back, and the few hunters who had not yet fired took their shots, but without coming nearer the mark.  It was now agreed that Jim Scraggs and Dick Varley, being the two best shots, should try over again, and it was also agreed that Dick should have the use of Blunt's rifle. Lots were again drawn for the first shot, and it fell to Dick, who immediately stepped out, aimed somewhat hastily, and fired.  \"Hit again!\" shouted those who had run forward to examine the mark. \"_Half_ the bullet cut off by the nail head!\"  Some of the more enthusiastic of Dick's friends cheered lustily, but the most of the hunters were grave and silent, for they knew Jim's powers, and felt that he would certainly do his best. Jim now stepped up to the line, and, looking earnestly at the mark, threw forward his rifle.  At that moment our friend Crusoe, tired of tormenting his mother, waddled stupidly and innocently into the midst of the crowd of men, and in so doing received Henri's heel and the full weight of his elephantine body on its fore paw. The horrible and electric yell that instantly issued from his agonized throat could only be compared, as Joe Blunt expressed it, \"to the last dyin' screech o' a bustin' steam biler!\" We cannot say that the effect was startling, for these backwoodsmen had been born and bred in the midst of alarms, and were so used to them that a \"bustin' steam biler\" itself, unless it had blown them fairly off their legs, would not have startled them. But the effect, such as it was, was sufficient to disconcert the aim of Jim Scraggs, who fired at the same instant, and missed the nail by a hair's-breadth.  'Turning round in towering wrath, Scraggs aimed a kick at the poor pup, which, had it taken effect, would certainly have terminated the innocent existence of that remarkable dog on the spot; but quick as lightning Henri interposed the butt of his rifle, and Jim's shin met it with a violence that caused him to howl with rage and pain.  \"Oh! pardon me, broder,\" cried Henri, shrinking back, with the drollest expression of mingled pity and glee.  Jim's discretion, on this occasion, was superior to his valour; he turned away with a coarse expression of anger and left the ground.  Meanwhile the major handed the silver rifle to young Varley. \"It couldn't have fallen into better hands,\" he said. \"You'll do it credit, lad, I know that full well; and let me assure you it will never play you false. Only keep it clean, don't overcharge it, aim true, and it will never miss the mark.\"  While the hunters crowded round Dick to congratulate him and examine the piece, he stood with a mingled feeling of bashfulness and delight at his unexpected good fortune. Recovering himself suddenly, he seized his old rifle, and dropping quietly to the outskirts of the crowd, while the men were still busy handling and discussing the merits of the prize, went up, unobserved, to a boy of about thirteen years of age, and touched him on the shoulder.  \"Here, Marston, you know I often said ye should have the old rifle when I was rich enough to get a new one. Take it _now_, lad. It's come to ye sooner than either o' us expected.\"  \"Dick,\" said the boy, grasping his friend's hand warmly, \"ye're true as heart of oak. It's good of 'ee; that's a fact.\"  \"Not a bit, boy; it costs me nothin' to give away an old gun that I've no use for, an's worth little, but it makes me right glad to have the chance to do it.\"  Marston had longed for a rifle ever since he could walk; but his prospects of obtaining one were very poor indeed at that time, and it is a question whether he did not at that moment experience as much joy in handling the old piece as his friend felt in shouldering the prize.  A difficulty now occurred which had not before been thought of. This was no less than the absolute refusal of Dick Varley's canine property to follow him. Fan had no idea of changing masters without her consent being asked or her inclination being consulted.  \"You'll have to tie her up for a while, I fear,\" said the major.  \"No fear,\" answered the youth. \"Dog natur's like human natur'!\"  Saying this he seized Crusoe by the neck, stuffed him comfortably into the bosom of his hunting-shirt, and walked rapidly away with the prize rifle on his shoulder.  Fan had not bargained for this. She stood irresolute, gazing now to the right and now to the left, as the major retired in one direction and Dick with Crusoe in another. Suddenly Crusoe, who, although comfortable in body, was ill at ease in spirit, gave utterance to a melancholy howl. The mother's love instantly prevailed. For one moment she pricked up her ears at the sound, and then, lowering them, trotted quietly after her new master, and followed him to his cottage on the margin of the lake.    CHAPTER III.   _Speculative remarks with which the reader may or may not agree--An old woman--Hopes and wishes commingled with hard facts--The dog Crusoe's education begun_.  It is pleasant to look upon a serene, quiet, humble face. On such a face did Richard Varley look every night when he entered his mother's cottage. Mrs. Varley was a widow, and she had followed the fortunes of her brother, Daniel Hood, ever since the death of her husband. Love for her only brother induced her to forsake the peaceful village of Maryland and enter upon the wild life of a backwoods settlement. Dick's mother was thin, and old, and wrinkled, but her face was stamped with a species of beauty which _never_ fades--the beauty of a loving look. Ah! the brow of snow and the peach-bloom cheek may snare the heart of man for a time, but the _loving look_ alone can forge that adamantine chain that time, age, eternity shall never break.  Mistake us not, reader, and bear with us if we attempt to analyze this look which characterized Mrs. Varley. A rare diamond is worth stopping to glance at, even when one is in a hurry. The brightest jewel in the human heart is worth a thought or two. By _a loving_ _look_ we do not mean a look of love bestowed on a beloved object. _That_ is common enough; and thankful should we be that it is so common in a world that's overfull of hatred. Still less do we mean that smile and look of intense affection with which some people--good people too--greet friend and foe alike, and by which effort to work out their _beau ideal_ of the expression of Christian love they do signally damage their cause, by saddening the serious and repelling the gay. Much less do we mean that _perpetual_ smile of good-will which argues more of personal comfort and self-love than anything else. No; the loving look we speak of is as often grave as gay. Its character depends very much on the face through which it beams. And it cannot be counterfeited. Its _ring_ defies imitation. Like the clouded sun of April, it can pierce through tears of sorrow; like the noontide sun of summer, it can blaze in warm smiles; like the northern lights of winter, it can gleam in depths of woe;--but it is always the same, modified, doubtless, and rendered more or less patent to others, according to the natural amiability of him or her who bestows it. No one can put it on; still less can any one put it off. Its range is universal; it embraces all mankind, though, _of course_, it is intensified on a few favoured objects; its seat is in the depths of a renewed heart, and its foundation lies in love to God.  Young Varley's mother lived in a cottage which was of the smallest possible dimensions consistent with comfort. It was made of logs, as, indeed, were all the other cottages in the valley. The door was in the centre, and a passage from it to the back of the dwelling divided it into two rooms. One of these was sub-divided by a thin partition, the inner room being Mrs. Varley's bedroom, the outer Dick's. Daniel Hood's dormitory was a corner of the kitchen, which apartment served also as a parlour.  The rooms were lighted by two windows, one on each side of the door, which gave to the house the appearance of having a nose and two eyes. Houses of this kind have literally got a sort of _expression_ on--if we may use the word--their countenances. _Square_ windows give the appearance of easy-going placidity; _longish_ ones, that of surprise. Mrs. Varley's was a surprise cottage; and this was in keeping with the scene in which it stood, for the clear lake in front, studded with islands, and the distant hills beyond, composed a scene so surprisingly beautiful that it never failed to call forth an expression of astonished admiration from every new visitor to the Mustang Valley.  \"My boy,\" exclaimed Mrs. Varley, as her son entered the cottage with a bound, \"why so hurried to-day? Deary me! where got you the grand gun?\"  \"Won it, mother!\"  \"Won it, my son?\"  \"Ay, won it, mother. Druve the nail _almost_, and would ha' druve it _altogether_ had I bin more used to Joe Blunt's rifle.\"  Mrs. Varley's heart beat high, and her face flushed with pride as she gazed at her son, who laid the rifle on the table for her inspection, while he rattled off an animated and somewhat disjointed account of the match.  \"Deary me! now that was good, that was cliver. But what's that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10929"],["title","The Dog Crusoe and His Master: A Story of Adventure in the Western Prairies (#4)"],["body","at the door?\"  \"Oh! that's Fan; I forgot her. Here! here! Fan! Come in, good dog,\" he cried, rising and opening the door.  Fan entered and stopped short, evidently uncomfortable.  \"My boy, what do ye with the major's dog?\"  \"Won her too, mother!\"  \"Won her, my son?\"  \"Ay, won her, and the pup too; see, here it is!\" and he plucked Crusoe from his bosom.  Crusoe having found his position to be one of great comfort had fallen into a profound slumber, and on being thus unceremoniously awakened he gave forth a yelp of discontent that brought Fan in a state of frantic sympathy to his side.  \"There you are, Fan; take it to a corner and make yourself at home.--Ay, that's right, mother, give her somethin' to eat; she's hungry, I know by the look o' her eye.\"  \"Deary me, Dick!\" said Mrs. Varley, who now proceeded to spread the youth's mid-day meal before him, \"did ye drive the nail three times?\"  \"No, only once, and that not parfetly. Brought 'em all down at one shot--rifle, Fan, an' pup!\"  \"Well, well, now that was cliver; but--.\" Here the old woman paused and looked grave.  \"But what, mother?\"  \"You'll be wantin' to go off to the mountains now, I fear me, boy.\"  \"Wantin' _now_!\" exclaimed the youth earnestly; \"I'm _always_ wantin'. I've bin wantin' ever since I could walk; but I won't go till you let me, mother, that I won't!\" And he struck the table with his fist so forcibly that the platters rung again.  \"You're a good boy, Dick; but you're too young yit to ventur' among the Redskins.\"  \"An' yit, if I don't ventur' young, I'd better not ventur' at all. You know, mother dear, I don't want to leave you; but I was born to be a hunter, and everybody in them parts is a hunter, and I can't hunt in the kitchen you know, mother!\"  At this point the conversation was interrupted by a sound that caused young Varley to spring up and seize his rifle, and Fan to show her teeth and growl.  \"Hist, mother! that's like horses' hoofs,\" he whispered, opening the door and gazing intently in the direction whence the sound came.  Louder and louder it came, until an opening in the forest showed the advancing cavalcade to be a party of white men. In another moment they were in full view--a band of about thirty horsemen, clad in the leathern costume and armed with the long rifle of the far west. Some wore portions of the gaudy Indian dress, which gave to them a brilliant, dashing look. They came on straight for the block-house, and saluted the Varleys with a jovial cheer as they swept past at full speed. Dick returned the cheer with compound interest, and calling out, \"They're trappers, mother; I'll be back in an hour,\" bounded off like a deer through the woods, taking a short cut in order to reach the block-house before them. He succeeded, for, just as he arrived at the house, the cavalcade wheeled round the bend in the river, dashed up the slope, and came to a sudden halt on the green. Vaulting from their foaming steeds they tied them to the stockades of the little fortress, which they entered in a body.  Hot haste was in every motion of these men. They were trappers, they said, on their way to the Rocky Mountains to hunt and trade furs. But one of their number had been treacherously murdered and scalped by a Pawnee chief, and they resolved to revenge his death by an attack on one of the Pawnee villages. They would teach these \"red reptiles\" to respect white men, they would, come of it what might; and they had turned aside here to procure an additional supply of powder and lead.  In vain did the major endeavour to dissuade these reckless men from their purpose. They scoffed at the idea of returning good for evil, and insisted on being supplied. The log hut was a store as well as a place of defence, and as they offered to pay for it there was no refusing their request--at least so the major thought. The ammunition was therefore given to them, and in half-an-hour they were away again at full gallop over the plains on their mission of vengeance. \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\" But these men knew not what God said, because they never read his Word and did not own his sway.  Young Varley's enthusiasm was considerably damped when he learned the errand on which the trappers were bent. From that time forward he gave up all desire to visit the mountains in company with such men, but he still retained an intense longing to roam at large among their rocky fastnesses and gallop out upon the wide prairies.  Meanwhile he dutifully tended his mother's cattle and sheep, and contented himself with an occasional deer-hunt in the neighbouring forests. He devoted himself also to the training of his dog Crusoe--an operation which at first cost him many a deep sigh.  Every one has heard of the sagacity and almost reasoning capabilities of the Newfoundland dog. Indeed, some have even gone the length of saying that what is called instinct in these animals is neither more nor less than reason. And in truth many of the noble, heroic, and sagacious deeds that have actually been performed by Newfoundland dogs incline us almost to believe that, like man, they are gifted with reasoning powers.  But every one does not know the trouble and patience that is required in order to get a juvenile dog to understand what its master means when he is endeavouring to instruct it.  Crusoe's first lesson was an interesting but not a very successful one. We may remark here that Dick Varley had presented Fan to his mother to be her watch-dog, resolving to devote all his powers to the training of the pup. We may also remark, in reference to Crusoe's appearance (and we did not remark it sooner, chiefly because up to this period in his eventful history he was little better than a ball of fat and hair), that his coat was mingled jet-black and pure white, and remarkably glossy, curly, and thick.  A week after the shooting-match Crusoe's education began. Having fed him for that period with his own hand, in order to gain his affection, Dick took him out one sunny forenoon to the margin of the lake to give him his first lesson.  And here again we must pause to remark that, although a dog's heart is generally gained in the first instance through his mouth, yet, after it is thoroughly gained, his affection is noble and disinterested. He can scarcely be driven from his master's side by blows; and even when thus harshly repelled, is always ready, on the shortest notice and with the slightest encouragement, to make it up again.  Well; Dick Varley began by calling out, \"Crusoe! Crusoe! come here, pup.\"  Of course Crusoe knew his name by this time, for it had been so often used as a prelude to his meals that he naturally expected a feed whenever he heard it. This portal to his brain had already been open for some days; but all the other doors were fast locked, and it required a great deal of careful picking to open them.  \"Now, Crusoe, come here.\"  Crusoe bounded clumsily to his master's side, cocked his ears, and wagged his tail,--so far his education was perfect. We say he bounded _clumsily_, for it must be remembered that he was still a very young pup, with soft, flabby muscles.  \"Now, I'm goin' to begin yer edication, pup; think o' that.\"  Whether Crusoe thought of that or not we cannot say, but he looked up in his master's face as he spoke, cocked his ears very high, and turned his head slowly to one side, until it could not turn any farther in that direction; then he turned it as much to the other side; whereat his master burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, and Crusoe immediately began barking vociferously.  \"Come, come,\" said Dick, suddenly checking his mirth, \"we mustn't play, pup, we must work.\"  Drawing a leathern mitten from his belt, the youth held it to Crusoe's nose, and then threw it a yard away, at the same time exclaiming in a loud, distinct tone, \"Fetch it.\"  Crusoe entered at once into the spirit of this part of his training; he dashed gleefully at the mitten, and proceeded to worry it with intense gratification. As for \"Fetch it,\" he neither understood the words nor cared a straw about them.  Dick Varley rose immediately, and rescuing the mitten, resumed his seat on a rock.  \"Come here, Crusoe,\" he repeated.  \"Oh! certainly, by all means,\" said Crusoe--no! he didn't exactly _say_ it, but really he _looked_ these words so evidently that we think it right to let them stand as they are written. If he could have finished the sentence, he would certainly have said, \"Go on with that game over again, old boy; it's quite to my taste--the jolliest thing in life, I assure you!\" At least, if we may not positively assert that he would have said that, no one else can absolutely affirm that he wouldn't.  Well, Dick Varley did do it over again, and Crusoe worried the mitten over again, utterly regardless of \"Fetch it.\"  Then they did it again, and again, and again, but without the slightest apparent advancement in the path of canine knowledge; and then they went home.  During all this trying operation Dick Varley never once betrayed the slightest feeling of irritability or impatience. He did not expect success at first; he was not therefore disappointed at failure.  Next day he had him out again--and the next--and the next--and the next again, with the like unfavourable result. In short, it seemed at last as if Crusoe's mind had been deeply imbued with the idea that he had been born expressly for the purpose of worrying that mitten, and he meant to fulfil his destiny to the letter.  Young Varley had taken several small pieces of meat in his pocket each day, with the intention of rewarding Crusoe when he should at length be prevailed on to fetch the mitten; but as Crusoe was not aware of the treat that awaited him, of course the mitten never was \"fetched.\"  At last Dick Varley saw that this system would never do, so he changed his tactics, and the next morning gave Crusoe no breakfast, but took him out at the usual hour to go through his lesson.
