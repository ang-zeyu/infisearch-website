The Shadow was large enough to include both house and grounds, but farther than that I could not see.... Dismissing it, I fell to reading my purloined book again. Before I turned another page, however, another startling detail leaped out at me: the figure of Mrs. Franklyn in the Shadow was not living. It floated helplessly, like a doll or puppet that has no life in it. It was both pathetic and dreadful.  Any one who sits in reverie thus, of course, may see similar ridiculous pictures when the will no longer guides construction. The incongruities of dreams are thus explained. I merely record the picture as it came. That it remained by me for several days, just as vivid dreams do, is neither here nor there. I did not allow myself to dwell upon it. The curious thing, perhaps, is that from this moment I date my inclination, though not yet my desire, to leave. I purposely say \"to leave.\"  I cannot quite remember when the word changed to that aggressive, frantic thing which is escape.     Chapter V   We were left delightfully to ourselves in this pretentious country mansion with the soul of a villa. Frances took up her painting again, and, the weather being propitious, spent hours out of doors, sketching flowers, trees and nooks of woodland, garden, even the house itself where bits of it peered suggestively across the orchards. Mrs. Franklyn seemed always busy about something or other, and never interfered with us except to propose motoring, tea in another part of the lawn, and so forth. She flitted everywhere, preoccupied, yet apparently doing nothing. The house engulfed her rather. No visitor called. For one thing, she was not supposed to be back from abroad yet; and for another, I think, the neighborhood--her husband's neighborhood--was puzzled by her sudden cessation from good works. Brigades and temperance societies did not ask to hold their meetings in the big hall, and the vicar arranged the school-treats in another's field without explanation. The full-length portrait in the dining room, and the presence of the housekeeper with the \"burnt\" back hair, indeed, were the only reminders of the man who once had lived here. Mrs. Marsh retained her place in silence, well-paid sinecure as it doubtless was, yet with no hint of that suppressed disapproval one might have expected from her. Indeed there was nothing positive to disapprove, since nothing \"worldly\" entered grounds or building. In her master's lifetime she had been another \"brand snatched from the burning,\" and it had then been her custom to give vociferous \"testimony\" at the revival meetings where he adorned the platform and led in streams of prayer. I saw her sometimes on the stairs, hovering, wandering, half-watching and half-listening, and the idea came to me once that this woman somehow formed a link with the departed influence of her bigoted employer. She, alone among us, belonged to the house, and looked at home there. When I saw her talking --oh, with such correct and respectful mien--to Mrs. Franklyn, I had the feeling that for all her unaggressive attitude, she yet exerted some influence that sought to make her mistress stay in the building forever --live there. She would prevent her escape, prevent \"getting it straight again,\" thwart somehow her will to freedom, if she could. The idea in me was of the most fleeting kind. But another time, when I came down late at night to get a book from the library antechamber, and found her sitting in the hall--alone--the impression left upon me was the reverse of fleeting. I can never forget the vivid, disagreeable effect it produced upon me. What was she doing there at half-past eleven at night, all alone in the darkness? She was sitting upright, stiff, in a big chair below the clock. It gave me a turn. It was so incongruous and odd. She rose quietly as I turned the corner of the stairs, and asked me respectfully, her eyes cast down as usual, whether I had finished with the library, so that she might lock up. There was no more to it than that; but the picture stayed with me--unpleasantly.  These various impressions came to me at odd moments, of course, and not in a single sequence as I now relate them. I was hard at work before three days were past, not writing, as explained, but reading, making notes, and gathering material from the library for future use. It was in chance moments that these curious flashes came, catching me unawares with a touch of surprise that sometimes made me start. For they proved that my under-mind was still conscious of the Shadow, and that far away out of sight lay the cause of it that left me with a vague unrest, unsettled, seeking to \"nest\" in a place that did not want me. Only when this deeper part knows harmony, perhaps, can good brainwork result, and my inability to write was thus explained.  Certainly, I was always seeking for something here I could not find--an explanation that continually evaded me. Nothing but these trivial hints offered themselves. Lumped together, however, they had the effect of defining the Shadow a little. I became more and more aware of its very real existence. And, if I have made little mention of Frances and my hostess in this connection, it is because they contributed at first little or nothing towards the discovery of what this story tries to tell. Our life was wholly external, normal, quiet, and uneventful; conversation banal--Mrs. Franklyn's conversation in particular. They said nothing that suggested revelation.  Both were in this Shadow, and both knew that they were in it, but neither betrayed by word or act a hint of interpretation. They talked privately, no doubt, but of that I can report no details.  And so it was that, after ten days of a very commonplace visit, I found myself looking straight into the face of a Strangeness that defied capture at close quarters. \"There's something here that never happens,\" were the words that rose in my mind, \"and that's why none of us can speak of it.\"  And as I looked out of the window and watched the vulgar blackbirds, with toes turned in, boring out their worms, I realized sharply that even they, as indeed everything large and small in the house and grounds, shared this strangeness, and were twisted out of normal appearance because of it. Life, as expressed in the entire place, was crumpled, dwarfed, emasculated. God's meanings here were crippled, His love of joy was stunted. Nothing in the garden danced or sang.  There was hate in it. \"The Shadow,\" my thought hurried on to completion, \"is a manifestation of hate; and hate is the Devil.\" And then I sat back frightened in my chair, for I knew that I had partly found the truth.  Leaving my books I went out into the open. The sky was overcast, yet the day by no means gloomy, for a soft, diffused light oozed through the clouds and turned all things warm and almost summery. But I saw the grounds now in their nakedness because I understood. Hate means strife, and the two together weave the robe that terror wears. Having no so-called religious beliefs myself, nor belonging to any set of dogmas called a creed, I could stand outside these feelings and observe. Yet they soaked into me sufficiently for me to grasp sympathetically what others, with more cabined souls (I flattered myself), might feel. That picture in the dining room stalked everywhere, hid behind every tree, peered down upon me from the peaked ugliness of the bourgeois towers, and left the impress of its powerful hand upon every bed of flowers. \"You must not do this, you must not do that,\" went past me through the air. \"You must not leave these narrow paths,\" said the rigid iron railings of black. \"You shall not walk here,\" was written on the lawns. \"Keep to the steps,\" \"Don't pick the flowers; make no noise of laughter, singing, dancing,\" was placarded all over the rose-garden, and \"Trespassers will be--not prosecuted but--destroyed\" hung from the crest of monkey tree and holly. Guarding the ends of each artificial terrace stood gaunt, implacable policemen, warders, jailers. \"Come with us,\" they chanted, \"or be damned eternally.\"  I remember feeling quite pleased with myself that I had discovered this obvious explanation of the prison feeling the place breathed out. That the posthumous influence of heavy old Samuel Franklyn might be an inadequate solution did not occur to me. By \"getting the place straight again,\" his widow, of course, meant forgetting the glamour of fear and foreboding his depressing creed had temporarily forced upon her; and Frances, delicately minded being, did not speak of it because it was the influence of the man her friend had loved. I felt lighter; a load was lifted from me. \"To trace the unfamiliar to the familiar,\" came back a sentence I had read somewhere, \"is to understand.\" It was a real relief. I could talk with Frances now, even with my hostess, no danger of treading clumsily. For the key was in my hands. I might even help to dissipate the Shadow, \"to get it straight again.\" It seemed, perhaps, our long invitation was explained!  I went into the house laughing--at myself a little. \"Perhaps after all the artist's outlook, with no hard and fast dogmas, is as narrow as the others! How small humanity is! And why is there no possible and true combination of all outlooks?\"  The feeling of \"unsettling\" was very strong in me just then, in spite of my big discovery which was to clear everything up. And at the moment I ran into Frances on the stairs, with a portfolio of sketches under her arm.  It came across me then abruptly that, although she had worked a great deal since we came, she had shown me nothing. It struck me suddenly as odd, unnatural. The way she tried to pass me now confirmed my newborn suspicion that--well, that her results were hardly what they ought to be.  \"Stand and deliver!\" I laughed, stepping in front of her. \"I've seen nothing you've done since you've been here, and as a rule you show me all your things. I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],["title","The Damned (#6)"],["body","they are atrocious and degrading!\" Then my laughter froze.  She made a sly gesture to slip past me, and I almost decided to let her go, for the expression that flashed across her face shocked me. She looked uncomfortable and ashamed; the color came and went a moment in he cheeks, making me think of a child detected in some secret naughtiness. It was almost fear.  \"It's because they're not finished then?\" I said, dropping the tone of banter, \"or because they're too good for me to understand?\" For my criticism of painting, she told me, was crude and ignorant sometimes. \"But you'll let me see them later, won't you?\"  Frances, however, did not take the way of escape I offered. She changed her mind. She drew the portfolio from beneath her arm instead. \"You can see them if you really want to, Bill,\" she said quietly, and her tone reminded me of a nurse who says to a boy just grown out of childhood, \"you are old enough now to look upon horror and ugliness--only I don't advise it.\"  \"I do want to,\" I said, and made to go downstairs with her. But, instead, she said in the same low voice as before, \"Come up to my room, we shall be undisturbed there.\" So I guessed that she had been on her way to show the paintings to our hostess, but did not care for us all three to see them together. My mind worked furiously.  \"Mabel asked me to do them,\" she explained in a tone of submissive horror, once the door was shut, \"in fact, she begged it of me. You know how persistent she is in her quiet way. I--er--had to.\"  She flushed and opened the portfolio on the little table by the window, standing behind me as I turned the sketches over--sketches of the grounds and trees and garden. In the first moment of inspection, however, I did not take in clearly why my sister's sense of modesty had been offended. For my attention flashed a second elsewhere. Another bit of the puzzle had dropped into place, defining still further the nature of what I called \"the Shadow.\" Mrs. Franklyn, I now remembered, had suggested to me in the library that I might perhaps write something about the place, and I had taken it for one of her banal sentences and paid no further attention. I realized now that it was said in earnest. She wanted our interpretations, as expressed in our respective \"talents,\" painting and writing. Her invitation was explained. She left us to ourselves on purpose.  \"I should like to tear them up,\" Frances was whispering behind me with a shudder, \"only I promised--\" She hesitated a moment.  \"Promised not to?\" I asked with a queer feeling of distress, my eyes glued to the papers.  \"Promised always to show them to her first,\" she finished so low I barely caught it.  I have no intuitive, immediate grasp of the value of paintings; results come to me slowly, and though every one believes his own judgment to be good, I dare not claim that mine is worth more than that of any other layman, Frances had too often convicted me of gross ignorance and error. I can only say that I examined these sketches with a feeling of amazement that contained revulsion, if not actually horror and disgust. They were outrageous. I felt hot for my sister, and it was a relief to know she had moved across the room on some pretence or other, and did not examine them with me. Her talent, of course, is mediocre, yet she has her moments of inspiration--moments, that is to say, when a view of Beauty not normally her own flames divinely through her. And these interpretations struck me forcibly as being thus \"inspired\"--not her own. They were uncommonly well done; they were also atrocious. The meaning in them, however, was never more than hinted. There the unholy skill and power came in: they suggested so abominably, leaving most to the imagination. To find such significance in a bourgeois villa garden, and to interpret it with such delicate yet legible certainty, was a kind of symbolism that was sinister, even diabolical. The delicacy was her own, but the point of view was another's.  And the word that rose in my mind was not the gross description of \"impure,\" but the more fundamental qualification--\"un-pure.\"  In silence I turned the sketches over one by one, as a boy hurries through the pages of an evil book lest he be caught.  \"What does Mabel do with them?\" I asked presently in a low tone, as I neared the end. \"Does she keep them?\"  \"She makes notes about them in a book and then destroys them,\" was the reply from the end of the room. I heard a sigh of relief. \"I'm glad you've seen them, Bill. I wanted you to--but was afraid to show them. You understand?\"  \"I understand,\" was my reply, though it was not a question intended to be answered. All I understood really was that Mabel's mind was as sweet and pure as my sister's, and that she had some good reason for what she did. She destroyed the sketches, but first made notes! It was an interpretation of the place she sought. Brother-like, I felt resentment, though, that Frances should waste her time and talent, when she might be doing work that she could sell. Naturally, I felt other things as well....  \"Mabel pays me five guineas for each one,\" I heard. \"Absolutely insists.\"  I stared at her stupidly a moment, bereft of speech or wit. \"I must either accept, or go away,\" she went on calmly, but a little white. \"I've tried everything. There was a scene the third day I was here--when I showed her my first result. I wanted to write to you, but hesitated--\"  \"It's unintentional, then, on your part--forgive my asking it, Frances, dear?\" I blundered, hardly knowing what to think or say. \"Between the lines\" of her letter came back to me. \"I mean, you make the sketches in your ordinary way and--the result comes out of itself, so to speak?\"  She nodded, throwing her hands out like a Frenchman. \"We needn't keep the money for ourselves, Bill. We can give it away, but--I must either accept or leave,\" and she repeated the shrugging gesture. She sat down on the chair facing me, staring helplessly at the carpet.  \"You say there was a scene?\" I went on presently, \"She insisted?\"  \"She begged me to continue,\" my sister replied very quietly. \"She thinks--that is, she has an idea or theory that there's something about the place--something she can't get at quite.\" Frances stammered badly. She knew I did not encourage her wild theories.  \"Something she feels--yes,\" I helped her, more than curious.  \"Oh, you know what I mean, Bill,\" she said desperately. \"That the place is saturated with some influence that she is herself too positive or too stupid to interpret. She's trying to make herself negative and receptive, as she calls it, but can't, of course, succeed. Haven't you noticed how dull and impersonal and insipid she seems, as though she had no personality? She thinks impressions will come to her that way. But they don't--\"  \"Naturally.\"  \"So she's trying me--us--what she calls the sensitive and impressionable artistic temperament. She says that until she is sure exactly what this influence is, she can't fight it, turn it out, 'get the house straight', as she phrases it.\"  Remembering my own singular impressions, I felt more lenient than I might otherwise have done. I tried to keep impatience out of my voice.  \"And this influence, what--whose is it?\"  We used the pronoun that followed in the same breath, for I answered my own question at the same moment as she did:  \"His.\" Our heads nodded involuntarily towards the floor, the dining room being directly underneath.  And my heart sank, my curiosity died away on the instant; I felt bored. A commonplace haunted house was the last thing in the world to amuse or interest me. The mere thought exasperated, with its suggestions of imagination, overwrought nerves, hysteria, and the rest.  Mingled with my other feelings was certainly disappointment. To see a figure or feel a \"presence,\" and report from day to day strange incidents to each other would be a form of weariness I could never tolerate.  \"But really, Frances,\" I said firmly, after a moment's pause, \"it's too far-fetched, this explanation. A curse, you know, belongs to the ghost stories of early Victorian days.\" And only my positive conviction that there was something after all worth discovering, and that it most certainly was not this, prevented my suggesting that we terminate our visit forthwith, or as soon as we decently could. \"This is not a haunted house, whatever it is,\" I concluded somewhat vehemently, bringing my hand down upon her odious portfolio.  My sister's reply revived my curiosity sharply.  \"I was waiting for you to say that. Mabel says exactly the same. He is in it--but it's something more than that alone, something far bigger and more complicated.\" Her sentence seemed to indicate the sketches, and though I caught the inference I did not take it up, having no desire to discuss them with her just them indeed, if ever.  I merely stared at her and listened. Questions, I felt sure, would be of little use. It was better she should say her thought in her own way.  \"He is one influence, the most recent,\" she went on slowly, and always very calmly, \"but there are others--deeper layers, as it were-- underneath. If his were the only one, something would happen. But nothing ever does happen. The others hinder and prevent--as though each were struggling to predominate.\"  I had felt it already myself. The idea was rather horrible. I shivered.  \"That's what is so ugly about it--that nothing ever happens,\" she said. \"There is this endless anticipation--always on the dry edge of a result that never materializes. It is torture. Mabel is at her wits' end, you see. And when she begged me--what I felt about my sketches--I mean--\"  She stammered badly as before.  I stopped her. I had judged too hastily. That queer symbolism in her paintings, pagan and yet not innocent, was, I understood, the result of mixture. I did not pretend to understand, but at least I could be patient. I consequently held my peace. We did talk on a little longer, but it"]]]
