I would I were thy bird.    Jul. Sweet, so would I.     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.     Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.                                                          [Exit.]    Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,     His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.  Exit     Scene III. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.     Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,     Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.     Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.     What is her burying gave, that is her womb;     And from her womb children of divers kind     We sucking on her natural bosom find;     Many for many virtues excellent,     None but for some, and yet all different.     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies     In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;     For naught so vile that on the earth doth live     But to the earth some special good doth give;     Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,     And vice sometime's by action dignified.     Within the infant rind of this small flower     Poison hath residence, and medicine power;     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.     Two such opposed kings encamp them still     In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;     And where the worser is predominant,     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.                          Enter Romeo.     Rom. Good morrow, father.    Friar. Benedicite!     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?     Young son, it argues a distempered head     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,     And where care lodges sleep will never lie;     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure     Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;     Or if not so, then here I hit it right-     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.    Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.    Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?    Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.    Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?    Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.     I have been feasting with mine enemy,     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me     That's by me wounded. Both our remedies     Within thy help and holy physic lies.     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,     My intercession likewise steads my foe.    Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.    Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,     And all combin'd, save what thou must combine     By holy marriage. When, and where, and how     We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,     That thou consent to marry us to-day.    Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!     Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,     So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.     Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!     How much salt water thrown away in waste,     To season love, that of it doth not taste!     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,     Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.     If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.     And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:     Women may fall when there's no strength in men.    Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.    Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.    Rom. And bad'st me bury love.    Friar. Not in a grave     To lay one in, another out to have.    Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.     The other did not so.    Friar. O, she knew well     Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.     But come, young waverer, come go with me.     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;     For this alliance may so happy prove     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.    Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.    Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene IV. A street.  Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.     Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?     Came he not home to-night?    Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.    Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,     Torments him so that he will sure run mad.    Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.    Mer. A challenge, on my life.    Ben. Romeo will answer it.    Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.    Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,     being dared.    Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white     wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the     very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's     butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?    Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?    Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the     courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing     pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his     minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very     butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman     of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the     immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.    Ben. The what?    Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-     these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very     tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,     grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange     flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand     so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old     bench? O, their bones, their bones!                                 Enter Romeo.     Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!    Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how     art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch     flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she     had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,     but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French     salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit     fairly last night.    Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?    Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?    Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a     case as mine a man may strain courtesy.    Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a     man to bow in the hams.    Rom. Meaning, to cursy.    Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.    Rom. A most courteous exposition.    Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.    Rom. Pink for flower.    Mer. Right.    Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.    Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out     thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may     remain, after the wearing, solely singular.    Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!    Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.    Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.    Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for     thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am     sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?    Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not     there for the goose.    Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.    Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!    Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.    Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?    Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch     narrow to an ell broad!    Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to     the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.    Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now     art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by     art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a     great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in     a hole.    Ben. Stop there, stop there!    Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.    Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.    Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I     was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to     occupy the argument no longer.    Rom. Here's goodly gear!                        Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].     Mer. A sail, a sail!    Ben."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],["title","The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#6)"],["body","o, two! a shirt and a smock.    Nurse. Peter!    Peter. Anon.    Nurse.

Is it good-den?    Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is     now upon the prick of noon.    Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!    Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.    Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'     quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the     young Romeo?    Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you     have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest     of that name, for fault of a worse.    Nurse. You say well.    Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,     wisely.    Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.    Ben. She will endite him to some supper.    Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!    Rom. What hast thou found?    Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is     something stale and hoar ere it be spent                                      He walks by them and sings.                     An old hare hoar,                    And an old hare hoar,                 Is very good meat in Lent;                    But a hare that is hoar                    Is too much for a score                 When it hoars ere it be spent.      Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.    Rom. I will follow you.    Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,     [sings] lady, lady, lady.                                       Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.    Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant     was this that was so full of his ropery?    Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and     will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.    Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an 'a     were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,     I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his     flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must     stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!    Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my     weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as     soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the     law on my side.    Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me     quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,     my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I     will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead     her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of     behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and     therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were     an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.    Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto     thee-    Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,     Lord! she will be a joyful woman.    Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.    Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I     take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.    Rom. Bid her devise     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell     Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.    Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.    Rom. Go to! I say you shall.    Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.    Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.     Within this hour my man shall be with thee     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,     Which to the high topgallant of my joy     Must be my convoy in the secret night.     Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.     Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.    Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.    Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?    Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?    Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.    Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!     when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in     town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,     good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I     anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;     but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any     clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both     with a letter?    Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.    Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I     know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest     sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you     good to hear it.    Rom. Commend me to thy lady.    Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!    Peter. Anon.    Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene V. Capulet's orchard.  Enter Juliet.     Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;     In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.     Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.     O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams     Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve     Is three long hours; yet she is not come.     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,     And his to me,     But old folks, many feign as they were dead-     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.                        Enter Nurse [and Peter].      O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.    Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.                                                    [Exit Peter.]    Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news     By playing it to me with so sour a face.    Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.     Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!    Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.     Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.    Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?     Do you not see that I am out of breath?    Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath     To say to me that thou art out of breath?     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.     Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?    Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to     choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better     than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a     foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet     they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll     warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God.     What, have you din'd at home?    Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.     What says he of our marriage? What of that?    Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.     My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!     Beshrew your heart for sending me about     To catch my death with jauncing up and down!    Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.     Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?    Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,     and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where     is your mother?    Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,     \"Where is your mother?\"'    Nurse. O God's Lady dear!     Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?     Henceforward do your messages yourself.    Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?    Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?    Jul. I have.    Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;     There stays a husband to make you a wife.     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.     Hie you to church; I must another way,     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.     I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;     But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.     Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.    Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene VI. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.     Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act     That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!    Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy     That one short minute gives me in her sight.     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,     Then love-devouring death do what he dare-     It is enough I may but call her mine.    Friar. These violent delights have violent ends     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,     Which, as they kiss, consume.
