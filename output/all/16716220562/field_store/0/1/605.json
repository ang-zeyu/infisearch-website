Cotton is made from the hairs of the seed of the cotton plant.[1] Linen is made of the inner fibre of the bark of the flax plant. It has been cultivated from the earliest historical times.  [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. II. The Cotton Plant.]   3. _Purification of the Air_.--The following questions and experiments are intended to show the pupils, first, that we live in an atmosphere, the presence of which is necessary to support life and combustion (1) and (2); secondly, that this atmosphere is deprived of its power to support life and combustion by the actions of combustion (2), and of respiration (3); thirdly, that this power is restored to the air by the action of plants (4).  We have the air about us everywhere. A so-called empty vessel is one where the contents are invisible. The following experiment is a good illustration of this.  (1) Wrap the throat of a glass funnel with moistened cloth or paper so that it will fit tightly into the neck of a bottle, and fill the funnel with water. If the space between the funnel and the bottle is air-tight, the water will not flow into the bottle.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  Do not explain this in advance to the pupils. Ask them what prevents the water from flowing into the bottle. If they are puzzled, loosen the funnel, and show them that the water will now flow in. In the first case, as the air could not escape, the water could not flow in; in the second, the air was displaced by the heavier water.  Ask the pupils why the air in a crowded room becomes so difficult to breathe. Could a person live if he were shut up in an air-tight room for a long time? Fresh air is necessary to life. The teacher may explain that it is the oxygen in the air that supports life. Air is composed one-fifth of this gas and four-fifths of nitrogen. The gases are mixed and the nitrogen simply dilutes the oxygen, as it were.  Fresh air is necessary to support combustion as well as life. Ask them why we put out a fire by throwing a blanket or a rug over it. The following experiment illustrates this.  (2) Take a small, wide-mouthed bottle, covered with a card or cork. To this cover fasten a piece of bent wire with a taper on the end. Light the taper and lower it into the jar. It will burn a few seconds and then go out. Raise and light it again, and it will be extinguished as soon as it is plunged into the bottle. This shows that the oxygen of the air is used up by burning substances, as it is by breathing animals.  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]  The following experiment shows that fire will not burn in an atmosphere of gas from our lungs.  (3) Fill a bottle with gas by breathing into it through a bit of glass tubing, passed through a card or cork, and reaching to the bottom of the bottle. The bottle will be dimmed with moisture, showing the presence of aqueous vapor. A lighted match plunged into the bottle will be immediately extinguished. A better way, which, however, takes some skill in manipulation, is to fill the bottle with water, cover it with a flat piece of glass, and invert the bottle in a dish of water, taking care that no air bubbles enter. Then, through a bit of glass tubing, blow into the bottle till the water is expelled. Cover the mouth with the glass under water, and holding it tightly down, invert the bottle quickly. Set it down, light a match, take away the glass, and at the same instant plunge in the match. If no air has been allowed to enter, the match will go out at once. No animal could live in an atmosphere which could not support combustion.  From these experiments the pupils have seen that the life-sustaining quality of the air is used up by combustion and respiration. To bring in the subject of purification by plants, ask them why all the oxygen in the world is not exhausted by the people and the fires in it. After the subject has been explained, the following experiment can be prepared and put aside till the next lesson.  (4) Fill two bottles with air from the lungs, as in (3) having previously introduced a cutting from a plant into one of the bottles. Allow them to stand in the sun for a day or two. Then test both bottles with a burning match. If properly done, the result will be very striking. The end of the cutting should be in the water of the dish. This experiment will not succeed excepting with bottles such as are used for chemicals, which have their mouths carefully ground. Common bottles allow the air to enter between the bottle and the glass.[1]  [Footnote 1: See note on page 13.]  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]   4. _Fuel_.--Light a match and allow it to burn until half charred. Blow it out gently, so as to leave a glowing spark. When this spark goes out it will leave behind a light, gray ash. We have to consider the flame, the charred substance, and the ash.  Flame is burning gas. In all ordinary fuels, carbon and hydrogen, in various combinations and free, make the principal part. The first effect of the heat is to set free the volatile compounds of carbon and hydrogen. The hydrogen then begins to unite with the oxygen of the air, forming water, setting free the carbon, which also unites with oxygen, forming carbonic acid gas. The burning gases cause the flame. The following experiment will illustrate this.  [Illustration: Fig. 4.]  (5) Fit a test-tube with a tight cork, through which a bit of glass tubing, drawn out into a jet, is passed, the tubing within being even with the cork. Place some bits of shaving in the tube, cork it, and make the cork perfectly air-tight by coating it with bees wax or paraffine. Heat the test-tube gently over an alcohol lamp. The wood turns black, and vapor issues from the jet, which may be lighted (Fig. 4). Care should be taken to expel all the air before lighting.  (6) That the burning hydrogen forms water by uniting with the oxygen of the air, may be shown by holding a cold glass tumbler over the jet, or over any flame. The glass will be dimmed by drops of moisture.  The charred part of the wood is charcoal, which is one form of carbon. Our ordinary charcoal is made by driving off all the gases from wood, by burning it under cover where only a little air can reach it. The volatile gases burn more readily than the carbon, and are the first substances to be driven off, so that the carbon is left behind nearly pure. In the same way we have driven off all the gases from the half-burned match and left the carbon. The teacher should have a piece of charcoal to show the pupils. It still retains all the markings of the wood.  If the combustion is continued, the carbon also unites with the oxygen of the air, till it is all converted into carbonic acid gas. This was the case with the match where we left the glowing spark. The gray ash that was left behind is the mineral matter contained in the wood.  (7) We can show that this gas is formed by pouring lime water into a bottle in which a candle has been burned as in (2). The water becomes milky from a fine white powder formed by the union of the carbonic acid gas with the lime, forming carbonate of lime. This is a chemical test.  The wood of the match is plainly of vegetable origin; so also is the charcoal, which is nearly pure carbon. Coal is also carbon, the remains of ancient forests, from which the gases have been slowly driven off by heat and pressure. All the common fuels are composed principally of carbon and hydrogen. When these elements unite with oxygen, carbonic acid gas and water are formed.[1]  [Footnote 1: [Transcriber's Note: This note is missing from original text.]]  (8) The same products are formed by respiration. We breathe out carbonic acid gas and water from our lungs. Breathe on a cold glass. It is bedewed exactly as it is by the candle flame. Breathe through a bit of glass tubing into a bottle of lime water. It becomes milky, showing the presence of carbonic acid gas. Why is this?  Every act or thought is accompanied by a consumption of material in the body, which thus becomes unfit for further use. These waste substances, composed chiefly of carbon and hydrogen, unite with oxygen breathed in from the air, forming carbonic acid gas and water, which are breathed out of the system. The action is a process of slow combustion, and it is principally by the heat thus evolved that the body is kept warm. As we are thus constantly taking oxygen from the air, a close room becomes unfit to live in and a supply of fresh air is indispensable. The cycle of changes is completed by the action of plants, which take in carbonic acid gas, use the carbon, and return most of the oxygen to the atmosphere.

III, 279-288.     II.  SEEDLINGS.   1. _Directions for raising in the Schoolroom_.--The seeds should be planted in boxes tilled with clean sand. Plates or shallow crockery pans are also used, but the sand is apt to become caked, and the pupils are likely to keep the seeds too wet if they are planted in vessels that will not drain. The boxes should be covered with panes of glass till the seedlings are well started, and should be kept at a temperature of from 65° to 70° Fahr. It is very important to keep them covered while the seeds are germinating, otherwise the sand will be certain to become too dry if kept in a sufficiently warm place. Light is not necessary, and in winter "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],["title","Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#2)"],["body","the neighborhood of the furnace is often a very convenient place to keep them safe from frost. They should not be in the sun while germinating. When the first sprouts appear above the ground let another set be planted, and so on, till a series is obtained ranging from plants several inches high to those just starting from the seed. The seeds themselves should be soaked for a day and the series is then ready for study. The time required for their growth varies according to the temperature, moisture, etc. Dr. Goodale says they should be ready in ten days.[1]  [Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, by G.L. Goodale, Boston, D.C. Heath & Co. This little book, which is published, in pamphlet form, for fifteen cents, will be found exceedingly useful.]  I have never been able to raise them so quickly in the schoolroom, nor have the pupils to whom I have given them to plant done so at home. Generally, it is three weeks, at least, before the first specimens are as large as is desirable.  Germinating seeds need warmth, moisture and air. The necessary conditions are supplied in the very best way by growing them on sponge, but it would be difficult to raise enough for a large class in this manner. Place a piece of moist sponge in a jelly-glass, or any glass that is larger at the top, so that the sponge may not sink to the bottom, and pour some water into the glass, but not so much as to touch the sponge. The whole should be covered with a larger inverted glass, which must not be so close as to prevent a circulation of air. The plants can thus be watched at every stage and some should always be grown in this way. The water in the tumbler will keep the sponge damp, and the roots, after emerging from the sponge, will grow well in the moist air. Seeds can also be grown on blotting paper. Put the seeds on several thicknesses of moist blotting paper on a plate, cover them with more moist paper, and invert another plate over them, taking care to allow the free entrance of air.  If possible, it is by far the best way to have the seeds growing in the schoolroom, and make it a regular custom for the pupils to observe them every morning and take notes of their growth.  These lessons on seeds are suitable for pupils of every age, from adults to the youngest children who go to school. The difference should be only in the mode of treatment; but the same principles should be brought out, whatever the age and power of comprehension of the pupil.  For these lessons the following seeds should be planted, according to the above directions:  Morning-Glory, Sunflower or Squash, Bean, Pea, Red Clover, Flax, Corn, Wheat, and Oats.[1] If they can be procured plant also acorns, Pine-seeds, Maple-seeds, and horsechestnuts.  [Footnote 1: A package of these seeds may be obtained for fifty cents, from Joseph Breck & Son, Boston, Mass. They will be sent by mail, postage paid.]   2. _Study of Morning-Glory, Sunflower, Bean, and Pea_.--For reasons hereafter given, I consider the Morning-Glory the best seedling to begin upon. Having a series, as above described, before them, the pupils should draw the seedlings. When the drawings are made, let them letter alike the corresponding parts, beginning with the plantlet in the seed, and using new letters when a new part is developed. The seed coats need not be lettered, as they do not belong to the plantlet.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Germination of Morning Glory, _a_, caulicle; _b_, cotyledons; _c_, plumule; _d_, roots.]  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Germination of Sunflower.]  After drawing the Morning-Glory series, let them draw the Sunflower or Squash in the same way, then the Bean, and finally the Pea. Let them write answers to the following questions:  MORNING-GLORY.[1]  [Footnote 1: It has been objected that the Morning-Glory seed is too small to begin upon. If the teacher prefer, he may begin with the Squash, Bean, and Pea. The questions will require but little alteration, and he can take up the Morning-Glory later.]  Tell the parts of the Morning-Glory seed.  What part grows first?  What becomes of the seed-covering?  What appears between the first pair of leaves?  Was this to be seen in the seed?  How many leaves are there at each joint of stem after the first pair?  How do they differ from the first pair?  SUNFLOWER OR SQUASH.  What are the parts of the seed?  What is there in the Morning-Glory seed that this has not?  How do the first leaves change as the seedling grows?   BEAN.  What are the parts of the seed?  How does this differ from the Morning-Glory seed?  How from the Sunflower seed?  How do the first pair of leaves of the Bean change as they grow?  How many leaves are there at each joint of stem?[1]  [Footnote 1: There are two simple leaves at the next node to the cotyledons; after these there is one compound leaf at each node.]  How do they differ from the first pair?   PEA.  What are the parts of the seed? Compare it with the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, and Bean.  How does it differ in its growth from the Bean?  What have all these four seeds in common?  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Germination of Pea. _a_, caulicle; _b_, cotyledons; _c_, plumule; _d_, roots.]  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Germination of Bean.]  What has the Morning-Glory seed that the others have not?  What have the Bean and Pea that the Morning-Glory has not?  How does the Pea differ from all the others in its growth?  What part grows first in all these seeds?  From which part do the roots grow?  What peculiarity do you notice in the way they come up out of the ground?[1]  [Footnote 1: This question refers to the arched form in which they come up. In this way the tender, growing apex is not rubbed.]  The teacher must remember that, unless the pupils have had some previous training, they will first have to learn to use their eyes, and for this they will need much judicious help. They should be assisted to see what is before them, not told what is there. It is absolutely necessary that these questions should be thoroughly understood and correctly answered before any conclusions are drawn from them. For this purpose abundant material is indispensable. It is better not to attempt these lessons on seeds at all, unless there is material enough for personal observation by all the pupils.  After this preliminary work has been done, the names of the parts can be given to the pupils. They may be written under each drawing thus,--A=Caulicle;[1] B=Cotyledons; C=Roots; D=Plumule. The whole plantlet in the seed is the _embryo_ or _germ_, whence the sprouting of seeds is called _germination_.  [Footnote 1: The term radicle is still in general use. The derivation (little root) makes it undesirable. Dr. Gray has adopted caulicle (little stem) in the latest edition of his text-book, which I have followed. Other writers use the term hypocotyl, meaning under the cotyledons.]  I consider this the best order to study the seeds because in the Morning-Glory the cotyledons are plainly leaves in the seed; and in the Squash or Sunflower[2] the whole process is plainly to be seen whereby a thick body, most unlike a leaf, becomes an ordinary green leaf with veins.[3] In the Sunflower the true leaves are nearly the same shape as the cotyledons, so that this is an especially good illustration for the purpose. Thus, without any hint from me, my pupils often write of the Bean, \"it has two thick leaves and two thin leaves.\" In this way the Bean and Pea present no difficulty. The cotyledons in the first make apparently an unsuccessful effort to become leaves, which the second give up altogether.  [Footnote 2: The large Russian Sunflower is the best for the purpose.]  [Footnote 3: These lessons are intended, as has been said, for children over twelve years of age. If they are adapted for younger ones, it is especially important to begin with a seed where the leaf-like character of the cotyledons is evident, or becomes so. Maple is excellent for the purpose. Morning-Glory is too small. Squash will answer very well. I think it characteristic of the minds of little children to associate a term with the first specimen to which it is applied. If the term cotyledon be given them first for those of the Bean and Pea they will say when they come to the Morning-Glory, \"but those are _leaves_, not cotyledons. Cotyledons are large and round.\" It will be very difficult to make them understand that cotyledons are the first seed-leaves, and they will feel as if it were a forced connection, and one that they cannot see for themselves.]  The teacher's object now is to make the pupils understand the meaning of the answers they have given to these questions. In the first place, they should go over their answers and substitute the botanical terms they have just learned for the ones they have used.   COMPARISON OF THE PARTS OF THE SOAKED SEEDS.  _Morning-Glory_. A seed covering. Some albumen. Two cotyledons. A caulicle.  _Sunflower_. An outer covering.[1] An inner covering. Two cotyledons. A caulicle.[2]  [Footnote 1: The so-called seed of Sunflower is really a fruit. The outer covering is the wall of the ovary, the inner the seed-coat. Such closed, one-seeded fruits are called akenes.]  [Footnote 2: The plumule is sometimes visible in the embryo of the Sunflower.]  _Bean_. A seed covering. Two cotyledons. A caulicle. A plumule.  _Pea_. The same as the Bean.  They have also learned how the first leaves in the last three differ from those of the Morning-Glory, being considerably thicker in the Sunflower, and very much thicker in the Bean and Pea. Why should the Morning-Glory have this jelly that the others have not? Why do the first leaves of the Sunflower change so much as the seedling grows? What becomes of their substance? Why do those of the Bean shrivel and finally drop off? By this time some bright pupil will have discovered that the baby-plant needs food and that this is stored around it in the Morning-Glory, and in the leaves themselves in the others. It is nourished upon this "]]]
