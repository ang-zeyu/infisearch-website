In some of these, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, consisting of a great number of leaves or duplicatures, is found within the air-bag, which probably secretes this air from the blood of the animal. (Monro. Physiol. of Fish. p. 28.) To determine whether this air, when first separated from the blood of the animal or plant, be dephlogisticated air, is worthy inquiry. The bladder-sena (Colutea), and bladder-nut (Staphyl√¶a), have their seed-vessels distended with air; the Ketmia has the upper joint of the stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower much distended with air; these seem to be analogous to the air-vessel at the broad end of the egg, and may probably become less pure as the seed ripens: some, which I tried, had the purity of the surrounding atmosphere. The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serving the purpose of respiration to the young chick, some of whose vessels are spread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it. Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human fetus, and cotyledons of quadrupeds, are respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones.  The air in the hollow stems of grasses, and of some umbelliferous plants, bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in some of the bones of birds; supplying the place of the pith, which shrivels up after it has performed its office of protruding the young stem or feather. Some of these cavities of the bones are said to communicate with the lungs in birds. Phil. Trans.  The air-bladders of fish are nicely adapted to their intended purpose; for though they render them buoyant near the surface without the labour of using their fins, yet, when they rest at greater depths, they are no inconvenience, as the increased pressure of the water condenses the air which they contain into less space. Thus, if a cork or bladder of air was immersed a very great depth in the ocean, it would be so much compressed, as to become specifically as heavy as the water, and would remain there. It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-ship of his own construction, miscarried from not attending to this circumstance: it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him, if he descended much lower than he expected, was condensed into so small a space as not to render the ship buoyant when he endeavoured to ascend.]           Her _secret_ vows the Cyprian Queen approves, 410  And hovering halcyons guard her infant-loves;         Each in his floating cradle round they throng,         And dimpling Ocean bears the fleet along.--         Thus o'er the waves, which gently bend and swell,         Fair GALATEA steers her silver shell;  415  Her playful Dolphins stretch the silken rein,         Hear her sweet voice, and glide along the main.         As round the wild meandering coast she moves         By gushing rills, rude cliffs, and nodding groves;         Each by her pine the Wood-nymphs wave their locks, 420  And wondering Naiads peep amid the rocks;         Pleased trains of Mermaids rise from coral cells,         Admiring Tritons sound their twisted shells;         Charm'd o'er the car pursuing Cupids sweep,         Their snow-white pinions twinkling in the deep; 425  And, as the lustre of her eye she turns,         Soft sighs the Gale, and amorous Ocean burns.          On DOVE'S green brink the fair TREMELLA stood,         And view'd her playful image in the flood;   [_Tremella_, l. 427. Clandestine marriage. I have frequently observed fungusses of this Genus on old rails and on the ground to become a transparent jelly, after they had been frozen in autumnal mornings; which is a curious property, and distinguishes them from some other vegetable mucilage; for I have observed that the paste, made by boiling wheat-flour in water, ceases to be adhesive after having been frozen. I suspected that the Tremella Nostoc, or star-jelly, also had been thus produced; but have since been well informed, that the Tremella Nostoc is a mucilage voided by Herons after they have eaten frogs; hence it has the appearance of having been pressed through a hole; and limbs of frogs are said sometimes to be found amongst it; it is always seen upon plains or by the sides of water, places which Herons generally frequent.  Some of the Fungusses are so acrid, that a drop of their juice blisters the tongue; others intoxicate those who eat them. The Ostiacks in Siberia use them for the latter purpose; one Fungus of the species, Agaricus muscarum, eaten raw; or the decoction of three of them, produces intoxication for 12 or 16 hours. History of Russia. V. 1. Nichols. 1780. As all acrid plants become less so, if exposed to a boiling heat, it is probable the common mushroom may sometimes disagree from being not sufficiently stewed. The Oftiacks blister their skin by a fungus found on Birch-trees; and use the Agiricus officin. for Soap. ib.  There was a dispute whether the fungusses should be classed in the animal or vegetable department. Their animal taste in cookery, and their animal smell when burnt, together with their tendency to putrefaction, insomuch that the Phallus impudicus has gained the name of stink-horn; and lastly, their growing and continuing healthy without light, as the Licoperdon tuber or truffle, and the fungus vinosus or mucor in dark cellars, and the esculent mushrooms on beds covered thick with straw, would seem to shew that they approach towards the animals, or make a kind of isthmus connecting the two mighty kingdoms of animal and of vegetable nature.]           To each rude rock, lone dell, and echoing grove 430  Sung the sweet sorrows of her _secret_ love.         \"Oh, stay!--return!\"--along the sounding shore         Cry'd the sad Naiads,--she return'd no more!--         Now girt with clouds the sullen Evening frown'd,         And withering Eurus swept along the ground; 435  The misty moon withdrew her horned light,         And sunk with Hesper in the skirt of night;          No dim electric streams, (the northern dawn,)         With meek effulgence quiver'd o'er the lawn;         No star benignant shot one transient ray 440  To guide or light the wanderer on her way.         Round the dark craggs the murmuring whirlwinds blow,         Woods groan above, and waters roar below;         As o'er the steeps with pausing foot she moves,         The pitying Dryads shriek amid their groves; 445  She flies,--she stops,--she pants--she looks behind,         And hears a demon howl in every wind.         --As the bleak blast unfurls her fluttering vest,         Cold beats the snow upon her shuddering breast;         Through her numb'd limbs the chill sensations dart, 450  And the keen ice bolt trembles at her heart.         \"I sink, I fall! oh, help me, help!\" she cries,         Her stiffening tongue the unfinish'd sound denies;         Tear after tear adown her cheek succeeds,         And pearls of ice bestrew the glittering meads; 455  Congealing snows her lingering feet surround,         Arrest her flight, and root her to the ground;         With suppliant arms she pours the silent prayer;         Her suppliant arms hang crystal in the air;         Pellucid films her shivering neck o'erspread, 460  Seal her mute lips, and silver o'er her head,         Veil her pale bosom, glaze her lifted hands,         And shrined in ice the beauteous statue stands.         --DOVE'S azure nymphs on each revolving year         For fair TREMELLA shed the tender tear; 465  With rush-wove crowns in sad procession move,         And sound the sorrowing shell to hapless love.\"          Here paused the MUSE,--across the darken'd pole         Sail the dim clouds, the echoing thunders roll;         The trembling Wood-nymphs, as the tempest lowers, 470  Lead the gay Goddess to their inmost bowers;         Hang the mute lyre the laurel shade beneath,         And round her temples bind the myrtle wreath.         --Now the light swallow with her airy brood         Skims the green meadow, and the dimpled flood; 475  Loud shrieks the lone thrush from his leafless thorn,         Th' alarmed beetle sounds his bugle horn;         Each pendant spider winds with fingers fine         His ravel'd clue, and climbs along the line;         Gay Gnomes in glittering circles stand aloof 480  Beneath a spreading mushroom's fretted roof;         Swift bees returning seek their waxen cells,         And Sylphs cling quivering in the lily's bells.         Through the still air descend the genials showers,         And pearly rain-drops deck the laughing flowers.    INTERLUDE.   _Bookseller_.

But pray tell me, what is the essential difference between Poetry and Prose? is it solely the melody or measure of the language?  _P._ I think not solely; for some prose has its melody, and even measure. And good verses, well spoken in a language unknown to the hearer, are not easily to be distinguished from good prose. _B_. Is it the sublimity, beauty, or novelty of the sentiments?  _P_. Not so; for sublime sentiments are often better expressed in prose. Thus when Warwick in one of the plays of Shakespear, is left wounded on the field after the loss of the battle, and his friend says to him, \"Oh, could you but fly!\" what can be more sublime than his answer, \"Why then, I would not fly.\" No measure of verse, I imagine, could add dignity to this sentiment.

CONCLUSION  APPENDIX     CHAPTER XL.  FIRST MEETING WITH SECRETARY STANTON--GENERAL ROSECRANS--COMMANDING MILITARY DIVISION OF MISSISSIPPI--ANDREW JOHNSON'S ADDRESS--ARRIVAL AT CHATTANOOGA.  The reply (to my telegram of October 16, 1863, from Cairo, announcing my arrival at that point) came on the morning of the 17th, directing me to proceed immediately to the Galt House, Louisville, where I would meet an officer of the War Department with my instructions.  I left Cairo within an hour or two after the receipt of this dispatch, going by rail via Indianapolis. Just as the train I was on was starting out of the depot at Indianapolis a messenger came running up to stop it, saying the Secretary of War was coming into the station and wanted to see me.  I had never met Mr. Stanton up to that time, though we had held frequent conversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee. Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the War Department and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold a conversation for an hour or two.  On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom I had never met, though he and my father had been old acquaintances.  Mr. Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied me to Louisville.  Up to this time no hint had been given me of what was wanted after I left Vicksburg, except the suggestion in one of Halleck's dispatches that I had better go to Nashville and superintend the operation of troops sent to relieve Rosecrans. Soon after we started the Secretary handed me two orders, saying that I might take my choice of them.  The two were identical in all but one particular.  Both created the \"Military Division of Mississippi,\" (giving me the command) composed of the Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee, and all the territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi River north of Banks's command in the south-west.  One order left the department commanders as they were, while the other relieved Rosecrans and assigned Thomas to his place.  I accepted the latter.  We reached Louisville after night and, if I remember rightly, in a cold, drizzling rain.  The Secretary of War told me afterwards that he caught a cold on that occasion from which he never expected to recover.  He never did.  A day was spent in Louisville, the Secretary giving me the military news at the capital and talking about the disappointment at the results of some of the campaigns.  By the evening of the day after our arrival all matters of discussion seemed exhausted, and I left the hotel to spend the evening away, both Mrs. Grant (who was with me) and myself having relatives living in Louisville.  In the course of the evening Mr. Stanton received a dispatch from Mr. C. A. Dana, then in Chattanooga, informing him that unless prevented Rosecrans would retreat, and advising peremptory orders against his doing so.  As stated before, after the fall of Vicksburg I urged strongly upon the government the propriety of a movement against Mobile.  General Rosecrans had been at Murfreesboro', Tennessee, with a large and well-equipped army from early in the year 1863, with Bragg confronting him with a force quite equal to his own at first, considering it was on the defensive.  But after the investment of Vicksburg Bragg's army was largely depleted to strengthen Johnston, in Mississippi, who was being reinforced to raise the siege.  I frequently wrote General Halleck suggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg.  By so doing he would either detain the latter's troops where they were or lay Chattanooga open to capture.  General Halleck strongly approved the suggestion, and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly ordered Rosecrans to advance, but that the latter had constantly failed to comply with the order, and at last, after having held a council of war, had replied in effect that it was a military maxim \"not to fight two decisive battles at the same time.\"  If true, the maxim was not applicable in this case.  It would be bad to be defeated in two decisive battles fought the same day, but it would not be bad to win them.  I, however, was fighting no battle, and the siege of Vicksburg had drawn from Rosecrans' front so many of the enemy that his chances of victory were much greater than they would be if he waited until the siege was over, when these troops could be returned.  Rosecrans was ordered to move against the army that was detaching troops to raise the siege. Finally he did move, on the 24th of June, but ten days afterwards Vicksburg surrendered, and the troops sent from Bragg were free to return.  It was at this time that I recommended to the general-in-chief the movement against Mobile.  I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberland was in, being depleted"]]]
