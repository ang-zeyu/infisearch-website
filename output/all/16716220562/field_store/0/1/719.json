This is a crafty wench, I like her wit well, 'twill be                 rare to stir up a leaden appetite, she's a _Danae_, and                 must be courted in a showr of gold.

Now, as I                 live tis fair gold; you would have silver for it to play                 with the Pages; you could not have taken me in a                 worse time; But if you have present use my Lord,                 I'le send my man with silver and keep your gold                 for you.  _Pha_.

If there be two such more in this Kingdom, and                 near the Court, we may even hang up our Harps: ten such                 _Camphire_ constitutions as this, would call the golden                 age again in question, and teach the old way for every ill                 fac't Husband to get his own Children, and what a                 mischief that will breed, let all consider.                                                    [ _Enter_ Megra.                  Here's another; if she be of the same last, the Devil                 shall pluck her on. Many fair mornings, Lady.   _Meg_.     As many mornings bring as many dayes,                 Fair, sweet, and hopeful to your Grace.  _Pha_.      She gives good words yet; Sure this wench is free.                 If your more serious business do not call you,                 Let me hold quarter with you, we'll take an hour                 Out quickly.  _Meg_.     What would your Grace talk of?  _Pha_.     Of some such pretty subject as your self.                 I'le go no further than your eye, or lip,                 There's theme enough for one man for an age.  _Meg_.     Sir, they stand right, and my lips are yet even,                 Smooth, young enough, ripe enough, red enough,                 Or my glass wrongs me.  _Pha_.      O they are two twin'd Cherries died in blushes,                 Which those fair suns above, with their bright beams                 Reflect upon, and ripen: sweetest beauty,                 Bow down those branches, that the longing taste,                 Of the faint looker on, may meet those blessings,                 And taste and live.  _Meg_.     O delicate sweet Prince;                 She that hath snow enough about her heart,                 To take the wanton spring of ten such lines off,                 May be a Nun without probation.                 Sir, you have in such neat poetry, gathered a kiss,                 That if I had but five lines of that number,                 Such pretty begging blanks, I should commend                 Your fore-head, or your cheeks, and kiss you too.  _Pha_.     Do it in prose; you cannot miss it Madam.  _Meg_.     I shall, I shall.  _Pha_.     By my life you shall not.                 I'le prompt you first: Can you do it now?  _Meg_.     Methinks 'tis easie, now I ha' don't before;                 But yet I should stick at it.  _Pha_.     Stick till to morrow.                 I'le ne'r part you sweetest. But we lose time,                 Can you love me?  _Meg_.     Love you my Lord? How would you have me                 love you?  _Pha_.      I'le teach you in a short sentence, cause I will not                 load your memory, that is all; love me, and lie with                 me.  _Meg_.     Was it lie with you that you said? 'Tis impossible.  _Pha_.      Not to a willing mind, that will endeavour; if I do                 not teach you to do it as easily in one night, as you'l                 go to bed, I'le lose my Royal blood for't.  _Meg_.    Why Prince, you have a Lady of your own, that                 yet wants teaching.  _Pha_.      I'le sooner teach a Mare the old measures, than teach                 her any thing belonging to the function; she's afraid to                 lie with her self, if she have but any masculine                 imaginations about her; I know when we are married,                 I must ravish her.  _Meg_.     By my honour, that's a foul fault indeed, but time                 and your good help will wear it out Sir.  _Pha_.      And for any other I see, excepting your dear self,                 dearest Lady, I had rather be Sir _Tim _the Schoolmaster,                 and leap a Dairy-maid.  _Meg_.     Has your Grace seen the Court-star _Galatea_?  _Pha_.     Out upon her; she's as cold of her favour as an                 apoplex: she sail'd by but now.  _Meg_.     And how do you hold her wit Sir?  _Pha_.      I hold her wit? The strength of all the Guard cannot                 hold it, if they were tied to it, she would blow 'em out of                 the Kingdom, they talk of _Jupiter_, he's but a squib                 cracker to her: Look well about you, and you may find                 a tongue-bolt. But speak sweet Lady, shall I be freely                 welcome?  _Meg_.     Whither?  _Pha_.      To your bed; if you mistrust my faith, you do me                 the unnoblest wrong.  _Meg_.     I dare not Prince, I dare not.  _Pha_.     Make your own conditions, my purse shall seal 'em,                and what you dare imagine you can want, I'le furnish you                withal: give two hours to your thoughts every morning about                it. Come, I know you are bashful, speak in my ear, will you                be mine? keep this, and with it me: soon I will visit you.  _Meg_.    My Lord, my Chamber's most unsafe, but when                'tis night I'le find some means to slip into your                lodging: till when--  _Pha_.     Till when, this, and my heart go with thee.                                                [_Ex. several ways_.     _Enter _Galatea _from behind the hangings_.  _Gal_.

With whom?  _Gal_.      Why, with the Lady I suspect: I can tell the time and place.  _Are_.      O when, and where?  _Gal_.      To night, his Lodging.  _Are_.

I will not be dishonour'd;                 He that enters, enters upon his death;                 Sir, 'tis a sign you make no stranger of me,                 To bring these Renegados to my Chamber,                 At these unseason'd hours.  _King_.    Why do you                 Chafe your self so? you are not wrong'd, nor shall be;                 Onely I'le search your lodging, for some cause                 To our self known: Enter I say.  _Pha_.      I say no.                                                         [_Meg. Above_.  _Meg_.     Let 'em enter Prince,                 Let 'em enter, I am up, and ready; I know their business,                 'Tis the poor breaking of a Ladies honour,                 They hunt so hotly after; let 'em enjoy it.                 You have your business Gentlemen, I lay here.                 O my Lord the King, this is not noble in you                 To make publick the weakness of a Woman.  _King_.    Come down.  _Meg_.     I dare my Lord; your whootings and your clamors,                 Your private whispers, and your broad fleerings,                 Can no more vex my soul, than this base carriage;                 But I have vengeance yet in store for some,                 Shall in the most contempt you can have of me,                 Be joy and nourishment.  _King_.     Will you come down?  _Meg_.      Yes, to laugh at your worst: but I shall wrong you,                 If my skill fail me not.  _King_.    Sir, I must dearly chide you for this looseness,                 You have wrong'd a worthy Lady; but no more,                 Conduct him to my lodging, and to bed.  _Cle_.      Get him another wench, and you bring him to bed in deed.  _Di_.        'Tis strange a man cannot ride a Stagg                 Or two, to breath himself, without a warrant:                 If this geer hold, that lodgings be search'd thus,                 Pray heaven we may lie with our own wives in safety,                 That they be not by some trick of State mistaken.

Thou most ill shrowded rottenness; thou piece                 Made by a Painter and a Pothecary;                 Thou troubled sea of lust; thou wilderness,                 Inhabited by wild thoughts; thou swoln cloud                 Of Infection; them ripe Mine of all Diseases;                 Thou all Sin, all Hell, and last, all Devils, tell me,                 Had you none to pull on with your courtesies,                 But he that must be mine, and wrong my Daughter?
