With such a gun the _Queen Mary_ had been equipped as she was overhauled in dry dock. With this gun went four men. One to stand by the gun at night and keep watch of the sky and a second to do duty in the day time. The other two men stood relief watches and were of additional need should one of the first men be injured, taken sick or killed.  And so it was that, as the _Queen Mary_ continued on her way, one of these men stood by his gun just aft of the bridge, watching the sky. Nor did he shirk his task.  Almost continuously his eye swept the dark heavens, following, as well as he could, in the path of one or the other of the searchlights. He used powerful night glasses for this purpose. Suddenly he gave a start. He looked closely again through his glasses. Then he uttered a cry of alarm.  The third officer, on the bridge, gave an exclamation.  \"What do you see?\" he demanded.  \"Zeppelin,\" was the reply. \"Douse the light aft. Have the man forward see if he can pick up the craft with his flash. About two points east by north.\"  There came sharp commands aboard the _Queen Mary._    CHAPTER III  WARSHIP AND ZEPPELIN   A bell tinkled in the engine room of the _Queen Mary_. The ship slowed down. Captain Raleigh had been called by the third officer. He took the bridge and issued his orders sharply.  There was no telling whether the Zeppelin sighted by the man at the gun would attack the ship, but Captain Raleigh considered it best to be on the safe side. That was why he had left orders to be called immediately should an enemy appear.  Again a bell tinkled in the engine room, following an order from the commander of the _Queen Mary_.  The great engines stopped and became silent.  \"Cut off all lights!\" was the next command.  A moment later the great ship was in darkness.  Frank and Jack, in their quarters, were awakened by the sounds of confusion above. All hands had not been piped on deck, so most of the men still lay asleep, unconscious of what was going on above, but the two lads, dressing hurriedly, made their way on deck. They walked forward, toward the bridge.  All was dark and it was this that told Frank and Jack that something was going on.  \"Wonder what's up?\" said Frank.  \"Airship, I guess,\" was the reply. \"Can't see any other reason for extinguishing all lights.\"  Near the bridge the lads stopped and waited to see what would happen. All was quiet aboard. Not a sound came from the officers or the men on deck. Then Captain Raleigh commanded:  \"Try the forward searchlight there. See if you can pick her up!\"  The light flashed aloft; and there, so far above the _Queen Mary_ as to be little more than a tiny speck, hovered a giant Zeppelin; and even as they looked, the airship came lower.  \"She's sighted us,\" said Captain Raleigh to his first officer, who stood beside him. \"Try a shot, Mr. Harrison.\"  The first officer passed the word and a second later there came the sound of the anti-aircraft gun. The gunner had taken his range at the moment the flashlight revealed the airship.  The shot brought no noticeable result.  \"Fifteen knots ahead, Mr. Harrison!\" ordered the captain.  He was afraid that the Zeppelin might drop a bomb on the ship; and from that moment until the end of the battle the _Queen Mary_ did not pause. First she headed to port and then to starboard, manoeuvering rapidly that the German airmen might not be able to reach her with a bomb.  \"Another shot!\" commanded Captain Raleigh.  Still no result.  \"Funny she doesn't rise and try and escape,\" said Frank.  \"No, it's not,\" returned Jack. \"They don't know anything about this new anti-aircraft gun. They believe they are out of range.\"  \"Well, they're likely to hit us with one of those bombs, and then where will we be?\" said Frank.  \"If they hit us you won't know anything about it,\" was Jack's response.  Again the _Queen Mary_ tried a shot at the Zeppelin.  A cheer went up from the members of the crew who stood upon deck; for the Zeppelin was seen to wabble.  \"Nicked her,\" shouted the first officer.  Jack, standing near the rail, heard something whiz by his head. Instinctively the lad ducked. He knew in a moment what had passed him; he heard something splash into the sea.  \"Bomb just missed us, sir!\" he cried, stepping forward.  \"Where?\" demanded Captain Raleigh.  \"Right here, forward, sir,\" replied Jack.  Captain Raleigh gave a quick command to his first officer, who passed it to the man at the wheel.  \"Hard a-port!\" he cried.  The ship veered crazily; and at the some moment, Frank, who was standing where Jack had been a moment before, heard something swish past.  \"Another bomb, sir!\" he reported.  There was no reply from the bridge. Captain Raleigh felt that, by bringing the ship's head hard to port, he had spoiled the range of the enemy in the air.  For some time no more bombs dropped near.  Again the _Queen Mary_ fired at the Zeppelin; and again and again.  The last shot was rewarded by another cheer from the crew. The giant Zeppelin was seen to drop suddenly.  The crew cheered loud and long for it appeared that the Zeppelin was about to drop into the sea. Down she came and still down; and then her descent suddenly halted.  To those aboard the _Queen Mary_ this was unexplainable.  \"Fire again, quickly!\" shouted the captain.  The air gun boomed. At the same moment a man was seen to lean over the side of the Zeppelin. He dropped something.  Again Captain Raleigh acted promptly and brought the head of the _Queen Mary_ around. The German bomb missed. Before another could be dropped, the man who manned the anti-aircraft gun fired again.  Another cheer from the crew.  The Zeppelin began to sink slowly.  \"Full speed ahead!\" cried Captain Raleigh. \"They'll sink us!\"  The _Queen Mary_ leaped ahead just in time.  And then the Zeppelin dropped.  With a splash it hit the water perhaps a quarter of a mile from the British battleship. Came cries from the men, caught beneath the gas bag. At that moment Jack stood close to the bridge. Captain Raleigh saw him.  \"Man a boat, Mr. Templeton,\" he called, \"and rescue those fellows in the water.\"  Quickly Jack sprang to obey. Frank leaped after him. Hurriedly a small boat was gotten out and launched. A half dozen sailors sprang in and took up the oars. Frank and Jack leaped in after them.  The oars glistened in the glare of the searchlight as the men raised them and awaited the word.  \"Give way,\" said Jack.  The boat sped over the smooth surface of the sea.  Close to the wreckage of the Zeppelin it approached; and cries told Jack that some of the Germans still lived.  \"Hurry!\" he cried, and the men increased their stroke.  Near the wreckage Jack gave the command to cease rowing. A German swam toward the boat. Hands helped him in and he lay in the bottom panting. Other forms swam toward them. These, too, were lifted in the boat. And at last Jack counted fifteen Germans who had been saved.  \"Are you all here?\" he asked of a German officer.  \"All but Commander Butz, sir,\" was the man's reply.  Jack commanded his men to row closer to the wreckage.  \"Ahoy there!\" he shouted, when he had come close.  The lad thought he heard a muffled answer, but he could not make sure. He called again. This time the answer came plainer.  \"Where are you?\" asked Jack.  \"Under the wreckage,\" was the reply.  Jack scrutinized the wreckage closely.  \"Looks like it might sink any minute,\" he said \"But we can't leave him there.\"  \"What are you going to do?\" asked Frank.  For answer Jack arose in the boat. Quickly he threw off his coat and kicked off his shoes. Then he poised himself on the edge of the boat.  \"I'm going after him,\" he replied.  Before Frank could reply, he had dived head first into the sea.  With a cry of alarm, Frank also sprang to his feet and divested himself of his coat and shoes.  \"Stay close, men!\" he commanded. \"I'll lend a hand if it's needed.\"  He, too, leaped into the water.  Rapidly, Jack swam close to the wreckage. He continued to call to the German, and while he received an answer each time, he could not locate the man. Twice he swam around all that remained of the huge Zeppelin. By this time Frank had come up with him.  \"Can't you find him?\" he asked.  \"No,\" returned Jack, \"and I am rather afraid to swim under there. The balloon may sink and carry me under. But if I were certain in exactly what spot the man is imprisoned, I'd have a try at it.\"  Frank listened attentively; and directly the German's voice came again. To Frank it seemed that the voice came from directly ahead of him.  \"Lay hold of this end here,\" he said to Jack. \"If you can lift it a bit I'll go under and have a look.\"  \"Better let me do it, Frank,\" said Jack.  \"No; you're stronger than I am. You can hold this up better.\"  Jack did as his chum requested and a moment later Frank disappeared under the wreckage, diving first to make sure that he got under.  Under the water the lad swam forward. His hand touched something that was threshing about.  He felt sure it was the German. He rose. His head came in contact with something, but the lad opened his eyes and saw that he was above the surface. The imprisoned German was close beside him.  \"Dive!\" said Frank. \"You can come out all right.\"  \"Can't,\" was the reply. \"My arm is caught.\"  Frank made a quick examination.  \"I can loosen it,\" he said at last, \"but I'll probably break the arm.\"  \"Loosen it,\" said the German, quietly.  Frank took a firm hold on the arm at the elbow and gave a quick wrench. He felt something give, and when he released his hold on the man's arm, the latter sank suddenly.  Frank dived after him quickly. It was even as the lad feared. The German had fainted from the pain of the arm, which Frank had broken cleanly as he released it.  Frank dived deep and his outstretched hand encountered the German. The lad grasped the man firmly by the collar and then struck upwards. A moment later he succeeded in making his way to where Jack still tugged at the balloon.  Jack lent a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10081"],["title","The Boy Allies at Jutland; Or, The Greatest Naval Battle of History (#3)"],["body","and they dragged the German from beneath the wreckage. Then they towed him to the boat and other hands lifted him in. Frank and Jack clambered aboard.  \"Give way!\" said Jack, sharply.  The boat moved toward the battleship; and even as it did so, the mass of wreckage suddenly disappeared from sight with a loud noise.  Jack shuddered.  \"Pretty close, Frank,\" he said quietly. \"You can see what would have happened if you had still been under there.\"    CHAPTER IV  ATHLETICS   \"Can you fight?\"  The speaker was a young British midshipman. Jack and Frank stood at the rail, gazing off toward the distant horizon, when the young man approached them. The lads turned quickly.  \"Can you fight?\" demanded the young man again. His eyes rested on Jack.  \"Well,\" said the latter with a smile, \"I can if I'm pushed to it. Who wants to lick me now?\"  The young midshipman also smiled.  \"It's not that kind of a fight I'm talking about,\" he said. \"You're new aboard, so I'll explain.\"  \"Do,\" said Jack.  \"Well, there has been considerable rivalry between the men of our ship and the crew of the _Indefatigable_. We had an athletic contest last year and they beat us, carrying everything but the standing broad jump. This year we are better fortified and we hope to get even. Among other things there will be a boxing match. Jackson, that's the man we had entered in that event, is ill. I have been elected to find a substitute. I sized you up as being able to hold your own with most.\"  \"Well, if that's the way of it, you can count me in, of course,\" said Jack. \"When does this come off?\"  \"As soon as we come up with the _Indefatigable_. Probably tomorrow.\"  \"What other events are there?\" asked Frank.  \"Plenty,\" was the reply. \"Besides the boxing match and standing broad jump are the running broad jump; high jumping, a match with foils and a revolver contest.\"  \"And are your lists filled?\" asked Frank.  \"I believe so. Why?\"  \"Well, I'd like to get in the revolver contest,\" replied the lad. \"I'm pretty handy with a gun.\"  \"I'll see what can be done,\" returned the midshipman. \"By the way, my name is Lawrence.\"  They shook hands and walked off.  \"Well, that's something to liven things up a bit,\" said Frank.  \"Yes; but I didn't know they were doing such things in time of war.\"  \"Neither did I; but it seems they are.\"  It was late that evening when Lawrence again approached the two lads.  \"You're in luck,\" he said to Frank. \"We are still one man shy on our revolver team. I have named you for the place.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Frank. \"I'll promise to do the best I can. By the way, where is this match to take place?\"  \"Right here. Last year it was pulled off on the _Indefatigable_.\"  It was drawing toward night when the _Queen Mary,_ steaming swiftly, sighted smoke upon the horizon. Two hours later she slowed down a short distance from three other vessels, which proved to be the _Indefatigable_, the _Invincible_ and the _Lion_, the latter the flagship of Vice-Admiral Beatty.  The commanders exchanged salutations; and among other things made arrangements for the athletic contest that was to take place aboard the _Queen Mary_ the following day. This was explained to the men.  The day's events were to begin at nine o'clock. They were to come in this order: Standing broad jump, running broad jump, high jump, foil match, revolver contest and boxing match.  \"You're last on the card, Jack,\" said Frank, with a laugh, when they were informed of the manner in which the events were to be pulled off.  \"Hope I'm last on my feet, too,\" said Jack, with a laugh.  \"Oh, I'm not worrying about you. You'll come through with flying colors. I hope I am not nervous, though.\"  \"You won't be,\" said Jack, positively. \"I know you and that revolver of yours too well.\"  \"Guess we had better turn in early so as to be fit,\" said Frank.  And they did, retiring several hours after mess.  Every man aboard the _Queen Mary_ was astir bright and early the following morning. Each man was filled with enthusiasm and each was ready to wager his next year's pay on the outcome of each event. But there was to be no gambling. Admiral Beatty had issued orders to that effect.  At eight o'clock the championship entrants from the _Indefatigable_ came aboard, accompanied by many of their companions, who would be present to cheer them on. Officers as well as men were greatly interested in the day's sports. Admiral Beatty could not be present, but Captain Reynolds, of the _Indefatigable_, stood by Captain Raleigh, of the _Queen Mary_, as the first event was called.  \"We're going to get even with you this time, Reynolds,\" said Captain Raleigh.  \"Oh, no you won't. The score will be two in our favor after today.\"  They became silent as four men, two from each ship, made ready for the standing broad jump.  The jumping was superb. After eight attempts one man from each ship was eliminated; and at length the _Indefatigable_ man won.  \"Two points for us, Raleigh,\" said Captain Reynolds, jotting down something on the back of an envelope.  \"Don't crow, we'll get you yet, Reynolds,\" was Captain Raleigh's reply.  The running broad jump was won by the _Queen Mary's_ entrants. Then it was Captain Raleigh's time to smile.  \"Told you so,\" he said to Captain Reynolds.  \"Oh, you won one event last year,\" was the reply. \"This high jump comes to us.\"  And it did. The score was now four to two in favor of the _Indefatigable_. Then came the match with foils and this also went to the _Indefatigable_, making the score nine to two, for this match carried five points for the winner. Also, the pistol contest and the boxing match carried five points each.  \"We've got you now, Raleigh,\" laughed Captain Reynolds. \"Nine to two. You've got to take both of the next two events to win. It can't be done.\"  \"It has been done,\" was the reply.  \"It won't be this time,\" was the reply. \"I think we will win the revolver contest, for I have some pretty fair shots, but if we don't, we are sure to take the boxing match. We've a surprise for you there. Here they go.\"  The revolver match was on. There were three men on each team. The first mark was set, a target at twenty yards with a six-inch bull's eye. Frank fired first. He hit the bull's eye easily. So did the others, all except one of the _Indefatigable_ crew, who was thus eliminated, much to his disgust, as the spectators jeered him.  The next shot at a smaller mark eliminated one of the _Queen Mary's_ crew. An _Indefatigable_ man and a _Queen Mary_ man both missed the next mark and there remained but Frank for the _Queen Mary_ and a man named Simpson for the _Indefatigable_.  The target had been removed to sixty yards and the bull's eye was but two inches. Frank fired and scored a hit. So did Simpson. Next both hit the mark ten yards farther back.  A one-inch bull's eye was substituted. Frank fired first. He scored a clean hit. Simpson also hit the eye, though not so squarely. Still it counted a hit.  Now the bull's eye was reduced to half an inch, and at seventy yards it seemed almost impossible to hit it. This time Simpson was to fire first. Carefully he took deliberate aim and fired.  A shout went up from the _Queen Mary_ men who stood near.  \"Missed it by a hair,\" said one. \"Beat it, Chadwick! Beat it!\"  \"He can't beat it! Hooray! We've won!\" This from the _Indefatigable's_ crew.  \"Good shooting, old man,\" said Frank, quietly, as he took his position.  Carefully he measured the distance with his eye.  Then he raised his revolver slowly, and seeming scarcely to take aim, fired.  And a yell went up from the _Queen Mary's_ crew.  \"Bull's eye! Bull's eye!\" they cried, and danced and capered about the deck.  Frank had won. He had hit the bull's eye squarely.  The men rushed up and danced about him.  \"Good work!\" they cried. \"Five points for us. Nine to seven now. We'll win this yet!\"  Simpson approached Frank and extended a hand.  \"Good shooting, son,\" he exclaimed.  Simpson was a man well along in years, and he put this touch of familiarity to his words to make Frank realize that they were sincere. \"I used to be something of a shot myself,\" he said. \"But I guess you are better than I ever was.\"  Frank took Simpson's hand.  \"You would probably beat me next time,\" he said.  Simpson shook his head.  \"Not in a thousand years,\" he said, and walked off.  Meantime, Captain Raleigh and Captain Reynolds were having it out.  \"Told you so! Told you so!\" exclaimed the former, as pleased as a boy. \"We'll beat you yet, sure.\"  \"No, you won't, Raleigh,\" said Reynolds, with a wink. \"I'll tell you something. Ever hear of a man named Harris?\"  \"Yes; I know several men by that name.\"  \"Ever hear of Tim Harris?\"  \"By George! You mean Tim Harris, of the _Queen Elizabeth_?\"  \"The same.\"  \"The champion of the British fleet, eh? You mean to tell me you have rung him in on us?\"  \"We didn't ring him in,\" was the reply. \"He was transferred to the _Indefatigable_ before the _Queen Elizabeth_ went to the Dardanelles. We've been saving this up as a little surprise.\"  Captain Raleigh had lost his look of optimism.  \"Then our man should be warned,\" he said. \"He may wish to withdraw.\"  \"It is only fair to tell him who his opponent is,\" agreed Captain Reynolds. \"I guess we should have done it long ago.\"  \"I'll tell him,\" said Captain Raleigh.  At this moment there was a loud cheer from the crew of the _Queen Mary_.  \"Here he comes!\" they shouted.  Jack, stripped to the waist and wearing a pair of trunks, had appeared on deck. Two men accompanied him. These, it seemed, were to be his seconds. Jack caught sight of Frank and smiled.  And again the crew of the _Queen Mary_ went wild.    CHAPTER V  THE FIGHT   The champion of the _Indefatigable_ had not yet appeared on deck; and the crew of the _Queen Mary_ strained their necks hunting him out.  \"Bring out your champion!\" they called. \"What's the matter with him? Is he afraid?\"  The men of the _Indefatigable_ returned these compliments with jeers of their own.  \"Oh, just wait!\""]]]
