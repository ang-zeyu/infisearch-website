Yes, Uncle Tom, if you must have it. I shall have to tell him soon about losing all that money at baccarat, and, when I do, he will go up like a rocket.”  “Still, no doubt Time, the great healer----”  “Time, the great healer, be blowed. I’ve got to get a cheque for five hundred pounds out of him for _Milady’s Boudoir_ by August the third at the latest.”  I was concerned. Apart from a nephew’s natural interest in an aunt’s refined weekly paper, I had always had a soft spot in my heart for _Milady’s Boudoir_ ever since I contributed that article to it on What the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing. Sentimental, possibly, but we old journalists do have these feelings.  “Is the _Boudoir_ on the rocks?”  “It will be if Tom doesn’t cough up. It needs help till it has turned the corner.”  “But wasn’t it turning the corner two years ago?”  “It was. And it’s still at it. Till you’ve run a weekly paper for women, you don’t know what corners are.”  “And you think the chances of getting into uncle--into my uncle by marriage’s ribs are slight?”  “I’ll tell you, Bertie. Up till now, when these subsidies were required, I have always been able to come to Tom in the gay, confident spirit of an only child touching an indulgent father for chocolate cream. But he’s just had a demand from the income-tax people for an additional fifty-eight pounds, one and threepence, and all he’s been talking about since I got back has been ruin and the sinister trend of socialistic legislation and what will become of us all.”  I could readily believe it. This Tom has a peculiarity I’ve noticed in other very oofy men. Nick him for the paltriest sum, and he lets out a squawk you can hear at Land’s End. He has the stuff in gobs, but he hates giving up.  “If it wasn’t for Anatole’s cooking, I doubt if he would bother to carry on. Thank God for Anatole, I say.”  I bowed my head reverently.  “Good old Anatole,” I said.  “Amen,” said Aunt Dahlia.  Then the look of holy ecstasy, which is always the result of letting the mind dwell, however briefly, on Anatole’s cooking, died out of her face.  “But don’t let me wander from the subject,” she resumed. “I was telling you of the way hell’s foundations have been quivering since I got home. First the prize-giving, then Tom, and now, on top of everything else, this infernal quarrel between Angela and young Glossop.”  I nodded gravely. “I was frightfully sorry to hear of that. Terrible shock. What was the row about?”  “Sharks.”  “Eh?”  “Sharks. Or, rather, one individual shark. The brute that went for the poor child when she was aquaplaning at Cannes. You remember Angela’s shark?”  Certainly I remembered Angela’s shark. A man of sensibility does not forget about a cousin nearly being chewed by monsters of the deep. The episode was still green in my memory.  In a nutshell, what had occurred was this: You know how you aquaplane. A motor-boat nips on ahead, trailing a rope. You stand on a board, holding the rope, and the boat tows you along. And every now and then you lose your grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to your board again.  A silly process it has always seemed to me, though many find it diverting.  Well, on the occasion referred to, Angela had just regained her board after taking a toss, when a great beastly shark came along and cannoned into it, flinging her into the salty once more. It took her quite a bit of time to get on again and make the motor-boat chap realize what was up and haul her to safety, and during that interval you can readily picture her embarrassment.  According to Angela, the finny denizen kept snapping at her ankles virtually without cessation, so that by the time help arrived, she was feeling more like a salted almond at a public dinner than anything human. Very shaken the poor child had been, I recall, and had talked of nothing else for weeks.  “I remember the whole incident vividly,” I said. “But how did that start the trouble?”  “She was telling him the story last night.”  “Well?”  “Her eyes shining and her little hands clasped in girlish excitement.”  “No doubt.”  “And instead of giving her the understanding and sympathy to which she was entitled, what do you think this blasted Glossop did? He sat listening like a lump of dough, as if she had been talking about the weather, and when she had finished, he took his cigarette holder out of his mouth and said, ‘I expect it was only a floating log’!”  “He didn’t!”  “He did. And when Angela described how the thing had jumped and snapped at her, he took his cigarette holder out of his mouth again, and said, ‘Ah! Probably a flatfish. Quite harmless. No doubt it was just trying to play.’ Well, I mean! What would you have done if you had been Angela? She has pride, sensibility, all the natural feelings of a good woman. She told him he was an ass and a fool and an idiot, and didn’t know what he was talking about.”  I must say I saw the girl’s viewpoint. It’s only about once in a lifetime that anything sensational ever happens to one, and when it does, you don’t want people taking all the colour out of it. I remember at school having to read that stuff where that chap, Othello, tells the girl what a hell of a time he’d been having among the cannibals and what not. Well, imagine his feelings if, after he had described some particularly sticky passage with a cannibal chief and was waiting for the awestruck “Oh-h! Not really?”, she had said that the whole thing had no doubt been greatly exaggerated and that the man had probably really been a prominent local vegetarian.  Yes, I saw Angela’s point of view.  “But don’t tell me that when he saw how shirty she was about it, the chump didn’t back down?”  “He didn’t. He argued. And one thing led to another until, by easy stages, they had arrived at the point where she was saying that she didn’t know if he was aware of it, but if he didn’t knock off starchy foods and do exercises every morning, he would be getting as fat as a pig, and he was talking about this modern habit of girls putting make-up on their faces, of which he had always disapproved. This continued for a while, and then there was a loud pop and the air was full of mangled fragments of their engagement. I’m distracted about it. Thank goodness you’ve come, Bertie.”  “Nothing could have kept me away,” I replied, touched. “I felt you needed me.”  “Yes.”  “Quite.”  “Or, rather,” she said, “not you, of course, but Jeeves. The minute all this happened, I thought of him. The situation obviously cries out for Jeeves. If ever in the whole history of human affairs there was a moment when that lofty brain was required about the home, this is it.”  I think, if I had been standing up, I would have staggered. In fact, I’m pretty sure I would. But it isn’t so dashed easy to stagger when you’re sitting in an arm-chair. Only my face, therefore, showed how deeply I had been stung by these words.  Until she spoke them, I had been all sweetness and light--the sympathetic nephew prepared to strain every nerve to do his bit. I now froze, and the face became hard and set.  “Jeeves!” I said, between clenched teeth.  “Oom beroofen,” said Aunt Dahlia.  I saw that she had got the wrong angle.  “I was not sneezing. I was saying ‘Jeeves!’”  “And well you may. What a man! I’m going to put the whole thing up to him. There’s nobody like Jeeves.”  My frigidity became more marked.  “I venture to take issue with you, Aunt Dahlia.”  “You take what?”  “Issue.”  “You do, do you?”  “I emphatically do. Jeeves is hopeless.”  “What?”  “Quite hopeless. He has lost his grip completely. Only a couple of days ago I was compelled to take him off a case because his handling of it was so footling. And, anyway, I resent this assumption, if assumption is the word I want, that Jeeves is the only fellow with brain. I object to the way everybody puts things up to him without consulting me and letting me have a stab at them first.”  She seemed about to speak, but I checked her with a gesture.  “It is true that in the past I have sometimes seen fit to seek Jeeves’s advice. It is possible that in the future I may seek it again. But I claim the right to have a pop at these problems, as they arise, in person, without having everybody behave as if Jeeves was the only onion in the hash. I sometimes feel that Jeeves, though admittedly not unsuccessful in the past, has been lucky rather than gifted.”  “Have you and Jeeves had a row?”  “Nothing of the kind.”  “You seem to have it in for him.”  “Not at all.”  And yet I must admit that there was a modicum of truth in what she said. I had been feeling pretty austere about the man all day, and I’ll tell you why.  You remember that he caught that 12.45 train with the luggage, while I remained on in order to keep a luncheon engagement. Well, just before I started out to the tryst, I was pottering about the flat, and suddenly--I don’t know what put the suspicion into my head, possibly the fellow’s manner had been furtive--something seemed to whisper to me to go and have a look in the wardrobe.  And it was as I had suspected. There was the mess-jacket still on its hanger. The hound hadn’t packed it.  Well, as anybody at the Drones will tell you, Bertram Wooster is a pretty hard chap to outgeneral. I shoved the thing in a brown-paper parcel and put it in the back of the car, and it was on a chair in the hall now. But that didn’t alter the fact that Jeeves had attempted to do the dirty on me, and I suppose a certain what-d’you-call-it had crept into my manner during the above remarks.  “There has been no breach,” I said. “You might describe it as a passing coolness, but no more. We did not happen to see eye to eye with regard to my white mess-jacket with the brass buttons and I was compelled to assert my personality. But----”  “Well, it doesn’t"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],["title","The Old Man in the Corner (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: \"The old man in the corner.\"]     THE OLD MAN IN THE CORNER  BY  BARONESS ORCZY     TO MY DEAR UNCLE AND AUNT  COUNT AND COUNTESS WASS OF CZEGE  IN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY HAPPY DAYS SPENT IN TRANSYLVANIA  _October, 1908_     CONTENTS  Chapter       I.

THE END     THE OLD MAN IN THE CORNER   CHAPTER I  THE FENCHURCH STREET MYSTERY   The man in the corner pushed aside his glass, and leant across the table.  \"Mysteries!\" he commented. \"There is no such thing as a mystery in connection with any crime, provided intelligence is brought to bear upon its investigation.\"  Very much astonished Polly Burton looked over the top of her newspaper, and fixed a pair of very severe, coldly inquiring brown eyes upon him.  She had disapproved of the man from the instant when he shuffled across the shop and sat down opposite to her, at the same marble-topped table which already held her large coffee (3d.), her roll and butter (2d.), and plate of tongue (6d.).  Now this particular corner, this very same table, that special view of the magnificent marble hall--known as the Norfolk Street branch of the Aërated Bread Company's depôts--were Polly's own corner, table, and view. Here she had partaken of eleven pennyworth of luncheon and one pennyworth of daily information ever since that glorious never-to-be-forgotten day when she was enrolled on the staff of the _Evening Observer_ (we'll call it that, if you please), and became a member of that illustrious and world-famed organization known as the British Press.  She was a personality, was Miss Burton of the _Evening Observer_. Her cards were printed thus:  [Illustration: Miss MARY J. BURTON. _Evening Observer_.]  She had interviewed Miss Ellen Terry and the Bishop of Madagascar, Mr. Seymour Hicks and the Chief Commissioner of Police. She had been present at the last Marlborough House garden party--in the cloak-room, that is to say, where she caught sight of Lady Thingummy's hat, Miss What-you-may-call's sunshade, and of various other things modistical or fashionable, all of which were duly described under the heading \"Royalty and Dress\" in the early afternoon edition of the _Evening Observer_.  (The article itself is signed M.J.B., and is to be found in the files of that leading halfpennyworth.)  For these reasons--and for various others, too--Polly felt irate with the man in the corner, and told him so with her eyes, as plainly as any pair of brown eyes can speak.  She had been reading an article in the _Daily Telegraph_. The article was palpitatingly interesting. Had Polly been commenting audibly upon it? Certain it is that the man over there had spoken in direct answer to her thoughts.  She looked at him and frowned; the next moment she smiled. Miss Burton (of the _Evening Observer)_ had a keen sense of humour, which two years' association with the British Press had not succeeded in destroying, and the appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultra-morose fancy. Polly thought to herself that she had never seen any one so pale, so thin, with such funny light-coloured hair, brushed very smoothly across the top of a very obviously bald crown. He looked so timid and nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string; his long, lean, and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful and complicated proportions.  Having carefully studied every detail of the quaint personality Polly felt more amiable.  \"And yet,\" she remarked kindly but authoritatively, \"this article, in an otherwise well-informed journal, will tell you that, even within the last year, no fewer than six crimes have completely baffled the police, and the perpetrators of them are still at large.\"  \"Pardon me,\" he said gently, \"I never for a moment ventured to suggest that there were no mysteries to the _police_; I merely remarked that there were none where intelligence was brought to bear upon the investigation of crime.\"  \"Not even in the Fenchurch Street _mystery_. I suppose,\" she asked sarcastically.  \"Least of all in the so-called Fenchurch Street _mystery_,\" he replied quietly.  Now the Fenchurch Street mystery, as that extraordinary crime had popularly been called, had puzzled--as Polly well knew--the brains of every thinking man and woman for the last twelve months. It had puzzled her not inconsiderably; she had been interested, fascinated; she had studied the case, formed her own theories, thought about it all often and often, had even written one or two letters to the Press on the subject--suggesting, arguing, hinting at possibilities and probabilities, adducing proofs which other amateur detectives were equally ready to refute. The attitude of that timid man in the corner, therefore, was peculiarly exasperating, and she retorted with sarcasm destined to completely annihilate her self-complacent interlocutor.  \"What a pity it is, in that case, that you do not offer your priceless services to our misguided though well-meaning police.\"  \"Isn't it?\" he replied with perfect good-humour. \"Well, you know, for one thing I doubt if they would accept them; and in the second place my inclinations and my duty would--were I to become an active member of the detective force--nearly always be in direct conflict. As often as not my sympathies go to the criminal who is clever and astute enough to lead our entire police force by the nose.  \"I don't know how much of the case you remember,\" he went on quietly. \"It certainly, at first, began even to puzzle me. On the 12th of last December a woman, poorly dressed, but with an unmistakable air of having seen better days, gave information at Scotland Yard of the disappearance of her husband, William Kershaw, of no occupation, and apparently of no fixed abode. She was accompanied by a friend--a fat, oily-looking German--and between them they told a tale which set the police immediately on the move.  \"It appears that on the 10th of December, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, Karl Müller, the German, called on his friend, William Kershaw, for the purpose of collecting a small debt--some ten pounds or so--which the latter owed him. On arriving at the squalid lodging in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, he found William Kershaw in a wild state of excitement, and his wife in tears. Müller attempted to state the object of his visit, but Kershaw, with wild gestures, waved him aside, and--in his own words--flabbergasted him by asking him point-blank for another loan of two pounds, which sum, he declared, would be the means of a speedy fortune for himself and the friend who would help him in his need.  \"After a quarter of an hour spent in obscure hints, Kershaw, finding the cautious German obdurate, decided to let him into the secret plan, which, he averred, would place thousands into their hands.\"  Instinctively Polly had put down her paper; the mild stranger, with his nervous air and timid, watery eyes, had a peculiar way of telling his tale, which somehow fascinated her.  \"I don't know,\" he resumed, \"if you remember the story which the German told to the police, and which was corroborated in every detail by the wife or widow. Briefly it was this: Some thirty years previously, Kershaw, then twenty years of age, and a medical student at one of the London hospitals, had a chum named Barker, with whom he roomed, together with another.  \"The latter, so it appears, brought home one evening a very considerable sum of money, which he had won on the turf, and the following morning he was found murdered in his bed. Kershaw, fortunately for himself, was able to prove a conclusive _alibi_; he had spent the night on duty at the hospital; as for Barker, he had disappeared, that is to say, as far as the police were concerned, but not as far as the watchful eyes of his friend Kershaw were able to spy--at least, so the latter said. Barker very cleverly contrived to get away out of the country, and, after sundry vicissitudes, finally settled down at Vladivostok, in Eastern Siberia, where, under the assumed name of Smethurst, he built up an enormous fortune by trading in furs.  \"Now, mind you, every one knows Smethurst, the Siberian millionaire. Kershaw's story that he had once been called Barker, and had committed a murder thirty years ago, was never proved, was it? I am merely telling you what Kershaw said to his friend the German and to his wife on that memorable afternoon of December the 10th.  \"According to him Smethurst had made one gigantic mistake in his clever career--he had on four occasions written to his late friend, William Kershaw. Two of these letters had no bearing on the case, since they were written more than twenty-five years ago, and Kershaw, moreover, had lost them--so he said--long ago. According to him, however, the first of these letters was written when Smethurst, alias Barker, had spent all the money he had obtained from the crime, and found himself destitute in New York.  \"Kershaw, then in fairly prosperous"]]]
