The chance of a ship of low speed avoiding a hit by a timely alteration of course after the torpedo has been fired is but slight. Further, the only difficulty experienced by a submarine in hitting a moving vessel by torpedo-fire, once she has arrived in a position suitable for attack, lies in estimating correctly the course and speed of the target. In the case of an ordinary cargo ship there is little difficulty in guessing her speed, since it is certain to be between 8 and 12 knots, and her course can be judged with fair accuracy by the angle of her masts and funnel, or by the angle presented by her bridge.  It will be seen, then, how easy was the problem before the German submarine officers, and how very difficult was that set to our Navy and our gallant Mercantile Marine.  It will not be out of place here to describe the methods which were in force at the end of 1916 and during the first part of 1917 for affording protection to merchant shipping approaching our coasts from the direction of the Atlantic Ocean.  The general idea dating from the early months of the war was to disperse trade on passage over wide tracts of ocean, in order to prevent the successful attacks which could be so easily carried out if shipping traversed one particular route. To carry out such a system it was necessary to give each vessel a definite route which she should follow from her port of departure to her port of arrival; unless this course was adopted, successive ships would certainly be found to be following identical, or practically identical, routes, thereby greatly increasing the chance of attack. In the early years of the war masters of ships were given approximate tracks, but when the unrestricted submarine campaign came into being it became necessary to give exact routes.  The necessary orders were issued by officers stationed at various ports at home and abroad who were designated Shipping Intelligence or Reporting Officers. It was, of course, essential to preserve the secrecy of the general principles governing the issue of route orders and of the route orders themselves. For this reason each master was only informed of the orders affecting his own ship, and was directed that such orders should on no account fall into the hands of the enemy.  The route orders were compiled on certain principles, of which a few may be mentioned:  (a) Certain definite positions of latitude and longitude were given through which the ship was required to pass, and the orders were discussed with the master of each vessel in order to ensure that they were fully understood.  (b) Directions were given that certain localities in which submarines were known to operate, such as the approaches to the coast of the United Kingdom, were, if possible, to be crossed at night. It was pointed out that when the speed of the ship did not admit of traversing the whole danger area at night, the portion involving the greatest danger (which was the inshore position) should, as a rule, be crossed during dark hours.  (c) Similarly the orders stated that ships should, as a rule, leave port so as to approach the dangerous area at dusk, and that they should make the coast at about daylight, and should avoid, as far as possible, the practice of making the land at points in general use in peace time.  (d) Orders were definite that ships were to zigzag both by day and at night in certain areas, and if kept waiting outside a port.  (e) Masters were cautioned to hug the coast, as far as navigational facilities admitted, when making coastal passages.  The orders (b), (c) and (d) were those in practice in the Grand Fleet when circumstances permitted during my term in that command.  A typical route order from New York to Liverpool might be as follows:  \"After passing Sandy Hook, hug the coast until dark, then make a good offing before daylight and steer to pass through the following positions, viz:  Lat. 38° N.                Long. 68° W. Lat. 41° N.                Long. 48° W. Lat. 46° N.                Long. 28° W. Lat. 51° 30'  N.           Long. 14° W.  \"Thence make the coast near the Skelligs approximately at daylight, hug the Irish coast to the Tuskar, up the Irish coast (inside the banks if possible), and across the Irish Channel during dark hours. Thence hug the coast to your port; zigzag by day and night after passing, Long. 20° W.\"  Sometimes ships were directed to cross to the English coast from the south of Ireland, and to hug the English coast on their way north.  The traffic to the United Kingdom was so arranged in the early part of 1917 as to approach the coast in four different areas, which were known as Approach A, B, C, and D.  Approach A was used for traffic bound towards the western approach to the English Channel.  Approach B for traffic making for the south of Ireland.  Approach C for traffic making for the north of Ireland.  Approach D for traffic making for the east coast of England via the north of Scotland.  The approach areas in force during one particular period are shown on Chart A (in pocket at the end of the book). They were changed occasionally when suspicion was aroused that their limits were known to the enemy, or as submarine attack in an area became intense.  [Transcriber's note: Chart A is a navigational map of the waters southwest of England, with approach routes marked.]  The approach areas were patrolled at the time, so far as numbers admitted, by patrol craft (trawlers, torpedo-boat destroyers, and sloops), and ships with specially valuable cargoes were given directions to proceed to a certain rendezvous on the outskirts of the area, there to be met by a destroyer or sloop, if one was available for the purpose. The areas were necessarily of considerable length, by reason of the distance from the coast at which submarines operated, and of considerable width, owing to the necessity for a fairly wide dispersion of traffic throughout the area. Consequently, with the comparatively small number of patrol craft available, the protection afforded was but slight, and losses were correspondingly heavy. In the early spring of 1917, Captain H.W. Grant, of the Operations Division at the Admiralty, whose work in the Division was of great value, proposed a change in method by which the traffic should be brought along certain definite \"lines\" in each approach area. Typical lines are shown in Chart B.  [Transcriber's note: Chart B is a navigational map of the waters southwest of Ireland, with approach routes marked.]  The idea was that the traffic in, say, Approach Route B, should, commencing on a certain date, be ordered by the Routeing Officer to pass along the line Alpha. Traffic would continue along the line for a certain period, which was fixed at five days, when it would be automatically diverted to another line, say Gamma, but the traffic along Gamma would not commence until a period of 24 hours had elapsed since discontinuance of the use of the line Alpha. This was necessary in order to give time for the patrol craft to change from one line to the other. During this period of 24 hours the arrangement for routeing at the ports of departure ensured that no traffic would reach the outer end of any of the approach lines, and consequently that traffic would cease on line Alpha 24 hours before it commenced on line Gamma. After a further period of five days the line would again change automatically.  It was necessary that Shipping Intelligence Officers should have in their possession the orders for directing traffic on to the various lines for some considerable time ahead, and the masters of ships which were likely to be for some time at sea were informed of the dates between which the various lines were to be used, up to a date sufficient to cover the end of their voyage. There was, therefore, some danger of this information reaching the enemy if a vessel were captured by a submarine and the master failed to destroy his instructions in time. There was also some danger in giving the information to neutrals.  However, the system, which was adopted, did result in a reduction of losses during the comparatively short time that it was in use, and the knowledge that patrol craft on the line would be much closer together than they would be in an approach area certainly gave confidence to the personnel of the merchant ships, and those who had been forced to abandon their ship by taking to the boats were afforded a better chance of being picked up.  Various arrangements were in existence for effecting rapidly a diversion of shipping from one route to another in the event of submarines being located in any particular position, and a continual change of the signals for this purpose was necessary to guard against the possibility of the code being compromised by having fallen into enemy hands, an event which, unfortunately, was not infrequent.  Elaborate orders were necessary to regulate coastal traffic, and fresh directions were continually being issued as danger, especially danger from mines, was located. Generally speaking, the traffic in home waters was directed to hug the coast as closely as safe navigation permitted. Two reasons existed for this, (a) in water of a depth of less than about eight fathoms German submarines did not care to operate, and (b) under the procedure indicated danger from submarine attack was only likely on the side remote from the coast.  Here is an example of the instructions for passing up Channel:  _From Falmouth to Portland Bill._--Hug the coast, following round the bays, except when passing Torbay. (Directions followed as to the procedure here.)  _From Portland Bill to St. Catherines._--Pass close south of the Shambles and steer for Anvil Point, thence hug the coast, following round the bays.  And so on.  As it was not safe navigationally to follow round the bays during darkness, the instructions directed that ships were to leave the daylight route at dusk and to join the dark period route,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10422"],["title","Caesar Dies (#0)"],["body","DIES  by Talbot Mundy     I.  IN THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR COMMODUS    Golden Antioch lay like a jewel at a mountain's throat.  Wide, intersecting streets, each nearly four miles long, granite-paved, and marble-colonnaded, swarmed with fashionable loiterers.  The gay Antiochenes, whom nothing except frequent earthquakes interrupted from pursuit of pleasure, were taking the air in chariots, in litters, and on foot;  their linen clothes were as riotously picturesque as was the fruit displayed in open shop-fronts under the colonnades, or as the blossom on the trees in public gardens, which made of the city, as seen from the height of the citadel, a mosaic of green and white.  The crowd on the main thoroughfares was aristocratic;  opulence was accented by groups of slaves in close attendance on their owners;  but the aristocracy was sharply differentiated.  The Romans, frequently less wealthy (because those who had made money went to Rome to spend it)-- frequently less educated and, in general, not less dissolute--despised the Antiochenes, although the Romans loved Antioch.  The cosmopolitan Antiochenes returned the compliment, regarding Romans as mere duffers in depravity, philistines in art, but capable in war and government, and consequently to be feared, if not respected.  So there was not much mingling of the groups, whose slaves took example from their masters, affecting in public a scorn that they did not feel but were careful to assert.  The Romans were intensely dignified and wore the toga, pallium and tunic;  the Antiochenes affected to think dignity was stupid and its trappings (forbidden to them) hideous;  so they carried the contrary pose to extremes. Patterning herself on Alexandria, the city had become to all intents and purposes the eastern capital of Roman empire.  North, south, east and west, the trade-routes intersected, entering the city through the ornate gates in crenelated limestone walls. From miles away the approaching caravans were overlooked by legionaries brought from Gaul and Britain, quartered in the capitol on Mount Silpius at the city's southern limit.  The riches of the East, and of Egypt, flowed through, leaving their deposit as a river drops its silt;  were ever- increasing.  One quarter, walled off, hummed with foreign traders from as far away as India, who lodged at the travelers' inns or haunted the temples, the wine-shops and the lupanars.  In that quarter, too, there were barracks, with compounds and open-fronted booths, where slaves were exposed for sale;  and there, also, were the caravanserais within whose walls the kneeling camels grumbled and the blossomy spring air grew fetid with the reek of dung.  There was a market-place for elephants and other oriental beasts.  Each of Antioch's four divisions had its own wall, pierced by arched gates.  Those were necessary.  No more turbulent and fickle population lived in the known world--not even in Alexandria.  Whenever an earthquake shook down blocks of buildings--and that happened nearly as frequently as the hysterical racial riots--the Romans rebuilt with a view to making communications easier from the citadel, where the great temple of Jupiter Capitolinus frowned over the gridironed streets.  Roman officials and the wealthier Macedonian Antiochenes lived on an island, formed by a curve of the River Orontes at the northern end within the city wall.  The never-neglected problem of administration was to keep a clear route along which troops could move from citadel to island when the rioting began.  On the island was the palace, glittering with gilt and marble, gay with colored awnings, where kings had lived magnificently until Romans saved the city from them, substituting a proconsular paternal kind of tyranny originating in the Roman patria potestas.  There was not much sentiment about it.  Rome became the foster-parent, the possessor of authority. There was duty, principally exacted from the governed in the form of taxes and obedience;  and there were privileges, mostly reserved for the rulers and their parasites, who were much more numerous than anybody liked.  Competition made the parasites as discontented as their prey.  But there were definite advantages of Roman rule, which no Antiochene denied, although their comic actors and the slaves who sang at private entertainments mocked the Romans and invented accusations of injustice and extortion that were even more outrageous than the truth.  Not since the days when Antioch inherited the luxury and vices of the Greeks and Syrians, had pleasure been so organized or its commercial pursuit so profitable.  Taxes were collected rigorously.  The demands of Rome, increased by the extravagance of Commodus, were merciless. But trade was good.  Obedience and flattery were well rewarded. Citizens who yielded to extortion and refrained from criticism within hearing of informers lived in reasonable expectation of surviving the coming night.  But the informers were ubiquitous and unknown, which was another reason why the Romans and Antiochenes refrained from mixing socially more than could be helped.  A secret charge of treason, based on nothing more than an informer's malice, might set even a Roman citizen outside the pale of ordinary law and make him liable to torture.  If convicted, death and confiscation followed.  Since the deification of the emperors it had become treason even to use a coarse expression near their images or statues;  images were on the coins;  statues were in the streets. Commodus, to whom all confiscated property accrued, was in ever- increasing need of funds to defray the titanic expense of the games that he lavished on Rome and the \"presents\" with which he studiously nursed the army's loyalty.  So it was wise to be taciturn;   expedient to choose one's friends deliberately; not far removed from madness to be seen in company with those whose antecedents might suggest the possibility of a political intrigue.  But it was also unwise to woo solitude;  a solitary man might perish by the rack and sword for lack of witnesses, if charged with some serious offense.  So there were comradeships more loyal the more that treachery stalked abroad.  Because seriousness drew attention from the spies, the deepest thoughts were masked beneath an air of levity, and merrymaking hid such counsels as might come within the vaguely defined boundaries of treason.  Sextus, son of Maximus, rode not alone.  Norbanus rode beside him, and behind them Scylax on the famous Arab mare that Sextus had won from Artaxes the Persian in a wager on the recent chariot races.  Scylax was a slave but no less, for that reason, Sextus' friend.  Norbanus rode a skewbald Cappadocian that kicked out sidewise at pedestrians;  so there was opportunity for private conversation, even on the road to Daphne of an afternoon in spring, when nearly all of fashionable Antioch was beginning to flow in that direction.  Horses, litters and chariots, followed by crowds of slaves on foot with the provisions for moonlight banquets, poured toward the northern gate, some overtaking and passing the three but riding wide of the skewbald Cappadocian stallion's heels.  \"If Pertinax should really come,\" said Sextus.  \"He will have a girl with him,\" Norbanus interrupted.  He had an annoying way of finishing the sentences that other folk began.  \"True.  When he is not campaigning Pertinax finds a woman irresistible.\"  \"And naturally, also, none resists a general in the field!\" Norbanus added.  \"So our handsome Pertinax performs his vows to Aphrodite with a constancy that the goddess rewards by forever putting lovely women in his way!  Whereas Stoics like you, Sextus, and unfortunates like me, who don't know how to amuse a woman, are made notorious by one least lapse from our austerity. The handsome, dissolute ones have all the luck.  The roisterers at Daphne will invent such scandalous tales of us tonight as will pursue us for a lustrum, and yet there isn't a chance in a thousand that we shall even enjoy ourselves!\"  \"Yes.  I wish now we had chosen any other meeting place than Daphne,\" Sextus answered gloomily.  \"What odds?  Had we gone into the desert Pertinax would have brought his own last desperate adorer, and a couple more to bore us while he makes himself ridiculous.  Strange--that a man so firm in war and wise in government should lose his head the moment a woman smiles at him.\"  \"He doesn't lose his head--much,\" Sextus answered.  \"But his father was a firewood seller in a village in Liguria. That is why he so loves money and the latest fashions.  Poverty and rags--austerity inflicted on him in his youth--great Jupiter!  If you and I had risen from the charcoal- burning to be consul twice and a grammarian and the friend of Marcus Aurelius;  if you and I were as handsome as he is, and had experienced a triumph after restoring discipline in Britain and conducting two or three successful wars;  and if either of us had such a wife as Flavia Titiana, I believe we could besmirch ourselves more constantly than Pertinax does!  It is not that he delights in women so much as that he thinks debauch is aristocratic.  Flavia Titiana is unfaithful to him. She is also a patrician and unusually clever. He has never understood her, but she is witty, so he thinks her wonderful and tries to imitate her immorality.  But the only woman who really sways him is the proudish Cornificia, who is almost as incapable of treachery as Pertinax himself. He is the best governor the City of Rome has had in our generation.  Can you imagine what Rome would be like without him?  Call to mind what it was like when Fuscianus was the governor!\"  \"These are strange times, Sextus!\"  \"Aye!  And it is a strange beast we have for emperor!\"  \"Be careful!\"  Sextus glanced over his shoulder to make sure that Scylax followed closely and prevented any one from overhearing.  There was an endless procession now, before and behind, all bound for Daphne.  As the riders"]]]
