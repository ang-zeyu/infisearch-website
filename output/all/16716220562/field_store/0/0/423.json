They flitted along like a flock of swallows, hopping and skipping from wave to wave, lifting their little feet behind them so daintily that Tom fell in love with them at once.\"  Nancy stopped reading and laid down the copy of \"Water Babies\" on the sitting-room table. \"No more just now, Peter-bird,\" she said; \"I hear mother coming.\"  It was a cold, dreary day in late October, with an east wind and a chill of early winter in the air. The cab stood in front of Captain Carey's house, with a trunk beside the driver and a general air of expectancy on the part of neighbors at the opposite windows.  Mrs. Carey came down the front stairway followed by Gilbert and Kathleen; Gilbert with his mother's small bag and travelling cloak, Kathleen with her umbrella; while little Peter flew to the foot of the stairs with a small box of sandwiches pressed to his bosom.  Mrs. Carey did not wear her usual look of sweet serenity, but nothing could wholly mar the gracious dignity of her face and presence. As she came down the stairs with her quick, firm tread, her flock following her, she looked the ideal mother. Her fine height, her splendid carriage, her deep chest, her bright eye and fresh color all bespoke the happy, contented, active woman, though something in the way of transient anxiety lurked in the eyes and lips.  \"The carriage is too early,\" she said; \"let us come into the sitting room for five minutes. I have said my good-byes and kissed you all a dozen times, but I shall never be done until I am out of your sight.\"  \"O mother, mother, how can we let you go!\" wailed Kathleen.  \"Kitty! how can you!\" exclaimed Nancy. \"What does it matter about us when mother has the long journey and father is so ill?\"  \"It will not be for very long,--it can't be,\" said Mrs. Carey wistfully. \"The telegram only said 'symptoms of typhoid'; but these low fevers sometimes last a good while and are very weakening, so I may not be able to bring father back for two or three weeks; I ought to be in Fortress Monroe day after to-morrow; you must take turns in writing to me, children!\"  \"Every single day, mother!\"  \"Every single thing that happens.\"  \"A fat letter every morning,\" they promised in chorus.  \"If there is any real trouble remember to telegraph your Uncle Allan--did you write down his address, 11 Broad Street, New York? Don't bother him about little things, for he is not well, you know.\"  Gilbert displayed a note-book filled with memoranda and addresses.  \"And in any small difficulty send for Cousin Ann,\" Mrs. Carey went on.  \"The mere thought of her coming will make me toe the mark, I can tell you that!\" was Gilbert's rejoinder.  \"Better than any ogre or bug-a-boo, Cousin Ann is, even for Peter!\" said Nancy.  \"And will my Peter-bird be good and make Nancy no trouble?\" said his mother, lifting him to her lap for one last hug.  \"I'll be an angel boy pretty near all the time,\" he asserted between mouthfuls of apple, \"or most pretty near,\" he added prudently, as if unwilling to promise anything superhuman in the way of behavior. As a matter of fact it required only a tolerable show of virtue for Peter to win encomiums at any time. He would brush his curly mop of hair away from his forehead, lift his eyes, part his lips, showing a row of tiny white teeth; then a dimple would appear in each cheek and a seraphic expression (wholly at variance with the facts) would overspread the baby face, whereupon the beholder--Mother Carey, his sisters, the cook or the chambermaid, everybody indeed but Cousin Ann, who could never be wheedled--would cry \"Angel boy!\" and kiss him. He was even kissed now, though he had done nothing at all but exist and be an enchanting personage, which is one of the injustices of a world where a large number of virtuous and well-behaved people go unkissed to their graves!  \"I know Joanna and Ellen will take good care of the housekeeping,\" continued Mrs. Carey, \"and you will be in school from nine to two, so that the time won't go heavily. For the rest I make Nancy responsible. If she is young, you must remember that you are all younger still, and I trust you to her.\"  \"The last time you did it, it didn't work very well!\" And Gilbert gave Nancy a sly wink to recall a little matter of family history when there had been a delinquency on somebody's part.  Nancy's face crimsoned and her lips parted for a quick retort, and none too pleasant a one, apparently.  Her mother intervened quietly. \"We'll never speak of 'last times,' Gilly, or where would any of us be? We'll always think of 'next' times. I shall trust Nancy next time, and next time and next time, and keep on trusting till I can trust her forever!\"  Nancy's face lighted up with a passion of love and loyalty. She responded to the touch of her mother's faith as a harp to the favoring wind, but she said nothing; she only glowed and breathed hard and put her trembling hand about her mother's neck and under her chin.  \"Now it's time! One more kiss all around. Remember you are Mother Carey's own chickens! There may be gales while I am away, but you must ride over the crests of the billows as merry as so many flying fish! Good-by! Good-by! Oh, my littlest Peter-bird, how can mother leave you?\"  \"I opened the lunch box to see what Ellen gave you, but I only broke off two teenty, weenty corners of sandwiches and one little new-moon bite out of a cookie,\" said Peter, creating a diversion according to his wont.  Ellen and Joanna came to the front door and the children flocked down the frozen pathway to the gate after their mother, getting a touch of her wherever and whenever they could and jumping up and down between whiles to keep warm. Gilbert closed the door of the carriage, and it turned to go down the street. One window was open, and there was a last glimpse of the beloved face framed in the dark blue velvet bonnet, one last wave of a hand in a brown muff.  \"Oh! she is so beautiful!\" sobbed Kathleen, \"her bonnet is just the color of her eyes; and she was crying!\"  \"There never was anybody like mother!\" said Nancy, leaning on the gate, shivering with cold and emotion. \"There never was, and there never will be! We can try and try, Kathleen, and we _must_ try, all of us; but mother wouldn't have to try; mother must have been partly born so!\"    II  THE CHICKENS   It was Captain Carey's favorite Admiral who was responsible for the phrase by which mother and children had been known for some years. The Captain (then a Lieutenant) had brought his friend home one Saturday afternoon a little earlier than had been expected, and they went to find the family in the garden.  Laughter and the sound of voices led them to the summer-house, and as they parted the syringa bushes they looked through them and surprised the charming group.    A throng of children like to flowers were sown   About the grass beside, or climbed her knee.   I looked who were that favored company.  That is the way a poet would have described what the Admiral saw, and if you want to see anything truly and beautifully you must generally go to a poet.  Mrs. Carey held Peter, then a crowing baby, in her lap. Gilbert was tickling Peter's chin with a buttercup, Nancy was putting a wreath of leaves on her mother's hair, and Kathleen was swinging from an apple-tree bough, her yellow curls flying.  \"Might I inquire what you think of that?\" asked the father.  \"Well,\" the Admiral said, \"mothers and children make a pretty good picture at any time, but I should say this one couldn't be 'beat.' Two for the Navy, eh?\"  \"All four for the Navy, perhaps,\" laughed the young man. \"Nancy has already chosen a Rear-Admiral and Kathleen a Commodore; they are modest little girls!\"  \"They do you credit, Peter!\"  \"I hope I've given them something,--I've tried hard enough, but they are mostly the work of the lady in the chair. Come on and say how d'ye do.\"  Before many Saturdays the Admiral's lap had superseded all other places as a gathering ground for the little Careys, whom he called the stormy petrels.  \"Mother Carey,\" he explained to them, came from the Latin _mater cara_, this being not only his personal conviction, but one that had the backing of Brewer's \"Dictionary of Phrase and Fable.\"  \"The French call them _Les Oiseaux de Notre Dame_. That means 'The Birds of our Lady,' Kitty, and they are the sailors' friends. Mother Carey sends them to warn seafarers of approaching storms and bids them go out all over the seas to show the good birds the way home. You'll have your hands full if you're going to be Mother Carey's chickens.\"  \"I'd love to show good birds the way home!\" said Gilbert.  \"Can a naughty bird show a good bird the way home, Addy?\" This bland question came from Nancy, who had a decided talent for sarcasm, considering her years. (Of course the Admiral"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10540"],["title","Mother Carey's Chickens (#1)"],["body","have stopped the children from calling him Addy, but they seemed to do it because \"Admiral\" was difficult, and anyway they loved him so much they simply had to take some liberties with him. Besides, although he was the greatest disciplinarian that ever walked a deck, he was so soft and flexible on land that he was perfectly ridiculous and delightful.)  The day when the children were christened Mother Carey's chickens was Nancy's tenth birthday, a time when the family was striving to give her her proper name, having begun wrong with her at the outset. She was the first, you see, and the first is something of an event, take it how you will.  It is obvious that at the beginning they could not address a tiny thing on a pillow as Nancy, because she was too young. She was not even alluded to at that early date as \"she,\" but always as \"it,\" so they called her \"baby\" and let it go at that. Then there was a long period when she was still too young to be called Nancy, and though, so far as age was concerned, she might properly have held on to her name of baby, she couldn't with propriety, because there was Gilbert then, and he was baby. Moreover, she gradually became so indescribably quaint and bewitching and comical and saucy that every one sought diminutives for her; nicknames, fond names, little names, and all sorts of words that tried to describe her charm (and couldn't), so there was Poppet and Smiles and Minx and Rogue and Midget and Ladybird and finally Nan and Nannie by degrees, to soberer Nancy.  \"Nancy is ten to-day,\" mused the Admiral. \"Bless my soul, how time flies! You were a young Ensign, Carey, and I well remember the letter you wrote me when this little lass came into harbor! Just wait a minute; I believe the scrap of newspaper verse you enclosed has been in my wallet ever since. I always liked it.\"  \"I recall writing to you,\" said Mr. Carey. \"As you had lent me five hundred dollars to be married on, I thought I ought to keep you posted!\"  \"Oh, father! did you have to borrow money?\" cried Kathleen.  \"I did, my dear. There's no disgrace in borrowing, if you pay back, and I did. Your Uncle Allan was starting in business, and I had just put my little capital in with his when I met your mother. If you had met your mother wouldn't you have wanted to marry her?\"  \"Yes!\" cried Nancy eagerly. \"Fifty of her!\" At which everybody laughed.  \"And what became of the money you put in Uncle Allan's business?\" asked Gilbert with unexpected intelligence.  There was a moment's embarrassment and an exchange of glances between mother and father before he replied, \"Oh! that's coming back multiplied six times over, one of these days,--Allan has a very promising project on hand just now, Admiral.\"  \"Glad to hear it! A delightful fellow, and straight as a die. I only wish he could perform once in a while, instead of promising.\"  \"He will if only he keeps his health, but he's heavily handicapped there, poor chap. Well, what's the verse?\"  The Admiral put on his glasses, prettily assisted by Kathleen, who was on his knee and seized the opportunity to give him a French kiss when the spectacles were safely on the bridge of his nose. Whereupon he read:--    \"There came to port last Sunday night     The queerest little craft,   Without an inch of rigging on;     I looked, and looked, and laughed.    \"It seemed so curious that she     Should cross the unknown water,   And moor herself within my room--     My daughter, O my daughter!    \"Yet, by these presents, witness all,     She's welcome fifty times,   And comes consigned to Hope and Love     And common metre rhymes.    \"She has no manifest but this;     No flag floats o'er the water;   She's rather new for British Lloyd's--     My daughter, O my daughter!    \"Ring out, wild bells--and tame ones, too;     Ring out the lover's moon,   Ring in the little worsted socks,     Ring in the bib and spoon.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: George W. Cable.]  \"Oh, Peter, how pretty!\" said Mother Carey all in a glow. \"You never showed it to me!\"  \"You were too much occupied with the aforesaid 'queer little craft,' wasn't she, Nan--I mean Nancy!\" and her father pinched her ear and pulled a curly lock.  Nancy was a lovely creature to the eye, and she came by her good looks naturally enough. For three generations her father's family had been known as the handsome Careys, and when Lieutenant Carey chose Margaret Gilbert for his wife, he was lucky enough to win the loveliest girl in her circle.  Thus it was still the handsome Careys in the time of our story, for all the children were well-favored and the general public could never decide whether Nancy or Kathleen was the belle of the family. Kathleen had fair curls, skin like a rose, and delicate features; not a blemish to mar her exquisite prettiness! All colors became her; all hats suited her hair. She was the Carey beauty so long as Nancy remained out of sight, but the moment that young person appeared Kathleen left something to be desired. Nancy piqued; Nancy sparkled; Nancy glowed; Nancy occasionally pouted and not infrequently blazed. Nancy's eyes had to be continually searched for news, both of herself and of the immediate world about her. If you did not keep looking at her every \"once in so often\" you couldn't keep up with the progress of events; she might flash a dozen telegrams to somebody, about something, while your head was turned away. Kathleen could be safely left unwatched for an hour or so without fear of change; her moods were less variable, her temper evener; her interest in the passing moment less keen, her absorption in the particular subject less intense. Walt Whitman might have been thinking of Nancy when he wrote:--                There was a child went forth every day   And the first object he looked upon, that object he became,   And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the          day   Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years.  Kathleen's nature needed to be stirred, Nancy's to be controlled, the impulse coming from within, the only way that counts in the end, though the guiding force may be applied from without.  Nancy was more impulsive than industrious, more generous than wise, more plucky than prudent; she had none too much perseverance and no patience at all.  Gilbert was a fiery youth of twelve, all for adventure. He kindled quickly, but did not burn long, so deeds of daring would be in his line; instantaneous ones, quickly settled, leaving the victor with a swelling chest and a feather in cap; rather an obvious feather suited Gilbert best.  Peter? Oh! Peter, aged four, can be dismissed in very few words as a consummate charmer and heart-breaker. The usual elements that go to the making of a small boy were all there, but mixed with white magic. It is painful to think of the dozens of girl babies in long clothes who must have been feeling premonitory pangs when Peter was four, to think they couldn't all marry him when they grew up!    III  THE COMMON DENOMINATOR   Three weeks had gone by since Mother Carey's departure for Fortress Monroe, and the children had mounted from one moral triumph to another. John Bunyan, looking in at the windows, might have exclaimed:--    Who would true valor see   Let him come hither.  It is easy to go wrong in a wicked world, but there are certain circumstances under which one is pledged to virtue; when, like a knight of the olden time, you wear your motto next your heart and fight for it,--\"Death rather than defeat!\" \"We are able because we think we are able!\" \"Follow honor!\" and the like. These sentiments look beautifully as class mottoes on summer graduation programmes, but some of them, apparently, disappear from circulation before cold weather sets in.  It is difficult to do right, we repeat, but not when mother is away from us for the first time since we were born; not when she who is the very sun of home is shining elsewhere, and we are groping in the dim light without her, only remembering her last words and our last promises. Not difficult when we think of the eyes the color of the blue velvet bonnet, and the tears falling from them. They are hundreds of miles away, but we see them looking at us a dozen times a day and the last thing at night.  Not difficult when we think of father; gay, gallant father, desperately ill and mother nursing him; father, with the kind smile and the jolly little sparkles of fun in his eyes; father, tall and broad-shouldered, splendid as the gods, in full uniform; father, so brave that if a naval battle ever did come his way, he would demolish the foe in an instant; father, with a warm strong hand clasping ours on high days and holidays, taking us on great expeditions where we see life at its best and taste incredible joys.  The most quarrelsome family, if the house burns down over their heads, will stop disputing until the emergency is over and they get under a new roof. Somehow, in times of great trial, calamity, sorrow, the differences that separate people are forgotten. Isn't it rather like the process in mathematics where we reduce fractions to a common denominator?  It was no time for anything but superior behavior in the Carey household; that was distinctly felt from kitchen to nursery. Ellen the cook was tidier, Joanna the second maid more amiable. Nancy, who was \"responsible,\" rose earlier than the rest and went to bed later, after locking doors and windows that had been left unlocked since the flood. \"I am responsible,\" she said three or four times each day, to herself, and, it is to be feared, to others! Her heavenly patience in dressing Peter every few hours without comment struck the most callous observer as admirable. Peter never remembered that he had any clothes on. He might have been a real stormy petrel, breasting the billows in his birthday suit and expecting his feathers to be dried when and how the Lord pleased. He comported himself in the presence of dust, mud, water, liquid refreshment, and sticky"]]]
