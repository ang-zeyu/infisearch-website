The coroner drew the two physicians aside and talked to them for a few moments in a low tone. Then he turned to Grady.  \"Freylinghuisen thinks there is no necessity for a post-mortem,\" he said. \"The symptoms are in every way identical with those of the other man who was killed here this afternoon. There can be no question that both of them died from the same cause. He is ready to make his return to that effect.\"  \"Very well,\" assented Grady. \"The body can be turned over to the relatives, then.\"  \"There aren't any relatives,\" I said; \"at least, no near ones. Vantine was the last of this branch of the family. I happen to know that our firm has been named as his executors in his will, so, if there is no objection, I'll take charge of things.\"  \"Very well, Mr. Lester,\" said Grady again; and then he looked at me. \"Do you know the provisions of the will?\" he asked.  \"I do.\"  \"In the light of those provisions, do you know of any one who would have an interest in Vantine's death?\"  \"I think I may tell you the provisions,\" I said, after a moment. \"With the exception of a few legacies to his servants, his whole fortune is left to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\"  \"You have been his attorney for some time?\"  \"We have been his legal advisers for many years.\"  \"Have you ever learned that he had an enemy?\"  \"No,\" I answered instantly; \"so far as I know, he had not an enemy on earth.\"  \"He was never married, I believe?\"  \"No.\"  \"Was he ever, to your knowledge, involved with a woman?\"  \"No,\" I said again. \"I was astounded when I heard Rogers's story.\"  \"So you can give us no hint as to this woman's identity?\"  \"I only wish I could!\" I said, with fervour.  \"Thank you, Mr. Lester,\" and Grady turned to Simmonds. \"I don't see that there is anything more we can do here,\" he added. \"There's one thing, though, Mr. Lester, I will have to ask you to do. That is to keep all the servants here until after the inquest. If you think there is any doubt of your ability to do that, we can, of course, put them under arrest--\"  \"Oh, that isn't necessary,\" I broke in. \"I will be responsible for their appearance at the inquest.\"  \"I'll have to postpone it a day,\" said Goldberger. \"I want Freylinghuisen to make some tests to-morrow. Besides, we've got to identify d'Aurelle, and these gentlemen seem to have their work cut out for them in finding this woman--\"  Grady looked at Goldberger in a way which indicated that he thought he was talking too much, and the coroner stopped abruptly. A moment later, all four men left the house.  Dr. Hughes lingered for a last word.  \"The undertaker had better be called at once,\" he said. \"It won't do to delay too long.\"  I knew what he meant. Already the face of the dead man was showing certain ugly discolourations.  \"I can send him around on my way home,\" he added, and I thanked him for assuming this unpleasant duty.  As the door closed behind him, I heard a step on the stair, and turned to see Godfrey calmly descending.  \"I came in a few minutes ago,\" he explained, in answer to my look, \"and have been glancing around upstairs. Nothing there. How did our friend Grady get along?\"  \"Fairly well; but if he guesses anything, his face didn't show it.\"  \"His face never shows anything, because there's nothing to show. He has cultivated that sibylline look until people think he's a wonder. But he's simply a stupid ignoramus.\"  \"Oh, come, Godfrey,\" I protested, \"you're prejudiced. He went right to the point. Do you know Rogers's story?\"  \"About the woman? Certainly. Rogers told it to me before Grady arrived.\"  \"Well,\" I commented, \"you didn't lose any time.\"  \"I never do,\" he assented blandly. \"And now I'm going to prove to you that Grady is merely a stupid ignoramus. He has heard all the evidence, but does he know who that woman was?\"  \"Of course not,\" I said, and then I looked at him. \"Do you mean that you do? Then I'm an ignoramus, too!\"  \"My dear Lester,\" protested Godfrey, \"you are not a detective--that's not your business; but it _is_ Grady's. At least, it is supposed to be, and the safety of this city as a place of residence depends more or less upon the truth of that assumption. On the strength of it, he has been made deputy police commissioner, in charge of the detective bureau.\"  \"Then you mean that you _do_ know who she was?\"  \"I'm pretty sure I do--that is what I came back to prove. Where's Rogers?\"  \"I'll ring for him,\" I said, and did so, and presently he appeared.  \"Did you ring, sir?\" he asked.  He was still miserably nervous, but much more self-controlled than he had been earlier in the evening.  \"Yes,\" I said. \"Mr. Godfrey wishes to speak to you.\"  It seemed to me that Rogers turned visibly paler; there was certainly fear in the glance he turned upon my companion. But Godfrey smiled reassuringly.  \"We'd better give him his instructions about the reporters, first thing, hadn't we, Lester?\" he inquired.  \"Which reporters?\" I queried.  \"All the others, of course. They will be storming this house, Rogers, before long. You will meet them at the door, you will refuse to admit one of them; you will tell them that there is nothing to be learned here, and that they must go to the police. Tell them that Commissioner Grady himself is in charge of the case and will no doubt be glad to talk to them. Is that right, Lester?\"  \"Yes, Ulysses,\" I agreed, smiling.  \"And now,\" continued Godfrey, watching Rogers keenly, \"I have a photograph here that I want you to look at. Did you ever see that person before?\" and he handed a print to Rogers.  The latter hesitated an instant, and then took the print with a trembling hand. Stark fear was in his eyes again; then slowly he raised the print to the light, glanced at it....  \"Catch him, Lester!\" Godfrey cried, and sprang forward.  For Rogers, clutching wildly at his collar, spun half around and fell with a crash. Godfrey's arm broke the fall somewhat, but as for me, I was too dazed to move.  \"Get some water, quick!\" Godfrey commanded sharply, as Parks came running up. \"Rogers has been taken ill.\"  And then, as Parks sped down the hall again, I saw Godfrey loosen the collar of the unconscious man and begin to chafe his temples fiercely.  \"I hope it isn't apoplexy,\" he muttered. \"I oughtn't to have shocked him like that.\"  At the words, I remembered; and, stooping, picked up the photograph which had fluttered from Rogers's nerveless fingers. And then I, too, uttered a smothered exclamation as I gazed at the dark eyes, the full lips, the oval face--the face which d'Aurelle had carried in his watch!     CHAPTER VIII  PRECAUTIONS   But it wasn't apoplexy. It was Parks who reassured us, when he came hurrying back a minute later with a glass of water in one hand and a small phial in the other.  \"He has these spells,\" he said. \"It's a kind of vertigo. Give him a whiff of this.\"  He uncorked the phial and handed it to Godfrey, and I caught the penetrating fumes of ammonia. A moment later, Rogers gasped convulsively.  \"He'll be all right pretty soon,\" remarked Parks, with ready optimism. \"Though I never saw him quite so bad.\"  \"We can't leave him lying here on the floor,\" said Godfrey.  \"There's a couch-seat in the music-room,\" Parks suggested, and the three of us bore the still unconscious man to it.  Then Godfrey and I sat down and waited, while he gasped his way back to life.  \"Though he can't really tell us much,\" Godfrey observed. \"In fact, I doubt if he'll be willing to tell anything. But his face, when he looked at the picture, told us all we need to know.\"  Thus reminded, I took the photograph out of the pocket into which I had slipped it, and looked at it again.  \"Where did you get it?\" I asked.  \"The police photographer made some copies. This is one of them.\"  \"But what made you suspect that the two women were the same?\"  \"I don't just know,\" answered Godfrey, reflectively. \"They were both French--and Rogers spoke of the red lips; somehow it seemed probable. Mr. Grady will find some things he doesn't know in to-morrow's _Record_. But then he usually does. This time, I'm going to rub it in. Hello,\" he added, \"our friend is coming around.\"  I looked at Rogers and saw that his eyes were open. They were staring at us as though wondering who we were. Godfrey passed an arm under his head and held the glass of water to his lips.  \"Take a swallow of this,\" he said, and Rogers obeyed mechanically, still staring at him over the rim of the glass, \"How do you feel?\"  \"Pretty weak,\" Rogers answered, almost in a whisper. \"Did I have a fit?\"  \"Something like that,\" said Godfrey, cheerfully; \"but don't worry. You'll soon be all right again.\"  \"What sent me off?\" asked Rogers, and stared up at him. Then his face turned purple, and I thought he was going off again. But after a moment's heavy breathing, he lay quiet. \"I remember now,\" he said. \"Let me see that picture again.\"  I passed it to him. His hand was trembling so he could hardly take it; but I saw he was struggling desperately to control himself, and he managed to hold the picture up before his eyes and look at it with apparent unconcern.  \"Do you know her?\" Godfrey asked.  To my infinite amazement, Rogers shook his head.  \"Never saw her before,\" he muttered. \"When I first looked at her, I thought I knew her; but it ain't the same woman.\"  \"Do you mean to say,\" Godfrey demanded sternly, \"that that is not the woman who called on Mr. Vantine to-night?\"  Again Rogers shook his head.  \"Oh, no,\" he protested; \"it's not the same woman at all. This one is younger.\"  Godfrey made no reply; but he sat down and looked at Rogers, and Rogers lay and gazed at the picture, and gradually his face softened, as though at some tender memory.  \"Come, Rogers,\" I urged, at last. \"You'd better tell us all you know. If this is the woman, don't hesitate to say so.\"  \"I've told you all I know, Mr. Lester,\" said Rogers, but he did not meet my eyes. \"And I'm feeling pretty bad. I think I'd better be getting to bed.\"  \"Yes, that's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],["title","Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#0)"],["body","FROM THE DIVINE COMEDY  BY Dante Alighieri  Translated by THE REV.

PARADISE     CANTO I   His glory, by whose might all things are mov’d, Pierces the universe, and in one part Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less. In heav’n, That largeliest of his light partakes, was I, Witness of things, which to relate again Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence; For that, so near approaching its desire Our intellect is to such depth absorb’d, That memory cannot follow. Nathless all, That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm Could store, shall now be matter of my song.  Benign Apollo! this last labour aid, And make me such a vessel of thy worth, As thy own laurel claims of me belov’d. Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus’ brows Suffic’d me; henceforth there is need of both For my remaining enterprise Do thou Enter into my bosom, and there breathe So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg’d Forth from his limbs unsheath’d. O power divine! If thou to me of shine impart so much, That of that happy realm the shadow’d form Trac’d in my thoughts I may set forth to view, Thou shalt behold me of thy favour’d tree Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves; For to that honour thou, and my high theme Will fit me. If but seldom, mighty Sire! To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills Deprav’d) joy to the Delphic god must spring From the Pierian foliage, when one breast Is with such thirst inspir’d. From a small spark Great flame hath risen: after me perchance Others with better voice may pray, and gain From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.  Through diver passages, the world’s bright lamp Rises to mortals, but through that which joins Four circles with the threefold cross, in best Course, and in happiest constellation set He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives Its temper and impression. Morning there, Here eve was by almost such passage made; And whiteness had o’erspread that hemisphere, Blackness the other part; when to the left I saw Beatrice turn’d, and on the sun Gazing, as never eagle fix’d his ken. As from the first a second beam is wont To issue, and reflected upwards rise, E’en as a pilgrim bent on his return, So of her act, that through the eyesight pass’d Into my fancy, mine was form’d; and straight, Beyond our mortal wont, I fix’d mine eyes Upon the sun. Much is allowed us there, That here exceeds our pow’r; thanks to the place Made for the dwelling of the human kind  I suffer’d it not long, and yet so long That I beheld it bick’ring sparks around, As iron that comes boiling from the fire. And suddenly upon the day appear’d A day new-ris’n, as he, who hath the power, Had with another sun bedeck’d the sky.  Her eyes fast fix’d on the eternal wheels, Beatrice stood unmov’d; and I with ken Fix’d upon her, from upward gaze remov’d At her aspect, such inwardly became As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb, That made him peer among the ocean gods; Words may not tell of that transhuman change: And therefore let the example serve, though weak, For those whom grace hath better proof in store  If I were only what thou didst create, Then newly, Love! by whom the heav’n is rul’d, Thou know’st, who by thy light didst bear me up. Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide, Desired Spirit! with its harmony Temper’d of thee and measur’d, charm’d mine ear, Then seem’d to me so much of heav’n to blaze With the sun’s flame, that rain or flood ne’er made A lake so broad. The newness of the sound, And that great light, inflam’d me with desire, Keener than e’er was felt, to know their cause.  Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself, To calm my troubled mind, before I ask’d, Open’d her lips, and gracious thus began: “With false imagination thou thyself Mak’st dull, so that thou seest not the thing, Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off. Thou art not on the earth as thou believ’st; For light’ning scap’d from its own proper place Ne’er ran, as thou hast hither now return’d.”  Although divested of my first-rais’d doubt, By those brief words, accompanied with smiles, Yet in new doubt was I entangled more, And said: “Already satisfied, I rest From admiration deep, but now admire How I above those lighter bodies rise.”  Whence, after utt’rance of a piteous sigh, She tow’rds me bent her eyes, with such a look, As on her frenzied child a mother casts; Then thus began: “Among themselves all things Have order; and from hence the form, which makes The universe resemble God. In this The higher creatures see the printed steps Of that eternal worth, which is the end Whither the line is drawn. All natures lean, In this their order, diversely, some more, Some less approaching to their primal source. Thus they to different havens are mov’d on Through the vast sea of being, and each one With instinct giv’n, that bears it in its course; This to the lunar sphere directs the fire, This prompts the hearts of mortal animals, This the brute earth together knits, and binds. Nor only creatures, void of intellect, Are aim’d at by this bow; but even those, That have intelligence and love, are pierc’d. That Providence, who so well orders all, With her own light makes ever calm the heaven, In which the substance, that hath greatest speed, Is turn’d: and thither now, as to our seat Predestin’d, we are carried by the force Of that strong cord, that never looses dart, But at fair aim and glad. Yet is it true, That as ofttimes but ill accords the form To the design of art, through sluggishness Of unreplying matter, so this course Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere; As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall, From its original impulse warp’d, to earth, By vicious fondness. Thou no more admire Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse Of torrent downwards from a mountain’s height. There would in thee for wonder be more cause, If, free of hind’rance, thou hadst fix’d thyself Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.”  So said, she turn’d toward the heav’n her face.     CANTO II   All ye, who in small bark have following sail’d, Eager to listen, on the advent’rous track Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way, Backward return with speed, and your own shores Revisit, nor put out to open sea, Where losing me, perchance ye may remain Bewilder’d in deep maze. The way I pass Ne’er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale, Apollo guides me, and another Nine To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal. Ye other few, who have outstretch’d the neck. Timely for food of angels, on which here They live, yet never know satiety, Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad Before you in the wave, that on both sides Equal returns. Those, glorious, who pass’d o’er To Colchos, wonder’d not as ye will do, When they saw Jason following the plough.  The increate perpetual thirst, that draws Toward the realm of God’s own form, bore us Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.  Beatrice upward gaz’d, and I on her, And in such space as on the notch a dart Is plac’d, then loosen’d flies, I saw myself Arriv’d, where wond’rous thing engag’d my sight. Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid, Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair, Bespake me: “Gratefully direct thy mind To God, through whom to this first star we come.”  Me seem’d as if a cloud had cover’d us, Translucent, solid, firm, and polish’d bright, Like adamant, which the sun’s beam had smit Within itself the ever-during pearl Receiv’d us, as the wave a ray of light Receives, and rests unbroken. If I then Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus Another could endure, which needs must be If body enter body, how much more Must the desire inflame us to behold That essence, which discovers by what means God and our nature join’d! There will be seen That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof, But in itself intelligibly plain, E’en as the truth that man at first believes.  I answered: “Lady! I with thoughts devout, Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him, Who hath remov’d me from the mortal world. But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots Upon this body, which below on earth Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?”  She somewhat smil’d, then spake: “If mortals err In their opinion, when the key of sense Unlocks not, surely wonder’s weapon keen Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find’st, the wings Of reason to pursue the senses’ flight Are short. But what thy own thought is, declare.”  Then I: “What various here above appears, Is caus’d, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.”  She then resum’d: “Thou certainly wilt see In falsehood thy belief o’erwhelm’d, if well Thou listen to the arguments, which I Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays Numberless lights, the which in kind and size May be remark’d of different aspects; If rare or dense of that were cause alone, One single virtue then would be in all, Alike distributed, or more, or less. Different virtues needs must be the fruits Of formal principles, and these, save one, Will by thy reasoning be destroy’d. Beside, If rarity were of that dusk the cause, Which thou inquirest, either in some part That planet must throughout be void, nor fed With its own matter; or, as bodies share Their fat and leanness, in like manner this Must in its volume change the leaves. The first, If it were true, had through the sun’s eclipse Been manifested, by transparency Of light, as through aught rare beside effus’d. But this is not. Therefore "]]]
