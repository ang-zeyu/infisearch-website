He had goat's legs, little horns on his head, and a long beard; the children in the room called him, \"Major-General-field-sergeant -commander-Billy-goat's-legs\" ... He was always looking at the table under the looking-glass where stood a very pretty little shepherdess made of china.... Close by her side stood a little chimney-sweep, as black as coal and also made of china.... Near to them stood another figure.... He was an old Chinaman who could nod his head, and used to pretend he was the grandfather of the shepherdess, although he could not prove it. He, however, assumed authority over her, and therefore when \"Major-general-field-sergeant-commander-Billy-goat's -legs\" asked for the little shepherdess to be his wife, he nodded his head to show that he consented.  Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart, the chimney-sweep. \"I must entreat you,\" said she, \"to go out with me into the wide world, for we cannot stay here.\" ... When the chimney-sweep saw that she was quite firm, he said, \"My way is through the stove up the chimney.\" ... So at last they reached the top of the chimney.... The sky with all its stars was over their heads.... They could see for a very long distance out into the wide world, and the poor little shepherdess leaned her head on her chimney-sweep's shoulder and wept. \"This is too much,\" she said, \"the world is too large.\" ... And so with a great deal of trouble they climbed down the chimney and peeped out.... There lay the old Chinaman on the floor ... broken into three pieces.... \"This is terrible,\" said the shepherdess. \"He can be riveted,\" said the chimney-sweep.... The family had the Chinaman's back mended and a strong rivet put through his neck; he looked as good as new, but when \"Major-General-field-sergeant-commander-Billy-goat's-legs\" again asked for the shepherdess to be his wife, the old Chinaman could no longer nod his head.  And so the little china people remained together and were thankful for the rivet in grandfather's neck, and continued to love each other until they were broken to pieces.     PART ONE - PROPINQUITY    _\"A singer, eh?... Well, well! but when he sings   Take jealous heed lest idiosyncrasies   Entinge and taint too deep his melodies;   See that his lute has no discordant strings   To harrow us; and let his vaporings   Be all of virtue and its victories,   And of man's best and noblest qualities,   And scenery, and flowers, and similar things_.    \"Thus bid our paymasters whose mutterings   Some few deride, and blithely link their rhymes   At random; and, as ever, on frail wings   Of wine-stained paper scribbled with such rhymes   Men mount to heaven, and loud laughter springs   From hell's midpit, whose fuel is such rhymes.\"  PAUL VERVILLE. _Nascitur_.     I   At a very remote period, when editorials were mostly devoted to discussion as to whether the Democratic Convention (shortly to be held in Chicago) would or would not declare in favor of bi-metallism; when golf was a novel form of recreation in America, and people disputed how to pronounce its name, and pedestrians still turned to stare after an automobile; when, according to the fashion notes, \"the godet skirts and huge sleeves of the present modes\" were already doomed to extinction; when the baseball season had just begun, and some of our people were discussing the national game, and others the spectacular burning of the old Pennsylvania Railway depot at Thirty-third and Market Street in Philadelphia, and yet others the significance of General Fitzhugh Lee's recent appointment as consul-general to Habana:--at this remote time, Lichfield talked of nothing except the Pendomer divorce case.  And Colonel Rudolph Musgrave had very narrowly escaped being named as the co-respondent. This much, at least, all Lichfield knew when George Pendomer--evincing unsuspected funds of generosity--permitted his wife to secure a divorce on the euphemistic grounds of \"desertion.\" John Charteris, acting as Rudolph Musgrave's friend, had patched up this arrangement; and the colonel and Mrs. Pendomer, so rumor ran, were to be married very quietly after a decent interval.  Remained only to deliberate whether this sop to the conventions should be accepted as sufficient.  \"At least,\" as Mrs. Ashmeade sagely observed, \"we can combine vituperation with common-sense, and remember it is not the first time a Musgrave has figured in an entanglement of the sort. A lecherous race! proverbial flutterers of petticoats! His surname convicts the man unheard and almost excuses him. All of us feel that. And, moreover, it is not as if the idiots had committed any unpardonable sin, for they have kept out of the newspapers.\"  Her friend seemed dubious, and hazarded something concerning \"the merest sense of decency.\"  \"In the name of the Prophet, figs! People--I mean the people who count in Lichfield--are charitable enough to ignore almost any crime which is just a matter of common knowledge. In fact, they are mildly grateful. It gives them something to talk about. But when detraction is printed in the morning paper you can't overlook it without incurring the suspicion of being illiterate and virtueless. That's Lichfield.\"  \"But, Polly--\"  \"Sophist, don't I know my Lichfield? I know it almost as well as I know Rudolph Musgrave. And so I prophesy that he will not marry Clarice Pendomer, because he is inevitably tired of her by this. He will marry money, just as all the Musgraves do. Moreover, I prophesy that we will gabble about this mess until we find a newer target for our stone throwing, and be just as friendly with the participants to their faces as we ever were. So don't let me hear any idiotic talk about whether or no _I_ am going to receive her--\"  \"Well, after all, she was born a Bellingham. We must remember that.\"  \"Wasn't I saying I knew my Lichfield?\" Mrs. Ashmeade placidly observed.         *       *       *       *       *  And time, indeed, attested her to be right in every particular.  Yet it must be recorded that at this critical juncture chance rather remarkably favored Colonel Musgrave and Mrs. Pendomer, by giving Lichfield something of greater interest to talk about; since now, just in the nick of occasion, occurred the notorious Scott Musgrave murder. Scott Musgrave--a fourth cousin once removed of the colonel's, to be quite accurate--had in the preceding year seduced the daughter of a village doctor, a negligible \"half-strainer\" up country at Warren; and her two brothers, being irritated, picked this particular season to waylay him in the street, as he reeled homeward one night from the Commodores' Club, and forthwith to abolish Scott Musgrave after the primitive methods of their lower station in society.  These details, indeed, were never officially made public, since a discreet police force \"found no clues\"; for Fred Musgrave (of King's Garden), as befitted the dead man's well-to-do brother, had been at no little pains to insure constabulary shortsightedness, in preference to having the nature of Scott Musgrave's recreations unsympathetically aired. Fred Musgrave thereby afforded Lichfield a delectable opportunity (conversationally and abetted by innumerable \"they _do_ say's\") to accredit the murder, turn by turn, to every able-bodied person residing within stone's throw of its commission. So that few had time, now, to talk of Rudolph Musgrave and Clarice Pendomer; for it was not in Lichfieldian human nature to discuss a mere domestic imbroglio when here, also in the Musgrave family, was a picturesque and gory assassination to lay tongue to.  So Colonel Musgrave was duly reëlected that spring to the librarianship of the Lichfield Historical Association, and the name of Mrs. George Pendomer was not stricken from the list of patronesses of the Lichfield German Club, but was merely altered to \"Mrs. Clarice Pendomer.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At the bottom of his heart Colonel Musgrave was a trifle irritated that his self-sacrifice should be thus unrewarded by martyrdom. Circumstances had enabled him to assume, and he had gladly accepted, the blame for John Charteris's iniquity, rather than let Anne Charteris know the truth about her husband and Clarice Pendomer. The truth would have killed Anne, the colonel believed; and besides, the colonel had enjoyed the performance of a picturesque action.  And having acted as a hero in permitting himself to be pilloried as a libertine, it was preferable of course not to have incurred ostracism thereby. His common-sense conceded this; and yet, to Colonel Musgrave, it could not but be evident that Destiny was hardly rising to the possibilities of the situation.     II   Concerning Colonel Musgrave one finds the ensuing account in a publication of the period devoted to biographies of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10041"],["title","The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck: A Comedy of Limitations (#1)"],["body","or less prominent Americans. It is reproduced unchanged, because these memoirs were--in the old days--compiled by the person whom they commemorated. The custom was a worthy one, since the value of an autobiography is determined by the nature of its superfluities and falsehoods.  \"MUSGRAVE, RUDOLPH VARTREY, editor; _b_.

Handsome and trim and affable, he defied chronology by looking ten years younger than he was known to be. For at least a decade he had been invaluable to Lichfield matrons alike against the entertainment of an \"out-of-town girl,\" the management of a cotillion and the prevention of unpleasant pauses among incongruous dinner companies.  In short, he was by all accounts the social triumph of his generation; and his military title, won by four years of arduous service at receptions and parades while on the staff of a former Governor of the State, this seasoned bachelor carried off with plausibility and distinction.  The story finds him \"Librarian and Corresponding Secretary\" of the Lichfield Historical Association, which office he had held for some six years. The salary was small, and the colonel had inherited little; but his sister, Miss Agatha Musgrave, who lived with him, was a notable housekeeper. He increased his resources in a gentlemanly fashion by genealogical research, directed mostly toward the rehabilitation of ambiguous pedigrees; and for the rest, no other man could have fulfilled more gracefully the main duty of the Librarian, which was to exhibit the Association's collection of relics to hurried tourists \"doing\" Lichfield.  His \"Library manner\" was modeled upon that which an eighteenth century portrait would conceivably possess, should witchcraft set the canvas breathing.     III   Also the story finds Colonel Musgrave in the company of his sister on a warm April day, whilst these two sat upon the porch of the Musgrave home in Lichfield, and Colonel Musgrave waited until it should be time to open the Library for the afternoon. And about them birds twittered cheerily, and the formal garden flourished as gardens thrive nowhere except in Lichfield, and overhead the sky was a turkis-blue, save for a few irrelevant clouds which dappled it here and there like splashes of whipped cream.  Yet, for all this, the colonel was ill-at-ease; and care was on his brow, and venom in his speech.  \"And one thing,\" Colonel Musgrave concluded, with decision, \"I wish distinctly understood, and that is, if she insists on having young men loafing about her--as, of course, she will--she will have to entertain them in the garden. I won't have them in the house, Agatha. You remember that Langham girl you had here last Easter?\" he added, disconsolately --\"the one who positively littered up the house with young men, and sang idiotic jingles to them at all hours of the night about the Bailey family and the correct way to spell chicken? She drove me to the verge of insanity, and I haven't a doubt that this Patricia person will be quite as obstreperous. So, please mention it to her, Agatha--casually, of course--that, in Lichfield, when one is partial to either vocal exercise or amorous daliance, the proper scene of action is the garden. I really cannot be annoyed by her.\"  \"But, Rudolph,\" his sister protested, \"you forget she is engaged to the Earl of Pevensey. An engaged girl naturally wouldn't care about meeting any young men.\"  \"H'm!\" said the colonel, drily.  Ensued a pause, during which the colonel lighted yet another cigarette.  Then, \"I have frequently observed,\" he spoke, in absent wise, \"that all young women having that peculiarly vacuous expression about the eyes--I believe there are misguided persons who describe such eyes as being 'dreamy,'--are invariably possessed of a fickle, unstable and coquettish temperament. Oh, no! You may depend upon it, Agatha, the fact that she contemplates purchasing the right to support a peculiarly disreputable member of the British peerage will not hinder her in the least from making advances to all the young men in the neighborhood.\"  Miss Musgrave was somewhat ruffled. She was a homely little woman with nothing of the ordinary Musgrave comeliness. Candor even compels the statement that in her pudgy swarthy face there was a droll suggestion of the pug-dog.  \"I am sure,\" Miss Musgrave remonstrated, with placid dignity, \"that you know nothing whatever about her, and that the reports about the earl have probably been greatly exaggerated, and that her picture shows her to be an unusually attractive girl. Though it is true,\" Miss Musgrave conceded after reflection, \"that there are any number of persons in the House of Lords that I wouldn't in the least care to have in my own house, even with the front parlor all in linen as it unfortunately is. So awkward when you have company! And the Bible does bid us not to put our trust in princes, and, for my part, I never thought that photographs could be trusted, either.\"  \"Scorn not the nobly born, Agatha,\" her brother admonished her, \"nor treat with lofty scorn the well-connected. The very best people are sometimes respectable. And yet,\" he pursued, with a slight hiatus of thought, \"I should not describe her as precisely an attractive-looking girl. She seems to have a lot of hair,--if it is all her own, which it probably isn't,--and her nose is apparently straight enough, and I gather she is not absolutely deformed anywhere; but that is all I can conscientiously say in her favor. She is artificial. Her hair, now! It has a--well, you would not call it exactly a crinkle or precisely a wave, but rather somewhere between the two. Yes, I think I should describe it as a ripple. I fancy it must be rather like the reflection of a sunset in--a duck-pond, say, with a faint wind ruffling the water. For I gather that her hair is of some light shade,--induced, I haven't a doubt, by the liberal use of peroxides. And this ripple, too, Agatha, it stands to reason, must be the result of coercing nature, for I have never seen it in any other woman's hair. Moreover,\" Colonel Musgrave continued, warming somewhat to his subject, \"there is a dimple--on the right side of her mouth, immediately above it,--which speaks of the most frivolous tendencies. I dare say it comes and goes when she talks,--winks at you, so to speak, in a manner that must be simply idiotic. That foolish little cleft in her chin, too--\"  But at this point, his sister interrupted him.  \"I hadn't a notion,\" said she, \"that you had even looked at the photograph. And you seem to have it quite by heart, Rudolph,--and some people admire dimples, you know, and, at any rate, her mother had red hair, so Patricia isn't really responsible. I decided that it would be foolish to use the best mats to-night. We can save them for Sunday supper, because I am only going to have eggs and a little cold meat, and not make company of her.\"  For no apparent reason, Rudolph Musgrave flushed.  \"I inspected it--quite casually--last night. Please don't be absurd, Agatha! If we were threatened with any other direful visitation --influenza, say, or the seventeen-year locust,--I should naturally read up on the subject in order to know what to expect. And since Providence has seen fit to send us a visitor rather than a visitation--though, personally, I should infinitely prefer the influenza, as interfering in less degree with my comfort,--I have, of course, neglected no opportunity of finding out what we may reasonably look forward to. I fear the worst, Agatha. For I repeat, the girl's face is, to me, absolutely unattractive!\"  The colonel spoke with emphasis, and flung away his cigarette, and took up his hat to go.  And then, \"I suppose,\" said Miss Musgrave, absently, \"you will be falling in love with her, just as you did with Anne Charteris and Aline Van Orden and all those other minxes. I _would_ like to see you married, Rudolph, only I couldn't stand your having a wife.\"  \"I! I!\" sputtered the colonel. \"I think you must be out of your head! I fall in love with that chit! Good Lord, Agatha, you are positively idiotic!\"  And the colonel turned on his heel, and walked stiffly through the garden. But, when half-way down the path, he wheeled about and came back.  \"I beg your pardon, Agatha,\" he said, contritely, \"it was not my intention to be discourteous. But somehow--somehow, dear, I don't quite see the necessity for my falling in love with anybody, so long as I have you.\"  And Miss Musgrave, you may be sure, forgave him promptly; and afterward--with a bit of pride and an infinity of love in her kind, homely face,--her eyes followed him out of the garden on his way to open the Library. And she decided in her heart that she had the dearest and best and handsomest brother in the universe, and that she must remember to tell him, accidentally, how becoming his new hat was.
