He decided that she had really beautiful eyes and hair; after she had gone he looked up at the picture, told himself that it did not begin to do her justice, and sighed a bit. He was very dull, and even her companionship, he thought, would be pleasant if only she would come down off her pedestal and be humanly sociable.  When he wrote a story about a fellow being laid up in the same house with a girl--a girl with big, blue-gray eyes and ripply brown hair--he would have the girl treat the fellow at least decently. She would read poetry to him and bring him flowers, and do ever so many nice things that would make him hate to get well. He decided that he would write just that kind of story; he would idealize it, of course, and have the fellow in love with the girl; you have to, in stories. In real life it doesn't necessarily follow that, because a fellow admires a girl's hair and eyes, and wants to be on friendly terms, he is in love with her. For example, he emphatically was not in love with Mona Stevens. He only wanted her to be decently civil and to stop holding a foolish grudge against him for not standing up and letting himself be shot full of holes because she commanded it.  In the afternoons, Mrs. Stevens would sit beside him and knit things and talk to him in a pleasantly garrulous fashion, and he would lie and listen to her--and to Mona, singing somewhere. Mona sang very well, he thought; he wondered if she had ever had any training. Also, he wished he dared ask her not to sing that song about “She's only a bird in a gilded cage.” It brought back too vividly the nights when he and Bob stood guard under the quiet stars.  And then one day he hobbled out into the dining-room and ate dinner with the family. Since he sat opposite Mona she was obliged to look at him occasionally, whether she would or no. Thurston had a strain of obstinacy in his nature, and when he decided that Mona should not only look at him, but should talk to him as well, he set himself diligently to attain that end. He was not the man to sit down supinely and let a girl calmly ignore him; so Mona presently found herself talking to him with some degree of cordiality; and what is more to the point, listening to him when he talked. It is probable that Thurston never had tried so hard in his life to win a girl's attention.  It was while he was still hobbling with a cane and taxing his imagination daily to invent excuses for remaining, that Lauman, the sheriff, rode up to the door with a deputy and asked shelter for themselves and the two Wagners, who glowered sullenly down from their weary horses. When they had been safely disposed in Thurston's bedroom, with one of the ranch hands detailed to guard them, Lauman and his man gave themselves up to the joy of a good meal. Their own cooking, they said, got mighty tame especially when they hadn't much to cook and dared not have a fire.  They had come upon the outlaws by mere accident, and it is hard telling which was the most surprised. But Lauman was, perhaps, the quickest man with a gun in Valley County, else he would not have been serving his fourth term as sheriff. He got the drop and kept it while his deputy did the rest. It had been a hard chase, he said, and a long one if you counted time instead of miles. But he had them now, harmless as rattlers with their fangs fresh drawn. He wanted to get them to Glasgow before people got to hear of their capture; he thought they wouldn't be any too safe if the boys knew he had them.  If he had known that the Lazy Eight roundup had just pulled in to the home ranch that afternoon, and that Dick Farney, one of the Stevens men, had slipped out to the corral and saddled his swiftest horse, it is quite possible that Lauman would not have lingered so long over his supper, or drank his third cup of coffee--with real cream in it--with so great a relish. And if he had known that the Circle Bar boys were camped just three miles away within hailing distance of the Lazy Eight trail, he would doubtless have postponed his after-supper smoke.  He was sitting, revolver in hand, watching the Wagners give a practical demonstration of the extent of their appetites, when Thurston limped in from the porch, his eyes darker than usual. “There are a lot of riders coming, Mr. Lauman,” he announced quietly. “It sounds like a whole roundup. I thought you ought to know.”  The prisoners went white, and put down knife and fork. If they had never feared before, plainly they were afraid then.  Lauman's face did not in the least change. “Put the hand-cuffs on, Waller,” he said. “If you've got a room that ain't easy to get at from the outside, Mrs. Stevens, I guess I'll have to ask yuh for the use of it.”  Mrs. Stevens had lived long in Valley County, and had learned how to meet emergencies. “Put 'em right down cellar,” she invited briskly. “There's just the trap-door into it, and the windows ain't big enough for a cat to go through. Mona, get a candle for Mr. Lauman.” She turned to hurry the girl, and found Mona at her elbow with a light.  “That's the kind uh woman I like to have around,” Lauman chuckled. “Come on, boys; hustle down there if yuh want to see Glasgow again.”  Trembling, all their dare-devil courage sapped from them by the menace of Thurston's words, they stumbled down the steep stairs, and the darkness swallowed them. Lauman beckoned to his deputy.  “You go with 'em, Waller,” he ordered. “If anybody but me offers to lift this trap, shoot. Don't yuh take any chances. Blow out that candle soon as you're located.”  It was then that fifty riders clattered into the yard and up to the front door, grouping in a way that left no exit unseen. Thurston, standing in the doorway, knew them almost to a man. Lazy Eight boys, they were; men who night after night had spread their blankets under the tent-roof with him and with Bob MacGregor; Bob, who lay silently out on the hill back of the home ranch-house, waiting for the last, great round-up. They glanced at him in mute greeting and dismounted without a word. With them mingled the Circle Bar boys, as silent and grim as their fellows. Lauman came up and peered into the dusk; Thurston observed that he carried his Winchester unobtrusively in one hand.  “Why, hello, boys,” he greeted cheerfully. But for the rifle you never would have guessed he knew their errand.  “Hello, Lauman,” answered Park, matching him for cheerfulness. Then:  “We rode over to hang them Wagners.” Lauman grinned. “I hate to disappoint yuh, Park, but I've kinda set my heart on doing that little job myself. I'm the one that caught 'em, and if you'd followed my trail the last month you'd say I earned the privilege.”  “Maybe so,” Park admitted pleasantly, “but we've got a little personal matter to settle up with those jaspers. Bob MacGregor was one of us, yuh remember.”  “I'll hang 'em just as dead as you can,” Lauman argued.  “But yuh won't do it so quick,” Park lashed back. “They're spoiling the air every breath they draw. We want 'em, and I guess that pretty near settles it.”  “Not by a damn sight it don't! I've never had a man took away from me yet, boys, and I've been your sheriff a good many years. You hike right back to camp; yuh can't have 'em.”  Thurston could scarcely realize the deadliness of their purpose. He knew them for kind-hearted, laughter-loving young fellows, who would give their last dollar to a friend. He could not believe that they would resort to violence now. Besides, this was not his idea of a mob; he had fancied they would howl threats and wave bludgeons, as they did in stories. Mobs always “howled and seethed with passion” at one's doors; they did not stand about and talk quietly as though the subject was trivial and did not greatly concern them.  But the men were pressing closer, and their very calmness, had he known it, was ominous. Lauman shifted his rifle ready for instant aim.  “Boys, look here,” he began more gravely, “I can't say I blame yuh, looking at it from your view-point. If you'd caught these men when yuh was out hunting 'em, you could uh strung 'em up--and I'd likely uh had business somewhere else about that time. But yuh didn't catch 'em; yuh give up the chase and left 'em to me. And yuh got to remember that I'm the one that brought 'em in. They're in my care. I'm sworn to protect 'em and turn 'em over to the law--and it ain't a question uh whether they deserve it or not. That's what I'm paid for, and I expect to go right ahead according to orders and hang 'em by law. You can't have 'em--unless yuh lay me out first, and I don't reckon any of yuh would go that far.”  “There's never been a man hung by law in this county yet,” a voice cried angrily and impatiently.  “That ain't saying there never will be,” Lauman flung back. “Don't yuh worry, they'll get all that's coming to them, all right.”  “How about the time yuh had 'em in your rotten old jail, and let 'em get out and run loose around the country, killing off white men?” drawled another-a Circle-Bar man.  “Now boys.”  A hand--the hand of him who had stood guard over the Wagners in the bedroom during supper--reached out through the doorway and caught his rifle arm. Taken unawares from behind, he whirled and then went down under the weight of men used to “wrassling” calves. Even old Lauman was no match for them, and presently he found himself stretched upon the porch with three Lazy Eight boys sitting on his person; which, being inclined to portliness, he found very uncomfortable.  Moved by an impulse he had no name for, Thurston snatched the sheriff's revolver from its scabbard. As the heap squirmed pantingly upon the porch he stepped into the doorway to avoid being tripped, which was the wisest move he could have made, for it put him in the shadow--and there were men of the Circle Bar whose trigger-finger would not have hesitated, just then, had he been in plain sight and had they known his purpose.  “Just hold on there, boys,” he called, and they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10142"],["title","Maezli: A Story of the Swiss Valleys (#0)"],["body","A STORY OF THE SWISS VALLEYS  BY  JOHANNA SPYRI  AUTHOR OF \"HEIDI, CORNELLI\", ETC.  TRANSLATED BY  ELISABETH P. STORK  1921    FOREWORD   The present story is the third by Madame Spyri to appear in this series. For many years the author was known almost entirely for her Alpine classic, \"Heidi\". The publication of a second story, \"Cornelli\", during the past year was so favorably received as to assure success for a further venture.  \"Mäzli\" may be pronounced the most natural and one of the most entertaining of Madame Spyri's creations. The atmosphere is created by an old Swiss castle and by the romantic associations of the noble family who lived there. Plot interest is supplied in abundance by the children of the Bergmann family with varying characters and interests. A more charming group of young people and a more wise and affectionate mother would be hard to find. Every figure is individual and true to life, with his or her special virtues and foibles, so that any grown person who picks up the volume will find it a world in miniature and will watch eagerly for the special characteristics of each child to reappear. Naturalness, generosity, and forbearance are shown throughout not by precept but by example. The story is at once entertaining, healthy, and, in the best sense of a word often misused, sweet. Insipid books do no one any good, but few readers of whatever age they may be will fail to enjoy and be the better for Mäzli.  It may save trouble to give here a summary of the Bergmann household. The mother is sometimes called Mrs. Rector, on account of her being the widow of a former rector of the parish, and sometimes Mrs. Maxa, to avoid confusion with the wife of the present rector. It is as if there were two Mrs. John Smiths, one of whom is called Mrs. Helen; Maxa being, of course, a feminine Christian name. Of the five children the eldest is the high-spirited, impulsive Bruno, who is just of an age to go away to a city school. Next comes his sister Mea, whose fault is that she is too submissive and confiding. Kurt, the second boy, is the most enterprising and humorous of the family; whereas, Lippo, another boy, is the soul of obedience and formality. Most original of all is Mäzli, probably not over six, as she is too young to go to school.  The writer of this preface knows of one family--not his own, either--which is waiting eagerly for another book by the author of \"Heidi\" and \"Cornelli.\" To this and all families desirous of a story full of genuine fun and genuine feeling the present volume may be recommended without qualification.

She went with folded hands from one bed to the other.  Before following her brother she wanted to see exactly what the Knight looked like.  He shook the little girl's hand with all his might.  \"Can you guess why I am taking you up there?\"  A head was raised up and two sharp eyes were directed towards her.  It seemed to crown all the preceding pleasures to roam without restraint in the woods and meadows.    CHAPTER I  IN NOLLA  For nearly twenty years the fine old castle had stood silent and deserted on the mountain-side. In its neighborhood not a sound could be heard except the twittering of the birds and the soughing of the old pine-trees. On bright summer evenings the swallows whizzed as before about the corner gables, but no more merry eyes looked down from the balconies to the green meadows and richly laden apple trees in the valley.  But just now two merry eyes were searchingly raised to the castle from the meadow below, as if they might discover something extraordinary behind the fast-closed shutters.  \"Mea, come quick,\" the young spy exclaimed excitedly, \"look! Now it's opening.\" Mea, who was sitting on the bench under the large apple tree, with a book, put aside the volume and came running.  \"Look, look! Now it's moving,\" her brother continued with growing suspense. \"It's the arm of a black coat; wait, soon the whole shutter will be opened.\"  At this moment a black object lifted itself and soared up to the tower.  \"It was only a bird, a large black-bird,\" said the disappointed Mea. \"You have called me at least twenty times already; every time you think that the shutters will open, and they never do. You can call as often as you please from now on, I shall certainly not come again.\"  \"I know they will open some day,\" the boy asserted firmly, \"only we can't tell just when; but it might be any time. If only stiff old Trius would answer the questions we ask him! He knows everything that is going on up there. But the old crosspatch never says a word when one comes near him to talk; all he does is to come along with his big stick. He naturally doesn't want anybody to know what is happening up there, but everybody in school knows that a ghost wanders about and sighs through the pine trees.\"  \"Mother has said more than once that nothing is going on there at all. She doesn't want you to talk about the ghost with the school-children, and she has asked you not to try to find out what they know about it. You know, too, that mother wants you to call the castle watchman Mr. Trius and not just Trius.\"  \"Oh, yes, I'll call him Mr. Trius, but I'll make up such a song about him that everybody will know who it is about,\" Kurt said threateningly.  \"How can he help it when there is no ghost in Wildenstein about which he could tell you tales,\" Mea remarked.  \"Oh, he has enough to tell,\" Kurt eagerly continued. \"Many wonderful things must have happened in a castle that is a thousand years old. He knows them all and could tell us, but his only answer to every question is a beating. You know, Mea, that I do not believe in ghosts or spirits. But it is so exciting to imagine that an old, old Baron of Wallerstätten might wander around the battlements in his armor. I love to imagine him standing under the old pine trees with wild eyes and threatening gestures. I love to think of fighting him, or telling him that I am not afraid.\"  \"Oh, yes, I am sure you would run away if the armoured knight with his wild eyes should come nearer,\" said Mea. \"It is never hard to be brave when one is as far away from danger as you are now.\"  \"Oho! so you think I would be afraid of a ghost,\" Kurt exclaimed laughing. \"I am sure that the ghost would rather run away from me if I shouted at him very loudly. I shall make a song about him soon and then we'll go up and sing it for him. All my school friends want to go with me; Max, Hans and Clevi, his sister. You must come, too, Mea, and then you'll see how the ghost will sneak away as soon as we scream at him and sing awfully loud.\"  \"But, Kurt, how can a ghost, which doesn't exist, sneak away?\" Mea exclaimed. \"With all your wild ideas about fighting, you seem to really believe that there is a ghost in Wildenstein.\"  \"You must understand, Mea, that this is only to prove that there is none,\" Kurt eagerly went on. \"A real ghost could rush towards us, mad with rage, if we challenged him that way. You will see what happens. It will be a great triumph for me to prove to all the school and the village people that there is no restless ghost who wanders around Wildenstein.\"  \"No, I shan't see it, because I won't come. Mother does not want us to have anything to do with this story, you know that, Kurt! Oh, here comes Elvira! I must speak to her.\"  With these words Mea suddenly flew down the mountainside. A girl of her own age was slowly coming up the incline. It was hard to tell if this measured walk was natural to her or was necessary to preserve the beautiful red and blue flowers on her little hat, which were not able to stand much commotion. It was clearly evident, however, that the approaching girl had no intention of changing her pace, despite the fact that she must have noticed long ago the friend who was hurrying towards her.  \"She certainly could move her proud stilts a little quicker when she sees how Mea is running,\" Kurt said angrily. \"Mea shouldn't do it. Oh, well, I shall make a song about Elvira that she won't ever forget.\"  Kurt now ran away, too, but in the opposite direction, where he had discovered his mother. She was standing before a rose bush from which she was cutting faded blossoms and twigs. Kurt was glad to find his mother busy with work which did not occupy her thoughts, as he often longed for such an opportunity without success. Whenever he was eager to discuss his special problems thoroughly and without being interrupted, his young brother and sister were sure to intrude with their questions, or the two elder children needed her advice at the same moment. So Kurt rushed into the garden to take advantage of this unusual opportunity. But today again he was not destined to have his object fulfilled. Before he reached his mother, a woman approached her from the other side, and both entered immediately into a lively conversation. If it had been somebody else than his special old friend Mrs. Apollonie, Kurt would have felt very angry indeed. But this woman had gained great distinction in Kurt's eyes by being well acquainted with the old caretaker of the castle; so he always had a hope of hearing from her many things that were happening there.  To his great satisfaction he heard Mrs. Apollonie say on his approach: \"No, no, Mrs. Rector, old Trius does not open any windows in vain; he has not opened any for nearly twenty years.\"  \"He might want to wipe away the dust for once in his life; it's about time,\" Kurt's mother replied. \"I don't believe the master has returned.\"  \"Why should the tower windows, where the master"]]]
