By the time it was dark the big room was full of outlaws and Mexicans, most of whom were engaged at monte. These gamblers, especially the Mexicans, were intense and quiet. The noise in the place came from the drinkers, the loungers. Duane had seen gambling-resorts--some of the famous ones in San Antonio and El Paso, a few in border towns where license went unchecked. But this place of Jackrabbit Benson's impressed him as one where guns and knives were accessories to the game. To his perhaps rather distinguishing eye the most prominent thing about the gamesters appeared to be their weapons. On several of the tables were piles of silver--Mexican pesos--as large and high as the crown of his hat. There were also piles of gold and silver in United States coin. Duane needed no experienced eyes to see that betting was heavy and that heavy sums exchanged hands. The Mexicans showed a sterner obsession, an intenser passion. Some of the Americans staked freely, nonchalantly, as befitted men to whom money was nothing. These latter were manifestly winning, for there were brother outlaws there who wagered coin with grudging, sullen, greedy eyes. Boisterous talk and laughter among the drinking men drowned, except at intervals, the low, brief talk of the gamblers. The clink of coin sounded incessantly; sometimes just low, steady musical rings; and again, when a pile was tumbled quickly, there was a silvery crash. Here an outlaw pounded on a table with the butt of his gun; there another noisily palmed a roll of dollars while he studied his opponent's face. The noises, however, in Benson's den did not contribute to any extent to the sinister aspect of the place. That seemed to come from the grim and reckless faces, from the bent, intent heads, from the dark lights and shades. There were bright lights, but these served only to make the shadows. And in the shadows lurked unrestrained lust of gain, a spirit ruthless and reckless, a something at once suggesting lawlessness, theft, murder, and hell.  “Bland's not here to-night,” Euchre was saying. “He left today on one of his trips, takin' Alloway an' some others. But his other man, Rugg, he's here. See him standin' with them three fellers, all close to Benson. Rugg's the little bow-legged man with the half of his face shot off. He's one-eyed. But he can shore see out of the one he's got. An', darn me! there's Hardin. You know him? He's got an outlaw gang as big as Bland's. Hardin is standin' next to Benson. See how quiet an' unassumin' he looks. Yes, thet's Hardin. He comes here once in a while to see Bland. They're friends, which's shore strange. Do you see thet greaser there--the one with gold an' lace on his sombrero? Thet's Manuel, a Mexican bandit. He's a great gambler. Comes here often to drop his coin. Next to him is Bill Marr--the feller with the bandana round his head. Bill rode in the other day with some fresh bullet-holes. He's been shot more'n any feller I ever heard of. He's full of lead. Funny, because Bill's no troublehunter, an', like me, he'd rather run than shoot. But he's the best rustler Bland's got--a grand rider, an' a wonder with cattle. An' see the tow-headed youngster. Thet's Kid Fuller, the kid of Bland's gang. Fuller has hit the pace hard, an' he won't last the year out on the border. He killed his sweetheart's father, got run out of Staceytown, took to stealin' hosses. An' next he's here with Bland. Another boy gone wrong, an' now shore a hard nut.”  Euchre went on calling Duane's attention to other men, just as he happened to glance over them. Any one of them would have been a marked man in a respectable crowd. Here each took his place with more or less distinction, according to the record of his past wild prowess and his present possibilities. Duane, realizing that he was tolerated there, received in careless friendly spirit by this terrible class of outcasts, experienced a feeling of revulsion that amounted almost to horror. Was his being there not an ugly dream? What had he in common with such ruffians? Then in a flash of memory came the painful proof--he was a criminal in sight of Texas law; he, too, was an outcast.  For the moment Duane was wrapped up in painful reflections; but Euchre's heavy hand, clapping with a warning hold on his arm, brought him back to outside things.  The hum of voices, the clink of coin, the loud laughter had ceased. There was a silence that manifestly had followed some unusual word or action sufficient to still the room. It was broken by a harsh curse and the scrape of a bench on the floor. Some man had risen.  “You stacked the cards, you--!”  “Say that twice,” another voice replied, so different in its cool, ominous tone from the other.  “I'll say it twice,” returned the first gamester, in hot haste. “I'll say it three times. I'll whistle it. Are you deaf? You light-fingered gent! You stacked the cards!”  Silence ensued, deeper than before, pregnant with meaning. For all that Duane saw, not an outlaw moved for a full moment. Then suddenly the room was full of disorder as men rose and ran and dived everywhere.  “Run or duck!” yelled Euchre, close to Duane's ear. With that he dashed for the door. Duane leaped after him. They ran into a jostling mob. Heavy gun-shots and hoarse yells hurried the crowd Duane was with pell-mell out into the darkness. There they all halted, and several peeped in at the door.  “Who was the Kid callin'?” asked one outlaw.  “Bud Marsh,” replied another.  “I reckon them fust shots was Bud's. Adios Kid. It was comin' to him,”  went on yet another.  “How many shots?”  “Three or four, I counted.”  “Three heavy an' one light. Thet light one was the Kid's.38. Listen! There's the Kid hollerin' now. He ain't cashed, anyway.”  At this juncture most of the outlaws began to file back into the room. Duane thought he had seen and heard enough in Benson's den for one night and he started slowly down the walk. Presently Euchre caught up with him.  “Nobody hurt much, which's shore some strange,” he said. “The Kid--young Fuller thet I was tellin' you about--he was drinkin' an' losin'. Lost his nut, too, callin' Bud Marsh thet way. Bud's as straight at cards as any of 'em. Somebody grabbed Bud, who shot into the roof. An' Fuller's arm was knocked up. He only hit a greaser.”    CHAPTER VI  Next morning Duane found that a moody and despondent spell had fastened on him. Wishing to be alone, he went out and walked a trail leading round the river bluff. He thought and thought. After a while he made out that the trouble with him probably was that he could not resign himself to his fate. He abhorred the possibility chance seemed to hold in store for him. He could not believe there was no hope. But what to do appeared beyond his power to tell.  Duane had intelligence and keenness enough to see his peril--the danger threatening his character as a man, just as much as that which threatened his life. He cared vastly more, he discovered, for what he considered honor and integrity than he did for life. He saw that it was bad for him to be alone. But, it appeared, lonely months and perhaps years inevitably must be his. Another thing puzzled him. In the bright light of day he could not recall the state of mind that was his at twilight or dusk or in the dark night. By day these visitations became to him what they really were--phantoms of his conscience. He could dismiss the thought of them then. He could scarcely remember or believe that this strange feat of fancy or imagination had troubled him, pained him, made him sleepless and sick.  That morning Duane spent an unhappy hour wrestling decision out of the unstable condition of his mind. But at length he determined to create interest in all that he came across and so forget himself as much as possible. He had an opportunity now to see just what the outlaw's life really was. He meant to force himself to be curious, sympathetic, clear-sighted. And he would stay there in the valley until its possibilities had been exhausted or until circumstances sent him out upon his uncertain way.  When he returned to the shack Euchre was cooking dinner.  “Say, Buck, I've news for you,” he said; and his tone conveyed either pride in his possession of such news or pride in Duane. “Feller named Bradley rode in this mornin'. He's heard some about you. Told about the ace of spades they put over the bullet holes in thet cowpuncher Bain you plugged. Then there was a rancher shot at a water-hole twenty miles south of Wellston. Reckon you didn't do it?”  “No, I certainly did not,” replied Duane.  “Wal, you get the blame. It ain't nothin' for a feller to be saddled with gun-plays he never made. An', Buck, if you ever get famous, as seems likely, you'll be blamed for many a crime. The border'll make an outlaw an' murderer out of you. Wal, thet's enough of thet. I've more news. You're goin' to be popular.”  “Popular? What do you mean?”  “I met Bland's wife this mornin'. She seen you the other day when you rode in. She shore wants to meet you, an' so do some of the other women in camp. They always want to meet the new fellers who've just come in. It's lonesome for women here, an' they like to hear news from the towns.”  “Well, Euchre, I don't want to be impolite, but I'd rather not meet any women,” rejoined Duane.  “I was afraid you wouldn't. Don't blame you much. Women are hell. I was hopin', though, you might talk a little to thet poor lonesome kid.”  “What kid?” inquired Duane, in surprise.  “Didn't I tell you about Jennie--the girl Bland's holdin' here--the one Jackrabbit Benson had a hand in stealin'?”  “You mentioned a girl. That's all. Tell me now,” replied Duane, abruptly.  “Wal, I got it this way. Mebbe it's straight, an' mebbe it ain't. Some years ago Benson made a trip over the river to buy mescal an' other drinks. He'll sneak over there once in a while. An' as I get it he run across a gang of greasers with some gringo prisoners.

Introduction by Professor Henry Morley.  Against Foolish Talking and Jesting.  Against Rash and Vain Swearing.  Of Evil-speaking in General.  The Folly of Slander. Part 1.  The Folly of Slander. Part 2.     INTRODUCTION.    Isaac Barrow was born in London in 1630.  His father was draper to  the king.  His mother died when he was four years old.  He was named  Isaac after an uncle, who died in 1680, Bishop of St. Asaph.  Young  Isaac Barrow was educated at the Charterhouse School, and at  Felstead, before he went, in 1643, to Cambridge.  He entered first  at Peterhouse, where his uncle Isaac was a Fellow, but at that time  his uncle was ejected from his Fellowship for loyalty to the King's  cause, and removed to Oxford; the nephew, who entered at Cambridge,  therefore avoided Peterhouse, and went to Trinity College.  Young  Barrow's father also was at Oxford, where he gave up all his worldly  means in service of the King.  The young student at Cambridge did not conceal his royalist feeling,  but obtained, nevertheless, a scholarship at Trinity, with some  exemptions from the Puritan requirements of subscription.  He took  his B.A. degree in 1648, and in 1649 was elected to a fellowship of  Trinity, on the same day with his most intimate college friend John  Ray, the botanist.  Ray held in the next year several college  offices; was made in 1651 lecturer in Greek, and in 1653 lecturer in  Mathematics.  Barrow proceeded to his M.A. in 1652, and was admitted  to the same degree at Oxford in 1653.  In 1654, Dr. Dupont, who had  been tutor to Barrow and Ray, and held the University Professorship  of Greek, resigned, and used his interest, without success, to get  Barrow appointed in his place.  Isaac Barrow was then a young man of  four-and-twenty, with the courage of his opinions in politics and in  church questions, which were not the opinions of those in power.  In 1655 Barrow left Cambridge, having sold his books to raise money  for travel.  He went to Paris, where his father was with other  royalists, and gave some help to his father.  Then he went on to  Italy, made stay at Florence, and on a voyage from Leghorn to Smyrna  stood to a gun in fight with a pirate ship from Algiers that was  beaten off.  At college and upon his travels Barrow was helped by  the liberality of public spirited men who thought him worth their  aid.  He went on to Constantinople, where he studied the Greek  Fathers of the Church; and he spent more than a year in Turkey.  He  returned through Germany and Holland, reached England in the year  before the Restoration, and then, at the age of twenty-nine, he  entered holy orders, for which in all his studies he had been  preparing.  The Cambridge Greek Professorship, which had before been denied him,  was obtained by Barrow immediately after the Restoration.  Soon  afterwards he was chosen to be Professor of Geometry at Gresham  College.  In 1663 he preached the sermon in Westminster Abbey at the  consecration of his uncle, Isaac, as Bishop of St. Asaph.  In that  year also he became, at Cambridge, the first Lucasian Professor of  Mathematics, for which office he resigned his post at Gresham  College.  As Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, Isaac Barrow had among his  pupils Isaac Newton.  Newton succeeded to the chair in 1669.  Barrow  resigned because he feared that the duties of the mathematical chair  drew his thoughts too much from the duties of the pulpit, towards  the full performance of which he had desired all studies to be aids.   He was then intent upon the writing of an \"Exposition of the Creed,  Decalogue, and Sacraments.\"  He held a prebend in Salisbury  Cathedral, and a living in Wales, that yielded little for his  support after the Professorship had been resigned.  But he was one  of the King's chaplains, was made D.D. by the King in 1670, and in  1672 he was appointed Master of Trinity by Charles II., who said,  when he appointed Isaac Barrow, \"that he gave the post to the best  scholar in England.\"  Barrow was Vice-Chancellor of the University  when he died in 1677, during a visit to London on the business of  his college.  The sermons here given were first published in 1678, in a volume  entitled \"Several Sermons against Evil-speaking.\"  That volume  contained ten sermons, of which the publisher said that \"the two  last, against pragmaticalness and meddling in the affairs of others,  do not so properly belong to this subject.\"  The sermons here given  follow continuously, beginning with the second in the series.  The  text of the first sermon was \"If any man offend not in word, he is a  perfect man.\"  The texts to the last three were:  \"Speak not evil  one of another, brethren;\" \"Judge not;\" and \"That ye study to be  quiet, and to do your own business.\"  There were also published in 1678, the year after Barrow's death, a  sermon preached by him on the Good Friday before he died, a volume  of \"Twelve Sermons preached upon several Occasions,\" and the second  edition of a sermon on the \"Duty and Reward of Bounty to the Poor.\"   Barrow's works were collected by Archbishop Tillotson, and  published, in four folio volumes, in the years 1683-1687.  There  were other editions in three folios in 1716, in 1722, and in 1741.   Dr. Dibdin said of Barrow that he \"had the clearest head with which  mathematics ever endowed an individual, and one of the purest and  most unsophisticated hearts that ever beat in the human breast.\"  In  these sermons against Evil Speaking he distinguishes as clearly as  Shakespeare does between the playfulness of kindly mirth that draws  men nearer to each other and the words that make division.  No man  was more free than Isaac Barrow from the spirit of unkindness.  The  man speaks in these sermons.  Yet he could hold his own in wit with  the light triflers of the court of Charles the Second.  It is of him  that the familiar story is told of a playful match at mock courtesy  with the Earl of Rochester, who meeting Dr. Barrow near the king's  chamber bowed low, saying, \"I am yours, doctor, to the knee  strings.\"  Barrow (bowing lower), \"I am yours, my lord, to the shoe- tie.\"  Rochester:  \"Yours, doctor, down to the ground.\"  Barrow:   \"Yours, my lord, to the centre of the earth.\"  Rochester (not to be  out-done):  \"Yours, doctor, to the lowest pit of hell.\"  Barrow:   \"There, my lord, I must leave you.\"  Barrow's mathematical power gave clearness to his sermons, which  were full of sense and piety.  They were very carefully written,  copied and recopied, and now rank with the most valued pieces of the  literature of the pulpit.  He was deeply religious, although he had,  besides learning, a lively wit, and never lost the pluck that taught  him how to man a gun against a pirate.  He was \"low of stature,  lean, and of a pale complexion,\" so untidy that on one occasion his  appearance in the pulpit is said to have caused half the  congregation to go out of church.  He gave his whole mind and his  whole soul to his work for God.  Mythical tales are told of the  length of some of his sermons, at a time when an hour's sermon was  not considered long.  Of one charity-sermon the story is that it  lasted three hours and a half, and that Barrow was requested to  print it--\"with the other half which he had not had time to  deliver.\"  But we may take this tale as one of the quips at which  Barrow himself would have laughed very good-humouredly.                                              H. M.     SERMONS ON EVIL-SPEAKING.     AGAINST FOOLISH TALKING AND JESTING.    \"Nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient.\"-- Ephes. v.4.  Moral and political aphorisms are seldom couched in such terms that  they should be taken as they sound precisely, or according to the  widest extent of signification; but do commonly need exposition, and  admit exception:  otherwise frequently they would not only clash  with reason and experience, but interfere, thwart, and supplant one  another.  The best masters of such wisdom are wont to interdict  things, apt by unseasonable or excessive use to be perverted, in  general forms of speech, leaving the restrictions, which the case  may require or bear, to be made by the hearer's or interpreter's  discretion; whence many seemingly formal prohibitions are to be  received only as sober cautions.  This observation may be  particularly supposed applicable to this precept of St. Paul, which  seemeth universally to forbid a practice commended (in some cases  and degrees) by philosophers as virtuous, not disallowed by reason,  commonly affected by men, often used by wise and good persons; from  which consequently, if our religion did wholly debar us, it would  seem chargeable with somewhat too uncouth austerity and sourness:   from imputations of which kind as in its temper and frame it is  really most free (it never quenching natural light or cancelling the  dictates of sound reason, but confirming and improving them); so it  carefully declineth them, enjoining us that \"if there be any things\"  [Greek] (\"lovely,\" or grateful to men), \"any things\" [Greek] (\"of  good report\" and repute), \"if there be any virtue and any praise\"  (anything in the common apprehensions of men held worthy and  laudable), we should \"mind those things,\" that is, should yield them  a regard answerable to the esteem they carry among rational and  sober persons.  Whence it may seem requisite so to interpret and determine St.  Paul's meaning here concerning eutrapelia (that is, facetious  speech, or raillery, by our translators rendered \"jesting\"), that he  may consist with himself, and be reconciled to Aristotle, who  placeth this practice in the rank of virtues; or that religion and  reason may well accord in the case:  supposing that, if there be any  kind of facetiousness innocent and reasonable, conformable to good  manners (regulated by common sense, and consistent with the tenor of  Christian"]]]
