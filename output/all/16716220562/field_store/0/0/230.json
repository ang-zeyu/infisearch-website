For thus expounding and limiting his intent we have some warrant  from himself, some fair intimations in the words here.  For first,  what sort of facetious speech he aimeth at, he doth imply by the  fellow he coupleth therewith; [Greek], saith he, [Greek] (foolish  talking, or facetiousness):  such facetiousness therefore he  toucheth as doth include folly, in the matter or manner thereof.   Then he further determineth it, by adjoining a peculiar quality  thereof, unprofitableness, or impertinency; [Greek] (which are not  pertinent), or conducible to any good purpose:  whence may be  collected that it is a frivolous and idle sort of facetiousness  which he condemneth.  But, however, manifest it is that some kind thereof he doth  earnestly forbid:  whence, in order to the guidance of our practice,  it is needful to distinguish the kinds, severing that which is  allowable from that which is unlawful; that so we may be satisfied  in the case, and not on the one hand ignorantly transgress our duty,  nor on the other trouble ourselves with scruples, others with  censures, upon the use of warrantable liberty therein.  And such a resolution seemeth indeed especially needful in this our  age (this pleasant and jocular age) which is so infinitely addicted  to this sort of speaking, that it scarce doth affect or prize  anything near so much; all reputation appearing now to veil and  stoop to that of being a wit:  to be learned, to be wise, to be  good, are nothing in comparison thereto; even to be noble and rich  are inferior things, and afford no such glory.  Many at least (to  purchase this glory, to be deemed considerable in this faculty, and  enrolled among the wits) do not only make shipwreck of conscience,  abandon virtue, and forfeit all pretences to wisdom; but neglect  their estates, and prostitute their honour:  so to the private  damage of many particular persons, and with no small prejudice to  the public, are our times possessed and transported with this  humour.  To repress the excess and extravagance whereof, nothing in  way of discourse can serve better than a plain declaration when and  how such a practice is allowable or tolerable; when it is wicked and  vain, unworthy of a man endued with reason, and pretending to  honesty or honour.  This I shall in some measure endeavour to perform.  But first it may be demanded what the thing we speak of is, or what  this facetiousness doth import?  To which question I might reply as  Democritus did to him that asked the definition of a man, \"'Tis that  which we all see and know\":  any one better apprehends what it is by  acquaintance than I can inform him by description.  It is indeed a  thing so versatile and multiform, appearing in so many shapes, so  many postures, so many garbs, so variously apprehended by several  eyes and judgments, that it seemeth no less hard to settle a clear  and certain notion thereof, than to make a portrait of Proteus, or  to define the figure of the fleeting air.  Sometimes it lieth in pat  allusion to a known story, or in seasonable application of a trivial  saying, or in forging an apposite tale:  sometimes it playeth in  words and phrases, taking advantage from the ambiguity of their  sense, or the affinity of their sound:  sometimes it is wrapped in a  dress of humorous expression; sometimes it lurketh under an odd  similitude; sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart  answer, in a quirkish reason, in a shrewd intimation, in cunningly  diverting, or cleverly retorting an objection:  sometimes it is  couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty  hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a plausible reconciling of  contradictions, or in acute nonsense:  sometimes a scenical  representation of persons or things, a counterfeit speech, a mimical  look or gesture passeth for it:  sometimes an affected simplicity,  sometimes a presumptuous bluntness giveth it being; sometimes it  riseth from a lucky hitting upon what is strange, sometimes from a  crafty wresting obvious matter to the purpose:  often it consisteth  in one knows not what, and springeth up one can hardly tell how.   Its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the  numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language.  It is in  short, a manner of speaking out of the simple and plain way (such as  reason teacheth and proveth things by), which by a pretty surprising  uncouthness in conceit or expression doth affect and amuse the  fancy, stirring in it some wonder, and breeding some delight  thereto.  It raiseth admiration, as signifying a nimble sagacity of  apprehension, a special felicity of invention, a vivacity of spirit,  and reach of wit more than vulgar:  it seeming to argue a rare  quickness of parts, that one can fetch in remote conceits  applicable; a notable skill, that he can dexterously accommodate  them to the purpose before him; together with a lively briskness of  humour, not apt to damp those sportful flashes of imagination.   (Whence in Aristotle such persons are termed [Greek], dexterous men;  and [Greek], men of facile or versatile manners, who can easily turn  themselves to all things, or turn all things to themselves.) It also  procureth delight, by gratifying curiosity with its rareness or  semblance of difficulty (as monsters, not for their beauty, but  their rarety; as juggling tricks, not for their use, but their  abstruseness, are beheld with pleasure) by diverting the mind from  its road of serious thoughts; by instilling gaiety and airiness of  spirit; by provoking to such dispositions of spirit in way of  emulation or complaisance; and by seasoning matters, otherwise  distasteful or insipid, with an unusual, and thence grateful tang.  But saying no more concerning what it is, and leaving it to your  imagination and experience to supply the defect of such explication,  I shall address myself to show, first, when and how such a manner of  speaking may be allowed; then, in what matters and ways it should be  condemned.   1.  Such facetiousness is not absolutely unreasonable or unlawful,  which ministereth harmless divertisement, and delight to  conversation (harmless, I say, that is, not entrenching upon piety,  not infringing charity or justice, not disturbing peace).  For  Christianity is not so tetrical, so harsh, so envious, as to bar us  continually from innocent, much less from wholesome and useful  pleasure, such as human life doth need or require.  And if jocular  discourse may serve to good purposes of this kind; if it may be apt  to raise our drooping spirits, to allay our irksome cares, to whet  our blunted industry, to recreate our minds being tired and cloyed  with graver occupations; if it may breed alacrity, or maintain good  humour among us; if it may conduce to sweeten conversation and  endear society; then is it not inconvenient, or unprofitable.  If  for those ends we may use other recreations, employing on them our  ears and eyes, our hands and feet, our other instruments of sense  and motion, why may we not as well to them accommodate our organs of  speech and interior sense?  Why should those games which excite our  wits and fancies be less reasonable than those whereby our grosser  parts and faculties are exercised?  Yea, why are not those more  reasonable, since they are performed in a manly way, and have in  them a smack of reason; feeling also they may be so managed, as not  only to divert and please, but to improve and profit the mind,  rousing and quickening it, yea sometimes enlightening and  instructing it, by good sense conveyed in jocular expression?  It would surely be hard that we should be tied ever to knit the  brow, and squeeze the brain (to be always sadly dumpish, or  seriously pensive), that all divertisement of mirth and pleasantness  should be shut out of conversation; and how can we better relieve  our minds, or relax our thoughts, how can we be more ingenuously  cheerful, in what more kindly way can we exhilarate ourselves and  others, than by thus sacrificing to the Graces, as the ancients  called it?  Are not some persons always, and all persons sometimes,  incapable otherwise to divert themselves, than by such discourse?   Shall we, I say, have no recreation? or must our recreations be ever  clownish, or childish, consisting merely in rustical efforts, or in  petty sleights of bodily strength and activity?  Were we, in fine,  obliged ever to talk like philosophers, assigning dry reasons for  everything, and dropping grave sentences upon all occasions, would  it not much deaden human life, and make ordinary conversation  exceedingly to languish?  Facetiousness therefore in such cases, and  to such purposes, may be allowable.  2.  Facetiousness is allowable when it is the most proper instrument  of exposing things apparently base and vile to due contempt.  It is  many times expedient, that things really ridiculous should appear  such, that they may be sufficiently loathed and shunned; and to  render them such is the part of a facetious wit, and usually can  only be compassed thereby.  When to impugn them with down-right  reason, or to check them by serious discourse, would signify  nothing, then representing them in a shape strangely ugly to the  fancy, and thereby raising derision at them, may effectually  discountenance them.  Thus did the prophet Elias expose the wicked  superstition of those who worshipped Baal:  \"Elias (saith the text)  mocked them, and said, 'Cry aloud; for he is a god, either he is  talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure  he sleeps, and must be awaked.'\"  By which one pregnant instance it  appeareth that reasoning pleasantly-abusive in some cases may be  useful.  The Holy Scripture doth not indeed use it frequently (it  not suiting the Divine simplicity and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10274"],["title","Sermons on Evil-Speaking (#2)"],["body","gravity thereof to do  so); yet its condescension thereto at any time sufficiently doth  authorise a cautious use thereof.  When sarcastic twitches are  needful to pierce the thick skins of men, to correct their lethargic  stupidity, to rouse them out of their drowsy negligence, then may  they well be applied when plain declarations will not enlighten  people to discern the truth and weight of things, and blunt  arguments will not penetrate to convince or persuade them to their  duty, then doth reason freely resign its place to wit, allowing it  to undertake its work of instruction and reproof.  3.  Facetious discourse particularly may be commodious for reproving  some vices, and reclaiming some persons (as salt for cleansing and  curing some sores).  It commonly procureth a more easy access to the  ears of men, and worketh a stronger impression on their hearts, than  other discourse could do.  Many who will not stand a direct reproof,  and cannot abide to be plainly admonished of their fault, will yet  endure to be pleasantly rubbed, and will patiently bear a jocund  wipe; though they abominate all language purely bitter or sour, yet  they can relish discourse having in it a pleasant tartness.  You  must not chide them as their master, but you may gibe with them as  their companion.  If you do that, they will take you for pragmatical  and haughty; this they may interpret friendship and freedom.  Most  men are of that temper; and particularly the genius of divers  persons, whose opinions and practices we should strive to correct,  doth require not a grave and severe, but a free and merry way of  treating them.  For what can be more unsuitable and unpromising,  than to seem serious with those who are not so themselves, or demure  with the scornful?  If we design either to please or vex them into  better manners, we must be as sportful in a manner, or as  contemptuous as themselves.  If we mean to be heard by them, we must  talk in their own fashion, with humour and jollity; if we will  instruct them, we must withal somewhat divert them:  we must seem to  play with them if we think to convey any sober thoughts into them.   They scorn to be formally advised or taught; but they may perhaps be  slily laughed and lured into a better mind.  If by such complaisance  we can inveigle those dottrels to hearken to us, we may induce them  to consider farther, and give reason some competent scope, some fair  play with them.  Good reason may be apparelled in the garb of wit,  and therein will securely pass whither in its native homeliness it  could never arrive:  and being come thither, it with especial  advantage may impress good advice, making an offender more clearly  to see, and more deeply to feel his miscarriage; being represented  to his fancy in a strain somewhat rare and remarkable, yet not so  fierce and frightful.  The severity of reproof is tempered, and the  reprover's anger disguised thereby.  The guilty person cannot but  observe that he who thus reprehends him is not disturbed or out of  humour, and that he rather pitieth than hateth him; which breedeth a  veneration to him, and imparteth no small efficacy to his wholesome  suggestions.  Such a reprehension, while it forceth a smile without,  doth work remorse within; while it seemeth to tickle the ear, doth  sting the heart.  In fine, many whose foreheads are brazed and  hearts steeled against all blame, are yet not of proof against  derision; divers, who never will be reasoned, may be rallied in  better order:  in which cases raillery, as an instrument of so  important good, as a servant of the best charity, may be allowed.  4.  Some errors likewise in this way may be most properly and most  successfully confuted; such as deserve not, and hardly can bear a  serious and solid confutation.  He that will contest things  apparently decided by sense and experience, or who disavows clear  principles of reason, approved by general consent and the common  sense of men, what other hopeful way is there of proceeding with  him, than pleasantly to explode his conceits?  To dispute seriously  with him were trifling; to trifle with him is the proper course.   Since he rejecteth the grounds of reasoning, 'tis vain to be in  earnest; what then remains but to jest with him?  To deal seriously  were to yield too much respect to such a baffler, and too much  weight to his fancies; to raise the man too high in his courage and  conceit; to make his pretences seem worthy the considering and  canvassing.  Briefly, perverse obstinacy is more easily quelled,  petulant impudence is sooner dashed, sophistical captiousness is  more safely eluded, sceptical wantonness is more surely confounded  in this than in the simple way of discourse.  5.  This way is also commonly the best way of defence against unjust  reproach and obloquy.  To yield to a slanderous reviler a serious  reply, or to make a formal plea against his charge, doth seem to  imply that we much consider or deeply resent it; whereas by pleasant  reflection on it we signify the matter only deserves contempt, and  that we take ourselves unconcerned therein.  So easily without care  or trouble may the brunts of malice be declined or repelled.  6.  This may be allowed in way of counterbalancing and in compliance  to the fashion of others.  It would be a disadvantage unto truth and  virtue if their defenders were barred from the use of this weapon,  since it is that especially whereby the patrons of error and vice do  maintain and propagate them.  They being destitute of good reason,  do usually recommend their absurd and pestilent notions by a  pleasantness of conceit and expression, bewitching the fancies of  shallow hearers, and inveigling heedless persons to a liking of  them; and if, for reclaiming such people, the folly of those  seducers may in like manner be displayed as ridiculous and odious,  why should that advantage be refused?  It is wit that wageth the war  against reason, against virtue, against religion; wit alone it is  that perverteth so many, and so greatly corrupteth the world.  It  may, therefore, be needful, in our warfare for those dearest  concerns, to sort the manner of our fighting with that of our  adversaries, and with the same kind of arms to protect goodness,  whereby they do assail it.  If wit may happily serve under the  banner of truth and virtue, we may impress it for that service; and  good it were to rescue so worthy a faculty from so vile abuse.  It  is the right of reason and piety to command that and all other  endowments; folly and impiety do only usurp them.  Just and fit  therefore it is to wrest them out of so bad hands, to revoke them to  their right use and duty.  It doth especially seem requisite to do it in this age, wherein  plain reason is deemed a dull and heavy thing.  When the mental  appetite of men is become like the corporal, and cannot relish any  food without some piquant sauce, so that people will rather starve  than live on solid fare; when substantial and sound discourse  findeth small attention or acceptance; in such a time, he that can,  may in complaisance, and for fashion's sake, vouchsafe to be  facetious; an ingenious vein coupled with an honest mind may be a  good talent; he shall employ wit commendably who by it can further  the interests of goodness, alluring men first to listen, then  inducing them to consent unto its wholesome dictates and precepts.  Since men are so irreclaimably disposed to mirth and laughter, it  may be well to set them in the right pin, to divert their humour  into the proper channel, that they may please themselves in deriding  things which deserve it, ceasing to laugh at that which requireth  reverence or horror.  It may also be expedient to put the world out of conceit that all  sober and good men are a sort of such lumpish or sour people that  they can utter nothing but flat and drowsy stuff, by showing them  that such persons, when they see cause, in condescension, can be as  brisk and smart as themselves; when they please, can speak  pleasantly and wittily, as well as gravely and judiciously.  This  way at least, in respect to the various palates of men, may for  variety sake be sometimes attempted, when other means do fail; when  many strict and subtle arguings, many zealous declamations, many  wholesome serious discourses have been spent, without effecting the  extirpation of bad principles, or conversion of those who abet them;  this course may be tried, and some perhaps may be reclaimed thereby.  7.  Furthermore, the warrantableness of this practice in some cases  may be inferred from a parity of reason, in this manner.  If it be  lawful (as by the best authorities it plainly doth appear to be), in  using rhetorical schemes, poetical strains, involutions of sense in  allegories, fables, parables, and riddles, to discoast from the  plain and simple way of speech, why may not facetiousness, issuing  from the same principles, directed to the same ends, serving to like  purposes, be likewise used blamelessly?  If those exorbitancies of  speech may be accommodated to instill good doctrine into the head,  to excite good passions in the heart, to illustrate and adorn the  truth, in a delightful and taking way, and facetious discourse be  sometimes notoriously conducible to the same ends, why, they being  retained, should it be rejected, especially considering how  difficult often it may be to distinguish those forms of discourse  from this, or exactly to define the limits which sever rhetoric and  raillery.  Some elegant figures and trophies of rhetoric (biting  sarcasms, sly ironies, strong metaphors, lofty hyperboles,  paronomasies, oxymorons, and the like, frequently used by the best  speakers, and not seldom even by sacred writers) do lie very near  upon the confines of jocularity, and are not easily differenced from  those sallies of wit wherein the lepid way doth consist:  so that  were this wholly culpable, it would be"]]]
