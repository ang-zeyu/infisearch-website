I thought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate this warm day. A friend brought it from Paris, and it's like one the Princess of Wales wore at the great flower-show this year,\" returned Kitty, with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses from Paris, and was intimately acquainted with the royal family.  \"Those girls\" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn't a word to say for themselves, while Kitty casually mentioned Horace Fletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for _they_ had only a little Freshman brother to boast of, and were _not_ going to Lyceum Hall.  As she stepped out of the cars at Cambridge, Jack opened his honest blue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment: for if there was anything he especially hated, it was the trains, chignons and tiny bonnets then in fashion. He was very fond of Kitty, and prided himself on being able to show his friends a girl who was charming, and yet not over-dressed.  \"She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and the dear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss and feathers. But I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn that pretty hat of hers.\"  As this thought passed through Jack's mind he smiled and bowed and made his way among the crowd, whispering as he drew his cousin's arm through his own,--  \"Why, Kitty, you're got up regardless of expense, aren't you? I'm so glad you came, we'll have a rousing good time, and you shall see all the fun.\"  \"Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a credit to you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laugh over it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!\" and Kitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to make her cup overflow. That one thing was speedily vouchsafed, for before her skirts were smoothly settled, Jack called out, in his hearty way,--  \"How are you, Fletcher? If you are bound for Chapel I'll take you up.\"  \"Thanks; good-morning, Miss Heath.\"  It was all done in an instant, and the next thing Kitty knew she was rolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How little it takes to make a young girl happy! A pretty dress, sunshine, and somebody opposite, and they are blest. Kitty's face glowed and dimpled with pleasure as she glanced about her, especially when _she_, sitting in state with two gentlemen all to herself, passed \"those girls\" walking in the dust with a beardless boy; she felt that she could forgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow.  Both Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still took an interest in their old haunts, and patronized the fellows who were not yet through the mill, at least the Seniors and Juniors; of Sophs and Freshs they were sublimely unconscious. Greeted by frequent slaps on the shoulder, and hearty \"How are you, old fellows,\" they piloted Kitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl's satisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not see anything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet to whom he devoted himself, \"because she was a stranger,\" Kitty said.  Everybody knows what goes on in the Chapel, after the fight and scramble are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and the poem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professors yawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Then the closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.  Then the fun really begins, as far as the young folks are concerned. _They_ don't mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx; they can enjoy half a dozen courses of salad, ice and strawberries, with stout gentlemen crushing their feet, anxious mammas sticking sharp elbows into their sides, and absent-minded tutors walking over them. They can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner, dust, and din; can smile with hot coffee running down their backs, small avalanches of ice-cream descending upon their best bonnets, and sandwiches, butter-side down, reposing on their delicate silks. They know that it is a costly rapture, but they carefully refrain from thinking of the morrow, and energetically illustrate the Yankee maxim which bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom.  Kitty did have \"a rousing good time;\" for Jack was devoted, taking her everywhere, showing her everything, feeding and fanning her, and festooning her train with untiring patience. How many forcible expressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky train we will not record; he smiled and skipped and talked of treading on flowers in a way that would have charmed Kitty, if some one else had not been hovering about \"The Daisy,\" as Fletcher called her.  After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and was never in the way unless she wanted him. For the first time in her life, Kitty deliberately flirted. The little coquetries, which are as natural to a gay young girl as her laughter, were all in full play, and had she gone no further no harm would have been done. But, excited by the example of those about her, Kitty tried to enact the fashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part. Quite forgetting her cousin, she tossed her head, twirled her fan, gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked college slang in a way that convulsed Fletcher, who enjoyed the fun immensely.  Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his face grew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, and breathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall, on the arm of Fletcher, who danced divinely, as all the girls agreed. Jack had proposed going, but Kitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh, blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments and admiring glances.  \"If she stands that long she's not the girl I took her for,\" thought Jack, beginning to lose patience. \"She doesn't look like my little Kitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her as usual. I know one thing, _my_ daughters shall never be seen knocking about in that style.\"  As if the thought suggested the act, Jack suddenly assumed an air of paternal authority, and, arresting his cousin as she was about to begin again, he said, in a tone she had never heard before,--  \"I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off to rest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I advise you to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet a turn.\"  Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder with such an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much like a top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. As she came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air, she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect, for a party of uninvited _peris_ stood at the gate of this Paradise casting longing glances at the forbidden splendors within. Slowly, that all might see her, Kitty sailed down, with Horace, the debonair, in her wake, and was just thinking to herself, \"Those girls won't get over this very soon, I fancy,\" when all in one moment she heard Fletcher exclaim, wrathfully, \"Hang the flounces!\" she saw a very glossy black hat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and, to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with most undignified haste.  It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there was Fletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslin loop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yet perfectly helpless, while every one tittered. Miss Jones and Miss Smith laughed shrilly, and the despised little Freshman completed her mortification, by a feeble joke about Kitty Heath's new man-trap. It was only an instant, but it seemed an hour before Fletcher freed her, and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenance and an abrupt bow.  If it hadn't been for Jack, Kitty would have burst into tears then and there, so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her. For his sake she controlled herself, and, bundling up her torn train, set her teeth, stared straight before her, and let him lead her in dead silence to a friend's room near by. There he locked the door, and began to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kitty cried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrous side of the affair struck her, and she began to laugh hysterically. With a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminine ailment, Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher over her, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently,--  \"Oh, don't!--it was so funny!--how can you laugh, you cruel boy?--I'm disgraced, forever--take me home to Pris, oh, take me home to Pris!\"  \"I will, my dear, I will; but first let me right you up a bit; you look as if you had been hazed, upon my life you do;\" and Jack laughed in spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, for dust,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10360"],["title","Kitty's Class Day and Other Stories (#2)"],["body","ng, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle.  That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face, she was about to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyes dispelled the gathering tears. The new gloves were both split up the middle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down.  \"Never mind, you can wash them,\" said Jack, soothingly.  \"I paid a dollar and a half for them, and they can't be washed,\" groaned Kitty.  \"Oh, hang the gloves! I meant your hands,\" cried Jack, trying to keep sober.  \"No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more, for my head aches now so I can hardly see.\" And Kitty threw off her bonnet, as if even that airy trifle hurt her.  Seeing how pale she looked, Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the old sofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got the good landlady to send her up a cup of tea. As Kitty rose to comply she glanced at her dress, and, clasping her hands, exclaimed, tragically,--\"The facing, the fatal facing! That made all the mischief, for if I'd sewed it last night it wouldn't have ripped to-day; if it hadn't ripped Fletcher wouldn't have got his foot in it, I shouldn't have made an object of myself, he wouldn't have gone off in a rage, and--who knows what might have happened?\"  \"Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him,\" cried Jack. \"He is a contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape he got you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him.\"  \"Well, he _was_ rather absurd to-day, I allow; but he _has_ got handsome eyes and hands, and he _does_ dance like an angel,\" sighed Kitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had brought destruction to her little castle in the air.  \"Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man. Wait till you can do better, Kit.\"  With an odd, grave look, that rather startled Kitty, Jack vanished, to return presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old lady to help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purrings and pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry.  \"I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree when you've had a bit of a rest,\" said Jack, vibrating between door and sofa as if it wasn't easy to get away.  \"Oh, I couldn't,\" cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea of meeting any one. \"I can't be seen again to-night; let me stay here till my train goes.\"  \"I thought it had gone, already,\" said Jack, with an irrepressible twinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping the floor.  \"How _can_ you joke about it!\" and the girl's reproachful eyes filled with tears of shame. \"I know I've been very silly, Jack, but I've had my punishment, and I don't need any more. To feel that you despise me is worse than all the rest.\"  She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide the trembling of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone, and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply. But, remembering the old lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking out of the window), he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out of the room.  \"I've lost them both by this day's folly,\" thought Kitty, as Mrs. Brown departed with the teacup. \"I don't care for Fletcher, for I dare say he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because he is rich and handsome and the girls glorify him. But I shall miss Jack, for I've known and loved him all my life. How good he's been to me to-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have been ashamed of me. I know he didn't like my dress; but he never said a word and stood by me through everything. Oh, I wish I'd minded Pris! then he would have respected me, at least; I wonder if he ever will, again?\"  Following a sudden impulse, Kitty sprang up, locked the door, and then proceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible. She smoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand; fastened up her pretty hair in the simple way Jack liked; gave her once cherished bonnet a spiteful shake, as she put it on, and utterly extinguished it with a big blue veil. She looped up her dress, leaving no vestige of the now hateful train, and did herself up uncompromisingly in the Quakerish gray shawl Pris had insisted on her taking for the evening. Then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction, saying, in the tone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh,--  \"Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's better than being a peacock.\"  Kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn, sitting there alone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcher would come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her; yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached, she trembled lest it should be the victim of the fatal facing. The door opened, and with a sigh of relief she saw Jack come in, bearing a pair of new gloves in one hand and a great bouquet of June roses in the other.  \"How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing than oceans of tea. You know what I like, Jack; thank you very much\" cried Kitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture.  \"And you know what I like,\" returned Jack, with an approving glance at the altered figure before him.  \"I'll never do so any more,\" murmured Kitty, wondering why she felt bashful all of a sudden, when it was only cousin Jack.  \"Now put on your gloves, dear, and come out and hear the music: your train doesn't go for two hours yet, and you mustn't mope here all that time,\" said Jack, offering his second gift.  \"How did you know my size?\" asked Kitty, putting on the gloves in a hurry; for though Jack had called her \"dear\" for years, the little word had a new sound to-night.  \"I guessed,--no, I didn't, I had the old ones with me; they are no good now, are they?\" and too honest to lie, Jack tried to speak carelessly, though he turned red in the dusk, well knowing that the dirty little gloves were folded away in his left breast-pocket at that identical moment.  \"Oh, dear, no! these fit nicely. I'm ready, if you don't mind going with such a fright,\" said Kitty, forgetting her dread of seeing people in her desire to get away from that room, because for the first time in her life she wasn't at ease with Jack.  \"I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,\" returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find \"moping\" rather pleasant.  \"You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't,\" said Kitty, softly, as she drew him away.  Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white glove resting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamed away into the summer twilight.  Something had happened to the evening and the place, for both seemed suddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest. The dingy old houses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to the contrary; the dusty walks, the trampled grass, were regular Elysian fields to them, and the music was the music of the spheres, though they found themselves \"Right in the middle of the boom, jing, jing.\" For both had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, the greatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the sharp twinge of jealousy which the sight of Kitty's flirtation with Fletcher gave him, and the delight he found in her after conduct, Jack discovered how much he loved her. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, half bitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jack would never be \"only cousin Jack\" any more. All the vanity, coquetry, selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinous sins, for now her only thought was, \"seeing these faults, he _can't_ care for me. Oh, I wish I was a better girl!\"  She did not say \"for his sake,\" but in the new humility, the ardent wish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how true her love was, and might have said with Portia,--    \"For myself alone, I would not be   Ambitious in my wish; but, for you,   I would be trebled twenty times myself;   A thousand times more fair,   Ten thousand times more rich.\"  All about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms, enjoying music, starlight, balmy winds, and all the luxuries of the season. If the band had played    \"Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life   As love's young dream--\"  it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience to a T. Being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with large families, they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things so charming to see, and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches, quite regardless of the flocks of Romeos and Juliets philandering all about them.  Under cover of a popular medley, Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing her for the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet, who was evidently making up for lost time. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke to Kitty's vanity, and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, and clung to Jack, feeling that she had never valued him half enough. She hoped he didn't hear the gossip going on at the other side of the tree near which they stood; but he did, for his hand involuntarily doubled itself up into a very dangerous-looking fist, and he darted such fiery glances at the speaker, that, if the thing had been possible. Fletcher's ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head.  \"Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about one thing,--the daisies in my bonnet _were_ real, and I _couldn't_ afford any others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get me ready I hate to have my things made fun of.\"  \"He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time,\" said Jack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcher by and by.  \"Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisies the prettiest things about your dress. Don't throw them away. I'll wear them"]]]
