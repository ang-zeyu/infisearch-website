I think  you will accept that logic as sound.  Now if I can give you proof positive, proof which you can see with  your own eyes, and handle with your own hands, and alas! often feel  but too keenly with your own feet, that the whole of the lowlands  were once beneath the sea; then will it not be certain that, somehow  or other, they must have been raised out of the sea again?  And that I propose to do in my next paper, when I speak of the  pebbles in the street.  Meanwhile I wish you to face fairly the truly grand idea, which all I  have said tends to prove true--that all the soil we see is made by  the destruction of older soils, whether soft as clay, or hard as  rock; that rain, rivers, and seas are perpetually melting and  grinding up old land, to compose new land out of it; and that it must  have been doing so, as long as rain, rivers, and seas have existed.   \"But how did the first land of all get made?\"  I can only reply:  A  natural question:  but we can only answer that, by working from the  known to the unknown.  While we are finding out how these later lands  were made and unmade, we may stumble on some hints as to how the  first primeval continents rose out of the bosom of the sea.  And thus I end this paper.  I trust it has not been intolerably dull.   But I wanted at starting to show my readers something of the right  way of finding out truth on this and perhaps on all subjects; to make  some simple appeals to your common sense; and to get you to accept  some plain rules founded on common sense, which will be of infinite  use to both you and me in my future papers.  I hope, meanwhile, that you will agree with me, that there is plenty  of geological matter to be seen and thought over in the neighbourhood  of any town.  Be sure, that wherever there is a river, even a drain; and a stone  quarry, or even a roadside bank; much more where there is a sea, or a  tidal aestuary, there is geology enough to be learnt, to explain the  greater part of the making of all the continents on the globe.    II.  THE PEBBLES IN THE STREET    If you, dear reader, dwell in any northern town, you will almost  certainly see paving courts and alleys, and sometimes--to the  discomfort of your feet--whole streets, or set up as bournestones at  corners, or laid in heaps to be broken up for road-metal, certain  round pebbles, usually dark brown or speckled gray, and exceedingly  tough and hard.  Some of them will be very large--boulders of several  feet in diameter.  If you move from town to town, from the north of  Scotland as far down as Essex on the east, or as far down as  Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton (at least) on the west, you will still  find these pebbles, but fewer and smaller as you go south.  It  matters not what the rocks and soils of the country round may be.   However much they may differ, these pebbles will be, on the whole,  the same everywhere.  But if your town be south of the valley of the Thames, you will find,  as far as I am aware, no such pebbles there.  The gravels round you  will be made up entirely of rolled chalk flints, and bits of beds  immediately above or below the chalk.  The blocks of \"Sarsden\"  sandstone--those of which Stonehenge is built--and the \"plum-pudding  stones\" which are sometimes found with them, have no kindred with the  northern pebbles.  They belong to beds above the chalk.  Now if, seeing such pebbles about your town, you inquire, like a  sensible person who wishes to understand something of the spot on  which he lives, whence they come, you will be shown either a gravel- pit or a clay-pit.  In the gravel the pebbles and boulders lie mixed  with sand, as they do in the railway cutting just south of  Shrewsbury; or in huge mounds of fine sweet earth, as they do in the  gorge of the Tay about Dunkeld, and all the way up Strathmore, where  they form long grassy mounds--tomauns as they call them in some parts  of Scotland--askers as they call them in Ireland.  These mounds, with  their sweet fresh turf rising out of heather and bog, were tenanted-- so Scottish children used to believe--by fairies.  He that was lucky  might hear inside them fairy music, and, the jingling of the fairy  horses' trappings.  But woe to him if he fell asleep upon the mound,  for he would be spirited away into fairyland for seven years, which  would seem to him but one day.  A strange fancy; yet not so strange  as the actual truth as to what these mounds are, and how they came  into their places.  Or again, you might find that your town's pebbles and boulders came  out of a pit of clay, in which they were stuck, without any order or  bedding, like plums and raisins in a pudding.  This clay goes usually  by the name of boulder-clay.  You would see such near any town in  Cheshire and Lancashire; or along Leith shore, near Edinburgh; or, to  give one more instance out of hundreds, along the coast at  Scarborough.  If you walk along the shore southward of that town, you  will see, in the gullies of the cliff, great beds of sticky clay,  stuffed full of bits of every rock between the Lake mountains and  Scarborough, from rounded pebbles of most ancient rock down to great  angular fragments of ironstone and coal.  There, as elsewhere, the  great majority of the pebbles have nothing to do with the rock on  which the clay happens to lie, but have come, some of them, from  places many miles away.  Now if we find spread over a low land pebbles composed of rocks which  are only found in certain high lands, is it not an act of common  sense to say--These pebbles have come from the highlands?  And if the  pebbles are rounded, while the rocks like them in the highlands  always break off in angular shapes, is it not, again, an act of mere  common sense to say--These pebbles were once angular, and have been  rubbed round, either in getting hither or before they started hither?  Does all this seem to you mere truism, my dear reader?  If so, I am  sincerely glad to hear it.  It was not so very long ago that such  arguments would have been considered not only no truisms, but not  even common sense.  But to return, let us take, as an example, a sample of these boulder  clay pebbles from the neighbourhood of Liverpool and Birkenhead, made  by Mr. De Rance, the government geological surveyor:  Granite, greenstone, felspar porphyry, felstone, quartz rock (all  igneous rocks, that is, either formed by, or altered by volcanic  heat, and almost all found in the Lake mountains), 37 per cent.  Silurian grits (the common stones of the Lake mountains deposited by  water), 43 per cent.  Ironstone, 1 per cent.  Carboniferous limestone, 5 per cent.  Permian or Triassic sandstones, i.e. rocks immediately round  Liverpool, 12 per cent.  Now, does not this sample show, as far as human common sense can be  depended on, that the great majority of these stones come from the  Lake mountains, sixty or seventy miles north of Liverpool?  I think  your common sense will tell you that these pebbles are not mere  concretions; that is, formed out of the substance of the clay after  it was deposited.  The least knowledge of mineralogy would prove  that.  But, even if you are no mineralogist, common sense will tell  you, that if they were all concreted out of the same clay, it is most  likely that they would be all of the same kind, and not of a dozen or  more different kinds.  Common sense will tell you, also, that if they  were all concreted out of the same clay, it is a most extraordinary  coincidence, indeed one too strange to be believed, if any less  strange explanation can be found--that they should have taken the  composition of different rocks which are found all together in one  group of mountains to the northward.  You will surely say--If this be  granite, it has most probably come from a granite mountain; if this  be grit, from a grit-stone mountain, and so on with the whole list.   Why--are we to go out of our way to seek improbable explanations,  when there is a probable one staring us in the face?  Next--and this is well worth your notice--if you will examine the  pebbles carefully, especially the larger ones, you will find that  they are not only more or less rounded, but often scratched; and  often, too, in more than one direction, two or even three sets of  scratches crossing each other; marked, as a cat marks an elder stem  when she sharpens her claws upon it; and that these scratches have  not been made by the quarrymen's tools, but are old marks which  exist--as you may easily prove for yourself--while the stone is still  lying in its bed of clay.  Would it not be an act of mere common  sense to say--These scratches have been made by the sharp points of  other stones which have rubbed against the pebbles somewhere, and  somewhen, with great force?  So far so good.  The next question is--How did these stones get into  the clay?  If we can discover that, we may also discover how they  wore rounded and scratched.  We must find a theory which will answer  our question; and one which, as Professor Huxley would say, \"will go  on all-fours,\" that is, will explain all the facts of the case, and  not only a few of them.  What, then, brought the stones?  We cannot, I think, answer that question, as some have tried to  answer it, by saying that they were brought by Noah's flood.  For it  is clear, that very violent currents of water would be needed to  carry boulders, some of them weighing many tons, for many miles.  Now  Scripture says nothing of any such violent currents; and we have no  right to put currents, or any other imagined facts, into Scripture  out of our own heads, and then argue from them as if not we, but the  text of Scripture had asserted their existence.  But still, they may have been rolled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],["title","Town Geology (#8)"],["body","by water.  That theory  certainly would explain their being rounded; though not their being  scratched.  But it will not explain their being found in the clay.  Recollect what I said in my first paper:  that water drops its  pebbles and coarser particles first, while it carries the fine clayey  mud onward in solution, and only drops it when the water becomes  still.  Now currents of such tremendous violence as to carry these  boulder stones onward, would have carried the mud for many miles  farther still; and we should find the boulders, not in clay, but  lying loose together, probably on a hard rock bottom, scoured clean  by the current.  That is what we find in the beds of streams; that is  just what we do not find in this case.  But the boulders may have been brought by a current, and then the  water may have become still, and the clay settled quietly round them.   What?  Under them as well as over them?  On that theory also we  should find them only at the bottom of the clay.  As it is, we find  them scattered anywhere and everywhere through it, from top to  bottom.  So that theory will not do.  Indeed, no theory will do which  supposes them to have been brought by water alone.  Try yourself, dear reader, and make experiments, with running water,  pebbles, and mud.  If you try for seven years, I believe, you will  never contrive to make your pebbles lie about in your mud, as they  lie about in every pit in the boulder clay.  Well then, there we are at fault, it seems.  We have no explanation  drawn from known facts which will do--unless we are to suppose, which  I don't think you will do, that stones, clay, and all were blown  hither along the surface of the ground, by primeval hurricanes, ten  times worse than those of the West Indies, which certainly will roll  a cannon a few yards, but cannot, surely, roll a boulder stone a  hundred miles.  Now, suppose that there was a force, an agent, known--luckily for  you, not to you--but known too well to sailors and travellers; a  force which is at work over the vast sheets of land at both the north  and south poles; at work, too, on every high mountain range in the  world, and therefore a very common natural force; and suppose that  this force would explain all the facts, namely--  How the stones got here;  How they were scratched and rounded;  How they were imbedded in clay;  because it is notoriously, and before men's eyes now, carrying great  stones hundreds of miles, and scratching and rounding them also;  carrying vast deposits of mud, too, and mixing up mud and stones just  as we see them in the brick-pits,--Would not our common sense have a  right to try that explanation?--to suspect that this force, which we  do not see at work in Britain now, may have been at work here ages  since?  That would at least be reasoning from the known to the  unknown.  What state of things, then, do we find among the highest  mountains; and over whole countries which, though not lofty, lie far  enough north or south to be permanently covered with ice?  We find, first, an ice-cap or ice-sheet, fed by the winter's snows,  stretching over the higher land, and crawling downward and outward by  its own weight, along the valleys, as glaciers.  We find underneath the glaciers, first a moraine profonde, consisting  of the boulders and gravel, and earth, which the glacier has ground  off the hillsides, and is carrying down with it.  These stones, of course, grind, scratch, and polish each other; and  in like wise grind, scratch, and polish the rock over which they  pass, under the enormous weight of the superincumbent ice.  We find also, issuing from under each glacier a stream, carrying the  finest mud, the result of the grinding of the boulders against each  other and the glacier.  We find, moreover, on the surface of the glaciers, moraines  superieures--long lines of stones and dirt which had fallen from  neighbouring cliffs, and are now travelling downward with the  glaciers.  Their fate, if the glacier ends on land, is what was to be expected.   The stones from above the glacier fall over the ice-cliff at its end,  to mingle with those thrown out from underneath the glacier, and form  huge banks of boulders, called terminal moraines, while the mud runs  off, as all who have seen glaciers know, in a turbid torrent.  Their fate, again, is what was to be expected if the glacier ends, as  it commonly does in Arctic regions, in the sea.  The ice grows out to  sea-ward for more than a mile sometimes, about one-eighth of it being  above water, and seven-eighths below, so that an ice-cliff one  hundred feet high may project into water eight hundred feet deep.  At  last, when it gets out of its depth, the buoyancy of the water breaks  it off in icebergs, which float away, at the mercy of tides and  currents, often grounding again in shallower water, and ploughing the  sea-bottom as they drag along it.  These bergs carry stones and dirt,  often in large quantities; so that, whenever a berg melts or  capsizes, it strews its burden confusedly about the sea-floor.  Meanwhile the fine mud which is flowing out from under the ice goes  out to sea likewise, colouring the water far out, and then subsiding  as a soft tenacious ooze, in which the stones brought out by the ice  are imbedded.  And this ooze--so those who have examined it assert-- cannot be distinguished from the brick-clay, or fossiliferous  boulder-clay, so common in the North.  A very illustrious  Scandinavian explorer, visiting Edinburgh, declared, as soon as he  saw the sections of boulder-clay exhibited near that city, that this  was the very substance which he saw forming in the Spitzbergen ice- fiords. {3}  I have put these facts as simply and baldly as I can, in order that  the reader may look steadily at them, without having his attention  drawn off, or his fancy excited, by their real poetry and grandeur.   Indeed, it would have been an impertinence to have done otherwise;  for I have never seen a live glacier, by land or sea, though I have  seen many a dead one.  And the public has had the opportunity,  lately, of reading so many delightful books about \"peaks, passes, and  glaciers,\" that I am bound to suppose that many of my readers know as  much, or more, about them than I do.  But let us go a step farther; and, bearing in our minds what live  glaciers are like, let us imagine what a dead glacier would be like;  a glacier, that is, which had melted, and left nothing but its  skeleton of stones and dirt.  We should find the faces of the rock scored and polished, generally  in lines pointing down the valleys, or at least outward from the  centre of the highlands, and polished and scored most in their upland  or weather sides.  We should find blocks of rock left behind, and  perched about on other rocks of a different kind.  We should find in  the valleys the old moraines left as vast deposits of boulder and  shingle, which would be in time sawn through and sorted over by the  rivers.  And if the sea-bottom outside were upheaved, and became dry  land, we should find on it the remains of the mud from under the  glacier, stuck full of stones and boulders iceberg-dropped.  This mud  would be often very irregularly bedded; for it would have been  disturbed by the ploughing of the icebergs, and mixed here and there  with dirt which had fallen from them.  Moreover, as the sea became  shallower and the mud-beds got awash one after the other, they would  be torn about, re-sifted, and re-shaped by currents and by tides, and  mixed with shore-sand ground out of shingle-beach, thus making  confusion worse confounded.  A few shells, of an Arctic or northern  type, would be found in it here and there.  Some would have lived  near those later beaches, some in deeper water in the ancient ooze,  wherever the iceberg had left it in peace long enough for sea-animals  to colonise and breed in it.  But the general appearance of the dried  sea-bottom would be a dreary and lifeless waste of sands, gravels,  loose boulders, and boulder-bearing clays; and wherever a boss of  bare rock still stood up, it would be found ground down, and probably  polished and scored by the ponderous icebergs which had lumbered over  it in their passage out to sea.  In a word, it would look exactly as vast tracts of the English,  Scotch, and Irish lowlands must have looked before returning  vegetation coated their dreary sands and clays with a layer of brown  vegetable soil.  Thus, and I believe thus only, can we explain the facts connected  with these boulder pebbles.  No agent known on earth can have stuck  them in the clay, save ice, which is known to do so still elsewhere.  No known agent can have scratched them as they are scratched, save  ice, which is known to do so still elsewhere.  No known agent--certainly not, in my opinion, the existing rivers-- can have accumulated the vast beds of boulders which lie along the  course of certain northern rivers; notably along the Dee about  Aboyne--save ice bearing them slowly down from the distant summits of  the Grampians.  No known agent, save ice, can have produced those rounded, and  polished, and scored, and fluted rochers moutonnes \"sheep-backed  rocks\"--so common in the Lake district; so common, too, in Snowdon,  especially between the two lakes of Llanberis; common in Kerry; to be  seen anywhere, as far as I have ascertained, around the Scotch  Highlands, where the turf is cleared away from an unweathered surface  of the rock, in the direction in which a glacier would have pressed  against it had one been there.  Where these polishings and scorings  are found in narrow glens, it is, no doubt, an open question whether  some of them may not be the work of water.  But nothing but the  action of ice can have produced what I have seen in land-locked and  quiet fords in Kerry--ice-flutings in polished rocks below high-water  mark, so large that I could lie down in one of them.  Nothing but the  action of ice"]]]
