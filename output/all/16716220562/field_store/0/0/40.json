Their sole reward must be the knowledge that they have aided somewhat in the unending work of the world.\"  Her face had altered into a pink and white penitence which was flavored with awe.  \"I--I forgot,\" she murmured, contritely; \"I--forgot you were--like him--about your genealogies, you know. Oh, Olaf, I'm very silly! Of course, it is tremendously fine and--and nice, I dare say, if you like it,--to devote your life to learning, as you and he have done. I forgot, Olaf. Still, I am sorry, somehow, for that beautiful boy,\" she ended, with a disconsolate glance at the portrait.     VII   Long after Miss Stapylton had left him, the colonel sat alone in his study, idle now, and musing vaguely. There were no more addenda concerning the descendants of Captain Thomas Osborne that night.  At last, the colonel rose and threw open a window, and stood looking into the moonlit garden. The world bathed in a mist of blue and silver. There was a breeze that brought him sweet, warm odors from the garden, together with a blurred shrilling of crickets and the conspiratorial conference of young leaves.  \"Of course, it is tremendously fine and--and nice, if you like it,\" he said, with a faint chuckle. \"I wonder, now, if I do like it?\"  He was strangely moved. He seemed, somehow, to survey Rudolph Musgrave and all his doings with complete and unconcerned aloofness. The man's life, seen in its true proportions, dwindled into the merest flicker of a match; he had such a little while to live, this Rudolph Musgrave! And he spent the serious hours of this brief time writing notes and charts and pamphlets that perhaps some hundred men in all the universe might care to read--pamphlets no better and no more accurate than hundreds of other men were writing at that very moment.  No, the capacity for originative and enduring work was not in him; and this incessant compilation of dreary footnotes, this incessant rummaging among the bones of the dead--did it, after all, mean more to this Rudolph Musgrave than one full, vivid hour of life in that militant world yonder, where men fought for other and more tangible prizes than the mention of one's name in a genealogical journal?  He could not have told you. In his heart, he knew that a thorough digest of the Wills and Orders of the Orphans' Court of any county must always rank as a useful and creditable performance; but, from without, the sounds and odors of Spring were calling to him, luring him, wringing his very heart, bidding him come forth into the open and crack a jest or two before he died, and stare at the girls a little before the match had flickered out.         *       *       *       *       *  At this time he heard a moaning noise. The colonel gave a shrug, sighed, and ascended to his sister's bedroom. He knew that Agatha must be ill; and that there is no more efficient quietus to wildish meditations than the heating of hot-water bottles and the administration of hypnotics he had long ago discovered.     PART TWO - RENASCENCE    \"As one imprisoned that hath lain alone   And dreamed of sunlight where no vagrant gleam   Of sunlight pierces, being freed, must deem   This too but dreaming, and must dread the sun   Whose glory dazzles,--even as such-an-one   Am I whose longing was but now supreme   For this high hour, and, now it strikes, esteem   I do but dream long dreamed-of goals are won.    \"Phyllis, I am not worthy of thy love.   I pray thee let no kindly word be said   Of me at all, for in the train thereof,   Whenas yet-parted lips, sigh-visited,   End speech and wait, mine when I will to move,   Such joy awakens that I grow afraid.\" THOMAS ROWLAND. _Triumphs of Phyllis_.     I   They passed with incredible celerity, those next ten days--those strange, delicious, topsy-turvy days. To Rudolph Musgrave it seemed afterward that he had dreamed them away in some vague Lotus Land--in a delectable country where, he remembered, there were always purple eyes that mocked you, and red lips that coaxed you now, and now cast gibes at you.  You felt, for the most part of your stay in this country, flushed and hot and uncomfortable and unbelievably awkward, and you were mercilessly bedeviled there; but not for all the accumulated wealth of Samarkand and Ind and Ophir would you have had it otherwise. Ah, no, not otherwise in the least trifle. For now uplifted to a rosy zone of acquiescence, you partook incuriously at table of nectar and ambrosia, and noted abroad, without any surprise, that you trod upon a more verdant grass than usual, and that someone had polished up the sun a bit; and, in fine, you snatched a fearful joy from the performance of the most trivial functions of life.  Yet always he remembered that it could not last; always he remembered that in the autumn Patricia was to marry Lord Pevensey. She sometimes gave him letters to mail which were addressed to that nobleman. He wondered savagely what was in them; he posted them with a vicious shove; and, for the time, they caused him acute twinges of misery. But not for long; no, for, in sober earnest, if some fantastic sequence of events had made his one chance of winning Patricia Stapylton dependent on his spending a miserable half-hour in her company, Rudolph Musgrave could not have done it.  As for Miss Stapylton, she appeared to delight in the cloistered, easy-going life of Lichfield. The quaint and beautiful old town fell short in nothing of her expectations, in spite of the fact that she had previously read John Charteris's tales of Lichfield,--\"those effusions which\" (if the _Lichfield Courier-Herald_ is to be trusted) \"have builded, by the strength and witchery of record and rhyme, romance and poem, a myriad-windowed temple in Lichfield's honor--exquisite, luminous, and enduring--for all the world to see.\"  Miss Stapylton appeared to delight in the cloistered easy-going life of Lichfield,--that town which was once, as the outside world has half-forgotten now, the center of America's wealth, politics and culture, the town to which Europeans compiling \"impressions\" of America devoted one of their longest chapters in the heyday of Elijah Pogram and Jefferson Brick. But the War between the States has changed all that, and Lichfield endures to-day only as a pleasant backwater.  Very pleasant, too, it was in the days of Patricia's advent. There were strikingly few young men about, to be sure; most of them on reaching maturity had settled in more bustling regions. But many maidens remained whom memory delights to catalogue,--tall, brilliant Lizzie Allardyce, the lovely and cattish Marian Winwood, to whom Felix Kennaston wrote those wonderful love-letters which she published when he married Kathleen Saumarez, the rich Baugh heiresses from Georgia, the Pride twins, and Mattie Ferneyhaugh, whom even rival beauties loved, they say, and other damsels by the score,--all in due time to be wooed and won, and then to pass out of the old town's life.  Among the men of Rudolph Musgrave's generation--those gallant oldsters who were born and bred, and meant to die, in Lichfield,--Patricia did not lack for admirers. Tom May was one of them, of course; rarely a pretty face escaped the tribute of at least one proposal from Tom May. Then there was Roderick Taunton, he with the leonine mane, who spared her none of his forensic eloquence, but found Patricia less tractable than the most stubborn of juries. Bluff Walter Thurman, too, who was said to know more of Dickens, whist and criminal law than any other man living, came to worship at her shrine, as likewise did huge red-faced Ashby Bland, famed for that cavalry charge which history-books tell you that he led, and at which he actually was not present, for reasons all Lichfield knew and chuckled over. And Courtney Thorpe and Charles Maupin, doctors of the flesh and the spirit severally, were others among the rivals who gathered about Patricia at decorous festivals when, candles lighted, the butler and his underlings came with trays of delectable things to eat, and the \"nests\" of tables were set out, and pleasant chatter abounded.  And among Patricia's attendants Colonel Musgrave, it is needless to relate, was preëminently pertinacious. The two found a deal to talk about, somehow, though it is doubtful if many of their comments were of sufficient importance or novelty to merit record. Then, also, he often read aloud to her from lovely books, for the colonel read admirably and did not scruple to give emotional passages their value. _Trilby_, published the preceding spring in book form, was one of these books, for all this was at a very remote period; and the _Rubaiyat_ was another, for that poem was as yet unhackneyed and hardly wellknown enough to be parodied in those happy days.  Once he read to her that wonderful sad tale of Hans Christian Andersen's which treats of the china chimney-sweep and the shepherdess, who eloped from their bedizened tiny parlor-table, and were frightened by the vastness of the world outside, and crept ignominiously back to their fit home. \"And so,\" the colonel ended, \"the little china people remained together, and were thankful for the rivet in grandfather's neck, and continued to love each other until they were broken to pieces.\"  \"It was really a very lucky thing,\" Patricia estimated, \"that the grandfather had a rivet in his neck and couldn't nod to the billy-goat-legged person to take the shepherdess away into his cupboard. I don't doubt the little china people were glad of it. But after climbing so far--and seeing the stars,--I think they ought to have had more to be glad for.\" Her voice was quaintly wistful.  \"I will let you into a secret--er--Patricia. That rivet was made out of the strongest material in the whole universe. And the old grandfather was glad, at bottom, he had it in his neck so that he couldn't nod and separate the shepherdess from the chimney-sweep.\"  \"Yes,--I guess he had been rather a rip among the bric-à-brac"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10041"],["title","The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck: A Comedy of Limitations (#5)"],["body"," his day and sympathized with them?\"  \"No, it wasn't just that. You see these little china people had forsaken their orderly comfortable world on the parlor table to climb very high. It was a brave thing to do, even though they faltered and came back after a while. It is what we all want to do, Patricia--to climb toward the stars,--even those of us who are too lazy or too cowardly to attempt it. And when others try it, we are envious and a little uncomfortable, and we probably scoff; but we can't help admiring, and there is a rivet in the neck of all of us which prevents us from interfering. Oh, yes, we little china people have a variety of rivets, thank God, to prevent too frequent nodding and too cowardly a compromise with baseness,--rivets that are a part of us and force us into flashes of upright living, almost in spite of ourselves, when duty and inclination grapple. There is always the thing one cannot do for the reason that one is constituted as one is. That, I take it, is the real rivet in grandfather's neck and everybody else's.\"  He spoke disjointedly, vaguely, but the girl nodded. \"I think I understand, Olaf. Only, it is a two-edged rivet--to mix metaphors--and keeps us stiffnecked against all sorts of calls. No, I am not sure that the thing one cannot do because one is what one is, proves to be always a cause for international jubilations and fireworks on the lawn.\"     II   Thus Lichfield, as to its staid trousered citizenry, fell prostrate at Miss Stapylton's feet, and as to the remainder of its adults, vociferously failed to see anything in the least remarkable in her appearance, and avidly took and compared notes as to her personal apparel.  \"You have brought Asmodeus into Lichfield,\" Colonel Musgrave one day rebuked Miss Stapylton, as they sat in the garden. \"The demon of pride and dress is rampant everywhere--er--Patricia. Even Agatha does her hair differently now; and in church last Sunday I counted no less than seven duplicates of that blue hat of yours.\"  Miss Stapylton was moved to mirth. \"Fancy your noticing a thing like that!\" said she. \"I didn't know you were even aware I had a blue hat.\"  \"I am no judge,\" he conceded, gravely, \"of such fripperies. I don't pretend to be. But, on the other hand, I must plead guilty to deriving considerable harmless amusement from your efforts to dress as an example and an irritant to all Lichfield.\"  \"You wouldn't have me a dowd, Olaf?\" said she, demurely. \"I have to be neat and tidy, you know. You wouldn't have me going about in a continuous state of unbuttonedness and black bombazine like Mrs. Rabbet, would you?\"  Rudolph Musgrave debated as to this. \"I dare say,\" he at last conceded, cautiously, \"that to the casual eye your appearance is somewhat --er--more pleasing than that of our rector's wife. But, on the other hand----\"  \"Olaf, I am embarrassed by such fulsome eulogy. Mrs. Rabbet isn't a day under forty-nine. And you consider me _somewhat_ better-looking than she is!\"  He inspected her critically, and was confirmed in his opinion.  \"Olaf\"--coaxingly--\"do you really think I am as ugly as that?\"  \"Pouf!\" said the colonel airily; \"I dare say you are well enough.\"  \"Olaf\"--and this was even more cajoling--\"do you know you've never told me what sort of a woman you most admire?\"  \"I don't admire any of them,\" said Colonel Musgrave, stoutly. \"They are too vain and frivolous--especially the pink-and-white ones,\" he added, unkindlily.  \"Cousin Agatha has told me all about your multifarious affairs of course. She depicts you as a sort of cardiacal buccaneer and visibly gloats over the tale of your enormities. She is perfectly dear about it. But have you never--_cared_--for any woman, Olaf?\"  Precarious ground, this! His eyes were fixed upon her now. And hers, for doubtless sufficient reasons, were curiously intent upon anything in the universe rather than Rudolph Musgrave.  \"Yes,\" said he, with a little intake of the breath; \"yes, I cared once.\"  \"And--she cared?\" asked Miss Stapylton.  She happened, even now, not to be looking at him.  \"She!\" Rudolph Musgrave cried, in real surprise. \"Why, God bless my soul, of course she didn't! She didn't know anything about it.\"  \"You never told her, Olaf?\"--and this was reproachful. Then Patricia said: \"Well! and did she go down in the cellar and get the wood-ax or was she satisfied just to throw the bric-à-brac at you?\"  And Colonel Musgrave laughed aloud.  \"Ah!\" said he; \"it would have been a brave jest if I had told her, wouldn't it? She was young, you see, and wealthy, and--ah, well, I won't deceive you by exaggerating her personal attractions! I will serve up to you no praises of her sauced with lies. And I scorn to fall back on the stock-in-trade of the poets,--all their silly metaphors and similes and suchlike nonsense. I won't tell you that her complexion reminded me of roses swimming in milk, for it did nothing of the sort. Nor am I going to insist that her eyes had a fire like that of stars, or proclaim that Cupid was in the habit of lighting his torch from them. I don't think he was. I would like to have caught the brat taking any such liberties with those innocent, humorous, unfathomable eyes of hers! And they didn't remind me of violets, either,\" he pursued, belligerently, \"nor did her mouth look to me in the least like a rosebud, nor did I have the slightest difficulty in distinguishing between her hands and lilies. I consider these hyperbolical figures of speech to be idiotic. Ah, no!\" cried Colonel Musgrave, warming to his subject--and regarding it, too, very intently; \"ah, no, a face that could be patched together at the nearest florist's would not haunt a man's dreams o'nights, as hers does! I haven't any need for praises sauced with lies! I spurn hyperbole. I scorn exaggeration. I merely state calmly and judicially that she was God's masterpiece,--the most beautiful and adorable and indescribable creature that He ever made.\"  She smiled at this. \"You should have told her, Olaf,\" said Miss Stapylton. \"You should have told her that you cared.\"  He gave a gesture of dissent. \"She had everything,\" he pointed out, \"everything the world could afford her. And, doubtless, she would have been very glad to give it all up for me, wouldn't she?--for me, who haven't youth or wealth or fame or anything? Ah, I dare say she would have been delighted to give up the world she knew and loved,--the world that loved her,--for the privilege of helping me digest old county records!\"  And Rudolph Musgrave laughed again, though not mirthfully.  But the girl was staring at him, with a vague trouble in her eyes. \"You should have told her, Olaf,\" she repeated.  And at this point he noted that the arbutus-flush in her cheeks began to widen slowly, until, at last, it had burned back to the little pink ears, and had merged into the coppery glory of her hair, and had made her, if such a thing were possible--which a minute ago it manifestly was not,--more beautiful and adorable and indescribable than ever before.  \"Ah, yes!\" he scoffed, \"Lichfield would have made a fitting home for her. She would have been very happy here, shut off from the world with us,--with us, whose forefathers have married and intermarried with one another until the stock is worthless, and impotent for any further achievement. For here, you know, we have the best blood in America, and --for utilitarian purposes--that means the worst blood. Ah, we may prate of our superiority to the rest of the world,--and God knows, we do!--but, at bottom, we are worthless. We are worn out, I tell you! we are effete and stunted in brain and will-power, and the very desire of life is gone out of us! We are contented simply to exist in Lichfield. And she--\"  He paused, and a new, fierce light came into his eyes. \"She was so beautiful!\" he said, half-angrily, between clenched teeth.  \"You are just like the rest of them, Olaf,\" she lamented, with a hint of real sadness. \"You imagine you are in love with a girl because you happen to like the color of her eyes, or because there is a curve about her lips that appeals to you. That isn't love, Olaf, as we women understand it. Ah, no, a girl's love for a man doesn't depend altogether upon his fitness to be used as an advertisement for somebody's ready-made clothing.\"  \"You fancy you know what you are talking about,\" said Rudolph Musgrave, \"but you don't. You don't realize, you see, how beautiful she--was.\"  And this time, he nearly tripped upon the tense, for her hand was on his arm, and, in consequence, a series of warm, delicious little shivers was running about his body in a fashion highly favorable to extreme perturbation of mind.  \"You should have told her, Olaf,\" she said, wistfully. \"Oh, Olaf, Olaf, why didn't you tell her?\"  She did not know, of course, how she was tempting him; she did not know, of course, how her least touch seemed to waken every pulse in his body to an aching throb, and set hope and fear a-drumming in his breast. Obviously, she did not know; and it angered him that she did not.  \"She would have laughed at me,\" he said, with a snarl; \"how she would have laughed!\"  \"She wouldn't have laughed, Olaf.\" And, indeed, she did not look as if she would.  \"But much you know of her!\" said Rudolph Musgrave, morosely. \"She was just like the rest of them, I tell you! She knew how to stare a man out of countenance with big purple eyes that were like violets with the dew on them, and keep her paltry pink-and-white baby face all pensive and sober, till the poor devil went stark, staring mad, and would have pawned his very soul to tell her that he loved her! She knew! She did it on purpose. She would look pensive just to make an ass of you! She--\"  And here the colonel set his teeth for a moment, and resolutely drew back from the abyss.  \"She would not have cared for me,\" he said, with a shrug. \"I was not exactly the sort of fool she cared for. What she really cared for was a young fool who could dance with her in this"]]]
