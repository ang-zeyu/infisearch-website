We are, above all, a keen school. I want every boy to be keen.\"  \"We are, sir,\" said Psmith, with fervor.  \"Excellent.\"  \"On archaeology.\"  Mr. Downing--for it was no less a celebrity--started, as one who perceives a loathly caterpillar in his salad.  \"Archaeology!\"  \"We gave in our names to Mr. Outwood last night, sir. Archaeology is a passion with us, sir. When we heard that there was a society here, we went singing about the house.\"  \"I call it an unnatural pursuit for boys,\" said Mr. Downing vehemently. \"I don't like it. I tell you I don't like it. It is not for me to interfere with one of my colleagues on the staff, but I tell you frankly that in my opinion it is an abominable waste of time for a boy. It gets him into idle, loafing habits.\"  \"I never loaf, sir,\" said Psmith.  \"I was not alluding to you in particular. I was referring to the principle of the thing. A boy ought to be playing cricket with other boys, not wandering at large about the country, probably smoking and going into low public houses.\"  \"A very wild lot, sir, I fear, the Archaeological Society here,\" sighed Psmith, shaking his head.  \"If you choose to waste your time, I suppose I can't hinder you. But in my opinion it is foolery, nothing else.\"  He stumped off.  \"Now _he's_ cross,\" said Psmith, looking after him. \"I'm afraid we're getting ourselves disliked here.\"  \"Good job, too.\"  \"At any rate, Comrade Outwood loves us. Let's go on and see what sort of a lunch that large-hearted fossil fancier is going to give us.\"    8  MIKE FINDS OCCUPATION   There was more than one moment during the first fortnight of term when Mike found himself regretting the attitude he had imposed upon himself with regard to Sedleighan cricket. He began to realize the eternal truth of the proverb about half a loaf and no bread. In the first flush of his resentment against his new surroundings he had refused to play cricket. And now he positively ached for a game. Any sort of a game. An innings for a Kindergarten _v_. the Second Eleven of a Home of Rest for Centenarians would have soothed him. There were times, when the sun shone, and he caught sight of white flannels on a green ground, and heard the \"plonk\" of bat striking ball, when he felt like rushing to Adair and shouting, \"I _will_ be good. I was in the Wrykyn team three years, and had an average of over fifty the last two seasons. Lead me to the nearest net, and let me feel a bat in my hands again.\"  But every time he shrank from such a climb down. It couldn't be done.  What made it worse was that he saw, after watching behind the nets once or twice, that Sedleigh cricket was not the childish burlesque of the game which he had been rash enough to assume that it must be. Numbers do not make good cricket. They only make the presence of good cricketers more likely, by the law of averages.  Mike soon saw that cricket was by no means an unknown art at Sedleigh. Adair, to begin with, was a very good bowler indeed. He was not a Burgess, but Burgess was the only Wrykyn bowler whom, in his three years' experience of the school, Mike would have placed above him. He was a long way better than Neville-Smith, and Wyatt, and Milton, and the others who had taken wickets for Wrykyn.  The batting was not so good, but there were some quite capable men. Barnes, the head of Outwood's, he who preferred not to interfere with Stone and Robinson, was a mild, rather timid-looking youth--not unlike what Mr. Outwood must have been as a boy--but he knew how to keep balls out of his wicket. He was a good bat of the old plodding type.  Stone and Robinson themselves, that swashbuckling pair, who now treated Mike and Psmith with cold but consistent politeness, were both fair batsmen, and Stone was a good slow bowler.  There were other exponents of the game, mostly in Downing's house.  Altogether, quite worthy colleagues even for a man who had been a star at Wrykyn.         *       *       *       *       *  One solitary overture Mike made during that first fortnight. He did not repeat the experiment.  It was on a Thursday afternoon, after school. The day was warm, but freshened by an almost imperceptible breeze. The air was full of the scent of the cut grass which lay in little heaps behind the nets. This is the real cricket scent, which calls to one like the very voice of the game.  Mike, as he sat there watching, could stand it no longer.  He went up to Adair.  \"May I have an innings at this net?\" he asked. He was embarrassed and nervous, and was trying not to show it. The natural result was that his manner was offensively abrupt.  Adair was taking off his pads after his innings. He looked up. \"This net,\" it may be observed, was the first eleven net.  \"What?\" he said.  Mike repeated his request. More abruptly this time, from increased embarrassment.  \"This is the first eleven net,\" said Adair coldly. \"Go in after Lodge over there.\"  \"Over there\" was the end net, where frenzied novices were bowling on a corrugated pitch to a red-haired youth with enormous feet, who looked as if he were taking his first lesson at the game.  Mike walked away without a word.         *       *       *       *       *  The Archaeological Society expeditions, even though they carried with them the privilege of listening to Psmith's views of life, proved but a poor substitute for cricket. Psmith, who had no counterattraction shouting to him that he ought to be elsewhere, seemed to enjoy them hugely, but Mike almost cried sometimes from boredom. It was not always possible to slip away from the throng, for Mr. Outwood evidently looked upon them as among the very faithful, and kept them by his side.  Mike on these occasions was silent and jumpy, his brow \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of care.\" But Psmith followed his leader with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son is showing him round the garden. Psmith's attitude toward archaeological research struck a new note in the history of that neglected science. He was amiable, but patronizing. He patronized fossils, and he patronized ruins. If he had been confronted with the Great Pyramid, he would have patronized that.  He seemed to be consumed by a thirst for knowledge.  That this was not altogether a genuine thirst was proved in the third expedition. Mr. Outwood and his band were pecking away at the site of an old Roman camp. Psmith approached Mike.  \"Having inspired confidence,\" he said, \"by the docility of our demeanor, let us slip away, and brood apart for awhile. Roman camps, to be absolutely accurate, give me the pip. And I never want to see another putrid fossil in my life. Let us find some shady nook where a man may lie on his back for a bit.\"  Mike, over whom the proceedings connected with the Roman camp had long since begun to shed a blue depression, offered no opposition, and they strolled away down the hill.  Looking back, they saw that the archaeologists were still hard at it. Their departure had passed unnoticed.  \"A fatiguing pursuit, this grubbing for mementos of the past,\" said Psmith. \"And, above all, dashed bad for the knees of the trousers. Mine are like some furrowed field. It's a great grief to a man of refinement, I can tell you, Comrade Jackson. Ah, this looks a likely spot.\"  They had passed through a gate into the field beyond. At the farther end there was a brook, shaded by trees and running with a pleasant sound over pebbles.  \"Thus far,\" said Psmith, hitching up the knees of his trousers, and sitting down, \"and no farther. We will rest here awhile, and listen to the music of the brook. In fact, unless you have anything important to say, I rather think I'll go to sleep. In this busy life of ours these naps by the wayside are invaluable. Call me in about an hour.\" And Psmith, heaving the comfortable sigh of the worker who by toil has earned rest, lay down, with his head against a mossy tree stump, and closed his eyes.  Mike sat on for a few minutes, listening to the water and making centuries in his mind, and then, finding this a little dull, he got up, jumped the brook, and began to explore the wood on the other side.  He had not gone many yards when a dog emerged suddenly from the undergrowth, and began to bark vigorously at him.  Mike liked dogs, and, on acquaintance, they always liked him. But when you meet a dog in someone else's wood, it is as well not to stop in order that you may get to understand each other. Mike began to thread his way back through the trees.  He was too late.  \"Stop! What the dickens are you doing here?\" shouted a voice behind him.  In the same situation a few years before, Mike would have carried on, and trusted to speed to save him. But now there seemed a lack of dignity in the action. He came back to where the man was standing.  \"I'm sorry if I'm trespassing,\" he said. \"I was just having a look round.\"  \"The dickens you--Why, you're Jackson!\"  Mike looked at him. He was a short, broad young man with a fair moustache. Mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere, but he could not place him.  \"I played against you, for the Free Foresters last summer. In passing you seem to be a bit of a free forester yourself, dancing in among my nesting pheasants.\"  \"I'm frightfully sorry.\"  \"That's all right. Where do you spring from?\"  \"Of course--I remember you now. You're Prendergast. You made fifty-eight not out.\"  \"Thanks. I was afraid the only thing you would remember about me was that you took a century mostly off my bowling.\"  \"You ought to have had me second ball, only cover dropped it.\"  \"Don't rake up forgotten tragedies. How is it you're not at Wrykyn? What are you doing down here?\"  \"I've left Wrykyn.\"  Prendergast suddenly changed the conversation. When a fellow tells you that he has left school unexpectedly, it is not always tactful to inquire the reason. He began to talk about himself.  \"I hang out down here. I do a little farming and a good deal of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],["title","Mike and Psmith (#8)"],["body","about.\"  \"Get any cricket?\" asked Mike, turning to the subject next his heart.  \"Only village. Very keen, but no great shakes. By the way, how are you off for cricket now? Have you ever got a spare afternoon?\"  Mike's heart leaped.  \"Any Wednesday or Saturday. Look here, I'll tell you how it is.\"  And he told how matters stood with him.  \"So, you see,\" he concluded, \"I'm supposed to be hunting for ruins and things\"--Mike's ideas on the subject of archaeology were vague--\"but I could always slip away. We all start out together, but I could nip back, get onto my bike--I've got it down here--and meet you anywhere you liked. By Jove, I'm simply dying for a game. I can hardly keep my hands off a bat.\"  \"I'll give you all you want. What you'd better do is to ride straight to Lower Borlock--that's the name of the place--and I'll meet you on the ground. Anyone will tell you where Lower Borlock is. It's just off the London road. There's a signpost where you turn off. Can you come next Saturday?\"  \"Rather. I suppose you can fix me up with a bat and pads? I don't want to bring mine.\"  \"I'll lend you everything. I say, you know, we can't give you a Wrykyn wicket. The Lower Borlock pitch isn't a shirt front.\"  \"I'll play on a rockery, if you want me to,\" said Mike.         *       *       *       *       *  \"You're going to what?\" asked Psmith, sleepily, on being awakened and told the news.  \"I'm going to play cricket, for a village near here. I say, don't tell a soul, will you? I don't want it to get about, or I may get lugged in to play for the school.\"  \"My lips are sealed. I think I'll come and watch you. Cricket I dislike, but watching cricket is one of the finest of Britain's manly sports. I'll borrow Jellicoe's bicycle.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That Saturday, Lower Borlock smote the men of Chidford hip and thigh. Their victory was due to a hurricane innings of seventy-five by a newcomer to the team, M. Jackson.    9  THE FIRE BRIGADE MEETING   Cricket is the great safety valve. If you like the game, and are in a position to play it at least twice a week, life can never be entirely gray. As time went on, and his average for Lower Borlock reached the fifties and stayed there, Mike began, though he would not have admitted it, to enjoy himself. It was not Wrykyn, but it was a very decent substitute.  The only really considerable element making for discomfort now was Mr. Downing. By bad luck it was in his form that Mike had been placed on arrival; and Mr. Downing, never an easy form master to get on with, proved more than usually difficult in his dealings with Mike.  They had taken a dislike to each other at their first meeting; and it grew with further acquaintance. To Mike, Mr. Downing was all that a master ought not to be, fussy, pompous, and openly influenced in his official dealings with his form by his own private likes and dislikes. To Mr. Downing, Mike was simply an unamiable loafer, who did nothing for the school and apparently had none of the healthy instincts which should be implanted in the healthy boy. Mr. Downing was rather strong on the healthy boy.  The two lived in a state of simmering hostility, punctuated at intervals by crises, which usually resulted in Lower Borlock having to play some unskilled laborer in place of their star batsman, employed doing \"overtime.\"  One of the most acute of these crises, and the most important, in that it was the direct cause of Mike's appearance in Sedleigh cricket, had to do with the third weekly meeting of the School Fire Brigade.  It may be remembered that this well-supported institution was under Mr. Downing's special care. It was, indeed, his pet hobby and the apple of his eye.  Just as you had to join the Archaeological Society to secure the esteem of Mr. Outwood, so to become a member of the Fire Brigade was a safe passport to the regard of Mr. Downing. To show a keenness for cricket was good, but to join the Fire Brigade was best of all.  The Brigade was carefully organized. At its head was Mr. Downing, a sort of high priest; under him was a captain, and under the captain a vice-captain. These two officials were those sportive allies, Stone and Robinson, of Outwood's house, who, having perceived at a very early date the gorgeous opportunities for ragging which the Brigade offered to its members, had joined young and worked their way up.  Under them were the rank and file, about thirty in all, of whom perhaps seven were earnest workers, who looked on the Brigade in the right, or Downing, spirit. The rest were entirely frivolous.  The weekly meetings were always full of life and excitement.  At this point it is as well to introduce Sammy to the reader.  Sammy, short for Sampson, was a young bull terrier belonging to Mr. Downing. If it is possible for a man to have two apples of his eye, Sammy was the other. He was a large, lighthearted dog with a white coat, an engaging expression, the tongue of an anteater, and a manner which was a happy blend of hurricane and circular saw. He had long legs, a tenor voice, and was apparently made of India rubber.  Sammy was a great favorite in the school, and a particular friend of Mike's, the Wrykynian being always a firm ally of every dog he met after two minutes' acquaintance.  In passing, Jellicoe owned a clockwork rat, much in request during French lessons.  We will now proceed to the painful details.         *       *       *       *       *  The meetings of the Fire Brigade were held after school in Mr. Downing's form room. The proceedings always began in the same way, by the reading of the minutes of the last meeting. After that the entertainment varied according to whether the members happened to be fertile or not in ideas for the disturbing of the peace.  Today they were in very fair form.  As soon as Mr. Downing had closed the minute book, Wilson, of the School House, held up his hand.  \"Well, Wilson?\"  \"Please, sir, couldn't we have a uniform for the Brigade?\"  \"A uniform?\" Mr. Downing pondered.  \"Red, with green stripes, sir.\"  Red, with a thin green stripe, was the Sedleigh color.  \"Shall I put it to the vote, sir?\" asked Stone.  \"One moment, Stone.\"  \"Those in favor of the motion move to the left, those against it to the right.\"  A scuffling of feet, a slamming of desk lids and an upset blackboard, and the meeting had divided.  Mr. Downing rapped irritably on his desk.  \"Sit down!\" he said. \"Sit down! I won't have this noise and disturbance. Stone, sit down--Wilson, get back to your place.\"  \"Please, sir, the motion is carried by twenty-five votes to six.\"  \"Please, sir, may I go and get measured this evening?\"  \"Please, sir--\"  \"Si-_lence!_ The idea of a uniform is, of course, out of the question.\"  \"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!\"  \"Be _quiet!_ Entirely out of the question. We cannot plunge into needless expense. Stone, listen to me. I cannot have this noise and disturbance! Another time when a point arises it must be settled by a show of hands. Well, Wilson?\"  \"Please, sir, may we have helmets?\"  \"Very useful as a protection against falling timbers, sir,\" said Robinson.  \"I don't think my people would be pleased, sir, if they knew I was going out to fires without a helmet,\" said Stone.  The whole strength of the company: \"Please, sir, may we have helmets?\"  \"Those in favor ...\" began Stone.  Mr. Downing banged on his desk. \"Silence! Silence!! Silence!!! Helmets are, of course, perfectly preposterous.\"  \"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!\"  \"But, sir, the danger!\"  \"Please, sir, the falling timbers!\"  The Fire Brigade had been in action once and once only in the memory of man, and that time it was a haystack which had burned itself out just as the rescuers had succeeded in fastening the hose to the hydrant.  \"Silence!\"  \"Then, please, sir, couldn't we have an honor cap? It wouldn't be expensive, and it would be just as good as a helmet for all the timbers that are likely to fall on our heads.\"  Mr. Downing smiled a wry smile.  \"Our Wilson is facetious,\" he remarked frostily.  \"Sir, no, sir! I wasn't facetious! Or couldn't we have tasseled caps like the first fifteen have? They--\"  \"Wilson, leave the room!\"  \"Sir, _please_, sir!\"  \"This moment, Wilson. And,\" as he reached the door, \"do me one hundred lines.\"  A pained \"OO-oo-oo, sir-r-r,\" was cut off by the closing door.  Mr. Downing proceeded to improve the occasion. \"I deplore this growing spirit of flippancy,\" he said. \"I tell you I deplore it! It is not right! If this Fire Brigade is to be of solid use, there must be less of this flippancy. We must have keenness. I want you boys above all to be keen. I...? What is that noise?\"  From the other side of the door proceeded a sound like water gurgling from a bottle, mingled with cries half suppressed, as if somebody were being prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his mouth. The sufferer appeared to have a high voice.  There was a tap at the door and Mike walked in. He was not alone. Those near enough to see, saw that he was accompanied by Jellicoe's clockwork rat, which moved rapidly over the floor in the direction of the opposite wall.  \"May I fetch a book from my desk, sir?\" asked Mike.  \"Very well--be quick, Jackson; we are busy.\"  Being interrupted in one of his addresses to the Brigade irritated Mr. Downing.  The muffled cries grew more distinct.  \"What ... is ... that ... noise?\" shrilled Mr. Downing.  \"Noise, sir?\" asked Mike, puzzled.  \"I think it's something outside the window, sir,\" said Stone helpfully.  \"A bird, I think, sir,\" said Robinson.  \"Don't be absurd!\" snapped Mr. Downing. \"It's outside the door. Wilson!\"  \"Yes, sir?\" said a voice \"off.\"  \"Are you making that whining noise?\"  \"Whining noise, sir? No, sir, I'm not making a whining noise.\"  \"What _sort_ of noise, sir?\" inquired Mike, as many Wrykynians had asked before him. It was a question invented by Wrykyn for use in just such a case as this.  \"I do not propose,\" said Mr. Downing acidly, \"to imitate the noise; you can all"]]]
