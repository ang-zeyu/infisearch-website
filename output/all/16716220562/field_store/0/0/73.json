But I may as well say here that I never really appreciated it. The florid style of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Louis is not at all to my taste; and I am too little of a connoisseur to admire a beauty which has no personal appeal for me. So I am afraid that Vantine found me a little cold.  Certainly there was nothing cold about the way he regarded it. His eyes gleamed with a strange fire as he looked at it; he ran his fingers over the inlay with a touch almost reverent; he pulled out for me the little drawers with much the same air that another friend of mine takes down his Kilmarnock Burns from his bookshelves; he pointed out to me the grace of its curves in the same tone that one uses to discuss the masterpiece of a great artist. And then, finding no echo to his enthusiasm, he suddenly stopped.  \"You don't seem to care for it,\" he said, looking at me.  \"That's my fault and not the fault of the cabinet,\" I pointed out. \"I'm not educated up to it; I'm too little of an artist, perhaps.\"  He was flushed, as a man might be should another make a disparaging remark about his wife, and he led the way from the room at once.  \"Remember, Lester,\" he said, a little sternly, pausing with his hand on the front door, \"there is to be no foolishness about securing that cabinet for me. Don't you let it get away. I'm in deadly earnest.\"  \"I won't let it get away,\" I promised. \"Perhaps it's just as well I'm not over-enthusiastic about it.\"  \"Let me know as soon as you have any news,\" he said, and opened the door for me.  I had intended walking home, but as I turned up the Avenue, I met sweeping down it a flood of girls just released from the workshops of the neighbourhood. I struggled against it for a few moments, then gave it up, hailed a cab, and settled back against the cushions with a sigh of relief. I was glad to be out of Vantine's house; something there oppressed me and left me ill at ease. Was Vantine quite normal, I wondered? Could any man be normal who was willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for a piece of furniture? Especially a man who could not afford such extravagance? I knew the size of Vantine's fortune; it was large, but a hundred thousand dollars represented more than a year's income. And then I smiled to myself. Of course Vantine had been merely jesting when he named that limit. The cabinet could be bought for a tenth of it, at the most. And, still smiling, I left the cab, paid the driver, and mounted to my rooms.     CHAPTER IV  THE THUNDERBOLT   It was about eight o'clock that evening that Godfrey tapped at my door, and when I let him in, I could tell by the way his eyes were shining that he had some news.  \"I can't stay long,\" he said. \"I've got to get down to the office and put the finishing touches on that story;\" but nevertheless he took the cigar I proffered him and sank into the chair opposite my own.  I knew Godfrey, so I waited patiently until the cigar was going nicely, then--  \"Well?\" I asked.  \"It's like old times, isn't it, Lester?\" and he smiled across at me. \"How many conferences have we had in this room? How many of your cigars have I made away with?\"  \"Not half enough recently,\" I said. \"You haven't been here for months.\"  \"I'm sure to drift back, sooner or later, because you seem to have a knack of getting in on the interesting cases. And I want to say this, Lester, that of all I ever had, not one has promised better than this one does. If it only keeps up--but one mustn't expect too much!\"  \"You've been working on it, of course?\"  \"I haven't been idle, and just now I'm feeling rather pleased with myself. The coroner's physician finished his post-mortem half an hour or so ago.\"  \"Well?\" I said again.  \"The stomach was absolutely normal. It showed no trace of poison of any kind.\"  He stretched himself, lay back in his chair, sent a smoke-ring circling toward the ceiling, and watched it, smiling absently.  \"Rather a facer for our friend Goldberger,\" he added, after a minute.  \"What's the matter with Goldberger? He seemed rather peeved with you this afternoon.\"  \"No wonder. He's Grady's man, and we're after Grady. Grady isn't fit to head the detective bureau--he got the job through his pull with Tammany--he's stupid, and I suspect he's crooked. The _Record_ says he has got to go.\"  \"So, of course, he _will_ go,\" I commented, smiling.  \"He certainly will,\" assented Godfrey seriously, \"and that before long. But meanwhile it's a little difficult for me, because his people don't know which way to jump. Once he's out, everything will be serene again.\"  I wasn't interested in Grady, so I came back to the case in hand.  \"Look here, Godfrey,\" I said, \"if it wasn't poison, what was it?\"  \"But it _was_ poison.\"  \"Inserted at the hand?\"  He nodded.  \"Goldberger says there's no poison known which could be used that way and which would act so quickly.\"  \"Goldberger is right in that,\" agreed Godfrey; \"but there's a poison unknown that will--because it did.\"  \"It wasn't a snake bite?\"  \"Oh, no; snake poison wouldn't kill a man that quickly--not even a fer-de-lance. That fellow practically dropped where he was struck.\"  \"Then what was it?\"  Godfrey was sitting erect again. He was not smiling now. His face was very stern.  \"That is what I am going to find out, Lester,\" he said; \"that is the problem I've set myself to solve--and it's a pretty one. There is one thing certain--that fellow was killed by some agency outside himself. In some way, a drop or two of poison was introduced into his blood by an instrument something like a hypodermic needle; and that poison was so powerful that almost instantly it caused paralysis of the heart. After all, that isn't so remarkable as it might seem. The blood in the veins of the hand would be carried back to the heart in four or five seconds.\"  \"But you've already said there's no poison so powerful as all that.\"  \"I said we didn't know of any. I wouldn't be so sure that Catherine de Medici didn't.\"  \"What has Catherine de Medici to do with it?\"  \"Nothing--except that what has been done may always be done again. Those old stories are, no doubt, exaggerated; but it seems fairly certain that the Queen of Navarre was killed with a pair of poisoned gloves, the Duc d'Anjou with the scent of a poisoned rose, and the Prince de Porcian with the smoke of a poisoned lamp. This case isn't as extraordinary as those.\"  \"No,\" I agreed, and fell silent, shivering a little, for there is something horrible and revolting about the poisoner.  \"After all,\" went on Godfrey, at last, \"there is one thing that neither you nor I nor any reasonable man can believe, and that is that this Frenchman came from heaven knows where--from Paris, perhaps--with Vantine's address in his pocket, and hunted up the house and made his way into it simply to kill himself there. He had some other object, and he met his death while trying to accomplish it.\"  \"Have you found out who he is?\"  \"No; he's not registered at any of the hotels; the French consul never heard of him; he belongs to none of the French societies; he's not known in the French quarter. He seems to have dropped in from the clouds. We've cabled our Paris office to look him up; we may hear from there to-night. But even if we discover the identity of Th√©ophile d'Aurelle, it won't help us any.\"  \"Why not?\" I demanded.  \"Because it is evident that that isn't his name.\"  \"Go ahead and tell me, Godfrey,\" I said, as he looked at me, smiling. \"I don't see it.\"  \"Why, it's plain enough. He had five cards in his pocket, no two alike. The sixth, selected probably at random, he had sent up to Vantine.\"  I saw it then, of course; and I felt a good deal as the Spanish savants must have felt when Columbus stood the egg on end. Godfrey smiled again at my expression.  \"The real d'Aurelle, whoever he may turn out to be, may be able to help us,\" he added. \"If he can't, we may learn something from the Paris police. The dead man's Bertillon measurements have been cabled over to them. Even that won't help, if he has never been arrested. And, of course, we can't get at motives until we find out something about him.\"  \"But, Godfrey,\" I said, \"suppose you knew who he was and what he wanted with Vantine--suppose you could make a guess at who killed him and why--how was it done? That is what stumps me. How was it done?\"  \"Ah!\" agreed Godfrey. \"That's it! How was it done? I told you it was a pretty case, Lester. But wait till we hear from Paris.\"  \"That reminds me,\" I said, sitting up suddenly, \"I've got to cable to Paris myself, on some business for Mr. Vantine.\"  \"Not connected with this affair?\"  \"Oh, no; his shippers over there sent him a piece of furniture that doesn't belong to him. He asked me to straighten the matter out.\"  I rang for the hall-boy, asked for a cable-blank, and sent off a message to Armand & Son, telling them of the mistake and asking them to cable the name of the owner of the cabinet now in Mr. Vantine's possession. Godfrey sat smoking reflectively while I was thus engaged, staring straight before him with eyes that saw nothing; but as I sat down again and took up my pipe, ready to continue the conversation, he gave himself a sort of shake, put on his hat, and got to his feet.  \"I must be moving along,\" he said. \"There's no use sitting here theorising until we have some sort of foundation to build on.\"  \"Goldberger was right in one thing,\" I remarked. \"He pointed out, after you left, that most crimes are not romances, but mere brutalities. Perhaps this one--\"  The ringing of my telephone stopped me.  \"Hello,\" I said, taking down the receiver.  \"Is that you, Mr. Lester?\" asked a voice.  \"Yes.\"  \"This is Parks,\" and I suddenly realised that his voice was unfamiliar because it was hoarse and quivering with emotion. \"Could you come down to the house right away, sir?\"  \"Why, yes,\" I said, wonderingly, \"if it's important. Does Mr. Vantine need me?\"  \"We all need you!\" said the voice, and broke into a dry sob. \"For God's sake, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10067"],["title","The Mystery of the Boule Cabinet: A Detective Story (#5)"],["body","quick, Mr. Lester!\"  \"All right,\" I said without further parley, for evidently he had lost his self-control. \"Something has happened down at Vantine's,\" I added to Godfrey, as I hung up the receiver. \"Parks seems to be scared to death. He wants me to come down right away,\" and I reached for my hat and coat.  \"Shall I come, too?\" asked Godfrey.  Even under the stress of the moment, I could not but smile at the question and at the tone in which it was uttered.  \"Perhaps you'd better,\" I agreed. \"It sounded pretty serious.\"  We went down together in the elevator, and three minutes later we had hailed a taxi and were speeding eastward toward the Avenue. It had started to drizzle, and the asphalt shone like a black mirror, dancing with the lights along either side. The streets were almost empty, for the theatre-crowd had passed, and as we reached the Avenue and turned down-town, the driver pushed up his spark, and we hurtled along toward Fourteenth street at a speed which made me think of the traffic regulations. But no policeman interfered, and five minutes later we drew up before the Vantine place.  Parks must have been on the front steps looking for me, for he came running down them almost before the car had stopped. I caught a glimpse of his face under the street lights, as I thrust a bill into the driver's hand, and it fairly startled me.  \"Is it you, Mr. Lester?\" he gasped. \"Good God, but I'm glad you're here--\"  I caught him by the arm.  \"Steady, man,\" I said. \"Don't let yourself go to pieces. Now--what has happened?\"  He seemed to take a sort of desperate grip of himself.  \"I'll show you, sir,\" he said, and ran up the steps, along the hall, to the door of the ante-room where we had found the Frenchman's body. \"In there, sir!\" he sobbed. \"In there!\" and clung to the wall as I opened the door and stepped inside.  The room was ablaze with light, and for an instant my eyes were so dazzled that I could distinguish nothing. Dimly I saw Godfrey spring forward and drop to his knees.  Then my eyes cleared, and I saw, on the very spot where d'Aurelle had died, another body--or was it the same, brought back that the tragedy of the afternoon might, in some mysterious way, be re-enacted?  I remember bending over and peering into the face--  It was the face of Philip Vantine.  A minute must have passed as I stood there dazed and shaken. I was conscious, in a way, that Godfrey was examining him. Then I heard his voice.  \"He's dead,\" he said.  Then there was an instant's silence.  \"Lester, look here!\" cried Godfrey's voice, sharp, insistent. \"For God's sake, look here!\"  Godfrey was kneeling there holding something toward me.  \"Look here!\" he cried again.  It was the dead man's hand he was holding; the right hand; a swollen and discoloured hand. And on the back of it, just above the knuckles, were two tiny wounds, from which a few drops of blood had trickled.  And as I stared at this ghastly sight, scarce able to believe my eyes, I heard a choking voice behind me, saying over and over again:  \"It was that woman done it! It was that woman done it! Damn her! It was that woman done it!\"     CHAPTER V  GRADY TAKES A HAND   I have no very clear remembrance of what happened after that. The shock was so great that I had just strength enough to totter to a chair and drop into it, and sit there staring vaguely at that dark splotch on the carpet. I told myself that I was the victim of a dreadful nightmare; that all this was the result of over-wrought nerves and that I should wake presently. No doubt I had been working too hard. I needed a vacation--well, I would take it....  And all the time I knew that it was not a nightmare, but grim reality; that Philip Vantine was dead--killed by a woman. Who had told me that? And then I remembered the sobbing voice....  Two or three persons came into the room--Parks and the other servants, I suppose; I heard Godfrey's voice giving orders; and finally someone held a glass to my lips and commanded me to drink. I did so mechanically; coughed, spluttered, was conscious of a grateful warmth, and drank eagerly again. And then I saw Godfrey standing over me.  \"Feel better?\" he asked.  I nodded.  \"I don't wonder it knocked you out,\" he went on. \"I'm feeling shaky myself. I had them call Vantine's physician--but he can't do anything.\"  \"He's dead, then?\" I murmured, my eyes on that dark and crumpled object which had been Philip Vantine.  \"Yes--just like the other.\"  Then I remembered, and I caught his arm and drew him down to me.  \"Godfrey,\" I whispered, \"whose voice was it--or did I dream it --something about a woman?\"  \"You didn't dream it--it was Rogers--he's almost hysterical. We'll get the story, as soon as he quiets down.\"  Someone called him from the door, and he turned away, leaving me staring blankly at nothing. So there had been a woman in Vantine's life! Perhaps that was why he had never married. What ugly skeleton was to be dragged from its closet?  But if a woman killed Vantine, the same woman also killed d'Aurelle. Where was her hiding-place? From what ambush did she strike?  I glanced about the room, as a tremor of horror seized me. I arose, shaking, from the chair and groped my way toward the door. Godfrey heard me coming, swung around, and, with one glance at my face, came to me and caught me by the arms.  \"What is it, Lester?\" he asked.  \"I can't stand it here,\" I gasped. \"It's too horrible!\"  \"Don't think about it. Come out here and have another drink.\"  He led me into the hall, and a second glass of brandy gave me back something of my self-control. I was ashamed of my weakness, but when I glanced at Godfrey, I saw how white his face was.  \"Better take a drink yourself,\" I said.  I heard the decanter rattle on the glass.  \"I don't know when I have been so shaken,\" he said, setting the glass down empty. \"It was so gruesome--so unexpected--and then Rogers carrying on like a madman. Ah, here's the doctor,\" he added, as the front door opened and Parks showed a man in.  I knew Dr. Hughes, of course, returned his nod, and followed him and Godfrey into the ante-room. But I had not yet sufficiently recovered to do more than sit and stare at him as he knelt beside the body and assured himself that life had fled. Then I heard Godfrey telling him all we knew, while Hughes listened with incredulous face.  \"But it's absurd, you know!\" he protested, when Godfrey had finished. \"Things like this don't happen here in New York. In Florence, perhaps, in the Middle Ages; but not here in the twentieth century!\"  \"I can scarcely believe my own senses,\" Godfrey agreed. \"But I saw the Frenchman lying here this afternoon; and now here's Vantine.\"  \"On the same spot?\"  \"As nearly as I can tell.\"  \"And killed in the same way?\"  \"Killed in precisely the same way.\"  Hughes turned back to the body again, and looked long and earnestly at the injured hand.  \"What sort of instrument made this wound, would you say, Mr. Godfrey?\" he questioned, at last.  \"A sharp instrument, with two prongs. My theory is that the prongs are hollow, like a hypodermic needle, and leave a drop or two of poison at the bottom of the wound. You see a vein has been cut.\"  \"Yes,\" Hughes assented. \"It would scarcely be possible to pierce the hand here without striking a vein. One of the prongs would be sure to do it.\"  \"That's the reason there are two of them, I fancy.\"  \"But you are, of course, aware that no poison exists which would act so quickly?\" Hughes inquired.  Godfrey looked at him strangely.  \"You yourself mentioned Florence a moment ago,\" he said. \"You meant, I suppose, that such a poison did, at one time, exist there?\"  \"Something of the sort, perhaps,\" agreed Hughes. \"The words were purely instinctive, but I suppose some such thought was running through my head.\"  \"Well, the poison that existed in Florence five centuries ago, exists here to-day. There's the proof of it,\" and Godfrey pointed to the body.  Hughes drew a deep breath of wonder and horror.  \"But what sort of devilish instrument is it?\" he cried, his nerves giving way for an instant, his voice mounting shrilly. \"Above all, who wields it?\"  He stared about the room, as though half-expecting to see some mighty and remorseless arm poised, ready to strike. Then he shook himself together.  \"I beg pardon,\" he said, mopping the sweat from his face; \"but I'm not used to this sort of thing; and I'm frightened--yes, I really believe I'm frightened,\" and he laughed, a little unsteady laugh.  \"So am I,\" said Godfrey; \"so is Lester; so is everybody. You needn't be ashamed of it.\"  \"What frightens me,\" went on Hughes, evidently studying his own symptoms, \"is the mystery of it--there is something supernatural about it--something I can't understand. How does it happen that each of the victims is struck on the right hand? Why not the left hand? Why the hand at all?\"  Godfrey answered with a despairing shrug.  \"That is what we've got to find out,\" he said.  \"We shall have to call in the police,\" suggested Hughes. \"Maybe they can solve it.\"  Godfrey smiled, a little sceptical smile, quickly suppressed.  \"At least, they will have to be given the chance,\" he agreed. \"Shall I attend to it?\"  \"Yes,\" said Hughes; \"and you would better do it right away. The sooner they get here the better.\"  \"Very well,\" assented Godfrey, and left the room.  Hughes sat down heavily on the couch near the window, and mopped his face again, with a shaking hand. Death he was accustomed to--but death met decently in bed and resulting from some understood cause. Death in this horrible and mysterious form shook him; he could not understand it, and his failure to understand appalled him. He was a physician; it was his business to understand; and yet here was death in a form as mysterious to him as to the veriest layman. It compelled him to pause and take stock of himself--always a disconcerting process to the best of us!  That was a trying half hour. Hughes sat on the couch, breathing heavily, staring at the"]]]
