You cut in on every guy's territory. There ain't any privacy any more since you hit the road. What you got? A roving commission?\"  Donnegan waited for a moment before he answered. And when he spoke his voice had altered. Indeed, he had remarkable ability to pitch his voice into the roar of the freight train, and above or beneath it, and give it a quality such as he pleased.  \"I'm following a trail, but not yours,\" he admitted at length. \"I'm following a trail. I've been at it these two years and nothing has come of it.\"  \"Who you after?\"  \"A man with red hair.\"  \"That tells me a lot.\"  Donnegan refused to explain.  \"What you got against him--the color of his hair?\"  And Lefty roared contentedly at his own stale jest.  \"It's no good,\" replied Donnegan. \"I'll never get on the trail.\"  Lefty broke in: \"You mean to say you've been working two solid years and all on a trail that you ain't even found?\"  The silence answered him in the affirmative.  \"Ain't nobody been able to tip you off to him?\" went on Lefty, intensely interested.  \"Nobody. You see, he's a hard sort to describe. Red hair, that's all there was about him for a clue. But if any one ever saw him stripped they'd remember him by a big blotchy birthmark on his left shoulder.\"  \"Eh?\" grunted Lefty Joe.  He added: \"What was his name?\"  \"Don't know. He changed monikers when he took to the road.\"  \"What was he to you?\"  \"A man I'm going to find.\"  \"No matter where the trail takes you?\"  \"No matter where.\"  At this Lefty was seized with unaccountable laughter. He literally strained his lungs with that Homeric outburst. When he wiped the tears from his eyes, at length, the shadow on the opposite side of the doorway had disappeared. He found his companion leaning over him, and this time he could catch the dull glint of starlight on both hair and eyes.  \"What d'you know?\" asked Donnegan.  \"How do you stand toward this bird with the birthmark and the red hair?\" queried Lefty with caution.  \"What d'you know?\" insisted Donnegan.  All at once passion shook him; he fastened his grip in the shoulder of the larger man, and his fingertips worked toward the bone.  \"What do you know?\" he repeated for the third time, and now there was no hint of laughter in the hard voice of Lefty.  \"You fool, if you follow that trail you'll go to the devil. It was Rusty Dick; and he's dead!\"  His triumphant laughter came again, but Donnegan cut into it.  \"Rusty Dick was the one you--killed!\"  \"Sure. What of it? We fought fair and square.\"  \"Then Rusty wasn't the man I want. The man I want would of eaten two like you, Lefty.\"  \"What about the birthmark? It sure was on his shoulder; Donnegan.\"  \"Heavens!\" whispered Donnegan.  \"What's the matter?\"  \"Rusty Dick,\" gasped Donnegan. \"Yes, it must have been he.\"  \"Sure it was. What did you have against him?\"  \"It was a matter of blood--between us,\" stammered Donnegan.  His voice rose in a peculiar manner, so that Lefty shrank involuntarily.  \"You killed Rusty?\"  \"Ask any of the boys. But between you and me, it was the booze that licked Rusty Dick. I just finished up the job and surprised everybody.\"  The train was out of the mountains and in a country of scattering hills, but here it struck a steep grade and settled down to a grind of slow labor; the rails hummed, and suspense filled the freight car.  \"Hey,\" cried Lefty suddenly. \"You fool, you'll do a flop out the door in about a minute!\"  He even reached out to steady the toppling figure, but Donnegan pitched straight out into the night. Lefty craned his neck from the door, studying the roadbed, but at that moment the locomotive topped the little rise and the whole train lurched forward.  \"After all,\" murmured Lefty Joe, \"it sounds like Donnegan. Hated a guy so bad that he hadn't any use for livin' when he heard the other guy was dead. But I'm never goin' to cross his path again, I hope.\"     5   But Donnegan had leaped clear of the roadbed, and he struck almost to the knees in a drift of sand. Otherwise, he might well have broken his legs with that foolhardy chance. As it was, the fall whirled him over and over, and by the time he had picked himself up the lighted caboose of the train was rocking past him. Donnegan watched it grow small in the distance, and then, when it was only a red, uncertain star far down the track, he turned to the vast country around him.  The mountains were to his right, not far away, but caught up behind the shadows so that it seemed a great distance. Like all huge, half-seen things they seemed in motion toward him. For the rest, he was in bare, rolling country. The sky line everywhere was clean; there was hardly a sign of a tree. He knew, by a little reflection, that this must be cattle country, for the brakie had intimated as much in their talk just before dusk. Now it was early night, and a wind began to rise, blowing down the valley with a keen motion and a rapidly lessening temperature, so that Donnegan saw he must get to a shelter. He could, if necessary, endure any privation, but his tastes were for luxurious comfort. Accordingly he considered the landscape with gloomy disapproval. He was almost inclined to regret his plunge from the lumbering freight train. Two things had governed him in making that move. First, when he discovered that the long trail he followed was definitely fruitless, he was filled with a great desire to cut himself away from his past and make a new start. Secondly, when he learned that Rusty Dick had been killed by Joe, he wanted desperately to get the throttle of the latter under his thumb. If ever a man risked his life to avoid a sin, it was Donnegan jumping from the train to keep from murder.  He stooped to sight along the ground, for this is the best way at night and often horizon lights are revealed in this manner. But now Donnegan saw nothing to serve as a guide. He therefore drew in his belt until it fitted snug about his gaunt waist, settled his cap firmly, and headed straight into the wind.  Nothing could have shown his character more distinctly.  When in doubt, head into the wind.  With a jaunty, swinging step he sauntered along, and this time, at least, his tactics found an early reward. Topping the first large rise of ground, he saw in the hollow beneath him the outline of a large building. And as he approached it, the wind clearing a high blowing mist from the stars, he saw a jumble of outlying houses. Sheds, barns, corrals--it was the nucleus of a big ranch. It is a maxim that, if you wish to know a man look at his library and if you wish to know a rancher, look at his barn. Donnegan made a small detour to the left and headed for the largest of the barns.  He entered it by the big, sliding door, which stood open; he looked up, and saw the stars shining through a gap in the roof. And then he stood quietly for a time, listening to the voices of the wind in the ruin. Oddly enough, it was pleasant to Donnegan. His own troubles and sorrow had poured upon him so thickly in the past hour or so that it was soothing to find evidence of the distress of others. But perhaps this meant that the entire establishment was deserted.  He left the barn and went toward the house. Not until he was close under its wall did he come to appreciate its size. It was one of those great, rambling, two-storied structures which the cattle kings of the past generation were fond of building. Standing close to it, he heard none of the intimate sounds of the storm blowing through cracks and broken walls; no matter into what disrepair the barns had fallen, the house was still solid; only about the edges of the building the storm kept murmuring.  Yet there was not a light, neither above nor below. He came to the front of the house. Still no sign of life. He stood at the door and knocked loudly upon it, and though, when he tried the knob, he found that the door was latched, yet no one came in response. He knocked again, and putting his ear close he heard the echoes walk through the interior of the building.  After this, the wind rose in sudden strength and deafened him with rattlings; above him, a shutter was swung open and then crashed to, so that the opening of the door was a shock of surprise to Donnegan. A dim light from a source which he could not direct suffused the interior of the hall; the door itself was worked open a matter of inches and Donnegan was aware of two keen old eyes glittering out at him. Beyond this he could distinguish nothing.  \"Who are you?\" asked a woman's voice. \"And what do you want?\"  \"I'm a stranger, and I want something to eat and a place to sleep. This house looks as if it might have spare rooms.\"  \"Where d'you come from?\"  \"Yonder,\" said Donnegan, with a sufficiently noncommittal gesture.  \"What's your name?\"  \"Donnegan.\"  \"I don't know you. Be off with you, Mr. Donnegan!\"  He inserted his foot in the closing crack of the door.  \"Tell me where I'm to go?\" he persisted.  At this her voice rose in pitch, with squeaky rage.  \"I'll raise the house on you!\"  \"Raise 'em. Call down the man of the house. I can talk to him better than I can to you; but I won't walk off like this. If you can feed me, I'll pay you for what I eat.\"  A shrill cackling--he could not make out the words. And since patience was not the first of Donnegan's virtues, he seized on the knob of the door and deliberately pressed it wide. Standing in the hall, now, and closing the door slowly behind him, he saw a woman with old, keen eyes shrinking away toward the staircase. She was evidently in great fear, but there was something infinitely malicious in the manner in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],["title","Gunman's Reckoning (#4)"],["body","she kept working her lips soundlessly. She was shrinking, and half turned away, yet there was a suggestion that in an instant she might whirl and fly at his face. The door now clicked, and with the windstorm shut away Donnegan had a queer feeling of being trapped.  \"Now call the man of the house,\" he repeated. \"See if I can't come to terms with him.\"  \"He'd make short work of you if he came,\" she replied. She broke into a shrill laughter, and Donnegan thought he had never seen a face so ugly. \"If he came,\" she said, \"you'd rue the day.\"  \"Well, I'll talk to you, then. I'm not asking charity. I want to pay for what I get.\"  \"This ain't a hotel. You go on down the road. Inside eight miles you'll come to the town.\"  \"Eight miles!\"  \"That's nothing for a man to ride.\"  \"Not at all, if I had something to ride.\"  \"You ain't got a horse?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then how do you come here?\"  \"I walked.\"  If this sharpened her suspicions, it sharpened her fear also. She put one foot on the lowest step of the stairs.  \"Be off with you, Mr. Donnegally, or whatever your outlandish name is. You'll get nothing here. What brings you--\"  A door closed and a footstep sounded lightly on the floor above. And Donnegan, already alert in the strange atmosphere of this house, gave back a pace so as to get an honest wall behind him. He noted that the step was quick and small, and preparing himself to meet a wisp of manhood--which, for that matter, was the type he was most inclined to fear--Donnegan kept a corner glance upon the old woman at the foot of the stairs and steadily surveyed the shadows at the head of the rise.  Out of that darkness a foot slipped; not even a boy's foot--a very child's. The shock of it made Donnegan relax his caution for an instant, and in that instant she came into the reach of the light. It was a wretched light at best, for it came from a lamp with smoky chimney which the old hag carried, and at the raising and lowering of her hand the flame jumped and died in the throat of the chimney and set the hall awash with shadows. Falling away to a point of yellow, the lamp allowed the hall to assume a certain indefinite dignity of height and breadth and calm proportions; but when the flame rose Donnegan could see the broken balusters of the balustrade, the carpet, faded past any design and worn to rattiness, wall paper which had rotted or dried away and hung in crisp tatters here and there, and on the ceiling an irregular patch from which the plaster had fallen and exposed the lathwork. But at the coming of the girl the old woman had turned, and as she did the flame tossed up in the lamp and Donnegan could see the newcomer distinctly.  Once before his heart had risen as it rose now. It had been the fag end of a long party, and Donnegan, rousing from a drunken sleep, staggered to the window. Leaning there to get the freshness of the night air against his hot face, he had looked up, and saw the white face of the moon going up the sky; and a sudden sense of the blackness and loathing against the city had come upon Donnegan, and the murky color of his own life; and when he turned away from the window he was sober. And so it was that he now stared up at the girl. At her breast she held a cloak together with one hand and the other hand touched the railing of the stairs. He saw one foot suspended for the next step, as though the sight of him kept her back in fear. To the miserable soul of Donnegan she seemed all that was lovely, young, and pure; and her hair, old gold in the shadow and pale gold where the lamp struck it, was to Donnegan like a miraculous light about her face.  Indeed, that little pause was a great and awful moment. For considering that Donnegan, who had gone through his whole life with his eyes ready either to mock or hate, and who had rarely used his hand except to make a fist of it; Donnegan who had never, so far as is known, had a companion; who had asked the world for action, not kindness; this Donnegan now stood straight with his back against the wall, and poured out the story of his wayward life to a mere slip of a girl.     6   Even the old woman, whose eyes were sharpened by her habit of looking constantly for the weaknesses and vices of men, could not guess what was going on behind the thin, rather ugly face of Donnegan; the girl, perhaps, may have seen more. For she caught the glitter of his active eyes even at that distance. The hag began to explain with vicious gestures that set the light flaring up and down.  \"He ain't come from nowhere, Lou,\" she said. \"He ain't going nowhere; he wants to stay here for the night.\"  The foot which had been suspended to take the next step was now withdrawn. Donnegan, remembered at last, whipped off his cap, and at once the light flared and burned upon his hair. It was a wonderful red; it shone, and it had a terrible blood tinge so that his face seemed pale beneath it. There were three things that made up the peculiar dominance of Donnegan's countenance. The three things were the hair, the uneasy, bright eyes, and the rather thin, compressed lips. When Donnegan slept he seemed about to waken from a vigorous dream; when he sat down he seemed about to leap to his feet; and when he was standing he gave that impression of a poise which is ready for anything. It was no wonder that the girl, seeing that face and that alert, aggressive body, shrank a little on the stairs. Donnegan, that instant, knew that these two women were really alone in the house as far as fighting men were concerned.  And the fact disturbed him more than a leveled gun would have done. He went to the foot of the stairs, even past the old woman, and, raising his head, he spoke to the girl.  \"My name's Donnegan. I came over from the railroad--walked. I don't want to walk that other eight miles unless there's a real need for it. I--\" Why did he pause? \"I'll pay for anything I get here.\"  His voice was not too certain; behind his teeth there was knocking a desire to cry out to her the truth. \"I am Donnegan. Donnegan the tramp. Donnegan the shiftless. Donnegan the fighter. Donnegan the killer. Donnegan the penniless, worthless. But for heaven's sake let me stay until morning and let me look at you--from a distance!\"  But, after all, perhaps he did not need to say all these things. His clothes were rags, upon his face there was a stubble of unshaven red, which made the pallor about his eyes more pronounced. If the girl had been half blind she must have felt that here was a man of fire. He saw her gather the wrap a little closer about her shoulders, and that sign of fear made him sick at heart.  \"Mr. Donnegan,\" said the girl. \"I am sorry. We cannot take you into the house. Eight miles--\"  Did she expect to turn a sinner from the gates of heaven with a mere phrase? He cast out his hand, and she winced as though he had shaken his fist at her.  \"Are you afraid?\" cried Donnegan.  \"I don't control the house.\"  He paused, not that her reply had baffled him, but the mere pleasure of hearing her speak accounted for it. It was one of those low, light voices which are apt to have very little range or volume, and which break and tremble absurdly under any stress of emotion; and often they become shrill in a higher register; but inside conversational limits, if such a term may be used, there is no fiber so delightful, so purely musical. Suppose the word \"velvet\" applied to a sound. That voice came soothingly and delightfully upon the ear of Donnegan, from which the roar and rattle of the empty freight train had not quite departed. He smiled at her.  \"But,\" he protested, \"this is west of the Rockies--and I don't see any other way out.\"  The girl, all this time, was studying him intently, a little sadly, he thought. Now she shook her head, but there was more warmth in her voice.  \"I'm sorry. I can't ask you to stay without first consulting my father.\"  \"Go ahead. Ask him.\"  She raised her hand a little; the thought seemed to bring her to the verge of trembling, as though he were asking a sacrilege.  \"Why not?\" he urged.  She did not answer, but, instead, her eyes sought the old, woman, as if to gain her interposition; she burst instantly into speech.  \"Which there's no good talking any more,\" declared the ancient vixen. \"Are you wanting to make trouble for her with the colonel? Be off, young man. It ain't the first time I've told you you'd get nowhere in this house!\"  There was no possible answer left to Donnegan, and he did as usual the surprising thing. He broke into laughter of such clear and ringing tone--such infectious laughter--that the old woman blinked in the midst of her wrath as though she were seeing a new man, and he saw the lips of the girl parted in wonder.  \"My father is an invalid,\" said the girl. \"And he lives by strict rules. I could not break in on him at this time of the evening.\"  \"If that's all\"--Donnegan actually began to mount the steps--\"I'll go in and talk to your father myself.\"  She had retired one pace as he began advancing, but as the import of what he said became clear to her she was rooted to one position by astonishment.  \"Colonel Macon--my father--\" she began. Then: \"Do you really wish to see him?\"  The hushed voice made Donnegan smile--it was such a voice as one boy uses when he asks the other if he really dares enter the pasture of the red bull. He chuckled again, and this time she smiled, and her eyes were widened, partly by fear of his purpose and partly from his nearness. They seemed to be suddenly closer together. As though they were on one side against a common enemy, and that enemy was her father. The old woman was cackling sharply from the bottom of the stairs, and then bobbing in pursuit and calling on Donnegan to come back. At length the girl raised her hand and silenced her with a gesture.  Donnegan was now hardly a pace away; and he saw that she lived up to all the promise of that first glance. Yet still she seemed unreal. There is a quality of the unearthly about a girl's"]]]
