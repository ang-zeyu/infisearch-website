Thy city, which an offshoot is of him     Who first upon his Maker turned his back,     And whose ambition is so sorely wept,  Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower     Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray     Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.  For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors     Are derelict, and only the Decretals     So studied that it shows upon their margins.  On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;     Their meditations reach not Nazareth,     There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;  But Vatican and the other parts elect     Of Rome, which have a cemetery been     Unto the soldiery that followed Peter  Shall soon be free from this adultery.”     Paradiso: Canto X   Looking into his Son with all the Love     Which each of them eternally breathes forth,     The Primal and unutterable Power  Whate’er before the mind or eye revolves     With so much order made, there can be none     Who this beholds without enjoying Him.  Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels     With me thy vision straight unto that part     Where the one motion on the other strikes,  And there begin to contemplate with joy     That Master’s art, who in himself so loves it     That never doth his eye depart therefrom.  Behold how from that point goes branching off     The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,     To satisfy the world that calls upon them;  And if their pathway were not thus inflected,     Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,     And almost every power below here dead.  If from the straight line distant more or less     Were the departure, much would wanting be     Above and underneath of mundane order.  Remain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,     In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,     If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.  I’ve set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,     For to itself diverteth all my care     That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.  The greatest of the ministers of nature,     Who with the power of heaven the world imprints     And measures with his light the time for us,  With that part which above is called to mind     Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,     Where each time earlier he presents himself;  And I was with him; but of the ascending     I was not conscious, saving as a man     Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;  And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass     From good to better, and so suddenly     That not by time her action is expressed,  How lucent in herself must she have been!     And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,     Apparent not by colour but by light,  I, though I call on genius, art, and practice,     Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;     Believe one can, and let him long to see it.  And if our fantasies too lowly are     For altitude so great, it is no marvel,     Since o’er the sun was never eye could go.  Such in this place was the fourth family     Of the high Father, who forever sates it,     Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.  And Beatrice began: “Give thanks, give thanks     Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this     Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!”  Never was heart of mortal so disposed     To worship, nor to give itself to God     With all its gratitude was it so ready,  As at those words did I myself become;     And all my love was so absorbed in Him,     That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.  Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it     So that the splendour of her laughing eyes     My single mind on many things divided.  Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,     Make us a centre and themselves a circle,     More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.  Thus girt about the daughter of Latona     We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,     So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.  Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,     Are many jewels found, so fair and precious     They cannot be transported from the realm;  And of them was the singing of those lights.     Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,     The tidings thence may from the dumb await!  As soon as singing thus those burning suns     Had round about us whirled themselves three times,     Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,  Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,     But who stop short, in silence listening     Till they have gathered the new melody.  And within one I heard beginning: “When     The radiance of grace, by which is kindled     True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,  Within thee multiplied is so resplendent     That it conducts thee upward by that stair,     Where without reascending none descends,  Who should deny the wine out of his vial     Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not     Except as water which descends not seaward.  Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered     This garland that encircles with delight     The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.  Of the lambs was I of the holy flock     Which Dominic conducteth by a road     Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.  He who is nearest to me on the right     My brother and master was; and he Albertus     Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.  If thou of all the others wouldst be certain,     Follow behind my speaking with thy sight     Upward along the blessed garland turning.  That next effulgence issues from the smile     Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts     In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.  The other which near by adorns our choir     That Peter was who, e’en as the poor widow,     Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.  The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,     Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world     Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.  Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge     So deep was put, that, if the true be true,     To see so much there never rose a second.  Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,     Which in the flesh below looked most within     The angelic nature and its ministry.  Within that other little light is smiling     The advocate of the Christian centuries,     Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.  Now if thou trainest thy mind’s eye along     From light to light pursuant of my praise,     With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.  By seeing every good therein exults     The sainted soul, which the fallacious world     Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;  The body whence ’twas hunted forth is lying     Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom     And banishment it came unto this peace.  See farther onward flame the burning breath     Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard     Who was in contemplation more than man.  This, whence to me returneth thy regard,     The light is of a spirit unto whom     In his grave meditations death seemed slow.  It is the light eternal of Sigier,     Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,     Did syllogize invidious verities.”  Then, as a horologe that calleth us     What time the Bride of God is rising up     With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,  Wherein one part the other draws and urges,     Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,     That swells with love the spirit well disposed,  Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,     And render voice to voice, in modulation     And sweetness that can not be comprehended,  Excepting there where joy is made eternal.     Paradiso: Canto XI   O Thou insensate care of mortal men,     How inconclusive are the syllogisms     That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight!  One after laws and one to aphorisms     Was going, and one following the priesthood,     And one to reign by force or sophistry,  And one in theft, and one in state affairs,     One in the pleasures of the flesh involved     Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease;  When I, from all these things emancipate,     With Beatrice above there in the Heavens     With such exceeding glory was received!  When each one had returned unto that point     Within the circle where it was before,     It stood as in a candlestick a candle;  And from within the effulgence which at first     Had spoken unto me, I heard begin     Smiling while it more luminous became:  “Even as I am kindled in its ray,     So, looking into the Eternal Light,     The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend.  Thou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift     In language so extended and so open     My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain,  Where just before I said, ‘where well one fattens,’     And where I said, ‘there never rose a second;’     And here ’tis needful we distinguish well.  The Providence, which governeth the world     With counsel, wherein all created vision     Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom,  (So that towards her own Beloved might go     The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,     Espoused her with his consecrated blood,  Self-confident and unto Him more faithful,)     Two Princes did ordain in her behoof,     Which on this side and that might be her guide.  The one was all seraphical in ardour;     The other by his wisdom upon earth     A splendour was of light cherubical.  One will I speak of, for of both is spoken     In praising one, whichever may be taken,     Because unto one end their labours were.  Between Tupino and the stream that falls     Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,     A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs,  From which Perugia feels the cold and heat     Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep     Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.  From out that slope, there where it breaketh most     Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun     As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;  Therefore let him who speaketh of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1003"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Paradise (#7)"],["body","place,     Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,     But Orient, if he properly would speak.  He was not yet far distant from his rising     Before he had begun to make the earth     Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.  For he in youth his father’s wrath incurred     For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,     The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;  And was before his spiritual court     ‘Et coram patre’ unto her united;     Then day by day more fervently he loved her.  She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,     One thousand and one hundred years and more,     Waited without a suitor till he came.  Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas     Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice     He who struck terror into all the world;  Naught it availed being constant and undaunted,     So that, when Mary still remained below,     She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.  But that too darkly I may not proceed,     Francis and Poverty for these two lovers     Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.  Their concord and their joyous semblances,     The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,     They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;  So much so that the venerable Bernard     First bared his feet, and after so great peace     Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.  O wealth unknown! O veritable good!     Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester     Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride!  Then goes his way that father and that master,     He and his Lady and that family     Which now was girding on the humble cord;  Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow     At being son of Peter Bernardone,     Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;  But regally his hard determination     To Innocent he opened, and from him     Received the primal seal upon his Order.  After the people mendicant increased     Behind this man, whose admirable life     Better in glory of the heavens were sung,  Incoronated with a second crown     Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit     The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.  And when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,     In the proud presence of the Sultan preached     Christ and the others who came after him,  And, finding for conversion too unripe     The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,     Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,  On the rude rock ’twixt Tiber and the Arno     From Christ did he receive the final seal,     Which during two whole years his members bore.  When He, who chose him unto so much good,     Was pleased to draw him up to the reward     That he had merited by being lowly,  Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,     His most dear Lady did he recommend,     And bade that they should love her faithfully;  And from her bosom the illustrious soul     Wished to depart, returning to its realm,     And for its body wished no other bier.  Think now what man was he, who was a fit     Companion over the high seas to keep     The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.  And this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever     Doth follow him as he commands can see     That he is laden with good merchandise.  But for new pasturage his flock has grown     So greedy, that it is impossible     They be not scattered over fields diverse;  And in proportion as his sheep remote     And vagabond go farther off from him,     More void of milk return they to the fold.  Verily some there are that fear a hurt,     And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,     That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.  Now if my utterance be not indistinct,     If thine own hearing hath attentive been,     If thou recall to mind what I have said,  In part contented shall thy wishes be;     For thou shalt see the plant that’s chipped away,     And the rebuke that lieth in the words,  ‘Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.’”     Paradiso: Canto XII   Soon as the blessed flame had taken up     The final word to give it utterance,     Began the holy millstone to revolve,  And in its gyre had not turned wholly round,     Before another in a ring enclosed it,     And motion joined to motion, song to song;  Song that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,     Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,     As primal splendour that which is reflected.  And as are spanned athwart a tender cloud     Two rainbows parallel and like in colour,     When Juno to her handmaid gives command,  (The one without born of the one within,     Like to the speaking of that vagrant one     Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,)  And make the people here, through covenant     God set with Noah, presageful of the world     That shall no more be covered with a flood,  In such wise of those sempiternal roses     The garlands twain encompassed us about,     And thus the outer to the inner answered.  After the dance, and other grand rejoicings,     Both of the singing, and the flaming forth     Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,  Together, at once, with one accord had stopped,     (Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,     Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)  Out of the heart of one of the new lights     There came a voice, that needle to the star     Made me appear in turning thitherward.  And it began: “The love that makes me fair     Draws me to speak about the other leader,     By whom so well is spoken here of mine.  ’Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,     That, as they were united in their warfare,     Together likewise may their glory shine.  The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost     So dear to arm again, behind the standard     Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,  When the Emperor who reigneth evermore     Provided for the host that was in peril,     Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;  And, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour     With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word     The straggling people were together drawn.  Within that region where the sweet west wind     Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith     Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,  Not far off from the beating of the waves,     Behind which in his long career the sun     Sometimes conceals himself from every man,  Is situate the fortunate Calahorra,     Under protection of the mighty shield     In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.  Therein was born the amorous paramour     Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,     Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;  And when it was created was his mind     Replete with such a living energy,     That in his mother her it made prophetic.  As soon as the espousals were complete     Between him and the Faith at holy font,     Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,  The woman, who for him had given assent,     Saw in a dream the admirable fruit     That issue would from him and from his heirs;  And that he might be construed as he was,     A spirit from this place went forth to name him     With His possessive whose he wholly was.  Dominic was he called; and him I speak of     Even as of the husbandman whom Christ     Elected to his garden to assist him.  Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,     For the first love made manifest in him     Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.  Silent and wakeful many a time was he     Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,     As if he would have said, ‘For this I came.’  O thou his father, Felix verily!     O thou his mother, verily Joanna,     If this, interpreted, means as is said!  Not for the world which people toil for now     In following Ostiense and Taddeo,     But through his longing after the true manna,  He in short time became so great a teacher,     That he began to go about the vineyard,     Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;  And of the See, (that once was more benignant     Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,     But him who sits there and degenerates,)  Not to dispense or two or three for six,     Not any fortune of first vacancy,     ‘Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,’  He asked for, but against the errant world     Permission to do battle for the seed,     Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.  Then with the doctrine and the will together,     With office apostolical he moved,     Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;  And in among the shoots heretical     His impetus with greater fury smote,     Wherever the resistance was the greatest.  Of him were made thereafter divers runnels,     Whereby the garden catholic is watered,     So that more living its plantations stand.  If such the one wheel of the Biga was,     In which the Holy Church itself defended     And in the field its civic battle won,  Truly full manifest should be to thee     The excellence of the other, unto whom     Thomas so courteous was before my coming.  But still the orbit, which the highest part     Of its circumference made, is derelict,     So that the mould is where was once the crust.  His family, that had straight forward moved     With feet upon his footprints, are turned round     So that they set the point upon the heel.  And soon aware they will be of the harvest     Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares     Complain the granary is taken from them.  Yet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf     Our volume through, would still some page discover     Where he could read, ‘I am as I am wont.’  ’Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta,     From whence come such unto the written word     That one avoids it, and the other narrows.  Bonaventura of Bagnoregio’s life     Am I, who always in great offices     Postponed considerations sinister.
