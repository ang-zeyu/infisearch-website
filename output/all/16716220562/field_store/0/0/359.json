And if I only knew--\"  He paused at that, and looked searchingly and meaningly at Marshall Allerdyke before he continued. And Allerdyke looked back with the same intentness and nodded.  \"Yes--yes!\" he said. \"If you only knew--? Say it, doctor!\"  \"If I only knew if there was any reason why any person wished to take this man's life,\" responded Dr. Orwin, slowly and deliberately. \"If I knew that somebody wanted to get him out of the way, for instance--\"  Allerdyke jumped to his feet and tapped Fullaway on the shoulder.  \"Come in here a minute,\" he said, motioning towards the door of his bedroom. \"Excuse us, doctor--I want to have a word with this gentleman. Look here,\" he continued, when he had led the American into the bedroom and had closed the door. \"You hear what he says? Shall we tell him? Or shall we keep it all dark for a while? Which--what?\"  \"Tell him under promise of secrecy,\" replied Fullaway after a moment's consideration. \"Medical men are all right--yes, tell him. He may suggest something. And I'm inclined to think his theory is correct, eh?\"  \"Correct!\" exclaimed Allerdyke, with a grim laugh. \"You bet it's correct! Come on, then--we'll tell him all. Now, doctor,\" he went on, leading the way back into the sitting-room, \"we're going to give you our confidence. You'll treat it as a strict confidence, a secret between us, for the present. The truth is that when my cousin came to this hotel last night he was in possession--that is, we have the very strongest grounds for believing him to have been in possession--of certain extremely valuable property---jewels worth a large amount--which he was carrying, safeguarding, from a lady in Russia to this gentleman in London. When I searched his body and luggage, these valuables were missing. Mr. Fullaway and myself haven't the least doubt that he was robbed. So your theory--eh?\"  Dr. Orwin had listened to this with deep attention, and he now put two quick questions.  \"The value of these things was great?\"  \"Relatively, very great,\" answered Allerdyke.  \"Enough to engage, the attention of a clever gang of thieves?\"  \"Quite!\"  \"Then,\" said the doctor, \"I am quite of opinion that my ideas are correct. These, people probably tracked your cousin to this place, contrived to administer a subtle and deadly poison to him last night, and entered his room after the time at which they knew it would take effect. Have you any clue--even a slight one?\"  \"Only this,\" answered Allerdyke, and proceeded to narrate the story of the shoe-buckle, adding Fullaway's theory to it. \"That's not much, eh?\"  \"You must find that woman and produce her at the inquest,\" said the doctor. \"I take it that Mr. Fullaway's idea is a correct one. Your cousin probably did invite Miss Lennard into his room to show her these jewels--that, of course, would prove that he had them in his possession at some certain hour last night. Now, about that inquest. It is fixed for ten o'clock to-morrow morning. Let me advise you as to your own course of procedure, having an eye on what you have told me. Your object should be to make the proceedings to-morrow merely formal, so that the Coroner can issue his order for interment, and then adjourn for further evidence. It will be sufficient if you give evidence identifying the body, if evidence is given of the autopsy, and an adjournment asked for until a further examination of the reserved organs and viscera can be made. For the present, I should keep back the matter of the supposed robbery until you can find this Miss Lennard. At the adjourned inquest--say in a week or ten days hence--everything pertinent can be brought out. But you will need legal help--I am rather trespassing on legal preserves in telling you so much.\"  \"Deeply obliged to you, doctor--and you can add to our obigations by giving us the name of a good man to go to,\" said Allerdyke. \"We'll see him at once and fix things up for to-morrow morning.\"  Dr. Orwin wrote down the name and address of a well-known solicitor, and presently went away. When he had gone, Allerdyke turned to Fullaway.  \"Now, then,\" he said, \"you and I'll do one or two things. We'll call on this lawyer. Then we'll cable to the Princess. But how shall we get her address!\"  \"There's sure to be a Russian Consul in the town,\" suggested Fullaway.  \"Good idea! And I'm going to telephone to this Miss Lennard's address in London,\" continued Allerdyke. \"She evidently set off from here to Edinburgh; but, anyway, the address she gave in that wire to the manager is a London one, and I'm going to try it. Now let's get out and be at work.\"  The ensuing conversation between these two and a deeply interested and much-impressed solicitor resulted in the dispatch of a lengthy cablegram to St. Petersburg, a conversation over the telephone with the housekeeper of Miss Celia Lennard's London flat, and the interviewing of the captain and stewards of the steamship on which James Allerdyke had crossed from Christiania. The net result of this varied inquiry was small, and produced little that could throw additional light on the matter in question. The _Perisco_ officials had not seen anything suspicious in the conduct or personality of any of their passengers. They had observed James Allerdyke in casual conversation with some of them--they had seen him talking to Miss Lennard, to Dr. Lydenberg, to others, ladies and gentlemen who subsequently put up at the Station Hotel for the night. Nothing that they could tell suggested anything out of the common. Miss Lennard's housekeeper gave no other information than that her mistress was at present in Edinburgh, and was expected to remain there for at least a week. And towards night came a message from the Princess Nastirsevitch confirming Fullaway's conviction that James Allerdyke was in possession of her jewels and announcing that she was leaving for England at once, and should travel straight, via Berlin and Calais, to meet Mr. Franklin Fullaway at his hotel in London.  The solicitor agreed with Dr. Orwin's suggestions as to the course to be followed with regard to the inquest; it would be wise, he said, to keep matters quiet for at any rate a few days, until they were in a position to bring forward more facts. Consequently, the few people who were present at the Coroner's court next morning gained no idea of the real importance of the inquiry which was then opened. Even the solitary reporter who took a perfunctory note of the proceedings for his newspaper gathered no more from what he heard than that a gentleman had died suddenly at the Station Hotel, that it had been necessary to hold an inquest, that there was some little doubt as to the precise cause of his death, and that the inquest was accordingly adjourned until the medical men could tell something of a more definite nature. Nothing sensational crept out into the town; no bold-lettered headlines ornamented the afternoon editions. An hour before noon Marshall Allerdyke entrusted his cousin's body to the care of certain kinsfolk who had come over from Bradford to take charge of it; by noon he and Fullaway were slipping out of Hull on their way to Edinburgh--to search for a witness, who, if and when they found her, might be able to tell them--what?  \"Seems something like a wild-goose chase,\" said Allerdyke as the train steamed on across country towards York and the North. \"How do we know where to find this woman in Edinburgh? Her housekeeper didn't know what hotel she was at--I suppose we'll have to try every one in the place till we come across her!\"  \"Edinburgh is not a very big town,\" remarked Fullaway. \"I reckon to run her down--if she's still there--within a couple of hours. It's our first duty, anyway. If she--as I guess she did--saw those jewels, then we know that James Allerdyke had them on him when he reached Hull, dead sure.\"  \"And supposing she can tell that?\" said Allerdyke. \"What then? How does that help? The devils who got 'em have already had thirty-six hours' start of us!\"  The American produced a bulky cigar-case, found a green cigar, and lighted it with a deliberation which was in marked contrast to his usual nervous movements.  \"Seems to me,\" he said presently, \"seems very much to me that this has been a great thing! I figure it out like this--somehow, somebody has got to know of what the Princess and your cousin were up to--that he was going to carry those valuable jewels with him to England. He must have been tracked all the way, unless--does any unless strike you, now?\"  \"Not at the moment,\" replied Allerdyke. \"So unless what?\"  \"Unless the thieves--and murderers--were waiting there in Hull for his arrival,\" said Fullaway quietly. \"That's possible!\"  \"Strikes me a good many possibilities are knocking around,\" remarked Allerdyke, with more than his usual dryness. \"As for me, I'll want to know a lot about these valuables and their consignment before I make up my mind in any way. I tell you frankly. I'm not running after them--I'm wanting to find the folk who killed my cousin, and I only hope this young woman'll be able to give me a hand. And the sooner we get to the bottle of hay and begin prospecting for the needle the better!\"  But the search for Miss Celia Lennard to which Allerdyke alluded so gloomily was not destined to be either difficult or lengthy. As he and his companion walked along one of the platforms in the Waverley Station in Edinburgh that evening, on their way to a cab, Allerdyke suddenly uttered a sharp exclamation and seized the American by the elbow, twisting him round in front of a big poster which displayed the portrait of a very beautiful woman.  \"Good Lord!\" he exclaimed. \"There she is! See? That's the woman. Man alive, we've hit it at once! Look!\"  Fullaway turned and stared, not so much at the portrait as at the big lettering above and beneath it:          ZÉLIE DE LONGARDE,      THE WORLD-FAMED SOPRANO.   RECENTLY RETURNED FROM MOSCOW        AND ST. PETERSBURG."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10443"],["title","The Rayner-Slade Amalgamation (#8)"],["body","Visit to Edinburgh this Year.           TO-NIGHT AT 8.     CHAPTER VII  THE FRANTIC IMPRESARIO   Fullaway slowly read this announcement aloud. When he had made an end of it he laughed.  \"So your mysterious lady of the midnight motor, your Miss Celia Lennard of the Hull hotel, is the great and only Zélie de Longarde, eh?\" he said. \"Well, I guess that makes matters a lot easier and clearer. But you're sure it isn't a case of striking resemblance?\"  \"I only saw that woman for a minute or two, by moonlight, when she stuck her face out of her car to ask the way,\" replied Allerdyke, \"but I'll lay all I'm worth to a penny-piece that the woman I then saw is the woman whose picture we're staring at. Great Scott! So she's a famous singer, is she? You know of her, of course? That sort of thing's not in my line--never was--I don't go to a concert or a musical party once in five years.\"  \"Oh, she's great--sure!\" responded Fullaway. \"Beautiful voice--divine! And, as I say, things are going to be easy. I've met this lady more than once, though I didn't know that she'd any other name than that, which is presumably her professional one, and I've also had one or two business deals with her. So all we've got to do is to find out which hotel she's stopping at in this city, and then we'll go round there, and I'll send in my card. But I say--do you see, this affair's to-night, this very evening, and at eight o'clock, and it's past seven now. She'll be arraying herself for the platform. We'd better wait until--\"  Allerdyke's practical mind asserted itself. He twisted the American round in another direction, and called to a porter who had picked up their bags.  \"All that's easy,\" he said. \"We'll stick these things in the left-luggage spot, dine here in the station, and go straight to the concert. There, perhaps, during an interval, we might get in a word with this lady who sports two names. Come on, now.\"  He hurried his companion from the cloak-room to the dining-room, gave a quick order on his own behalf to the waiter, left Fullaway to give his own, and began to eat and drink with the vigour of a man who means to waste no time.  \"There's one thing jolly certain, my lad!\" he said presently, leaning confidentially across the table after he had munched in silence for a while. \"This Miss Lennard, or Mamselle, or Signora de Longarde, or whatever her real label is, hasn't got those jewels--confound 'em! Folks who steal things like that don't behave as she's doing.\"  \"I never thought she had stolen the jewels,\" answered Fullaway. \"What I want to know is--has she seen them, and when, and where, and under what circumstances? You've got her shoe-buckle all safe?\"  \"Waistcoat-pocket just now,\" replied Allerdyke laconically.  \"That'll be an extra passport,\" observed Fullaway. \"Not that it's needed, because, as I said, I've done business for her. Oddly enough, that was in the jewel line--I negotiated the sale of Pinkie Pell's famous pearl necklace with Mademoiselle de Longarde. You've heard of that, of course?\"  \"Never a whisper!\" answered Allerdyke. \"Not in my line, those affairs. Who was Pinkie Pell, anyhow!\"  \"Pinkie Pell was a well-known music-hall artiste, my dear sir, once a great favourite, who came down in the world, and had to sell her valuables,\" replied the American. \"To the last she stuck to a pearl necklace, which was said to have been given to her by the Duke of Bendlecombe--Pinkie, they said, attached a sentimental value to it. However, it had to be sold, and I sold it for Pinkie to the lady we're going to see to-night. Seven thousand five hundred--it's well worth ten. Mademoiselle will be wearing it, no doubt--she generally does, anyway--so you'll see it.\"  \"Not unless we get a front pew,\" said Allerdyke. \"Hurry up, and let's be off! Our best plan,\" he went on as they made for a cab, \"will be to get as near the platform as possible, so that I can make certain sure this is the woman I saw at Howden yesterday morning--when I positively identify her, I'll leave it to you to work the interview with her, either at this concert place or at her hotel afterwards. If it can be done at once, all the more to my taste--I want to be knowing things.\"  \"Oh, we're going well ahead!\" said Fullaway. \"I'll work it all right. I noticed on that poster that this affair is being run by the Concert-Director Ernest Weiss. I know Weiss--he'll get us an interview with the great lady after she's appeared the first time.\"  \"It's a fortunate thing for me to have a man who seems to know everybody,\" remarked Allerdyke. \"I suppose it's living in London gives you so much acquaintance?\"  \"It's my business to know a lot of people,\" answered Fullaway. \"The more the better--for my purposes. I'll tell you how I came to know your cousin later that's rather interesting. Well, here's the place, and it's five to eight now. We've struck it very well, and the only trouble'll be about getting good seats, especially as we're in morning dress.\"  Allerdyke smiled at that--in his opinion, money would carry a man anywhere, and there was always plenty of that useful commodity in his pockets. He insisted on buying the seats himself, and after some parleying and explaining at the box-office, he and his companion were duly escorted to seats immediately in front of a flower-decked platform, where they were set down amidst a highly select company of correctly attired folk, who glanced a little questioningly at their tweed suits, both conspicuous amidst silks, satins, broadcloths, and glazed linen. Allerdyke laughed as he thrust a program into Fullaway's hand.  \"I worked that all right,\" he whispered. \"Told the chap in that receipt of custom that you were a foreigner of great distinction travelling incognito in Scotland, and I your travelling companion, and that our luggage hadn't arrived from Aberdeen, so we couldn't dress, but we must hear this singing lady at all cost and in any case. Then I slapped down the brass and got the tickets--naught like brass in ready form, my lad! Now, then, when does the desired party appear?\"  Fullaway unfolded his program and glanced over the items. The Concert-Direction of Ernest Weiss was famous for the fare which it put before its patrons, and here was certainly enough variety of talent to please the most critical--a famous tenor, a popular violinist, a contralto much in favour for her singing of tender and sentimental songs, a notable performer on the violincello, a local vocalist whose speciality was the singing of ancient Scottish melodies, and--item of vast interest to a certain section of the audience--a youthful prodigy who was fondly believed to have it in her power to become a female Paderewski. These performers were duly announced on the program in terms of varying importance; outstanding from all of them, of course, was the great star of the evening, the one and only Zélie de Longarde, acknowledged Queen of Song in Milan and Moscow, Paris and London, New York and Melbourne.  \"Comes on fifth, I see,\" observed Allerdyke, glancing over his program unconcernedly. \"Well, I suppose we've got to stick out the other four. I'm not great on music, Fullaway--don't know one tune from another. However, I reckon I can stand a bit of noise until my lady shows herself.\"  He listened with good-natured interest, which was not far removed from indifference, to the contralto, the 'cellist, the violinist, only waking up to something like enthusiasm when the infant prodigy, a quaint, painfully shy little creature, who bobbed a side curtsey at the audience, and looked much too small to tackle the grand piano, appeared and proceeded to execute wonderful things with her small fingers.  \"That's a bit of all right!\" murmured Allerdyke, when the child had finished her first contribution. \"That's a clever little party! But she's too big in the eye, and too small in the bone--wants plenty of new milk, and new-laid eggs, and fresh air, and not so much piano-thumping, does that. Clever--clever--but unnatural, Fullaway!--they mustn't let her do too much at that. Well, now I suppose we shall see the shoe-buckle lady.\"  The packed audience evidently supposed the same thing. Over it--the infant prodigy having received her meed of applause and bobbed herself awkwardly out of sight--had come that atmosphere of expectancy which invariably heralds the appearance of the great figure on any similar occasion. It needed no special intuition on Allerdyke's part to know that all these people were itching to show their fondness for Zélie de Longarde by clapping their hands, waving their program, and otherwise manifesting their delight at once more seeing a prime favourite. All eyes were fixed on the wing of the platform, all hands were ready to give welcome. But a minute passed--two minutes--three minutes--and Zélie de Longarde did not appear. Another minute--and then, endeavouring to smile bravely and reassuringly, and not succeeding particularly well in the attempt, a tall, elaborately attired, carefully polished-up man, unmistakably German, blonde, heavy, suave, suddenly walked on to the platform and did obeisance to the audience.  \"Weiss!\" whispered Fullaway. \"Something's wrong! Look at his face--he's in big trouble.\"  The concert-director straightened himself from that semi-military bow, and looked at the faces in front of him with a mute appeal.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have to entreat the high favour of your kind indulgence. Mademoiselle de Longarde is not yet arrived from her hotel. I hope--I think--she is now on her way. In the meantime I propose, with your gracious consent, to continue, our program with the next item, at the conclusion of which, I hope, Mademoiselle will appear.\"  The audience was sympathetic--the audience was ready to be placated. It gave cordial hearing and warm favour to the singer of Scottish melodies--it even played into Mr. Concert-Director Weiss's hands by according the local singer an encore.
