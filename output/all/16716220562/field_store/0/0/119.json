For, as Mazzini once said, an Englishman's friendship, when once secured, holds very firm, but it is manifested more by deeds than by words. But Colonel Raven had the gift of sympathetic imagination, and he had also in full measure the Allied spirit.  The purpose of these Reconnaissances was twofold: first, to report on matters of military importance, any notable activity by the enemy, the direction and nature of hostile fire upon our trenches, the effects of our own fire, when not otherwise ascertainable, the precise position on the map, especially after any action, of our own and of the enemy's lines, including saps, advanced posts and the like; second, to maintain a real contact and spirit of comradeship with the Italian Infantry and to seek to give them confidence in the efficiency and promptitude of British Artillery support. Under the first head, valuable information was frequently brought back, and under the second I believe that, so far at least as our Group was concerned, the personal relations between the Artillery and the Infantry were exceptionally good. Hardly ever did we receive complaints that our guns were firing short, though such complaints are often made, and often quite groundlessly, when the Infantry lack confidence in the Artillery behind them.  At one time thin-skinned persons among us used to complain that Italians who passed them on the roads used to call out \"imboscato!\" Imboscato is a term very frankly used in the Italian army, generally though not necessarily as a term of reproach. It corresponds with the French \"embusqu√©,\" one who shelters in a wood, for which we in English have no precise equivalent. It is used by an Italian to indicate one who runs, or is thought to run, less risk of death than the speaker. It is chiefly used of men in the non-combatant services or in posts well behind the fighting front, including the Higher Staff and especially the junior ranks attendant on them. It is used also in jest by Italian patrols going out at night into No Man's Land, of their comrades, whom they leave behind in the front line trenches. Personally I was never called an imboscato, nor were any of my brother gunners, except once or twice when riding in side-cars or motors miles in rear of our guns. And to Infantry marching along dusty roads under an Italian sun there is something very irritating in a motor car dashing past, with its occupants reclining in easy positions, its siren hideously shrieking, and blinding dust-clouds rising in its wake.  German propaganda was insidiously active in Italy throughout the war, and spread many lying stories with the object of discrediting the British. Among these was one, the details of which do not matter now, concerning the fact that only British Artillery, and no British Infantry, had at that time been sent to Italy. Our Reconnaissances, involving our visible and daily presence among the gallant succession of Italian Brigades, who held the blood-stained line on the Carso and across the valley of the Vippacco, were the most fitting reply which we could make to German propaganda.         *       *       *       *       *  I made my first Front Line Reconnaissance on July 27th, two days after we had moved forward to our new Battery position. That day I visited the trenches on the Volconiac, starting in the early afternoon and getting back at nightfall. I took with me as a guide a young Italian gunner, a Neapolitan by birth, who had been a waiter in an Italian restaurant in New York before the war. He had been in the Austrian offensive of 1916 in the Trentino, where all the guns of his Battery had been lost and nearly all his comrades killed or captured.  From the Battery position we followed the road behind Hill 123, up a glorious valley, whose sides were thickly wooded with pines, gradually thinning under the destruction wrought by Austrian shell fire and the Italian military need for timber. The only other vegetation here was a little coarse grass. On the lee side of Hill 123, sheltered from Austrian fire, was a whole village of wooden huts, admirably constructed, capable of housing several Battalions. At the head of the valley, the road, a good example of the war work of the Italian Engineers, turned sharply up the hillside, securing tolerable gradients by means of constant zigzags--tolerable that is to say for men on foot and for pack mules, for wheeled transport could not proceed beyond this point. It was a steep climb and I perspired most visibly right through my thin tunic. Three-quarters of the way up we stopped and got a drink of water from the Infantrymen in charge of the water barrels. There are no springs or streams on the Volconiac or on Dosso Faiti. All water has to be pumped up from below through pipes, and at the point where we rested, water barrels were being continually filled from the pipes and then hauled on by hand, on sleighs, for the remainder of the ascent. Water was also carried up from this point by individual soldiers in the fiaschi, or glass bottles encased in plaited straw, in which Italian wine is sold.  Just below the crest we entered the trenches, which were held at this time by the Florence Brigade. The construction of these trenches was very interesting. They were all blasted in the rock, and many drilling machines were at work as I passed along them, increasing the number of _caverne_, or dug-outs, and deepening those already in existence. Here and there, where the trenches were rather shallow, they were built up with loose rocks and sandbags filled with stones.  One of my objects was to get a view of the Austrian trenches and barbed wire on the Tamburo, in order to observe from closer quarters than was possible from any of our O.P.'s the effects of our recent bombardments, and to verify or disprove a report that certain new defensive works were being constructed by the enemy at night. Our own trenches here were on a higher level than the enemy's, and the bottom of the valley between the Tamburo and this part of the Volconiac was in No Man's Land, as was a relatively short slope on the Tamburo and a relatively long slope on the Volconiac. The latter slope was very steep, but thickly clothed with pines, most of which were now shattered by shell fire into mere dead stumps. Even these stumps, however, made it difficult to get an uninterrupted view of the Tamburo, and I had to go some miles along the trenches, gazing through numerous peepholes, before I reached a point from which I could satisfy myself that our bombardments had been effective and that the reported new works were indeed real. Having got this information, I smoked a pipe and talked with an Italian company commander in a rocky dug-out, and then started to return.  Things were quiet on this sector of the Front that afternoon, though Italian Field Guns were bursting shrapnel from time to time over the Tamburo. As I went along the trenches I was several times greeted by Italians who had been in America, \"Hullo, John! How are you? How d'you like this dam country?\" This type brings back with it across the Atlantic the frank, almost brutal, familiarity of a new and democratic civilisation. It contrasts oddly with the quieter ways of those Italians who have lived all their lives in Italy, amid one of the oldest and most mature civilisations of the world.  On our way down the hill we passed a seemingly endless string of pack mules coming up, laden with food and ammunition. Always at evening this wonderful system of supply was visibly working, triumphing over tremendous natural difficulties. We passed, too, a party of about fifty men hauling up on long ropes a heavy drilling engine, the sort of labour of which British fatigue parties have, luckily for themselves, no experience. Mists came down from the mountains as we descended, and rainstorms threatened, but did not break.    CHAPTER IX  AN EVENING AT GORIZIA  On the first day in August I had been doing some observation at S. Andrea in the afternoon, and, this duty over, I got permission to walk into Gorizia and visit the section of the British Red Cross stationed there, several of whose members I knew. It is a longer walk than one would think, for S. Andrea is practically a southern suburb of Gorizia, which, however, straggles over a large area of country. The railway bridge across the Isonzo is broken down by shell fire and so are two other bridges,--all three of stone,--but these could be soon repaired, if we made a big advance. It would be wasted labour to repair them now, for the Austrians would only break them down again. The Italians have run up a low, broad wooden bridge, sheltered from Austrian view behind one of the broken stone bridges. From time to time the Austrians hit this bridge, and then the Italians quickly make it good again. To be able to cross the Isonzo at this point is a convenience, but not a military necessity, for all movement of troops and supplies into Gorizia can be carried out on the left bank of the river and across bridges some miles further down-stream.  The suburbs of the town were badly knocked about, but the centre was not at this time much damaged. Gorizia lies in a salient of the hills, with the Austrians looking down upon it from the tops of most of them. But, still hoping to win it back, they do not shell it heavily or often. There are special reasons, too, for their forbearance. For Gorizia is a sort of Austrian Cheltenham, whither Austrian officers retire in large numbers to pass their last years in villas which they take over from one another's widows. So the Austrian officer class has a sort of vested interest in the preservation of the place. So also have certain Hebrew Banks in Vienna, which hold mortgages on a great part of the land in and around the city, which just before the war was being rapidly developed as a fashionable Spa.

PREFATORY NOTE {1}    The following Sermons could not be arranged according to any proper  sequence.  Those, however, which refer to doctrine and the Church Seasons  will mostly be found at the beginning of the volume, whilst those which  deal with practical subjects are placed at the close.  A few of the Sermons have already appeared in \"Good Words;\" but by far  the greater number were never prepared by their author for the press.   They were written out very roughly--sometimes at an hour's notice, as  occasion demanded--and were only intended for delivery from the pulpit.  The original MSS. have been adhered to as closely as possible.  It is thought that many to whom the late Rector of Eversley was dear will  welcome the publication of these earnest words, and find them helpful in  the Christian life.  \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:  Yea, saith  the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do  follow them.\"    SERMON I.  ALL SAINTS' DAY    Westminster Abbey.  November 1, 1874.  Revelation vii. 9-12.  \"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,  which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and  tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white  robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying,  Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.   And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and  the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and  worshipped God, saying, Amen:  Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and  thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever  and ever.  Amen.\"  To-day is All Saints' Day.  On this day we commemorate--and, as far as  our dull minds will let us, contemplate--the saints; the holy ones of  God; the pure and the triumphant--be they who they may, or whence they  may, or where they may.  We are not bidden to define and limit their  number.  We are expressly told that they are a great multitude, which no  man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues;  and most blessed news that is for all who love God and man.  We are not  told, again--and I beg you all to mark this well--that this great  multitude consists merely of those who, according to the popular notion,  have \"gone to heaven,\" as it is called, simply because they have not gone  to hell.  Not so, not so!  The great multitude whom we commemorate on All  Saints' Day, are SAINTS.  They are the holy ones, the heroes and heroines  of mankind, the elect, the aristocracy of grace.  These are they who have  kept themselves unspotted from the world.  They are the pure who have  washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, which  is the spirit of self-sacrifice.  They are those who carry the palm- branch of triumph, who have come out of great tribulation, who have  dared, and fought, and suffered for God, and truth, and right.  Nay,  there are those among them, and many, thank God--weak women, too, among  them--who have resisted unto blood, striving against sin.  And who are easy-going folk like you and me, that we should arrogate to  ourselves a place in that grand company?  Not so!  What we should do on  All Saints' Day is to place ourselves, with all humility, if but for an  hour, where we can look afar off upon our betters, and see what they are  like, and what they do.  And what are they like, those blessed beings of whom the text speaks?   The Gospel for this day describes them to us; and we may look on that  description as complete, for He who gives it is none other than our Lord  Himself.  \"Blessed are the poor in spirit; for their's is the kingdom of  heaven.  Blessed are they that mourn:  for they shall be comforted.   Blessed are the meek:  for they shall inherit the earth.  Blessed are  they who hunger and thirst after righteousness:  for they shall be  filled.  Blessed are the merciful:  for they shall obtain mercy.  Blessed  are the pure in heart:  for they shall see God.  Blessed are the peace- makers:  for they shall be called the children of God.  Blessed are they  which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:  for their's is the kingdom  of heaven.  Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,  and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.   Rejoice, and be exceeding glad:  for great is your reward in heaven.\"  This is what they are like; and what we, I fear, too many of us, are not  like.  But in proportion as we grow like them, by the grace of God, just  so far shall we enter into the communion of saints, and understand the  bliss of that everlasting All Saints' Day which St John saw in heaven.  And what do they do, those blessed beings?  Whatever else they do, or do  not do, this we are told they do--they worship.  They satisfy, it would  seem, in perfection, that mysterious instinct of devotion--that inborn  craving to look upward and adore, which, let false philosophy say what it  will, proves the most benighted idolater to be a man, and not a brute--a  spirit, and not a merely natural thing.  They have worshipped, and so are blest.  They have hungered and thirsted  after righteousness, and now they are filled.  They have longed for,  toiled for, it may be died for, the true, the beautiful, and the good;  and now they can gaze upward at the perfect reality of that which they  saw on earth, only as in a glass darkly, dimly, and afar; and can  contemplate the utterly free, the utterly beautiful, and the utterly good  in the character of God and the face of Jesus Christ.  They entered while  on earth into the mystery and the glory of self-sacrifice; and now they  find their bliss in gazing on the one perfect and eternal sacrifice, and  rejoicing in the thought that it is the cause and ground of the whole  universe, even the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world.  I say not that all things are clear to them.  How can they be to any  finite and created being?  They, and indeed angels and archangels, must  walk for ever by faith, and not by sight.  But if there be mysteries in  the universe still hidden from them, they know who has opened the sealed  book of God's secret counsels, even the Lamb who is the Lion, and the  Lion who is the Lamb; and therefore, if all things are not clear to them,  all things at least are bright, for they can trust that Lamb and His  self-sacrifice.  In Him, and through Him, light will conquer darkness,  justice injustice, truth ignorance, order disorder, love hate, till God  be all in all, and pain and sorrow and evil shall have been exterminated  out of a world for which Christ stooped to die.  Therefore they worship;  and the very act of worship--understand it well--is that great reward in  heaven which our Lord promised them.  Adoration is their very bliss and  life.  It must be so.  For what keener, what nobler enjoyment for  rational and moral beings, than satisfaction with, and admiration of, a  Being better than themselves?  Therefore they worship; and their worship  finds a natural vent in words most fit though few, but all expressing  utter trust and utter satisfaction in the worthiness of God.  Therefore  they worship; and by worship enter into communion and harmony not only  with each other, not only with angels and archangels, but with all the  powers of nature, the four beings which are around the throne, and with  every creature which is in heaven and in earth, and under the earth, and  in the sea.  For them, likewise, St John heard saying, \"Blessing and  glory, and honour, and power, be unto Him that sitteth on the throne, and  to the Lamb for ever and ever.\"  And why?  I think, with all humility, that the key to all these hymns-- whether of angels or of men, or of mere natural things--is the first hymn  of all; the hymn which shows that, however grateful to God for what He  has done for them those are whom the Lamb has redeemed by His blood to  God, out of every kindred, and nation, and tongue; yet, nevertheless, the  hymn of hymns is that which speaks not of gratitude, but of absolute  moral admiration--the hymn which glorifies God, not for that which He is  to man, not for that which He is to the universe, but for that which He  is absolutely and in Himself--that which He was before all worlds, and  would be still, though the whole universe, all created things, and time,  and space, and matter, and every created spirit likewise, should be  annihilated for ever.  And what is that?  \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.\"  Ah! what a Gospel lies within those words!  A Gospel?  Ay, if you will  receive it, the root of all other possible Gospels, and good news for all  created beings.  What a Gospel! and what an everlasting fount of comfort!   Surely of those words it is true, \"blessed are they who, going through  the vale of misery, find therein a well, and the pools are filled with  water.\"  Know you not what I mean?  Happier, perhaps, are you--the young  at least among you--if you do not know.  But some of you must know too  well.  It is to them I speak.  Were you never not merely puzzled--all  thinking men are that--but crushed and sickened at moments by the mystery  of evil?  Sickened by the follies, the failures, the ferocities, the  foulnesses of mankind, for ages upon ages past?  Sickened by the sins of  the unholy many--sickened, alas! by the imperfections even of the holiest  few?  And have you never cried in your hearts with longing, almost with  impatience, Surely, surely, there "]]]
