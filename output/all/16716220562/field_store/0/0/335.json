The Admiralty therefore necessarily assumed the duty, whilst supplying each command with all the information required for operations. The general lines of the Staff organizations at the War Office and at General Headquarters in France are here given for the sake of comparison with the Naval Staff organization.  1.--_The British War Office._  The approximate organization is shown as concisely as possible in the following diagram:    CHIEF OF IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF       Director of Staff Duties.           Staff duties Organization and training.           War Organization of forces.           General questions of training.           Signals and communications.       Director of Military Operations.           Operations on all fronts.       Director of Military Intelligence.           Intelligence.           Espionage.           The Press.  The other important departments of the War Office on the administration side are those of the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General, the former dealing with all questions relating to the personnel of the Army under the various headings of organization, mobilization, pay and discipline, and the latter with all questions of supply and transport.  A Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff was attached to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. His main duty was to act as a liaison between the General Staff and the administrative departments of the War Office.  The whole organization of the British War Office is, of course, under the direction and control of the Secretary of State for War.  2.--_The Staff Organization at General Headquarters in France._    FIELD MARSHAL   COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

(BUT NOT STAFF OFFICERS.)                                     |           ----------------------------------------------------           |                         |                        |   Artillery Adviser          Engineer-in-Chief.

Artillery matters   and operations).          |   Advises Administrative   Departments as   necessary.  N.B.--The Inspector of Training works in consultation with the Chief of the General Staff.  It will be seen that whilst at the War Office the liaison between the General Staff and the administrative side was maintained by a Deputy Chief of the General Staff, in the organization in the field the same function was performed by the Staff Officer known as G.S. (b).  It will also be seen that neither at General Headquarters nor in the case of an Army command does the Chief of the General Staff exercise control over the administrative side.  After some discussion the Admiralty organizations shown in the Tables A and B on page 20 (below) were adopted, and I guarded as far as possible against the objection to keeping the Plans Division separate from the Operations Division by the issue of detailed orders as to the conduct of the business of the Staff, in which directions were given that the Director of the Plans Division should be in close touch with the Director of the Operations Division before submitting any proposals to the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff or myself.  During the remainder of my service at the Admiralty the organization remained as shown in Tables A and B on p. 20 below. It was not entirely satisfactory, for reasons already mentioned and because I did not obtain all the relief from administrative work which was so desirable.

Early in 1918, after my departure from the Admiralty, the following announcement appeared in the Press:   The _Secretary of the Admiralty makes the following announcement_:--  The Letters Patent for the new Board of Admiralty having now been issued, it may be desirable to summarize the changes in the personnel of the Board and to indicate briefly the alterations in organization that have been decided upon.  Acting Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Oliver now brings to a close his long period of valuable service on the Naval Staff and will take up a sea-going command, being succeeded as D.C.N.S. by Rear-Admiral Sydney Fremantle. Rear-Admiral George P.W. Hope has been selected for the appointment of Deputy First Sea Lord, formerly held by Admiral Wemyss, but with changed functions. Commodore Paine, Fifth Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Air Service, leaves the Board of Admiralty in consequence of the recent creation of the Air Council, of which he is now a member, and formal effect is now given to the appointment of Mr. A.F. Pease as Second Civil Lord, which was announced on Thursday last.  In view of the formal recognition now accorded, as explained by the First Lord in his statement in the House of Commons on the 1st November, to the principle of the division of the work of the Board under the two heads of Operations and Maintenance, the Members of the new Board (other than the First Lord) may be grouped as follows:--       OPERATIONS.                             MAINTENANCE.   First Sea Lord                      Second Sea Lord.   and                                 (Vice-Admiral Sir H.L. Heath.)   Chief of Naval Staff.   (Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss.)    Deputy Chief of Naval Staff.        Third Sea Lord.   (Rear-Admiral S.R. Fremantle.)      (Rear-Admiral L. Halsey.)   Assistant Chief of Naval Staff.     Fourth Sea Lord.   (Rear-Admiral A.L. Duff.)           (Rear-Admiral H.H.D.                                       Tothill.)    Deputy First Sea Lord.              Civil Lord.   (Rear-Admiral G.P.W. Hope.)         (Right Hon. E.G. Pretyman,                                       M.P.)                                        Controller.                                       (Sir A.G. Anderson.)                                        Second Civil Lord.                                       (Mr. A.F. Pease.)                 Financial Secretary.                (Right Hon. T.J. Macnamara, M.P.)                 Permanent Secretary.                (Sir O. Murray.)  The principle of isolating the work of planning and directing naval war operations from all other work, in order that it may receive the entire attention of the Officers selected for its performance, is now being carried a stage further and applied systematically to the organization of the Operations side of the Board and that of the Naval Staff.  In future the general distribution of duties between the Members of the Board belonging to the Naval Staff will be as follows:--    FIRST SEA LORD AND CHIEF   Naval policy and general direction   OF NAVAL STAFF                of operations.    DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL      War operations in Home   STAFF                         Waters.    ASSISTANT CHIEF OF NAVAL   Trade Protection and   STAFF                         anti-submarine operations.    DEPUTY FIRST SEA LORD      General policy questions and                                 operations outside Home                                 Waters.  The detailed arrangements have been carefully worked out so as to relieve the first three of these officers of the necessity of dealing with any questions not directly connected with the main operations of the war, and the great mass of important paper work and administrative detail which is inseparably and necessarily connected with Staff work, but which has hitherto tended to compete for attention with Operations work generally will under the new organization be diverted to the Deputy First Sea Lord.  The grouping of the Directors of the Naval Staff Divisions will be governed by the same principle.  The only two Directors that will work immediately under the First Sea Lord will be the Director of Intelligence Division (Rear-Admiral Sir Reginald Hall) and the Director of Training and Staff Duties (Rear-Admiral J. C. Ley), whose functions obviously affect all the other Staff Divisions alike.  Under the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff will be grouped three Directors whose duties will relate entirely to the planning and direction of operations in the main sphere of naval activity, viz.:--    Director of Operations Division    Captain A.D.P. Pound.   (Home)    Director of Plans Division         Captain C.T.M. Fuller,                                          C.M.G., D.S.O.    Director of Air Division           Wing Captain F.R. Scarlett,                                             D.S.O.  together with the Director of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10409"],["title","The Crisis of the Naval War (#5)"],["body","Division, Acting-Captain R.L. Nicholson, D.S.O., whose duties relate to the system of Fleet communications.  Under the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff will be grouped four Directors, whose duties relate to Trade Protection and Anti-Submarine Operations, viz:--    Director of Anti-Submarine          Captain W.W. Fisher, C.B.     Division   Director  of Mine-sweeping          Captain L.G. Preston, C.B.     Division   Director of Mercantile Movements    Captain F.A. Whitehead.     Division   Director of Trade Division          Captain A.G. Hotham.  Under the Deputy First Sea Lord there will be one _Director of Operations Division (Foreign)_--Captain C.P.R. Coode, D.S.O.  The chief change on the Maintenance side of the Board relates to the distribution of duties amongst the Civil Members. The continuance of the war has caused a steady increase in the number of cases in which necessary developments of Admiralty policy due to the war, or experience resulting from war conditions give rise to administrative problems of great importance and complexity, of which a solution will have to be forthcoming either immediately upon or very soon after the conclusion of the war. The difficulty of concentrating attention on these problems of the future in the midst of current administrative work of great urgency may easily be appreciated, and the Civil Lord has consented to take charge of this important matter, with suitable naval and other assistance. He will, therefore, be relieved by the Second Civil Lord of the administration of the programme of Naval Works, including the questions of priority of labour and material requirements arising therefrom and the superintendence of the Director of Works Department.  It has further been decided that the exceptional labour and other difficulties now attending upon the execution of the very large programme of urgent naval works in progress have so greatly transformed the functions of the Director of Works Department of the Admiralty that it is desirable, whilst these abnormal conditions last, to place that Department under the charge of an expert in the rapid execution of large engineering works.  The Army Council have consented, at the request of the First Lord of the Admiralty, to lend for this purpose the services of Colonel Alexander Gibb, K.B.E., C.B., R.E., Chief Engineer, Port Construction, British Armies in France. Colonel Gibb (of the Firm of Easton, Gibb, Son and Company, which built Rosyth Naval Base) will have the title of Civil Engineer-in-Chief, and will be assisted by the Director of Works, who retains his status as such, and the existing Staff of the Department, which will be strengthened as necessary.  Another important change has reference to the organization of the Admiralty Board of Invention and Research, and has the object at once of securing greater concentration of effort in connection with scientific research and experiment, and ensuring that the distinguished scientists who are giving their assistance to the Admiralty are more constantly in and amongst the problems upon which they are advising.  Mr. Charles H. Merz, M.Inst.C.E., the well-known Electrical Consulting Engineer, who has been associated with the Board of Invention and Research (B.I.R.) since its inception, has consented to serve as Director of Experiments and Research (unpaid) at the Admiralty to direct and supervise all the executive arrangements in connection with the organization of scientific Research and Experiments. Mr. Merz will also be a member of the Central Committee of the B.I.R. under the presidency of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher. The functions of the Central Committee will, as hitherto, be to initiate, investigate, develop and advise generally upon proposals in respect to the application of Science and Engineering to Naval Warfare, but the distinguished scientific experts at present giving their services will in future work more much closely with the Technical Departments of the Admiralty immediately concerned with the production and use of apparatus required for specific purposes.  The general arrangements in regard to the organization of scientific research and experiment will in future come under the direct supervision of the First Lord.   Possibly by reason of the manner in which the announcement was made, the Press appeared to assume that the whole of this Admiralty organization was new. Such was not the case. Apart from the changes in the personnel of the Board itself and a slight rearrangement of their duties and those due to the establishment of an Air Ministry (which had been arranged by the Cabinet before December, 1917), there were but slight alterations in the organization shown in Table A [above], as will be seen by comparing it with Table C on p. 27 [below], which indicates graphically the organization given in the Admiralty communique.                TABLE C    FIRST SEA LORD AND CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF.    Deputy Chief of Naval Staff.       Director of Signals  Division.       Director of Operations Division (Home).       Director of Plans Division.       Director of Air Division.    Deputy First Sea Lord.       Director of Operations Division (Foreign) and       Administrative detail work.    Director of Intelligence Division.   Director of Training and Staff Duties.    Assistant  Chief of Naval Staff.     Director of Trade Division.     Director of Mercantile Movements.     Director of Mine-sweeping.     Director of Anti-Submarine Division.  It will be seen that the alterations in Naval Staff organization were as follows:  (a) The new Deputy First Sea Lord--Rear-Admiral Hope--who since the spring of 1917 had been Director of the Operations Division, was given the responsibility for operations in foreign waters, with a Director of Operations (foreign) under him, and was also definitely charged with the administrative detail involving technical matters. The special gifts, experience and aptitude of this particular officer for such work enabled him, no doubt, to relieve the pressure on the First Sea Lord for administrative detail very materially.  (b) The Operations Division was separated into two parts (home and foreign), with a Director for each, instead of there being a Deputy Director for home and an Assistant Director for foreign work, both working under the Director. This was a change in name only, as the same officer continued the foreign work under the new arrangement.  (c) The Director of the Intelligence Division and the Director of Training and Staff Duties were shown as working immediately under the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff.  (d) A Director of the Air Division was introduced as a result of the Naval Air Service having been separated from the Admiralty and placed under the Air Ministry. A larger Admiralty Staff organization for aerial matters thus became necessary, since the Staff could no longer refer to the Naval Air Service.  There were no other changes in the Staff organization. As regards the general Admiralty organization, there was no change except that caused by the disappearance of the separate Naval Air Service, the addition of a Second Civil Lord, and some reorganization of the Board of Invention and Research which had been under discussion for some months previously.  It is probable that in 1918 the Chief of the Naval Staff had more time at his disposal than was the case in 1917, owing to the changes in organization initiated in the later year having reached some finality and to the fact that the numerous anti-submarine measures put in hand in 1917 had become effective in 1918.  The future Admiralty Naval Staff organization, which was in my mind at the end of 1917, was a development of that shown in Table A, p. 20, subject to the following remarks:  In the organization then adopted the personality and experience during the war of many of the officers in high positions were of necessity considered, and the organization to that extent adapted to circumstances. This resulted in somewhat overloading the staff at the head, and the principle on which the Board of Admiralty works, i.e., that its members are colleagues one of another, and seniority in rank does not, theoretically, give greater weight in council, was not altogether followed. Thus the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff, and the Deputy First Sea Lord were, by the nature of their duties, subordinate to the Chief of the Naval Staff and yet were members of the Board. The well-known loyalty of naval officers to one another tended to minimize any difficulties that might have arisen from this anomaly, but the arrangement might conceivably give rise to difficulty, and is best avoided if the Board system is to remain.  The situation would be clearer if two of the three officers concerned were removed altogether from the Board, viz., the Deputy First Sea Lord and the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff, leaving only the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff as a member of the Board to act in the absence of the Chief of the Naval Staff and to relieve him of the administrative and technical work not immediately connected with operations.  The work of the two officers thus removed should, under these conditions, be undertaken by officers who should preferably be Flag Officers, with experience in command at sea, having the titles of Directors of Operations, whose emoluments should be commensurate with their position and responsibilities.  I did not consider it advisable to carry out this alteration during the war, and it was also difficult under the hour to hour stress of war to rearrange all the duties of the Naval Staff in the manner most convenient to the conduct of Staff business, although its desirability was recognized during 1917.  It may be as well to close this chapter by a few remarks on Staff work generally in the Navy. In the first place it is necessary in the Navy to give much weight to the opinions of specialist officers, and for this"]]]
