No, my good friends, obey the wise man, and clear your minds of cant-- man's pretensions, man's boastfulness, man's power of blinding his own  eyes to plain facts--above all, to the plain fact that he does not  succeed, even in this world of which he fancies himself the master,  because he lives without God in the world.  All this saddens, I had  almost said, sickens, a thoughtful man, till he turns away from this  noisy sham improvement of mankind--the wages of sin, which are death, to  St John's account of the true improvement of mankind, the true progress  of the species,--the gift of God which is eternal life.  \"And I saw a new  heaven and a new earth:  for the first heaven and the first earth were  passed away.  And I saw the Holy City--New Jerusalem, coming down from  God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  And I  heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle of God  is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people,  and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.  And God shall wipe  away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither  sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain:  for the former  things are passed away.\"  Does that sound much like a general increase of armaments? or like bills  for the prevention of pestilence, or of drunkenness,--which, even if they  pass, will both probably fail to do the good which they propose?  No.   And if this wicked world is to be mended, then God must stir up the wills  of His faithful people, and we must pray without ceasing for ourselves,  and for all for whom we are bound to pray, that He would stir them up.   For what we want is not knowledge; we have enough of that, and too much.   Too much; for knowing so much and doing so little, what an account will  be required of us at the last day!  No.  It is the will which we want, in a hundred cases.  Take that of  pestilential dwelling-houses in our great towns.  Every one knows that  they ought to be made healthy; every one knows that they can be made  healthy.  But the will to make them healthy is not here, and they are  left to breed disease and death.  And so, as in a hundred instances,  shallow philosophers are proved, by facts, to be mistaken, when they tell  us that man will act up to the best of his knowledge without God's help.   For that is exactly what man does not.  What is wrong with the world in  general, is wrong likewise more or less with you and me, and with all  human beings; for after all, the world is made up of human beings; and  the sin of the world is nothing save the sins of each and all human  beings put together; and the world will be renewed and come right again,  just as far and no farther, as each human being is renewed and comes  right.  The only sure method, therefore, of setting the world right, is  to begin by setting our own little part of the world right--in a word,  setting ourselves right.  But if we begin to try, that, we find, is just what we cannot do.  When a  man begins to hunger and thirst after righteousness, and, discontented  with himself, attempts to improve himself, he soon begins to find a  painful truth in many a word of the Bible and the Prayer Book to which he  gave little heed, as long as he was contented with himself, and with  doing just what pleased him, right or wrong.  He soon finds out that he  has no power of himself to help himself, that he is tied and bound with  the burden of his sins, and that he cannot, by reason of his frailty,  stand upright--that he actually is sore let and hindered by his own sins,  from running the race set before him, and doing his duty where God has  put him.  All these sayings come home to him as actual facts, most  painful facts, but facts which he cannot deny.  He soon finds out the  meaning and the truth of that terrible struggle between the good in him  and the evil in him, of which St Paul speaks so bitterly in the text.   How, when he tries to do good, evil is present with him.  How he delights  in the law of God with his inward mind, and yet finds another law in his  body, warring against the law of God, and bringing him into captivity to  the law of sin.  How he is crippled by old bad habits, weakened by  cowardice, by laziness, by vanity, by general inability of will, till he  is ready,--disgusted at himself and his own weakness,--to cry, Who shall  deliver me from the body of this death?  Let him but utter that cry honestly.  Let him once find out that he wants  something outside himself to help him, to deliver him, to strengthen him,  to stir up his weak will, to give him grace and power to do what he knows  instead of merely admiring it, and leaving it undone.  Let a man only  find out that.  Let him see that he needs a helper, a deliverer, a  strengthener--in one word, a Saviour--and he will find one.  I verily  believe that, sooner or later, the Lord Jesus Christ will reveal to that  man what He revealed to St Paul; that He Himself will deliver him; and  that, like St Paul, after crying \"O wretched man that I am, who shall  deliver me from the body of this death?\" he will be able to answer  himself, I thank God--God will, through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Christ  will deliver me from the bonds of my sins, Christ will stir up this weak  will of mine, Christ will give me strength and power, faithfully to  fulfil all my good desires, because He Himself has put them into my heart  not to mock me, not to disappoint me--not to make me wretched with the  sight of noble graces and virtues to which I cannot attain, but to fulfil  His work in me.  What He has begun in me He will carry on in me.  He has  sown the seed in me, and He will make it bear fruit, if only I pray to  Him, day by day, for strength to do what I know I ought to do, and cry  morning and night to Him, the fount of life, Stir up my will, O Lord,  that I may bring forth the fruit of good works, for then by Thee I shall  be plentifully rewarded.  So the man gains hope and heart for himself, and so, if he will but think  rationally and humbly, he may gain hope and heart for this poor sinful  world.  For what has come true for him may come true for any man.  Who is  he that God should care more for him than for others?  Who is he that God  should help him when he prays, more than He will help His whole church if  it will but pray?  He says to himself, all this knowledge of what is  right; all these good desires, all these longings after a juster, purer,  nobler, happier state of things; there they are up and down the world  already, though, alas! they have borne little enough fruit as yet.  Be it  so.  But God put them into my heart.  And who save God has put them into  the world's heart?  It was God who sowed the seed in me; surely it is God  who has sowed it in other men?  And if God has made it bear even the  poorest fruit in me, why should He not make it bear fruit in other men  and in all the world?  All they need is that God should stir up their  wills, that they may do the good they know, and attain the blessedness  after which they long.  And then, if the man have a truly human, truly reasonable heart in him-- he feels that he can pray for others as well as for himself.  He feels  that he must pray for them, and cry,--Thou alone canst make men strong to  do the right thing, and Thou wilt make them.  Stir up their wills, O  Lord!  Thou canst not mean that all the good seed which is sown about the  world should die and wither, and bring no fruit to perfection.  Surely  Thy word will not return to Thee void, but be like the rain which comes  down from heaven, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater.   Oh, strengthen such as stand, and comfort and help the weak-hearted, and  raise up them that fall, and, finally, beat down Satan and all the powers  of evil under our feet, and pour out thy spirit on all flesh, that so  their Father's name may be hallowed, His kingdom come, His will be done  on earth as it is in heaven.  And so will come the one and only true  progress of the human race--which is, that all men should become faithful  and obedient citizens of the holy city, the kingdom of God, which is the  Church of Christ.  To which may God in His mercy bring us all, and our  children after us.  Amen.  This, then, is the lesson why we are met together this Advent day.  We  are met to pray that God would so help us by His grace and mercy that we  may bring forth the fruit of good works, and that when our Lord Jesus  Christ shall come in His glorious majesty to judge the quick and the  dead, we, and our descendants after us, may be found an acceptable people  in His sight.  We are met to pray, in a National Church, for the whole nation of  England, that all orders and degrees therein may, each in his place and  station, help forward the hallowing of God's name, the coming of His  kingdom, the doing of His will on earth.  We are met to pray for the  Queen and all that are in authority, that these Advent collects may be  fulfilled in them, and by them, for the good of the whole people; for the  ministers and stewards of Christ's mysteries, that the same collects may  be fulfilled by them and in them, till they turn the hearts of the  disobedient to the wisdom of the just; for the Commons of this nation,  that each man may he delivered, by God's grace and mercy, from the  special sin which besets him in this faithless and worldly generation and  hinders him from running the race of duty which is set before him, and  get strength from God so to live that in that dread day he may meet his  Judge and King, not in tenor and in shame, but in loyalty and in humble  hope.  But more--we are here to worship God in Christ, both God and man.  To  confess that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10116"],["title","All Saints' Day and Other Sermons (#8)"],["body","Him we can do nothing, that unless He enlighten our  understandings we are dark, unless He stir up our wills we are powerless  for good.  To confess that though we have forgotten Him, yet He has not  forgotten us.   That He is the same gracious and generous Giver and  Saviour.  That though we deny Him He cannot deny Himself.  That He is the  same yesterday, to-day, and for ever as when He came to visit this earth  in great humility.  That the Lord is King, though the earth be moved.  He  sitteth upon His throne, be the nations never so unquiet.  We are here to  declare to ourselves and all men, and the whole universe, that we at  least believe that the heavens and earth are full of His glory.  We are  here to declare that, whether or not the kings of the earth are wise  enough, or the judges of it learned enough, to acknowledge Christ for  their king, we at least will worship the Son lest He be angry, and so we  perish from the right way; for if His wrath be kindled, yea but a little,  then blessed are they, and they only, who put their trust in Him.  We are  here to join our songs with angels round the throne, and with those pure  and mighty beings who, in some central sanctuary of the universe, cry for  ever, \"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power:   for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were  created.\"  We do so in ancient words, ancient music, ancient ceremonies, for a token  that Christ's rule and glory is an ancient rule and an eternal glory;  that it is no new discovery of our own, and depends not on our own  passing notions and feelings about it, but is like Christ, the same now  as in the days of our forefathers, the same as it was fifteen hundred  years ago, the same as it has been since the day that He stooped to be  born of the Virgin Mary, the same that it will be till He shall come in  His glory to judge the quick and the dead.  Therefore we delight in the  ancient ceremonial, as like as we can make it, to that of the earlier and  purer ages of the Church, when Christianity was still, as it were, fresh  from the hand of its Creator, ere yet it had been debased and defiled by  the idolatrous innovations of the Church of Rome.  For so we confess  ourselves bound by links of gratitude to the Apostles, and the successors  of the Apostles, and to all which has been best, purest, and truest in  the ages since.  So we confess that we worship the same God-man of whom  Apostles preached, of whom fathers philosophised, and for whom martyrs  died.  That we believe, like them, that He alone is King of kings and  Lord of lords; that there is no progress, civilization, or salvation in  this life or the life to come, but through His undeserved mercy and His  strengthening grace; that He has reigned from the creation of the world,  reigns now, and will reign unto that last dread day, when He shall have  put all enemies under His feet, and delivered up the kingdom to God, even  the Father, that God may be all in all.  Unto which day may He in His  mercy bring us all through faith and good works:  Amen.    SERMON VI.  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT    Eversley.  Quinquagesima Sunday, 1872.  Genesis ix. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.  \"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said  unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. . . .   Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you . . .  But flesh  with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.  And  surely your blood of your lives will I require:  at the hand of every  beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every  man's brother will I require the life of man.  Whoso sheddeth man's  blood, by man shall his blood be shed:  for in the image of God made he  man.\"  This is God's blessing on mankind.  This is our charter from God, who  made and rules this earth.  This is the end and duty of our mortal life:- -to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it.  But  is that all?  Is there no hint in this blessing of God of something more  than our mortal life--something beyond our mortal life?  Surely there is.   Those words--\"in the image of God made He man,\" must mean, if they mean  anything, that man can, if he will but be a true man, share the eternal  life of God.  But I will not speak of that to-day, but rather of a  question about his mortal life in this world, which is this:--What is the  reason why man has a right over the lives of animals? why he may use them  for his food? and at the same time, what is the reason why he has not the  same right over the lives of his fellow-men? why he may not use them for  food?  It is this--that \"in the image of God made He man.\"  Man is made in the  image and likeness of God, therefore he is a sacred creature; a creature,  not merely an animal, and the highest of all animals, only cunninger than  all animals, more highly organised, more delicately formed than all  animals; but something beyond an animal.  He is in the likeness of God,  therefore he is consecrated to God.  He is the one creature on earth whom  God, so far as we know, is trying to make like Himself.  Therefore,  whosoever kills a man, sins not only against that man, nor against  society:  he sins against God.  And God will require that man's blood at  the hand of him who slays him.  But how?  At the hand of every beast will  He require it, and at the hand of every man.  What that first part of the law means I cannot tell.  How God will  require from the lion, or the crocodile, or the shark, who eats a human  being, the blood of their victims, is more than I can say.  But this I  can say--that the feeling, not only of horror and pity, but of real rage  and indignation, with which men see (what God grant you never may see) a  wild beast kill a man, is a witness in man's conscience that the text is  true somehow, though how we know not.  I received a letter a few weeks  since from an officer, a very remarkable person, in which he described  his horror and indignation at seeing a friend of his struck down and  eaten by a tiger, and how, when next day he stood over what had been but  the day before a human being, he looked up to heaven, and kept repeating  the words of the text, \"in the image of God made He man,\" in rage and  shame, and almost accusing God for allowing His image to be eaten by a  brute beast.  It shook, for the moment, his faith in God's justice and  goodness.  That man was young then, and has grown calmer and wiser now,  and has regained a deeper and sounder faith in God.  But the shock, he  said, was dreadful to him.  He felt that the matter was not merely  painful and pitiable, but that it was a wrong and a crime; and on the  faith of this very text, a wrong and a crime I believe it to be, and one  which God knows how to avenge and to correct when man cannot.  Somehow-- for He has ways of which we poor mortals do not dream--at the hand of  every beast will He require the blood of man.  But more; at the hand of every man will He require it.  And how?  The  text tells us, \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be  shed:  for in the image of God made He man.\"  Now, I do not doubt but  that the all-seeing God, looking back on what had most probably happened  on this earth already, and looking forward to what would happen, and  happens, alas! too often now, meant to warn men against the awful crime  of cannibalism, of eating their fellow-men as they would eat an animal.   By so doing, they not only treated their fellow-men as beasts, but they  behaved like beasts themselves.  They denied that their victim was made  in the likeness of God; they denied that they were made in the likeness  of God; they willingly and deliberately put on the likeness of beasts,  and as beasts they were to perish.  Now, this is certain, that savages  who eat men--and alas! there are thousands even now who do so--usually  know in their hearts that they are doing wrong.  As soon as their  consciences are the least awakened, they are ashamed of their  cannibalism; they lie about it, try to conceal it; and as soon as God's  grace begins to work on them, it is the very first sin that they give up.   And next, this is certain, that there is a curse upon it.  No cannibal  people, so far as I can find, have ever risen or prospered in the world;  and the cannibal peoples now-a-days, and for the last three hundred  years, have been dying out.  By their own vices, diseases, and wars, they  perish off the face of the earth, in the midst of comfort and plenty;  and, in spite of all the efforts of missionaries, even their children and  grand-children, after giving up the horrid crime, and becoming  Christians, seem to have no power of living and increasing, but dwindle  away, and perish off the earth.  Yes, God's laws work in strange and  subtle ways; so darkly, so slowly, that the ungodly and sinners often  believe that there are no laws of God, and say--\"Tush, how should God  perceive it?  Is there knowledge in the Most High?\"  But the laws work,  nevertheless, whether men are aware of them or not.  \"The mills of God  grind slowly,\" but sooner or later they grind the sinner to powder.  And now I will leave this hateful subject and go on to another, on which  I am moved to speak once and for all, because it is much in men's minds  just now--I mean what is vulgarly called \"capital punishment,\" the  punishing of murder by death.  Now the text, which is the ancient  covenant of God with man, speaks very clearly on this point.  \"Whosoever  sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\"  Man is made in  the likeness of God.  That is the ground of our law about murder, as it  is the ground of all just and merciful law; that gives man his right to  slay the murderer; that makes it his duty to slay the murderer.  He has  to be jealous of God's likeness, and to slay, in the name of God, the man  who, by murder, outrages the likeness of God in himself and in "]]]
