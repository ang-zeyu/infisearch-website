Destruction of a Boche plane by dauntless American aviators, swooping like eagles upon their prey, regardless of the anti-aircraft shells that burst all about them, and helping by their intrepidity and skill to clear the air of the Hun and maintain the supremacy gained by the Allies in aerial warfare. Thousands of American flyers were trained and ready to carry the war into Germany when the Teuton forces collapsed and cried \"Enough!\" _(Photo from I. F.

She carries twelve 14-inch and twenty-two 5-inch guns.]   [Illustration: _Above_--American observation balloon being brought down to its anchorage. One of many similar balloons used to direct the fire of artillery and observe the movements of the enemy, a service of considerable danger as the balloonists are constantly exposed to airplane attack. Each observer is harnessed to a parachute and jumps when the balloon is attacked and in danger of destruction. (_Copyright by C. P. I., from W. N.

The \"flammenwerfer\" or flame-thrower was originated by the Germans, like other diabolical methods of warfare. The Allies perfected the machine and turned it on the enemy with great success, and the Germans did not like their own medicine. Note the reservoir on the soldier's back. _(Copyright.

After celebrating for awhile the announcement that the armistice had been signed, the American troops at the front realized that there was still serious work, though of a different kind, ahead of them, and started for the cities across the Rhine with a firm determination to carry on till all the fruits of their victory were obtained. An American dispatch rider is seen at the right, fraternizing with a French soldier. _(French Official Photo, from U. & U._)]   [Illustration: GENERAL JOHN J.

Allenby's historic entry on foot into Jerusalem, December 11, 1917, after its capture by the British from the Turks, who had held the Holy City under Moslem domination for centuries. All Christendom hailed the event with rejoicing. Every sacred building, shrine, and traditional holy spot will in future be scrupulously maintained and protected. The Holy City was not bombarded by the British, but was evacuated by the Turks and surrendered by the leading inhabitants when Gen. Allenby's forces, after defeating the Turkish troops repeatedly in the field, reached Gazara, three miles from Jerusalem. Subsequently the entire Turkish army in Palestine was captured or dispersed in disorder. _(Copyright, U. & U_.)]   [Illustration: _Above_--Easing the pain of the wounded in an evacuation hospital in France.

The picture shows a scene along the French lines immediately after hostilities ceased. Myriads of men sprang into sight from the concealment of the trenches, exposing themselves to the view of the enemy for the first time in more than four years, without fear of consequences.
