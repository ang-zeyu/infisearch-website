If we ask Julia to come, she will have to 'fall into line,' as you say, and share the family misfortunes as best she can.\"  \"She's a regular shirk, and always was.\" This from Kathleen.  \"She would never come at all if she guessed her cousins' opinion of her, that is very certain!\" remarked Mrs. Carey pointedly.  \"Now, mother, look me in the eye and speak the whole truth,\" asked Nancy. \"_Do you like Julia Carey_?\"  Mrs. Carey laughed as she answered, \"Frankly then, I do not! But,\" she continued, \"I do not like several of the remarks that have been made at this council, yet I manage to bear them.\"  \"Of course I shan't call Julia smug and conceited to her face,\" asserted Nancy encouragingly. \"I hope that her bosom friend Gladys Ferguson has disappeared from view. The last time Julia visited us, Kitty and I got so tired of Gladys Ferguson's dresses, her French maid, her bedroom furniture, and her travels abroad, that we wrote her name on a piece of paper, put it in a box, and buried it in the back yard the minute Julia left the house. When you write, mother, tell Julia there's a piece of breast for her, but not a mouthful of my drumstick goes to Gladys Ferguson.\"  \"The more the hungrier; better invite Gladys too,\" suggested Gilbert, \"then we can say like that simple little kid in Wordsworth:--    \"'Sisters and brother, little maid,     How many may you be?'   'How many? Seven in all,' she said,     And wondering looked at me!\"  \"Then it goes on thus,\" laughed Nancy:--    \"'And who are they? I pray you tell.'     She answered, 'Seven are we;   Mother with us makes five, and then     There's Gladys and Julee!'\"  Everybody joined in the laugh then, including Peter, who was especially uproarious, and who had an idea he had made the joke himself, else why did they all kiss him?  \"How about Julia? What do you say, Peter?\" asked his mother.  \"I want her. She played horse once,\" said Peter. The opinion that the earth revolved around his one small person was natural at the age of four, but the same idea of the universe still existed in Gilbert's mind. A boy of thirteen ought perhaps to have a clearer idea of the relative sizes of world and individual; at least that was the conviction in Mother Carey's mind.    VI  NANCY'S IDEA   Nancy had a great many ideas, first and last. They were generally unique and interesting at least, though it is to be feared that few of them were practical. However, it was Nancy's idea to build Peter a playhouse in the plot of ground at the back of the Charlestown house, and it was she who was the architect and head carpenter. That plan had brought much happiness to Peter and much comfort to the family. It was Nancy's idea that she, Gilbert, and Kathleen should all be so equally polite to Cousin Ann Chadwick that there should be no favorite to receive an undue share of invitations to the Chadwick house. Nancy had made two visits in succession, both offered in the nature of tributes to her charms and virtues, and she did not wish a third.  \"If you two can't be _more_ attractive, then I'll be _less_, that's all,\" was her edict. \"'Turn and turn about' has got to be the rule in this matter. I'm not going to wear the martyr's crown alone; it will adorn your young brows every now and then or I'll know the reason why!\"  It was Nancy's idea to let Joanna go, and divide her work among the various members of the family. It was also Nancy's idea that, there being no strictly masculine bit of martyrdom to give to Gilbert, he should polish the silver for his share. This was an idea that proved so unpopular with Gilbert that it was speedily relinquished. Gilbert was wonderful with tools, so wonderful that Mother Carey feared he would be a carpenter instead of the commander of a great war ship; but there seemed to be no odd jobs to offer him. There came a day when even Peter realized that life was real and life was earnest. When the floor was strewn with playthings his habit had been to stand amid the wreckage and smile, whereupon Joanna would fly and restore everything to its accustomed place. After the passing of Joanna, Mother Carey sat placidly in her chair in the nursery and Peter stood ankle deep among his toys, smiling.  \"Now put everything where it belongs, sweet Pete,\" said mother.  \"You do it,\" smiled Peter.  \"I am very busy darning your stockings, Peter.\"  \"I don't like to pick up, Muddy.\"  \"No, it isn't much fun, but it has to be done.\"  Peter went over to the window and gazed at the landscape. \"I dess I'll go play with Ellen,\" he remarked in honeyed tones.  \"That would be nice, after you clear away your toys and blocks.\"  \"I dess I'll play with Ellen first,\" suggested Peter, starting slowly towards the door.  \"No, we always work first and play afterwards!\" said mother, going on darning.  Peter felt caught in a net of irresistible and pitiless logic.  \"Come and help me, Muddy?\" he coaxed, and as she looked up he suddenly let fly all his armory of weapons at once,--two dimples, tossing back of curls, parted lips, tiny white teeth, sweet voice.  Mother Carey's impulse was to cast herself on the floor and request him simply to smile on her and she would do his lightest bidding, but controlling her secret desires she answered: \"I would help if you needed me, but you don't. You're a great big boy now!\"  \"I'm not a great big boy!\" cried Peter, \"I'm only a great big little boy!\"  \"Don't waste time, sweet Pete; go to work!\"  \"_I want Joanna_!\" roared Peter with the voice of an infant bull.  \"So we all do. It's because she had to go that I'm darning stockings.\"  The net tightened round Peter's defenceless body and he hurled himself against his rocking horse and dragged it brutally to a corner. Having disposed of most of his strength and temper in this operation, he put away the rest of his goods and chattels more quietly, but with streaming eyes and heaving bosom.  \"Splendid!\" commented Mother Carey. \"Joanna couldn't have done it better, and it won't be half so much work next time.\" Peter heard the words \"next time\" distinctly, and knew the grim face of Duty at last, though he was less than five.  The second and far more tragic time was when he was requested to make himself ready for luncheon,--Kathleen to stand near and help \"a little\" if really necessary. Now Peter _au fond_ was absolutely clean. French phrases are detestable where there is any English equivalent, but in this case there is none, so I will explain to the youngest reader--who may speak only one language--that the base of Peter was always clean. He received one full bath and several partial ones in every twenty-four hours, but su-per-im-posed on this base were evidences of his eternal activities, and indeed of other people's! They were divided into three classes,--those contracted in the society of Joanna when she took him out-of-doors: such as sand, water, mud, grass stains, paint, lime, putty, or varnish; those derived from visits to his sisters at their occupations: such as ink, paints, lead pencils, paste, glue, and mucilage; those amassed in his stays with Ellen in the kitchen: sugar, molasses, spice, pudding sauce, black currants, raisins, dough, berry stains (assorted, according to season), chocolate, jelly, jam, and preserves; these deposits were not deep, but were simply dabs on the facade of Peter, and through them the eyes and soul of him shone, delicious and radiant. They could be rubbed off with a moist handkerchief if water were handy, and otherwise if it were not, and the person who rubbed always wanted for some mysterious reason to kiss him immediately afterwards, for Peter had the largest kissing acquaintance in Charlestown.  When Peter had scrubbed the parts of him that showed most, and had performed what he considered his whole duty to his hair, he appeared for the first time at the family table in such a guise that if the children had not been warned they would have gone into hysterics, but he gradually grew to be proud of his toilets and careful that they should not occur too often in the same day, since it appeared to be the family opinion that he should make them himself.  There was a tacit feeling, not always expressed, that Nancy, after mother, held the reins of authority, and also that she was a person of infinite resource. The Gloom-Dispeller had been her father's name for her, but he had never thought of her as a Path-Finder, a gallant adventurer into unknown and untried regions, because there had been small opportunity to test her courage or her ingenuity.  Mrs. Carey often found herself leaning on Nancy nowadays; not as a dead weight, but with just the hint of need, just the suggestion of confidence, that youth and strength and buoyancy respond to so gladly. It had been decided that the house should be vacated as soon as a tenant could be found, but the \"what next\" had not been settled. Julia had confirmed Nancy's worst fears by accepting her aunt's offer of a home, but had requested time to make Gladys Ferguson a short visit at Palm Beach, all expenses being borne by the Parents of Gladys. This estimable lady and gentleman had no other names or titles and were never spoken of as if they had any separate existence. They had lived and loved and married and accumulated vast wealth, and borne Gladys. After that they had sunk into the background and Gladys had taken the stage."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10540"],["title","Mother Carey's Chickens (#5)"],["body","  \"I'm sure I'm glad she is going to the Fergusons,\" exclaimed Kathleen. \"One month less of her!\"  \"Yes,\" Nancy replied, \"but she'll be much worse, more spoiled, more vain, more luxurious than before. She'll want a gold chicken breast now. We've just packed away the finger bowls; but out they'll have to come again.\"  \"Let her wash her own finger bowl a few days and she'll clamor for the simple life,\" said Kathleen shrewdly. \"Oh, what a relief if the Fergusons would adopt Julia, just to keep Gladys company!\"  \"Nobody would ever adopt Julia,\" returned Nancy. \"If she was yours you couldn't help it; you'd just take her 'to the Lord in prayer,' as the Sunday-school hymn says, but you'd never go out and adopt her.\"  Matters were in this uncertain and unsettled state when Nancy came into her mother's room one evening when the rest of the house was asleep.  \"I saw your light, so I knew you were reading, Muddy. I've had such a bright idea I couldn't rest.\"  \"Muddy\" is not an attractive name unless you happen to know its true derivation and significance. First there was \"mother dear,\" and as persons under fifteen are always pressed for time and uniformly breathless, this appellation was shortened to \"Motherdy,\" and Peter being unable to struggle with that term, had abbreviated it into \"Muddy.\" \"Muddy\" in itself is undistinguished and even unpleasant, but when accompanied by a close strangling hug, pats on the cheek, and ardent if somewhat sticky kisses, grows by degrees to possess delightful associations. Mother Carey enjoyed it so much from Peter that she even permitted it to be taken up by the elder children.  \"You mustn't have ideas after nine P.M., Nancy!\" chided her mother. \"Wrap the blue blanket around you and sit down with me near the fire.\"  \"You're not to say I'm romantic or unpractical,\" insisted Nancy, leaning against her mother's knees and looking up into her face,--\"indeed, you're not to say anything of any importance till I'm all finished. I'm going to tell it in a long story, too, so as to work on your feelings and make you say yes.\"  \"Very well, I'm all ears!\"  \"Now put on your thinking cap! Do you remember once, years and years ago, before Peter it was, that father took us on a driving trip through some dear little villages in Maine?\"  (The Careys never dated their happenings eighteen hundred and anything. It was always: Just before Peter, Immediately after Peter, or A Long Time after Peter, which answered all purposes.)  \"I remember.\"  \"It was one of Gilbert's thirsty days, and we stopped at nearly every convenient pump to give him drinks of water, and at noon we came to the loveliest wayside well with a real moss-covered bucket; do you remember?\"  \"I remember.\"  \"And we all clambered out, and father said it was time for luncheon, and we unpacked the baskets on the greensward near a beautiful tree, and father said, 'Don't spread the table too near the house, dears, or they'll cry when they see our doughnuts!' and Kitty, who had been running about, came up and cried, 'It's an empty house; come and look!'\"  \"I remember.\"  \"And we all went in the gate and loved every bit of it: the stone steps, the hollyhocks growing under the windows, the yellow paint and the green blinds; and father looked in the windows, and the rooms were large and sunny, and we wanted to drive the horse into the barn and stay there forever!\"  \"I remember.\"  \"And Gilbert tore his trousers climbing on the gate, and father laid him upside down on your lap and I ran and got your work-bag and you mended the seat of his little trousers. And father looked and looked at the house and said, 'Bless its heart!' and said if he were rich he would buy the dear thing that afternoon and sleep in it that night; and asked you if you didn't wish you'd married the other man, and you said there never was another man, and you asked father if he thought on the whole that he was the poorest man in the world, and father said no, the very richest, and he kissed us all round, do you remember?\"  \"Do I remember? O Nancy, Nancy! What do you think I am made of that I could ever forget?\"  \"Don't cry, Muddy darling, don't! It was so beautiful, and we have so many things like that to remember.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Carey, \"I know it. Part of my tears are grateful ones that none of you can ever recall an unloving word between your father and mother!\"  \"The idea,\" said Nancy suddenly and briefly, \"is to go and live in that darling house!\"  \"Nancy! What for?\"  \"We've got to leave this place, and where could we live on less than in that tiny village? It had a beautiful white-painted academy, don't you remember, so we could go to school there,--Kathleen and I anyway, if you could get enough money to keep Gilly at Eastover.\"  \"Of course I've thought of the country, but that far-away spot never occurred to me. What was its quaint little name,--Mizpah or Shiloh or Deborah or something like that?\"  \"It was Beulah,\" said Nancy; \"and father thought it exactly matched the place!\"  \"We even named the house,\" recalled Mother Carey with a tearful smile. \"There were vegetables growing behind it, and flowers in front, and your father suggested Garden Fore-and-Aft and I chose Happy Half-Acre, but father thought the fields that stretched back of the vegetable garden might belong to the place, and if so there would be far more than a half-acre of land.\"  \"And do you remember father said he wished we could do something to thank the house for our happy hour, and I thought of the little box of plants we had bought at a wayside nursery?\"  \"Oh! I do indeed! I hadn't thought of it for years! Father and you planted a tiny crimson rambler at the corner of the piazza at the side.\"  \"Do you suppose it ever 'rambled,' Muddy? Because it would be ever so high now, and full of roses in summer.\"  \"I wonder!\" mused Mother Carey. \"Oh! it was a sweet, tranquil, restful place! I wonder how we could find out about it? It seems impossible that it should not have been rented or sold before this. Let me see, that was five years ago.\"  \"There was a nice old gentleman farther down the street, quite in the village, somebody who had known father when he was a boy.\"  \"So there was; he had a quaint little law office not much larger than Peter's playhouse. Perhaps we could find him. He was very, very old. He may not be alive, and I cannot remember his name.\"  \"Father called him 'Colonel,' I know that. Oh, how I wish dear Addy was here to help us!\"  \"If he were he would want to help us too much! We must learn to bear our own burdens. They won't seem so strange and heavy when we are more used to them. Now go to bed, dear. We'll think of Beulah, you and I; and perhaps, as we have been all adrift, waiting for a wind to stir our sails, 'Nancy's idea' will be the thing to start us on our new voyage. Beulah means land of promise;--that's a good omen!\"  \"And father found Beulah; and father found the house, and father blessed it and loved it and named it; that makes ever so many more good omens, more than enough to start housekeeping on,\" Nancy answered, kissing her mother goodnight.    VII  \"OLD BEASTS INTO NEW\"   Mother Carey went to sleep that night in greater peace than she had felt for months. It had seemed to her, all these last sad weeks, as though she and her brood had been breasting stormy waters with no harbor in sight. There were friends in plenty here and there, but no kith and kin, and the problems to be settled were graver and more complex than ordinary friendship could untangle, vexed as it always was by its own problems. She had but one keen desire: to go to some quiet place where temptations for spending money would be as few as possible, and there live for three or four years, putting her heart and mind and soul on fitting the children for life. If she could keep strength enough to guide and guard, train and develop them into happy, useful, agreeable human beings,--masters of their own powers; wise and discreet enough, when years of discretion were reached, to choose right paths,--that, she conceived, was her chief task in life, and no easy one. \"Happy I must contrive that they shall be,\" she thought, \"for unhappiness and discontent are among the foxes that spoil the vines. Stupid they shall not be, while I can think of any force to stir their brains; they have ordinary intelligence, all of them, and they shall learn to use it; dull and sleepy children I can't abide. Fairly good they will be, if they are busy and happy, and clever enough to see the folly of being anything _but_ good! And so, month after month, for many years to come, I must be helping Nancy and Kathleen to be the right sort of women, and wives, and mothers, and Gilbert and Peter the proper kind of men, and husbands, and fathers. Mother Carey's chickens must be able to show the good birds the way home, as the Admiral said, and I should think they ought to be able to set a few bad birds on the right track now and then!\"  Well, all this would be a task to frighten and stagger many a person, but it only kindled Mrs. Carey's love and courage to a white heat.  Do you remember where Kingsley's redoubtable Tom the Water Baby swims past Shiny Wall, and reaches at last Peacepool? Peacepool, where the good whales lie, waiting till Mother Carey shall send for them \"to make them out of old beasts into new\"?  Tom swims up to the nearest whale and asks the way to Mother Carey.  \"There she is in the middle,\" says the whale, though Tom sees nothing but a glittering white peak like an iceberg. \"That's Mother Carey,\" spouts the whale, \"as you will find if you get to her. There she sits making old beasts into new all the year round.\"  \"How does she do that?\" asks Tom.  \"That's her concern, not mine!\" the whale remarks discreetly.  And when Tom came nearer to the white glittering peak it took the form of something like a lovely woman sitting on a white marble throne. And from the foot of the throne, you remember, there swam away, out and out into the sea,"]]]
