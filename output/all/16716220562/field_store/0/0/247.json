Bert Winton (that was the new fellow) watched him, kind of laughing, and then he said, \"Queer little codger, isn't he?\"  I said, \"Yes, he's new and he came out of the slums. I guess he'll never work in harness; that's what our scoutmaster says.\"  \"Swims like an eel,\" Winton said; \"why didn't they take him hiking, I wonder?\"  \"Hanged if _I_ know,\" Westy said; \"he's going to win them the swimming badge, all right. But he doesn't seem to be friends with them exactly. They make good use of him, anyway.\"  \"Kind of a performing bear, hey?\" Bert said.  \"Something like that,\" I told him; \"I wish I had him in my patrol, I know that.\"  \"Guess he wouldn't fit into any patrol,\" Winton said; \"he seems to be a kind of an odd number.\"  Pretty soon Skinny came running back shouting for all he was worth, and believe me, he did look like an odd number. His streaky hair was all down over his forehead and his eyes were like a couple of camp fires. He was shouting: \"_Don't go, don't go! I can go with you\"_  We rowed over to shore and as he climbed in I could see that he was trembling all over, just for fear we wouldn't wait for him, I suppose. \"I was going to swim out to you, I was,\" he said; \"if you didn't wait.\"  \"You wouldn't want your scout suit to get all wet, would you?\" I said. \"Sit down and don't be so excited.\"  \"I like the water better than hiking, anyway,\" he said; \"and I like _you_ best of all.\"  I said, \"The pleasure is mine,\" and then we all laughed.  \"You can make fun of me all you want,\" he said; \"I don't care. I told them they could make fun of me all they want if they'd let me go with them, but they wouldn't let me go.\"  \"They wouldn't, huh?\" Bert Winton said, and he studied Skinny awful funny like.  \"When I win them the badge, then they'll take me, won't they?\" he said.  \"I guess so,\" I told him.  \"I'm going to win the cup for them in the contest, too,\" he said; \"I'm going to win it for them before I go home. Then I'll be friends with them. I told them I'd win it if _you_ didn't try for it.\"  \"You should worry about me,\" I said, \"I can swim, but _good night_, I'm not in the contest class. And maybe you're not either, so don't be too sure.\"  He said, \"I'm going to win them the cup, and I'm going to win them the badge. But I don't have to get to be a first class scout guy to win the cup, I don't. It's made of silver. Once my father stole a lot of silver. It's all fancy, that cup.\"  \"I know all about the cup, Alf,\" I said; (because, gee, I didn't like to be calling him Skinny) \"but don't call the fellows scout guys. Just scouts--that's enough.\" He just looked at me kind of wild, as if he didn't understand, the same as he always did when anybody called him down, or tried to tell him something.  For a few minutes nobody spoke and we just rowed around. Then Westy said, \"So that's their game, is it?\"  I knew well enough what he meant. Every season Mr. Temple offers a silver cup to the best swimmer at Temple Camp. Once Mr. Temple had a son who got drowned because he couldn't swim, and that's why he's so interested in fellows being good swimmers. That silver cup hasn't got anything to do with the scout swimming badge. You can't win that (anyway they won't give it to you) till you've passed your first class tests. But anybody can try for the silver cup, and you can bet it's a big honor for any troop or patrol to have that. Most always they have the contest on Labor Day.  I said, \"Alf, you can bet I'd be glad to see you win that cup, but don't forget that there are more than a hundred fellows at the camp. Some of the troops come from the seashore--you know that, and they're all crackerjack swimmers. It comes mighty hard to be disappointed, so don't you stay awake at night thinking about it.\" I said that because I could just see that poor kid dreaming about handing that cup over to his patrol leader, and honestly, I didn't think there was much chance for him.  Pretty soon Bert Winton leaned over and said to me, \"Do you suppose that's true about his father?\"  \"Guess so,\" I told him.  \"He doesn't seem to be very much ashamed of it,\" he said.  All I could say was, \"He's a queer kid; he's all the time blurting out things like that.\"  \"Maybe it's because he's just plain honest,\" Winton said.  \"But you'd think he'd be ashamed,\" I told him.  He just shrugged his shoulders and looked kind of funny at Skinny. I had a kind of a hunch that he liked him and believed in him. Anyway, I remembered those words, \"_just plain honest_.\"    CHAPTER XIII  TELLS ABOUT THE STRANGE CAMPERS  It was nice rowing around there in the dark. It wasn't so very dark, though, because the moon was out and you could see it in the water just as plain as if it had fallen kerflop out of the sky and was laying in the bottom of the lake. Over on shore we could see the camp-fire getting started and black figures going toward it, and the blaze was upside down in the water.  \"How about camp-fire?\" Westy said.  \"We should worry about camp-fire,\" I told him; \"there's plenty of time. Wait till it gets to blazing up good and high.\"  \"It's fine out here,\" Bert Winton said; \"I always take a row before going in to camp-fire.\"  \"We should worry about you, too,\" I heard somebody say, and then a lot of fellows began laughing. By that I knew they had heard everything we said.  Winton said, \"Funny how clear you can people talk when they're on the water.\"  Pretty soon we were away over at the other side of the lake and it was awfully still, and even our oars seemed to make a lot of noise dripping the water.  All of a sudden Westy said, \"There's a canoe.\"  We could only just see it as it went gliding by us, but I noticed there were two dark figures in it.  Winton said, \"Shh, wait till they pass us, then I'll tell you about them.\"  \"I bet they're evil cronies,\" I said; \"like they usually have in books,\" Because you know how it is in books; there are always a couple of bad fellows that won't join the good ones, but go camping right near them and make a lot of trouble for them. Hanged if I see why they don't join in with them and be done with it, hey?  Pretty soon Winton said very low, \"They're a couple of millionaire campers--young fellows. Their people are staying near Leeds and those fellows have got a tent right across there in the woods near the shore. They're having the time of their lives with an up-to-date oil stove and a couple of fireless cookers and some thermos bottles and things. They've got cushions with buckskin fringe--presents from Dearie and Sweetie, I suppose, and they've got a cedar chest with brass hinges. Regular modern Daniel Boones, they are.\"  \"Oh, me, oh, my!\" Westy whispered; \"have they got jackknives hanging from their belts?\"  \"Right the first time,\" Bert Winton said.  \"And leather cases of writing paper?\" I said, just for fun.  \"Everything except a burglar alarm and a telephone,\" Bert said; \"but they're not half bad chaps. We'll row over and see them some day. They have wild times around their camp-fire, telling yarns and watching the roaring blaze in their oil stove. They've got a fancy Indian blanket, you ought to see it. One of them paddled over to camp one day and wanted to buy a fishing rod. He had about a hundred dollars with him. He couldn't even swim.\"  \"_Good night!\"_ I said.  Then, all of a sudden Skinny piped up, \"If I had a hundred dollars I'd buy a canoe, I would. I'd have it painted red. I'd have a sail for it, too. Then all the fellows would like me, wouldn't they?\"  I said, \"Shh, don't shout like that; people can hear you all over. The fellows like you now, don't you worry.\"  \"I don't care if they hear me,\" he said.  Pretty soon we rowed over and went up and sprawled around camp-fire. Gee, whiz, I guess the whole camp was there. One of the scouts in a Virginia troop was telling a yarn about somebody who had an adventure at sea. It was mighty interesting, you can bet, and it kind of started me thinking about Lieutenant Donnelle. Little I knew of the terrible thing that was going to happen at camp the very next day. Right across from me I could see Skinny sitting near Mr. Ellsworth, but the rest of the Elks were sprawling around with the Ravens. One thing, my patrol always sticks together. Skinny's eyes looked awful big and wild, kind of, with the fire shining right in his face and it made me feel kind of spooky to look at him. Poor kid, little he knew what he was going to go through. Anyway, I wished that the Elks would call him over to them. Probably he was thinking about how he was going to win them the silver cup, hey?    CHAPTER XIV  TELLS ABOUT THE STORM ON BLACK LAKE  One thing I have to admit, and that is that Mr. Ellsworth helped me a lot with this chapter and the next one too. But just the same both of them are by me, all right.  It's a funny thing, but all that night I was dreaming about that canoe with the two fellows in it. I could hear them paddling just as clear as could be, only when I woke up before daylight, I knew it was just the sound of rain on the roof of our patrol cabin. It was dripping into the rain ditch, I guess.  Pretty soon I went to sleep again, and I could see Skinny standing in front of me and his eyes were staring and his face was all white and there was some blood on it and he said, \"I want to be a Silver Fox, because my father stole a lot of silver; so haven't I got a right to be?\" I tried to answer him, but there was a loud noise and he couldn't hear and then, all of a sudden, I woke up and I knew the noise was thunder and Skinny wasn't there at all. Anyway, it made me feel kind of creepy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10319"],["title","Dave Darrin's Third Year at Annapolis; Or, Leaders of the Second Class (#0)"],["body","Team                       DAVE DARRIN'S THIRD YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS                                     or                   Leaders of the Second Class Midshipmen                             By H.

Dave Darrin's Third Year at Annapolis     CHAPTER I  WHY THE MIDSHIPMEN BALKED   \"So Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton have been here?\" demanded Midshipman Dave Darrin.  That handsome young member of the brigade of midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis was now in mufti, or cits,--meaning, in other words, that he was out of his Naval uniform and attired in the conventional clothing of a young American when calling on his sweetheart.  It will make the situation even clearer to the reader to explain that Dave was back in the home town, on his September leave, after just having completed his second summer practice cruise with the three upper classes from Annapolis.  Dave was now a fine looking and \"husky\" second classman. He was just a shade more than half way through his course of instruction at Annapolis.  Being back in the home town, where would Midshipman Darrin be more naturally found than in the parlor at the home of his sweetheart, Miss Belle Meade?  The first greetings had been exchanged fifteen minutes before.  Since that time the young people, being sweethearts as they were, had naturally talked about themselves.  And Dave, who, in the Naval service, was fast learning to become a good listener, had been content to have Belle do most of the talking, while he sat back watching the motions of her pretty lips and catching glimpses of two rows of pearly teeth.  But now Belle had just mentioned two of Dave's former High School chums.  \"So Tom and Harry were really here?\" he repeated.  \"Yes; they came up from Arizona on leave.\"  \"I wonder why they couldn't have remained here longer?\" mused Dave.  \"They both told me that they were very young in their profession as civil engineers, and that they had to spend nearly all of their time 'on the job,' as Tom phrased it,\" replied Belle.  \"How did they look?\" asked Dave.  \"A shade older, of course, than when they were in the High School.\"  \"Are they much taller?\" asked Darrin.  \"Somewhat; but they have not shot up in height, the way you and Dan, and Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes have done,\" Belle continued.  \"Brown as berries, I suppose, after working down in the alkali deserts?\" asked Dave, who felt that he could not hear enough of those dear old chums.  \"Meaning Tom and Harry?\" smiled Belle. \"Or Dick and Greg?\"  \"Tom and Harry, that time, of course,\" laughed Dave. \"But I'm waiting to hear a whole lot about Dick and Greg as well.\"  \"No; I wouldn't call Tom and Harry exactly as brown as berries,\" went on Belle, laughing, \"for I am not acquainted with many kinds of brown berries.\"  \"Coffee berries?\" hinted Darrin.  \"I would call Tom and Harry fully as bronzed as Indians,\" Belle ventured.  \"Have you ever seen any Indians?\" asked Midshipman Darrin, looking at his sweetheart rather quizzically.  \"Oh, haven't I?\" laughed Belle Meade, her eyes sparkling. \"We had Indians here the early part of this summer. There was a medicine show here, with Indians and cowboys, and that sort of thing. One day the Indians and cowboys got intoxicated and they went through Main Street like a tornado. They were yelling and shooting, and had people all along the street running for cover. Even the chief of police, though he wasn't a coward, ran into safety.  \"In the midst of it all Dick Prescott, Greg Holmes, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton came out of an ice cream parlor. Tom and Harry got a glimpse of the very Wild West looking company of yellers and shooters. Tom and Harry have seen enough Indians and cowboys to know the real thing--and that these were only poor imitations. All of a sudden Tom and Harry and Dick and Greg charged into that howling, shooting crowd and knocked them right and left. Your four old-time chums simply disarmed the 'bad' ones and turned the weapons over to the chief of police.\"  Belle went on, describing the famous incident, while Dave leaned back, laughing heartily.  \"How I wish I had been on hand! I'd like to have helped, too,\" he added.  \"Those four youngsters didn't need any help,\" laughed Belle.  \"Which was the most surprised crowd--the 'bad' Western outfit or the police department?\" chuckled Dave.  Readers of our \"WEST POINT SERIES\" will find the \"Wild West\" scene fully narrated in \"DICK PRESCOTT'S THIRD YEAR AT WEST POINT.\"  \"Isn't it outrageous,\" demanded Dave, \"that the West Point and the Annapolis leave of absence should be so arranged that midshipmen and cadets who are old, old friends never get a chance to meet each other on furlough!\"  \"I don't suppose,\" replied Belle, \"that it often happens that one little city often has the honor of furnishing, at the same time, two midshipmen for Annapolis and two cadets for West Point.\"  \"Very likely not,\" nodded Dave. \"But it seems too bad, just the same. What wouldn't I give to see Tom or Harry? Or Greg or Dick? And now that I'm here Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes are but just barely gone.\"  \"Yes; they have been but four days gone,\" assented Belle. \"It does seem too bad that you and your West Point chums couldn't have been one day together.\"  \"I haven't seen a blessed one of the good old four since I left for Annapolis, more than two years ago,\" muttered Dave complainingly. \"What wouldn't I give--just to see what they look like in these days?\"  \"Well, what would you give?\" demanded Belle, rising and hesitating.  \"They've given you their photos, then!\" asked Dave Darrin guessing. \"Please be quick--let me see the photos.\"  Belle glided from the room, to return with a large card.  \"They were taken altogether,\" she explained, handing the card over to Darrin. \"There they are--all in one group.\"  Dave seized the card, studying eagerly the print mounted thereon.  \"Whew! What a change two years make in a High School boy, doesn't it?\" demanded Darrin.  \"Of course,\" answered Belle Meade. \"Do you imagine that you and Dan Dalzell haven't changed any, either?\"  Readers of our \"HIGH SCHOOL SERIES\" will well remember Dick Prescott, Greg Holmes, Tom Reade, Harry Hazelton, Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell, a famous sextette of young High School athletes, who, in their High School days, were known as Dick & Co.  Readers of the four volumes of that series will recall that Dick Prescott received the congressman's nomination to West Point, and that Greg Holmes was appointed a cadet at the same big government Army school by one of the state's senators. Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell, a little later, secured nominations to Annapolis from the same gentlemen; and Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, who had thrown their lot with civil engineering, had gone West to engage with an engineering firm of railroad builders.  From that passing of the old High School days the experiences and adventures of Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes are told in the volumes of \"THE WEST POINT SERIES.\"  Those of Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton are set forth fully in \"THE YOUNG ENGINEERS' SERIES.\"  As for Dave Darrin and Dan, their life, since leaving the High School, and casting their lot with the Navy, has been fully told in the two preceding volumes of the present series, \"DAVE DARRIN'S FIRST YEAR AT AKNAPOLIS\" and \"DAVE DARRIN'S SECOND YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS.\"  \"Well, I'll meet Dick and Greg this coming Thanksgiving, at any rate,\" predicted Midshipman Darrin. \"You know what happens the Saturday after Thanksgiving on Franklin Field, don't you, Belle?\"  \"You young men of Annapolis and West Point play football, don't you!\" asked Belle.  \"Do we?\" demanded Dave, his eyes aglow with enthusiasm. \"Don't we, though. And, mark me, Belle, the Navy is going to carry away the Army's scalp this year.\"  \"Are you going to join the team?\" asked Belle.  \"I can't say, until I get back. But I've been training. I hope to be called to the team. So does Dan.\"  \"I hope you and Dan both make the eleven,\" cried Belle, \"so that you can get away to see the game.\"  \"Why, we can see the game better,\" retorted Dave, \"if we don't make the team.\"  \"Why, are midshipmen who don't belong to the eleven allowed to see the game?\" asked Belle in some surprise.  \"Are we?\" demanded Dave. \"Belle, don't you know what the Army-Navy game on the Saturday after Thanksgiving Day is like? The entire brigade of midshipmen and the whole corps of cadets travel over to Philadelphia. There, on Franklin Field, before an average of thirty thousand yelling spectators, the great annual game of the two great national academies is fought out.\"  \"You haven't gone to see the annual game at Philadelphia before this, have you?\" asked Miss Meade.  \"No.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because, Belle, both years, at Thanksgiving time, Danny boy and I have found ourselves so far behind in our studies that we just took the time to stay behind and bone, bone, bone over our books.\"  \"And you think this year will be different?\"  \"Oh, yes; when a man is half way through"]]]
