My son! within these rocks,” he thus began, “Are three close circles in gradation plac’d, As these which now thou leav’st. Each one is full Of spirits accurs’d; but that the sight alone Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how And for what cause in durance they abide.  “Of all malicious act abhorr’d in heaven, The end is injury; and all such end Either by force or fraud works other’s woe But fraud, because of man peculiar evil, To God is more displeasing; and beneath The fraudulent are therefore doom’d to’ endure Severer pang. The violent occupy All the first circle; and because to force Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds Hach within other sep’rate is it fram’d. To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man Force may be offer’d; to himself I say And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear At full. Death, violent death, and painful wounds Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes By devastation, pillage, and the flames, His substance. Slayers, and each one that smites In malice, plund’rers, and all robbers, hence The torment undergo of the first round In different herds. Man can do violence To himself and his own blessings: and for this He in the second round must aye deplore With unavailing penitence his crime, Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light, In reckless lavishment his talent wastes, And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy. To God may force be offer’d, in the heart Denying and blaspheming his high power, And nature with her kindly law contemning. And thence the inmost round marks with its seal Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak Contemptuously’ of the Godhead in their hearts.  “Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting, May be by man employ’d on one, whose trust He wins, or on another who withholds Strict confidence. Seems as the latter way Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes. Whence in the second circle have their nest Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries, Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce To lust, or set their honesty at pawn, With such vile scum as these. The other way Forgets both Nature’s general love, and that Which thereto added afterwards gives birth To special faith. Whence in the lesser circle, Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis, The traitor is eternally consum’d.”  I thus: “Instructor, clearly thy discourse Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm And its inhabitants with skill exact. But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool, Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives, Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet, Wherefore within the city fire-illum’d Are not these punish’d, if God’s wrath be on them? And if it be not, wherefore in such guise Are they condemned?” He answer thus return’d: “Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind, Not so accustom’d? or what other thoughts Possess it? Dwell not in thy memory The words, wherein thy ethic page describes Three dispositions adverse to Heav’n’s will, Incont’nence, malice, and mad brutishness, And how incontinence the least offends God, and least guilt incurs? If well thou note This judgment, and remember who they are, Without these walls to vain repentance doom’d, Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac’d From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours Justice divine on them its vengeance down.”  “O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight, Thou so content’st me, when thou solv’st my doubt, That ignorance not less than knowledge charms. Yet somewhat turn thee back,” I in these words Continu’d, “where thou saidst, that usury Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot Perplex’d unravel.” He thus made reply: “Philosophy, to an attentive ear, Clearly points out, not in one part alone, How imitative nature takes her course From the celestial mind and from its art: And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds, Not many leaves scann’d o’er, observing well Thou shalt discover, that your art on her Obsequious follows, as the learner treads In his instructor’s step, so that your art Deserves the name of second in descent From God. These two, if thou recall to mind Creation’s holy book, from the beginning Were the right source of life and excellence To human kind. But in another path The usurer walks; and Nature in herself And in her follower thus he sets at nought, Placing elsewhere his hope. But follow now My steps on forward journey bent; for now The Pisces play with undulating glance Along the’ horizon, and the Wain lies all O’er the north-west; and onward there a space Is our steep passage down the rocky height.”     CANTO XII   The place where to descend the precipice We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge Such object lay, as every eye would shun.  As is that ruin, which Adice’s stream On this side Trento struck, should’ring the wave, Or loos’d by earthquake or for lack of prop; For from the mountain’s summit, whence it mov’d To the low level, so the headlong rock Is shiver’d, that some passage it might give To him who from above would pass; e’en such Into the chasm was that descent: and there At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch’d The infamy of Crete, detested brood Of the feign’d heifer: and at sight of us It gnaw’d itself, as one with rage distract. To him my guide exclaim’d: “Perchance thou deem’st The King of Athens here, who, in the world Above, thy death contriv’d. Monster! avaunt! He comes not tutor’d by thy sister’s art, But to behold your torments is he come.”  Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow Hath struck him, but unable to proceed Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim’d: “Run to the passage! while he storms, ’tis well That thou descend.” Thus down our road we took Through those dilapidated crags, that oft Mov’d underneath my feet, to weight like theirs Unus’d. I pond’ring went, and thus he spake:  “Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin’d steep, Guarded by the brute violence, which I Have vanquish’d now. Know then, that when I erst Hither descended to the nether hell, This rock was not yet fallen. But past doubt (If well I mark) not long ere He arrived, Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds Such trembling seiz’d the deep concave and foul, I thought the universe was thrill’d with love, Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft Been into chaos turn’d: and in that point, Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down. But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood Approaches, in the which all those are steep’d, Who have by violence injur’d.” O blind lust! O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on In the brief life, and in the eternal then Thus miserably o’erwhelm us. I beheld An ample foss, that in a bow was bent, As circling all the plain; for so my guide Had told. Between it and the rampart’s base On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm’d, As to the chase they on the earth were wont.  At seeing us descend they each one stood; And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows And missile weapons chosen first; of whom One cried from far: “Say to what pain ye come Condemn’d, who down this steep have journied? Speak From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.”  To whom my guide: “Our answer shall be made To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come. Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.”  Then me he touch’d, and spake: “Nessus is this, Who for the fair Deianira died, And wrought himself revenge for his own fate. He in the midst, that on his breast looks down, Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs’d; That other Pholus, prone to wrath.” Around The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts At whatsoever spirit dares emerge From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.  We to those beasts, that rapid strode along, Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth, And with the notch push’d back his shaggy beard To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim’d: “Are ye aware, that he who comes behind Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead Are not so wont.” My trusty guide, who now Stood near his breast, where the two natures join, Thus made reply: “He is indeed alive, And solitary so must needs by me Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc’d By strict necessity, not by delight. She left her joyful harpings in the sky, Who this new office to my care consign’d. He is no robber, no dark spirit I. But by that virtue, which empowers my step To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray, One of thy band, whom we may trust secure, Who to the ford may lead us, and convey Across, him mounted on his back; for he Is not a spirit that may walk the air.”  Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus To Nessus spake: “Return, and be their guide. And if ye chance to cross another troop, Command them keep aloof.” Onward we mov’d, The faithful escort by our side, along The border of the crimson-seething flood, Whence from those steep’d within loud shrieks arose.  Some there I mark’d, as high as to their brow Immers’d, of whom the mighty Centaur thus: “These are the souls of tyrants, who were given To blood and rapine. Here they wail aloud Their merciless wrongs. Here Alexander dwells, And Dionysius fell, who many a year Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. That brow Whereon the hair so jetty clust’ring hangs, Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks Obizzo’ of Este, in the world destroy’d By his foul step-son.” To the bard rever’d I turned me round, and thus he spake; “Let him Be to thee now first leader, me but next To him in rank.” Then farther on a space The Centaur paus’d, near some, who at the throat Were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],["title","Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#7)"],["body","from the wave; and showing us A spirit by itself apart retir’d, Exclaim’d: “He in God’s bosom smote the heart, Which yet is honour’d on the bank of Thames.”  A race I next espied, who held the head, And even all the bust above the stream. ’Midst these I many a face remember’d well. Thus shallow more and more the blood became, So that at last it but imbru’d the feet; And there our passage lay athwart the foss.  “As ever on this side the boiling wave Thou seest diminishing,” the Centaur said, “So on the other, be thou well assur’d, It lower still and lower sinks its bed, Till in that part it reuniting join, Where ’tis the lot of tyranny to mourn. There Heav’n’s stern justice lays chastising hand On Attila, who was the scourge of earth, On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts Tears ever by the seething flood unlock’d From the Rinieri, of Corneto this, Pazzo the other nam’d, who fill’d the ways With violence and war.” This said, he turn’d, And quitting us, alone repass’d the ford.     CANTO XIII   Ere Nessus yet had reach’d the other bank, We enter’d on a forest, where no track Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform’d And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns Instead, with venom fill’d. Less sharp than these, Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide Those animals, that hate the cultur’d fields, Betwixt Corneto and Cecina’s stream.  Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same Who from the Strophades the Trojan band Drove with dire boding of their future woe. Broad are their pennons, of the human form Their neck and count’nance, arm’d with talons keen The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.  The kind instructor in these words began: “Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now I’ th’ second round, and shalt be, till thou come Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold, As would my speech discredit.” On all sides I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see From whom they might have issu’d. In amaze Fast bound I stood. He, as it seem’d, believ’d, That I had thought so many voices came From some amid those thickets close conceal’d, And thus his speech resum’d: “If thou lop off A single twig from one of those ill plants, The thought thou hast conceiv’d shall vanish quite.”  Thereat a little stretching forth my hand, From a great wilding gather’d I a branch, And straight the trunk exclaim’d: “Why pluck’st thou me?” Then as the dark blood trickled down its side, These words it added: “Wherefore tear’st me thus? Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast? Men once were we, that now are rooted here. Thy hand might well have spar’d us, had we been The souls of serpents.” As a brand yet green, That burning at one end from the’ other sends A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind That forces out its way, so burst at once, Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.  I, letting fall the bough, remain’d as one Assail’d by terror, and the sage replied: “If he, O injur’d spirit! could have believ’d What he hath seen but in my verse describ’d, He never against thee had stretch’d his hand. But I, because the thing surpass’d belief, Prompted him to this deed, which even now Myself I rue. But tell me, who thou wast; That, for this wrong to do thee some amends, In the upper world (for thither to return Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.”  “That pleasant word of thine,” the trunk replied “Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge A little longer, in the snare detain’d, Count it not grievous. I it was, who held Both keys to Frederick’s heart, and turn’d the wards, Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet, That besides me, into his inmost breast Scarce any other could admittance find. The faith I bore to my high charge was such, It cost me the life-blood that warm’d my veins. The harlot, who ne’er turn’d her gloating eyes From Caesar’s household, common vice and pest Of courts, ’gainst me inflam’d the minds of all; And to Augustus they so spread the flame, That my glad honours chang’d to bitter woes. My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought Refuge in death from scorn, and I became, Just as I was, unjust toward myself. By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear, That never faith I broke to my liege lord, Who merited such honour; and of you, If any to the world indeed return, Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies Yet prostrate under envy’s cruel blow.”  First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words Were ended, then to me the bard began: “Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask, If more thou wish to learn.” Whence I replied: “Question thou him again of whatsoe’er Will, as thou think’st, content me; for no power Have I to ask, such pity’ is at my heart.”  He thus resum’d; “So may he do for thee Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet Be pleas’d, imprison’d Spirit! to declare, How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied; And whether any ever from such frame Be loosen’d, if thou canst, that also tell.”  Thereat the trunk breath’d hard, and the wind soon Chang’d into sounds articulate like these;  Briefly ye shall be answer’d. When departs The fierce soul from the body, by itself Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf By Minos doom’d, into the wood it falls, No place assign’d, but wheresoever chance Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt, It rises to a sapling, growing thence A savage plant. The Harpies, on its leaves Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain A vent to grief. We, as the rest, shall come For our own spoils, yet not so that with them We may again be clad; for what a man Takes from himself it is not just he have. Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung, Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.”  Attentive yet to listen to the trunk We stood, expecting farther speech, when us A noise surpris’d, as when a man perceives The wild boar and the hunt approach his place Of station’d watch, who of the beasts and boughs Loud rustling round him hears. And lo! there came Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight, That they before them broke each fan o’ th’ wood. “Haste now,” the foremost cried, “now haste thee death!” The’ other, as seem’d, impatient of delay Exclaiming, “Lano! not so bent for speed Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo’s field.” And then, for that perchance no longer breath Suffic’d him, of himself and of a bush One group he made. Behind them was the wood Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet, As greyhounds that have newly slipp’d the leash. On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs, And having rent him piecemeal bore away The tortur’d limbs. My guide then seiz’d my hand, And led me to the thicket, which in vain Mourn’d through its bleeding wounds: “O Giacomo Of Sant’ Andrea! what avails it thee,” It cried, “that of me thou hast made thy screen? For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?”  When o’er it he had paus’d, my master spake: “Say who wast thou, that at so many points Breath’st out with blood thy lamentable speech?”  He answer’d: “Oh, ye spirits: arriv’d in time To spy the shameful havoc, that from me My leaves hath sever’d thus, gather them up, And at the foot of their sad parent-tree Carefully lay them. In that city’ I dwelt, Who for the Baptist her first patron chang’d, Whence he for this shall cease not with his art To work her woe: and if there still remain’d not On Arno’s passage some faint glimpse of him, Those citizens, who rear’d once more her walls Upon the ashes left by Attila, Had labour’d without profit of their toil. I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.”     CANTO XIV   Soon as the charity of native land Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter’d leaves Collected, and to him restor’d, who now Was hoarse with utt’rance. To the limit thence We came, which from the third the second round Divides, and where of justice is display’d Contrivance horrible. Things then first seen Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next A plain we reach’d, that from its sterile bed Each plant repell’d. The mournful wood waves round Its garland on all sides, as round the wood Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge, Our steps we stay’d. It was an area wide Of arid sand and thick, resembling most The soil that erst by Cato’s foot was trod.  Vengeance of Heav’n! Oh ! how shouldst thou be fear’d By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!  Of naked spirits many a flock I saw, All weeping piteously, to different laws Subjected: for on the’ earth some lay supine, Some crouching close were seated, others pac’d Incessantly around; the latter tribe, More numerous, those fewer who beneath The torment lay, but louder in their grief.  O’er all the sand fell slowly wafting down Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush’d. As in the torrid Indian clime, the son Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band Descending, solid flames, that to the ground Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop To trample on the soil; for easier thus The vapour was extinguish’d, while alone; So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith The marble glow’d underneath, as under stove The viands, doubly to augment the pain. Unceasing was the play of wretched hands, Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off The heat, still falling fresh. I thus began: “Instructor! thou who all things overcom’st, Except the hardy demons, that rush’d forth To stop our entrance at the gate, say who Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn, As by the sultry tempest immatur’d?”  Straight he himself, who was aware I ask’d My guide of him, exclaim’d: “Such as I was When living, dead such now I am. If Jove Weary his workman out, from whom in ire He snatch’d the lightnings, that at my last day Transfix’d me, if the rest be weary out At their "]]]
