He's just the boy to look out for himself in an emergency.\"  Ford Foster's father took very strongly after the son in whose presence of mind and ability he expressed so much confidence. He had just such a square, active, bustling sort of body, several sizes larger; with just such keen, penetrating, greenish-gray eyes. Anybody would have picked him out at a glance for a lawyer, and a good one.  That was exactly what he was; and, if anybody had become acquainted with either son or father, there would have been no difficulty afterward in identifying the other.  It required a good deal more than the telegraphic report of the accident, or even her husband's assurances, to relieve the motherly anxiety of good Mrs. Foster, or even to drive away the shadows from the face of Annie.  No doubt, if Ford himself had known the state of affairs in his family circle, they would have been relieved earlier; for, even while they were talking about him, he had reached the end of his adventures, and was already in the house. It had not so much as occurred to him that his mother would hear of the disaster to the pig and the railway-train until he himself should tell her; and so he had made sure of his supper down stairs before reporting his arrival. He might not have done it perhaps; but he had entered the house by the lower way, through the area door, and that of the dining-room had stood temptingly open, with some very eatable things spread out upon the table.  That had been too much for Ford, after his car-ride, and his smash-up, and his long walk.  Now, at last, up he came, three stairs at a time, brimful of new and wonderful experiences, to be more than a little astonished by the manner and enthusiasm of his welcome.  \"Why, mother,\" he exclaimed, when he got a chance for a word, \"you and Annie couldn't have said much more if I'd been the pig himself!\"  \"The pig!\" said Annie.  \"Yes, the pig that stopped us. He and the engine won't go home to their families to-night.\"  \"Don't make fun of it, Ford,\" said his mother gently. \"It's too serious a matter.\"  Just then his father broke in, almost impatiently, with,--  \"Well, Ford, my boy, have you done your errand? or shall I have to see about it myself? You've been gone two days.\"  \"Thirty-seven hours and a half, father,\" replied Ford, taking out his watch. \"I've kept an exact account of my expenses. We've saved the cost of advertising.\"  \"And spent it on railroading,\" said his father, with a laugh.  \"But, Ford,\" asked Annie, \"did you find a house?--a good one?\"  \"Yes,\" added Mrs. Foster: \"now I'm sure you're safe, I do want to hear about the house.\"  \"It's all right, mother,\" said Ford confidently. \"The very house you told me to hunt for. Neither too large nor too small. I've only seen the outside of it, but every thing about it is in apple-pie order.\"  There were plenty of questions to answer now, but  Ford was every way equal to the occasion. Some of his answers might have made Mrs. Kinzer herself open her eyes, for the material for them had been obtained from her own neighbors.  Ford's report, in fact, compelled his father to look at him with an expression of face which very plainly meant,--  \"That's my boy. He resembles me. I was just like him, at his age. He'll be just like me, at mine.\"  There was excellent reason, beyond question, to approve of the manner in which the young gentleman had performed his errand in the country; and Mr. Foster promptly decided to go over in a day or two, and see what sort of an arrangement could be made with Mrs. Kinzer.      CHAPTER V.  NEW NEIGHBORS, AND GETTING SETTLED.   The week which followed the wedding-day was an important one.  The improvements on the Morris house were pushed along in a way that astonished everybody. Every day that passed, and with every dollar's worth of work that was done, the good points of the long-neglected old mansion came out stronger and stronger.  The plans of Mrs. Kinzer had been a good while in getting ready, and she knew exactly what was best to be done at every hole and corner.  Within a few days after Ford's trip of investigation, he and his father came over from the city; and Mr. Foster speedily came to a perfect understanding with Dabney's mother.  \"A very business-like, common-sense sort of a woman,\" the lawyer remarked to his son. \"But what a great, dangling, overgrown piece of a boy that is! Still, he seems intelligent, and you may find him good company.\"  \"No doubt of it,\" said Ford. \"I may be useful to him too. He looks as if he could learn if he only had a fair chance.\"  \"I should say so,\" responded Mr. Foster. \"We must not expect too much of fellows brought up away out here, as he has been.\"  Ford gravely assented, and they went back to report their success to Mrs. Foster and Annie.  There was a great surprise in store, consequently, for the people of the village. Early in the following week it was rumored from house to house,--  \"The Kinzers are all a-movin' over to Ham Morris's.\"  And then, before the public mind had become sufficiently settled to inquire into the matter, the rumor changed itself into a piece of positive news:--  \"The widder Kinzer's moved over into Ham's house, bag and baggage.\"  So it was; although the carpenters and painters and glaziers were still at work, and the piles of Kinzer furniture had to be stored around as best could be. Some part of them had even to be locked up over night in one of the barns.  The Kinzers, for generations, had been a trifle weak about furniture; and that was one of the reasons why there had been so little room for human beings in their house. The little parlor, indeed, had been filled until it put one in mind of a small furniture-store, with not room enough to show the stock on hand; and some of the other parts of the house required knowledge and care to walk about in them. It was bad for a small house, truly, but not so much so when the same articles were given a fair chance to spread themselves.  It was a treat to Dab to watch while the new carpets were put down, and see how much more at home and comfortable all that furniture looked, after it was moved into its new quarters. He remarked to Keziah,--  \"It won't be of any use for anybody to try to sit on that sofa and play the piano. They'll have to get up and come over.\"  Mrs. Kinzer took good care that the house she left should speak well of her to the eyes of Mrs. Foster, when that lady came to superintend the arrival of her own household goods.  The character of these, by the way, at once convinced the village gossips that \"lawyer Foster must be a good deal forehanded in money matters.\" And so he was, even more so than his furniture indicated.  Ford had a wonderful deal to do with the settlement of his family in their new home; and it was not until nearly the close of the week that he found time for more than an occasional glance over the north fence, although he and Dab had several times exchanged a word or two when they met each other on the road.  \"Take the two farms together,\" his father had said to him, \"and they make a really fine estate. I learn, too, that the Kinzers have other property. Your young acquaintance is likely to have a very good start in the world.\"  Ford had found out very nearly as much as that on his own account; but he had long since learned the uselessness of trying to teach his father any thing, however well he might succeed with ordinary people, and so he said nothing.  \"Dabney,\" said Mrs. Kinzer, that Friday evening, \"you've been a great help all the week. Suppose you take the ponies to-morrow morning, and ask young Foster out for a drive.\"  \"Mother,\" exclaimed Samantha, \"I shall want the ponies myself. I've some calls to make, and some shopping. Dabney will have to drive.\"  \"No, Sam,\" said Dabney: \"if you go out with the ponies to-morrow, you'll have my old clothes to drive you. I'll go and speak to them about it.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Samantha.  \"I mean, with Dick Lee in them.\"  \"That would be just as well,\" said Mrs. Kinzer. \"The ponies are gentle enough, and Dick drives well. He'll be glad enough to go.\"  \"Dick Lee, indeed!\" began Samantha.  \"A fine boy,\" interrupted Dab. \"And he's beginning to dress well. His new clothes fit him beautifully. All he really needs is a shirt, and I'll give him one. Mine are getting too small.\"  Samantha's fingers fidgeted a little with the tidy they were holding; but Mrs. Kinzer said composedly,--  \"Well, Dabney, I've been thinking about it. You ought not to be tied down all the while. Suppose you take next week pretty much to yourself: Samantha won't want the ponies every day. The other horses have all got to work, or I'd let you have one of them.\"  Dabney got up, for want of a better answer, and walked over to where his mother was sitting, and gave the thoughtful matron a good sounding kiss.  At the same time he could not help thinking,--  \"This comes of Ham Morris and my new rig.\"  \"There, Dabney, that'll do,\" said his mother; \"but how'll you spend Saturday?\"  \"Guess I'll take Ford Foster out in the bay, a-crabbing, if he'll go,\" replied Dabney. \"I'll run over and ask him.\"  It was not too late, and he was out of the house before there was any chance for further remarks from the girls.  \"Now,\" he muttered, as he walked along, \"I'll have to see old lawyer Foster, and Mrs. Foster, and I don't know who all besides. I don't like that.\"  Just as he came to the north fence, however, he was hailed by a clear, wide-awake voice,--  \"Dab Kinzer, is that you?\"  \"Guess so,\" said Dab: \"is that you, Ford?\"  \"I was just going over to your house,\" said Ford.  \"Well, so was I just coming over to see you. I've been too busy all the week, but they've let up on me at last.\"  \"I've got our family nearly settled,\" replied Ford; \"and I thought I'd ask if you wouldn't like to go out"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10340"],["title","Dab Kinzer: A Story of a Growing Boy (#5)"],["body"," the bay with me to-morrow. Teach you to catch crabs.\"  Dabney drew a long, astonished sort of whistle; but he finished it with,--  \"That's about what I was thinking of. There's plenty of crabs, and I've got a tip-top boat. We won't want a heavy one for just us two.\"  \"All right, then. We'll begin on crabs, but some other day we'll go for bigger fish. What are you going to do next week?\"  \"Got it all to myself,\" said Dab. \"We can have all sorts of a good time. We can have the ponies, too, when we want them.\"  \"That's about as good as it knows how to be,\" responded the young gentleman from the city. \"I'd like to explore the country. You're going to have a nice place of it, over there, before you get through. Only, if I'd had the planning of that house, I'd have set it back farther. Too much room all round it. Not enough trees either.\"  Dab came stoutly to the defence of not only that house, but of Long-Island architecture generally, and was fairly overwhelmed, for the first time in his life, by a flood of big words from a boy of his own age.  He could have eaten up Ford Foster, if properly cooked. He felt sure of that. But he was no match for him on the building question. On his way back to his new home, however, after the discussion had lasted long enough, he found himself inquiring,--  \"That's all very nice, but what can he teach me about crabs? We'll see about that to-morrow.\"  Beyond a doubt, the crab question was of special importance; but one of far greater consequence to Dab Kinzer's future was undergoing discussion, at that very hour, hundreds of miles away.  Quite a little knot of people there was, in a hotel parlor; and while the blooming Miranda, now Mrs. Morris, was taking her share of talk very well with the ladies, Ham was every bit as busy with a couple of elderly gentlemen.  \"It's just as I say, Mr. Morris,\" said one of the latter, with a superfluous show of energy: \"there's no better institution of its kind in the country than Grantley Academy. I send my own boys there; and I've just written about it to my brother-in-law, Foster, the New-York lawyer. He'll have his boy there this fall. No better place in the country, sir.\"  \"But how about the expenses, Mr. Hart?\" asked Ham.  \"Fees are just what I told you, sir, a mere nothing. As for board, all I pay for my boys is three dollars a week. All they want to eat, sir, and good accommodations. Happy as larks, sir, all the time. Cheap, sir, cheap.\"  If Ham Morris had the slightest idea of going to school at a New-England academy, Miranda's place in the improved house was likely to wait for her; for he had a look on his face of being very nearly convinced.  She did not seem at all disturbed, however; and probably she knew that her husband was not taking up the school question on his own account.  Nevertheless, that was the reason why it might have been interesting for Dab Kinzer, and even for his knowing neighbor, to have added themselves to the company Ham and Miranda had fallen in with on their wedding-tour.  Both of the boys had a different kind of thinking on hand; and that night Dab dreamed that a gigantic crab was trying to pull Ford Foster out of the boat, while the latter calmly remarked to him,--  \"There, my young friend, did you ever see anything just like that before?\"      CHAPTER VI.  CRABS, BOYS, AND A BOAT-WRECK.   That Saturday morning was a sad one for poor Dick Lee.  His mother, the previous night, carefully locked up his elegant apparel, the gift of Mr. Dabney Kinzer. It was done after Dick was in bed; and, when daylight came again, he found only his old clothes by the bedside.  It was a hard thing to bear, no doubt; but Dick had been a bad boy on Friday. He had sold his fish instead of bringing them home, and then had gone and squandered the money on a brilliant new red necktie.  \"Dat's good 'nuff for me to wear to meetin',\" said Mrs. Lee, when her eyes fell upon the gorgeous bit of cheap silk. \"Reckon it won't be wasted on any good-for-nuffin boy. I'll show ye wot to do wid yer fish. You' a-gettin' too mighty fine, anyhow.\"  Dick was disconsolate for a while; but his humility took the form of a determination to go for crabs that day, mainly because his mother had long since set her face against that tribe of animals.  \"Dey's a wasteful, 'stravagant sort ob fish,\" remarked Mrs. Lee, in frequent explanation of her dislike. \"Dey's all clo'es and no body, like some w'ite folks I know on. I don't mean de Kinzers. Dey's all got body nuff.\"  And yet that inlet had a name and reputation of its own for crabs. There was a wide reach of shallow water, inside the southerly point at the mouth, where, over several hundred acres of muddy flats, the depth varied from three and a half to eight feet, with the ebb and flow of the tides. That was a sort of perpetual crab-pasture; and there it was that Dick Lee determined to expend his energies that Saturday.  Very likely there would be other crabbers on the flats; but Dick was not the boy to object to that, provided none of them should notice the change in his raiment. At an early hour, therefore, Dab and Ford were preceded by their young colored friend, they themselves waiting for later breakfasts than Mrs. Lee was in the habit of preparing.  Dick's ill fortune did not leave him when he got out of sight of his mother. It followed him down to the shore of the inlet, and compelled him to give up, for that day, all idea of borrowing a respectable boat.  There were several, belonging to the neighbors, from among which Dick was accustomed to take his pick, in return for errands run and other services rendered to their owners; but on this particular morning not one of them all was available. Some were fastened with ugly chains and padlocks. Two were hauled away above even high-water mark, and so Dick could not have got either of them into the water even if he had dared to try; and as for the rest, as Dick said,--  \"Guess dar owners must hab come and borrered 'em.\"  The consequence was, that the dark-skinned young fisherman was for once compelled to put up with his own boat, or rather his father's.  The three wise men of Gotham were not much worse off when they went to sea in a bowl than was Dick Lee in that rickety little old flat-bottomed punt.  Did it leak?  Well, not so very much, with no heavier weight than Dick's; but there was reason in his remark that,--  \"Dis yer's a mean boat to frow down a fish in, when you cotch 'im. He's done suah to git drownded.\"  Yes, and the crabs would get their feet wet, and so would Dick; but he resigned himself to his circumstances, and pushed away. To tell the truth, he had not been able to free himself from a lingering fear lest his mother might come after him, before he could get afloat, with orders for some duty or other on shore; and that would have been worse than going to sea in the little old scow, a good deal.  \"Reckon it's all right,\" said Dick as he shoved off. \"It'd be an awful risk to trus' dem nice clo'es in de ole boat, suah.\"  Nice clothes, nice boats, a good many other nice things, were as yet beyond the reach of Dick Lee; but he was quite likely to catch as many crabs as his more aristocratic neighbors.  As for Dabney Kinzer and his friend from the city, they were on their way to the water-side, after all, at an hour which indicated either smaller appetites than usual or greater speed at the breakfast-table.  \"Plenty of boats, I should say,\" remarked Ford, as he surveyed the little \"landing\" and its vicinity with the air of a man who had a few fleets of his own. \"All sorts. Any of 'em fast?\"  \"Not many,\" said Dab. \"The row-boats, big and little, have to be built so they will stand pretty rough water.\"  \"How are the sail-boats?\"  \"Same thing. There's Ham Morris's yacht.\"  \"That? Why, she's as big as any in the lot.\"  \"Bigger; but she don't show it.\"  \"Can't we take a cruise in her?\" asked Ford.  \"Any time. Ham lets me use her whenever I like. She's fast enough, but she's built so she'll stand 'most any thing. Safe as a house if she's handled right.\"  \"Handled!\"  Ford Foster's expression of face would have done honor to the Secretary of the Navy, or the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee in Congress, or any other perfect seaman, Noah included. It seemed to say,--  \"As if any boat could be otherwise than well sailed, with me on board!\"  Dabney, however, even while he was talking, had been hauling in from its \"float and grapnel,\" about ten yards out at low water, the very stanch-looking little yawl-boat that called him owner. She was just such a boat as Mrs. Kinzer would naturally have provided for her boy,--stout, well-made, and sensible,--without any bad habits of upsetting or the like. Not too large for Dabney to manage all alone, \"The Jenny,\" as he called her, and as her name was painted on the stern, was all the better for having two on board, and had room in her then for more.  \"The inlet's pretty narrow for a long reach through the marsh,\" said Dabney, \"and as crooked as a ram's horn. I'll steer, and you pull, till we're out o' that, and then I'll take the oars.\"  \"I might as well row out to the crab-grounds,\" said Ford, as he pitched his coat forward, and took his seat at the oars. \"All ready?\"  \"Ready,\" said Dab; and \"The Jenny\" glided gracefully away from the landing with the starting-push he gave her.  Ford Foster had had oars in his hands before, but his experience had been limited to a class of vessels different in some respects from the one he was in now.  He was short of something, at all events. It may have been skill, or it may have been legs or discretion; but, whatever was lacking, at the third or fourth stroke the oar-blades went a little too deeply below the smooth surface of the water. There was a vain tug, a little out of \"time;\" and then there was a boy on the bottom of the boat, and a pair of well-polished shoes lifted high in the air.  \"You've got it,\" shouted Dabney.  \"Got what?\" exclaimed an all-but angry voice from down"]]]
