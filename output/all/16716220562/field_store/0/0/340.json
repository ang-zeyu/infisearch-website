We must find a man who can forestall all three of them by winning, first, the praetorian guard, and then the senate and the Romans by dint of sound reforms and justice.\"  \"You are he!  Rome trusts you.  So does the senate,\" said Cornificia. \"Marcia trusts me.  The praetorian guard trusts her. If I can persuade Marcia that her life is in danger from Commodus--\"  \"But how?\" Daedalus interrupted.  \"We can take the praetorian guard by surprise,\" Cornificia went on, ignoring him.  \"They can be tricked into declaring for the man whom Marcia's friends nominate.  Having once declared for him they will be too proud of having made an emperor, and too unwilling to seem vacillating, to reverse themselves in any man's favor, even though he should command six legions.  The senate will gladly accept one who has governed Rome as frugally as Pertinax has done.  If the senate confirms the nominee of the praetorian guard, the Roman populace will do the rest by acclamation.  Then, three months of upright government--deification by the senate--\"  Pertinax laughed explosively--an honest, chesty laugh, unqualified by any subtleties, suggesting a trace of the peasantry from which he sprang.  It made Cornificia wince.  \"Can you imagine me a god?\" he asked.  \"I can imagine you an emperor,\" said Sextus.  \"It is true;  you have no following among the legions just at present.  But I make one, and there are plenty of energetic men who think as I do.  My friend Norbanus here will follow me.  My father--\"   Noises near the open window interrupted him.  An argument seemed to be going on between the slaves whom Pertinax had set to keep the roisterers away and some one who demanded admission.  Near at hand was a woman's voice, shrilling and scolding.  Then another voice--Scylax, the slave who had ridden the red mare.  Pertinax strode to the window again and leaned out.  Cornificia whispered to Galen:  \"If the truth were known, he is afraid of Flavia Titiana.  As a wife she is bad enough, but as an empress--\"  Galen nodded.  \"If you love your Pertinax,\" he answered, \"keep him off the throne!  He has too many scruples.\"  She frowned, having few, which were firm and entirely devoted to Pertinax' fortune.  \"Love him?  I would give him up to see him deified!\" she whispered;  and again Galen nodded, deeply understanding.  \"That is because you have never had children,\" he assured her, smiling. \"You mother Pertinax, who is more than twice your age--just as Marcia has mothered that monster Commodus until her heart is breaking.\"  \"But I thought you were Pertinax' friend?\"  \"So I am.\"  \"And his urgent adviser to--\"  \"Yes, so I was.  I have changed my opinion;  only the maniacs never do that.  Pertinax would make a splendid minister for Lucius Severus;  and the two of them could bring back the Augustan days.  Persuade him to it. He must forget he hates him.\"  \"Let him come!\" said the voice of Pertinax.  He was still leaning out, with one hand on a marble pillar, much more interested in the moonlit view of revelry than in the altercation between slaves.  He strolled back and stood smiling at Cornificia, his handsome face expressing satisfaction but a rather humorous amusement at his inability to understand her altogether.  \"Are you like all other women?\" he asked.  \"I just saw a naked woman stab a man with her hairpin and kick his corpse into the shrubbery before the breath was out of it!\"  \"Galen has deserted you,\" said Cornificia.  The murder was uninteresting;  nobody made any comment.  \"Not he!\" Pertinax answered, and went and sat on Galen's couch. \"You find me not man enough for the senate to make a god of me--is that it, Galen?\"  \"Too much of a man to be an emperor,\" said Galen, smiling amid wrinkles. \"By observing a man's virtues one may infer what his faults are.  You would try to rule the empire honestly, which is impossible.  A more dishonest man would let it rule itself and claim the credit, whereas you would give the praise to others, who would shoulder off the work and all the blame on to you.  An empire is like a human body, which heals itself if the head will let it.  Too many heads--a conference of doctors--and the patient dies!  One doctor, doing nothing with an air of confidence, and the patient gets well!  There, I have told you more than all the senate knows!\"   Came Scylax, out of breath, less menial than most men's slaves, his head and shoulders upright and the hand that held a letter thrust well forward as if what he had to do were more important than the way he did it.  \"This came,\" he said, standing beside Sextus' couch.  \"Cadmus brought it, running all the way from Antioch.\"  His hand was trembling;  evidently Cadmus had by some means learned the contents of the letter and had told.  \"I and Cadmus--\" he said, and then hesitated.  \"What?\"  \"--are faithful, no matter what happens.\"  Scylax stood erect with closed lips.  Sextus broke the seal, merely glancing at Pertinax, taking permission for granted.  He frowned as he read, bit his lip, his face growing crimson and white alternately.  When he had mastered himself he handed the letter to Pertinax.  \"I always supposed you protected my father,\" he said, struggling to appear calm.  But his eyes gave the story away--grieved, mortified, indignant.  Scylax offered him his arm to lean on. Norbanus, setting both hands on his shoulders from behind, obliged him to sit down.  \"Calm!\" Norbanus whispered, \"Calm!  Your friends are your friends.  What has happened?\"  Pertinax read the letter and passed it to Cornificia, then paced the floor with hands behind him.  \"Is that fellow to be trusted?\" he asked with a jerk of his head toward Scylax.  He seemed nearly as upset as Sextus was.  Sextus nodded, not trusting himself to speak, knowing that if he did he would insult a man who might be guiltless in spite of appearances.  \"Commodus commanded me to visit Antioch, as he said, for a rest,\" said Pertinax.  \"The public excuse was, that I should look into the possibility of holding the Olympic games here.  Strangely enough, I suspected nothing.  He has been flatteringly friendly of late.  Those whom I requested him to spare, he spared, even though their names were on his proscription list and I had not better excuse than that they had done no wrong!  The day before I left I brought a list to him of names that I commended to his favor--your father's name among them, Sextus.\"  Pertinax turned his back again and strode toward the window, where he stood like a statue framed in the luminous gloom.  The only part of him that moved was his long fingers, weaving together behind him until the knuckles cracked.  Cornificia, subduing her contralto voice, read the letter aloud:   \"To Nimius Secundus Sextus, son of Galienus Maximus, the freedman Rufus Glabrio sends humble greeting.  \"May the gods give solace and preserve you.  Notwithstanding all your noble father's piety--his respect for elders and superiors--he was accused of treason and of blasphemy toward the emperor, by whose orders he was seized yesterday and beheaded the same day. The estates have already been seized.  It is said they will be sold to Asinus Sejanus, who is probably the source of the accusation against your father.  \"I and three other freedmen made our escape and will attempt to reach Tarentum, where we will await instructions from you. Titus, the son of the freedman Paulinus, will convey this letter to Brundisium and thence by boat to Dyrrachium, whence he will send it by post in the charge of a Jew whom he says he can trust.  \"It is a certainty that orders will go forth to seize yourself, since the estates in Antioch are known to be of great value. Therefore, we your true friends and devoted servants, urge you to make all speed in escaping.  Stay not to make provision for yourself, but travel without encumbrances.  Hide!  Hasten!  \"We commend this letter to you as a sure proof that we ourselves are to be trusted, since, if it should fall into the hands of an informer by the way, our lives undoubtedly would pay the forfeit. We have not much money, but enough for the expenses of a journey to a foreign land.  The place where we will hide near Tarentum is known to you.  In deep anxiety, and not without such sacrifices to the gods and to the manes of your noble ancestors as means permit, we will await your coming.\" --RUFUS GLABRIO \"Freedman of the illustrious Galienus Maximus.\"  Pertinax turned from the window.  \"The Jews have a saying,\" he said, \"that who keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from trouble.  Often I warned Maximus that he was too free with his speech. He counted too much on my protection.  Now it remains to be seen whether Commodus has not proscribed me!\"  Sextus and Norbanus stood together, Scylax behind them, Norbanus whispering;  plainly enough Norbanus was urging patience--discretion-- deliberate thought, whereas Sextus could hardly think at all for anger that reddened his eyes.  \"What can I do for you?  What can I do?\" wondered Pertinax.  Then Cornificia was on her feet.  \"There is nothing--nothing you can do!\" she insisted.  She avoided Galen's eyes;  the old philosopher was watching her as if she were the subject of some new experiment.  \"Let Commodus learn as much as that Sextus was here in this pavilion and--\"  Sextus interrupted, very proudly:  \"I will not endanger my friends.  Who will lend me a dagger? This toy that I wear is too short and not sharp.  You may forget me, Pertinax. My slaves will bury me.  But play you the man and save Rome!\"  Then the tribune spoke up.  He was younger than all of them.  \"Sextus is right.  They will know he was here.  They will probably torture his slaves and learn about that letter that has reached him.  If he runs and hides, we shall all be accused of having helped him to escape;  whereas--\"  \"What?\"  Galen asked him as he hesitated.  \"If he dies by his own hand, he will not only save all his slaves from the torture but remove the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10422"],["title","Caesar Dies (#6)"],["body","from us and we will still be free to mature our--\"  \"Cowardice!\"  Norbanus finished the sentence for him.  \"Aye, some of us would hardly feel like noble Romans!\" Pertinax said grimly.  \"Possibly I can protect you, Sextus.  Let us think of some great favor you can do the emperor, providing an excuse for me to interfere.  I might even take you to Rome with me and--\"  Galen laughed, and Cornificia drew in her breath, bit her lip.  \"Why do you laugh, Galen?\" Pertinax strode over to him and stood staring.  \"Because,\" said Galen, \"I know so little after all.  I cannot tell a beast's blood from a man's.  Our Commodus would kill you with all the more peculiar enjoyment because he has flattered you so often publicly and called you 'father Pertinax.'  He poisoned his own father;  why not you?  They will tell him you have frequently befriended Sextus.  They will show him Sextus' father's name on that list of names that you commended to his favor.  Do you follow me?\"  \"By Jupiter, not I!\" said Pertinax.  \"He is sure to learn about this letter that has come.\" said Galen.  \"If you, in fearful loyalty to Commodus, should instantly attempt to make a prisoner of Sextus;  if, escaping, he is killed, and you bear witness-- that would please Commodus almost as much as to see gladiators killed in the arena.  If you wept over the death of Sextus, that would please him even more.  He would enjoy your feelings.  Do you remember how he picked two gladiators who were brothers twins they were--and when the slayer of his twin-brother saluted, Commodus got down into the arena and kissed him?  You yourself must announce to him the news of Sextus' death, and he will kiss you also!\"  \"Vale!\" remarked Sextus.  \"I die willingly enough.\"  \"You are dead already,\" Galen answered.  \"Didn't Pertinax see some one's body kicked into the bushes?\"  There was silence.  They all glanced at one another.  Only Galen, sipping at his wine, seemed philosophically calm.  \"I personally should not be an eye-witness,\" Galen remarked.  \"I am a doctor, whose certificate of death not even Commodus would doubt.  In the dark I might recognize Sextus' garments, even though I could not see his features.  And--\" he added pointedly--\"neither I nor any one can tell a beast's blood from a man's.\"  \"Daedalus!\" said Pertinax with sudden resolution.  \"Get my purse. My slave has it.  Sextus shall not go empty-handed.\"     III.  MATERNUS-LATRO    Sorbanus brought the skewbald stallion.  Not far away a group of women danced around a dozen drunken men, who sang uproariously. Seen against the background of purple and dark-green gloom, with crimson torchlight flaring on the quiet water and the moon descending behind trees beyond them, they were mystically beautiful--seemed not to belong to earth, any more than the pan-pipe music did.  \"Ride into their midst!\" Norbanus urged, pointing.  \"Tickle the stallion thus.\"  The Cappadocian lashed out savagely.  \"Here is a bottle of goat's blood.  I will bring weapons, and I will join you as soon as possible after I have made sure that the temple priests, and all Daphne, are positive about your death. Now mount and ride!\"  Sextus swung on to the stallion's back as if a catapult had thrown him. Until then he had let others do the ordering;  he had preferred to let them take their own precautions, form their own plans and subject himself to any course they wished, after which he should be free to face his destiny and fight it without feeling he had handicapped his friends by wilfulness.  He had not even issued a direct command to Scylax, his own slave.  That was characteristic of him.  Nor was it at his suggestion that Norbanus volunteered to share his outlawry.  But it was also characteristic that he made no gesture of dissent;  he accepted Norbanus' loyalty with a quiet smile that rather scorned words as unnecessary.  Now he drove his heels into the Cappadocian with vigor, for the die was cast.  The stallion, impatient of new mastery, reared and plunged, snorted, came back on the bit in an attempt to get it in his teeth, and bolted straight for the group of roisterers, who scattered away, men swearing, women screaming.  Throwing back his weight against the reins, he brought the stallion to a plunging, snorting, wheeling halt in the midst of men and women--a terrifying monster blowing clouds of mist out of his nostrils! As they ran he let the brute rear--pulled him over-- rolled from under him, and lay still, with goat's blood from the broken bottle splashed around his face and seeming to flow from his mouth.  One woman stooped to look, groped for a purse or anything of value, screamed and ran.  \"Sextus!\" she yelled.  \"Sextus who was dining in the white pavilion!\"  Sextus crawled among the oleanders.  Presently Norbanus came, hurrying out of gloom, accompanied by Cadmus, the slave who had brought from Antioch the letter that came from Rome.  They were dragging a body between them.  They laid it down exactly where Sextus had fallen from the horse.  There was a sickening thwack as Cadmus made the face unrecognizable.  Then came the lanky, hurrying figure of Pertinax leading a group of people, Cornificia among them--Galen last.  Sextus lay still until all their backs were toward him.  Then he crept out of the oleanders and walked along the river-bank in no haste, masking his face with a fold of his toga.  He chose a path that wound amid the shrubbery, where marble satyrs grinned in colored lantern light.  He had to avoid couples here and there. A woman followed him, laying a hand on his arm;  he struck her, and she ran off, screaming for her bully.  Presently he reached the winding track that led toward the high-road, with the gloom of cypresses on either hand and, beyond that, the glow of the lights in the caterers' booths.  He was as safe now as if he were fifty miles away;  none noticed him except the beggars at the bridges, who exposed maimed limbs and whined for charity.  A leper, banking on his only stock in trade--the dread men had of his affliction--cursed him.  \"You waste breath,\" said Sextus and passed on.  He was smiling to himself--sardonically.  \"Lepers live by threats--\" he thought.  No more than any leper now could he expect protection from society beyond what he could force society to yield.  He had no name, for he was dead;  that thought amused him.  Suddenly it dawned on him how safe he was, since none in Antioch would dare to question the word of Pertinax, backed by Galen and all the witnesses whom Pertinax would be sure to summon.  He remembered then to protect the honest freedmen who had sent him warning--strode to a fire near a caterer's booth and burned the letter, stared at by the slaves who warmed their shins around the embers.  One of those might have recognized him, in spite of the toga drawn over his face.  \"If any one should ask which way Maternus went, say I have gone home,\" he commanded, and strode away into the gloom.  He wondered why he had chosen the name Maternus.  Not even his remotest ancestor had borne it, yet it came to his lips as naturally, instantly, as if it were his own by right.  But as he walked away it came to mind that ten, or possibly twelve, nights ago he and his friends had all been talking of a highwayman Maternus, who had robbed the caravans on the mountain road from Tarsus.  For the moment that thought scared him. Should he change the name?  The slaves by the embers had stared;  they showed him respect, but there was a distinct sensation mingled with it-- hardly to be wondered at!  Where was it he heard--who told him--that Maternus had been caught?  He could not remember.  It dawned on him how difficult it is to decide what to do when the old familiar conditions and the expectations on which we habitually base decisions are all suddenly stripped away.  He understood now how a general in the field can fail when suddenly confronted with the unknown. Shall he do this, or do that? There was not a habit or a circumstance to guide him.  He must choose, the while the gods looked on and laughed!  Maternus.  It was a strange name to adopt, and yet he liked the sound of it, nor would it pass out of his mind.  He tried to think of other names, but either they had all been borne by slaves, and were distasteful, or else by famous men or by his friends, whom he did not propose to wrong;  he only had to imagine his case reversed to realize how bitterly he would resent it if an outlawed man should take his own name and make it notorious.  Yet he perceived that notoriety would be his only refuge, paradox though that might be.  As a mere fugitive, anonymous and having no more object than to live and avoid recognition, he would soon reach the end of his tether;  there was little mercy in the world for men without a home or means.  Whether recognized or not, he would become like a hunted animal --might, in fact, end as a slave unless he should prefer to prove his identity and submit to Commodus's executioners.  Suicide would be preferable to that; but it seemed almost as if the gods themselves had vetoed self-destruction by providing that roisterer's corpse at the critical moment and putting the plan for its use into Galen's wise old head.  He must take the field like Spartacus of old;  but he must have a goal more definite and more attainable than Spartacus had had. He must avoid the mistake that weakened Spartacus, of accepting for the sake of numbers any ally who might offer himself.  He would have nothing whatever to do with the rabble of runaway slaves, whose only guiding impulse would be loot and license, although he knew how easy it would be to raise such an army if he should choose to do it.  Out of any hundred outlaws in the records of a hundred years, some ninety-nine had come to grief through the increasing numbers of their following and lack of discipline;  he could think of a dozen who had been betrayed by paid informers of the government, posing as friendly brigands.  And besides, he had no"]]]
