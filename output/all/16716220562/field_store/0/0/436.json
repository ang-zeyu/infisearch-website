Damascus is simply a network of spies of that kind--men who attached themselves to the Arab cause when it looked like winning and are now busy transferring their allegiance.  \"I think I could name the man who wrote this;  I think I know the man who wrote that magnifique.  If I'm right, Yussuf Dakmar will notify the French tonight through their agents in Jerusalem.  The man who wrote that magnifique will know before morning that the letter's missing;  and it doesn't matter how careful I may be, it'll be known as soon as I start for Damascus.  \"They'll dope out that our obvious course would be to confront Feisul with this letter.  The only way to travel is by train; the roads are rotten--in fact, no auto could get through;  they'd tip off the Bedouins, who'd murder everybody.  \"So they'll watch the trains and especially Haifa, where everyone going north has to spend the night;  and they'll stop at nothing to get the letter back, for two reasons;  as long as it's in our hands it can be used to establish proof of the plot against Feisul;  once it's back in theirs, they can keep it in their secret dossier to use against Feisul if they ever catch him and bring him to trial.  You remember the Dreyfus case?  \"I shall start for Damascus by the early train--probably take an auto as far as Ludd.  If I want to live until I reach Damascus I shall have to prove conclusively that I haven't that letter with me.  Anyone known to be in British service is going to be suspected and, if not murdered, robbed.  Ramsden has been seen about too much with me.  Jeremy might juggle by but he's already notorious, and these people are shrewd. Better hold Jeremy in reserve, and the same with Narayan Singh.  A woman's best.  How about you, Mabel?\"  \"What d'you mean, Jim?\"  \"Do you know a woman in Haifa?\"  \"Of course I do.\"  \"Well enough to expect a bed for the night at a moment's notice?\"  \"Certainly.\"  Mabel's eyes were growing very bright indeed.  It was her husband who looked alarmed.  \"Well, now, here's the point.\"  Grim leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette, not looking at anybody, stating his case impersonally, as it were, which is much the shrewdest way of being personal.  \"Feisul's up against it, and he's the best man in all this land, bar none.  They've dealt to him from a cold deck, and he's bound to lose this hand whichever way he plays it.  To put it differently, he's in check, but not checkmated.  He'll be checkmated, though, if the French ever lay hands on him, and then good-bye to the Arab's chance for twenty years.  \"I propose to save him for another effort, and the only way to do that is to convince him.  The best way to convince him is to show him that letter, which can't be done if Feisul's enemies discover who carries it. If Ramsden, Jeremy, Narayan Singh and I start for Damascus, pretending that one or other of us has the letter concealed on his person, and if a woman really carries it, we'll manage.  Is Mabel Ticknor going to be the woman?  That's the point.\"  \"Too dangerous, Jim!  Too dangerous!\"  Ticknor put in nervously.  \"Pardon me, old man.  The danger is for us four, who pretend we've got the thing.\"  \"There are lots of other women and I've only got one wife!\" objected Ticknor.  \"We're pressed for time,\" Grim answered.  \"You see, Ticknor, old man, you're a Cornstalk and therefore an outsider--just a medico, who saws bones for a living, satisfied to keep your body out of the poorhouse, your soul out of hell, and your name out of the newspapers.  Your wife is presumably more so.  There are several officials' wives who would jump at the chance to be useful;  but a sudden trip toward Damascus just now would cause any one of them to be suspected, whereas Mabel wouldn't be.\"  \"I don't know why not!\" Ticknor retorted.  \"Wasn't she in here when those three murderers came to finish the lot of us?  If Yussuf Dakmar makes any report at all he'll surely say he traced the letter to this house.\"  \"Yussuf Dakmar came no nearer than the street,\" Grim answered. \"He has no notion who is in here.  His three friends are in jail under lock and key, where he can't get at them.  How long have you had this house? Since yesterday, isn't it?  D'you kid yourself that Yussuf Dakmar knows who lives here?\"  \"I can get leave of absence.  Suppose I go in Mabel's place?\" suggested Ticknor, visibly worried.  \"The mere fact that she goes, while you stay here, will be presumptive evidence that she isn't on a dangerous mission,\" Grim answered.  \"No. It has got to be a woman.  If Mabel won't go I'll find someone else.\"  You could tell by Mabel's eyes and attitude that she was what the salesmen call \"sold\" already;  but you didn't need a magnifying glass to detect that Ticknor wasn't.  Men of his wandering habit know too well what a brave, good-tempered wife means to encourage her to take long chances;  for although there are lots of women who would like to wander and accept the world's pot luck, there are precious few capable of doing it without doubling a fellow's trouble;  when they know how to halve the trouble and double the fun they're priceless.  Grim played his usual game, which is to spank down his ace of trumps face upward on the table.  Most of us forget what are trumps in a crisis.  \"I guess it's up to you, doc,\" he said, turning toward Ticknor. \"There's nothing in it for you.  Feisul isn't on the make;  I don't believe he cares ten cents who is to be the nominal ruler of the Arabs, provided they get their promised independence. He'd rather retire and live privately.  But he only considers himself in so far as he can serve the Arab cause.  Now, you've risked Mabel's life a score of times in order to help sick men in mining camps, and malaria victims and Lord knows what else. Here's a chance to do the biggest thing of all--\"  \"Of course, if you put it that way...\" said Ticknor, hesitating.  \"Just your style too.  Nobody will know.  No bouquets.  You won't have to stammer a speech at any dinner given in your honor.\"   \"D'you want to do it, Mabel?\" asked Ticknor, looking at her keenly across the table.  \"Of course I do!\"  \"All right, girl.  Only, hurry back.\"  He looked hard at Grim again, then into my eyes and then Jeremy's.  \"She's in your hands.  I don't want to see any of you three chaps alive again unless she comes back safe.  Is that clear?\"  \"Clear and clean!\" exploded Jeremy.  \"It's a bet, doc.  Half a mo', you chaps;  that's my mine at Abu Kem, isn't it?  I've agreed to give the thing to Feisul and make what terms I can with him.  Jim and Rammy divvy up with me on my end, if any.  That right?  I say;  let the doc and Mabel have a half-share each of anything our end amounts to.\"  Well, it took about as long to settle that business as you'd expect. The doctor and Mabel protested, but it's easier to give away a fortune that is still in prospect than a small sum that is really tangible--I mean between folk who stand on their own feet. It doesn't seem to deprive the giver of much, or to strain the pride of the recipient unduly.  I've been given shares in unproven El Doradoes times out of number, and could paper the wall of, say, a good-sized bathroom with the stock certificates--may do it some day if I ever settle down.  But the only gift of that sort that I ever knew to pay dividends, except to the printer of the gilt-edged scrip, is Jeremy's gold mine;  and you'll look in vain for any mention of that in the stock exchange lists.  The time to get in on that good thing was that night by Mabel Ticknor's teapot in Jerusalem.  It was nearly midnight before we had everything settled, and there was still a lot to do before we could catch the morning train.  One thing that Grim did was to take gum and paper and contrive an envelope that looked in the dark sufficiently like the alleged Feisul letter;  and he carried that in his hand as he took to the street, with Narayan Singh following among the shadows within hail.  Jeremy and I kept Narayan Singh in sight, for it was possible that Yussuf Dakmar had gathered a gang to waylay whoever might emerge from the house.  But he seemed to have had enough of bungling accomplices that night. Grim hadn't gone fifty paces, keeping well in the middle of the road, when a solitary shadow began stalking him, and doing it so cautiously that though he had to cross the circles of street lamplight now and then neither Jeremy nor I could have identified him afterward.  Narayan Singh had orders not to do anything but guard Grim against assault, for Grim judged it wise to leave Yussuf Dakmar at large than to precipitate a climax by arresting him.  He had the names of most of the local conspirators, and if the leader were seized too soon the equally dangerous rank and file might scatter and escape.  Down inside the Jaffa Gate, in a dark alley beside the Grand Hotel, there are usually two or three cabs standing at any hour of the night ready to care for belated Christian gentlemen who have looked on the wine when it was any colour that it chanced to be.  There were three there, and Grim took the first one, flourishing his envelope carelessly under the corner lamp.  Yussuf Dakmar took the next in line, and ordered the driver to follow Grim.  So we naturally took the last one, all three of us crowding on to the rear seat in order to watch the cabs in front. But as soon as we had driven back outside the city gate Yussuf Dakmar looked behind him and, growing suspicious of us, ordered his driver to let us pass.  It would have been too obvious if we had stopped too, so we hid our faces as we passed, and then put Jeremy on the front seat, he looking like an Arab and being most unrecognizable.  Yussuf Dakmar followed us at long range, and as the lean horses toiled slowly up the Mount of Olives to headquarters the interval between the cabs grew greater.  By the time we reached the guard-house and answered the Sikh sentry's challenge there was no sign of Grim in front, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10552"],["title","Roy Blakeley: His Story (#0)"],["body","made available by Internet Archive (https://archive.org)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Right away I have trouble with Pee-wee Harris. He’s about as easy to keep down as a balloon full of gas. We call him the young dirigible because he’s always going up in the air. Even at the start he must stick in his chapter heading about a conclave.  Hanged if I know what a conclave is. It’s some kind of a meeting I guess. He said it was something like a peace conference, but believe me, the meeting I’m going to tell you about wasn’t much like a peace conference. I told him I’d use my own heading and his too, just to keep him quiet. I think he’s got his pockets stuffed full of chapter headings and that he’ll be shooting them at me all the way through—like a machine-gun.  I guess I might as well tell you about Pee-wee, before I tell you about the conclave or whatever you call it. He’s Doctor Harris’s son and he’s a member of the Raven Patrol. He’s a member in good standing, only he doesn’t stand very high. Honest, you can hardly see him without a magnifying glass. But for voice—_good night_!  He sings in the Methodist Church choir and they say he can throw his voice anywhere. I wish he’d throw it in the ash barrel, I know that.  He always wears his belt-axe to troop meetings, in case the Germans should invade Bridgeboro, I suppose. He’s the troop mascot and if you walk around him three times and ruffle up his beautiful curly hair, you can change your luck.  Well, now I’ll tell you about the meeting. We had a big special meeting to decide about two things, and believe me, those two things had momentous consequences. _Momentous_—that’s a good word, hey?  One thing, we wanted to decide about our campaign for collecting books for soldiers, and another thing, we wanted to decide how we could all go up to Temple Camp in our cabin launch, the _Good Turn_.  This large and what-do-you-call-it launch—I mean commodious launch—is a dandy boat, except for one thing—the bow is too near the stern. If we were sardines instead of boy scouts, it would be all right, but you see there’s twenty-four of us altogether, not counting Captain Kidd, our mascot—he’s a parrot.  So I got up and said, “How are we going to crowd twenty-four growing boys and a parrot into a twenty foot launch?”  “It can’t be did,” Doc Carson shouted.  “Then some of us will have to hike it on our dear little feet,” I said.  “Or else we’ll have to get a barge or something or other and tow it,” Artie Van Arlen said.  “What, with a three horsepower engine?” somebody else shouted.  “You can bet I won’t be one of the ones to hike it,” Pee-wee yelled; “I’ll dope out some scheme or other.”  And _believe me_, he did.  Well, after we’d been talking about an hour or so on how we’d manage it, Mr. Ellsworth, our scoutmaster, up and said there was plenty of time for that as long as we were not going to camp for a couple of weeks anyway, and that we’d better begin thinking of how we were going to start about collecting books for soldiers.  All the while I had something very important to say, and I was kind of trembling, as you might say, for I thought maybe Mr. Ellsworth wouldn’t like the idea. Anyway I got up and began:  “The author that wrote all about ‘Tom Slade’s Adventures in the World War’,” I said, “told me it would be a good idea for me to write up our troop’s adventures and he’d help me to get them published.”  Then up jumped Pee-wee Harris like a jack-in-the-box.  “What are you talking about?” he shouted; “don’t you know you have to have a command of language to write books? You’re crazy!”  “I should worry about a command of language,” I told him. “Haven’t I got command of the Silver Fox Patrol? Anybody who can command the Silver Fox Patrol ought to be able to command a few languages and things. I could command a whole regiment even,” I kept up, for I saw that Pee-wee was getting worked up, as usual, and all the fellows were laughing, even Mr. Ellsworth.  “If you could command a division,” Westy Martin said, in that sober way of his, “you ought to be able to command English all right.”  “I can command any kind of a division,” I shouted, all the while winking at Westy. “I can command a long division or a short division or a multiplication or a subtraction or a plain addition.”  “What are you talking about?” Pee-wee yelled. “You’re crazy!”  “I can command anything except Pee-wee Harris’s temper,” I said.  Well, you ought to have seen Pee-wee. Even Mr. Ellsworth had to laugh.  “How can a fellow your age write books?” he fairly screamed. “You have to have sunsets and twilights and gurgling brooks and——”  “You leave the gurgling brooks to me,” I said; “I’ll make them gurgle all right. There’s going to be plenty of action in these books. And Pee-wee Harris is going to be the village cut-up.”  “Are you going to have girls?” he shouted.  “Sure I’m going to have girls—gold haired girls—all kinds—take your pick.”  “_Good night!_” Pee-wee shouted, “I see your finish.”  Well, pretty soon everybody was shouting at the same time and Pee-wee was dancing around, saying we were all crazy. Most of the Raven Patrol were with him and they ought to be called the Raving Patrol, believe _me_.  Then Mr. Ellsworth held up his hand in that quiet way he has. “This sounds like the Western Front or a Bolsheviki meeting,” he said, “and I’m afraid our young Raven, Mr. Pee-wee Harris, will presently explode and that would be an unpleasant episode for any book.”  “Good night!” I said. “Don’t want any of my books to end with an explosion.”  Then he said how it would be a good idea for me to write up our adventures and how he’d help me whenever I got stuck and how he guessed the author of Tom Slade would put in fancy touches for me, because he lives in our town and he’s a whole lot interested in our troop. He said that breezes and distant views and twilights and things aren’t so hard when you get used to them and even storms and hurricanes are easy if you only know how. He said girls aren’t so easy to manage though.  “I’ll help you out with the girls,” Pee-wee said; “I know all about girls. And I’ll help you with the names of the chapters, too.”  “All right,” Mr. Ellsworth said, “I think Pee-wee will prove a valuable collaborator.”  “A which?” Pee-wee said, kind of frightened.  So then we all laughed and Mr. Ellsworth said it was getting late and we’d better settle about collecting books for the soldiers.  We decided that after we got to camp I’d begin writing up our adventures on the trip, but we couldn’t decide how we’d all go in our boat, and that was the thing that troubled us a lot, because the fellows in our troop always hang together and we didn’t like the idea of being separated.  Well, I guess that’s all there is to tell you about the meeting, and in the next chapter I’m going to tell you all about how we collected the books for the fellows in camp, and how the mystery about the boat was solved. Those are Pee-wee’s words about the _mystery of the boat_. I can’t see that there was any mystery about it, but there was another kind of a mystery, believe me, and that kid was the cause of it. I guess maybe you’ll like the next chapter better than this one.  So long.                                    CHAPTER II                              SWATTING THE SPY   Now I’m going to tell you about how we collected books for soldiers and especially about Pee-wee’s big stunt.  The next morning we started out and by night we had over five hundred books. Mr."]]]
