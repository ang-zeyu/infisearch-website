She preferred fools, you see, but she would never have cared for a middle-aged penniless fool like me. And so,\" he ended, with a vicious outburst of mendacity, \"I never told her, and she married a title and lived unhappily in gilded splendor ever afterwards.\"  \"You should have told her, Olaf,\" Miss Stapylton persisted; and then she asked, in a voice that came very near being inaudible: \"Is it too late to tell her now, Olaf?\"  The stupid man opened his lips a little, and stood staring at her with hungry eyes, wondering if it were really possible that she did not hear the pounding of his heart; and then his teeth clicked, and he gave a despondent gesture.  \"Yes,\" he said, wearily, \"it is too late now.\"  Thereupon Miss Stapylton tossed her head. \"Oh, very well!\" said she; \"only, for my part, I think you acted very foolishly, and I don't see that you have the least right to complain. I quite fail to see how you could have expected her to marry you--or, in fact, how you can expect any woman to marry you,--if you won't, at least, go to the trouble of asking her to do so!\"  Then Miss Stapylton went into the house, and slammed the door after her.     III   Nor was that the worst of it. For when Rudolph Musgrave followed her--as he presently did, in a state of considerable amaze,--his sister informed him that Miss Stapylton had retired to her room with an unaccountable headache.  And there she remained for the rest of the evening. It was an unusually long evening.  Yet, somehow, in spite of its notable length--affording, as it did, an excellent opportunity for undisturbed work,--Colonel Musgrave found, with a pricking conscience, that he made astonishingly slight progress in an exhaustive monograph upon the fragmentary Orderly Book of an obscure captain in a long-forgotten regiment, which if it had not actually served in the Revolution, had at least been demonstrably granted money \"for services,\" and so entitled hundreds of aspirants to become the Sons (or Daughters) of various international disagreements.  Nor did he see her at breakfast--nor at dinner.     IV   A curious little heartache accompanied Colonel Musgrave on his way home that afternoon. He had not seen Patricia Stapylton for twenty-four hours, and he was just beginning to comprehend what life would be like without her. He did not find the prospect exhilarating.  Then, as he came up the orderly graveled walk, he heard, issuing from the little vine-covered summer-house, a loud voice. It was a man's voice, and its tones were angry.  \"No! no!\" the man was saying; \"I'll agree to no such nonsense, I tell you! What do you think I am?\"  \"I think you are a jackass-fool,\" Miss Stapylton said, crisply, \"and a fortune-hunter, and a sot, and a travesty, and a whole heap of other things I haven't, as yet had time to look up in the dictionary. And I think--I think you call yourself an English gentleman? Well, all I have to say is God pity England if her gentlemen are of your stamp! There isn't a costermonger in all Whitechapel who would dare talk to me as you've done! I would like to snatch you bald-headed, I would like to kill you--And do you think, now, if you were the very last man left in all the _world_ that I would--No, don't you try to answer me, for I don't wish to hear a single word you have to say. Oh, oh! how _dare_ you!\"  \"Well, I've had provocation enough,\" the man's voice retorted, sullenly. \"Perhaps, I have cut up a bit rough, Patricia, but, then, you've been talkin' like a fool, you know. But what's the odds? Let's kiss and make up, old girl.\"  \"Don't touch me!\" she panted; \"ah, don't you _dare!_\"  \"You little devil! you infernal little vixen? You'll jilt me, will you?\"  \"Let me go!\" the girl cried, sharply. Rudolph Musgrave went into the summer-house.  The man Colonel Musgrave found there was big and loose-jointed, with traces of puffiness about his face. He had wheat-colored hair and weakish-looking, pale blue eyes. One of his arms was about Miss Stapylton, but he released her now, and blinked at Rudolph Musgrave.  \"And who are you, pray?\" he demanded, querulously. \"What do you want, anyhow? What do you mean by sneakin' in here and tappin' on a fellow's shoulder--like a damn' woodpecker, by Jove! I don't know you.\"  There was in Colonel Musgrave's voice a curious tremor, when he spoke; but to the eye he was unruffled, even faintly amused.  \"I am the owner of this garden,\" he enunciated, with leisurely distinctness, \"and it is not my custom to permit gentlewomen to be insulted in it. So I am afraid I must ask you to leave it.\"  \"Now, see here,\" the man blustered, weakly, \"we don't want any heroics, you know. See here, you're her cousin, ain't you? By God, I'll leave it to you, you know! She's treated me badly, don't you understand. She's a jilt, you know. She's playin' fast and loose----\"  He never got any further, for at this point Rudolph Musgrave took him by the coat-collar and half-dragged, half-pushed him through the garden, shaking him occasionally with a quiet emphasis. The colonel was angry, and it was a matter of utter indifference to him that they were trampling over flower-beds, and leaving havoc in their rear.  But when they had reached the side-entrance, he paused and opened it, and then shoved his companion into an open field, where a number of cows, fresh from the evening milking, regarded them with incurious eyes. It was very quiet here, save for the occasional jangle of the cow-bells and the far-off fifing of frogs in the marsh below.  \"It would have been impossible, of course,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"for me to have offered you any personal violence as long as you were, in a manner, a guest of mine. This field, however, is the property of Judge Willoughby, and here I feel at liberty to thrash you.\"  Then he thrashed the man who had annoyed Patricia Stapylton.  That thrashing was, in its way, a masterpiece. There was a certain conscientiousness about it, a certain thoroughness of execution--a certain plodding and painstaking carefulness, in a word, such as is possible only to those who have spent years in guiding fat-witted tourists among the antiquities of the Lichfield Historical Association.  \"You ought to exercise more,\" Rudolph Musgrave admonished his victim, when he had ended. \"You are entirely too flabby now, you know. That path yonder will take you to the hotel, where, I imagine, you are staying. There is a train leaving Lichfield at six-fifteen, and if I were you, I would be very careful not to miss that train. Good-evening. I am sorry to have been compelled to thrash you, but I must admit I have enjoyed it exceedingly.\"  Then he went back into the garden.     V   In the shadow of a white lilac-bush, Colonel Musgrave paused with an awed face.  \"Good Lord!\" said he, aghast at the notion; \"what would Agatha say if she knew I had been fighting like a drunken truck-driver! Or, rather, what would she refrain from saying! Only, she wouldn't believe it of me. And, for the matter of that,\" Rudolph Musgrave continued, after a moment's reflection, \"I wouldn't have believed it of myself a week ago. I think I am changing, somehow. A week ago I would have fetched in the police and sworn out a warrant; and, if the weather had been as damp as it is, I would have waited to put on my rubbers before I would have done that much.\"     VI   He found her still in the summer-house, expectant of him, it seemed, her lips parted, her eyes glowing. Rudolph Musgrave, looking down into twin vivid depths, for a breathing-space, found time to rejoice that he had refused to liken them to stars. Stars, forsooth!--and, pray, what paltry sun, what irresponsible comet, what pallid, clinkered satellite, might boast a purple splendor such as this? For all asterial scintillations, at best, had but a clap-trap glitter; whereas the glow of Patricia's eyes was a matter worthy of really serious attention.  \"What have you done with him, Olaf?\" the girl breathed, quickly.  \"I reasoned with him,\" said Colonel Musgrave. \"Oh, I found him quite amenable to logic. He is leaving Lichfield this evening, I think.\"  Thereupon Miss Stapylton began to laugh. \"Yes,\" said she, \"you must have remonstrated very feelingly. Your tie's all crooked, Olaf dear, and your hair's all rumpled, and there's dust all over your coat. You would disgrace a rag-bag. Oh, I'm glad you reasoned--that way! It wasn't dignified, but it was dear of you, Olaf. Pevensey's a beast.\"  He caught his breath at this. \"Pevensey!\" he stammered; \"the Earl of Pevensey!--the man you are going to marry!\"  \"Dear me, no!\" Miss Stapylton answered, with utmost unconcern; \"I would sooner marry a toad. Why, didn't you know, Olaf? I thought, of course, you knew you had been introducing athletics and better manners among the peerage! That sounds like a bill in the House of Commons, doesn't it?\" Then Miss Stapylton laughed again, and appeared to be in a state of agreeable, though somewhat nervous, elation. \"I wrote to him two days ago,\" she afterward explained, \"breaking off the engagement. So he came down at once and was very nasty about it.\"  \"You--you have broken your engagement,\" he echoed, dully; and continued, with a certain deficiency of finesse, \"But I thought you wanted to be a countess?\"  \"Oh, you boor, you vulgarian!\" the girl cried, \"Oh, you do put things so crudely, Olaf! You are hopeless.\"  She shook an admonitory forefinger in his direction, and pouted in the most dangerous fashion.  \"But he always seemed so nice,\" she reflected, with puckered brows, \"until to-day, you know. I thought he would be eminently suitable. I liked him tremendously until--\" and here, a wonderful, tender change came into her face, a wistful quaver woke in her voice--\"until I found there was some one else I liked better.\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10041"],["title","The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck: A Comedy of Limitations (#7)"],["body"," \"Ah!\" said Rudolph Musgrave.  So, that was it--yes, that was it! Her head was bowed now--her glorious, proud little head,--and she sat silent, an abashed heap of fluffy frills and ruffles, a tiny bundle of vaporous ruchings and filmy tucks and suchlike vanities, in the green dusk of the summer-house.  But he knew. He had seen her face grave and tender in the twilight, and he knew.  She loved some man--some lucky devil! Ah, yes, that was it! And he knew the love he had unwittingly spied upon to be august; the shamed exultance of her face and her illumined eyes, the crimson banners her cheeks had flaunted,--these were to Colonel Musgrave as a piece of sacred pageantry; and before it his misery was awed, his envy went posting to extinction.  Thus the stupid man reflected, and made himself very unhappy over it.  Then, after a little, the girl threw back her head and drew a deep breath, and flashed a tremulous smile at him.  \"Ah, yes,\" said she; \"there are better things in life than coronets, aren't there, Olaf?\"  You should have seen how he caught up the word!  \"Life!\" he cried, with a bitter thrill of speech; \"ah, what do I know of life? I am only a recluse, a dreamer, a visionary! You must learn of life from the men who have lived, Patricia. I haven't ever lived. I have always chosen the coward's part. I have chosen to shut myself off from the world, to posture in a village all my days, and to consider its trifles as of supreme importance. I have affected to scorn that brave world yonder where a man is proven. And, all the while, I was afraid of it, I think. I was afraid of you before you came.\"  At the thought of this Rudolph Musgrave laughed as he fell to pacing up and down before her.  \"Life!\" he cried, again, with a helpless gesture; and then smiled at her, very sadly. \"'Didn't I know there was something better in life than grubbing after musty tribes and customs and folk-songs?'\" he quoted. \"Why, what a question to ask of a professional genealogist! Don't you realize, Patricia, that the very bread I eat is, actually, earned by the achievements of people who have been dead for centuries? and in part, of course, by tickling the vanity of living snobs? That constitutes a nice trade for an able-bodied person as long as men are paid for emptying garbage-barrels--now, doesn't it? And yet it is not altogether for the pay's sake I do it,\" he added, haltingly. \"There really is a fascination about the work. You are really working out a puzzle,--like a fellow solving a chess-problem. It isn't really work, it is amusement. And when you are establishing a royal descent, and tracing back to czars and Plantagenets and Merovingians, and making it all seem perfectly plausible, the thing is sheer impudent, flagrant art, and _you_ are the artist--\" He broke off here and shrugged. \"No, I could hardly make you understand. It doesn't matter. It is enough that I have bartered youth and happiness and the very power of living for the privilege of grubbing in old county records.\"  He paused. It is debatable if he had spoken wisely, or had spoken even in consonance with fact, but his outburst had, at least, the saving grace of sincerity. He was pallid now, shaking in every limb, and in his heart was a dull aching. She seemed so incredibly soft and little and childlike, as she looked up at him with troubled eyes.  \"I--I don't quite understand,\" she murmured. \"It isn't as if you were an old man, Olaf. It isn't as if--\"  But he had scarcely heard her. \"Ah, child, child!\" he cried, \"why did you come to waken me? I was content in my smug vanities. I was content in my ignorance. I could have gone on contentedly grubbing through my musty, sleepy life here, till death had taken me, if only you had not shown me what life might mean! Ah, child, child, why did you waken me?\"  \"I?\" she breathed; and now the flush of her cheeks had widened, wondrously.  \"You! you!\" he cried, and gave a wringing motion of his hands, for the self-esteem of a complacent man is not torn away without agony. \"Who else but you? I had thought myself brave enough to be silent, but still I must play the coward's part! That woman I told you of--that woman I loved--was you! Yes, you, you!\" he cried, again and again, in a sort of frenzy.  And then, on a sudden, Colonel Musgrave began to laugh.  \"It is very ridiculous, isn't it?\" he demanded of her. \"Yes, it is very--very funny. Now comes the time to laugh at me! Now comes the time to lift your brows, and to make keen arrows of your eyes, and of your tongue a little red dagger! I have dreamed of this moment many and many a time. So laugh, I say! Laugh, for I have told you that I love you. You are rich, and I am a pauper--you are young, and I am old, remember,--and I love you, who love another man! For the love of God, laugh at me and have done--laugh! for, as God lives, it is the bravest jest I have ever known!\"  But she came to him, with a wonderful gesture of compassion, and caught his great, shapely hands in hers.  \"I--I knew you cared,\" she breathed. \"I have always known you cared. I would have been an idiot if I hadn't. But, oh, Olaf, I didn't know you cared so much. You frighten me, Olaf,\" she pleaded, and raised a tearful face to his. \"I am very fond of you, Olaf dear. Oh, don't think I am not fond of you.\" And the girl paused for a breathless moment. \"I think I might have married you, Olaf,\" she said, half-wistfully, \"if--if it hadn't been for one thing.\"  Rudolph Musgrave smiled now, though he found it a difficult business. \"Yes,\" he assented, gravely, \"I know, dear. If it were not for the other man--that lucky devil! Yes, he is a very, very lucky devil, child, and he constitutes rather a big 'if,' doesn't he?\"  Miss Stapylton, too, smiled a little. \"No,\" said she, \"that isn't quite the reason. The real reason is, as I told you yesterday, that I quite fail to see how you can expect any woman to marry you, you jay-bird, if you won't go to the trouble of asking her to do so.\"  And, this time, Miss Stapylton did not go into the house.     VII   When they went in to supper, they had planned to tell Miss Agatha of their earth-staggering secret at once. But the colonel comprehended, at the first glimpse of his sister, that the opportunity would be ill-chosen.  The meal was an awkward half-hour. Miss Agatha, from the head of the table, did very little talking, save occasionally to evince views of life that were both lachrymose and pugnacious. And the lovers talked with desperate cheerfulness, so that there might be no outbreak so long as Pilkins--preëminently ceremonious among butlers, and as yet inclined to scoff at the notion that the Musgraves of Matocton were not divinely entrusted to his guardianship,--was in the room.  Coming so close upon the heels of his high hour, this contretemps of Agatha's having one of her \"attacks,\" seemed more to Rudolph Musgrave than a man need rationally bear with equanimity. Perhaps it was a trifle stiffly that he said he did not care for any raspberries.  His sister burst into tears.  \"That's all the thanks I get. I slave my life out, and what thanks do I get for it? I never have any pleasure, I never put my foot out of the house except to go to market,--and what thanks do I get for it? That's what I want you to tell me with the first raspberries of the season. That's what I want! Oh, I don't wonder you can't look me in the eye. And I wish I was dead! that's what I wish!\"  Colonel Musgrave did not turn at once toward Patricia, when his sister had stumbled, weeping, from the dining-room.  \"I--I am so sorry, Olaf,\" said a remote and tiny voice.  Then he touched her hand with his finger-tips, ever so lightly. \"You must not worry about it, dear. I daresay I was unpardonably brusque. And Agatha's health is not good, so that she is a trifle irritable at times. Why, good Lord, we have these little set-to's ever so often, and never give them a thought afterwards. That is one of the many things the future Mrs. Musgrave will have to get accustomed to, eh? Or does that appalling prospect frighten you too much?\"  And Patricia brazenly confessed that it did not. She also made a face at him, and accused Rudolph Musgrave of trying to crawl out of marrying her, which proceeding led to frivolities unnecessary to record, but found delectable by the participants.     VIII   Colonel Musgrave was alone. He had lifted his emptied coffee-cup and he swished the lees gently to and fro. He was curiously intent upon these lees, considered them in the light of a symbol....  Then a comfortable, pleasant-faced mulattress came to clear the supper-table. Virginia they called her. Virginia had been nurse in turn to all the children of Rudolph Musgrave's parents; and to the end of her life she appeared to regard the emancipation of the South's negroes as an irrelevant vagary of certain \"low-down\" and probably \"ornery\" Yankees --as an, in short, quite eminently \"tacky\" proceeding which very certainly in no way affected her vested right to tyrannize over the Musgrave household.  \"Virginia,\" said Colonel Musgrave, \"don't forget to make up a fire in the kitchen-stove before you go to bed. And please fill the kettle before you go upstairs, and leave it on the stove. Miss Agatha is not well to-night.\"  \"Yaas, suh. I unnerstan', suh,\" Virginia said, sedately.  Virginia filled her tray, and went away quietly, her pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as an idol's.
