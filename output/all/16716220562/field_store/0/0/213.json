Take my advice for yourselves, dear readers, and for your children  after you; for, believe me, I am showing you the way to true and  useful, and, therefore, to just and deserved power.  I am showing you  the way to become members of what I trust will be--what I am certain  ought to be--the aristocracy of the future.  I say it deliberately, as a student of society and of history.  Power  will pass more and more, if all goes healthily and well, into the  hands of scientific men; into the hands of those who have made due  use of that great heirloom which the philosophers of the seventeenth  century left for the use of future generations, and specially of the  Teutonic race.  For the rest, events seem but too likely to repeat themselves again  and again all over the world, in the same hopeless circle.   Aristocracies of mere birth decay and die, and give place to  aristocracies of mere wealth; and they again to \"aristocracies of  genius,\" which are really aristocracies of the noisiest, of mere  scribblers and spouters, such as France is writhing under at this  moment.  And when these last have blown off their steam, with mighty  roar, but without moving the engine a single yard, then they are but  too likely to give place to the worst of all aristocracies, the  aristocracy of mere \"order,\" which means organised brute force and  military despotism.  And, after that, what can come, save anarchy,  and decay, and social death?  What else?--unless there be left in the nation, in the society, as  the salt of the land, to keep it all from rotting, a sufficient  number of wise men to form a true working aristocracy, an aristocracy  of sound and rational science?  If they be strong enough (and they  are growing stronger day by day over the civilised world), on them  will the future of that world mainly depend.  They will rule, and  they will act--cautiously we may hope, and modestly and charitably,  because in learning true knowledge they will have learnt also their  own ignorance, and the vastness, the complexity, the mystery of  nature.  But they will be able to rule, they will be able to act,  because they have taken the trouble to learn the facts and the laws  of nature.  They will rule; and their rule, if they are true to  themselves, will be one of health and wealth, and peace, of prudence  and of justice.  For they alone will be able to wield for the benefit  of man the brute forces of nature; because they alone will have  stooped, to \"conquer nature by obeying her.\"  So runs my dream.  I ask my young readers to help towards making that  dream a fact, by becoming (as many of them as feel the justice of my  words) honest and earnest students of Natural Science.  But now:  why should I, as a clergyman, interest myself specially in  the spread of Natural Science?  Am I not going out of my proper  sphere to meddle with secular matters?  Am I not, indeed, going into  a sphere out of which I had better keep myself, and all over whom I  may have influence?  For is not science antagonistic to religion?  and, if so, what has a clergyman to do, save to warn the young  against it, instead of attracting them towards it?  First, as to meddling with secular matters.  I grudge that epithet of  \"secular\" to any matter whatsoever.  But I do more; I deny it to  anything which God has made, even to the tiniest of insects, the most  insignificant atom of dust.  To those who believe in God, and try to  see all things in God, the most minute natural phenomenon cannot be  secular.  It must be divine; I say, deliberately, divine; and I can  use no less lofty word.  The grain of dust is a thought of God; God's  power made it; God's wisdom gave it whatsoever properties or  qualities it may possess; God's providence has put it in the place  where it is now, and has ordained that it should be in that place at  that moment, by a train of causes and effects which reaches back to  the very creation of the universe.  The grain of dust can no more go  from God's presence, or flee from God's Spirit, than you or I can.   If it go up to the physical heaven, and float (as it actually often  does) far above the clouds, in those higher strata of the atmosphere  which the aeronaut has never visited, whither the Alpine snow-peaks  do not rise, even there it will be obeying physical laws which we  term hastily laws of Nature, but which are really the laws of God:   and if it go down into the physical abyss; if it be buried fathoms,  miles, below the surface, and become an atom of some rock still in  the process of consolidation, has it escaped from God, even in the  bowels of the earth?  Is it not there still obeying physical laws, of  pressure, heat, crystallisation, and so forth, which are laws of God- -the will and mind of God concerning particles of matter?  Only look  at all created things in this light--look at them as what they are,  the expressions of God's mind and will concerning this universe in  which we live--\"the Word of God,\" as Bacon says, \"revealed in facts\"- -and then you will not fear physical science; for you will be sure  that, the more you know of physical science, the more you will know  of the works and of the will of God.  At least, you will be in  harmony with the teaching of the Psalmist:  \"The heavens,\" says he,  \"declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork.   There is neither speech nor language where their voices are not heard  among them.\"  So held the Psalmist concerning astronomy, the  knowledge of the heavenly bodies; and what he says of sun and stars  is true likewise of the flowers around our feet, of which the  greatest Christian poet of modern times has said--   To me the meanest flower that grows may give Thoughts that do lie too deep for tears.   So, again, you will be in harmony with the teaching of St. Paul, who  told the Romans \"that the invisible things of God are clearly seen  from the creation of the-world, being understood by the things that  are made, even His eternal power and Godhead;\" and who told the  savages of Lycaonia that \"God had not left Himself without witness,  in that He did good and sent men rain from heaven, and fruitful  seasons, filling men's hearts with food and gladness.\"  Rain and  fruitful seasons witnessed to all men of a Father in heaven.  And he  who wishes to know how truly St. Paul spoke, let him study the laws  which produce and regulate rain and fruitful seasons, what we now  call climatology, meteorology, geography of land and water.  Let him  read that truly noble Christian work, Maury's \"Physical Geography of  the Sea;\" and see, if he be a truly rational man, how advanced  science, instead of disproving, has only corroborated St. Paul's  assertion, and how the ocean and the rain-cloud, like the sun and  stars, declare the glory of God.  And if anyone undervalues the  sciences which teach us concerning stones and plants and animals, or  thinks that nothing can be learnt from them concerning God--allow one  who has been from childhood only a humble, though he trusts a  diligent student of these sciences--allow him, I say, to ask in all  reverence, but in all frankness, who it was who said, \"Consider the  lilies of the field, how they grow.\"  \"Consider the birds of the air- -and how your Heavenly Father feedeth them.\"  Consider them.  If He has bid you do so, can you do so too much?  I know, of course, the special application which our Lord made of  these words.  But I know, too, from experience, that the more you  study nature, in all her forms the more you will find that the  special application itself is deeper, wider, more literally true,  more wonderful, more tender, and if I dare use such a word, more  poetic, than the unscientific man can guess.  But let me ask you further--do you think that our Lord in that  instance, and in those many instances in which He drew his parables  and lessons from natural objects, was leading men's minds on to  dangerous ground, and pointing out to them a subject of contemplation  in the laws and processes of the natural world, and their analogy  with those of the spiritual world, the kingdom of God--a subject of  contemplation, I say, which it was not safe to contemplate too much?  I appeal to your common sense.  If He who spoke these words were (as  I believe) none other than the Creator of the universe, by whom all  things were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made, do  you suppose that He would have bid you to consider His universe, had  it been dangerous for you to do so?  Do you suppose, moreover, that the universe, which He, the Truth, the  Light, the Love, has made, can be otherwise then infinitely worthy to  be considered? or that the careful, accurate, and patient  consideration of it, even to its minutest details, can be otherwise  than useful to man, and can bear witness of aught, save the mind and  character of Him who made it?  And if so, can it be a work unfit for,  unworthy of, a clergyman--whose duty is to preach Him to all, and in  all ways,--to call on men to consider that physical world which, like  the spiritual world, consists, holds together, by Him, and lives and  moves and has its being in Him?  And here I must pause to answer an objection which I have heard in my  youth from many pious and virtuous people--better people in God's  sight, than I, I fear, can pretend to be.  They used to say, \"This would be all very true if there were not a  curse upon the earth.\"  And then they seemed to deduce, from the fact  of that curse, a vague notion (for it was little more) that this  world was the devil's world, and that therefore physical facts could  not be trusted, because they were disordered, and deceptive, and what  not.  Now, in justice to the Bible, and in justice to the Church of  England, I am bound to say that such a statement, or anything like  it, is contrary to the doctrines of both.  It is contrary to  Scripture.  According to it, the earth is not cursed.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],["title","Town Geology (#4)"],["body","it is said  in Gen. viii. 21, \"And the Lord said, I will not again curse the  ground any more for man's sake.  While the earth remaineth, seed-time  and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall  not cease.\"  According to Scripture, again, physical facts are not  disordered.  The Psalmist says, \"They continue this day according to  their ordinance; for all things serve Thee.\"  And again, \"Thou hast  made them fast for ever and ever.  Thou hast given them a law which  cannot be broken.\"  So does the Bible (not to quote over again the passages which I have  already given you from St. Paul, and One greater than St. Paul)  declare the permanence of natural laws, and the trustworthiness of  natural phenomena as obedient to God.  And so does the Church of  England.  For she has incorporated into her services that magnificent  hymn, which our forefathers called the Song of the Three Children;  which is, as it were, the very flower and crown of the Old Testament;  the summing up of all that is true and eternal in the old Jewish  faith; as true for us as for them:  as true millions of years hence  as it is now--which cries to all heaven and earth, from the skies  above our heads to the green herb beneath our feet, \"O all ye works  of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify Him for ever.\"   On that one hymn I take my stand.  That is my charter as a student of  Natural Science.  As long as that is sung in an English church, I  have a right to investigate Nature boldly without stint or stay, and  to call on all who have the will, to investigate her boldly likewise,  and with Socrates of old, to follow the Logos whithersoever it leads.  The Logos.  I must pause on that word.  It meant at first, no doubt,  simply speech, argument, reason.  In the mind of Socrates it had a  deeper meaning, at which he only dimly guessed; which was seen more  clearly by Philo and the Alexandrian Jews; which was revealed in all  its fulness to the beloved Apostle St. John, till he gathered speech  to tell men of a Logos, a Word, who was in the beginning with God,  and was God; by whom all things were made, and without Him was not  anything made that was made; and how in Him was Life, and the Life  was the light of men; and that He was none other than Jesus Christ  our Lord.  Yes, that is the truth.  And to that truth no man can add, and from  it no man can take away.  And as long as we believe that as long as  we believe that in His light alone can we see light--as long as we  believe that the light around us, whether physical or spiritual, is  given by Him without whom nothing is made--so long we shall not fear  to meet Light, so long we shall not fear to investigate Life; for we  shall know, however strange or novel, beautiful or awful, the  discoveries we make may be, we are only following the Word  whithersoever He may lead us; and that He can never lead us amiss    I. THE SOIL OF THE FIELD {2}    My dear readers, let me, before touching on the special subject of  this paper, say a few words on that of the whole series.  It is geology:  that is, the science which explains to us the RIND of  the earth; of what it is made; how it has been made.  It tells us  nothing of the mass of the earth.  That is, properly speaking, an  astronomical question.  If I may be allowed to liken this earth to a  fruit, then astronomy will tell us--when it knows--how the fruit  grew, and what is inside the fruit.  Geology can only tell us at most  how its rind, its outer covering, grew, and of what it is composed; a  very small part, doubtless, of all that is to be known about this  planet.  But as it happens, the mere rind of this earth-fruit which has,  countless ages since, dropped, as it were, from the Bosom of God, the  Eternal Fount of Life--the mere rind of this earth-fruit, I say, is  so beautiful and so complex, that it is well worth our awful and  reverent study.  It has been well said, indeed, that the history of  it, which we call geology, would be a magnificent epic poem, were  there only any human interest in it; did it deal with creatures more  like ourselves than stones, and bones, and the dead relics of plants  and beasts.  Whether there be no human interest in geology; whether  man did not exist on the earth during ages which have seen enormous  geological changes, is becoming more and more an open question.  But meanwhile all must agree that there is matter enough for  interest--nay, room enough for the free use of the imagination, in a  science which tells of the growth and decay of whole mountain-ranges,  continents, oceans, whole tribes and worlds of plants and animals.  And yet it is not so much for the vastness and grandeur of those  scenes of the distant past, to which the science of geology  introduces us, that I value it as a study, and wish earnestly to  awaken you to its beauty and importance.  It is because it is the  science from which you will learn most easily a sound scientific  habit of thought.  I say most easily; and for these reasons.  The  most important facts of geology do not require, to discover them, any  knowledge of mathematics or of chemical analysis; they may be studied  in every bank, every grot, every quarry, every railway-cutting, by  anyone who has eyes and common sense, and who chooses to copy the  late illustrious Hugh Miller, who made himself a great geologist out  of a poor stonemason.  Next, its most important theories are not, or  need not be, wrapped up in obscure Latin and Greek terms.  They may  be expressed in the simplest English, because they are discovered by  simple common sense.  And thus geology is (or ought to be), in  popular parlance, the people's science--the science by studying  which, the man ignorant of Latin, Greek, mathematics, scientific  chemistry, can yet become--as far as his brain enables him--a truly  scientific man.  But how shall we learn science by mere common sense?  First.  Always try to explain the unknown by the known.  If you meet  something which you have not seen before, then think of the thing  most like it which you have seen before; and try if that which you  know explains the one will not explain the other also.  Sometimes it  will; sometimes it will not.  But if it will, no one has a right to  ask you to try any other explanation.  Suppose, for instance, that you found a dead bird on the top of a  cathedral tower, and were asked how you thought it had got there.   You would say, \"Of course, it died up here.\"  But if a friend said,  \"Not so; it dropped from a balloon, or from the clouds;\" and told you  the prettiest tale of how the bird came to so strange an end, you  would answer, \"No, no; I must reason from what I know.  I know that  birds haunt the cathedral tower; I know that birds die; and  therefore, let your story be as pretty as it may, my common sense  bids me take the simplest explanation, and say--it died here.\"  In  saying that, you would be talking scientifically.  You would have  made a fair and sufficient induction (as it is called) from the facts  about birds' habits and birds' deaths which you know.  But suppose that when you took the bird up you found that it was  neither a jackdaw, nor a sparrow nor a swallow, as you expected, but  a humming-bird.  Then you would be adrift again.  The fact of it  being a humming-bird would be a new fact which you had not taken into  account, and for which your old explanation was not sufficient; and  you would have to try a new induction--to use your common sense  afresh--saying, \"I have not to explain merely how a dead bird got  here, but how a dead humming-bird.\"  And now, if your imaginative friend chimed in triumphantly with:  \"Do  you not see that I was right after all?  Do you not see that it fell  from the clouds? that it was swept away hither, all the way from  South America, by some south-westerly storm, and wearied out at last,  dropped here to find rest, as in a sacred-place?\" what would you  answer?  \"My friend, that is a beautiful imagination; but I must  treat it only as such, as long as I can explain the mystery more  simply by facts which I do know.  I do not know that humming-birds  can be blown across the Atlantic alive.  I do know they are actually  brought across the Atlantic dead; are stuck in ladies' hats.  I know  that ladies visit the cathedral; and odd as the accident is, I prefer  to believe, till I get a better explanation, that the humming-bird  has simply dropped out of a lady's hat.\"  There, again, you would be  speaking common sense; and using, too, sound inductive method; trying  to explain what you do not know from what you do know already.  Now, I ask of you to employ the same common sense when you read and  think of Geology.  It is very necessary to do so.  For in past times men have tried to  explain the making of the world around them, its oceans, rivers,  mountains, and continents, by I know not what of fancied cataclysms  and convulsions of nature; explaining the unknown by the still more  unknown, till some of their geological theories were no more  rational, because no more founded on known facts, than that of the  New Zealand Maories, who hold that some god, when fishing, fished up  their islands out of the bottom of the ocean.  But a sounder and  wiser school of geologists now reigns; the father of whom, in England  at least, is the venerable Sir Charles Lyell.  He was almost the  first of Englishmen who taught us to see--what common sense tells us- -that the laws which we see at work around us now have been most  probably at work since the creation of the world; and that whatever  changes may seem to have taken place in past ages, and in ancient  rocks, should be explained, if possible, by the changes which are  taking place now in the most recent deposits--in the soil of the  field.  And in the last forty years--since that great and sound idea has  become rooted in the minds of students, and especially of English  students, geology"]]]
