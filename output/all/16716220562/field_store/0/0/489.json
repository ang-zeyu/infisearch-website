Would he have risked his own life to have saved Tarzan could he have known of the danger which confronted his friend? You will doubt it.  Anyone at all familiar with elephants will doubt it.  Englishmen who have hunted much with elephants in India will tell you that they never have heard of an instance in which one of these animals has gone to the aid of a man in danger, even though the man had often befriended it.  And so it is to be doubted that Tantor would have attempted to overcome his instinctive fear of the black men in an effort to succor Tarzan.  The screams of the infuriated villagers came faintly to his sensitive ears, and he wheeled, as though in terror, contemplating flight; but something stayed him, and again he turned about, raised his trunk, and gave voice to a shrill cry.  Then he stood listening.  In the distant village where Mbonga had restored quiet and order, the voice of Tantor was scarcely audible to the blacks, but to the keen ears of Tarzan of the Apes it bore its message.  His captors were leading him to a hut where he might be confined and guarded against the coming of the nocturnal orgy that would mark his torture-laden death.  He halted as he heard the notes of Tantor's call, and raising his head, gave vent to a terrifying scream that sent cold chills through the superstitious blacks and caused the warriors who guarded him to leap back even though their prisoner's arms were securely bound behind him.  With raised spears they encircled him as for a moment longer he stood listening.  Faintly from the distance came another, an answering cry, and Tarzan of the Apes, satisfied, turned and quietly pursued his way toward the hut where he was to be imprisoned.  The afternoon wore on.  From the surrounding village the ape-man heard the bustle of preparation for the feast.  Through the doorway of the hut he saw the women laying the cooking fires and filling their earthen caldrons with water; but above it all his ears were bent across the jungle in eager listening for the coming of Tantor.  Even Tarzan but half believed that he would come.  He knew Tantor even better than Tantor knew himself.  He knew the timid heart which lay in the giant body.  He knew the panic of terror which the scent of the Gomangani inspired within that savage breast, and as night drew on, hope died within his heart and in the stoic calm of the wild beast which he was, he resigned himself to meet the fate which awaited him.  All afternoon he had been working, working, working with the bonds that held his wrists.  Very slowly they were giving.  He might free his hands before they came to lead him out to be butchered, and if he did--Tarzan licked his lips in anticipation, and smiled a cold, grim smile.  He could imagine the feel of soft flesh beneath his fingers and the sinking of his white teeth into the throats of his foemen.  He would let them taste his wrath before they overpowered him!  At last they came--painted, befeathered warriors--even more hideous than nature had intended them.  They came and pushed him into the open, where his appearance was greeted by wild shouts from the assembled villagers.  To the stake they led him, and as they pushed him roughly against it preparatory to binding him there securely for the dance of death that would presently encircle him, Tarzan tensed his mighty thews and with a single, powerful wrench parted the loosened thongs which had secured his hands.  Like thought, for quickness, he leaped forward among the warriors nearest him.  A blow sent one to earth, as, growling and snarling, the beast-man leaped upon the breast of another.  His fangs were buried instantly in the jugular of his adversary and then a half hundred black men had leaped upon him and borne him to earth.  Striking, clawing, and snapping, the ape-man fought--fought as his foster people had taught him to fight--fought like a wild beast cornered.  His strength, his agility, his courage, and his intelligence rendered him easily a match for half a dozen black men in a hand-to-hand struggle, but not even Tarzan of the Apes could hope to successfully cope with half a hundred.  Slowly they were overpowering him, though a score of them bled from ugly wounds, and two lay very still beneath the trampling feet, and the rolling bodies of the contestants.  Overpower him they might, but could they keep him overpowered while they bound him? A half hour of desperate endeavor convinced them that they could not, and so Mbonga, who, like all good rulers, had circled in the safety of the background, called to one to work his way in and spear the victim.  Gradually, through the milling, battling men, the warrior approached the object of his quest.  He stood with poised spear above his head waiting for the instant that would expose a vulnerable part of the ape-man's body and still not endanger one of the blacks.  Closer and closer he edged about, following the movements of the twisting, scuffling combatants.  The growls of the ape-man sent cold chills up the warrior's spine, causing him to go carefully lest he miss at the first cast and lay himself open to an attack from those merciless teeth and mighty hands.  At last he found an opening.  Higher he raised his spear, tensing his muscles, rolling beneath his glistening, ebon hide, and then from the jungle just beyond the palisade came a thunderous crashing.  The spear-hand paused, the black cast a quick glance in the direction of the disturbance, as did the others of the blacks who were not occupied with the subjugation of the ape-man.  In the glare of the fires they saw a huge bulk topping the barrier. They saw the palisade belly and sway inward.  They saw it burst as though built of straws, and an instant later Tantor, the elephant, thundered down upon them.  To right and left the blacks fled, screaming in terror.  Some who hovered upon the verge of the strife with Tarzan heard and made good their escape, but a half dozen there were so wrapt in the blood-madness of battle that they failed to note the approach of the giant tusker.  Upon these Tantor charged, trumpeting furiously.  Above them he stopped, his sensitive trunk weaving among them, and there, at the bottom, he found Tarzan, bloody, but still battling.  A warrior turned his eyes upward from the melee.  Above him towered the gigantic bulk of the pachyderm, the little eyes flashing with the reflected light of the fires--wicked, frightful, terrifying.  The warrior screamed, and as he screamed, the sinuous trunk encircled him, lifted him high above the ground, and hurled him far after the fleeing crowd.  Another and another Tantor wrenched from the body of the ape-man, throwing them to right and to left, where they lay either moaning or very quiet, as death came slowly or at once.  At a distance Mbonga rallied his warriors.  His greedy eyes had noted the great ivory tusks of the bull.  The first panic of terror relieved, he urged his men forward to attack with their heavy elephant spears; but as they came, Tantor swung Tarzan to his broad head, and, wheeling, lumbered off into the jungle through the great rent he had made in the palisade.  Elephant hunters may be right when they aver that this animal would not have rendered such service to a man, but to Tantor, Tarzan was not a man--he was but a fellow jungle beast.  And so it was that Tantor, the elephant, discharged an obligation to Tarzan of the Apes, cementing even more closely the friendship that had existed between them since Tarzan as a little, brown boy rode upon Tantor's huge back through the moonlit jungle beneath the equatorial stars.                                3                  The Fight for the Balu  TEEKA HAD BECOME a mother.  Tarzan of the Apes was intensely interested, much more so, in fact, than Taug, the father.  Tarzan was very fond of Teeka.  Even the cares of prospective motherhood had not entirely quenched the fires of carefree youth, and Teeka had remained a good-natured playmate even at an age when other shes of the tribe of Kerchak had assumed the sullen dignity of maturity.  She yet retained her childish delight in the primitive games of tag and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan's fertile man-mind had evolved.  To play tag through the tree tops is an exciting and inspiring pastime. Tarzan delighted in it, but the bulls of his childhood had long since abandoned such childish practices.  Teeka, though, had been keen for it always until shortly before the baby came; but with the advent of her first-born, even Teeka changed.  The evidence of the change surprised and hurt Tarzan immeasurably.  One morning he saw Teeka squatted upon a low branch hugging something very close to her hairy breast--a wee something which squirmed and wriggled. Tarzan approached filled with the curiosity which is common to all creatures endowed with brains which have progressed beyond the microscopic stage.  Teeka rolled her eyes in his direction and strained the squirming mite still closer to her.  Tarzan came nearer.  Teeka drew away and bared her fangs.  Tarzan was nonplussed.  In all his experiences with Teeka, never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today she did not look playful.  Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his thick, black hair, cocked his head upon one side, and stared.  Then he edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing which Teeka cuddled.  Again Teeka drew back her upper lip in a warning snarl.  Tarzan reached forth a hand, cautiously, to touch the thing which Teeka held, and Teeka, with a hideous growl, turned suddenly upon him.  Her teeth sank into the flesh of his forearm before the ape-man could snatch it away, and she pursued him for a short distance as he retreated incontinently through the trees; but Teeka, carrying her baby, could not overtake him.  At a safe distance Tarzan stopped and turned to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],["title","Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#7)"],["body","his erstwhile play-fellow in unconcealed astonishment.  What had happened to so alter the gentle Teeka? She had so covered the thing in her arms that Tarzan had not yet been able to recognize it for what it was; but now, as she turned from the pursuit of him, he saw it.  Through his pain and chagrin he smiled, for Tarzan had seen young ape mothers before.  In a few days she would be less suspicious.  Still Tarzan was hurt; it was not right that Teeka, of all others, should fear him. Why, not for the world would he harm her, or her balu, which is the ape word for baby.  And now, above the pain of his injured arm and the hurt to his pride, rose a still stronger desire to come close and inspect the new-born son of Taug.  Possibly you will wonder that Tarzan of the Apes, mighty fighter that he was, should have fled before the irritable attack of a she, or that he should hesitate to return for the satisfaction of his curiosity when with ease he might have vanquished the weakened mother of the new-born cub; but you need not wonder.  Were you an ape, you would know that only a bull in the throes of madness will turn upon a female other than to gently chastise her, with the occasional exception of the individual whom we find exemplified among our own kind, and who delights in beating up his better half because she happens to be smaller and weaker than he.  Tarzan again came toward the young mother--warily and with his line of retreat safely open.  Again Teeka growled ferociously.  Tarzan expostulated.  \"Tarzan of the Apes will not harm Teeka's balu,\" he said.  \"Let me see it.\"  \"Go away!\" commanded Teeka.  \"Go away, or I will kill you.\"  \"Let me see it,\" urged Tarzan.  \"Go away,\" reiterated the she-ape. \"Here comes Taug.  He will make you go away.  Taug will kill you.  This is Taug's balu.\"  A savage growl close behind him apprised Tarzan of the nearness of Taug, and the fact that the bull had heard the warnings and threats of his mate and was coming to her succor.  Now Taug, as well as Teeka, had been Tarzan's play-fellow while the bull was still young enough to wish to play.  Once Tarzan had saved Taug's life; but the memory of an ape is not overlong, nor would gratitude rise above the parental instinct.  Tarzan and Taug had once measured strength, and Tarzan had been victorious.  That fact Taug could be depended upon still to remember; but even so, he might readily face another defeat for his first-born--if he chanced to be in the proper mood.  From his hideous growls, which now rose in strength and volume, he seemed to be in quite the mood.  Now Tarzan felt no fear of Taug, nor did the unwritten law of the jungle demand that he should flee from battle with any male, unless he cared to from purely personal reasons. But Tarzan liked Taug.  He had no grudge against him, and his man-mind told him what the mind of an ape would never have deduced--that Taug's attitude in no sense indicated hatred.  It was but the instinctive urge of the male to protect its offspring and its mate.  Tarzan had no desire to battle with Taug, nor did the blood of his English ancestors relish the thought of flight, yet when the bull charged, Tarzan leaped nimbly to one side, and thus encouraged, Taug wheeled and rushed again madly to the attack.  Perhaps the memory of a past defeat at Tarzan's hands goaded him.  Perhaps the fact that Teeka sat there watching him aroused a desire to vanquish the ape-man before her eyes, for in the breast of every jungle male lurks a vast egotism which finds expression in the performance of deeds of derring-do before an audience of the opposite sex.  At the ape-man's side swung his long grass rope--the play-thing of yesterday, the weapon of today--and as Taug charged the second time, Tarzan slipped the coils over his head and deftly shook out the sliding noose as he again nimbly eluded the ungainly beast.  Before the ape could turn again, Tarzan had fled far aloft among the branches of the upper terrace.  Taug, now wrought to a frenzy of real rage, followed him.  Teeka peered upward at them.  It was difficult to say whether she was interested. Taug could not climb as rapidly as Tarzan, so the latter reached the high levels to which the heavy ape dared not follow before the former overtook him.  There he halted and looked down upon his pursuer, making faces at him and calling him such choice names as occurred to the fertile man-brain. Then, when he had worked Taug to such a pitch of foaming rage that the great bull fairly danced upon the bending limb beneath him, Tarzan's hand shot suddenly outward, a widening noose dropped swiftly through the air, there was a quick jerk as it settled about Taug, falling to his knees, a jerk that tightened it securely about the hairy legs of the anthropoid.  Taug, slow of wit, realized too late the intention of his tormentor. He scrambled to escape, but the ape-man gave the rope a tremendous jerk that pulled Taug from his perch, and a moment later, growling hideously, the ape hung head downward thirty feet above the ground.  Tarzan secured the rope to a stout limb and descended to a point close to Taug.  \"Taug,\" he said, \"you are as stupid as Buto, the rhinoceros.  Now you may hang here until you get a little sense in your thick head.  You may hang here and watch while I go and talk with Teeka.\"  Taug blustered and threatened, but Tarzan only grinned at him as he dropped lightly to the lower levels.  Here he again approached Teeka only to be again greeted with bared fangs and menacing growls.  He sought to placate her; he urged his friendly intentions, and craned his neck to have a look at Teeka's balu; but the she-ape was not to be persuaded that he meant other than harm to her little one.  Her motherhood was still so new that reason was yet subservient to instinct.  Realizing the futility of attempting to catch and chastise Tarzan, Teeka sought to escape him.  She dropped to the ground and lumbered across the little clearing about which the apes of the tribe were disposed in rest or in the search of food, and presently Tarzan abandoned his attempts to persuade her to permit a close examination of the balu.  The ape-man would have liked to handle the tiny thing.  The very sight of it awakened in his breast a strange yearning.  He wished to cuddle and fondle the grotesque little ape-thing. It was Teeka's balu and Tarzan had once lavished his young affections upon Teeka.  But now his attention was diverted by the voice of Taug.  The threats that had filled the ape's mouth had turned to pleas.  The tightening noose was stopping the circulation of the blood in his legs--he was beginning to suffer.  Several apes sat near him highly interested in his predicament.  They made uncomplimentary remarks about him, for each of them had felt the weight of Taug's mighty hands and the strength of his great jaws.  They were enjoying revenge.  Teeka, seeing that Tarzan had turned back toward the trees, had halted in the center of the clearing, and there she sat hugging her balu and casting suspicious glances here and there.  With the coming of the balu, Teeka's care-free world had suddenly become peopled with innumerable enemies.  She saw an implacable foe in Tarzan, always heretofore her best friend.  Even poor old Mumga, half blind and almost entirely toothless, searching patiently for grubworms beneath a fallen log, represented to her a malignant spirit thirsting for the blood of little balus.  And while Teeka guarded suspiciously against harm, where there was no harm, she failed to note two baleful, yellow-green eyes staring fixedly at her from behind a clump of bushes at the opposite side of the clearing.  Hollow from hunger, Sheeta, the panther, glared greedily at the tempting meat so close at hand, but the sight of the great bulls beyond gave him pause.  Ah, if the she-ape with her balu would but come just a trifle nearer! A quick spring and he would be upon them and away again with his meat before the bulls could prevent.  The tip of his tawny tail moved in spasmodic little jerks; his lower jaw hung low, exposing a red tongue and yellow fangs.  But all this Teeka did not see, nor did any other of the apes who were feeding or resting about her.  Nor did Tarzan or the apes in the trees.  Hearing the abuse which the bulls were pouring upon the helpless Taug, Tarzan clambered quickly among them.  One was edging closer and leaning far out in an effort to reach the dangling ape.  He had worked himself into quite a fury through recollection of the last occasion upon which Taug had mauled him, and now he was bent upon revenge.  Once he had grasped the swinging ape, he would quickly have drawn him within reach of his jaws.  Tarzan saw and was wroth.  He loved a fair fight, but the thing which this ape contemplated revolted him.  Already a hairy hand had clutched the helpless Taug when, with an angry growl of protest, Tarzan leaped to the branch at the attacking ape's side, and with a single mighty cuff, swept him from his perch.  Surprised and enraged, the bull clutched madly for support as he toppled sidewise, and then with an agile movement succeeded in projecting himself toward another limb a few feet below.  Here he found a hand-hold, quickly righted himself, and as quickly clambered upward to be revenged upon Tarzan, but the ape-man was otherwise engaged and did not wish to be interrupted.  He was explaining again to Taug the depths of the latter's abysmal ignorance, and pointing out how much greater and mightier was Tarzan of the Apes than Taug or any other ape.  In the end he would release Taug, but not until Taug was fully acquainted with his own inferiority.  And then the maddened bull came from beneath, and instantly Tarzan was transformed from a good-natured, teasing youth into a snarling, savage beast.  Along his scalp the hair bristled: his upper lip drew back that his fighting fangs might be uncovered and ready.  He did not wait for the bull to reach him, for something in the"]]]
