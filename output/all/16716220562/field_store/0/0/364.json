The most important portion of the document was that entitled \"_Suggested Draft of Articles for Discussion_. December 20, 1918.\" It reads as follows:     \"The parties to this convention, for the purpose of maintaining    international peace and preventing future wars between one another,    hereby constitute themselves into a League of Nations and solemnly    undertake jointly and severally to fulfill the obligations imposed    upon them in the following articles:     \"A     \"Each power signatory or adherent hereto severally covenants and    guarantees that it will not violate the territorial integrity or    impair the political independence of any other power signatory or    adherent to this convention except when authorized so to do by a    decree of the arbitral tribunal hereinafter referred to or by a    three-fourths vote of the International Council of the League of    Nations created by this convention.     \"B     \"In the event that any power signatory or adherent hereto shall fail    to observe the covenant and guaranty set forth in the preceding    article, such breach of covenant and guaranty shall _ipso facto_    operate as an abrogation of this convention in so far as it applies    to the offending power and furthermore as an abrogation of all    treaties, conventions, and agreements heretofore or hereafter entered    into between the offending power and all other powers signatory and    adherent to this convention.     \"C     \"A breach of the covenant and guaranty declared in Article A shall    constitute an act unfriendly to all other powers signatory and    adherent hereto, and they shall forthwith sever all diplomatic,    consular, and official relations with the offending power, and shall,    through the International Council, hereinafter provided for, exchange    views as to the measures necessary to restore the power, whose    sovereignty has been invaded, to the rights and liberties which it    possessed prior to such invasion and to prevent further    violation thereof.     \"D     \"Any interference with a vessel on the high seas or with aircraft    proceeding over the high seas, which interference is not    affirmatively sanctioned by the law of nations shall be, for the    purposes of this convention, considered an impairment of political    independence.\"  In considering the foregoing series of articles constituting a guaranty against one's own acts, instead of a guaranty against the acts of another, it must be remembered that, at the time of their preparation, I had not seen a draft of the President's proposed guaranty, though from conversations with Colonel House and from my study of Point XIV of \"The Fourteen Points,\" I knew that it was affirmative rather than negative in form and would require positive action to be effective in the event that the menace of superior force was insufficient to prevent aggressive acts.  As far as I am able to judge from subsequently acquired knowledge, President Wilson at the time he received my letter of December 23 had a typewritten draft of the document which after certain amendments he later laid before the American Commissioners and which he had printed with a few verbal changes under the title of \"The Covenant.\" In order to understand the two forms of guaranty which he had for consideration after he received my letter, I quote the article relating to it, which appears in the first printed draft of the Covenant.     III     \"The Contracting Powers unite in guaranteeing to each other political    independence and territorial integrity; but it is understood between    them that such territorial readjustments, if any, as may in the    future become necessary by reasons of changes in present racial    conditions and aspirations or present social and political    relationships, pursuant to the principle of self-determination, and    also such territorial readjustments as may in the judgment of three    fourths of the Delegates be demanded by the welfare and manifest    interest of the people concerned, may be effected if agreeable to    those peoples; and that territorial changes may involve material    compensation. The Contracting Powers accept without reservation the    principle that the peace of the world is superior in importance to    every question of political jurisdiction or boundary.\"  It seems needless to comment upon the involved language and the uncertainty of meaning of this article wherein it provided for \"territorial readjustments\" of which there appeared to be two classes, one dependent on \"self-determination,\" the other on the judgment of the Body of Delegates of the League. In view of the possible reasons which might be advanced for changes in territory and allegiance, justification for an appeal to the guarantors was by no means certain. If this article had been before me when the letter of December 23 was written, I might have gone much further in opposition to the President's plan for stabilizing peace in the world on the ground that a guaranty so conditioned would cause rather than prevent international discord.  Though without knowledge of the exact terms of the President's proposed guaranty, I did not feel for the reason stated that I could delay longer in submitting my views to the President. There was not time to work out a complete and well-digested plan for a League, but I had prepared in the rough several articles for discussion which related to the organization, and which might be incorporated in the organic agreement which I then assumed would be a separate document from the treaty restoring peace. While unwilling to lay these articles before the President until they were more carefully drafted, I enclosed in my letter the following as indicative of the character of the organization which it seemed to me would form a simple and practical agency common to all nations:     \"_Suggestions as to an International Council For Discussion_     \"_December_ 21, 1918     \"An International Council of the League of Nations is hereby    constituted, which shall be the channel for communication between the    members of the League, and the agent for common action.     \"The International Council shall consist of the diplomatic    representative of each party signatory or adherent to this    convention at ----.     \"Meetings of the International Council shall be held at ----, or in    the event that the subject to be considered involves the interests of    ---- or its nationals, then at such other place outside the territory    of a power whose interests are involved as the Supervisory Committee    of the Council shall designate.     \"The officer charged with the conduct of the foreign affairs of the    power where a meeting is held shall be the presiding officer thereof.     \"At the first meeting of the International Council a Supervisory    Committee shall be chosen by a majority vote of the members present,    which shall consist of five members and shall remain in office for    two years or until their successors are elected.     \"The Supervisory Committee shall name a Secretariat which shall have    charge of the archives of the Council and receive all communications    addressed to the Council or Committee and send all communications    issued by the Council or Committee.     \"The Supervisory Committee may draft such rules of procedure as it    deems necessary for conducting business coming before the Council or    before the Committee.     \"The Supervisory Committee may call a meeting of the Council at its    discretion and must call a meeting at the request of any member of    the Council provided the request contains a written statement of the    subject to be discussed.     \"The archives of the Council shall be open at any time to any member    of the Council, who may make and retain copies thereof.     \"All expenses of the Supervisory Committee and Secretariat shall be    borne equally by all powers signatory or adherent to this    convention.\"  As indicated by the caption, this document was intended merely \"for discussion\" of the principal features of the organization. It should be noted that the basic principle is the equality of nations. No special privileges are granted to the major powers in the conduct of the organization. The rights and obligations of one member of the League are no more and no less than those of every other member. It is based on international democracy and denies international aristocracy.  Equality in the exercise of sovereign rights in times of peace, an equality which is imposed by the very nature of sovereignty, seemed to me fundamental to a world organization affecting in any way a nation's independence of action or its exercise of supreme authority over its external or domestic affairs. In my judgment any departure from that principle would be a serious error fraught with danger to the general peace of the world and to the recognized law of nations, since it could mean nothing less than the primacy of the Great Powers and the acknowledgment that because they possessed the physical might they had a right to control the affairs of the world in times of peace as well as in times of war. For the United States to admit that such primacy ought to be formed would be bad enough, but to suggest it indirectly by proposing an international organization based on that idea would be far worse.  On January 22, 1917, the President in an address to the Senate had made the following declaration:     \"The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded if it is to    last must be an equality of rights; the guarantees exchanged must    neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations or    small, between those that are powerful and those that are weak. Right    must be based upon the common strength, not the individual strength,    of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend.

Of this I have ever been so firmly persuaded, that I inscribed a former work[2] to that person who was the best judge of its truth. I need not tell you I mean General Paoli; who, after his great, though unsuccessful, efforts to preserve the liberties of his country, has found an honourable asylum in Britain, where he has now lived many years the object of Royal regard and private respect[3]; and whom I cannot name without expressing my very grateful sense of the uniform kindness which he has been pleased to shew me[4].  The friends of Doctor Johnson can best judge, from internal evidence, whether the numerous conversations which form the most valuable part of the ensuing pages are correctly related. To them, therefore, I wish to appeal, for the accuracy of the portrait here exhibited to the world.  As one of those who were intimately acquainted with him, you have a title to this address. You have obligingly taken the trouble to peruse the original manuscript of this Tour, and can vouch for the strict fidelity of the present publication[5]. Your literary alliance with our much lamented friend, in consequence of having undertaken to render one of his labours more complete, by your edition of _Shakspeare_[6], a work which I am confident will not disappoint the expectations of the publick, gives you another claim. But I have a still more powerful inducement to prefix your name to this volume, as it gives me an opportunity of letting the world know that I enjoy the honour and happiness of your friendship; and of thus publickly testifying the sincere regard with which I am,    My dear Sir,       Your very faithful           And obedient servant,               JAMES BOSWELL.    LONDON, 20th September, 1785.     ADVERTISEMENT  TO THE  _THIRD EDITION._  Animated by the very favourable reception which two large impressions of this work have had[7], it has been my study to make it as perfect as I could in this edition, by correcting some inaccuracies which I discovered myself, and some which the kindness of friends or the scrutiny of adversaries pointed out. A few notes are added, of which the principal object is, to refute misrepresentation and calumny.  To the animadversions in the periodical Journals of criticism, and in the numerous publications to which my book has given rise, I have made no answer. Every work must stand or fall by its own merit. I cannot, however, omit this opportunity of returning thanks to a gentleman who published a Defence of my Journal, and has added to the favour by communicating his name to me in a very obliging letter.  It would be an idle waste of time to take any particular notice of the futile remarks, to many of which, a petty national resentment, unworthy of my countrymen, has probably given rise; remarks which have been industriously circulated in the publick prints by shallow or envious cavillers, who have endeavoured to persuade the world that Dr. Johnson's character has been _lessened_ by recording such various instances of his lively wit and acute judgment, on every topick that was presented to his mind. In the opinion of every person of taste and knowledge that I have conversed with, it has been greatly _heightened_; and I will venture to predict, that this specimen of the colloquial talents and extemporaneous effusions of my illustrious fellow-traveller will become still more valuable, when, by the lapse of time, he shall have become an _ancient_; when all those who can now bear testimony to the transcendent powers of his mind, shall have passed away; and no other memorial of this great and good man shall remain but the following Journal, the other anecdotes and letters preserved by his friends, and those incomparable works, which have for many years been in the highest estimation, and will be read and admired as long as the English language shall be spoken or understood.
