But Toady held on manfully, though his arms were nearly pulled off, for \"Never say die,\" was his motto, and the plucky little lad wouldn't show fear before the women.  \"Don't howl; we'll do it! Hi, Bob!\" and with a savage slash of the whip, an exciting cry, a terrible reeling and rattling, they _did_ do it; for Bob cleared the track at a breakneck pace, just in time for the train to sweep swiftly by behind them.  Aunt Kipp dropped in a heap, Polly looked up at her brother, with a look which he never forgot; and Toady tried to say, stoutly, \"It's all right!\" with lips that were white and dry in spite of himself.  \"We shall smash up at the bridge,\" he muttered, as they tore through the town, where every one obligingly shouted, waved their hats, and danced about on the sidewalks, doing nothing but add to Bob's fright and the party's danger. But Toady was wrong,--they did not smash up at the bridge; for, before they reached the perilous spot, one man had the sense to fly straight at the horse's head and hold on till the momentary check enabled others to lend a hand.  The instant they were safe, Polly, like a regular heroine, threw herself into the arms of her dishevelled preserver, who of course was Van, and would have refreshed herself with hysterics if the sight of Toady hadn't steadied her. The boy sat as stiff and rigid as a wooden figure till they took the reins from him; then all the strength seemed to go out of him, and he leaned against his sister, as white and trembling as she, whispering with an irrepressible sob,--  \"O Polly, wasn't it horrid? Tell mother I stood by you like a man. Do tell her that!\"  If any one had had time or heart to laugh, they certainly would have done it when, after much groping, heaving, and hoisting. Mrs. Kipp was extricated and restored to consciousness; for a more ludicrously deplorable spectacle was seldom seen. Quite unhurt, though much shaken, the old lady insisted on believing herself to be dying, and kept the town in a ferment till three doctors had pronounced her perfectly well able to go home. Then the perversity of her nature induced her to comply, that she might have the satisfaction of dying on the way, and proving herself in the right.  Unfortunately she did not expire, but, having safely arrived, went to bed in high dudgeon, and led Polly and her mother a sad life of it for two weary days. Having heard of Toady's gallant behavior, she solemnly ordered him up to receive her blessing. But the sight of Aunt Kipp's rubicund visage, surrounded by the stiff frills of an immense nightcap, caused the irreverent boy to explode with laughter in his handkerchief, and to be hustled away by his mother before Aunt Kipp discovered the true cause of his convulsed appearance.  \"Ah! poor dear, his feelings are too much for him. He sees my doom in my face, and is overcome by what you refuse to believe. I shan't forget that boy's devotion. Now leave me to the meditations befitting these solemn hours.\"  Mrs. Snow retired, and Aunt Kipp tried to sleep; but the murmur of voices, and the sound of stifled laughter in the next room disturbed her repose.  \"They are rejoicing over my approaching end, knowing that I haven't changed my will. Mercenary creatures, don't exult too soon! there's time yet,\" she muttered; and presently, unable to control her curiosity, she crept out of bed to listen and peep through the keyhole.  Van Bahr Lamb did look rather like a sheep. He had a blond curly head, a long face, pale, mild eyes, a plaintive voice, and a general expression of innocent timidity strongly suggestive of animated mutton. But Baa-baa was a \"trump,\" as Toady emphatically declared, and though every one laughed at him, every one liked him, and that is more than can be said of many saints and sages. He adored Polly, was dutifully kind to her mother, and had stood by T. Snow, Jr., in many an hour of tribulation with fraternal fidelity. Though he had long blushed, sighed, and cast sheep's eyes at the idol of his affections, only till lately had he dared to bleat forth his passion. Polly loved him because she couldn't help it; but she was proud, and wouldn't marry till Aunt Kipp's money was hers, or at least a sure prospect of it; and now even the prospect of a prospect was destroyed by that irrepressible Toady. They were talking of this as the old lady suspected, and of course the following conversation afforded her intense satisfaction.  \"It's a shame to torment us as she does, knowing how poor we are and how happy a little of her money would make us. I'm tired of being a slave to a cruel old woman just because she's rich. If it was not for mother, I declare I'd wash my hands of her entirely, and do the best I could for myself.\"  \"Hooray for Polly! I always said let her money go and be jolly without it,\" cried Toady, who, in his character of wounded hero, reposed with a lordly air on the sofa, enjoying the fragrance of the opodeldoc with which his strained wrists were bandaged.  \"It's on your account, children, that I bear with aunt's temper as I do. I don't want anything for myself, but I really think she owes it to your dear father, who was devoted to her while he lived, to provide for his children when he couldn't;\" after which remarkably spirited speech for her, Mrs. Snow dropped a tear, and stitched away on a small trouser-leg which was suffering from a complicated compound fracture.  \"Don't you worry about me, mother; I'll take care of myself and you too,\" remarked Toady, with the cheery belief in impossibilities which makes youth so charming.  \"Now, Van, tell us what to do, for things have come to such a pass that we must either break away altogether or be galley-slaves as long as Aunt Kipp lives,\" said Polly, who was a good deal excited about the matter.  \"Well, really, my dear, I don't know,\" hesitated Van, who did know what _he_ wanted, but thought it might be selfish to urge it. \"Have you tried to soften your aunt's heart?\" he asked, after a moment's meditation.  \"Good gracious, Van, she hasn't got any,\" cried Polly, who firmly believed it.  \"It's hossified,\" thoughtfully remarked Toady, quite unconscious of any approach to a joke till every one giggled.  \"You've had hossification enough for one while, my lad,\" laughed Van. \"Well, Polly, if the old lady has no heart you'd better let her go, for people without hearts are not worth much.\"  \"That's a beautiful remark, Van, and a wise one. I just wish she could hear you make it, for she called you a fool,\" said Polly, irefully.  \"Did she? Well, I don't mind, I'm used to it,\" returned Van, placidly; and so he was, for Polly called him a goose every day of her life, and he enjoyed it immensely.  \"Then you think, dear, if we stopped worrying about aunt and her money, and worked instead of waiting, that we shouldn't be any poorer and might be a great deal happier than we are now?\" asked Polly, making a pretty little tableau as she put her hand through Van's arm and looked up at him with as much love, respect, and reliance as if he had been six feet tall, with the face of an Apollo and the manners of a Chesterfield.  \"Yes, my dear, I do, for it has troubled me a good deal to see you so badgered by that very uncomfortable old lady. Independence is a very nice thing, and poverty isn't half as bad as this sort of slavery. But you are not going to be poor, nor worry about anything. We'll just be married and take mother and Toady home and be as jolly as grigs, and never think of Mrs. K. again,--unless she loses her fortune, or gets sick, or comes to grief in any way. We'd lend her a hand then, wouldn't we, Polly?\" and Van's mild face was pleasant to behold as he made the kindly proposition.  \"Well, we'd think of it,\" said Polly, trying not to relent, but feeling that she was going very fast.  \"Let's do it!\" cried Toady, fired with the thought of privy conspiracy and rebellion. \"Mother would be so comfortable with Polly, and I'd help Van in the store, when I've learned that confounded multiplication table,\" he added with a groan; \"and if Aunt Kipp comes a visiting, we'll just say 'Not at home,' and let her trot off again.\"  \"It sounds very nice, but aunt will be dreadfully offended and I don't wish to be ungrateful,\" said Mrs. Snow, brightening visibly.  \"There's no ingratitude about it,\" cried Van. \"She might have done everything to make you love, and respect, and admire her, and been a happy, useful, motherly, old soul; but she didn't choose to, and now she must take the consequences. No one cares for her, because she cares for nobody; her money's the plague of her life, and not a single heart will ache when she dies.\"  \"Poor Aunt Kipp!\" said Polly, softly.  Mrs. Snow echoed the words, and for a moment all thought pitifully of the woman whose life had given so little happiness, whose age had won so little reverence, and whose death would cause so little regret. Even Toady had a kind thought for her, as he broke the silence, saying soberly,--  \"You'd better put tails on my jackets, mother; then the next time we get run away with, Aunt Kipp will have something to hold on by.\"  It was impossible to help laughing at the recollection of the old lady clutching at the boy till he had hardly a button left, and at the paternal air with which he now proposed a much-desired change of costume, as if intent on Aunt Kipp's future accommodation.  Under cover of the laugh, the old lady stole back to bed, wide awake, and with subjects enough to meditate upon now. The shaking up had certainly done her good, for somehow the few virtues she possessed came to the surface, and the mental shower-bath just received had produced a salutary change. Polly wouldn't have doubted her aunt's possession of a heart, if she could have known the pain and loneliness that made it ache,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10360"],["title","Kitty's Class Day and Other Stories (#6)"],["body"," the old woman crept away; and Toady wouldn't have laughed if he had seen the tears on the face, between the big frills, as Aunt Kipp laid it on the pillow, muttering, drearily,--  \"I might have been a happy, useful woman, but I didn't choose to, and now it's too late.\"  It _was_ too late to be all she might have been, for the work of seventy selfish years couldn't be undone in a minute. But with regret, rose the sincere wish to earn a little love before the end came, and the old perversity gave a relish to the reformation, for even while she resolved to do the just and generous thing, she said to herself,--  \"They say I've got no heart; I'll show 'em that I have: they don't want my money; I'll _make_ 'em take it: they turn their backs on me; I'll just render myself so useful and agreeable that they can't do without me.\"   III   Aunt Kipp sat bolt upright in the parlor, hemming a small handkerchief, adorned with a red ship, surrounded by a border of green monkeys. Toady suspected that this elegant article of dress was intended for him, and yearned to possess it; so, taking advantage of his mother's and Polly's absence, he strolled into the room, and, seating himself on a high, hard chair, folded his hands, crossed his legs, and asked for a story with the thirsting-for-knowledge air which little boys wear in the moral story-books.  Now Aunt Kipp had one soft place in her heart, though it _was_ partially ossified, as she very truly declared, and Toady was enshrined therein. She thought there never was such a child, and loved him as she had done his father before him, though the rack wouldn't have forced her to confess it. She scolded, snubbed, and predicted he'd come to a bad end in public; but she forgave his naughtiest pranks, always brought him something when she came, and privately intended to make his future comfortable with half of her fortune. There was a dash and daring, a generosity and integrity, about the little fellow, that charmed her. Sophy was weak and low-spirited, Polly pretty and headstrong, and Aunt Kipp didn't think much of either of them; but Toady defied, distracted, and delighted her, and to Toady she clung, as the one sunshiny thing in her sour, selfish old age.  When he made his demure request, she looked at him, and her eyes began to twinkle, for the child's purpose was plainly seen in the loving glances cast upon the pictorial pocket-handkerchief.  \"A story? Yes, I'll tell you one about a little boy who had a kind old--ahem!--grandma. She was rich, and hadn't made up her mind who she'd leave her money to. She was fond of the boy,--a deal fonder than he deserved,--for he was as mischievous a monkey as any that ever lived in a tree, with a curly tail. He put pepper in her snuff-box,\"--here Toady turned scarlett,--\"he cut up her bestt frisette to make a mane for his rocking-horse,\"--Toady opened his mouth impulsively, but shut it again without betraying himself--\"he repeated rude things to her, and called her 'an old aggrewater,'\"--here Toady wriggled in his chair, and gave a little gasp.  \"If you are tired I won't go on,\" observed Aunt Kipp, mildly.  \"I'm not tired, 'm; it's a very interesting story,\" replied Toady, with a gravity that nearly upset the old lady.  \"Well, in spite of all this, that kind, good, forgiving grandma left that bad boy twenty thousand dollars when she died. What do you think of that?\" asked Aunt Kipp, pausing suddenly with her sharp eye on him.  \"I--I think she was a regular dear,\" cried Toady, holding on to the chair with both hands, as if that climax rather took him off his legs.  \"And what did the boy do about it?\" continued Aunt Kipp, curiously.  \"He bought a velocipede, and gave his sister half, and paid his mother's rent, and put a splendid marble cherakin over the old lady, and had a jolly good time, and--\"  \"What in the world is a cherakin?\" laughed Aunt Kipp, as Toady paused for breath.  \"Why, don't you know? It's a angel crying, or pointing up, or flapping his wings. They have them over graves; and I'll give you the biggest one I can find when you die. But I'm not in a _very_ great hurry to have you.\"  \"Thankee, dear; I'm in no hurry, myself. But, Toady, the boy did wrong in giving his sister half; she didn't deserve _any_; and the grandma left word she wasn't to have a penny of it.\"  \"Really?\" cried the boy, with a troubled face.  \"Yes, really. If he gave her any he lost it all; the old lady said so. Now what do you think?\" asked Aunt Kipp, who found it impossible to pardon Polly,--perhaps because she was young, and pretty, and much beloved.  Toady's eyes kindled, and his red cheeks grew redder still, as he cried out defiantly,--  \"I think she was a selfish pig,--don't you?\"  \"No, I don't, sir; and I'm sure that little boy wasn't such a fool as to lose the money. He minded his grandma's wishes, and kept it all.\"  \"No, he didn't,\" roared Toady, tumbling off his chair in great excitement. \"He just threw it out a winder, and smashed the old cherakin all to bits.\"  Aunt Kipp dropped her work with a shrill squeak, for she thought the boy was dangerous, as he stood before her, sparring away at nothing as the only vent for his indignation.  \"It isn't an interesting story,\" he cried; \"and I won't hear any more; and I won't have your money if I mayn't go halves with Polly; and I'll work to earn more than that, and we'll all be jolly together, and you may give your twenty thousand to the old rag-bags, and so I tell you, Aunt Kipp.\"  \"Why, Toady, my boy, what's the matter?\" cried a mild voice at the door, as young Lamb came trotting up to the rescue.  \"Never you mind, Baa-baa; I shan't do it; and it's a mean shame Polly can't have half; then she could marry you and be so happy,\" blubbered Toady, running to try to hide his tears of disappointment in the coat-skirts of his friend.  \"Mr. Lamb, I suppose you _are_ that misguided young man?\" said Aunt Kipp, as if it was a personal insult to herself.  \"Van Bahr Lamb, ma'am, if you please. Yes, thank you,\" murmured Baa-Baa, bowing, blushing, and rumpling his curly fleece in bashful trepidation.  \"Don't thank me,\" cried the old lady. \"I'm not going to give you anything,--far from it. I object to you altogether. What business have you to come courting my niece?\"  \"Because I love her, ma'am,\" returned Van, with unexpected spirit.  \"No, you don't; you want her money, or rather my money. She depends on it; but you'll both be disappointed, for she won't have a penny of it,\" cried Aunt Kipp, who, in spite of her good resolutions, found it impossible to be amiable all at once.  \"I'm glad of it!\" burst out Van, indignant at her accusation. \"I didn't want Polly for the money; I always doubted if she got it; and I never wished her to make herself a slave to anybody. I've got enough for all, if we're careful; and when my share of the Van Bahr property comes, we shall live in clover.\"  \"What's that? What property are you talking of?\" demanded Aunt Kipp, pricking up her ears.  \"The great Van Bahr estate, ma'am. There has been a long lawsuit about it, but it's nearly settled, and there isn't much doubt that we shall get it. I am the last of our branch, and my share will be a large one.\"  \"Oh, indeed! I wish you joy,\" said Aunt Kipp, with sudden affability; for she adored wealth, like a few other persons in the world. \"But suppose you don't get it, how then?\"  \"Then I shall try to be contented with my salary of two thousand, and make Polly as happy as I can. Money doesn't _always_ make people happy or agreeable, I find.\" And Van looked at Aunt Kipp in a way that would have made her hair stand erect if she had possessed any. She stared at him a moment, then, obeying one of the odd whims that made an irascible weathercock of her, she said, abruptly,--  \"If you had capital should you go into business for yourself, Mr. Lambkin?\"  \"Yes, ma'am, at once,\" replied Van, promptly.  \"Suppose you lost the Van Bahr money, and some one offered you a tidy little sum to start with, would you take it?\"  \"It would depend upon who made the offer, ma'am,\" said Van, looking more like a sheep than ever, as he stood staring in blank surprise.  \"Suppose it was me, wouldn't you take it?\" asked Aunt Kipp, blandly, for the new fancy pleased her.  \"No, thank you, ma'am,\" said Van, decidedly.  \"And why not, pray?\" cried the old lady, with a shrillness that made him jump, and Toady back to the door precipitately.  \"Because, if you'll excuse my speaking plainly, I think you owe anything you may have to spare to your niece, Mrs. Snow;\" and, having freed his mind, Van joined Toady, ready to fly if necessary.  \"You're an idiot, sir,\" began Aunt Kipp, in a rage again.  \"Thank you, ma'am.\" And Van actually laughed and bowed in return for the compliment.  \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" snapped the old lady. \"You're a fool and Sophy is another. She's no strength of mind, no sense about anything; and would make ducks and drakes of my money in less than no time if I gave it to her, as I've thought of doing.\"  \"Mrs. Kipp, you forget who you are speaking to. Mrs. Snow's sons love and respect her if you don't, and they won't hear anything untrue or unkind said of a good woman, a devoted mother, and an almost friendless widow.\"  Van wasn't a dignified man at all, but as he said that with a sudden flash of his mild eyes, there was something in his face and manner that daunted Aunt Kipp more than the small fist belligerently shaken at her from behind the sofa. The poor old soul was cross, and worried, and ashamed of herself, and being as feeble-minded as Sophy in many respects, she suddenly burst into tears, and, covering her face with the gay handkerchief, cried as if bent on floating the red ship in a sea of salt water without delay.  \"I'm a poor, lonely, abused old woman,\" she moaned, with a green monkey at each eye. \"No one loves me, or minds me, or thanks me when I want to help 'em. My money's only a worryment and a burden, and I don't know what to do with it, for people I don't"]]]
