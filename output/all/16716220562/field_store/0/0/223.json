I had opportunities in the South to pick up bits of fine old mahogany, and I have a number of really good pieces that will help to make Boxley Hall attractive.\"  \"What are they, papa? Tell me all about them. I can't wait another minute!\"  \"To begin with, child, I have several heirlooms; the old sideboard that was your grandfather Fairfield's, and several old bureaus and tables that came from the Fairfield estate. Then I have, also, two or three beautiful book-cases, and an old desk for our library; and to-day we will hunt up some sort of a big roomy table that will do to go with them.\"  \"Let's make the library the nicest room in the house, papa.\"  \"It will make itself that, if you give it half a chance, though we'll do all we can to help. But I'm so prosaic I would like to have special attention paid to the comforts of the dining-room; and as to your own bedroom, Patty, I want you to see to it that it fulfills exactly your ideal of what a girl's room ought to be.\"  \"Oh, I know just how I want that; almost exactly like my room at Aunt Alice's, but with a few more of the sort of things I had in my room at Aunt Isabel's. I do like pretty things, papa.\"  \"That's right, my child, I'm glad you do; and I think your idea of pretty things is not merely a taste for highfalutin gimcracks.\"  \"No, I don't think it is,\" said Patty slowly; \"but, all the same, you'd better keep pretty close to me when I pick out the traps for my room. Do you know, papa, I think Aunt Isabel wants to help us furnish our house. She wrote that she would meet us in New York some time.\"  \"That's kind of her,\" said Mr. Fairfield; \"but, do _you_ know, it just seems to me that we'll be able to manage it by ourselves. Our house is not of the era of Queen Isabella, but of the Princess Patricia.\"  \"That sounds like Aunt Isabel. They always called me Patricia there. Don't you think, papa, now that I'm getting so grown up, I ought to be called Patricia? Patty is such a baby name.\"  \"Patty is good enough for me,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"If you want to be called Patricia, you must get somebody else to do it. I dare say you could hire somebody for a small sum per week to call you Patricia for a given number of times every day.\"  \"Now, you're making fun of me, papa; but I do want to grow up dignified, and not be a silly schoolgirl all my life.\"  \"Take care of your common sense, and your dignity will take care of itself.\"  After they crossed the ferry, and reached the New York side, Mr. Fairfield took a cab, and they made a round of the various shops, buying such beautiful things that Patty grew fairly ecstatic with delight.  \"I do think you're wonderful, papa,\" she exclaimed, after they had selected the dining-room furnishings. \"You know exactly what you want, and when you describe it, it seems to be the only possible thing that anybody could want for that particular place.\"  \"That is a result of decision of character, my child. It is a Fairfield trait, and I hope you possess it; though I cannot say I have seen any marked development of it, as yet. But you must have noticed it in your Aunt Alice.\"  \"Yes, I have,\" said Patty; \"she is so decided that, with all her sweetness, I have sometimes been tempted to call her stubborn.\"  \"Stubbornness and decision of character are very closely allied; but now, we're going to select the furniture for your own bedroom, and if you have any decision of character, you will have ample opportunity to exercise it.\"  \"Oh, I'll have plenty of decision of character when it comes to that,\" said Patty; \"you will find me a true Fairfield.\"  Aided by her father's judgment and advice, Patty selected the furnishings for her own room. She had chosen green as the predominant colour, and the couch and easy-chairs were upholstered in a lovely design of green and white. The rug was green and white, and for the brass bedstead with its white fittings, a down comfortable with a pale green cover was found. The dainty dressing-table was of bird's-eye maple; and for this Mr. Fairfield ordered a bewildering array of fittings, all in ivory, with Patty's monogram on them.  \"And I want a little book-case, papa,\" she said; \"a little one, you know, just for my favouritest books; for, of course, the most of my books will be down in the library.\"  So a dear little book-case was bought, also of bird's-eye maple, and a pretty little work-table, with a low chair to match.  \"That's very nice,\" said Patty, with an air of satisfaction, \"for, though I hate to sew, yet sometimes it must be done; and with that little work-table, I think I could sew even in an Indian wigwam!\"  Patty hadn't much to say regarding the furniture of her father's bedroom, for Mr. Fairfield attended to that himself, and selected the things with such rapidity and certainty that it was all done almost before Patty knew it.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"there are two guest-chambers to be furnished; the one you call Marian's room, and the other for the general stranger within our gates.\"  Marian's room was done up in blue, as she had requested, and the other guest-room was furnished in yellow.  It was great fun to pick out the furniture, rugs, and curtains for these rooms; and Patty tried very hard to select such things as her father would approve of, for she dearly loved to have him commend her taste and judgment.  As they were sitting at luncheon, Mr. Fairfield said: \"This afternoon, I think, we will devote to pictures. I'm not sure we will buy any, but we will look at them, and I will learn what is your taste in art, and you will leant what is mine.\"  \"I haven't any,\" said Patty cheerfully. \"I don't know anything about art and never did.\"  \"You still have some time, I hope, in which to learn.\"  \"I've time enough, but I don't believe I could learn. The only pictures I like are pretty ones.\"  \"You _are_ hopeless, and that's a fact,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"Of all discouraging people, the worst are those who like pretty pictures!\"  \"But I'm sure I can learn,\" said Patty, \"if you will teach me.\"  \"You are more flattering than convincing,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"but I will try.\"  And so after luncheon they visited several picture shops, and Mr. Fairfield imported to his daughter what was at least a foundation for an education in art.  Back in Vernondale, Patty confided to Marian that she had had a perfectly lovely time all the morning, but the afternoon wasn't so much fun. \"In fact,\" she said, \"it was very much like that little book we had to study in school called 'How to Judge a Picture.'\"  The following Saturday another shopping tour was undertaken. This time Aunt Alice and Marian accompanied the Fairfields, and there was more fun and less responsibility for Patty.  Her father insisted upon her undivided attention while Mrs. Elliott selected table-linen, bed-linen, towels, and other household fittings; but, as these things were chosen with Fairfield promptness and decision, Patty had nothing to do but admire and acquiesce.  \"And now,\" she remarked, after they had chosen two sets of china and a quantity of glass for the dining-room; \"now, if you please, we will buy me some tea-things to entertain the Tea Club.\"  \"We will, indeed,\" said Mr. Fairfield, and both he and Aunt Alice entered into the selection of the tea-table fittings with as much zest as they had shown in the other china.  Dainty Dresden cups were found, lovely plates, and a tea-pot, and cracker-jar, which made Marian and Patty fairly shriek with delight.  A three-storied wicker tea-table was found, to hold these treasures, and Mr. Fairfield added the most fascinating little silver tea-caddy and tea-ball and strainer.  \"Oh,\" exclaimed Marian, made quite breathless by the glory of it all, \"the Tea Club will never want to meet anywhere except at your house, Patty.\"  \"They'll have to,\" said Patty. \"I don't propose to have them every time.\"  \"Well, you'll have to have them every other time, anyway,\" said Marian.  After the fun of picking out the tea-things, it was hard to come down to the plainer claims of the kitchen, but Aunt Alice grew so interested in the selection of granite saucepans and patent coffee-mills that Patty, too, became enthusiastic.  \"And we must get a rolling-pin,\" she cried, \"for I shall make pumpkin pies every day. Oh, and I want a farina-kettle and a colander, and a _bain-marie,_ and a larding-needle, and a syllabub-churn.\"  \"Why, Patty, child!\" exclaimed her father; \"what are all those things for? Are you going to have a French _chef_?\"  \"No, papa, but I expect to do a great deal of fancy cooking myself.\"  \"Oh, you do! Well, then, buy all the contraptions that are necessary, but don't omit the plain gridirons and frying-pans.\"  Then Aunt Alice and Patty put their heads together in a most sensible fashion, and ordered a kitchen outfit that would have delighted the heart of any well-organised housekeeper. Not only kitchen utensils, but laundry fittings, and household furnishings generally; including patent labour-saving devices, and newly invented contrivances which were supposed to be of great aid to any housewife.  \"If I can only live up to it all,\" sighed Patty, as she looked at the enormous collection of iron, tin, wood, and granite.  \"Or down to it,\" said Marian.     CHAPTER VI  SERVANTS   \"I did think,\" said Patty, in a disgusted tone, \"that we could get settled in the house in time to eat our Christmas dinner there, but it doesn't look a bit like it. I was over there this afternoon, and such a hopeless-looking mess of papering and painting and plumbing I never saw in my life. I don't believe it will _ever_ be done!\"  \"I don't either,\" said Marian; \"those men work as slow as mud-turtles.\"  The conversation"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10268"],["title","Patty at Home (#6)"],["body","taking place at the Elliotts' dinner-table, and Uncle Charley looked up from his carving to say:  \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good, and the slower the mud-turtles are, the longer we shall have our guests with us. For my part, I shall be very sorry to see pretty Patty go out of this house.\"  Patty smiled gaily at her uncle, for they were great friends, and said:  \"Then I shall expect you to visit me very often in my new home,--that is, if I ever get there.\"  \"I can't see our way clear to a Christmas dinner in Boxley Hall,\" said Mr. Fairfield; \"but I think I can promise you, chick, that you can invite your revered uncle and his family to dine with you there on New Year's day.\"  There were general exclamations of delight at this from all except Patty, who looked a little bewildered.  \"What's the matter, Patsie?\" said her uncle. \"Don't you want to entertain your admiring relatives?\"  \"Yes,\" said Patty, \"of course I do; but it scares me to death to think of it! How can I have a dinner party, when I don't know anything about anything?\"  \"Aunt Alice will tell you something about something,\" said her father; \"and I'll tell you the rest about the rest.\"  \"Oh, I know it will be all right,\" said Patty, quickly regaining confidence, as she looked at her father. \"If papa says the house will be ready, I know it will be, and if he says we'll have a dinner party on New Year's day, I know we will; and so I now invite you all, and I expect you all to accept; and I hope Aunt Alice will come early.\"  \"I shall come the night before,\" said Marian, \"so as to be sure to be there in time.\"  \"I'm not sure that any of us will be there the night before,\" said Mr. Fairfield, laughing. \"I've guaranteed the house for the dinner, but I didn't say we would be living there at the time.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" said Aunt Alice; \"let Patty entertain her first company there, and then come back here for the reaction.\"  \"Well, we'll see,\" said Patty; \"but I'd like to go there the first day of January, and stay there.\"  By some unknown methods, Mr. Fairfield managed to stir up the mud-turtle workmen to greater activity, and the work went rapidly on. The wall-papers seemed to get themselves into place, and the floors took on a beautiful polish; bustling men came out from the city and put up window-shades, and curtains, and draperies; and, under Mr. Fairfield's supervision, laid rugs and hung pictures.  The ladies of the Elliott household organised themselves into a most active sewing-society.  Grandma, Aunt Alice, Marian, and Patty hemmed tablecloths and napkins with great diligence, and even little Edith was allowed to help with the kitchen towels.  Everybody was so kind that Patty began to feel weighed down with gratitude. The girls of the Tea Club made the tea-cloth that they had proposed, and they also brought offerings of pin-cushions, and doilies and centre-pieces, until Patty's room began to look like a booth at a fancy bazaar.  One Saturday morning, as the sewing-circle was hard at work, little Gilbert came in carrying a paper bag, which evidently contained something valuable.  \"It's for you, Patty,\" he said. \"I brought it for you, to help keep house; and its name is Pudgy.\"  Depositing the bag in his cousin's lap, little Gilbert knelt beside her. \"You needn't open it,\" he cried; \"it will open itself!\"  And, sure enough, the mouth of the bag untwisted, and a little grey head came poking out.  \"A kitten!\" exclaimed Patty; \"a Maltese kitten. Why, that's just the very thing I wanted! Where did you get it, Gilbert, dear?\"  \"From the milkman,\" said Gilbert proudly. \"We always get kitties from him, and I telled him to pick out a nice pretty one for you. Do you like it?\"  \"I love it,\" said Patty, cuddling the little bunch of grey fur; \"and Pudgy is just the right name for it. It's the fattest little cat I ever saw.\"  \"Yes,\" said Gilbert gravely; \"don't let it get thin, will you?\"  \"No, indeed,\" said Patty; \"I'll feed it on strawberries and cream all the year round!\"  That same afternoon Patty and Aunt Alice started out on a cook-hunting expedition. A Cook's Tour, Frank called it; and the tourists took it very seriously.  \"Much of the success of your home, Patty,\" said Aunt Alice, as they were going to the Intelligence Office, \"depends upon your cook; for she will be not only a cook, but, in part, housekeeper, and overseer of the whole place. And while you must, of course, exercise your authority and demand respect, yet at the same time you will find it necessary to defer to her judgment and experience on many occasions.\"  \"I know it, Aunt Alice,\" said Patty very earnestly; \"and I do want to do what is right. I want to be the head of papa's home, and yet there are a great many things that my servants will know more about than I do. I shall have to be very careful about my proportion; but if you and papa will help me, I think I'll come out all right.\"  \"I think you will,\" said Aunt Alice, but she smiled a little at the assured toss of her niece's head.  The Intelligence Office proved to be as much misnamed as those institutions usually are, and varying degrees of unintelligence were shown in the candidates offered for the position of cook at Boxley Hall; though, if the applicants seemed unsatisfactory to Patty, in many cases she was no less so to them.  One tall, rawboned Irishwoman seemed hopefully good-tempered and capable, but when she discovered that Patty was to be her mistress, instead of Mrs. Elliott, as she had supposed, she exclaimed:  \"Go 'way wid yez! Wud I be workin' for the likes of a child like that? No, mum, I ain't no nurse; I'm a cook, and I want a mistress as has got past playing wid dolls.\"  \"I hope you'll find one,\" said Patty politely; \"and I'm afraid we wouldn't suit each other.\"  Another Irish girl, with a merry rosy face and frizzled blonde hair, was very anxious to go to work for Patty.  \"Sure, it will be fun!\" she said. \"I'd like to work for such a pretty little lady; and, sure, we'd have the good times. Could I have all me afternoons out, miss?\"  \"Not if you lived with me,\" said Patty, laughing. \"My house is large, and there's a great deal of work to be done by somebody. I think my cook couldn't do her share if she went out every afternoon.\"  Many others were interviewed, but each seemed to have more or less objectionable traits. One would not come unless she were the only servant; another would not come unless Patty kept five. Most of them showed such a decided lack of respect to so young a mistress that Aunt Alice began to despair of finding the kind, capable woman she had imagined. They went home feeling rather discouraged, but when Patty told her troubles to her father, he only laughed.  \"Bless your heart, child,\" he said; \"you couldn't expect to engage a whole cook in one afternoon! It's a long and serious process.\"  \"But, papa, you said we'd be all settled and ready by the first of January.\"  \"Yes, I know, but I didn't say which January.\"  \"Now, you're teasing,\" said Patty; but she ran away with a light heart, feeling sure that somehow a cook would be provided.  That evening, according to appointment, Pansy Potts appeared for inspection. The whole Elliott family was present, and observed with much interest the strange-looking girl.  But, though ignorant and awkward, Pansy was not embarrassed, and, seeming to realise that her fate lay in the hands of Mrs. Elliott, Mr. Fairfield, and Patty, she addressed herself to them.  Her manner, though untrained, showed respectful deference, and her expressive black eyes showed quick perception and clever adaptability.  \"She is all right at heart,\" thought Mr. Fairfield to himself, \"but she knows next to nothing. I wonder if it would be a good plan to let the two girls help each other out.\"  \"Have you ever waited at table, Pansy?\" he asked, so pleasantly that Pansy Potts felt encouragement rather than alarm.  \"No, sir; but I could learn, and I would do exactly as I was told.\"  \"That's the right spirit,\" said Mr. Fairfield \"I think perhaps we'll have to give you a trial.\"  \"But don't you know anything of a housemaid's duties?\" inquired Aunt Alice, who was a little dubious in the face of such absolute ignorance. \"For instance, if the door-bell should ring, what would you do?\"  \"I would have asked Miss Patty beforehand, ma'am, and I would do whatever she had told me to.\"  \"Good enough!\" exclaimed Mr. Fairfield. \"I think you'll do, Pansy; at any rate, you'll have nothing to unlearn, and that's a great deal.\"  So the waitress was engaged, and it was not long after this that a cook \"dropped from the skies,\" as Patty expressed it.  One afternoon a large and amiable-looking coloured woman appeared at Mrs. Elliott's house, with a note from Mrs. Stevens recommending her as a cook for Patty. As soon as Patty saw her she liked her, but, remembering previous experiences, she said:  \"Do you understand that you are to work for me? I'm a very young housekeeper, you know.\"  \"Laws, missy, dat's all right. Til do de housekeepin' and you can do de bossin'. I reckon we'll get along mos' beautiful.\"  \"That sounds attractive, I'm sure,\" said Patty, laughing. \"What is your name?\"  \"Emancipation Proclamation Jackson,\" announced the owner of the name proudly.  \"That's a big name,\" said Patty; \"I couldn't call you all that at once.\"  \"Co'se I shouldn't expect it. Mancy, mos' folks calls me, and dat's good enough for me; but I likes my name, my whole name, and it does look beautiful, wrote.\"  \"I should think it might,\" said Aunt Alice. \"Can you cook, Mancy?\"  \"Oh, yas'm, I kin cook everything what there is to cook, and I can make things besides. Oh, they won't be no trouble about my cookin'. I know dat much!\"  \"Are you a good laundress?\" asked Aunt Alice.  \"Yas'm, I am! Ef I do say it dat shouldn't, you jes' ought to see de clothes I sends up! Dey's jes' like druvven snow. Oh, dey won't be no trouble about de laundry work!\"  \"And can you sweep?\" said Patty.  \"Can I sweep? Law, chile, co'se I kin"]]]
