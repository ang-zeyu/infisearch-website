And those who aid are punished as severely as the principals themselves.  It was a tense, fearsome instant, for midshipmen have been dismissed from the Naval Academy for this very offense.  The passage was not brilliantly lighted.  The on-coming officer, a lieutenant, junior grade, was looking at the floor as he came along.  Suddenly he paused, seemed lost in thought, then wheeled and walked back whence he had come.  Dan breathed more easily. Dave heaved a sigh of relief.  As for Pennington, that midshipman had wheeled and was stealing rapidly down the passageway, intent only on escape.  \"That was the closest squeak we'll ever have without being ragged cold,\" murmured Dalzell tremulously.  \"Where is Pennington?\" demanded Dave, wheeling about after he had watched the Naval lieutenant out of sight.  \"Ducked out of sight, like a submarine,\" chuckled Dan.  At that moment the call for midshipmen's dinner formation sounded. Dave and Dan were ready.  Pennington showed up just after the line had started to march into the midshipmen's mess tables.  To the inquiry of the officer in charge, Pen lamely explained that he had bumped his nose into something hard in a poorly lighted passageway.  Though the officer accepted the excuse, he smiled within himself.  \"It wasn't iron or steel that bumped that young man's nose,\" thought the officer.  \"Oh, the middies haven't changed a lot since I boned at Annapolis!\"  Pennington's nose was no very lovely member of his face at that moment. It had been struck hard, mashed rather flat, and now looked like a red bulb.  \"Meet with an accident, Pen?\" asked Hallam curiously at table.  \"Quit your kidding, please,\" requested Pennington sulkily.  That directed the curious glances of other middies at Pennington's new bulbous nose.  The young man was so brusque about it, however, that other table mates ceased quizzing him.  Yet, as soon as the meal was over, many a youngster asked others of his class for news regarding Pen. But none possessed it.  During the brief rest that followed the meal, however, Midshipman Pennington made it his business to try to meet Dave Darrin alone. He succeeded, finding Dave staring off across the water at the port rail.  \"Of course, Mr. Darrin,\" began the other midshipman, in a voice suggestive of ice, \"you are aware that the incident of an hour ago cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed.\"  \"I don't believe there's any danger of that,\" retorted Darrin, with an ironical glance at Pennington's damaged-looking nose.  \"Confound you, sir,\" hissed the other midshipman, \"don't you dare to be insolent with me.\"  \"Why, I had thought,\" observed Dave, \"that, of your own choice, the period of courtesies between us had passed.\"  \"I shall call you out, Mr. Darrin!\"  \"You'll find my hearing excellent,\" smiled Dave. \"I shall make but one stipulation.\"  \"I'll do you the favor of asking what that stipulation is,\" sneered Pennington.  \"Why, after the narrow escape we had from being caught and reported, an hour or so ago, I shall ask that the fight be held where we are not so likely to be caught at it. I don't care about being dropped from the Naval Academy, nor do I believe you do.\"  \"It would be a good thing for the service, if one of us were to be dropped,\" sneered Pennington.  \"Yes! Oh, well, you can easily procure writing materials from the captain's clerk,\" volunteered Dave generously. \"On a cruise, I believe, a resignation is sent direct to the commandant of midshipmen.\"  This ridicule served only to fan the flame of Pennington's wrath.  \"Darrin,\" he hissed, \"the Academy isn't big enough to hold us both!\"  \"But I've already told you how to get out,\" protested Dave coolly.  \"I don't intend to get out!\"  \"No more do I,\" rejoined Dave. \"I won't even toss pennies with you to find out who quits the service.\"  \"Mr. Darrin, you are merely seeking to divert my mind from what I have said.\"  \"What did you say--particularly?\"  \"That you would have to fight me.\"  \"I have already signified my entire willingness, Mr. Pennington. To that I really can add nothing.\"  Fourth classmen are always addressed as \"mister,\" and they must use the same \"handle to the name\" when addressing upper classmen. But members of the three upper classes resort to the use of \"mister,\" in addressing classmates, only when they wish to be offensive or nearly so.  \"I will send a friend to meet you,\" Pennington continued.  \"Why, I thought,\" bantered Darrin ironically, \"that you were going to fight me yourself.\"  \"So I am--be sure of it. I will amend my statement by saying that I will send a second to see you.\"  \"Save time by sending him to Dalzell.\"  \"Very good, Mr. Darrin.\"  \"Is that all you wished to say to me?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Very good, Mr. Pennington.\"  With two very stiff nods the midshipmen parted.  Pennington hastened at once in search of Hallam.  \"Will you serve me, old man?\" queried Pennington.  \"Sorry, but----\"  \"Well, you see, Pen, not knowing all the facts of the case, I must admit that all my sympathies are with Darrin.\"  \"All your sympathies?\" echoed Pen, frowning.  \"Well, nearly all, anyway. You see, I've known and observed Darrin for a full year now, and I don't believe patient old Darry is the one to start any trouble.\"  \"He called me a liar,\" protested Pennington.  \"Did he?\" gasped Hallam.  \"Well, he qualified the statement, but his way of saying it was as offensive as the direct lie could have been.\"  \"So you're bent on fighting Darry?\"  \"I am.\"  \"Too bad!\" muttered Hallam, shaking his head.  \"Are you anxious for your idol?\" asked Pen in a disagreeable tone.  \"No, Penny; it's you that I'm concerned about in my own mind. You're going next to a very hard proposition. Darry is patient--almost as patient as the proverbial camel--but when he fights he fights! You'll be hammered to a pulp, Pen.\"  \"Pooh!\"  \"No one has yet beaten Darrin at a fist fight.\"  \"There always has to be a first time, you know.\"  \"And you think you're It?\"  \"As far as Darrin is concerned--yes.\"  \"Too bad--too bad!\" sighed Hallam. \"I'm afraid, Penny, that the heat in the furnace room was too much for you this morning.\"  \"Then you won't serve as one of my seconds?\"  \"The honor is most regretfully declined,\" replied Hallam in a tone of mock sadness.  \"You want to see Darrin win?\"  \"If there has to be a fight, I do,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.  \"Don't bet your money on him, anyway.\"  \"I'm not a gambler, Penny, and I don't bet,\" replied Hallam, with a dignity that, somehow, ended the conversation.  Pennington had considerable difficulty, at first, in finding a second. At last, however, he induced Decker and Briggs to represent him.  These two midshipmen went to see Dan Dalzell.  \"Wait until I send for Mr. Farley,\" proposed Dalzell. He soon had that midshipman, who was wholly willing to serve Darrin in any capacity.  \"We're ready to have the fight this evening,\" proposed Midshipman Decker.  \"We're not,\" retorted Dan, with vigor.  \"Why not?\"  \"This forenoon Pennington deliberately stepped on Darrin's shoulder, with such force as to lame it a good deal,\" replied Dan. \"Our man insists that he has a right to rest his shoulder, and to wait until to-morrow.\"  \"But to-morrow we have a short shore liberty at Hampton Roads,\" remonstrated Briggs.  \"Yes; and during that shore liberty we can have the fight more safely than on board ship,\" insisted Dalzell.  \"But we intended to devote our shore leave to pleasure,\" objected Decker.  \"You'll find plenty of pleasure, if you accept our proposition,\" urged Dan dryly. \"At any rate, we won't hear of Darrin fighting before to-morrow. He must have to-night to rest that shoulder.\"  \"All right; so be it,\" growled Decker, after a side glance at Briggs.  \"On shore, at some point to be selected by the seconds?\" asked Dan Dalzell.  \"Yes; that's agreed.\"  Details as to whom to invite as referee and time-keeper were also arranged.  \"I suppose we'll have to use up our shore leave that way, then,\" grunted Pennington, when told of the arrangement.  \"There's one way you can save the day,\" grinned Decker.  \"How?\"  \"Put Darrin to sleep in the first round, then hurriedly dress and leave, and enjoy your time on shore.\"  \"But Darrin is a very able man with his fists,\" observed Pennington.  \"Yes; but you're a mile bigger and heavier, and you're spry, too. You ought to handle him with all the ease in the world.\"  \"I don't know,\" muttered Pennington, who didn't intend to make the mistake of bragging in advance. \"I'll do my best, of course.\"  \"Oh, you'll win out, if you're awake,\" predicted Midshipman Briggs confidently.  When the cadets were called, the following morning, they found the battleship fleet at anchor in Hampton Roads.     CHAPTER V   WHEN THE SECONDS WONDERED  One after another the launches sped ashore, carrying their swarms of distinguished looking young midshipmen.  The fight party managed to get off all in the same boat, and on one of the earliest trips.  Pennington was to have ordinary shore leave on the cruise, his fifty demerits to be paid for by loss of privileges on his return to the Naval Academy.  \"Decker,\" proposed Dan, \"you and I can skip away and find a good place in no time. Then we can come back after the others.\"  \"That's agreeable to me,\" nodded Midshipman Decker.  In twenty minutes the two seconds were back.  \"We've found just the place,\" announced Decker. \"And it isn't more than three minutes' walk from here. Will you all hurry along?\"  \"The place\" turned out to be a barn that had not been used for a year or more. The floor was almost immaculately clean. In consideration of two dollars handed him, the owner had agreed to display no curiosity, and not to mention the affair to any one.  \"How do you like it, Darry?\" asked Dan anxiously.  \"It will suit me as well as any other place,\" responded Dave, slipping off his blouse, folding it neatly and putting it aside, his uniform cap following.  \"And you?\" asked Decker of his man.  \"The floor's hard, but I don't expect to be the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10045"],["title","Dave Darrin's Second Year at Annapolis (#6)"],["body","to hit it,\" replied Pennington.  In five minutes both midshipmen were attired for their \"affair.\" Between them the different members of the party had smuggled ashore shoes, old trousers and belts for the fighters.  It being a class affair, Remington, of the third class, had come along as referee, while Dawley; was to be the time-keeper.  \"If the principals are ready, let them step forward,\" ordered Midshipman Remington, going to the middle of the floor. \"Now, I understand that this is to be a finish fight; rounds, two minutes; rests, two minutes. I also understand that the principals do not care to shake hands before the call to mix up.\"  Darrin and Pennington nodded their assent.  \"Take your places, gentlemen,\" ordered the referee quickly. \"Are you ready, gentlemen?\"  \"Yes,\" came from both principals.  \"Time!\"  Both men had their guards up. As the word left the referee's lips each tried two or three passes which the other blocked. Midshipman Pennington was trying to take his opponent's \"measure.\"  Then Dave ducked, darted, dodged and wheeled about. Pennington had to follow him, and it made the latter angry.  \"Stand up and fight, can't you,\" hissed Pen.  \"Silence during the rounds, Mr. Pennington,\" admonished the referee quietly. \"Let the officials do all the talking that may be necessary.\"  Dave, as he dodged again, and came up unscathed, grinned broadly over this rebuke. That grin made Pen angrier than anything else could have done.  \"I'll wipe that grin off his face!\" muttered Pennington angrily.  And this very thing Pennington tried hard to do. He was quick on his own feet, and for a few seconds he followed the dodging Darrin about, raining in blows that required all of Dave's adroitness to escape.  Dave's very success, however, made his opponent all the angrier. From annoyance, followed by excessive irritation, Pennington went into almost blind rage--and the man who does that, anywhere in life, must always pay for it.  Suddenly Dave swung his right in on the point of Pen's chin with a force that jolted the larger midshipman. As part of the same movement, Darrin's left crashed against Pennington's nose.  Then, out of chivalry, Dave dropped back, to give Pen a few moments, in case he needed them, to get his wits back.  \"Time!\" roared Dawley, and Pennington's seconds pounced upon him and bore him away to his corner.  \"Now I know how that fellow Darrin wins his fights,\" growled Pennington in an undertone. \"He keeps on running away until he has the other man gasping for breath. Then Darrin jumps in and wins.\"  \"The method doesn't much matter,\" commented Briggs dryly, as he and Decker worked over their man. \"It's the result that counts. Rush Darry into a tight corner, Pen, and then slam him hard and sufficiently.\"  \"Thanks, fellows; now I'm all right for the second round.\" muttered Midshipman Pennington.  In a few seconds more Dave and his opponent were hard at work.  Dave still used his footwork, and most cleverly. Yet, wherever he went, Pen followed him nimbly. It didn't look so one sided now.  Then Pennington, at last, managed to deliver one blow on Darrin's right short ribs. It took a lot of Dave's spare wind; he raced about, seeking to regain his wind before allowing close quarters. But at last Pennington closed in again, and, after a swift feint, tried to land the same short-rib blow.  Darrin was watching, and blocked. Then, his temples reddening with anger, Dave swung in a huge one that crashed in under Pennington's right ear.  \"Time!\" shouted Dawley, just as Pen went to the floor in a heap. That saved the larger midshipman from having to take the count. His seconds had him ready at the call for the third round.  Now, suddenly, Darrin seemed to change not only his tactics, but his whole personality. To his opponent Dave seemed suddenly transformed into a dancing demon.  It was about the same old footwork, but it was aggressive now, instead of being defensive.  First, Dave landed a light tap on the already suffering nose. A few seconds later he landed on the point of Pen's chin, though not hard enough to send his man down. Then a rather light blow on the jaw, just under Pen's right ear again. The larger midshipman was now thoroughly alarmed. He feared that Darrin could do whatever he willed, and shivered with wonder as to when the knockout blow would come.  The truth was, Pennington was still putting up a better battle than he himself realized, and Darrin was not disposed to take any foolish chances through rushing the affair. Thus, the third round ended.  By the time that they came up for the fourth round, after both men had undergone some vigorous handling by their respective seconds, Pennington was a good deal revived and far more confident.  Dave's tactics were the same in the fourth round. Pennington didn't find time to develop much in the way of tactics for himself, save to defend himself.  During the first minute no important blows were landed on either side. Then, suddenly, Dave darted in and under, and brought a right-arm hook against Pen's nose in a way that started that member to bleeding again, and with a steady flow.  That jarred the larger midshipman. He plunged in, heavily and blindly, blocking one of Darrin's blows by wrapping both arms around him.  \"None of that, Mr. Pennington! Break away fast!\" ordered Midshipman Remington quickly.  Dave took a fair get away, not attempting to strike as the clinch was broken. But an instant later Dave came back, dancing all around his dazed opponent, landing on the short ribs, on the breast bone, under either ear and finally on the tip of the chin.  Pen was sure that none of these blows had been delivered with the force that Darrin could have sent in.  \"Time!\" shouted Midshipman Dawley.  The principals retired to their corners, Pennington almost wholly afraid from the conviction that his antagonist was now merely playing with him to keep the interest going.  So Pennington was still rather badly scared when the two came together for the fifth round.  \"Get lively, now, gentlemen, if you can,\" begged Referee Remington. \"Finish this one way or the other, and let us get some of the benefits of our shore leave.\"  Pen started by putting more steam behind every blow. Dave, who had used up so much of his wind by his brilliant footwork, began to find it harder to keep the upper hand.  Twice, however, he managed to land body blows. He was trying to drive in a third when Pennington blocked, following this with a left-arm jab on Darrin's left jaw that sent the lighter man to the floor.  Instantly Dawley began to count off the seconds.  \"--seven, eight, nine, te----\"  Dave was up on his feet. Pen tried to make a quick rush, but Darrin dodged cleverly, them wheeled and faced his opponent as the latter wheeled about.  After that there was less footwork. Both men stood up to it, as keenly alert as they could be, each trying to drive home heavy blows. While they were still at it the call of time sounded.  \"Don't let him put it over you, David, little giant!\" warned Dan, as the latter and Farley vigorously massaged Darrin's muscles. \"He all but had you, and there isn't any need of making Pen a present of the meeting.\"  \"I tried to get him,\" muttered Dave in an undertone, \"and I shall go on trying to the last. But Pennington is pretty nearly superior to anyone in my class.\"  \"Just waltz in and show him,\" whispered Dalzell, as the call sounded.  Pennington entered the sixth round with more confidence. He began, at the outset, to drive in heavy blows, nor did Dave do much dodging.  Bump! Twenty-five seconds only of this round had gone when Darrin landed his right fist with fearful force upon the high point of Pennington's jaw.  Down went the larger midshipman again. This time he moaned. His eyes were open, though they had a somewhat glassy look in them.  Dawley was counting off the seconds in measured tones.  \"--seven, eight, nine--ten!\"  Pen had struggled to rise to his feet, but sank back with a gasp of despair and rage.  \"Mr. Pennington loses the count and the fight,\" announced Referee Remington coolly. \"I don't believe we're needed here, Dawley. The seconds can handle the wreck. Come along.\"  As the two officials of the meeting hustled out of the barn, Dalzell gave his attention to helping his chum, while Farley went over to offer his services in getting the vanquished midshipman into shape.  \"There were times when I could have closed both of Pennington's eyes,\" murmured Dave to Dan. \"But I didn't want to give him any disfiguring marks that would start questions on board ship.\"  \"You had him whipped from the start,\" murmured Dan confidently, as he sprayed, then rubbed Dave's chest and arms.  \"Maybe, but I'm not so sure of that,\" rejoined Darrin. \"That fellow isn't so easy a prize for any one in my class. There were times when I was all but convinced that he had me.\"  \"Oh, fairy tales!\" grunted Dan.  \"Have it your own way, then, Danny boy!\"  When Darrin and his seconds left the barn they went off to enjoy what remained of the shore leave. Pennington's seconds finally, at his own request, left him at an ice cream parlor, where he proposed to remain until he could return to the big, steel \"Massachusetts\" without exciting any wonder over the little time he had remained ashore. Pennington had strength to walk about, but he was far from being in really good shape, and preferred to keep quiet.     CHAPTER VI   IN TROUBLE ON FOREIGN SOIL  From Hampton Roads the Battleship Squadron, with the midshipmen on board, sailed directly for Plymouth, England.  During most of the voyage over slow cruising speed was used. By the time that England's coast was sighted the third-class middies found they knew much more about a battleship than they had believed to be possible at the start of the voyage.  They had served as firemen; they had mastered many of the electrical details of a battleship; they had received instruction and had \"stood trick\" by the engines; there had been some drill"]]]
