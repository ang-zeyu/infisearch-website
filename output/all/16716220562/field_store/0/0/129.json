FINLAND  Feet and faces tingle   In that frore land: Legs wobble and go wingle,   You scarce can stand.  The skies are jewelled all around, The ploughshare snaps in the iron ground, The Finn with face like paper And eyes like a lighted taper Hurls his rough rune At the wintry moon And stamps to mark the tune.     A PINCH OF SALT  When a dream is born in you   With a sudden clamorous pain, When you know the dream is true   And lovely, with no flaw nor stain, O then, be careful, or with sudden clutch You'll hurt the delicate thing you prize so much.  Dreams are like a bird that mocks,   Flirting the feathers of his tail. When you seize at the salt-box   Over the hedge you'll see him sail. Old birds are neither caught with salt nor chaff: They watch you from the apple bough and laugh.  Poet, never chase the dream.   Laugh yourself and turn away. Mask your hunger, let it seem Small matter if he come or stay; But when he nestles in your hand at last, Close up your fingers tight and hold him fast.     THE CATERPILLAR  Under this loop of honeysuckle, A creeping, coloured caterpillar, I gnaw the fresh green hawthorn spray, I nibble it leaf by leaf away.  Down beneath grow dandelions, Daisies, old-man's-looking-glasses; Rooks flap croaking across the lane. I eat and swallow and eat again.  Here come raindrops helter-skelter; I munch and nibble unregarding: Hawthorn leaves are juicy and firm. I'll mind my business: I'm a good worm.  When I'm old, tired, melancholy, I'll build a leaf-green mausoleum Close by, here on this lovely spray, And die and dream the ages away.  Some say worms win resurrection, With white wings beating flitter-flutter, But wings or a sound sleep, why should I care? Either way I'll miss my share.  Under this loop of honeysuckle, A hungry, hairy caterpillar, I crawl on my high and swinging seat, And eat, eat, eat--as one ought to eat.     SORLEY'S WEATHER  When outside the icy rain   Comes leaping helter-skelter, Shall I tie my restive brain   Snugly under shelter?  Shall I make a gentle song   Here in my firelit study, When outside the winds blow strong   And the lanes are muddy?  With old wine and drowsy meats   Am I to fill my belly? Shall I glutton here with Keats?   Shall I drink with Shelley?  Tobacco's pleasant, firelight's good:   Poetry makes both better. Clay is wet and so is mud,   Winter rains are wetter.  Yet rest there, Shelley, on the sill,   For though the winds come frorely, I'm away to the rain-blown hill   And the ghost of Sorley.     THE COTTAGE  Here in turn succeed and rule Carter, smith, and village fool, Then again the place is known As tavern, shop, and Sunday-school; Now somehow it's come to me To light the fire and hold the key, Here in Heaven to reign alone.  All the walls are white with lime, Big blue periwinkles climb And kiss the crumbling window-sill; Snug inside I sit and rhyme, Planning, poem, book, or fable, At my darling beech-wood table Fresh with bluebells from the hill.  Through the window I can see Rooks above the cherry-tree, Sparrows in the violet bed, Bramble-bush and bumble-bee, And old red bracken smoulders still Among boulders on the hill, Far too bright to seem quite dead.  But old Death, who can't forget, Waits his time and watches yet, Waits and watches by the door. Look, he's got a great new net, And when my fighting starts afresh Stouter cord and smaller mesh Won't be cheated as before.  Nor can kindliness of Spring, Flowers that smile nor birds that sing. Bumble-bee nor butterfly, Nor grassy hill nor anything Of magic keep me safe to rhyme In this Heaven beyond my time. No! for Death is waiting by.     THE LAST POST  The bugler sent a call of high romance-- \"Lights out! Lights out!\" to the deserted square. On the thin brazen notes he threw a prayer, \"God, if it's _this_ for me next time in France ... O spare the phantom bugle as I lie Dead in the gas and smoke and roar of guns, Dead in a row with the other broken ones Lying so stiff and still under the sky, Jolly young Fusiliers too good to die.\"     WHEN I'M KILLED  When I'm killed, don't think of me Buried there in Cambrin Wood, Nor as in Zion think of me With the Intolerable Good. And there's one thing that I know well, I'm damned if I'll be damned to Hell!  So when I'm killed, don't wait for me, Walking the dim corridor; In Heaven or Hell, don't wait for me, Or you must wait for evermore. You'll find me buried, living-dead In these verses that you've read.  So when I'm killed, don't mourn for me, Shot, poor lad, so bold and young, Killed and gone--don't mourn for me. On your lips my life is hung: O friends and lovers, you can save Your playfellow from the grave.     LETTER TO S.S. FROM MAMETZ WOOD  I never dreamed we'd meet that day In our old haunts down Fricourt way, Plotting such marvellous journeys there For jolly old \"Apr鋊-la-guerre.\"  Well, when it's over, first we'll meet At Gweithdy Bach, my country seat In Wales, a curious little shop With two rooms and a roof on top, A sort of Morlancourt-ish billet That never needs a crowd to fill it. But oh, the country round about! The sort of view that makes you shout For want of any better way Of praising God: there's a blue bay Shining in front, and on the right Snowden and Hebog capped with white, And lots of other jolly peaks That you could wonder at for weeks, With jag and spur and hump and cleft. There's a grey castle on the left, And back in the high Hinterland You'll see the grave of Shawn Knarlbrand, Who slew the savage Buffaloon By the Nant-col one night in June, And won his surname from the horn Of this prodigious unicorn. Beyond, where the two Rhinogs tower, Rhinog Fach and Rhinog Fawr, Close there after a four years' chase From Thessaly and the woods of Thrace, The beaten Dog-cat stood at bay And growled and fought and passed away. You'll see where mountain conies grapple With prayer and creed in their rock chapel Which Ben and Claire once built for them; They call it S鐩r Bethlehem. You'll see where in old Roman days, Before Revivals changed our ways, The Virgin 'scaped the Devil's grab, Printing her foot on a stone slab With five clear toe-marks; and you'll find The fiendish thumbprint close behind. You'll see where Math, Mathonwy's son, Spoke with the wizard Gwydion And bad him from South Wales set out To steal that creature with the snout, That new-discovered grunting beast Divinely flavoured for the feast. No traveller yet has hit upon A wilder land than Meirion, For desolate hills and tumbling stones, Bogland and melody and old bones. Fairies and ghosts are here galore, And poetry most splendid, more Than can be written with the pen Or understood by common men.  In Gweithdy Bach we'll rest awhile, We'll dress our wounds and learn to smile With easier lips; we'll stretch our legs, And live on bilberry tart and eggs, And store up solar energy, Basking in sunshine by the sea, Until we feel a match once more For _anything_ but another war.  So then we'll kiss our families, And sail across the seas (The God of Song protecting us) To the great hills of Caucasus. Robert will learn the local _bat_ For billeting and things like that, If Siegfried learns the piccolo To charm the people as we go.  The jolly peasants clad in furs Will greet the Welch-ski officers With open arms, and ere we pass Will make us vocal with Kavasse. In old Bagdad we'll call a halt At the S滻huns' ancestral vault; We'll catch the Persian rose-flowers' scent, And understand what Omar meant. Bitlis and Mush will know our faces, Tiflis and Tomsk, and all such places. Perhaps eventually we'll get Among the Tartars of Thibet. Hobnobbing with the Chungs and Mings, And doing wild, tremendous things In free adventure, quest and fight, And God! what poetry we'll write!     A DEAD BOCHE  To you who'd read my songs of War   And only hear of blood and fame, I'll say (you've heard it said before)   \"War's Hell!\" and if you doubt the same, Today I found in Mametz Wood A certain cure for lust of blood:  Where, propped against a shattered trunk,   In a great mess of things unclean, Sat a dead Boche; he scowled and stunk   With clothes and face a sodden green, Big-bellied, spectacled, crop-haired, Dribbling black blood from nose and beard.     FAUN  Here down this very way, Here only yesterday   King Faun went leaping. He sang, with careless shout Hurling his name about; He sang, with oaken stock His steps from rock to rock   In safety keeping,     \"Here Faun is free,     Here Faun is free!\"  Today against yon pine, Forlorn yet still divine,   King Faun leant weeping. \"They drank my holy brook, My strawberries they took, My private path they trod.\" Loud wept the desolate God, Scorn on scorn heaping,   \"Faun, what is he,   Faun, what is he?\"     THE SPOILSPORT  My familiar ghost again   Comes to see what he can see, Critic, son of Conscious Brain,   Spying on our privacy.  Slam the window, bolt the door,   Yet he'll enter in and stay; In tomorrow's book he'll score   Indiscretions of today.  Whispered love and muttered fears,   How their echoes fly about! None escape his watchful ears,   Every sigh might be a shout.  No kind words nor angry cries   Turn away this grim spoilsport; No fine lady's pleading eyes,   Neither love, nor hate, nor ... port.  Critics wears no smile of fun,   Speaks no word of blame nor praise, Counts our kisses one by one,   Notes each gesture, every phrase.  My familiar ghost again   Stands or squats where suits him best; Critic, son of Conscious Brain,   Listens, watches, takes no rest.     THE SHIVERING BEGGAR  Near Clapham village, where fields began, Saint Edward met a beggar man. It was Christmas morning, the church bells tolled, The old man trembled for the fierce cold.  Saint Edward cried, \"It is monstrous sin A beggar to lie in rags so thin! An old grey-beard and the frost so keen: I shall give him my fur-lined gaberdine.\"  He stripped off his gaberdine of scarlet And wrapped it round the aged varlet, Who clutched at the folds"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10122"],["title","Fairies and Fusiliers (#2)"],["body","a muttered curse, Quaking and chattering seven times worse.  Said Edward, \"Sir, it would seem you freeze Most bitter at your extremities. Here are gloves and shoes and stockings also, That warm upon your way you may go.\"  The man took stocking and shoe and glove, Blaspheming Christ our Saviour's love, Yet seemed to find but little relief, Shaking and shivering like a leaf.  Said the saint again, \"I have no great riches, Yet take this tunic, take these breeches, My shirt and my vest, take everything, And give due thanks to Jesus the King.\"  The saint stood naked upon the snow Long miles from where he was lodged at Bowe, Praying, \"O God! my faith, it grows faint! This would try the temper of any saint.  \"Make clean my heart, Almighty, I pray, And drive these sinful thoughts away. Make clean my heart if it be Thy will, This damned old rascal's shivering still!\"  He stooped, he touched the beggar man's shoulder; He asked him did the frost nip colder? \"Frost!\" said the beggar, \"no, stupid lad! 'Tis the palsy makes me shiver so bad.\"     JONAH  A purple whale Proudly sweeps his tail Towards Nineveh; Glassy green Surges between A mile of roaring sea.  \"O town of gold, Of splendour multifold, Lucre and lust, Leviathan's eye Can surely spy Thy doom of death and dust.\"  On curving sands Vengeful Jonah stands. \"Yet forty days, Then down, down, Tumbles the town In flaming ruin ablaze.\"  With swift lament Those Ninevites repent. They cry in tears, \"Our hearts fail! The whale, the whale! Our sins prick us like spears.\"  Jonah is vexed; He cries, \"What next? what next?\" And shakes his fist. \"Stupid city, The shame, the pity, The glorious crash I've missed.\"  Away goes Jonah grumbling, Murmuring and mumbling; Off ploughs the purple whale, With disappointed tail.     JOHN SKELTON  What could be dafter Than John Skelton's laughter? What sound more tenderly Than his pretty poetry? So where to rank old Skelton? He was no monstrous Milton, Nor wrote no \"Paradise Lost,\" So wondered at by most, Phrased so disdainfully, Composed so painfully. He struck what Milton missed, Milling an English grist With homely turn and twist. He was English through and through, Not Greek, nor French, nor Jew, Though well their tongues he knew, The living and the dead: Learned Erasmus said, _Hie 'unum Britannicarum Lumen et decus literarum._ But oh, Colin Clout! How his pen flies about, Twiddling and turning, Scorching and burning, Thrusting and thrumming! How it hurries with humming, Leaping and running, At the tipsy-topsy Tunning Of Mistress Eleanor Rumming! How for poor Philip Sparrow Was murdered at Carow, How our hearts he does harrow Jest and grief mingle In this jangle-jingle, For he will not stop To sweep nor mop, To prune nor prop, To cut each phrase up Like beef when we sup, Nor sip at each line As at brandy-wine, Or port when we dine. But angrily, wittily, Tenderly, prettily, Laughingly, learnedly, Sadly, madly, Helter-skelter John Rhymes serenely on, As English poets should. Old John, you do me good!     I WONDER WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE DROWNED?  Look at my knees, That island rising from the steamy seas! The candles a tall lightship; my two hands Are boats and barges anchored to the sands, With mighty cliffs all round; They're full of wine and riches from far lands.... _I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?_  I can make caves, By lifting up the island and huge waves And storms, and then with head and ears well under Blow bubbles with a monstrous roar like thunder, A bull-of-Bashan sound. The seas run high and the boats split asunder.... _I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?_  The thin soap slips And slithers like a shark under the ships. My toes are on the soap-dish--that's the effect Of my huge storms; an iron steamer's wrecked. The soap slides round and round; He's biting the old sailors, I expect.... _I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?_     DOUBLE RED DAISIES  Double red daisies, they're my flowers,   Which nobody else may grow. In a big quarrelsome house like ours   They try it sometimes--but no, I root them up because they're my flowers,   Which nobody else may grow.  _Claire has a tea-rose, but she didn't plant it; Ben has an iris, but I don't want it. Daisies, double red daisies for me, The beautifulest flowers in the garden._  Double red daisy, that's my mark:   I paint it in all my books! It's carved high up on the beech-tree bark,   How neat and lovely it looks! So don't forget that it's my trade mark;   Don't copy it in your books.  _Claire has a tea-rose, but she didn't plant it; Ben has an iris, but I don't want it. Daisies, double red daisies for me, The beautifulest flowers in the garden._     CAREERS  Father is quite the greatest poet   That ever lived anywhere. You say you're going to write great music--   I chose that first: it's unfair. Besides, now I can't be the greatest painter and     do Christ and angels, or lovely pears     and apples and grapes on a green dish,     or storms at sea, or anything lovely, Because that's been taken by Claire.  It's stupid to be an engine-driver,   And soldiers are horrible men. I won't be a tailor, I won't be a sailor,   And gardener's taken by Ben. It's unfair if you say that you'll write great     music, you horrid, you unkind (I simply     loathe you, though you are my     sister), you beast, cad, coward, cheat,     bully, liar! Well? Say what's left for me then! But _we_ won't go to your ugly music.   (Listen!) Ben will garden and dig, And Claire will finish her wondrous pictures   All flaming and splendid and big.  And I'll be a perfectly marvellous carpenter,     and I'll make cupboards and benches     and tables and ... and baths, and     nice wooden boxes for studs and     money, And you'll be jealous, you pig!     I'D LOVE TO BE A FAIRY'S CHILD  Children born of fairy stock Never need for shirt or frock, Never want for food or fire, Always get their heart's desire: Jingle pockets full of gold, Marry when they're seven years old. Every fairy child may keep Two strong ponies and ten sheep; All have houses, each his own, Built of brick or granite stone; They live on cherries, they run wild-- I'd love to be a Fairy's child.     THE NEXT WAR  You young friskies who today Jump and fight in Father's hay With bows and arrows and wooden spears, Playing at Royal Welch Fusiliers, Happy though these hours you spend, Have they warned you how games end? Boys, from the first time you prod And thrust with spears of curtain-rod, From the first time you tear and slash Your long-bows from the garden ash, Or fit your shaft with a blue jay feather, Binding the split tops together, From that same hour by fate you're bound As champions of this stony ground, Loyal and true in everything, To serve your Army and your King, Prepared to starve and sweat and die Under some fierce foreign sky, If only to keep safe those joys That belong to British boys, To keep young Prussians from the soft Scented hay of father's loft, And stop young Slavs from cutting bows And bendy spears from Welsh hedgerows.   Another War soon gets begun, A dirtier, a more glorious one; Then, boys, you'll have to play, all in; It's the cruellest team will win. So hold your nose against the stink And never stop too long to think. Wars don't change except in name; The next one must go just the same, And new foul tricks unguessed before Will win and justify this War. Kaisers and Czars will strut the stage Once more with pomp and greed and rage; Courtly ministers will stop At home and fight to the last drop; By the million men will die In some new horrible agony; And children here will thrust and poke, Shoot and die, and laugh at the joke, With bows and arrows and wooden spears, Playing at Royal Welch Fusiliers.     STRONG BEER  \"What do you think The bravest drink Under the sky?\" \"Strong beer,\" said I.  \"There's a place for everything, Everything, anything, There's a place for everything Where it ought to be: For a chicken, the hen's wing; For poison, the bee's sting; For almond-blossom, Spring; A beerhouse for me.\"  \"There's a prize for every one Every one, any one, There's a prize for every one, Whoever he may be: Crags for the mountaineer, Flags for the Fusilier, For English poets, beer! Strong beer for me!\"  \"Tell us, now, how and when We may find the bravest men?\" \"A sure test, an easy test: Those that drink beer are the best, Brown beer strongly brewed, English drink and English food.\"  Oh, never choose as Gideon chose By the cold well, but rather those Who look on beer when it is brown, Smack their lips and gulp it down. Leave the lads who tamely drink With Gideon by the water brink, But search the benches of the Plough, The Tun, the Sun, the Spotted Cow, For jolly rascal lads who pray, Pewter in hand, at close of day, \"Teach me to live that I may fear The grave as little as my beer.\"     MARIGOLDS  With a fork drive Nature out,   She will ever yet return; Hedge the flowerbed all about,   Pull or stab or cut or burn,   She will ever yet return.  Look: the constant marigold   Springs again from hidden roots. Baffled gardener, you behold   New beginnings and new shoots   Spring again from hidden roots.   Pull or stab or cut or burn,   They will ever yet return.  Gardener, cursing at the weed,   Ere you curse it further, say: Who but you planted the seed   In my fertile heart, one day?   Ere you curse me further, say!   New beginnings and new shoots String again from hidden roots Pull or stab or cut or burn, Love must ever yet return.     THE LADY VISITOR IN THE PAUPER WARD  Why do you break upon this old, cool peace, This painted peace of ours, With harsh dress hissing like a flock of geese, With garish flowers? Why do you churn smooth waters rough again, Selfish old skin-and-bone? Leave us to quiet dreaming and slow pain, Leave us alone.     LOVE AND BLACK MAGIC  To the woods, to the woods is the wizard gone; In his grotto the maiden sits alone. She gazes up with a weary smile At the rafter-hanging"]]]
