Against her nought avails Your utmost wisdom. She with foresight plans, Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs The other powers divine. Her changes know Nore intermission: by necessity She is made swift, so frequent come who claim Succession in her favours. This is she, So execrated e’en by those, whose debt To her is rather praise; they wrongfully With blame requite her, and with evil word; But she is blessed, and for that recks not: Amidst the other primal beings glad Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults. Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe Descending: for each star is falling now, That mounted at our entrance, and forbids Too long our tarrying.” We the circle cross’d To the next steep, arriving at a well, That boiling pours itself down to a foss Sluic’d from its source. Far murkier was the wave Than sablest grain: and we in company Of the’ inky waters, journeying by their side, Enter’d, though by a different track, beneath. Into a lake, the Stygian nam’d, expands The dismal stream, when it hath reach’d the foot Of the grey wither’d cliffs. Intent I stood To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks Betok’ning rage. They with their hands alone Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet, Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.  The good instructor spake; “Now seest thou, son! The souls of those, whom anger overcame. This too for certain know, that underneath The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs Into these bubbles make the surface heave, As thine eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turn. Fix’d in the slime they say: “Sad once were we In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun, Carrying a foul and lazy mist within: Now in these murky settlings are we sad.” Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats. But word distinct can utter none.” Our route Thus compass’d we, a segment widely stretch’d Between the dry embankment, and the core Of the loath’d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes Downward on those who gulp’d its muddy lees; Nor stopp’d, till to a tower’s low base we came.     CANTO VIII   My theme pursuing, I relate that ere We reach’d the lofty turret’s base, our eyes Its height ascended, where two cressets hung We mark’d, and from afar another light Return the signal, so remote, that scarce The eye could catch its beam. I turning round To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir’d: “Say what this means? and what that other light In answer set? what agency doth this?”  “There on the filthy waters,” he replied, “E’en now what next awaits us mayst thou see, If the marsh-gender’d fog conceal it not.”  Never was arrow from the cord dismiss’d, That ran its way so nimbly through the air, As a small bark, that through the waves I spied Toward us coming, under the sole sway Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud: “Art thou arriv’d, fell spirit?”—“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, This time thou criest in vain,” my lord replied; “No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er The slimy pool we pass.” As one who hears Of some great wrong he hath sustain’d, whereat Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin’d In his fierce ire. My guide descending stepp’d Into the skiff, and bade me enter next Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem’d The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark’d, Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow, More deeply than with others it is wont.  While we our course o’er the dead channel held. One drench’d in mire before me came, and said; “Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?”  I answer’d: “Though I come, I tarry not; But who art thou, that art become so foul?”  “One, as thou seest, who mourn: “ he straight replied.  To which I thus: “ In mourning and in woe, Curs’d spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well, E’en thus in filth disguis’d.” Then stretch’d he forth Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage Aware, thrusting him back: “Away! down there To the’ other dogs!” then, with his arms my neck Encircling, kiss’d my cheek, and spake: “O soul Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom Thou was conceiv’d! He in the world was one For arrogance noted; to his memory No virtue lends its lustre; even so Here is his shadow furious. There above How many now hold themselves mighty kings Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire, Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!”  I then: “Master! him fain would I behold Whelm’d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.”  He thus: “Or ever to thy view the shore Be offer’d, satisfied shall be that wish, Which well deserves completion.” Scarce his words Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes Set on him with such violence, that yet For that render I thanks to God and praise “To Filippo Argenti:” cried they all: And on himself the moody Florentine Turn’d his avenging fangs. Him here we left, Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear Sudden a sound of lamentation smote, Whereat mine eye unbarr’d I sent abroad.  And thus the good instructor: “Now, my son! Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam’d, With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.”  I thus: “The minarets already, Sir! There certes in the valley I descry, Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire Had issu’d.” He replied: “Eternal fire, That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame Illum’d; as in this nether hell thou seest.”  We came within the fosses deep, that moat This region comfortless. The walls appear’d As they were fram’d of iron. We had made Wide circuit, ere a place we reach’d, where loud The mariner cried vehement: “Go forth! The’ entrance is here!” Upon the gates I spied More than a thousand, who of old from heaven Were hurl’d. With ireful gestures, “Who is this,” They cried, “that without death first felt, goes through The regions of the dead?” My sapient guide Made sign that he for secret parley wish’d; Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus They spake: “Come thou alone; and let him go Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm. Alone return he by his witless way; If well he know it, let him prove. For thee, Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark Hast been his escort.” Now bethink thee, reader! What cheer was mine at sound of those curs’d words. I did believe I never should return.  “O my lov’d guide! who more than seven times Security hast render’d me, and drawn From peril deep, whereto I stood expos’d, Desert me not,” I cried, “in this extreme. And if our onward going be denied, Together trace we back our steps with speed.”  My liege, who thither had conducted me, Replied: “Fear not: for of our passage none Hath power to disappoint us, by such high Authority permitted. But do thou Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur’d I will not leave thee in this lower world.”  This said, departs the sire benevolent, And quits me. Hesitating I remain At war ’twixt will and will not in my thoughts.  I could not hear what terms he offer’d them, But they conferr’d not long, for all at once To trial fled within. Clos’d were the gates By those our adversaries on the breast Of my liege lord: excluded he return’d To me with tardy steps. Upon the ground His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras’d All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake: “Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?” Then thus to me: “That I am anger’d, think No ground of terror: in this trial I Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within For hindrance. This their insolence, not new, Erewhile at gate less secret they display’d, Which still is without bolt; upon its arch Thou saw’st the deadly scroll: and even now On this side of its entrance, down the steep, Passing the circles, unescorted, comes One whose strong might can open us this land.”     CANTO IX   The hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back, Chas’d that from his which newly they had worn, And inwardly restrain’d it. He, as one Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye Not far could lead him through the sable air, And the thick-gath’ring cloud. “It yet behooves We win this fight”—thus he began—” if not— Such aid to us is offer’d.—Oh, how long Me seems it, ere the promis’d help arrive!”  I noted, how the sequel of his words Clok’d their beginning; for the last he spake Agreed not with the first. But not the less My fear was at his saying; sith I drew To import worse perchance, than that he held, His mutilated speech. “Doth ever any Into this rueful concave’s extreme depth Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?”  Thus I inquiring. “Rarely,” he replied, “It chances, that among us any makes This journey, which I wend. Erewhile ’tis true Once came I here beneath, conjur’d by fell Erictho, sorceress, who compell’d the shades Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh Was naked of me, when within these walls She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit From out of Judas’ circle. Lowest place Is that of all, obscurest, and remov’d Farthest from heav’n’s all-circling orb. The road Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure. That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round The city’ of grief encompasses, which now We may not enter without rage.” Yet more He added: but I hold it not in mind, For that mine eye toward the lofty tower Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top. Where in an instant I beheld uprisen At once three hellish furies stain’d with blood: In limb and motion feminine they seem’d; Around them greenest hydras twisting roll’d Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.  He knowing well the miserable hags Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake: “Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left This is Megaera; on the right hand she, Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone I’ th’ midst.”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],["title","Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#5)"],["body","said, in silence he remain’d Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais’d, That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound. “Hasten Medusa: so to adamant Him shall we change;” all looking down exclaim’d. “E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took No ill revenge.” “Turn thyself round, and keep Thy count’nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return Upwards would be for ever lost.” This said, Himself my gentle master turn’d me round, Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own He also hid me. Ye of intellect Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal’d Under close texture of the mystic strain!  And now there came o’er the perturbed waves Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made Either shore tremble, as if of a wind Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung, That ’gainst some forest driving all its might, Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.  Mine eyes he loos’d, and spake: “And now direct Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam, There, thickest where the smoke ascends.” As frogs Before their foe the serpent, through the wave Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits Destroy’d, so saw I fleeing before one Who pass’d with unwet feet the Stygian sound. He, from his face removing the gross air, Oft his left hand forth stretch’d, and seem’d alone By that annoyance wearied. I perceiv’d That he was sent from heav’n, and to my guide Turn’d me, who signal made that I should stand Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full Of noble anger seem’d he! To the gate He came, and with his wand touch’d it, whereat Open without impediment it flew.  “Outcasts of heav’n! O abject race and scorn’d!” Began he on the horrid grunsel standing, “Whence doth this wild excess of insolence Lodge in you? wherefore kick you ’gainst that will Ne’er frustrate of its end, and which so oft Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs? What profits at the fays to but the horn? Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence Bears still, peel’d of their hair, his throat and maw.”  This said, he turn’d back o’er the filthy way, And syllable to us spake none, but wore The semblance of a man by other care Beset, and keenly press’d, than thought of him Who in his presence stands. Then we our steps Toward that territory mov’d, secure After the hallow’d words. We unoppos’d There enter’d; and my mind eager to learn What state a fortress like to that might hold, I soon as enter’d throw mine eye around, And see on every part wide-stretching space Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.  As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles, Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro’s gulf, That closes Italy and laves her bounds, The place is all thick spread with sepulchres; So was it here, save what in horror here Excell’d: for ’midst the graves were scattered flames, Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d, That iron for no craft there hotter needs.  Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath From them forth issu’d lamentable moans, Such as the sad and tortur’d well might raise.  I thus: “Master! say who are these, interr’d Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear The dolorous sighs?” He answer thus return’d:  “The arch-heretics are here, accompanied By every sect their followers; and much more, Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like With like is buried; and the monuments Are different in degrees of heat. “This said, He to the right hand turning, on we pass’d Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.     CANTO X   Now by a secret pathway we proceed, Between the walls, that hem the region round, And the tormented souls: my master first, I close behind his steps. “Virtue supreme!” I thus began; “who through these ample orbs In circuit lead’st me, even as thou will’st, Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. May those, Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen? Already all the lids are rais’d, and none O’er them keeps watch.” He thus in answer spake “They shall be closed all, what-time they here From Josaphat return’d shall come, and bring Their bodies, which above they now have left. The cemetery on this part obtain With Epicurus all his followers, Who with the body make the spirit die. Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon Both to the question ask’d, and to the wish, Which thou conceal’st in silence.” I replied: “I keep not, guide belov’d! from thee my heart Secreted, but to shun vain length of words, A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.”  “O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire Alive art passing, so discreet of speech! Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance Declares the place of thy nativity To be that noble land, with which perchance I too severely dealt.” Sudden that sound Forth issu’d from a vault, whereat in fear I somewhat closer to my leader’s side Approaching, he thus spake: “What dost thou? Turn. Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all Expos’d behold him.” On his face was mine Already fix’d; his breast and forehead there Erecting, seem’d as in high scorn he held E’en hell. Between the sepulchres to him My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt, This warning added: “See thy words be clear!”  He, soon as there I stood at the tomb’s foot, Ey’d me a space, then in disdainful mood Address’d me: “Say, what ancestors were thine?”  I, willing to obey him, straight reveal’d The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow Somewhat uplifting, cried: “Fiercely were they Adverse to me, my party, and the blood From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad Scatter’d them.” “Though driv’n out, yet they each time From all parts,” answer’d I, “return’d; an art Which yours have shown, they are not skill’d to learn.”  Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw, Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin, Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais’d. It look’d around, as eager to explore If there were other with me; but perceiving That fond imagination quench’d, with tears Thus spake: “If thou through this blind prison go’st. Led by thy lofty genius and profound, Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?”  I straight replied: “Not of myself I come, By him, who there expects me, through this clime Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son Had in contempt.” Already had his words And mode of punishment read me his name, Whence I so fully answer’d. He at once Exclaim’d, up starting, “How! said’st thou he HAD? No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye The blessed daylight?” Then of some delay I made ere my reply aware, down fell Supine, not after forth appear’d he more.  Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom I yet was station’d, chang’d not count’nance stern, Nor mov’d the neck, nor bent his ribbed side. “And if,” continuing the first discourse, “They in this art,” he cried, “small skill have shown, That doth torment me more e’en than this bed. But not yet fifty times shall be relum’d Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm, Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art. So to the pleasant world mayst thou return, As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws, Against my kin this people is so fell?”  “The slaughter and great havoc,” I replied, “That colour’d Arbia’s flood with crimson stain— To these impute, that in our hallow’d dome Such orisons ascend.” Sighing he shook The head, then thus resum’d: “In that affray I stood not singly, nor without just cause Assuredly should with the rest have stirr’d; But singly there I stood, when by consent Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz’d, The one who openly forbad the deed.”  “So may thy lineage find at last repose,” I thus adjur’d him, “as thou solve this knot, Which now involves my mind. If right I hear, Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time Leads with him, of the present uninform’d.”  “We view, as one who hath an evil sight,” He answer’d, “plainly, objects far remote: So much of his large spendour yet imparts The’ Almighty Ruler; but when they approach Or actually exist, our intellect Then wholly fails, nor of your human state Except what others bring us know we aught. Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all Our knowledge in that instant shall expire, When on futurity the portals close.”  Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse Smitten, I added thus: “Now shalt thou say To him there fallen, that his offspring still Is to the living join’d; and bid him know, That if from answer silent I abstain’d, ’Twas that my thought was occupied intent Upon that error, which thy help hath solv’d.”  But now my master summoning me back I heard, and with more eager haste besought The spirit to inform me, who with him Partook his lot. He answer thus return’d:  “More than a thousand with me here are laid Within is Frederick, second of that name, And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.” He, this said, from sight withdrew. But I my steps towards the ancient bard Reverting, ruminated on the words Betokening me such ill. Onward he mov’d, And thus in going question’d: “Whence the’ amaze That holds thy senses wrapt?” I satisfied The’ inquiry, and the sage enjoin’d me straight: “Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard To thee importing harm; and note thou this,” With his rais’d finger bidding me take heed,  “When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam, Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life The future tenour will to thee unfold.”  Forthwith he to the left hand turn’d his feet: We left the wall, and tow’rds the middle space Went by a path, that to a valley strikes; Which e’en thus high exhal’d its noisome steam.     CANTO XI   Upon the utmost verge of a high bank, By craggy rocks environ’d round, we came, Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow’d: And here to shun the horrible excess Of fetid exhalation, upward cast From the profound abyss, behind the lid Of a great monument we "]]]
