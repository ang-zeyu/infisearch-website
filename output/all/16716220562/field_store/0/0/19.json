In sooth I had not been so courteous     While I was living, for the great desire     Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.  Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;     And yet I should not be here, were it not     That, having power to sin, I turned to God.  O thou vain glory of the human powers,     How little green upon thy summit lingers,     If’t be not followed by an age of grossness!  In painting Cimabue thought that he     Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,     So that the other’s fame is growing dim.  So has one Guido from the other taken     The glory of our tongue, and he perchance     Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.  Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath     Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,     And changes name, because it changes side.  What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off     From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead     Before thou left the ‘pappo’ and the ‘dindi,’  Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter     Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye     Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.  With him, who takes so little of the road     In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;     And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,  Where he was lord, what time was overthrown     The Florentine delirium, that superb     Was at that day as now ’tis prostitute.  Your reputation is the colour of grass     Which comes and goes, and that discolours it     By which it issues green from out the earth.”  And I: “Thy true speech fills my heart with good     Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;     But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?”  “That,” he replied, “is Provenzan Salvani,     And he is here because he had presumed     To bring Siena all into his hands.  He has gone thus, and goeth without rest     E’er since he died; such money renders back     In payment he who is on earth too daring.”  And I: “If every spirit who awaits     The verge of life before that he repent,     Remains below there and ascends not hither,  (Unless good orison shall him bestead,)     Until as much time as he lived be passed,     How was the coming granted him in largess?”  “When he in greatest splendour lived,” said he,     “Freely upon the Campo of Siena,     All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;  And there to draw his friend from the duress     Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,     He brought himself to tremble in each vein.  I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;     Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours     Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.  This action has released him from those confines.”     Purgatorio: Canto XII   Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,     I with that heavy-laden soul went on,     As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;  But when he said, “Leave him, and onward pass,     For here ’tis good that with the sail and oars,     As much as may be, each push on his barque;”  Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed     My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts     Remained within me downcast and abashed.  I had moved on, and followed willingly     The footsteps of my Master, and we both     Already showed how light of foot we were,  When unto me he said: “Cast down thine eyes;     ’Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,     To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.”  As, that some memory may exist of them,     Above the buried dead their tombs in earth     Bear sculptured on them what they were before;  Whence often there we weep for them afresh,     From pricking of remembrance, which alone     To the compassionate doth set its spur;  So saw I there, but of a better semblance     In point of artifice, with figures covered     Whate’er as pathway from the mount projects.  I saw that one who was created noble     More than all other creatures, down from heaven     Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.  I saw Briareus smitten by the dart     Celestial, lying on the other side,     Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.  I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,     Still clad in armour round about their father,     Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.  I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,     As if bewildered, looking at the people     Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.  O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes     Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,     Between thy seven and seven children slain!  O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword     Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,     That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!  O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld     E’en then half spider, sad upon the shreds     Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!  O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten     Thine image there; but full of consternation     A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!  Displayed moreo’er the adamantine pavement     How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon     Costly appear the luckless ornament;  Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves     Upon Sennacherib within the temple,     And how, he being dead, they left him there;  Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage     That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,     “Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!”  Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians     After that Holofernes had been slain,     And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.  I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;     O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,     Displayed the image that is there discerned!  Whoe’er of pencil master was or stile,     That could portray the shades and traits which there     Would cause each subtile genius to admire?  Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;     Better than I saw not who saw the truth,     All that I trod upon while bowed I went.  Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,     Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces     So that ye may behold your evil ways!  More of the mount by us was now encompassed,     And far more spent the circuit of the sun,     Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,  When he, who ever watchful in advance     Was going on, began: “Lift up thy head,     ’Tis no more time to go thus meditating.  Lo there an Angel who is making haste     To come towards us; lo, returning is     From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.  With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,     So that he may delight to speed us upward;     Think that this day will never dawn again.”  I was familiar with his admonition     Ever to lose no time; so on this theme     He could not unto me speak covertly.  Towards us came the being beautiful     Vested in white, and in his countenance     Such as appears the tremulous morning star.  His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;     “Come,” said he, “near at hand here are the steps,     And easy from henceforth is the ascent.”  At this announcement few are they who come!     O human creatures, born to soar aloft,     Why fall ye thus before a little wind?  He led us on to where the rock was cleft;     There smote upon my forehead with his wings,     Then a safe passage promised unto me.  As on the right hand, to ascend the mount     Where seated is the church that lordeth it     O’er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,  The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken     By stairways that were made there in the age     When still were safe the ledger and the stave,  E’en thus attempered is the bank which falls     Sheer downward from the second circle there;     But on this, side and that the high rock graze.  As we were turning thitherward our persons,     “Beati pauperes spiritu,” voices     Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.  Ah me! how different are these entrances     From the Infernal! for with anthems here     One enters, and below with wild laments.  We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,     And it appeared to me by far more easy     Than on the plain it had appeared before.  Whence I: “My Master, say, what heavy thing     Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly     Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?”  He answered: “When the P’s which have remained     Still on thy face almost obliterate     Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,  Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,     That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,     But urging up will be to them delight.”  Then did I even as they do who are going     With something on the head to them unknown,     Unless the signs of others make them doubt,  Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,     And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office     Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;  And with the fingers of the right hand spread     I found but six the letters, that had carved     Upon my temples he who bore the keys;  Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.     Purgatorio: Canto XIII   We were upon the summit of the stairs,     Where for the second time is cut away     The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.  There in like manner doth a cornice bind     The hill all round about, as does the first,     Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.  Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;     So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,     With but the livid colour of the stone.  “If to inquire we wait for people here,”     The Poet said, “I fear that peradventure     Too much delay will our election have.”  Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,     Made his right side the centre of his motion,     And turned the left part of himself about.  “O thou sweet light! with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1002"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Purgatory (#8)"],["body","in whom I enter     Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,”     Said he, “as one within here should be led.  Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;     If other reason prompt not otherwise,     Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!”  As much as here is counted for a mile,     So much already there had we advanced     In little time, by dint of ready will;  And tow’rds us there were heard to fly, albeit     They were not visible, spirits uttering     Unto Love’s table courteous invitations,  The first voice that passed onward in its flight,     “Vinum non habent,” said in accents loud,     And went reiterating it behind us.  And ere it wholly grew inaudible     Because of distance, passed another, crying,     “I am Orestes!” and it also stayed not.  “O,” said I, “Father, these, what voices are they?”     And even as I asked, behold the third,     Saying: “Love those from whom ye have had evil!”  And the good Master said: “This circle scourges     The sin of envy, and on that account     Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.  The bridle of another sound shall be;     I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,     Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.  But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,     And people thou wilt see before us sitting,     And each one close against the cliff is seated.”  Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;     I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles     Not from the colour of the stone diverse.  And when we were a little farther onward,     I heard a cry of, “Mary, pray for us!”     A cry of, “Michael, Peter, and all Saints!”  I do not think there walketh still on earth     A man so hard, that he would not be pierced     With pity at what afterward I saw.  For when I had approached so near to them     That manifest to me their acts became,     Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.  Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,     And one sustained the other with his shoulder,     And all of them were by the bank sustained.  Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,     Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,     And one upon another leans his head,  So that in others pity soon may rise,     Not only at the accent of their words,     But at their aspect, which no less implores.  And as unto the blind the sun comes not,     So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,     Heaven’s light will not be bounteous of itself;  For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,     And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild     Is done, because it will not quiet stay.  To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,     Seeing the others without being seen;     Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.  Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,     And therefore waited not for my demand,     But said: “Speak, and be brief, and to the point.”  I had Virgilius upon that side     Of the embankment from which one may fall,     Since by no border ’tis engarlanded;  Upon the other side of me I had     The shades devout, who through the horrible seam     Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.  To them I turned me, and, “O people, certain,”     Began I, “of beholding the high light,     Which your desire has solely in its care,  So may grace speedily dissolve the scum     Upon your consciences, that limpidly     Through them descend the river of the mind,  Tell me, for dear ’twill be to me and gracious,     If any soul among you here is Latian,     And ’twill perchance be good for him I learn it.”  “O brother mine, each one is citizen     Of one true city; but thy meaning is,     Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.”  By way of answer this I seemed to hear     A little farther on than where I stood,     Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.  Among the rest I saw a shade that waited     In aspect, and should any one ask how,     Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.  “Spirit,” I said, “who stoopest to ascend,     If thou art he who did reply to me,     Make thyself known to me by place or name.”  “Sienese was I,” it replied, “and with     The others here recleanse my guilty life,     Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.  Sapient I was not, although I Sapia     Was called, and I was at another’s harm     More happy far than at my own good fortune.  And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,     Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.     The arc already of my years descending,  My fellow-citizens near unto Colle     Were joined in battle with their adversaries,     And I was praying God for what he willed.  Routed were they, and turned into the bitter     Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,     A joy received unequalled by all others;  So that I lifted upward my bold face     Crying to God, ‘Henceforth I fear thee not,’     As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.  Peace I desired with God at the extreme     Of my existence, and as yet would not     My debt have been by penitence discharged,  Had it not been that in remembrance held me     Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,     Who out of charity was grieved for me.  But who art thou, that into our conditions     Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound     As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?”  “Mine eyes,” I said, “will yet be here ta’en from me,     But for short space; for small is the offence     Committed by their being turned with envy.  Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended     My soul is, of the torment underneath,     For even now the load down there weighs on me.”  And she to me: “Who led thee, then, among us     Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?”     And I: “He who is with me, and speaks not;  And living am I; therefore ask of me,     Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move     O’er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.”  “O, this is such a novel thing to hear,”     She answered, “that great sign it is God loves thee;     Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.  And I implore, by what thou most desirest,     If e’er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,     Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.  Them wilt thou see among that people vain     Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there     More hope than in discovering the Diana;  But there still more the admirals will lose.”     Purgatorio: Canto XIV   “Who is this one that goes about our mountain,     Or ever Death has given him power of flight,     And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?”  “I know not who, but know he’s not alone;     Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,     And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.”  Thus did two spirits, leaning tow’rds each other,     Discourse about me there on the right hand;     Then held supine their faces to address me.  And said the one: “O soul, that, fastened still     Within the body, tow’rds the heaven art going,     For charity console us, and declare  Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak’st us     As much to marvel at this grace of thine     As must a thing that never yet has been.”  And I: “Through midst of Tuscany there wanders     A streamlet that is born in Falterona,     And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;  From thereupon do I this body bring.     To tell you who I am were speech in vain,     Because my name as yet makes no great noise.”  “If well thy meaning I can penetrate     With intellect of mine,” then answered me     He who first spake, “thou speakest of the Arno.”  And said the other to him: “Why concealed     This one the appellation of that river,     Even as a man doth of things horrible?”  And thus the shade that questioned was of this     Himself acquitted: “I know not; but truly     ’Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;  For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant     The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro     That in few places it that mark surpasses)  To where it yields itself in restoration     Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,     Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,  Virtue is like an enemy avoided     By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune     Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;  On which account have so transformed their nature     The dwellers in that miserable valley,     It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.  ’Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier     Than other food for human use created,     It first directeth its impoverished way.  Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,     More snarling than their puissance demands,     And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.  It goes on falling, and the more it grows,     The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,     This maledict and misadventurous ditch.  Descended then through many a hollow gulf,     It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,     They fear no cunning that may master them.  Nor will I cease because another hears me;     And well ’twill be for him, if still he mind him     Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.  Thy grandson I behold, who doth become     A hunter of those wolves upon the bank     Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.  He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;     Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;     Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.  Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;     He leaves it such, a thousand years from now     In its primeval state ’tis not re-wooded.”  As at the announcement of impending ills     The face of him who listens is disturbed,     From whate’er side the peril seize upon him;  So I beheld that other soul, which stood     Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,     When it had gathered to itself the word.  The speech of one and aspect of the other     Had me desirous made to know their names,     And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,  Whereat the spirit which first spake to me     Began again: “Thou wishest I should bring me     To do for thee what thou’lt not do for me;  But since God willeth that in thee"]]]
