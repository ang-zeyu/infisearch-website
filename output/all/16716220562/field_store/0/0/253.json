I guess you'd think _that_ was pretty poor! And got the molasses all over your face, because you couldn't see to put it in your mouth. And had that woman shake you every time you spoke. And your paw in State's Prison because he killed a man. O, no,\" repeated she, with triumph, \"there isn't any other little girl in this school that's had so much trouble as I have.\"  \"No, I s'pose not,\" responded Dotty, giving up the attempt to compare trials with such a wretched being; \"but then I may be blind, some time, too. P'rhaps a chicken will pick my eyes out. A cross hen flew right up and did so to a boy.\"  Emily paid no attention to this foolish remark.  \"My paw writes me letters,\" said she. \"Here is one in my pocket; would you like to read it?\"  Dotty took the letter, which was badly written and worse spelled.  \"Can you read it?\" asked Emily, after Dotty had turned it over for some moments in silence.  \"No, I cannot,\" replied Dotty, very much ashamed; \"but I'm going to school by and by, and then I shall learn everything.\"  \"O, no matter if you can't read it to me; my teacher has read it ever so many times. At the end of it, it says, 'Your unhappy and unfortunate paw.' That is what he always says at the end of all his letters; and he wants me to go to the prison to see him.\"  \"Why, you _couldn't_ see him.\"  \"No,\" replied Emily, not understanding that Dotty referred to her blindness; \"no, I couldn't see him. The superintendent Wouldn't let me go; he says it's no place for little girls.\"  \"I shouldn't think it was,\" said Dotty, looking around for Flyaway, who was riding in a lady's chair made by two admiring little girls.  \"There was one thing I didn't tell,\" said Emily, who felt obliged to pour her whole history into her new friend's ears; \"I was sick last spring, and had a fever. If it had been scarlet fever I should have died; but it was _imitation_ of scarlet fever, and I got well.\"  \"I'm glad you got well,\" said Dotty, rather tired of Emily's troubles; \"but don't you want to play with the other girls? I do.\"  \"Yes; let us play Rollo on the Ocean,\" cried Octavia, who was Emily's bosom friend, and was seldom away from her long at a time, but had just now been devoting herself to Katie. \"Here is the ship. All aboard!\"     CHAPTER III.  PLAYING SHIP.   Now this ship was an old wagon-body, and had never been in water deeper than a mud puddle. A dozen little girls climbed in with great bustle and confusion, pretending they were walking a plank and climbing up some steps. After they were fairly on board they waved their handkerchiefs for a good by to their friends on shore. Then Octavia fired peas out of a little popgun twice, and this was meant as a long farewell to the land. Now they were fairly out on the ocean, and began to rock back and forth, as if tossed by a heavy sea.  \"See how the waves rise!\" said Emily, and threw up her hands with an undulating motion. \"I can see them,\" she cried, an intent look coming into her closed eyes; \"they are green, with white bubbles like soap suds. And the sun shines on them so! O, 'tis as beautiful as flowers!\"  \"Booful as flowers!\" echoed Flyaway, who was one of the passengers; while Dotty wondered how Octavia knew the difference between green and white. She did not know; and what sort of a picture she painted in her mind of the mysterious sea I am sure I cannot tell.  \"Now,\" said Miriam Lake, the prettiest of the children, \"it is time to strike the bells.\"  So she struck a tea-bell with a stick eight times.  \"That is eight bells,\" explained she to Dotty, \"and it means four o'clock. But, Jennie Holiday, where is the kitten? Why, we are not half ready.\"  The children never thought they could play \"ship\" without a kitten, a gray and white one which they put into a cage just as Jennie Holiday did, when she and Rollo travelled by themselves from New York to Liverpool. When the kitten had been brought, they had got as far as Long Island Sound, and they said the kitten was sent by a ship of war which had to be \"spoken.\"  \"This is a funny way to play,\" said Miriam. \"Here we are at Halifax, and nobody has heaved the log yet.\"  \"No,\" said Octavia; \"so we can't tell how many knots an hour we are going.\"  \"_I'm_ going a great many knocks,\" cried Katie, whose exertions in rocking from side to side had thrown her overboard once.  \"We never'll get to Liverpool in this world,\" said Emily, \"unless Miss Percival comes and steers the ship.\"  It happened at that very moment that Miss Percival came into the yard with aunt Maria.  \"If you will excuse me, Mrs. Clifford,\" said she, laughing, \"I will take command of this ship.\"  \"No apologies are necessary,\" replied Mrs. Clifford. \"I should be very glad to watch your proceedings. Is it possible, Miss Percival, that you are capable of guiding a vessel across the Atlantic?\"  \"I have often tried it,\" said Miss Percival, going on board; \"but we sometimes have a shipwreck.\"  \"Emily,\" said she, \"you may heave the log.\" So Emily rose, and taking a large spool of crochet-cotton which Miss Percival gave her, held it above her head, turning it slowly, till a tatting shuttle, which was fastened at the end of the thread, fell to the ground. This was supposed to be the \"log;\" and Octavia, with one or two other girls, pretended to tug with much force in order to draw it in, for the ship was going so fast that the friction against the cord was very great. Knots had been made in the cotton, over which Emily ran her quick fingers.  \"Ten knots an hour,\" said she.  \"Very good speed,\" returned the captain. \"I do not think we shall be able to take an observation to-day, as it is rather cloudy.\"  Sailors \"take observations\" at noon, if the sun is out, by means of a sextant, with which they measure the distance from the sun to the southern horizon. In this way the captain can tell the exact latitude of the ship; but Miss Percival made believe there was a storm coming up; so it was not possible to take an observation.  \"It is two bells,\" said she: \"the wind is out; there will be a fearful storm. I would advise the passengers to turn into their berths.\"  The children lay down upon the floor. \"There, there,\" said Miriam Lake, who was playing Jennie Holiday; \"my poor little kitty is just as seasick! Her head keeps going round and round.\"  \"_My_ head has did it too,\" chimed in Katie, rolling herself into a ball; \"it keeps yocking yound and yound.\"  \"I pitch about so in my berth,\" said Octavia, who was Rollo, \"that next thing I shall be out on the floor. Hark! How the water is pouring in! I'm afraid the ship has sprung a leak; and if it has I must call the chambermaid.\"  Mrs. Clifford, who stood looking on, was quite amused at the idea of calling the chambermaid to stop a leak in the ship.  \"Man the pumps!\" said the captain. The girls tugged away at a pole in one end of the wagon, moving it up and down like a churn-dash.  \"I do hope this wind will go down,\" sighed Emily.  \"Well, it will,\" said simple Flyaway; \"I _hear_ it going.\"  \"It is head wind and a heavy sea,\" remarked the captain; \"but never fear; we shall weather the storm. We are now on the southern coast of Ireland. I don't think,\" added she, in a different tone, \"it is best to be shipwrecked, children--do you? We will hurry into Liverpool, and then I think it likely your little visitors may enjoy keeping house with your dolls, or having a nice swing.\"  \"I wish I could eat something,\" said Dotty, with a solemn face; \"but I'm too sick.\"  \"So'm I,\" groaned Flyaway. \"I couldn't eat noffin'--'cept cake.\"  \"If you are in such a condition as that,\" said the captain, \"it is certainly high time we landed. And here comes a pilot boat with a signal flying. We will take the pilot on board,\" added she; drawing in another little girl. \"And look! here we are now in Liverpool.\"  \"We must go to the Adelphi,\" said Octavia; \"that is where Rollo went, and found his father, and mother, and Thannie. But the kitten didn't ever get there--did it, Miss Percival?\"  The voyage being ended, and with it the fearful seasickness, the children went to swinging, with their teacher to push them.  \"Miss Percival,\" said aunt Maria, shaking hands with that excellent young lady, \"I wish you joy of your noble employment. It is a blessed thing to be able to give so much pleasure to these dear little children.\"  \"So it seems to me,\" replied Miss Percival. \"They are always grateful, too, for every little kindness.\"  \"They look very good and obedient,\" said Mrs. Clifford, in a low voice.  \"So they are. Sometimes I think they are better than children who have eyes; perhaps because they cannot see to get into so much mischief,\" added Miss Percival, pinching Emily's cheek.  \"Aunt 'Ria,\" said Dotty, in raptures, \"_don't_ they have good times here?\"  \"Yelly good times,\" said little Flyaway, clutching at her mother's dress. \"Mamma, I wish _I_ was blind-eyed, too.\"  \"You, my darling baby! Mother hopes that will never be. But if you cannot be blind-eyed yourself, perhaps you may make some of these little ones happy. Is there anything you would like to give away?\"  Flyaway winked slowly, trying to think what she had at home that she no longer wished to keep.  \"Yes, mamma,\" said she at last, with a smile of satisfaction, \"I've got a old hat.\"  \"O, fie, Katie! I dare say you would be very glad to part with that, for I remember you cried the other day when I asked you to wear it. Your old hat would not be a pretty present.\"  \"Then I can't fink of noffin' else,\" said Katie, shaking her head; at the same time having a guilty recollection of several beautiful toys, and \"'most a hunnerd bushels of canny;\" that is to say, a small box of confectionery her uncle Edward had given her.  Mrs. Clifford had observed of late that her little daughter was not as generous as she could wish. Both Katie and Dotty were peculiarly liable to become selfish, as they were much petted at home, and had no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10320"],["title","Dotty Dimple at Play (#3)"],["body","brothers or sisters with whom to share their treasures. Mrs. Clifford did not insist upon Katie's making any sacrifice. The little one did not pity the blind children at all. They seemed so happy that she almost envied them. So did Miss Dimple. It was not, after all, very grievous to be blind, she thought, if one could live at this Institute and have such nice plays.  \"Aunt 'Ria thinks I ought to give them something, I s'pose. When I get home I mean to ask mamma and grandma to dress a beautiful doll, and I'll send it to Emily. She'll keep it to remember me by; and it won't cost any of _my_ money if papa buys the head.\"  \"Good by, Emily,\" said she, as she parted from her. \"I hope there won't any more bad things happen to you.\"  \"But I s'pose there will,\" replied Emily, cheerfully.  Mr. Parlin and Horace were waiting in the hall, and the latter was impatiently watching the tall clock. They had been in the greenhouse, looking at the flowers, and in the shop, where the blind boys learn to make brooms and brushes.  \"Well, ladies, are you ready to go?\" asked Mr. Parlin, taking Flyaway by the hand.  \"Yes, we ladies is ready,\" replied she. So this was the end of their visit at the Institute.  After they had gone away, the little blind girls said to one another,--  \"What nice children those are! Which is the prettiest, Alice or Katie?\"  For they always spoke of people and things exactly as if they could see them.     CHAPTER IV.  A SPOILED DINNER.   Next morning, Dotty Dimple and her father started for Maine. Flyaway did not like this at all. Her cousin had been so pleasant and so entertaining that she wished to keep her always.  \"What _for_ you can't stay, Dotty Dimpwil?\"  \"O,\" said Dotty, tearing herself away from the little clinging arms, \"I must go home and get ready for Christmas.\"  \"No, you musser,\" persisted Katie; \"we've got a Santa Claw in _our_ chimley; you musser go home.\"  \"It isn't for Santa Claus at all, darling it is for my papa and mamma's wedding. To stand up, so they can be married over again. Now kiss me, and let me go.\"  \"Her's goin' home to Kismus pie,\" remarked Katie, as she took her mournful way with her mamma to the house where they were visiting. She did not know what a wedding might be, but was sure it had pies in it.  \"There goes a right smart little girl,\" said Horace, with a sweep of his thumb towards the Cleveland cars. \"If it wasn't for Prudy, I should like her better than any other cousin I have in the world.\"  \"She is an engaging child,\" replied his mother, \"and really seems to be outgrowing her naughty ways.\"  Thus, you see, Dotty Dimple, in coming away from Indiana, had left in the minds of her friends only \"golden opinions.\" Perhaps she was rather overrated. Everything had gone well with her during her visit; why should she not be pleasant and happy? I am inclined to think there was the same old naughtiness in her heart, only just now it was asleep. We shall see.  Nothing remarkable occurred on the homeward journey, except that Mr. Parlin bought some gold-fishes in Boston, and carried them home as a present to Mrs. Read. They travelled one night in a sleeping-car, and by that means reached Portland a day earlier than they were expected.  Dotty hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry for this. There was a great deal to be said on both sides of the question. She had anticipated the pleasure of being met at the depot by Susy and Prudy, and now that was not to be thought of; but it would be delightful to give the family a surprise. On the whole, she was very well satisfied.  As they drove up to the new home, however, what was their astonishment to find it closed! There was not even a window open, or any other sign that the house was inhabited. Dotty ran to every door, and shook it.  \"Why, papa, papa, do you s'pose there's anybody dead?\"  \"The probability is, Alice, that they have gone away. I will run over to Mrs. Prosser's, and see if she knows anything about it.\"  Mrs. Prosser was the nearest neighbor on the left. Her little daughter came to the door in tears, having hurt herself against a trunk in the hall.  \"Miss Carrie,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"can you tell me where Mrs. Parlin and the rest of the family are gone?\"  \"Yes, Caddy Prosser, the house is shut up,\" added Dotty, \"and I'm afraid they're dead.\"  \"I don't know where they're gone, nor anything,\" sobbed Carrie. \"I didn't know the trunk was in the entry, and I came so fast I fell right over it.\"  \"I am very sorry you are hurt,\" said Mr. Parlin. \"Is your mother at home?\"  \"No, sir, she isn't; her trunk came, but she didn't.\"  There was no information to be obtained at the Prossers'; so Mr. Parlin went to Mr. Lawrence's, the nearest neighbor on the right, making the same inquiries; but all he learned was, that a carriage had been seen standing at Mr. Parlin's door; who had gone away in it nobody could tell.  Dotty paced the pavement with restless steps, her mind agitated by a thousand wild fancies: Grandma Read never went anywhere; perhaps she was locked up in the house, and Zip too. Norah was at Cape Elizabeth; she had walked out to see her friend Bridget, the girl with red hair; and, just as likely as not, she didn't ever mean to come back again. Mother, and Susy, and Prudy had gone to Willowbrook, to grandpa Parlin's--of course they had,--and left grandma Bead all alone in the house, with nothing to eat. How strange! How unkind!  \"Grandma!\" she called out under Mrs. Read's window.  There was no answer. Dotty fancied the white curtain moved just a little; but that was because a fly was balancing himself on its folds. Grandma was not there, or, if she was, she must be very sound asleep. O, dear, dear! And here were Dotty and her father come home a day earlier than they were expected; and instead of giving the family a joyful surprise, they had a surprise themselves, only not a joyful one, by any means. How impolite it was in everybody, how unkind, to go away! At first, Dotty had been alarmed; but now her indignation got the better of her fears. When she _did_ see Prudy again,--the sister who pretended to love her so much,--she wouldn't take the presents out of her trunk for ever so long, just to tease the naughty girl!  Meanwhile her father did not appear to be at all disturbed.  \"Perhaps they have gone to the Islands, or somewhere else not far away, to spend the day. It is now nearly two o'clock. You may go to the Preble House with me, and take-your dinner, and then I will unlock the house, and find some one to stay with you till night. Would you like that? Or would you prefer to go at once to your aunt Eastman's? You may have your choice.\"  Dotty reflected about half a minute. \"I will go to aunt Eastman's, if you please, papa.\"  This appeared to her decidedly the most dignified course. She would go to aunt Eastman's, and she would not be in the least haste about coming back again. She would teach her sisters, especially Prudy, that it is best to be hospitable towards one's friends when they have been away on a long journey. Her anger may seem very absurd; but you must remember, little friends, that Dotty Dimple had now become a travelled young lady; she had seen the world, and her self-esteem had grown every day she had been away. Her heart was all aglow with love towards the dear ones at home, and it was very chilling to find the door locked in her face. She did not stop to reflect that no unkindness had been intended.  As they drove to aunt Eastman's, her father observed that her bright little face was very downcast, but supposed her sadness arose from the disappointment. There are depths of foolishness in children's hearts which even their parents cannot fathom.  Strange to say, neither Mr. Parlin nor Dotty had thought that the family might be visiting at Mr. Eastman's; but such was the case. It was Johnny's birthday, and his father had sent the carriage into the city that morning for Mrs. Parlin, grandma Read, and the children. As for Norah, Dotty was right with regard to her; she _had_ walked out to the Cape to see the auburn-haired Bridget.  \"I'm glad Johnny was born to-day instead of to-morrow,\" said Prudy, \"for to-morrow we wouldn't go out of the house for anything, auntie.\"  \"I can seem to see cousin Dimple,\" said Percy; \"she'll carry her head higher than ever.\"  Prudy cast upon the youth as strong a look of disapproval as her gentle face could express.  \"Percy, you mustn't talk so about Dotty. She is my sister. She isn't so very proud; but if I was as handsome as she is, I should be proud too.\"  \"O, no; she is very meek--Dimple is; just like a little lamb. Don't you remember that verse she used to repeat?--  'But, chillens, you should never let   Your naughty _ankles_ rise; Your little hands were never made   To tear each uzzer's eyes--out.'\"  \"If she's cross, it's because you and Johnny tease her so,\" said Prudy. \"I think it's a shame.\"  Percy only laughed. He and Prudy were sitting in the doorway, arranging bouquets for the dinner-table. Susy joined them, bearing in her hands some dahlias and tuberoses.  \"Why, Prudy,\" said she, \"what makes your face all aflame?\"  \"She has been fighting for your little dove of a sister,\" replied Percy; \"the one that went West to finish her education.\"  This speech only deepened the color in Prudy's face, though she tried hard to subdue her anger, and closed her lips with the firm resolve not to open them again till she could speak pleasantly.  \"Look!\" exclaimed Percy; \"there's a carriage turning the corner. Why, it's Dimple herself and uncle Edward!\"  \"It can't be!\"  \"It is!\"  Both little girls ran to the gate.  \"O, father! O, Dotty! Why, when did you get home?\"  By this time Mrs. Parlin had come out: also Mrs. Eastman and Johnny. Everybody was as surprised and delighted as possible; and even Miss Dimple, sitting in state in the coach, was perfectly satisfied, and condescended to alight, instead of riding through the carriage gateway.  \"O, Dotty Dimple, I'm so glad to see you!\""]]]
