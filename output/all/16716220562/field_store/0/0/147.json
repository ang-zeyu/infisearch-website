Indeed, who has ever seen the like of them or of my wonderful vegetable garden in the castle-grounds? There has never been such an abundance of cauliflower and peas, such rows of bean-poles, such salad-beds. What a delight their care was to me. Such a garden will never be seen again. I have to sigh every time when I think that anything so beautiful should be forever lost.\"  \"But that can't be helped,\" Uncle Philip answered. \"There is one great advantage you have here. Nobody can possibly disturb your Sunday peace. You need not throw up your hands and exclaim: 'Falcon is the worst of all.'\"  \"Oh, Mr. Falcon, so you still remember,\" Apollonie exclaimed. \"Yes, I must admit that the three young gentlemen have trampled down many a young plant of mine. Still I should not mind such a thing if I only had the care of the garden back again, but it doesn't even exist any more. Mr. Trius's only harvest is hay and apples, and that is all he wants apparently, because he has thrown everything else out. Please do not think that I am swimming in pure peace here because no boys are stamping down my garden. Oh, no! It is very difficult to read my Sunday psalm in peace when I am given such a bitter soup of grief to swallow as I got yesterday. It keeps on burning me, and still I have to swallow it.\"  \"You probably mean the Knippel-soup from yesterday?\" Kurt interrupted, full of lively interest. Loneli had only just told him that things had gone very badly the day before when she had returned home all soiled from her fall and with the empty milk-bottle. So he felt more indignant than before and had immediately interpreted Apollonie's hint. \"I want to tell you, Apollonie, that it was not Loneli's fault in the least. Those rascals enjoy sticking out their feet and seeing people tumble over them.\"  \"The child can't possibly have behaved properly, Kurt, or the district attorney's sons would not have teased her.\"  \"I'll fetch Bruno right away and he'll prove to you that Loneli did nothing whatever. He saw it,\" Kurt cried eagerly with the intention of fetching his brother, who had already started up the hill. But his mother detained him. It was not her wish to fan Bruno's rage afresh by the discovery that Loneli had been considered guilty. She therefore narrated the incident to Apollonie just as Bruno had reported it.  Loneli's blue eyes glistened with joy when the story was told according to the truth. She knew that the words spoken by the rector's widow had great weight with her grandmother.  \"Can you see now that it was not Loneli's fault?\" Kurt cried out as soon as his mother had finished.  \"Yes, I see it and I am happy that it is so,\" said Apollonie. \"How could one have suspected that boys who had a good education should want to hurt others without cause? The young Falcon would never have done such a thing, I know that. He only ran into the vegetable garden because his two friends were chasing him from both sides.\"  Uncle Philip laughed: \"I am glad you are so just to me, Mrs. Apollonie. Even when you scolded the Falcon properly for tramping down your plants, you knew that it was not in maliciousness he did it but in self-defence. I am afraid it is time to go now\" and with these words he heartily shook his old acquaintance by the hand. The two little ones, who had never left his side, were ready immediately to strike out once more.  They soon reached the hill and the castle, which was bathed in the soft evening light, lay openly before them. A hushed silence reigned about the gray building and the old pine trees under the tower, whose branches lay trailing on the ground. For years no human hand had touched them. Where the blooming garden had been wild bushes and weeds covered the ground.  The mother and uncle, settling down on a tree-trunk, looked in silence towards the castle, while the children were hunting for strawberries on the sunny incline.  \"How terribly deserted and lonely it all looks,\" Uncle Philip said after a while. \"Let us go back. When the sun is gone, it will get more dreary still.\"  \"Don't you notice anything, Philip?\" asked his sister, taken up with her own thoughts. \"Can you see that all the shutters are closed except those on the tower balcony? Don't you remember who used to live there?\"  \"Certainly I do. Mad Bruno used to live there,\" the brother answered. \"As his rooms alone seem to be kept in order, he might come back?\"  \"Why, he'll never come back,\" Uncle Philip exclaimed. \"You know that we heard ages ago that he is an entirely broken man and that he lay deadly sick in Malaga. Mr. Tillman, who went to Spain, must certainly know about it. Restless Baron Bruno has probably found his last resting-place long ago. Why should you look for him here?\"  \"I only think that in that case a new owner of the place would have turned up by now,\" was his sister's opinion. \"Two young members of the family, the children of Salo and Eleanor, are still alive. I wonder where these children are. They would be the sole owners after their uncle's death.\"  \"They have long ago been disinherited,\" the brother exclaimed. \"I do not know where they are, but I have an idea on that subject. I shall tell you about it to-night when we are alone. Here you are so absent-minded. You throw worried looks in all directions as if you were afraid that this perfectly solid meadow were a dangerous pond into which your little brood might fall and lose their lives.\"  The children had scattered in all directions. Bruno had gone far to one side and was deeply immersed in a little book he had taken with him. Mea had discovered the most beautiful forget-me-nots she had ever seen in all her life, which grew in large masses beside the gurgling mountain stream. Beside herself with transport, she flew from place to place where the small blue flowers sparkled, for she wanted to pick them all.  Kurt had climbed a tree and from the highest branch he could reach was searchingly studying the castle, as if something special was to be discovered there. Mäzli, having discovered some strawberries, had pulled Lippo along with her. She wanted him to pick those she had found while she hunted for more in the meantime. The mother was very busy keeping an eye on them all. Kurt might become too daring in his climbing feats. Mäzli might run away too far and Lippo might put his strawberries into his trousers-pocket as he had done once already, and cause great harm to his little Sunday suit.  \"You fuss and worry too much about the children,\" Uncle Philip said. \"Just let the children simply grow, saying to them once in a while, 'If you don't behave, you'll be locked up.'\"  \"Yes, that certainly sounds simple,\" said his sister. \"It is a pity you have no brood of your own to bring up, Philip, as lively as mine, and each child entirely different from the others, so that one has to be urged to a thing that another has to be kept from. I get the cares without looking for them. A new great worry has come to me to-day, which even you won't be able to just push aside.\"  Mrs. Maxa told her brother now about the morning's interview with the wife of the district attorney. She told him of the problem she had with Bruno's further education, because the lessons he had been having from the Rector would end in the fall, and of her firm intention of keeping him from living together with his two present comrades. The three had never yet come together without bringing as a result some mean deed on one side and an explosion of rage on the other.  \"Don't you think, Philip, that it will be a great care for me to think that the three are living under one roof? Don't you think so yourself?\" Mrs. Maxa concluded.  \"Oh, Maxa, that is an old story. There have been boys at all times who fought together and then made peace again.\"  \"Philip, that does not console me,\" the sister answered. \"That has never been Bruno's way at all. He never fights that way. But it is hard to tell what he might do in a fit of anger at some injustice or meanness, and that is what frightens me so.\"  \"His godfather of the same name has probably passed that on to him. Nobody more than you, Maxa, has always tried to wash him clean and excuse him for all his deeds of anger. In your indestructible admiration ...\"  Uncle Philip got no further, as all the children now came running toward them. The two little ones both tried hard to put the biggest strawberries they had found into the mouths of their mother and uncle. Mea could not hold her magnificent bunch of forget-me-nots near enough to their eyes to be admired. The two older boys had approached, too, as they had an announcement to make. The sun had gone down behind the mountain, so they had remembered that it was time to go home.  Mother and uncle rose from their seats and the whole group started down the mountainside. The two little ones were gaily trotting beside the uncle, bursting into wild shouting now and then, for he made such leaps that they flew high into the air sometimes. He held them so firmly, however, that they always reached the ground safely.  At the entrance to the house Kurt had a brilliant idea. \"Oh, mother,\" he called out excitedly over the prospect, \"tonight we must have the story of the Wallerstätten family. It will fit so well because we were able to see the castle today, with all its gables, embrasures and battlements.\"  But the mother answered: \"I am sorry to say we can't. Uncle is here today, and as he has to leave early tomorrow morning, I have to talk to him tonight. You have to go to bed early, otherwise you will be too tired to get up tomorrow after your long walk.\"  \"Oh, what a shame, what a shame!\" Kurt lamented. He was still hoping that he would find out something in the story about the ghost of Wildenstein, despite the fact that one could not really believe in him. Sitting on the tree that afternoon, he had been lost in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10142"],["title","Maezli: A Story of the Swiss Valleys (#6)"],["body","as to where the ghost might have appeared.  When the mother went to Mäzli's bed that night to say prayers with her she found her still very much excited, as usual, by the happenings of the day. She always found it difficult to quiet the little girl, but to-day she seemed filled by very vivid impressions. Now that everything was still, they seemed to come back to her.  Mäzli sat straight up in her bed with shining eyes as soon as her mother appeared. \"Why was the Knippel-soup allowed to spoil Apollonie's Sunday peace?\" she cried out.  \"Where have you heard that, Mäzli?\" the mother said, quite frightened. She already saw the moment before her when Mäzli would tell the district attorney's wife that new appellation. \"You must never use that expression any more, Mäzli. You see, nobody would be able to know what you mean. Kurt invented it apparently when Apollonie spoke about having so much to swallow. He should not have said it. Do you understand, Mäzli, that you must not say it any more?\"  \"Yes, but why is anyone allowed to spoil Apollonie's Sunday peace?\" Mäzli persevered. Apollonie was her special friend, whom she wanted to keep from harm.  \"No one should do it, Mäzli,\" the mother replied. It is wrong to spoil anybody's Sunday peace and no one should do it.\"  \"But our good God should quickly call down, 'Don't do it, don't do it!' Then they would know that they were not allowed,\" was Mäzli's opinion.  \"He does it, Mäzli! He does it every time anybody does wrong,\" said the mother, \"for the evil-doer always hears such a voice that calls out to him: 'Don't do it, don't do it!' But sometimes he does it in spite of the voice. Even young children like you, Mäzli, hear the voice when they feel like doing wrong, and they do wrong just the same.\"  \"I only wonder why God does not punish them right away; He ought to do that,\" Mäzli eagerly replied.  \"But He does,\" said the mother. As soon as anybody has done wrong, he feels a great weight on his heart so that he keeps on thinking, 'I wish I hadn't done it!' Then our good God is good and merciful to him and does not punish him further. He gives him plenty of time to come to Him and tell Him how sorry he is to have done wrong. God gives him the chance to beg His pardon. But if he does not do that, he is sure to be punished so that he will do more and more evil and become more terribly unhappy all the time.\"  \"I'll look out, too, now if I can hear the voice,\" was Mäzli's resolution.  \"The chief thing is to follow the voice, Mäzli,\" said the mother. \"But we must be quiet now. Say your prayers, darling, then you will soon go to sleep.\"  Mäzli said her little prayer very devoutly. As there was nothing more to trouble her, she lay down and was half asleep as soon as her mother closed the door behind her.  She was still expected at four other little beds. Every one of the children had a problem to bring to her, but there was so little time left to-day that they had to be put off till to-morrow. In fact, they were all glad to make a little sacrifice for their beloved uncle. When she came back into the room, she found him hurrying impatiently up and down. He could hardly wait to make his sister the announcement to which he had already referred several times.  \"Are you coming at last?\" he called to her. \"Are you not a bit curious what present I have brought you?\"  \"Oh, Philip, I am sure it can only be a joke,\" Mrs. Maxa replied. \"I should love to know what you meant when you spoke of the children of Wallerstätten.\"  \"It happens to be one and the same thing,\" the brother replied. \"Come here now and sit down beside me and get your mending-basket right away so that you won't have to jump up again. I know you. You will probably run off two or three times to the children.\"  \"No, Philip, to-day is Sunday and I won't mend. The children are all sleeping peacefully, so please tell me about it.\"  Uncle Philip sat down quietly beside his sister and began: \"As surely as I am now sitting here beside you, Maxa, so surely young Leonore of Wallerstätten was sitting beside me three days ago. I am really as sure as anything that it was Leonore's child. She is only an hour's distance away from you and is probably going to stay in this neighborhood for a few weeks. I wanted to bring you this news as a present.\"  Mrs. Maxa first could not say a word from astonishment.  \"Are you quite sure, Philip?\" she asked, wishing for an affirmation. \"How could you become so sure that the child you saw was Leonore's little daughter?\"  \"First of all, because nobody who has known Leonore can ever forget what she looked like. The child is exactly like her and looks at one just the way Leonore used to do. Secondly, the child's name was Leonore, too. Thirdly, she had the same brown curls rippling down her shoulders that her mother had, and she spoke with a voice as soft and charming. For the fifth and sixth reasons, because only Leonore could have such a child, for there could not be two people like her in the whole world.\" Uncle Philip had grown very warm during these ardent proofs.  \"Please tell me exactly where and how you saw the child,\" the sister urged.  So the brother related how he had come back three days ago from a trip and, arriving in town, had given orders in the hotel for a carriage to be brought round to take him back to Sils that same evening. The host had then informed him that two ladies had just ordered a carriage to take them to the same destination. He thought that as long as they had seemed to be strangers and were anxious to know more about the road, they would be very glad to have a companion who was going the same way. So the host had made all necessary arrangements, as there were no objections to the plan on either side. When the carriage had driven up, he had seen that the ladies had with them a little daughter who was to occupy the back-seat of the carriage.  \"This daughter, as I thought, was Leonore's child. I am as certain of that as of my relation with you,\" the brother concluded.  Mrs. Maxa was filled with great excitement.  Could one of the children for whom she had vainly longed and inquired for such long years be really so near her? Would she be able to see her? Who were the ladies to whom she belonged?  To all her various questions the brother could only answer that the ladies with whom Leonore was living came from the neighborhood of Hannover. They had taken a little villa in Sils on the mountain, which they had seen advertised for the summer months. He had shown the ladies his estate in Sils and had offered to serve them in whatever way they wished. Then they had taken leave.  Leonore's name had wakened so many happy memories of her beautiful childhood and youth in Mrs. Maxa that she began to revive those times with her brother and tirelessly talked of the days they had spent there together with her unforgettable friend Leonore and her two cousins. The brother seemed just as ready to indulge in those delightful memories as she was, and whenever she ceased, he began again to talk of all the unusual happenings and exploits that had taken place with their dear friends.  \"Do you know, Maxa, I think we had much better playmates than your children have,\" he said finally. \"If Bruno beats his comrades, I like it better than if he acted as they do.\"  Brother and sister had not talked so far into the night for a long time. Nevertheless, Mrs. Maxa could not get to sleep for hours afterwards. Leonore's image with the long, brown curls and the winning expression in her eyes woke her lively desire to see the child that resembled her so much.    CHAPTER III  CASTLE WILDENSTEIN  When Mäzli and Lippo were neatly washed and dressed the next morning, they came downstairs to the living-room chattering in the most lively manner. Mäzli was just telling Lippo her plans for the afternoon when he should be back from school. The mother, after attending to some task, followed the children, who were standing around the piano.  As soon as she entered, Kurt broke out into a frightened cry. \"Oh, mother, we have forgotten all about the poor people whose houses burnt down and we were supposed to take the things with us this morning.\"  \"Yes, the teacher told us twice that we must not forget it,\" Lippo complained, \"but I didn't forget it.\"  \"Don't worry, children, I have attended to it,\" said the mother. \"Kathy has just gone to the school with a basket full of things. It was too heavy for you to carry.\"  \"Oh, how nice and convenient it is to have a mother,\" Kurt said quite relieved.  The mother sat down at the piano.  \"Come, let us sing our morning song, now,\" she said. \"We can't wait for uncle, because he might come back too late from his walk.\" Opening the book, she began to sing \"The golden sun--with joy and fun.\"  The children taking up the melody sang it briskly, for they knew it well. Mäzli was singing full of zeal, too, and wherever she had forgotten the words, she did not stop, but made up some of her own.  Two stanzas had been sung when Kurt said, \"We must stop now or it will get too late. After breakfast it is time to go to school.\"  The mother, assenting, rose and went to the table to fill their cups.  But Lippo broke into a loud wail. Pulling his mother back, he cried, \"Don't go! Please don't! We must finish it. We have to finish it. Come back, mother, come back.\"  She tried to loosen the grip of the boy's firm little fingers on her dress and to calm him, but she did not succeed, and he kept on crying louder and louder: \"Come back! You said one must not leave anything half done. We didn't finish the song and we must do it.\"  Kurt now began to cry out, too: \"Let go your pincher-claws--we'll get to school late.\"  Mea's voice joined them with loud exclamation against Lippo, who was trying hard to pull his mother back, groaning loudly all the time.  Uncle Philip entered at this moment.  \"What on earth is going on here?\" he cried loudly into the confusion.  Everybody began to explain.  Lippo let go his grip"]]]
