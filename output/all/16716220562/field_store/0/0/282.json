Can you steer? Guess I'd better row.\"  \"No, you won't,\" was the very resolute reply, as Ford regained his seat and his oars. \"I sha'n't catch any more crabs of that sort. I'm a little out of practice, that's all.\"  \"I should say you were, a little. Well, it won't hurt you. 'Tisn't much of a pull.\"  Ford would have pulled it now if he had blistered all the skin off his hands in doing so; and he did very creditable work for some minutes, among the turns and windings of the narrow inlet.  \"Here we are,\" shouted Dabney at last. \"We are in the inlet yet, but it widens out into the bay.\"  \"That's the bay, out yonder?\"  \"Yes; and the island between that and the ocean's no better'n a mere bar of sand.\"  \"How d'you get past it?\"  \"Right across there, almost in a straight line. We'll run it next week in Ham's yacht. Splendid weak-fishing right in the mouth of that inlet, on the ocean side.\"  \"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Ford, \"I'm in for that. Is the bay deep?\"  \"Not very,\" replied Dabney; \"but it gets pretty rough sometimes.\"  Ford was getting pretty red in the face just then, with his unaccustomed exercise; and his friend added,--  \"You needn't pull so hard: we're almost there. Hullo! if there isn't Dick Lee, in his dry-goods box. That boat'll drown him some day, and his dad too. But just see him pull in crabs!\"  Ford came near \"catching\" one more as he tried to turn around for the look proposed, exclaiming,--  \"Dab, let's get to work as quick as we can. They might go away.\"  \"Might fly?\"  \"No; but don't they go and come?\"  \"Well, you go and drop the grapnel over the bows, and we'll see 'em come in pretty quick.\"  The grapnel, or little anchor, was thrown over quickly enough; and the two boys were in such an eager haste that they had hardly a word to say to Dick, though he was now but a few rods away.  Now, it happened that when Ford and Dab came down to the water that morning, each of them had brought a load. The former had only a neat little japanned tin box, about as big as his head; and the latter, besides his oars, carried a seemingly pretty heavy basket.  \"Lots of lunch, I should say,\" had been Ford's mental comment; but he had not thought it wise to ask questions.  \"Plenty of lunch in that box,\" thought Dab at the same moment, but only as a matter of course.  And they were both wrong. Lunch was the one thing they had both forgotten.  But the box and the basket.  Ford Foster came out, of his own accord, with the secret of the box; for he now took a little key out of his pocket, and unlocked it with an air of--  \"Look at this, will you?\"  Dab Kinzer looked, and was very sure he had never before seen quite such an assortment of brand-new fish-hooks, of many sorts and sizes, and of fish-lines which looked as if they had thus far spent their lives on dry land.  \"Tip-top,\" he remarked. \"I see a lot of things we can use one of these days, but there isn't time to go over 'em now. Let's go for the crabs. What made you bring your box along?\"  \"Oh!\" replied Ford, \"I left my rods at home, both of 'em. You don't s'pose I'd go for crabs with a rod, do you? But you can take your pick of hooks and lines.\"  \"Crabs? Hooks and lines?\"  \"Why, yes. You don't mean to scoop 'em up in that landing-net, do you?\"  Dab looked at his friend for a moment in blank amazement, and then the truth broke upon him for the first time.  \"Oh, I see! You never caught any crabs. Well, just you lock up your jewellery-box, and I'll show you.\"  It was not easy for Dab to keep from laughing in Ford Foster's face; but his mother had not given him so many lessons in good-breeding for nothing, and Ford was permitted to close his ambitious \"casket\" without any worse annoyance than his own wounded pride gave him.  But now came out the secret of the basket.  The cover was jerked off; and nothing was revealed but a varied assortment of clams, large and small, but mostly of good size,--tough old customers, that no amount of roasting or boiling would ever have prepared for human eating.  \"What are they for,--bait?\"  \"Yes, bait, weight, and all.\"  \"How's that?\"  Dabney's reply was to draw from his pocket a couple of long, strong cords, bits of old fishing-lines. He cracked a couple of clams one against the other; tied the fleshy part of one to each of the cords; tied bits of shell on, a foot or so from the ends, for sinkers; handed one cord to Ford, took the other himself, and laid the long-handled scoop-net he had brought with him down between them, saying,--  \"Now we're ready. Drop your clam down to the bottom, and it won't be half a minute before you feel something pull on it. Then you draw it up gently,--steady as you know how. You mustn't jerk the crab loose. You'll get the knack of it in five minutes. It's all knack. There isn't any thing else so stupid as a crab.\"  Ford watched carefully, and obeyed in silence the directions he had received.  In a minute or so more the operation of the scoop-net was called for, and the fun began.  \"You got him!\" exclaimed Ford in a loud whisper, as he saw Dab quickly plunge the net into the water, and then shake out of it into the bottom of the boat a great sprawling \"blue-legged\" crab. \"He's a whopper!\"  \"He'll do for one.\"  \"There's one on mine! I declare, he's let go!\"  \"You jerked the clam away from him. Sink it again. He's mad about it. He'll take right hold again.\"  \"He's pulling now, or it's another one.\"  \"Let him pull. Lift him easy. Long as he thinks he's stealing something, he'll hold on. There he comes,--see him?\"  Ford saw the white flesh of the clam coming slowly up through the water, and he held his breath; for just behind and below it was a sprawling shadowy something that was tugging with all its might at that tough shell-fish.  \"It's an awful big one!\"  \"Shall I scoop him?\"  \"No, indeed: I want to scoop him myself. I saw how you did it.\"  Splash went the net, as the prize came nearer the surface; and Ford began, somewhat excitedly, to shake it all over the bottom of the boat.  \"Why, where's that crab? You don't mean to say he was quick enough to dodge away?\"  \"Quick? well, no, that isn't just the trouble. I forgot to tell you to scoop way under him. You hit him, square, and knocked him ever so far. The water deceives your eyes. Drive the net under him quick, and then lift. I've got one--now just you see how I scoop.\"  Ford felt dreadfully disappointed over the loss of his first crab, but the rapidity with which he caught the \"knack of it\" after that was a great credit to him. He did not miss the next one he pulled up.  It was great fun; but it had its slack moments, and in one of these Dab suddenly exclaimed,--  \"The young black rascal! If he hasn't gone and got a sheep's-head!\"  \"A sheep's-head?\"  They were both staring at the old punt, where Dick Lee was apparently enjoying the most extraordinary good fortune.  \"Yes, that's it. That's why he beats us so badly. They're a sight better'n clams, only you can't always get one. I wonder where he picked up that one.\"  \"But how he does pull 'em in!\"  \"We're doing well enough,\" began Dabney, when suddenly there came a shrill cry of pain from the black boy's punt.  \"He's barefooted,\" shouted Dab, with, it must be confessed, something like a grin; \"and one of the little pirates has pinned him with his nippers.\"  That was the difficulty exactly, and there need not have been any very serious result of such an expression of a crab's bad temper. But Dick Lee was more than ordinarily averse to any thing like physical pain, and the crab which now had him by the toe was a very muscular and vicious specimen of his quarrelsome race.  The first consequence of that vigorous nip was a momentary dance up and down in the punt, accompanied by exclamatory howls from Dick, but not by a word of any sort from the crab.  The next consequence was, that the crab let go; but so at the same instant, did the rotten board in the boat-bottom, upon which Dick Lee had so rashly danced.  It let go of the rest of the boat so suddenly that poor Dick had only time for one tremendous yell, as it let him right down through to his armpits.  The water was perfectly smooth; but the boat was full in an instant, and nearly a bushel of freshly-caught and ill-tempered crabs were manoeuvring in all directions around the woolly head, which was all their late captor could now keep in sight.  \"Up with the grapnel, Ford,\" shouted Dab. \"Take an oar: we'll both row. He can swim like a duck, but he might split his throat.\"  \"Or get scared to death.\"  \"Or those crabs might go for him, and eat him up.\"  \"How he does yell!\"      CHAPTER VII.  A VERY ACCIDENTAL CALL.   At the very moment when the angry crab closed his nippers on the bare big toe of Dick Lee, and his shrill note of discomfort rang across the inlet, the shriller whistle of the engine announced the arrival of the morning train from the city, at the little station in the village.  A moment or so later, a very pretty young lady was standing beside a trunk on the platform, trying to get some information from the flagman.  \"Can you tell me where Mr. Foster lives?\"  \"That's the gimlet-eyed lawyer from New Yark?\"  \"Yes, he's from New York,\" said the young lady, smiling in his face. \"Where does he live?\"  \"He's got the sassiest boy, thin. Is it him as took the Kinzer house?\"  \"I think likely it is. Can you tell me how to get there?\"  \"Thim Kinzers is foine people. The widdy married one of the gurrels to Misther Morris.\"  \"But how can I get to the house?\"  \"Is it there ye're afther goin'?--Hey, Michael, me boy, bring up yer owld rattlethrap, and take the leddy's thrunk. She'll be goin' to the Kinzer place. Sharp, now.\"  \"I should say it was,\" muttered the young lady, as the remains of what had been a carryall were pulled up beside the platform by the skinny skeleton of what might once have been a horse. \"It's a rattletrap.\"  There was no choice, however; for that was the only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10340"],["title","Dab Kinzer: A Story of a Growing Boy (#7)"],["body","conveyance at the station, and the trunk was already whisked in behind the dashboard, and the driver was waiting for her.  He could afford to wait, as it would be some hours before another train would be in.  There was no door to open in that \"carriage.\" It was all door except the top and bottom, and the pretty passenger was neither helped nor hindered in finding her place on the back seat.  If the flagman was more disposed to ask questions than to answer them, Michael said few words of any kind except to his horse. To him, indeed, he kept up a constant stream of encouraging remarks, the greatest part of which would have been difficult for an ordinary hearer to understand.  Very likely the horse knew what they meant; for he came very near breaking from a limp into a trot several times, under the stimulus of all that clucking and \"G'lang, now!\"  The distance was by no means great, and Michael seemed to know the way perfectly. At least he answered, \"Yes'm, indade,\" to several inquiries from his passenger, and she was compelled to be satisfied with that.  \"What a big house it is! And painters at work on it too,\" she exclaimed, just as Michael added a vigorous jerk of the reins to the \"Whoa!\" with which he stopped his nag in front of an open gate.  \"Are you sure this is the place?\"  \"Yes'm; fifty cints, mum.\"  By the time the trunk was out of the carriage and swung inside of the gate, the young lady had followed; but for some reason Michael at once sprang back to his place, and whipped up his limping steed. It may have been from the fear of being asked to take that trunk into the house, for it was not a small one. The young lady stood for a moment irresolute, and then left it where it was, and walked on up to the house.  No bell; no knocker. The workmen had not reached that part of their improvements yet. But the door was open; and a very neatly furnished parlor at the left of the hall seemed to say, \"Come right in, please;\" and in she went.  Such an arrival could not possibly have escaped the notice of the inmates of the house; and, as the young lady from the railway came in at the front, another and a very different-looking lady marched through to the parlor from the rear.  Each one would have been a puzzle to the other, if the elder of the two had not been Mrs. Kinzer, and the widow had never been very much puzzled in all her life. At all events, she put out her hand, with a cordial smile, saying,--  \"Miss Foster, is it not? I am Mrs. Kinzer. How could he have made such a mistake?\"  \"Yes, Miss Annie Foster. But do please explain Where am I? and how do you know me?\"  The widow laughed cheerily.  \"How do I know you, my dear? Why, you resemble your mother almost as much as your brother Ford resembles his father. You are only one door from home here, and I'll have your trunk taken right over to the house. Please sit down a moment. Ah! my daughter Samantha, Miss Foster. Excuse me a moment, while I call one of the men.\"  By the time their mother was fairly out of the room, however, Keziah and Pamela were also in it; and Annie thought she had rarely seen three girls whose appearance testified so strongly to the healthiness of the place they lived in.  The flagman's questions and Annie's answers were related quickly enough, and the cause of Michael's blunder was plain at once.  The parlor rang again with peals of laughter; for Dab Kinzer's sisters were ready at any time to look at the funny side of things, and their accidental guest saw no reason for not joining them.  \"Your brother Ford is on the bay, crabbing with our Dabney,\" remarked Samantha, as the widow returned. But Annie's eyes had been furtively watching her baggage through the window, and saw it swinging upon a broad, red-shirted pair of shoulders, just then; and, before she could bring her mind to bear upon the crab question, Keziah Kinzer exclaimed,--  \"If there isn't Mrs. Foster, coming through the garden gate!\"  \"My mother!\" and Annie was up and out of the parlor in a twinkling, followed by all the ladies of the Kinzer family. It was really quite a procession.  Now, if Mrs. Foster was in any degree surprised by her daughter's sudden appearance, or by her getting to the Kinzer house first instead of to her own, it was a curious fact that she did not say so by a word or a look.  Not a breath of it. But, for all the thorough-bred self-control of the city lady, Mrs. Kinzer knew perfectly well there was something odd and unexpected about it all. If Samantha had noticed this fact, there might have been some questions asked possibly; but one of the widow's most rigid rules in life was to \"mind her own business.\"  The girls, indeed, were quite jubilant over an occurrence which made them at once so well acquainted with their very attractive new neighbor; and they might have followed her even beyond the gate in the north fence, if it had not been for their mother. All they were allowed to do was to go back to their own parlor, and hold \"a council of war,\" in the course of which Annie Foster was discussed, from her bonnet to her shoes.  Mrs. Foster had been abundantly affectionate in greeting her daughter; but, when once they were alone in the wee sitting-room of the old Kinzer homestead, she put her arms around her, saying,--  \"Now, my darling, tell me what it all means.\"  \"Why, mother, it was partly my mistake, and partly the flagman's and the driver's; and I'm sure Mrs. Kinzer was kind. She knew me before I said a word, by my resemblance to you.\"  \"Oh, I don't mean that! How is it you are here so soon? I thought you meant to make a long visit at your uncle Hart's.\"  \"So I would, mother, if it had not been for those boys.\"  \"Your cousins, Annie?\"  \"Cousins, mother! You never saw such young bears in all your life. They tormented me from morning till night.\"  \"But, Annie, I hope you have not offended\"--  \"Offended, mother? Aunt Maria thinks they're perfect, and so does uncle Joe. They'd let them pull the house down over their heads, you'd think.\"  \"But, Annie, what did they do? and what did you say?\"  \"Do, mother? I couldn't tell you in all day; but when they poured ink over my cuffs and collars, I said I would come home. I had just one pair left white to wear home, and I travelled all night.\"  Poor Mrs. Foster! A cold shudder went over her at the idea of that ink among the spotless contents of her own collar-box.  \"What boys they must be! but, Annie, what did your aunt say?\"  \"Uncle Joe laughed till he cried; and Aunt Maria said, 'Boys will be boys;' and I half believe they were sorry; but that was only a sort of a winding-up, I wouldn't stay there another day.\"  Annie had other things to tell; and, long before she had finished her story, there was no further fault to be found with her for losing her temper. Still her mother said mildly,--  \"I must write to Maria at once, for it won't do to let those boys make trouble between us.\"  Annie looked at her with an expression of face which very plainly said,--  \"Nobody in the wide world could have the heart to quarrel with you.\"      CHAPTER VIII.  A RESCUE, AND A GRAND GOOD TIME.   Dab Kinzer and his friend were prompt enough coming to the rescue of their unfortunate fellow-lubber; but to get him out of the queer wreck he had made of that punt looked like a tough task to both of them, and they said as much.  \"I isn't drownin',\" exclaimed Dick heroically, as the other boat was pulled alongside of him. \"Jest you take your scoop-net, and save dem crabs.\"  \"They won't drown,\" said Ford.  \"But they'll get away,\" said Dab, as he snatched up the scoop. \"Dick's head is perfectly level on that point.\"  The side-boards of the old punt were under water half the time, but the crabs were pretty well penned in. Even a couple of them, that had mistaken Dick's wool for another sheep's-head, were secured without difficulty, in spite of the firmness with which they clung to their prize.  \"What luck he'd been having!\" said Ford.  \"He always does,\" said Dab. \"I say, Dick, how'll I scoop you in?\"  \"Has you done got all de crabs?\"  \"Every pinner of 'em.\"  \"Den you jest wait a minute.\"  Waiting was all that was left them to do, for the shining black face and woolly head disappeared almost instantly.  \"He's sunk,\" exclaimed Ford.  \"There he comes,\" replied Dab: \"he'd swum ashore from here, and not half try. Why, I could swim twice as far as that myself, and he can beat me.\"  \"Could you? I couldn't.\"  That was the first time Dab had heard his city acquaintance make a confession of inability, and he could see a more than usually thoughtful expression on his face. The coolness and skill of Dick Lee, in his hour of disaster, had not been thrown away upon him.  \"If I had my clothes off,\" said Ford, \"I believe I'd try that on.\"  \"Dab Kinzer, you's de bes' feller dar is. But wot'll we do wid de old boat?\" burst out Dick, on coming to the surface.  \"Let the tide carry her in while we're crabbing. She isn't worth mending, but we'll tow her home.\"  \"All right,\" said Dick, as he grasped the gunwale of Dab's boat, and began to climb over.  \"Hold on, Dick.\"  \"I is a-holdin' on.\"  \"I mean, wait a bit. Ain't you wet?\"  \"Of course I's wet.\"  \"Well, then, you stay in there till you get dry It's well you didn't have your new clothes on.\"  \"Ain't I glad 'bout dem!\" enthusiastically ex-claimed the young African. \"Nebber mind dese clo'es. De water on 'em's all good, dry water, like de res' ob de bay.\"  And, so saying, Dick tumbled over in, with a spatter which made Ford Foster tread on two of three crabs in getting away from it. It was not the first time, by many, that Dick Lee had found himself bathing in that bay without any time given him to undress.  And now it was discovered that the shipwrecked crabber had never for one instant lost his hold of the line, to the other end of which was fastened his precious sheep's-head.  They made a regular crabbing crew now,--two to pull up, and one to scoop in; and never had the sprawling game been more plentiful on"]]]
