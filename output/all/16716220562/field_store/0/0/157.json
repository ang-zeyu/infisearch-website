I trow thou drawest better bow than that same coward knave Robin Hood, that dared not show his face here this day.  Say, good fellow, wilt thou join my service?\"  \"Nay, that will I not,\" quoth the stranger roughly. \"I will be mine own, and no man in all merry England shall be my master.\"  \"Then get thee gone, and a murrain seize thee!\" cried the Sheriff, and his voice trembled with anger.  \"And by my faith and troth, I have a good part of a mind to have thee beaten for thine insolence!\" Then he turned upon his heel and strode away.  It was a right motley company that gathered about the noble greenwood tree in Sherwood's depths that same day. A score and more of barefoot friars were there, and some that looked like tinkers, and some that seemed to be sturdy beggars and rustic hinds; and seated upon a mossy couch was one all clad in tattered scarlet, with a patch over one eye; and in his hand he held the golden arrow that was the prize of the great shooting match.  Then, amidst a noise of talking and laughter, he took the patch from off his eye and stripped away the scarlet rags from off his body and showed himself all clothed in fair Lincoln green; and quoth he, \"Easy come these things away, but walnut stain cometh not so speedily from yellow hair.\" Then all laughed louder than before, for it was Robin Hood himself that had won the prize from the Sheriff's very hands.  Then all sat down to the woodland feast and talked among themselves of the merry jest that had been played upon the Sheriff, and of the adventures that had befallen each member of the band in his disguise. But when the feast was done, Robin Hood took Little John apart and said, \"Truly am I vexed in my blood, for I heard the Sheriff say today, 'Thou shootest better than that coward knave Robin Hood, that dared not show his face here this day.'  I would fain let him know who it was who won the golden arrow from out his hand, and also that I am no coward such as he takes me to be.\"  Then Little John said, \"Good master, take thou me and Will Stutely, and we will send yon fat Sheriff news of all this by a messenger such as he doth not expect.\"  That day the Sheriff sat at meat in the great hall of his house at Nottingham Town.  Long tables stood down the hall, at which sat men-at- arms and household servants and good stout villains,[Bond-servants.] in all fourscore and more.  There they talked of the day's shooting as they ate their meat and quaffed their ale. The Sheriff sat at the head of the table upon a raised seat under a canopy, and beside him sat his dame.  \"By my troth,\" said he, \"I did reckon full roundly that that knave Robin Hood would be at the game today.  I did not think that he was such a coward. But who could that saucy knave be who answered me to my beard so bravely? I wonder that I did not have him beaten; but there was something about him that spoke of other things than rags and tatters.\"  Then, even as he finished speaking, something fell rattling among the dishes on the table, while those that sat near started up wondering what it might be.  After a while one of the men-at-arms gathered courage enough to pick it up and bring it to the Sheriff.  Then everyone saw that it was a blunted gray goose shaft, with a fine scroll, about the thickness of a goose quill, tied near to its head. The Sheriff opened the scroll and glanced at it, while the veins upon his forehead swelled and his cheeks grew ruddy with rage as he read, for this was what he saw:       \"_Now Heaven bless Thy Grace this day      Say all in sweet Sherwood      For thou didst give the prize away      To merry Robin Hood_.\"  \"Whence came this?\" cried the Sheriff in a mighty voice. \"Even through the window, Your Worship,\" quoth the man who had handed the shaft to him.     Will Stutely Rescued by His Companions  NOW WHEN THE SHERIFF found that neither law nor guile could overcome Robin Hood, he was much perplexed, and said to himself, \"Fool that I am! Had I not told our King of Robin Hood, I would not have gotten myself into such a coil; but now I must either take him captive or have wrath visited upon my head from his most gracious Majesty.  I have tried law, and I have tried guile, and I have failed in both; so I will try what may be done with might.\"  Thus communing within himself, he called his constables together and told them what was in his mind.  \"Now take ye each four men, all armed in proof,\" said he, \"and get ye gone to the forest, at different points, and lie in wait for this same Robin Hood.  But if any constable finds too many men against him, let him sound a horn, and then let each band within hearing come with all speed and join the party that calls them. Thus, I think, shall we take this green-clad knave.  Furthermore, to him that first meeteth with Robin Hood shall one hundred pounds of silver money be given, if he be brought to me dead or alive; and to him that meeteth with any of his band shall twoscore pounds be given, if such be brought to me dead or alive. So, be ye bold and be ye crafty.\"  So thus they went in threescore companies of five to Sherwood Forest, to take Robin Hood, each constable wishing that he might be the one to find the bold outlaw, or at least one of his band. For seven days and nights they hunted through the forest glades, but never saw so much as a single man in Lincoln green; for tidings of all this had been brought to Robin Hood by trusty Eadom o' the Blue Boar.  When he first heard the news, Robin said, \"If the Sheriff dare send force to meet force, woe will it be for him and many a better man besides, for blood will flow and there will be great trouble for all. But fain would I shun blood and battle, and fain would I not deal sorrow to womenfolk and wives because good stout yeomen lose their lives. Once I slew a man, and never do I wish to slay a man again, for it is bitter for the soul to think thereon.  So now we will abide silently in Sherwood Forest, so that it may be well for all, but should we be forced to defend ourselves, or any of our band, then let each man draw bow and brand with might and main.\"  At this speech many of the band shook their heads, and said to themselves, \"Now the Sheriff will think that we are cowards, and folk will scoff throughout the countryside, saying that we fear to meet these men.\" But they said nothing aloud, swallowing their words and doing as Robin bade them.  Thus they hid in the depths of Sherwood Forest for seven days and seven nights and never showed their faces abroad in all that time; but early in the morning of the eighth day Robin Hood called the band together and said, \"Now who will go and find what the Sheriff's men are at by this time? For I know right well they will not bide forever within Sherwood shades.\"  At this a great shout arose, and each man waved his bow aloft and cried that he might be the one to go.  Then Robin Hood's heart was proud when he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, \"Brave and true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows are ye, but ye cannot all go, so I will choose one from among you, and it shall be good Will Stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox in Sherwood Forest.\"  Then Will Stutely leaped high aloft and laughed loudly, clapping his hands for pure joy that he should have been chosen from among them all. \"Now thanks, good master,\" quoth he, \"and if I bring not news of those knaves to thee, call me no more thy sly Will Stutely.\"  Then he clad himself in a friar's gown, and underneath the robe he hung a good broadsword in such a place that he could easily lay hands upon it. Thus clad, he set forth upon his quest, until he came to the verge of the forest, and so to the highway.  He saw two bands of the Sheriff's men, yet he turned neither to the right nor the left, but only drew his cowl the closer over his face, folding his hands as if in meditation. So at last he came to the Sign of the Blue Boar.  \"For,\" quoth he to himself, \"our good friend Eadom will tell me all the news.\"  At the Sign of the Blue Boar he found a band of the Sheriffs men drinking right lustily; so, without speaking to anyone, he sat down upon a distant bench, his staff in his hand, and his head bowed forward as though he were meditating. Thus he sat waiting until he might see the landlord apart, and Eadom did not know him, but thought him to be some poor tired friar, so he let him sit without saying a word to him or molesting him, though he liked not the cloth.  \"For,\" said he to himself, \"it is a hard heart that kicks the lame dog from off the sill.\" As Stutely sat thus, there came a great house cat and rubbed against his knee, raising his robe a palm's-breadth high. Stutely pushed his robe quickly down again, but the constable who commanded the Sheriffs men saw what had passed, and saw also fair Lincoln green beneath the friar's robe. He said nothing at the time, but communed within himself in this wise: \"Yon is no friar of orders gray, and also, I wot, no honest yeoman goeth about in priest's garb, nor doth a thief go so for nought. Now I think in good sooth that is one of Robin Hood's own men.\" So, presently, he said aloud, \"O holy father, wilt thou not take a good pot of March beer to slake thy thirsty soul withal?\"  But Stutely shook his head silently, for he said to himself, \"Maybe there be those here who know my voice.\"  Then the constable said again, \"Whither goest thou, holy friar, upon this hot summer's day?\"  \"I go a pilgrim to Canterbury Town,\" answered Will Stutely, speaking gruffly, so that none might know his voice."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148"],["title","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#8)"],["body","the constable said, for the third time, \"Now tell me, holy father, do pilgrims to Canterbury wear good Lincoln green beneath their robes? Ha!  By my faith, I take thee to be some lusty thief, and perhaps one of Robin Hood's own band! Now, by Our Lady's grace, if thou movest hand or foot, I will run thee through the body with my sword!\"  Then he flashed forth his bright sword and leaped upon Will Stutely, thinking he would take him unaware; but Stutely had his own sword tightly held in his hand, beneath his robe, so he drew it forth before the constable came upon him.  Then the stout constable struck a mighty blow; but he struck no more in all that fight, for Stutely, parrying the blow right deftly, smote the constable back again with all his might. Then he would have escaped, but could not, for the other, all dizzy with the wound and with the flowing blood, seized him by the knees with his arms even as he reeled and fell.  Then the others rushed upon him, and Stutely struck again at another of the Sheriff's men, but the steel cap glanced the blow, and though the blade bit deep, it did not kill. Meanwhile, the constable, fainting as he was, drew Stutely downward, and the others, seeing the yeoman hampered so, rushed upon him again, and one smote him a blow upon the crown so that the blood ran down his face and blinded him.  Then, staggering, he fell, and all sprang upon him, though he struggled so manfully that they could hardly hold him fast. Then they bound him with stout hempen cords so that he could not move either hand or foot, and thus they overcame him.  Robin Hood stood under the greenwood tree, thinking of Will Stutely and how he might be faring, when suddenly he saw two of his stout yeomen come running down the forest path, and betwixt them ran buxom Maken of the Blue Boar.  Then Robin's heart fell, for he knew they were the bearers of ill tidings.  \"Will Stutely hath been taken,\" cried they, when they had come to where he stood.  \"And is it thou that hast brought such doleful news?\" said Robin to the lass.  \"Ay, marry, for I saw it all,\" cried she, panting as the hare pants when it has escaped the hounds, \"and I fear he is wounded sore, for one smote him main shrewdly i' the crown. They have bound him and taken him to Nottingham Town, and ere I left the Blue Boar I heard that he should be hanged tomorrow day.\"  \"He shall not be hanged tomorrow day,\" cried Robin; \"or, if he be, full many a one shall gnaw the sod, and many shall have cause to cry Alack-a- day!\"  Then he clapped his horn to his lips and blew three blasts right loudly, and presently his good yeomen came running through the greenwood until sevenscore bold blades were gathered around him.  \"Now hark you all!\" cried Robin.  \"Our dear companion Will Stutely hath been taken by that vile Sheriff's men, therefore doth it behoove us to take bow and brand in hand to bring him off again; for I wot that we ought to risk life and limb for him, as he hath risked life and limb for us.  Is it not so, my merry men all?\" Then all cried, \"Ay!\" with a great voice.  So the next day they all wended their way from Sherwood Forest, but by different paths, for it behooved them to be very crafty; so the band separated into parties of twos and threes, which were all to meet again in a tangled dell that lay near to Nottingham Town.  Then, when they had all gathered together at the place of meeting, Robin spoke to them thus:  \"Now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news, for it doth behoove us to be cunning and wary if we would bring our friend Will Stutely off from the Sheriff's clutches.\"  So they lay hidden a long time, until the sun stood high in the sky. The day was warm and the dusty road was bare of travelers, except an aged palmer who walked slowly along the highroad that led close beside the gray castle wall of Nottingham Town.  When Robin saw that no other wayfarer was within sight, he called young David of Doncaster, who was a shrewd man for his years, and said to him, \"Now get thee forth, young David, and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall, for he hath come but now from Nottingham Town, and may tell thee news of good Stutely, perchance.\"  So David strode forth, and when he came up to the pilgrim, he saluted him and said, \"Good morrow, holy father, and canst thou tell me when Will Stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree? I fain would not miss the sight, for I have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hanged.\"  \"Now, out upon thee, young man,\" cried the Palmer, \"that thou shouldst speak so when a good stout man is to be hanged for nothing but guarding his own life!\"  And he struck his staff upon the ground in anger. \"Alas, say I, that this thing should be! For even this day, toward evening, when the sun falleth low, he shall be hanged, fourscore rods from the great town gate of Nottingham, where three roads meet; for there the Sheriff sweareth he shall die as a warning to all outlaws in Nottinghamshire.  But yet, I say again, Alas!  For, though Robin Hood and his band may be outlaws, yet he taketh only from the rich and the strong and the dishonest man, while there is not a poor widow nor a peasant with many children, nigh to Sherwood, but has barley flour enough all the year long through him.  It grieves my heart to see one as gallant as this Stutely die, for I have been a good Saxon yeoman in my day, ere I turned palmer, and well I know a stout hand and one that smiteth shrewdly at a cruel Norman or a proud abbot with fat moneybags. Had good Stutely's master but known how his man was compassed about with perils, perchance he might send succor to bring him out of the hand of his enemies.  \"Ay, marry, that is true,\" cried the young man.  \"If Robin and his men be nigh this place, I wot right well they will strive to bring him forth from his peril.  But fare thee well, thou good old man, and believe me, if Will Stutely die, he shall be right well avenged.\"  Then he turned and strode rapidly away; but the Palmer looked after him, muttering, \"I wot that youth is no country hind that hath come to see a good man die.  Well, well, perchance Robin Hood is not so far away but that there will be stout doings this day.\" So he went upon his way, muttering to himself.  When David of Doncaster told Robin Hood what the Palmer had said to him, Robin called the band around him and spoke to them thus:  \"Now let us get straightway into Nottingham Town and mix ourselves with the people there; but keep ye one another in sight, pressing as near the prisoner and his guards as ye can, when they come outside the walls. Strike no man without need, for I would fain avoid bloodshed, but if ye do strike, strike hard, and see that there be no need to strike again. Then keep all together until we come again to Sherwood, and let no man leave his fellows.\"  The sun was low in the western sky when a bugle note sounded from the castle wall.  Then all was bustle in Nottingham Town and crowds filled the streets, for all knew that the famous Will Stutely was to be hanged that day.  Presently the castle gates opened wide and a great array of men-at-arms came forth with noise and clatter, the Sheriff, all clad in shining mail of linked chain, riding at their head. In the midst of all the guard, in a cart, with a halter about his neck, rode Will Stutely. His face was pale with his wound and with loss of blood, like the moon in broad daylight, and his fair hair was clotted in points upon his forehead, where the blood had hardened. When he came forth from the castle he looked up and he looked down, but though he saw some faces that showed pity and some that showed friendliness, he saw none that he knew.  Then his heart sank within him like a plummet of lead, but nevertheless he spoke up boldly.  \"Give a sword into my hand, Sir Sheriff,\" said he, \"and wounded man though I be, I will fight thee and all thy men till life and strength be gone.\"  \"Nay, thou naughty varlet,\" quoth the Sheriff, turning his head and looking right grimly upon Will Stutely, \"thou shalt have no sword but shall die a mean death, as beseemeth a vile thief like thee.\"  \"Then do but untie my hands and I will fight thee and thy men with no weapon but only my naked fists.  I crave no weapon, but let me not be meanly hanged this day.\"  Then the Sheriff laughed aloud.  \"Why, how now,\" quoth he, \"is thy proud stomach quailing?  Shrive thyself, thou vile knave, for I mean that thou shalt hang this day, and that where three roads meet, so that all men shall see thee hang, for carrion crows and daws to peck at.\"  \"O thou dastard heart!\" cried Will Stutely, gnashing his teeth at the Sheriff.  \"Thou coward hind!  If ever my good master meet thee thou shalt pay dearly for this day's work! He doth scorn thee, and so do all brave hearts.  Knowest thou not that thou and thy name are jests upon the lips of every brave yeoman?  Such a one as thou art, thou wretched craven, will never be able to subdue bold Robin Hood.\"  \"Ha!\" cried the Sheriff in a rage, \"is it even so? Am I a jest with thy master, as thou callest him? Now I will make a jest of thee and a sorry jest withal, for I will quarter thee limb from limb, after thou art hanged.\" Then he spurred his horse forward and said no more to Stutely.  At last they came to the great town gate, through which Stutely saw the fair country beyond, with hills and dales all clothed in verdure, and far away the dusky line of Sherwood's skirts. Then when he saw the slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the tears in his eyes. Thus he kept his head bowed till they had passed through the gate "]]]
