'Yes, yes,' he cried; 'we must fly, Charles.  The hound has left the police behind, and we may still escape.'  But the other, with the same imperturbable face, motionless save for the rhythm of his jaw muscles, walked quietly over and closed the door upon the inside.  'I think, friend Lucien,' said he in his quiet voice, 'that you had best stay where you are.'  Lesage looked at him with amazement gradually replacing terror upon his pallid features.  'But you do not understand, Charles,' he cried.  'Oh, yes, I think I do,' said the other, smiling.  'They may be here in a few minutes.  The hound has slipped its leash, you see, and has left them behind in the marsh; but they are sure to come here, for there is no other cottage but this.'  'They are sure to come here.'  'Well, then, let us fly.  In the darkness we may yet escape.'  'No; we shall stay where we are.'  'Madman, you may sacrifice your own life, but not mine.  Stay if you wish, but for my part I am going.'  He ran towards the door with a foolish, helpless flapping of his hands, but the other sprang in front of him with so determined a gesture of authority that the younger man staggered back from it as from a blow.  'You fool!' said his companion.  'You poor miserable dupe!'  Lesage's mouth opened, and he stood staring with his knees bent and his spread-fingered hands up, the most hideous picture of fear that I have ever seen.  'You, Charles, you!' he stammered, hawking up each word.  'Yes, me,' said the other, smiling grimly.  'A police agent all the time!  You who were the very soul of our society! You who were in our inmost council!  You who led us on! Oh, Charles, you have not the heart!  I think I hear them coming, Charles.  Let me pass; I beg and implore you to let me pass.'  The granite face shook slowly from side to side.  'But why me?  Why not Toussac?'  'If the dog had crippled Toussac, why then I might have had you both. But friend Toussac is rather vigorous for a thin little fellow like me. No, no, my good Lucien, you are destined to be the trophy of my bow and my spear, and you must reconcile yourself to the fact.'  Lesage slapped his forehead as if to assure himself that he was not dreaming.  'A police agent!' he repeated, 'Charles a police agent!'  'I thought it would surprise you.'  'But you were the most republican of us all.  We were none of us advanced enough for you.  How often have we gathered round you, Charles, to listen to your philosophy!  And there is Sibylle, too!  Don't tell me that Sibylle was a police spy also.  But you are joking, Charles. Say that you are joking!'  The man relaxed his grim features, and his eyes puckered with amusement.  'Your astonishment is very flattering,' said he.  'I confess that I thought that I played my part rather cleverly.  It is not my fault that these bunglers unleashed their hound, but at least I shall have the credit of having made a single-handed capture of one very desperate and dangerous conspirator.'  He smiled drily at this description of his prisoner.  'The Emperor knows how to reward his friends,' he added, 'and also how to punish his enemies.'  All this time he had held his hand in his bosom, and now he drew it out so far as to show the brass gleam of a pistol butt.  'It is no use,' said he, in answer to some look in the other's eye. 'You stay in the hut, alive or dead.'  Lesage put his hands to his face and began to cry with loud, helpless sobbings.  'Why, you have been worse than any of us, Charles,' he moaned.  'It was you who told Toussac to kill the man from Bow Street, and it was you also who set fire to the house in the Rue Basse de la Rampart.  And now you turn on us!'  'I did that because I wished to be the one to throw light upon it all--and at the proper moment.'  'That is very fine, Charles, but what will be thought about that when I make it all public in my own defence?  How can you explain all that to your Emperor?  There is still time to prevent my telling all that I know about you.'  'Well, really, I think that you are right, my friend,' said the other, drawing out his pistol and cocking it.  'Perhaps I _did_ go a little beyond my instructions in one or two points, and, as you very properly remark, there is still time to set it right.  It is a matter of detail whether I give you up living or give you up dead, and I think that, on the whole, it had better be dead.'  It had been horrible to see Toussac tear the throat out of the hound, but it had not made my flesh creep as it crept now.  Pity was mingled with my disgust for this unfortunate young man, who had been fitted by Nature for the life of a retired student or of a dreaming poet, but who had been dragged by stronger wills than his own into a part which no child could be more incapable of playing.  I forgave him the trick by which he had caught me and the selfish fears to which he had been willing to sacrifice me.  He had flung himself down upon the ground, and floundered about in a convulsion of terror, whilst his terrible little companion, with his cynical smile, stood over him with his pistol in his hand.  He played with the helpless panting coward as a cat might with a mouse; but I read in his inexorable eyes that it was no jest, and his finger seemed to be already tightening upon his trigger.  Full of horror at so cold-blooded a murder, I pushed open my crazy cupboard, and had rushed out to plead for the victim, when there came a buzz of voices and a clanking of steel from without.  With a stentorian shout of 'In the name of the Emperor!' a single violent wrench tore the door of the hut from its hinges.  It was still blowing hard, and through the open doorway I could see a thick cluster of mounted men, with plumes slanted and mantles flapping, the rain shining upon their shoulders.  At the side the light from the hut struck upon the heads of two beautiful horses, and upon the heavy red-toupeed busbies of the hussars who stood at their heads.  In the doorway stood another hussar--a man of high rank, as could be seen from the richness of his dress and the distinction of his bearing.  He was booted to the knees, with a uniform of light blue and silver, which his tall, slim, light-cavalry figure suited to a marvel.  I could not but admire the way in which he carried himself, for he never deigned to draw the sword which shone at his side, but he stood in the doorway glancing round the blood-bespattered hut, and staring at its occupants with a very cool and alert expression.  He had a handsome face, pale and clear-cut, with a bristling moustache, which cut across the brass chin-chain of his busby.  'Well,' said he, 'well?'  The older man had put his pistol back into the breast of his brown coat.  'This is Lucien Lesage,' said he.  The hussar looked with disgust at the prostrate figure upon the floor.  'A pretty conspirator!' said he.  'Get up, you grovelling hound! Here, Gerard, take charge of him and bring him into camp.'  A younger officer with two troopers at his heels came clanking in to the hut, and the wretched creature, half swooning, was dragged out into the darkness.  'Where is the other--the man called Toussac?'  'He killed the hound and escaped.  Lesage would have got away also had I not prevented him.  If you had kept the dog in leash we should have had them both, but as it is, Colonel Lasalle, I think that you may congratulate me.'  He held out his hand as he spoke, but the other turned abruptly on his heel.  'You hear that, General Savary?' said he, looking out of the door. 'Toussac has escaped.'  A tall, dark young man appeared within the circle of light cast by the lamp.  The agitation of his handsome swarthy face showed the effect which the news had upon him.  'Where is he then?'  'It is a quarter of an hour since he got away.'  'But he is the only dangerous man of them all.  The Emperor will be furious.  In which direction did he fly?'  'It must have been inland.'  'But who is this?' asked General Savary, pointing at me.  'I understood from your information that there were only two besides yourself, Monsieur--.'  'I had rather no names were mentioned,' said the other abruptly.  'I can well understand that,' General Savary answered with a sneer.  'I would have told you that the cottage was the rendezvous, but it was not decided upon until the last moment.  I gave you the means of tracking Toussac, but you let the hound slip.  I certainly think that you will have to answer to the Emperor for the way in which you have managed the business.'  'That, sir, is our affair,' said General Savary sternly.  'In the meantime you have not told us who this person is.'  It seemed useless for me to conceal my identity, since I had a letter in my pocket which would reveal it.  'My name is Louis de Laval,' said I proudly.  I may confess that I think we had exaggerated our own importance over in England.  We had thought that all France was wondering whether we should return, whereas in the quick march of events France had really almost forgotten our existence.  This young General Savary was not in the least impressed by my aristocratic name, but he jotted it down in his notebook.  'Monsieur de Laval has nothing whatever to do with the matter,' said the spy.  'He has blundered into it entirely by chance, and I will answer for his safe keeping in case he should be wanted.'  'He will certainly be wanted,' said General Savary.  'In the meantime I need every trooper that I have for the chase, so, if you make yourself personally responsible, and bring him to the camp when needed, I see no objection to his remaining in your keeping.  I shall send to you if I require him.'  'He will be at the Emperor's orders.'  'Are there any papers in the cottage?'  'They have been burned.'  'That is unfortunate.'  'But I have duplicates.'  'Excellent!  Come, Lasalle, every minute counts,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10581"],["title","Uncle Bernac: A Memory of the Empire (#8)"],["body","there is nothing to be done here.  Let the men scatter, and we may still ride him down.'  The two tall soldiers clanked out of the cottage without taking any further notice of my companion, and I heard the sharp stern order and the jingling of metal as the troopers sprang back into their saddles once more.  An instant later they were off, and I listened to the dull beat of their hoofs dying rapidly into a confused murmur.  My little snuff-coloured champion went to the door of the hut and peered after them through the darkness.  Then he came back and looked me up and down, with his usual dry sardonic smile.  'Well, young man,' said he, 'we have played some pretty _tableaux vivants_ for your amusement, and you can thank me for that nice seat in the front row of the parterre.'  'I am under a very deep obligation to you, sir,' I answered, struggling between my gratitude and my aversion.  'I hardly know how to thank you.'  He looked at me with a singular expression in his ironical eyes.  'You will have the opportunity for thanking me later,' said he. 'In the meantime, as you say that you are a stranger upon our coast, and as I am responsible for your safe keeping, you cannot do better than follow me, and I will take you to a place where you may sleep in safety.'    CHAPTER VI   THE SECRET PASSAGE  The fire had already smouldered down, and my companion blew out the lamp, so that we had not taken ten paces before we had lost sight of the ill-omened cottage, in which I had received so singular a welcome upon my home-coming.  The wind had softened down, but a fine rain, cold and clammy, came drifting up from the sea.  Had I been left to myself I should have found myself as much at a loss as I had been when I first landed; but my companion walked with a brisk and assured step, so that it was evident that he guided himself by landmarks which were invisible to me.  For my part, wet and miserable, with my forlorn bundle under my arm, and my nerves all jangled by my terrible experiences, I trudged in silence by his side, turning over in my mind all that had occurred to me.  Young as I was, I had heard much political discussion amongst my elders in England, and the state of affairs in France was perfectly familiar to me.  I was aware that the recent elevation of Buonaparte to the throne had enraged the small but formidable section of Jacobins and extreme Republicans, who saw that all their efforts to abolish a kingdom had only ended in transforming it into an empire.  It was, indeed, a pitiable result of their frenzied strivings that a crown with eight _fleurs-de-lis_ should be changed into a higher crown surmounted by a cross and ball.  On the other hand, the followers of the Bourbons, in whose company I had spent my youth, were equally disappointed at the manner in which the mass of the French people hailed this final step in the return from chaos to order.  Contradictory as were their motives, the more violent spirits of both parties were united in their hatred to Napoleon, and in their fierce determination to get rid of him by any means.  Hence a series of conspiracies, most of them with their base in England; and hence also a large use of spies and informers upon the part of Fouche and of Savary, upon whom the responsibility of the safety of the Emperor lay.  A strange chance had landed me upon the French coast at the very same time as a murderous conspirator, and had afterwards enabled me to see the weapons with which the police contrived to thwart and outwit him and his associates.  When I looked back upon my series of adventures, my wanderings in the salt-marsh, my entrance into the cottage, my discovery of the papers, my capture by the conspirators, the long period of suspense with Toussac's dreadful thumb upon my chin, and finally the moving scenes which I had witnessed--the killing of the hound, the capture of Lesage, and the arrival of the soldiers--I could not wonder that my nerves were overwrought, and that I surprised myself in little convulsive gestures, like those of a frightened child.  The chief thought which now filled my mind was what my relations were with this dangerous man who walked by my side.  His conduct and bearing had filled me with abhorrence.  I had seen the depth of cunning with which he had duped and betrayed his companions, and I had read in his lean smiling face the cold deliberate cruelty of his nature, as he stood, pistol in hand, over the whimpering coward whom he had outwitted. Yet I could not deny that when, through my own foolish curiosity, I had placed myself in a most hopeless position, it was he who had braved the wrath of the formidable Toussac in order to extricate me.  It was evident also that he might have made his achievement more striking by delivering up two prisoners instead of one to the troopers.  It is true that I was not a conspirator, but I might have found it difficult to prove it.  So inconsistent did such conduct seem in this little yellow flint-stone of a man that, after walking a mile or two in silence, I asked him suddenly what the meaning of it might be.  I heard a dry chuckle in the darkness, as if he were amused by the abruptness and directness of my question.  'You are a most amusing person, Monsieur--Monsieur--let me see, what did you say your name was?'  'De Laval.'  'Ah, quite so, Monsieur de Laval.  You have the impetuosity and the ingenuousness of youth.  You want to know what is up a chimney, you jump up the chimney.  You want to know the reason of a thing, and you blurt out a question.  I have been in the habit of living among people who keep their thoughts to themselves, and I find you very refreshing.'  'Whatever the motives of your conduct, there is no doubt that you saved my life,' said I.  'I am much obliged to you for your intercession.' It is the most difficult thing in the world to express gratitude to a person who fills you with abhorrence, and I fear that my halting speech was another instance of that ingenuousness of which he accused me.  'I can do without your thanks,' said he coldly.  'You are perfectly right when you think that if it had suited my purpose I should have let you perish, and I am perfectly right when I think that if it were not that you are under an obligation you would fail to see my hand if I stretched it out to you just as that overgrown puppy Lasalle did.  It is very honourable, he thinks, to serve the Emperor upon the field of battle, and to risk life in his behalf, but when it comes to living amidst danger as I have done, consorting with desperate men, and knowing well that the least slip would mean death, why then one is beneath the notice of a fine clean-handed gentleman.  Why,' he continued in a burst of bitter passion, 'I have dared more, and endured more, with Toussac and a few of his kidney for comrades, than this Lasalle has done in all the childish cavalry charges that ever he undertook.  As to service, all his Marshals put together have not rendered the Emperor as pressing a service as I have done.  But I daresay it does not strike you in that light, Monsieur--Monsieur--'  'De Laval.'  'Quite so--it is curious how that name escapes me.  I daresay you take the same view as Colonel Lasalle?'  'It is not a question upon which I can offer an opinion,' said I. 'I only know that I owe my life to your intercession.'  I do not know what reply he might have made to this evasion, but at that moment we heard a couple of pistol shots and a distant shouting from far away in the darkness.  We stopped for a few minutes, but all was silent once more.  'They must have caught sight of Toussac,' said my companion.  'I am afraid that he is too strong and too cunning to be taken by them.  I do not know what impression he left upon you, but I can tell you that you will go far to meet a more dangerous man.'  I answered that I would go far to avoid meeting one, unless I had the means of defending myself, and my companion's dry chuckle showed that he appreciated my feelings.  'Yet he is an absolutely honest man, which is no very common thing in these days,' said he.  'He is one of those who, at the outbreak of the Revolution, embraced it with the whole strength of his simple nature. He believed what the writers and the speakers told him, and he was convinced that, after a little disturbance and a few necessary executions, France was to become a heaven upon earth, the centre of peace and comfort and brotherly love.  A good many people got those fine ideas into their heads, but the heads have mostly dropped into the sawdust-basket by this time.  Toussac was true to them, and when instead of peace he found war, instead of comfort a grinding poverty, and instead of equality an Empire, it drove him mad.  He became the fierce creature you see, with the one idea of devoting his huge body and giant's strength to the destruction of those who had interfered with his ideal.  He is fearless, persevering, and implacable.  I have no doubt at all that he will kill me for the part that I have played to-night.'  It was in the calmest voice that my companion uttered the remark, and it made me understand that it was no boast when he said there was more courage needed to carry on his unsavoury trade than to play the part of a _beau sabreur_ like Lasalle.  He paused a little, and then went on as if speaking to himself.  'Yes,' said he, 'I missed my chance.  I certainly  ought to have shot him when he was struggling with the hound.  But if I had only wounded him he would have torn me into bits like an over-boiled pullet, so perhaps it is as well as it is.'  We had left the salt-marsh behind us, and for some time I had felt the soft springy turf of the downland beneath my feet, and our path had risen and dipped over the curves of the low coast hills.  In spite of the darkness my companion walked with great assurance, never hesitating for an instant, and keeping up a stiff pace which was welcome to me in my sodden and benumbed condition.  I had been so "]]]
