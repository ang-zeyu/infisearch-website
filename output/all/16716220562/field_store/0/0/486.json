Or at least so thought Tarzan of the Apes, who squatted upon a low-swinging branch in a near-by tree and looked down upon her.  Just to have seen him there, lolling upon the swaying bough of the jungle-forest giant, his brown skin mottled by the brilliant equatorial sunlight which percolated through the leafy canopy of green above him, his clean-limbed body relaxed in graceful ease, his shapely head partly turned in contemplative absorption and his intelligent, gray eyes dreamily devouring the object of their devotion, you would have thought him the reincarnation of some demigod of old.  You would not have guessed that in infancy he had suckled at the breast of a hideous, hairy she-ape, nor that in all his conscious past since his parents had passed away in the little cabin by the landlocked harbor at the jungle's verge, he had known no other associates than the sullen bulls and the snarling cows of the tribe of Kerchak, the great ape.  Nor, could you have read the thoughts which passed through that active, healthy brain, the longings and desires and aspirations which the sight of Teeka inspired, would you have been any more inclined to give credence to the reality of the origin of the ape-man. For, from his thoughts alone, you could never have gleaned the truth--that he had been born to a gentle English lady or that his sire had been an English nobleman of time-honored lineage.  Lost to Tarzan of the Apes was the truth of his origin.  That he was John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, with a seat in the House of Lords, he did not know, nor, knowing, would have understood.  Yes, Teeka was indeed beautiful!  Of course Kala had been beautiful--one's mother is always that--but Teeka was beautiful in a way all her own, an indescribable sort of way which Tarzan was just beginning to sense in a rather vague and hazy manner.  For years had Tarzan and Teeka been play-fellows, and Teeka still continued to be playful while the young bulls of her own age were rapidly becoming surly and morose.  Tarzan, if he gave the matter much thought at all, probably reasoned that his growing attachment for the young female could be easily accounted for by the fact that of the former playmates she and he alone retained any desire to frolic as of old.  But today, as he sat gazing upon her, he found himself noting the beauties of Teeka's form and features--something he never had done before, since none of them had aught to do with Teeka's ability to race nimbly through the lower terraces of the forest in the primitive games of tag and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan's fertile brain evolved. Tarzan scratched his head, running his fingers deep into the shock of black hair which framed his shapely, boyish face--he scratched his head and sighed.  Teeka's new-found beauty became as suddenly his despair. He envied her the handsome coat of hair which covered her body.  His own smooth, brown hide he hated with a hatred born of disgust and contempt.  Years back he had harbored a hope that some day he, too, would be clothed in hair as were all his brothers and sisters; but of late he had been forced to abandon the delectable dream.  Then there were Teeka's great teeth, not so large as the males, of course, but still mighty, handsome things by comparison with Tarzan's feeble white ones.  And her beetling brows, and broad, flat nose, and her mouth! Tarzan had often practiced making his mouth into a little round circle and then puffing out his cheeks while he winked his eyes rapidly; but he felt that he could never do it in the same cute and irresistible way in which Teeka did it.  And as he watched her that afternoon, and wondered, a young bull ape who had been lazily foraging for food beneath the damp, matted carpet of decaying vegetation at the roots of a near-by tree lumbered awkwardly in Teeka's direction.  The other apes of the tribe of Kerchak moved listlessly about or lolled restfully in the midday heat of the equatorial jungle.  From time to time one or another of them had passed close to Teeka, and Tarzan had been uninterested.  Why was it then that his brows contracted and his muscles tensed as he saw Taug pause beside the young she and then squat down close to her?  Tarzan always had liked Taug.  Since childhood they had romped together.  Side by side they had squatted near the water, their quick, strong fingers ready to leap forth and seize Pisah, the fish, should that wary denizen of the cool depths dart surfaceward to the lure of the insects Tarzan tossed upon the face of the pool.  Together they had baited Tublat and teased Numa, the lion.  Why, then, should Tarzan feel the rise of the short hairs at the nape of his neck merely because Taug sat close to Teeka?  It is true that Taug was no longer the frolicsome ape of yesterday. When his snarling-muscles bared his giant fangs no one could longer imagine that Taug was in as playful a mood as when he and Tarzan had rolled upon the turf in mimic battle.  The Taug of today was a huge, sullen bull ape, somber and forbidding.  Yet he and Tarzan never had quarreled.  For a few minutes the young ape-man watched Taug press closer to Teeka. He saw the rough caress of the huge paw as it stroked the sleek shoulder of the she, and then Tarzan of the Apes slipped catlike to the ground and approached the two.  As he came his upper lip curled into a snarl, exposing his fighting fangs, and a deep growl rumbled from his cavernous chest.  Taug looked up, batting his blood-shot eyes.  Teeka half raised herself and looked at Tarzan.  Did she guess the cause of his perturbation? Who may say? At any rate, she was feminine, and so she reached up and scratched Taug behind one of his small, flat ears.  Tarzan saw, and in the instant that he saw, Teeka was no longer the little playmate of an hour ago; instead she was a wondrous thing--the most wondrous in the world--and a possession for which Tarzan would fight to the death against Taug or any other who dared question his right of proprietorship.  Stooped, his muscles rigid and one great shoulder turned toward the young bull, Tarzan of the Apes sidled nearer and nearer.  His face was partly averted, but his keen gray eyes never left those of Taug, and as he came, his growls increased in depth and volume.  Taug rose upon his short legs, bristling.  His fighting fangs were bared.  He, too, sidled, stiff-legged, and growled.  \"Teeka is Tarzan's,\" said the ape-man, in the low gutturals of the great anthropoids.  \"Teeka is Taug's,\" replied the bull ape.  Thaka and Numgo and Gunto, disturbed by the growlings of the two young bulls, looked up half apathetic, half interested.  They were sleepy, but they sensed a fight.  It would break the monotony of the humdrum jungle life they led.  Coiled about his shoulders was Tarzan's long grass rope, in his hand was the hunting knife of the long-dead father he had never known.  In Taug's little brain lay a great respect for the shiny bit of sharp metal which the ape-boy knew so well how to use.  With it had he slain Tublat, his fierce foster father, and Bolgani, the gorilla.  Taug knew these things, and so he came warily, circling about Tarzan in search of an opening.  The latter, made cautious because of his lesser bulk and the inferiority of his natural armament, followed similar tactics.  For a time it seemed that the altercation would follow the way of the majority of such differences between members of the tribe and that one of them would finally lose interest and wander off to prosecute some other line of endeavor.  Such might have been the end of it had the CASUS BELLI been other than it was; but Teeka was flattered at the attention that was being drawn to her and by the fact that these two young bulls were contemplating battle on her account.  Such a thing never before had occurred in Teeka's brief life.  She had seen other bulls battling for other and older shes, and in the depth of her wild little heart she had longed for the day when the jungle grasses would be reddened with the blood of mortal combat for her fair sake.  So now she squatted upon her haunches and insulted both her admirers impartially.  She hurled taunts at them for their cowardice, and called them vile names, such as Histah, the snake, and Dango, the hyena.  She threatened to call Mumga to chastise them with a stick--Mumga, who was so old that she could no longer climb and so toothless that she was forced to confine her diet almost exclusively to bananas and grub-worms.  The apes who were watching heard and laughed.  Taug was infuriated.  He made a sudden lunge for Tarzan, but the ape-boy leaped nimbly to one side, eluding him, and with the quickness of a cat wheeled and leaped back again to close quarters.  His hunting knife was raised above his head as he came in, and he aimed a vicious blow at Taug's neck.  The ape wheeled to dodge the weapon so that the keen blade struck him but a glancing blow upon the shoulder.  The spurt of red blood brought a shrill cry of delight from Teeka.  Ah, but this was something worth while!  She glanced about to see if others had witnessed this evidence of her popularity.  Helen of Troy was never one whit more proud than was Teeka at that moment.  If Teeka had not been so absorbed in her own vaingloriousness she might have noted the rustling of leaves in the tree above her--a rustling which was not caused by any movement of the wind,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],["title","Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#1)"],["body","there was no wind.  And had she looked up she might have seen a sleek body crouching almost directly over her and wicked yellow eyes glaring hungrily down upon her, but Teeka did not look up.  With his wound Taug had backed off growling horribly.  Tarzan had followed him, screaming insults at him, and menacing him with his brandishing blade.  Teeka moved from beneath the tree in an effort to keep close to the duelists.  The branch above Teeka bent and swayed a trifle with the movement of the body of the watcher stretched along it.  Taug had halted now and was preparing to make a new stand.  His lips were flecked with foam, and saliva drooled from his jowls.  He stood with head lowered and arms outstretched, preparing for a sudden charge to close quarters.  Could he but lay his mighty hands upon that soft, brown skin the battle would be his.  Taug considered Tarzan's manner of fighting unfair.  He would not close.  Instead, he leaped nimbly just beyond the reach of Taug's muscular fingers.  The ape-boy had as yet never come to a real trial of strength with a bull ape, other than in play, and so he was not at all sure that it would be safe to put his muscles to the test in a life and death struggle.  Not that he was afraid, for Tarzan knew nothing of fear. The instinct of self-preservation gave him caution--that was all.  He took risks only when it seemed necessary, and then he would hesitate at nothing.  His own method of fighting seemed best fitted to his build and to his armament.  His teeth, while strong and sharp, were, as weapons of offense, pitifully inadequate by comparison with the mighty fighting fangs of the anthropoids.  By dancing about, just out of reach of an antagonist, Tarzan could do infinite injury with his long, sharp hunting knife, and at the same time escape many of the painful and dangerous wounds which would be sure to follow his falling into the clutches of a bull ape.  And so Taug charged and bellowed like a bull, and Tarzan of the Apes danced lightly to this side and that, hurling jungle billingsgate at his foe, the while he nicked him now and again with his knife.  There were lulls in the fighting when the two would stand panting for breath, facing each other, mustering their wits and their forces for a new onslaught.  It was during a pause such as this that Taug chanced to let his eyes rove beyond his foeman.  Instantly the entire aspect of the ape altered.  Rage left his countenance to be supplanted by an expression of fear.  With a cry that every ape there recognized, Taug turned and fled.  No need to question him--his warning proclaimed the near presence of their ancient enemy.  Tarzan started to seek safety, as did the other members of the tribe, and as he did so he heard a panther's scream mingled with the frightened cry of a she-ape.  Taug heard, too; but he did not pause in his flight.  With the ape-boy, however, it was different.  He looked back to see if any member of the tribe was close pressed by the beast of prey, and the sight that met his eyes filled them with an expression of horror.  Teeka it was who cried out in terror as she fled across a little clearing toward the trees upon the opposite side, for after her leaped Sheeta, the panther, in easy, graceful bounds.  Sheeta appeared to be in no hurry.  His meat was assured, since even though the ape reached the trees ahead of him she could not climb beyond his clutches before he could be upon her.  Tarzan saw that Teeka must die.  He cried to Taug and the other bulls to hasten to Teeka's assistance, and at the same time he ran toward the pursuing beast, taking down his rope as he came.  Tarzan knew that once the great bulls were aroused none of the jungle, not even Numa, the lion, was anxious to measure fangs with them, and that if all those of the tribe who chanced to be present today would charge, Sheeta, the great cat, would doubtless turn tail and run for his life.  Taug heard, as did the others, but no one came to Tarzan's assistance or Teeka's rescue, and Sheeta was rapidly closing up the distance between himself and his prey.  The ape-boy, leaping after the panther, cried aloud to the beast in an effort to turn it from Teeka or otherwise distract its attention until the she-ape could gain the safety of the higher branches where Sheeta dared not go.  He called the panther every opprobrious name that fell to his tongue.  He dared him to stop and do battle with him; but Sheeta only loped on after the luscious titbit now almost within his reach.  Tarzan was not far behind and he was gaining, but the distance was so short that he scarce hoped to overhaul the carnivore before it had felled Teeka.  In his right hand the boy swung his grass rope above his head as he ran.  He hated to chance a miss, for the distance was much greater than he ever had cast before except in practice.  It was the full length of his grass rope which separated him from Sheeta, and yet there was no other thing to do.  He could not reach the brute's side before it overhauled Teeka.  He must chance a throw.  And just as Teeka sprang for the lower limb of a great tree, and Sheeta rose behind her in a long, sinuous leap, the coils of the ape-boy's grass rope shot swiftly through the air, straightening into a long thin line as the open noose hovered for an instant above the savage head and the snarling jaws.  Then it settled--clean and true about the tawny neck it settled, and Tarzan, with a quick twist of his rope-hand, drew the noose taut, bracing himself for the shock when Sheeta should have taken up the slack.  Just short of Teeka's glossy rump the cruel talons raked the air as the rope tightened and Sheeta was brought to a sudden stop--a stop that snapped the big beast over upon his back.  Instantly Sheeta was up--with glaring eyes, and lashing tail, and gaping jaws, from which issued hideous cries of rage and disappointment.  He saw the ape-boy, the cause of his discomfiture, scarce forty feet before him, and Sheeta charged.  Teeka was safe now; Tarzan saw to that by a quick glance into the tree whose safety she had gained not an instant too soon, and Sheeta was charging.  It was useless to risk his life in idle and unequal combat from which no good could come; but could he escape a battle with the enraged cat? And if he was forced to fight, what chance had he to survive? Tarzan was constrained to admit that his position was aught but a desirable one.  The trees were too far to hope to reach in time to elude the cat.  Tarzan could but stand facing that hideous charge. In his right hand he grasped his hunting knife--a puny, futile thing indeed by comparison with the great rows of mighty teeth which lined Sheeta's powerful jaws, and the sharp talons encased within his padded paws; yet the young Lord Greystoke faced it with the same courageous resignation with which some fearless ancestor went down to defeat and death on Senlac Hill by Hastings.  From safety points in the trees the great apes watched, screaming hatred at Sheeta and advice at Tarzan, for the progenitors of man have, naturally, many human traits.  Teeka was frightened.  She screamed at the bulls to hasten to Tarzan's assistance; but the bulls were otherwise engaged--principally in giving advice and making faces. Anyway, Tarzan was not a real Mangani, so why should they risk their lives in an effort to protect him?  And now Sheeta was almost upon the lithe, naked body, and--the body was not there.  Quick as was the great cat, the ape-boy was quicker.  He leaped to one side almost as the panther's talons were closing upon him, and as Sheeta went hurtling to the ground beyond, Tarzan was racing for the safety of the nearest tree.  The panther recovered himself almost immediately and, wheeling, tore after his prey, the ape-boy's rope dragging along the ground behind him.  In doubling back after Tarzan, Sheeta had passed around a low bush.  It was a mere nothing in the path of any jungle creature of the size and weight of Sheeta--provided it had no trailing rope dangling behind.  But Sheeta was handicapped by such a rope, and as he leaped once again after Tarzan of the Apes the rope encircled the small bush, became tangled in it and brought the panther to a sudden stop.  An instant later Tarzan was safe among the higher branches of a small tree into which Sheeta could not follow him.  Here he perched, hurling twigs and epithets at the raging feline beneath him.  The other members of the tribe now took up the bombardment, using such hard-shelled fruits and dead branches as came within their reach, until Sheeta, goaded to frenzy and snapping at the grass rope, finally succeeded in severing its strands.  For a moment the panther stood glaring first at one of his tormentors and then at another, until, with a final scream of rage, he turned and slunk off into the tangled mazes of the jungle.  A half hour later the tribe was again upon the ground, feeding as though naught had occurred to interrupt the somber dullness of their lives.  Tarzan had recovered the greater part of his rope and was busy fashioning a new noose, while Teeka squatted close behind him, in evident token that her choice was made.  Taug eyed them sullenly.  Once when he came close, Teeka bared her fangs and growled at him, and Tarzan showed his canines in an ugly snarl; but Taug did not provoke a quarrel.  He seemed to accept after the manner of his kind the decision of the she as an indication that he had been vanquished in his battle for her favors.  Later in the day, his rope repaired, Tarzan took to the trees in search of game.  More than his fellows he required meat, and so, while they were satisfied with fruits and herbs and beetles, which could be discovered without much effort upon their part, Tarzan spent considerable time hunting the game animals whose flesh alone satisfied the cravings of his stomach and furnished sustenance and strength to the mighty thews which, day by day, were building beneath the soft,"]]]
