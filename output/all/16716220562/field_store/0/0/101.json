They were absolutely useless--or so the lads thought.  \"Now for the papers,\" said Jack, as he straightened up after tinkering with the last machine.  Cautiously the two lads advanced upon the sleeping German. Frank raised his revolver and would have brought it down on the man's head had not Jack stayed him with a gesture.  \"No need of that,\" he said. \"I don't like to hurt a man except when it is absolutely necessary.\"  Frank put the revolver back in his pocket.  Gently, Jack thrust his hand into the German's pocket. He fumbled about a moment and then drew forth a paper. Turning his head aside he struck a match and glanced at the paper. Then he nodded his satisfaction.  \"This is it,\" he said.  Frank, at that moment, had risen to his feet. Believing the work was accomplished, he was moving off toward the hydroplane. As Jack now made to get to his feet, he chanced to glance at the German he had just relieved of the papers.  The lad uttered an exclamation of surprise, and no wonder. The man's eyes were open and gazed straight at Jack. In his hand he held a revolver and it was levelled at Jack's head.  \"Hands up!\" said the German, quietly.  There was nothing for Jack to do but obey or be shot. His hands went high in the air, but he still retained the valuable papers.  \"Drop those papers,\" was the next command.  Jack obeyed and the papers fluttered to his feet. The German reached out and picked them up with his left hand while with his right he still covered the lad with his revolver.  \"So you're a spy, eh?\" said the German.  Jack made no reply, but a gleam of hope lighted up his eye; for, Frank, chancing to turn for some unexplainable reason, had taken in the situation and was now advancing on tiptoe to his friend's aid.  \"How did you get here?\" demanded the German, making ready to rise.  Again Jack made no reply; but none was necessary, for at that moment Frank had come within striking distance. His arm rose and fell, and as his revolver butt descended upon the German's head, the latter toppled over in a heap.  Quickly, Jack stooped and again recovered the papers he had taken so much pains to get.  \"Come on!\" cried Frank. \"We haven't time to fool around here. The rest of this crowd is likely to wake up in a minute or two.\"  Jack followed his friend across the sand. They laid hold of the hydroplane and rolled it toward the water. In it went with a splash and Frank cried:  \"Climb aboard quickly!\"  Jack needed no urging and a moment later the two boys were ready for flight. And then, suddenly, there was the crack of a revolver behind them and a bullet flew close to Jack's ear.  The German leader had recovered consciousness, and springing to his feet, dashed to the water's edge and fired point blank at the machine. Fortunately, in his excitement his aim was poor and he missed. Before he could fire again, Frank wheeled about and his revolver spoke sharply.  The German threw up his arms, and with a gasp, pitched headlong into the sea.  But the sounds of the two shots had aroused the sleeping camp. Wild cries came from the shore, followed by heavy footfalls as the Germans rushed toward the water.  \"Hurry, Frank!\" cried Jack.  As lightly as a fairy the hydroplane skimmed over the water; then went soaring in the air. Frank gave a loud cheer.  \"Safe!\" he exclaimed.  But the lad was wrong.  From on shore came a chorus of angry cries and imprecations. Hastily the Germans made a rush for their aeroplanes to give chase. None would move. Followed more cries and angry shouts.  \"Wait,\" said one German. \"I've some gasoline.\"  Rapidly he opened up a big can, which he took from the bottom of his machine. Quickly the tank was filled and the man climbed into the pilot's seat. Another jumped in with him.  \"Give us some of that gasoline!\" cried another.  The German shook his head.  \"Not enough,\" he replied. \"We'll overtake those fellows and then come back for the rest of you.\"  The aeroplane leaped skyward and started in pursuit of Frank and Jack.  The two boys, believing that they were safe, were going along only at a fair rate of speed when Jack's keen ears caught the sound of the pursuing machine.  \"They're after us, Frank!\" he called.  \"Impossible!\" replied Frank. \"How can they fly without gas?\"  \"Well, they're coming, all the same,\" declared Jack.  He produced his two revolvers and examined them carefully.  \"You run this thing and I'll do what fighting is necessary,\" he said. \"Wish I could shoot like you can; but I can't; and I can't run this machine either.\"  The German aeroplane was gaining steadily.  \"He can outrun us,\" said Frank, quietly. \"There is only one, thank goodness. You'll have to bring him down, Jack.\"  \"I'll try,\" was Jack's reply. \"If I had a rifle I might be able to pick him off now.\"  \"Well, he won't hardly have any the best of it,\" said Frank. \"The chances are he has no rifle either.\"  Frank was correct in this surmise.  Rapidly the German aircraft gained.  \"Crack!\" the German had fired the first shot.  It went wild. Jack fired, but with no better result.  \"Hit anything?\" asked Frank, without turning his head.  \"No,\" said Jack, \"but neither did the other fellow.\"  \"Try it again,\" said Frank.  Jack did so; but again the bullet went wild. All this time the two craft were flying straight out to sea.  Once more the German fired and Jack felt something whizz overhead.  \"This is getting too close,\" the lad muttered to himself. Then he called to Frank.  \"Slow down, quick!\"  Frank had no means of telling what plan Jack had in mind, but he did not hesitate. The hydroplane slowed down with a jerk.  The pilot of the German craft was caught off his guard. He dashed upon the hydroplane. But as he neared it he swerved to the left to avoid a collision. It was what Jack had expected. Standing up in his precarious position, Jack took a snap shot at the pilot as the German craft swept by.  At that close distance, in spite of the rate of speed at which the enemy was travelling, a miss was practically impossible.  The German machine swayed crazily from one side to the other; then dived.  \"I got him, Frank!\" shouted Jack.  Both lads gazed over the side at the falling enemy.  Suddenly the machine righted and descended more slowly.  \"By Jove! a cool customer,\" said Frank. \"He's regained control of the plane. He'll be up again in a moment.\"  Again they watched the foe carefully.  \"No, he won't,\" said Jack, \"he's still going down.\"  \"Then we may as well be moving,\" said Frank.  \"Hold on!\" shouted Jack. \"We can't leave those fellows there. They may get to shore or be picked up. Then they would give the warning and all our efforts would be for naught.\"  \"Right,\" said Frank. \"We'll go down after them.\"  The hydroplane descended slowly.    CHAPTER X  THE FIGHT ON THE WATER   Below, the fallen aeroplane rested upon the surface of the sea. In the darkness, it was hard for the lads to tell just how badly the craft was damaged and whether it would float; but Jack's idea was to be on the safe side.  While still some distance from the water, there was a shot from below.  \"Hello!\" said Jack. \"They're alive and kicking, all right. Wonder if we can't go down and get them from the water.\"  \"It's a better plan, I guess,\" said Frank. \"We'll have an even break then. This way they have all the advantage.\"  He opened up the engine and the hydroplane ran some distance from the position of the men below. Then he shut off the motor and allowed the plane to glide down to the sea.  With the craft riding the swell of the waves, Jack picked up the enemy with his night glass. The disabled craft also was riding the waves gently perhaps five hundred yards away.  Jack gave the position to Frank, and the hydroplane approached the foe slowly. Within a range that would make accurate revolver shooting possible, the hydroplane came to a halt. As it did so there was the sound of a revolver shot from across the water and something whizzed overhead.  \"Must have some pretty fair shooters over there,\" said Frank, quietly. \"However, they can't see us any better than we can see them. Of course, they can see our craft all right, the same as we can see theirs, but they can't spot us.\"  \"No; nor we can't spot them, which makes it worse,\" said Jack.  \"We'll try a couple of shots for luck,\" said Frank.  He raised his revolver and fired quickly twice. His efforts were rewarded by a scream, apparently of pain.  \"Must have hit one of them,\" he said grimly.  Again a revolver across the water flashed and the two lads heard a bullet whistle by.  Jack fired but without result and then Frank fired again.  There was another scream.  \"Either got the other one, or the same one again,\" said Frank.  They waited some moments in silence, but no further shots came from the foe.  \"By Jove!\" said Jack, \"you must have got them both. Let's go and have a look.\"   Slowly, Frank started the hydroplane and they bore down on the enemy. Now they were two hundred, then one hundred yards away.  \"Must have got them, all right,\" said Frank. \"I----\"  The flash of a revolver from the disabled craft interrupted him. It was closely followed by another and then two more.  With a sudden move, Frank changed the course of the hydroplane. He felt a sharp pain in his left shoulder.  \"Got me,\" he called to Jack.  The latter was alarmed.  \"Where?\" he demanded.  \"Left shoulder,\" said Frank, quietly. \"Nothing serious, though.\"  Jack levelled his revolver and fired rapidly at the enemy. His pains were rewarded by howls of derision.  \"They tricked us, all right,\" said Jack, as he reloaded.  \"That's what they did. I should have known better, too. They almost settled us.\"  \"We've got to get them, some way,\" declared Jack.  \"Show me how, and I'll go along with you,\" declared Frank.  \"Well, I've got a scheme, but I don't know whether it will work or not.\"  \"Let's hear it.\"  \"All right. But first, can you manage this plane"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],["title","Kazan (#0)"],["body","Team.

THE CALL OF SUN ROCK     CHAPTER I  THE MIRACLE   Kazan lay mute and motionless, his gray nose between his forepaws, his eyes half closed. A rock could have appeared scarcely less lifeless than he; not a muscle twitched; not a hair moved; not an eyelid quivered. Yet every drop of the wild blood in his splendid body was racing in a ferment of excitement that Kazan had never before experienced; every nerve and fiber of his wonderful muscles was tense as steel wire. Quarter-strain wolf, three-quarters \"husky,\" he had lived the four years of his life in the wilderness. He had felt the pangs of starvation. He knew what it meant to freeze. He had listened to the wailing winds of the long Arctic night over the barrens. He had heard the thunder of the torrent and the cataract, and had cowered under the mighty crash of the storm. His throat and sides were scarred by battle, and his eyes were red with the blister of the snows. He was called Kazan, the Wild Dog, because he was a giant among his kind and as fearless, even, as the men who drove him through the perils of a frozen world.  He had never known fear--until now. He had never felt in him before the desire to _run_--not even on that terrible day in the forest when he had fought and killed the big gray lynx. He did not know what it was that frightened him, but he knew that he was in another world, and that many things in it startled and alarmed him. It was his first glimpse of civilization. He wished that his master would come back into the strange room where he had left him. It was a room filled with hideous things. There were great human faces on the wall, but they did not move or speak, but stared at him in a way he had never seen people look before. He remembered having looked on a master who lay very quiet and very cold in the snow, and he had sat back on his haunches and wailed forth the death song; but these people on the walls looked alive, and yet seemed dead.  Suddenly Kazan lifted his ears a little. He heard steps, then low voices. One of them was his master's voice. But the other--it sent a little tremor through him! Once, so long ago that it must have been in his puppyhood days, he seemed to have had a dream of a laugh that was like the girl's laugh--a laugh that was all at once filled with a wonderful happiness, the thrill of a wonderful love, and a sweetness that made Kazan lift his head as they came in. He looked straight at them, his red eyes gleaming. At once he knew that she must be dear to his master, for his master's arm was about her. In the glow of the light he saw that her hair was very bright, and that there was the color of the crimson _bakneesh_ vine in her face and the blue of the _bakneesh_ flower in her shining eyes. Suddenly she saw him, and with a little cry darted toward him.  \"Stop!\" shouted the man. \"He's dangerous! Kazan--\"  She was on her knees beside him, all fluffy and sweet and beautiful, her eyes shining wonderfully, her hands about to touch him. Should he cringe back? Should he snap? Was she one of the things on the wall, and his enemy? Should he leap at her white throat? He saw the man running forward, pale as death. Then her hand fell upon his head and the touch sent a thrill through him that quivered in every nerve of his body. With both hands she turned up his head. Her face was very close, and he heard her say, almost sobbingly:  \"And you are Kazan--dear old Kazan, my Kazan, my hero dog--who brought him home to me when all the others had died! My Kazan--my hero!\"  And then, miracle of miracles, her face was crushed down against him, and he felt her sweet warm touch.  In those moments Kazan did not move. He scarcely breathed. It seemed a long time before the girl lifted her face from him. And when she did, there were tears in her blue eyes, and the man was standing above them, his hands gripped tight, his jaws set.  \"I never knew him to let any one touch him--with their naked hand,\" he said in a tense wondering voice. \"Move back quietly, Isobel. Good heaven--look at that!\"  Kazan whined softly, his bloodshot eyes on the girl's face. He wanted to feel her hand again; he wanted to touch her face. Would they beat him with a club, he wondered, if he _dared_! He meant no harm now. He would kill for her. He cringed toward her, inch by inch, his eyes never faltering. He heard what the man said--\"Good heaven! Look at that!\"--and he shuddered. But no blow fell to drive him back. His cold muzzle touched her filmy dress, and she looked at him, without moving, her wet eyes blazing like stars.  \"See!\" she whispered. \"See!\"  Half an inch more--an inch, two inches, and he gave his big gray body a hunch toward her. Now his muzzle traveled slowly upward--over her foot, to her lap, and at last touched the warm little hand that lay there. His eyes were still on her face: he saw a queer throbbing in her bare white throat, and then a trembling of her lips as she looked up at the man with a wonderful look. He, too, knelt down beside them, and put his arm about the girl again, and patted the dog on his head. Kazan did not like the man's touch. He mistrusted it, as nature had taught him to mistrust the touch of all men's hands, but he permitted it because he saw that it in some way pleased the girl.  \"Kazan, old boy, you wouldn't hurt her, would you?\" said his master softly. \"We both love her, don't we, boy? Can't help it, can we? And she's ours, Kazan, all _ours_! She belongs to you and to me, and we're going to take care of her all our lives, and if we ever have to we'll fight for her like hell--won't we? Eh, Kazan, old boy?\"  For a long time after they left him where he was lying on the rug, Kazan's eyes did not leave the girl. He watched and listened--and all the time there grew more and more in him the craving to creep up to them and touch the girl's hand, or her dress, or her foot. After a time his master said something, and with a little laugh the girl jumped up and ran to a big, square, shining thing that stood crosswise in a corner, and which had a row of white teeth longer than his own body. He had wondered what those teeth were for. The girl's fingers touched them now, and all the whispering of winds that he had ever heard, all the music of the waterfalls and the rapids and the trilling of birds in spring-time, could not equal the sounds they made. It was his first music. For a moment it startled and frightened him, and then he felt the fright pass away and a strange tingling in his body. He wanted to sit back on his haunches and howl, as he had howled at the billion stars in the skies on cold winter nights. But something kept him from doing that. It was the girl. Slowly he began slinking toward her. He felt the eyes of the man upon him, and stopped. Then a little more--inches at a time, with his throat and jaw straight out along the floor! He was half-way to her--half-way across the room--when the wonderful sounds grew very soft and very low.  \"Go on!\" he heard the man urge in a low quick voice. \"Go on! Don't stop!\"  The girl turned her head, saw Kazan cringing there on the floor, and continued to play. The man was still looking, but his eyes could not keep Kazan back now. He went nearer, still nearer, until at last his outreaching muzzle touched her dress where it lay piled on the floor. And then--he lay trembling, for she had begun to sing. He had heard a Cree woman crooning in front of her tepee; he had heard the wild chant of the caribou song--but he had never heard anything like this wonderful sweetness that fell from the lips of the girl. He forgot his master's presence now. Quietly, cringingly, so that she would not know, he lifted his head. He saw her looking at him; there was something in her wonderful eyes that gave him confidence, and he laid his head in her lap. For the second time he felt the touch of a woman's hand, and he closed his eyes with a long sighing breath. The music stopped. There came a little fluttering sound above him, like a laugh and a sob in one. He heard his master cough.  \"I've always loved the old rascal--but I never thought he'd do that,\" he said; and his voice sounded queer to Kazan.     CHAPTER II  INTO THE NORTH   Wonderful days followed for Kazan. He missed the forests and deep snows. He missed the daily strife of keeping his team-mates in trace, the yapping at his heels, the straight long pull over the open spaces and the barrens. He missed the \"Koosh--koosh--Hoo-yah!\" of the driver, the spiteful snap of his twenty-foot caribou-gut whip, and that yelping and straining behind him that told him he had his followers in line. But something had come to take the place of that which he missed. It was in the room, in the air all about him, even when the girl or his master was not near. Wherever she had been, he found the presence of that strange thing that took away his loneliness. It was the woman scent, and sometimes it made him whine softly when the girl herself was actually with him. He was not lonely, nights, when he should have been out howling at the stars. He was not lonely, because one night he prowled about until he found a certain door, and "]]]
