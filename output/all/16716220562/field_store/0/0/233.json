If we do presume to offer this service, we should do it in the  manner appointed by himself, according to the conditions prescribed  in the prophet, \"Thou shalt swear, the Lord liveth, in truth, in  judgment, and in righteousness:\" in truth, taking heed that our  meaning be conformable to the sense of our words, and our words to  the verity of things; in judgment, having with careful deliberation  examined and weighed that which we assert or promise; in  righteousness, being satisfied in conscience that we do not therein  infringe any rule of piety toward God, of equity toward men, or  sobriety and discretion in regard to ourselves.  The cause of our swearing must be needful, or very expedient; the  design of it must be honest and useful to considerable purposes  (tending to God's honour, our neighbour's benefit, our own welfare);  the matter of it should be not only just and lawful, but worthy and  weighty; the manner ought to be grave and solemn, our mind being  framed to earnest attention, and endued with pious affections  suitable to the occasion.  Otherwise, if we do venture to swear, without due advice and care,  without much respect and awe, upon any slight or vain (not to say  bad or unlawful) occasion, we then desecrate swearing, and are  guilty of profaning a most sacred ordinance:  the doing so doth  imply base hypocrisy, or lewd mockery, or abominable wantonness and  folly; in bodily invading and vainly trifling with the most august  duties of religion.  Such swearing therefore is very dishonourable  and injurious to God, very prejudicial to religion, very repugnant  to piety.   III.  We may consider that the swearing prohibited is very noxious  to human society.  The great prop of society (which upholdeth the safety, peace, and  welfare thereof, in observing laws, dispensing justice, discharging  trusts, keeping contracts, and holding good correspondence mutually)  is conscience, or a sense of duty toward God, obliging to perform  that which is right and equal; quickened by hope of rewards and fear  of punishments from Him:  secluding which principle, no worldly  confederation is strong enough to hold men fast, or can further  dispose many to do right, or observe faith, or hold peace, than  appetite or interest, or humour (things very slippery and uncertain)  do sway them.  That men should live honestly, quietly, and comfortably together, it  is needful that they should live under a sense of God's will, and in  awe of the divine power, hoping to please God, and fearing to offend  Him, by their behaviour respectively.  That justice should be administered between men, it is necessary  that testimonies of fact be alleged; and that witnesses should  apprehend themselves greatly obliged to discover the truth,  according to their conscience, in dark and doubtful cases.  That men should uprightly discharge offices serviceable to public  good, it doth behove that they be firmly engaged to perform the  trusts reposed in them.  That in affairs of very considerable importance men should deal with  one another with satisfaction of mind, and mutual confidence, they  must receive competent assurances concerning the integrity,  fidelity, and constancy each of other.  That the safety of governors may be preserved, and the obedience due  to them maintained secure from attempts to which they are liable (by  the treachery, levity, perverseness, timorousness, ambition, all  such lusts and ill humours of men), it is expedient that men should  be tied with the strictest bands of allegiance.  That controversies emergent about the interests of men should be  determined, and an end put to strife by peremptory and satisfactory  means, is plainly necessary for common quiet.  Wherefore for the public interest and benefit of human society it is  requisite that the highest obligations possible should be laid upon  the consciences of men.  And such are those of oaths, engaging them to fidelity and constancy  in all such cases, out of regard to Almighty God, as the infallible  patron of truth and right, the unavoidable chastiser of  perfidiousness and improbity.  To such purposes, therefore, oaths have ever been applied, as the  most effectual instruments of working them; not only among the  followers of true and perfect religion, but even among all those who  had any glimmering notions concerning a Divine Power and Providence;  who have deemed an oath the fastest tie of conscience, and held the  violation of it for the most detestable impiety and iniquity.  So  that what Cicero saith of the Romans, that \"their ancestors had no  band to constrain faith more strait than an oath,\" is true of all  other nations, common reason not being able to devise any engagement  more obliging than it is; it being in the nature of things [Greek],  and [Greek], the utmost assurance, the last resort of human faith,  the surest pledge that any man can yield of his trustiness.  Hence  ever in transactions of highest moment this hath been used to bind  the faith of men.  Hereby nations have been wont to ratify leagues of peace and amity  between each other (which therefore the Greeks call [Greek]).  Hereby princes have obliged their subjects to loyalty:  and it hath  ever been the strongest argument to press that duty, which the  Preacher useth, \"I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and  that in regard of the oath of God.\"  Hereby generals have engaged their soldiers to stick close to them  in bearing hardships and encountering dangers.  Hereby the nuptial league hath been confirmed; the solemnisation  whereof in temples before God is in effect a most sacred oath.  Hereon the decision of the greatest causes concerning the lives,  estates, and reputations of men have depended; so that, as the  Apostle saith, \"an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all  strife.\"  Indeed, such hath the need hereof been ever apprehended, that we may  observe, in cases of great importance, no other obligation hath been  admitted for sufficient to bind the fidelity and constancy of the  most credible persons; so that even the best men hardly could trust  the best men without it.  For instance,  When Abimelech would assure to himself the friendship of Abraham,  although he knew him to be a very pious and righteous person, whose  word might be as well taken as any man's, yet, for entire  satisfaction, he thus spake to him:  \"God is with thee in all that  thou doest:  Now therefore swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt  not deal falsely with me.\"  Abraham, though he did much confide in the honesty of his servant  Eliezer, having entrusted him with all his estate, yet in the affair  concerning the marriage of his son he could not but thus oblige him:   \"Put,\" saith he, \"I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will  make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the  earth, that thou wilt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters  of the Canaanites.\"  Laban had good experience of Jacob's fidelity; yet that would not  satisfy, but, \"The Lord,\" said he, \"watch between me and thee, when  we are absent one from another. If thou shalt afflict my daughters,  or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is  with us; see, God is witness between thee and me.  The God of  Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge  betwixt us.\"  So did Jacob make Joseph swear that he would bury him in Canaan:   and Joseph caused the children of Israel to swear that they would  translate his bones.  So did Jonathan cause his beloved friend David  to swear that he would show kindness to him and to his house for  ever.  The prudence of which course the event showeth, the total  excision of Jonathan's family being thereby prevented; for \"the  king,\" 'tis said, \"spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, because  of the Lord's oath that was between them.\"  These instances declare that there is no security which men can  yield comparable to that of an oath; the obligation whereof no man  wilfully can infringe without renouncing the fear of God and any  pretence to His favour.  Wherefore human society will be extremely wronged and damnified by  the dissolving or slackening these most sacred bands of conscience;  and consequently by their common and careless use, which soon will  breed a contempt of them, and render them insignificant, either to  bind the swearers, or to ground a trust on their oaths.  As by the rare and reverent use of oaths their dignity is upheld and  their obligation kept fast, so by the frequent and negligent  application of them, by the prostituting them to every mean and  toyish purpose, their respect will be quite lost, their strength  will be loosed, they will prove unserviceable to public use.  If oaths generally become cheap and vile, what will that of  allegiance signify?  If men are wont to play with swearing anywhere,  can we expect they should be serious and strict therein at the bar  or in the church.  Will they regard God's testimony, or dread His  judgment, in one place, or at one time, when everywhere upon any,  upon no occasion they dare to confront and contemn them?  Who then  will be the more trusted for swearing?  What satisfaction will any  man have from it?  The rifeness of this practice, as it is the sign,  so it will be the cause of a general diffidence among man.  Incredible therefore is the mischief which this vain practice will  bring in to the public; depriving princes of their best security,  exposing the estates of private men to uncertainty, shaking all the  confidence men can have in the faith of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10274"],["title","Sermons on Evil-Speaking (#8)"],["body","another.  For which detriments accruing from this abuse to the public every  vain swearer is responsible; and he would do well to consider that  he will never be able to make reparation for them.  And the public  is much concerned that this enormity be retrenched.   IV.  Let us consider, that rash and vain swearing is very apt often  to bring the practiser of it into that most horrible sin of perjury.   For \"false swearing,\" as the Hebrew wise man saith, \"naturally  springeth out of much swearing:\" and, \"he,\" saith St. Chrysostom,  \"that sweareth continually, both willingly and unwillingly, both  ignorantly and knowingly, both in earnest and in sport, being often  transported by anger and many other things, will frequently  forswear.  It is confessed and manifest, that it is necessary for  him that sweareth much to be perjurious.\"  [Greek], \"For,\" saith he  again, \"it is impossible, it is impossible for a mouth addicted to  swearing not frequently to forswear.\"  He that sweareth at random,  as blind passion moveth, or wanton fancy prompteth, or the temper  suggesteth, often will hit upon asserting that which is false, or  promising that which is impossible:  that want of conscience and of  consideration which do suffer him to violate God's law in swearing  will betray him to the venting of lies, which backed with oaths  become perjuries.  If sometime what he sweareth doth happen to be  true and performable, it doth not free him of guilt; it being his  fortune, rather than his care or conscience, which keepeth him from  perjury.   V.  Such swearing commonly will induce a man to bind himself by oath  to unlawful practices; and consequently will entangle him in a  woeful necessity either of breaking his oath, or of doing worse, and  committing wickedness:  so that \"swearing,\" as St. Chrysostom saith,  \"hath this misery attending it, that, both trangressed and observed,  it plagueth those who are guilty of it.\"  Of this perplexity the Holy Scripture affordeth two notable  instances:  the one of Saul, forced to break his rash oaths; the  other of Herod, being engaged thereby to commit a most horrid  murder.  Had Saul observed his oaths, what injury had he done, what mischief  had he produced, in slaughtering his most worthy and most innocent  son, the prop and glory of his family, the bulwark of his country,  and the grand instrument of salvation to it; in forcing the people  to violate their cross oath, and for prevention of one, causing many  perjuries?  He was therefore fain to desist, and lie under the guilt  of breaking his oaths.  And for Herod, the excellent father thus presseth the consideration  of his case:  \"Take,\" saith he, \"I beseech you, the chopped off head  of St. John, and his warm blood yet trickling down; each of you bear  it home with you, and conceive that before your eyes you hear it  uttering speech, and saying, Embrace the murderer of me, an oath.   That which reproof did not, this an oath did do; that which the  tyrant's wrath could not, this the necessity of keeping an oath did  effect.  For when the tyrant was reprehended publicly in the  audience of all men, he bravely did bear the rebuke; but when he had  cast himself into the necessity of oaths, then did he cut off that  blessed head.\"   VI.  Likewise the use of rash swearing will often engage a man in  undertakings very inconvenient and detrimental to himself.  A man is  bound to perform his vows to the Lord, whatever they be, whatever  damage or trouble thence may accrue to him, if they be not unlawful.   It is the law, that which is gone out of thy lips, thou shalt keep  and perform.  It is the property of a good man, that he sweareth to  his own hurt, and changeth not.  Wherefore 'tis the part of a sober  man to be well advised what he doth swear or vow religiously, that  he do not put himself into the inextricable strait of committing  great sin, or undergoing great inconvenience; that he do not rush  into that snare of which the wise man speaketh, \"It is a snare to a  man to devour that which is holy (or, to swallow a sacred  obligation), and after vows to make inquiry,\" seeking how he may  disengage himself the doing which is a folly offensive to God, as  the Preacher telleth us.  \"When,\" saith he, \"thou vowest a vow unto  God, defer not to pay it; for He hath no pleasure in fools:  pay  that which thou hast vowed.\"  God will not admit our folly in vowing  as a plea for non-performance; He will exact it from us both as a  due debt, and as a proper punishment of our impious folly.  For instance, into what loss and mischief, what sorrow, what regret  and repentance, did the unadvised vow of Jephthah throw him; the  performance whereof, as St. Chrysostom remarketh, God did permit,  and order to be commemorated with solemn lamentation, that all  posterity might be admonished thereby, and deterred from such  precipitant swearing.   VII.  Let us consider that swearing is a sin of all others  peculiarly clamorous, and provocative of Divine judgment.  God is  hardly so much concerned, or in a manner constrained, to punish any  other sin as this.  He is bound in honour and interest to vindicate  His name from the abuse, His authority from the contempt, His holy  ordinance from the profanation, which it doth infer.  He is  concerned to take care that His providence be not questioned, that  the dread of His majesty be not voided, that all religion be not  overthrown by the outrageous commission thereof with impunity.  It immediately toucheth His name, it expressly calleth upon Him to  mind it, to judge it, to show himself in avenging it.  He may seem  deaf, or unconcerned, if, being so called and provoked, He doth not  declare Himself.  There is understood to be a kind of formal compact between Him and  mankind, obliging Him to interpose, to take the matter into His  cognisance, being specially addressed to Him.  The bold swearer doth importune Him to hear, doth rouse Him to mark,  doth brave Him to judge and punish his wickedness.  Hence no wonder that \"the flying roll,\" a quick and inevitable  curse, doth surprise the swearer, and cut him off, as it is in the  prophet.  No wonder that so many remarkable instances do occur in  history of signal vengeance inflicted on persons notably guilty of  this crime.  No wonder that a common practice thereof doth fetch  down public judgments; and that, as the prophets of old did  proclaim, \"because of swearing the land mourneth.\"   VIII.  Further (passing over the special laws against it, the  mischievous consequences of it, the sore punishments appointed to  it), we may consider, that to common sense vain swearing is a very  unreasonable and ill-favoured practice, greatly misbecoming any  sober, worthy, or honest person; but especially most absurd and  incongruous to a Christian.  For in ordinary conversation what needful or reasonable occasion can  intervene of violating this command?  If there come under discourse  a matter of reason, which is evidently true and certain, then what  need can there be of an oath to affirm it, it sufficing to expose it  to light, or to propose the evidences for it?  If an obscure or  doubtful point come to be debated, it will not bear an oath; it will  be a strange madness to dare, a great folly to hope the persuading  it thereby.  What were more ridiculous than to swear the truth of a  demonstrable theorem?  What more vain than so to assert a disputable  problem:  oaths (like wagers) are in such cases no arguments, except  silliness in the users of them.  If a matter of history be started, then if a man be taken for  honest, his word will pass for attestation without further  assurance; but if his veracity or probity be doubted, his oath will  not be relied on, especially when he doth obtrude it.  For it was no  less truly than acutely said by the old poet, [Greek], \"The man doth  not get credit from an oath, but an oath from the man.\"  And a  greater author, \"An oath,\" saith St. Chrysostom, \"doth not make a  man credible; but the testimony of his life, and the exactness of  his conversation, and a good repute.  Many often have burst with  swearing, and persuaded no man; others only nodding have deserved  more belief than those who swore so mightily.\"  Wherefore oaths, as  they are frivolous coming from a person of little worth or  conscience, so they are superfluous in the mouth of an honest and  worthy person; yea, as they do not increase the credit of the  former, so they may impair that of the latter.  \"A good man,\" as Socrates did say, \"should apparently so demean  himself, that his word may be deemed more credible than an oath;\"  the constant tenour of his practice vouching for it, and giving it  such weight, that no asseveration can further corroborate it.  He should [Greek], \"swear by his good deeds,\" and exhibit [Greek],  \"a life deserving belief,\" as Clemens Alex. saith:  so that no man  should desire more from him than his bare assertion; but willingly  should yield him the privilege which the Athenians granted to  Xenocrates, that he should testify without swearing.  He should be like the Essenes, of whom Josephus saith, that  everything spoken by them was more valid than an oath; whence they  declined swearing.  He should so much confide in his own veracity and fidelity, and so  much stand upon them, that he should not deign to offer any pledge  for them, implying them to want confirmation.  \"He should,\" as St. Jerome saith, \"so love truth, that he should  suppose himself to have sworn whatsoever he hath said;\" and  therefore should not be apt to heap another oath on his words.  Upon such accounts common reason directed even pagan wise men wholly  to interdict swearing in ordinary conversation, or about petty  matters, as an irrational and immoral practice, unworthy of sober  and discreet persons.  \"Forbear swearing about any matter,\" said  Plato, cited by Clem. Alex.  \"Avoid swearing, if you can, wholly,\"  said Epictetus.  \"For money swear by no"]]]
