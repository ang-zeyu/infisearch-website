I have planned this series of papers, therefore, on Sir Charles  Lyell's method.  I have begun by trying to teach a little about the  part of the earth's crust which lies nearest us, which we see most  often; namely, the soil; intending, if my readers do me the honour to  read the papers which follow, to lead them downward, as it were, into  the earth; deeper and deeper in each paper, to rocks and minerals  which are probably less known to them than the soil in the fields.   Thus you will find I shall lead you, or try to lead you on,  throughout the series, from the known to the unknown, and show you  how to explain the latter by the former.  Sir Charles Lyell has, I  see, in the new edition of his \"Student's Elements of Geology,\" begun  his book with the uppermost, that is, newest, strata, or layers; and  has gone regularly downwards in the course of the book to the lowest  or earliest strata; and I shall follow his plan.  I must ask you meanwhile to remember one law or rule, which seems to  me founded on common sense; namely, that the uppermost strata are  really almost always the newest; that when two or more layers,  whether of rock or earth--or indeed two stones in the street, or two  sheets on a bed, or two books on a table--any two or more lifeless  things, in fact, lie one on the other, then the lower one was most  probably put there first, and the upper one laid down on the lower.   Does that seem to you a truism?  Do I seem almost impertinent in  asking you to remember it?  So much the better.  I shall be saved  unnecessary trouble hereafter.  But some one may say, and will have a right to say, \"Stop--the lower  thing may have been thrust under the upper one.\"  Quite true:  and  therefore I said only that the lower one was most probably put there  first.  And I said \"most probably,\" because it is most probable that  in nature we should find things done by the method which costs least  force, just as you do them.  I will warrant that when you want to  hide a thing, you lay something down on it ten times for once that  you thrust it under something else.  You may say, \"What?  When I want  to hide a paper, say, under the sofa-cover, do I not thrust it  under?\"  No, you lift up the cover, and slip the paper in, and let the cover  fall on it again.  And so, even in that case, the paper has got into  its place first.  Now why is this?  Simply because in laying one thing on another you  only move weight.  In thrusting one thing under another, you have not  only to move weight, but to overcome friction.  That is why you do  it, though you are hardly aware of it:  simply because so you employ  less force, and take less trouble.  And so do clays and sands and stones.  They are laid down on each  other, and not thrust under each other, because thus less force is  expended in getting them into place.  There are exceptions.  There are cases in which nature does try to  thrust one rock under another.  But to do that she requires a force  so enormous, compared with what is employed in laying one rock on  another, that (so to speak) she continually fails; and instead of  producing a volcanic eruption, produces only an earthquake.  Of that  I may speak hereafter, and may tell you, in good time, how to  distinguish rocks which have been thrust in from beneath, from rocks  which have been laid down from above, as every rock between London  and Birmingham or Exeter has been laid down.  That I only assert now.   But I do not wish you to take it on trust from me.  I wish to prove  it to you as I go on, or to do what is far better for you:  to put  you in the way of proving it for yourself, by using your common  sense.  At the risk of seeming prolix, I must say a few more words on this  matter.  I have special reasons for it.  Until I can get you to \"let  your thoughts play freely\" round this question of the superposition  of soils and rocks, there will be no use in my going on with these  papers.  Suppose then (to argue from the known to the unknown) that you were  watching men cleaning out a pond.  Atop, perhaps, they would come to  a layer of soft mud, and under that to a layer of sand.  Would not  common sense tell you that the sand was there first, and that the  water had laid down the mud on the top of it?  Then, perhaps, they  might come to a layer of dead leaves.  Would not common sense tell  you that the leaves were there before the sand above them?  Then,  perhaps, to a layer of mud again.  Would not common sense tell you  that the mud was there before the leaves?  And so on down to the  bottom of the pond, where, lastly, I think common sense would tell  you that the bottom of the pond was there already, before all the  layers which were laid down on it.  Is not that simple common sense?  Then apply that reasoning to the soils and rocks in any spot on  earth.  If you made a deep boring, and found, as you would in many  parts of this kingdom, that the boring, after passing through the  soil of the field, entered clays or loose sands, you would say the  clays were there before the soil.  If it then went down into  sandstone, you would say--would you not?--that sandstone must have  been here before the clay; and however thick--even thousands of feet- -it might be, that would make no difference to your judgment.  If  next the boring came into quite different rocks; into a different  sort of sandstone and shales, and among them beds of coal, would you  not say--These coal-beds must have been here before the sandstones?   And if you found in those coal-beds dead leaves and stems of plants,  would you not say--Those plants must have been laid down here before  the layers above them, just as the dead leaves in the pond were?  If you then came to a layer of limestone, would you not say the same?   And if you found that limestone full of shells and corals, dead, but  many of them quite perfect, some of the corals plainly in the very  place in which they grew, would you not say--These creatures must  have lived down here before the coal was laid on top of them?  And  if, lastly, below the limestone you came to a bottom rock quite  different again, would you not say--The bottom rock must have been  here before the rocks on the top of it?  And if that bottom rock rose up a few miles off, two thousand feet,  or any other height, into hills, what would you say then?  Would you  say:  \"Oh, but the rock is not bottom rock; is not under the  limestone here, but higher than it.  So perhaps in this part it has  made a shift, and the highlands are younger than the lowlands; for  see, they rise so much higher?\"  Would not that be as wise as to say  that the bottom of the pond was not there before the pond mud,  because the banks round the pond rose higher than the mud?  Now for the soil of the field.  If we can understand a little about it, what it is made of, and how  it got there, we shall perhaps be on the right road toward  understanding what all England--and, indeed, the crust of this whole  planet--is made of; and how its rocks and soils got there.  But we shall best understand how the soil in the field was made, by  reasoning, as I have said, from the known to the unknown.  What do I  mean?  This:  On the uplands are fields in which the soil is already  made.  You do not know how?  Then look for a field in which the soil  is still being made.  There are plenty in every lowland.  Learn how  it is being made there; apply the knowledge which you learn from them  to the upland fields which are already made.  If there is, as there usually is, a river-meadow, or still better, an  aestuary, near your town, you have every advantage for seeing soil  made.  Thousands of square feet of fresh-made soil spread between  your town and the sea; thousands more are in process of being made.  You will see now why I have begun with the soil in the field; because  it is the uppermost, and therefore latest, of all the layers; and  also for this reason, that, if Sir Charles Lyell's theory be true--as  it is--then the soils and rocks below the soil of the field may have  been made in the very same way in which the soil of the field is  made.  If so, it is well worth our while to examine it.  You all know from whence the soil comes which has filled up, in the  course of ages, the great aestuaries below London, Stirling, Chester,  or Cambridge.  It is river mud and sand.  The river, helped by tributary brooks  right and left, has brought down from the inland that enormous mass.   You know that.  You know that every flood and freshet brings a fresh  load, either of fine mud or of fine sand, or possibly some of it  peaty matter out of distant hills.  Here is one indisputable fact  from which to start.  Let us look for another.  How does the mud get into the river?  The rain carries it thither.  If you wish to learn the first elements of geology by direct  experiment, do this:  The next rainy day--the harder it rains the  better--instead of sitting at home over the fire, and reading a book  about geology, put on a macintosh and thick boots, and get away, I  care not whither, provided you can find there running water.  If you  have not time to get away to a hilly country, then go to the nearest  bit of turnpike road, or the nearest sloping field, and see in little  how whole continents are made, and unmade again.  Watch the rain  raking and sifting with its million delicate fingers, separating the  finer particles from the coarser, dropping the latter as soon as it  can, and carrying the former downward with it toward the sea.  Follow  the nearest roadside drain where it runs into a pond, and see how it  drops the pebbles the moment it enters the pond, and then the sand in  a fan-shaped heap at the nearest end; but carries the fine mud on,  and holds it suspended, to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],["title","Town Geology (#6)"],["body","deposited at the bottom in  the still water; and say to yourself:  Perhaps the sands which cover  so many inland tracts were dropped by water, very near the shore of a  lake or sea, and by rapid currents.  Perhaps, again, the brick clays,  which are often mingled with these sands, were dropped, like the mud  in the pond, in deeper water farther from the shore, and certainly in  stilt water.  But more.  Suppose once more, then, that looking and  watching a pond being cleared out, under the lowest layer of mud, you  found--as you would find in any of those magnificent reservoirs so  common in the Lancashire hills--a layer of vegetable soil, with grass  and brushwood rooted in it.  What would you say but:  The pond has  not been always full.  It has at some time or other been dry enough  to let a whole copse grow up inside it?  And if you found--as you will actually find along some English  shores--under the sand hills, perhaps a bed of earth with shells and  bones; under that a bed of peat; under that one of blue silt; under  that a buried forest, with the trees upright and rooted; under that  another layer of blue silt full of roots and vegetable fibre; perhaps  under that again another old land surface with trees again growing in  it; and under all the main bottom clay of the district--what would  common sense tell you?  I leave you to discover for yourselves.  It  certainly would not tell you that those trees were thrust in there by  a violent convulsion, or that all those layers were deposited there  in a few days, or even a few years; and you might safely indulge in  speculations about the antiquity of the aestuary, and the changes  which it has undergone, with which I will not frighten you at  present.  It will be fair reasoning to argue thus.  You may not be always right  in your conclusion, but still you will be trying fairly to explain  the unknown by the known.  But have Rain and Rivers alone made the soil?  How very much they have done toward making it you will be able to  judge for yourselves, if you will read the sixth chapter of Sir  Charles Lyell's new \"Elements of Geology,\" or the first hundred pages  of that admirable book, De la Beche's \"Geological Observer;\" and  last, but not least, a very clever little book called \"Rain and  Rivers,\" by Colonel George Greenwood.  But though rain, like rivers, is a carrier of soil, it is more.  It  is a maker of soil, likewise; and by it mainly the soil of an upland  field is made, whether it be carried down to the sea or not.  If you will look into any quarry you will see that however compact  the rock may be a few feet below the surface, it becomes, in almost  every case, rotten and broken up as it nears the upper soil, till you  often cannot tell where the rock ends and the soil begins.  Now this change has been produced by rain.  First, mechanically, by  rain in the shape of ice.  The winter rain gets into the ground, and  does by the rock what it has done by the stones of many an old  building.  It sinks into the porous stone, freezes there, expands in  freezing, and splits and peels the stone with a force which is slowly  but surely crumbling the whole of Northern Europe and America to  powder.  Do you doubt me?  I say nothing but what you can judge of yourselves.   The next time you go up any mountain, look at the loose broken stones  with which the top is coated, just underneath the turf.  What has  broken them up but frost?  Look again, as stronger proof, at the  talus of broken stones--screes, as they call them in Scotland;  rattles, as we call them in Devon--which lie along the base of many  mountain cliffs.  What has brought them down but frost?  If you ask  the country folk they will tell you whether I am right or not.  If  you go thither, not in the summer, but just after the winter's frost,  you will see for yourselves, by the fresh frost-crop of newly-broken  bits, that I am right.  Possibly you may find me to be even more  right than is desirable, by having a few angular stones, from the  size of your head to that of your body, hurled at you by the frost- giants up above.  If you go to the Alps at certain seasons, and hear  the thunder of the falling rocks, and see their long lines--moraines,  as they are called--sliding slowly down upon the surface of the  glacier, then you will be ready to believe the geologist who tells  you that frost, and probably frost alone, has hewn out such a peak as  the Matterhorn from some vast table-land; and is hewing it down  still, winter after winter, till some day, where the snow Alps now  stand, there shall be rolling uplands of rich cultivable soil.  So much for the mechanical action of rain, in the shape of ice.  Now  a few words on its chemical action.  Rain water is seldom pure.  It carries in it carbonic acid; and that  acid, beating in shower after shower against the face of a cliff-- especially if it be a limestone cliff--weathers the rock chemically;  changing (in case of limestone) the insoluble carbonate of lime into  a soluble bicarbonate, and carrying that away in water, which,  however clear, is still hard.  Hard water is usually water which has  invisible lime in it; there are from ten to fifteen grains and more  of lime in every gallon of limestone water.  I leave you to calculate  the enormous weight of lime which must be so carried down to the sea  every year by a single limestone or chalk brook.  You can calculate  it, if you like, by ascertaining the weight of lime in each gallon,  and the average quantity of water which comes down the stream in a  day; and when your sum is done, you will be astonished to find it one  not of many pounds, but probably of many tons, of solid lime, which  you never suspected or missed from the hills around.  Again, by the  time the rain has sunk through the soil, it is still less pure.  It  carries with it not only carbonic acid, but acids produced by  decaying vegetables--by the roots of the grasses and trees which grow  above; and they dissolve the cement of the rock by chemical action,  especially if the cement be lime or iron.  You may see this for  yourselves, again and again.  You may see how the root of a tree,  penetrating the earth, discolours the soil with which it is in  contact.  You may see how the whole rock, just below the soil, has  often changed in colour from the compact rock below, if the soil be  covered with a dense layer of peat or growing vegetables.  But there is another force at work, and quite as powerful as rain and  rivers, making the soil of alluvial flats.  Perhaps it has helped,  likewise, to make the soil of all the lowlands in these isles--and  that is, the waves of the sea.  If you ever go to Parkgate, in Cheshire, try if you cannot learn  there a little geology.  Walk beyond the town.  You find the shore protected for a long way by  a sea-wall, lest it should be eaten away by the waves.  What the  force of those waves can be, even on that sheltered coast, you may  judge--at least you could have judged this time last year--by the  masses of masonry torn from their iron clampings during the gale of  three winters since.  Look steadily at those rolled blocks, those  twisted stanchions, if they are there still; and then ask yourselves- -it will be fair reasoning from the known to the unknown--What effect  must such wave-power as that have had beating and breaking for  thousands of years along the western coasts of England, Scotland,  Ireland?  It must have eaten up thousands of acres--whole shires, may  be, ere now.  Its teeth are strong enough, and it knows neither rest  nor pity, the cruel hungry sea.  Give it but time enough, and what  would it not eat up?  It would eat up, in the course of ages, all the  dry land of this planet, were it not baffled by another counteracting  force, of which I shall speak hereafter.  As you go on beyond the sea-wall, you find what it is eating up.  The  whole low cliff is going visibly.  But whither is it going?  To form  new soil in the aestuary.  Now you will not wonder how old harbours  so often become silted up.  The sea has washed the land into them.   But more, the sea-currents do not allow the sands of the aestuary to  escape freely out to sea.  They pile it up in shifting sand-banks  about the mouth of the aestuary.  The prevailing sea-winds, from  whatever quarter, catch up the sand, and roll it up into sand-hills.   Those sand-hills are again eaten down by the sea, and mixed with the  mud of the tide-flats, and so is formed a mingled soil, partly of  clayey mud, partly of sand; such a soil as stretches over the greater  part of all our lowlands.  Now, why should not that soil, whether in England or in Scotland,  have been made by the same means as that of every aestuary.  You find over great tracts of East Scotland, Lancashire, Norfolk,  etc., pure loose sand just beneath the surface, which looks as if it  was blown sand from a beach.  Is it not reasonable to suppose that it  is?  You find rising out of many lowlands, crags which look exactly  like old sea-cliffs eaten by the waves, from the base of which the  waters have gone back.  Why should not those crags be old sea-cliffs?   Why should we not, following our rule of explaining the unknown by  the known, assume that such they are till someone gives us a sound  proof that they are not; and say--These great plains of England and  Scotland were probably once covered by a shallow sea, and their soils  made as the soil of any tide-flat is being made now?  But you may say, and most reasonably \"The tide-flats are just at the  sea-level.  The whole of the lowland is many feet above the sea; it  must therefore have been raised out of the sea, according to your  theory:  and what proofs have you of that?\"  Well, that is a question both grand and deep, on which I shall not  enter yet; but meanwhile, to satisfy you that I wish to play fair  with you, I ask you to believe nothing but what you can prove for  yourselves.  Let me ask you"]]]
