APPENDIX     Paradiso: Canto I   The glory of Him who moveth everything     Doth penetrate the universe, and shine     In one part more and in another less.  Within that heaven which most his light receives     Was I, and things beheld which to repeat     Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;  Because in drawing near to its desire     Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,     That after it the memory cannot go.  Truly whatever of the holy realm     I had the power to treasure in my mind     Shall now become the subject of my song.  O good Apollo, for this last emprise     Make of me such a vessel of thy power     As giving the beloved laurel asks!  One summit of Parnassus hitherto     Has been enough for me, but now with both     I needs must enter the arena left.  Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe     As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw     Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.  O power divine, lend’st thou thyself to me     So that the shadow of the blessed realm     Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,  Thou’lt see me come unto thy darling tree,     And crown myself thereafter with those leaves     Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.  So seldom, Father, do we gather them     For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,     (The fault and shame of human inclinations,)  That the Peneian foliage should bring forth     Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,     When any one it makes to thirst for it.  A little spark is followed by great flame;     Perchance with better voices after me     Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!  To mortal men by passages diverse     Uprises the world’s lamp; but by that one     Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,  With better course and with a better star     Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax     Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.  Almost that passage had made morning there     And evening here, and there was wholly white     That hemisphere, and black the other part,  When Beatrice towards the left-hand side     I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;     Never did eagle fasten so upon it!  And even as a second ray is wont     To issue from the first and reascend,     Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,  Thus of her action, through the eyes infused     In my imagination, mine I made,     And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.  There much is lawful which is here unlawful     Unto our powers, by virtue of the place     Made for the human species as its own.  Not long I bore it, nor so little while     But I beheld it sparkle round about     Like iron that comes molten from the fire;  And suddenly it seemed that day to day     Was added, as if He who has the power     Had with another sun the heaven adorned.  With eyes upon the everlasting wheels     Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her     Fixing my vision from above removed,  Such at her aspect inwardly became     As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him     Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.  To represent transhumanise in words     Impossible were; the example, then, suffice     Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.  If I was merely what of me thou newly     Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,     Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!  When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal     Desiring thee, made me attentive to it     By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,  Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled     By the sun’s flame, that neither rain nor river     E’er made a lake so widely spread abroad.  The newness of the sound and the great light     Kindled in me a longing for their cause,     Never before with such acuteness felt;  Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,     To quiet in me my perturbed mind,     Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,  And she began: “Thou makest thyself so dull     With false imagining, that thou seest not     What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.  Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;     But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,     Ne’er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.”  If of my former doubt I was divested     By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,     I in a new one was the more ensnared;  And said: “Already did I rest content     From great amazement; but am now amazed     In what way I transcend these bodies light.”  Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,     Her eyes directed tow’rds me with that look     A mother casts on a delirious child;  And she began: “All things whate’er they be     Have order among themselves, and this is form,     That makes the universe resemble God.  Here do the higher creatures see the footprints     Of the Eternal Power, which is the end     Whereto is made the law already mentioned.  In the order that I speak of are inclined     All natures, by their destinies diverse,     More or less near unto their origin;  Hence they move onward unto ports diverse     O’er the great sea of being; and each one     With instinct given it which bears it on.  This bears away the fire towards the moon;     This is in mortal hearts the motive power     This binds together and unites the earth.  Nor only the created things that are     Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,     But those that have both intellect and love.  The Providence that regulates all this     Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,     Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.  And thither now, as to a site decreed,     Bears us away the virtue of that cord     Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.  True is it, that as oftentimes the form     Accords not with the intention of the art,     Because in answering is matter deaf,  So likewise from this course doth deviate     Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,     Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,  (In the same wise as one may see the fire     Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus     Earthward is wrested by some false delight.  Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,     At thine ascent, than at a rivulet     From some high mount descending to the lowland.  Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived     Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,     As if on earth the living fire were quiet.”  Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.     Paradiso: Canto II   O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,     Eager to listen, have been following     Behind my ship, that singing sails along,  Turn back to look again upon your shores;     Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,     In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.  The sea I sail has never yet been passed;     Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,     And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.  Ye other few who have the neck uplifted     Betimes to th’ bread of Angels upon which     One liveth here and grows not sated by it,  Well may you launch"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1003"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Paradise (#1)"],["body","the deep salt-sea     Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you     Upon the water that grows smooth again.  Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed     Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,     When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!  The con-created and perpetual thirst     For the realm deiform did bear us on,     As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.  Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;     And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt     And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,  Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing     Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she     From whom no care of mine could be concealed,  Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,     Said unto me: “Fix gratefully thy mind     On God, who unto the first star has brought us.”  It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,     Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright     As adamant on which the sun is striking.  Into itself did the eternal pearl     Receive us, even as water doth receive     A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.  If I was body, (and we here conceive not     How one dimension tolerates another,     Which needs must be if body enter body,)  More the desire should be enkindled in us     That essence to behold, wherein is seen     How God and our own nature were united.  There will be seen what we receive by faith,     Not demonstrated, but self-evident     In guise of the first truth that man believes.  I made reply: “Madonna, as devoutly     As most I can do I give thanks to Him     Who has removed me from the mortal world.  But tell me what the dusky spots may be     Upon this body, which below on earth     Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?”  Somewhat she smiled; and then, “If the opinion     Of mortals be erroneous,” she said,     “Where’er the key of sense doth not unlock,  Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee     Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,     Thou seest that the reason has short wings.  But tell me what thou think’st of it thyself.”     And I: “What seems to us up here diverse,     Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.”  And she: “Right truly shalt thou see immersed     In error thy belief, if well thou hearest     The argument that I shall make against it.  Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you     Which in their quality and quantity     May noted be of aspects different.  If this were caused by rare and dense alone,     One only virtue would there be in all     Or more or less diffused, or equally.  Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits     Of formal principles; and these, save one,     Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.  Besides, if rarity were of this dimness     The cause thou askest, either through and through     This planet thus attenuate were of matter,  Or else, as in a body is apportioned     The fat and lean, so in like manner this     Would in its volume interchange the leaves.  Were it the former, in the sun’s eclipse     It would be manifest by the shining through     Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.  This is not so; hence we must scan the other,     And if it chance the other I demolish,     Then falsified will thy opinion be.  But if this rarity go not through and through,     There needs must be a limit, beyond which     Its contrary prevents the further passing,  And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,     Even as a colour cometh back from glass,     The which behind itself concealeth lead.  Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself     More dimly there than in the other parts,     By being there reflected farther back.  From this reply experiment will free thee     If e’er thou try it, which is wont to be     The fountain to the rivers of your arts.  Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove     Alike from thee, the other more remote     Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.  Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back     Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors     And coming back to thee by all reflected.  Though in its quantity be not so ample     The image most remote, there shalt thou see     How it perforce is equally resplendent.  Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays     Naked the subject of the snow remains     Both of its former colour and its cold,  Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,     Will I inform with such a living light,     That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.  Within the heaven of the divine repose     Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies     The being of whatever it contains.  The following heaven, that has so many eyes,     Divides this being by essences diverse,     Distinguished from it, and by it contained.  The other spheres, by various differences,     All the distinctions which they have within them     Dispose unto their ends and their effects.  Thus do these organs of the world proceed,     As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;     Since from above they take, and act beneath.  Observe me well, how through this place I come     Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter     Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford  The power and motion of the holy spheres,     As from the artisan the hammer’s craft,     Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.  The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,     From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,     The image takes, and makes of it a seal.  And even as the soul within your dust     Through members different and accommodated     To faculties diverse expands itself,  So likewise this Intelligence diffuses     Its virtue multiplied among the stars.     Itself revolving on its unity.  Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage     Make with the precious body that it quickens,     In which, as life in you, it is combined.  From the glad nature whence it is derived,     The mingled virtue through the body shines,     Even as gladness through the living pupil.  From this proceeds whate’er from light to light     Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:     This is the formal principle that produces,  According to its goodness, dark and bright.”     Paradiso: Canto III   That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,     Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,     By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.  And, that I might confess myself convinced     And confident, so far as was befitting,     I lifted more erect my head to speak.  But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me     So close to it, in order to be seen,     That my confession I remembered not.  Such as through polished and transparent glass,     Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,     But not so deep as that their bed be lost,  Come back again the outlines of our faces     So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white     Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;  Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,     So that I ran in error opposite     To that which kindled love ’twixt man and fountain.  As soon as I became aware of them,     Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,     To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,  And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward     Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,     Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.  “Marvel thou not,” she said to me, “because     I smile at this thy puerile conceit,     Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,  But turns thee, as ’tis wont, on emptiness.     True substances are these which thou beholdest,     Here relegate for breaking of some vow.  Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;     For the true light, which giveth peace to them,     Permits them not to turn from it their feet.”  And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful     To speak directed me, and I began,     As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:  “O well-created spirit, who in the rays     Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste     Which being untasted ne’er is comprehended,  Grateful ’twill be to me, if thou content me     Both with thy name and with your destiny.”     Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:  “Our charity doth never shut the doors     Against a just desire, except as one     Who wills that all her court be like herself.  I was a virgin sister in the world;     And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,     The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,  But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,     Who, stationed here among these other blessed,     Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.  All our affections, that alone inflamed     Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,     Rejoice at being of his order formed;  And this allotment, which appears so low,     Therefore is given us, because our vows     Have been neglected and in some part void.”  Whence I to her: “In your miraculous aspects     There shines I know not what of the divine,     Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.  Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;     But what thou tellest me now aids me so,     That the refiguring is easier to me.  But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,     Are you desirous of a higher place,     To see more or to make yourselves more friends?”  First with those other shades she smiled a little;     Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,     She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:  “Brother, our will is quieted by virtue     Of charity, that makes us wish alone     For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.  If to be more exalted we aspired,     Discordant would our aspirations be     Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;  Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,     If being in charity is needful here,     And if thou lookest well into its nature;  Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence     To keep itself within the will divine,     Whereby our very wishes are made one;  So that, as we are station above station     Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,     As to the King, who makes his will our will.  And his will is our peace; this "]]]
