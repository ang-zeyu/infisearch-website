Oh, deary me, what _shall_ I do! what shall I do!\"  \"Shall I tell you, ma'am?\" asked Van, gently, for, though she was a very provoking old lady, he pitied and wished to help her.  A nod and a gurgle seemed to give consent, and, boldly advancing, Van said, with blush and a stammer, but a very hearty voice,--  \"I think, ma'am, if you'd do the right thing with your money you'd be at ease and find it saved a deal of worry all round. Give it to Mrs. Snow; she deserves it, poor lady, for she's had a hard time, and done her duty faithfully. Don't wait till you are--that is, till you--well, till you in point of fact die, ma'am. Give it now, and enjoy the happiness it will make. Give it kindly, let them see you're glad to do it, and I am sure you'll find them grateful; I'm sure you won't be lonely any more, or feel that you are not loved and thanked. Try it, ma'am, just try it,\" cried Van, getting excited by the picture he drew. \"And I give you my word I'll do my best to respect and love you like a son, ma'am.\"  He knew that he was promising a great deal, but for Polly's sake he felt that he could make even that Herculean effort. Aunt Kipp was surprised and touched; but the contrary old lady couldn't make up her mind to yield so soon, and wouldn't have done it if Toady hadn't taken her by storm. Having a truly masculine horror of tears, a very tender heart under his tailless jacket, and being much \"tumbled up and down in his own mind\" by the events of the week, the poor little lad felt nerved to attempt any novel enterprise, even that of voluntarily embracing Aunt Kipp. First a grimy little hand came on her shoulder, as she sat sniffing behind the handkerchief; then, peeping out, she saw an apple-cheeked face very near her own, with eyes full of pity, penitence, and affection; and then she heard a choky little voice say earnestly,--  \"Don't cry, aunty; I'm sorry I was rude. Please be good to Mother and Polly, and I'll love and take care of you, and stand by you all my life. Yes, I'll--I'll _kiss_ you, I will, by George!\" And with one promiscuous plunge the Spartan boy cast himself into her arms.  That finished Aunt Kipp; she hugged him dose, and cried out with a salute that went off like a pistol-shot,--  \"Oh, my dear, my dear! this is better than a dozen cherakins!\"  When Toady emerged, somewhat flushed and tumbled, Mrs. Snow, Polly, and Van were looking on with faces full of wonder, doubt, and satisfaction. To be an object of interest was agreeable to Aunt Kipp; and, as her old heart was really softened, she met them with a gracious smile, and extended the olive-branch generally.  \"Sophy, I shall give my money to _you_ at once and entirely, only asking that you'll let me stay with you when Polly's gone. I'll do my best to be agreeable, and you'll bear with me because I'm a cranky, solitary old woman, and I loved your husband.\"  Mrs. Snow hugged her on the spot, and gushed, of course, murmuring thanks, welcomes, and promises in one grateful burst.  \"Polly, I forgive you; I consent to your marriage, and will provide your wedding finery. Mr. Lamb, you are not a fool, but a very excellent young man. I thank you for saving my life, and I wish you well with all my heart. You needn't say anything. I'm far from strong, and all this agitation is shortening my life.\"  Polly and Van shook her hand heartily, and beamed upon each other like a pair of infatuated turtle-doves with good prospects.  \"Toady, you are as near an angel as a boy can be. Put a name to whatever you most wish for in the world, and it's yours,\" said Aunt Kipp, dramatically waving the rest away.  With his short legs wide apart, his hands behind him, and his rosy face as round and radiant as a rising sun, Toady stood before the fire surveying the scene with the air of a man who has successfully carried through a difficult and dangerous undertaking, and wasn't proud. His face brightened, then fell, as he heaved a sigh, and answered, with a shake of his curly head,--  \"You can't give me what I want most. There are three things, and I've got to wait for them all.\"  \"Gracious me, what are they?\" cried the old lady, good-naturedly, for she felt better already.  \"A mustache, a beaver, _and_ a sweetheart,\" answered Toady, with his eyes fixed wistfully on Baa-baa, who possessed all these blessings, and was particularly enjoying the latter at that moment.  How Aunt Kipp did laugh at this early budding of romance in her pet! And all the rest joined her, for Toady's sentimental air was irresistible.  \"You precocious chick! I dare say you will have them all before we know where we are. Never mind, deary; you shall have my little watch, and the silver-headed cane with a _boar's_ head on it,\" answered the old lady, in high good-humor. \"You needn't blush, dear; I don't bear malice; so let's forget and forgive. I shall settle things to-morrow, and have a free mind. You are welcome to my money, and I hope I shall live to see you all enjoy it.\"  So she did; for she lived to see Sophy plump, cheery, and care-free; Polly surrounded by a flock of Lambkins; Van in possession of a generous slice of the Van Bahr fortune; Toady revelling in the objects of his desire; and, best of all, she lived to find that it is never too late to make oneself useful, happy, and beloved.     PSYCHE'S ART  \"Handsome is that handsome does.\"   I   Once upon a time there raged in a certain city one of those fashionable epidemics which occasionally attack our youthful population. It wasn't the music mania, nor gymnastic convulsions, nor that wide-spread malady, croquet. Neither was it one of the new dances which, like a tarantula-bite, set every one a twirling, nor stage madness, nor yet that American lecturing influenza which yearly sweeps over the land. No, it was a new disease called the Art fever, and it attacked the young women of the community with great violence.  Nothing but time could cure it, and it ran its course to the dismay, amusement, or edification of the beholders, for its victims did all manner of queer things in their delirium. They begged potteries for clay, drove Italian plaster-corkers out of their wits with unexecutable orders got neuralgia and rheumatism sketching perched on fences and trees like artistic hens, and caused a rise in the price of bread, paper, and charcoal, by their ardor in crayoning. They covered canvas with the expedition of scene-painters, had classes, lectures, receptions, and exhibitions, made models of each other, and rendered their walls hideous with bad likenesses of all their friends. Their conversation ceased to be intelligible to the uninitiated, and they prattled prettily of \"chiaro oscuro, French sauce, refraction of the angle of the eye, seventh spinus process, depth and juiciness of color, tender touch, and a good tone.\" Even in dress the artistic disorder was visible; some cast aside crinoline altogether, and stalked about with a severe simplicity of outline worthy of Flaxman. Others flushed themselves with scarlet, that no landscape which they adorned should be without some touch of Turner's favorite tint. Some were _blue_ in every sense of the word, and the heads of all were adorned with classic braids, curls tied Hebe-wise, or hair dressed a la hurricane.  It was found impossible to keep them safe at home, and, as the fever grew, these harmless maniacs invaded the sacred retreats where artists of the other sex did congregate, startling those anchorites with visions of large-eyed damsels bearing portfolios in hands delicately begrimed with crayon, chalk, and clay, gliding through the corridors hitherto haunted only by shabby paletots, shadowy hats, and cigar smoke. This irruption was borne with manly fortitude, not to say cheerfulness, for studio doors stood hospitably open as the fair invaders passed, and studies from life were generously offered them in glimpses of picturesque gentlemen posed before easels, brooding over master-pieces in \"a divine despair,\" or attitudinizing upon couches as if exhausted by the soarings of genius.  An atmosphere of romance began to pervade the old buildings when the girls came, and nature and art took turns. There were peepings and whisperings, much stifled laughter and whisking in and out; not to mention the accidental rencontres, small services, and eye telegrams, which somewhat lightened the severe studies of all parties.  Half a dozen young victims of this malady met daily in one of the cells of a great art beehive called \"Raphael's Rooms,\" and devoted their shining hours to modelling fancy heads, gossiping the while; for the poor things found the road to fame rather dull and dusty without such verbal sprinklings.  \"Psyche Dean, you've had an adventure! I see it in your face; so tell it at once, for we are stupid as owls here to-day,\" cried one of the sisterhood, as a bright-eyed girl entered with some precipitation.  \"I dropped my portfolio, and a man picked it up, that's all.\" replied Psyche, hurrying on her gray linen pinafore.  \"That won't do; I know something interesting happened, for you've been blushing, and you look brisker than usual this morning,\" said the first speaker, polishing off the massive nose of her Homer.  \"It wasn't anything,\" began Psyche a little reluctantly. \"I was coming up in a hurry when I ran against a man coming down in a hurry. My portfolio slipped, and my papers went flying all about the landing. Of course we both laughed and begged pardon, and I began to pick them up, but he wouldn't let me; so I held the book while he collected the sketches. I saw him glance at them as he did so, and that made me blush, for they are wretched things, you know.\"  \"Not a bit of it; they are capital, and you are a regular genius, as we all agree,\" cut in the Homeric Miss Cutter.  \"Never tell people they are geniuses unless you wish to spoil them,\" returned Psyche severely. \"Well, when the portfolio was put to rights I was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10360"],["title","Kitty's Class Day and Other Stories (#8)"],["body"," on, but he fell to picking up a little bunch of violets I had dropped; you know I always wear a posy into town to give me inspiration. I didn't care for the dusty flowers, and told him so, and hurried away before any one came. At the top of the stairs I peeped over the railing, and there he was, gathering up every one of those half-dead violets as carefully as if they had been tea-roses.\"  \"Psyche Dean, you have met your fate this day!\" exclaimed a third damsel, with straw-colored tresses, and a good deal of weedy shrubbery in her hat, which gave an Ophelia-like expression to her sentimental countenance.  Psyche frowned and shook her head, as if half sorry she had told her little story.  \"Was he handsome?\" asked Miss Larkins, the believer in fate.  \"I didn't particularly observe.\"  \"It was the red-headed man, whom we call Titian: he's always on the stairs.\"  \"No, it wasn't; his hair was brown and curly,\" cried Psyche, innocently falling into the trap.  \"Like Peerybingle's baby when its cap was taken off,\" quoted Miss Dickenson, who pined to drop the last two letters of her name.  \"Was it Murillo, the black-eyed one?\" asked the fair Cutter, for the girls had a name for all the attitudinizers and promenaders whom they oftenest met.  \"No, he had gray eyes, and very fine ones they were too,\" answered Psyche, adding, as if to herself, \"he looked as I imagine Michael Angelo might have looked when young.\"  \"Had he a broken nose, like the great Mike?\" asked an irreverent damsel.  \"If he had, no one would mind it, for his head is splendid; he took his hat off, so I had a fine view. He isn't handsome, but he'll _do_ something,\" said Psyche, prophetically, as she recalled the strong, ambitious face which she had often observed, but never mentioned before.  \"Well, dear, considering that you didn't 'particularly look' at the man, you've given us a very good idea of his appearance. We'll call him Michael Angelo, and he shall be your idol. I prefer stout old Rembrandt myself, and Larkie adores that dandified Raphael,\" said the lively Cutter, slapping away at Homer's bald pate energetically, as she spoke.  \"Raphael is a dear, but Rubens is more to my taste now,\" returned Miss Larkins. \"He was in the hall yesterday talking with Sir Joshua, who had his inevitable umbrella, like a true Englishman. Just as I came up, the umbrella fell right before me. I started back; Sir Joshua laughed, but Rubens said, 'Deuce take it!' and caught up the umbrella, giving me a never-to-be-forgotten look. It was perfectly thrilling.\"  \"Which,--the umbrella, the speech, or the look?\" asked Psyche, who was not sentimental.  \"Ah, you have no soul for art in nature, and nature in art,\" sighed the amber-tressed Larkins. \"I have, for I feed upon a glance, a tint, a curve, with exquisite delight. Rubens is adorable (_as a study_); that lustrous eye, that night of hair, that sumptuous cheek, are perfect. He only needs a cloak, lace collar, and slouching hat to be the genuine thing.\"  \"This isn't the genuine thing by any means. What _does_ it need?\" said Psyche, looking with a despondent air at the head on her stand.  Many would have pronounced it a clever thing; the nose was strictly Greek, the chin curved upward gracefully, the mouth was sweetly haughty, the brow classically smooth and low, and the breezy hair well done. But something was wanting; Psyche felt that, and could have taken her Venus by the dimpled shoulders, and given her a hearty shake, if that would have put strength and spirit into the lifeless face.  \"Now _I_ am perfectly satisfied with my Apollo, though you all insist that it is the image of Theodore Smythe. He says so himself, and assures me it will make a sensation when we exhibit,\" remarked Miss Larkins, complacently caressing the ambrosial locks of her Smythified Phebus.  \"What shall you do if it does not?\" asked Miss Cutter, with elegance.  \"I shall feel that I have mistaken my sphere, shall drop my tools, veil my bust, and cast myself into the arms of Nature, since Art rejects me;\" replied Miss Larkins, with a tragic gesture and an expression which strongly suggested that in her eyes nature meant Theodore.  \"She must have capacious arms if she is to receive all Art's rejected admirers. Shall I be one of them?\"  Psyche put the question to herself as she turned to work, but somehow ambitious aspirations were not in a flourishing condition that morning; her heart was not in tune, and head and hands sympathized. Nothing went well, for certain neglected home-duties had dogged her into town, and now worried her more than dust, or heat, or the ceaseless clatter of tongues. Tom, Dick, and Harry's unmended hose persisted in dancing a spectral jig before her mental eye, mother's querulous complaints spoilt the song she hummed to cheer herself, and little May's wistful face put the goddess of beauty entirely out of countenance.  \"It's no use; I can't work till the clay is wet again. Where is Giovanni?\" she asked, throwing down her tools with a petulant gesture and a dejected air.  \"He is probably playing truant in the empty upper rooms, as usual. I can't wait for him any longer, so I'm doing his work myself,\" answered Miss Dickenson, who was tenderly winding a wet bandage round her Juno's face, one side of which was so much plumper than the other that it looked as if the Queen of Olympus was being hydropathically treated for a severe fit of ague.  \"I'll go and find the little scamp; a run will do me good; so will a breath of air and a view of the park from the upper windows.\"  Doffing her apron, Psyche strolled away up an unfrequented staircase to the empty apartments, which seemed to be too high even for the lovers of High Art. On the western side they were shady and cool, and, leaning from one of the windows, Psyche watched the feathery tree-tops ruffled by the balmy wind, that brought spring odors from the hills, lying green and sunny far away. Silence and solitude were such pleasant companions that the girl forgot herself, till a shrill whistle disturbed her day-dreams, and reminded her what she came for. Following the sound she found the little Italian errand-boy busily uncovering a clay model which stood in the middle of a scantily furnished room near by.  \"He is not here; come and look; it is greatly beautiful,\" cried Giovanni, beckoning with an air of importance.  Psyche did look and speedily forgot both her errand and herself. It was the figure of a man, standing erect, and looking straight before him with a wonderfully lifelike expression. It was neither a mythological nor a historical character, Psyche thought, and was glad of it, being tired to death of gods and heroes. She soon ceased to wonder what it was, feeling only the indescribable charm of something higher than beauty. Small as her knowledge was, she could see and enjoy the power visible in every part of it; the accurate anatomy of the vigorous limbs, the grace of the pose, the strength and spirit in the countenance, clay though it was. A majestic figure, but the spell lay in the face, which, while it suggested the divine, was full of human truth and tenderness, for pain and passion seemed to have passed over it, and a humility half pathetic, a courage half heroic seemed to have been born from some great loss or woe.  How long she stood there Psyche did not know. Giovanni went away unseen, to fill his water-pail, and in the silence she just stood and looked. Her eyes kindled, her color rose, despondency and discontent vanished, and her soul was in her face, for she loved beauty passionately, and all that was best and truest in her did honor to the genius of the unknown worker.  \"If I could do a thing like that, I'd die happy!\" she exclaimed impetuously, as a feeling of despair came over her at the thought of her own poor attempts.  \"Who did it, Giovanni?\" she asked, still looking up at the grand face with unsatisfied eyes.  \"Paul Gage.\"  It was not the boy's voice, and, with a start, Psyche turned to see her Michael Angelo, standing in the doorway, attentively observing her. Being too full of artless admiration to think of herself just yet, she neither blushed nor apologized, but looked straight at him, saying heartily,--  \"You have done a wonderful piece of work, and I envy you more than I can tell!\"  The enthusiasm in her face, the frankness of her manner, seemed to please him, for there was no affectation about either. He gave her a keen, kind glance out of the \"fine gray eyes,\" a little bow, and a grateful smile, saying quietly,--\"Then my Adam is not a failure in spite of his fall?\"  Psyche turned from the sculptor to his model with increased admiration in her face, and earnestness in her voice, as she exclaimed delighted,--  \"Adam! I might have known it was he. O sir, you have indeed succeeded, for you have given that figure the power and pathos of the first man who sinned and suffered, and began again.\"  \"Then I am satisfied.\" That was all he said, but the look he gave his work was a very eloquent one, for it betrayed that he had paid the price of success in patience and privation, labor and hope.  \"What can one do to learn your secret?\" asked the girl wistfully, for there was nothing in the man's manner to disturb her self-forgetful mood, but much to foster it, because to the solitary worker this confiding guest was as welcome as the doves who often hopped in at his window.  \"Work and wait, and meantime feed heart, soul, and imagination with the best food one can get,\" he answered slowly, finding it impossible to give a receipt for genius.  \"I can work and wait a long time to gain my end; but I don't know where to find the food you speak of?\" she answered, looking at him like a hungry child.  \"I wish I could tell you, but each needs different fare, and each must look for it in different places.\"  The kindly tone and the sympathizing look, as well as the lines in his forehead, and a few gray hairs among the brown, gave Psyche courage to say more.  \"I love beauty"]]]
