I used it to open cans on and slice bread and all that. And I always washed it good and clean, you can bet. Oh, but it was nice sitting there and it was just as quiet as it is in the woods. Sometimes a motor boat would go by and we could hear it chugging.  \"One thing, nobody'll bother us here,\" I said, \"some fellows don't like Sunday, but I do.\"  Skinny said, \"I like Christmas best, because rich people bring baskets of food.\"  Cracky, I felt awful sorry for him.    CHAPTER VI  TELLS HOW SKINNY AND I GOT TOGETHER  First I bored a hole in the coin and hung it around Skinny's neck. He was all excited and said, \"Now I've got a regular merit badge, ain't I?\"  I said, \"No you haven't, but it's a good badge, all right\" Then I said, \"Now I'm going to tell you some things about merit badges. You get merit badge because you're able to do special things, see? You get them for being able to do things that some other fellows can't do--kind of. Not exactly that,\" I told him, \"because most fellows can do the things if they try hard enough. But, anyway, there isn't any merit badge for keeping your eyes open. Mr. Ellsworth was only joking about that. And especially you don't get any merit badge for being honest, because that would be too easy. If you could get one for that, gee-whiz, all the fellows would have them, that's sure.\"  He said, \"Ain't it good to be honest?\"  I told him sure it was, but it was too easy and that all the scouts were honest anyway, even without badges. Then I said, \"If you wore that on account of being honest, that would insult all the other fellows, wouldn't it?\" He just stared at me, but didn't say anything. \"So you have to be careful,\" I told him, \"not to be saying that you have a reward for being honest, see?\"  Then I told him about there not being any badge for keeping his eyes open and finding things. \"But there's a badge for something else like that,\" I said, \"only you can't get it yet, because you have to learn a lot of things first, and it's a lot of fun learning them, too.\"  He said, \"Can I learn them right now?\"  I said, \"No, but you'll learn a lot of them up in camp.\" Then I told them that the one that had most to do with keeping his eyes open was the stalking badge. So then I got out the Handbook and showed him the picture of it and read him what it said. Gee williger, I don't see where there was any harm in that, do you? I read him the three conditions and the four sub-divisions.  \"So you see, that means keeping your eyes open all right,\" I told him, \"because you have to be all the time watching for signs and tracks in the snow or in the dirt, so as you can tell where a bird went, maybe, and sneak up and watch him.\"  \"That's one thing I can do,\" he said, \"sneak. I'm a little sneak, everybody said so.\"  Good night, that kid was the limit!  \"I don't mean that way,\" I told him, \"but you have to _stalk_. That means to follow a bird or an animal and watch them without them knowing anything about it--see?\"  He said, all excited like, \"I can sneak up on 'em, so then can I have the badge--for sneaking--like you said?\"  Gee whiz, I just sat back and laughed. Then I said, \"_Stalking badge_; not sneaking, but _stalking_. That's the badge you're after. So that's the one you want to think about. Don't think about a whole lot of things but just think about that.\"  He said, \"I like you a whole lot, and that's the one I'm going to get, because you say so.\"  Just then I noticed Stut Moran (we call him that because he stutters) going past the window. Pretty soon I noticed him passing again and walking very slow.  \"You just keep your mind on that one badge and remember those letters,\" I said; \"and for goodness' sake don't talk about badges for sneaking. Because, you take a tip from me, you can only do one thing at a time.\"  He said, \"The poultry badge is a good one. It's got a picture of a rooster on it.\"  \"You should worry about pictures of roosters,\" I said, \"just keep thinking about that one badge, you take my advice. Because you're good on keeping your eyes open and that's the badge for you. And you're small and kind of thin and that's good in stalking, too, because you can hide behind trees and things.\" Then I said, \"If you'll make me a promise that you'll just think about that one badge and not about a lot of others all at once, when we get up to camp, I'll make you a basket out of a peach-pit to hang around your neck.\"  Just then the door of the galley opened and in came Connie Bennett. Right behind him were Vic Norris and Stut Moran. Connie is leader of the Elks and the other two fellows are Elks, too. Right away he began and I saw he was mad.  \"That's a good thing you're talking about--_sneaking_\" he said.  I said, \"What do you mean?\"  \"He's getting a good lesson in sneaking all right,\" he shot right back at me.  \"Gee whiz, I don't know what you're talking about,\" I said.  \"Oh, no,\" he said, all the while sort of sneering at me; \"I suppose you didn't bring him in here so you could be where nobody else heard you. Maybe you think you own the galley.\"  \"Sure I brought him in here so we could be alone,\" I said.  \"_Sure you did_,\" he said, \"just so you could start him after the stalker's badge. We heard you make him promise to go after that and not think about anything else. He's easy, that kid is.\"  \"Why should I--\" I began.  \"You know well enough why,\" he said; \"who started the rule about not having two of the same merit badges in a patrol?\"  \"I did,\" I told him.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"and now you're trying to rush this kid through just so you can get even with Vic. What have _you_ got to do with our patrol anyway? Don't you think we're old enough to take care of our new members? All because you and Vic were on the outs last summer.\"  Jingo, that made me mad. \"I forgot all about that,\" I said; \"didn't Vic treat me to a soda only last week? It wasn't a quarrel anyway. I should worry about who has the stalker's badge in your patrol. I didn't even know Vic was after it. You know yourself the kid hasn't begun his second-class tests yet. What chance does _he_ stand if Vic is after it? I only thought I'd try to do a good turn. Cracky, it's hard enough to think up anything to do out here on a Sunday afternoon--you know that yourself. I was waiting all day for somebody to fall overboard, so I could jump in and save them. You're a lot of old grandmothers in your patrol. If that's all you've got to complain about, you'd better go and sweep the wind off the deck.\"  \"You mean to tell me to go and sweep the wind off the deck?\" Connie said, coming right up close to me.  \"Sure,\" I said, \"and when you get through with that go and clean the reflection out of the water. I should worry. Here, take your new member. If I'd known Vic was after the badge, I wouldn't have said a word about it, you can bet. You ought to know me well enough to know I was just giving him a few tips. Did I have any quarrel with you, Vic?\"  Honest, would you believe it, none of them said a word except, \"Come ahead, Skinny,\" and the poor kid followed them out, not knowing what to think, I guess.  \"End of a perfect day,\" I said.    CHAPTER VII  TELLS ABOUT MY MERIT BADGE  Wasn't that a crazy thing? Just because last summer I put a stalking sign on one of Vic's trees. How did I know it was his? As soon as he told me, I marked off my claim the same as any scout would. Maybe I ought to have remembered that he was out for the stalker's badge, but believe me, I have enough to remember with the Silver Fox patrol.  Gee whiz, nobody can say that I ever butt in when a patrol is breaking in a tenderfoot. That's one thing I wouldn't do. I wouldn't even have bothered to tell you about it at all, except that it had _momentous consequences_--that's what Pee-wee said.  At supper there was a big round flat piece of wood tied with a rope at my place and on it was printed \"_Sneaker's Badge_.\" It must have been cut out of a piece of wood from a grocery box, because I noticed on the other side of it, it said \"_Honey Boy_\" I suppose it meant some kind of cookies or crackers or soap maybe. So just for the fun of it I stood up and said.  \"Friends and enemies: Ever since about five o'clock this afternoon I've been hunting for a chance to do a good turn. The first one I tried to do didn't pan out. So here's my chance to do a good turn and I have to thank the honorable Elk Patrol for giving me the chance.\" Then I turned the big wooden medal over so the other side showed and everybody read \"_Honey Boy_\" and began to laugh. Even Vie Norris had to laugh. \"If it wasn't for the Elks I'd have to go to bed without doing a good turn.\"  Crinkums, you ought to have seen Mr. Ellsworth laugh. All the time he knew something was wrong, I guess, but he never bothered with things like that. \"Settle your own disputes,\" that's what he always said. The only fellow that didn't take it as a joke was Connie Bennett and just for that reason you'll have to hear more about it.  One thing more happened that day. When it was nearly dark Westy Martin (he's my special chum) came to me and said, \"There's a boat coming this way and I think it's coming here.\" I went over to the rail where all of the fellows were watching and there was a rowboat with two men in it, headed straight for us. Pretty soon they came alongside and, oh, boy, I was so shaky that I just held onto the rail with my hand trembling. Because they had badges on and I knew they were men belonging to the government.  Good night, I said to myself, it's all up now; they're after Lieutenant Donnelle. They're going to search the house-boat and ask a lot of questions and I'll have to tell.  When they got on board one of them said, \"We just want to give you the once over, mate.\"  Oh, didn't my heart go down to my feet. I thought it would be all right if I didn't stay around because they couldn't ask me any questions if I wasn't there."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10316"],["title","Roy Blakeley's Adventures in Camp (#5)"],["body"," And I was on the side of Lieutenant Donnelle, I didn't care what. So I went into the galley and began straightening things out there. After a little while Westy came and stuck his head in through the window.  \"Are they gone?\" I asked him.  \"Sure,\" he said.  Then I said, \"What did they want?\"  \"They were only just inspectors,\" he said; \"and they wanted to know if we had power.\"  \"You mean an engine?\" I asked him. \"Sure,\" he said, \"because if a boat has a _fixed engine_, it has to have a license and a certain kind of whistle and bell and lights and all that.\"  \"A fixed engine?\" I said, \"if we had one it probably wouldn't be fixed.\"  \"They meant a stationary engine,\" he said, \"you crazy Indian.\"  \"What else did they say?\" I asked, because I was still kind of nervous.  \"They told us we should have a life preserver for everybody on board and a fog horn.\"  Cracky, wasn't I relieved. \"Isn't Pee-wee fog horn enough?\" I said.  Just the same it started me thinking about Lieutenant Donnelle again, and after I went to bed I kept on thinking about him, so I couldn't get to sleep. One thing, I knew I liked him a lot, that was sure. But now since I knew about the new law, that a motor boat has to have a license, I wondered why Jake Holden didn't have one and have the number on his boat, like everybody has to. Anyway, it was lucky for him that he didn't have any number on, because now they'd have a hard job finding him, especially because I knew he didn't give his right name. And then I began wondering about the adventure that Jake and Lieutenant Donnelle had. One thing sure, it must be pretty bad to be out on the ocean like that in a little boat and be almost dead. I was wondering if there was any more to it than Lieutenant Donnelle told me, maybe. Anyway, he'd had lots of adventures in his life, that was sure. I was glad he said we'd go on a hike some day.  After a while, when I couldn't get to sleep, I got up and went out on the deck and sat in one of the big steamer chairs. Oh, it was fine. It was all pitch dark and all you could see were the lights on the boats. All of a sudden I heard a sound and saw a face and the hair round the face was all hanging down and it gave me a scare, kind of.  Then I saw it was Skinny. He said, \"Can I sit down alongside of you?\"  I said, \"You ought to be in bed,\" and he said, \"I can't go to sleep because I keep thinking and I want to stay right near you. I ain't mad at you, anyway. Were you thinking about how they got mad at you?\"  All the while he came closer and he took hold of my arm with his hand and his hand was hot--even through my khaki shirt I could feel it. And his eyes didn't look like the other fellows' eyes.  I said, \"I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about a fellow that's a hero. He's a big fellow. You know what a hero is?\" I said.  \"Are you a hero?\" that's what he said. That's just what he said.  Anyway, one thing I didn't know then, and that was that Skinny was going to have more to do with Lieutenant Donnelle than I was. Poor little kid, he didn't know it either. That was one good thing.    CHAPTER VIII  TELLS ABOUT OUR TRIP UP THE HUDSON  He said, \"If they get mad when I talk to you, I'll talk to you on the sly. It's all right to like a fellow that isn't in your patrol, isn't it?\"  \"Sure it is,\" I told him, \"you have to like everybody. But you do what they tell you and then nobody'll get mad.\"  He said, \"The swimming badge is a good one, isn't it?\"  \"It's a dandy one,\" I said. Then he told me that was the one they wanted him to try for. He said, \"Can I try for it now?\"  I thought I'd better watch my step--safety first, hey? So I said, \"You ask Connie. I shouldn't think there'd be any objection to trying now; then after you've passed your first class tests you could just scoop the badge right up, see?\"  \"I looked at all the pictures of the badges,\" he said, \"and I like the one with the picture of a rooster best. Is the swimming one better than that?\"  I said, \"Yes, because every scout has got to know how to swim. Anyway, Connie knows best; and he's your patrol leader, so you do whatever he tells you to.\"  \"Will I be able to beat everybody swimming?\" he said.  I told him maybe, if he tried hard, and then I told him he'd better go to bed. He said he wouldn't be able to sleep now, on account of thinking about the swimming badge. Anyway, he went and I noticed how skinny his legs were. It made me feel awful sorry for him, because his suit didn't fit him and looked kind of funny. His eyes were funny, anyway, and gave me the fidgets, but in the dark you could just see them shine. I told him to go inside and go to sleep and not think about the swimming badge.  One thing about Skinny, I knew he'd never make a good all-around scout, like some fellows. You know what I mean. Now you take Artie Van Arlen-- he's got eleven merit badges and he's got the bronze medal. Maybe you'd say photography was his bug, but he never went crazy about it, that's one sure thing. Take _me_, I've got nine merit badges--the more the merrier, I don't care.  But Skinny could only think about one thing and he'd go clean crazy about it. Mr. Ellsworth says he's _intense_--hanged if I know what that is. All I know is that he couldn't think about a lot of things. He just couldn't read the Handbook through. All of a sudden, when he'd be reading it, he'd see something that he liked, and good night, he'd forget everything else. Mr. Ellsworth said Skinny would never do anything except _one_ thing, and most likely that would be a big stunt and if he failed, it would kill him. I guess he was a kind of a genius, like--you know what I mean. Either that or he was half crazy. I could never make him out, I know that.  One thing, I was mighty glad he was going in for the swimming badge and I hoped the Elks would help him. He'd sure have the best swimmer in the troop to help him and that was Hunt Ward; he can swim better than any Raven, or Silver Fox, either--I have to admit that. Especially it's good to go in for the swimming badge right away as soon as you join a troop, even though you can't get your award till you pass your first class tests, because, gee, every fellow ought to know how to swim, that's one sure thing.  The next morning good and early we could see the _General Grant_ (that's Captain Savage's tug), heading across the bay straight for us and as soon as it got close enough, we gave Captain Savage a good cheer. Captain Savage was standing up in the little house smoking his pipe, and he shouted to us and said he was delayed on account of getting his propeller wet. That was just like him, he was always joking.  Then he shouted to us. \"It's a wonder you wouldn't get into shallow water; do you know how many feet you've got?\" Pee-wee shouted back, \"Two; what do you think we are, quadrupeds?\" Laugh! Honest, that kid is a scream.  I guess we must have been in pretty shallow water, because Captain Savage made us all hustle throwing ropes and winding them around thing-um-bobs--you know what I mean. And he was in such a hurry that he didn't come on the house-boat at all. But he said we had a mighty neat, comfortable craft, and that it looked as if it might have slid off some street or other into the water. He was awful funny.  Pretty soon we were sailing up the Hudson alongside of the _General Grant_. The day before I thought that when the tug came it would tow us behind with a long rope and it seemed funny like, to be tied fast alongside the tug. It seemed kind of as if the house-boat was being arrested--you know how I mean.  Anyway, I liked that way best because we could be always climbing back and forth, and believe me, most of us were on the tug all the time. I guess maybe Captain Savage liked Pee-wee. Anyway, he called for Pee-wee and me to go up in the pilot house, and it was fine to watch him steer and pull the rope that made the whistle blow, Jiminety, didn't we jump the first time we heard it!  Captain Savage said, \"Yer see it don't cost me nuthin' fur a blow-out, as you might say. Now, if this here old craft was an automobile, how much would I have to pay for tires with a blow-out every minute, huh?\" Then he'd look awful funny like, at Pee-wee.  You can bet Captain Savage was nice to us fellows and we all liked him. He had to stop at Peekskill and he took us all ashore for a peek-- that's what he said. And he treated us all to sodas. You get dandy raspberry sodas in Peekskill.  After that we started for Poughkeepsie and that was as far as he was going to tow us, because he had to tow a barge down to New York. But, any way, we should worry, there isn't any tide above Poughkeepsie and any dinky little kicker could tow us up to Catskill Landing from there. \"Believe me,\" I said, \"if there are any ways around here, we'll find them.\" Finding ways to do things is our middle name.  We had Captain Savage on the house-boat to lunch with us and Mr. Ellsworth made a speech and said we were all much obliged to him and, oh, boy, when that tug started down the river again, didn't we stand on the cabin roof of the house-boat and cheer Captain Savage. He had about six blow-outs before he got very far--just answering our cheers.  Oh, cracky, but he was one fine man.    CHAPTER IX  TELLS ABOUT SKINNY'S SWIMMING LESSON  I don't know what to call this chapter. Maybe it will come without calling, hey? Anyway, I should worry. Maybe I'll think of a name when I'm finished with it. It will be mostly about Skinny.  There isn't much more to tell about our trip to Catskill Landing, but you just wait, and there'll be a lot to tell you about our cruise down again. Don't be in a hurry--just you wait. More haste, less speed. But take it from me, you don't get much speed out of a house-boat. A house-boat belongs to the merry-go-round family, that's what Mr. Ellsworth says.  That night we kept the boat tied up to the dock in Poughkeepsie and took a hike around the town, while Mr. Ellsworth tried to find somebody who would tow us up to"]]]
