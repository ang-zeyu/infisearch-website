It appears  a kind of insulting upon their misfortune, and is apt to foment  their grief.  Even in our own case (upon any disastrous occurrence  to ourselves), it would not be seemly to frolic it thus; it would  signify want of due regard to the frowns of God, and the strokes of  His hand; it would cross the wise man's advice, \"In the day of  prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider.\"  It is also not seasonable, or civil, to be jocund in this way with  those who desire to be serious, and like not the humour.  Jocularity  should not be forcibly obtruded, but by a kindly conspiracy (or  tacit compact) slip into conversation; consent and complaisance give  all the life thereto.  Its design is to sweeten and ease society;  when to the contrary it breedeth offence or encumbrance, it is worse  than vain and unprofitable.  From these instances we may collect  when in other like cases it is unseasonable, and therefore culpable.   Further--  5.  To affect, admire, or highly to value this way of speaking  (either absolutely in itself, or in comparison to the serious and  plain way of speech), and thence to be drawn into an immoderate use  thereof, is blamable.  A man of ripe age and sound judgment, for  refreshment to himself, or in complaisance to others, may sometimes  condescend to play in this, or any other harmless way; but to be  fond of it, to prosecute it with a careful or painful eagerness, to  dote and dwell upon it, to reckon it a brave or a fine thing, a  singular matter of commendation, a transcendent accomplishment,  anywise preferable to rational endowments, or comparable to the  moral excellencies of our mind (to solid knowledge, or sound wisdom,  or true virtue and goodness), this is extremely childish, or  brutish, and far below a man.  What can be more absurd than to make  business of play, to be studious and laborious in toys, to make a  profession or drive a trade of impertinency?  What more plain  nonsense can there be, than to be earnest in jest, to be continual  in divertisement, or constant in pastime; to make extravagance all  our way, and sauce all our diet?  Is not this plainly the life of a  child that is ever busy, yet never hath anything to do?  Or the life  of that mimical brute which is always active in playing uncouth and  unlucky tricks; which, could it speak, might surely pass well for a  professed wit?  The proper work of man, the grand drift of human life, is to follow  reason (that noble spark kindled from Heaven; that princely and  powerful faculty, which is able to reach so lofty objects, and  achieve so mighty works), not to soothe fancy, that brutish, shallow  and giddy power, able to perform nothing worthy much regard.  We are  not (even Cicero could tell us) born for play and jesting, but for  severity, and the study of graver and greater affairs.  Yes, we were  purposely designed, and fitly framed, to understand and contemplate,  to affect and delight in, to undertake and pursue most noble and  worthy things; to be employed in business considerably profitable to  ourselves, and beneficial to others.  We do therefore strangely  debase ourselves, when we do strongly bend our minds to, or set our  affections upon, such toys.  Especially to do so is unworthy of a Christian; that is, of a person  who is advanced to so high a rank, and so glorious relations; who  hath so excellent objects of his mind and affections presented  before him, and so excellent rewards for his care and pains proposed  to him; who is engaged in affairs of so worthy nature, and so  immense consequence:  for him to be zealous about quibbles, for him  to be ravished with puny conceits and expressions, 'tis a wondrous  oversight, and an enormous indecency.  He indeed that prefers any faculty to reason, disclaims the  privilege of being a man, and understands not the worth of his own  nature; he that prizes any quality beyond virtue and goodness,  renounces the title of a Christian, and knows not how to value the  dignity of his profession.  It is these two (reason and virtue) in  conjunction which produce all that is considerably good and great in  the world.  Fancy can do little; doth never anything well, except as  directed and wielded by them.  Do pretty conceits or humorous talk  carry on any business, or perform any work?  No; they are  ineffectual and fruitless:  often they disturb, but they never  despatch anything with good success.  It is simple reason (as dull  and dry as it seemeth) which expediteth all the grand affairs, which  accomplisheth all the mighty works that we see done in the world.   In truth, therefore, as one diamond is worth numberless bits of  glass; so one solid reason is worth innumerable fancies:  one grain  of true science and sound wisdom in real worth and use doth outweigh  loads (if any loads can be) of freakish wit.  To rate things  otherwise doth argue great weakness of judgment, and fondness of  mind.  So to conceit of this way signifieth a weak mind; and much to  delight therein rendereth it so--nothing more debaseth the spirit of  a man, or more rendereth it light and trifling.  Hence if we must be venting pleasant conceits, we should do it as if  we did it not, carelessly and unconcernedly; not standing upon it,  or valuing ourselves for it:  we should do it with measure and  moderation; not giving up ourselves thereto, so as to mind it or  delight in it more than in any other thing:  we should not be so  intent upon it as to become remiss in affairs more proper or needful  for us; so as to nauseate serious business, or disrelish the more  worthy entertainments of our minds.  This is the great danger of it,  which we daily see men to incur; they are so bewitched with a humour  of being witty themselves, or of hearkening to the fancies of  others, that it is this only which they can like or favour, which  they can endure to think or talk of.  'Tis a great pity that men who  would seem to have so much wit, should so little understand  themselves.  But further--  6.  Vainglorious ostentation this way is very blamable.  All  ambition, all vanity, all conceitedness, upon whatever ground they  are founded, are absolutely unreasonable and silly; but yet those  being grounded on some real ability, or some useful skill, are wise  and manly in comparison to this, which standeth on a foundation so  manifestly slight and weak.  The old philosophers by a severe father  were called animalia gloriae (animals of glory), and by a satirical  poet they were termed bladders of vanity; but they at least did  catch at praise from praiseworthy knowledge; they were puffed up  with a wind which blew some good to mankind; they sought glory from  that which deserved glory if they had not sought it; it was a  substantial and solid credit which they did affect, resulting from  successful enterprises of strong reason, and stout industry:  but  these animalculae gloriae, these flies, these insects of glory,  these, not bladders, but bubbles of vanity, would be admired and  praised for that which is nowise admirable or laudable; for the  casual hits and emergencies of roving fancy; for stumbling on an odd  conceit or phrase, which signifieth nothing, and is as superficial  as the smile, as hollow as the noise it causeth.  Nothing certainly  in nature is more ridiculous than a self-conceited wit, who deemeth  himself somebody, and greatly pretendeth to commendation from so  pitiful and worthless a thing as a knack of trifling.  7.  Lastly, it is our duty never so far to engage ourselves in this  way as thereby to lose or to impair that habitual seriousness,  modesty and sobriety of mind, that steady composedness, gravity and  constancy of demeanour, which become Christians.  We should  continually keep our minds intent upon our high calling, and grand  interests; ever well tuned, and ready for the performance of holy  devotions, and the practice of most serious duties with earnest  attention and fervent affection.  Wherefore we should never suffer  them to be dissolved into levity, or disordered into a wanton frame,  indisposing us for religious thoughts and actions.  We ought always  in our behaviour to maintain, not only [Greek] (a fitting decency),  but also [Greek] (a stately gravity), a kind of venerable majesty,  suitable to that high rank which we bear of God's friends and  children; adorning our holy profession, and guarding us from all  impressions of sinful vanity.  Wherefore we should not let ourselves  be transported into any excessive pitch of lightness, inconsistent  with or prejudicial to our Christian state and business.  Gravity  and modesty are the senses of piety, which being once slighted, sin  will easily attempt and encroach upon us.  So the old Spanish  gentleman may be interpreted to have been wise who, when his son  upon a voyage to the Indies took his leave of him, gave him this odd  advice, \"My son, in the first place keep thy gravity, in the next  place fear God;\" intimating that a man must first be serious, before  he can be pious.  To conclude, as we need not be demure, so must we not be impudent;  as we should not be sour, so ought we not to be fond; as we may be  free, so we should not be vain; as we may well stoop to friendly  complaisance, so we should take heed of falling into contemptible  levity.  If without wronging others, or derogating from ourselves,  we can be facetious, if we can use our wits in jesting innocently,  and conveniently, we may sometimes do it:  but let us, in compliance  with St. Paul's direction, beware of \"foolish talking and jesting  which are not convenient.\"  \"Now the God of grace and peace . . . . make us perfect in every  good work to do His will, working in us that which is well pleasing  in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and  ever.  Amen.\"    AGAINST RASH AND VAIN SWEARING.    \"But above all things, my brethren, swear not.\"                           "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10274"],["title","Sermons on Evil-Speaking (#6)"],["body","     St. James v. 12.  Among other precepts of good life (directing the practice of virtue  and abstinence from sin) St. James doth insert this about swearing,  couched in expression denoting his great earnestness, and apt to  excite our special attention.  Therein he doth not mean universally  to interdict the use of oaths, for that in some cases is not only  lawful, but very expedient, yea, needful, and required from us as a  duty; but that swearing which our Lord had expressly prohibited to  His disciples, and which thence, questionless, the brethren to whom  St. James did write did well understand themselves obliged to  forbear, having learned so in the first catechisms of Christian  institution; that is, needless and heedless swearing in ordinary  conversation, a practice then frequent in the world, both among Jews  and Gentiles; the which also, to the shame of our age, is now so  much in fashion, and with some men in vogue; the invoking God's  name, appealing to His testimony, and provoking His judgment upon  any slight occasion, in common talk, with vain incogitancy, or  profane boldness.  From such practice the Holy Apostle exhorteth in  terms importing his great concernedness, and implying the matter to  be of highest importance; for, [Greek], saith he, \"(Before all  things), my brethren, do not swear;\" as if he did apprehend this sin  of all others to be one of the most heinous and pernicious.  Could  he have said more? would he have said so much, if he had not  conceived the matter to be of exceeding weight and consequence?  And  that it is so, I mean now, by God's help, to show you, by proposing  some considerations, whereby the heinous wickedness, together with  the monstrous folly, of such rash and vain swearing will appear; the  which being laid to heart will, I hope, effectually dissuade and  deter from it.   I.  Let us consider the nature of an oath, and what we do when we  adventure to swear.  It is (as it is phrased in the Decalogue, and elsewhere in Holy  Scripture) an assuming the name of God, and applying it to our  purpose; to countenance and confirm what we say.  It is an invocation of God as a most faithful Witness, concerning  the truth of our words, or the sincerity of our meaning.  It is an appeal to God as a most upright Judge whether we do  prevaricate in asserting what we do not believe true, or in  promising what we are not firmly resolved to perform.  It is a formal engagement of God to be the Avenger of our  trespassing in violation of truth or faith.  It is a binding our souls with a most strict and solemn obligation,  to answer before God, and to undergo the issue of His judgment about  what we affirm or undertake.  Such an oath is represented to us in Holy Scripture.  Whence we may collect, that swearing doth require great modesty and  composedness of spirit, very serious consideration and solicitous  care, that we be not rude and saucy with God, in taking up His name,  and prostituting it to vile or mean uses; that we do not abuse or  debase His authority, by citing it to aver falsehoods or  impertinences; that we do not slight His venerable justice, by  rashly provoking it against us; that we do not precipitately throw  our souls into most dangerous snares and intricacies.  For let us reflect and consider:  What a presumption is it without  due regard and reverence to lay hold on God's name; with unhallowed  breath to vent and toss that great and glorious, that most holy,  that reverend, that fearful and terrible name of the Lord our God,  the great Creator, the mighty Sovereign, the dreadful Judge of all  the world; that name which all heaven with profoundest submission  doth adore, which the angelical powers, the brightest and purest  Seraphim, without hiding their faces, and reverential horror, cannot  utter or hear; the very thought whereof should strike awe through  our hearts, the mention whereof would make any sober man to tremble?   [Greek], \"For how,\" saith St. Chrysostom, \"is it not absurd that a  servant should not dare to call his master by name, or bluntly and  ordinarily to mention him, yet that we slightly and contemptuously  should in our mouth toss about the Lord of angels?  \"How is it not absurd, if we have a garment better than the rest,  that we forbear to use it continually, but in the most slight and  common way do wear the name of God?\"  How grievous indecency is it, at every turn to summon our Maker, and  call down Almighty God from heaven, to attend our leisure, to vouch  our idle prattle, to second our giddy passions, to concern His  truth, His justice, His power in our trivial affairs!  What a wildness is it, to dally with that judgment upon which the  eternal doom of all creatures dependeth, at which the pillars of  heaven are astonished, which hurled down legions of angels from the  top of heaven and happiness into the bottomless dungeon:  the which,  as grievous sinners, of all things we have most reason to dread; and  about which no sober man can otherwise think than did that great  king, the holy psalmist, who said, \"My flesh trembleth for Thee, and  I am afraid of Thy judgments!\"  How prodigious a madness is it, without any constraint or needful  cause, to incur so horrible a danger, to rush upon a curse; to defy  that vengeance, the least touch of breath whereof can dash us to  nothing, or thrust us down into extreme and endless woe?  Who can express the wretchedness of that folly, which so entangleth  us with inextricable knots, and enchaineth our souls so rashly with  desperate obligations?  Wherefore he that would but a little mind what he doeth when he  dareth to swear, what it is to meddle with the adorable name, the  venerable testimony, the formidable judgment, the terrible vengeance  of the Divine Majesty, into what a case he putteth himself, how  extreme hazard he runneth thereby, would assuredly have little heart  to swear, without greatest reason, and most urgent need; hardly  without trembling would he undertake the most necessary and solemn  oath; much cause would he see [Greek], to adore, to fear an oath:   which to do, the divine preacher maketh the character of a good man.   \"As,\" saith he, \"is the good, so is the sinner; and he that  sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.\"  In fine, even a heathen philosopher, considering the nature of an  oath, did conclude the unlawfulness thereof in such cases.  For,  \"seeing,\" saith he, \"an oath doth call God for witness, and  proposeth Him for umpire and voucher of the things it saith;  therefore to induce God so upon occasion of human affairs, or, which  is all one, upon small and slight accounts, doth imply contempt of  Him:  wherefore we ought wholly to shun swearing, except upon  occasions of highest necessity.\"   II.  We may consider that swearing, agreeably to its nature, or  natural aptitude and tendency, is represented in Holy Scripture as a  special part of religious worship, or devotion towards God; in the  due performance whereof we do avow Him for the true God and Governor  of the world; we piously do acknowledge His principal attributes and  special prerogatives; His omnipresence and omniscience, extending  itself to our most inward thoughts, our secretest purposes, our  closest retirements; His watchful providence over all our actions,  affairs, and concerns; His faithful goodness, in favouring truth and  protecting right; His exact justice, in patronising sincerity, and  chastising perfidiousness; His being Supreme Lord over all persons,  and Judge paramount in all causes; His readiness in our need, upon  our humble imploration and reference, to undertake the arbitration  of matters controverted, and the care of administering justice, for  the maintenance of truth and right, of loyalty and fidelity, of  order and peace among men.  Swearing does also intimate a pious  truth and confidence in God, as Aristotle observeth.  Such things a serious oath doth imply, to such purposes swearing  naturally serveth; and therefore to signify or effectuate them,  Divine institution hath devoted it.  God in goodness to such ends hath pleased to lend us His great name;  allowing us to cite Him for a witness, to have recourse to His bar,  to engage His justice and power, whenever the case deserveth and  requireth it, or when we cannot by other means well assure the  sincerity of our meaning, or secure the constancy of our  resolutions.  Yea, in such exigencies He doth exact this practice from us, as an  instance of our religious confidence in Him, and as a service  conducible to His glory.  For it is a precept in His law, of moral  nature, and eternal obligation, \"Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God;  Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave, and shalt swear  by His name.\"  It is the character of a religious man to swear with  due reverence and upright conscience.  For, \"The king,\" saith the  psalmist, \"shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by Him  shall glory:  but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be  stopped.\"  It is a distinctive mark of God's people, according to  that of the prophet Jeremy, \"And it shall come to pass, if they will  diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name . . .  then shall they be built in the midst of my people.\"  It is  predicted concerning the evangelical times, \"Unto Me every knee  shall bow, every tongue shall swear:\" and, \"That he who blesseth  himself in the earth, shall bless himself by the God of Truth; and  he that sweareth in the earth, shall swear by the God of Truth.\"  As therefore all other acts of devotion, wherein immediate  application is made to the Divine Majesty, should never be performed  without most hearty intention, most serious consideration, most  lowly reverence; so neither should this grand one, wherein God is so  nearly touched, and His chief attributes so much concerned:  the  which indeed doth involve both prayer and praise, doth require the  most devotional acts of faith and fear.
