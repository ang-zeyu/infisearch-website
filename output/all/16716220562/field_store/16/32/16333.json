Swenk (_loc. cit._) originally described _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ as a subspecies of _Perognathus flavescens_. I have examined the holotype, kindly made available to me by Dr. Seth B. Benson of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, and the paratype, in the collection of the University of Nebraska State Museum. Neither is _P. flavescens_, but both are clearly specimens of _P. Fasciatus_ on the basis of olive-gray dorsal coloration, larger over-all dimensions of the skull, and in that the tympanic bullae do not meet anteriorly. In addition, a third specimen from Glen, Nebraska, purported by Swenk to be intermediate between _flavescens_ and _olivaceogriseus_, has been examined and found to be an immature _fasciatus_.  [Illustration: FIGS. 2-7. Skulls of two species of pocket mice. All Ã— 1-1/2. In comparison with _P. flavescens_ note that _P. fasciatus_ has the tympanic bullae separated anteriorly and that the skull is slightly larger in over-all dimensions.

FIGS. 5-7. _Perognathus flavescens flavescens_, Kennedy, Cherry County, Nebraska, July 9, 1935, [** Female], No. 66883 MVZ.]  In the original description Swenk indicated the type locality as Chadron, Dawes County, Nebraska. The locality given on the specimen label of the holotype, however, is 5 mi. E Chadron. In addition, Swenk (_loc. cit._), in the paragraph preceding the description of _olivaceogriseus_, states that the holotype was actually taken on Little Bordeaux Creek, sec. 14, T. 33 N, R. 48 W, 3 mi. E Chadron, on the farm of L. M. Gates, who obtained the holotype. It seems best to restrict the type locality to the place last mentioned.  Four specimens from southeastern Alberta recently reported by Moore (1953:143) have been examined and seem best referred, among known subspecies of _fasciatus_, to _P. f. olivaceogriseus_. They differ from the latter in several minor cranial features and more drab back, sides and lateral line. When adequate material is available they may prove to be subspecifically different from _olivaceogriseus_. Moore referred these specimens to _P. f. fasciatus_.  Specimens from extreme northwestern Nebraska, including the holotype, are slightly darker than specimens from eastern Wyoming. A specimen from Ft. Steele, Wyoming, shows approach to _P. f. litus_ in pale dorsal coloration.       _Specimens examined._--Total number, 59, as follows: ALBERTA:      Foremost, 2 (UADZ). Manyberries, 1 (Alberta Dept.

Hist., ser. 6,          11:406, May, 1893, type from Loveland, Larimer County,          Colorado.       _Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:19,          September 20, 1900.       _Geographic distribution._--Known only from the type locality and      from 7 mi. N Ramah, Colorado. Probably in other parts of      northeastern Colorado (see Figure 1).  _Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus olivaceogriseus_ Swenk, geographically adjacent to the north, see the preceding account of that subspecies on page 520.  Of the seven topotypes available to me, six show various degrees of encroachment of the color of the lateral line upon the underparts, giving the ventral surface a buffy appearance, the \"distinguishing character\" of the subspecies according to Osgood (_op. cit._:20). When additional specimens are available, this character may be found to be one of individual variation, although no specimens from other parts of the range of the species have been found to exhibit it. Of the subspecies _P. f. infraluteus_, each of the eight specimens examined by me possesses buffy subauricular patches.  The specimen from 7 mi. N Ramah, Colorado, is slightly darker and less drab than the topotypes and does not possess buffy underparts. The skull of the specimen is broken but on the basis of characters of the pelage it seems to be intermediate between _infraluteus_ and _olivaceogriseus_ and is referred to the former on geographic grounds.       _Specimens examined._--Total number, 8, as follows: COLORADO:      _Elbert County_: 7 mi. N Ramah, 1 (MZ). _Larimer County_: Loveland,      7 (USBS).   =Perognathus fasciatus litus= Cary       _Perognathus fasciatus litus_ Cary, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., 24:61,          March 22, 1911, type from Sun, Sweetwater Valley, Natrona          County, Wyoming.       _Geographic distribution._--Lower Sweetwater Valley and adjacent      parts of Red Desert in Carbon, Fremont, Natrona and Sweetwater      counties, Wyoming (see Figure 1).  _Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus olivaceogriseus_, geographically adjacent to the northeast, see account of that subspecies. From _Perognathus fasciatus callistus_, geographically adjacent to the southwest, _P. f. litus_ differs in: Upper parts paler with no trace of olivaceous; hind foot shorter; skull, when specimens of equal age are compared, averaging smaller in all measurements taken (especially occipitonasal length, mastoidal breadth, length of tympanic bulla and cranial depth), except interparietal breadth which is more.  No fully adult specimens of _P. f. litus_ have been available to me for this study. Two of the three specimens mentioned by Cary in the original description (holotype not seen) have been examined and found to possess adult pelage, but cranially they must be classed as young adults. These specimens are paler than those of any other subspecies of _fasciatus_ and do not have the olivaceous dorsal coloration present in other subspecies.  _P. f. litus_ is seemingly an endemic race in the lower Sweetwater Valley and adjacent parts of the Red Desert, Wyoming. The type locality, recorded by Cary in the original description as \"Sun, Sweetwater Valley, Wyoming,\" is here placed in Natrona County on the basis of the map (frontispiece) in Cary's (1917) \"Life Zone Investigations in Wyoming.\"       _Specimens examined._--Total number, 9, as follows: WYOMING:      _Carbon County_: 8 mi. SE Lost Soldier, 6700 ft., 1 (USBS).      _Fremont County_: Granite Mts., 1 (MZ). _Natrona County_: 5 mi. W      Independence Rock, 6000 ft., 4 (KU); Sun, 1 (USBS); 16 mi. S, 11      mi. W Waltman, 6950 ft., 1 (KU). _Sweetwater County_: 27 mi. N      Table Rock, 1 (MZ).   =Perognathus fasciatus callistus= Osgood       _Perognathus callistus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:28, September          20, 1900, type from Kinney Ranch, near Bitter Creek, Sweetwater          County, Wyoming.       _Geographic distribution._--East of the Green River in central and      southern parts of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and adjacent parts of      Moffat County, Colorado (see Figure 1).  _Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus litus_, geographically adjacent to the north, see account of that subspecies.  When Osgood (_loc. cit._) described _P. f. callistus_ as a full species, he characterized it as having \" ... the attractive coloration of _fasciatus_, but softer and more delicate. Its position is evidently between _fasciatus_ and _apache_, and its nearest relations are clearly with the latter.\" He further remarked that, \"Its large size immediately separates it from _fasciatus_ which it resembles externally, especially before maturity.\"  Comparison of the average and extreme external measurements of ten adult _P. f. callistus_ from Sweetwater County, Wyoming, with adult individuals of other subspecies of _P. fasciatus_ shows that _callistus_ does not average larger than _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ except in length of hind foot and that it averages slightly smaller in all external measurements than topotypes of _P. f. fasciatus_. Moreover, judging from the accounts of Goldman (1918:24) and Durrant (1952:235), _Perognathus apache caryi_ (the subspecies of _P. apache_ nearest to the range of _P. f. callistus_) is significantly larger externally and has no trace of olivaceous in the dorsal pelage.  Comparison of the skulls of _callistus_ with a skull of _Perognathus apache apache_ from Wingate, New Mexico (USBS 137388), reveals the following differences: Interparietal bone wider in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31224"],["title","Geographic Distribution of the Pocket Mouse, Perognathus fasciatus (#2)"],["body","tus_, averaging 4.5 (as opposed to 4.0) and more pentagonal; lacrimal bone shorter and stouter in _callistus_; tympanic bullae more inflated in _callistus_; interorbital foramina larger in _callistus_; lower premolar approximately the same size as the last lower molar in _callistus_, approximately half the size of the last lower molar in _apache_. Conversely, comparison of skulls of _callistus_ with those of _P. fasciatus_ as concerns the above mentioned features reveals that they closely resemble each other. In view of this resemblance it seems best to arrange _callistus_ as a subspecies of _P. fasciatus_.  _P. f. callistus_ is distinct cranially from all other subspecies of _P. fasciatus_ in the narrowness of the interparietal, the greater length of the tympanic bulla and the greater mastoidal breadth. The fine, silky nature of the pelage is shared, to some extent, with _P. f. litus_.  A specimen from 27 mi. N, 37 mi. E Rock Springs, Wyoming, referred to _callistus_ resembles _litus_ in pale dorsal coloration and slightly wider interparietal. Four immature specimens from 25 mi. N, 38 mi. E Rock Springs, also referred to _callistus_, have extremely pale juvenal pelage and also are judged to be intergrades with _litus_.       _Specimens examined._--Total number, 23, as follows: WYOMING:      _Sweetwater County_: 18 mi. S Bitter Creek, 6800 ft., 3 (KU);      Kinney Ranch, 21 mi. S Bitter Creek, 6800 ft., 9 (KU 7, USBS 2); 30      mi. S Bitter Creek, 2 (KU); 33 mi. S Bitter Creek, 6900 ft., 2      (KU); 32 mi.
