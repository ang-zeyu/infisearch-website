But the best plan of all is to avoid the whole thing by doing the work cleanly from the first. And it is quite easy; for all you have to do is to carry the tool horizontally till it is over the spot where you want the wax, and then, by a tilt of the hand, slide the drop into its place.  _Further Methods of Painting._--There are two chief methods of treating the matt--one is the \"stipple,\" and the other the \"film\" or badgered matt.  _The Stipple._--When you have put on your matt with the camel-hair brush, take a stippling brush (fig. 41) and stab the matt all over with it while it is wet. A great variety of texture can be got in this way, for you may leave off the process at any moment; if you leave it off soon, the work will be soft and blurred, for, not being dry, the pigment will spread again as soon as you leave off: but, if you choose, you can go on stippling till the whole is dry, when the pigment will gather up into little sharp spots like pepper, and the glass between them will be almost clear. You must bear in mind that you cannot use scrubs over work like the last described, and cannot use them to much advantage over stipple at all. You can draw a needle through; but as a rule you do not want to take lights out of stipple, since you can complete the shading in the single process by stippling more or less according to the light and shade you want.  [Illustration: FIG. 41.]  A very coarse form of the process is \"dry\" stippling, where you stipple straight on to the surface of the clear glass, with pigment taken up off the palette by the stippling brush itself: for coarse distant work this may be sometimes useful.  Now as to film. We have spoken of laying on an even matt and badgering it smooth; and you can use this with a certain amount of stipple also with very good effect; but you are to notice one great rule about these two processes, namely, that the same amount of pigment _obscures much more light used in film than used in stipple_.  Light _spreads_ as it comes through openings; and a very little light let, in pinholes, through a very dark matt, will, at a distance, so assert itself as to prevail over the darkness of the matt.  It is really very little use going on to describe the way the colour acts in these various processes; for its behaviour varies with every degree of all of them. One may gradually acquire the skill to combine all the processes, in all their degrees, upon a single painting; and the only way in which you can test their relative value, either as texture or as light and shade, is to constantly practise each process in all its degrees, and see what results each has, both when seen near at hand and also when seen from a distance. It is useless to try and learn these things from written directions; you must make them your own, as precious secrets, by much practice and much experiment, though it will save you years of both to learn under a good master.  But this question of distance is a most important thing, and we must enlarge upon it a little and try to make it quite clear.  Glass-painting is not like any other painting in this respect.  Let us say that you see an oil-painting--a portrait--at the end of the large room in some big Exhibition. You stand near it and say, \"Yes, that is the King\" (or the Commander-in-Chief), \"a good likeness; however do they do those patent-leather boots?\" But after you have been down one side of the room and turn round at the other end to yawn, you catch sight of it again; and still you say, \"Yes, it's a good likeness,\" and \"really those boots are very clever!\" But if it had been your own painting on _glass_, and sitting at your easel you had at last said, \"Yes,--_now_ it's like the drawing--_that's_ the expression,\" you could by no means safely count on being able to say the same at all distances. You may say it at ten feet off, at twenty, and yet at thirty the shades may all gather together into black patches; the drawing of the eyelids and eyes may vanish in one general black blot, the half-tones on the cheeks may all go to nothing. These actual things, for instance, _will_ be the result if the cheeks are stippled or scrubbed, and the shade round the eyes left as a _film_--ever so slight a film will do it. Seen near, you _see the drawing through the film_; but as you go away the light will come pouring stronger and stronger through the brush or stipple marks on the cheeks, until all films will cut out against it like black spots, altering the whole expression past recognition.  Try this on simple terms:--  Do a face on white glass in strong outline only: step back, and the face goes to nothing; strengthen the outline till the forms are quite monstrous--the outline of the nose as broad as the bridge of it--still, at a given distance, it goes to nothing; the expression varies every step back you take. But now, take a matting brush, with a film so thin that it is hardly more than dirty water; put it on the back of the glass (so as not to wash up your outline); badger it flat, so as just to dim the glass less than \"ground glass\" is dimmed;--and you will find your outline look almost the same at each distance. It is the pure light that plays tricks, and it will play them through a pinhole.  And now, finally, let us say that you may do anything you _can_ do in the painting of glass, so long as you do not lay the colour on too thick. The outline-touches should be flat upon the glass, and above all things should not be laid on so wet, or laid on so thick, that the pigment forms into a \"drop\" at the end of the touch; for this drop, and all pigment that is thick upon the glass like that, will \"fry\" when it is put into the kiln: that is to say, being so thick, and standing so far from the surface of the glass, it will fire separately from the glass itself and stand as a separate crust above it, and this will perish.  Plate IX. shows the appearance of the bubbles or blisters in a bit of work that has fried, as seen under a microscope of 20 diameters; and if you are inclined to disregard the danger of this defect as seen of its natural size, when it is a mere roughness on the glass, what do you think of it _now_? You can remove it at once by scraping it with a knife; and indeed, if through accident a touch here and there does fry, it is your only plan to so remove it. All you can scrape off should be scraped off and repainted every time the glass comes from the kiln; and that brings us to the important question of _firing_.     CHAPTER VII       Firing--Three Kinds of Kiln--Advantages and Disadvantages--The      Gas-Kiln--Quick Firing--Danger--Sufficient Firing--Soft      Pigments--Difference in Glasses--\"Stale\" Work--The Scientific      Facts--How to Judge of Firing--Drawing the Kiln.   The way in which the painting is attached to the glass and made permanent is by firing it in a kiln at great heat, and thus fusing the two together.  Simple enough to say, but who is to describe in writing this process in all its forms? For there is, perhaps, nothing in the art of stained-glass on which there is greater diversity of opinion and diversity of practice than this matter of firing. But let us make a beginning by saying that there are, it may be said, three chief modifications of the process.  First, the use of the old, closed, coke or turf kiln.  Second, of the closed gas-kiln.  And third, of the open gas-kiln.  The first consists of a chamber of brick or terra-cotta, in which the glass is placed on a bed of powdered whitening, on iron plates, one above another like shelves, and the whole enclosed in a chamber where the heat is raised by a fire of coke or peat.  This, be it understood, is a slow method. The heat increases gradually, and applies to the glass what the kiln-man calls a \"good, soaking heat.\" The meaning of this expression, of course, is that the gradual heat gives time for the glass and the pigment to fuse together in a natural way, more likely to be good and permanent in its results than a process which takes a twentieth part of the time and which therefore (it is assumed) must wrench the materials more harshly from their nature and state.  There are, it must be admitted, one or two things to be said for this view which require answering.  First, that this form of kiln has the virtue of being old; for in such a thing as this, beyond all manner of doubt, was fired all the splendid stained-glass of the Middle Ages.  Second, that by its use one is entirely preserved from the dangers attached to the _misuse_ of the gas-kiln.  But the answers to these two things are--  First, that the method employed in the Middle Ages did not invariably ensure permanence. Any one who has studied stained-glass must be familiar with cases in which ancient work has faded or perished.  The second claim is answered by the fact, I think beyond dispute, that all objections to the use of the gas-kiln would be removed if it were used properly; it is not the use of it as a process which is in itself dangerous, but merely the misuse of it. People must be content with what is reasonable in the matter; and, knowing that the gas-kiln is spoken of as the \"quick-firing\" kiln, they must not insist on trying to fire _too_ quick.  Now I have the highest authority (that of the makers of both kiln and pigment) to support my own conviction, founded on my own experience, in what I am here going to say.  Observe, then, that up to the point at which actual fusion commences--that is, when pigment and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],["title","Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's Note: A Table of Contents has been created for the reader's convenience.

SANDFORD.  DECEMBER TERM, 1856.   BY BENJAMIN C. HOWARD, FROM THE NINETEENTH VOLUME OF HOWARD'S REPORTS.   WASHINGTON: CORNELIUS WENDELL, PRINTER. 1857.

DECEMBER TERM, 1856.  DRED SCOTT  VERSUS  JOHN F.A. SANDFORD.        DRED SCOTT, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, _v._ JOHN F.A. SANDFORD.       This case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit      Court of the United States for the district of Missouri.       It was an action of trespass _vi et armis_ instituted in the      Circuit Court by Scott against Sandford.       Prior to the institution of the present suit, an action was      brought by Scott for his freedom in the Circuit Court of St.      Louis county, (State court,) where there was a verdict and      judgment in his favor. On a writ of error to the Supreme      Court of the State, the judgment below was reversed, and the      case remanded to the Circuit Court, where it was continued      to await the decision of the case now in question.       The declaration of Scott contained three counts: one, that      Sandford had assaulted the plaintiff; one, that he had      assaulted Harriet Scott, his wife; and one, that he had      assaulted Eliza Scott and Lizzie Scott, his children.       Sandford appeared, and filed the following plea:       DRED SCOTT         }      _v._               } _Plea to the jurisdiction of the Court._      JOHN F.A. SANFORD. }       APRIL TERM, 1854.       And the said John F.A. Sandford, in his own proper person,      comes and says, that this court ought not to have or take      further cognisance of the action aforesaid, because he says      that said cause of action, and each and every of them, (if      any such have accrued to the said Dred Scott,) accrued to      the said Dred Scott out of the jurisdiction of this court,      and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts of      the State of Missouri, for that, to wit: the said plaintiff,      Dred Scott, is not a citizen of the State of Missouri, as      alleged in his declaration, because he is a negro of African      descent; his ancestors were of pure African blood, and were      brought into this country and sold as negro slaves, and this      the said Sandford is ready to verify. Wherefore he prays      judgment, whether this court can or will take further      cognizance of the action aforesaid.       JOHN F.A. SANDFORD.       To this plea there was a demurrer in the usual form, which      was argued in April, 1854, when the court gave judgment that      the demurrer should be sustained.       In May, 1854, the defendant, in pursuance of an agreement      between counsel, and with the leave of the court, pleaded in      bar of the action:       1. Not guilty.       2. That the plaintiff was a negro slave, the lawful property      of the defendant, and, as such, the defendant gently laid      his hands upon him, and thereby had only restrained him, as      the defendant had a right to do.       3. That with respect to the wife and daughters of the      plaintiff, in the second and third counts of the declaration      mentioned, the defendant had, as to them, only acted in the      same manner, and in virtue of the same legal right.       In the first of these pleas, the plaintiff joined issue; and      to the second and third, filed replications alleging that      the defendant, of his own wrong and without the cause in his      second and third pleas alleged, committed the trespasses,      &c.       The counsel then filed the following agreed statement of      facts, viz:       In the year 1834, the plaintiff was a negro slave belonging      to Dr. Emerson, who was a surgeon in the army of the United      States. In that year, 1834, said Dr. Emerson took the      plaintiff from the State of Missouri to the military post at      Rock Island, in the State of Illinois, and held him there as      a slave until the month of April or May, 1836. At the time      last mentioned, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff from      said military post at Rock Island to the military post at      Fort Snelling, situate on the west bank of the Mississippi      river, in the Territory known as Upper Louisiana, acquired      by the United States of France, and situate north of the      latitude of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north, and      north of the State of Missouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the      plaintiff in slavery at Fort Snelling, from said last      mentioned date until the year 1838.       In the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in the second count      of the plaintiff's declaration, was the negro slave of Major      Taliaferro, who belonged to the army of the United States.      In that year, 1835, said Major Taliaferro took said Harriet      to said Fort Snelling, a military post, situated as herein      before stated, and kept her there as a slave until the year      1836, and then sold and delivered her as a slave at said      Fort Snelling unto the said Dr. Emerson herein before named.      Said Dr. Emerson held said Harriet in slavery at said Fort      Snelling until the year 1838.       In the year 1836, the plaintiff and said Harriet, at said      Fort Snelling, with the consent of said Dr. Emerson, who      then claimed to be their master and owner, intermarried, and      took each other for husband and wife. Eliza and Lizzie,      named in the third count of the plaintiff's declaration, are      the fruit of that marriage. Eliza is about fourteen years      old, and was born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of      the north line of the State of Missouri, and upon the river      Mississippi. Lizzie is about seven years old, and was born      in the State of Missouri, at the military post called      Jefferson Barracks.       In the year 1838, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff and      said Harriet, and their said daughter Eliza, from said Fort      Snelling to the State of Missouri, where they have ever      since resided.       Before the commencement of this suit, said Dr. Emerson sold      and conveyed the plaintiff, said Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie,      to the defendant, as slaves, and the defendant has ever      since claimed to hold them, and each of them, as slaves.       At the times mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration, the      defendant, claiming to be owner as aforesaid, laid his hands      upon said plaintiff, Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, and      imprisoned them, doing in this respect, however, no more      than what he might lawfully do, if they were of right his      slaves at such times.       Further proof may be given on the trial for either party.       It is agreed that Dred Scott brought suit for his freedom in      the Circuit Court of St. Louis county; that there was a      verdict and judgment in his favor; that on a writ of error      to the Supreme Court the judgment below was reversed, and      the same remanded to the Circuit Court, where it has been      continued to await the decision of this case.       In May, 1854, the cause went before a jury, who found the      following verdict, viz: \"As to the first issue joined in      this case, we of the jury find the defendant not guilty; and      as to the issue secondly above joined, we of the jury find      that, before and at the time when, &c., in the first count      mentioned, the said Dred Scott was a negro slave, the lawful      property of the defendant; and as to the issue thirdly above      joined, we, the jury, find that, before and at the time      when, &c., in the second and third counts mentioned, the      said Harriet, wife of said Dred Scott, and Eliza and Lizzie,      the daughters of the said Dred Scott, were negro slaves, the      lawful property of the defendant.\"       Whereupon, the court gave judgment for the defendant.       After an ineffectual motion for a new trial, the plaintiff      filed the following bill of exceptions.       On the trial of this cause by the jury, the plaintiff, to      maintain the issues on his part, read to the jury the      following agreed statement of facts, (see agreement above.)      No further testimony was given to the jury by either party.      Thereupon the plaintiff moved the court to give to the jury      the following instruction, viz:       \"That, upon the facts agreed to by the parties, they ought      to find for the plaintiff. The court refused to give such      instruction to the jury, and the plaintiff, to such refusal,      then and there duly excepted.\"       The court then gave the following instruction to the jury,      on motion of the defendant:       \"The jury are instructed, that upon the facts in this case,      the law is with the defendant.\" The plaintiff excepted to      this instruction.       Upon these exceptions, the case came up to this court.       It was argued at December term, 1855, and ordered to be      reargued at the present term.       It was now argued by _Mr. Blair_ and _Mr. G.F. Curtis_      [Transcriber's Note: should be 'G.T. Curtis,' for George      Ticknor Curtis] for the plaintiff in error, and by _Mr.      Geyer_ and _Mr. Johnson_ for the defendant in error.
