Down a bare coldly-lit hallway, down an escalator, into the guts of the island. Another door, a room beyond it, an ungentle shove. The door clashed to behind him.  Dalgetty looked around. The cell was small, bleakly furnished with bunk, toilet and washstand, had a ventilator grille in one wall. Nothing else. He tried listening with maximum sensitivity but there were only remote confused murmurs.  _Dad!_ he thought. _You're here somewhere too._  He flopped on the bunk and spent a moment analyzing the aesthetics of the layout. It had a certain pleasing severity, the unconscious balance of complete functionalism. Soon Dalgetty went back to sleep.  A guard with a breakfast tray woke him. Dalgetty tried to read the man's thoughts but there weren't any to speak of. He ate ravenously under a gun muzzle, gave the tray back and returned to sleep. It was the same at lunch time.  His time-sense told him that it was 1435 hours when he was roused again. There were three men this time, husky specimens. \"Come on,\" said one of them. \"Never saw such a guy for pounding his ear.\"  Dalgetty stood up, running a hand through his hair. The red bristles were scratchy on his palm. It was a cover-up, a substitute symbol to bring his nervous system back under full control. The process felt as if he were being tumbled through a huge gulf.  \"Just how many of your fellows are there here?\" he asked.  \"Enough. Now get going!\"  He caught the whisper of thought--_fifty of us guards, is it? Yeah, fifty, I guess._  Fifty! Dalgetty felt taut as he walked out between two of them. Fifty goons. And they were trained, he knew that. The Institute had learned that Bertrand Meade's private army was well-drilled. Nothing obtrusive about it--officially they were only servants and bodyguards--but they knew how to shoot.  And he was alone in mid-ocean with them. He was alone and no one knew where he was and anything could be done to him. He felt cold, walking down the corridor.  There was a room beyond with benches and a desk. One of the guards gestured to a chair at one end. \"Sit,\" he grunted.  Dalgetty submitted. The straps went around his wrists and ankles, holding him to the arms and legs of the heavy chair. Another buckled about his waist. He looked down and saw that the chair was bolted to the floor. One of the guards crossed to the desk and started up a tape recorder.  A door opened in the far end of the room. Thomas Bancroft came in. He was a big man, fleshy but in well-scrubbed health, his clothes designed with quiet good taste. The head was white-maned, leonine, with handsome florid features and sharp blue eyes. He smiled ever so faintly and sat down behind the desk.  The woman was with him--Dalgetty looked harder at her. She was new to him. She was medium tall, a little on the compact side, her blond hair cut too short, no makeup on her broad Slavic features. Young, in hard condition, moving with a firm masculine stride. With those tilted gray eyes, that delicately curved nose and wide sullen mouth, she could have been a beauty had she wanted to be.  _One of the modern type_, thought Dalgetty. _A flesh-and-blood machine, trying to outmale men, frustrated and unhappy without knowing it and all the more bitter for that._  Briefly there was sorrow in him, an enormous pity for the millions of mankind. They did not know themselves, they fought themselves like wild beasts, tied up in knots, locked in nightmare. Man could be so much if he had the chance.  He glanced at Bancroft. \"I know you,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid the lady has the advantage of me.\"  \"My secretary and general assistant, Miss Casimir.\" The politician's voice was sonorous, a beautifully controlled instrument. He leaned across the desk. The recorder by his elbow whirred in the flat soundproofed stillness.  \"Mr. Dalgetty,\" he said, \"I want you to understand that we aren't fiends. There are things too important for ordinary rules though. Wars have been fought over them in the past and may well be fought again. It will be easier for all concerned if you cooperate with us now. No one need ever know that you have done so.\"  \"Suppose I answer your questions,\" said Dalgetty. \"How do you know I'll be telling the truth?\"  \"Neoscopolamine, of course. I don't think you've been immunized. It confuses the mind too much for us to interrogate you about these complex matters under its influence but we will surely find out if you have been answering our present questions correctly.\"  \"And what then? Do you just let me go?\"  Bancroft shrugged. \"Why shouldn't we? We may have to keep you here for awhile but soon you will have ceased to matter and can safely be released.\"  Dalgetty considered. Not even he could do much against truth drugs. And there were still more radical procedures, prefrontal lobotomy for instance. He shivered. The leatherite straps felt damp against his thin clothing.  He looked at Bancroft. \"What do you really want?\" he asked. \"Why are you working for Bertrand Meade?\"  Bancroft's heavy mouth lifted in a smile. \"I thought you were supposed to answer the questions,\" he said.  \"Whether I do or not depends on whose questions they are,\" said Dalgetty. _Stall for time! Put it off, the moment of terror, put it off!_ \"Frankly, what I know of Meade doesn't make me friendly. But I could be wrong.\"  \"Mr. Meade is a distinguished executive.\"  \"Uh-huh. He's also the power behind a hell of a lot of political figures, including you. He's the real boss of the Actionist movement.\"  \"What do you know of that?\" asked the woman sharply.  \"It's a complicated story,\" said Dalgetty, \"but essentially Actionism is a--a _Weltanschauung_. We're still recovering from the World Wars and their aftermath. People everywhere are swinging away from great vague capitalized causes toward a cooler and clearer view of life.  \"It's analogous to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, which also followed a period of turmoil between conflicting fanaticisms. A belief in reason is growing up even in the popular mind, a spirit of moderation and tolerance. There's a wait-and-see attitude toward everything, including the sciences and particularly the new half-finished science of psychodynamics. The world wants to rest for awhile.  \"Well, such a state of mind has its own drawbacks. It produces wonderful structures of thought but there's something cold about them. There is so little real passion, so much caution--the arts, for instance, are becoming ever more stylized. Old symbols like religion and the sovereign state and a particular form of government, for which men once died, are openly jeered at. We can formulate the semantic condition at the Institute in a very neat equation.  \"And you don't like it. Your kind of man needs something big. And mere concrete bigness isn't enough. You could give your lives to the sciences or to inter-planetary colonization or to social correction, as many people are cheerfully doing--but those aren't for you. Down underneath you miss the universal father-image.  \"You want an almighty Church or an almighty State or an almighty _anything_, a huge misty symbol which demands everything you've got and gives in return only a feeling of belonging.\" Dalgetty's voice was harsh. \"In short, you can't stand on your own psychic feet. You can't face the truth that man is a lonely creature and that his purpose must come from within himself.\"  Bancroft scowled. \"I didn't come here to be lectured,\" he said.  \"Have it your way,\" answered Dalgetty. \"I thought you wanted to know what I knew of Actionism. That's it in unprecise verbal language. Essentially you want to be a Leader in a Cause. Your men, such as aren't merely hired, want to be Followers. Only there isn't a Cause around, these days, except the common-sense one of improving human life.\"  The woman, Casimir, leaned over the desk. There was a curious intensity in her eyes. \"You just pointed out the drawbacks yourself,\" she said. \"This _is_ a decadent period.\"  \"No,\" said Dalgetty. \"Unless you insist on loaded connotations. It's a necessary period of rest. Recoil time for a whole society--well, it all works out neatly in Tighe's formulation. The present state of affairs should continue for about seventy-five years, we feel at the Institute. In that time, reason can--we hope--be so firmly implanted in the basic structure of society that when the next great wave of passion comes it won't turn men against each other.  \"The present is, well, analytic. While we catch our breath we can begin to understand ourselves. When the next synthetic--or creative or crusading period, if you wish--comes, it will be saner than all which have gone before. And man can't afford to go insane again. Not in the same world with the lithium bomb.\"  Bancroft nodded. \"And you in the Institute are trying to control this process,\" he said. \"You're trying to stretch out the period of--damn it, of decadence! Oh, I've studied the modern school system too, Dalgetty. I know how subtly the rising generation is being indoctrinated--through policies formulated by _your_ men in the government.\"  \"Indoctrinated? Trained, I would say. Trained in self-restraint and critical thinking.\" Dalgetty grinned with one side of his mouth. \"Well, we aren't here to argue generalities. Specifically Meade feels he has a mission. He is the natural leader of America--ultimately, through the U.N., in which we are still powerful, the world. He wants to restore what he calls 'ancestral virtues'--you see, I've listened to his speeches and yours, Bancroft.  \"These virtues consist of obedience, physical _and_ mental, to 'constituted authority'--of 'dynamism,' which operationally speaking means people ought to jump when he gives an order--of .... Oh, why go on? It's the old story. Power hunger, the recreation of the Absolute State, this time on a planetary scale.  \"With psychological appeals to some and with promises of reward to others he's built up quite a following. But he's shrewd enough "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31501"],["title","The Sensitive Man (#5)"],["body","know that he can't just stage a revolution. He has to make people want him. He has to reverse the social current until it swings back to authoritarianism--with him riding the crest.  \"And that of course is where the Institute comes in. Yes, we have developed theories which make at least a beginning at explaining the facts of history. It was a matter not so much of gathering data as of inventing a rigorous self-correcting symbology and our paramathematics seems to be just that. We haven't published all of our findings because of the uses to which they could be put. If you know exactly how to go about it you can shape world society into almost any image you want--in fifty years or less! You want that knowledge of ours for your purposes!\"  Dalgetty fell silent. There was a long quietness. His own breathing seemed unnaturally loud.  \"All right.\" Bancroft nodded again, slowly. \"You haven't told us anything we don't know.\"  \"I'm well aware of that,\" said Dalgetty.  \"Your phrasing was rather unfriendly,\" said Bancroft. \"What you don't appreciate is the revolting stagnation and cynicism of this age.\"  \"Now you're using the loaded words,\" said Dalgetty. \"Facts just _are_. There's no use passing moral judgments on reality, the only thing you can do is try to change it.\"  \"Yes,\" said Bancroft. \"All right then, we're trying. Do you want to help us?\"  \"You could beat the hell out of me,\" said Dalgetty, \"but it wouldn't teach you a science that it takes years to learn.\"  \"No, but we'd know just what you have and where to find it. We have some good brains on our side. Given your data and equations they can figure it out.\" The pale eyes grew wholly chill. \"You don't seem to appreciate your situation. You're a prisoner, understand?\"  Dalgetty braced his muscles. He didn't reply.  Bancroft sighed. \"Bring him in,\" he said.  One of the guards went out. Dalgetty's heart stumbled. _Dad_, he thought. It was anguish in him. Casimir walked over to stand in front of him. Her eyes searched his.  \"Don't be a fool,\" she said. \"It hurts worse than you know. Tell us.\"  He looked up at her. _I'm afraid_, he thought. _God knows I'm afraid._ His own sweat was acrid in his nostrils. \"No,\" he said.  \"I tell you they'll do everything!\" She had a nice voice, low and soft, but it roughened now. Her face was colorless with strain. \"Go on man, don't condemn yourself to--mindlessness!\"  There was something strange here. Dalgetty's senses began to reach out. She was leaning close and he knew the signs of horror even if she tried to hide them. _She's not so hard as she makes out--but then why is she with them?_  He threw a bluff. \"I know who you are,\" he said. \"Shall I tell your friends?\"  \"No, you don't!\" She stepped back, rigid, and his whetted senses caught the fear-smell. In a moment there was control and she said, \"All right then, have it your way.\"  And underneath, the thought, slowed by the gluiness of panic, _Does he know I'm FBI?_  _FBI!_ He jerked against the straps. Ye gods!  Calmness returned to him as she walked to her chief but his mind whirred. Yes, why not? Institute men had little connection with the Federal detectives, who, since the abolition of a discredited Security, had resumed a broad function. They might easily have become dubious about Bertrand Meade on their own, have planted operatives with him. They had women among them too and a woman was always less conspicuous than a man.  He felt a chill. The last thing he wanted was a Federal agent here.  The door opened again. A quartet of guards brought in Michael Tighe. The Briton halted, staring before him. \"_Simon!_\" It was a harsh sound, full of pain.  \"Have they hurt you, Dad?\" asked Dalgetty very gently.  \"No, no--not till now.\" The gray head shook. \"But you....\"  \"Take it easy, Dad,\" said Dalgetty.  The guards hustled Tighe over to a front-row bench and sat him down. Old man and young locked eyes across the bare space.  Tighe spoke to him in the hidden way. _What are you going to do? I can't sit and let them--_  Dalgetty could not reply unheard but he shook his head. \"I'll be okay,\" he answered aloud.  _Do you think you can make a break? I'll try to help you._  \"No,\" said Dalgetty. \"Whatever happens you lie low. That's an order.\"  He blocked off sensitivity as Bancroft snapped, \"Enough. One of you is going to yield. If Dr. Tighe won't, then we'll work on him and see if Mr. Dalgetty can hold out.\"  He waved his hand as he took out a cigar. Two of the goons stepped up to the chair. They had rubberite hoses in their hands.  The first blow thudded against Dalgetty's ribs. He didn't feel it--he had thrown up a nerve bloc--but it rattled his teeth together. And while he was insensitive he'd be unable to listen in on....  Another thud, and another. Dalgetty clenched his fists. What to do, what to do? He looked over to the desk. Bancroft was smoking and watching as dispassionately as if it were some mildly interesting experiment. Casimir had turned her back.  \"Something funny here, chief.\" One of the goons straightened. \"I don't think he's feeling nothing.\"  \"Doped?\" Bancroft frowned. \"No, that's hardly possible.\" He rubbed his chin, regarding Dalgetty with wondering eyes. Casimir wheeled around to stare. Sweat filmed Michael Tighe's face, glistening in the chill white light.  \"He can still be hurt,\" said the guard.  Bancroft winced. \"I don't like outright mutilation,\" he said. \"But still--I've warned you, Dalgetty.\"  \"_Get out, Simon_,\" whispered Tighe. \"_Get out of here._\"  Dalgetty's red head lifted. Decision crystalized within him. He would be no use to anyone with a broken leg, a crushed foot, an eye knocked out, seared lungs--and Casimir was FBI, she might be able to do something at this end in spite of all.  He tested the straps. A quarter inch of leatherite--he could snap them but would he break his bones doing it?  _Only one way to find out_, he thought bleakly.  \"I'll get a blowtorch,\" said one of the guards in the rear of the room. His face was wholly impassive. Most of these goons must be moronic, thought Dalgetty. Most of the guards in the twentieth-century extermination camps had been. No inconvenient empathy with the human flesh they broke and flayed and burned.  He gathered himself. This time it was rage, a cloud of fury rising in his mind, a ragged red haze across his vision. That they would _dare_!  He snarled as the strength surged up in him. He didn't even feel the straps as they popped across. The same movement hurtled him across the room toward the door.  Someone yelled. A guard leaped in his path, a giant of a man. Dalgetty's fist sprang before him, there was a cracking sound and the goon's head snapped back against his own spine. Dalgetty was already past him. The door was shut in his face. Wood crashed as he went through it.  A bullet wailed after him. He dodged down the corridor, up the nearest steps, the walls blurred with his own speed. Another slug smacked into the paneling beside him. He rounded a corner, saw a window and covered his eyes with an arm as he leaped.  The plastic was tough but a hundred and seventy pounds hit it at fifteen feet per second. Dalgetty went through!  Sunlight flamed in his eyes as he hit the ground. Rolling over and bouncing to his feet he set out across lawn and garden. As he ran his vision swept the landscape. In that state of fear and wrath he could not command much thought but his memory stored the data for re-examination.   V  The house was a rambling two-story affair, all curves and planes between palm trees, the island sloping swiftly from its front to a beach and dock. On one side was the airfield, on another the guard barracks. To the rear, in the direction of Dalgetty's movement, the ground became rough and wild, stones and sand and saw-grass and clumps of palmettos, climbing upward for a good two miles. On every side, he could see the infinite blue sparkle of ocean. Where could he hide?  He didn't notice the slashing blades through which he raced and the dry gulping of his lungs was something dreadfully remote. But when a bullet went past one ear, he heard that and drew more speed from some unknown depth. A glance behind revealed his pursuers boiling out of the house, men in gray with the hot sunlight blinking off their guns.  He ducked around a thicket, flopped and belly-crawled over a rise of land. On the farther side he straightened again and ran up the long slope. Another slug and another. They were almost a mile behind now but their guns had a long reach. He bent low, zigzagging as he ran. The bullets kicked up spurts of sand around him.  A six-foot bluff loomed in his path, black volcanic rock shining like wet glass. He hit it at full speed. He almost _walked_ up its face and in the instant when his momentum was gone caught a root and yanked himself to the top. Again he was out of their sight. He sprang around another hulk of stone and skidded to a halt. At his feet, a sheer cliff dropped nearly a hundred feet to a white smother of surf.  Dalgetty gulped air, working his lungs like a bellows. A long jump down, he thought dizzily. If he didn't crack his skull open on a reef he might well be clawed under by the sea. But there was no other place for him to go.  He made a swift estimate. He had run the upward two miles in a little over nine minutes, surely a record for such terrain. It would take the pursuit another ten or fifteen to reach him. But he couldn't double back without being seen and this time they'd be close enough to fill him with lead.  _Okay, son_, he told himself. _You're going to duck now, in more than one sense._  His light waterproof clothes, tattered by the island growth, would be no hindrance down there, but he took off his sandals and stuck them in his belt pouch. Praise all gods, the physical side of his training had included water sports. He moved along the cliff edge, looking for a place to dive. The wind whined at his feet.  There--down there. No visible rocks though the surf boiled and"]]]
