Providing, as I've said, that the student working with it has attained a certain minimum level of Insight, it greatly accelerates his progress towards Total Insight. Very greatly!  \"Now, as I have implied before: as one approaches the goal of Total Insight, the ailments and diseases which commonly afflict humanity simply disappear. Unfortunately, I am not yet free to show you proof for this, although I have the proof and believe it will not be long before it can be revealed at least to the members of this group. For this reason, I have preferred not to say too much on the point.... Yes, Reuben? You have a question?\"  \"Two questions, Dr. Al,\" Reuben Jeffries said. \"First, is it your opinion that our group has now reached the minimum level of Insight that makes it possible to work with those instruments?\"  Ormond nodded emphatically. \"Yes, it has. After tonight's occurrence there is no further question about that.\"  \"Then,\" Jeffries said, \"my second question is simply--_when do we start?_\"  There was laughter, a scattering of applause. Ormond smiled, said, \"An excellent question, Reuben! The answer is that a number of you will start immediately.  \"A limited quantity of the instruments--fifteen, I believe--are available now on the premises, stored in my office. Within a few weeks I will have enough on hand to supply as many of you as wish to speed up their progress by this method. Since the group's contributions paid my research expenses, I cannot in justice ask more from you individually now than the actual cost in material and labor for each instrument. The figure ... I have it somewhere ... oh, yes!\" Ormond pulled a notebook from his pocket, consulted it, looked up and said, mildly, \"Twelve hundred dollars will be adequate, I think.\"  Cavender's lips twitched sardonically. Three or four of the group might have flinched inwardly at the price tag, but on the whole they were simply too well heeled to give such a detail another thought. Checkbooks were coming hurriedly into sight all around the lecture room. Reuben Jeffries, unfolding his, announced, \"Dr. Al, I'm taking one of the fifteen.\"  Half the students turned indignantly to stare at him. \"Now wait a minute, Reuben!\" someone said. \"That isn't fair! It's obvious there aren't enough to go around.\"  Jeffries smiled at him. \"That's why I spoke up, Warren!\" He appealed to Ormond. \"How about it, Dr. Al?\"  Ormond observed judiciously, \"It seems fair enough to me. Eleanor, of course, is retaining the instrument with which she has been working. As for the rest of you--first come, first served, you know! If others would like to have Mavis put down their names....\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a brief hubbub as this suggestion was acted on. Mavis, Dexter Jones and Perrie Rochelle then went to the office to get the instruments, while Dr. Ormond consoled the students who had found themselves left out. It would be merely a matter of days before the new instruments began to come in ... and yes, they could leave their checks in advance. When he suggested tactfully that financial arrangements could be made if necessary, the less affluent also brightened up.  Fifteen identical red alligator-hide suitcases appeared and were lined up beside Ormond's table. He announced that a preliminary demonstration with the instrument would be made as soon as those on hand had been distributed. Mavis Greenfield, standing beside him, began to read off the names she had taken down.  Reuben Jeffries was the fifth to come up to the table, hand Ormond his check and receive a suitcase from the secretary. Then Cavender got unhurriedly to his feet.  \"Dr. Ormond,\" he said, loudly enough to center the attention of everyone in the room on him, \"may I have the floor for a moment?\"  Ormond appeared surprised, then startled. His glance went up to Reuben Jeffries, still standing stolidly beside him, and his face slowly whitened.  \"Why ... well, yes, Wally.\" His voice seemed unsteady. \"What's on your mind?\"  Cavender faced the right side of the room and the questioning faces turned towards him.  [Illustration]  \"My name, as you know,\" he told the advanced students, \"is Wallace Cavender. What you haven't known so far is that I am a police detective, rank of lieutenant, currently attached to the police force of this city and in temporary charge of its bunco squad.\"  He shifted his gaze towards the front of the room. Ormond's eyes met his for a moment, then dropped.  \"Dr. Ormond,\" Cavender said, \"you're under arrest. The immediate charge, let's say, is practicing medicine without a license. Don't worry about whether we can make it stick or not. We'll have three or four others worked up by the time we get you downtown.\"  For a moment, there was a shocked, frozen stillness in the lecture room. Dr. Ormond's hand began to move out quietly towards the checks lying on the table before him. Reuben Jeffries' big hand got there first.  \"I'll take care of these for now, Dr. Al,\" Jeffries said with a friendly smile. \"The lieutenant thinks he wants them.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Not much more than thirty minutes later, Cavender unlocked the door to Dr. Ormond's private office, went inside, leaving the door open behind him, and sat down at Ormond's desk. He rubbed his aching eyes, yawned, lit a cigarette, looked about in vain for an ashtray, finally emptied a small dish of paper clips on the desk and placed the dish conveniently close to him.  There had been an indignant uproar about Dr. Al's arrest for a while, but it ended abruptly when uniformed policemen appeared in the two exit doors and the sobering thought struck the students that any publicity given the matter could make them look personally ridiculous and do damage to their business and social standing.  Cavender had calmed their fears. It was conceivable, he said, that the district attorney's office would wish to confer with some of them privately, in connection with charges to be brought against William Fitzgerald Grady--which, so far as the police had been able to establish, was Dr. Ormond's real name. However, their association with the Institute of Insight would not be made public, and any proceedings would be carried out with the discretion that could be fully expected by blameless citizens of their status in the community.  They were fortunate, Cavender went on, in another respect. Probably none of them had been aware of just how much Grady had milked from the group chiefly through quiet private contributions and donations during the two years he was running the Institute. The sum came to better than two hundred thousand dollars. Grady naturally had wasted none of this in \"research\" and he was not a spendthrift in other ways. Cavender was, therefore, happy to say that around two thirds of this money was known to be still intact in various bank accounts, and that it would be restored eventually to the generous but misled donors.  Dr. Al's ex-students were beginning to look both chastened and very much relieved. Cavender briefly covered a few more points to eliminate remaining doubts. He touched on Grady's early record as a confidence man and blackmailer, mentioned the two terms he had spent in prison and the fact that for the last eighteen years he had confined himself to operations like the Institute of Insight where risks were less. The profits, if anything, had been higher because Grady had learned that it paid off, in the long run, to deal exclusively with wealthy citizens and he was endowed with the kind of personality needed to overcome the caution natural to that class. As for the unusual experiences about which some of them might be now thinking, these, Cavender concluded, should be considered in the light of the fact that Grady had made his living at one time as a stage magician and hypnotist, working effectively both with and without trained accomplices.  The lecture had gone over very well, as he'd known it would. The ex-students left for their homes, a subdued and shaken group, grateful for having been rescued from an evil man's toils. Even Mrs. Folsom, who had announced at one point that she believed she had a heart attack coming on, recovered sufficiently to thank Cavender and assure him that in future she would take her problems only to a reliable physician.         *       *       *       *       *  Footsteps were coming down the short hall from the back of the building. Then Reuben Jeffries' voice said, \"Go into the office. The lieutenant's waiting for you there.\"  Cavender stubbed out his cigarette as Dexter Jones, Perrie Rochelle and Mavis Greenfield filed into the office. Jeffries closed the door behind them from the hall and went off.  \"Sit down,\" Cavender said, lighting a fresh cigarette.  They selected chairs and settled down stiffly, facing him. All three looked anxious and pale; and Perrie's face was tear-stained.  Cavender said, \"I suppose you've been wondering why I had Sergeant Jeffries tell you three to stay behind.\"  Perrie began, her eyes and voice rather wild, \"Mr. Cavender ... Lieutenant Cavender....\"  \"Either will do,\" Cavender said.  \"Mr. Cavender, I swear you're wrong! We didn't have anything to do with Dr. Al's ... Mr. Grady's cheating those people! At least, I didn't. I swear it!\"  \"I didn't say you had anything to do with it, Perrie,\" Cavender remarked. \"Personally I think none of you had anything to do with it. Not voluntarily, at any rate.\"  He could almost feel them go limp with relief. He waited. After a second or two, Perrie's eyes got the wild look back. \"But....\"  \"Yes?\" Cavender asked.  Perrie glanced at Dexter Jones, at Mavis.  \"But then what _did_ happen?\" she asked bewilderedly, of the other two as much as of Cavender. \"Mr. Cavender, I saw something appear on that plate! I know it did. It was a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30764"],["title","Ham Sandwich (#4)"],["body","wich. It looked perfectly natural. I don't think it could have possibly been something Mr. Grady did with mirrors. And how could it have had the paper napkin Mavis had just been thinking about wrapped around it, unless....\"  \"Unless it actually was a materialization of a mental image you'd created between you?\" Cavender said. \"Now settle back and relax, Perrie. There's a more reasonable explanation for what happened tonight than that.\"  He waited a moment, went on. \"Grady's one real interest is money and since none of you have any to speak of, his interest in you was that you could help him get it. Perrie and Dexter showed some genuine talent to start with, in the line of guessing what card somebody was thinking about and the like. It's not too unusual an ability, and in itself it wasn't too useful to Grady.  \"But he worked on your interest in the subject. All the other students, the paying students, had to lose was a sizable amount of cash ... with the exception of Mrs. Folsom who's been the next thing to a flip for years anyway. She was in danger. And you three stood a good chance of letting Grady wreck your lives. I said he's a competent hypnotist. He is. Also a completely ruthless one.\"  He looked at Mavis. \"As far as I know, Mavis, you haven't ever demonstrated that you have any interesting extrasensory talents like Dexter's and Perrie's. Rather the contrary. Right?\"  She nodded, her eyes huge.  \"I've always tested negative. Way down negative. That's why I was really rather shocked when that.... Of course, I've always been fascinated by such things. And he insisted it would show up in me sometime.\"  \"And,\" Cavender said, \"several times a week you had special little training sessions with him, just as his two star pupils here did, to help it show up. You were another perfect stooge, from Grady's point of view. Well, what it amounts to is that Grady was preparing to make his big final killing off this group before he disappeared from the city. He would have collected close to thirty thousand dollars tonight, and probably twice as much again within the next month or so before any of the students began to suspect seriously that Dr. Al's instruments could be the meaningless contraptions they are.  \"You three have been hypnotically conditioned to a fare-you-well in those little private sessions you've had with him. During the past week you were set up for the role you were to play tonight. When you got your cue--at a guess it was Mrs. Folsom's claim that she'd seen the ham sandwich materialize--you started seeing, saying, acting, and thinking exactly as you'd been told to see, say, act, and think. There's no more mystery about it than that. And in my opinion you're three extremely fortunate young people in that we were ready to move in on Grady when we were.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was silence for a moment. Then Perrie Rochelle said hesitantly, \"Then Mrs. Folsom....\"  \"Mrs. Folsom,\" Cavender said, \"has also enjoyed the benefits of many private sessions with Grady. She, of course, was additionally paying very handsomely for them. Tonight, she reported seeing what she'd been told to report seeing, to set off the hypnotic chain reaction.\"  \"But,\" Perrie said, \"she said her heart attacks stopped after she started using the instrument. I really don't see how that could have been just her imagination?\"  \"Very easily,\" Cavender said. \"I've talked with her physician. Mrs. Folsom belongs to a not uncommon type of people whose tickers are as sound as yours or mine, but who are convinced they have a serious heart ailment and can dish up symptoms impressive enough to fool anyone but an informed professional. They can stop dishing them up just as readily if they think they've been cured.\" He smiled faintly. \"You look as if you might be finally convinced, Perrie.\"  She nodded. \"I ... yes, I guess so. I guess I am.\"  \"All right,\" Cavender said. He stood up. \"You three can run along then. You won't be officially involved in this matter, and no one's going to bother you. If you want to go on playing around with E.S.P. and so forth, that's your business. But I trust that in future you'll have the good sense to keep away from characters like Grady. Periods of confusion, chronic nightmares--even chronic headaches--are a good sign you're asking for bad trouble in that area.\"  They thanked him, started out of the office in obvious relief. At the door, Perrie Rochelle hesitated, looked back.  \"Mr. Cavender....\"  \"Yes?\"  \"You don't think I ... I need....\"  \"Psychiatric help? No. But I understand,\" Cavender said, \"that you have a sister in Maine who's been wanting you to spend the summer with her. I think that's a fine idea! A month or two of sun and salt water is exactly what you can use to drive the last of this nonsense out of your mind again. So good night to the three of you, and good luck!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cavender snapped the top of the squat little thermos flask back in place and restored it to the glove compartment of Jeffries' car. He brushed a few crumbs from the knees of his trousers and settled back in the seat, discovering he no longer felt nearly as tired and washed out as he had been an hour ago in the lecture room. A few cups of coffee and a little nourishment could do wonders for a man, even at the tail end of a week of hard work.  The last light in the Institute building across the street went out and Cavender heard the click of the front door. The bulky figure of Detective Sergeant Reuben Jeffries stood silhouetted for a moment in the street lights on the entrance steps. Then Jeffries came down the steps and crossed the street to the car.  \"All done?\" Cavender asked.  \"All done,\" Jeffries said through the window. He opened the door, eased himself in behind the wheel and closed the door.  \"They took Grady away by the back entrance,\" he told Cavender. \"The records in his files ... he wasn't keeping much, of course ... and the stuff in the safe and those instruments went along with him. He was very co-operative. He's had a real scare.\"  Cavender grunted. \"He'll get over it.\"  Jeffries hesitated, said, \"I'm something of a Johnny-come-lately in this line of work, you know. I'd be interested in hearing how it's handled from here on.\"  \"In this case it will be pretty well standard procedure,\" Cavender said. \"Tomorrow around noon I'll have Grady brought in to see me. I'll be in a curt and bitter mood--the frustrated honest cop. I'll tell him he's in luck. The D. A.'s office has informed me that because of the important names involved in this fraud case, and because all but around forty thousand dollars of the money he collected in this town have been recovered, they've decided not to prosecute. He'll have till midnight to clear out. If he ever shows up again, he gets the book.\"  \"Why leave him the forty thousand?\" Jeffries asked. \"I understood they know darn well where it's stashed.\"  Cavender shrugged. \"The man's put in two years of work, Reuben. If we clean him, he might get discouraged enough to get out of the racket and try something else. As it is, he'll have something like the Institute of Insight going again in another city three months from now. In an area that hasn't been cropped over recently. He's good in that line ... one of the best, in fact.\"  Jeffries thoughtfully started the car, pulled out from the curb. Halfway down the block, he remarked, \"You gave me the go-ahead sign with the cigarette right after the Greenfield girl claimed she'd put the paper napkin into that image. Does that mean you finally came to a decision about her?\"  \"Uh-huh.\"  Jeffries glanced over at him, asked, \"Is there any secret about how you're able to spot them?\"  \"No ... except that I don't know. If I could describe to anyone how to go about it, we might have our work cut in half. But I can't, and neither can any other spotter. It's simply a long, tedious process of staying in contact with people you have some reason to suspect of being the genuine article. If they are, you know it eventually. But if it weren't that men with Grady's type of personality attract them somehow from ten miles around, we'd have no practical means at present of screening prospects out of the general population. You can't distinguish one of them from anyone else if he's just walking past you on the street.\"  Jeffries brought the car to a halt at a stop light.  \"That's about the way I'd heard it,\" he acknowledged. \"What about negative spotting? Is there a chance there might be an undiscovered latent left among our recent fellow students?\"  \"No chance at all,\" Cavender said. \"The process works both ways. If they aren't, you also know it eventually--and I was sure of everyone but Greenfield over three weeks ago. She's got as tough a set of obscuring defenses as I've ever worked against. But after the jolt she got tonight, she came through clear immediately.\"  The light changed and the car started up. Jeffries asked, \"You feel both of them can be rehabilitated?\"  \"Definitely,\" Cavender said. \"Another three months of Grady's pseudoyoga might have ruined them for good. But give them around a year to settle out and they'll be all right. Then they'll get the call. It's been worth the trouble. Jones is good medium grade--and that Greenfield! She'll be a powerhouse before she's half developed. Easily the most promising prospect I've come across in six years.\"  \"You're just as certain about Perrie Rochelle?\"  \"Uh-huh. Protopsi--fairly typical. She's developed as far as she ever will. It would be a complete waste of time to call her. You can't train something that just isn't there.\"  Jeffries grunted. \"Never make a mistake, eh?\"  Cavender yawned, smiled. \"Never have yet, Reuben! Not in that area.\"  \"How did you explain the sandwich to them--and Greenfield's napkin? They couldn't have bought your stage magic idea.\"  \"No. Told them those were Dr. Al's posthypnotic suggestions. It's the other standard rationalization.\"   "]]]
