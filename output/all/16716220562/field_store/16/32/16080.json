Somehow Spot grew up faster than Johnnie. He had stopped being a puppy by the time his young master learned to walk. And when Johnnie was big enough to play around the farm buildings his parents felt sure that he was safe so long as \"old Spot,\" as they called the dog, was with him.  Spot thought himself years older than the small boy; or at least he always acted so. If a goose hissed at little, toddling Johnnie Green, old Spot would drive the goose away, barking in a loud voice, \"Don't you frighten this child!\" If Johnnie went into the stable and wandered within reach of the horses' heels Spot would take hold of his clothes and draw him gently back out of danger. And if Johnnie strayed to the duck pond the old dog wouldn't leave him even to chase the cat, but stayed right there by the pond, ready to pull his young charge out of the water in case he happened to fall in.  Spot seemed to enjoy his task of taking care of Johnnie Green. It wasn't all work. A great deal of pleasure went with his duties, for Johnnie Green never wanted to do anything but play. And Spot wasn't so grown up that he couldn't enjoy a lively romp. For that matter, he never did get over his liking for boisterous fun.  Still, there were some kinds of sport that he didn't care for. He wasn't fond of having such things as tin cans tied to his tail. He disliked to be harnessed to a toy wagon. He hated to have his ears pulled. Yet there was only one offense that ever made him growl. When Johnnie Green took a bone away from him Spot couldn't help warning him, with a deep, rumbling grumbling, that he was going too far, even between friends. But he never snapped at Johnnie. That growling was only Spot's way of teaching Johnnie Green manners.  Fond as he was of his young master, Spot did not care to spend all his time playing childish games. There were grown-up things that he liked to do--things in which a toddler like Johnnie Green couldn't take part. Around the farmhouse there were always the cat to be teased and squirrels to be chased into trees. In the pasture there were woodchucks to be hunted; and even if he couldn't catch them it was fun to see those fat fellows tumble into their holes.  Then there were the cows. Spot loved to help Farmer Green drive them home late in the afternoon. He acted very important when he went for the cows, always pretending that it was hard work, though he really thought it great sport.  Sometimes when Johnnie Green wanted to play with Spot the old dog couldn't be found anywhere. He might be over the hill, visiting a neighbor's dog. He might be in the woods, looking for birds. He might even have followed a wagon to the village.  As Johnnie Green grew older he roamed through the woods with Spot. And when Johnnie's father at last let him own a gun, old Spot was as pleased as Johnnie was.  \"I've been waiting for this event for several years,\" Spot told the Muley Cow.  She did not share his delight.  \"For pity's sake, keep that boy and his gun out of the pasture!\" she bellowed. \"It frightens me to have him come near me with his blunderbuss.\"  Old Spot gave her a pitying look.  \"It's plain,\" he said, \"that you don't come from a sporting family, as I do, or you'd never speak in that fashion of a nice new shotgun. You know I'm a sporting dog. I'm a pointer. I point out the game for the hunters.\"  The Muley Cow gave a sort of snort and tossed her head.  \"It's lucky for Johnnie Green,\" she sniffed, \"that I'm not a sporting cow, or he might not have any butter on his bread.\"     II  TEASING THE CAT   When Miss Kitty Cat came to the farmhouse to live she soon showed old dog Spot that she could fight like a vixen. The first time he cornered her she put some scratches on his nose that he never forgot. And after that he always took great pains to keep out of reach of Miss Kitty's claws.  So long as Miss Kitty Cat ran away from him Spot would follow her, yelping madly. But when she stopped, he stopped too, digging his own claws into the dirt in order to leave a safe distance between Miss Kitty and his nose.  He quickly discovered that there were ways in which he could tease Miss Kitty Cat that annoyed her greatly, while keeping his nose out of harm's way. Growling always made her tail grow big. Barking made her spit at him. But there was something else that angered her still more. When Spot stood stock still one day, with his tail stuck straight out behind him, and pointed at her with his nose, he made her almost frantic.  \"What are you pointing at with that long nose of yours?\" Miss Kitty Cat snarled.  Spot didn't say a word. For the moment he didn't move any more than the iron dog did, that stood in a yard on the outskirts of the village and never so much as wagged his tail from one year's end to another.  Somehow Spot's queer behavior gave Miss Kitty Cat an odd, creepy feeling along her back. Her fur rose on end. She glared at Spot and spat at him in a most unladylike fashion.  Spot found it very hard to stand still and never let out a single yelp. Once he almost whined. But he managed to stifle the sound.  \"If she swells up much more she's likely to burst,\" he thought.  \"Go away!\" Miss Kitty scolded. \"Don't you know better than to stare at a lady?\"  Never an answer did old Spot make.  It was a little more than Miss Kitty Cat could endure. With a yowl that had in it something of anger and something of fear, too, she jumped off the doorstep where she had been sitting and whisked around the corner of the house.  With Miss Kitty's first leap Spot came suddenly to life. He barked joyfully and followed her. Miss Kitty Cat ran up a tree in the yard and stayed there until Spot went off chuckling.  \"I'm glad I played that trick on her,\" he said to himself. \"It seems to bother her more than anything else I've ever tried.\"  Thereafter Spot often pointed at Miss Kitty when he met her, either inside the house or about the yard. And she never failed to fly into a passion.  \"Such manners I never saw!\" she spluttered when she talked one day with a cat from the nearest farmhouse.  \"I'd soon cure the old dog of that unpleasant trick if he tried it on me,\" her neighbor remarked.  \"What would you do?\" Miss Kitty Cat wanted to know.  \"I'd chase him.\"  \"He can run faster than I can,\" said Miss Kitty.  \"When he's pointing at you, jump at him before he can turn around. If you drag your claws across his nose just once he'll be careful after that to look the other way when he sees you.\"  \"Your plan sounds as if it might be worth trying,\" said Miss Kitty thoughtfully.     III  A WILD DOG   Old dog Spot felt greatly pleased with himself. He had told everybody that would listen to him how he could make Miss Kitty Cat angry just by standing still and pointing at her.  \"You'd better leave that cat alone,\" the old horse Ebenezer advised him. \"Don't you remember how she clawed you when you cornered her in this barn one day?\"  \"I remember--yes!\" Spot admitted, as he looked cross-eyed at his nose, which still bore the marks of Miss Kitty's claws. \"I'm careful not to stand too near her,\" he explained. \"I don't try to grab her. I just stare at her. And she gets wild.\"  \"A wild cat,\" old Ebenezer warned him, \"is a dangerous creature.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said Spot. \"She always sneaks away after I've pointed at her for a few minutes. It's the funniest sight! If you could see it once you'd know she was terribly afraid of me.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said the old horse Ebenezer. But he couldn't make Spot believe there was the slightest danger in teasing Miss Kitty Cat.  \"She always runs up a tree after I've been pointing at her,\" Spot went on.  \"You'd better look out!\" Ebenezer cautioned him. \"She'll have you climbing a tree the first thing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],["title","The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#1)"],["body","know.\"  Well, that made Spot laugh. And he went out of the barn feeling even more pleased with himself than ever. He was sorry that Miss Kitty Cat wasn't in the yard. He felt just like bothering her.  \"I'll go up to the pasture and find me a woodchuck to chase,\" Spot said to himself, for he was in such high spirits that he simply had to have fun of some sort.  First, however, he decided to stop and dig up a bone that he had buried in the flower garden. So he trotted across the yard. And as he drew near the farmhouse he changed his plans all at once. He forgot his bone and he forgot his woodchuck, too. For he caught sight of something that had escaped his eye before. Stretched on the ledge outside one of the kitchen windows Miss Kitty Cat was enjoying a nap in the sunshine.  \"Aha!\" said Spot very softly. \"Aha! Here's a bit of luck.\" And he turned sharply aside and hurried towards the house, to come to a dead stop beneath the window and stand there motionless with his nose pointing at the sleeping form of Miss Kitty.  Though Spot didn't make the slightest noise the sleeper suddenly opened her eyes.  \"_Tchah!_\" she exclaimed, springing to her feet and glaring at her annoyer.  If the window hadn't been closed no doubt Miss Kitty would have slipped through it into the kitchen. But there was no escape that way.  \"It's a pity,\" she muttered, \"that a person can't take a cat nap without being stared at by this old dog. I think it's about time I took my neighbor's advice and taught him to keep his eyes and his nose where they belong.\"  Then Miss Kitty Cat jumped. She jumped off the window ledge straight at old dog Spot, who was still gazing up at her from below.  When he saw her coming he gave a startled yelp and tried to dodge her. But he was too slow. Miss Kitty Cat landed squarely on his back and clawed him savagely.  Old Spot dashed half way across the farmyard, then dropped suddenly and rolled over and over on the ground.  The next instant he was on his feet again and tearing toward the barn. Though Miss Kitty had dropped off his back and was already on her way to the house he did not look around to see what had become of her.  Spot bolted through the barn door and scurried into an empty stall, where he jumped into the manger and cowered down in the hay that half filled it, and moaned.  [Illustration: Spot Bolted Through the Barn Door.  (_Page 16_)]  It was the stall next to the old horse Ebenezer's. And that mild fellow peered over at him in wonder. \"What has happened?\" he inquired.  \"The cat scratched me,\" Spot told him. \"I was teasing her and she wasn't at all nice about it.\"  \"What were you doing--pointing at her?\" Ebenezer asked him.  \"Yes!\"  \"I suppose it made her wild,\" the old horse remarked. \"And a wild cat is a dangerous creature.\"  Spot whined fretfully. He wished he could lick his wounds. But how can one lick scratches when they are behind one's ears?  \"I was a wild dog for a few moments,\" he groaned. \"I never dreamed she would plump down on me like that.\"  \"Haven't you ever heard of it's raining cats and dogs?\" Ebenezer said. \"Well, to-day it rained cats.\"     IV  THE WOODPILE   Farmer Green always had a woodpile in the back yard. Sometimes it was big. Sometimes it was little. Sometimes it was mostly made up of four-foot logs. Sometimes the logs were all split and sawed, ready to burn.  When Farmer Green and the hired man had nothing more pressing to do they set to work on the woodpile. It was surprising how fast the big sticks grew into firewood under their axes and saws.  One day they started sawing and splitting when Johnnie Green and old dog Spot were roaming through the woods. And when Johnnie and Spot came back home, just in time for dinner, they found a great heap of firewood lying on the ground where there had been nothing but dirt when they started for the woods some hours before.  Old dog Spot ran straight to the woodpile and began sniffing and scratching and whining.  If Johnnie Green hadn't been hungry he would have paid more heed to Spot's behavior. But the men had already gone into the house. And Johnnie hurried after them, leaving Spot to nose about the woodpile as he pleased.  \"Humph!\" Spot growled. \"Seems to me Johnnie Green might stay here a while and help me. I've been chasing woodchucks and squirrels for him all the morning. And I showed him a few birds, too.\"  Spot never once left the woodpile while Johnnie was eating his dinner. When Johnnie and his father and the hired man came out of the house later old Spot began to yelp. He made frantic efforts to burrow down beneath the pile of firewood, stopping now and then to run up to his young master and bark.  Now that he had had his dinner, Johnnie Green was all ready for any sort of fun.  \"Spot smells some kind of game in the woodpile!\" Johnnie exclaimed.  \"Perhaps he does,\" said his father. \"But I don't see how he's going to get hold of it unless we move the woodpile. And I don't believe we'll quit work to help the old dog catch a chipmunk--or maybe a rat.\"  \"Come on!\" Spot begged Johnnie, as plainly as he could bark. \"Move some of this wood for me! There's something under it that I want to get my teeth on.\"  \"All right! All right!\" Johnnie told him. And to his father Johnnie said, \"Do you care if I throw some of the stove wood over on the other side of the pile?\"  \"If you're going to move any wood--\" Farmer Green replied with a wink at the hired man--\"if you're going to move any wood you might as well move it into the woodshed and pile it up neatly.\"  When he heard that suggestion Johnnie Green looked very glum. For a minute or two he thought he wouldn't bother to help old Spot find what he was looking for. But Spot teased and teased. And Johnnie couldn't help being curious to know what it was that Spot was after.  \"Maybe there's a muskrat here,\" he said to himself. \"If there is, I'll have his skin to pay me for my trouble.\"     V  A DEEP SECRET   Old Spot wouldn't let Johnnie Green alone. He kept jumping against him and whining, begging him to move some of the wood, because there was something very, very interesting beneath it.  Still Johnnie hesitated. He hadn't intended to do any work that afternoon.  \"After all,\" he thought, \"I'll have to help carry in this wood sooner or later. Really, I might as well take some of it into the woodshed now.\"  To Spot's delight he bent over and began gathering an armful of wood.  \"Wow! Wow!\" Spot howled. \"Thank goodness I'm going to get what's under this pile, after all.\"  Johnnie Green carried armful after armful of wood from the yard and piled it in the shed back of the kitchen. All the time old dog Spot was urging him with yelps and barks and whines and moans to move faster. And all the time Johnnie Green was working as spryly as he could.  Whatever it might be that Spot wanted to get under the woodpile in the yard, Johnnie hoped it wouldn't escape through the crevices between the sticks.  \"I don't want to get myself all tired out for nothing,\" Johnnie said to himself. \"I was going fishing this afternoon.\"  While Johnnie hurried back and forth between the woodpile and the shed Spot clawed away at the edge of the pile. He thrust his nose beneath loose sticks and pushed them about. He uttered pitiful sounds.  \"I never saw that dog take on so,\" Farmer Green remarked.  \"And I never saw Johnnie work so hard,\" said the hired man. \"When there's wood to be carried in he's usually a mile away.\"  Farmer Green laughed.  \"He'll quit as soon as Spot gets what he wants,\" he replied. \"It's too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen oftener. Except for driving the cows home, this is the first time I ever knew a boy and a dog to do much besides play, when they're together.\"  Turkey Proudfoot, the huge gobbler, came hurrying around the corner of the barn to see what was going on. He had an idea that he ruled the farmyard.  \"What's all this row about?\" he gobbled at old Spot. \"Have you lost something?\"  \"Yes!\" Spot told him. \"Johnnie Green's helping me to find it. We're moving part of the woodpile.\"  \"What did you lose?\" Turkey Proudfoot demanded.  Old Spot pretended not to hear him. He began barking again at Johnnie Green.  Mr. Catbird, who loved to play jokes on everybody, started mewing from his hiding place under the lilac bushes. He had noticed Spot's antics. And he hoped to fool him into thinking there was a strange cat around the place. For Spot was a famous chaser of all cats--so long as they kept running away from him and didn't turn around and try to scratch him.  To Mr. Catbird's astonishment old Spot paid no heed to his catcalls.  \"This is queer,\" Mr. Catbird muttered. \"Whenever I've mewed before he has always come a-running. There must be something uncommonly interesting under that woodpile.\"     VI  BURIED TREASURE   Henrietta Hen, who was one of the busiest busybodies on the farm, came along and stood and watched old dog Spot while he dug and scratched and howled about the woodpile.  \"What on earth is the matter with you?\" she asked him. \"I don't make half that fuss when I've just laid an egg and really have something to cackle about.\"  \"I've no time to talk with you now,\" Spot told Henrietta Hen. \"Can't you see that Johnnie Green and I are moving the woodpile?\"  \"Why are you doing that?\" Henrietta inquired.  \"There's something beneath it that I want,\" he said hurriedly.  Henrietta Hen gave a sudden start.  \"I wonder if it's a weasel!\" she exclaimed. And since he didn't reply, and she had learned to be mortally afraid of weasels, she ran off squawking, to hide high up in the haymow in the barn.  Johnnie Green hadn't carried away much more of the woodpile when old dog Spot began to dig furiously in the dirt. And in a few seconds' time he unearthed a big bone.  It was a choice bone. He had buried it several days before. And when he came back from the woods and found a woodpile on top of the place where he had hidden it, it was no wonder that he made such a howdy-do.  Johnnie Green looked much"]]]
