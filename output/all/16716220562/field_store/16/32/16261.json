Why, I shall suffer even on your own little estate . . . \"  \"That will do!\" he said curtly.  Father is so ridiculously touchy.  One would think he expects to live for ever.  Presently he spoke again:  \"I wonder what are the conditions of that trust.  They are as important--almost--as the amount of the bequest--whatever it is.  By the way, there seems to be no mention in the will of a residuary legatee. Ernest, my boy, we may have to fight over that.\"  \"How do you make that out, father?\" I asked.  He had been very rude over the matter of the death-duties of his own estate, though it is entailed and I _must_ inherit.  So I determined to let him see that I know a good deal more than he does--of law, at any rate.  \"I fear that when we come to look into it closely that dog won't fight.  In the first place, that may be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which is a part of the Will.  And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the conditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins to work.  What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked at it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation.  But even if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the corpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn pleases.  He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one can say a word.  In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal.\"  \"H'm!\" said father to himself.  \"It is a queer kind of will, I take it, that can override the Court of Chancery.  We shall perhaps have to try it before we are done with this!\"  With that he rose, and we walked home together--without saying another word.  My mother was very inquisitive about the whole thing--women always are. Father and I between us told her all it was necessary for her to know.  I think we were both afraid that, woman-like, she would make trouble for us by saying or doing something injudicious.  Indeed, she manifested such hostility towards Rupert St. Leger that it is quite on the cards that she may try to injure him in some way.  So when father said that he would have to go out shortly again, as he wished to consult his solicitor, I jumped up and said I would go with him, as I, too, should take advice as to how I stood in the matter.  _The Contents of Letter marked_ \"_B_\" _attached as an Integral Part to the Last Will of Roger Melton_.                                                            _June_ 11, 1907.      \"This letter an integral part of my Last Will regards the entire     residue of my estate beyond the specific bequests made in the body of     my Will.  It is to appoint as Residuary Legatee of such Will--in case     he may accept in due form the Conditions herein laid down--my dear     Nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my sister Patience Melton now     deceased by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger also now     deceased.  On his acceptance of the Conditions and the fulfilment of     the first of them the Entire residue of my estate after payments of     all specific Legacies and of all my debts and other obligations is to     become his absolute property to be dealt with or disposed of as he     may desire.  The following are the conditions.      \"1.  He is to accept provisionally by letter addressed to my     Executors a sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand pounds     sterling free of all Duties Taxes or other imposts.  This he will     hold for a period of six months from the date of the Reading of my     Last Will and have user of the accruements thereto calculated at the     rate of ten per centum per annum which amount he shall under no     circumstances be required to replace.  At the end of said six months     he must express in writing directed to the Executors of my Will his     acceptance or refusal of the other conditions herein to follow.  But     if he may so choose he shall be free to declare in writing to the     Executors within one week from the time of the Reading of the Will     his wish to accept or to withdraw altogether from the responsibility     of this Trust.  In case of withdrawal he is to retain absolutely and     for his own use the above-mentioned sum of nine hundred and     ninety-nine thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties Taxes and     imposts whatsoever making with the specific bequest of one thousand     pounds a clear sum of one million pounds sterling free of all     imposts.  And he will from the moment of the delivery of such written     withdrawal cease to have any right or interest whatsoever in the     further disposition of my estate under this instrument.  Should such     written withdrawal be received by my Executors they shall have     possession of such residue of my estate as shall remain after the     payment of the above sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand     pounds sterling and the payment of all Duties Taxes assessments or     Imposts as may be entailed by law by its conveyance to the said     Rupert Sent Leger and these my Executors shall hold the same for the     further disposal of it according to the instructions given in the     letter marked C and which is also an integral part of my Last Will     and Testament.      \"2.  If at or before the expiration of the six months above-mentioned     the said Rupert Sent Leger shall have accepted the further conditions     herein stated, he is to have user of the entire income produced by     such residue of my estate the said income being paid to him Quarterly     on the usual Quarter Days by the aforesaid Executors to wit Major     General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie Bart. and Edward Bingham Trent     to be used by him in accordance with the terms and conditions     hereinafter mentioned.      \"3.  The said Rupert Sent Leger is to reside for a period of at least     six months to begin not later than three months from the reading of     my Will in the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains.     And if he fulfil the Conditions imposed on him and shall thereby     become possessed of the residue of my estate he is to continue to     reside there in part for a period of one year.  He is not to change     his British Nationality except by a formal consent of the Privy     Council of Great Britain.      \"At the end of a year and a half from the Reading of my Will he is to     report in person to my Executors of the expenditure of amounts paid     or due by him in the carrying out of the Trust and if they are     satisfied that same are in general accord with the conditions named     in above-mentioned letter marked C and which is an integral part of     my Will they are to record their approval on such Will which can then     go for final Probate and Taxation.

MEMORANDA MADE BY EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE WILL OF     ROGER MELTON.                                                          _January_ 3, 1907.      The interests and issues of all concerned in the Will and estate of     the late Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange are so vast that in case any     litigation should take place regarding the same, I, as the solicitor,     having the carriage of the testator's wishes, think it well to make     certain memoranda of events, conversations, etc., not covered by     documentary evidence.  I make the first memorandum immediately after     the event, whilst every detail of act and conversation is still fresh     in my mind.  I shall also try to make such comments thereon as may     serve to refresh my memory hereafter, and which in case of my death     may perhaps afford as opinions contemporaneously recorded some     guiding light to other or others who may later on have to continue     and complete the tasks entrusted to me.      I.      CONCERNING THE READING OF THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON.      When, beginning at 11 o'clock a.m. on this the forenoon of Thursday,     the 3rd day of January, 1907, I opened the Will and read it in full,     except the clauses contained in the letters marked \"B\" and \"C\"; there     were present in addition to myself, the following:      1.  Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P, nephew of the testator.      2.  Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, son of the above.      3.  Rupert Sent Leger, nephew of the testator.      4.  Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie, Bart., co-executor     with myself of the Will.      5.  Andrew Rossiter, my clerk, one of the witnesses of the testator's     Will.      6.  Alfred Nugent, stenographer (of Messrs. Castle's office, 21,     Bream's Buildings, W.C.).  When the Will had been read, Mr. E. H. Melton asked the value of the estate left by the testator, which query I did not feel empowered or otherwise able to answer; and a further query, as to why those present were not shown the secret clauses of the Will.  I answered by reading the instructions endorsed on the envelopes of the two letters marked \"B\" and \"C,\" which were sufficiently explanatory.  But, lest any question should hereafter arise as to the fact that the memoranda in letters marked \"B\" and \"C,\" which were to be read as clauses 10 and 11 of the Will, I caused Rupert Sent Leger to open the envelope marked \"B\" in the presence of all in the room.  These all signed a paper which I had already prepared, to the effect that they had seen the envelope opened, and that the memorandum marked \"B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will,\" was contained in the envelope, of which it was to be the sole contents.  Mr. Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P., before signing, carefully examined "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],["title","The Lady of the Shroud (#8)"],["body","a magnifying-glass, for which he had asked, both the envelope and the heading of the memorandum enclosed in the letter. He was about to turn the folded paper which was lying on the table over, by which he might have been able to read the matter of the memorandum had he so desired.  I at once advised him that the memorandum he was to sign dealt only with the heading of the page, and not with the matter.  He looked very angry, but said nothing, and after a second scrutiny signed. I put the memorandum in an envelope, which we all signed across the flap. Before signing, Mr Ernest Halbard Melton took out the paper and verified it.  I then asked him to close it, which he did, and when the sealing-wax was on it he sealed it with his own seal.  Sir Colin A. MacKelpie and I also appended our own seals.  I put the envelope in another, which I sealed with my own seal, and my co-executor and I signed it across the flap and added the date.  I took charge of this.  When the others present had taken their departure, my co-executor and I, together with Mr. Rupert Sent Leger, who had remained at my request, went into my private room.  Here Mr. Rupert Sent Leger read the memorandum marked \"B,\" which is to be read as clause 10 of the Will.  He is evidently a man of considerable nerve, for his face was quite impassive as he read the document, which conveyed to him (subject to the conditions laid down) a fortune which has no equal in amount in Europe, even, so far as I know, amongst the crowned heads.  When he had read it over a second time he stood up and said:  \"I wish I had known my uncle better.  He must have had the heart of a king.  I never heard of such generosity as he has shown me.  Mr. Trent, I see, from the conditions of this memorandum, or codicil, or whatever it is, that I am to declare within a week as to whether I accept the conditions imposed on me.  Now, I want you to tell me this: must I wait a week to declare?\"  In answer, I told him that the testator's intention was manifestly to see that he had full time to consider fully every point before making formal decision and declaration.  But, in answer to the specific question, I could answer that he might make declaration when he would, provided it was _within_, or rather not after, the week named.  I added:  \"But I strongly advise you not to act hurriedly.  So enormous a sum is involved that you may be sure that all possible efforts will be made by someone or other to dispossess you of your inheritance, and it will be well that everything shall be done, not only in perfect order, but with such manifest care and deliberation that there can be no question as to your intention.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" he answered; \"I shall do as you shall kindly advise me in this as in other things.  But I may tell you now--and you, too, my dear Sir Colin--that I not only accept my Uncle Roger's conditions in this, but that when the time comes in the other matters I shall accept every condition that he had in his mind--and that I may know of--in everything.\"  He looked exceedingly in earnest, and it gave me much pleasure to see and hear him.  It was just what a young man should do who had seen so generously treated.  As the time had now come, I gave him the bulky letter addressed to him, marked \"D\" which I had in my safe.  As I fulfilled my obligation in the matter, I said:  \"You need not read the letter here.  You can take it away with you, and read it by yourself at leisure.  It is your own property, without any obligation whatever attached to it.  By the way, perhaps it would be well if you knew.  I have a copy sealed up in an envelope, and endorsed, 'To be opened if occasion should arise,' but not otherwise.  Will you see me to-morrow, or, better still, dine with me alone here to-night?  I should like to have a talk with you, and you may wish to ask me some questions.\" He answered me cordially.  I actually felt touched by the way he said good-bye before he went away.  Sir Colin MacKelpie went with him, as Sent Leger was to drop him at the Reform.  _Letter from Roger Melton to Rupert Sent Leger_, _endorsed_ \"_D. re Rupert Sent Leger_.  _To be given to him by Edward Bingham Trent if and as soon as he has declared_ (_formally or informally_) _his intention of accepting the conditions named in Letter B._, _forming Clause_ 10 _in my Will_.  _R.

My Dear Nephew,      When (if ever) you receive this you will know that (with the     exception of some definite bequests) I have left to you, under     certain conditions, the entire bulk of my fortune--a fortune so great     that by its aid as a help, a man of courage and ability may carve out     for himself a name and place in history.  The specific conditions     contained in Clause 10 of my Will have to be observed, for such I     deem to be of service to your own fortune; but herein I give my     advice, which you are at liberty to follow or not as you will, and my     wishes, which I shall try to explain fully and clearly, so that you     may be in possession of my views in case you should desire to carry     them out, or, at least, to so endeavour that the results I hope for     may be ultimately achieved.  First let me explain--for your     understanding and your guidance--that the power, or perhaps it had     better be called the pressure, behind the accumulation of my fortune     has been ambition.  In obedience to its compulsion, I toiled early     and late until I had so arranged matters that, subject to broad     supervision, my ideas could be carried out by men whom I had selected     and tested, and not found wanting.  This was for years to the     satisfaction, and ultimately to the accumulation by these men of     fortune commensurate in some measure to their own worth and their     importance to my designs.  Thus I had accumulated, whilst still a     young man, a considerable fortune.  This I have for over forty years     used sparingly as regards my personal needs, daringly with regard to     speculative investments.  With the latter I took such very great     care, studying the conditions surrounding them so thoroughly, that     even now my schedule of bad debts or unsuccessful investments is     almost a blank.  Perhaps by such means things flourished with me, and     wealth piled in so fast that at times I could hardly use it to     advantage.  This was all done as the forerunner of ambition, but I     was over fifty years of age when the horizon of ambition itself     opened up to me.  I speak thus freely, my dear Rupert, as when you     read it I shall have passed away, and not ambition nor the fear of     misunderstanding, nor even of scorn can touch me.  My ventures in     commerce and finance covered not only the Far East, but every foot of     the way to it, so that the Mediterranean and all its opening seas     were familiar to me.  In my journeyings up and down the Adriatic I     was always struck by the great beauty and seeming richness--native     richness--of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  At last Chance took me     into that delectable region.  When the \"Balkan Struggle\" of '90 was     on, one of the great Voivodes came to me in secret to arrange a large     loan for national purposes.  It was known in financial circles of     both Europe and Asia that I took an active part in the _haute     politique_ of national treasuries, and the Voivode Vissarion came to     me as to one able and willing to carry out his wishes.  After     confidential pour-parlers, he explained to me that his nation was in     the throes of a great crisis.  As you perhaps know, the gallant     little Nation in the Land of the Blue Mountains has had a strange     history.  For more than a thousand years--ever since its settlement     after the disaster of Rossoro--it had maintained its national     independence under several forms of Government.  At first it had a     King whose successors became so despotic that they were dethroned.     Then it was governed by its Voivodes, with the combining influence of     a Vladika somewhat similar in power and function to the     Prince-Bishops of Montenegro; afterwards by a Prince; or, as at     present, by an irregular elective Council, influenced in a modified     form by the Vladika, who was then supposed to exercise a purely     spiritual function.  Such a Council in a small, poor nation did not     have sufficient funds for armaments, which were not immediately and     imperatively necessary; and therefore the Voivode Vissarion, who had     vast estates in his own possession, and who was the present     representative a family which of old had been leaders in the land,     found it a duty to do on his own account that which the State could     not do.  For security as to the loan which he wished to get, and     which was indeed a vast one, he offered to sell me his whole estate     if I would secure to him a right to repurchase it within a given time     (a time which I may say has some time ago expired).  He made it a     condition that the sale and agreement should remain a strict secret     between us, as a widespread knowledge that his estate had changed     hands would in all probability result in my death and his own at the     hands of the mountaineers, who are beyond everything loyal, and were     jealous to the last degree.  An attack by Turkey was feared, and new     armaments were required; and the patriotic Voivode was sacrificing     his own great fortune for the public good.  What a sacrifice this was     he well knew, for in all discussions regarding a possible change in     the Constitution of the Blue Mountains it was always taken for     granted that if the principles of the Constitution should change to a     more personal rule, his own family should be regarded as the Most"]]]
