INCLUDING A  SYSTEM OF VEGETABLE COOKERY.  BY DR. WM. A. ALCOTT,  AUTHOR OF THE YOUNG MAN'S GUIDE, YOUNG WOMAN'S GUIDE, YOUNG MOTHER, YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER, AND LATE EDITOR OF THE LIBRARY OF HEALTH.  SECOND EDITION, REVISED AND ENLARGED.  NEW YORK: FOWLER AND WELLS, PUBLISHERS, No. 308 BROADWAY 1859.  Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1849, BY FOWLERS & WELLS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.  BANES & PALMER, STEREOTYPERS, 201 William st. corner Frankfort, N. Y.     PREFACE   The following volume embraces the testimony, direct or indirect, of more than a HUNDRED individuals--besides that of societies and communities--on the subject of vegetable diet. Most of this one hundred persons are, or were, persons of considerable distinction in society; and more than FIFTY of them were either medical men, or such as have made physiology, hygiene, anatomy, pathology, medicine, or surgery a leading or favorite study.  As I have written other works besides this--especially the \"Young House-Keeper\"--which treat, more or less, of diet, it may possibly be objected, that I sometimes repeat the same idea. But how is it to be avoided? In writing for various classes of the community, and presenting my views in various connections and aspects, it is almost necessary to do so. Writers on theology, or education, or any other important topic, do the same--probably to a far greater extent, in many instances, than I have yet done. I repeat no idea for the _sake_ of repeating it. Not a word is inserted but what seems to me necessary, in order that I may be intelligible. Moreover, like the preacher of truth on many other subjects, it is not so much my object to produce something new in every paragraph, as to explain, illustrate, and enforce what is already known.  It may also be thought that I make too many books. But, as I do not claim to be so much an originator of _new_ things as an instrument for diffusing the _old_, it will not be expected that I should be twenty years on a volume, like Bishop Butler. I had, however, been collecting my stock of materials for this and other works--published or unpublished--more than twenty-five years. Besides, it might be safely and truly said that the study and reading and writing, in the preparation of this volume, the \"House I Live In,\" and the \"Young House-Keeper,\" have consumed at least three of the best years of my life, at fourteen or fifteen hours a day. Several of my other works, as the \"Young Mother,\" the \"Mother's Medical Guide,\" and the \"Young Wife,\" have also been the fruit of years of toil and investigation and observation, of which those who think only of the labor of merely _writing them out_, know nothing. Even the \"Mother in her Family\"--at least some parts of it--though in general a lighter work, has been the result of much care and labor. The circumstance of publishing several books at the same, or nearly the same time, has little or nothing to do with their preparation.  When I commenced putting together the materials of this little treatise on diet--thirteen years ago--it was my intention simply to show the SAFETY of a vegetable and fruit diet, both for those who are afflicted with many forms of chronic disease, and for the healthy. But I soon became convinced that I ought to go farther, and show its SUPERIORITY over every other. This I have attempted to do--with what success, the reader must and will judge for himself.  I have said, it was not my original intention to prove a vegetable and fruit diet to be any thing more than _safe_. But I wish not to be understood as entertaining, even at that time, any doubts in regard to the superiority of such a diet: the only questions with me were, Whether the public mind was ready to hear and weigh the proofs, and whether this volume was the place in which to present them. Both these questions, however, as I went on, were settled, in the affirmative. I believed--and still believe--that the public mind, in this country, is prepared for the free discussion of all topics--provided they are discussed candidly--which have a manifest bearing on the well-being of man; and I have governed myself accordingly.  An apology may be necessary for retaining, unexplained, a few medical terms. But I did not feel at liberty to change them, in the correspondence of Dr. North, for more popular language; and, having retained them thus far, it did not seem desirable to explain them elsewhere. Nor was I willing to deface the pages of the work with explanatory notes. The fact is, the technical terms alluded to, are, after all, very few in number, and may be generally understood by the connection in which they appear.      THE AUTHOR.     WEST NEWTON Mass.     ADVERTISEMENT  TO THE SECOND EDITION.   The great question in regard to diet, viz., whether any food of the animal kind is absolutely necessary to the most full and perfect development of man's whole nature, being fairly up, both in Europe and America, and there being no practical, matter-of-fact volume on the subject, of moderate size, in the market, numerous friends have been for some time urging me to get up a new and revised edition of a work which, though imperfect, has been useful to many, while it has been for some time out of print. Such an edition I have at length found time to prepare--to which I have added, in various ways, especially in the form of new facts, nearly fifty pages of new and original matter.

Twenty-three years ago, the present season, I was in the first stage of tuberculous consumption, and evidently advancing rapidly to the second. The most judicious physicians were consulted, and their advice at length followed. I commenced the practice of medicine, traveling chiefly on horseback; and, though unable to do but little at first, I soon gained strength enough to perform a moderate business, and to combine with it a little gardening and farming. At the time, or nearly at the time, of commencing the practice of medicine, I laid aside my feather bed, and slept on straw; and in December, of the same year, I abandoned spirits, and most kinds of stimulating food. It was not, however, until nineteen years ago, the present season, that I abandoned all drinks but water, and all flesh, fish, and other highly stimulating and concentrated aliments, and confined myself to a diet of milk, fruits, and vegetables.  In the meantime, the duties of my profession, and the nature of my studies led me to prosecute, more diligently than ever, a subject which I had been studying, more or less, from my very childhood--the laws of Human Health. Among other things, I collected facts on this subject from books which came in my way; so that when I went to Boston, in January, 1832, I had already obtained, from various writers, on materia medica, physiology, disease, and dietetics, quite a large parcel. The results of my reflections on these, and of my own observation and experience, were, in part--but in part only--developed in July, of the same year, in an anonymous pamphlet, entitled, \"Rational View of the Spasmodic Cholera;\" published by Messrs. Clapp & Hull, of Boston.  In the summer of 1833, the Boylston Medical Committee of Harvard University offered a prize of fifty dollars, or a gold medal of that value, to the author of the best dissertation on the following question: \"What diet can be selected which will ensure the greatest health and strength to the laborer in the climate of New England--quality and quantity, and the time and manner of taking it, to be considered?\"  At first, I had thoughts of attempting an essay on the subject; for it seemed to me an important one. Circumstances, however, did not permit me to prosecute the undertaking; though I was excited by the question of the Boylston Medical Committee to renewed efforts to increase my stock of information and of facts.  In 1834, I accidentally learned that Dr. Milo L. North, a distinguished practitioner of medicine in Hartford, Connecticut, was pursuing a course of inquiry not unlike my own, and collecting facts and materials for a similar purpose. In correspondence with Dr. North, a proposition was made to unite our stock of materials; but nothing for the present was actually done. However, I agreed to furnish Dr. North with a statement of my own experience, and such other important facts as came within the range of my own observations; and a statement of my experience was subsequently intrusted to his care, as will be seen in its place, in the body of this work.  In February, 1835, Dr. North, in the prosecution of his efforts, addressed the following circular, or LETTER and QUESTIONS, to the editor of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, which were accordingly inserted in a subsequent number of that work. They were also published in the American Journal of Medical Science, of Philadelphia, and copied into numerous papers, so that they were pretty generally circulated throughout our country.   \"To the Editor of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal.  \"SIR,--Reports not unfrequently reach us of certain individuals who have fallen victims to a prescribed course of regimen. Those persons are said, by gentlemen who are entitled to the fullest confidence, to have pertinaciously followed the course, till they reached a point of reduction from which there was no recovery. If these are facts, they ought to be collected and published. And I beg leave, through your Journal, to request my medical brethren, if they have been called to advise in such cases, that they will have the kindness to answer, briefly, the following interrogatories, by mail, as early as convenient.  \"Should the substance of their replies ever be embodied in a small volume, they will not only receive a copy and the thanks of the author, but will have the pleasure to know they are assisting in the settlement of a question of great interest to the country. If it should appear probable that their patient was laboring under a decline at the commencement of the change of diet, this ought, in candor, to be fully disclosed.  \"It will be perceived, by the tenor of the questions, that they are designed to embrace not only unfortunate results of a change of diet, but such as are favorable. There are, in our community, considerable numbers who have entirely excluded animal food from their diet. It is exceedingly desirable that the results of such experiments, so difficult to be found in this land of plenty, should be ascertained and thrown before the profession and the community. Will physicians, then, have the kindness, if they know of any persons in their vicinity who have excluded animal food from their diet for a year or over, to lend them this number of the Journal, and ask them to forward to Milo L. North, Hartford, Connecticut, as early as convenient, the result of this change of diet on their health and constitution, in accordance with the following inquiries?  \"1. Was your bodily strength either increased or diminished by excluding all animal food from your diet?  \"2. Were the animal sensations, connected with the process of digestion, more--or less agreeable?  \"3. Was the mind clearer; and could it continue a laborious investigation longer than when you subsisted on mixed diet?  \"4. What constitutional infirmities were aggravated or removed?  \"5. Had you fewer colds or other febrile attacks--or the reverse?  \"6. What length of time, the trial?  \"7. Was the change to a vegetable diet, in your case, preceded by the use of an uncommon proportion of animal food, or of high seasoning, or of stimulants?  \"8. Was this change accompanied by a substitution of cold water for tea and coffee, during the experiment?  \"9. Is a vegetable diet more--or less aperient than mixed?  \"10. Do you believe, from your experience, that the health of either laborers or students would be promoted by the exclusion of animal food from their diet?  \"11. Have you selected, from your own observation, any articles in the vegetable kingdom, as particularly healthy, or otherwise?  \"N.B.--Short answers to these inquiries are all that is necessary; and as a copy of the latter is retained by the writer, it will be sufficient to refer to them numerically, without the trouble of transcribing each question.      \"HARTFORD, February 25, 1835.\"  This circular, or letter, drew forth numerous replies from various parts of the United States, and chiefly from medical men. In the meantime, the prize of the Boylston Medical Committee was awarded to Luther V. Bell, M.D., of Derry, New Hampshire, and was published in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, and elsewhere, and read with considerable interest.  In the year 1836, while many were waiting--some with a degree of impatience--to hear from Dr. North, his health so far failed him, that he concluded to relinquish, for the present, his inquiries; and, at his particular request, I consented to have the following card inserted in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal:       \"DR. NORTH, of Hartford, Connecticut, tenders his grateful      acknowledgments to the numerous individuals, who were so kind      as to forward to him a statement of the effects of vegetable      diet on their own persons, in reply to some specific inquiries      inserted in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal of March      11, 1835, and in the Philadelphia Journal of the same year.      Although many months elapsed before the answers were all      received, yet the writer is fully aware that these      communications ought to have been published before this. His      apology is a prolonged state of ill health, which has now      become so serious as to threaten to drive him to a southern      climate for the winter. In this exigency, he has solicited Dr.      W. A. Alcott, of Boston, to receive the papers and give them to      the public as soon as his numerous engagements will permit.      This arrangement will doubtless be fully satisfactory, both to      the writers of the communications and to the public.      \"HARTFORD, November 4, 1836.\"    Various circumstances, beyond my control, united to defer the publication of the contemplated work to the year 1838. It is hoped, however, that nothing was lost by delay. It gave further opportunity for reflection, as well as for observation and experiment; and if the work is of any value at all to the community, it owes much of that value to the fact that what the public may be disposed to"]]]
