Something, it is true, depends upon the string and upon the bowing, but we are here supposing the same string and the same player, our object being to show how the _resonator_, which, in this case, is the body of the violin, intensifies the tone of the string, and affects its quality.  Illustrations exemplifying the same thing might be multiplied to any extent, but the one I have just given will suffice. As with the string, so with the vocal ligaments. Cut a larynx out of a dead body, put it in proper position on the top of a bellows, and force the air through it, and you will produce tone, but faint and poor tone. Now add a resonator to the larynx, and the tone of the vocal ligaments will be intensified, and its quality altered according to the kind of resonator you make use of.  It is clear, therefore, that the human voice does not only depend upon the vibrations of the vocal ligaments, and the corresponding vibrations of the air passing between them, but also upon the resonator as defined on p. 9. According to the natural formation of our resonator, and according to the infinite variety of shapes which every one has it in his power to give to it, our voices will be, always supposing the conditions of the vocal ligaments to be the same, either full, round, sonorous, and _beautiful_, or they will be poor, cutting, muffled, guttural, nasal, and _ugly_.  As we have, or may easily acquire, absolute command over the resonator, or, at least, over the greatest part of it, it is a comfort to know that so very much depends upon it, and I trust my readers will now, with some amount of pleasure, look with me at this part of the vocal apparatus.  The 1st and 2nd divisions of the resonator--namely, the pockets of the larynx and the tube above the pocket ligaments--have been fully described on pp. 52, 53, and no more need be said on the subject here.  The upper part of the throat, called in scientific works the \"Pharynx\" (pl. I, P), is a cavity, the largest part of which may be seen through the arch at the back of the open mouth. Its hinder wall is formed by the spinal column, and it extends upwards as far as the Eustachian tubes (pl. I, E) which communicate with the middle part of the ear. Here it joins--  The =Cavities of the Nose= (pl. I, N), which have for their base the hard and soft palate (pl. I, H and S), and which are divided by a bone partition.  The only part of the =Mouth= which requires a particular description is the soft palate. This is a movable partition by means of which either the mouth or the nose can be completely separated from the throat. If the nose is to be shut off from the throat the soft palate is _raised_, and pressed against the back of the pharynx. If the mouth is to be shut off the soft palate is _lowered_, and rests closely upon the back of the tongue. This partition plays a most important part in vocalization. In the formation of all pure vowel sounds it is _raised_, thereby closing the nasal cavities, and it has been found that the closure is loosest for \"ah\" (as in \"father\") and tightest for \"e\" (as in \"bee\"), the intermediate vowels being \"a\" (as in \"name\"), \"oh\" and \"oo\" (as in \"food\"). This has been clearly shown by Czermak in the following manner. Lying down on his back, he had the nasal cavities filled with tepid water. He then uttered the various vowel sounds, and ascertained from the quantity of water required to force open the closure formed by the soft palate the degree of tightness for each vowel. He afterwards constructed a very ingenious little apparatus, by means of which, in one of his lectures, he demonstrated this fact to his audience. It will be easily understood from the above explanation that, if the closure of the nasal cavities is sufficiently imperfect to allow any considerable amount of air to pass through the nose, the result will be a nasal tone.       I am aware that the very opposite is taught by some. There are      those who maintain that nasal tone arises from the air _not_ being      able to get through the nose. I am even informed that in some parts      of England where nasal tone seems to be a general affliction, it is      the practice of teachers of singing to cause their pupils to bathe      their noses in hot water in order to relax the muscles which are      supposed by their contraction to produce nasal tone. I would,      however, in support of my statement, draw attention to the      following indisputable facts:--(1) It is quite possible to      completely close the nostrils, and yet to produce pure vocal tone.      (2) Persons who are either partly or entirely without the soft      palate can _under no circumstances_ utter a single sound without      the most pronounced nasal quality. It seems to me that these facts      sufficiently speak for themselves; but if any of my readers are not      convinced by them, let them try this experiment: Take a thin mirror      and hold it flat against the upper lip, with the glass upwards. Now      sing a pure vocal tone, and the mirror will remain perfectly      bright. Sing, on the contrary, with nasal quality, and the mirror      will at once be completely dimmed. This shows conclusively that      nasal sound is produced by singing _through_ the nose, and this      cannot be done without lowering the soft palate. Teachers of      singing know well enough that guttural tone is caused by the      obstinate arching up of the tongue, and if they understand their      business they eventually succeed in teaching a pupil labouring      under this disadvantage to get perfect control over his tongue. But      nobody thinks of the soft palate, though that can be brought under      subjection just as well as the tongue. Let singing masters see to      it, and young ladies will no longer be laughed at for having to      put their noses into hot water before charming their friends with      a song.  It now only remains to be added that the interior of the windpipe and of the voicebox, as well as that of the throat, the mouth, and the nose, is lined with a thin mucous membrane of a pinkish colour. This concludes my description of the Vocal Organ as a musical instrument.     DIFFERENCES OF THE VOICEBOX, OR LARYNX, IN CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND MEN.   The voicebox of a newly-born baby is about one-third the size of that of a grown woman. It is therefore rather large in proportion to other parts of the body, with the exception of the head, which comparatively is larger still. The horizontal outline of the shield cartilage is a very gentle curve, and the upper horns are short, in consequence of which the voicebox is close to the tongue. The wedges, according to Merkel, are strongly developed; the vocal ligaments are short and thick, and the pockets deep. Up to the third year the voicebox grows very considerably, but no particular alterations take place from that time to the period of puberty, which generally occurs at the age of 14 or 15, rather earlier in girls than in boys. This period of change lasts from six to twelve months, or sometimes even two or three years. During this time the vocal organs undergo a marked change. In boys, the angle at which the two plates of the shield meet becomes more and more acute, and the length of the vocal ligaments increases only in the proportion of five to ten. In girls, on the other hand, the horizontal outline of the shield does not lose its evenness, and the length of the vocal ligaments increases only in the proportion of five to seven. The cartilages would seem, especially in boys, to grow more rapidly than the muscles, so that the slowly-growing muscles do not, at first, control the newly-developed cartilages. This accounts for the unmanageable state of the voice at this period. The changes which take place in the female voicebox are very imperceptible, so that they do not materially affect the character of the voice. In the male voicebox, on the contrary, the alterations are very marked, and the result is that the high voice of the boy is changed into the tenor or the bass of the man. While, therefore, before the period of puberty the voicebox is materially the same in both sexes, there are, afterwards, considerable differences noticeable, not only with regard to size, but also with regard to shape. This seems, indeed, sufficiently obvious, and any one can see it by simply comparing the outside of the throat of a man with that of a woman.       Nevertheless we are told by Mr. Lunn[L] that \"Anatomy teaches us      that there is no difference between the male and female larynx save      in size;\" and by Dr. Garrett (on page 13 of the book quoted before)      that \"The male larynx does not differ anatomically in the least      from that of the female, except in size.\"       My readers may judge for themselves whether these statements are      borne out by facts or not.  It must further be observed that the whole upper part of the shield in the female voicebox is less developed than in the male. The upper horns are short, so that the voicebox is more closely attached to the tongue-bone, and its position in the throat is altogether higher in woman than in man. To show more clearly still the difference in the proportions of the male and the female voicebox, I give below some average measurements (taken from Luschka's great work on the Larynx) which I have, for the convenience of English readers, reduced, as nearly as possible, from centimetres and millimetres to inches.

Raymond Hall, Chairman, Henry S. Fitch, Robert W. Wilson   PRINTED IN THE STATE PRINTING PLANT TOPEKA, KANSAS  1958  27-3033     A New Bog Lemming (Genus Synaptomys)  From Nebraska   BY  J. KNOX JONES, JR.   In the autumn of 1952, I obtained a southern bog lemming, _Synaptomys cooperi_, at Rock Creek State Fish Hatchery, Dundy County, in extreme southwestern Nebraska. This locality of record is the westernmost for the species in North America. Subsequently, I reported this specimen in the literature (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 7:486, 1954), provisionally assigning it to _Synaptomys cooperi gossii_, the subspecies occurring in eastern Nebraska. In late November of 1956, J. R. Alcorn collected three additional bog lemmings at the Rock Creek Hatchery.  These specimens from Dundy County represent a relict population that differs in several characteristics from _S. c. gossii_, and that differs also from all other subspecies of the species. This relict population is, therefore, here given subspecific recognition.   #Synaptomys cooperi relictus#, new subspecies  _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull, University of Kansas Museum of Natural History no. 51617, from Rock Creek State Fish Hatchery, 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W Parks, Dundy County, Nebraska; obtained November 1, 1952, by J. Knox Jones, Jr., original no. 995.  _Distribution._--Known only from the type locality.  _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species, both externally and cranially; dorsal pelage dark; nasals broadly flared anteriorly (especially broad in relation to nasal length); auditory bullae small; molariform tooth-rows and incisive foramina long.  _Measurements (in millimeters)._--External measurements of the type specimen, followed by those of another adult female (KU 72603), are: Total length, 141, 145; length of tail-vertebrae, 24, 21; length of hind foot, 20, 20; length of ear from notch, 11, 12. The type specimen weighed 46.3 grams. Cranial measurements were taken in the manner described by Wetzel (Jour. Mamm., 36:2-3, 1955) except that he did not record the occipitonasal length. These cranial measurements of the type and KU 72603 are: Occipitonasal length, 30.2, 29.8; condylobasilar length, 27.2, 27.1; zygomatic breadth, 18.1, 17.9; lambdoidal breadth, 14.2, 13.8; length of nasals, 8.2, 8.3; breadth of nasals, 4.2, 4.0; length of rostrum, 6.6, 6.6; breadth of rostrum, 6.1, 5.9; breadth of upper incisors, 4.6, 4.2; length of maxillary tooth-row, 8.5, 8.4; length of incisive foramen, 5.8, 5.5; interorbital breadth, 3.1, 3.5.  _Comparisons._--From _Synaptomys cooperi gossii_ (specimens from eastern Nebraska and eastern Kansas, including one topotype), _S. c. relictus_ differs in: Dorsal coloration, in comparable pelages, darker, venter lacking buffy tinge; skull averaging larger in all cranial dimensions (except rostral length, which is approximately the same), especially breadth of upper incisors and length of molariform tooth-rows; nasals broader anteriorly; auditory bullae nearly equal in size, thus relatively smaller. From _Synaptomys cooperi paludis_ (holotype and paratypes) of Meade County, Kansas, _S. c. relictus_ differs in: Skull averaging smaller in all cranial measurements except rostral length and breadth of upper incisors, which are approximately the same, and breadth of nasals, length of incisive foramina and length of molariform tooth-rows, which measure more; nasals relatively (48 per cent of length of nasals) as well as actually broader anteriorly; anterior border of zygomatic plate more concave; auditory bullae smaller; infraorbital foramina larger when viewed anterolaterally. _S. c. relictus_ closely resembles _S. c. paludis_ in color and external proportions.  _Remarks._--The total population of _Synaptomys cooperi relictus_ may be small because the only suitable habitat known to me for these mice is the dense, grassy area, approximately 100 yards wide and one mile long, around some of the rearing ponds and along the creek at Rock Creek Hatchery. It has been taken there in association with _Cryptotis parva parva_, _Blarina brevicauda carolinensis_, _Reithrodontomys megalotis dychei_, _Peromyscus maniculatus nebrascensis_, _Microtus ochrogaster haydenii_, and another relic, _Microtus pennsylvanicus finitis_. All specimens of the newly named bog lemming are from the border zone between the wet-substrate habitat of _M. p. finitis_ and the drier habitat occupied by _M. o. haydenii_. Approximately 3000 trap nights produced the four known specimens.  _S. c. relictus_, like _S. c. paludis_, represents a relict population of the more southwesterly distribution of the subgenus _Synaptomys_ during Wisconsin and post-Wisconsin times. Additional relict populations likely will be found in the eastern Great Plains.  The new subspecies is intermediate in some features between _paludis_ and _gossii_. The type locality is separated from that of _paludis_ (14 mi. SW Meade, Meade County, Kansas) by a distance of approximately 220 miles over habitats largely unsuitable for bog lemmings. The nearest locality of record for S. c. _gossii_ to the east of the type locality of _relictus_ is at Hunter, Mitchell County, Kansas (see Cockrum, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 7:196, 1952), approximately 200 miles distant. The locality of record of _gossii_ in Nebraska nearest to the type locality of _relictus_ is even farther eastward--1 mi. N Pleasant Dale, Seward County (KU 50188).  _Specimens examined._--Four, from the type locality (KU 51617, 72601-03).  _Transmitted March 11, 1958._"]]]
