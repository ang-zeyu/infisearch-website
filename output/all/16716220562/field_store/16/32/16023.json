Velladon's supposed to deliver the Hlats' attendants to Yaco, so I let them have Kinmarten.\" He paused. \"They asked for the Hlat-talker, too.\"  Quillan grunted. \"Did you give them that?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well,\" Quillan said after a moment, \"that doesn't necessarily mean that we're in for trouble with the Star group. But it does mean, I think, that we'd better stay ready for it!\" He stood up. \"I'll get back down there and go on with the motions of getting the hunt for the Hlat organized. Velladon would sooner see the thing get caught, too, of course, so he shouldn't try to interfere with that. If I spot anything that looks suspicious, I'll get the word to you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I never,\" said Orca, unconsciously echoing Baldy Perk, \"saw anything like it!\" The commodore's chunky little gunman was ashen-faced. The circle of Star men standing around him hardly looked happier. Most of them were staring down at the empty lower section of a suit of space armor which appeared to have been separated with a neat diagonal slice from its upper part.  \"Let's get it straight,\" Ryter said, a little unsteadily. \"You say this half of the suit was lying against the wall like _that_?\"  \"Not exactly,\" Quillan told him. \"When we got up to the fifth level, the suit was stuck against the wall--like that--about eight feet above the floor. That was in the big room where the cubicles are. When Kinmarten and Orca and I finally got the suit worked away from the wall, I expected frankly that we'd find half the body of the guard still inside. But he'd vanished.\"  Ryter cleared his throat. \"Apparently,\" he said, \"the creature drew the upper section of the suit into the wall by whatever means it uses, then stopped applying the transforming process to the metal, and simply moved on with the upper part of the suit and the man.\"  Quillan nodded. \"That's what it looks like.\"  \"But he had _two grenades_!\" Orca burst out. \"He had sprayguns! How could it get him that way?\"  \"Brother,\" Quillan said, \"grenades won't help you much if you don't spot what's moving up behind you!\"  Orca glared speechlessly at him. Ryter said, \"All right! We've lost another man. We're not going to lose any more. We'll station no more guards on the fifth level. Now, get everyone who isn't on essential guard duty to the main room, and split 'em up into life-detector units. Five men to each detail, one to handle the detector, four to stay with him, guns out. If the thing comes back to this level, we want to have it spotted the instant it arrives. Orca, you stay here--and keep _your_ gun out!\"  The men filed out hurriedly. Ryter turned to Quillan. \"Were you able to get the cubicle baited?\"  Quillan nodded. \"Kinmarten figured out how the thing should be set for the purpose. If the Hlat goes in after the sea beef, it's trapped. Of course, if the hunting it's been doing was for food, it mightn't be interested in the beef.\"  \"We don't know,\" Ryter said, \"that the hunting it's been doing was for food.\"  \"No. Did you manage to get the control device from Cooms?\"  Ryter shook his head. \"He's refused to hand it over.\"  \"If you tried to take it from him,\" Quillan said, \"you might have a showdown on your hands.\"  \"And if this keeps on,\" Ryter said, \"I may prefer a showdown! Another few rounds of trouble with the Hlat, and the entire operation could blow up in our faces! The men aren't used to that kind of thing. It's shaken them up. If we've got to take care of the Brotherhood, I'd rather do it while I still have an organized group. Where did you leave Kinmarten, by the way?\"  \"He's back in the little room with his two guards,\" Quillan said.  \"Well, he should be all right there. We can't spare--\" Ryter's body jerked violently. \"_What's that?_\"  There had been a single thudding crash somewhere in the level. Then shouts and cursing.  \"Main hall!\" Quillan said. \"Come on!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The main hall was a jumble of excitedly jabbering Star men when they arrived there. Guns waved about, and the various groups were showing a marked tendency to stand with their backs toward one another and their faces toward the walls.  Ryter's voice rose in a shout that momentarily shut off the hubbub. \"_What's going on here?_\"  Men turned, hands pointed, voices babbled again. Someone nearby said sharply and distinctly, \"... Saw it drop right out of the ceiling!\" Farther down the hall, another group shifted aside enough to disclose it had been clustered about something which looked a little like the empty shell of a gigantic black beetle.  The missing section of the suit of space armor had been returned. But not its occupant.  Quillan moved back a step, turned, went back down the passage from which they had emerged, pulling the Miam Devil from its holster. Behind him the commotion continued; Ryter was shouting something about getting the life-detector units over there. Quillan went left down the first intersecting corridor, right again on the following one, keeping the gun slightly raised before him. Around the next corner, he saw the man on guard over the portal connecting the building levels facing him, gun pointed.  \"What happened?\" the guard asked shakily.  Quillan shook his head, coming up. \"That thing got another one!\"  The guard breathed, \"By God!\" and lowered his gun a little. Quillan raised his a little, the Miam Devil grunted, and the guard sighed and went down. Quillan went past him along the hall, stopped two doors beyond the portal and rapped on the locked door.  \"Quillan here! Open up!\"  The door opened a crack, and one of Kinmarten's guards looked out questioningly. Quillan shot him through the head, slammed on into the room across the collapsing body, saw the second guard wheeling toward him, shot again, and slid the gun back into the holster. Kinmarten, standing beside a table six feet away, right hand gripping a heavy marble ashtray, was staring at him in white-faced shock.  \"Take it easy, chum!\" Quillan said, turning toward him. \"I--\"  He ducked hurriedly as the ashtray came whirling through the air toward his head. An instant later, a large fist smacked the side of Kinmarten's jaw. The rest warden settled limply to the floor.  \"Sorry to do that, pal,\" Quillan muttered, stooping over him. \"Things are rough all over right now.\" He hauled Kinmarten upright, bent, and had the unconscious young man across his shoulder. The hall was still empty except for the body of the portal guard. Quillan laid Kinmarten on the carpet before the portal, hauled the guard off into the room, and pulled the door to the room shut behind him as he came out. Picking up Kinmarten, he stepped into the portal with him and jabbed the fifth level button. A moment later, he moved out into the small dim entry hall on the fifth level, the gun in his right hand again.  He stood there silently for some seconds, looking about him listening. The baited cubicle yawned widely at him from the center of the big room. Nothing seemed to be stirring. Kinmarten went back to the floor. Quillan moved over to the panel which concealed the other portal's mechanisms.  He had the outportal unsealed in considerably less than a minute this time, and slapped the panel gently back in place. He turned back to Kinmarten and started to bend down for him, then straightened quietly again, turning his head.  Had there been a flicker of shadowy motion just then at the edge of his vision, behind the big black cube of the Hlat's food locker? Quillan remained perfectly still, the Miam Devil ready and every sense straining for an indication that the thing was there--or approaching stealthily now, gliding behind the surfaces of floor or ceiling or walls like an underwater swimmer.  But half a minute passed and nothing else happened. He went down on one knee beside Kinmarten, the gun still in his right hand. With his left, he carefully wrestled the rest warden back up across his shoulder, came upright, moved three steps to the side, and disappeared in the outportal.         *       *       *       *       *  Reetal Destone unlocked the entry door to her suite and stepped hurriedly inside, letting the door slide shut behind her. She crossed the room to the ComWeb stand and switched on the playback. There was the succession of tinkling tones which indicated nothing had been recorded.  She shut the instrument off again, passing her tongue lightly over her lips. No further messages from Heraga....  And none from Quillan.  She shook her head, feeling a surge of sharp anxiety, glanced at her watch and told herself that, after all, less than two hours had passed since Quillan had gone into the Executive Block. Heraga reported there had been no indications of disturbance or excitement when he passed through the big entrance hall on his way out. So Quillan, at any rate, had succeeded in bluffing his way into the upper levels.  It remained a desperate play, at best.  Reetal went down the short passage to her bedroom. As she came into the room, her arms were caught from the side at the elbows, pulled suddenly and painfully together behind her. She stood still, frozen with shock.  \"In a hurry, sweetheart?\" Fluel's flat voice said.  Reetal managed a breathless giggle. \"Duke! You startled me! How did you get in?\"  She felt one hand move up her arm to her shoulder. Then she was swung about deftly and irresistibly, held pinned back against the wall, still unable to move her arms.  He looked at her a moment, asked, \"Where are you hiding it this time?\"  \"Hiding what, Duke?\"  \"I've been told sweet little Reetal always carries a sweet little gun around with her in some shape or form or other.\"  Reetal shook her head, her eyes widening. \"Duke, what's the matter? I....\"  He let go of her suddenly, and his slap exploded against the side of her face. Reetal cried out,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30493"],["title","Lion Loose (#8)"],["body"," her head between her hands. Immediately he had her wrists again, and her fingers were jerked away from the jeweled ornament in her hair.  \"So that's where it is!\" Fluel said. \"Thought it might be. Don't get funny again now, sweetheart. Just stay quiet.\"  She stayed quiet, wincing a little as he plucked the glittering little device out of her hair. He turned it around in his fingers, examining it, smiled and slid it into an inside pocket, and took her arm again. \"Let's go to the front room, Reetal,\" he said almost pleasantly. \"We've got a few things to do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A minute later, she was seated sideways on a lounger, her wrists fastened right and left to its armrests. The Duke placed a pocket recorder on the floor beside her. \"This is a crowded evening, sweetheart,\" he remarked, \"which is lucky for you in a way. We'll have to rush things along a little. I'll snap the recorder on in a minute so you can answer questions--No, keep quiet. Just listen very closely now, so you'll know what the right answers are. If you get rattled and gum things up, the Duke's going to get annoyed with you.\"  He sat down a few feet away from her, hitched his shoulders to straighten out the silver jacket, and lit a cigarette. \"A little while after Bad News Quillan turned up just now,\" he went on, \"a few things occurred to me. One of them was that a couple of years ago you and he were operating around Beldon at about the same time. I thought, well, maybe you knew each other; maybe not. And then--\"  \"Duke,\" Reetal said uncertainly, \"just what are you talking about? I don't know--\"  \"Shut up.\" He reached over, tapped her knee lightly with his fingertips. \"Of course, if you want to get slapped around, all right. Otherwise, don't interrupt again. Like I said, you're in luck; I don't have much time to spend here. You're getting off very easy. Now just listen.  \"Bad News knew a lot about our operation and had a story to explain that. If the story was straight, we couldn't touch him. But I was wondering about the two of you happening to be here on the Star again at the same time. A team maybe, eh? But he didn't mention you as being in on the deal. So what was the idea?  \"And then, sweetheart, I remembered something else--and that tied it in. Know that little jolt people sometimes get when they're dropping off to sleep? Of course. Know another time they sometimes get it? When they're snapping back out of a Moment of Truth, eh? I remembered suddenly I'd felt a little jump like that while we were talking to-day. Might have been a reflex of some kind. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time you could be pulling a lousy stunt like that on old Duke. Why take a chance on getting your neck broken?  \"But, sweetheart, that's the tie-in! Quillan hasn't told it straight. He's got no backing. He's on his own. There's no gang outside somewhere that knows all about our little deal. He got his information right here, from you. And you got it from dumb old Duke, eh?\"  \"Duke,\" Reetal said quite calmly, \"can I ask just one question?\"  He stared bleakly at her a moment, then grinned. \"It's my night to be big-hearted, I guess. Go ahead.\"  \"I'm not trying to argue. But it simply doesn't make sense. If I learned about this operation you're speaking of from you, what reason could I have to feed you Truth in the first place? There'd be almost a fifty-fifty chance that you'd spot it immediately. Why should I take such a risk? Don't you see?\"  Fluel shrugged, dropped his cigarette and ground it carefully into the carpet with the tip of his shoe.  \"You'll start answering those questions yourself almost immediately, sweetheart! Let's not worry about that now. Let me finish. Something happened to Movaine couple of hours ago. Nobody's fault. And something else happened to Marras Cooms just now. That puts me in charge of the operation here. Nice, isn't it? When we found Cooms lying in the hall with a hole through his stupid head, I told Baldy Perk it looked like Bad News had thrown in with the Star boys and done it. Know Baldy? He's Cooms' personal gun. Not what you'd call bright, and he's mighty hot now about Cooms. I left him in charge on our level, with orders to get Quillan the next time he shows up there. Well and good. The boys know Bad News' rep too well to try asking him questions. They won't take chances with him. They'll just gun him down together the instant they see him.\"  He paused to scuff his shoe over the mark the cigarette had left on the carpet, went on, \"But there's Nome Lancion now. He kind of liked Cooms, and he might get suspicious. When there's a sudden vacancy in the organization like that. Nome takes a good look first at the man next in line. He likes to be sure the facts are as stated.  \"So now you know the kind of answers from you I want to hear go down on the recorder, sweetheart. And be sure they sound right. I don't want to waste time on replays. You and Quillan were here on the Star. You got some idea of what was happening, realized you were due to be vaporized along with the rest of them after we left. There was no way out of the jam for you unless you could keep the operation from being carried out. You don't, by the way, mention getting any of that information from me. I don't want Lancion to think I'm beginning to get dopey. You and Quillan just cooked up this story, and he managed to get into the Executive Block. The idea being to knock off as many of the leaders as he could, and mess things up.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Fluel picked up the recorder, stood up, and placed it on the chair. \"That's all you have to remember. You're a smart girl; you can fill in the details any way you like. Now let's get started--\"  She stared at him silently for an instant, a muscle beginning to twitch in her cheek. \"If I do that,\" she said, \"if I give you a story Nome will like, what happens next?\"  Fluel shrugged. \"Just what you're thinking happens next. You're a dead little girl right now, Reetal. Might as well get used to the idea. You'd be dead anyhow four, five hours from now, so that shouldn't make too much difference. What makes a lot of difference is just how unpleasant the thing can get.\"  She drew a long breath. \"Duke, I--\"  \"You're stalling, sweetheart.\"  \"Duke, give me a break. I really didn't know a thing about this. I--\"  He looked down at her for a moment. \"I gave you a break,\" he said. \"You've wasted it. Now we'll try it the other way. If we work a few squeals into the recording, that'll make it more convincing to Lancion. He'll figure little Reetal's the type who wouldn't spill a thing like that without a little pressure.\" He checked himself, grinned. \"And that reminds me. When you're talking for the record, use your own voice.\"  \"My own voice?\" she half whispered.  \"Nome will remember what you sound like--and I've heard that voice imitations are part of your stock in trade. You might think it was cute if Nome got to wondering after you were dead whether that really had been you talking. Don't try it, sweetheart.\"  He brought a glove out of his jacket pocket, slipped it over his left hand, flexing his fingers to work it into position. Reetal's eyes fastened on the rounded metal tips capping thumb, forefinger and middle finger of the glove. Her face went gray.  \"Duke,\" she said, \"No--\"  \"Shut up.\" He brought out a strip of transparent plastic, moved over to her. The gloved hand went into her hair, gripped it, turned her face up. He laid the plastic gag lengthwise over her mouth, pressed it down and released it. Reetal closed her eyes.  \"That'll keep it shut,\" he said. \"Now--\" His right hand clamped about the back of her neck, forcing her head down and forward almost to her knees. The gloved left hand brushed her hair forwards, then its middle finger touched the skin at a point just above her shoulder blades.  \"Right there,\" Fluel said. The finger stiffened, drove down.  Reetal jerked violently, twisted, squirmed sideways, wrists straining against the grip of the armrests. Her breath burst out of her nostrils, followed by squeezed, whining noises. The metal-capped finger continued to grind savagely against the nerve center it had found.  \"Thirty,\" Fluel said finally. He drew his hand back, pulled her upright again, peeled the gag away from her lips. \"Only thirty seconds, sweetheart. Think you'd sooner play along now?\"  Reetal's head nodded.  \"Fine. Give you a minute to steady up. This doesn't really waste much time, you see--\" He took up the recorder, sat down on the chair again, watching her. She was breathing raggedly and shallowly, eyes wide and incredulous. She didn't look at him.  The Duke lit another cigarette.  \"Incidentally,\" he observed, \"if you were stalling because you hoped old Bad News might show up, forget it. If the boys haven't gunned him down by now, he's tied up on a job the commodore gave him to do. He'll be busy another hour or two on that. He--\"  He checked himself. A central section of the wall paneling across the room from him had just dilated open. Old Bad News stood in the concealed suite portal, Rest Warden Kinmarten slung across his shoulder.  Both men moved instantly. Fluel's long legs bounced him sideways out of the chair, right hand darting under his coat, coming out with a gun. Quillan turned to the left to get Kinmarten out of the way. The big Miam Devil seemed to jump into his hand. Both guns spoke together.  Fluel's gun thudded to the carpet. The Duke said, \"Ah-aa-ah!\" in a surprised voice, rolled up his eyes, and followed the gun down.  Quillan said, stunned, \"He was fast! I felt that one parting my hair.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He became very solicitous then--after first ascertaining that Fluel had left the Executive Block unaccompanied, on personal business. He located a pain killer spray in Reetal's bedroom and applied it to the bruised point below the back of her neck. She was just beginning to relax gratefully, as the warm "]]]
