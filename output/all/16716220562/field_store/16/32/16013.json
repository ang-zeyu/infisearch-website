What must I do?\"  \"Go on now, since there is no help for it,\" said Osmond.  \"Greet the king as becomes you, bend the knee, and pay him homage.\"  Richard repeated over to himself the form of homage that he might be perfect in it, and walked on into the court; Alberic, Osmond, and the rest falling back as he entered.  The court was crowded with horses and men, and it was only by calling out loudly, \"The Duke, the Duke,\" that Osmond could get space enough made for them to pass.  In a few moments Richard had mounted the steps and stood in the great hall.  In the chair of state, at the upper end of the room, sat a small spare man, of about eight or nine-and-twenty, pale, and of a light complexion, with a rich dress of blue and gold.  Sir Eric and several other persons stood respectfully round him, and he was conversing with the Archbishop, who, as well as Sir Eric, cast several anxious glances at the little Duke as he advanced up the hall.  He came up to the King, put his knee to the ground, and was just beginning, \"Louis, King of France, I--\" when he found himself suddenly lifted from the ground in the King's arms, and kissed on both cheeks.  Then setting him on his knee, the King exclaimed, \"And is this the son of my brave and noble friend, Duke William?  Ah!  I should have known it from his likeness.  Let me embrace you again, dear child, for your father's sake.\"  Richard was rather overwhelmed, but he thought the King very kind, especially when Louis began to admire his height and free-spirited bearing, and to lament that his own sons, Lothaire and Carloman, were so much smaller and more backward.  He caressed Richard again and again, praised every word he said--Fru Astrida was nothing to him; and Richard began to say to himself how strange and unkind it was of Bernard de Harcourt to like to find fault with him, when, on the contrary, he deserved all this praise from the King himself.                [Picture: Louis of France and the Little Duke]     CHAPTER V   Duke Richard of Normandy slept in the room which had been his father's; Alberic de Montemar, as his page, slept at his feet, and Osmond de Centeville had a bed on the floor, across the door, where he lay with his sword close at hand, as his young Lord's guard and protector.  All had been asleep for some little time, when Osmond was startled by a slight movement of the door, which could not be pushed open without awakening him.  In an instant he had grasped his sword, while he pressed his shoulder to the door to keep it closed; but it was his father's voice that answered him with a few whispered words in the Norse tongue, \"It is I, open.\"  He made way instantly, and old Sir Eric entered, treading cautiously with bare feet, and sat down on the bed motioning him to do the same, so that they might be able to speak lower.  \"Right, Osmond,\" he said.  \"It is well to be on the alert, for peril enough is around him--The Frank means mischief!  I know from a sure hand that Arnulf of Flanders was in council with him just before he came hither, with his false tongue, wiling and coaxing the poor child!\"  \"Ungrateful traitor!\" murmured Osmond.  \"Do you guess his purpose?\"  \"Yes, surely, to carry the boy off with him, and so he trusts doubtless to cut off all the race of Rollo!  I know his purpose is to bear off the Duke, as a ward of the Crown forsooth.  Did you not hear him luring the child with his promises of friendship with the Princes?  I could not understand all his French words, but I saw it plain enough.\"  \"You will never allow it?\"  \"If he does, it must be across our dead bodies; but taken as we are by surprise, our resistance will little avail.  The Castle is full of French, the hall and court swarm with them.  Even if we could draw our Normans together, we should not be more than a dozen men, and what could we do but die?  That we are ready for, if it may not be otherwise, rather than let our charge be thus borne off without a pledge for his safety, and without the knowledge of the states.\"  \"The king could not have come at a worse time,\" said Osmond.  \"No, just when Bernard the Dane is absent.  If he only knew what has befallen, he could raise the country, and come to the rescue.\"  \"Could we not send some one to bear the tidings to-night?\"  \"I know not,\" said Sir Eric, musingly.  \"The French have taken the keeping of the doors; indeed they are so thick through the Castle that I can hardly reach one of our men, nor could I spare one hand that may avail to guard the boy to-morrow.\"  \"Sir Eric;\" a bare little foot was heard on the floor, and Alberic de Montemar stood before him.  \"I did not mean to listen, but I could not help hearing you.  I cannot fight for the Duke yet, but I could carry a message.\"  \"How would that be?\" said Osmond, eagerly.  \"Once out of the Castle, and in Rouen, he could easily find means of sending to the Count.  He might go either to the Convent of St. Ouen, or, which would be better, to the trusty armourer, Thibault, who would soon find man and horse to send after the Count.\"  \"Ha! let me see,\" said Sir Eric.  \"It might be.  But how is he to get out?\"  \"I know a way,\" said Alberic.  \"I scrambled down that wide buttress by the east wall last week, when our ball was caught in a branch of the ivy, and the drawbridge is down.\"  \"If Bernard knew, it would be off my mind, at least!\" said Sir Eric. \"Well, my young Frenchman, you may do good service.\"  \"Osmond,\" whispered Alberic, as he began hastily to dress himself, \"only ask one thing of Sir Eric--never to call me young Frenchman again!\"  Sir Eric smiled, saying, \"Prove yourself Norman, my boy.\"  \"Then,\" added Osmond, \"if it were possible to get the Duke himself out of the castle to-morrow morning.  If I could take him forth by the postern, and once bring him into the town, he would be safe.  It would be only to raise the burghers, or else to take refuge in the Church of Our Lady till the Count came up, and then Louis would find his prey out of his hands when he awoke and sought him.\"  \"That might be,\" replied Sir Eric; \"but I doubt your success.  The French are too eager to hold him fast, to let him slip out of their hands.  You will find every door guarded.\"  \"Yes, but all the French have not seen the Duke, and the sight of a squire and a little page going forth, will scarcely excite their suspicion.\"  \"Ay, if the Duke would bear himself like a little page; but that you need not hope for.  Besides, he is so taken with this King's flatteries, that I doubt whether he would consent to leave him for the sake of Count Bernard.  Poor child, he is like to be soon taught to know his true friends.\"  \"I am ready,\" said Alberic, coming forward.  The Baron de Centeville repeated his instructions, and then undertook to guard the door, while his son saw Alberic set off on his expedition. Osmond went with him softly down the stairs, then avoiding the hall, which was filled with French, they crept silently to a narrow window, guarded by iron bars, placed at such short intervals apart that only so small and slim a form as Alberic's could have squeezed out between them. The distance to the ground was not much more than twice his own height, and the wall was so covered with ivy, that it was not a very dangerous feat for an active boy, so that Alberic was soon safe on the ground, then looking up to wave his cap, he ran on along the side of the moat, and was soon lost to Osmond's sight in the darkness.  Osmond returned to the Duke's chamber, and relieved his father's guard, while Richard slept soundly on, little guessing at the plots of his enemies, or at the schemes of his faithful subjects for his protection.  Osmond thought this all the better, for he had small trust in Richard's patience and self-command, and thought there was much more chance of getting him unnoticed out of the Castle, if he did not know how much depended on it, and how dangerous his situation was.  When Richard awoke, he was much surprised at missing Alberic, but Osmond said he was gone into the town to Thibault the armourer, and this was a message on which he was so likely to be employed that Richard's suspicion was not excited.  All the time he was dressing he talked about the King, and everything he meant to show him that day; then, when he was ready, the first thing was as usual to go to attend morning mass.  \"Not by that way, to-day, my Lord,\" said Osmond, as Richard was about to enter the great hall.  \"It is crowded with the French who have been sleeping there all night; come to the postern.\"  Osmond turned, as he spoke, along the passage, walking fast, and not sorry that Richard was lingering a little, as it was safer for him to be first.  The postern was, as he expected, guarded by two tall steel-cased figures, who immediately held their lances across the door-way, saying, \"None passes without warrant.\"  \"You will surely let us of the Castle attend to our daily business,\" said Osmond.  \"You will hardly break your fast this morning if you stop all communication with the town.\"  \"You must bring warrant,\" repeated one of the men-at-arms.  Osmond was beginning to say that he was the son of the Seneschal of the Castle, when Richard came hastily up.  \"What?  Do these men want to stop us?\" he exclaimed in the imperious manner he had begun to take up since his accession.  \"Let us go on, sirs.\"  The men-at-arms looked at each other, and guarded the door more closely. Osmond saw it was hopeless, and only wanted to draw his young charge back without being recognised, but Richard exclaimed loudly, \"What means this?\"  \"The King has given orders that none should pass without warrant,\" was Osmond's answer.  \"We must wait.\"  \"I will pass!\" said Richard, impatient at opposition, to which he was little accustomed.  \"What mean you, Osmond?  This is my Castle, and no one has a right to stop me.  Do you hear, grooms? let me go.  I am"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3048"],["title","The Little Duke: Richard the Fearless (#8)"],["body","Duke!\"  The sentinels bowed, but all they said was, \"Our orders are express.\"  \"I tell you I am Duke of Normandy, and I will go where I please in my own city!\" exclaimed Richard, passionately pressing against the crossed staves of the weapons, to force his way between them, but he was caught and held fast in the powerful gauntlet of one of the men-at-arms.  \"Let me go, villain!\" cried he, struggling with all his might.  \"Osmond, Osmond, help!\"  Even as he spoke Osmond had disengaged him from the grasp of the Frenchman, and putting his hand on his arm, said, \"Nay, my Lord, it is not for you to strive with such as these.\"  \"I will strive!\" cried the boy.  \"I will not have my way barred in my own Castle.  I will tell the King how these rogues of his use me.  I will have them in the dungeon.  Sir Eric! where is Sir Eric?\"  Away he rushed to the stairs, Osmond hurrying after him, lest he should throw himself into some fresh danger, or by his loud calls attract the French, who might then easily make him prisoner.  However, on the very first step of the stairs stood Sir Eric, who was too anxious for the success of the attempt to escape, to be very far off.  Richard, too angry to heed where he was going, dashed up against him without seeing him, and as the old Baron took hold of him, began, \"Sir Eric, Sir Eric, those French are villains! they will not let me pass--\"  \"Hush, hush! my Lord,\" said Sir Eric.  \"Silence! come here.\"  However imperious with others, Richard from force of habit always obeyed Sir Eric, and now allowed himself to be dragged hastily and silently by him, Osmond following closely, up the stairs, up a second and a third winding flight, still narrower, and with broken steps, to a small round, thick-walled turret chamber, with an extremely small door, and loop-holes of windows high up in the tower.  Here, to his great surprise, he found Dame Astrida, kneeling and telling her beads, two or three of her maidens, and about four of the Norman Squires and men-at-arms.  \"So you have failed, Osmond?\" said the Baron.  \"But what is all this?  How did Fru Astrida come up here?  May I not go to the King and have those insolent Franks punished?\"  \"Listen to me, Lord Richard,\" said Sir Eric: \"that smooth-spoken King whose words so charmed you last night is an ungrateful deceiver.  The Franks have always hated and feared the Normans, and not being able to conquer us fairly, they now take to foul means.  Louis came hither from Flanders, he has brought this great troop of French to surprise us, claim you as a ward of the crown, and carry you away with him to some prison of his own.\"  \"You will not let me go?\" said Richard.  \"Not while I live,\" said Sir Eric.  \"Alberic is gone to warn the Count of Harcourt, to call the Normans together, and here we are ready to defend this chamber to our last breath, but we are few, the French are many, and succour may be far off.\"  \"Then you meant to have taken me out of their reach this morning, Osmond?\"  \"Yes, my Lord.\"  \"And if I had not flown into a passion and told who I was, I might have been safe!  O Sir Eric!  Sir Eric! you will not let me be carried off to a French prison!\"  \"Here, my child,\" said Dame Astrida, holding out her arms, \"Sir Eric will do all he can for you, but we are in God's hands!\"  Richard came and leant against her.  \"I wish I had not been in a passion!\" said he, sadly, after a silence; then looking at her in wonder--\"But how came you up all this way?\"  \"It is a long way for my old limbs,\" said Fru Astrida, smiling, \"but my son helped me, and he deems it the only safe place in the Castle.\"  \"The safest,\" said Sir Eric, \"and that is not saying much for it.\"  \"Hark!\" said Osmond, \"what a tramping the Franks are making.  They are beginning to wonder where the Duke is.\"  \"To the stairs, Osmond,\" said Sir Eric.  \"On that narrow step one man may keep them at bay a long time.  You can speak their jargon too, and hold parley with them.\"  \"Perhaps they will think I am gone,\" whispered Richard, \"if they cannot find me, and go away.\"  Osmond and two of the Normans were, as he spoke, taking their stand on the narrow spiral stair, where there was just room for one man on the step.  Osmond was the lowest, the other two above him, and it would have been very hard for an enemy to force his way past them.  Osmond could plainly hear the sounds of the steps and voices of the French as they consulted together, and sought for the Duke.  A man at length was heard clanking up these very stairs, till winding round, he suddenly found himself close upon young de Centeville.  \"Ha!  Norman!\" he cried, starting back in amazement, \"what are you doing here?\"  \"My duty,\" answered Osmond, shortly.  \"I am here to guard this stair;\" and his drawn sword expressed the same intention.  The Frenchman drew back, and presently a whispering below was heard, and soon after a voice came up the stairs, saying, \"Norman--good Norman--\"  \"What would you say?\" replied Osmond, and the head of another Frank appeared.  \"What means all this, my friend?\" was the address.  \"Our King comes as a guest to you, and you received him last evening as loyal vassals.  Wherefore have you now drawn out of the way, and striven to bear off your young Duke into secret places?  Truly it looks not well that you should thus strive to keep him apart, and therefore the King requires to see him instantly.\"  \"Sir Frenchman,\" replied Osmond, \"your King claims the Duke as his ward. How that may be my father knows not, but as he was committed to his charge by the states of Normandy, he holds himself bound to keep him in his own hands until further orders from them.\"  \"That means, insolent Norman, that you intend to shut the boy up and keep him in your own rebel hands.  You had best yield--it will be the better for you and for him.  The child is the King's ward, and he shall not be left to be nurtured in rebellion by northern pirates.\"  At this moment a cry from without arose, so loud as almost to drown the voices of the speakers on the turret stair, a cry welcome to the ears of Osmond, repeated by a multitude of voices, \"Haro!  Haro! our little Duke!\"  It was well known as a Norman shout.  So just and so ready to redress all grievances had the old Duke Rollo been, that his very name was an appeal against injustice, and whenever wrong was done, the Norman outcry against the injury was always \"Ha Rollo!\" or as it had become shortened, \"Haro.\" And now Osmond knew that those whose affection had been won by the uprightness of Rollo, were gathering to protect his helpless grandchild.  The cry was likewise heard by the little garrison in the turret chamber, bringing hope and joy.  Richard thought himself already rescued, and springing from Fru Astrida, danced about in ecstasy, only longing to see the faithful Normans, whose voices he heard ringing out again and again, in calls for their little Duke, and outcries against the Franks.  The windows were, however, so high, that nothing could be seen from them but the sky; and, like Richard, the old Baron de Centeville was almost beside himself with anxiety to know what force was gathered together, and what measures were being taken.  He opened the door, called to his son, and asked if he could tell what was passing, but Osmond knew as little--he could see nothing but the black, cobwebbed, dusty steps winding above his head, while the clamours outside, waxing fiercer and louder, drowned all the sounds which might otherwise have come up to him from the French within the Castle.  At last, however, Osmond called out to his father, in Norse, \"There is a Frank Baron come to entreat, and this time very humbly, that the Duke may come to the King.\"  \"Tell him,\" replied Sir Eric, \"that save with consent of the council of Normandy, the child leaves not my hands.\"  \"He says,\" called back Osmond, after a moment, \"that you shall guard him yourself, with as many as you choose to bring with you.  He declares on the faith of a free Baron, that the King has no thought of ill--he wants to show him to the Rouennais without, who are calling for him, and threaten to tear down the tower rather than not see their little Duke. Shall I bid him send a hostage?\"  \"Answer him,\" returned the Baron, \"that the Duke leaves not this chamber unless a pledge is put into our hands for his safety.  There was an oily-tongued Count, who sat next the King at supper--let him come hither, and then perchance I may trust the Duke among them.\"  Osmond gave the desired reply, which was carried to the King.  Meantime the uproar outside grew louder than ever, and there were new sounds, a horn was winded, and there was a shout of \"_Dieu aide_!\" the Norman war-cry, joined with \"Notre Dame de Harcourt!\"  \"There, there!\" cried Sir Eric, with a long breath, as if relieved of half his anxieties, \"the boy has sped well.  Bernard is here at last! Now his head and hand are there, I doubt no longer.\"  \"Here comes the Count,\" said Osmond, opening the door, and admitting a stout, burly man, who seemed sorely out of breath with the ascent of the steep, broken stair, and very little pleased to find himself in such a situation.  The Baron de Centeville augured well from the speed with which he had been sent, thinking it proved great perplexity and distress on the part of Louis.  Without waiting to hear his hostage speak, he pointed to a chest on which he had been sitting, and bade two of his men-at-arms stand on each side of the Count, saying at the same time to Fru Astrida, \"Now, mother, if aught of evil befalls the child, you know your part.  Come, Lord Richard.\"  Richard moved forward.  Sir Eric held his hand.  Osmond kept close behind him, and with as many of the men-at-arms as could be spared from guarding Fru Astrida and her hostage, he descended the stairs, not by any means sorry to go, for he was weary of being besieged in that turret chamber, whence he could see nothing, and with those friendly cries in his ears, he could not be afraid.
