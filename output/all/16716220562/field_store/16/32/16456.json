Here they endured great hardships, but were at last entertained by the mighty Queen of a savage people, a white woman of peculiar loveliness, who, under circumstances which I cannot enter into, but which you will one day learn, if you live, from the contents of the box, finally murdered my ancestor Kallikrates. His wife, however, escaped, how, I know not, to Athens, bearing a child with her, whom she named Tisisthenes, or the Mighty Avenger. Five hundred years or more afterwards, the family migrated to Rome under circumstances of which no trace remains, and here, probably with the idea of preserving the idea of vengeance which we find set out in the name of Tisisthenes, they appear to have pretty regularly assumed the cognomen of Vindex, or Avenger. Here, too, they remained for another five centuries or more, till about 770 A.D., when Charlemagne invaded Lombardy, where they were then settled, whereon the head of the family seems to have attached himself to the great Emperor, and to have returned with him across the Alps, and finally to have settled in Brittany. Eight generations later his lineal representative crossed to England in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and in the time of William the Conqueror was advanced to great honour and power. From that time to the present day I can trace my descent without a break. Not that the Vinceys—for that was the final corruption of the name after its bearers took root in English soil—have been particularly distinguished—they never came much to the fore. Sometimes they were soldiers, sometimes merchants, but on the whole they have preserved a dead level of respectability, and a still deader level of mediocrity. From the time of Charles II. till the beginning of the present century they were merchants. About 1790 my grandfather made a considerable fortune out of brewing, and retired. In 1821 he died, and my father succeeded him, and dissipated most of the money. Ten years ago he died also, leaving me a net income of about two thousand a year. Then it was that I undertook an expedition in connection with _that_,” and he pointed to the iron chest, “which ended disastrously enough. On my way back I travelled in the South of Europe, and finally reached Athens. There I met my beloved wife, who might well also have been called the ‘Beautiful,’ like my old Greek ancestor. There I married her, and there, a year afterwards, when my boy was born, she died.”   [1] The Strong and Beautiful, or, more accurately, the Beautiful in  strength.   [2] The Kallikrates here referred to by my friend was a Spartan,  spoken of by Herodotus (Herod. ix. 72) as being remarkable for his  beauty. He fell at the glorious battle of Platæa (September 22, B.C.  479), when the Lacedæmonians and Athenians under Pausanias routed the  Persians, putting nearly 300,000 of them to the sword. The following  is a translation of the passage, “For Kallikrates died out of the  battle, he came to the army the most beautiful man of the Greeks of  that day—not only of the Lacedæmonians themselves, but of the other  Greeks also. He when Pausanias was sacrificing was wounded in the side  by an arrow; and then they fought, but on being carried off he  regretted his death, and said to Arimnestus, a Platæan, that he did  not grieve at dying for Greece, but at not having struck a blow, or,  although he desired so to do, performed any deed worthy of himself.”  This Kallikrates, who appears to have been as brave as he was  beautiful, is subsequently mentioned by Herodotus as having been  buried among the ἰρένες‚ (young commanders), apart from the other  Spartans and the Helots.—L. H. H.        He paused a while, his head sunk upon his hand, and then       continued—        “My marriage had diverted me from a project which I cannot enter       into now. I have no time, Holly—I have no time! One day, if you       accept my trust, you will learn all about it. After my wife’s       death I turned my mind to it again. But first it was necessary,       or, at least, I conceived that it was necessary, that I should       attain to a perfect knowledge of Eastern dialects, especially       Arabic. It was to facilitate my studies that I came here. Very       soon, however, my disease developed itself, and now there is an       end of me.” And as though to emphasise his words he burst into       another terrible fit of coughing.        I gave him some more whisky, and after resting he went on—        “I have never seen my boy, Leo, since he was a tiny baby. I never       could bear to see him, but they tell me that he is a quick and       handsome child. In this envelope,” and he produced a letter from       his pocket addressed to myself, “I have jotted down the course I       wish followed in the boy’s education. It is a somewhat peculiar       one. At any rate, I could not entrust it to a stranger. Once       more, will you undertake it?”        “I must first know what I am to undertake,” I answered.        “You are to undertake to have the boy, Leo, to live with you till       he is twenty-five years of age—not to send him to school,       remember. On his twenty-fifth birthday your guardianship will       end, and you will then, with the keys that I give you now” (and       he placed them on the table) “open the iron box, and let him see       and read the contents, and say whether or no he is willing to       undertake the quest. There is no obligation on him to do so. Now,       as regards terms. My present income is two thousand two hundred a       year. Half of that income I have secured to you by will for life,       contingently on your undertaking the guardianship—that is, one       thousand a year remuneration to yourself, for you will have to       give up your life to it, and one hundred a year to pay for the       board of the boy. The rest is to accumulate till Leo is       twenty-five, so that there may be a sum in hand should he wish to       undertake the quest of which I spoke.”        “And suppose I were to die?” I asked.        “Then the boy must become a ward of Chancery and take his chance.       Only be careful that the iron chest is passed on to him by your       will. Listen, Holly, don’t refuse me. Believe me, this is to your       advantage. You are not fit to mix with the world—it would only       embitter you. In a few weeks you will become a Fellow of your       College, and the income that you will derive from that combined       with what I have left you will enable you to live a life of       learned leisure, alternated with the sport of which you are so       fond, such as will exactly suit you.”        He paused and looked at me anxiously, but I still hesitated. The       charge seemed so very strange.        “For my sake, Holly. We have been good friends, and I have no       time to make other arrangements.”        “Very well,” I said, “I will do it, provided there is nothing in       this paper to make me change my mind,” and I touched the envelope       he had put upon the table by the keys.        “Thank you, Holly, thank you. There is nothing at all. Swear to       me by God that you will be a father to the boy, and follow my       directions to the letter.”        “I swear it,” I answered solemnly.        “Very well, remember that perhaps one day I shall ask for the       account of your oath, for though I am dead and forgotten, yet I       shall live. There is no such thing as death, Holly, only a       change, and, as you may perhaps learn in time to come, I believe       that even that change could under certain circumstances be       indefinitely postponed,” and again he broke into one of his       dreadful fits of coughing.        “There,” he said, “I must go, you have the chest, and my will       will be found among my papers, under the authority of which the       child will be handed over to you. You will be well paid, Holly,       and I know that you are honest, but if you betray my trust, by       Heaven, I will haunt you.”        I said nothing, being, indeed, too bewildered to speak.        He held up the candle, and looked at his own face in the glass.       It had been a beautiful face, but disease had wrecked it. “Food       for the worms,” he said. “Curious to think that in a few hours I       shall be stiff and cold—the journey done, the little game played       out. Ah me, Holly! life is not worth the trouble of life, except       when one is in love—at least, mine has not been; but the boy       Leo’s may be if he has the courage and the faith. Good-bye, my       friend!” and with a sudden access of tenderness he flung his arm       about me and kissed me on the forehead, and then turned to go.        “Look here, Vincey,” I said, “if you are as ill as you think, you       had better let me fetch a doctor.”        “No, no,” he said earnestly. “Promise me that you won’t. I am       going to die, and, like a poisoned rat, I wish to die alone.”        “I don’t believe that you are going to do anything of the sort,”       I answered. He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3155"],["title","She (#3)"],["body",", and, with the word “Remember” on his lips,       was gone. As for myself, I sat down and rubbed my eyes, wondering       if I had been asleep. As this supposition would not bear       investigation I gave it up and began to think that Vincey must       have been drinking. I knew that he was, and had been, very ill,       but still it seemed impossible that he could be in such a       condition as to be able to know for certain that he would not       outlive the night. Had he been so near dissolution surely he       would scarcely have been able to walk, and carry a heavy iron box       with him. The whole story, on reflection, seemed to me utterly       incredible, for I was not then old enough to be aware how many       things happen in this world that the common sense of the average       man would set down as so improbable as to be absolutely       impossible. This is a fact that I have only recently mastered.       Was it likely that a man would have a son five years of age whom       he had never seen since he was a tiny infant? No. Was it likely       that he could foretell his own death so accurately? No. Was it       likely that he could trace his pedigree for more than three       centuries before Christ, or that he would suddenly confide the       absolute guardianship of his child, and leave half his fortune,       to a college friend? Most certainly not. Clearly Vincey was       either drunk or mad. That being so, what did it mean? and what       was in the sealed iron chest?        The whole thing baffled and puzzled me to such an extent that at       last I could stand it no longer, and determined to sleep over it.       So I jumped up, and having put the keys and the letter that       Vincey had left away into my despatch-box, and stowed the iron       chest in a large portmanteau, I turned in, and was soon fast       asleep.        As it seemed to me, I had only been asleep for a few minutes when       I was awakened by somebody calling me. I sat up and rubbed my       eyes; it was broad daylight—eight o’clock, in fact.        “Why, what is the matter with you, John?” I asked of the gyp who       waited on Vincey and myself. “You look as though you had seen a       ghost!”        “Yes, sir, and so I have,” he answered, “leastways I’ve seen a       corpse, which is worse. I’ve been in to call Mr. Vincey, as       usual, and there he lies stark and dead!”     II. THE YEARS ROLL BY         As might be expected, poor Vincey’s sudden death created a great       stir in the College; but, as he was known to be very ill, and a       satisfactory doctor’s certificate was forthcoming, there was no       inquest. They were not so particular about inquests in those days       as they are now; indeed, they were generally disliked, because of       the scandal. Under all these circumstances, being asked no       questions, I did not feel called upon to volunteer any       information about our interview on the night of Vincey’s decease,       beyond saying that he had come into my rooms to see me, as he       often did. On the day of the funeral a lawyer came down from       London and followed my poor friend’s remains to the grave, and       then went back with his papers and effects, except, of course,       the iron chest which had been left in my keeping. For a week       after this I heard no more of the matter, and, indeed, my       attention was amply occupied in other ways, for I was up for my       Fellowship, a fact that had prevented me from attending the       funeral or seeing the lawyer. At last, however, the examination       was over, and I came back to my rooms and sank into an easy chair       with a happy consciousness that I had got through it very fairly.        Soon, however, my thoughts, relieved of the pressure that had       crushed them into a single groove during the last few days,       turned to the events of the night of poor Vincey’s death, and       again I asked myself what it all meant, and wondered if I should       hear anything more of the matter, and if I did not, what it would       be my duty to do with the curious iron chest. I sat there and       thought and thought till I began to grow quite disturbed over the       whole occurrence: the mysterious midnight visit, the prophecy of       death so shortly to be fulfilled, the solemn oath that I had       taken, and which Vincey had called on me to answer to in another       world than this. Had the man committed suicide? It looked like       it. And what was the quest of which he spoke? The circumstances       were uncanny, so much so that, though I am by no means nervous,       or apt to be alarmed at anything that may seem to cross the       bounds of the natural, I grew afraid, and began to wish I had       nothing to do with them. How much more do I wish it now, over       twenty years afterwards!        As I sat and thought, there came a knock at the door, and a       letter, in a big blue envelope, was brought in to me. I saw at a       glance that it was a lawyer’s letter, and an instinct told me       that it was connected with my trust. The letter, which I still       have, runs thus:—  “Sir,—Our client, the late M. L. Vincey, Esq., who died on the 9th instant in —— College, Cambridge, has left behind him a Will, of which you will please find copy enclosed and of which we are the executors. Under this Will you will perceive that you take a life-interest in about half of the late Mr. Vincey’s property, now invested in Consols, subject to your acceptance of the guardianship of his only son, Leo Vincey, at present an infant, aged five. Had we not ourselves drawn up the document in question in obedience to Mr. Vincey’s clear and precise instructions, both personal and written, and had he not then assured us that he had very good reasons for what he was doing, we are bound to tell you that its provisions seem to us of so unusual a nature, that we should have felt bound to call the attention of the Court of Chancery to them, in order that such steps might be taken as seemed desirable to it, either by contesting the capacity of the testator or otherwise, to safeguard the interests of the infant. As it is, knowing that the testator was a gentleman of the highest intelligence and acumen, and that he has absolutely no relations living to whom he could have confided the guardianship of the child, we do not feel justified in taking this course.        “Awaiting such instructions as you please to send us as regards       the delivery of the infant and the payment of the proportion of       the dividends due to you,        “We remain, Sir, faithfully yours,        “Geoffrey and Jordan.        “Horace L. Holly, Esq.”        I put down the letter, and ran my eye through the Will, which       appeared, from its utter unintelligibility, to have been drawn on       the strictest legal principles. So far as I could discover,       however, it exactly bore out what my friend Vincey had told me on       the night of his death. So it was true after all. I must take the       boy. Suddenly I remembered the letter which Vincey had left with       the chest. I fetched and opened it. It only contained such       directions as he had already given to me as to opening the chest       on Leo’s twenty-fifth birthday, and laid down the outlines of the       boy’s education, which was to include Greek, the higher       Mathematics, and _Arabic_. At the end there was a postscript to       the effect that if the boy died under the age of twenty-five,       which, however, he did not believe would be the case, I was to       open the chest, and act on the information I obtained if I saw       fit. If I did not see fit, I was to destroy all the contents. On       no account was I to pass them on to a stranger.        As this letter added nothing material to my knowledge, and       certainly raised no further objection in my mind to entering on       the task I had promised my dead friend to undertake, there was       only one course open to me—namely, to write to Messrs. Geoffrey       and Jordan, and express my acceptance of the trust, stating that       I should be willing to commence my guardianship of Leo in ten       days’ time. This done I went to the authorities of my college,       and, having told them as much of the story as I considered       desirable, which was not very much, after considerable difficulty       succeeded in persuading them to stretch a point, and, in the       event of my having obtained a fellowship, which I was pretty       certain I had done, allow me to have the child to live with me.       Their consent, however, was only granted on the condition that I       vacated my rooms in college and took lodgings. This I did, and       with some difficulty succeeded in obtaining very good apartments       quite close to the college gates. The next thing was to find a       nurse. And on this point I came to a determination. I would have       no woman to lord it over me about the child, and steal his       affections from me. The boy was old enough to do without female       assistance, so I set to work to hunt up a suitable male       attendant. With some difficulty I succeeded in hiring a most       respectable round-faced young man, who had been a helper in a       hunting-stable, but who said that he was one of a family of       seventeen and well-accustomed to the ways of children, and       professed himself quite willing to undertake the charge of Master       Leo when he arrived. Then, having taken the iron box to town, and       with my own hands deposited it at my banker’s, I bought some       books upon the health and management of children and read them,       first to myself, and then aloud to Job—that was the young man’s       name—and waited.        At length the child arrived in the charge of an elderly person,       who wept bitterly at parting with him, and a beautiful boy he       was. Indeed, I"]]]
