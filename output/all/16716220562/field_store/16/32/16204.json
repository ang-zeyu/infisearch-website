Let ladies answer the question, and let them further most solemnly consider that the girls of to-day are the mothers of to-morrow, and that upon the measure of their own health and strength depends the well-being of coming generations.  It is only fair to add, that if the practice of interfering with the freedom of the waist is reprehensible in the case of ladies, it is, in one sense, still more so in the case of the male sex, because, as has been shown before, men depend more for their breathing upon the action of the abdominal muscle than women. They should, therefore, neither wear tight-fitting vests, nor suspend their pantaloons by means of waistbands, belts, or buckles. Loose garments and braces are the proper thing, though the latter are commonly, but erroneously, considered to be injurious. _Abdominal_ belts may be worn with advantage by persons of either sex requiring their support; but these are very different from stays or waist-bands. I find that an enterprising firm is advertising corsets for gentlemen (!), and a woodcut may be seen in some papers representing a young Adonis laced up in regular ladies' fashion, so that, if it were not for his luxurious moustache, one would certainly take the drawing to be meant for a woman. It is almost impossible to imagine that a man could ever make such a fool of himself; on the other hand, it is clear that these advertisements would not continue to appear if they did not bring customers. But these poor creatures do not deserve to be called men, and I am sincerely sorry for them.  With regard to the question whether inspiration should take place through the mouth or through the nostrils, I must enter my most decided protest against making it a practice to inhale through the mouth. There are, of course, occasions when this is unavoidable, as, for instance, where the singer has rapidly to take what is called a \"half breath.\" But complete inflation, or, \"full breath,\" is not the work of a moment; it takes time, and must be done gradually, steadily, and without the slightest interruption. This should _always_ be done through the nostrils. The mouth was never intended for breathing, while the nose is specially and admirably adapted for this purpose. Not only can the lungs be well and quickly filled through this channel, but it is so cunningly devised that it acts at the same time as a \"respirator,\" both purifying and warming the air before it touches the more delicate parts of the vocal organ. On the other hand, when inhaled through the mouth, the air carries with it, sometimes right into the voicebox, dust and other impurities, and its temperature is not materially altered. The consequence is that the throat and voicebox, when heated by singing or talking, or by hot rooms, are often exposed to cold, raw, and foggy winter air, and serious derangements of the respiratory organs are the natural consequence. If, moreover, this pernicious habit of breathing be once contracted, we shall soon also sleep with open mouths, thus parching our throats, and sowing the seeds of many a serious disorder.  On this point I quote a few lines from Dr. Louis Elsberg,[F] professor of laryngology in the University of New York: \"The natural mode of quiet breathing is through the nose; mouth-breathing is an acquirement. A new-born infant would choke to death if you closed its nose; it does not immediately know how to get air into the lungs through the mouth until after, by depressing the tongue, you have once made a passage for it.\"  George Catlin, the celebrated traveller among American Indians, became so thoroughly convinced that the difference between the healthy condition and physical perfection of these people in their primitive state, especially their sound teeth and good lungs, and the deplorable mortality, the numerous diseases and deformities in _civilized_ communities, is mainly due to the habit, common among the latter, of breathing through the mouth, especially during sleep, that he wrote a book entitled \"Malrespiration and its Effects upon the Enjoyment and Life of Man.\" In this book he says, \"If I were to endeavour to bequeath to posterity the most important motto which human language can convey, it should be in three words, 'Shut your mouth.' In the social transactions of life this might have its beneficial results as the most friendly cautionary advice, or be received as the grossest of insults; but where I would print and engrave it, in every nursery and on every bedpost in the universe, its meaning could not be mistaken, and obeyed, its importance would soon be realized.\"  He also says, \"It is one of the misfortunes of civilization that it has too many amusing and exciting things for the mouth to say, and too many delicious things for it to taste, to allow of its being closed during the day. The mouth therefore has too little reserve for the protection of its natural purity of expression, and too much exposure for the protection of its garniture; but, _do keep your mouth shut_ when you _read_, when you _write_, when you _listen_, when you _are in pain_, when you are _walking_, when you are _running_, when you are _riding_, and _by all means when you are angry_! There is _no person_ but who will find and acknowledge _improvement_ in _health_ and _enjoyment_ from even a temporary attention to this advice.\"  Again he says, \"There is a proverb, as old and unchangeable as their hills, amongst North American Indians, 'My son, if thou wouldst be wise, open first thy eyes; thy ears next, and last of all thy mouth, that thy words may be words of wisdom, and give no advantage to thine adversary.' This might be adopted with good effect in _civilized_ life; he who would _strictly adhere_ to it would be sure to reap its benefits in his _waking_ hours, and would _soon find_ the habit running into his hours of _rest_, into which he would _calmly_ enter; dismissing the nervous anxieties of the day, as he firmly closed his teeth and his lips, only to be opened _after_ his eyes and his ears in the morning, the rest of _such_ sleep would bear him daily and hourly proof of its value.\"  Catlin regards the habit of sleeping with the mouth open the most pernicious of _all bad habits_. The horrors of nightmare and snoring are, according to him, but the _least_ of its evil effects. He thinks \"for the greater portion of the thousands and tens of thousands of persons suffering with weakness of lungs, with bronchitis, asthma, indigestion, and other affections of the digestive and respiratory organs,\" the correction of this habit is a _panacea_ for their ills!  He insists that \"_mothers_ should be looked to as the first and principal _correctors_ of this most destructive of human habits; ... and the united and simultaneous efforts of the civilized world should be exerted in the overthrow of a monster so destructive to the good looks and life of man. Every physician should advise his patients, and every boarding-school in existence and every hospital should have its surgeon or matron, and every regiment its officer, to make their nightly and hourly 'rounds,' to force a _stop_ to so unnatural, disgusting, and dangerous a habit! Under the working of such a system, mothers guarding and helping the helpless, schoolmasters their scholars, hospital surgeons their patients, generals their soldiers, and the rest of the world protecting themselves, a few years would show the glorious results in the bills of mortality, and the next generation would be a _regeneration_ of the human race.\"  =The Windpipe= (pl. I, W).--Having examined the bellows of our vocal organ, we next notice the windpipe, by means of which the air is carried into and out of the lungs. It is an elastic tube kept open by 18 or 20 rings which do not quite meet at the back. It enters the lungs by means of two smaller tubes, which in their turn branch out very much like the roots of a tree, until their ramifications end in the microscopic cells of the lungs. The windpipe is capable of being slightly elongated or shortened, and narrowed or widened, and its interior is covered with a mucous membrane, which, as its name implies, is continually kept in a moist state.  =The Voicebox, or Larynx= (pl. V) may be described as resembling a funnel, the upper part of which has been bent into a triangular shape. Its front corner (pl. V, 1) may be both seen and felt in the throat, and the general position of the voicebox is thereby at once indicated. The framework of the voicebox consists of five parts. 1st. The Ring cartilage (pl. V, 2) is so named on account of its general resemblance to a signet ring. It is narrow in front, and has the part corresponding to the seal behind; the upper border (pl. V, 8, 4) rises very considerably towards the back, where it is about an inch high. 2nd. Riding upon this, as it were, with its hollow part towards the back, is the Shield cartilage (pl. V, 5), which consists of two plates united in front at an angle which forms the prominence referred to just now as that corner of the triangular funnel (pl. V, 1) which may be both seen and felt in the throat, and which is commonly called the Adam's Apple. It protects the interior and more delicate parts of the voice apparatus, from which circumstance it derives its name of shield cartilage. The plates of the shield have each at the back two horns, the upper and the lower. With the upper horns (pl. VI, 1, 2) the shield cartilage is attached by means of bands (pl. VI, 6, 7) to the corresponding projections (pl. VI, 4, 5) of the tongue-bone (pl. VI, 3), which has the shape of a horseshoe. With the lower horns (pl. V, 8), of which on our diagram we can only see one, it moves upon the ring cartilage as upon a hinge (pl. V, 9).  [Illustration: PLATE V.  SIDE VIEW OF THE VOICEBOX, OR LARYNX.     1.

WINDPIPE.  ]  This is a very particular point, and I beg the reader particularly to notice that if the shield cartilage (pl. V, 5) were gradually drawn downwards and forwards, the space which we now see between the shield and the ring (pl. V, 10) would get smaller and smaller, until at last it quite disappeared; and the distance between the front of the shield (pl. V, 1) and the highest part of the back of the ring (pl. V, 4) would be increased.       I may observe here that authorities differ as to whether the shield      moves upon the ring, or the ring upon the shield, and that some      maintain the one is drawn down while the other is tipped upward. It      is sufficient for our purpose, however, that a movement as upon a      hinge takes place, whereby, as explained just now, the distance      between the front of the shield and the highest part of the back of      the ring is increased.  3rd. =The Lid= (pl. V, 11) is an elastic cartilage which serves to close the voicebox in the act of swallowing, in order to protect it against any intruding foreign substances. The food we take has to pass over it, and it sometimes happens, when the lid has not been pulled down tight enough, that a particle of food enters the voicebox, in which case we say it has \"gone the wrong way,\" and there is then no peace until the intruder has been got rid of, generally by a violent fit of coughing.       The lid, it is true, is not the only means of protection which the      voicebox possesses. Professor C. J. Eberth, for instance, mentions      (Archiv für pathol: Anatomie, vol. lxiii., p. 135, Berlin, 1868)      the case of a woman who, upon dissection, was found to be entirely      without the free upper part of the lid, which could alone cover the      voicebox. She had never experienced any difficulty in swallowing,      and it is therefore clear that with her the closing of some of the      parts immediately below was sufficient to prevent the food from      getting into the voicebox. But \"the exception proves the rule,\" and      in spite of this and other similar cases, the fact remains that the      lid is obviously the first and most natural protector of the      voicebox.  4th and 5th. We have thus far become acquainted with three cartilages out of the five. Let us now remove one plate of the shield, as though cutting it off with a knife (pl. VII, 1 and 2), in order that we may look inside and see the remaining two cartilages which have hitherto been hidden by it. These are--  =The Pyramids= (pl. VII, 1 and 2), so called because of their shape. Their bases are triangular and hollowed out; their sides taper upwards and terminate in points which are bent slightly backwards, and they have each two projections, one pointing forwards (pl. VII, 3) and the other outwards and backwards (pl. VII, 4). It will be convenient to have a special name for the projections pointing outwards and backwards, which we will therefore call the Levers.  The Pyramids are attached with their hollow bases to the borders of the ring (pl. VII, 5), and they are capable of executing rotary movements with surprising freedom and rapidity. Their inner sides may be made to run parallel or to diverge. In addition to this they can be drawn towards each other, or away from each other, so that their summits may either be widely separated or brought close together.  =The Vocal Ligaments= are two ledges of elastic tissue covered with a very delicate membrane. Each one of them is connected along its whole length, on one side, with the shield cartilage. The vocal ligaments are attached by their hinder ends to those little projections of the pyramids which point forwards (pl. VII, 3, 3), and by their front ends to the centre of the shield (pl. VII, 6), where the two plates meet under a more or less acute angle.  [Illustration: PLATE VII.

WINDPIPE. ]       These vocal ligaments are generally called the vocal cords, but      this term is misleading, as it implies strings like those, for      instance, of the violin, which are attached only at either end and      are free at every other point. This, however, as we have just seen,      is not the case, the \"Cords\" being free only along their inner      edges. The name \"Vocal Bands,\" which German physiologists have      substituted for \"Vocal Cords,\" does not mend the matter, as it is      open to exactly the same objections. The term \"Vocal Lips,\" also      used by some writers, is, in my judgment, the most unfortunate of      all, because it conveys a totally wrong idea of these parts, as      will be seen from a description in another chapter of their      movements in the act of singing. I have, therefore, sought for a      word which, as a proper description of the thing it is to      designate, shall always call a correct image to the reader's mind,      and as I cannot find a better one than \"Ligament,\" I have adopted      it. I shall consequently in these pages always speak of the      tone-producing element as the \"Vocal Ligaments.\"  The vocal ligaments, having met, are struck by the air blown against them from below, and being elastic they yield, allowing themselves to be forced upwards. A little air is thereby set free, and the pressure from below diminished, in consequence of which the vocal ligaments resume their former position, and even move a little more downwards. The renewed pressure of the air once more overcomes the resistance of the vocal ligaments, which again recede as soon as another escape of air has taken place, and this process is repeated in rapid and regular succession. In this manner, and in this manner alone, is vocal tone produced, whether it be called chest, falsetto, head, or by any other name.       There are still some writers who teach a different doctrine. For      instance, Miss Sabilla Novello, in her \"Voice and Vocal Art,\"      embodied in the \"Collegiate Vocal Tutor,\" published by Novello,      Ewer, and Co., says on p. 9, that \"The head voice results from the      upper [_i.e._, the false] vocal cords\" (these we shall see      presently), and on page 13, that the falsetto tones \"are created      principally by the action of the trachea [windpipe] and not by that      of the vocal ligaments.\" Another writer, Mr. Rumney Illingworth, in      a paper \"On the Larynx and its Physiology,\" read before the Royal      Medical Society of Edinburgh, on March 3rd, 1879, and communicated      to \"The Students' Journal and Hospital Gazette\" (Vol. IV., No. 91,      p. 151), says that \"The falsetto voice is produced by the laryngeal      sacculi [the pockets of the voicebox, which will be described      further on] acting in the same way as a hazel-nut can be made to      act as a whistle, when the kernel has been extracted through a      small hole in the shell; or as part of the cavity of the mouth acts      in whistling.\" I shall refer to these theories again as the      opportunity for their proper discussion arises; for the present I      will quote a few authorities on the subject.       Dr. CARPENTER, in his \"Human Physiology,\" eighth edition, page 914,      says, \"The true theory of the voice may now be considered as well      established in regard to this essential particular that the sound      is the result of the vibrations of the vocal cords,\" &c.       Professor MARSHALL, in his \"Outlines of Physiology,\" page 255,      says: \"Experiments on living animals show that the vocal cords are      alone the essential organs for the production of voice, for so long      as these remain untouched, although all the other parts in the      interior of the larynx be destroyed, the animal is able to emit      vocal sounds.... The existence of an opening in the larynx of a      living animal, or of man, _above_ the glottis [glottis means the      vibrating element of the voicebox] in no way prevents the formation      of vocal sound; such an opening if situated in the trachea      [windpipe] causes total loss of voice, but by simply closing it,      vocal sounds can again be produced. Such openings, in man, are met      with, either as the results of accidents, of suicidal attempts, or      of operations performed on the larynx or trachea for the relief of      disease.\"       Dr. TOBOLD, Professor in the University of Berlin, in his      \"Laryngoscopie and Kehlkopf Krankheiten\" (Laryngoscopy and Diseases      of the Larynx), p. 131, says, \"Soft palate, lid, pockets, and      pocket-bands are not directly active in the production of either      chest or falsetto tones; they only modify the tone produced in the      glottis.\"       Dr. LUSCHKA, Professor in the University of Tubingen, in his great      work \"Der Kehlkopf des Menschen\" (The Human Larynx), says in the      introduction: \"Only the vocal cords, with the slit they form, have      specifically functional signification, in a narrower sense, of a      voice apparatus, as the parts of the larynx which lie under and      over them have no material and deciding influence on the production      of sound.\"    "]]]
