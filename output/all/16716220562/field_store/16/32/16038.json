If we carelessly cut or bruise our flesh, pain and soreness follow, to induce us to be more careful in the future; or, if we take improper food into the stomach, we are warned, perhaps immediately by a friendly pain, that we have violated an organic law.  16. Sometimes, however, the penalty does not directly follow the sin, and it requires great physiological knowledge to be able to trace the effect to its true cause. If we possess good constitutions, we are responsible for most of our sickness; and bad constitutions, or hereditary diseases, are but the results of the same great law,--the iniquities of the parents being visited on the children. In this view of the subject, how important is the study of physiology and hygiene! For how can we expect to obey laws which we do not understand?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  15. What is said of disease? 16. Why is the study of physiology and hygiene important?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=     CHAPTER II.  STRUCTURE OF MAN,   17. In the structure of the human body, there is a union of fluids and solids. These are essentially the same, for the one is readily changed into the other. There is no fluid that does not contain solid matter in solution, and no solid matter that is destitute of fluid.  18. In different individuals, and at different periods of life the proportion of fluids and solids varies. In youth, the fluids are more abundant than in advanced life. For this reason, the limbs in childhood are soft and round, while in old age they assume a hard and wrinkled appearance.  19. The fluids not only contain the materials from which every part of the body is formed, but they are the medium for conveying the waste, decayed particles of matter from the system. They have various names, according to their nature and function; as, the blood, and the bile.  20. The solids are formed from the fluids, and consequently they are reduced, by chemical analysis, to the same ultimate elements. The particles of matter in solids are arranged variously; sometimes in _fi´bres_, (threads,) sometimes in _lam´i-næ_, (plates,) sometimes homogeneously, as in basement membranes. (Appendix A.)  21. The parts of the body are arranged into _Fi´bres_, _Fas-cic´u-li_, _Tis´sues_, _Or´gans_, _Ap-pa-ra´tus-es_, and _Sys´tems_.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  17. What substances enter into the structure of the human body? Are they essentially the same? 18. What is said of these substances at different periods of life? 19. What offices do the fluids of the system perform? 20. What is said of the solids? How are the particles of matter arranged in solids? 21. Give an arrangement of the parts of the body.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  22. A FIBRE is a thread of exceeding fineness. It is either cylindriform or flattened.  23. A FASCICULUS is the term applied to several fibres united. Its general characteristics are the same as fibres.  24. A TISSUE is a term applied to several different solids of the body.  25. An ORGAN is composed of tissues so arranged as to form an instrument designed for action. The action of an organ is called its _function_, or use.  _Example._ The liver is an organ, and the secretion of the bile from the blood is one of its functions.[1]     [1] Where examples and observations are given or experiments        suggested, let the pupil mention other analogous ones.  26. An APPARATUS is an assemblage of organs designed to produce certain results.  _Example._ The digestive apparatus consists of the teeth, stomach, liver, &c., all of which aid in the digestion of food.  [Illustration: Fig. 2. Represents a portion of broken muscular fibre of animal life, (magnified about seven hundred diameters.)]  27. The term SYSTEM is applied to an assemblage of organs arranged according to some plan, or method; as the nervous system, the respiratory system.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  22. Define a fibre. 23. Define a fasciculus. 24. Define a tissue. 25. Define an organ. What is the action of an organ called? Give examples. _Mention other examples._ 26. What is an apparatus? Give an example 27. How is the term system applied?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  28. A TISSUE is a simple form of organized animal substance. It is flexible, and formed of fibres interwoven in various ways; as, the cellular tissue.  29. However various all organs may appear in their structure and composition, it is now supposed that they can be reduced to a few tissues; as, the _Cel´lu-lar_, _Os´se-ous_, _Mus´cu-lar_, _Mu´cous_, _Ner´vous_, &c. (Appendix B.)  30. The CELLULAR TISSUE,[2] now called the _areolar tissue_, consists of small fibres, or bands, interlaced in every direction, so as to form a net-work, with numerous interstices that communicate freely with each other. These interstices are filled, during life, with a fluid resembling the serum of blood. The use of the areolar tissue is to connect together organs and parts of organs, and to envelop, fix, and protect the vessels and nerves of organs.     [2] The _Cellular_, _Serous_, _Dermoid_, _Fibrous_, and _Mucous        tissues_ are very generally called _membranes_.  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Arrangement of fibres of the cellular tissue magnified one hundred and thirty diameters.]    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  28. What is a tissue? 29. What is said respecting the structure and composition of the various organs? Name the primary membranes. 30. Describe the cellular tissue. How are the cells imbedded in certain tissues? Give observation 1st, relative to the cellular tissue.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  _Observations._ 1st. When this fluid becomes too great in quantity, in consequence of disease, the patient labors under general dropsy. The swelling of the feet when standing, and their return to a proper shape during the night, so often noticed in feeble persons, furnish a striking proof both of the existence and peculiarity of this tissue, which allows the fluid to flow from cell to cell, until it settles in the lower extremities.  2d. The free communication between the cells is still more remarkable in regard to air. Sometimes, when an accidental opening has been made from the air-cells of the lungs into the contiguous cellular tissue, the air in respiration has penetrated every part until the whole body is so inflated as to occasion suffocation. Butchers often avail themselves of the knowledge of this fact, and inflate their meat to give it a fat appearance.  31. \"Although this tissue enters into the composition of all organs, it never loses its own structure, nor participates in the functions of the organ of which it forms a part. Though present in the nerves, it does not share in their sensibility; and though it accompanies every muscle and every muscular fibre, it does not partake of the irritability which belongs to these organs.\"  32. Several varieties of tissue are formed from the cellular; as, the _Se´rous_, _Der´moid_, _Fi´brous_, and several others.  33. The SEROUS TISSUE lines all the closed, or sac-like cavities of the body; as, the chest, joints, and abdomen. It not only lines these cavities, but is reflected, and invests the organs contained in them. The liver and the lungs are thus invested. This membrane is of a whitish color, and smooth on its free surfaces. These surfaces are kept moist, and prevented from adhering by a _se´rous_ fluid, which is separated from the blood. The use of this membrane is to separate organs and also to facilitate the movement of one part upon another, by means of its moist, polished surfaces.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Give observation 2d. 31. What is said of the identity of this tissue? 32. Name the varieties of tissue formed from the cellular. 33. Where is the serous tissue found? What two offices does it perform? Give its structure. What is the use of this membrane?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  34. The DERMOID TISSUE covers the outside of the body. It is called the _cu´tis_, (skin.) This membrane is continuous with the mucous at the various orifices of the body, and in these situations, from the similarity of their structure, it is difficult to distinguish between them.  _Observations._ 1st. In consequence of the continuity and similarity of structure, there is close sympathy between the mucous and dermoid membranes. If the functions of the skin are disturbed, as by a chill, it will frequently cause a catarrh, (cold,) or diarrhoea. Again, in consequence of this intimate sympathy, these complaints can be relieved by exciting a free action in the vessels of the skin.  2d. It is no uncommon occurrence that diseased or irritated conditions of the mucous membrane of the stomach or intestines produce diseases or irritations of the skin, as is seen in the rashes attendant on dyspepsia, and eating certain species of fish. These eruptions of the skin can be relieved by removing the diseased condition of the stomach.  35. The FIBROUS TISSUE consists of longitudinal, parallel fibres, which are closely united. These fibres, in some situations, form a thin, dense, strong membrane, like that which lines the internal surface of the skull, or invests the external surface of the bones. In other instances, they form strong, inelastic bands, called _lig´a-ments_, which bind one bone to another. This tissue also forms _ten´dons_, (white cords,) by which the muscles are attached to the bones.  _Observation._ In the disease called rheumatism, the fibrous tissue is the part principally affected; hence the joints, where this tissue is most abundant, suffer most from this affection.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  34. Describe the dermoid tissue. What is said of the sympathy between the functions of the skin and mucous membrane? Give another instance of the sympathy between these membranes. 35. Of what does the fibrous tissue consist? How do these appear in some situations? How in others? What tissue is generally affected in rheumatism?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  36. The ADIPOSE TISSUE is so arranged as to form"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30541"],["title","A Treatise on Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene (Revised Edition) (#3)"],["body","bags, or cells. These contain a substance called _fat_. This tissue is principally found beneath the skin, abdominal muscles, and around the heart and kidneys; while none is found in the brain, eye, ear, nose, and several other organs.  _Observation._ In those individuals who are corpulent, there is in many instances, a great deposit of this substance. This tissue accumulates more readily than others when a person becomes gross, and is earliest removed when the system emaciates, in acute or chronic diseases. Some of the masses become, in some instances, enlarged. These enlargements are called _adipose_, or _fatty tumors_.  [Illustration: Fig. 4. 1, A portion of the adipose tissue. 2, 2, 2, Minute bags containing fat. 3, A cluster of these bags, separated and suspended.]  37. The CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE is firm, smooth, and highly elastic. Except bone, it is the hardest part of the animal frame. It tips the ends of the bones that concur in forming a joint. Its use is to facilitate the motion of the joints by its smooth surface, while its elastic character diminishes the shock that would otherwise be experienced if this tissue were inelastic.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  36. Describe the adipose tissue. Where does this tissue principally exist? Give observation in regard to the adipose tissue. 37. Describe the cartilaginous tissue. What is its use?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  38 The OSSEOUS TISSUE, in composition and arrangement of matter, varies at different periods of life, and in different bones. In some instances, the bony matter is disposed in plates, while in other instances, the arrangement is cylindrical. Sometimes, the bony matter is dense and compact; again, it is spongy, or porous. In the centre of the long bones, a space is left which is filled with a fatty substance, called _mar´row_.  _Observation._ Various opinions exist among physiologists in regard to the use of marrow. Some suppose it serves as a reservoir of nourishment, while others, that it keeps the bones from becoming dry and brittle. The latter opinion, however, has been called in question, as the bones of the aged man contain more marrow than those of the child, and they are likewise more brittle.  [Illustration: Fig. 5. A section of the femur, (thigh-bone.) 1, 1, The extremities, showing a thin plate of compact texture, which covers small cells, that diminish in size, but increase in number, as they approach the articulation. 2, 2, The walls of the shaft, which are very firm and solid. 3, The cavity that contains the marrow.]  39. The MUSCULAR TISSUE is composed of many fibres, that unite to form fasciculi, each of which is enclosed in a delicate layer of cellular tissue. Bundles of these fasciculi constitute a muscle.  _Observation._ A piece of boiled beef will clearly illustrate the arrangement of muscular fibre.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  38. What is said of the osseous tissue? How is the bony matter arranged in different parts of the animal frame? What is said of the use of marrow? 39. Of what is the muscular tissue composed? How may the arrangement of muscular fibre be illustrated?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  40. The MUCOUS TISSUE differs from the serous by its lining all the cavities which communicate with the air. The nostrils, the mouth, and the stomach afford examples. The external surface of this membrane, or that which is exposed to the air, is soft, and bears some resemblance to the downy rind of a peach. It is covered by a viscid fluid called _mu´cus_. This is secreted by small _gland-cells_, called _ep-i-the´li-a_, or secretory cells of the mucous membrane. The use of this membrane and its secreted mucus is to protect the inner surface of the cavities which it lines.  _Observation._ A remarkable sympathy exists between the remote parts of the mucous membrane. Thus the condition of the stomach may be ascertained by an examination of the tongue.  41. The NERVOUS TISSUE consists of soft, pulpy matter, enclosed in a sheath, called _neu-ri-lem´a_. This tissue consists of two substances. The one, of a pulpy character and gray color, is called _cin-e-ri´tious_, (ash-colored.) The other, of a fibrous character and white, is named _med´ul-la-ry_, (marrow-like.) In every part of the nervous system both substances are united, with the exception of the nervous fibres and filaments, which are solely composed of the medullary matter enclosed in a delicate sheath.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  40. How does the mucous differ from the serous tissue? What is the appearance of the external surface of this membrane? Where is the mucus secreted? What is the use of this membrane? 41. Of what does the nervous tissue consist? Describe the two substances that enter into the composition of the nervous tissue.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=     CHAPTER III  CHEMISTRY OF THE HUMAN BODY.   42. An ULTIMATE ELEMENT is the simplest form of matter with which we are acquainted; as gold, iron, &c.  43. These elements are divided into _metallic_ and _non-metallic_ substances. The metallic substances are _Po-tas´si-um_, _So´di-um_, _Cal´ci-um_, _Mag-ne´si-um_, _A-lu´min-um_, _I´ron_, _Man´ga-nese_, and _Cop´per_. The non-metallic substances are _Ox´y-gen_, _Hy´dro-gen_, _Car´bon_, _Ni´tro-gen_, _Si-li´-ci-um_, _Phos´phor-us_, _Sul´phur_, _Chlo´rine_, and a few others.  44. POTASH (potassium united with oxygen) is found in the blood, bile, perspiration, milk, &c.  45. SODA (sodium combined with oxygen) exists in the muscles, and in the same fluids in which potash is found.  46. LIME (calcium combined with oxygen) forms the principal ingredient of the bones. The lime in them is combined with phosphoric and carbonic acid.  47. MAGNESIA (magnesium combined with oxygen) exists in the bones, brain, and in some of the animal fluids; as milk.  48. SILEX (silicium combined with oxygen) is contained in the hair and in some of the secretions.  49. IRON forms the coloring principle of the red globules of the blood, and is found in every part of the system.  _Observation._ As metallic or mineral substances enter into the ultimate elements of the body, the assertion that all minerals are poisonous, however small the quantity, is untrue.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  42. What is an ultimate element? Give examples. 43. How are they divided? Name the metallic substances. Name the non-metallic substances. 44. What is said of potash? 45. Of soda? 46. Of lime? 47. Of magnesia? 48. Of silex? 49. What forms the coloring principle of the blood? What is said of mineral substances?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  50. OXYGEN is contained in all the fluids and solids of the body. It is almost entirely derived from the inspired air and water. It is expelled in the form of carbonic acid and water from the lungs and skin. It is likewise removed in the other secretions.  51. HYDROGEN is found in all the fluids and in all the solids of the body. It is derived from the food, as well as from water and other drinks. It exists in the greatest abundance in the impure, dark-colored blood of the system. It is removed by the agency of the kidneys, skin, lungs, and other excretory organs.  52. CARBON is an element in the oil, fat, albumen, fibrin, gelatin, bile, and mucus. This element likewise exists in the impure blood in the form of carbonic acid gas. Carbon is obtained from the food, and discharged from the system by the secretions and respiration.  53. NITROGEN is contained in most animal matter, but is most abundant in fibrin. It is not contained in fat and a few other substances.  _Observation._ The peculiar smell of animal matter when burning is owing to nitrogen. This element combined with hydrogen forms _am-mo´ni-a_, (hartshorn,) when animal matter is in a state of putrefaction.  54. PHOSPHORUS is contained in many parts of the system, but more particularly in the bones. It is generally found in combination with oxygen, forming _phosphoric acid_. The phosphoric acid is usually combined with alkaline bases; as lime in the bones, forming phosphate of lime.  55. SULPHUR exists in the bones, muscles, hair, and nails. It is expelled from the system by the skin and intestines.  56. CHLORINE is found in the blood, gastric juice, milk, perspiration, and saliva.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  50. What is said of oxygen? 51. Of hydrogen? 52. What is said of carbon? 53. Of nitrogen? How is ammonia formed? 54. What is said of phosphorus? 55. What is said of sulphur? 56. Of chlorine?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  57. PROXIMATE ELEMENTS are forms of matter that exist in organized bodies in abundance, and are composed chiefly of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, arranged in different proportions. They exist already formed, and may be separated in many instances, by heat or mechanical means. The most important compounds are _Al-bu´men_, _Fi´brin_, _Gel´a-tin_, _Mu´cus_, _Fat_, _Ca´se-ine_, _Chon´drine_, _Lac´tic acid_, and _Os´ma-zome_.  58. ALBUMEN is found in the body, both in a fluid and solid form. It is an element of the skin, glands, hair, and nails, and forms the principal ingredient of the brain. Albumen is without color, taste, or smell, and it coagulates by heat, acids, and alcohol.  _Observation._ The white of an egg is composed of albumen, which can be coagulated or hardened by alcohol. As albumen enters so largely into the composition of the brain, is not the impaired intellect and moral degradation of the inebriate attributable to the effect of alcohol in hardening the albumen of this organ?  59. FIBRIN exists abundantly in the blood, chyle, and lymph. It constitutes the basis of the muscles. Fibrin is of a whitish color, inodorous, and insoluble in cold water. It differs from albumen by possessing the property of coagulating at all temperatures.  _Observation._ Fibrin may be obtained by washing the thick part of blood with cold water; by this process, the red globules, or coloring matter, are separated from this element.  60. GELATIN is found in nearly all the solids, but it is not known"]]]
