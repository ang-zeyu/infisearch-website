They ate their suppers, and the old lamp, as we have said, lay in the armchair close by the warm stove. It was, for the old lamp, as if the whole world was turned upside down. But when the old watchman looked at it, and spoke about what they had lived to see with each other, in rain and drizzle, in the clear, short summer nights, and when the snow drove about so that it was good to get into the pent-house of the cellar,--then all was again in order for the old lamp, it saw it all just as if it were now present;--yes! the wind had blown it up right well,--it had enlightened it.  ------  * Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic is famous for its manufactures of clocks, potteries, and cement; it contains also considerable coal mines, though not worked to any extent. It is fertile in minerals, chalks, potters' clay of the finest quality, and other valuable natural productions; but, on account of the jealous nature of the inhabitants, which deters foreigners from settling there, these productions are not made so available or profitable as they otherwise might be.  ------  The old folks were so clever and industrious, not an hour was quietly dozed away; on Sunday afternoons some book was always brought forth, particularly a book of travels, and the old man read aloud about Africa, about the great forests and the elephants that were there quite wild; and the old woman listened so attentively, and now and then took a side glance at the clay elephants--her flower-pots. \"I can almost imagine it!\" said she; and the lamp wished so much that there was a wax candle to light and be put in it, so that she could plainly see everything just as the lamp saw it; the tall trees, the thick branches twining into one another, the black men on horseback, and whole trains of elephants, which, with their broad feet, crushed the canes and bushes.  \"Of what use are all my abilities when there is no wax candle?\" sighed the lamp; \"they have only train oil and tallow candles, and they are not sufficient.\"  One day there came a whole bundle of stumps of wax candles into the cellar, the largest pieces were burnt, and the old woman used the smaller pieces to wax her thread with when she sewed; there were wax candle ends, but they never thought of putting a little piece in the lamp.  \"Here I stand with my rare abilities,\" said the lamp; \"I have everything within me, but I cannot share any part with them. They know not that I can transform the white walls to the prettiest paper-hangings, to rich forests, to everything that they may wish for. They know it not!\"  For the rest, the lamp stood in a corner, where it always met the eye, and it was neat and well scoured; folks certainly said it was an old piece of rubbish; but the old man and his wife didn't care about that, they were fond of the lamp.  One day it was the old watchman's birth day; the old woman came up to the lamp, smiled, and said, \"I will illuminate for him,\" and the lamp's cowl creaked, for it thought, \"They will now be enlightened!\" But she put in train oil, and no wax candle; it burnt the whole evening; but now it knew that the gift which the stars had given it, the best gift of all, was a dead treasure for this life. It then dreamt--and when one has such abilities, one can surely dream,--that the old folks were dead, and that it had come to an ironfounder's to be cast anew; it was in as much anxiety as when it had to go to the town-hall to be examined by the authorities; but although it had the power to fall to pieces in rust and dust, when it wished it, yet it did not do it; and so it came into the furnace and was re-cast as a pretty iron candlestick, in which any one might set a wax candle. It had the form of an angel, bearing a nosegay, and in the centre of the nosegay they put a wax taper and it was placed on a green writing-table; and the room was so snug and comfortable: there hung beautiful pictures--there stood many books; it was at a poet's, and everything that he wrote, unveiled itself round about: the room became a deep, dark forest,--a sun-lit meadow where the stork stalked about; and a ship's deck high aloft on the swelling sea!  \"What power I have!\" said the old lamp, as it awoke. \"I almost long to be re-cast;--but no, it must not be as long as the old folks live. They are fond of me for the sake of my person. I am to them as a child, and they have scoured me, and they have given me train oil. After all, I am as well off as 'The Congress,'--which is something so very grand.\"  From that time it had more inward peace, which was merited by the old street-lamp.  ------------    THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK.  Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for Charles, and it is all well enough if one do but know it. He had now to take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much less than himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but these two things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little fellow with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he knew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book that lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is possible to be known.  His mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta on her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he pretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his mother had no money to buy a candle.  \"There goes the old washerwoman over the way,\" said his mother, as she looked out of the window. \"The poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain: be a good boy, Tukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?\"  So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of such a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead; in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore put his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one cannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well there he lay, and thought and thought, and all at once it was just as if some one kissed his eyes and mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, \"It were a great sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided me, I therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all times.\" And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping and scratching.  \"Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!\"--that was an old hen who came creeping along, and she was from Kjoge. I am a Kjoger hen,\"* said she, and then she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking about.  ------  * Kjoge a town in the bay of Kjoge \"To see the Kjoge hens,\" is an expression similar to \"showing a child London,\" which is said to be done by taking his head in both hands, and so lifting him off the ground. At the invasion of the English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature took place between the British troops and the undisciplined Danish militia.  ------  \"Kribledy, krabledy--plump!\" down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird, the popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now _he_ said that there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and he was very proud. \"Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* Plump! here I lie capitally.\"  ------  * Prastoe, a still smaller town than Kjoge. Some hundred paces from it lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen generally sojourned during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many of his immortal works into existence.  ------  But little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on horseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A knight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him before him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old town of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town. High towers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many candles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song, and King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced together. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the whole town and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower after the other; and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle had been before,* and the town was so small and poor, and the school boys came along with their books under their arms, and said, \"2000 inhabitants!\" but that was not true, for there were not so many.  ------  * Bordingborg, in the reign of King Waldemar a considerable place, now an unimportant little town. One solitary tower only, and some remains of a wall, show where the castle once stood.  ------  And little Tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed, and yet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside him.  \"Little Tukey! little Tukey!\" cried some one near. It was a seaman, quite a little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a midshipman it was not.  \"Many remembrances from Corsor.* That is a town that is just rising into importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches: formerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31109"],["title","Taxonomic Notes on Mexican Bats of the Genus Rhogeëssa (#0)"],["body","Notes on Mexican Bats of the Genus Rhogeëssa  BY  E.

RAYMOND HALL   Five skins with skulls of _Rhogeëssa_, collected by J. R. Alcorn in the states of Sonora and Nayarit of western Mexico, were recently received at the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas. Two other specimens of the same genus, collected by Walter W. Dalquest in the state of Veracruz of eastern Mexico, also are in the Museum of Natural History. With the aim of applying names to these bats they were compared with materials in the United States National Museum (including the Biological Surveys collection) where there are approximately the same number of Mexican specimens of _Rhogeëssa_ as are in the Museum of Natural History.  The three kinds of _Rhogeëssa_ named from Mexico are as follows: _R. parvula_ from the Tres Marias Islands off the west coast of Nayarit; _R. tumida_ from Mirador, Veracruz, on the eastern slope of the Republic; and _R. gracilis_ from Piaxtla, Puebla, on the southern end of the Mexican Plateau.  Of _Rhogeëssa gracilis_ Miller (N. Amer. Fauna, 13:126, October 16, 1897) only three specimens are known; two are from Piaxtla, Puebla, and the third is from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Only the specimen from the Isthmus has a complete skull. The broken skull of the holotype is partly separated from the skin of the head and in such a manner as to reveal the teeth. The skull of the holotype seems to be broader (relative to its length) across the mastoids and posterior parts of the zygomata than in _R. tumida_ or than in _R. parvula_. My comparisons indicate that _Rhogeëssa gracilis_ has larger (longer and wider) ears than _R. parvula_ and _R. tumida_ and that it is specifically distinct from the two last mentioned kinds.  The two other nominal species from Mexico, _R. parvula_ and _R. tumida_, were named and described by Harrison Allen (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 1866: 285 and 286, respectively) on the basis of three specimens in the United States National Museum. Two were from the Tres Marias Islands and were the basis of the name _R. parvula_; the third was from Mirador, Veracruz, and was the basis of the name _R. tumida_. These specimens seem to have been preserved in alcohol. I have examined the skulls of two of these. One (U.S.N.M., new number 37329, old number 7842) is alleged to be the paratype of _R. parvula_ and the other (U.S.N.M., 84021) is alleged to be the holotype of _R. tumida_. In the glass vial containing skull No. 84021, there is a label in the handwriting of Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., bearing the following information: \"In the orig. descr. the number of this sp. is said to be 8195. This is an error. Specimen catalogued 3.1.98 G.S.M. Jr.\" On the back of a second label in the skull vial there is written, \"There is no doubt that this is the type skull. It was returned by H. A. with no. given in orig. descr. G.S.M. Jr.\" In the catalogue of the U. S. National Museum there is the statement that the type of _Rhogeëssa tumida_ was collected by H. A. Grayson.  The name _Rhogeëssa parvula_ was based on two specimens (Smithsonian Institution Nos. 7841 the type and 7842, in alcohol, collected by Col. Grayson in the Tres Marias Islands off the west coast of Mexico.) The type seems never to have been returned from the Academy of Sciences of Philadelphia to the U. S. National Museum in Washington, D. C., and cannot (in 1951) be found in Philadelphia or anywhere else. The skull, but no other part, of the second specimen is in the United States National Museum under the catalogue number 37329 (old No. 7842). The skull has been broken in two through the interorbital region but is glued together.  Of _R. tumida_, no additional specimen has been saved, so far as I know, from the type locality, Mirador, Veracruz.  Of _R. parvula_, Nelson and Goldman, on May 19, 1897, on María Madre Island, saved in alcohol an additional specimen (92413 U.S.N.M.) from which J. Biggs, Preparator at the National Museum, in 1951, removed and cleaned the skull. In small size and in all other features, the skull of 92413 closely resembles those of specimens saved by Alcorn from the adjoining mainland of Mexico in Sonora and Nayarit. The pelage of the upper parts of 92413 could be described as \"of a light greyish-brown at basal third, fawn-chestnut-brown at apical two-thirds\" which are the words that H. Allen (_op. cit._: 285) used to describe the pelage of his _R. parvula_. The external measurements of 92413 are: total length, 60; length of tail, 25; length of hind foot, 5.5; and ear from notch, 11.0. The first two measurements are slightly smaller than the corresponding measurements of any other specimen seen. Nevertheless, the measurements (tail, 30.5; hind foot, 5.3 [after H. Allen, orig. descr.]) of the holotype of _R. parvula_, also from the Tres Marias Islands, show that it was as large as no. 39724 from the adjoining mainland (see table 1).  According to the original descriptions, _R. parvula_ and _R. tumida_ differ in size, _R. parvula_ being the smaller. As may be seen from table 1, the alleged type of _R. tumida_ and the alleged paratype of _R. parvula_ indicate the opposite! All specimens obtained since the time of the original descriptions, as may be seen by inspecting table 1, support the correctness of the original descriptions. Therefore, and also because of the other information presented above, I am inclined to the opinion that the holotype of _R. tumida_ and the paratype of _R. parvula_ have been switched; each now is associated with the name and data, at least for locality, of the other.  Other opinions are that _Rhogeëssa_ from the Tres Marias Islands average smaller than _Rhogeëssa_ of the adjoining mainland of western Mexico but not enough smaller to warrant subspecific separation of the two. Specimens from places geographically intermediate between the geographic ranges, as now known, of _R. parvula_ and _R. tumida_ probably will reveal intergradation between the two kinds, which, therefore, should stand as subspecies of a single species.  As understood now, the Mexican _Rhogeëssa_ are as follows:       =Rhogeëssa parvula parvula= H. Allen       1866. _Rhogeëssa parvula_ H. Allen, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.
