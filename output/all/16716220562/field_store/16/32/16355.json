No specimen was taken.  =_Peromyscus maniculatus rufinus_= (Merriam).--The 36 specimens of the Deer Mouse (59921-59956) are from seven localities (3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, and 15). The mice vary considerably in color; most of them are like mice of the highlands of Colorado and unlike the paler mice inhabiting the lower areas immediately to the west of the Grand Mesa. Young individuals trapped on June 20, 21, and 22 and judged to range from a month through two months in age, and females containing embryos, attest to a somewhat protracted breeding season on the Grand Mesa.  =_Neotoma cinerea arizonae_= Merriam.--Two immature Bushy-tailed Wood Rats (60000-60001) were obtained at locality 3 on July 3.  =_Clethrionomys gapperi galei_= (Merriam).--The 22 specimens (60005-60025, 70133) of Gapper's Red-backed Vole were taken at localities 6, 7, and 10, and are clearly referable to _C. g. galei_, rather than to _Clethrionomys gapperi gauti_ to the south, on the basis of generally dark dorsal pelage, indistinctly bordered broad dorsal stripe, and cranial features. _C. g. gauti_ was described by Cockrum and Fitch (1952, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:289) on the basis of 14 specimens from southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Twenty-one additional specimens from five miles south and one mile west of Cucharas Camps, Huerfano County, were obtained from the seventh to the fourteenth of July by the field party led by Tordoff after the party left the Grand Mesa. These specimens substantiate the subspecific distinctness of _C. g. gauti_ in that they agree in external and in cranial appearance with the description of typical _C. g. gauti_, and are distinct in appearance from specimens of _C. g. galei_ from the Grand Mesa and from other localities in northern Colorado. The six specimens from two localities in Colorado available to Cockrum and Fitch exhibited evidence of intergradation at one locality, and atypical smallness at the other locality. A specimen (70134) taken on June 26, 1956, by Phillip M. Youngman on the Black Mesa, nine miles WNW of Sapinero, 9500 ft., Gunnison County, Colorado, is almost identical in color to the two specimens from Saguache County regarded by Cockrum and Fitch as intergrades between _C. g. galei_ and _C. g. gauti_, but in small size of auditory bullae and narrowness of braincase resembles _C. g. galei_, to which it seems best referred. The specimens from the Grand Mesa extend the known range of _C. g. galei_ approximately 50 miles westward in central Colorado from Gothic. Three females were pregnant; two trapped on June 17 and June 25 contained 6 embryos each, and one trapped on June 25 contained 5 embryos. Four of the females taken in Huerfano County were pregnant; one contained 3 embryos, two contained 5 embryos, and one contained 7 embryos. Immature individuals are present in the sample from Huerfano County also.  =_Phenacomys intermedius intermedius_= Merriam.--Three Heather Voles (60048, 60049, 70135) were trapped at localities 6, 7, and 10. All were adult females; one, taken on June 25 at locality 6, contained seven embryos five millimeters in length, and one, taken on July 2 at locality 7, contained seven embryos nine millimeters in length. These specimens extend the known range of the species approximately 55 miles west from Gothic (Pruitt, Jour. Mamm., 35:450, 1954).  =_Microtus longicaudus mordax_= (Merriam).--Ten Long-tailed Voles (60070-60079) represent localities 3, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15.  =_Microtus montanus fusus_= Hall.--Ten Montane Voles (60060-60068, 70145) represent localities 3, 6, 7, and 15.  =_Ondatra zibethicus osoyoosensis_= (Lord).--Muskrats were seen daily from June 17 to June 23 in a lake at locality 13. No specimen was obtained.  =_Zapus princeps princeps_= J. A. Allen.--Nineteen Western Jumping Mice (60109-60126, 60137) were trapped at localities 6, 10, 12, 14, and 15.  =_Erethizon dorsatum epixanthum_= Brandt.--A Porcupine skull was seen in the nest of a wood rat by John M. Legler at locality 3 on July 2. On June 20 a porcupine was seen at locality 12. No specimen was obtained.  =_Mustela frenata nevadensis_= Hall.--Seven Long-tailed Weasels (60138-60143, 70152) were taken at localities 1, 4, 7, 8, 13, and 14. Four are males and three are females. Some of these were attracted by \"squeaking\" noises and then shot.  =_Taxidea taxus taxus_= (Schreber).--One adult male Badger (60144) was found dead; the skull and baculum were saved. The subspecific identification is on geographic grounds, and is tentative. In this area _T. t. taxus_ and _T. t. fippsi_ may intergrade.  =_Mephitis mephitis estor_= Merriam.--One Striped Skunk (60145) of unknown sex was found dead in the cellar of a cabin at locality 10.  =_Odocoileus hemionus hemionus_= (Rafinesque).--Mule Deer were observed at locality 15; no specimen was obtained.   DISCUSSION  The species here reported from the Grand Mesa may be placed according to their geographic ranges and their restriction to certain habitats in two groups:  BOREAL.--Each of the 12 species listed below is of northern distribution, is dependent, at the latitude of Colorado, upon the habitat provided by areas of high altitudes, and is near its southern zonal limit on the Grand Mesa. The 12 species are: _Sorex cinereus_, _Sorex palustris_, _Sorex vagrans_, _Ochotona princeps_, _Lepus americanus_, _Marmota flaviventris_, _Spermophilus lateralis_, _Clethrionomys gapperi_, _Phenacomys intermedius_, _Microtus longicaudus_, _Microtus montanus_, and _Zapus princeps_. _Thomomys talpoides_ may be considered in this category also, although it is less restricted in range and habitat than most of the other species listed as boreal. These thirteen species make up almost half of the twenty-seven species known from the Grand Mesa.  WIDE-SPREAD.--Species in this category are those that are widely distributed in the western United States and that occur in Colorado in both the mountains and the lower more arid intermontane areas. Some of these species are differentiated into subspecies, one of which inhabits the mountains and another the lowlands. Wide-spread species that do not have subspecies in the lowlands different than the subspecies in the mountains or that are represented by too little material from the Grand Mesa to be evaluated critically are _Myotis evotis_, _Myotis volans_, _Spermophilus variegatus_, _Eutamias quadrivittatus_, _Castor canadensis_, _Ondatra zibethicus_, _Erethizon dorsatum_, _Mustela frenata_, _Taxidea taxus_, _Mephitis mephitis_, and _Odocoileus hemionus_. Three other wide-spread species are differentiated into lowland and highland subspecies; two of these species, _Eutamias minimus_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are represented on the Grand Mesa by the darker subspecies of the mountains. The third species, _Neotoma cinerea_, is represented by two individuals from below the actual rim of the mesa; they are intergrades between the lowland and highland subspecies.  Species of southern distribution, that are dependent at the latitude of Colorado upon the habitat provided by areas of lower altitudes, and that are here in Colorado near their northern limit comprise a third category that is not represented in the list of mammals from the Grand Mesa although such characteristic species as _Ammospermophilus leucurus_, _Perognathus apache_, and _Dipodomys ordii_ occur as near as Grand Junction.  Approximately 55 per cent of the species of the mammalian fauna are boreal; no species of Sonoran affinities finds haven on the Grand Mesa.

BY LESTER DEL REY                           ILLUSTRATED BY EBERLE        Eighteen men and two women in the closed world of a space      ship for five months can only spell tension and trouble--but      in this case, the atmosphere was _literally_ poisoned.                               [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *     Five months out from Earth, we were half-way to Saturn and three-quarters of the way to murder. At least, I was. I was sick of the feuding, the worries and the pettiness of the other nineteen aboard. My stomach heaved at the bad food, the eternal smell of people, and the constant sound of nagging and complaints. For ten lead pennies, I'd have gotten out into space and tried walking back to Earth. Sometimes I thought about doing it without the pennies.  But I knew I wasn't that tough, in spite of what I looked. I'd been built to play fullback, and my questionable brunet beauty had been roughed up by the explosion years before as thoroughly as dock fighting on all the planets could have done. But sometimes I figured all that meant was that there was more of me to hurt, and that I'd had more experience screaming when the anodyne ran out.  Anyhow, whole-wheat pancakes made with sourdough for the ninth \"morning\" running was too damned much! I felt my stomach heave over again, took one whiff of the imitation maple syrup, and shoved the mess back fast while I got up faster.         *       *       *       *       *  It was a mistake. Phil Riggs, our scrawny, half-pint meteorologist, grinned nastily and reached for the plate. \"'Smatter, Paul? Don't you like your breakfast? It's good for you--whole wheat contains bran. The staff of life. Man, after that diet of bleached paste....\"         *       *       *       *       *  There's one guy like that in every bunch. The cook was mad at us for griping about his coffee, so our group of scientists on this cockeyed Saturn Expedition were getting whole wheat flour as punishment, while Captain Muller probably sat in his cabin chuckling about it. In our agreement, there was a clause that we could go over Muller's head on such things with a unanimous petition--but Riggs had spiked that. The idiot liked bran in his flour, even for pancakes!  Or else he was putting on a good act for the fun of watching the rest of us suffer.  \"You can take your damned whole wheat and stuff it--\" I started. Then I shrugged and dropped it. There were enough feuds going on aboard the cranky old _Wahoo_! \"Seen Jenny this morning, Phil?\"  He studied me insolently. \"She told Doc Napier she had some stuff growing in hydroponics she wanted to look at. You're wasting your time on that babe, boy!\"  \"Thanks for nothing,\" I muttered at him, and got out before I really decided on murder. Jenny Sanderson was our expedition biologist. A natural golden blonde, just chin-high on me, and cute enough to earn her way through a Ph. D. doing modelling. She had a laugh that would melt a brass statue and which she used too much on Doc Napier, on our chief, and even on grumpy old Captain Muller--but sometimes she used it on me, when she wanted something. And I never did have much use for a girl who was the strong independent type where there was a man to do the dirty work, so that was okay.  I suppose it was natural, with only two women among eighteen men for month after month, but right then I probably liked Doc Napier less than the captain, even. I pulled myself away from the corridor to hydroponics, started for observation, and then went on into the cubbyhole they gave me for a cabin. On the _Wahoo_, all a man could do was sleep or sit around and think about murder.  Well, I had nobody to blame but myself. I'd asked for the job when I first heard Dr. Pietro had collected funds and priorities for a trip to study Saturn's rings at close hand. And because I'd done some technical work for him on the Moon, he figured he might as well take me as any other good all-around mechanic and technician. He hadn't asked me, though--that had been my own stupid idea.  Paul Tremaine, self-cure expert! I'd picked up a nice phobia against space when the super-liner _Lauri Ellu_ cracked up with four hundred passengers on my first watch as second engineer. I'd gotten free and into a suit, but after they rescued me, it had taken two years on the Moon before I could get up nerve for the shuttle back to Earth. And after eight years home, I should have let well enough alone. If I'd known anything about Pietro's expedition, I'd have wrapped myself in my phobia and loved it.  But I didn't know then that he'd done well with priorities and only fair with funds. The best he could afford was the rental of the old Earth-Mars-Venus triangle freighter. Naturally, when the _Wahoo's_ crew heard they were slated for what would be at least three years off Earth without fancy bonus rates, they quit. Since nobody else would sign on, Pietro had used his priorities to get an injunction that forced them back aboard. He'd stuffed extra oxygen, water, food and fertilizer on top of her regular supplies, then, filled her holds with some top level fuel he'd gotten from a government assist, and set out. And by the time I found out about it, my own contract was iron-bound, and I was stuck.  As an astrophysicist, Pietro was probably tops. As a man to run the Lunar Observatory, he was a fine executive. But as a man to head up an expedition into deep space, somebody should have given him back his teething ring.  Not that the _Wahoo_ couldn't make the trip with the new fuel; she'd been one of the early survey ships before they turned her into a freighter. But she was meant for a crew of maybe six, on trips of a couple of months. There were no game rooms, no lounges, no bar or library--nothing but what had to be. The only thing left for most of us aboard was to develop our hatreds of the petty faults of the others. Even with a homogeneous and willing crew, it was a perfect set-up for cabin fever, and we were as heterogeneous as they came.  Naturally the crew hated the science boys after being impressed into duty, and also took it out on the officers. The officers felt the same about both other groups. And the scientists hated the officers and crew for all the inconveniences of the old _Wahoo_. Me? I was in no-man's land--technically in the science group, but without a pure science degree; I had an officer's feelings left over from graduating as an engineer on the ships; and I looked like a crewman.  It cured my phobia, all right. After the first month out, I was too disgusted to go into a fear funk. But I found out it didn't help a bit to like space again and know I'd stay washed up as a spaceman.         *       *       *       *       *  We'd been jinxed from the start. Two months out, the whole crew of scientists came down with something Doc Napier finally diagnosed as food poisoning; maybe he was right, since our group ate in our own mess hall, and the crew and officers who didn't eat with us didn't get it. Our astronomer, Bill Sanderson, almost died. I'd been lucky, but then I never did react to things much. There were a lot of other small troubles, but the next major trick had been fumes from the nuclear generators getting up into our quarters--it was always our group that had the trouble. If Eve Nolan hadn't been puttering with some of her trick films at the time--she and Walt Harris had the so-called night shift--and seen them blacken, we'd have been dead before they discovered it. And it took us two weeks of bunking with the sullen crew and decontamination before we could pick up life again. Engineer Wilcox had been decent about helping with it, blaming himself. But it had been a mess.  Naturally, there were dark hints that someone was trying to get us; but I couldn't see any crewman wiping us out just to return to Earth, where our contract, with its completion clause, would mean he wouldn't have a dime coming to him. Anyhow, the way things were going, we'd all go berserk before we reached Saturn.  The lunch gong sounded, but I let it ring. Bullard would be serving us whole wheat biscuits and soup made out of beans he'd let soak until they turned sour. I couldn't take any more of that junk, the way I felt then. I heard some of the men going down the corridor, followed by a confused rumble of voices. Then somebody let out a yell. \"Hey, _rooob_!\"  That meant something. The old yell spacemen had picked up from carney people to rally their kind around against the foe. And I had a good idea of who was the foe. I heard the yell bounce down the passage again, and the slam of answering feet.  Then the gravity field went off. Or rather, was cut off. We may have missed the boat in getting anti-gravity, if there is such a thing, but our artificial gravity is darned near foolproof.  It was ten years since I'd moved in free fall, but Space Tech had done a good job of training good habits. I got out of my bunk, hit the corridor with a hand out, bounced, kicked, and dove toward the mess hall without a falter. The crewmen weren't doing so well--but they were coming up the corridor fast enough.  I could have wrung Muller's neck. Normally, in case of trouble, cutting gravity is smart. But not here, where the crew already wanted a chance to commit mayhem, and had more experience than the scientists.  Yet, surprisingly, when I hit the mess hall ten feet ahead of the deckhands, most of the scientists were doing all right. Hell, I should have known Pietro, Sanderson and a couple others would be used to no-grav; in astronomical work, you cut your eye teeth on that. They were braced around the cook, who huddled back in a corner, while our purser-steward, Sam, was still"]]]
