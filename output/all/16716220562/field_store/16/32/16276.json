SMITH   The tadpoles of this species have been described by Bragg (Copeia, 1936: 14-20, figs. 1-13; Amer. Midl. Nat., 18:273-284, figs. 1-5, 1937). The drawings and descriptions of the mouthparts, however, appear to have been taken from dried, or immature, or transforming individuals, for they do not agree among themselves nor do they agree with larvae obtained in the field and now in the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas.  At hand are two series of tadpoles of this species; one series was collected July 2, 1938, 1.5 miles east of Meade County State Park, Kansas, and the other lacks data. The second lot contains numerous sizes of tadpoles from 14 mm. to 31 mm., and several transforming specimens which clearly possess the pattern so typical of this species.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Mouthparts of a tadpole of _Bufo cognatus_. Disk widely spread. Approximately ï¾— 45.]  Mouthparts in both series (consisting all told of about 200 specimens) are fairly constant except in the transforming and extremely young specimens. The accompanying figure shows them as seen with the mouth disk widely spread. The indentations at the corners of the mouth in the papillary fringe are more prominent when the mouthparts are less extended. The outer row of teeth of the lower labium is sometimes a little shorter or longer than the figure shows, but the average is about as indicated. The extent of the medial edge of the papillae on the lower labium varies somewhat; in some, the papillae barely reach the level of the ends of the outer row of teeth, while in others they overlap the ends slightly.  Measurements agree with those given by Bragg, except that appearance of the hind legs occurs at about 15 mm.; the fore legs appear at about 28 mm. A pattern recognizably similar to that of the adult is evident at about 20 mm.  These tadpoles show such a striking similarity to those referred by Wright to _Bufo compactilis_ Wiegmann (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 74:4, pl. 5, fig. 6, 1929) that their conspecificity is suggested. If on the other hand, the specimen figured by Wright is properly identified, then the two species must in reality be very closely related. A direct comparison of positively identified tadpoles of each species is much to be desired.   21-2764"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31020"],["title","A New Subspecies of Pocket Mouse from Kansas (#0)"],["body","OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY  Volume 7, No. 11, pp. 587-590  November 15, 1954   A New Subspecies of Pocket Mouse from Kansas  BY E. RAYMOND HALL   UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE 1954     UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS, MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY  Editors: E. Raymond Hall, Chairman, A. Byron Leonard, Robert W. Wilson   Volume 7, No. 11, pp. 587-590 Published November 15, 1954   UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS Lawrence, Kansas   PRINTED BY FERD VOILAND, JR., STATE PRINTER TOPEKA, KANSAS 1954  25-5678     A New Subspecies of Pocket Mouse from Kansas  by  E. Raymond Hall   When preparing distribution maps for a revised list of the Mammals of Kansas it became apparent to me that pocket mice of the species _Perognathus flavescens_ from south-central Kansas and adjoining parts of Oklahoma were without a subspecific name. The new subspecies is named and described below.   =Perognathus flavescens cockrumi= new subspecies       _Holotype._--Female, subadult (P4 moderately worn), skin      with skull, No. 13045, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 4-1/2      mi. NE Danville, Harper Co., Kansas; December 1, 1939;      obtained by Sam Tihen; original No. 99 of J. A. Tihen.       _Range._--South-central Kansas south at least into Dewey      County, Oklahoma.       _Diagnosis._--Size small; upper parts Ochraceous-Buff      (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and      Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912) heavily      suffused with black; postauricular patches and a band 8 mm      wide on each side Ochraceous-Buff; subauricular spot,      underparts, and forefeet white; hind feet slightly dusky;      tail brownish above and white below. Skull small; tympanic      bullae small; rostrum wide; skull indistinguishable from      that of _P. f. flavescens_ from the same latitude in western      Kansas.       _Comparisons._--_Perognathus flavescens cockrumi_ averages      approximately 12 per cent smaller in linear measurements      than the more northern _Perognathus flavescens perniger_      Osgood (from Knox, Stanton and Cumming counties, Nebraska)      but color of upper parts is essentially the same. From the      more western _Perognathus flavescens flavescens_ Merriam      (from Seward, Hamilton and Morton counties, Kansas),      _cockrumi_ differs in being darker in all parts of the      pelage except on the underparts which are white in both      subspecies; the parts of the hairs that are Ochraceous-Buff      in _cockrumi_ are Light Ochraceous-Buff in _flavescens_; the      back of _cockrumi_ is blackish instead of yellowish. From      the more southern _Perognathus flavescens copei_ Rhoads      (topotypes examined but not at hand as I write), _cockrumi_      differs in duller more blackish (less bright and less      reddish) upper parts. From _Perognathus merriami gilvus_, of      more southern distribution, the new subspecies differs in      much smaller tympanic bullae and wider rostrum.       _Measurements._--The type, a male (35331/47596 U.S.B.S.,      from Cairo, Kansas, showing some wear on P4), and another      male (60165 K. U., from Barber Co., Kansas, showing much      wear on P4) measure, respectively: Total length, 114, 120,      124; tail, 51, 55, 58; hind foot, 17, 17, 18; occipitonasal      length, ----, 21.0, 21.6; condylobasal length (condyles to      anterior end of premaxillae), 18.5, 18.6, 19.3; frontonasal      length, ----, 14.1, 14.3; mastoidal breadth, 10.5, 11.2,      11.2; length of bulla, 6.8, 7.1, 6.8; interorbital breadth,      4.7, 4.8, 5.1; alveolar length of upper molariform      tooth-row, 3.1, 3.1, 3.0; interparietal breadth, 4.3. 4.6,      4.7.  _Remarks._--The subspecific name _cockrumi_ is proposed in recognition of Dr. E. Lendell Cockrum's important contribution to our knowledge of the mammals of Kansas. Dr. W. Frank Blair recently suggested to me that the two specimens examined by him from Kansas (the one from Ellsworth County and the one here designated as holotype) should not be referred to _Perognathus flavescens copei_ Rhoads, as Cockrum (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 7:146, August 25, 1952) had done, because _copei_ is paler, instead of darker, than _P. f. flavescens_. It was Dr. Blair's suggestion which lead me to realize that the subspecies in south-central Kansas lacked a name.  Through the courtesy of Miss Viola S. Schantz I have examined three of the four specimens from Cairo, Kansas, that Osgood (N. Amer. Fauna, 18:21, September 20, 1900) referred to _Perognathus flavescens_ before any subspecies of that species had been recognized. The specimens from Cairo are intermediate in color, as they are also in geographic position, between _P. f. flavescens_ from western Kansas and _P. f. cockrumi_ from south-central Kansas but show more resemblance to the latter and therefore are referred to _P. f. cockrumi_. The specimens, excepting the three from Cairo, are in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 10 distributed as follows:       _=Kansas:=_ ELLSWORTH CO.: 1-1/2 mi.
