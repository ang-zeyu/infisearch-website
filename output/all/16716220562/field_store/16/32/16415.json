As Machiavelli, as the eulogist of the Medicis, simply emphasized their moral nudity, so Bernhardi has shown the world the inner significance of this crude revival of CÃ¦sarism.     CHAPTER II  THE RECORD IN THE CASE   All morally sane men in this twentieth century are agreed that war abstractly is an evil thing,--perhaps the greatest of all indecencies,--and that while it may be one of the offenses which must come, \"woe to that man (or nation) by whom the offense cometh!\"  They are of one mind in regarding this present war as a great crime--perhaps the greatest crime--against civilization, and the only questions which invite discussion are:      Which of the two contending groups of Powers is morally     responsible?      Was Austria justified in declaring war against Servia?      Was Germany justified in declaring war against Russia and     France?      Was Germany justified in declaring war against Belgium?      Was England justified in declaring war against Germany?  Primarily and perhaps exclusively these ethical questions turn upon the issues developed by the communications which passed between the various chancelleries of Europe in the last week of July, for it is the amazing feature of this greatest of wars that it was precipitated by the ruling classes and, assuming that all the diplomats sincerely desired a peaceful solution of the questions raised by the Austrian ultimatum (which is by no means clear) the war is the result of ineffective diplomacy.  I quite appreciate the distinction between the immediate causes of a war and the anterior or underlying causes. The fundamental cause of the Franco-German War of 1870 was not the incident at Ems nor even the question of the Spanish succession. These were but the precipitating pretexts or, as a lawyer would express it, the \"proximate causes.\" The underlying cause was unquestionably the rivalry between Prussia and France for political supremacy in Europe.  Behind the Austrian ultimatum to Servia were also great questions of State policy, not easily determinable upon any tangible ethical principle, and which involved the hegemony of Europe. Germany's domination of Europe had been established when by the rattling of its saber it compelled Russia in 1908 to permit Austria to disturb the then existing status in the Balkans by the forcible annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and behind the Austrian-Servian question of 1914, arising out of the murder of the Crown Prince of Austria at Serajevo, was the determination of Germany and Austria to reassert that dominant position by compelling Russia to submit to a further humiliation of a Slav State.  The present problem is to inquire how far Germany and her ally selected a just pretext to test this question of mastery.  The pretext was the work of diplomatists. It was not the case of a nation rising upon some great cause which appealed to popular imagination. The acts of the statesmen in that last fateful week of July, 1914, were not the mere echo of the popular will.  The issues were framed by the statesmen and diplomats of Europe and whatever efforts were made to preserve the peace and whatever obstructive tactics were interposed were not the acts of any of the nations now in arms but those of a small coterie of men who, in the secrecy of their respective cabinets, made their moves and countermoves upon the chessboard of nations.  The future of Europe in that last week of July was in the hands of a small group of men, numbering not over fifty, and what they did was never known to their respective nations in any detail until after the fell Rubicon had been crossed and a world war had been precipitated.  If all of these men had sincerely desired to work for peace, there would not have been any war.  So swiftly did events move that the masses of the people had time neither to think nor to act. The suddenness of the crisis marks it as a species of \"mid-summer madness,\" a very \"witches' sabbath\" of diplomatic demagoguery.  In a peaceful summer, when the nations now struggling to exterminate each other were fraternizing in the holiday centers of Europe, an issue was suddenly precipitated, made the subject of communications between the various chancelleries, and almost in the twinkling of an eye Europe found itself wrapped in a universal flame. The appalling toll of death suggests the inquiry of Hamlet: \"Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with 'em?\" and if the diplomatic \"loggats\" of 1914 were ineffectively played, some one must accept the responsibility for such failure.  This sense of responsibility against the dread Day of Accounting has resulted in a disposition beyond past experience to justify the quarrel by placing before the world the diplomatic record.  The English Government commenced shortly after the outbreak of hostilities by publishing the so-called _White Paper_, consisting of a statement by the British Government and 160 diplomatic documents as an appendix. This was preceded by Sir Edward Grey's masterly speech in Parliament. That speech and all his actions in this fateful crisis may rank him in future history with the younger Pitt.  On August 4th, the German Chancellor for the first time explained to the representatives of his nation assembled in the Reichstag the causes of the war, then already commenced, and there was distributed among the members a statement of the German Foreign Office, accompanied by 27 Exhibits in the form of diplomatic communications, which have been erroneously called the German _White Paper_ and which sets forth Germany's defense to the world.  Shortly thereafter Russia, casting aside all the traditional secrecy of Muscovite diplomacy, submitted to a candid world its acts and deeds in the form of the so-called Russian _Orange Paper_, with 79 appended documents, and this was followed later by the publication by Belgium of the so-called Belgian _Gray Paper_.  Late in November France published its _Yellow Book_, the most comprehensive of these diplomatic records. Of the two groups of powers, therefore, only Austria and Italy have failed to disclose their diplomatic correspondence to the scrutiny of the world.  The former, as the originator of the controversy, should give as a matter of \"decent respect to the opinions of mankind\" its justification, if any, for what it did. So far, it has only given its ultimatum to Servia and Servia's reply.  Italy, as a nation that has elected to remain neutral, is not under the same moral obligation to disclose the secrets of its Foreign Office, and while it remains on friendly terms with all the Powers it probably feels some delicacy in disclosing confidential communications, but as the whole world is vitally interested in determining the justice of the quarrel and as it is wholly probable that the archives of the Italian Foreign Office would throw an illuminating searchlight upon the moral issues involved, Italy, in a spirit of loyalty to civilization, should without further delay disclose the documentary evidence in its possession.  While it is to be regretted that the full diplomatic record is not made up, yet as we have the most substantial part of the record in the communications which passed in those fateful days between Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, and London, there is sufficient before the court to justify a judgment, especially as there is reason to believe that the documents as yet withheld would only confirm the conclusions which the record already given to the world irresistibly suggests.  Thus we can reasonably assume that the Italian documentary evidence would fairly justify the conclusion that the war was on the part of Germany and Austria a war of aggression, for Italy, by its refusal to act with its associates of the Triple Alliance, has in the most significant manner thus adjudged it.  Under the terms of the Triple Alliance, Italy had obligated itself to support Germany and Austria in any purely _defensive_ war, and if therefore the communications, which undoubtedly passed between Vienna and Berlin on the one hand, and Rome on the other, justified the conclusion that Germany and Austria had been assailed by Russia, England, and France or either of them, then we must assume that Italy would have respected its obligation, especially as it would thus relieve Italy from any possible charge of treachery to two allies, whose support and protection it had enjoyed from the time that the Triple Alliance was first made.  When Italy decided that it was under no obligation to support its allies, it effectually affirmed the fact that they had commenced a war of aggression, and until the contrary is shown, we must therefore assume that the archives of the Foreign Office at Rome would merely confirm the conclusions hereinafter set forth as to the moral responsibility for the war.  Similarly upon considerations that are familiar to all who have had any experience in the judicial investigation of truth, it must be assumed that if Austria had in its secret archives any documentary evidence that would justify it in its pretension that it had been unjustly assailed by one or more of the Powers with which it is now at war, it would have published such documents to the world in its own exculpation. The moral responsibility for this war is too great for any nation to accept it unnecessarily. Least of all could Austria--which on the face of the record commenced the controversy by its ultimatum to Servia--leave anything undone to acquit itself at the bar of public opinion of any responsibility for the great crime that is now drenching Europe with blood. The time is past when any nation can ignore the opinions of mankind or needlessly outrage its conscience. Germany has recognized this in publishing its defense and exhibiting a part of its documentary proof, and if its ally, Austria, continues to withhold from the knowledge of the world the documents in its possession, there can be but one conclusion as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31457"],["title","The Evidence in the Case (#7)"],["body"," its guilt.  Upon the record thus made up in the Supreme Court of Civilization, that tribunal need no more hesitate to proceed to judgment than would an ordinary court hesitate to enter a decree because one of the litigants has deliberately suppressed documents known to be in its possession. It does not lie in the mouth of such a litigant to ask the court to suspend judgment or withhold its sentence until the full record is made up, when the incompleteness of that record is due to its own deliberate suppression of vital documentary proofs.     CHAPTER III  THE SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE   The official defenses of England, Russia, France, and Belgium do not apparently show any failure on the part of either to submit any essential diplomatic document in their possession. They have respectively made certain contentions as to the proposals that they made to maintain the peace of the world, and in every instance have supported these contentions by putting into evidence the letters and communications in which such proposals were expressed.  When the German _White Paper_ is examined it discloses on its very face the suppression of documents of vital importance. The fact that communications passed between Berlin and Vienna, the text of which has never been disclosed, is not a matter of conjecture. Germany asserts as part of its defense that it faithfully exercised its mediatory influence on Austria, but not only is such influence not disclosed by any practical results, such as we would expect in view of her dominating relations with Austria, but the _text_ of these vital communications is still kept in the secret archives of Berlin and Vienna. Germany has carefully selected a part of her diplomatic records for publication but withheld others. Austria has withheld all.  Thus in the official apology for Germany it is stated that, in spite of the refusal of Austria to accept the proposition of Sir Edward Grey to treat the Servian reply \"as a basis for further conversations,\"       we [Germany] continued our mediatory efforts to the utmost      and _advised_ Vienna to make any possible compromise      consistent with the dignity of the Monarchy.[3]  [Footnote 3: German _White Paper_.]  This would be more convincing if the German Foreign Office had added the _text_ of the advice which it thus gave Vienna.  A like significant omission will be found when the same official defense states that on July 29th the German Government advised Austria \"to begin the conversations with Mr. Sazonof.\" But here again the _text_ is not found among the documents which the German Foreign Office has given to the world. The communications, which passed between that office and its ambassadors in St. Petersburg, Paris, and London, are given _in extenso_, but among the twenty-seven communications appended to the German _White Paper it is most significant that not a single communication is given of the many which passed from the Foreign Office of Berlin to that of Vienna and only two which passed from the German Ambassador in Vienna to the German Chancellor_. While the Kaiser has favored the world with his messages to the Czar and King George, he has wholly failed to give us any message that he sent in those critical days to the Austrian Emperor or the King of Italy. We shall have occasion to refer hereafter to the frequent failure to produce documents, the existence of which is admitted by the exhibits which Germany appended to its _White Paper_.  This cannot be an accident. The German Foreign Office has seen fit to throw the veil of secrecy over the text of its communications to Vienna, although professing to give the purport of a few of them. The purpose of this suppression is even more clearly indicated by the complete failure of Austria to submit any of its diplomatic records to the scrutiny of a candid world. Until Germany and Austria are willing to put the most important documents in their possession in evidence, they must not be surprised that the World, remembering Bismarck's garbling of the Ems dispatch, which precipitated the Franco-Prussian War, will be incredulous as to the sincerity of their pacific protestations.   ADDENDUM       The Austrian _Red Book_, published more than six months      after the declaration of war, simply emphasizes the policy      of suppression of vital documents, which we have already      discussed. Of its 69 documentary exhibits, _there is not one      which passed directly between the Cabinets of Berlin and      Vienna_. The text of the communications, in which Germany      claims to have exercised a mediatory and conciliatory      influence with its ally, is still withheld. _Not a single      document is produced which was sent between July the 6th and      July the 21st_, the period when the great _coup_ was      secretly planned by Berlin and Vienna.       In the _Red Book_ we find eight communications from Count      Berchtold to the Austrian Ambassador at Berlin and four      replies from that official, but not a letter or telegram      passing between Berchtold and von Bethmann-Hollweg or      between the German and Austrian Kaisers. The Austrian _Red      Book_ gives additional evidence that at the eleventh hour,      and shortly before Germany issued its ultimatum to Russia,      Austria did finally agree to discuss the Servian question      with Russia; but the information, which Germany presumably      gave to its ally of its intention to send the ultimatum      to Russia, is carefully withheld. Notwithstanding this      suppression of vital documents, the diplomatic papers of      Germany and Austria, now _partially_ given to the world,      disclose an unmistakable purpose, amounting to an open      confession, that they intended to force their will upon      Europe, even though this course involved the most stupendous      war in the history of mankind.            March 1, 1915.     CHAPTER IV  GERMANY'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE AUSTRIAN ULTIMATUM   On June 28, 1914, the Austrian Crown Prince was murdered at Serajevo. For nearly a month thereafter there was no public statement by Austria of its intentions, with the exception of a few semi-inspired dispatches to the effect that it would act with the greatest moderation and self-restraint. A careful examination made of the files of two leading American newspapers, each having a separate news service, from June 28, 1914, to July 23, 1914, has failed to disclose a single dispatch from Vienna which gave any intimation as to the drastic action which Austria was about to take.  The French Premier, Viviani, in his speech to the French Senate, and House of Deputies, on August 4, 1914, after referring to the fact that France, Russia, and Great Britain had coÃ¶perated in advising Servia to make any reasonable concession to Austria, added:       This advice was all the more valuable in view of the fact      that Austria-Hungary's demands had been inadequately      foreshadowed to the governments of the Triple Entente, _to      whom during the three preceding weeks the Austro-Hungarian      Government had repeatedly given assurance that its demands      would be extremely moderate_.  The movements of the leading statesmen and rulers of the Triple Entente clearly show that they, as well as the rest of the world, had been lulled into false security either by the silence of Austria, or, as Viviani avers, by its deliberate suggestion that its treatment of the Serajevo incident would be conciliatory, pacific, and moderate.  Thus, on July 20th, the Russian Ambassador, obviously anticipating no crisis, left Vienna on a fortnight's leave of absence. The President of the French Republic and its Premier were far distant from Paris. Pachitch, the Servian Premier, was absent from Belgrade, when the ultimatum was issued.  The testimony of the British Ambassador to Vienna is to the same effect. He reports to Sir Edward Grey:       The delivery at Belgrade on the 23d of July of the note to      Servia was preceded by a period of _absolute silence_ at the      Ballplatz.  He proceeds to say that with the exception of the German Ambassador at Vienna (note the significance of the exception) not a single member of the Diplomatic Corps knew anything of the Austrian ultimatum and that the French Ambassador, when he visited the Austrian Foreign Office on July 23d (the day of its issuance), was not only kept in ignorance that the ultimatum had actually been issued, but was given the impression that its tone would be moderate. Even the Italian Ambassador was not taken into Count Berchtold's confidence.[4]  [Footnote 4: Dispatch from Sir M. de Bunsen to Sir Edward Grey, dated September 1, 1914.]  The Servian Government had formally disclaimed any responsibility for the assassination and had pledged itself to punish any Servian citizen implicated therein. No word came from Vienna excepting the semi-official intimations as to its moderate and conciliatory course, and after the funeral of the Archduke, the world, then enjoying its summer holiday, had almost forgotten the Serajevo incident. The whole tragic occurrence simply survived in the sympathy which all felt with Austria in its new trouble, and especially with its aged monarch, who, like King Lear, was \"as full of grief as age, wretched in both.\" Never was it even hinted that Germany and Austria were about to apply in a time of peace a match to the powder magazine of Europe.  Can it be questioned that loyalty to the highest interests of civilization required that Germany and Austria, when they determined to make the murder of the Archduke by an irresponsible assassin the pretext for bringing up for final decision the long-standing troubles between Austria and Servia, should have given all the European nations some intimation of their intention, so that their _confrÃ¨res_ in the family of nations could coÃ¶perate to adjust this trouble, as they had adjusted far more difficult questions after the close of the Balko-Turkish War?
