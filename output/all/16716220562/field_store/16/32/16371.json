We have but to recall the recollection of the earliest conflicts which the colonist had with the British, in order to see the negro occupying a place in the ranks of the patriot army. Their white fellow-citizens were only too glad to take ground to the left, in order that they could fall in on their colors. And they did good service whenever they fought, as the record shows.  The Committee of safety upon reviewing the situation and the army, before the first great battle of the Revolution had been fought, adopted the following resolution:       \"_Resolved_, That it is the opinion of this committee, that      as the contest now between Great Britain and the Colonies      respects the liberties and privileges of the latter, which      the Colonies are determined to maintain, that the admission      of any persons, as soldiers, into the army now raising, but      such as are Freeman, will be inconsistent with the      principals that are supported, and reflect dishonor on this      Colony; and that no Slaves be admitted into this army upon      any consideration whatever.\"  The exception was well taken, and this act of the Committee, excluding slaves from the army, placed the rebels upon the basis of patriots, fighting for freedom. This, however, did not detract from those who had already distinguished themselves, by their bravery at Bunker Hill a few weeks previous, where Peter Salem, once a slave, fought side by side in the ranks with the white soldiers. When the British Major Pitcairn mounted the redoubt, upon that memorable occasion, shouting, \"The day is ours!\" Peter Salem poured the contents of his gun into that officer's body, killing him instantly, and checking, temporarily, the advance of the British. Swett, in his \"Sketches of Bunker Hill Battle,\" says:       \"Major Pitcairn caused the first effusion of blood at      Lexington. In that battle, his horse was shot under him,      while he was separated from his troops. With presence of      mind he feigned himself slain; his pistols were taken from      his holsters, and he was left for dead, when he seized the      opportunity and escaped. He appeared at Bunker Hill, and,      says the historian, 'Among those who mounted the works was      the gallant Major Pitcairn, who exultingly cried out, 'The      day is ours!' when a black soldier, named Salem, shot him      through and he fell. His agonized son received him in his      arms, and tenderly bore him to the boats.' A contribution      was made in the army for the colored soldier, and he was      presented to Washington as having performed this feat.\"  Mr. Aaron White, of Thompson, Conn., in a letter to George Livermore, Esq., of the Massachusetts Historical Society, writes:       \"With regard to the black Hero of Bunker Hill, I never knew      him personally, nor did I ever hear from his lips the story      of his achievements; but I have better authority. About the      year 1809, I heard a soldier of the Revolution, who was      present at the Bunker Hill Battle, relate to my father the      story of the death of Major Pitcairn. He said the Major had      passed the storm of fire without, and had mounted the      redoubt, when, waving his sword, he commanded, in a loud      voice, the 'rebels' to surrender. His sudden appearance, and      his commanding air, at first startled the men immediately      before him. They neither answered nor fired; probably not      being exactly certain what was next to be done. At this      critical moment, a negro soldier stepped forward, and,      aiming his musket directly at the Major's bosom, blew him      through. My informant declared that he was so near, that he      distinctly saw the act. The story made quite an impression      on my mind. I have frequently heard my father relate the      story, and have no doubt of its truth. My father on the day      of the battle was a mere child, and witnessed the battle and      burning of Charlestown from Roxbury Hill, sitting on the      shoulders of the Rev. Mr. Jackson, who said to him as he      placed him on the ground, 'Now, boy, do you remember this!'      Consequently, after such an injunction, he would necessarily      pay particular attention to anecdotes concerning the first      and only battle he ever witnessed.\"  [Illustration: BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.  Peter Salem shooting the British Major Pitcairn.]  Salem was undoubtedly one of the chief heroes of that ever memorable battle. Orator, historian, poet, all give this sable patriot credit for having been instrumental in checking the British advance and saving the day.  At the unveiling of the statue erected to the memory of Gen. Joseph Warren, who fell at Bunker Hill, the orator of the occasion, Hon. Edward Everett, said:       \"It is the monument of the day of the event, of the battle      of Bunker Hill; all of the brave men who shared its      perils,--alike of Prescott and Putnam and Warren, the chiefs      of the day, and the colored man, Salem, who, is reported to      have shot the gallant Pitcairn, as he mounted the parapet.      Cold as the clods on which it rests, still as the silent      Heaven to which it soars, it is yet vocal, eloquent, in      their individual praise.\"  The following is a copy of a petition now in the Archive Department of Massachusetts:       \"TO THE HONORABLE GENERAL COURT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS' BAY.       \"The subscribers beg leave to report to your Honorable      House, (which we do in justice to the character of so brave      a man), that under our own observation, we declare that a      negro man named Salem Poor, of Col. Frye's regiment, Capt.      Ame's company, in the late battle at Charleston, behaved      like an experienced officer, as well as an excellent      soldier. To set forth particulars of his conduct would be      tedious. We only beg leave to say, in the person of this      said negro, centers a brave and gallant soldier. The reward      due to so great and distinguished a character, we submit to      Congress.       \"JONA. BREWER, Col.      THOMAS NIXON, Lt. Col.      WM. PRESCOTT, Col.      EPHM. COREY, Lieut.

PEREZ MORTON, Dep'y Sec'y.\"  A biographical account of Peter Salem is given in the following newspaper extract:       \"April, 1882, the town of Framingham voted to place a      memorial stone over the grave of Peter Salem, alias Salem      Middlesex, whose last resting place in the old burial ground      at Framingham Centre has been unmarked for years. For this      purpose $150 was appropriated by the town. The committee in      charge of the matter has placed a neat granite memorial over      his grave, and it bears the following inscription: \"Peter      Salem, a soldier of the revolution, Died Aug. 16, 1816.      Concord, Bunker Hill, Saratoga. Erected by the town, 1882.\"      Peter Salem was the colored man who particularly      distinguished himself in the revolutionary war by shooting      down Major Pitcairn at the battle of Bunker Hill, as he was      mounting a redoubt and shouting, \"The day is ours!\" this      being the time when Pitcairn fell back into the arms of his      son. Peter Salem served faithfully in the war for seven      years in the companies of minute men under the command of      Capt. John Nixon and Capt. Simon Edgell of Framingham, and      came out of it unharmed. He was a slave, and was owned,      originally, by Capt. Jeremiah Belknap of Framingham, being      sold by him to Major Lawson Buckminster of that town, he      becoming a free man when he joined the army. Salem was born      in Framingham, and, in 1783, married Katie Benson, a      Granddaughter of Nero, living for a time near what is now      the State muster field. He removed to Leicester after the      close of the war, his last abode in that town being a cabin      on the road leading from Leicester to Auburn. He was removed      to Framingham, where he had gained a settlement in 1816 and      there he died.\"  Salem was not the only negro at the battle of Bunker Hill. Says an authority:       \"Col. Trumbull in his celebrated historic picture of this      battle, introduces conspicuously the colored patriot. At the      time of the battle, the artist, then acting as adjutant, was      stationed with his regiment at Roxbury, and saw the action      from this point. The picture was painted in 1786 when the      event was fresh in his mind. It is a significant historical      fact, pertinent to our present research, that, among the      limited number of figures introduced on the canvas, more      than one negro soldier can be distinctly seen.\"  Of the others who participated in the battle we have knowledge of Salem Poor, whose bravery won for him favorable comment.  Major Wm. Lawrence, who fought through the war for independence, from Concord, until the peace of 1783, participating in many of the severest battles of the war. Says a memoir:       \"At Bunker Hill, where he was slightly wounded, his coat and      hat were pierced with the balls of the enemy, and were      preserved in the family for several years. At one time he      commanded a company whose rank and file were all negroes, of      whose courage, military discipline, and fidelity, he always      spoke with respect. On one occasion, being out      reconnoitering with his company, he got so far in advance of      his command, that he was surrounded, and on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31339"],["title","The Black Phalanx (#6)"],["body","of      being made prisoner by the enemy. The men, soon discovering      his peril, rushed to his rescue, and fought with the most      determined bravery till that rescue was effectually      secured. He never forgot this circumstance, and ever took      special pains to show kindness and hospitality to any      individual of the colored race, who came near his dwelling.\"  The Committee of Safety having excluded slaves from the army, many were thereafter manumitted, that they might enlist. There was no law regulating enlistment in the army at the time which required the color of a soldier's skin to be recorded or regarded. A prejudice existed in the legislature that prompted that body to begin a series of special enactments, regarding negroes, which did not exclude them altogether from the army, but looked to their organization into exclusive companies, batallions and regiments.  Notwithstanding the record made by the negroes who had swollen the ranks of the American army a few weeks after the battle of Bunker Hill, General Gates, then at Cambridge, issued the following order to the officers, then recruiting for the service:       \"You are not to enlist any deserter from the Ministerial      army, nor any stroller, negro, or vagabond, or persons      suspected of being an enemy to the liberty of America, nor      any under eighteen years of age. As the cause is the best      that can engage men of courage and principle to take up      arms, so it is expected that none but such will be accepted      by the recruiting officer. The pay, provision, &c., being so      ample, it is not doubted but that the officers sent upon      this service will, without delay, complete their respective      corps, and march the men forthwith to camp. You are not to      enlist any person that is not an American born, unless such      person has a wife and family, and is a settled resident in      this country. The persons you enlist must be provided with      good and complete arms.\"  This was in July, and on the 26th of the following September, Edward Rutledge, of South Carolina, moved in the Colonial Congress that all negroes be discharged that were in the army. As might be expected, his proposition was strongly supported by the Southern delegates, but the Northern delegates being so much stronger, voted it down. The negroes were crowding so rapidly into the army, and the Northern colonists finding their Southern comrades so strongly opposing this element of strength, submitted the question of their enlistment to a conference committee in October, composed of such men as Dr. Franklin, Benjamin Harrison and Thomas Lynch, with the Deputy Governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island. This committee met at Cambridge, with a committee of the council of Massachusetts Bay. The object and duty of the meeting was to consider the condition of the army, and to devise means by which it could be improved.  General Washington was present at the meeting, and took part in the discussions. Among others, the following subject was considered and reported upon: \"'Ought not negroes to be excluded from the new enlistment, especially those such as are slaves?' All were thought improper by the council of officers. '_Agreed_, That they may be rejected altogether.'\"  In the organization of the new army, were many officers and men, who had served with negroes in the militia, and who had been re-enlisted in the colonial army. They protested against the exclusion of their old comrades, on account of color. So very strong were their protests that most of the rank and file of the Northern troops regarded the matter as of serious import to the colonies, and of danger to the wives and families of those in the field. There was quite a large number of free negroes in the Northern Colonies at this time, and the patriotism displayed by those who had the opportunity of serving in the militia during the early stages of the war, aroused a feeling which prompted a great many masters to offer to the commander of the army the services of their slaves, and to the slaves their freedom, if their services were accepted. So weighty were the arguments offered, and to soften the gloom which hung about the homes and the camps of the soldiers, Gen. Washington wrote to the President of Congress regarding the matter, from Cambridge, in December, 1775:       \"It has been represented to me that the free negroes who      have served in this army are very much dissatisfied at being      discarded. As it is to be apprehended that they may seek      employment in the Ministerial army, I have presumed to      depart from the resolution respecting them, and have given      license for their being enlisted. If this is disapproved by      Congress, I will put a stop to it.\"[2]  The letter was submitted to Congress, and General Washington's action was sustained by the passage of the following resolution: \"That the free negroes, who had served faithfully in the army at Cambridge, may be re-enlisted therein, but no others.\"  The question of color first entered the army by order of Washington's predecessor, Gen. Artemus Ward, who in his first general order required the \"complexion\" of the soldier to be entered upon the roll. In October, 1775, Gen. Thomas wrote the following letter to John Adams. The general was in every way competent to draw a true picture of the army, and had the opportunity of observation. He says:       \"I am sorry to hear that any prejudices should take place in      any Southern Colony, with respect to the troops raised in      this. I am certain that the insinuations you mention are      injurious, if we consider with what precipitation we are      obliged to collect an army. In the regiments at Roxbury, the      privates are equal to any that I served with in the last      war; very few old men, and in the ranks very few boys. Our      fifes are many of them boys. We have some negroes; but I      look on them, in general, as equally serviceable with other      men for fatigue; and in action many of them have proved      themselves brave. I would avoid all reflection, or anything      that may tend to give umbrage; but there is in this army      from the southward, a number called riflemen, who are the      most indifferent men I ever served with. These privates are      mutinous, and often deserting to the enemy; unwilling for      duty of any kind; exceedingly vicious; and I think the army      here would be as well off without them. But to do justice to      their officers, they are, some of them, likely men.\"  Despite all prejudice, the negro, as in all conflicts since, sought every opportunity to show his patriotism, and his unquenchable thirst for liberty; and no matter in what capacity he entered the service, whether as body-servant, hostler or teamster, he always displayed the same characteristic courage. In November of the same year the Provincial Congress of South Carolina, by the passage of the following resolution, gave permission to her militia officers, to use slaves in the army for certain purposes:       \"On motion, _Resolved_, That the colonels of the several      regiments of militia throughout the Colony have leave to      enroll such a number of able male slaves, to be employed as      pioneers and laborers, as public exegencies may require; and      that a daily pay of seven shillings and six-pence be allowed      for the service of each such slave while actually employed.\"  The foregoing resolution must not in any way be understood as sanctioning the employment of negroes as soldiers, notwithstanding some of the ablest men of the State advocated the enlistment of negroes in the army; the opposition was too strong to carry the measure through either Congress or the legislature. The feeling among the Northern colonists may be shown by citing the views of some of their leading men, and none perhaps was better calculated to give a clear expression of their views, than the Rev. Dr. Hopkins, of Newport, R. I., who wrote a \"Dialogue Concerning the slavery of the Africans,\" published soon after the commencement of hostilities. Here is an extract from a note to the Dialogue:       \"God is so ordering it in his providence, that it seems      absolutely necessary something should speedily be done with      respect to the slaves among us, in order to our safety, and      to prevent their turning against us in our present struggle,      in order to get their liberty. Our oppressors have planned      to gain the blacks, and induce them to take up arms against      us, by promising them liberty on this condition; and this      plan they are prosecuting to the utmost of their power, by      which means they have persuaded numbers to join them. And      should we attempt to restrain them by force and severity,      keeping a strict guard over them, and punishing them      severely who shall be detected in attempting to join our      oppressors, this will only be making bad worse, and serve to      render our inconsistence, oppression, and cruelty more      criminal, perspicuous, and shocking, and bring down the      righteous vengeance of Heaven on our heads. The only way      pointed out to prevent this threatening evil is to set the      blacks at liberty ourselves by some public acts and laws,      and then give them proper encouragement to labor, or take      arms in the defence of the American cause, as they shall      choose. This would at once be doing them some degree of      justice, and defeating our enemies in the scheme that they      are prosecuting.\"  Therefore it will be observed that public opinion regarding the arming of negroes in the North and South, was controlled by sectional interest in the one, and the love of liberty in the other. That both desired America's Independence, no one will doubt, but that one section was more willing than the other to sacrifice slavery for freedom, I think is equally as plain.
