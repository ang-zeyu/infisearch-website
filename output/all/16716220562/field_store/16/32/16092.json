That is all right, you think, but what are we to do when the batteries are not just equal in e. m. f.? (e. m. f. is code for electromotive force). I'll tell you, because the telling includes some other ideas which will be valuable in your later reading.  [Illustration: Fig 13]  Suppose we take batteries which aren't going to be injured by being made to work--storage batteries will do nicely--and connect them in series as in Fig. 13. When batteries are in series they act like a single stronger battery, one whose e. m. f. is the sum of the e. m. f.'s of the separate batteries. Connect these batteries to a long fine wire as in Fig. 14. There is a stream of electrons along this wire. Next connect the negative terminal of the standard cell to the negative terminal of the storage batteries, that is, brace their feet against each other. Then connect a wire to the positive terminal of the standard cell. This wire acts just like a long arm sticking out from the positive plate of this cell.  [Illustration: Fig 14]  Touch the end of the wire, which is _p_ of Fig. 14, to some point as _a_ on the fine wire. Now what do we have? Right at _a_, of course, there are some free electrons and they hear the calls of both batteries. If the standard battery, _S_ of the figure, calls the stronger they go to it. In that case move the end _p_ nearer the positive plate of the battery _B_, so that it will have a chance to exert a stronger pull. Suppose we try at _c_ and find the battery _B_ is there the stronger. Then we can move back to some point, say _b_, where the pulls are equal.  To make a test like this we put a sensitive current-measuring instrument in the wire which leads from the positive terminal of the standard cell. We also use a long fine wire so that there can never be much of an electron stream anyway. When the pulls are equal there will be no current through this instrument.  As soon as we find out where the proper setting is we can replace _S_ by some other battery, say _X_, which we wish to compare with _S_. We find the setting for that battery in the same way as we just did for _S_. Suppose it is at _d_ in Fig. 14 while the setting for _S_ was at _b_. We can see at once that _X_ is stronger than _S_. The question, however, is how much stronger.  Perhaps it would be better to try to answer this question by talking about e. m. f.'s. It isn't fair to speak only of the positive plate which calls, we must speak also of the negative plate which is shooing electrons away from itself. The idea of e. m. f. takes care of both these actions. The steady stream of electrons in the fine wire is due to the e. m. f. of the battery _B_, that is to the pull of the positive terminal and the shove of the negative.  If the wire is uniform, that is the same throughout its length, then each inch of it requires just as much e. m. f. as any other inch. Two inches require twice the e. m. f. which one inch requires. We know how much e. m. f. it takes to keep the electron stream going in the part of the wire from _n_ to _b_. It takes just the e. m. f. of the standard cell, _S_, because when that had its feet braced at _n_ it pulled just as hard at _b_ as did the big battery _B_.  Suppose the distance _n_ to _d_ (usually written _nd_) is twice as great as that from _n_ to _b_ (_nb_). That means that battery _X_ has twice the e. m. f. of battery _S_. You remember that _X_ could exert the same force through the length of wire _nd_, as could the large battery. That is twice what cell _S_ can do. Therefore if we know how many volts to call the e. m. f. of the standard cell we can say that _X_ has an e. m. f. of twice as many volts.  If we measured dry batteries this way we should find that they each had an e. m. f. of about 1.46 volts. A storage battery would be found to have about 2.4 volts when fully charged and perhaps as low as 2.1 volts when we had run it for a while.  That is the way in which to compare batteries and to measure their e. m. f.'s, but you see it takes a lot of time. It is easier to use a \"voltmeter\" which is an instrument for measuring e. m. f.'s. Here is how one could be made.  First there is made a current-measuring instrument which is quite sensitive, so that its pointer will show a deflection when only a very small stream of electrons is passing through the instrument. We could make one in the same way as we made the ammeter of the last letter but there are other better ways of which I'll tell you later. Then we connect a good deal of fine wire in series with the instrument for a reason which I'll tell you in a minute. The next and last step is to calibrate.  We know how many volts of e. m. f. are required to keep going the electron stream between _n_ and _b_--we know that from the e. m. f. of our standard cell. Suppose then that we connect this new instrument, which we have just made, to the wire at _n_ and _b_ as in Fig. 15. Some of the electrons at _n_ which are so anxious to get away from the negative plate of battery _B_ can now travel as far as _b_ through the wire of the new instrument. They do so and the pointer swings around to some new position. Opposite that we mark the number of volts which the standard battery told us there was between _n_ and _b_.  [Illustration: Fig 15]  If we move the end of the wire from _b_ to _d_ the pointer will take a new position. Opposite this we mark twice the number of volts of the standard cell. We can run it to a point _e_ where the distance _ne_ is one-half _nb_, and mark our scale with half the number of volts of the standard cell, and so on for other positions along the wire. That's the way we calibrate a sensitive current-measuring instrument (with its added wire, of course) so that it will read volts. It is now a voltmeter.  If we connect a voltmeter to the battery _X_ as in Fig. 16 the pointer will tell us the number of volts in the e. m. f. of _X_, for the pointer will take the same position as it did when the voltmeter was connected between _n_ and _d_.  There is only one thing to watch out for in all this. We must be careful that the voltmeter is so made that it won't offer too easy a path for electrons to follow. We only want to find how hard a battery can pull an electron, for that is what we mean by e. m. f. Of course, we must let a small stream of electrons flow through the voltmeter so as to make the pointer move. That is why voltmeters of this kind are made out of a long piece of fine wire or else have a coil of fine wire in series with the current-measuring part. The fine wire makes a long and narrow path for the electrons and so there can be only a small stream. Usually we describe this condition by saying that a voltmeter has a high resistance.  [Illustration: Fig 16]  Fine wires offer more resistance to electron streams than do heavy wires of the same length. If a wire is the same diameter all along, the longer the length of it which we use the greater is the resistance which is offered to an electron stream.  You will need to know how to describe the resistance of a wire or of any part of an electric circuit. To do so you tell how many \"ohms\" of resistance it has. The ohm is the unit in which we measure the resistance of a circuit to an electron stream.  I can show you what an ohm is if I tell you a simple way to measure a resistance. Suppose you have a wire or coil of wire and want to know its resistance. Connect it in series with a battery and an ammeter as shown in Fig. 17. The same electron stream passes through all parts of this circuit and the ammeter tells us what this stream is in amperes. Now connect a voltmeter to the two ends of the coil as shown in the figure. The voltmeter tells in volts how much e. m. f. is being applied to force the current through the coil. Divide the number of volts by the number of amperes and the quotient (answer) is the number of ohms of resistance in the coil.  [Illustration: Fig 17]  Suppose the ammeter shows a current of one ampere and the voltmeter an e. m. f. of one volt. Then dividing 1 by 1 gives 1. That means that the coil has a resistance of one ohm. It also means one ohm is such a resistance that one volt will send through it a current of one ampere. You can get lots of meaning out of this. For example, it means also that one volt will send a current of one ampere through a resistance of one ohm.  How many ohms would the coil have if it took 5 volts to send 2 amperes through it. Solution: Divide 5 by 2 and you get 2.5. Therefore the coil would have a resistance of 2.5 ohms.  Try another. If a coil of resistance three ohms is carrying two amperes what is the voltage across the terminals of the coil? For 1 ohm it would take 1 volt to give a current of 1 ampere, wouldn't it? For 3 ohms it takes three times as much to give one ampere. To give twice this current would take twice 3 volts. That is, 2 amperes in 3 ohms requires 2x3 volts.  Here's one for you to try by yourself. If an e. m. f. of 8 volts is sending current through a resistance of 2 ohms, how much current is flowing? Notice that I told the number of ohms and the number of volts, what are you going to tell? Don't tell just the number; tell how many and what.     LETTER 9  THE AUDION-CHARACTERISTIC   MY DEAR YOUNG STUDENT:  Although there is much in Letters 7 and 8 which it is well to learn and to think about, there are only three of the ideas which you must have firmly grasped to get the most out of this letter which I am now going to write you about the audion.  First: Electric currents are streams of electrons. We measure currents in amperes. To measure a current we may connect into the circuit an ammeter.  Second: Electrons move in a circuit when there is an electron-moving-force, that is an electromotive force or e. m. f. We measure e. m. f.'s in volts. To measure an e. m. f. we connect a voltmeter to the two points between which the e. m. f. is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30689"],["title","The Brass Bottle (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net)    THE BRASS BOTTLE  by  F.

At this precise time he was waiting on the balcony of the Hôtel de la Plage--the sole hostelry of St. Luc-en-Port, the tiny Normandy watering-place upon which, by some happy inspiration, he had lighted during a solitary cycling tour--waiting until She should appear.  He could see the whole scene: the tiny cove, with the violet shadow of the cliff sleeping on the green water; the swell of the waves lazily lapping against the diving-board from which he had plunged half an hour before; he remembered the long swim out to the buoy; the exhilarated anticipation with which he had dressed and climbed the steep path to the hotel terrace.  For was he not to pass the whole remainder of that blissful day in Sylvia Futvoye's society? Were they not to cycle together (there were, of course, others of the party--but they did not count), to cycle over to Veulettes, to picnic there under the cliff, and ride back--always together--in the sweet-scented dusk, over the slopes, between the poplars or the cornfields glowing golden against a sky of warm purple?  Now he saw himself going round to the gravelled courtyard in front of the hotel with a sudden dread of missing her. There was nothing there but the little low cart, with its canvas tilt which was to convey Professor Futvoye and his wife to the place of _rendezvous_.  There was Sylvia at last, distractingly fair and fresh in her cool pink blouse and cream-coloured skirt; how gracious and friendly and generally delightful she had been throughout that unforgettable day, which was supreme amongst others only a little less perfect, and all now fled for ever!  They had had drawbacks, it was true. Old Futvoye was perhaps the least bit of a bore at times, with his interminable disquisitions on Egyptian art and ancient Oriental character-writing, in which he seemed convinced that Horace must feel a perfervid interest, as, indeed, he thought it politic to affect. The Professor was a most learned archæologist, and positively bulged with information on his favourite subjects; but it is just possible that Horace might have been less curious concerning the distinction between Cuneiform and Aramæan or Kufic and Arabic inscriptions if his informant had happened to be the father of anybody else. However, such insincerities as these are but so many evidences of sincerity.  So with self-tormenting ingenuity Horace conjured up various pictures from that Norman holiday of his: the little half-timbered cottages with their faded blue shutters and the rushes growing out of their thatch roofs; the spires of village churches gleaming above the bronze-green beeches; the bold headlands, their ochre and yellow cliffs contrasting grimly with the soft ridges of the turf above them; the tethered black-and-white cattle grazing peacefully against a background of lapis lazuli and malachite sea, and in every scene the sensation of Sylvia's near presence, the sound of her voice in his ears. And now?... He looked up from the papers and tracing-cloth on his desk, and round the small panelled room which served him as an office, at the framed plans and photographs, the set squares and T squares on the walls, and felt a dull resentment against his surroundings. From his window he commanded a cheerful view of a tall, mouldering wall, once part of the Abbey boundaries, surmounted by _chevaux-de-frise_, above whose rust-attenuated spikes some plane trees stretched their yellowing branches.  \"She would have come to care for me,\" Horace's thoughts ran on, disjointedly. \"I could have sworn that that last day of all--and her people didn't seem to object to me. Her mother asked me cordially enough to call on them when they were back in town. When I did----\"  When he had called, there had been a difference--not an unusual sequel to an acquaintanceship begun in a Continental watering-place. It was difficult to define, but unmistakable--a certain formality and constraint on Mrs. Futvoye's part, and even on Sylvia's, which seemed intended to warn him that it is not every friendship that survives the Channel passage. So he had gone away sore at heart, but fully recognising that any advances in future must come from their side. They might ask him to dinner, or at least to call again; but more than a month had passed, and they had made no sign. No, it was all over; he must consider himself dropped.  \"After all,\" he told himself, with a short and anything but mirthful laugh, \"it's natural enough. Mrs. Futvoye has probably been making inquiries about my professional prospects. It's better as it is. What earthly chance have I got of marrying unless I can get work of my own? It's all I can do to keep myself decently. I've no right to dream of asking any one--to say nothing of Sylvia--to marry me. I should only be rushing into temptation if I saw any more of her. She's not for a poor beggar like me, who was born unlucky. Well, whining won't do any good--let's have a look at Beevor's latest performance.\"  He spread out a large coloured plan, in a corner of which appeared the name of \"William Beevor, Architect,\" and began to study it in a spirit of anything but appreciation.  \"Beevor gets on,\" he said to himself. \"Heaven knows that I don't grudge him his success. He's a good fellow--though he _does_ build architectural atrocities, and seem to like 'em. Who am I to give myself airs? He's successful--I'm not. Yet if I only had his opportunities, what wouldn't I make of them!\"  Let it be said here that this was not the ordinary self-delusion of an incompetent. Ventimore really had talent above the average, with ideals and ambitions which might under better conditions have attained recognition and fulfilment before this.  But he was not quite energetic enough, besides being too proud, to push himself into notice, and hitherto he had met with persistent ill-luck.  So Horace had no other occupation now but to give Beevor, whose offices and clerk he shared, such slight assistance as he might require, and it was by no means cheering to feel that every year of this enforced semi-idleness left him further handicapped in the race for wealth and fame, for he had already passed his twenty-eighth birthday.  If Miss Sylvia Futvoye had indeed felt attracted towards him at one time it was not altogether incomprehensible. Horace Ventimore was not a model of manly beauty--models of manly beauty are rare out of novels, and seldom interesting in them; but his clear-cut, clean-shaven face possessed a certain distinction, and if there were faint satirical lines about the mouth, they were redeemed by the expression of the grey-blue eyes, which were remarkably frank and pleasant. He was well made, and tall enough to escape all danger of being described as short; fair-haired and pale, without being unhealthily pallid, in complexion, and he gave the impression of being a man who took life as it came, and whose sense of humour would serve as a lining for most clouds that might darken his horizon.  There was a rap at the door which communicated with Beevor's office, and Beevor himself, a florid, thick-set man, with small side-whiskers, burst in.  \"I say, Ventimore, you didn't run off with the plans for that house I'm building at Larchmere, did you? Because--ah, I see you're looking over them. Sorry to deprive you, but----\"  \"Thanks, old fellow, take them, by all means. I've seen all I wanted to see.\"  \"Well, I'm just off to Larchmere now. Want to be there to check the quantities, and there's my other house at Fittlesdon. I must go on afterwards and set it out, so I shall probably be away some days. I'm taking Harrison down, too. You won't be wanting him, eh?\"  Ventimore laughed. \"I can manage to do nothing without a clerk to help me. Your necessity is greater than mine. Here are the plans.\"  \"I'm rather pleased with 'em myself, you know,\" said Beevor; \"that roof ought to look well, eh? Good idea of mine lightening the slate with that ornamental tile-work along the top. You saw I put in one of your windows with just a trifling addition. I was almost inclined to keep both gables alike, as you suggested, but it struck me a little "]]]
