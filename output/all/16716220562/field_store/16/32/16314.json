It looked like a whole town of naked savages.  \"What have you got there?\" said another old wizard, who had no name, and that was just the best of it.  \"Why,\" said Creep-and-Crawl, \"if you can guess what it is, I will make you a present of it; but it is not so easy to find out when one does not know it!\"  The wizard who had no name looked through the magnifying glass. It actually appeared like a whole town, where all the inhabitants ran about without clothes! it was terrible, but still more terrible to see how the one knocked and pushed the other, bit each other, and drew one another about. What was undermost should be topmost, and what was topmost should be undermost!--See there, now! his leg is longer than mine!--whip it off, and away with it! There is one that has a little lump behind the ear, a little innocent lump, but it pains him, and so it shall pain him still more! And they pecked at it, and they dragged him about, and they ate him, and all on account of the little lump. There sat one as still as a little maid, who only wished for peace and quietness, but she must be brought out and they dragged her, and they pulled her, and they devoured her!  \"It is quite amusing!\" said the wizard.  \"Yes; but what do you think it is?\" asked Creep-and-Crawl. \"Can you find it out!\"  \"It is very easy to see,\" said the other, \"it is some great city, they all resemble each other. A great city it is, that's sure!\"  \"It is ditch-water!\" said Creep-and-Crawl.   ------------    THE HAPPY FAMILY.  Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, \"Hem, hem! how delicious!\" for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on dock leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.  Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery over them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple and a plumb-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old snails.  They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember very well that there had been many more; that they were of a family from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted. They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was still something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and that there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then placed on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in fact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could not possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they asked about it could give them any information,--none of them had been boiled or laid on a silver dish.  The old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the world, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver dish.  Now they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children themselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a common family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought they could observe how he increased in size, and she begged father, if he could not see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's shell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was right.  One day there was a heavy storm of rain.  \"Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock leaves!\" said Father Snail.  \"There are also rain-drops!\" said Mother Snail; \"and now the rain pours right down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very happy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has his also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure enough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world? We are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is planted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and what there is outside!\"  \"There is nothing at all,\" said Father Snail. \"No place can be better than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!\"  \"Yes,\" said the dame. \"I would willingly go to the manor-house, be boiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated so; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!\"  \"The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!\" said Father Snail. \"or the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. There need not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a tremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he not been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache when I look up to him!\"  \"You must not scold him,\" said Mother Snail; \"he creeps so carefully; he will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for! But have you not thought of it?--where shall we get a wife for him? Do you not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in the interior of the burdock forest?\"  \"Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of,\" said the old one--\"black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited. But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run to and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a wife for our little snail!\"  \"I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!\" said one of the ants; \"but I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!\"  \"That is nothing!\" said the old folks; \"has she a house?\"  \"She has a palace!\" said the ant--\"the finest ant's palace, with seven hundred passages!\"  \"I thank you!\" said Mother Snail; \"our son shall not go into an ant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the commission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and sunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without.\"  \"We have a wife for him,\" said the gnats; \"at a hundred human paces from here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she is quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred human paces!\"  \"Well, then, let her come to him!\" said the old ones; \"he has a whole forest of burdocks, she has only a bush!\"  And so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week before she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one could thus see that she was of the same species.  And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the old folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made a brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much affected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole forest of burdocks, and said--what they had always said--that it was the best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and increased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the course of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on silver dishes. After this speech was made, the old ones crept into their shells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple governed in the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled, and never came on the silver dishes; so from this they concluded that the manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world were extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of course it was so. And the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake, and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their sakes; and they were very happy, and the whole family was happy; for they, indeed were so.   ------------    THE STORY OF A MOTHER  A mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature.  Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old, man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Every thing out of doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.  As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove, that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand.  \"Do you not think that I shall save him?\" said she, \"_Our Lord_ will not take him from me!\"  And the old man,--it was Death himself,--he nodded so strangely, it could just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],["title","A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#3)"],["body","had not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold: \"What is that?\" said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man was gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him; and the old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still.  But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.  Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black clothes; and she said, \"Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him hasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and he never brings back what he takes!\"  \"Oh, only tell me which way he went!\" said the mother: \"Tell me the way, and I shall find him!\"  \"I know it!\" said the woman in the black clothes, \"but before I tell it, thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child!--I am fond of them; I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw thy tears whilst thou sang'st them!\"  \"I will sing them all, all!\" said the mother; \"but do not stop me now;--I may overtake him--I may find my child!\"  But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then Night said, \"Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw Death take his way with thy little child!\"  The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no longer knew whither she should go; then there stood a thorn-bush; there was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches.  \"Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?\" said the mother.  \"Yes,\" said the thorn-bush; \"but I will not tell thee which way he took, unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death; I shall become a lump of ice!\"  And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might be thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her blood flowed in large drops, but the thorn-bush shot forth fresh green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart of the afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way she should go.  She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat. The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open, nor low enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must go if she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and that was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless.  \"Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!\" said the weeping mother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up, as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes out.  \"Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?\" said she.  \"He has not come here yet!\" said the old grave woman, who was appointed to look after Death's great greenhouse! \"How have you been able to find the way hither? and who has helped you?\"  \"_Our Lord_ has helped me,\" said she. \"He is merciful, and you will also be so! Where shall I find my little child?\"  \"Nay, I know not,\" said the woman, \"and you cannot see! Many flowers and trees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over again! You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree or flower, just as every one happens to be settled; they look like other plants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can also beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's; but what will you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?\"  \"I have nothing to give,\" said the afflicted mother, \"but I will go to the world's end for you!\"  \"Nay, I have nothing to do there!\" said the woman, \"but you can give me your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that I like! You shall have my white hair instead! and that's always something!\"  \"Do you demand nothing else?\" said she,--\"that I will gladly give you!\" And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white hair instead.  So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants, some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about in the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat; and amongst millions she knew her child's.  \"There it is!\" cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.  \"Don't touch the flower!\" said the old woman, \"but place yourself here, and when Death comes,--I expect him every moment,--do not let him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the others. Then he will be afraid! he is responsible for them to _Our Lord_, and no one dares to pluck them up before _He_ gives leave.\"  All at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind mother could feel that it was Death that came.  \"How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?\" he asked. \"How couldst thou come quicker than I?\"  \"I am a mother,\" said she.  And Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower, but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and she felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down powerless.  \"Thou canst not do anything against me!\" said Death.  \"But that _Our Lord_ can!\" said she.  \"I only do His bidding!\" said Death. \"I am His gardener, I take all His flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise, in the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare not tell thee.\"  \"Give me back my child!\" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and cried out to Death, \"I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in despair.\"  \"Touch them not!\" said Death. \"Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.\"  \"Another mother!\" said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of both the flowers.  \"There, thou hast thine eyes,\" said Death; \"I fished them up from the lake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again, they are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well close by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst have torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.\"  And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy were felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and distress, horror, and wretchedness.  \"Both of them are God's will!\" said Death.  \"Which of them is Misfortune's flower? and which is that of Happiness?\" asked she.  \"That I will not tell thee,\" said Death; \"but this thou shalt know from me, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou saw'st,--thy own child's future life!\"  Then the mother screamed with terror, \"Which of them was my child? Tell it me! save the innocent! save my child from all that misery! rather take it away! take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my prayers, and all that I have done!\"  \"I do not understand thee!\" said Death. \"Wilt thou have thy child again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!\"  Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our Lord: \"Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best! hear me not! hear me not!\"  And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and went with it into the unknown land.   [Illustration: \"THE STORY OF A MOTHER.\"]   ------------    THE FALSE COLLAR.  There was once a fine gentleman, all of whose moveables were a bootjack and a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world; and it is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story.  It was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened that it came to be washed in company with a garter.  \"Nay!\" said the collar, \"I never did see anything so slender and so fine, so soft and so neat. May I not ask your name?\"  \"That I shall not tell you!\" said the garter.  \"Where do you live?\" asked the collar.  But the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange question to answer.  \"You are certainly a girdle,\" said the collar; \"that is to say an inside girdle. I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young lady.\"  \"I will thank you not to speak to me,\" said the garter. \"I think I have not given the least occasion for it.\"  \"Yes! when one is as handsome as you,\" said the collar, \"that is"]]]
