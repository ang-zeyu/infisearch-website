Up above, in the clear sky, there was a feeling of some hostile presence, and a disagreeable little buzzing sound, as though there were some invisible mosquito up among the stars.  \"They're here now,\" said the doctor.  The noise increased: a buzzing swarm of giant bees seemed to be approaching the hill.  Suddenly there was a long hiss, and a ray of light leaped forth from the valley and began to search the sky with a sort of superhuman thoroughness. The women on the lawn ran away to the shelter of the trees. The short, sharp barking of the guns, the deeper rumble of the bombs that were beginning to fall on the town, and the earth-shaking explosions terrified them beyond endurance.  \"I'm going to shut my eyes,\" said one, \"it's easier like that.\"  \"My God,\" exclaimed another, \"I can't move my legs an inch!\"  \"Fear,\" said the doctor, \"shows itself in hereditary reflexes. Man, when in danger, seeks the pack, and fright makes his flesh creep, because his furred ancestors bristled all over when in combat, in order to appear enormous and terrible.\"  A terrific explosion shook the hill, and flames arose over the town.  \"They're aiming at the station,\" said the colonel. \"Those searchlights do more harm than good. They simply frame the target and show it up.\"  \"When I was at Havre,\" Aurelle remarked, \"a gunner went to ask the Engineers for some searchlights that were rotting away in some store or other. 'Quite impossible,' said the engineer; 'they're the war reserve; we're forbidden to touch them.' He could never be brought to understand that the war we were carrying on over here was the one that was specified in his schedule.\"  The great panting and throbbing of an aeroplane was coming nearer, and the whole sky was quivering with the noise of machinery like a huge factory.  \"My God,\" exclaimed the doctor, \"we're in for it this time!\"  But the stars twinkled gently on, and above the din they heard the clear, delicate notes of a bird's song--just as though the throbbing motors, the whizzing shells and the frightened wailing of the women were nothing but the harmonies devised by the divine composer of some military-pastoral symphony to sustain the slender melody of a bird.  \"Listen,\" whispered Colonel Parker, \"listen--a nightingale!\"     CHAPTER VII  LOVE AND THE INFANT DUNDAS    \"... Of which, if thou be a severe sour-complexion'd man, then I    hereby disallow thee to be a competent judge.\"--_The Compleat    Angler._   The Infant Dundas struck up a rag-time on the sergeant-major's typewriter, did a juggling turn with the army list, and let forth a few hunting yells; then, seeing that the interpreter had reached the required state of exasperation, he said:  \"Aurelle, why should we stay in this camp? Let's go into the town; I'll get hold of the Intelligence car, and we'll go and see Germaine.\"  Germaine was a pretty, friendly girl who sold novels, chocolates and electric lamps at Abbeville. Dundas, who was not interested in women, pretended to have a discreet passion for her; in his mind France was associated with the idea of love-affairs, and he thought it the right thing to have a girl-friend there, just as he would have thought it correct to hunt in Ireland, or to ski at St. Moritz.  But when Germaine, with feigned timidity, directed on him the slowly dwindling fire of her gaze, Dundas was afraid to put his arm round her waist; this rosy-cheeked giant, who was a champion boxer and had been wounded five times, was as bashful and shy as a child.  \"Good morning,\" he would say with a blush.  \"Good morning,\" Germaine would answer, adding in a lower voice for Aurelle's benefit, \"Tell him to buy something.\"  In vain did Aurelle endeavour to find books for the Infant. French novels bored him; only the elder Dumas and Alphonse Daudet found favour in his eyes. Dundas would buy his seventeenth electric lamp, stop a few minutes on the doorstep to play with Germaine's black dog Dick, and then say good-bye, giving her hand a long squeeze and going away perfectly happy in the thought that he had done his duty and gone on the spree in France in the correct manner.  \"A nice boy, your friend--but he is rather shy,\" she used to say.  On Sundays she went for walks along the river with an enormous mother and ungainly sisters, escorted gravely by Dundas. The mess did not approve of these rustic idylls.  \"I saw him sitting beside her in a field,\" said Colonel Parker, \"and his horse was tied to a tree. I think it's disgusting.\"  \"It's shameful,\" said the padre.  \"I'll speak to him about it,\" said the general, \"it's a disgrace to the mess.\"  Aurelle tried to speak up for his friend.  \"Maybe,\" said the doctor, \"pleasure is a right in France, but in England it's a crime. With you, Aurelle, when girls see you taking a lady-friend out, their opinion of you goes up. In London, on the other hand----\"  \"Do you mean to say, doctor, that the English never flirt?\"  \"They flirt more than you do, my boy; that's why they say less about it. Austerity of doctrine bears a direct proportion to strength of instinct. You like to discuss these matters, because you think lightly of them, and in that we Irish resemble you. Our great writers, such as Bernard Shaw, write thousands of paradoxes about marriage, because their thoughts are chaste. The English are far more prudish because their passions are stronger.\"  \"What's all this you're saying, doctor?\" interrupted the general. \"I seem to be hearing very strange doctrines.\"  \"We're talking about French morals, sir.\"  \"Is it true, Messiou,\" inquired Colonel Parker, \"that it is the custom in France for a man to take his wife and his mistress to the theatre together to the same box?\"  \"You needn't try to convince Aurelle of your virtue, colonel,\" said the doctor; \"he's been living with you for four years, and he knows you.\"    *  *  *  *  *  Meanwhile Dundas continued to go down into Abbeville every day and meet his friend. The shelling had got very bad, and the inhabitants began to leave the town. Germaine, however, remained calm. One day a shell hit the shop next door to hers, and shattered the whole of the whitewashed front of the house, and the plaster crumbling away revealed a fine wooden building which for the last two centuries had been concealing its splendid carved beams beneath a wretched coat of whitewash. So also did Germaine, divested by danger of her superficial vulgarity, suddenly show her mettle and prove herself the daughter of a race of soldiers.  Accordingly Dundas had conceived a warm and respectful friendship for her. But he went no further until one day when the alarm caught them together just as he was bidding her good-bye; then only did the darkness and the pleasant excitement of danger cause him to forget ceremony and convention for a few minutes.  Next day Germaine presented the Infant with a fat yellow book; it was Madame de Staëls _Corinne_. The rosy-cheeked one looked askance at the small closely printed pages.  \"Aurelle,\" he implored, \"be a good chap and tell me what it's all about--I'm not going to read the damned thing!\"  \"It's the story of a young Scotch laird,\" replied Aurelle, \"who wants to marry a foreign girl against his family's wish.\"  \"My God!\" exclaimed Dundas. \"Do you think she expects me to marry her? My cousin Lord Bamford married a dancer and he's very happy; he's the gentleman and she has the brains. But in this case it's the mother--she's a terrible creature!\"  \"The Zulus,\" put in the doctor, who was listening, \"have a religious custom which forbids the bridegroom-elect to see his mother-in-law. Should he happen but to see her footprints in the sand, he must turn and flee. Nothing could be wiser; for love implies an absurd and boundless admiration for the loved one, and her mother, appearing to the lover in the very image of his beloved without the charm and liveliness of youth, will deter him from that brief spell of folly which is so necessary for the propagation of the species.\"  \"Some mothers are charming,\" argued Aurelle.  \"That's another danger,\" said the doctor, \"for as the mother always tends to live her daughter's emotional life, there is a constant risk of her falling in love with her son-in-law.\"  \"My God!\" cried Dundas, horror-struck.  However, the German airmen set his fears at rest that very evening by destroying half the town. The statue of Admiral Courbet in the middle of the square near the bookseller's shop was hit by a bomb. The admiral continued to point an outstretched finger towards the station, but the bookseller cleared out. Germaine followed him regretfully.  As she was unable to take her dog Dick--a horrid mongrel, half-poodle and half-spaniel--Dundas gravely consented to look after him. He loved dogs with a sentimental warmth which he denied to men. Their ideas interested him, their philosophy was the same as his, and he used to talk to them for hours at a time like a nurse to her children.  The general and Colonel Parker were not a bit astonished when he introduced Dick into the mess. They had found fault with him for falling in love, but they approved of his adopting a dog.  Dick, an Abbeville guttersnipe, was therefore admitted to the refinements of the general's table. He remained, however, a rough son of the people, and barked when Private Brommit appeared with the meat.  \"Behave yourself, sir,\" Dundas said to him, genuinely shocked, \"behave yourself. A well-brought-up dog never, never does that. A good dog never barks indoors, never, never, never.\"  Germaine's pet was offended and disappeared for three days. The orderlies reported he had been seen in the country in doubtful company. At last he returned, cheerful and unkempt, with one ear torn and one eye bleeding, and asked to be let in by barking merrily.  \"You're a very naughty dog, sir,\" said Dundas as he nursed him adroitly, \"a very, very bad little dog indeed.\"  Whereupon he turned towards the general.  \"I'm very much afraid, sir,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30596"],["title","General Bramble (#6)"],["body"," he said, \"that this fellow Dick is not quite a gentleman.\"  \"He's a French dog,\" replied General Bramble with sorrowful forbearance.     CHAPTER VIII  A GREAT CHEF    \"Le roi ordonnait le matin petit souper ou très petit souper;    mais ce dernier était abondant et de trois services sans le    fruit.\"--Saint-Simon.   In the month of February 1918, Aurelle was ordered by the French mission at British G.H.Q. to report at the _sous-préfecture_ at Abbeville and to hold himself for one day at the disposal of M. Lucas, who would call for him in due course.  Aurelle waited for some time for M. Lucas, who eventually appeared escorted by an English chauffeur. He was a rather stout, clean-shaven little man, and wore a well-made blue suit and a yachting cap. With his hands in his pockets, his curt speech and the authority of his demeanour, he looked every inch a man accustomed to command.  \"You are the interpreter from G.H.Q.?\" he asked. \"Have you a written order?\"  Aurelle was obliged to admit he had only received an order by telephone.  \"I can't understand it!\" said M. Lucas. \"The most necessary precautions are neglected. Have you at least been told who I am? No? Well, listen to me, my friend, and kindly hold your tongue for a minute.\"  He went and shut the door of the _sous-préfet's_ office, and came back to the interpreter. \"I am----\" he began.  He looked nervously about him, closed a window, and whispered very softly, \"I am His Majesty the King of England's chef.\"  \"Chef?\" Aurelle repeated, not grasping his meaning.  \"His Majesty the King of England's chef,\" the great man deigned to repeat, smiling kindly at the astonishment the young man showed at this revelation.  \"You must know, my friend, that to-morrow the President of the Republic is to be His Majesty's guest in this town. The activity of the German airmen obliges us to keep the programme secret till the last moment. However, I have been sent out in advance with Sir Charles to inspect the British Officers' Club, where the lunch is to take place. You are to accompany me there.\"  So they set off for the former Château de Vauclère, now transformed by British genius for comfort into an officers' club, Aurelle escorting the royal cook and the equerry, who was an old English gentleman with a pink face, white whiskers and grey spats. Above their heads circled the squadron of aeroplanes which had been ordered to protect the favoured city.  During the drive, M. Lucas condescended to say a few words of explanation.  \"Our lunch is to be quite informal; the menu very simple--ever since the beginning of the war His Majesty has expressed a wish to be rationed like his people--river trout, _tournedos aux pommes,_ some fruit, and cider to drink.\"  \"But, Monsieur Lucas,\" interrupted Sir Charles timidly, \"you know Her Majesty prefers to drink milk.\"  \"The Queen will drink cider like every one else,\" replied the chef curtly.  Sir Charles was charmed with the paved courtyard of the château, the brick and stone façade with its carved escutcheons, the simple curves of the dining-room panelling, and the picture over the door, which he attributed, not without reason, to Nattier.  \"It's very, very small,\" murmured M. Lucas pensively. \"However, as it's war-time----\"  Then he inquired about the kitchen. It was a vast and well-lighted place; the red and white tiles on the polished floor shone brightly in the sunshine; magnificent but useless copper saucepans hung upon the walls.  In front of the oven a cook in a white cap was at work with a few assistants. Surprised by the noise, he turned round, and, suddenly recognizing the man in the blue suit, went as white as his cap, and dropped the pan he was holding in his hand.  \"You?\" he exclaimed.  \"Yes, my friend,\" replied the august visitor quite simply. \"What a surprise to find you here! What a pleasure also,\" he added kindly. \"Ah, now I feel relieved! An alfresco meal, a strange kitchen like this, made me very anxious, I must confess. But with such a lieutenant as you, my dear friend, the battle is already half won.\"  \"Yes,\" he continued, turning towards Aurelle, who was gazing with emotion upon the encounter and thinking of Napoleon entrusting his cavalry to Ney on the eve of Waterloo, \"it is a curious coincidence to find Jean Paillard here. At the age of fifteen we made our _début_ together under the great Escoffier. When I was appointed chef to the Ritz, Paillard took charge of the Carlton; when I took Westminster, he accepted Norfolk.\"  Having thus unconsciously delivered himself of this romantic couplet--which goes to prove once again that poetry is the ancient and natural expression of all true feeling--M. Lucas paused for a moment, and, lowering his gaze, added in an infinitely expressive undertone:  \"And here I am now with the King. What about you?\"  \"I?\" replied the other with a touch of shame. \"It's only two months since I was released; till then I was in the trenches.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed M. Lucas, scandalized. \"In the trenches? A chef like you!\"  \"Yes,\" answered Jean Paillard with dignity. \"I was cook at G.H.Q.\"  With a shrug of resignation the two artists deplored the waste of talent for which armed democracies are responsible; and M. Lucas began in resolute tones to announce his plan of campaign. He had the curt precision which all great captains possess.  \"Since the war broke out, His Majesty has expressed a wish to be rationed like his people. Therefore the menu is to be very simple: _truite à la Bellevue, tournedos aux pommes_, some fruit.--Of course there will have to be an entrée and some dessert for the Staff. The drink will be cider.\"  \"May I remind you, Monsieur Lucas,\" Sir Charles put in anxiously, \"that Her Majesty prefers to drink milk?\"  \"I have already told you,\" said the chef, annoyed, \"that the Queen will drink cider like everybody else.... Nevertheless, Paillard, you will kindly show me the contents of your cellar; there will, of course, have to be wine for the Staff. The _tournedos_, I need hardly say, are to be grilled over a charcoal fire, and larded, of course. As to salad--seasoning, tomatoes and walnuts----\"  As he gave his orders, he illustrated their execution with gestures of the utmost solemnity, and his hands moved busily amongst imaginary saucepans.  \"The menu is short,\" he said, \"but it must be perfect. The great cook is better recognized by the perfection of a piece of beef--or let me say rather by the seasoning of a salad--than by the richness of his sweets. One of the finest successes in my career--the one I enjoy recalling above all others--is that of having initiated the English aristocracy into the mysteries of Camembert. The choice of fruit--now I come to think of it, Paillard, have you any peaches?\"  \"I should think we had!\" said the latter, breaking open the lid of a crate which revealed a number of delicately shaded ripe peaches glowing in their beds of straw and cotton-wool.  The chef took one and stroked it gently.  \"Paillard, Paillard,\" he said sadly, \"do you call _these_ peaches? I can see you have been a soldier, poor fellow. Never mind, I can send the car to Montreuil.\"  He remained a few minutes longer in meditation; then, satisfied at last, he decided to leave the château. In the street, he took Aurelle's arm very kindly.  \"My friend,\" he said, \"I think that will do, thank you. And if you ever have the opportunity of seeing Their Majesties, don't let it slip by. In France, you have very wrong ideas, I assure you; since the Revolution, you have a prejudice against Royal Families. It is childish; you can take my word for it. I have been living with this one for more than five years, and I assure you they are quite respectable people.\"     CHAPTER IX  PRÉLUDE À LA SOIRÉE D'UN GÉNÉRAL    \"... of cabbages and kings.\"--Lewis Carroll.   A blue forage-cap appeared under the flap of the camouflaged tent.  \"Messiou,\" cried the general, \"we were beginning to despair of ever seeing you again.\"  \"Yo-ho! Hello--o!\" shouted the Infant Dundas. \"I _am_ glad! Come and have some lunch, old man.\"  Aurelle, happy to find his friends again, fell to heartily on the mutton, boiled potatoes and mint sauce. When they reached the cheese, General Bramble questioned him about his journey.  \"Well, Messiou, what about your leave? What is Paris looking like nowadays, and why did your mother the French Mission tell us she was keeping you two days at Abbeville?\"  Aurelle told then the story of M. Lucas and of the King's visit.  \"What's that, Messiou?\" said General Bramble. \"You've seen our King? Does he look well?\"  \"Very well indeed, sir.\"  \"Good old George!\" muttered the general tenderly. \"Yes, he looked quite well when he came here. Tell us that story of the cook over again, Messiou; it's a jolly good story.\"  Aurelle complied, and when he had done, he bent over towards Colonel Parker and asked him why the general spoke of the King like an affectionate nurse.  \"The King,\" said the colonel, \"is much more to us than you might imagine. To the general, who is an Etonian, he is a kind of neighbour. To Dundas, he's the colonel of his regiment. To the padre, he's the head of the Church. To an old Tory like me, he's the living embodiment of England's traditions and prejudices, and the pledge of her loyalty to them in the future. As for the paternal tone, that's because for half a century the King was a Queen. Loyalism became an attitude of protective chivalry; nothing could have consolidated the dynasty more firmly. Royalty is beloved not only by the aristocracy but by all classes. It's a great asset to a people without imagination like ours to be able to see in one man the embodiment of the nation.\"  \"Messiou,\" interposed the general, \"didn't they give you an M.V.O. for your services?\"  \"What is that, sir--a new ribbon?\"  \"My God!\" exclaimed Dundas, much scandalized. \"You've never heard of the Victorian Order?\"  \"When King Edward played bridge,\" said the general, \"and his partner left it to him at the right moment, "]]]
