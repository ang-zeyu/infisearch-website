But her mind rejected the idea of telepathy instead, so she was susceptible to the thoughts because she thought they were her own.  The cavorting of the nymphs and satyrs became somewhat obscene, but Rafe didn't bother to correct it. He had more to worry about than offending the rather prim mind of Dr. Malekrinova.      \"_It was harder for His Royal Highness than for sons of toil,         For the horny-handed workmen only ate three figs per day,       While the King liked sweet potatoes, puddings, pies, and canned           tomatoes,         Boneless ham, and Bluepoint oysters cooked some prehistoric way._\"  What to do now? Should he try to get out of Russia? Was there any quick way out?  He had all the information he needed on the heat-beam projector that Dr. Malekrinova was building. The theory behind it was perfectly clear; all it needed was further experimentation. If it worked out according to theory, it would be an almost perfect defense against even the fastest intercontinental ballistic missiles.      \"_As he growled, the Royal grumbler spied a bit of broken tumbler         In a long undusted corner just behind the chamber door.       When his hungry optics spied it, he stood silently and eyed it,         Then he smote his thigh with ecstasy and danced about the floor._\"  Maybe he should try to make a run for the American Embassy. No. No one there knew him, and they probably couldn't get him out of the country, anyway. Besides, it would take him too long to explain the situation to them.      \"_'By the wit Osiris gave me! This same bit of glass shall save me!          I shall sell it as a diamond at some stupendous price!        And whoe'er I ask to take it will find, for his own sweet sake, it          Will be better not to wait until I have to ask him twice!'_\"  The theory behind the heat projector was simply an extension of the laser theory, plus a few refinements. Inside a ring made of the proper material, the light, acted upon by exterior magnetic fields, tended to move in a circle, so that the photon cascade effect was all in one direction instead of bouncing back and forth between a pair of mirrors. That light could be bent around corners by making it travel through a glass rod was well known, and the Malekrinova Q-tube took advantage of that effect.  In a way, the principle was similar to that of the cyclotron, except that instead of spinning ions around in a circle to increase their velocity a beam of coherent light was circulated to increase its intensity.  Then, at the proper moment, a beam of intense coherent light shot out of the tangent that formed the tail of the Q-tube. If the material of the Q was properly constructed and contained atoms that fluoresced strongly in the infra red, you had a heat beam that delivered plenty of power. And, since the radiation was linear and \"in step,\" the Q-tube didn't heat up much at all. The cascade effect took most of the energy out as radiation.      \"_Then a Royal Proclamation was dispatched throughout the nation,         Most imperatively calling to appear before the King.       Under penalties most cruel, every man who sold a jewel         Or who bought and bartered precious stones, and all that sort of           thing._\"  But knowing all that didn't help Raphael Poe or the United States of America one whit if the information couldn't be gotten out of Russia and into Colonel Spaulding's hands. Lenny had told him of the trouble the colonel was having with Dr. Davenport.  If he could only communicate with Lenny! But if he did, Dr. Malekrinova would pick up every bit of it, and that would be the end of that. No, he had to figure out some way to get himself and the information both out of the country.  Meanwhile, he had to keep thinking of an animated necktie. And he had to keep singing.      \"_Thereupon, the jewelers' nether joints all quaked and knocked           together,         As they packed their Saratogas in lugubrious despair.       It was ever their misfortune to be pillaged by extortion,         And they thought they smelled a rodent on the sultry desert air._\"  Lenny Poe shoved open the door of Colonel Spaulding's outer office with a violence that startled Sergeant Nugget.  \"Is Spaulding in?\" he barked.  \"I think he's expecting you,\" she said. There was no time to buzz the colonel; Poe was already opening the door.  \"Rafe's in trouble!\" Lenny said hurriedly, slamming the door behind him.  \"Where have you been?\" snapped the colonel.  \"Never mind that! Rafe's in trouble, I said! We've gotta figure a way to get him out of it!\"  Colonel Spaulding dropped all thought of bawling out Poe. \"What'd he say? What's the trouble?\"  \"All he's doing is broadcasting that necktie--like an animated cartoon in technicolor. And he's singing.\"  \"Singing? Singing what?\"      \"_As they faced the Great Propylon, with an apprehensive smile on,         Sculptured there in heiroglyphics six feet wide and nine feet high       Was the threat of King Rameses to chop every man to pieces         Who, when shown the Royal diamond, would dare refuse to buy._\"  Colonel Spaulding blinked. \"That's pretty. What does it mean?\"  \"Nothing; it's a song, that's all. That female Russian scientist can read Rafe's mind, and he's broadcasting this stuff to cover up!\"  Quickly, he told Spaulding what the situation was as he had been able to piece it together from Rafe's secondary thoughts.  \"Ye Gods!\" Colonel Spaulding slapped at his brow. Then he grabbed for the telephone and started dialing.  Lenny dropped into one of the chairs, closed his eyes, and concentrated.  _Rafe! Rafe! Listen to me! Rafe!_      \"_Then the richest dealer, Mulai Hassan, eyed the gem and coolly         Said, 'The thing is but a common tumbler-bottom, nothing more!'       Whereupon, the King's Assassin drew his sword, and Mulai Hassan         Never peddled rings again upon the Nile's primeval shore._\"  But below the interference came Rafe's thoughts. And the one thing of primary importance to him was to get the information on the heat-beam generator to the United States.  No bigotry, no matter how strong, is totally impregnable. Even the most narrow-minded racial bigot will make an exception if a person of the despised race risks his own life to save the life of the bigot or someone the bigot loves. The bigotry doesn't collapse--not by a long shot. But an exception is made in that one case.  Lenny Poe made an exception. Any information that was worth his brother's life was _Important_! Therefore, it was not, could not be, scientific gobbledegook, no matter how it sounded.  _Rafe, give it to me! Try me! I can copy it!_      \"_Then Abdullah abd Almahdi faintly said the stone was shoddy,         But he thought that, in a pinch, he might bid fifty cents himself.       There ensued a slight commotion where he could repent the notion,         And Abdullah was promoted to the Oriental Shelf._\"  _Rafe! Stop singing that stupid song and give me the stuff! She can't learn anything if you just think about that theory stuff. She already knows that! Come on! Give!_  Lenny Poe grabbed a pencil and a sheaf of paper from the colonel's desk and began writing frantically as the _Song of the Egyptian Diamond_ stopped suddenly.         *       *       *       *       *  Words. Nonsense words. That's all most of the stuff was to Lenny. It didn't matter. He spelled them as he thought they should be, and if he made a mistake, Rafe would correct him.  Rafe tried to keep a picture of the words as they would look if printed while he thought them verbally, and that helped. The information came across in the only way it could come across--not as concepts, but as symbols.  Lenny hardly noticed that the Secretary of Defense and the President had come into the room. He didn't even realize that Colonel Spaulding was feeding him fresh sheets of paper.  Lenny didn't seem to notice the time passing, nor the pain in his hand as the muscles tired. He kept writing. The President left with the Defense Secretary and came back again after a while, but Lenny ignored them.  And when it was over, he pushed pencil and paper aside and, massaging his right hand with his left, sat there with his eyes closed. Then, slowly, a smile spread over his face.  \"Well, I'll be damned,\" he said slowly and softly.  \"Mr. Poe,\" said the President, \"is there any danger that your brother will be captured within the next hour?\"  Lenny looked up with a startled grin. \"Oh. Hi. I didn't notice you, Mr. President. What'd you say?\"  The President repeated his question.  \"Oh. No. There's nothing to worry about. The little men in white coats came after Dr. Malekrinova. She started screaming that telepathic spies were stealing her secret. She smashed all her apparatus and burned all her papers on top of the wreckage before they could stop her. She keeps shouting about a pink-and-purple orgy and singing a song about glass diamonds and Egyptian kings. I wouldn't say she was actually insane, but she is _very_ disturbed.\"  \"Then your brother is safe?\"  \"As safe as he ever was, Mr. President.\"  \"Thank Heaven for that,\" said the President. \"If they'd ever captured him and made him talk--\" He stopped. \"I forgot,\" he said lamely after a moment.  Lenny grinned. \"That's all right, Mr. President. I sometimes forget it myself. But it was his handicap, I guess, that made him concentrate on telepathy, so that he doesn't need his ears to hear what people are saying. Maybe I could read minds the way he does if I'd been born that way.  \"Come to think of it, I doubt if the Russians would have believed he was a spy if they'd caught him, unless they really did believe he was telepathic. A physical examination would show immediately that he was born without eardrums and that the inner ear bones are fused. They wouldn't try to make a man talk if an examination showed that he really was a deaf-mute.\"  The buzzer on the colonel's intercom sounded. \"Yes?\" said Spaulding.  \"Dr. Davenport is here,\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30497"],["title","The Foreign Hand Tie (#7)"],["body","Sergeant Nugget. \"He wants to talk to you.\"  \"Send him in,\" said Colonel Spaulding gleefully. \"I have a nice scientific theory I want to shove down his throat.\"         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
