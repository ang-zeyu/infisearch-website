Slavery, which barred the entrance to the army of the colored man at the South, had been denounced by the colonist before the adoption of the articles of confederation, and was maintained solely by local regulations. As early as 1774, all the colonies had agreed to, and their representatives to the congress had signed, the articles of the Continental Association, by which it was agreed, \"that we will neither import nor purchase any slave imported after the first day of December next, (1774), after which we will wholly discontinue the slave trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactories to those who are concerned in it.\" Georgia not being represented in this Congress, consequently was not in the Association, but as soon as her Provincial Congress assembled in July, 1775, it passed the following resolutions:      \"_I._--_Resolved_, That this Congress will adopt and carry     into execution all and singular the measures and     recommendations of the late Continental Congress.      \"_IV._--_Resolved_, That we will neither import or purchase     any slave imported from Africa or elsewhere after this day,     (July, 6.\")   The sincerity with which this agreement was entered into may be seen by the action of the colonists at Norfolk, Virginia, where, in March, 1775, a brig arrived from the coast of Guinea, via Jamaica, with a number of slaves on board consigned to a merchant of that town. To use a modern phrase the vessel was _boycotted_ by the committee, who published the following:                          \"TO THE FREEMEN OF VIRGINIA.                              { COMMITTEE CHAMBER,                              { NORFOLK, March 6th, 1775.       \"Trusting to your sure resentment against the enemies of      your country, we, the committee, elected by ballot for the      Borough of Norfolk, hold up for your just indignation Mr.      John Brown, merchant, of this place.       \"On Thursday, the 2nd of March, this committee were informed      of the arrival of the brig Fanny, Capt. Watson, with a      number of slaves for Mr. Brown; and, upon inquiry, it      appeared they were shipped from Jamaica as his property, and      on his account; that he had taken great pains to conceal      their arrival from the knowledge of the committee; and that      the shipper of the slaves, Mr. Brown's correspondent, and      the captain of the vessel, were all fully apprised of the      Continental prohibition against the article.       \"From the whole of this transaction, therefore, we, the      committee for Norfolk Borough, do give it as our unanimous      opinion, that the said John Brown has wilfully and      perversely violated the Continental Association, to which he      had with his own hand subscribed obedience; and that,      agreeable to the eleventh article, we are bound, forthwith,      to publish the truth of the case, to the end that all such      foes to the rights of British America may be publicly known      and universally contemned as the enemies of American      liberty, and that every person may henceforth break off all      dealings with him.\"  This was the voice of a majority of the colonists, and those who dissented were regarded as Tories, and in favor of the crown as against the independence of the colonies, although there were many at the North and South who held slaves, and were yet loyal to the cause of the colonies; but the public sentiment was undoubtedly as strong against the institution as it was in 1864. But the Tories were numerous at the South, and by continually exciting the imagination of the whites by picturing massacre and insurrection on the part of the negros if they were armed, thwarted the effort of Col. Lauren's and of Congress to raise a \"negro army\" at the South. The leaders were favorable to it, but the colonists, for the reason cited, were distrustful of its practicability. Though a strong effort was made, as will be seen, the scare raised by the Tories prevented its success. Notwithstanding, hundreds of colored men, slave and free, at the South, not only followed the army but in every engagement took an active part on the side of the colonist. They were not enrolled and mustered into the army, it is true, but they rendered important service to the cause.  The caste prejudice now so strong in the country was then in its infancy. A white man at that time lived with a colored woman without fear of incurring the ostracism of his neighbors, and with the same impunity he lived with an Indian Squaw. So common was this practice, that in order to correct it laws were passed forbidding it. The treatment of the slaves was not what it came to be after the war, nor had the spirit of resentment been stifled in them as it was subsequently. Manifestations of their courage and manliness were not wanting when injustice was attempted to be practiced against them, consequently the spirit and courage with which they went into the conflict were quite equal to that of the whites, who were ever ready to applaud them for deeds of daring. It is only through this medium that we have discovered the meed of praise due the little Phalanx, which linked its fortune with the success of the American army, and of whom the following interesting facts can now be recorded.  It is well for the negro and for his descendants in America, cosmopolitan as it is, that his race retains its distinctive characteristics, color and features, otherwise they would not have, as now, a history to hand down to posterity so gloriously patriotic and interesting. His amalgamation with other races is attributable to the relation which it bore to them, although inter-marriage was not allowed. By the common consent of his enslavers, he was allowed to live clandestinely with the women of his own color; sometimes from humane considerations, sometimes from a standpoint of gain, but always as a slave or a subject of the slave code. Reduced from his natural state of freedom by his misfortune in tribal war, to that of a slave, and then transported by the consent of his captors and enemies to these shores, and sold into an unrequited bondage, the fire of his courage,--like that of other races similarly situated, without hope of liberty; doomed to toil,--slackened into an apathetic state, and seeming willing servitude, which produced a resignation to fate from 1619 to 1770, more than a century and a half. At the latter date, for the first time in the history of what is now the United States, the negro, inspired with the love of liberty, aimed a blow at the authority that held him in bondage. In numerous instances, when the Indians attacked the white settlers, particularly in the Northern colonies, negroes were summoned and took part in the defense of the settlements.  As early as 1652, the militia law of Massachusetts required negroes, Scotchmen and Indians,--the indentured slaves of Cromwell, who encountered his army at the battle of Dunbar,--to train in the militia. Nor was it an uncommon occurrence for them to be manumitted for meritorious and courageous action in defending their masters' families, often in the absence of the master, when attacked by the red men of the woods. It was not infrequent to find the negro as a sentinel at the meeting-house door; or serving as a barricade for the master's mansion. The Indian was more of a terror to him than the boa-constrictor; though slaves, they knew that if captured by the Indians their fate would be the same as that of the white man; consequently they fought with a desperation equal to that of the whites, against the common enemy. So accustomed did they become to the use of arms, that one of the first acts of the settlers after the Indians were driven from the forest, was to disarm and forbid negroes keeping or handling fire-arms and weapons of every sort. This was done from a sense of self-preservation and fear that the negroes might (and many did) attempt to revenge themselves when cruelly treated, or rise in mutiny and massacre the whites.  [Illustration: DEATH OF CRISPUS ATTUCKS.  While leading an attack against British troops in Boston.]  But it was not until 1770, when the fervor of rebellion had influenced the people of the colonies, and Capt. Preston, with the King's soldiers, appeared in King Street, Boston, to enforce the decree of the British Parliament, that the people met the troops face to face. This lent force to the rebellious spirit against the Mother Country, which the people of the United Northern Colonies had felt called upon to manifest in public meetings and by written resolutions. The soldiers were regarded as invaders. And while the leading men of Boston were discussing and deliberating as to what steps should be taken to drive the British troops out of the town, Crispus Attucks, a negro runaway slave,[1] led a crowd against the soldiers, with brave words of encouragement. The soldiers fired upon them, killing the negro leader, Attucks, first, and then two white men, and mortally wounding two others. A writer says:       \"The presence of the British soldiers in King Street,      excited the patriotic indignation of the people. The whole      community was stirred, and sage counsellors were      deliberating and writing and talking about the public      grievances. But it was not for the 'wise and prudent' to be      first to _act_ against the encroachments of arbitrary power.      A motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes and mulattoes, Irish      Jeazues, and outlandish Jack tars, (as John Adams described      them in his plea in defence of the soldiers), could not      restrain their emotion, or stop to enquire if what they      _must_ do was according to the letter of the law. Led by      Crispus Attucks, the mulatto slave, and shouting, 'The way      to get rid of these soldiers is to attack the main guard;      strike at the root;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31339"],["title","The Black Phalanx (#4)"],["body"," this is the nest;' with more valor than      discretion they rushed to King Street, and were fired upon      by Capt. Preston's company. Crispus Attucks was the first to      fall; he and Samuel Gray and Jonas Caldwell were killed on      the spot. Samuel Maverick and Patrick Carr were mortally      wounded. The excitement which followed was intense. The      bells of the town were rung. An impromptu town-meeting was      held, and an immense assembly was gathered. Three days      after, on the 17th, a public funeral of the martyr took      place. The shops in Boston were closed, and all the bells of      Boston and the neighboring towns were rung. It is said that      a greater number of persons assembled on this occasion, than      ever before gathered on this continent for a similar      purpose. The body of Crispus Attucks, the mulatto, had been      placed in Fanueil Hall with that of Caldwell; both being      strangers in the city. Maverick was buried from his      mother's house in Union Street, and Gray, from his      brother's, in Royal Exchange Lane. The four hearses formed a      junction in King Street, and then the procession marched in      columns six deep, with a long file of coaches belonging to      the most distinguished citizens, to the Middle Burying      Ground, where the four victims were deposited in one grave;      over which a stone was placed with the inscription:            'Long as in Freedom's cause the wise contend,           Dear to your country shall your fame extend;           While to the world the lettered stone shall tell           Where Caldwell, Attucks, Gray and Maverick fell.'       \"The anniversary of this event was publicly commemorated in      Boston by an oration and other exercises every year until      our National Independence was achieved, when the Fourth of      July was substituted for the Fifth of March, as the more      proper day for a general celebration. Not only was the event      commemorated, but the martyrs who then gave up their lives      were remembered and honored.\"  Thus the first blood for liberty shed in the colonies was that of a real slave and a negro. As the news of the affray spread, the people became aroused throughout the land. Soon, in every town and village, meetings were held, and the colonists urged to resist the oppressive and aggressive measures which the British Parliament had passed, and for the enforcement of which troops had been stationed in Boston, and as we see, had shot down those who dared to oppose them. In all the colonies slavery was at this time tolerated, though the number of slaves was by no means large in the Northern Colonies, nor had there been a general ill treatment of them, as in after years in the Southern States. Their war-like courage, it is true, had been slackened, but their manhood had not been crushed.  Crispus Attucks was a fair representative of the colonial negro, as they evinced thereafter, during the prolonged struggle which resulted in the Independence of the United States. When the tocsin sounded \"to arms, to arms, ye who would be free,\" the negro responded to the call, and side by side with the white patriots of the colonial militia, bled and died.  Mr. Bancroft in his history of the United States says:       \"Nor should history forget to record, that as in the army at      Cambridge, so also in this gallant band, the free negroes of      the colony had their representatives. For the right of free      negroes to bear arms in the public defense was, at that day,      as little disputed in New England as other rights. They took      their place, not in a separate corps, but in the ranks with      the white men; and their names may be seen on the      pension-rolls of the country, side by side with those of      other soldiers of the Revolution.\"  It was not the free only who took up arms in defence of America's independence; not alone those who, in preceding wars,--Indian and French,--had gained their liberty, that swelled the ranks of the colonial militia; but slaves, inspired by the hope of freedom, went to the front, as Attucks had done when he cut the Gordian knot that held the colonies to Great Britain. \"From that moment we may date the severance of the British Empire,\" said Daniel Webster, in his Bunker Hill oration, referring to the massacre on the 5th of March, 1770. The thirst for freedom was universal among the people of New England. With them liberty was not circumscribed by condition and now, since the slave Attucks had struck the first blow for America's independence, thereby electrifying the colonies and putting quite a different phase upon their grievances, the people were called upon to witness a real slave struggling with his oppressors for his freedom. It touched the people of the colonies as they had never been touched before, and they arrayed themselves for true freedom.  Dr. Joseph Warren thus heralds the sentiment of the colonist, in his oration delivered at Boston, March 5th, 1775:       \"That personal freedom is the natural right of every man,      and that property, or an exclusive right to dispose of what      he has honestly acquired by his own labor, necessarily      arises therefrom, are truths which common sense has placed      beyond the reach of contradiction. And no man, or body of      men, can, without being guilty of flagrant injustice, claim      a right to dispose of the persons or acquisitions of any      other man or body of men, unless it can be proved that such      a right has arisen from some compact between the parties, in      which it has been explicitly and freely granted.\"  The year previous, John Hancock was the orator on the occasion of the 4th anniversary of the shedding of the first blood for the Independence of America, and he thus presents the case to a Boston audience yet smarting under the insult and sting given them by the British soldiery:       \"But I forbear, and come reluctantly to the transactions of      that dismal night, when in such quick succession, we felt      the extremes of grief, astonishment and rage; when Heaven,      in anger, for a dreadful moment suffered Hell to take the      reins; when Satan with his chosen band opened the sluices of      New England's blood, and sacrilegiously polluted our land      with the dead bodies of her guiltless sons. Let this sad      tale of death never be told without a tear; let the heaving      bosom cause to burn with a manly indignation at the      barbarous story, through the long tracts of future time; let      every parent tell the shameful story to his listening      children 'til tears of pity glisten in their eyes, and      boiling passions shake their tender frames; and whilst the      anniversary of that ill-fated night is kept a jubilee in the      grim court of pandemonium, let all America join in one      common prayer to Heaven, that the inhuman, unprovoked      murders of the 5th of March, 1770, planned by Hillsborough      and a knot of treacherous knaves in Boston, and executed by      the cruel hand of Preston and his sanguinary coadjutors, may      ever stand in history without a parallel. But what, my      countrymen, withheld the ready arm of vengeance from      executing instant justice on the vile assassins? Perhaps you      feared promiscuous carnage might ensue, and that the      innocent might share the fate of those who had performed the      infernal deed. But were not all guilty? Were you not too      tender of the lives of those who came to fix a yoke on your      necks? But I must not too severely blame you for a fault      which great souls only can commit. May that magnificence of      spirit which scorns the low pursuit of malice; may that      generous compassion which often preserves from ruin, even a      guilty villain, forever actuate the noble bosoms of      Americans! But let not the miscreant host vainly imagine      that we feared their arms. No, those we despised; we dread      nothing but slavery. Death is the creature of a poltroon's      brains; 'tis immortality to sacrifice ourselves for the      salvation of our country. We fear not death. That gloomy      night, the pale-face moon, and the affrighted stars that      hurried through the sky, can witness that we fear not death.      Our hearts, which, at the recollection, glow with rage that      four revolving years have scarcely taught us to restrain,      can witness that we fear not death; and happy it is for      those who dared to insult us, that their naked bones are not      now piled up an ever-lasting monument of Massachusetts      bravery. But they retired; they fled, and in that flight      they found their only safety. We then expected that the hand      of public justice would soon inflict that punishment upon      the murderers, which, by the laws of God and man, they had      incurred. But let the unbiassed pen of a Robertson, or      perhaps of some equally famed American, conduct this trial      before the great tribunal of succeeding generations. And      though the murderers may escape the just resentment of an      enraged people; though drowsy justice, intoxicated by the      poisonous draft prepared for her cup, still nods upon her      rotten seat, yet be assured, such complicated crimes will      meet their due reward. Tell me, ye bloody butchers! ye      villains high and low! ye wretches who contrived, as well as      you who executed the inhuman deed! do you not feel the goads      and stings of conscious guilt pierce through your savage      bosoms? Though some of you may think yourselves exalted to a      height that bids defiance to human justice, and others      shroud yourselves beneath the mask of hypocrisy, and build      your hopes of safety on the low arts of cunning, chicanery      and falsehood; yet do you not sometimes feel the gnawings of      that worm which never dies; do not the injured shades of      Maverick, Gray, Cadwell, Attucks and Carr,"]]]
