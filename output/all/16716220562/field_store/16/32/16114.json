Then I began wondering how much longer I would dare lie there, before the Orderly Sergeant would draw me out by the heels, and accompany the operation with numerous unkind and sulphurous remarks.  This cogitation, was abruptly terminated by hearing an excited shout from the Captain:  “Turn Out!--COMPANY L!!  TURNOUT !  !  !”  Almost at the same instant rose that shrill, piercing Rebel yell, which one who has once heard it rarely forgets, and this was followed by a crashing volley from apparently a regiment of rifles.  I arose-promptly.  There was evidently something of more interest on hand than the weather.  Cap, overcoat, boots and revolver belt went on, and eyes opened at about the same instant.  As I snatched up my carbine, I looked out in front, and the whole woods appeared to be full of Rebels, rushing toward us, all yelling and some firing.  My Captain and First Lieutenant had taken up position on the right front of the tents, and part of the boys were running up to form a line alongside them.  The Second Lieutenant had stationed himself on a knoll on the left front, and about a third of the company was rallying around him.  My chum was a silent, sententious sort of a chap, and as we ran forward to the Captain's line, he remarked earnestly:  “Well: this beats hell!”  I thought he had a clear idea of the situation.  All this occupied an inappreciably short space of time.  The Rebels had not stopped to reload, but were rushing impetuously toward us.  We gave them a hot, rolling volley from our carbines.  Many fell, more stopped to load and reply, but the mass surged straight forward at us.  Then our fire grew so deadly that they showed a disposition to cover themselves behind the rocks and trees.  Again they were urged forward; and a body of them headed by their Colonel, mounted on a white horse, pushed forward through the gap between us and the Second Lieutenant.  The Rebel Colonel dashed up to the Second Lieutenant, and ordered him to surrender.  The latter-a gallant old graybeard--cursed the Rebel bitterly and snapped his now empty revolver in his face.  The Colonel fired and killed him, whereupon his squad, with two of its Sergeants killed and half its numbers on the ground, surrendered.  The Rebels in our front and flank pressed us with equal closeness. It seemed as if it was absolutely impossible to check their rush for an instant, and as we saw the fate of our companions the Captain gave the word for every man to look out for himself.  We ran back a little distance, sprang over the fence into the fields, and rushed toward Town, the Rebels encouraging us to make good time by a sharp fire into our backs from the fence.  While we were vainly attempting to stem the onset of the column dashed against us, better success was secured elsewhere.  Another column swept down the other road, upon which there was only an outlying picket.  This had to come back on the run before the overwhelming numbers, and the Rebels galloped straight for the three-inch Rodman.  Company M was the first to get saddled and mounted, and now came up at a steady, swinging gallop, in two platoons, saber and revolver in hand, and led by two Sergeants-Key and McWright,--printer boys from Bloomington, Illinois. They divined the object of the Rebel dash, and strained every nerve to reach the gun first.  The Rebels were too near, and got the gun and turned it.  Before they could fire it, Company M struck them headlong, but they took the terrible impact without flinching, and for a few minutes there was fierce hand-to-hand work, with sword and pistol. The Rebel leader sank under a half-dozen simultaneous wounds, and fell dead almost under the gun.  Men dropped from their horses each instant, and the riderless steeds fled away.  The scale of victory was turned by the Major dashing against the Rebel left flank at the head of Company I, and a portion of the artillery squad.  The Rebels gave ground slowly, and were packed into a dense mass in the lane up which they had charged. After they had been crowded back, say fifty yards, word was passed through our men to open to the right and left on the sides of the road. The artillerymen had turned the gun and loaded it with a solid shot. Instantly a wide lane opened through our ranks; the man with the lanyard drew the fatal cord, fire burst from the primer and the muzzle, the long gun sprang up and recoiled, and there seemed to be a demoniac yell in its ear-splitting crash, as the heavy ball left the mouth, and tore its bloody way through the bodies of the struggling mass of men and horses.  This ended it.  The Rebels gave way in disorder, and our men fell back to give the gun an opportunity to throw shell and canister.  The Rebels now saw that we were not to be run over like a field of cornstalks, and they fell back to devise further tactics, giving us a breathing spell to get ourselves in shape for defense.  The dullest could see that we were in a desperate situation.  Critical positions were no new experience to us, as they never are to a cavalry command after a few months in the field, but, though the pitcher goes often to the well, it is broken at last, and our time was evidently at hand.  The narrow throat of the Valley, through which lay the road back to the Gap, was held by a force of Rebels evidently much superior to our own, and strongly posted.  The road was a slender, tortuous one, winding through rocks and gorges.  Nowhere was there room enough to move with even a platoon front against the enemy, and this precluded all chances of cutting out.  The best we could do was a slow, difficult movement, in column of fours, and this would have been suicide.  On the other side of the Town the Rebels were massed stronger, while to the right and left rose the steep mountain sides.  We were caught-trapped as surely as a rat ever was in a wire trap.  As we learned afterwards, a whole division of cavalry, under command of the noted Rebel, Major General Sam Jones, had been sent to effect our capture, to offset in a measure Longstreet's repulse at Knoxville. A gross overestimate of our numbers had caused the sending of so large a force on this errand, and the rough treatment we gave the two columns that attacked us first confirmed the Rebel General's ideas of our strength, and led him to adopt cautious tactics, instead of crushing us out speedily, by a determined advance of all parts of his encircling lines.  The lull in the fight did not last long.  A portion of the Rebel line on the east rushed forward to gain a more commanding position.  We concentrated in that direction and drove it back, the Rodman assisting with a couple of well-aimed shells.--This was followed by a similar but more successful attempt by another part of the Rebel line, and so it went on all day--the Rebels rushing up first on this side, and then on that, and we, hastily collecting at the exposed points, seeking to drive them back.  We were frequently successful; we were on the inside, and had the advantage of the short interior lines, so that our few men and our breech-loaders told to a good purpose.  There were frequent crises in the struggle, that at some times gave encouragement, but never hope.  Once a determined onset was made from the East, and was met by the equally determined resistance of nearly our whole force.  Our fire was so galling that a large number of our foes crowded into a house on a knoll, and making loopholes in its walls, began replying to us pretty sharply.  We sent word to our faithful artillerists, who trained the gun upon the house.  The first shell screamed over the roof, and burst harmlessly beyond.  We suspended fire to watch the next.  It crashed through the side; for an instant all was deathly still; we thought it had gone on through.  Then came a roar and a crash; the clapboards flew off the roof, and smoke poured out; panic-stricken Rebels rushed from the doors and sprang from the windows --like bees from a disturbed hive; the shell had burst among the confined mass of men inside!  We afterwards heard that twenty-five were killed there.  At another time a considerable force of rebels gained the cover of a fence in easy range of our main force.  Companies L and K were ordered to charge forward on foot and dislodge them.  Away we went, under a fire that seemed to drop a man at every step.  A hundred yards in front of the Rebels was a little cover, and behind this our men lay down as if by one impulse.  Then came a close, desperate duel at short range.  It was a question between Northern pluck and Southern courage, as to which could stand the most punishment.  Lying as flat as possible on the crusted snow, only raising the head or body enough to load and aim, the men on both sides, with their teeth set, their glaring eyes fastened on the foe, their nerves as tense as tightly-drawn steel wires, rained shot on each other as fast as excited hands could crowd cartridges into the guns and discharge them.  Not a word was said.  The shallower enthusiasm that expresses itself in oaths and shouts had given way to the deep, voiceless rage of men in a death grapple.  The Rebel line was a rolling torrent of flame, their bullets shrieked angrily as they flew past, they struck the snow in front of us, and threw its cold flakes in faces that were white with the fires of consuming hate; they buried themselves with a dull thud in the quivering bodies of the enraged combatants.  Minutes passed; they seemed hours.  Would the villains, scoundrels, hell-hounds, sons of vipers never go?  At length a few Rebels sprang up and tried to fly.  They were shot down instantly.  Then the whole line rose and ran!  The relief"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3072"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons (#6)"],["body","so great that we jumped to our feet and cheered wildly, forgetting in our excitement to make use of our victory by shooting down our flying enemies.  Nor was an element of fun lacking.  A Second Lieutenant was ordered to take a party of skirmishers to the top of a hill and engage those of the Rebels stationed on another hill-top across a ravine.  He had but lately joined us from the Regular Army, where he was a Drill Sergeant. Naturally, he was very methodical in his way, and scorned to do otherwise under fire than he would upon the parade ground.  He moved his little command to the hill-top, in close order, and faced them to the front. The Johnnies received them with a yell and a volley, whereat the boys winced a little, much to the Lieutenant's disgust, who swore at them; then had them count off with great deliberation, and deployed them as coolly as if them was not an enemy within a hundred miles.  After the line deployed, he “dressed” it, commanded “Front!” and “Begin, firing!”  his attention was called another way for an instant, and when he looked back again, there was not a man of his nicely formed skirmish line visible.  The logs and stones had evidently been put there for the use of skirmishers, the boys thought, and in an instant they availed themselves of their shelter.  Never was there an angrier man than that Second Lieutenant; he brandished his saber and swore; he seemed to feel that all his soldierly reputation was gone, but the boys stuck to their shelter for all that, informing him that when the Rebels would stand out in the open field and take their fire, they would likewise.  Despite all our efforts, the Rebel line crawled up closer an closer to us; we were driven back from knoll to knoll, and from one fence after another.  We had maintained the unequal struggle for eight hours; over one-fourth of our number were stretched upon the snow, killed or badly wounded.  Our cartridges were nearly all gone; the cannon had fired its last shot long ago, and having a blank cartridge left, had shot the rammer at a gathering party of the enemy.  Just as the Winter sun was going down upon a day of gloom the bugle called us all up on the hillside.  Then the Rebels saw for the first time how few there were, and began an almost simultaneous charge all along the line.  The Major raised piece of a shelter tent upon a pole.  The line halted.  An officer rode out from it, followed by two privates.  Approaching the Major, he said, “Who is in command this force?”  The Major replied: “I am.”  “Then, Sir, I demand your sword.”  “What is your rank, Sir!”  “I am Adjutant of the Sixty-fourth Virginia.”  The punctillious soul of the old “Regular”--for such the Major was swelled up instantly, and he answered:  “By ---, sir, I will never surrender to my inferior in rank!”  The Adjutant reined his horse back.  His two followers leveled their pieces at the Major and waited orders to fire.  They were covered by a dozen carbines in the hands of our men.  The Adjutant ordered his men to “recover arms,” and rode away with them.  He presently returned with a Colonel, and to him the Major handed his saber.  As the men realized what was being done, the first thought of many of them was to snatch out the cylinder's of their revolvers, and the slides of their carbines, and throw them away, so as to make the arms useless.  We were overcome with rage and humiliation at being compelled to yield to an enemy whom we had hated so bitterly.  As we stood there on the bleak mountain-side, the biting wind soughing through the leafless branches, the shadows of a gloomy winter night closing around us, the groans and shrieks of our wounded mingling with the triumphant yells of the Rebels plundering our tents, it seemed as if Fate could press to man's lips no cup with bitterer dregs in it than this.     CHAPTER V.  THE REACTION--DEPRESSION--BITTING COLD--SHARP HUNGER AND SAD REFLEXION.            “Of being taken by the Insolent foe.”--Othello.   The night that followed was inexpressibly dreary: The high-wrought nervous tension, which had been protracted through the long hours that the fight lasted, was succeeded by a proportionate mental depression, such as naturally follows any strain upon the mind.  This was intensified in our cases by the sharp sting of defeat, the humiliation of having to yield ourselves, our horses and our arms into the possession of the enemy, the uncertainty as to the future, and the sorrow we felt at the loss of so many of our comrades.  Company L had suffered very severely, but our chief regret was for the gallant Osgood, our Second Lieutenant.  He, above all others, was our trusted leader.  The Captain and First Lieutenant were brave men, and good enough soldiers, but Osgood was the one “whose adoption tried, we grappled to our souls with hooks of steel.”  There was never any difficulty in getting all the volunteers he wanted for a scouting party. A quiet, pleasant spoken gentleman, past middle age, he looked much better fitted for the office of Justice of the Peace, to which his fellow-citizens of Urbana, Illinois, had elected and reelected him, than to command a troop of rough riders in a great civil war.  But none more gallant than he ever vaulted into saddle to do battle for the right. He went into the Army solely as a matter of principle, and did his duty with the unflagging zeal of an olden Puritan fighting for liberty and his soul's salvation.  He was a superb horseman--as all the older Illinoisans are and, for all his two-score years and ten, he recognized few superiors for strength and activity in the Battalion.  A radical, uncompromising Abolitionist, he had frequently asserted that he would rather die than yield to a Rebel, and he kept his word in this as in everything else.  As for him, it was probably the way he desired to die.  No one believed more ardently than he that                 Whether on the scaffold high,                Or in the battle's van;                The fittest place for man to die,                Is where he dies for man.  Among the many who had lost chums and friends was Ned Johnson, of Company K.  Ned was a young Englishman, with much of the suggestiveness of the bull-dog common to the lower class of that nation.  His fist was readier than his tongue.  His chum, Walter Savage was of the same surly type. The two had come from England twelve years before, and had been together ever since.  Savage was killed in the struggle for the fence described in the preceding chapter.  Ned could not realize for a while that his friend was dead.  It was only when the body rapidly stiffened on its icy bed, and the eyes which had been gleaming deadly hate when he was stricken down were glazed over with the dull film of death, that he believed he was gone from him forever.  Then his rage was terrible.  For the rest of the day he was at the head of every assault upon the enemy.  His voice could ever be heard above the firing, cursing the Rebels bitterly, and urging the boys to “Stand up to 'em!  Stand right up to 'em!  Don't give a inch!  Let them have the best you got in the shop!  Shoot low, and don't waste a cartridge!”  When we surrendered, Ned seemed to yield sullenly to the inevitable. He threw his belt and apparently his revolver with it upon the snow. A guard was formed around us, and we gathered about the fires that were started.  Ned sat apart, his arms folded, his head upon his breast, brooding bitterly upon Walter's death.  A horseman, evidently a Colonel or General, clattered up to give some directions concerning us.  At the sound of his voice Ned raised his head and gave him a swift glance; the gold stars upon the Rebel's collar led him to believe that he was the commander of the enemy.  Ned sprang to his feet, made a long stride forward, snatched from the breast of his overcoat the revolver he had been hiding there, cocked it and leveled it at the Rebel's breast. Before he could pull the trigger Orderly Sergeant Charles Bentley, of his Company, who was watching him, leaped forward, caught his wrist and threw the revolver up.  Others joined in, took the weapon away, and handed it over to the officer, who then ordered us all to be searched for arms, and rode away.  All our dejection could not make us forget that we were intensely hungry. We had eaten nothing all day.  The fight began before we had time to get any breakfast, and of course there was no interval for refreshments during the engagement.  The Rebels were no better off than we, having been marched rapidly all night in order to come upon us by daylight.  Late in the evening a few sacks of meal were given us, and we took the first lesson in an art that long and painful practice afterward was to make very familiar to us.  We had nothing to mix the meal in, and it looked as if we would have to eat it dry, until a happy thought struck some one that our caps would do for kneading troughs.  At once every cap was devoted to this.  Getting water from an adjacent spring, each man made a little wad of dough--unsalted--and spreading it upon a flat stone or a chip, set it up in front of the fire to bake.  As soon as it was browned on one side, it was pulled off the stone, and the other side turned to the fire.  It was a very primitive way of cooking and I became thoroughly disgusted with it.  It was fortunate for me that I little dreamed that this was the way I should have to get my meals for the next fifteen months.  After somewhat of the edge had been taken off our hunger by this food, we crouched around the fires, talked over the events of the day, speculated as to what was to be done with us, and snatched such sleep as the biting cold would permit.
