You might sup the contents of that decanter, and you might give me a bottle of the best in your own cellar, and I'd hold myself free to oppose you at every turn still--in every vestry-meeting and justice-meeting where we encountered one another.\"  \"It is just what I should expect of you, Mr. Yorke.\"  \"Does it agree wi' ye now, Mr. Helstone, to be riding out after rioters, of a wet night, at your age?\"  \"It always agrees with me to be doing my duty; and in this case my duty is a thorough pleasure. To hunt down vermin is a noble occupation, fit for an archbishop.\"  \"Fit for ye, at ony rate. But where's t' curate? He's happen gone to visit some poor body in a sick gird, or he's happen hunting down vermin in another direction.\"  \"He is doing garrison-duty at Hollow's Mill.\"  \"You left him a sup o' wine, I hope, Bob\" (turning to Mr. Moore), \"to keep his courage up?\"  He did not pause for an answer, but continued, quickly, still addressing Moore, who had thrown himself into an old-fashioned chair by the fireside--\"Move it, Robert! Get up, my lad! That place is mine. Take the sofa, or three other chairs, if you will, but not this. It belangs to me, and nob'dy else.\"  \"Why are you so particular to that chair, Mr. Yorke?\" asked Moore, lazily vacating the place in obedience to orders.  \"My father war afore me, and that's all t' answer I sall gie thee; and it's as good a reason as Mr. Helstone can give for the main feck o' his notions.\"  \"Moore, are you ready to go?\" inquired the rector.  \"Nay; Robert's not ready, or rather, I'm not ready to part wi' him. He's an ill lad, and wants correcting.\"  \"Why, sir? What have I done?\"  \"Made thyself enemies on every hand.\"  \"What do I care for that? What difference does it make to me whether your Yorkshire louts hate me or like me?\"  \"Ay, there it is. The lad is a mak' of an alien amang us. His father would never have talked i' that way.--Go back to Antwerp, where you were born and bred, mauvaise tête!\"  \"Mauvaise tête vous-même; je ne fais que mon devoir; quant à vos lourdauds de paysans, je m'en moque!\"  \"En ravanche, mon garçon, nos lourdauds de paysans se moqueront de toi; sois en certain,\" replied Yorke, speaking with nearly as pure a French accent as Gérard Moore.  \"C'est bon! c'est bon! Et puisque cela m'est égal, que mes amis ne s'en inquiètent pas.\"  \"Tes amis! Où sont-ils, tes amis?\"  \"Je fais écho, où sont-ils? et je suis fort aise que l'écho seul y répond. Au diable les amis! Je me souviens encore du moment où mon père et mes oncles Gérard appellèrent autour d'eux leurs amis, et Dieu sait si les amis se sont empressés d'accourir à leur secours! Tenez, M. Yorke, ce mot, ami, m'irrite trop; ne m'en parlez plus.\"  \"Comme tu voudras.\"  And here Mr. Yorke held his peace; and while he sits leaning back in his three-cornered carved oak chair, I will snatch my opportunity to sketch the portrait of this French-speaking Yorkshire gentleman.     CHAPTER IV.  MR. YORKE (_continued_).   A Yorkshire gentleman he was, _par excellence_, in every point; about fifty-five years old, but looking at first sight still older, for his hair was silver white. His forehead was broad, not high; his face fresh and hale; the harshness of the north was seen in his features, as it was heard in his voice; every trait was thoroughly English--not a Norman line anywhere; it was an inelegant, unclassic, unaristocratic mould of visage. Fine people would perhaps have called it vulgar; sensible people would have termed it characteristic; shrewd people would have delighted in it for the pith, sagacity, intelligence, the rude yet real originality marked in every lineament, latent in every furrow. But it was an indocile, a scornful, and a sarcastic face--the face of a man difficult to lead, and impossible to drive. His stature was rather tall, and he was well made and wiry, and had a stately integrity of port; there was not a suspicion of the clown about him anywhere.  I did not find it easy to sketch Mr. Yorke's person, but it is more difficult to indicate his mind. If you expect to be treated to a Perfection, reader, or even to a benevolent, philanthropic old gentleman in him, you are mistaken. He has spoken with some sense and with some good feeling to Mr. Moore, but you are not thence to conclude that he always spoke and thought justly and kindly.  Mr. Yorke, in the first place, was without the organ of veneration--a great want, and which throws a man wrong on every point where veneration is required. Secondly, he was without the organ of comparison--a deficiency which strips a man of sympathy; and thirdly, he had too little of the organs of benevolence and ideality, which took the glory and softness from his nature, and for him diminished those divine qualities throughout the universe.  The want of veneration made him intolerant to those above him--kings and nobles and priests, dynasties and parliaments and establishments, with all their doings, most of their enactments, their forms, their rights, their claims, were to him an abomination, all rubbish; he found no use or pleasure in them, and believed it would be clear gain, and no damage to the world, if its high places were razed, and their occupants crushed in the fall. The want of veneration, too, made him dead at heart to the electric delight of admiring what is admirable; it dried up a thousand pure sources of enjoyment; it withered a thousand vivid pleasures. He was not irreligious, though a member of no sect; but his religion could not be that of one who knows how to venerate. He believed in God and heaven; but his God and heaven were those of a man in whom awe, imagination, and tenderness lack.  The weakness of his powers of comparison made him inconsistent; while he professed some excellent general doctrines of mutual toleration and forbearance, he cherished towards certain classes a bigoted antipathy. He spoke of \"parsons\" and all who belonged to parsons, of \"lords\" and the appendages of lords, with a harshness, sometimes an insolence, as unjust as it was insufferable. He could not place himself in the position of those he vituperated; he could not compare their errors with their temptations, their defects with their disadvantages; he could not realize the effect of such and such circumstances on himself similarly situated, and he would often express the most ferocious and tyrannical wishes regarding those who had acted, as he thought, ferociously and tyrannically. To judge by his threats, he would have employed arbitrary, even cruel, means to advance the cause of freedom and equality. Equality! yes, Mr. Yorke talked about equality, but at heart he was a proud man--very friendly to his workpeople, very good to all who were beneath him, and submitted quietly to be beneath him, but haughty as Beelzebub to whomsoever the world deemed (for he deemed no man) his superior. Revolt was in his blood: he could not bear control; his father, his grandfather before him, could not bear it, and his children after him never could.  The want of general benevolence made him very impatient of imbecility, and of all faults which grated on his strong, shrewd nature; it left no check to his cutting sarcasm. As he was not merciful, he would sometimes wound and wound again, without noticing how much he hurt, or caring how deep he thrust.  As to the paucity of ideality in his mind, that can scarcely be called a fault: a fine ear for music, a correct eye for colour and form, left him the quality of taste; and who cares for imagination? Who does not think it a rather dangerous, senseless attribute, akin to weakness, perhaps partaking of frenzy--a disease rather than a gift of the mind?  Probably all think it so but those who possess, or fancy they possess, it. To hear them speak, you would believe that their hearts would be cold if that elixir did not flow about them, that their eyes would be dim if that flame did not refine their vision, that they would be lonely if this strange companion abandoned them. You would suppose that it imparted some glad hope to spring, some fine charm to summer, some tranquil joy to autumn, some consolation to winter, which you do not feel. An illusion, of course; but the fanatics cling to their dream, and would not give it for gold.  As Mr. Yorke did not possess poetic imagination himself, he considered it a most superfluous quality in others. Painters and musicians he could tolerate, and even encourage, because he could relish the results of their art; he could see the charm of a fine picture, and feel the pleasure of good music; but a quiet poet--whatever force struggled, whatever fire glowed, in his breast--if he could not have played the man in the counting-house, of the tradesman in the Piece Hall, might have lived despised, and died scorned, under the eyes of Hiram Yorke.  And as there are many Hiram Yorkes in the world, it is well that the true poet, quiet externally though he may be, has often a truculent spirit under his placidity, and is full of shrewdness in his meekness, and can measure the whole stature of those who look down on him, and correctly ascertain the weight and value of the pursuits they disdain him for not having followed. It is happy that he can have his own bliss, his own society with his great friend and goddess Nature, quite independent of those who find little pleasure in him, and in whom he finds no pleasure at all. It is just that while the world and circumstances often turn a dark, cold side to him--and properly, too, because he first turns a dark, cold, careless side to them--he should be able to maintain a festal brightness and cherishing glow in his bosom, which makes all bright and genial for him;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30491"],["title","Vital Ingredient (#0)"],["body","is man's most precious possession--no living thing can exist     without it. But when they gave it to Orville, it killed him. For the     answer, read 1/M._           Vital       Ingredient   By Charles V. De Vet   \"Now watch,\" Remm said, indicating the native. Macker had been absent, exploring the countryside in the immediate vicinity of their landing place, and had not witnessed the capture of the native, or the tests his two companions made on it.  Macker followed Remm's gaze to where the biped native sat hunched. The creature was bent into an ungainly position, its body crooked at incongruous angles, in such a way as to allow most of its weight to rest on a packing-box at the base of a middle angle. Its stubby feet, on the ends of thin, pipelike legs, rested against the floor of the space ship. Its body was covered, almost entirely, with an artificial skin material of various colors. Some of the colors hurt Macker's eyes. In the few places where the flesh showed through the skin was an unhealthy, pallid white.  Slowly the creature's head swiveled on its short neck until it faced them.  \"Those orifices in the upper portion of its skull are evidently organs of sight,\" Remm said. \"It sees that we are quite a distance away. It will probably attempt to escape again.\"  Slowly--slowly--the native's head rotated away from them in a half-circle until it faced Toolls, working over his instruments on the far side of the room. Then it turned its head back until it faced the door of the ship.  \"It is setting itself for flight now,\" Remm said. \"Notice the evidence of strain on its face.\"  The creature leaned forward and the appendages on the ends of its upper limbs clutched the sides of the box as it propelled its body forward.  It raised its right foot in a slow arc, employing a double-jointed, breaking action of its leg. For a long moment it rested its entire weight on its lumpy right foot, while its momentum carried its body sluggishly forward. Then it repeated the motion with its left leg; then again its right. All the while evidencing great exertion and concentration of effort.  \"It is making what it considers a mad dash for freedom,\" Remm said. \"Probably at the ultimate speed of which it is capable. That would be ridiculous except that it's normal for its own environment. This is definitely a slow-motion world.\"  The creature was a third-way to the door now. Once again its head turned in its slow quarter-circle, to look at them. As it saw that Remm and Macker had not moved it altered the expression on its face.  \"It seems to express its emotions through facial contortions,\" Remm said. \"Though I suspect that the sounds it makes with the upper part of its trachea during moments of agitation are also outlets of emotional stress, rather than efforts at communication.\" He called across the room to Toolls. \"What did you find out about its speech?\"  \"Extremely primitive,\" Toolls replied. \"Incredible as it may appear to us it uses combinations of sounds to form word-symbols. Each word indicates some action, or object; or denotes degree, time, or shades of meaning. Other words are merely connectives. It seems to make little use of inflections, the basis of a rational language. Thoughts which we can project with a few sounds would take it dozens of words to express.\"  \"Just how intelligent is it?\" Macker asked.  \"Only as intelligent as a high degree of self-preservation instinct would make it.\"  \"Are you certain that it is a member of the dominant species of life on the planet?\"  \"There's no doubt about it,\" Toolls replied. \"I've made very careful observations.\"  \"This attempt at escape is a pretty good example of its intelligence,\" Remm said. \"This is the sixth time it has tried to escape--in exactly the same way. As soon as it sees that we are farther away from it than it is from the door, it makes its dash.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The creature was one step away from the space ship's open portal now and bringing its foot up to cross the threshold. Remm walked over and lifted it off the floor.  \"Its legs are still moving in a running motion,\" Macker said. \"Doesn't it realize yet that you've picked it up?\"  [Illustration: _It was an arm to be proud of--but what good was it?_]  \"Its nervous system and reflexes are evidently as slow as its motor muscles,\" Remm replied. \"There has not been time for the sensation of my picking it up to reach the brain, and for the brain to send back its message to the legs to stop their running motion.\"  \"How heavy is it?\" Macker asked.  \"Only a few ounces,\" Remm replied. \"But that's logical considering that this is a 'light' planet. If we took it back to our own 'heavy' world, gravity would crush it to a light film of the liquid which comprises the greater part of its substance.\"  Remm set the creature down on the box in its former queerly contorted position. Toolls had left his instruments and strolled over beside them to observe the native.  \"One of its appendages seems bent at a peculiar angle,\" Macker said.  \"I noticed that,\" Remm answered. \"I think that I may have broken the bone in several places when I first captured it. I was not aware then of how fragile it was. But now that you mention it, I should be able to use that injury to give you a good illustration of the interplay of emotional expressions on its face. Observe now as I touch it.\"  Remm reached over and touched--very lightly--the broken portion of the native's appendage. The muscles of the creature's face pulled its flaccid flesh into distorted positions, bunching some and stretching others. \"It is very probably registering pain,\" Remm said.  Suddenly the starch seemed to leave the native's body and it slowly slumped across the packing-box.  \"Why is it doing that, Toolls?\" Remm asked.  Toolls concentrated for a minute, absorbing the feelings and thought pulsations emanating from the creature. \"The conscious plane of its mind has blanked out,\" he said. \"I presume the pain you caused by touching its wounded member resulted in a breakdown of its nervous system. The only thought waves I receive now are disjointed impressions and pictures following no rational series. However, I'm certain that it will be only temporary.\"  \"Don't you think that in justice to the creature we should repair its wound before we free it?\" Macker asked.  \"I had intended to have it done,\" Remm replied. \"You shouldn't have any trouble fixing it, should you, Toolls?\"  \"No,\" Toolls answered. \"I may as well attend to it right now.\" He rolled the portable _converter_ over beside the creature and carefully laid its arm in the \"pan.\" The _converter_ automatically set its gauges and instruments of calculation, and gave its click of \"ready.\"  Toolls fed a short length of _basic_ into the machine and it began its work. The native was still unconscious.  The bone of the wounded arm slowly evaporated, beginning with the wrist joint. The evaporated portion was instantly replaced by the manufactured bone of the _converter_. At the same time it repaired all ruptured blood vessels and damaged ligaments and muscles.  \"It was not possible, of course, for me to replace the bone with another of the same composition as its own,\" Toolls said, after the machine had completed its work. \"But I gave it one of our 'heavy' ones. There will be no force on this planet powerful enough to break it again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The native's first evidence of a return to consciousness was a faint fluttering of the lids that covered its organs of vision. The lids opened and it looked up at them.  \"Its eyesight is as slow as its muscular reactions,\" Remm said. \"Watch.\" Remm raised his hand and waved it slowly in front of the native's face. The eyes of the native, moving in odd, jerking movements, followed the hand's progress. Remm raised the hand--speeding its action slightly--and the eyesight faltered and lost it. The native's eyes rolled wildly until once again they located the hand.  Remm took three steps forward. The native's eyes were unable to follow his change of position. Its gaze wandered about the room, until again its settled on Remm's waiting figure.  \"Can you imagine anything being so slow,\" Remm said, \"and still ...\" Suddenly Macker interrupted. \"Something is wrong. It is trying to get up, but it can't.\" The native was registering signs of distress, kicking its legs and twisting its body into new positions of contortion.  \"I see what the trouble is,\" Toolls said. \"It's unable to lift the appendage with the new bone in. I never thought of that before but its 'light' muscles aren't strong enough to lift the limb. We've got the poor creature pinned to the box by the weight of its own arm.\"  \"We can't do that to it,\" Remm said. \"Isn't there any way you can give it a lighter bone?\"  \"None that wouldn't take a retooling of the _converter_,\" Toolls said. \"I'm not certain that I could do it, and even if I could, we don't have the time to spare. I could give it stronger muscles in the arm, but that may throw off the metabolism of the whole body. If it did, the result would be fatal. I'd hate to chance it.\"  \"I have an idea,\" Macker said. By the inflections of his tones the others knew that some incongruity of the situation had aroused Macker's sense of humor. \"Why don't we give the creature an entirely new body? We could replace the flesh and viscera, as well as the cartilaginous structure, with our own type substance. It would probably be an indestructible being as far as its own world is concerned. And it would be as powerful as their mightiest machines. We'd leave behind us a superman that could change the course of this world's history. You could do it, couldn't you, Toolls?\"  \"Quite simply.\"  \"Our policy has always been not to interfere in anyway with the races we study,\" Remm protested.  \"But our policy has also been never to harm any of them, if at all possible to avoid it,\" Macker insisted. \"In common justice you have to complete"]]]
