As we were preparing to set out a Sergeant of the First Virginia cavalry came galloping up to us on my horse!  The sight of my faithful “Hiatoga”  bestrid by a Rebel, wrung my heart.  During the action I had forgotten him, but when it ceased I began to worry about his fate.  As he and his rider came near I called out to him; he stopped and gave a whinny of recognition, which seemed also a plaintive appeal for an explanation of the changed condition of affairs.  The Sergeant was a pleasant, gentlemanly boy of about my own age. He rode up to me and inquired if it was my horse, to which I replied in the affirmative, and asked permission to take from the saddle pockets some letters, pictures and other trinkets.  He granted this, and we became friends from thence on until we separated.  He rode by my side as we plodded over the steep, slippery hills, and we beguiled the way by chatting of the thousand things that soldiers find to talk about, and exchanged reminiscences of the service on both sides.  But the subject he was fondest of was that which I relished least: my--now his--horse.  Into the open ulcer of my heart he poured the acid of all manner of questions concerning my lost steed's qualities and capabilities: would he swim? how was he in fording?  did he jump well!  how did he stand fire? I smothered my irritation, and answered as pleasantly as I could.  In the afternoon of the third day after the capture, we came up to where a party of rustic belles were collected at “quilting.”  The “Yankees”  were instantly objects of greater interest than the parade of a menagerie would have been.  The Sergeant told the girls we were going to camp for the night a mile or so ahead, and if they would be at a certain house, he would have a Yankee for them for close inspection.  After halting, the Sergeant obtained leave to take me out with a guard, and I was presently ushered into a room in which the damsels were massed in force, --a carnation-checked, staring, open-mouthed, linsey-clad crowd, as ignorant of corsets and gloves as of Hebrew, and with a propensity to giggle that was chronic and irrepressible.  When we entered the room there was a general giggle, and then a shower of comments upon my appearance,--each sentence punctuated with the chorus of feminine cachination.  A remark was made about my hair and eyes, and their risibles gave way; judgment was passed on my nose, and then came a ripple of laughter.  I got very red in the face, and uncomfortable generally. Attention was called to the size of my feet and hands, and the usual chorus followed.  Those useful members of my body seemed to swell up as they do to a young man at his first party.  Then I saw that in the minds of these bucolic maidens I was scarcely, if at all, human; they did not understand that I belonged to the race; I was a “Yankee”--a something of the non-human class, as the gorilla or the chimpanzee.  They felt as free to discuss my points before my face as they would to talk of a horse or a wild animal in a show.  My equanimity was partially restored by this reflection, but I was still too young to escape embarrassment and irritation at being thus dissected and giggled at by a party of girls, even if they were ignorant Virginia mountaineers.  I turned around to speak to the Sergeant, and in so doing showed my back to the ladies.  The hum of comment deepened into surprise, that half stopped and then intensified the giggle.  I was puzzled for a minute, and then the direction of their glances, and their remarks explained it all.  At the rear of the lower part of the cavalry jacket, about where the upper ornamental buttons are on the tail of a frock coat, are two funny tabs, about the size of small pin-cushions.  They are fastened by the edge, and stick out straight behind. Their use is to support the heavy belt in the rear, as the buttons do in front.  When the belt is off it would puzzle the Seven Wise Men to guess what they are for.  The unsophisticated young ladies, with that swift intuition which is one of lovely woman's salient mental traits, immediately jumped at the conclusion that the projections covered some peculiar conformation of the Yankee anatomy--some incipient, dromedary-like humps, or perchance the horns of which they had heard so much.  This anatomical phenomena was discussed intently for a few minutes, during which I heard one of the girls inquire whether “it would hurt him to cut 'em off?” and another hazarded the opinion that “it would probably bleed him to death.”  Then a new idea seized them, and they said to the Sergeant “Make him sing!  Make him sing!”  This was too much for the Sergeant, who had been intensely amused at the girls' wonderment.  He turned to me, very red in the face, with:  “Sergeant: the girls want to hear you sing.”  I replied that I could not sing a note.  Said he:  “Oh, come now.  I know better than that; I never seed or heerd of a Yankee that couldn't sing.”  I nevertheless assured him that there really were some Yankees that did not have any musical accomplishments, and that I was one of that unfortunate number.  I asked him to get the ladies to sing for me, and to this they acceded quite readily.  One girl, with a fair soprano, who seemed to be the leader of the crowd, sang “The Homespun Dress,” a song very popular in the South, and having the same tune as the “Bonnie Blue Flag.”  It began,                 I envy not the Northern girl                Their silks and jewels fine,  and proceeded to compare the homespun habiliments of the Southern women to the finery and frippery of the ladies on the other side of Mason and Dixon's line in a manner very disadvantageous to the latter.  The rest of the girls made a fine exhibition of the lung-power acquired in climbing their precipitous mountains, when they came in on the chorus                 Hurra!  Hurra! for southern rights Hurra!                Hurra for the homespun dress,                The Southern ladies wear.  This ended the entertainment.  On our journey to Bristol we met many Rebel soldiers, of all ranks, and a small number of citizens.  As the conscription had then been enforced pretty sharply for over a year the only able-bodied men seen in civil life were those who had some trade which exempted them from being forced into active service.  It greatly astonished us at first to find that nearly all the mechanics were included among the exempts, or could be if they chose; but a very little reflection showed us the wisdom of such a policy.  The South is as nearly a purely agricultural country as is Russia or South America.  The people have, little inclination or capacity for anything else than pastoral pursuits.  Consequently mechanics are very scarce, and manufactories much scarcer.  The limited quantity of products of mechanical skill needed by the people was mostly imported from the North or Europe.  Both these sources of supply were cutoff by the war, and the country was thrown upon its own slender manufacturing resources.  To force its mechanics into the army would therefore be suicidal.  The Army would gain a few thousand men, but its operations would be embarrassed, if not stopped altogether, by a want of supplies.  This condition of affairs reminded one of the singular paucity of mechanical skill among the Bedouins of the desert, which renders the life of a blacksmith sacred.  No matter how bitter the feud between tribes, no one will kill the other's workers of iron, and instances are told of warriors saving their lives at critical periods by falling on their knees and making with their garments an imitation of the action of a smith's bellows.  All whom we met were eager to discuss with us the causes, phases and progress of the war, and whenever opportunity offered or could be made, those of us who were inclined to talk were speedily involved in an argument with crowds of soldiers and citizens.  But, owing to the polemic poverty of our opponents, the argument was more in name than in fact. Like all people of slender or untrained intellectual powers they labored under the hallucination that asserting was reasoning, and the emphatic reiteration of bald statements, logic.  The narrow round which all from highest to lowest--traveled was sometimes comical, and sometimes irritating, according to one's mood!  The dispute invariably began by their asking:  “Well, what are you 'uns down here a-fightin' we 'uns for?”  As this was replied to the newt one followed:  “Why are you'uns takin' our niggers away from we 'uns for?”  Then came:  “What do you 'uns put our niggers to fightin' we'uns for?”  The windup always was: “Well, let me tell you, sir, you can never whip people that are fighting for liberty, sir.”  Even General Giltner, who had achieved considerable military reputation as commander of a division of Kentucky cavalry, seemed to be as slenderly furnished with logical ammunition as the balance, for as he halted by us he opened the conversation with the well-worn formula:  “Well: what are you 'uns down here a-fighting we'uns for?”  The question had become raspingly monotonous to me, whom he addressed, and I replied with marked acerbity:  “Because we are the Northern mudsills whom you affect to despise, and we came down here to lick you into respecting us.”  The answer seemed to tickle him, a pleasanter light came into his sinister gray eyes, he laughed lightly, and bade us a kindly good day.  Four days after our capture we arrived in Bristol.  The guards who had brought us over the mountains were relieved by others, the Sergeant bade me good by, struck his spurs into “Hiatoga's” sides, and he and my faithful horse were soon lost to view in the darkness.  A new and keener sense of desolation came over me at the final separation from my tried and true four-fo"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3072"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons (#8)"],["body","friend, who had been my constant companion through so many perils and hardships.  We had endured together the Winter's cold, the dispiriting drench of the rain, the fatigue of the long march, the discomforts of the muddy camp, the gripings of hunger, the weariness of the drill and review, the perils of the vidette post, the courier service, the scout and the fight.  We had shared in common                 The whips and scorns of time,                The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,                The insolence of office, and the spurns  which a patient private and his horse of the unworthy take; we had had our frequently recurring rows with other fellows and their horses, over questions of precedence at watering places, and grass-plots, had had lively tilts with guards of forage piles in surreptitious attempts to get additional rations, sometimes coming off victorious and sometimes being driven off ingloriously.  I had often gone hungry that he might have the only ear of corn obtainable.  I am not skilled enough in horse lore to speak of his points or pedigree.  I only know that his strong limbs never failed me, and that he was always ready for duty and ever willing.  Now at last our paths diverged.  I was retired from actual service to a prison, and he bore his new master off to battle against his old friends.                 ...........................  Packed closely in old, dilapidated stock and box cars, as if cattle in shipment to market, we pounded along slowly, and apparently interminably, toward the Rebel capital.  The railroads of the South were already in very bad condition.  They were never more than passably good, even in their best estate, but now, with a large part of the skilled men engaged upon them escaped back to the North, with all renewal, improvement, or any but the most necessary repairs stopped for three years, and with a marked absence of even ordinary skill and care in their management, they were as nearly ruined as they could well be and still run.  One of the severe embarrassments under which the roads labored was a lack of oil.  There is very little fatty matter of any kind in the South. The climate and the food plants do not favor the accumulation of adipose tissue by animals, and there is no other source of supply.  Lard oil and tallow were very scarce and held at exorbitant prices.  Attempts were made to obtain lubricants from the peanut and the cotton seed.  The first yielded a fine bland oil, resembling the ordinary grade of olive oil, but it was entirely too expensive for use in the arts. The cotton seed oil could be produced much cheaper, but it had in it such a quantity of gummy matter as to render it worse than useless for employment on machinery.  This scarcity of oleaginous matter produced a corresponding scarcity of soap and similar detergents, but this was a deprivation which caused the Rebels, as a whole, as little inconvenience as any that they suffered from.  I have seen many thousands of them who were obviously greatly in need of soap, but if they were rent with any suffering on that account they concealed it with marvelous self-control.  There seemed to be a scanty supply of oil provided for the locomotives, but the cars had to run with unlubricated axles, and the screaking and groaning of the grinding journals in the dry boxes was sometimes almost deafening, especially when we were going around a curve.  Our engine went off the wretched track several times, but as she was not running much faster than a man could walk, the worst consequence to us was a severe jolting.  She was small, and was easily pried back upon the track, and sent again upon her wheezy, straining way.  The depression which had weighed us down for a night and a day after our capture had now been succeeded by a more cheerful feeling.  We began to look upon our condition as the fortune of war.  We were proud of our resistance to overwhelming numbers.  We knew we had sold ourselves at a price which, if the Rebels had it to do over again, they would not pay for us.  We believed that we had killed and seriously wounded as many of them as they had killed, wounded and captured of us.  We had nothing to blame ourselves for.  Moreover, we began to be buoyed up with the expectation that we would be exchanged immediately upon our arrival at Richmond, and the Rebel officers confidently assured us that this would be so.  There was then a temporary hitch in the exchange, but it would all be straightened out in a few days, and it might not be a month until we were again marching out of Cumberland Gap, on an avenging foray against some of the force which had assisted in our capture.  Fortunately for this delusive hopefulness there was no weird and boding Cassandra to pierce the veil of the future for us, and reveal the length and the ghastly horror of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, through which we must pass for hundreds of sad days, stretching out into long months of suffering and death.  Happily there was no one to tell us that of every five in that party four would never stand under the Stars and Stripes again, but succumbing to chronic starvation, long-continued exposure, the bullet of the brutal guard, the loathsome scurvy, the hideous gangrene, and the heartsickness of hope deferred, would find respite from pain low in the barren sands of that hungry Southern soil.  Were every doom foretokened by appropriate omens, the ravens along our route would have croaked themselves hoarse.  But, far from being oppressed by any presentiment of coming evil, we began to appreciate and enjoy the picturesque grandeur of the scenery through which we were moving.  The rugged sternness of the Appalachian mountain range, in whose rock-ribbed heart we had fought our losing fight, was now softening into less strong, but more graceful outlines as we approached the pine-clad, sandy plains of the seaboard, upon which Richmond is built.  We were skirting along the eastern base of the great Blue Ridge, about whose distant and lofty summits hung a perpetual veil of deep, dark, but translucent blue, which refracted the slanting rays of the morning and evening sun into masses of color more gorgeous than a dreamer's vision of an enchanted land.  At Lynchburg we saw the famed Peaks of Otter--twenty miles away--lifting their proud heads far into the clouds, like giant watch-towers sentineling the gateway that the mighty waters of the James had forced through the barriers of solid adamant lying across their path to the far-off sea.  What we had seen many miles back start from the mountain sides as slender rivulets, brawling over the worn boulders, were now great, rushing, full-tide streams, enough of them in any fifty miles of our journey to furnish water power for all the factories of New England.  Their amazing opulence of mechanical energy has lain unutilized, almost unnoticed; in the two and one-half centuries that the white man has dwelt near them, while in Massachusetts and her near neighbors every rill that can turn a wheel has been put into harness and forced to do its share of labor for the benefit of the men who have made themselves its masters.  Here is one of the differences between the two sections: In the North man was set free, and the elements made to do his work.  In the South man was the degraded slave, and the elements wantoned on in undisturbed freedom.  As we went on, the Valleys of the James and the Appomattox, down which our way lay, broadened into an expanse of arable acres, and the faces of those streams were frequently flecked by gem-like little islands.     CHAPTER VII.  ENTERING RICHMOND--DISAPPOINTMENT AT ITS APPEARANCE--EVERYBODY IN UNIFORM--CURLED DARLINGS OF THE CAPITAL--THE REBEL FLAG--LIBBY PRISON --DICK TURNER--SEARCHING THE NEW COMERS.  Early on the tenth morning after our capture we were told that we were about to enter Richmond.  Instantly all were keenly observant of every detail in the surroundings of a City that was then the object of the hopes and fears of thirty-five millions of people--a City assailing which seventy-five thousand brave men had already laid down their lives, defending which an equal number had died, and which, before it fell, was to cost the life blood of another one hundred and fifty thousand valiant assailants and defenders.  So much had been said and written about Richmond that our boyish minds had wrought up the most extravagant expectations of it and its defenses. We anticipated seeing a City differing widely from anything ever seen before; some anomaly of nature displayed in its site, itself guarded by imposing and impregnable fortifications, with powerful forts and heavy guns, perhaps even walls, castles, postern gates, moats and ditches, and all the other panoply of defensive warfare, with which romantic history had made us familiar.  We were disappointed--badly disappointed--in seeing nothing of this as we slowly rolled along.  The spires and the tall chimneys of the factories rose in the distance very much as they had in other Cities we had visited.  We passed a single line of breastworks of bare yellow sand, but the scrubby pines in front were not cut away, and there were no signs that there had ever been any immediate expectation of use for the works. A redoubt or two--without guns--could be made out, and this was all. Grim-visaged war had few wrinkles on his front in that neighborhood. They were then seaming his brow on the Rappahannock, seventy miles away, where the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac lay confronting each other.  At one of the stopping places I had been separated from my companions by entering a car in which were a number of East Tennesseeans, captured in the operations around Knoxville, and whom the Rebels, in accordance with their usual custom, were treating with studied contumely.  I had always had a very warm side for these simple rustics of the mountains and valleys.  I knew much of their unwavering "]]]
