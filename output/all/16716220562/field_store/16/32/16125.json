A man who rushes into a burning building to save a life, wearing nothing but street clothes, has courage. A man who does the same thing when he's wearing a nullotherm suit is an unknown quantity. There is no way of knowing, from that action alone, whether he has courage or not.\"  Meyer looked a little dazed. \"Pardon me if I seem thick, Mr. Stanton, but.... Are you saying that the Nipe's technological equipment is better than ours?\"  \"Not at all. I'm talking about his personal equipment.\" He turned again to the colonel. \"Colonel Mannheim, do you think it would require any personal courage on my part to stand up against you in a face-to-face gunfight?\"  The colonel grinned tightly. \"I see what you mean. No, it wouldn't.\"  \"On the other hand, if _you_ were to challenge _me_,\" Bart Stanton continued, \"would _that_ show courage?\"  \"Not really. Foolhardiness, stupidity, or insanity--not courage.\"  \"Then neither of us can prove we have guts enough to fight the other. Can we?\"  Colonel Mannheim smiled grimly and said nothing, but Meyer, who evidently had a great deal of respect for the colonel, said: \"Now, wait a second! That depends on the circumstances! If Colonel Mannheim, say, knew that forcing you to shoot him would save someone else's life--someone more important, say, or maybe a _lot_ of people, then--\"  Colonel Mannheim laughed. \"Meyer, you've just proved Mr. Stanton's point!\"  Meyer gaped for a half second, then burst into laughter himself. \"Pardon my point of view, Mr. Stanton! I guess I _am_ a little slow!\"  Mannheim said: \"Precisely! Whether the Nipe has courage or patience or any other human feeling depends on his own abilities and on how much information he has. A man can perform any action without fear if he knows that it will not hurt him--or if he does _not_ know that it _will_.\" He glanced at the screen. The Nipe had settled down into his \"sleeping position\"--unmoving, although his baleful violet eyes were still open. \"Cut that off, Meyer,\" the colonel said. \"There's not much to learn from the rest of that tape.\"  \"Have you actually managed to build any of the devices he's constructed?\" Stanton asked.  \"Some,\" said Colonel Mannheim. \"We have specialists all over the world studying the tapes. We have the advantage of being able to watch every step the Nipe makes, and we know the materials he's using to work with. But, even so, the scientists are baffled by many of them. Can you imagine the time James Clerk Maxwell would have had trying to build a modern television set from tapes like this?\"  [Illustration]  \"I know exactly how he'd feel,\" Meyer said glumly.  \"You can see, then, why we're depending on you,\" Mannheim told Stanton.  Stanton merely nodded. The knowledge that he was actually a focal point in human history, that the whole future of the human race depended to a tremendous extent on him, was a realization that weighed heavily, and, at the same time, was immensely bracing.  \"And now,\" the colonel said, \"I'll turn you over to the psychology department. They'll be able to give you a great deal more information on the Nipe than I can.\"   VI  The Nipe squatted, brooding, in his underground nest, waiting for the special crystallization process to take place in the sodium-gold alloy that was forming in the reactor.  _How long?_ he wondered. He was not thinking of the crystallization reaction; he knew the timing of that to the fraction of a second. His dark thoughts were focused inwardly, upon himself.  How long would it be before he would be able to construct the communicator that would put him in touch with his own race again? How long before he could discourse again with reasonable beings? For how much longer would he be stranded on an insane planet, surrounded by degraded, insane beings?  The work was going incredibly slowly. He had known at the beginning that his knowledge of the basic arts required to build a communicator was incomplete, but he had not realized just how painfully inadequate it was. Time after time, his instruments had simply refused to function because of some basic flaw in their manufacture--some flaw that an expert in that field could have pointed out at once. Time after time, equipment had had to be rebuilt almost from the beginning. And, time after time, only cut-and-try methods were available for correcting his errors.  Not even his prodigious and accurate memory could hold all the information that was necessary for the work, and there were no reference tapes available, of course.  He had long since given up any attempt to understand the functioning of the mad pseudo-civilization that surrounded him. He was quite certain that the beings he had seen could not possibly be the real rulers of this society, but he had, as yet, no inkling as to who the real rulers were.  As to _where_ they were, that question seemed a little easier to answer. It was highly probable that they were out in space, on the asteriods that his instruments had detected as he had dropped in toward this planet so many years before. He had made an error back then in not landing in the Belt, but at no time since had he experienced the emotion of regret or wished he had done differently; both thoughts would have been incomprehensible to the Nipe. He had made an error; the circumstances had been checked and noted; he would not make that error again.  What further action could be taken by a logical mind?  None. The past was unchangeable. It existed only as a memory in his own mind, and there was no way to change that indelible record, even had he wished to do such an insane thing.  Surely, he thought, the real rulers must know of his existence. He had tried, by his every action, to show that he was a reasoning, intelligent, and civilized being. Why had they taken no action?  His hypotheses, he realized, were weak because of lack of data. He could only wait for more information.  That--and continue to work.   VII  INTERLUDE  Mrs. Frobisher touched the control button that depolarized the window in the breakfast room, letting the morning sun stream in. Then she said, in a low voice, \"Larry, come here.\"  Larry Frobisher looked up from his morning coffee. \"What is it, hon?\"  \"The Stanton boys. Come look.\"  Frobisher sighed. \"Who are the Stanton boys, and why should I come look?\" But he got up and came over to the window.  \"See--over there on the walkway toward the play area,\" she said.  \"I see three girls and a boy pushing a wheeled contraption,\" Frobisher said. \"Or do you mean that the Stanford boys are dressed up as girls?\"  \"_Stanton_,\" she corrected him. \"They just moved into the apartment on the first floor.\"  \"Who? The three girls?\"  \"No, silly! The two Stanton boys and their mother. One of them is in that 'wheeled contraption'. It's called a therapeutic chair.\"  \"Oh? So the poor kid's been hurt. What's so interesting about that, aside from morbid curiosity?\"  The boy pushing the chair went around a bend in the walkway, out of sight, and Frobisher went back to his coffee while his wife spoke.  \"Their names are Mart and Bart. They're twins.\"  \"I should think,\" Frobisher said, applying himself to his breakfast, \"that the mother would get a self-powered chair for the boy instead of making the other boy push it.\"  \"The poor boy can't control the chair, dear. Something wrong with his nervous system. I understand that he was exposed to some kind of radiation when he was only two years old. That's why the chair has all the instruments built into it. Even his heartbeat has to be controlled electronically.\"  \"Shame.\" Frobisher speared a bit of sausage. \"Kind of rough on both of 'em, I'd guess.\"  \"How do you mean?\"  \"Well, I mean, like.... Well, for instance, why are they going over to the play area? Play games, right? The one that's well has to push his brother over there--can't just get out and go; has to take the brother along. Kind of a burden, see?  \"And then, the kid in the chair has to sit there and watch his brother play basketball or jai alai, while he can't do anything himself. Like I say, kind of rough on both of them.\"  \"Yes, I suppose it must be. More coffee?\"  \"Thanks, honey. And another slice of toast, hunh?\"   VIII  The two objects floating in space both looked like pitted pieces of rock. The larger one, roughly pear-shaped and about a quarter of a mile in its greatest dimension, was actually that--a hunk of rock. The smaller--_much_ smaller--of the two was a camouflaged spaceboat. The smaller was on a near-collision course with reference to the larger, although their relative velocities were not great.  At precisely the right time, the smaller drifted by the larger, only a few hundred yards away. The weakness of the gravitational fields generated between the two caused only a slight change of orbit on the part of both bodies. Then they began to separate.  But, during the few seconds of their closest approach, a third body had detached itself from the camouflaged spaceboat and shot rapidly across the intervening distance to land on the surface of the floating mountain.  The third body was a man in a spacesuit. As soon as he landed, he sat down, stock-still, and checked the instrument case he held in his hands.  No response. Thus far, then, he had succeeded.  He had had to pick his time precisely. The people who were already on this small planetoid could not use their detection equipment while the planetoid itself was within detection range of Beacon 971, only two hundred and eighty miles away. Not if they wanted to keep from being found. Radar pulses emanating from a presumably lifeless planetoid would be a dead giveaway.  Other than that, they were mathematically safe--if they depended on the laws of chance. No ship moving through the Asteroid Belt would dare to move at any decent velocity without using radar, so the people on this particular lump of planetary flotsam would be able to spot a ship's approach easily, long before their own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30742"],["title","Anything You Can Do! (#6)"],["body","detection system would register on the pick-ups of the approaching ship.  The power and range needed by a given detector depends on the relative velocity--the greater that velocity, the more power, the greater range needed. At one mile per second, a ship needs a range of only thirty miles to spot an obstacle thirty seconds away; at ten miles per second, it needs a range of three hundred miles.  The man who called himself Stanley Martin had carefully plotted the orbit of this particular planetoid and then let his spaceboat coast in without using any detection equipment except the visual. It had been necessary, but very risky.  Had the people here seen his boat? If so, had they recognized it, in spite of the heavy camouflage? And, even if they only suspected, what would be their reaction?  He waited.  It takes nerve and patience to wait for thirteen solid hours without moving more than an occasional flexure of muscles, but he managed that long before the instrument case waggled a meter needle at him. The one relieving factor was the low gravity; on an asteroid, the problem of sleeping on a bed of nails is caused by the likelihood of accidentally throwing oneself off the bed. The probability of puncture or discomfort from the points is almost negligible.  When the needle on the instrument panel flickered, he got to his feet and began moving. He was almost certain that he had not been detected.  Walking was out of the question. This was a silicate-alumina rock, not a nickel-iron one. The group that occupied it had deliberately chosen it that way, so that there would be no chance of its being picked out for slicing by one of the mining teams in the Asteroid Belt. Granted, the chance of any given metallic planetoid's being selected was very small, they had not even wanted to take that chance. Therefore, without any magnetic field to hold him down, and only a very tiny gravitic field, the man had to use different tactics.  It was more like mountain climbing than anything else, except that there was no danger of falling. He crawled over the surface in the same way that an Alpine climber might crawl up the side of a steep slope--seeking handholds and toeholds and using them to propel himself onward. The only difference was that he covered distance a great deal more rapidly than a mountain climber could.  When he reached the spot he wanted, he carefully concealed himself beneath a craggy overhang. It took a little searching to find exactly the right spot, but when he did, he settled himself into place in a small pit and began more elaborate preparations.  Self-hypnosis required nearly ten minutes. The first five or six minutes were taken up in relaxing from his exertion. Gravity notwithstanding, he had had to push his hundred and eighty pounds of mass over a considerable distance. When he was completely relaxed and completely hypnotized, he reached up and cut down the valve that fed oxygen into his suit.  Then, of his own will, he went cataleptic.         *       *       *       *       *  A single note, sounded by the instruments in the case by his side, woke him instantly. He came fully awake, as he had commanded himself to do.  Immediately, he turned up his oxygen intake, at the same time glancing at the clock dial in his helmet. He smiled. Nineteen days and seven hours. He had calculated it almost precisely. He wasn't more than an hour off, which was pretty good, all things considered.  He consulted his instruments again. The supply ship was ten minutes away. The smile stayed on his face as he prepared for further action.  The first two minutes were conscientiously spent in inhaling oxygen. Even under the best cataleptic conditions, the body tended to slow down too much. He had to get himself prepared for violent movement.  Eight minutes left. He climbed out of the little grotto where he had concealed himself and moved toward the spot where he knew the air lock to the caverns underneath the planetoid's surface was hidden. Then again, he concealed himself and waited, while he continued to breathe deeply of the highly oxygenated air in his suit. Five minutes before the ship landed, he swallowed eight ounces of the nutrient solution from the tank in the back of his helmet. The solution of amino acids, vitamins, and honey sugar also contained a small amount of stimulant of the dexedrine type and one per cent ethanol. Then he unholstered his gun.  It wasn't a big ship. He had known it wouldn't be. It was only a little larger than the one he had used to come here. It dropped down to the surface of the small planetoid only ten meters from the hidden trapdoor that led to the air lock beneath the surface.  He could suddenly hear voices in the earphones of his helmet.  _Lasser?_  _It's me, Fritz. I got your supplies and good news._  The air lock trapdoor opened, and a spacesuited figure came out. _How about the deal?_  _That's the good news,_ said the second suited figure as it came from the air lock of the grounded spaceboat. _Another five million._  The man who was hidden behind the nearby crag of rock listened and watched for a minute or so more while the two men began unloading cases of foodstuffs from the spaceboat. Then, satisfied that it was perfectly safe, he aimed his gun and shot twice in rapid succession. The range was almost point-blank, and there was, of course, no need to take either gravity or air resistance into account.  The pellets of the shotgun-like charge that blasted out from the gun were small, needle-shaped, and heavy. They were oriented point-forward by the magnetic field along the barrel of the weapon. Of the hundreds in each charge fired, only a few penetrated the spacesuits of the targets, but those few were enough. The powerful drug in the needle-pointed head of each went into the bloodstream of the target.  Each man felt an itching sensation. He had less than two seconds to think about it before unconsciousness overtook him and he slumped nervelessly.  The man with the gun ran across the intervening space quickly, his body only a few degrees from the horizontal, and his toes paddling rapidly to propel him over the rough rock.  He braked himself to a halt and slapped air patches over the area where his charges had struck the men's suits, sealing the tiny air leaks, and, at the same time, driving more of the tiny needles into their skins. They would be out for a long time.  Neither of them had yet fallen to the ground; that would take several minutes under this low gravity. He left them to drop and headed toward the open air lock.  This was what he had been waiting for all those nineteen days in cataleptic hypnosis. He couldn't have cut his way in from the outside; he had had to wait until it was opened, and that time would come only when the supply ship came.  Once in the air lock, he touched the control stud that would close the outer door, pump air into the waiting room, and open the inner door. Here was his greatest point of danger--greater, even, than the danger of coming to the planetoid, or the danger of waiting nineteen days for the coming of the supply ship. If the ones who remained within suspected anything--anything at all!--then his chances of coming out of this alive were practically nil.  But there was no reason why they should suspect. They should think that the man coming in was one of their own. The radio contact between the men outside had been limited to a few millimicrowatts of power--necessarily, since radio waves of very small wattage can be decoded at tremendous distances in open space. The men inside the planetoid certainly should not have been able to pick up any more than the beginning of the conversation, before it had been cut off by solid rock.  It was a high-speed air lock. Unlike the soundless discharge of his special gun in the outer airlessness, the blast of air that came into the waiting chamber was like a hurricane in noise and force, as the room filled in a few seconds.  He held onto the handholds tightly while the brief but violent winds buffeted him. He turned as the inner door opened.  His eyes took in the picture in a fraction of a second. In an even smaller fraction, his mind assimilated the picture.  The woman was dark-haired, dark-eyed, and muscular. Her mouth was wide and thick-lipped beneath a large nose.  The man was leaner and lighter, bony-faced and beady-eyed.  The woman said: \"Fritz, what--\"  And then he shot them both with gun number two.  No needle charges this time; such shots would have blown them both in two, unprotected as they were by spacesuits. The small handgun merely jangled their nerves with a high-powered blast of accurately beamed supersonics. While they were still twitching, he went over and jabbed them with a drug needle.  Then he went on into the hideout.  He had to knock out one more man, whom he found sound asleep in a room off the short corridor.  It took a gas bomb to get the two women who were guarding the kid.  He made sure that the BenChaim boy was all right, then he went to the little communications room and called for help.   IX  Colonel Walther Mannheim tapped the map that glowed on the wall before him. \"He's right there, where those tunnels come together.\"  Bart Stanton looked at the map of Manhattan Island and at the gleaming colored traceries that threaded their various ways across it. \"Just what was the purpose of those tunnels?\" he asked curiously.  \"They were for rail transportation,\" said the colonel. \"The island was hit by a sun bomb during the Holocaust, and almost completely leveled and slagged down. When the city was rebuilt, there was naturally no need for such things, so they were simply sealed off and forgotten.\"  \"Right under Government City,\" Stanton said. \"Incredible.\"  \"It used to be one of the largest seaports in the world,\" Colonel Mannheim said, \"and it probably still would be if the inertia drive hadn't made air travel cheaper and easier than seagoing.\"  \"How did he find out about the tunnels?\""]]]
