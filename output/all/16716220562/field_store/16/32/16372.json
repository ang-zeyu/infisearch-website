The Punic faith with which the Southern States entered the war for liberty humiliated the army, and wrung from its commander the letter written to Congress, and its approval of his course in re-enlisting free negroes. Meanwhile the British were actively engaged in recruiting and organizing negroes into their army and navy.  In November, 1775, Lord Dunmore visited Norfolk, Virginia,[3] and, as Governor, finding his authority as such not regarded by the whites, issued a proclamation offering freedom to the slaves who would join the British army. A full description of the State of affairs at that time, is thus given by an English historian:       \"In letters which had been laid before the English      Parliament, and published to the whole world, he (Lord      Dunmore) had represented the planters as ambitious, selfish      men, pursuing their own interest and advancement at the      expense of their poorer countrymen, and as being ready to      make every sacrifice of honesty and principle, and he had      said more privately, that, since they were so anxious for      liberty,--for more freedom than was consistent with the free      institutions of the Mother Country and the charter of the      Colony,--that since they were so eager to abolish a fanciful      slavery in a dependence on Great Britain, he would try how      they liked abolition of real slavery, by setting free all      their negroes and indentured servants, who were, in fact,      little better than _white_ slaves. This to the Virginians      was like passing a rasp over a gangrened place; it was      probing a wound that was incurable, or one which had not yet      been healed. Later in the year, when the battle of Bunker's      Hill had been fought, when our forts on Lake Champlain had      been taken from us, and when Montgomery and Arnold were      pressing on our possessions in Canada, Lord Dunmore carried      his threat into execution. Having established his      headquarters at Norfolk, he proclaimed freedom to all the      slaves who would repair to his standard and bear arms for      the King. The summons was readily obeyed by the most of the      negroes who had the means of escape to him. He, at the same      time, issued a proclamation, declaring martial law      throughout the colony of Virginia; and he collected a number      of armed vessels, which cut off the coasting trade, made      many prizes, and greatly distressed an important part of      that Province. If he could have opened a road to slaves in      the interior of the Province, his measures would have been      very fatal to the planters. In order to stop the alarming      desertion of the negroes, and to arrest his Lordship in his      career, the provincial Assembly detached against him a      strong force of more than a thousand men, who arrived in the      neighborhood of Norfolk in the month of December. Having      made a circuit, they came to a village called Great Bridge,      where the river Elizabeth was traversed by a bridge; but      before their arrival the bridge had been made impassable,      and some works, defended chiefly by negroes, had been thrown      up.\"  During the same month Edmund Pendleton wrote to Richard Henry Lee that many slaves had flocked to the British standard:       \"The Governor, * * * * marched out with three hundred and      fifty soldiers, Tories and _slaves_, to Kemp's Landing; and      after setting up his standard, and issuing his proclamation,      declaring all persons rebels who took up arms for the      country, and inviting all slaves, servants and apprentices      to come to him and receive arms, he proceeded to intercept      Hutchings and his party, upon whom he came by surprise, but      received, it seems, so warm a fire, that the ragmuffins ran      away. They were, however, rallied on discovering that two      companies of our militia gave away; and left Hutchings and      Dr. Reid with a volunteer company, who maintained their      ground bravely till they were overcome by numbers, and took      shelter in a swamp. The slaves were sent in pursuit of them;      and one of Col. Hutching's, with another, found him. On      their approach, he discharged his pistol at his slave, but      missed him; and he was taken by them, after receiving a      wound in the face with a sword. The number taken or killed      on either side is not ascertained. It is said the Governor      went to Dr. Reid's shop, and after taking the medicines and      dressing necessary for his wounded men, broke all the others      to pieces. Letters mention that slaves flock to him in      abundance: but I hope it is magnified.\"  Five months after he issued the proclamation, Lord Dunmore thus writes, concerning his success:                        [No. 1]            \"_Lord Dunmore to the Secretary of State._                   {SHIP 'DUNMORE,' IN ELIZABETH RIVER, VA.,                   {    30th March, 1776.       \"Your Lordship will observe by my letter, No. 34, that I      have been endeavoring to raise two regiments here--one of      white people, the other of black. The former goes on very      slowly, but the latter very well, and would have been in      great forwardness, had not a fever crept in amongst them,      which carried off a great many very fine fellows.\"         *       *       *       *       *                         [No. 3]                    {\"SHIP 'DUNMORE,' IN GWIN'S ISLAND HARBOR, VA.,                   {    June 26, 1776.       \"I am extremely sorry to inform your Lordship, that that      fever of which I informed you in my letter No. 1 has proved      a very malignant one, and has carried off an incredible      number of our people, especially the blacks. Had it not been      for this horrid disorder, I am satisfied I should have had      no doubt of penetrating into the heart of this colony.\"  The dread in which the colonists held the negro was equal to that with which they regarded the Indians. The incendiary torch, massacre, pillage, and revolt, was ever presenting a gloomy and disastrous picture to the colonists at the South. Their dreams at night; their thoughts by day; in the field and in the legislature hall, were how to keep the negro down. If one should be seen in a village with a gun, a half score of white men would rush and take it from him, while women in the street would take shelter in the nearest house. The wrongs which they continued to practice upon him was a terror to them through their conscience, though then, as in later years, many, and particularly the leaders, endeavored to impress others with their feigned belief of the natural inferiority of the negro to themselves. This doctrine served them, as the whistle did the boy in the woods; they talked in that way simply to keep their courage up, and their conscience down.  The commander of the American army regarded the action of Lord Dunmore as a serious blow to the national cause. To take the negroes out of the field from raising produce for the army, and place them in front of the patriots as opposing soldiers, he saw was a danger that should be averted. With this in view he wrote to Joseph Reed in December, saying:       \"If the Virginians are wise, that arch-traitor to the rights      of humanity, Lord Dunmore, should be instantly crushed, if      it takes the whole army to do it; otherwise, like a snowball      in rolling, his army will get size, some through fear, some      through promises, and some through inclination, joining his      standard; but that which renders the measure indispensable      is the negroes; for, if he gets formidable, numbers of them      will be tempted to join, who will be afraid to do it      without.\"  Notwithstanding this, the Southern States still kept the negro out of the army. It was not until affairs became alarmingly dangerous, and a few weeks before the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, that the subject of arming the slaves came again before the people.  In May, 1777, the General Assembly of Connecticut postponed in one house and rejected in the other the report of a committee \"that the effective negro and mulatto slaves be allowed to enlist with the Continental battallions now raising in this State.\" But under a law passed at the same session \"white and black, bond and free, if 'able bodied,' went on the roll together, accepted as the representatives of their 'class,' or as substitutes for their employers.\" At the next session (October, 1777), the law was so amended as to authorize the selectmen of any town, on the application of the master--after 'inquiry into the age, abilities, circumstances, and character' of the servant or slave, and being satisfied 'that it was likely to be consistent with his real advantage, and that he would be able to support himself,'--to grant liberty for his emancipation, and to discharge the master 'from any charge or cost which may be occasioned by maintaining or supporting the servant or slave made free as aforesaid.' Mr. J. H. Trumbull, of Connecticut, in giving the foregoing facts, adds:       \"The slave (or servant for term of years) might receive his      freedom; the master might receive exemption from draft, and      a discharge from future liabilities, to which he must      otherwise have been subjected. In point of fact, some      hundreds of blacks,--slaves and freemen,--were enlisted,      from time to time, in the regiments of State troops and of      the Connecticut line.\"  The British were determined, it seems, to utilize all the available strength they could command, by enlisting negroes at the North as well as at the South. They conceived the idea of forming regiments of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31339"],["title","The Black Phalanx (#8)"],["body"," at the North, as the letter of Gen. Greene to Gen. Washington will show:                 \"CAMP ON LONG ISLAND, July 21, 1776, two o'clock.       \"SIR:--Colonel Hand reports seven large ships are coming up      from the Hook to the Narrows.       \"A negro belonging to one Strickler, at Gravesend, was taken      prisoner (as he says) last Sunday at Coney Island. Yesterday      he made his escape, and was taken prisoner by the rifle      guard. He reports eight hundred negroes collected on Staten      Island, this day to be formed into a regiment.           I am your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,                                                   N. GREENE.      \"To His Excellency Gen. Washington, Headquarters, New York.\"  Occasionally the public would be startled by the daring and bravery of some negro in the American army, and then the true lovers of liberty, North and South, would again urge that negroes be admitted into the ranks of the army. When Lt.-Col. Barton planned for the capture of the British Maj.-Gen. Prescott, who commanded the British army at Newport R. I., and whose capture was necessary in order to effect the release of Gen. Lee, who was then in the hands of the British, and of the same rank as that of Gen. Prescott, Col. Barton's plan was made a success through the aid of Prince, a negro in Col. Barton's command. The daring of the exploit excited the highest patriotic commendations of the Americans, and revived the urgent appeals that had been made for a place in the armed ranks for all men, irrespective of color. The Pennsylvania Evening _Post_ of Aug. 7th, 1777, gives the following account of the capture:       \"They landed about five miles from Newport, and three      quarters of a mile from the house, which they approached      cautiously, avoiding the main guard, which was at some      distance. _The Colonel went foremost, with a stout active      negro close behind him, and another at a small distance; the      rest followed so as to be near but not seen._       \"A single sentinel at the door saw and hailed the Colonel;      he answered by exclaiming against and inquiring for, rebel      prisoners, but kept slowly advancing. The sentinel again      challenged him and required the countersign. He said he had      not the countersign; but amused the sentry by talking about      rebel prisoners, and still advancing till he came within      reach of the bayonet, which, he presenting, the colonel      struck aside, and seized him. He was immediately secured,      and ordered to be silent, on pain of instant death.      _Meanwhile, the rest of the men surrounding the house, the      negro, with his head, at the second stroke, forced a passage      into it, and then into the landlord's apartment. The      landlord at first refused to give the necessary      intelligence; but, on the prospect of present death, he      pointed to the General's chamber, which being instantly      opened by the negro's head, the Colonel, calling the General      by name, told him he was a prisoner._\"  Congress voted Col. Barton a magnificent sword, but the real captor of Gen. Prescott, so far as known, received nothing. A surgeon in the American army, Dr. Thacher, writes, under date of Aug. 3d, 1777, at Albany:       \"The pleasing information is received here that Lieut.-Col.      Barton, of the Rhode Island Militia, planned a bold exploit      for the purpose of surprising and taking Maj.-Gen. Prescott,      the commanding officer of the Royal army at Newport. Taking      with him, in the night, about forty men, in two boats, with      oars muffled, he had the address to elude the vigilance of      the ships-of-war and guard boats; and, having arrived      undiscovered at the quarters of Gen. Prescott, they were      taken for the sentinels; and the general was not alarmed      till the captors were at the door of his lodging chamber,      which was fast closed. _A negro man, named Prince, instantly      thrust his beetle head through the panel door, and seized      his victim while in bed._ This event is extremely honorable      to the enterprising spirit of Col. Barton, and is considered      an ample retaliation for the capture of Gen. Lee by Col.      Harcourt. The event occasions great joy and exultation, as      it puts in our possession an officer of equal rank with Gen.      Lee, by which means an exchange may be obtained. Congress      resolved that an elegant sword should be presented to Col.      Barton, for his brave exploit.\"  To recite here every incident and circumstance illustrating the heroism and the particular services rendered the patriotic army by negroes, who served in regiments and companies with white soldiers, would fill this entire volume. Yet, with the desire of doing justice to the memory of all those negroes who aided in achieving the independence of America, I cannot forbear introducing notices,--gathered from various sources,--of some prominent examples.  Ebenezer Hill, a slave at Stonington, Conn., who served throughout the war, and who took part in the battles of Saratoga and Stillwater, and witnessed the surrender of Burgoyne.  Prince Whipple acted as bodyguard to General Whipple, one of Washington's aids. Prince is the negro seen on horseback in the engraving of Washington crossing the Delaware, and again pulling the stroke oar in the boat which Washington crossed in.  At the storming of Fort Griswold, Maj. Montgomery was lifted upon the walls of the fort by his soldiers, and called upon the Americans to surrender. John Freeman, a negro soldier, with his pike, pinned him dead to the earth. Among the American soldiers who were massacred by the British soldiers, after the surrender of the fort, were two negro soldiers, Lambo Latham and Jordan Freeman.  Quack Matrick, a negro, fought through the Revolutionary war, as a soldier, for which he was pensioned. Also Jonathan Overtin, who was at the battle of Yorktown. The grandfather of the historian Wm. Wells Brown, Simon Lee, was also a soldier \"in the times which tried men's souls.\"       \"Samuel Charlton was born in the State of New Jersey, a      slave, in the family of Mr. M., who owned, also, other      members belonging to his family--all residing in the English      neighborhood. During the progress of the war, he was placed      by his master (as a substitute for himself) in the army then      in New Jersey, as a teamster in the baggage train. He was in      active service at the battle of Monmouth, not only      witnessing, but taking a part in, the great struggle of that      day. He was also in several other engagements in different      sections of that part of the State. He was a great admirer      of General Washington, and was, at one time, attached to his      baggage train, and received the General's commendation for      his courage and devotion to the cause of liberty. Mr.      Charlton was about fifteen or seventeen years of age when      placed in the army, for which his master rewarded him with a      silver dollar. At the expiration of his time, he returned to      his master, to serve again in bondage, after having toiled,      fought and bled for liberty, in common with the regular      soldiery. Mr. M., at his death, by will, liberated his      slaves, and provided a pension for Charlton, to be paid      during his lifetime.              *       *       *       *       \"James Easton, of Bridgewater, a colored man, participated      in the erection of the fortifications on Dorchester Heights,      under command of Washington, which the next morning so      greatly surprised the British soldiers then encamped in      Boston.\"       \"Among the brave blacks who fought in the battles for      American liberty was Major Jeffrey, a Tennesseean, who,      during the campaign of Major-General Andrew Jackson in      Mobile, filled the place of \"regular\" among the soldiers. In      the charge made by General Stump against the enemy, the      Americans were repulsed and thrown into disorder,--Major      Stump being forced to retire, in a manner by no means      desirable, under the circumstances. Major Jeffrey, who was      but a common soldier, seeing the condition of his comrades,      and comprehending the disastrous results about to befall      them, rushed forward, mounted a horse, took command of the      troops, and, by an heroic effort, rallied them to the      charge,--completely routing the enemy, who left the      Americans masters of the field. He at once received from the      General the title of \"Major,\" though he could not, according      to the American policy, so commission him. To the day of his      death, he was known by that title in Nashville, where he      resided, and the circumstances which entitled him to it were      constantly the subject of popular conversation.       \"Major Jeffrey was highly respected by the whites generally,      and revered, in his own neighborhood, by all the colored      people who knew him.       \"A few years ago receiving an indignity from a common      ruffian, he was forced to strike him in self-defense; for      which act, in accordance with the laws of slavery in that,      as well as many other of the slave States, he was compelled      to receive, on his naked person, _nine and thirty lashes      with a raw hide!_ This, at the age of seventy odd, after the      distinguished services rendered his country,--probably when      the white ruffian for whom he was tortured was unable to      raise an arm in its defense,--was more than he could bear;      _it broke his heart_, and he sank to rise no more, till      summoned by the blast of the last trumpet to stand on the      battle-field of the general resurrection.\"  Jeffrey was not an exception to this kind of treatment. Samuel Lee died on a tobacco plantation after the war.  The re-enslaving of the negroes who fought for American Independence became so general at the South, that the Legislature of"]]]
