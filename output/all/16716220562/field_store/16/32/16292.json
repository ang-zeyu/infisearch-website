Hunter stood for an instant with his legs spread wide, looking down at Young. Then he dropped to his knees and rolled the grievously wounded man over on his back. The hand grasping the scalpel slowly pulled the blade from the abdominal wound. Blood pulsed out upon the white tile. Young was still barely alive.  Hunter walked toward the transmitter, where Ann stood, saying nothing, her eyes wide and staring. A tremendous conflict was raging within him. Running away was no solution, but what if he could destroy the system itself? Break the mold and start anew.  He had the instrument that would do it, the hundreds of obedient slaves Young had already turned loose on the streets. With Ann's transmitter he could transform the disciplined strike of human automatons into a civic disaster. Terror and violence uprooting the foundations of the city.  But a moment's madness could not overthrow the enduring rationality of Hunter's adjustment index. To loose that horror was to set himself in judgment upon the dreams and hopes, the perversion and the sublimity, of his fellow men. To play at God--a delusion no different from Eric Young's.  Savagely Hunter lifted a chair and started to swing it at the transmitter. Instantly, Ann Saymer turned to face him, the blaster clasped tightly in her hand.  \"No, Max.\"  \"But, Ann, those people outside are in desperate danger--\"  \"I've gone this far. I _won't_ turn back.\" In her voice was the familiar drive, the ambition he knew so well. But now it seemed different, a twisted distortion of something he had once admired.  \"We don't need Eric Young,\" she said. \"He's bungled everything. You and I, Max--\" She caressed the transmitter affectionately. \"With this, we'll possess unlimited power.\"  \"You mean, Ann--\" He choked on the words. \"You came here of your own free will? You deliberately planned Mrs. Ames' murder?\"  \"She was dangerous, Max. She guessed too much. We knew that when we monitored the call you made from the spaceport. But in the beginning we weren't going to make you responsible. We thought the strangers in the house--your attempt to expose the other woman who called herself Mrs. Ames--would be enough to get you committed to a clinic. I didn't want you to be hurt, Max.\"  \"Why, Ann?\" His voice was dead, emotionless. \"Because you loved me? Or because you wanted me to be your ace in the hole, if you failed to manage Eric Young the way you thought you could?\"  \"That doesn't matter now, Max, dear. I thought Eric had what I needed. But I was misjudging you all along.\"  \"You're still misjudging me, Ann. I'm going to smash this machine and afterward--\"  \"No you aren't, Max,\" she said coldly. \"I'll kill you first.\"  Calmly she turned the dial on the blaster. He lifted the chair again, watching her face, still unable to accept what he knew was true. This was Ann Saymer, the woman he had loved. It was the same Ann whose ambition had driven her from the general school to a First in Psychiatry.  With a fighting man's instinct, Hunter calculated his chances as he held the chair high above his head. It was Ann who had to die. He would accomplish nothing if he smashed her transmitter. She knew how to build another. If he threw the chair at her rather than the Exorciser and if he threw it hard enough--  From the door a fan of flame blazed out, gently touching Ann. She stood rigid in the first muscular tension of paralysis. Hunter dropped the chair, shattering the transmitter. He turned and saw Dawn in the doorway. Somewhere deep in his subconscious mind he had expected her. He was glad she was there.  \"We've known for a long time we would have to break up their little partnership,\" Dawn explained. \"After I talked to you this morning, Captain, I persuaded the others to hold off for another day or so. A clinical experiment of my own.  \"It was unkind of me, I suppose, to make you the guinea pig. But I wanted to watch your reactions while you fought your way to the truth. Now you know it all--more than you bargained for. And you know what we're trying to do. Are you willing to join us?\"  He looked at her.  \"In your third alternative--the cautious, rational rebuilding?\"  \"After men understand themselves. When we're able to answer one question: why did you and Ann Saymer, with identical backgrounds, and intelligence, and an identical socio-economic incentive, become such different personalities? What gives you a zero-zero adjustment index that nothing can shake? Not the psychiatric shock of war, Captain. Not physical pain alone or the treachery of the girl you love. We need you, Captain. We need to know what makes you tick.\"  \"That 'we' of yours. Just what does that embrace?\"  \"A cross-section of us all,\" she told him. \"Psychiatrists, executives in both cartels, union officials. We've been working at this for a good many years. We want to make our world over, yes. But this time with reason and without violence--without sacrificing the good we already have.\"  \"And you yourself, Dawn. Who are you?\"  \"I represent that nonentity called the government, Captain.\"  \"A nonentity wouldn't make you what you are, Dawn.\"  \"My name, Captain--\" She drew a long breath. \"My name is Dawn Farren. The rest of my family is dying out as the Von Rausches are. Unlimited power has a way of poisoning the human mind. If wealth is our only ethical goal, what do we really have when we possess it all? Madness. Both cartels are shams, Captain Hunter, just as your frontier wars are shams.  \"Yes, you may as well know that, too. Neither fleet has actually fought the other for a good many years. The planets you blast are hulks already long dead. It's all a sham, but we have to keep it alive. We have to make it _seem_ real--until we're sure we've found something better and more workable for all of us.\"  The tension in Ann Saymer's muscles started to relax. Very slowly her body began to slump, in the secondary stage of paralysis.  \"What about her?\" Hunter asked. \"She can still make another Exorciser--\"  \"The dream of enslaving mankind is _always_ insanity. We'll put her in a public clinic, of course. We may have to use her own machine once more to erase the memory of its structure from her mind. After that the patent drawings will be destroyed. It's not a superficial cure for maladjustment that we're after, Captain Hunter, but the cause. All of Ann's research was up a blind alley--a brilliant waste.\"  Suddenly Dawn screamed a warning and leveled her blaster at Eric Young. Hunter sprang back as Dawn fired. But her timing was a second too late. In a last, blazing agony of life-before-death Young had regained consciousness long enough to hurl the scalpel at Hunter's back. Ebbing strength distorted his aim. The blade plunged into Ann's heart as she slumped against the wall.  After a long pause, Max Hunter moved toward Dawn and took her arm. He clenched his jaw tight and drew her quickly into the hall. \"I want out, Dawn. There's no healing here. I won't feel free again until I can look up at the stars.\"  \"The stars. Then you're going back to the service, Captain? You're running away?\"  He didn't answer her until they stood in Eric Young's garden.  \"Sham battles for shadow cartels,\" he said. \"That's a child's subterfuge for the Tri-D space heroes. No, Dawn, the real war is here in the struggle for information about ourselves so that we can build a new world of freedom and human dignity. You say you need me. All right, Dawn, you've enrolled a recruit.\"  \"It will be a long, slow war, Captain,\" she said, her eyes shining. \"We may never see a victory, and--we can never make a truce. But at least we've learned how to go about solving the problem--after ten millennia of trial and error.\"         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31063"],["title","Two New Moles (Genus Scalopus) from Mexico and Texas (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net            Two New Moles (Genus Scalopus) from Mexico and Texas   BY  ROLLIN H.

BAKER   In the spring of 1950, a field party from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History including J. R. Alcorn, W. J. Schaldach, Jr., George Newton, and the author collected mammals in the Mexican state of Coahuila. A few days were spent in the Sierra del Carmen. One morning when examining sets for pocket gophers in these mountains, Alcorn found a mole caught in one of the traps. Subsequent examination discloses that this specimen belongs to a heretofore unknown species which may be named and described as follows:   =Scalopus montanus= new species       _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull plus body skeleton; no.      35668, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; Club Sierra del Carmen,      2 mi. N and 6 mi. W Piedra Blanca, Coahuila, Mexico; 7 April      1950; obtained by J. R. Alcorn, original no. 11093.       _Range._--Known only from the type locality; probably found      in other localities in the Sierra del Carmen of northern      Coahuila, Mexico.       _Diagnosis._--Size medium and slender for the genus (see      measurements); tail medium in length, sparsely covered with      whitish hairs; claws of forefeet slender; upper parts near      (h) Buffy Brown (capitalized color terms after Ridgway,      Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,      1912), with slight rufous wash on top of head; underparts      resemble upper parts but slightly paler with longitudinal      band of near (14) Sudan Brown extending from chin      posteriorly to and around base of tail, less intense on      breast; skull small, arched, and relatively slender      especially across mastoidal region; posterior part of      cranium depressed; foramen magnum low when viewed from rear;      external pterygoid region not greatly expanded; teeth small,      especially upper third molar.       _Comparison._--From _Scalopus aquaticus_, of which ten      subspecies have been seen including those of significant      geographic position, _S. montanus_ differs in: Skull      slenderer, less angular and relatively narrower across      mastoidal region; cranium arched with hind part flattened;      external pterygoid region less expanded; teeth relatively      small, especially last upper molar. From _S. inflatus_,      known to me from Jackson's description (N. Amer. Fauna,      38:53-54, pls. 2, 3, September 30, 1915), _S. montanus_      differs in: Skull less angular and slenderer, prelachrymal      region not inflated; zygomata slenderer.  _Remarks._--_S. montanus_ is known from a single specimen, which represents the second known occurrence of the genus _Scalopus_ in Mexico. The other occurrence is that of _S. inflatus_ in the state of Tamaulipas. _S. montanus_ is geographically isolated in mountainous country from other species of _Scalopus_. Ten of the recognized subspecies of _S. aquaticus_ were available for examination and descriptions of others were studied. It was found that the number and magnitude of the differences separating any one of these subspecies from an adjoining one was less than those separating _S. montanus_ from _S. a. texanus_ and _S. a. intermedius_, which are, geographically, closest to _S. montanus_. _S. montanus_ seems not to be closely related to _S. inflatus_ of Tamaulipas. _S. montanus_ is given specific rank because of the great degree of difference between it and its nearest relatives, and because of its geographically isolated position.  The specimen of _S. montanus_ was taken in a tunnel found by digging away a mound thought to be that of the pocket gopher, _Thomomys sturgisi_. A trap set in one direction in the tunnel caught the mole; a trap set in the other direction in the tunnel was later covered with soil, evidently by a gopher. After the capture a thorough inspection of the area revealed no \"raised\" tunnels, typical of _Scalopus_. A series of _Thomomys_ was taken in this area in sets placed in tunnels found under similar mounds. This locality was near the headquarters of the Club Sierra del Carmen in a parklike stand of oak timber in a cañon, at an elevation of 4950 ft. as recorded by our altimeter. The plant association was judged to be characteristic of the Upper Sonoran Life-zone, not far below the beginning of the Transition Life-zone. The area was heavily grazed by goats, hogs and horses and had little grass or other ground cover under the trees. The soil in this cañon was not deep and consisted of a rocky, marly mixture, pale red in color, evidently produced by weathering of the reddish volcanic rocks bordering the cañon.  The Sierra del Carmen is a high, igneous range, surrounded for the most part by Lower Sonoran plains and desert. Zoologically, these mountains are poorly known. Few collectors have been in the area; most of these have been afforded accommodations through the Club Sierra del Carmen (Carmen Mountain Hunting Club), the members of which have been especially interested in assisting naturalists. Several kinds of mammals are known only from this \"biological island\" including the pocket gopher mentioned above and the shrew, _Sorex milleri_. The finding of a mole in the higher elevations of this range suggests that moles may occur in other mountainous areas of Mexico.  Assistance with field work is acknowledged from the Kansas University Endowment Association.       _Measurements._--The adult, male holotype measures as      follows: Total length, 150; tail vertebrae, 27; hind foot,      20; greatest length (of skull), 32.2; palatilar length,      13.8; mastoidal breadth, 16.2; interorbital breadth, 7.0;      maxillary tooth-row, 11.3; greatest depth of skull including      auditory bullae, 9.4; weight, 38.6 grams.       _Specimen examined._--One, from the type locality.  In studying _Scalopus aquaticus texanus_, I noted that Allen (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:221, April 29, 1891) based the original description on a single, unsexed specimen taken in Presidio County, Texas, by Wm. Lloyd in September, 1887. Later, Allen wrote (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:200, August 18, 1893) that a series of moles from Rockport, Aransas County, Texas, agreed essentially with the type. True (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 19:22, December 21, 1896) believed that the type was actually from Aransas County rather than Presidio County. This belief was shared by later workers. In checking the literature, I find that the collector of the type, Wm. Lloyd, who was obtaining specimens for George B. Sennett at the time, took other mammals in September as well as in October of 1887 in Presidio County (see Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:221, 223, 224, April 29, 1891) and birds there in June of 1887 (see Sennett, Auk, 5:43, January, 1888). I can find no evidence that Lloyd collected in or near Aransas County in 1887 and see no reason for doubting that the locality, Presidio County, as written on the original label of the type of _S. a. texanus_ is correct. Mr. M. J. Carroll of the Texas State Historical Association advises me that in 1887, Presidio County was reduced to its present size by the creation of Brewster and Jeff Davis counties. Lloyd might have taken the mole in any one of these three Trans-Pecos counties. Even so, these counties are widely separated geographically from the range of other moles designated as _S. a. texanus_ (see Davis, Amer. Midl. Nat., 27:386, March, 1942). The taking of _S. montanus_ in the Sierra del Carmen immediately south of Trans-Pecos Texas leads me to think that Lloyd's mole might have been taken in a mountainous region within one of the three counties mentioned above. A description of _Scalopus aquaticus texanus_ Allen follows:   =Scalopus aquaticus texanus= Allen           _Scalops argentatus texanus_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus.          Nat. Hist., 3:221, April 29, 1891.       _Type._--Sex unknown, adult, skin no. 3488, skull no. 2740,      Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.; Presidio County, Texas; September,      1887, obtained by Wm. Lloyd.       _Range._--Limits of range in Trans-Pecos Texas unknown.       _Diagnosis._--Size small; rostrum heavy and broad; lower      jaws heavy; palatine space wide with upper tooth-rows arched      laterally; teeth large, especially fourth premolar and      molars.       _Comparison._--From adults of comparable age from Rockport,      Aransas County, Texas, _S. a. texanus_ differs in: Rostrum      broader and heavier; lower jaws heavier; palatine space      wider, with upper tooth-rows more arched laterally;      individual teeth in both jaws larger, especially fourth      premolar and molars. From _S. a. intermedius_, which is      geographically nearest to the northeast (adult specimens      from Meade, Clark and Barber counties, Kansas, and Dewey      County, Oklahoma), _S. a. texanus_ differs in: Size smaller;      rostrum less massive and shorter; tooth-row shorter.  _Remarks._--The type has been previously examined by True (_op. cit._:44). The skin is faded and of little taxonomic worth. The anterior part of the skull is present along with both upper tooth-rows and most of the lower jaws. The teeth are well worn, indicative of old adulthood. In size, _S. a. texanus_ appears closest to moles from southern Texas (Rockport) which previously were assigned to the subspecies _Scalopus aquaticus texanus_. The tooth-rows are of the same length, but the"]]]
