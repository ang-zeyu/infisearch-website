There's a great deal of county business to be attended to.\"  Lord Darcy waved a hand. \"Not at the moment, Sir Pierre. I understand the pressures of government. Go right ahead.\"  \"Thank you, your lordship. If anything further should be required, I shall be in my office.\"  As soon as Sir Pierre had closed the door, Lord Darcy held out his hand toward the sorcerer. \"Master Sean; the gun.\"  Master Sean handed it to him. \"Ever see one like it before?\" he asked, turning it over in his hands.  \"Not _exactly_ like it, my lord.\"  \"Come, come, Sean; don't be so cautious. I am no sorcerer, but I don't need to know the Laws of Similarity to be able to recognise an _obvious_ similarity.\"  \"Edinburgh,\" said Master Sean flatly.  \"Exactly. Scottish work. The typical Scot gold work; remarkable beauty. And look at that lock. It has 'Scots' written all over it--and more. 'Edinburgh', as you said.\"  Dr. Pateley, having replaced his carefully polished glasses, leaned over and peered at the weapon in Lord Darcy's hand. \"Couldn't it be Italian, my lord? Or Moorish? In Moorish Spain, they do work like that.\"  \"No Moorish gunsmith would put a hunting scene on the butt,\" Lord Darcy said flatly, \"and the Italians wouldn't have put heather and thistles in the field surrounding the huntsman.\"  \"But the _FdM_ engraved on the barrel,\" said Dr. Pateley, \"indicates the--\"  \"Ferrari of Milan,\" said Lord Darcy. \"Exactly. But the barrel is of much newer work than the rest. So are the chambers. This is a fairly old gun--fifty years old, I'd say. The lock and the butt are still in excellent condition, indicating that it has been well cared for, but frequent usage--or a single accident--could ruin the barrel and require the owner to get a replacement. It was replaced by Ferrari.\"  \"I see,\" said Dr. Pateley somewhat humbled.  \"If we open the lock ... Master Sean, hand me your small screwdriver. Thank you. If we open the lock, we will find the name of one of the finest gunsmiths of half a century ago--a man whose name has not yet been forgotten--Hamish Graw of Edinburgh. Ah! There! You see?\" They did.  Having satisfied himself on that point, Lord Darcy closed the lock again. \"Now, men, we have the gun located. We also know that a guest in this very castle is Laird Duncan of Duncan. The Duncan of Duncan himself. A Scot's laird who was, fifteen years ago, His Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary to the Free Grand Duchy of Milan. That suggests to me that it would be indeed odd if there were not some connection between Laird Duncan and this gun. Eh?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Come, come, Master Sean,\" said Lord Darcy, rather impatiently. \"We haven't all the time in the world.\"  \"Patience, my lord; patience,\" said the little sorcerer calmly. \"Can't hurry these things, you know.\" He was kneeling in front of a large, heavy traveling chest in the bedroom of the guest apartment occupied temporarily by Laird and Lady Duncan, working with the lock. \"One position of a lock is just as relevant as the other so you can't work with the bolt. But the pin-tumblers in the cylinder, now, that's a different matter. A lock's built so that the breaks in the tumblers are not related to the surface of the cylinder when the key is out, but there is a relation when the key's _in_, so by taking advantage of that relevancy--Ah!\"  The lock clicked open.  Lord Darcy raised the lid gently.  \"Carefully, my lord!\" Master Sean said in a warning voice. \"He's got a spell on the thing! Let me do it.\" He made Lord Darcy stand back and then lifted the lid of the heavy trunk himself. When it was leaning back against the wall, gaping open widely on its hinges, Master Sean took a long look at the trunk and its lid without touching either of them. There was a second lid on the trunk, a thin one obviously operated by a simple bolt.  Master Sean took his sorcerer's staff, a five-foot, heavy rod made of the wood of the quicken tree or mountain ash, and touched the inner lid. Nothing happened. He touched the bolt. Nothing.  \"Hm-m-m,\" Master Sean murmured thoughtfully. He glanced around the room, and his eyes fell on a heavy stone doorstop. \"That ought to do it.\" He walked over, picked it up, and carried it back to the chest. Then he put it on the rim of the chest in such a position that if the lid were to fall it would be stopped by the doorstop.  Then he put his hand in as if to lift the inner lid.  The heavy outer lid swung forward and down of its own accord, moving with blurring speed, and slammed viciously against the doorstop.  Lord Darcy massaged his right wrist gently, as if he felt where the lid would have hit if he had tried to open the inner lid. \"Triggered to slam if a human being sticks a hand in there, eh?\"  \"Or a head, my lord. Not very effectual if you know what to look for. There are better spells than that for guarding things. Now we'll see what his lordship wants to protect so badly that he practices sorcery without a license.\" He lifted the lid again, and then opened the inner lid. \"It's safe now, my lord. _Look at this!_\"  Lord Darcy had already seen. Both men looked in silence at the collection of paraphernalia on the first tray of the chest. Master Sean's busy fingers carefully opened the tissue paper packing of one after another of the objects. \"A human skull,\" he said. \"Bottles of graveyard earth. Hm-m-m--this one is labeled 'virgin's blood.' And this! A Hand of Glory!\"  It was a mummified human hand, stiff and dry and brown, with the fingers partially curled, as though they were holding an invisible ball three inches or so in diameter. On each of the fingertips was a short candle-stub. When the hand was placed on its back, it would act as a candelabra.  \"That pretty much settles it, eh, Master Sean?\" Lord Darcy said.  \"Indeed, my lord. At the very least, we can get him for possession of materials. Black magic is a matter of symbolism and intent.\"  \"Very well. I want a complete list of the contents of that chest. Be sure to replace everything as it was and relock the trunk.\" He tugged thoughtfully at an earlobe. \"So Laird Duncan has the Talent, eh? Interesting.\"  \"Aye. But not surprising, my lord,\" said Master Sean without looking up from his work. \"It's in the blood. Some attribute it to the Dedannans, who passed through Scotland before they conquered Ireland three thousand years ago, but, however that may be, the Talent runs strong in the Sons of Gael. It makes me boil to see it misused.\"  While Master Sean talked, Lord Darcy was prowling around the room, reminding one of a lean tomcat who was certain that there was a mouse concealed somewhere.  \"It'll make Laird Duncan boil if he isn't stopped,\" Lord Darcy murmured absently.  \"Aye, my lord,\" said Master Sean. \"The mental state necessary to use the Talent for black sorcery is such that it invariably destroys the user--but, if he knows what he's doing, a lot of other people are hurt before he finally gets his.\"  Lord Darcy opened the jewel box on the dresser. The usual traveling jewelry--enough, but not a great choice.  \"A man's mind turns in on itself when he's taken up with hatred and thoughts of revenge,\" Master Sean droned on. \"Or, if he's the type who _enjoys_ watching others suffer, or the type who doesn't care but is willing to do anything for gain, then his mind is already warped and the misuse of the Talent just makes it worse.\"  Lord Darcy found what he was looking for in a drawer, just underneath some neatly folded lingerie. A small holster, beautifully made of Florentine leather, gilded and tooled. He didn't need Master Sean's sorcery to tell him that the little pistol fit it like a hand in a glove.         *       *       *       *       *  Father Bright felt as though he had been walking a tightrope for hours. Laird and Lady Duncan had been talking in low, controlled voices that betrayed an inner nervousness, but Father Bright realized that he and the Countess had been doing the same thing. The Duncan of Duncan had offered his condolences on the death of the late Count with the proper air of suppressed sorrow, as had Mary, Lady Duncan. The Countess had accepted them solemnly and with gratitude. But Father Bright was well aware that no one in the room--possibly, he thought, no one in the world--regretted the Count's passing.  Laird Duncan sat in his wheelchair, his sharp Scots features set in a sad smile that showed an intent to be affable even though great sorrow weighed heavily upon him. Father Bright noticed it and realized that his own face had the same sort of expression. No one was fooling anyone else, of that the priest was certain--but for anyone to admit it would be the most boorish breach of etiquette. But there was a haggardness, a look of increased age about the Laird's countenance that Father Bright did not like. His priestly intuition told him clearly that there was a turmoil of emotion in the Scotsman's mind that was ... well, _evil_ was the only word for it.  Lady Duncan was, for the most part, silent. In the past fifteen minutes, since she and her husband had come to the informal tea, she had spoken scarcely a dozen words. Her face was masklike, but there was the same look of haggardness about her eyes as there was in her husband's face. But the priest's emphatic sense told him that the emotion here was fear, simple and direct. His keen eyes had noticed that she wore a shade too much make-up. She had almost succeeded in covering up the faint bruise on her right cheek, but not completely.  My lady the Countess D'Evreux was all sadness and unhappiness, but there was neither fear nor evil there. She smiled politely and talked quietly. Father Bright would have been willing to bet that not one of the four of them would remember a word that had been spoken.  Father Bright had placed his chair so that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30833"],["title","The Eyes Have It (#6)"],["body","could keep an eye on the open doorway and the long hall that led in from the Great Keep. He hoped Lord Darcy would hurry. Neither of the guests had been told that the Duke's Investigator was here, and Father Bright was just a little apprehensive about the meeting. The Duncans had not even been told that the Count's death had been murder, but he was certain that they knew.  Father Bright saw Lord Darcy come in through the door at the far end of the hall. He murmured a polite excuse and rose. The other three accepted his excuses with the same politeness and went on with their talk. Father Bright met Lord Darcy in the hall.  \"Did you find what you were looking for, Lord Darcy?\" the priest asked in a low tone.  \"Yes,\" Lord Darcy said. \"I'm afraid we shall have to arrest Laird Duncan.\"  \"Murder?\"  \"Perhaps. I'm not yet certain of that. But the charge will be black magic. He has all the paraphernalia in a chest in his room. Master Sean reports that a ritual was enacted in the bedroom last night. Of course, that's out of my jurisdiction. You, as a representative of the Church, will have to be the arresting officer.\" He paused. \"You don't seem surprised, Reverence.\"  \"I'm not,\" Father Bright admitted. \"I felt it. You and Master Sean will have to make out a sworn deposition before I can act.\"  \"I understand. Can you do me a favor?\"  \"If I can.\"  \"Get my lady the Countess out of the room on some pretext or other. Leave me alone with her guests. I do not wish to upset my lady any more than absolutely necessary.\"  \"I think I can do that. Shall we go in together?\"  \"Why not? But don't mention why I am here. Let them assume I am just another guest.\"  \"Very well.\"         *       *       *       *       *  All three occupants of the room glanced up as Father Bright came in with Lord Darcy. The introductions were made: Lord Darcy humbly begged the pardon of his hostess for his lateness. Father Bright noticed the same sad smile on Lord Darcy's handsome face as the others were wearing.  Lord Darcy helped himself from the buffet table and allowed the Countess to pour him a large cup of hot tea. He mentioned nothing about the recent death. Instead, he turned the conversation toward the wild beauty of Scotland and the excellence of the grouse shooting there.  Father Bright had not sat down again. Instead, he left the room once more. When he returned, he went directly to the Countess and said, in a low, but clearly audible voice: \"My lady, Sir Pierre Morlaix has informed me that there are a few matters that require your attention immediately. It will require only a few moments.\"  My lady the Countess did not hesitate, but made her excuses immediately. \"Do finish your tea,\" she added. \"I don't think I shall be long.\"  Lord Darcy knew the priest would not lie, and he wondered what sort of arrangement had been made with Sir Pierre. Not that it mattered except that Lord Darcy had hoped it would be sufficiently involved for it to keep the Countess busy for at least ten minutes.  The conversation, interrupted but momentarily, returned to grouse.  \"I haven't done any shooting since my accident,\" said Laird Duncan, \"but I used to enjoy it immensely. I still have friends up every year for the season.\"  \"What sort of weapon do you prefer for grouse?\" Lord Darcy asked.  \"A one-inch bore with a modified choke,\" said the Scot. \"I have a pair that I favor. Excellent weapons.\"  \"Of Scottish make?\"  \"No, no. English. Your London gunsmiths can't be beat for shotguns.\"  \"Oh. I thought perhaps your lordship had had all your guns made in Scotland.\" As he spoke, he took the little pistol out of his coat pocket and put it carefully on the table.  There was a sudden silence, then Laird Duncan said in an angry voice: \"What is this? Where did you get that?\"  Lord Darcy glanced at Lady Duncan, who had turned suddenly pale. \"Perhaps,\" he said coolly, \"Lady Duncan can tell us.\"  She shook her head and gasped. For a moment, she had trouble in forming words or finding her voice. Finally: \"No. No. I know nothing. Nothing.\"  But Laird Duncan looked at her oddly.  \"You do not deny that it is your gun, my lord?\" Lord Darcy asked. \"Or your wife's, as the case may be.\"  [Illustration]  \"_Where did you get it?_\" There was a dangerous quality in the Scotsman's voice. He had once been a powerful man, and Lord Darcy could see his shoulder muscles bunching.  \"From the late Count D'Evreux's bedroom.\"  \"What was it doing there?\" There was a snarl in the Scot's voice, but Lord Darcy had the feeling that the question was as much directed toward Lady Duncan as it was to himself.  \"One of the things it was doing there was shooting Count D'Evreux through the heart.\"  Lady Duncan slumped forward in a dead faint, overturning her teacup. Laird Duncan made a grab at the gun, ignoring his wife. Lord Darcy's hand snaked out and picked up the weapon before the Scot could touch it. \"No, no, my lord,\" he said mildly. \"This is evidence in a murder case. We mustn't tamper with the King's evidence.\"  He wasn't prepared for what happened next. Laird Duncan roared something obscene in Scots Gaelic, put his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and, with a great thrust of his powerful arms and shoulders, shoved himself up and forward, toward Lord Darcy, across the table from him. His arms swung up toward Lord Darcy's throat as the momentum of his body carried him toward the investigator.  He might have made it, but the weakness of his legs betrayed him. His waist struck the edge of the massive oaken table, and most of his forward momentum was lost. He collapsed forward, his hands still grasping toward the surprised Englishman. His chin came down hard on the table top. Then he slid back, taking the tablecloth and the china and silverware with him. He lay unmoving on the floor. His wife did not even stir except when the tablecloth tugged at her head.  Lord Darcy had jumped back, overturning his chair. He stood on his feet, looking at the two unconscious forms.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't think there's any permanent damage done to either,\" said Dr. Pateley an hour later. \"Lady Duncan was suffering from shock, of course, but Father Bright brought her round in a hurry. She's a devout woman, I think, even if a sinful one.\"  \"What about Laird Duncan?\" Lord Darcy asked.  \"Well, that's a different matter. I'm afraid that his back injury was aggravated, and that crack on the chin didn't do him any good. I don't know whether Father Bright can help him or not. Healing takes the co-operation of the patient. I did all I could for him, but I'm just a chirurgeon, not a practitioner of the Healing Art. Father Bright has quite a good reputation in that line, however, and he may be able to do his lordship some good.\"  Master Sean shook his head dolefully. \"His Reverence has the Talent, there's no doubt of that, but now he's pitted against another man who has it--a man whose mind is bent on self-destruction in the long run.\"  \"Well, that's none of my affair,\" said Dr. Pateley. \"I'm just a technician. I'll leave healing up to the Church, where it belongs.\"  \"Master Sean,\" said Lord Darcy, \"there is still a mystery here. We need more evidence. What about the eyes?\"  Master Sean blinked. \"You mean the picture test, my lord?\"  \"I do.\"  \"It won't stand up in court, my lord,\" said the sorcerer.  \"I'm aware of that,\" said Lord Darcy testily.  \"Eye test?\" Dr. Pateley asked blankly. \"I don't believe I understand.\"  \"It's not often used,\" said Master Sean. \"It is a psychic phenomenon that sometimes occurs at the moment of death--especially a violent death. The violent emotional stress causes a sort of backfiring of the mind, if you see what I mean. As a result, the image in the mind of the dying person is returned to the retina. By using the proper sorcery, this image can be developed and the last thing the dead man saw can be brought out.  \"But it's a difficult process even under the best of circumstances, and usually the conditions aren't right. In the first place, it doesn't always occur. It never occurs, for instance, when the person is expecting the attack. A man who is killed in a duel, or who is shot after facing the gun for several seconds, has time to adjust to the situation. Also, death must occur almost instantly. If he lingers, even for a few minutes, the effect is lost. And, naturally if the person's eyes are closed at the instant of death, nothing shows up.\"  \"Count D'Evreux's eyes were open,\" Dr. Pateley said. \"They were still open when we found him. How long after death does the image remain?\"  \"Until the cells of the retina die and lose their identity. Rarely more than twenty-four hours, usually much less.\"  \"It hasn't been twenty-four hours yet,\" said Lord Darcy, \"and there is a chance that the Count was taken completely by surprise.\"  \"I must admit, my lord,\" Master Sean said thoughtfully, \"that the conditions seem favorable. I shall attempt it. But don't put any hopes on it, my lord.\"  \"I shan't. Just do your best, Master Sean. If there is a sorcerer in practice who can do the job, it is you.\"  \"Thank you, my lord. I'll get busy on it right away,\" said the sorcerer with a subdued glow of pride.         *       *       *       *       *  Two hours later, Lord Darcy was striding down the corridor of the Great Hall, Master Sean following up as best he could, his _caorthainn_-wood staff in one hand and his big carpet bag in the other. He had asked Father Bright and the Countess D'Evreux to meet him in one of the smaller guest rooms. But the Countess came to meet him.  \"My Lord Darcy,\" she said, her plain face looking worried and unhappy, \"is it true that you suspect Laird and Lady Duncan of this murder? Because, if so, I must--\"  \"No longer, my lady,\" Lord Darcy cut her off quickly. \"I think we can show that neither is guilty of murder--although, of course, the black magic charge must still be held against Laird Duncan.\"  \"I understand,\" she said, \"but--\"  \"Please, my lady,\" Lord "]]]
