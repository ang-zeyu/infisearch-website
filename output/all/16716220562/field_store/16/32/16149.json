I leaned over, put an arm around behind her neck and kissed her. It was a most sedate embrace. \"There,\" I said, \"that performance alone will get you into the Lodge. Now do you believe you're a TK?\"  She gave a little shriek. A ladylike \"Eek!\"  \"It's not that awful,\" I said. \"A lot of Psi's can do it.\"  \"You _kissed_ me!\" she said, paying no attention to my question.  \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"And you managed your first lift.\" I picked the pith ball up in my fingers, showed it to her, and laid it on my palm.  \"Feel my hand first,\" I suggested. \"Then lift it over onto the desk.\"  She looked, wild-eyed, at the pith, shaking her head.  \"I'll kiss you again,\" I suggested.  The little ball came away from my palm, floated erratically around, crossed over to my desk and dropped with a soft smack to the teak. She came to me like a tigress. I don't know why I expected a repetition of our first innocent kiss--I knew she had been married once.  I claim good marks for getting her back to her own apartment immediately.         *       *       *       *       *  For the balance of the week I saw very little of Pheola during the day. The hospital kept me busy with TK surgery, and I was practicing scalpel work with my newly-strong right arm, now that I had two hands to use. I'd be something more than a TK surgeon yet.  Pheola had a couple more sneaky sessions with Norty Baskins in the data-processing center, but for most of the time, she told me, she wandered around the part of the building the Lodge had retained for its own uses, meeting Psi's of various powers and more or less soaking up the flavor of life in the Manhattan Chapter. In the evenings we found a new place for dinner each night, and then came back to her place or mine to practice with the weights. Pheola would never be the bruiser that I was--so very few are--but she worked her grip up to several grams, which is quite respectable.  By that time I felt she was ready for a course of sprouts in the human heart. I used my drag at the hospital to bring her over with me for a cram course. We had a plastic model of a heart there, about four times life size, that was built in demountable layers for lecture and demonstration purposes. By the end of the second week, Pheola was able to work her sense of perception around inside my heart, based on what she had learned from the model, in surprisingly good shape.  \"I guess you are in good health, Lefty,\" she told me late one night in her apartment. \"Your valves feel just like the model, and your arteries are clear and good. I'm so glad for you.\"  \"Clean living,\" I assured her. \"And careful choice of grandparents. Now, my fat and sassy friend,\" I said. \"I want some of your witchcraft.\" That fat part was something of a joke, for she would always be lean and rangy. But Pheola had put on a good ten pounds since we had first met. The weight was going to some rather pleasant spots to observe, and outside of her mess of buck teeth, she wasn't turning out to be such a bad-looking chicken. For one thing, she had race-horse legs, and that's never bad.  \"Witchcraft, Lefty?\" she said, getting up to go into her kitchen to pour some more coffee.  \"You said Maragon was going to have a heart attack,\" I reminded her as I followed her in to where the cooking was done. \"O.K., my skinny PC. How soon? Exactly when?\"  [Illustration]  She stopped pouring, set the percolator down and looked at me solemnly. \"In two weeks, about.\"  \"Hm-m-m,\" I said. \"But it won't kill him?\"  She picked up her cup and led me back to the sofa, sitting down before she answered me. \"Not exactly,\" she said. \"I don't want to talk about it.\"  That's what all the witches say when you try to get them to do any life-lining. \"Have you told me all that you know?\" I demanded.  Then she did a funny thing. She got up, went to the chest against the wall where her purse lay, and got out her glasses, racking them up on her long thin nose. She looked at me closely. \"No, not all I know. And I don't aim to,\" she said. She made no move to come back to sit with me.  \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"but this is Lodge business. I know that you're not a member yet, but you soon will be, and you might as well learn right now that you are subject to Lodge discipline. Tell me what you know.\"  \"No!\"  They all have to learn it sooner or later. I rammed a good stiff lift in under her heart, and saw her knees buckle. She gasped, and then the lights went out.  Pheola was beside me on the loveseat when my consciousness started to straggle back. Her hands were soothing my brow. That isn't where it had hurt. She had struck back, only twice as hard as I had managed. Fool around with somebody who had a good grip on my nervous system, would I? I was lucky to be alive.  \"Oh, darlin'!\" she gasped, as my eyes opened. \"You hurt me so, and before I knew it I had done it to you! Forgive me, Billy Joe! I'll _never_ do that again!\"  \"Better not,\" I groaned, trying to get my breath. \"They'll carry me out in a pine box next time.\"  \"I am so sorry,\" she said, beginning to cry.  \"Then tell me,\" I said. \"What else do you know?\"  That only made her cry harder, but between sobs she got it out. \"He won't die the first time,\" she said sniffling. \"But the _next_ attack will kill him.\"  \"Soon after the first?\"  She nodded. \"A couple days,\" she said. \"I wish you hadn't made me tell it.\"  \"Good thing I did,\" I growled. \"You're as nutty as a fruitcake. Maragon won't die. I've got it on good authority.\"  \"I'm _right_!\" she insisted.         *       *       *       *       *  I took it to Maragon the next morning. The city was shrouded in a low layer of cloud, and his glassed-in penthouse office was gloomy with the morning. He motioned me to sit down. I dragged one of his Bank of England chairs through the ankle-deep pile of his rug and set it down next to his big desk.  \"I have a progress report on Pheola, Pete,\" I told him.  \"That skinny one you brought back from Nevada, Lefty?\"  I nodded. \"She's not quite so skinny, thanks to my expense account,\" I said. \"And she's ready to qualify.\"  \"Not on PC,\" he said, hot at once.  \"That remains to be seen, Pete. The lab has been tracking her predictions for better than two weeks now, and in a couple more weeks Norty will give us some stix on her scope, range and accuracy.\"  He glowered at me, his bushy brows down about his eyes. \"I thought I told you to concentrate on her healing,\" he said.  \"I have,\" I told him. \"But I saw no harm in seeing what she is like with precognition,\" I said.  \"Flat on her face, that's what she's like,\" he said testily. \"One of these days I'll have to convince you that what I say around here goes, do you hear?\"  \"One of these days,\" I said. \"But not when you're being a sour old goat. You're just sore at her because she said you'd have a heart attack.\"  \"Nonsense!\" he bristled.  \"I've had Evaleen Riley doing a little PC work on you, too,\" I confessed, and saw his face get dark with anger. \"Now hold your tongue, you old goat. I'm trying to help you,\" I cut in, to keep him from bellowing at me. \"Evaleen is worried, too. But she's a little more cheerful than Pheola. She doesn't think you'll die.\"  \"Well,\" he growled. \"That's nice. I won't write my will.\"  \"Stop acting like an old goat, you old goat,\" I snapped at him. \"I'll give you a prediction of my own: You'll be sick enough to die, but we'll find a way to do something about it.\"  \"Well, now _you're_ a PC!\" he huffed. I like to think I have a little, now and then. It's ever so short in range, and highly erratic, but I have had my flashes.  \"Just one thing,\" I said to him. \"As a surgeon who has done a lot of heart work, I want you in the heart clinic on the day these witches say you're going to be sick. It will certainly make a lot of us feel better, and the worst that can happen is that you can tell both those witches they don't know the right time.\"  I didn't get to first base. \"Now I'll tell you something, Wally Bupp!\" he said loudly. \"I was fool enough to pay attention to what that witch of yours said, and I've had a complete checkup. The heart people can't find a thing the matter with my heart. The devil you say! I won't go near your hospital. Now get out of here and don't give me another word about the PC powers of that fraud.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I let a week go by after that, not quite able to figure out what I should do. One night, after a dinner that Pheola had cooked for me as part of her transparent scheme to convince me she was God's own gift to Lefty Bupp, I raised a question with her.  \"You are still sure,\" I said, loading the dishwasher, \"about Pete Maragon?\"  \"Yes,\" she said. \"He'll have a heart attack.\"  \"All right. Exactly when?\"  \"The nineteenth. Thursday,\" she said.  \"We've got to pin point this thing,\" I said as we went back to her living room. \"Do you think you are ready to do some serious diagnosis?\"  \"Of the Grand Master?\" she asked me.  \"Sure. I can get you into his office without too much trouble. What I want you to do is feel around inside his heart. The sawbones from the clinic can't find anything out of line, and I think you can. Can you PC that?\"  She smiled at me. \"Of course,\" she said. \"You'll take me there in the morning.\"  I did, of course.  Maragon gave us an appointment when I assured him that I wanted to show him some aspects of Pheola's healing powers and that PC wasn't going to enter into the discussion. His spooky clairvoyant let us in with a knowing smile and we found the old goat pouring over some papers in front of him on the big slab of walnut.  He was really quite nice to Pheola. \"Well, well, young woman,\" he said, \"Lefty tells me that you are coming along.\"  \"I hope so, Mr. Maragon,\" she said.  \"Well, Lefty,\" he said, after he had shown us both into the handsome chairs he had drawn up in front of his desk, \"you were going to have Pheola give me some kind of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30770"],["title","The Right Time (#4)"],["body","nstration.\"  \"Sure,\" I said. \"First off I want you to know that she can qualify as a TK. Her healing powers are a subtle form of that. But as proof, she'll give a demonstration with weights.\"  I drew the carrying case from my pocket and laid four pith balls on his desk, as well as a ten-gram standard TK weight.  \"Ten grams?\" he said, interested.  \"Maybe,\" I grinned. \"We haven't tried this outside our own company. Pretty big emotional quotient here, you know.\"  He shook his head. \"It has to be reproducible, Lefty,\" he said, but in a kindly tone. \"Let me see it, Pheola.\"  She was really pretty good, and the pith balls behaved quite well. The first time around, the ten-gram weight stopped her cold, but by laying it on my palm, she got a good grip and thereafter was able to make it perform.  \"Very nicely done,\" the old goat grumbled. He hadn't expected anything of the kind. But I was only half through with him.  \"Now,\" I said. \"The more important part of the demonstration. Do you object to a little minor pain?\"  \"I certainly do,\" he growled, bringing his bushy brows down.  \"Well, the only way you can tell that Pheola is able to employ her TK within you is to give you a little sensation. It will only be some twinges,\" I said.  He wanted to argue about it, and I dragged the conversation out until I felt a little tug on my ear. Pheola had completed her scan of Maragon's heart.  \"Oof!\" he said as she hit him lightly in the diaphragm. Then she made his hands jump, first one and then the other. None of it felt real good, I could see, from the flinching and lip biting that was going on across the desk.  \"That's enough!\" he exclaimed as she went to work on his throat. His hand flew up to massage his larynx. \"Quite convincing, young woman. But what is it good for?\"  I laughed at him. \"What are most Psi powers good for?\" I asked him. \"All that we require for membership is that a person be able to display them under standardized conditions.\"  \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"Yes, I guess that's so. Well, I gather you'll be ready to go into your act at the next Chapter Meeting, then?\"  Pheola nodded. \"I hope so,\" she said.  \"I do, too,\" the old goat agreed, getting in the last word. \"It would be nice if you could figure out what to do with your ability to snap my nerve-strings!\"         *       *       *       *       *  We were silent in the ride down the elevator to our apartments. I took the chance that Pete wasn't having us peeped, and spoke as soon as we were in my study.  \"What did you find out, Pheola?\" I asked her.  \"I could feel something, Lefty,\" she said. \"When you had the heart model over at the hospital, you showed me the coronary artery, you remember?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"There are two little bumps in his artery, one about three times as large as the other.\"  \"Bumps?\" I said, frowning. \"I'm not sure I know what that means, Pheola.\"  \"Well, remember how I told you that your own arteries were nice and clear?\"  I nodded.  \"His coronary artery isn't like that. It's sort of caked and crusty. And I think some of that coating has broken away in a couple spots, and they are like scabs on the sores, only they aren't hard.\"  This was as close to a classic description of coronary clotting as I figured I would get in nontechnical terms. What her words mean to me was that Maragon's coronary artery, as in many men his age, was somewhat choked with deposits of cholesterol. In a couple places the deposit had broken away, exposing the raw surface of the artery. But instead of scar tissue forming to heal the open spot, clotting had taken place. And if either of those clots broke loose, and plugged one of the minor arteries in the heart, we'd see a coronary attack as that part of the muscle was starved for blood and died.  The information was useless, in a medical sense. There is no surgery for the condition. There was, however, something untried that could possibly be done.  \"Where is it going to happen?\" I asked her. \"The heart attack?\"  \"In the hospital,\" she said.  \"And what will I have you do?\"  She frowned for a moment. \"You want me to cure it,\" she said. \"I'm not sure I understand how.\"  \"I do,\" I said. \"That's enough. From here on I just want to work a two-horse parlay. The old goat can't help but be convinced by the demonstration you are going to give him. The thing that I want is for him to agree that your PC powers exist at the same time. We'll whipsaw him good.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the morning, after the first surgery was over, I went downstairs to the heart clinic. Doc Swartz was in his office. He's the best heart man at Memorial, and I figured that Maragon would have gone to him.  \"What's up, Lefty?\" he asked as I came in to his office and shut the door against some of the smells of the hospital. \"How is your scalpel work coming?\"  \"I'll be doing my own cutting any day now,\" I said. \"I came on another errand.\"  \"So?\"  \"Did you give Maragon's heart a checkup in the last couple of weeks?\" I asked.  \"None of your business,\" he smiled. \"You know I can't talk about my patients.\"  \"This is Lodge business, Doc,\" I protested. \"I know you aren't a Psi, and thus aren't subject to our discipline, but I think it's time we exchanged some information.\"  \"Exchanged?\"  I nodded. \"You know--or do you know--that I've been working with a girl, giving her some training.\"  \"No,\" he said. \"I don't hear much about the Lodge. You folks are pretty tight-mouthed around Normals.\"  \"Sure,\" I said, not wanting to appear uncomfortable about it. Doc was all right--he never showed any resentment that he didn't have Psi powers. Quite sensibly, he was satisfied with his own normal skills. \"Well, this girl is a very delicate telekinetic,\" I told him. \"She is the one who brought my right arm back to life. She's good.\"  \"She must be,\" he agreed. \"I know that stumped every neurologist over here.\"  \"Right,\" I said, \"She has been exploring the insides of Maragon's heart.\"  \"What!\"  \"Sense of perception--light TK touch--anything you want to call it. I can get her to demonstrate, if you insist. But you can take my word for it. She can feel her way around inside your body the way you can feel your way around the outside.\"  \"And what is her diagnosis?\" he said, irritated now. _He_ was the heart expert.  I told him about the clots, and he nodded as he got the picture. \"A classic description,\" he agreed. \"But what can we do about it? Clots like that are next to impossible to break down. If they flake away in too big a chunk, they can kill.\"  \"I know,\" I agreed. \"But there is more to the story. Pheola is a precog as well. She says that one of the clots will break loose on the nineteenth, and that Maragon will have an attack. I want to make sure he is over here, in a hospital bed, with you on hand, when it happens.\"  \"You Psi's!\" he said. \"Do I have to take this seriously, that this woman can tell the future?\"  \"Yes, you do,\" I said. \"One of our other PC's confirms it.\"  \"That just doubles the creepiness,\" he said. \"How can I manage it, even if it's true?\"  \"Tell the old goat that more detailed examination of his EKG makes you want him in for observation. Even Maragon listens to doctors. Tell him whatever it takes to get him to bed that morning. You might even bring him in the night before.\"  Doc Swartz shrugged. \"I guess I'll have to play your game,\" he decided. \"But this had better be good!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I never did learn what Doc Swartz told the Grand Master, or how much the old goat suspected. But I learned from my hospital sources that Maragon was scheduled to enter the heart clinic the night of the eighteenth for \"tests.\"  I let Pheola set the timing for us, and we showed up at his room around ten on the morning of the nineteenth, shortly before Pheola predicted his heart attack would occur.  The old goat was sitting up in bed as he was being examined by Doc Swartz and another sawbones. Leads from the EKG led from his chest and wrists. He fired one scorching glance at the two of us.  \"What is this?\" he demanded. \"Get out of here!\"  I shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said. \"I'm an accredited surgeon at this hospital.\"  \"What about her?\" he growled, pushing Swartz away from him. \"Get that witch out of here!\"  \"A diagnosis is about to be made,\" I said, bringing Pheola to his side. \"And it would help if you shut up for a couple minutes.\"  He turned angrily to Swartz, but I had him pretty well cowed, and he shook his head. \"We could use some help, Mr. Maragon,\" he said. \"There are some anomalies in your EKG that this lady's Psi powers may help us resolve. I should think that you, of all people, would want....\"  \"Oh, shut up!\" he grumped. \"You are ganging up on me. Go ahead,\" he snapped at Pheola. \"And get it over with!\"  His gown had been pushed down from his shoulders for Doc Swartz's stethoscope work, and the mat of graying hair on his chest was exposed. Pheola laid a hand on his chest--she seemed to have a better feel after a touch, just as I do with the weights. There was a dead silence in the room as she stood there, eyes closed, and slowly ran her fingers over his rib cage. After some minutes her eyes opened, and she came back to my side.  \"Still the same,\" she said. I nodded and looked over at Swartz.  \"Well,\" Maragon growled, \"have you ill-assorted characters agreed on a diagnosis?\"  \"In a sense,\" I told him. \"It's nothing that every doctor in this room couldn't have guessed at without bothering to examine you. You're sixty years old, and you've got sixty-year-old arteries. That's all.\"  [Illustration]  \"Great,\" he said, reaching for the thin blanket that covered his chunky legs. \"Then I can....\"  He stopped, and a spasm crossed his face.  It went away, and he slowly turned to face Pheola, a sort of angry consternation coloring his features. \"You witch!\" he whispered. Then the pain hit him much harder. \"My arm!\" he said.  There were doctors around him in a flash. He was still wired to the EKG machine. \"That's it!\" the"]]]
