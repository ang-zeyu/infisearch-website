Walter stood on the stern and beheld, yet more with the mind of him than with his eyes; for it all seemed but the double of what the other ship had done; and the thought of it as if the twain were as beads strung on one string and led away by it into the same place, and thence to go in the like order, and so on again and again, and never to draw nigher to each other.     CHAPTER III: WALTER HEARETH TIDINGS OF THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER   Fast sailed the Katherine over the seas, and nought befell to tell of, either to herself or her crew.  She came to one cheaping-town and then to another, and so on to a third and a fourth; and at each was buying and selling after the manner of chapmen; and Walter not only looked on the doings of his father's folk, but lent a hand, what he might, to help them in all matters, whether it were in seaman's craft, or in chaffer.  And the further he went and the longer the time wore, the more he was eased of his old trouble wherein his wife and her treason had to do.  But as for the other trouble, to wit his desire and longing to come up with those three, it yet flickered before him; and though he had not seen them again as one sees people in the streets, and as if he might touch them if he would, yet were their images often before his mind's eye; and yet, as time wore, not so often, nor so troublously; and forsooth both to those about him and to himself, he seemed as a man well healed of his melancholy mood.  Now they left that fourth stead, and sailed over the seas and came to a fifth, a very great and fair city, which they had made more than seven months from Langton on Holm; and by this time was Walter taking heed and joyance in such things as were toward in that fair city, so far from his kindred, and especially he looked on the fair women there, and desired them, and loved them; but lightly, as befalleth young men.  Now this was the last country whereto the Katherine was boun; so there they abode some ten months in daily chaffer, and in pleasuring them in beholding all that there was of rare and goodly, and making merry with the merchants and the towns-folk, and the country-folk beyond the gates, and Walter was grown as busy and gay as a strong young man is like to be, and was as one who would fain be of some account amongst his own folk.  But at the end of this while, it befell on a day, as he was leaving his hostel for his booth in the market, and had the door in his hand, there stood before him three mariners in the guise of his own country, and with them was one of clerkly aspect, whom he knew at once for his father's scrivener, Arnold Penstrong by name; and when Walter saw him his heart failed him and he cried out: \"Arnold, what tidings?  Is all well with the folk at Langton?\"  Said Arnold: \"Evil tidings are come with me; matters are ill with thy folk; for I may not hide that thy father, Bartholomew Golden, is dead, God rest his soul.\"  At that word it was to Walter as if all that trouble which but now had sat so light upon him, was once again fresh and heavy, and that his past life of the last few months had never been; and it was to him as if he saw his father lying dead on his bed, and heard the folk lamenting about the house.  He held his peace awhile, and then he said in a voice as of an angry man:  \"What, Arnold! and did he die in his bed, or how? for he was neither old nor ailing when we parted.\"  Said Arnold: \"Yea, in his bed he died: but first he was somewhat sword- bitten.\"  \"Yea, and how?\" quoth Walter.  Said Arnold: \"When thou wert gone, in a few days' wearing, thy father sent thy wife out of his house back to her kindred of the Reddings with no honour, and yet with no such shame as might have been, without blame to us of those who knew the tale of thee and her; which, God-a-mercy, will be pretty much the whole of the city.\"  \"Nevertheless, the Reddings took it amiss, and would have a mote with us Goldings to talk of booting.  By ill-luck we yea-said that for the saving of the city's peace.  But what betid?  We met in our Gild-hall, and there befell the talk between us; and in that talk certain words could not be hidden, though they were none too seemly nor too meek.  And the said words once spoken drew forth the whetted steel; and there then was the hewing and thrusting!  Two of ours were slain outright on the floor, and four of theirs, and many were hurt on either side.  Of these was thy father, for as thou mayst well deem, he was nought backward in the fray; but despite his hurts, two in the side and one on the arm, he went home on his own feet, and we deemed that we had come to our above.  But well-a- way! it was an evil victory, whereas in ten days he died of his hurts. God have his soul!  But now, my master, thou mayst well wot that I am not come to tell thee this only, but moreover to bear the word of the kindred, to wit that thou come back with me straightway in the swift cutter which hath borne me and the tidings; and thou mayst look to it, that though she be swift and light, she is a keel full weatherly.\"  Then said Walter: \"This is a bidding of war.  Come back will I, and the Reddings shall wot of my coming.  Are ye all-boun?\"  \"Yea,\" said Arnold, \"we may up anchor this very day, or to-morrow morn at latest.  But what aileth thee, master, that thou starest so wild over my shoulder?  I pray thee take it not so much to heart!  Ever it is the wont of fathers to depart this world before their sons.\"  But Walter's visage from wrathful red had become pale, and he pointed up street, and cried out: \"Look! dost thou see?\"  \"See what, master?\" quoth Arnold: \"what! here cometh an ape in gay raiment; belike the beast of some jongleur.  Nay, by God's wounds! 'tis a man, though he be exceeding mis-shapen like a very devil.  Yea and now there cometh a pretty maid going as if she were of his meney; and lo! here, a most goodly and noble lady!  Yea, I see; and doubtless she owneth both the two, and is of the greatest of the folk of this fair city; for on the maiden's ankle I saw an iron ring, which betokeneth thralldom amongst these aliens.  But this is strange! for notest thou not how the folk in the street heed not this quaint show; nay not even the stately lady, though she be as lovely as a goddess of the gentiles, and beareth on her gems that would buy Langton twice over; surely they must be over- wont to strange and gallant sights.  But now, master, but now!\"  \"Yea, what is it?\" said Walter.  \"Why, master, they should not yet be gone out of eye-shot, yet gone they are.  What is become of them, are they sunk into the earth?\"  \"Tush, man!\" said Walter, looking not on Arnold, but still staring down the street; \"they have gone into some house while thine eyes were turned from them a moment.\"  \"Nay, master, nay,\" said Arnold, \"mine eyes were not off them one instant of time.\"  \"Well,\" said Walter, somewhat snappishly, \"they are gone now, and what have we to do to heed such toys, we with all this grief and strife on our hands?  Now would I be alone to turn the matter of thine errand over in my mind.  Meantime do thou tell the shipmaster Geoffrey and our other folk of these tidings, and thereafter get thee all ready; and come hither to me before sunrise to-morrow, and I shall be ready for my part; and so sail we back to Langton.\"  Therewith he turned him back into the house, and the others went their ways; but Walter sat alone in his chamber a long while, and pondered these things in his mind.  And whiles he made up his mind that he would think no more of the vision of those three, but would fare back to Langton, and enter into the strife with the Reddings and quell them, or die else.  But lo, when he was quite steady in this doom, and his heart was lightened thereby, he found that he thought no more of the Reddings and their strife, but as matters that were passed and done with, and that now he was thinking and devising if by any means he might find out in what land dwelt those three.  And then again he strove to put that from him, saying that what he had seen was but meet for one brainsick, and a dreamer of dreams.  But furthermore he thought, Yea, and was Arnold, who this last time had seen the images of those three, a dreamer of waking dreams? for he was nought wonted in such wise; then thought he: At least I am well content that he spake to me of their likeness, not I to him; for so I may tell that there was at least something before my eyes which grew not out of mine own brain.  And yet again, why should I follow them; and what should I get by it; and indeed how shall I set about it?  Thus he turned the matter over and over; and at last, seeing that if he grew no foolisher over it, he grew no wiser, he became weary thereof, and bestirred him, and saw to the trussing up of his goods, and made all ready for his departure, and so wore the day and slept at nightfall; and at daybreak comes Arnold to lead him to their keel, which hight the Bartholomew.  He tarried nought, and with few farewells went aboard ship, and an hour after they were in the open sea with the ship's head turned toward Langton on Holm.     CHAPTER IV: STORM BEFALLS THE BARTHOLOMEW, AND SHE IS DRIVEN OFF HER COURSE   Now swift sailed the Bartholomew for four weeks toward the north-west with a fair wind, and all was well with ship and crew.  Then the wind died out on even of a day, so that the ship scarce made way at all, though she rolled in a great swell of the sea, so great, that it seemed to ridge all the main athwart.  Moreover"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3055"],["title","The Wood Beyond the World (#2)"],["body"," in the west was a great bank of cloud huddled up in haze, whereas for twenty days past the sky had been clear, save for a few bright white clouds flying before the wind.  Now the shipmaster, a man right cunning in his craft, looked long on sea and sky, and then turned and bade the mariners take in sail and be right heedful.  And when Walter asked him what he looked for, and wherefore he spake not to him thereof, he said surlily: \"Why should I tell thee what any fool can see without telling, to wit that there is weather to hand?\"  So they abode what should befall, and Walter went to his room to sleep away the uneasy while, for the night was now fallen; and he knew no more till he was waked up by great hubbub and clamour of the shipmen, and the whipping of ropes, and thunder of flapping sails, and the tossing and weltering of the ship withal.  But, being a very stout-hearted young man, he lay still in his room, partly because he was a landsman, and had no mind to tumble about amongst the shipmen and hinder them; and withal he said to himself: What matter whether I go down to the bottom of the sea, or come back to Langton, since either way my life or my death will take away from me the fulfilment of desire?  Yet soothly if there hath been a shift of wind, that is not so ill; for then shall we be driven to other lands, and so at the least our home-coming shall be delayed, and other tidings may hap amidst of our tarrying.  So let all be as it will.  So in a little while, in spite of the ship's wallowing and the tumult of the wind and waves, he fell asleep again, and woke no more till it was full daylight, and there was the shipmaster standing in the door of his room, the sea-water all streaming from his wet-weather raiment.  He said to Walter: \"Young master, the sele of the day to thee!  For by good hap we have gotten into another day.  Now I shall tell thee that we have striven to beat, so as not to be driven off our course, but all would not avail, wherefore for these three hours we have been running before the wind; but, fair sir, so big hath been the sea that but for our ship being of the stoutest, and our men all yare, we had all grown exceeding wise concerning the ground of the mid-main.  Praise be to St. Nicholas and all Hallows! for though ye shall presently look upon a new sea, and maybe a new land to boot, yet is that better than looking on the ugly things down below.\"  \"Is all well with ship and crew then?\" said Walter.  \"Yea forsooth,\" said the shipmaster; \"verily the Bartholomew is the darling of Oak Woods; come up and look at it, how she is dealing with wind and waves all free from fear.\"  So Walter did on his foul-weather raiment, and went up on to the quarter- deck, and there indeed was a change of days; for the sea was dark and tumbling mountain-high, and the white-horses were running down the valleys thereof, and the clouds drave low over all, and bore a scud of rain along with them; and though there was but a rag of sail on her, the ship flew before the wind, rolling a great wash of water from bulwark to bulwark.  Walter stood looking on it all awhile, holding on by a stay-rope, and saying to himself that it was well that they were driving so fast toward new things.  Then the shipmaster came up to him and clapped him on the shoulder and said: \"Well, shipmate, cheer up! and now come below again and eat some meat, and drink a cup with me.\"  So Walter went down and ate and drank, and his heart was lighter than it had been since he had heard of his father's death, and the feud awaiting him at home, which forsooth he had deemed would stay his wanderings a weary while, and therewithal his hopes.  But now it seemed as if he needs must wander, would he, would he not; and so it was that even this fed his hope; so sore his heart clung to that desire of his to seek home to those three that seemed to call him unto them.     CHAPTER V: NOW THEY COME TO A NEW LAND   Three days they drave before the wind, and on the fourth the clouds lifted, the sun shone out and the offing was clear; the wind had much abated, though it still blew a breeze, and was a head wind for sailing toward the country of Langton.  So then the master said that, since they were bewildered, and the wind so ill to deal with, it were best to go still before the wind that they might make some land and get knowledge of their whereabouts from the folk thereof.  Withal he said that he deemed the land not to be very far distant.  So did they, and sailed on pleasantly enough, for the weather kept on mending, and the wind fell till it was but a light breeze, yet still foul for Langton.  So wore three days, and on the eve of the third, the man from the topmast cried out that he saw land ahead; and so did they all before the sun was quite set, though it were but a cloud no bigger than a man's hand.  When night fell they struck not sail, but went forth toward the land fair and softly; for it was early summer, so that the nights were neither long nor dark.  But when it was broad daylight, they opened a land, a long shore of rocks and mountains, and nought else that they could see at first.  Nevertheless as day wore and they drew nigher, first they saw how the mountains fell away from the sea, and were behind a long wall of sheer cliff; and coming nigher yet, they beheld a green plain going up after a little in green bents and slopes to the feet of the said cliff-wall.  No city nor haven did they see there, not even when they were far nigher to the land; nevertheless, whereas they hankered for the peace of the green earth after all the tossing and unrest of the sea, and whereas also they doubted not to find at the least good and fresh water, and belike other bait in the plain under the mountains, they still sailed on not unmerrily; so that by nightfall they cast anchor in five-fathom water hard by the shore.  Next morning they found that they were lying a little way off the mouth of a river not right great; so they put out their boats and towed the ship up into the said river, and when they had gone up it for a mile or thereabouts they found the sea water failed, for little was the ebb and flow of the tide on that coast.  Then was the river deep and clear, running between smooth grassy land like to meadows.  Also on their left board they saw presently three head of neat cattle going, as if in a meadow of a homestead in their own land, and a few sheep; and thereafter, about a bow-draught from the river, they saw a little house of wood and straw-thatch under a wooded mound, and with orchard trees about it.  They wondered little thereat, for they knew no cause why that land should not be builded, though it were in the far outlands.  However, they drew their ship up to the bank, thinking that they would at least abide awhile and ask tidings and have some refreshing of the green plain, which was so lovely and pleasant.  But while they were busied herein they saw a man come out of the house, and down to the river to meet them; and they soon saw that he was tall and old, long-hoary of hair and beard, and clad mostly in the skins of beasts.  He drew nigh without any fear or mistrust, and coming close to them gave them the sele of the day in a kindly and pleasant voice.  The shipmaster greeted him in his turn, and said withal: \"Old man, art thou the king of this country?\"  The elder laughed; \"It hath had none other a long while,\" said he; \"and at least there is no other son of Adam here to gainsay.\"  \"Thou art alone here then?\" said the master.  \"Yea,\" said the old man; \"save for the beasts of the field and the wood, and the creeping things, and fowl.  Wherefore it is sweet to me to hear your voices.\"  Said the master: \"Where be the other houses of the town?\"  The old man laughed.  Said he: \"When I said that I was alone, I meant that I was alone in the land and not only alone in this stead.  There is no house save this betwixt the sea and the dwellings of the Bears, over the cliff-wall yonder, yea and a long way over it.\"  \"Yea,\" quoth the shipmaster grinning, \"and be the bears of thy country so manlike, that they dwell in builded houses?\"  The old man shook his head.  \"Sir,\" said he, \"as to their bodily fashion, it is altogether manlike, save that they be one and all higher and bigger than most.  For they be bears only in name; they be a nation of half wild men; for I have been told by them that there be many more than that tribe whose folk I have seen, and that they spread wide about behind these mountains from east to west.  Now, sir, as to their souls and understandings I warrant them not; for miscreants they be, trowing neither in God nor his hallows.\"  Said the master: \"Trow they in Mahound then?\"  \"Nay,\" said the elder, \"I wot not for sure that they have so much as a false God; though I have it from them that they worship a certain woman with mickle worship.\"  Then spake Walter: \"Yea, good sir, and how knowest thou that? dost thou deal with them at all?\"  Said the old man: \"Whiles some of that folk come hither and have of me what I can spare; a calf or two, or a half-dozen of lambs or hoggets; or a skin of wine or cyder of mine own making: and they give me in return such things as I can use, as skins of hart and bear and other peltries; for now I am old, I can but little of the hunting hereabout.  Whiles, also, they bring little lumps of pure copper, and would give me gold also, but it is of little use in this lonely land.  Sooth to say, to me they are not masterful or rough-handed; but glad am I that they have been here but of late, and are not like to come again this while; for terrible they are of aspect, and whereas ye be aliens, belike they would not hold their hands from off you; and moreover ye have weapons and other matters which they would covet sorely.\"  Quoth the master: \"Since thou dealest with these wild men, will ye not deal with us in chaffer?  For whereas we are come from long travel, we hanker after fresh victual, and here aboard are"]]]
