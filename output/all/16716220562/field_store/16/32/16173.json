But in reading the complete course, which is annually consigned to my care, a more regular method will be necessary; and, till a better is proposed, I shall take the liberty to follow the same that I have already submitted to the public[q]. To fill up and finish that outline with propriety and correctness, and to render the whole intelligible to the uninformed minds of beginners, (whom we are too apt to suppose acquainted with terms and ideas, which they never had opportunity to learn) this must be my ardent endeavour, though by no means my promise to accomplish. You will permit me however very briefly to describe, rather what I conceive an academical expounder of the laws should do, than what I have ever known to be done.  [Footnote p: See Lowth's _Oratio Crewiana_, p. 365.]  [Footnote q: The Analysis of the laws of England, first published, _A.D._ 1756, and exhibiting the order and principal divisions of the ensuing COMMENTARIES; which were originally submitted to the university in a private course of lectures, _A.D._ 1753.]  HE should consider his course as a general map of the law, marking out the shape of the country, it's connexions and boundaries, it's greater divisions and principal cities: it is not his business to describe minutely the subordinate limits, or to fix the longitude and latitude of every inconsiderable hamlet. His attention should be engaged, like that of the readers in Fortescue's inns of chancery, \"in tracing out the originals and as it were the elements of the law.\" For if, as Justinian[r] has observed, the tender understanding of the student be loaded at the first with a multitude and variety of matter, it will either occasion him to desert his studies, or will carry him heavily through them, with much labour, delay, and despondence. These originals should be traced to their fountains, as well as our distance will permit; to the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by Caesar and Tacitus; to the codes of the northern nations on the continent, and more especially to those of our own Saxon princes; to the rules of the Roman law, either left here in the days of Papinian, or imported by Vacarius and his followers; but, above all, to that inexhaustible reservoir of legal antiquities and learning, the feodal law, or, as Spelman[s] has entitled it, the law of nations in our western orb. These primary rules and fundamental principles should be weighed and compared with the precepts of the law of nature, and the practice of other countries; should be explained by reasons, illustrated by examples, and confirmed by undoubted authorities; their history should be deduced, their changes and revolutions observed, and it should be shewn how far they are connected with, or have at any time been affected by, the civil transactions of the kingdom.  [Footnote r: _Incipientibus nobis exponere jura populi Romani, ita videntur tradi posse commodissime, si primo levi ac simplici via singula tradantur: Alioqui, si statim ab initio rudem adhuc & infirmum animum studiosi multitudine ac varietate rerum oneravimus, duorum alterum, aut desertorem studiorum efficiemus, aut cum magno labore, saepe etiam cum diffidentia (quae plerumque juvenes avertit) serius ad id perducemus, ad quod leviore via ductus, sine magno labore & sine ulla diffidentia maturius perduci potuisset._ _Inst._ 1. 1. 2.]  [Footnote s: Of Parliaments. 57.]  A PLAN of this nature, if executed with care and ability, cannot fail of administring a most useful and rational entertainment to students of all ranks and professions; and yet it must be confessed that the study of the laws is not merely a matter of amusement: for as a very judicious writer[t] has observed upon a similar occasion, the learner \"will be considerably disappointed if he looks for entertainment without the expence of attention.\" An attention, however, not greater than is usually bestowed in mastering the rudiments of other sciences, or sometimes in pursuing a favorite recreation or exercise. And this attention is not equally necessary to be exerted by every student upon every occasion. Some branches of the law, as the formal process of civil suits, and the subtile distinctions incident to landed property, which are the most difficult to be thoroughly understood, are the least worth the pains of understanding, except to such gentlemen as intend to pursue the profession. To others I may venture to apply, with a slight alteration, the words of sir John Fortescue[u], when first his royal pupil determines to engage in this study. \"It will not be necessary for a gentleman, as such, to examine with a close application the critical niceties of the law. It will fully be sufficient, and he may well enough be denominated a lawyer, if under the instruction of a master he traces up the principles and grounds of the law, even to their original elements. Therefore in a very short period, and with very little labour, he may be sufficiently informed in the laws of his country, if he will but apply his mind in good earnest to receive and apprehend them. For, though such knowlege as is necessary for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of twenty years, yet with a genius of tolerable perspicacity, that knowlege which is fit for a person of birth or condition may be learned in a single year, without neglecting his other improvements.\"  [Footnote t: Dr Taylor's preface to Elem. of civil law.]  [Footnote u: _Tibi, princeps, necesse non erit mysteria legis Angliae longo disciplinatu rimare. Sufficiet tibi,--_et fatis _denominari legista mereberis, si legum principia & causas, usque ad elementa, discipuli more indagaveris.--Quare tu, princeps serenissime, parvo tempore, parva industria, sufficienter eris in legibus regni Angliae eruditus, dummodo ad ejus apprehensionem tu conferas animum tuum.--Nosco namque ingenii tui perspicacitatem, quo audacter pronuntio quod in legibus illis (licet earum peritia, qualis judicibus necessaria est, vix viginti annorum lucubrationibus acquiratur) tu doctrinam principi congruam in anno uno sufficienter nancisceris; nec interim militarem disciplinam, ad quam tam ardenter anhelas, negliges; sed ea, recreationis loco, etiam anno illo tu ad libitum perfrueris._ _c._ 8.]  TO the few therefore (the very few, I am persuaded,) that entertain such unworthy notions of an university, as to suppose it intended for mere dissipation of thought; to such as mean only to while away the aukward interval from childhood to twenty one, between the restraints of the school and the licentiousness of politer life, in a calm middle state of mental and of moral inactivity; to these Mr Viner gives no invitation to an entertainment which they never can relish. But to the long and illustrious train of noble and ingenuous youth, who are not more distinguished among us by their birth and possessions, than by the regularity of their conduct and their thirst after useful knowlege, to these our benefactor has consecrated the fruits of a long and laborious life, worn out in the duties of his calling; and will joyfully reflect (if such reflexions can be now the employment of his thoughts) that he could not more effectually have benefited posterity, or contributed to the service of the public, than by founding an institution which may instruct the rising generation in the wisdom of our civil polity, and inform them with a desire to be still better acquainted with the laws and constitution of their country.     SECTION THE SECOND.  OF THE NATURE OF LAWS IN GENERAL.   LAW, in it's most general and comprehensive sense, signifies a rule of action; and is applied indiscriminately to all kinds of action, whether animate, or inanimate, rational or irrational. Thus we say, the laws of motion, of gravitation, of optics, or mechanics, as well as the laws of nature and of nations. And it is that rule of action, which is prescribed by some superior, and which the inferior is bound to obey.  THUS when the supreme being formed the universe, and created matter out of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter, from which it can never depart, and without which it would cease to be. When he put that matter into motion, he established certain laws of motion, to which all moveable bodies must conform. And, to descend from the greatest operations to the smallest, when a workman forms a clock, or other piece of mechanism, he establishes at his own pleasure certain arbitrary laws for it's direction; as that the hand shall describe a given space in a given time; to which law as long as the work conforms, so long it continues in perfection, and answers the end of it's formation.  IF we farther advance, from mere inactive matter to vegetable and animal life, we shall find them still governed by laws; more numerous indeed, but equally fixed and invariable. The whole progres of plants, from the seed to the root, and from thence to the seed again;--the method of animal nutrition, digestion, secretion, and all other branches of vital oeconomy;--are not left to chance, or the will of the creature itself, but are performed in a wondrous involuntary manner, and guided by unerring rules laid down by the great creator.  THIS then is the general signification of law, a rule of action dictated by some superior being; and in those creatures that have neither the power to think, nor to will, such laws must be invariably obeyed, so long as the creature itself subsists, for it's existence depends on that obedience. But laws, in their more confined sense, and in which it is our present business to consider them, denote the rules, not of action in general, but of _human_ action or conduct: that is, the precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary beings, a creature endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30816"],["title","A World (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:    This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact & Fiction October 1963.

[Illustration]  McLeod heard the door chime, opened the door, and had to back up as eight men crowded in. The one in the lead flashed a fancily engraved ID card and said: \"Union Bureau of Investigation. You're Professor Mac-Lee-Odd.\" It was a statement, not a question.  \"No,\" McLeod said flatly, \"I am not. I never heard of such a name.\" He waited while the U.B.I. man blinked once, then added: \"If you are looking for Professor MuhCloud, I'm he.\" It always irritated him when people mispronounced his name, and in this case there was no excuse for it.  \"All right, Professor McLeod,\" said the U.B.I. agent, pronouncing it properly this time, \"however you want it. Mind if we ask you a few questions?\"  McLeod stared at him for half a second. Eight men, all of them under thirty-five, in top physical condition. He was fifteen years older than the oldest and had confined his exercise, in the words of Chauncey de Pew, to \"acting as pallbearer for my friends who take exercise.\" Not that he was really in poor shape, but he certainly couldn't have argued with eight men like these.  \"Come in,\" he said calmly, waving them into the apartment.  Six of them entered. The other two stayed outside in the hall.  Five of the six remained standing. The leader took the chair that McLeod offered him.  \"What are your questions, Mr. Jackson?\" McLeod asked.  Jackson looked very slightly surprised, as if he were not used to having people read the name on his card during the short time he allowed them to see it. The expression vanished almost instantaneously. \"Professor,\" he said, \"we'd like to know what subjects you discussed with the Galactic who just left.\"  McLeod allowed himself to relax back in his chair. \"Let me ask you two questions, Mr. Jackson. One: What the hell business is it of yours? Two: Why do you ask me when you already know?\"  Again there was only a flicker of expression over Jackson's face. \"Professor McLeod, we are concerned about the welfare of the human race. Your ... uh ... co-operation is requested.\"  \"You don't have to come barging in here with an armed squad just to ask my co-operation,\" McLeod said. \"What do you want to know?\"  Jackson took a notebook out of his jacket pocket. \"We'll just get a few facts straight first, professor,\" he said, leafing through the notebook. \"You were first approached by a Galactic four years ago, on January 12, 1990. Is that right?\"  McLeod, who had taken a cigarette from his pack and started to light it, stopped suddenly and looked at Jackson as though the U.B.I. man were a two-headed embryo. \"Yes, Mr. Jackson, that is right,\" he said slowly, as though he were speaking to a low-grade moron. \"And the capital of California is Sacramento. Are there any further matters of public knowledge you would like to ask me about? Would you like to know when the War of 1812 started or who is buried in Grant's Tomb?\"  Jackson's jaw muscles tightened, then relaxed. \"There's no need to get sarcastic, professor. Just answer the questions.\" He looked back at the notebook. \"According to the record, you, as a zoologist, were asked to accompany a shipment of animals to a planet named ... uh ... Gelakin. You did so. You returned after eighteen months. Is that correct?\"  \"To the best of my knowledge, yes,\" McLeod said with heavy, biting sarcasm. \"And the date of the Norman Conquest was A.D. 1066.\"  Jackson balled his fists suddenly and closed his eyes. \"Mac. Loud. _Stop._ It.\" He was obviously holding himself under rigorous restraint. He opened his eyes. \"There are reasons for asking these questions, professor. Very good reasons. Will you let me finish?\"  McLeod had finished lighting his cigarette. He snapped his lighter off and replaced it in his pocket. \"Perhaps,\" he said mildly. \"May I make a statement first?\"  Jackson took a deep breath, held it for a moment, then exhaled slowly. \"Go ahead.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Thank you.\" There was no sarcasm in McLeod's voice now, only patience. \"First--for the record--I'll say that I consider it impertinent of you to come in here demanding information without explanation. No, Jackson; don't say anything. You said I could make a statement. Thank you. Second, I will state that I am perfectly aware of why the questions are being asked.  \"No reaction, Mr. Jackson? You don't believe that? Very well. Let me continue.  \"On January twelve, nineteen-ninety, I was offered a job by certain citizens of the Galactic Civilization. These citizens of the Galactic Civilization wanted to take a shipload of Terrestrial animals to their own planet, Gelakin. They knew almost nothing about the care and feeding of Terrestrial animals. They needed an expert. They should have taken a real expert--one of the men from the Bronx Zoo, for instance. They didn't; they requested a zoologist. Because the request was made here in America, I was the one who was picked. Any one of seven other men could have handled the job, but I was picked.  \"So I went, thus becoming the first Earthman ever to leave the Solar System.  \"I took care of the animals. I taught the Galactics who were with me to handle and feed them. I did what I was paid to do, and it was a hard job. None of them knew anything about the care and feeding of elephants, horses, giraffes, cats, dogs, eagles, or any one of the other hundreds of Terrestrial life forms that went aboard that ship.  \"All of this was done with the express permission of the Terrestrial Union Government.  \"I was returned to Earth on July seventeen, nineteen-ninety-one.  \"I was immediately taken to U.B.I. headquarters and subjected to rigorous questioning. Then I was subjected to further questioning while connected to a polyelectro-encephalograph. Then I was subjected to hearing the same questions over again while under the influence of various drugs--in sequence and in combination. The consensus at that time was that I was not lying nor had I been subjected to what is commonly known as 'brain washing'. My memories were accurate and complete.  \"I did not know then, nor do I know now, the location of the planet Gelakin. This information was not denied me by the Galactics; I simply could not understand the terms they used. All I can say now--and all I could say then--is that Gelakin is some three point five kiloparsecs from Sol in the general direction of Saggitarius.\"  \"You don't know any more about that now than you did then?\" Jackson interrupted, suddenly and quickly.  \"That's what I said,\" McLeod snapped. \"And that's what I meant. Let me finish.  \"I was handsomely paid for my work in Galactic money. They use the English word 'credit', but I'm not sure the English word has exactly the same meaning as the Galactic term. At any rate, my wages, if such I may call them, were confiscated by the Earth Government; I was given the equivalent in American dollars--after the eighty per cent income tax had been deducted. I ended up with just about what I would have made if I had stayed home and drawn my salary from Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History.  \"Please, Mr. Jackson. I only have a little more to say.  \"I decided to write a book in order to make the trip pay off. 'Interstellar Ark' was a popularized account of the trip that made me quite a nice piece of change because every literate and half-literate person on Earth is curious about the Galactics. The book tells everything I know about the trip and the people. It is a matter of public record. Since that is so, I refused to answer a lot of darn-fool questions--by which I mean that I refuse to answer any more questions that you already know the answers to. I am not being stubborn; I am just sick and tired of the whole thing.\"  Actually, the notoriety that had resulted from the trip and the book had not pleased McLeod particularly. He had never had any strong desire for fame, but if it had come as a result of his work in zoology and the related sciences he would have accepted the burden. If his \"The Ecology of the Martian Polar Regions\" had attracted a hundredth of the publicity and sold a hundredth of the number of copies that \"Interstellar Ark\" had sold, he would have been gratified indeed. But the way things stood, he found the whole affair irksome.  Jackson looked at his notebook as if he expected to see answers written there instead of questions. Then he looked back up at McLeod. \"All right then, professor, what about this afternoon's conference. _That_ isn't a matter of public record.\"  \"And technically it isn't any of your business, either,\" McLeod said tiredly. \"But since you have the whole conversation down on tape, I don't see why you bother asking me. I'm well aware that you can pick up conversations in my apartment.\"  Jackson pursed his lips and glanced at another of the agents, who raised his eyebrows slightly.  McLeod got it in spite of the fact that they didn't intend him to. His place was bugged, all right, but somehow the Galactic had managed to nullify their instruments! No wonder they were in such a tizzy.  McLeod smiled, pleased with himself and with the world for the first time that afternoon. He decided, however, that he'd better volunteer the information before they threatened him with the Planetary Security Act. That threat would make him angry, he knew, and he might "]]]
