Johnnie won't think of anything else until the twenty-third of August.\"  \"What's going to happen then?\" Spot inquired.  \"That's the day when the circus comes to the village,\" the old horse explained. \"The whole family's going to see it.\"  \"Do you expect to take them?\"  \"No!\" Ebenezer replied. \"Farmer Green will hitch the bays to the carryall. And to tell the truth, I'll be just as pleased to stay behind. It will be a great day to take naps here at home.\"  \"It will be a lonesome day, with everybody away,\" said Spot. \"I believe I'll go to the circus myself.\"  \"Farmer Green may decide to leave you here,\" the old horse suggested.  \"Then I'll surprise him,\" said Spot. \"I'll hide behind a tree until Farmer Green has driven out of the yard. And then I'll follow the carryall.\"  The old dog began to tell everybody in the farmyard that he was going to the circus on the twenty-third of August. Of course some of the farmyard folk were jealous of him. The Rooster remarked that he didn't believe Spot would hear any _crowing_ at the circus that would be worth listening to. Turkey Proudfoot said that when it came to _strutting_ the circus couldn't show Spot any that couldn't be beaten right there on the farm. And Henrietta Hen, who went to the county fair the year before, declared that she shouldn't care to go to the village except to see a poultry show.  But old dog Spot didn't mind anything they said. And when the twenty-third of August came he lingered about the farmyard. Early in the morning he saw Farmer Green run the carryall into the yard and harness the bays to it. Then the rest of the family came out of the house.  Spot, from his hiding place behind a tree, was pleased to see that Johnnie Green did not forget to bring a big lunch basket with him.  At last everybody was ready to start. And then, to Spot's dismay, Farmer Green caught sight of his nose, sticking out from behind a tree.  \"That dog means to follow us,\" he cried. \"I'll have to shut him up in the barn.\" And to old Spot he called, \"Come here, sir!\"  Spot didn't dare disobey. With his tail between his legs he crept up to the carryall. And though he whined and begged to be taken to the circus, Farmer Green caught hold of his collar and led him into the barn. Then Farmer Green closed the door.  Poor Spot had to give one loud howl when he heard the wheels of the carryall crunching on the gravel driveway.     XX  SPOT GOES TO TOWN   The bays had to step lively that morning, for Farmer Green's family didn't want to be late for the circus parade in the village.  There were many other teams on the road, and almost nobody to be seen working in the fields. It seemed to Johnnie Green as if everybody had made up his mind to go to the circus. The only thing that troubled him was that his father didn't drive fast enough to suit him.  Half way from the farm to the village Farmer Green stopped the bays at a watering trough. Johnnie jumped out of the carryall to uncheck them, so they could drink. And there, beneath the carriage, was old dog Spot!  \"Spot's followed us!\" Johnnie Green cried.  The old dog whisked out from between the wheels and frolicked about Johnnie. He didn't act at all guilty.  \"Well, I never!\" said Farmer Green. \"I certainly shut the barn door after I shoved him inside.\"  Spot gave a few short, sharp barks, as if to say, \"Yes! But you forgot the window that was open.\"  He had scrambled through the window and overtaken the carryall before it reached the gristmill.  Well, what could Farmer Green do? They had come too far to send Spot back home.  \"We'll have to take him with us now,\" said Johnnie Green's father, \"though he'll be a nuisance because the village will be crowded to-day.\"  As soon as the bays had had their drink the party started on again. And old dog Spot was content. He did not mind the dust that the bays' heels kicked up as he followed beneath the carriage. And the faster they trotted, the more they pleased him; for he was as anxious as Johnnie Green to get to town and see the crowds and the fun.  Once a surly dog ran out from a farmhouse and tried to reach him. That made Spot somewhat uneasy.  \"I don't want to stop to fight this fellow,\" he thought. \"If I do, I'll be left behind.\"  Luckily Farmer Green cut at the strange dog with his whip and bade him be off.  Spot grinned as he sneaked away, yelping.  At last they entered the village. Main Street was thronged with people. Carriages and wagons of all sorts lined the road on both sides--glistening buggies with red ribbons tied in bows about the whip stocks, old lumber wagons with chairs set behind the driver's seat.  Johnnie Green had never seen such a gathering--not even at the fair.  \"The whole county's here!\" he exclaimed. \"I hope we'll find a good place to stop, where we can see the parade.\"  They did. Farmer Green backed the bays into the last open space in the gutter. And Johnnie Green was greatly relieved.  The crowd made such a roar, with its talking and laughter, that old Spot cowered down under the carryall and almost wished he had stayed at home. The cries of men selling peanuts and popcorn, squawkers and toy balloons, mingled with the shouts of small boys and the squeals of their sisters.  \"Goodness!\" Spot murmured. \"What a racket! It hurts my ears.\"  A moment later he stuck his nose out from beneath the carriage and burst into a mournful howl.  \"Keep still!\" Farmer Green ordered.  Little did he know, then, what made Spot cry like that. But in a minute or two Johnnie Green heard the same thing that Spot's sharp ears had caught first. And Johnnie howled too.  \"Hear the band!\" he shouted. \"Hurrah! The parade's coming!\"     XXI  THE CIRCUS PARADE   The crash and blare of the circus band came nearer and nearer. Johnnie Green craned his neck out of the carryall, as it stood at the side of Main Street, and tried to get a glimpse of the parade.  Old dog Spot did not howl again, but stole out beside the bays and looked up the street too.  Soon a man with a tall, shiny hat on his head rode a proud, prancing horse around a corner. And behind him six more horses with gay plumes on their bridles made a wide turn as they swung into view. On top of the high red wagon that they drew sat the band, all in red suits and playing away like mad.  Spot couldn't help whining. Although the bandsmen were playing the liveliest air they knew, music always made Spot sad. And he was glad when the band wagon had passed on.  Other wagons, blazoned with red and gold, followed.  Old dog Spot's hair began to rise along his back and he sniffed, growling. He had noticed a strange mixture of the queerest odors. He didn't know, for a moment, whether to run away or not.  \"Oh, see the tiger!\" Johnnie Green shouted. \"And the lions! And the monkeys! And the bear!\"  \"_See_ them!\" Spot yelped. \"I say, _smell_ them!\"  He felt better when the animals in their cages had gone creaking past. And he forgot his uneasiness as he watched dozens of horses, ridden by folk whose bespangled clothes glittered in the sunlight.  Then came a funny man in a little, two-wheeled cart, driving a donkey. This was the clown. He bowed and smiled to everybody, right and left, and even threw kisses at some of the girls. His painted face, his bag-like clothes, and his odd little round, pointed hat made Johnnie Green laugh. And to Johnnie's great delight, when the clown saw Spot he whistled.  Old Spot was all for dashing out into the street. But Farmer Green wouldn't let him do that. Spot had to be content with barking at the clown.  Then a man on a brisk little horse came down the street. He had a big voice. And he kept using it all the time, shouting so everybody would be sure to hear, \"Look out for your bosses! The elephants are coming!\"  And they came. The elephants came. When Spot saw their huge forms plodding down Main Street he dived beneath the carryall again and shivered until the last one had passed along.  The bays stirred restlessly as the elephants neared them. And the younger of the pair snorted with fear.  Farmer Green talked to them in a soothing voice and told them there wasn't any danger. But nobody thought of talking to old dog Spot. Every one forgot about him. And he was just as badly frightened as the bays, especially when a terrible tooting and screeching burst forth.  Spot jumped almost out of his skin.  \"Sakes alive!\" he howled. \"What awful voices the elephants have!\"  \"The steam calliope!\" Johnnie Green cried. \"And that's the end of the parade.\"     XXII  THE CIRCUS GROUNDS   The Green family ate their luncheon in the carryall on Main Street, after the circus parade had passed. They didn't forget to give old dog Spot something to eat out of the big basket that they had brought with them from home. Although they hadn't expected him to go to the village with them, there was more than enough food for everybody. Even Johnnie Green's appetite wasn't equal to all the goodies that his mother had provided.  People were already starting for the circus grounds on the outskirts of the village. Johnnie Green noticed them uneasily.  \"We don't want to be late for the show,\" he reminded his father.  \"We'll get there in time,\" Farmer Green assured him.  And they did. Soon they followed the crowd through the village streets until they came in sight of the \"big top,\" the great tent with flags flying above it, and smaller tents all around.  Farmer Green turned the bays into a yard near-by, where he unharnessed and fed them. Then he tied one end of a rope to Spot's collar and fastened the other end to a carriage wheel.  \"There!\" he said. \"Now we're ready.\"  Old dog Spot didn't want to be left behind. He tugged at the rope and whined.  \"Be quiet!\" Johnnie Green's father said to him. \"You followed us to the village. And now you'll have to behave yourself. They wouldn't let you into the show.\"  Then the Green family turned their backs on him.  \"They"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],["title","The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#7)"],["body","edn't think they can keep me here,\" Spot growled. \"I didn't run all the way from the farm to the village to be tied to a wagon wheel.\"  Johnnie Green and his father and mother hadn't been gone a quarter of an hour when Spot succeeded in slipping his collar over his head. Then he dashed out of the yard and ran to the circus grounds as fast as he could go.  Spot mingled with the crowds of people that were pouring into the big tent. He worked his way in and out among the throng, all but tripping many of the pleasure seekers.  Though he looked everywhere, he couldn't find the Green family. They had already passed through the entrance and were enjoying the sights inside the canvas.  At last Spot met a man--a circus man--who was very friendly. It was pleasant to get a kind word from somebody, after so many people had told him to \"get out,\" and had given him a shove.  This kindly person called Spot into a low tent and patted him. He gave Spot a bit of meat and even thought to offer him a drink of water.  \"This is a fine pointer,\" the man remarked to a friend of his who was with him. \"He hasn't any collar; so he must be anybody's dog. And he might as well be mine.\"  Spot wagged his tail. He didn't quite understand what his new acquaintance was saying. But it seemed to be something nice.  And then Spot decided, suddenly, that he had stayed in that tent long enough. For the pleasant man found a piece of rope and tried to tie it about Spot's neck.  \"I've been tied up once to-day; and once is enough,\" Spot growled. Slipping out of the man's grasp, Spot ran out of doors.  Both men followed him. For a few minutes they chased him. One of them tripped over a guy rope and sprawled on the ground. And to escape the other Spot dodged under a canvas wall where it lifted slightly at the bottom.  He found himself in a huge tent where hundreds of people sat all around on tiers of seats. Men and horses were capering about in the center of the place. And somewhere a band was playing.  He was under the big top.     XXIII  SPOT SEES THE SHOW   Old dog Spot was bewildered. When he crawled under the canvas he had not dreamed that he was entering the main tent of the circus. He saw so many strange sights that he didn't know whether to bark or to crawl away and hide somewhere. Yet among all those people he felt lonely. He couldn't see anybody he knew.  All at once the bandsmen began to play louder than ever. They seemed to be trying to burst their horns--or themselves. And men in flowing robes, each one standing in a sort of little two-wheeled cart and driving four horses abreast, came tearing past the place where Spot was standing.  It was a race! And if there was one thing that Spot liked more than another it was a race of any kind. He gave a few delighted barks and ran after the galloping horses.  Spot followed them twice around the big tent. And just as he fell into a jog--for the race was finished--he heard a whistle that gave him a great thrill. He stood still for an instant. Then he dashed toward the nearest seats.  A moment later he was fawning upon Johnnie Green, who sat in the lowest row and seemed as glad to see Spot as Spot was to see him.  Lying between Johnnie's feet, Spot watched the rest of the show.  At last the circus was over. The Green family, with Spot at their heels, went back to the place where they had left the bays and the carryall. And in a few minutes more they were on their way back to Pleasant Valley and home.  That morning everybody on the road had seemed to be in a great hurry to get to the village. And now, late in the afternoon, everybody was in just as great a hurry to get away from it. Farmer Green kept the bays at a spanking trot, only pausing to let them breathe now and then on the hills.  Spot, however, was not in such haste that he didn't stop and give a good trouncing to the dog that had rushed out at him earlier in the day. Spot sent the surly fellow yelping into his master's yard. Then he rushed down the road to overtake the carryall.  But, to everybody's surprise, when they reached home old dog Spot was missing.  \"He'll come back,\" Farmer Green said. \"Probably he's stopped somewhere to chase a rabbit or something. He'll be along after a while.\"  But after the cows were milked old Spot was still absent. And after the family had eaten supper he had failed to appear. Bedtime came. Still no Spot!  Johnnie Green felt very sad when he went upstairs.  He felt even worse when morning came. He had hoped that Spot would be in the yard, begging for his breakfast.  Johnnie Green was able to eat only a little of his own breakfast. And as soon as he left the table he went to the barn and harnessed his pony, Twinkleheels, to the little buggy with the red wheels.  Then Johnnie started for the village.     XXIV  HOME AGAIN   Johnnie Green drove his pony, Twinkleheels, back over the road that led to the village. Now and then he stopped at a farmhouse to inquire whether anybody had seen old dog Spot, who had vanished on the way home from the circus the evening before.  Nobody had set eyes on him. And Johnnie Green drove on and on, feeling more and more miserable all the while.  At last, as he turned a sharp bend of the road, he heard a bark. There was no mistaking it. It was Spot's.  There was a joyful meeting then. Johnnie sprang out of the buggy and Spot sprang into his arms. And Johnnie hugged the old fellow tightly, right there in the middle of the road.  \"What in the world has kept you here ever since yesterday?\" Johnnie asked.  Spot must have understood. Anyhow, he dashed to one side of the road. And, following him, Johnnie found there a robe that belonged to his father. It had dropped out of the carryall the evening before, when the Green family were on their way home from seeing the circus. Nobody in the carriage had missed it. But old Spot, running under the carriage, had seen it fall. And he had stayed behind to guard it all through the long night.  Of course Spot couldn't tell Johnnie Green all this. But Johnnie wasn't slow in guessing what had happened.  He picked up the robe and put it under the seat of the little buggy. Then he and Spot both jumped in. And Johnnie turned Twinkleheels' head toward home.  Back at the farm almost everybody said that old dog Spot was a hero. Farmer Green exclaimed that Spot was a faithful old fellow. And Mrs. Green set out such a meal for him as Spot had never seen before in all his life.  Now, there were two or three of Spot's neighbors in the farmyard that didn't like the praise he was getting. Turkey Proudfoot, the gobbler, remarked that if people didn't know enough to come home to roost at night he saw no reason for making a fuss about it. Miss Kitty Cat declared that so far as she was concerned she would have been just as well pleased if Spot hadn't come back to the farm at all. And Henrietta Hen had more to say than anyone else. She hurried up to old dog Spot himself and insisted on talking with him.  \"Huh!\" she exclaimed. \"You only spent one day at the circus, while last fall I stayed a whole week at the county fair.\"  \"Did you hear a band at the fair?\" Spot asked her.  \"Yes!\"  \"Did you see any races?\"  \"There were races every day; but I didn't care to watch them,\" Henrietta Hen answered.  \"Did you see any elephants at the fair?\" Spot demanded.  \"Elephants?\" said Henrietta Hen. \"What are elephants?\"  Spot pointed--with his nose--to one of the posters on the barn.  \"There's a picture of some elephants,\" he told her. \"And I must say it's a good one.\"  \"There were no elephants at the county fair,\" Henrietta Hen admitted as she gazed at the circus poster on the side of the barn. \"Why, every one of them has two tails!\" she cried. \"I don't see how they know whether they're going backward or forward.\"  \"Maybe they don't know,\" Spot retorted. \"Maybe that's part of the fun in being an elephant. For I suppose there's fun of some sort in being anybody, even a-a-a--\"  \"Even a _what?_\" Henrietta snapped. \"Were you going to say a _Hen?_\"  \"I was,\" Spot replied. \"But I remembered that it wouldn't be polite.\"  \"I should say not!\" Henrietta Hen cackled. \"I should say not!\" And then, being very angry, she hurried off to tell the rooster what had happened.  \"I'll have to be careful how I talk to these farmyard folks,\" Spot muttered. \"They haven't had a chance to learn some of the things that I know.  \"For I've been to the village and seen the world--and the circus, too,\" added old dog Spot.
