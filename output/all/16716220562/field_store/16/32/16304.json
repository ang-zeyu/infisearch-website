But such accidents were only vexations crossing the fancies of the poet: they did not essentially injure the magnificence, the pomp, and the fairy world opened to the spectators. So little was the character of these Masques known, that all our critics seemed to have fallen into repeated blunders, and used the Masques as Campion suspected his painters to have done, \"either by simplicity, negligence, or conspiracy.\" Hurd, a cold systematic critic, thought he might safely prefer the Masque in the _Tempest_, as \"putting to shame all the Masques of Jonson, not only in its _construction_, but in the _splendour_ of its show;\"--\"which,\" adds Gifford, \"was danced and sung by the ordinary performers to a couple of fiddles, perhaps in the balcony of the stage.\" Such is the fate of criticism without knowledge! And now, to close our Masques, let me apply the forcible style of Ben Jonson himself: \"The glory of all these solemnities had perished like a blaze, and gone out in the beholder's eyes; so short-lived are the bodies of all things in comparison of their souls!\"[13]   FOOTNOTES:    [2] Sir Philip Sidney, in his \"Defence of Poesy,\" 1595, alludes to     the custom of writing the supposed locality of each scene over the     stage, and asks, \"What child is there that coming to a play, and     seeing _Thebes_ written in great letters on an old door, doth     believe that it is Thebes.\" As late as the production of Davenant's     _Siege of Rhodes_ (_circa_ 1656), this custom was continued, and is     thus described in the printed edition of the play:--\"In the middle     of the frieze was a compartment wherein was written _Rhodes_.\" In     many instances the spectator was left to infer the locality of the     scene from the dialogue.--\"Now,\" says Sidney, \"you shall have three     ladies walke to gather flowers, and then we must believe the stage     to be a garden. By and by we heare newes of shipwracke in the same     place; then we are to blame if we accept it not for a rock.\" In     Middleton's _Chaste Maid_, 1630, when the scene changes to a     bed-room, \"a bed is thrust out upon the stage, Alwit's wife in it;\"     which simple process was effected by pushing it through the curtains     that hung across the entrance to the stage, which at that time     projected into the pit.    [3] The play of _Pyramus and Thisbe_, performed by the clowns in     Shakspeare's _Midsummer Night's Dream_, is certainly constructed in     burlesque of characters in court Masques, which sometimes were as     difficult to be made comprehensible to an audience as \"the clowns of     Athens\" found _Wall_ and _Moonshine_ to be.    [4] It is due to a great poet like Ben Jonson, that, without     troubling the reader to turn to his works, we should give his own     description of these characters, to show that they were not the     \"perplexed allegories\" they are asserted to be by Granger; nor     inappropriate to the _Masque of Christmas_, for which they were     designed. MINCED-PIE was habited \"like a fine cook's wife, drest     neat, her man carrying a pie, dish, and spoon.\" BABY-CAKE was \"drest     like a boy, in a fine long coat, biggin-bib, muckender (or     handkerchief), and a little dagger; his usher bearing a great cake,     with a bean and a pease;\" the latter being indicative of those     generally inserted in a Christmas cake, which, when cut into slices     and distributed, indicated by the presence of the bean the person     who should be king; the slice with the pea doing the same for the     queen. Neither of these characters speak, but make part of the show     to be described by Father Christmas. Jonson's inventive talent was     never more conspicuous than in the concoction of court Masques.    [5] The first employment of these two great men was upon _The Masque     of Blackness_, performed at Whitehall on Twelfth-Night, 1603; and     which cost nearly 10,000_l._, of our present money.    [6] The music of Whitelocke's _Coranto_ is preserved in Hawkins's     \"History of Music.\" Might it be restored for the ladies as a waltz?    [7] This was _Chloridia_, a Masque performed by the queen and her     ladies at court, on Shrovetide, 1630; upon the title-page of which     is printed \"the inventors--Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones.\" Jonson was, by     reason of the influence of Inigo, deprived of employ at court ever     after, supplanted by other poets named by the architect, and among     them Heywood, Shirley, and Davenant.    [8] George Chapman's _Memorable Maske_, performed at Whitehall,     1630, by the gentlemen of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn, cost     the latter society nearly 2000_l._ for their share of the expenses.    [9] Ben Jonson records the names of the noble ladies and gentlemen     who enacted his inventions at court.    [10] The figures and actions of dancers in Masques were called motions.    [11] Memoirs of Jonson, p. 88.    [12] See Gifford's Jonson, vol. vii. p. 78. This performance was in     the _Masque of Hymen_, enacted at court in 1605, on the occasion of     the marriage of the Earl of Essex to the daughter of the Earl of     Suffolk.    [13] Splendour ultimately ruined these works; they ended in gaudy     dresses and expensive machinery, but poetry was not associated with     them. The youthful days of Louis XIV. raised them to a height of     costly luxuriance to sink them ever after in oblivion.     OF DES MAIZEAUX, AND THE SECRET HISTORY OF ANTHONY COLLINS'S MANUSCRIPTS.   Des Maizeaux was an active literary man of his day, whose connexions with Bayle, St. Evremond, Locke, and Toland, and his name being set off by an F.R.S., have occasioned the dictionary-biographers to place him prominently among their \"hommes illustres.\" Of his private history nothing seems known. Having something important to communicate respecting one of his friends, a far greater character, with whose fate he stands connected, even Des Maizeaux becomes an object of our inquiry.  He was one of those French refugees whom political madness or despair of intolerance had driven to our shores. The proscription of Louis XIV., which supplied us with our skilful workers in silk, also produced a race of the unemployed, who proved not to be as exquisite in the handicraft of book-making; such were _Motteux_, _La Coste_, _Ozell_, _Durand_, and others. Our author had come over in that tender state of youth, just in time to become half an Englishman: and he was so ambidextrous in the languages of the two great literary nations of Europe, that whenever he took up his pen, it is evident by his manuscripts, which I have examined, that it was mere accident which determined him to write in French or in English. Composing without genius, or even taste, without vivacity or force, the simplicity and fluency of his style were sufficient for the purposes of a ready dealer in all the _minutiæ literariæ_; literary anecdotes, curious quotations, notices of obscure books, and all that _supellex_ which must enter into the history of literature, without forming a history. These little things, which did so well of themselves, without any connexion with anything else, became trivial when they assumed the form of voluminous minuteness; and Des Maizeaux at length imagined that nothing but anecdotes were necessary to compose the lives of men of genius! With this sort of talent he produced a copious life of Bayle, in which he told everything he possibly could; and nothing can be more tedious, and more curious: for though it be a grievous fault to omit nothing, and marks the writer to be deficient in the development of character, and that sympathy which throws inspiration over the vivifying page of biography, yet, to admit everything, has this merit--that we are sure to find what we want! Warburton poignantly describes our Des Maizeaux, in one of those letters to Dr. Birch which he wrote in the fervid age of study, and with the impatient vivacity of his genius, \"Almost all the life-writers we have had before Toland and Des Maizeaux are indeed strange, insipid creatures; and yet I had rather read the worst of them, than be obliged to go through with this of Milton's, or the other's life of Boileau; where there is such a dull, heavy succession of long quotations of uninteresting passages, that it makes their method quite nauseous. But the verbose, tasteless Frenchman seems to lay it down as a principle, that every life must be a book,--and, what is worse, it seems a book without a life; for what do we know of Boileau after all his tedious stuff?\"  Des Maizeaux was much in the employ of the Dutch booksellers, then the great monopolisers in the literary mart of Europe. He supplied their \"nouvelles littéraires\" from England; but the work-sheet price was very mean in those days. I have seen annual accounts of Des Maizeaux settled to a line for four or five pounds; and yet he sent the \"Novelties\" as fresh as the post could carry them! He held a confidential correspondence with these great Dutch booksellers, who consulted him in their distresses; and he seems rather to have relieved them than himself. But if he got only a few florins at Rotterdam, the same \"nouvelles littéraires\" sometimes secured him valuable friends at London; for in those days, which perhaps are returning on us, an English author would often appeal to a foreign journal for the commendation he might fail in obtaining at home; and I have discovered, in more cases than one, that, like other smuggled commodities, the foreign article was often of home manufactory!  I give one of these curious bibliopolical distresses. Sauzet, a bookseller at Rotterdam, who judged too critically for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],["title","Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#4)"],["body","of his authors, seems to have been always fond of projecting a new \"Journal;\" tormented by the ideal excellence which he had conceived of such a work, it vexed him that he could never find the workmen! Once disappointed of the assistance he expected from a writer of talents, he was fain to put up with one he was ashamed of; but warily stipulated on very singular terms. He confided this precious literary secret to Des Maizeaux. I translate from his manuscript letter.  \"I send you, my dear Sir, four sheets of the continuation of my journal, and I hope this second part will turn out better than the former. The author thinks himself a very able person; but I must tell you frankly, that he is a man without erudition, and without any critical discrimination; he writes pretty well, and turns passably what he says; but that is all! Monsieur Van Effen having failed in his promises to realise my hopes on this occasion, necessity compelled me to have recourse to him; but for _six months only_, and on condition that he should not, on any account whatever, _allow any one to know that he is the author of the journal_; for his _name_ alone would be sufficient to make even a passable book discreditable. As you are among my friends, I will confide to you in secrecy the name of this author; it is Mons. _De Limiers_.[14] You see how much my interest is concerned that the author should not be known!\" This anecdote is gratuitously presented to the editors of certain reviews, as a serviceable hint to enter into the same engagement with some of their own writers: for it is usually the _De Limiers_ who expend their last puff in blowing their own name about the town.  In England, Des Maizeaux, as a literary man, made himself very useful to other men of letters, and particularly to persons of rank: and he found patronage and a pension,--like his talents, very moderate! A friend to literary men, he lived amongst them, from \"Orator\" Henley, up to Addison, Lord Halifax, and Anthony Collins. I find a curious character of our Des Maizeaux in the handwriting of Edward, Earl of Oxford, to whose father (Pope's Earl of Oxford) and himself the nation owes the Harleian treasures. His lordship is a critic with high Tory principles, and high-church notions. \"This Des Maizeaux is a great man with those who are pleased to be called _Freethinkers_, particularly with Mr. Anthony Collins, collects passages out of books for their writings. His Life of Chillingworth is wrote to please that set of men.\" The secret history I am to unfold relates to Anthony Collins and Des Maizeaux. Some curious book-lovers will be interested in the personal history of an author they are well acquainted with, yet which has hitherto remained unknown. He tells his own story in a sort of epistolary petition he addressed to a noble friend, characteristic of an author, who cannot be deemed unpatronised, yet whose name, after all his painful labours, might be inserted in my \"Calamities of Authors.\"  In this letter he announces his intention of publishing a Dictionary like Bayle; having written the life of Bayle, the next step was to become himself a Bayle; so short is the passage of literary delusion! He had published, as a specimen, the lives of Hales and Chillingworth. He complains that his circumstances have not allowed him to forward that work, nor digest the materials he had collected.     A work of that nature requires a steady application, free from the    cares and avocations incident to all persons obliged to seek for    their maintenance. I have had the misfortune to be in the case of    those persons, and am now reduced to a pension on the Irish    establishment, which, deducting the tax of four shillings in the    pound, and other charges, brings me in about 40_l._ a year of our    English money.[15] This pension was granted to me in 1710, and I owe    it chiefly to the friendship of Mr. Addison, who was then secretary    to the Earl of Wharton, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1711, 12, and    14, I was appointed one of the Commissioners of the Lottery by the    interest of Lord Halifax.     And this is all I ever received from the Government, though I had    some claim to the royal favour; for in 1710, when the enemies to our    constitution were contriving its ruin, I wrote a pamphlet entitled    \"Lethe,\" which was published in Holland, and afterwards translated    into English, and twice printed in London; and being reprinted in    Dublin, proved so offensive to the ministry in Ireland, that it was    burnt by the hands of the hangman. But so it is, that after having    showed on all occasions my zeal for the royal family, and endeavoured    to make myself serviceable to the public by several books published;    after forty years' stay in England, and in an advanced age, I find    myself and family destitute of a sufficient livelihood, and suffering    from complaints in the head and impaired sight by constant    application to my studies.     I am confident, my lord, he adds, that if the queen, to whom I was    made known on occasion of Thuanus's French translation, were    acquainted with my present distress, she would be pleased to afford    me some relief.[16]  Among the confidential literary friends of Des Maizeaux, he had the honour of ranking Anthony Collins, a great lover of literature, and a man of fine genius, and who, in a continued correspondence with our Des Maizeaux, treated him as his friend, and employed him as his agent in his literary concerns. These, in the formation of an extensive library, were in a state of perpetual activity, and Collins was such a true lover of his books, that he drew up the catalogue with his own pen.[17] Anthony Collins wrote several well-known works without prefixing his name; but having pushed too far his curious inquiries on some obscure and polemical points, he incurred the odium of a _freethinker_,--a term which then began to be in vogue, and which the French adopted by translating it, in their way, _a strong thinker_, or _esprit fort_. Whatever tendency to \"liberalise\" the mind from _dogmas_ and _creeds_ prevails in these works, the talents and learning of Collins were of the first class. His morals were immaculate, and his personal character independent; but the _odium theologicum_ of those days contrived every means to stab in the dark, till the taste became hereditary with some. I shall mention a fact of this cruel bigotry, which occurred within my own observation, on one of the most polished men of the age. The late Mr. Cumberland, in the romance entitled his \"Life,\" gave this extraordinary fact, that Dr. Bentley, who so ably replied by his \"Remarks,\" under the name of Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, to Collins's \"Discourse on Free-thinking,\" when, many years after, he discovered him fallen into great distress, conceiving that by having ruined Collins's character as a writer for ever, he had been the occasion of his personal misery, he liberally contributed to his maintenance. In vain I mentioned to that elegant writer, who was not curious about facts, that this person could never have been _Anthony_ Collins, who had always a plentiful fortune; and when it was suggested to him that this \"A. Collins,\" as he printed it, must have been _Arthur_ Collins, the historical compiler, who was often in pecuniary difficulties, still he persisted in sending the lie down to posterity, _totidem verbis_, without alteration in his second edition, observing to a friend of mine, that \"the story, while it told well, might serve as a striking instance of his great relative's generosity; and that _it should stand_, because it could do no harm to any but to _Anthony_ Collins, whom he considered as little short of an atheist.\" So much for this pious fraud! but be it recollected that this Anthony Collins was the confidential friend of Locke, of whom Locke said, on his dying bed, that \"Collins was a man whom he valued in the first rank of those that he left behind him.\" And the last words of Collins on his own death-bed were, that \"he was persuaded he was going to that place which God had designed for them that love him.\" The cause of true religion will never be assisted by using such leaky vessels as _Cumberland's_ wilful calumnies, which in the end must run out, and be found, like the present, mere empty fictions!  An extraordinary circumstance occurred on the death of Anthony Collins. He left behind him a considerable number of his own manuscripts, there was one collection formed into eight octavo volumes; and that they might be secured from the common fate of manuscripts, he bequeathed them all, and confided them to the care of our Des Maizeaux. The choice of Collins reflects honour on the character of Des Maizeaux, yet he proved unworthy of it! He suffered himself to betray his trust, practised on by the earnest desire of the widow, and perhaps by the arts of a Mr. Tomlinson, who appears to have been introduced into the family by the recommendation of Dean Sykes, whom at length he supplanted, and whom the widow, to save her reputation, was afterwards obliged to discard.[18] In an unguarded moment he relinquished this precious _legacy of the manuscripts_, and accepted _fifty guineas as a present_. But if Des Maizeaux lost his honour in this transaction, he was at heart an honest man, who had swerved for a single moment; his conscience was soon awakened, and he experienced the most violent compunctions. It was in a paroxysm of this nature that he addressed the following letter to a mutual friend of the late Anthony Collins and himself.      SIR,                                       _January 6, 1730._     I am very glad to hear you are come to town, and as you are my best    friend, now I have lost Mr. Collins, give me leave to open my heart    to you, and to beg your assistance in an affair which highly concerns    both Mr. Collins's (your friend) and my own honour and reputation.    The case, in few words, stands thus:--Mr. Collins by"]]]
