The few Dutch merchants suffered to reside in Japan were restricted to a small island in Nagasaki harbor, leaving it only once in four years when the Resident, or chief agent, journeyed to Yeddo to offer gifts and most humble obeisance to the Shogun, \"creeping forward on his hands and feet, and falling on his knees, bowed his head to the ground, and retired again in absolute silence, crawling exactly like a crab,\" said one of these pilgrims who added: \"We may not keep Sundays or fast days, or allow our spiritual hymns or prayers to be heard; never mention the name of Christ. Besides these things, we have to submit to other insulting imputations which are always painful to a noble heart. The reason which impels the Dutch to bear all these sufferings so patiently is simply the love of gain.\"  In return for these humiliations the Dutch East India Company was permitted to send one or two ships a year from Batavia to Japan and to export copper, silk, gold, camphor, porcelain, bronze, and rare woods. The American ship Franklin arrived at Batavia in 1799 and Captain James Devereux of Salem learned that a charter was offered for one of these annual voyages. After a deal of Yankee dickering with the hard-headed Dutchmen, a bargain was struck and the Franklin sailed for Nagasaki with cloves, chintz, sugar, tin, black pepper, sapan wood, and elephants' teeth. The instructions were elaborate and punctilious, salutes to be fired right and left, nine guns for the Emperor's guard while passing in, thirteen guns at the anchorage; all books on board to be sealed up in a cask, Bibles in particular, and turned over to the Japanese officials, all firearms sent ashore, ship dressed with colors whenever the \"Commissaries of the Chief\" graciously came aboard, and a carpet on deck for them to sit upon.  Two years later, the Margaret of Salem made the same sort of a voyage, and in both instances the supercargoes, one of whom happened to be a younger brother of Captain Richard Cleveland, wrote journals of the extraordinary episode. For these mariners alone was the curtain lifted which concealed the feudal Japan from the eyes of the civilized world. Alert and curious, these Yankee traders explored the narrow streets of Nagasaki, visited temples, were handsomely entertained by officers and merchants, and exchanged their wares in the marketplace. They were as much at home, no doubt, as when buying piculs of pepper from a rajah of Qualah Battoo, or dining with an elderly mandarin of Cochin China. It was not too much to say that \"the profuse stores of knowledge brought by every ship's crew, together with unheard of curiosities from every savage shore, gave the community of Salem a rare alertness of intellect.\"  It was a Salem bark, the Lydia, that first displayed the American flag to the natives of Guam in 1801. She was chartered by the Spanish government of Manila to carry to the Marianne Islands, as those dots on the chart of the Pacific were then called, the new Governor, his family, his suite, and his luggage. First Mate William Haswell kept a diary in a most conscientious fashion, and here and there one gleans an item with a humor of its own. \"Now having to pass through dangerous straits,\" he observes, \"we went to work to make boarding nettings and to get our arms in the best order, but had we been attacked we should have been taken with ease. Between Panay and Negros all the passengers were in the greatest confusion for fear of being taken and put to death in the dark and not have time to say their prayers.\"  The decks were in confusion most of the time, what with the Governor, his lady, three children, two servant girls and twelve men servants, a friar and his servant, a judge and two servants, not to mention some small hogs, two sheep, an ox, and a goat to feed the passengers who were too dainty for sea provender. The friar was an interesting character. A great pity that the worthy mate of the Lydia should not have been more explicit! It intrigues the reader of his manuscript diary to be told that \"the Friar was praying night and day but it would not bring a fair wind. His behavior was so bad that we were forced to send him to Coventry, or in other words, no one would speak to him.\"  The Spanish governors of Guam had in operation an economic system which compelled the admiration of this thrifty Yankee mate. The natives wore very few clothes, he concluded, because the Governor was the only shopkeeper and he insisted on a profit of at least eight hundred per cent. There was a native militia regiment of a thousand men who were paid ten dollars a year. With this cash they bought Bengal goods, cottons, Chinese pans, pots, knives, and hoes at the Governor's store, so that \"all this money never left the Governor's hands. It was fetched to him by the galleons in passing, and when he was relieved he carried it with him to Manila, often to the amount of eighty or ninety thousand dollars.\" A glimpse of high finance without a flaw!  There is pathos, simple and moving, in the stories of shipwreck and stranding on hostile or desert coasts. These disasters were far more frequent then than now, because navigation was partly guesswork and ships were very small. Among these tragedies was that of the Commerce, bound from Boston to Bombay in 1793. The captain lost his bearings and thought he was off Malabar when the ship piled up on the beach in the night. The nearest port was Muscat and the crew took to the boats in the hope of reaching it. Stormy weather drove them ashore where armed Arabs on camels stripped them of clothes and stores and left them to die among the sand dunes.  On foot they trudged day after day in the direction of Muscat, and how they suffered and what they endured was told by one of the survivors, young Daniel Saunders. Soon they began to drop out and die in their tracks in the manner of \"Benjamin Williams, William Leghorn, and Thomas Barnard whose bodies were exposed naked to the scorching sun and finding their strength and spirits quite exhausted they lay down expecting nothing but death for relief.\" The next to be left behind was Mr. Robert Williams, merchant and part owner, \"and we therefore with reluctance abandoned him to the mercy of God, suffering ourselves all the horrors that fill the mind at the approach of death.\" Near the beach and a forlorn little oasis, they stumbled across Charles Lapham, who had become separated from them. He had been without water for five days \"and after many efforts he got upon his feet and endeavored to walk. Seeing him in so wretched a condition I could not but sympathize enough with him in his torments to go back with him\" toward water two miles away, \"which both my other companions refused to do. Accordingly they walked forward while I went back a considerable distance with Lapham until, his strength failing him, he suddenly fell on the ground, nor was he able to rise again or even speak to me. Finding it vain to stay with him, I covered him with sprays and leaves which I tore from an adjacent tree, it being the last friendly office I could do him.\"  Eight living skeletons left of eighteen strong seamen tottered into Muscat and were cared for by the English consul. Daniel Saunders worked his passage to England, was picked up by a press-gang, escaped, and so returned to Salem. It was the fate of Juba Hill, the black cook from Boston, to be detained among the Arabs as a slave. It is worth noting that a black sea-cook figured in many of these tales of daring and disaster, and among them was the heroic and amazing figure of one Peter Jackson who belonged in the brig Ceres. While running down the river from Calcutta she was thrown on her beam ends and Peter, perhaps dumping garbage over the rail, took a header. Among the things tossed to him as he floated away was a sail-boom on which he was swiftly carried out of sight by the turbid current. All on board concluded that Peter Jackson had been eaten by sharks or crocodiles and it was so reported when they arrived home. An administrator was appointed for his goods and chattels and he was officially deceased in the eyes of the law. A year or so later this unconquerable sea-cook appeared in the streets of Salem, grinning a welcome to former shipmates who fled from him in terror as a ghostly visitation. He had floated twelve hours on his sail-boom, it seemed, fighting off the sharks with his feet; and finally drifting ashore. \"He had hard work to do away with the impressions of being dead,\" runs the old account, \"but succeeded and was allowed the rights and privileges of the living.\"  The community of interests in these voyages of long ago included not only the ship's company but also the townspeople, even the boys and girls, who entrusted their little private speculations or \"adventures\" to the captain. It was a custom which flourished well into the nineteenth century. These memoranda are sprinkled through the account books of the East Indiamen out of Salem and Boston. It might be Miss Harriet Elkins who requested the master of the Messenger \"please to purchase at Calcutta two net beads with draperies; if at Batavia or any spice market, nutmegs or mace; or if at Canton, two Canton shawls of the enclosed colors at $5 per shawl. Enclosed is $10.\"  Again, it might be Mr. John R. Tucker who ventured in the same ship one hundred Spanish dollars to be invested in coffee and sugar, or Captain Nathaniel West who risked in the Astrea fifteen boxes of spermaceti candles and a pipe of Teneriffe wine. It is interesting to discover what was done with Mr. Tucker's hundred Spanish dollars, as invested for him by the skipper of the Messenger at Batavia and duly accounted for. Ten bags of coffee were bought for $83.30,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30998"],["title","A New Bat (Genus Pipistrellus) from Northeastern Mexico (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net        UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS   MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY    Volume 7, No. 10, pp. 583-586  November 15, 1954    A New Bat (Genus Pipistrellus)  from Northeastern M憖ico    BY  ROLLIN H.

Baker   The eastern pipistrelle, _Pipistrellus subflavus_ (Cuvier) in the western part of its range, occurs along the R甐 Grande and its tributaries as far west as northern Coahuila and Val Verde County, Texas. Specimens from those places represent a heretofore undescribed subspecies which may be named and described as follows:  #Pipistrellus subflavus clarus new subspecies#       _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 48270, Univ. Kansas      Mus. Nat. Hist.; 2 mi. W Jim幯ez, el. 850 ft., Coahuila; 19 June      1952; obtained by Rollin H. Baker, original No. 2062.       _Range._--Known from northern Coahuila and adjacent parts of      southwestern Texas.       _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); upper parts pale, near      (_c_) Cinnamon-Buff (capitalized color term after Ridgway, Color      Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912); skull      large; zygomata expanded laterally.       _Comparisons._--Compared with _Pipistrellus subflavus subflavus_      (specimens from Marshall Hall in Maryland, Raleigh in North      Carolina, and Barber County in Kansas) _P. s. clarus_ is paler,      of approximately equal size, and has the zygomata slightly more      expanded laterally. From _Pipistrellus subflavus veracrucis_      (Ward), specimens from 4 km. E Las Vigas, el. 8500 ft., Veracruz,      _P. s. clarus_ differs in being larger, paler, and in having a      larger skull.  _Remarks._--_Pipistrellus subflavus clarus_ is the palest subspecies of the eastern pipistrelle. Of the specimens assigned to _clarus_ (all taken in May and June), only two are sufficiently dark to compare favorably with examples of typical _subflavus_. A specimen (KU 60296) assigned to _P. s. subflavus_ from Rancho Pano Ayuctle, el. 300 ft., 6 mi. N G鏔ez Far燰s, Tamaulipas, is much darker than _clarus_. A specimen recorded from Devils River, Texas, by V. Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 25:211, October 24, 1905) has not been examined by me but presumably is _P. s. clarus_.  _Pipistrellus subflavus clarus_ was taken along the R甐 San Diego and the R甐 Sabinas, both tributaries of the R甐 Grande, where park-like stands of pecan, cypress, willow and other trees bordered these streams. The species was not found at stock ponds or along stream courses in adjacent places where such trees were absent. Funds for financing field work were made available by the Kansas University Endowment Association and the National Science Foundation.       _Measurements._--Measurements of the holotype and average and      extreme measurements of 5 adult females from the type locality,      including the holotype, are, respectively, as follows: Total      length, 85, 88.0 (85-92); length of tail vertebrae, 43, 40.8      (36-45); length of hind foot, 9, 9.4 (8.5-11); height of ear from      notch, 12, 12.6 (12-13); length of forearm, 33.8, 33.4 (32.9-33.8);      length of tibia, 14.8, 14.6 (14.5-14.8); greatest length of      skull, 13.3, 13.1 (12.7-13.3); condylobasal length, 12.6, 12.4      (12.1-12.6); breadth of braincase, 7.0, 6.8 (6.7-7.0); zygomatic      breadth, 8.1, 8.0 (7.8-8.2); mastoid breadth, 7.1, 6.9 (6.5-7.1);      length maxillary tooth-row, 4.5, 4.5 (4.4-4.6).       _Specimens examined._--Those from Texas are in the collection of      the United States National Museum, and those from Coahuila are in      University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.
