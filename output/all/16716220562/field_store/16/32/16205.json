[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],["title","The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#6)"],["body","   I will bring my quotations to a close with the following, which      seeks to prove the contrary. Dr. C. B. GARRETT (\"The Human Voice,\"      J. and J. Churchill, London, 1875, p. 17) says, \"It is recorded      that the larynx of a blackbird was removed by severing the windpipe      just below it; that the poor 'thing continued to _sing_, though in      a feebler tone.' This proves that notes can be formed _behind the      instrument_ and before the air reaches it.\" This argument, however,      is of no value, because it so happens that birds have two larynges,      one at the bottom and the other at the top of the windpipe. Dr.      Garrett seems not to have been aware of this fact.  The vocal ligaments in the adult male are, in a state of rest, about three-quarters of an inch long, and in the female about half an inch. I pointed out before that the vocal ligaments are attached in front to the shield (pl. VII, 6) and behind to the pyramids (pl. VII, 3, 3). Let it now be borne in mind--1st, That the pyramids, in their turn, are fastened to the upper border of the ring cartilage; and 2nd, That by drawing the shield downwards and forwards upon the ring, the distance between the upper border of the ring (pl. VII, 5) and the front of the shield (pl. VII, 6) is increased, and it will be easily seen that this movement must of necessity have the effect of stretching the vocal ligaments.  This drawing of the shield downwards and forwards upon the ring is brought about by a pair of muscles ascending on either side, in the shape of a fan, from the ring to the shield cartilage (pl. VIII, 1, 2). These muscles we name the \"Ring-Shield Muscles.\" In opposition to them there is another pair inside the shield, running parallel with the vocal ligaments (pl. IX, 1, 2, 3). They are attached (like the vocal ligaments) in front to the shield cartilage and behind to the pyramids. These muscles we will call the \"Shield-Pyramid Muscles.\" They counteract the ring-shield muscles, and having overcome their resistance, pull the shield cartilage up again, thereby, of course, relaxing the vocal ligaments. The ring-shield muscles, therefore, _stretch_ the vocal ligaments and the shield-pyramid muscles _relax_ them. The shield-pyramid muscles have an additional function--that of pressing together the vocal ligaments, under certain circumstances, thereby narrowing the opening between them. They have therefore been, in these later days, called the Sphincter[G] muscle of the glottis. They have also been called the Vocal Muscles, since they play so important a part in the formation of all vocal tone that a paralysis of them causes total loss of voice.  [Illustration: PLATE VIII.

All      conclusions, therefore, drawn from experiments upon exsected      larynges, with regard to tone-production in living man are      necessarily quite untrustworthy, and cannot for one moment be      admitted as evidence against observations made upon singers with      the laryngoscope.  These two pairs of muscles, then, namely the ring-shield muscles (pl. VIII, 1, 2) and the shield-pyramid muscles (pl. IX, 1, 2, 3) by stretching, slackening, and compressing the vocal ligaments, mainly govern the pitch of the tones produced by their vibrations. The ring-shield muscles receive some assistance in stretching the vocal ligaments from another quarter, of which we shall speak later on.  We have now had a look at the vocal ligaments, and we have seen by what means they are put on the stretch. As, however, in a state of repose these ligaments diverge behind, they must be brought parallel to each other before they are ready for the production of sound. Let us, therefore, in order to explain how this is done, imagine that we have cut off that part of the pyramids which is standing out above the vocal ligaments (pl. VII), and let us now have a look at these parts from above. You see the ligaments (pl. XA, 1, 2), a section of the pyramids (pl. XA, 3, 4), and uniting these an elastic band (pl. XA, 5). The space between these parts is commonly called the Glottis, but as this appellation belongs more properly to the vocal ligaments, it is manifestly wrong to give the same name to the _space_ which they inclose. This space should be distinguished as the \"_Chink_ of the Glottis\" or the \"Vocal Chink.\"       I have been blamed for making this distinction in the face of      almost universal usage. But I can point to the great anatomist      Professor Luschka as having set the example, and while it is true      that in most physiological works \"Glottis\" is used for the _slit_      between the vocal ligaments, yet the appellations \"Rima glottidis\"      and \"Aperture of the glottis\" are also employed for the same thing.      Medical men, moreover, speak of \"Spasm of the glottis,\" and singing      masters of the \"Shock of the glottis,\" which terms are clearly      quite meaningless when applied to a space.  Dr. Garrett says, on page 12 of the book quoted before, that \"The upper portion of the larynx above the false vocal cords is termed the glottis.\" He might as well say, \"The upper portion of the face above the nose is termed the mouth.\" I really should not notice so astounding a statement were it not made by one signing himself an M.D., and published by so eminent a firm of Medical publishers as Messrs. J. and A. Churchill.  [Illustration: PLATE X.  A. GLOTTIS IN REPOSE.  B. GLOTTIS IN RESPIRATION.  C. GLOTTIS IN THE PRODUCTION OF SOUND.  A. 1, 2. VOCAL LIGAMENTS.  3, 4. SECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS.  5. ELASTIC BAND.  6, 7. LEVERS OF THE PYRAMIDS. ]  On plate XI you see all parts in a state of rest. To the levers of the pyramids (pl. XI, 1, 2) a pair of muscles is attached, the bases of which are fixed upon the back of the ring cartilage below (pl. XI, 3, 6, 3). The action of these \"Back Ring-Pyramid Muscles\" (pl. XI, 4, 1 and 5, 2) is to contract as soon as we take breath, thereby drawing together the pyramids _behind_ and separating them _in front_, at the same time stretching the elastic band behind (pl. X, A, 5). By this movement the chink of the glottis is thrown _wide open_ into the shape depicted on pl. X, B. During expiration these relax, the elastic band contracts, and the vocal chink resumes the shape as on pl. XI. These movements go on from the beginning of our lives to the end, whether we are asleep or awake, with more or less vigour, according as we take a slight or a deep inspiration. The back ring-pyramid muscles (pl. XI, 4, 1 and 5, 2), have consequently the all-important function of keeping open the gate through which the air we breathe enters the lungs. They have, therefore, been poetically called the \"Guardians of the Portal of Life.\" By their action of pulling the pyramids backwards, they also assist the ring-shield muscles (pl. VIII, 1, 2) in stretching the vocal ligaments.         *       *       *       *       *  In opposition to these \"Opening Muscles\" there is another pair rising from the side borders of the ring (pl. XI, 3, 3) which are fastened to the front part of the levers of the pyramids (pl. XI, 1, 2), serving to draw together their front projections to which the vocal ligaments are attached, and which are thereby brought parallel with each other.  [Illustration: PLATE XI.

XI, 3, 1 and 3, 2; see also pl. IX, 5, 4) are assisted by a single muscle uniting the pyramids behind the elastic band which we have already noticed. This muscle we will call the \"Pyramid Muscle\" (pl. XI, 7). By the united action of the muscles which have just been described the vocal chink is thrown in the shape shown on pl. X, C, and the vocal ligaments are now in a proper position for the production of tone.         *       *       *       *       *  Before proceeding any farther it will be well if we once more glance at the muscles with which we have become acquainted, so that we may be quite sure about their functions.

They are very sensitive and movable, and ready on the smallest incitement to meet with great rapidity in order to protect the vocal ligaments from any harm. They must, therefore, be chiefly regarded as safeguards of the vocal apparatus, though it is probable that by breaking the stream of air passing through the chink of the glottis, they also exercise considerable influence upon the _quality_ of the tone emitted. It may be affirmed, however, without the slightest hesitation, that they have absolutely nothing to do with the _production_ of tone. We shall see these glandular ledges again during our observations upon the living subject, and I shall therefore say no more about them at present.  [Illustration: PLATE XII.

XII, 1, 2, 3, 4) is the entrance to two pouches or pockets which extend outwards and upwards. The dimensions of these pockets vary very much in different individuals. As a rule their height does not exceed two-fifths of an inch, so that their terminations do not reach the upper borders of the shield cartilage (pl. XII, 5 and 6). But there are instances in which the pockets are nearly three-quarters of an inch high, and where such is the case they, as a necessary consequence, reach beyond the shield. Sometimes they are so high as nearly to touch the root of the tongue. Their outer walls are chiefly formed of loose fatty cellular tissue, and the pockets are almost entirely surrounded by a large number of small glands.       Now these are the \"Laryngeal sacculi\" which, according to Mr.      Illingworth, produce the falsetto voice by \"acting in the same way      as a hazel-nut can be made to act as a whistle, when the kernel has      been extracted through a small hole in the shell,\" &c. I think,      however, that the reader will, from the description given above,      agree with me that the acoustic properties of the pockets of the      voicebox cannot be very great, and that, at all events, there is a      vast difference between their construction and that of a hazel-nut,      either with or without the kernel. Then there is this additional      difficulty, that even if one could whistle upon the pockets in the      manner suggested, there are two of them, covered, let it be      remembered, with a multitude of glands, continually producing      moisture, and liable to enlarge or to diminish. How, I should like      to know, could two such cavities be so tuned as under any      circumstances to produce exactly the same tones? Would not rather      frightful discords be the inevitable result? And again, what      provision is there in the pockets for the gradations of pitch? But      quite apart from these considerations, this and other similar      theories are completely disproved by the fact that every tone which      the human voice is capable of producing can be produced by      _inspiration as well as by expiration_. The tones sung by      inspiration are, as might be expected, wholly devoid of beauty,      because the vocal apparatus is, as it were, put upside down, and      the position of bellows and resonator reversed. But that does not      alter the question. The fact remains, and clearly proves that the      pockets have no more to do with the falsetto than with the chest      voice, because in inspiration the air strikes the vocal ligaments      _after it has passed_ the pockets, and yet the result is, beauty of      tone apart, exactly the same.  The function of the pockets, in my opinion, is this: They are the means of isolating the vocal ligaments, thus enabling them to vibrate freely and without hindrance. They also allow the sound-waves to expand sideways, thereby materially adding to their resonance. Lastly, they with their many little glands produce and supply the vocal ligaments with that moisture without which, according to the investigations of J. Müller,[H] the production of tone cannot be carried on.  Above the pocket ligaments there is a kind of tube which is formed by the upper part of the pyramids (surmounted by two little bodies called the cartilages of Santorini, pl. XII, 7, 8) behind; the lid or epiglottis (pl. XII, 9) in front, and sideways by two folds of mucous membrane running up from the pyramids to the lid (pl. XII, 14, 10 and 15, 11). These folds are in many cases supported by two small cartilages, which we will call the Wedges (pl. XII, 12, 13). These, according to Madame Emma Seiler, are the chief factors in the formation of the highest register of the female voice. In some physiological works they are treated as of very little consequence, and in others they are not mentioned at all.  These wedges are two thin strips of cartilage running in front of the pyramids (pl. XII, 12 and 13) where they are embedded in a number of glands. Their upper ends terminate in the cartilages of Wrisberg (pl. XII, 14, 15), and their lower ends gradually dwindle away in the direction of the vocal ligaments.       Madame Seiler says that they \"reach to the middle of the vocal      chords, by which they are enveloped.\"[I] She comments in the same      book on the fact that German anatomists have been reluctant to      admit the existence of these cartilages; and she adds on page 61,      \"It was, therefore, a great satisfaction to me to find them      described under the name of the cuneiform cartilages in Wilson's      'Human Anatomy.'\" It must be confessed, however, that Wilson's      description of them is totally different from Madame Seiler's. He      says, \"The cuneiform cartilages are two small cylinders of yellow      fibro-cartilage, about seven lines in length and enlarged at each      extremity. _By the lower end or base_ the cartilage is attached _to      the middle of the external surface_ of the arytenoid (the pyramid),      and by its upper extremity forms a prominence in the border of the      aryteno-epiglottidean fold of membrane\"[J] (_i.e._, the fold      running up to the lid). According to Seiler, therefore, the wedges      reach from the pyramids to the middle of the vocal ligaments, but      according to Wilson their bases are attached to the middle of the      outer surface of the pyramids, so that they cannot even touch the      vocal ligaments. As Madame Seiler assigns very important functions      to these wedges in the formation of the highest register of the      female voice, and as she quotes Wilson in a manner that must lead      the reader to suppose he gave a similar description to hers of      these cartilages, I have thought it right to give Wilson's      statement in full.       But there is a description of these cartilages by Dr. Witkowski      which corresponds very closely with Madame Seiler's. Speaking of      some of the glands of the voicebox, he says in the work mentioned      before, on p. 12--\"They are arranged in the form of an L, whose      vertical branch goes along the arytenoid cartilages (the pyramids),      _the horizontal branch following the direction of the vocal cords_.      _There is often found situated in the midst of this group of glands      the cuneiform cartilage of Wrisberg_, sometimes reduced to a mere      cartilaginous granule.\"       Dr. Elsberg also describes them on p. 37 of the treatise before      mentioned as \"elongated nodules\" in the hinder portion of the vocal      ligaments, and says they are found \"more often in the female than      in the male sex.\" He calls them the \"posterior vocal nodules,\" and      gives on p. 36 a diagram which shows them most clearly and      unmistakably. This point would therefore seem to be settled.  =The Resonator.=--We now come to the last part of our instrument, namely, the resonator, which is formed of (1) the pockets of the larynx; (2) the tube above the pocket ligaments; (3) the upper part of the throat; (4) the mouth; and (5) the nose. Before giving a description of the resonator, it will be necessary to make a few introductory remarks on certain laws of the philosophy of sound, which have been so clearly demonstrated that they admit of no contradiction.  =Tone=, as we have seen, is the result of rapid periodic vibrations.  The =Loudness= of tone depends upon the _amplitude_ of the vibrations. This is easily shown by drawing a bow over the string of a violin: while the vibrations of the string are largest, the tone produced is loudest, and as the vibrations get smaller, so the tone becomes fainter.  The =Pitch= of tone depends upon the _number_ of vibrations in a given period of time. The greater the number of vibrations the higher the pitch, and _vice versâ_.  The =Quality= of tone depends on the _form_ of the vibrations, \"which also determines the occurrence of upper partial tones.\"[K]  Now, to make the sound of any tone-producing element more intense, and to give it some special quality, is the work of the resonator. If we simply fix a fiddle string at either end, and, after giving it a certain amount of tension, draw a bow across it, we shall certainly produce a tone, but a very poor and faint one. Put the same string with the same amount of tension upon a cheap violin, and the tone will be intensified, and its quality changed, though that quality may be of a very unpleasant kind. Repeat the experiment upon an Amati or a Straduarius, and not only will the tone be more powerful still, but it will also have a full, round, and"]]]
