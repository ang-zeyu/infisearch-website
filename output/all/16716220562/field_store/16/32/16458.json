Perhaps       that will be wisest. The unknown is generally taken to be       terrible, not as the proverb would infer, from the inherent       superstition of man, but because it so often _is_ terrible. He       who would tamper with the vast and secret forces that animate the       world may well fall a victim to them. And if the end were       attained, if at last you emerged from the trial ever beautiful       and ever young, defying time and evil, and lifted above the       natural decay of flesh and intellect, who shall say that the       awesome change would prove a happy one? Choose, my son, and may       the Power who rules all things, and who says ‘thus far shalt thou       go, and thus much shalt thou learn,’ direct the choice to your       own happiness and the happiness of the world, which, in the event       of your success, you would one day certainly rule by the pure       force of accumulated experience.— Farewell!”        Thus the letter, which was unsigned and undated, abruptly ended.        “What do you make of that, Uncle Holly,” said Leo, with a sort of       gasp, as he replaced it on the table. “We have been looking for a       mystery, and we certainly seem to have found one.”        “What do I make of it? Why, that your poor dear father was off       his head, of course,” I answered, testily. “I guessed as much       that night, twenty years ago, when he came into my room. You see       he evidently hurried his own end, poor man. It is absolute       balderdash.”        “That’s it, sir!” said Job, solemnly. Job was a most       matter-of-fact specimen of a matter-of-fact class.        “Well, let’s see what the potsherd has to say, at any rate,” said       Leo, taking up the translation in his father’s writing, and       commencing to read:—  “_I, Amenartas, of the Royal House of the Pharaohs of Egypt, wife of Kallikrates (the Beautiful in Strength), a Priest of Isis whom the gods cherish and the demons obey, being about to die, to my little son Tisisthenes (the Mighty Avenger). I fled with thy father from Egypt in the days of Nectanebes,_[1] _causing him through love to break the vows that he had vowed. We fled southward, across the waters, and we wandered for twice twelve moons on the coast of Libya (Africa) that looks towards the rising sun, where by a river is a great rock carven like the head of an Ethiopian. Four days on the water from the mouth of a mighty river were we cast away, and some were drowned and some died of sickness. But us wild men took through wastes and marshes, where the sea fowl hid the sky, bearing us ten days’ journey till we came to a hollow mountain, where a great city had been and fallen, and where there are caves of which no man hath seen the end; and they brought us to the Queen of the people who place pots upon the heads of strangers, who is a magician having a knowledge of all things, and life and loveliness that does not die. And she cast eyes of love upon thy father, Kallikrates, and would have slain me, and taken him to husband, but he loved me and feared her, and would not. Then did she take us, and lead us by terrible ways, by means of dark magic, to where the great pit is, in the mouth of which the old philosopher lay dead, and showed to us the rolling Pillar of Life that dies not, whereof the voice is as the voice of thunder; and she did stand in the flames, and come forth unharmed, and yet more beautiful. Then did she swear to make thy father undying even as she is, if he would but slay me, and give himself to her, for me she could not slay because of the magic of my own people that I have, and that prevailed thus far against her. And he held his hand before his eyes to hide her beauty, and would not. Then in her rage did she smite him by her magic, and he died; but she wept over him, and bore him thence with lamentations: and being afraid, me she sent to the mouth of the great river where the ships come, and I was carried far away on the ships where I gave thee birth, and hither to Athens I came at last after many wanderings. Now I say to thee, my son, Tisisthenes, seek out the woman, and learn the secret of Life, and if thou mayest find a way slay her, because of thy father Kallikrates; and if thou dost fear or fail, this I say to all thy seed who come after thee, till at last a brave man be found among them who shall bathe in the fire and sit in the place of the Pharaohs. I speak of those things, that though they be past belief, yet I have known, and I lie not._”   [1] Nekht-nebf, or Nectanebo II., the last native Pharaoh of Egypt,  fled from Ochus to Ethiopia, B.C. 339.—Editor.        “May the Lord forgive her for that,” groaned Job, who had been       listening to this marvellous composition with his mouth open.        As for myself, I said nothing: my first idea being that my poor       friend, being demented, had composed the whole thing, though it       scarcely seemed likely that such a story could have been invented       by anybody. It was too original. To solve my doubts I took up the       potsherd and began to read the close uncial Greek writing on it;       and very good Greek of the period it is, considering that it came       from the pen of an Egyptian born. Here is an exact transcript of       it:—  ΑΜΕΝΑΡΤΑΣΤΟΥΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΥΓΕΝΟΥΣΤΟΥΑΙΓΥΠΤΙΟΥΗΤΟΥΚΑΛΛΙΚΡΑΤΟΥΣΙΣΙΔΟΣΙΕΡΕΩΣΗΝΟ ΙΜΕΝΘΕΟΙΤΡΕΦΟΥΣΙΤΑΔΕΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑΥΠΟΤΑΣΣΕΤΑΙΗΔΗΤΕΛΕΥΤΩΣΑΤΙΣΙΣΘΕΝΕΙΤΩΠΑΙΔΙΕΠ ΙΣΤΕΛΛΕΙΤΑΔΕΣΥΝΕΦΥΓΟΝΓΑΡΠΟΤΕΕΚΤΗΣΑΙΓΥΠΤΙΑΣΕΠΙΝΕΚΤΑΝΕΒΟΥΜΕΤΑΤΟΥΣΟΥΠΑΤΡΟ ΣΔΙΑΤΟΝΕΡΩΤΑΤΟΝΕΜΟΝΕΠΙΟΡΚΗΣΑΝΤΟΣΦΥΓΟΝΤΕΣΔΕΠΡΟΣΝΟΤΟΝΔΙΑΠΟΝΤΙΟΙΚΑΙΚΔΜΗΝΑ ΣΚΑΤΑΤΑΠΑΡΑΘΑΛΑΣΣΙΑΤΗΣΛΙΒΥΗΣΤΑΠΡΟΣΗΛΙΟΥΑΝΑΤΟΛΑΣΠΛΑΝΗΘΕΝΤΕΣΕΝΘΑΠΕΡΠΕΤΡΑ ΤΙΣΜΕΓΑΛΗΓΛΥΠΤΟΝΟΜΟΙΩΜΑΑΙΘΙΟΠΟΣΚΕΦΑΛΗΣΕΙΤΑΗΜΕΡΑΣΔΑΠΟΣΤΟΜΑΤΟΣΠΟΤΑΜΟΥΜΕΓ ΑΛΟΥΕΚΠΕΣΟΝΤΕΣΟΙΜΕΝΚΑΤΕΠΟΝΤΙΣΘΗΜΕΝΟΙΔΕΝΟΣΩΙΑΠΕΘΑΝΟΜΕΝΤΕΛΟΣΔΕΥΠΑΓΡΙΩΝΑΝ ΘΡΩΠΩΝΕΦΕΡΟΜΕΘΑΔΙΑΕΛΕΩΝΤΕΚΑΙΤΕΝΑΓΕΩΝΕΝΘΑΠΕΡΠΤΗΝΩΝΠΛΗΘΟΣΑΠΟΚΡΥΠΤΕΙΤΟΝΟΥ ΡΑΝΟΝΗΜΕΡΑΣΙΕΩΣΗΛΘΟΜΕΝΕΙΣΚΟΙΛΟΝΤΙΟΡΟΣΕΝΘΑΠΟΤΕΜΕΓΑΛΗΜΕΝΠΟΛΙΣΗΝΑΝΤΡΑΔΕΑΠ ΕΙΡΟΝΑΗΓΑΓΟΝΔΕΩΣΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑΝΤΗΝΤΩΝΞΕΝΟΥΣΧΥΤΡΑΙΣΣΤΕΦΑΝΟΥΝΤΩΝΗΤΙΣΜΑΓΕΙΑΜΕΝΕ ΧΡΗΤΟΕΠΙΣΤΗΜΗΔΕΠΑΝΤΩΝΚΑΙΔΗΚΑΙΚΑΛΛΟΣΚΑΙΡΩΜΗΝΑΓΗΡΩΣΗΝΗΔΕΚΑΛΛΙΚΡΑΤΟΥΣΤΟΥΣ ΟΥΠΑΤΡΟΣΕΡΑΣΘΕΙΣΑΤΟΜΕΝΠΡΩΤΟΝΣΥΝΟΙΚΕΙΝΕΒΟΥΛΕΤΟΕΜΕΔΕΑΝΕΛΕΙΝΕΠΕΙΤΑΩΣΟΥΚΑΝ ΕΠΕΙΘΕΝΕΜΕΓΑΡΥΠΕΡΕΦΙΛΕΙΚΑΙΤΗΝΞΕΝΗΝΕΦΟΒΕΙΤΟΑΠΗΓΑΓΕΝΗΜΑΣΥΠΟΜΑΓΕΙΑΣΚΑΘΟΔΟ ΥΣΣΦΑΛΕΡΑΣΕΝΘΑΤΟΒΑΡΑΘΡΟΝΤΟΜΕΓΑΟΥΚΑΤΑΣΤΟΜΑΕΚΕΙΤΟΟΓΕΡΩΝΟΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΟΣΤΕΘΝΕΩΣ ΑΦΙΚΟΜΕΝΟΙΣΔΕΔΕΙΞΕΦΩΣΤΟΥΒΙΟΥΕΥΘΥΟΙΟΝΚΙΟΝΑΕΛΙΣΣΟΜΕΝΟΝΦΩΝΗΝΙΕΝΤΑΚΑΘΑΠΕΡΒ ΡΟΝΤΗΣΕΙΤΑΔΙΑΠΥΡΟΣΒΕΒΗΚΥΙΑΑΒΛΑΒΗΣΚΑΙΕΤΙΚΑΛΛΙΩΝΑΥΤΗΕΑΥΤΗΣΕΞΕΦΑΝΗΕΚΔΕΤΟΥ ΤΩΝΩΜΟΣΕΚΑΙΤΟΝΣΟΝΠΑΤΕΡΑΑΘΑΝΑΤΟΝΑΠΟΔΕΙΞΕΙΝΕΙΣΥΝΟΙΚΕΙΝΟΙΒΟΥΛΟΙΤΟΕΜΕΔΕΑΝΕ ΛΕΙΝΟΥΓΑΡΟΥΝΑΥΤΗΑΝΕΛΕΙΝΙΣΧΥΕΝΥΠΟΤΩΝΗΜΕΔΑΠΩΝΗΝΚΑΙΑΥΤΗΕΧΩΜΑΓΕΙΑΣΟΔΟΥΔΕΝΤ ΙΜΑΛΛΟΝΗΘΕΛΕΤΩΧΕΙΡΕΤΩΝΟΜΜΑΤΩΝΠΡΟΙΣΧΩΝΙΝΑΔΗΤΟΤΗΣΓΥΝΑΙΚΟΣΚΑΛΛΟΣΜΗΟΡΩΗΕΠΕ ΙΤΑΟΡΓΙΣΘΕΙΣΑΚΑΤΕΓΟΗΤΕΥΣΕΜΕΝΑΥΤΟΝΑΠΟΛΟΜΕΝΟΝΜΕΝΤΟΙΚΛΑΟΥΣΑΚΑΙΟΔΥΡΟΜΕΝΗΕΚ ΕΙΘΕΝΑΠΗΝΕΓΚΕΝΕΜΕΔΕΦΟΒΩΙΑΦΗΚΕΝΕΙΣΣΤΟΜΑΤΟΥΜΕΓΑΛΟΥΠΟΤΑΜΟΥΤΟΥΝΑΥΣΙΠΟΡΟΥΠΟ ΡΡΩΔΕΝΑΥΣΙΝΕΦΩΝΠΕΡΠΛΕΟΥΣΑΕΤΕΚΟΝΣΕΑΠΟΠΛΕΥΣΑΣΑΜΟΛΙΣΠΟΤΕΔΕΥΡΟΑΘΗΝΑΖΕΚΑΤΗΓ ΑΓΟΜΗΝΣΥΔΕΩΤΙΣΙΣΘΕΝΕΣΩΝΕΠΙΣΤΕΛΛΩΜΗΟΛΙΓΩΡΕΙΔΕΙΓΑΡΤΗΝΓΥΝΑΙΚΑΑΝΑΖΗΤΕΙΝΗΝΠ ΩΣΤΟΤΟΥΒΙΟΥΜΥΣΤΗΡΙΟΝΑΝΕΥΡΗΣΚΑΙΑΝΑΙΡΕΙΝΗΝΠΟΥΠΑΡΑΣΧΗΔΙΑΤΟΝΣΟΝΠΑΤΕΡΑΚΑΛΛΙ ΚΡΑΤΗΝΕΙΔΕΦΟΒΟΥΜΕΝΟΣΗΔΙΑΑΛΛΟΤΙΑΥΤΟΣΛΕΙΠΕΙΤΟΥΕΡΓΟΥΠΑΣΙΤΟΙΣΥΣΤΕΡΟΝΑΥΤΟΤΟ ΥΤΟΕΠΙΣΤΕΛΛΩΕΩΣΠΟΤΕΑΓΑΘΟΣΤΙΣΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΟΣΤΩΠΥΡΙΛΟΥΣΑΣΘΑΙΤΟΛΜΗΣΕΙΚΑΙΤΑΑΡΙΣΤ ΕΙΑΕΧΩΝΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣΑΙΤΩΝΑΝΘΡΩΠΩΝΑΠΙΣΤΑΜΕΝΔΗΤΑΤΟΙΑΥΤΑΛΕΓΩΟΜΩΣΔΕΑΑΥΤΗΕΓΝΩΚΑΟ ΥΚΕΨΕΥΣΑΜΗΝ  For general convenience in reading, I have here accurately transcribed this inscription into the cursive character.

The English translation was, as I discovered on further       investigation, and as the reader may easily see by comparison,       both accurate and elegant.  Besides "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3155"],["title","She (#7)"],["body","uncial writing on the convex side of the sherd at the top, painted in dull red, on what had once been the lip of the amphora, was the cartouche already mentioned as being on the _scarabæus_, which we had also found in the casket. The hieroglyphics or symbols, however, were reversed, just as though they had been pressed on wax. Whether this was the cartouche of the original Kallikrates,[2] or of some Prince or Pharaoh from whom his wife Amenartas was descended, I am not sure, nor can I tell if it was drawn upon the sherd at the same time that the uncial Greek was inscribed, or copied on more recently from the Scarab by some other member of the family. Nor was this all. At the foot of the writing, painted in the same dull red, was the faint outline of a somewhat rude drawing of the head and shoulders of a Sphinx wearing two feathers, symbols of majesty, which, though common enough upon the effigies of sacred bulls and gods, I have never before met with on a Sphinx.   [2] The cartouche, if it be a true cartouche, cannot have been that of  Kallikrates, as Mr. Holly suggests. Kallikrates was a priest and not  entitled to a cartouche, which was the prerogative of Egyptian  royalty, though he might have inscribed his name or title upon an  _oval_.—Editor.        Also on the right-hand side of this surface of the sherd, painted       obliquely in red on the space not covered by the uncial       characters, and signed in blue paint, was the following quaint       inscription:—        IN EARTH AND SKIE AND SEA       STRANGE THYNGES THER BE.       HOC FECIT       DOROTHEA VINCEY.        Perfectly bewildered, I turned the relic over. It was covered       from top to bottom with notes and signatures in Greek, Latin, and       English. The first in uncial Greek was by Tisisthenes, the son to       whom the writing was addressed. It was, “I could not go.       Tisisthenes to his son, Kallikrates.” Here it is in fac-simile       with its cursive equivalent:—  ΟΥΚΑΝΔΥΝΑΙΜΗΝΠΟΡΕΥΕϹΘΑΙΤΙϹΙϹΘΕΝΗϹΚΑΛΛΙΚΡΑΤΕΙΤΩΙΠΑΙΔΙ οὐκ ἂν δυναίμην πορεύεσθαι. Τισισθένης Καλλικράτει τῷ παιδί.        This Kallikrates (probably, in the Greek fashion, so named after       his grandfather) evidently made some attempt to start on the       quest, for his entry written in very faint and almost illegible       uncial is, “I ceased from my going, the gods being against me.       Kallikrates to his son.” Here it is also:—  ΤΩΝΘΕΩΝΑΝΤΙΣΤΑΝΤΩΝΕΠΑΥΣΑΜΗΝΤΗΣΠΟΡΕΙΑΣΑΛΛΙΚΡΑΤΗΣΤΩΙΠΑΙΔΙ τῶν θεῶν ἀντιστάντων ἐπαυσάμην τῆς πορείας. Καλλικράτης τῷ παιδί.        Between these two ancient writings, the second of which was       inscribed upside down and was so faint and worn that, had it not       been for the transcript of it executed by Vincey, I should       scarcely have been able to read it, since, owing to its having       been written on that portion of the tile which had, in the course       of ages, undergone the most handling, it was nearly rubbed       out—was the bold, modern-looking signature of one Lionel Vincey,       “Ætate sua 17,” which was written thereon, I think, by Leo’s       grandfather. To the right of this were the initials “J. B. V.,”       and below came a variety of Greek signatures, in uncial and       cursive character, and what appeared to be some carelessly       executed repetitions of the sentence τῷ παιδί (to my son),       showing that the relic was religiously passed on from generation       to generation.        The next legible thing after the Greek signatures was the word       “Romae, A.U.C.,” showing that the family had now migrated to       Rome. Unfortunately, however, with the exception of its       termination (evi) the date of their settlement there is for ever       lost, for just where it had been placed a piece of the potsherd       is broken away.        Then followed twelve Latin signatures, jotted about here and       there, wherever there was a space upon the tile suitable to their       inscription. These signatures, with three exceptions only, ended       with the name “Vindex” or “the Avenger,” which seems to have been       adopted by the family after its migration to Rome as a kind of       equivalent to the Greek “Tisisthenes,” which also means an       avenger. Ultimately, as might be expected, this Latin cognomen of       Vindex was transformed first into De Vincey, and then into the       plain, modern Vincey. It is very curious to observe how the idea       of revenge, inspired by an Egyptian who lived before the time of       Christ, is thus, as it were, embalmed in an English family name.        A few of the Roman names inscribed upon the sherd I have actually       since found mentioned in history and other records. They were, if       I remember right,  MVSSIVS. VINDEX SEX. VARIVS MARVLLVS C. FVFIDIVS. C. F. VINDEX  and  LABERIA POMPEIANA. CONIVX. MACRINI. VINDICIS  this last being, of course, the name of a Roman lady.        The following list, however, comprises all the Latin names upon       the sherd:—       C. CAECILIVS VINDEX      M. AIMILIVS VINDEX      SEX. VARIVS. MARVLLVS      Q. SOSIVS PRISCVS SENECIO VINDEX      L. VALERIVS COMINIVS VINDEX      SEX. OTACILIVS. M. F.      L. ATTIVS. VINDEX      MVSSIVS VINDEX      C. FVFIDIVS. C. F. VINDEX      LICINIVS FAVSTVS      LABERIA POMPEIANA CONIVX MACRINI VINDICIS      MANILIA LVCILLA CONIVX MARVLLI VINDICIS        After the Roman names there is evidently a gap of very many       centuries. Nobody will ever know now what was the history of the       relic during those dark ages, or how it came to have been       preserved in the family. My poor friend Vincey had, it will be       remembered, told me that his Roman ancestors finally settled in       Lombardy, and when Charlemagne invaded it, returned with him       across the Alps, and made their home in Brittany, whence they       crossed to England in the reign of Edward the Confessor. How he       knew this I am not aware, for there is no reference to Lombardy       or Charlemagne upon the tile, though, as will presently be seen,       there is a reference to Brittany. To continue: the next entries       on the sherd, if I may except a long splash either of blood or       red colouring matter of some sort, consist of two crosses drawn       in red pigment, and probably representing Crusaders’ swords, and       a rather neat monogram (“D. V.”) in scarlet and blue, perhaps       executed by that same Dorothea Vincey who wrote, or rather       painted, the doggrel couplet. To the left of this, inscribed in       faint blue, were the initials A. V., and after them a date, 1800.        Then came what was perhaps as curious an entry as anything upon       this extraordinary relic of the past. It is executed in black       letter, written over the crosses or Crusaders’ swords, and dated       fourteen hundred and forty-five. As the best plan will be to       allow it to speak for itself, I here give the black-letter       fac-simile, together with the original Latin without the       contractions, from which it will be seen that the writer was a       fair mediæval Latinist. Also we discovered what is still more       curious, an English version of the black-letter Latin. This, also       written in black letter, we found inscribed on a second parchment       that was in the coffer, apparently somewhat older in date than       that on which was inscribed the mediæval Latin translation of the       uncial Greek of which I shall speak presently. This I also give       in full.  _Fac-simile of Black-Letter Inscription on the Sherd of Amenartas._        “Iſta reliq̅ia eſt valde miſticu̅ et myrificu̅ op̅s q̅d maiores       mei ex Armorica ſſ Brittania mi̅ore ſecu̅ co̅veheba̅t et q̅dm       ſc̅s cleric̅s ſe̅per p̅ri meo in manu ferebat q̅d pe̅itus illvd       deſtrueret, affirma̅s q̅d eſſet ab ipſo ſathana co̅flatu̅       preſtigioſa et dyabolica arte q̅re p̅ter mevs co̅fregit illvd i̅       dvas p̅tes q̅s q̅dm ego Johs̅ de Vi̅ceto ſalvas ſervavi et       adaptavi ſicut ap̅paret die lu̅e p̅r̅ poſt feſt beate Mrie vir{g}       anni gr̅e mccccxlv.”  _Expanded Version of the above Black-Letter Inscription._        “Ista reliquia est valde misticum et myrificum opus, quod majores       mei ex Armorica, scilicet Britannia Minore, secum convehebant; et       et quidam sanctus clericus semper patri meo in manu ferebat quod       penitus illud destrueret, affirmans quod esset ab ipso Sathana       conflatum prestigiosa et dyabolica arte, quare pater meus       confregit illud in duas partes, quas quidem ego Johannes de       Vinceto salvas servavi et adaptavi sicut apparet die lune proximo       post festum beate Marie Virginis anni gratie MCCCCXLV.”        _Fac-simile of the Old English Black-Letter Translation of the       above Latin Inscription from the Sherd of Amenartas found       inscribed upon a parchment._        “Thys rellike ys a ryghte mistycall worke & a marvaylous yᵉ       whyche myne aunceteres afore tyme dyd conveigh hider wᵗ yᵐ ffrom       Armoryke whᵉ ys to ſeien Britaine yᵉ leſſe & a certayne holye       clerke ſhoulde allweyes beare my ffadir on honde yᵗ he owghte       uttirly ffor to ffruſſhe yᵉ ſame affyrmynge yᵗ yt was ffourmyd &       confflatyd off ſathanas hym ſelffe by arte magike & dyvellyſſhe       wherefore my ffadir dyd take yᵉ ſame & to braſt yt yn tweyne but       I John de Vincey dyd ſave whool yᵉ tweye p̄tes therof & topeecyd       yᵐ togydder agayne ſoe as yee ſe on y{s} daye mondaye next       ffolowynge after yᵉ ffeeste of ſeynte Marye yᵉ bleſſed vyrgyne yn       yᵉ yeere of ſalvacioun ffowertene hundreth & ffyve & ffowrti.”        _Modernised Version of the above Black-Letter Translation._        “Thys rellike ys a ryghte mistycall worke and a marvaylous, ye       whyche myne aunceteres aforetyme dyd conveigh hider with them       from Armoryke which ys to seien Britaine ye Lesse and a certayne       holye clerke should allweyes beare my fadir on honde that he"]]]
