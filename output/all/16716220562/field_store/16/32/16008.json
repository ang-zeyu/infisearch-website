Thy assured friend,       GEO. W. BAKER.   LETTER XII--FROM JOHN HOWLAND, JR., ESQ.      NEW BEFORD, 9th month, 10th day, 1835.  FRIEND,--As I have lived nearly three years upon a vegetable diet, I cheerfully comply with thy request.  1. My bodily strength has been increased; and I can now endure much more exercise than formerly, without fatigue.  2. They are more agreeable; and I am now free from that dull, heavy feeling, which I used to experience after my meals.  3. My mind is much clearer; and I am free from that depression of spirits, to which I was formerly subject.  4. I was of a costive, dyspeptic habit, which has been entirely removed. I had frequent and severe attacks of headache, which I now rarely have; and when they do occur they are very light, compared with what they formerly were.  5. I have had fewer colds, and those much lighter than formerly.  6. About three years.  7. I used to eat animal food for breakfast and dinner, with coffee for drink, at those meals; and tea for my third meal, with bread and butter.  8. Milk for breakfast, and cold water for the other two meals.  9. I have found it more so; inasmuch as the use of it, with the substitution of bread, made from _coarse, unbolted wheat flour_, instead of superfine, has removed my costiveness entirely.  10. I do.  11. I consider potatoes and rice as the most healthy, and confine myself principally to the former.  I would remark that during the season of fruits, I eat freely of them, with milk; and consider them to be healthy.      JOHN HOWLAND, JR.   LETTER XIII.--FROM DR. W. H. WEBSTER.      BATAVIA, N. Y., Oct. 21, 1835.  SIR,--Some months since, I read your inquiries on diet in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal; and subsequently in the Journal of Medical Sciences, Philadelphia.  I will answer your questions, numerically, from my knowledge of a case somewhat in point, and with which I am but too familiar, as it is my own. But, first, let me premise a few points in the history of my health, as a kind of key to my answers.  It is about fifteen years since I was called a _dyspeptic_; this was while engaged in my academical studies. Not being instructed by my medical friend to make any alteration in diet and regimen, I merely swallowed his cathartics for one month, and his anodynes for the next month, as the bowels were constipated or relaxed. In short, I left college more dead than alive--a confirmed dyspeptic.  In 1826, I commenced the practice of physic. From this time, to the winter of 1831-2, I found it necessary gradually to diminish my indulgence in the luxuries of the table--especially in animal food, and distilled and fermented liquors. On one of the most inclement nights of the winter of 1831-2, a fire broke out in our village, at which I became very wet by perspiration, and the ill-directed efforts of some to extinguish it. This was followed by a severe inflammatory attack upon the digestive organs generally, and especially upon the renal region, which confined me to the house for more than eight months; and, for the greatest share of that time, with the most excruciating torture. On getting out again, I found myself in a wretched condition indeed--reduced to a skeleton--a voracious appetite, which could not be indulged, and which had scarcely deserted me through the whole eight months. I could not regain my flesh or strength but by almost imperceptible degrees; indeed, loaf-sugar and crackers were almost the only food I could use with impunity for the first year.  It is now nearly four years since I have eaten animal food, unless it be here and there a little, as an experiment, with the sole exception of oysters, in which I can indulge, but with all due deference to the stricter rules of temperance. Still my appetite for animal food seems unabated. I have ever been a man unusually temperate in the use of intoxicating drinks; and by no means intemperate in the luxuries of the table. I take no meat, no alcoholic or fermented drinks, not even cider; and, for a year past, my health has been better than for three years previous; and I think that about one third the amount of nourishment usually taken by men of my age, might subserve the purposes of food for _me_ better than a larger quantity. The more I eat, the more I desire to eat; and abstinence is my best medicine.  But I have already surpassed my limits, and here are my answers.  1. My strength is invariably diminished by animal food, and in almost direct proportion to the quantity, with the exception named above.  2. Pain has been the uniform attendant upon the digestion of an animal diet, with feverish restlessness and constipation.  3. Decidedly more fit for energetic action.  4. An irritation, or subacute inflammation of the digestive apparatus, which is aggravated by animal food.  5. Can endure hardship, exposure, and fatigue, much better without meat.  6. About four years, with the exception stated above.  7. It was not.  8. Partially at the commencement; but not of late, if not taken hot.  9. Much more aperient.  10. Both classes take too much; and students and sedentaries should take little or none.  11. For myself farinaceous articles first, then the succulent sub-acid ripe fruits, then the less oily nuts are most healthful--and animal food, strong coffee and tea, and unripe or hard fruits, in any considerable quantities, are most pernicious.      Yours, etc.,       W. H. WEBSTER.   LETTER XIV.--FROM JOSIAH BENNET, ESQ.      MOUNT-JOY, Pa., Oct. 27, 1835.  SIR,--I hereby transmit to you, answers to a series of dietetic queries which you have recently submitted.  1. My physical strength was at least equal (I am rather inclined to think greater) after abstaining from animal food. I was, I am certain, not subject to such general debility and lassitude of the system, after considerable bodily exercise.  2. More agreeable--not being subject to a sense of vertigo, which frequently (with me) followed the use of animal food. There is, generally, more cheerfulness and vivacity.  3. The mind is more clear, and is not so liable to be confused when intent upon any intricate subject; and, of course, \"can continue a laborious investigation longer.\" There is at no time such a propensity to incogitancy.  4. I am not aware of being the subject of any \"constitutional infirmities;\" yet, that the change of diet had a very great effect upon the system, is obvious, from the fact of my having been, formerly, subject to an eruptive disease of the skin, principally on the shoulders and upper part of the back, for a number of years, which is not the case at present, nor do I think will be, as long as I continue my present mode of living.  5. I think I have not had as many colds and febrile attacks as before, nor have they been so severe; yet I cannot be very decisive on this point, on account of the length of time in the trial not being fully sufficient.  6. Between seven and eight months. I must here state that animal food was not _entirely_ excluded. I probably partook, in very moderate quantities, once or twice a week.  7. The quantity of animal food which would be considered \"an uncommon proportion,\" I am unable to determine; but I was accustomed to make use of it, not _less_ than twice, and sometimes three times a day, moderately seasoned. No other stimulants, of any account.  8. Cold water has been the only substitute for tea and coffee, with the exception of an occasional cup; probably as often as once or twice a week. I was, on several occasions, by personal experience, induced to believe that the use of strong coffee retarded the process of digestion.  9. More aperient. Previous to the general exclusion of animal food from my diet, I was subject to inveterate costiveness; cases of which are now neither frequent nor severe.  10. I do firmly believe it would.  11. My diet, principally, during the trial, consisted of wheat bread, of the proper age, with a moderate quantity of fresh butter. Potatoes, beans, and some other esculent roots, etc., I found to be nutritious and healthy. The following substances I found to produce a contrary effect, or to possess different qualities: cabbage, when not well boiled; cucumbers, raw or pickled; radishes, beets, and the whole catalogue of preserves. Fresh bread was particularly hurtful to me.      Yours, etc.,       JOSIAH BENNETT.   LETTER XV.--FROM WILLIAM VINCENT, ESQ.[2]      HOPKINTON, R. I., Dec. 23, 1835.  SIR,--The following answer to the interrogations in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal of March 1835, on diet, etc., as proposed by yourself, has been through the press of business, neglected until this late period. Trusting they may be of some use, I now forward them.  1. Rather increased, if any change.  2. ----  3. I think I have retained the vigor of my mind more, in consequence of an abstemious diet.  4. I thought I had the appearance of scurvy, which gradually disappeared.  5. ----  6. From May 20, 1811, (more than twenty-four years.)  7. Small in quantity, and dressed and cooked simply.  8. I have drank nothing but warm tea, for seven years.  9. Bowels"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30478"],["title","Vegetable Diet: As Sanctioned (#7)"],["body","open.  10. I should not think it would.  11. I have lived principally on bread, butter, and cheese, and a few dried vegetables.  I was born March 31, 1764. In 1833, when mowing, to quench thirst, I drank about a gill of cold water, _after_ about as much milk and water; and the same year, some molasses and water; but they did not answer the purpose. But when I rinsed my mouth with cold water, it allayed my thirst.      (Signed)       WM. VINCENT.   LETTER XVI.--FROM L. R. BRADLEY, BY DR. GEO. H. PERRY.      HOPKINTON, R. I., Dec. 23, 1835.  SIR,--I deem it necessary, first, to mention the situation of my health, at the time of commencing abstinence from animal food. I was recovering from an illness of a _nervous fever_. A sudden change respecting my food not sitting well, rendered it necessary for me to abstain from all kinds, excepting dry wheat bread and gruel, for several weeks. By degrees I returned to my former course of diet, but as yet not to its full extent, as I cannot partake of animal food of any kind whatever, nor of vegetables cooked therewith.  1. Diminished.  2. ----  3. I do not perceive the mind to be clearer, and the power of investigation less.  4. Distress in the stomach and pain in the head removed.  5. ----  6. Six years and ten months.  7. Unusual proportion of animal food.  8. The first year, I drank only warm water, sweetened; since that, tea.  9. ----  10. I do not.  11. I find _beets_ particularly hard to digest.      L. R. B.  The foregoing statements and answers are in her own way and manner.      Yours, etc.,       GEO. H. PERRY.   LETTER XVII.--FROM DR. L. W. SHERMAN.      FALMOUTH, Mass., March 28, 1835.  SIR,--In compliance with the request you recently made in the Medical Journal, I inclose the following answers to the queries relative to regimen you have propounded. They are given by a lady, whose experience, intelligence, and discernment, have eminently qualified her to answer them. She, with myself, is equally interested with you in having this important question settled, and is extremely happy that you have undertaken to do it. This lady is now fifty years of age; her constitution naturally is good; her early habits were active, and her diet simple, until twenty years of age. After that, until within a few years, her living consisted of all kinds of meats and delicacies, with wine after dinners, etc., etc.  1. Her bodily strength was greatly increased by excluding animal food from her diet.  2. The animal sensations connected with the process of digestion have been decidedly more agreeable.  3. The mind is much clearer, the spirits much better, the temper more even, and \"less irritability pervades the system.\" The mind can continue a laborious investigation longer than when she subsisted on a mixed diet.  4. Her health, which was before feeble, has, by the change, been decidedly improved.  5. She has certainly had fewer colds, and no febrile attacks of any consequence, since she has practiced rigid abstinence from meats.  6. She has abstained entirely for three years, and has taken but little for seven or eight years; and whenever she has, from necessity (in being from home, where she could procure nothing else), indulged in eating meat, she has universally suffered severely in consequence.  7. The change to a vegetable diet was preceded, in her case, by the use of an uncommon proportion of animal food, highly seasoned with stimulants.  8. Tea and coffee she has not used for thirteen years. She has used, for substitutes, water, milk and water, barley water, and gruel. She found tea and coffee to have an exceedingly pernicious effect upon her nervous and digestive system.  9. A vegetable diet is more aperient than a mixed. Habitual constipation has been entirely removed by the change.  10. She sincerely believes, from her experience, that the health of laborers and students would be generally promoted by the exclusion of animal food from their diet.  11. She considers _hominy_, as prepared at the South, particularly healthy; and subsists upon this, with bread made from coarse flour, with broccoli, cauliflower, and all kinds of vegetables in their season.  Be assured, dear sir, that these answers have come from a high source, to which private reference may at any time be made, and consequently are entitled to the highest consideration.      Yours, etc.,         L. W. SHERMAN.  NOTE.--If I have not been minute enough in the relation of this case, I shall hereafter be happy to answer any questions you may think proper to propose. It is a very interesting and important case, in my opinion. The lady has been under my care a number of times, while laboring under slight indisposition. She has always been very regular and systematic in all her habits. She is healthy and robust in appearance, and looks as though she might not be more than forty. This is the only case of the kind within my knowledge. I have practiced on her plan for a few weeks at a time, and, so far as my experience goes, it precisely comports with hers. But I love the \"good things\" of this world too well to abstain from their use, until some formidable disease demands their prohibition.      Yours, etc.,         L. W. S.  FOOTNOTES:  [1] Dr. Preston has since deceased.  [2] Mr. Vincent is of Stonington, Ct.     CHAPTER III.  REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING LETTERS.       Correspondence.--The \"prescribed course of Regimen.\"--How many      victims to it?--Not one.--Case of Dr. Harden considered.--Case      of Dr. Preston.--Views of Drs. Clark, Cheyne, and Lambe, on the      treatment of Scrofula.--No reports of Injury from the      prescribed System.--Case of Dr. Bannister.--Singular testimony      of Dr. Wright.--Vegetable food for Laborers.--Testimony, on the      whole, much more favorable to the Vegetable System than could      reasonably have been expected, in the circumstances.   \"Reports not unfrequently reach us,\" says Dr. North, \"of certain individuals who have fallen victims to a prescribed course of regimen. These persons are said, by gentlemen who are entitled to the fullest confidence, to have pertinaciously followed the course, till they reached a point of reduction from which there was no recovery.\" \"If these are facts,\" he adds, \"they ought to be known and published.\"  It was in this view, that Dr. North, himself a medical practitioner of high respectability, sent forth to every corner of the land, through standard and orthodox medical journals, to regular and experienced physicians--his \"medical brethren\"--his list of inquiries. These inquiries, designed to elicit truth, were couched in just such language as was calculated to give free scope and an acceptable channel for the communication of every fact which seemed to be opposed to the VEGETABLE SYSTEM; for this, we believe, was distinctly understood, by every medical man, to be the \"prescribed course of regimen\" alluded to.  The results of Dr. North's inquiries, and of an opportunity so favorable for \"putting down,\" by the exhibition of sober facts, the vegetable system, are fully presented in the foregoing chapter. Let it not be said by any, that the attempt was a partial or unfair one. Let it be remembered that every effort was made to obtain _truth in facts_, without partiality, favor, or affection. Let it be remembered, too, that nearly two years elapsed before Dr. North gave up his papers to the author; during which time, and indeed up to the present hour--a period, in the whole, of more than fourteen years--a door has been opened to every individual who had any thing to say, bearing upon the subject.  Let us now review the contents of the foregoing chapter. Let us see, in the first place, what number of persons have here been reported, by medical men, as having fallen victims to the said \"prescribed course of regimen.\"  The matter is soon disposed of. Not a case of the description is found in the whole catalogue of returns to Dr. N. This is a triumph which the friends of the vegetable system did not expect. From the medical profession of this country, hostile as many of them are known to be to the \"prescribed course of regimen,\" they must naturally have expected to hear of at least a few persons who were supposed to have fallen victims to it. But, I say again, not one appears.  It is true that Dr. Preston, of Plymouth, Mass., thinks he should have fallen a victim to his abstinence from flesh meat, had he not altered his course; and Dr. Harden, of Georgia, relates a case of sudden loss of strength, and great debility, which he thought, _at the time_, might \"possibly\" be ascribed to the want of animal food: though the individual himself attributed it to quite another cause. These are the only two, of a list of thirty or forty, which were detailed, that bear the slightest resemblance to those which report had brought to the ear of Dr. N., and about which he so anxiously and earnestly solicited inquiry of his medical brethren.  As to the case mentioned by Dr. Harden, no one who examined it with care, will believe for a moment, that it affords the slightest evidence against a diet exclusively vegetable. The gentleman who made the experiment had pursued it faithfully three years, without the slightest loss of strength, but with many advantages, when, of a sudden, extreme debility came on. Is it likely that a diet on which he had so long been doing well, should produce such a sudden falling off? The gentleman himself appears not to have had the slightest suspicion that the debility had any connection with the diet. He attributes its commencement, if not its continuance, to the inhalation of poisonous gases, to which he was subjected in the process of some chemical experiments.  But why, then, it may be asked, did he return to a mixed diet, if he had imbibed no doubts in regard to a diet exclusively vegetable; and, above all, how happened he to recover on it? To this it may be replied, that there is every reason to believe, from the tenor of the letter,"]]]
