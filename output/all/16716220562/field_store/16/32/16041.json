On the other hand, moderate and regular labor favors a healthy development and consolidation of the bones.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  129-148. _Give the hygiene of the bones._ 129. What effect has exercise upon the bones? What effect has inaction? Why are the joints of the industrious farmer and mechanic larger than those of a person unaccustomed to manual employment? 130. Give the first reason why the bones of the child are not adapted to severe exercise. The second reason.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  131. _The kind and amount of labor should be adapted to the age, health, and development of the bones._ Neither the flexible bones of the child nor the brittle bones of the aged man are adapted, by their organization, to long-continued, and hard labor. Those of the one bend too easily, while those of the other fracture too readily. In middle age, the proportions of animal and earthy matter are, usually, such as to give the proper degree of flexibility, firmness, and strength for labor, with little liability to injury.  132. _The imperfectly developed bones of the young child will not bear long-continued exertions or positions without injury._ Hence the requisitions of the rigid disciplinarian of schools, are unwise when he compels his pupils to remain in one position for a long time. He may have a \"quiet school;\" but, not unfrequently, by such discipline, the constitution is impaired, and permanent injury is done to the pupils.  133. _The lower extremities, in early life, contain but a small proportion of earthy matter_; they bend when the weight of the body is thrown upon them for a long time. Hence, the assiduous attempts to induce children to stand or walk, either naturally or artificially, when very young, are ill advised, and often productive of serious and permanent evil. The \"bandy\" or bow legs are thus produced.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  What effect has moderate, regular labor upon the growing youth? 131. What remark respecting the kind and amount of labor? At what age are the bones best fitted for labor? 132. What effect has long-continued exertions or positions on the bones of a child? What is said of the requisitions of some teachers, who have the famed \"quiet schools\"? 133. Why should not the child be induced to stand or walk, either naturally or artificially, at too early an age?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  134. _The benches or chairs for children in a school-room should be of such a height as to permit the feet to rest on the floor._ If the bench is so high as not to permit the feet to rest upon the floor, the weight of the limbs below the knee may cause the flexible bone of the thigh to become curved. The child thus seated, is inclined to lean forward, contracting an injurious and ungraceful habit. Again, when the feet are not supported, the child soon becomes exhausted, restless, and unfit for study. In the construction of a school-room, the benches should be of different heights, so as to be adapted to the different pupils, and they should also have appropriate backs.  [Illustration: Fig. 29. The position assumed when the seat is of proper height, and the feet supported.]  [Illustration: Fig. 30. The position a child naturally assumes when the seat is so high that the feet are not supported.]    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  134. What is said of the benches or chairs in a school-room? What is represented by fig. 29? By fig. 30? What is the effect when the lower limbs are not supported?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  135. _Compression of the chest should be avoided._ In children, and also in adults, the ribs are very flexible, and a small amount of pressure will increase their curvature, particularly at the lower part of the chest, and thus lessen the size of this cavity. The lower ribs are united to the breast-bone, by long, yielding cartilages, and compression may not only contract the chest, but an unseemly and painful ridge may be produced, by the bending of the cartilages, on one or both sides of the sternum.  [Illustration: Fig. 31. A natural and well-proportioned chest.]  [Illustration: Fig. 32. A chest fashionably deformed.]    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  135. Why should compression of the chest be avoided? What is represented by fig. 31? By fig. 32?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  136. Again, the cartilages on one side may be bent outward, while those on the opposite side are bent inward, thus forming a depression parallel with the sternum. In some instances, the anterior extremity of the lower ribs on each side are brought nearly or quite together. In these instances, the movable extremities of the ribs are drawn down toward the haunch-bones, while the space between the ribs is lessened. All this may be effected by tight or \"snug\" clothing. Therefore the apparel of a child should be loose, and supported over the shoulders, to avoid the before-mentioned evils. The same may be said of the clothing for adults.  137. _The erect position in sitting and standing should be assiduously observed._ The spinal column, in its natural position, curves from front to back, but not from side to side The admirable arrangement of the bones, alternating with cartilages, permits a great variety of motions and positions; and when the spine is inclined to either side, the elasticity of its cartilages tends to restore it to its natural position. For this reason we may incline the spinal column in any direction for a short time, without danger of permanent curvature, if, afterward, the erect position is assumed.[4]     [4] Compare 1, 1, Fig. 28, with 2, 2, 2, Fig. 48.  138. But if a stooping position, or a lateral curved posture, is continued for a long time, the spinal column does not easily recover its proper position, for the compressed edges of the cartilages lose their power of reaction, and finally one side of the cartilage becomes thinned, while the other is thickened; and these wedge-shaped cartilages produce a permanent curvature of the spinal column. In a similar way, the student, seamstress, artisan, and mechanic acquire a stooping position, and become round shouldered, by inclining forward to bring their books or work nearer the eyes.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  136. May simply \"snug\" clothing compress the cartilages? How should the apparel of a child be worn? 137. In what direction does the spinal column, in its natural position, curve? What restores it to its natural position when curved laterally? 138. What is the effect if a lateral curved position of the spinal column is continued for a long time? 139. When one shoulder is elevated for a long time, what is the effect upon the spinal column?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  139. Pupils, while writing, drawing, and sometimes while studying, frequently incline the spinal column to one side, in order to accommodate themselves to the desks at which they are seated. Often, these are higher than the elbow as it hangs from the shoulder while at rest. This attitude elevates one shoulder while it depresses the other; consequently, the upper part of the spinal column is inclined toward the elevated shoulder, and the lower part is curved in the opposite direction, giving the form of the letter _S_ to the supporting column of the body.  [Illustration: Fig. 33. The table is of proper height, the position is correct, and the spinal column, 1, 1, is straight, while the shoulders are of equal height.]    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  What does fig. 33 represent?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  _Experiment._ Let a pupil be placed at a desk or table with one elbow raised, as is frequently seen while writing, or at study, and observe the condition of the shoulder and spinal column in this position. Place another pupil at a table no higher than the elbow when it hangs by the side while sitting, and observe the appearance of the shoulders and spinal column. By a comparison of the two attitudes, the preceding remarks will be comprehended and appreciated.  [Illustration: Fig. 34. The table is too high, and the position is oblique and improper. The right shoulder is seen higher than the left, while the spinal column, 1, 1, exhibits three curves.]  140. One shoulder may be elevated, and no injurious results follow, provided care is taken not to keep it in the raised position too long, or if the opposite shoulder is elevated for the same period of time. The right shoulder projects more frequently than the left. This arises from the greater use of the right hand with the shoulder elevated, and not unfrequently the oblique positions assumed in performing the daily vocations of life. With proper care, and by calling into action the left shoulder, this deformity can be prevented.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  What experiment is mentioned? What does fig. 34 represent? 140. How can one shoulder be elevated and no injurious results follow?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  [Illustration: Fig. 35. A representation of a deformed trunk.]  141. The loss of symmetry and diminution of height from deformed spines are minor considerations, compared with the distortions that the chest experiences, thereby impairing respiration and inducing diseases of the heart and lungs. The invasion of the functions of these two important organs lessens the vitality of the whole system, and causes general ill health. Again, the curvature of the spinal column is frequently attended by irritation and disease of the spinal cord.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Why does the right shoulder project more frequently than the left? How can this deformity be prevented? 141. What is said of deformed spinal columns?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  142. Eminent physicians, both in this country and France state that not more than one female in ten, who has been fashionably educated, is free from deformities of the shoulder or spinal column.

He was but of five and twenty winters, a fair-faced man, yellow-haired, tall and strong; rather wiser than foolisher than young men are mostly wont; a valiant youth, and a kind; not of many words but courteous of speech; no roisterer, nought masterful, but peaceable and knowing how to forbear: in a fray a perilous foe, and a trusty war-fellow.   His father, with whom he was dwelling when this tale begins, was a great merchant, richer than a baron of the land, a head-man of the greatest of the Lineages of Langton, and a captain of the Porte; he was of the Lineage of the Goldings, therefore was he called Bartholomew Golden, and his son Golden Walter.  Now ye may well deem that such a youngling as this was looked upon by all as a lucky man without a lack; but there was this flaw in his lot, whereas he had fallen into the toils of love of a woman exceeding fair, and had taken her to wife, she nought unwilling as it seemed.   But when they had been wedded some six months he found by manifest tokens, that his fairness was not so much to her but that she must seek to the foulness of one worser than he in all ways; wherefore his rest departed from him, whereas he hated her for her untruth and her hatred of him; yet would the sound of her voice, as she came and went in the house, make his heart beat; and the sight of her stirred desire within him, so that he longed for her to be sweet and kind with him, and deemed that, might it be so, he should forget all the evil gone by.   But it was not so; for ever when she saw him, her face changed, and her hatred of him became manifest, and howsoever she were sweet with others, with him she was hard and sour.  So this went on a while till the chambers of his father's house, yea the very streets of the city, became loathsome to him; and yet he called to mind that the world was wide and he but a young man.   So on a day as he sat with his father alone, he spake to him and said: \"Father, I was on the quays even now, and I looked on the ships that were nigh boun, and thy sign I saw on a tall ship that seemed to me nighest boun.   Will it be long ere she sail?\"  \"Nay,\" said his father, \"that ship, which hight the Katherine, will they warp out of the haven in two days' time.   But why askest thou of her?\"  \"The shortest word is best, father,\" said Walter, \"and this it is, that I would depart in the said ship and see other lands.\"  \"Yea and whither, son?\" said the merchant.  \"Whither she goeth,\" said Walter, \"for I am ill at ease at home, as thou wottest, father.\"  The merchant held his peace awhile, and looked hard on his son, for there was strong love between them; but at last he said: \"Well, son, maybe it were best for thee; but maybe also we shall not meet again.\"  \"Yet if we do meet, father, then shalt thou see a new man in me.\"  \"Well,\" said Bartholomew, \"at least I know on whom to lay the loss of thee, and when thou art gone, for thou shalt have thine own way herein, she shall no longer abide in my house.   Nay, but it were for the strife that should arise thenceforth betwixt her kindred and ours, it should go somewhat worse with her than that.\"  Said Walter: \"I pray thee shame her not more than needs must be, lest, so doing, thou shame both me and thyself also.\"  Bartholomew held his peace again for a while; then he said: \"Goeth she with child, my son?\"  Walter reddened, and said: \"I wot not; nor of whom the child may be.\" Then they both sat silent, till Bartholomew spake, saying: \"The end of it is, son, that this is Monday, and that thou shalt go aboard in the small hours of Wednesday; and meanwhile I shall look to it that thou go not away empty-handed; the skipper of the Katherine is a good man and true, and knows the seas well; and my servant Robert the Low, who is clerk of the lading, is trustworthy and wise, and as myself in all matters that look towards chaffer.   The Katherine is new and stout-builded, and should be lucky, whereas she is under the ward of her who is the saint called upon in the church where thou wert christened, and myself before thee; and thy mother, and my father and mother all lie under the chancel thereof, as thou wottest.\"  Therewith the elder rose up and went his ways about his business, and there was no more said betwixt him and his son on this matter.     CHAPTER II: GOLDEN WALTER TAKES SHIP TO SAIL THE SEAS   When Walter went down to the Katherine next morning, there was the skipper Geoffrey, who did him reverence, and made him all cheer, and showed him his room aboard ship, and the plenteous goods which his father had sent down to the quays already, such haste as he had made.  Walter thanked his father's love in his heart, but otherwise took little heed to his affairs, but wore away the time about the haven, gazing listlessly on the ships that were making them ready outward, or unlading, and the mariners and aliens coming and going: and all these were to him as the curious images woven on a tapestry.  At last when he had wellnigh come back again to the Katherine, he saw there a tall ship, which he had scarce noted before, a ship all-boun, which had her boats out, and men sitting to the oars thereof ready to tow her outwards when the hawser should be cast off, and by seeming her mariners were but abiding for some one or other to come aboard.  So Walter stood idly watching the said ship, and as he looked, lo! folk passing him toward the gangway.  These were three; first came a dwarf, dark-brown of hue and hideous, with long arms and ears exceeding great and dog-teeth that stuck out like the fangs of a wild beast.  He was clad in a rich coat of yellow silk, and bare in his hand a crooked bow, and was girt with a broad sax.  After him came a maiden, young by seeming, of scarce twenty summers; fair of face as a flower; grey-eyed, brown-haired, with lips full and red, slim and gentle of body.  Simple was her array, of a short and strait green gown, so that on her right ankle was clear to see an iron ring.  Last of the three was a lady, tall and stately, so radiant of visage and glorious of raiment, that it were hard to say what like she was; for scarce might the eye gaze steady upon her exceeding beauty; yet must every son of Adam who found himself anigh her, lift up his eyes again after he had dropped them, and look again on her, and yet again and yet again.  Even so did Walter, and as the three passed by him, it seemed to him as if all the other folk there about had vanished and were nought; nor had he any vision before his eyes of any looking on them, save himself alone.  They went over the gangway into the ship, and he saw them go along the deck till they came to the house on the poop, and entered it and were gone from his sight.  There he stood staring, till little by little the thronging people of the quays came into his eye-shot again; then he saw how the hawser was cast off and the boats fell to tugging the big ship toward the harbour-mouth with hale and how of men.  Then the sail fell down from the yard and was sheeted home and filled with the fair wind as the ship's bows ran up on the first green wave outside the haven.  Even therewith the shipmen cast abroad a banner, whereon was done in a green field a grim wolf ramping up against a maiden, and so went the ship upon her way.  Walter stood awhile staring at her empty place where the waves ran into the haven-mouth, and then turned aside and toward the Katherine; and at first he was minded to go ask shipmaster Geoffrey of what he knew concerning the said ship and her alien wayfarers; but then it came into his mind, that all this was but an imagination or dream of the day, and that he were best to leave it untold to any.  So therewith he went his way from the water-side, and through the streets unto his father's house; but when he was but a little way thence, and the door was before him, him- seemed for a moment of time that he beheld those three coming out down the steps of stone and into the street; to wit the dwarf, the maiden, and the stately lady: but when he stood still to abide their coming, and looked toward them, lo! there was nothing before him save the goodly house of Bartholomew Golden, and three children and a cur dog playing about the steps thereof, and about him were four or five passers-by going about their business.  Then was he all confused in his mind, and knew not what to make of it, whether those whom he had seemed to see pass aboard ship were but images of a dream, or children of Adam in very flesh.  Howsoever, he entered the house, and found his father in the chamber, and fell to speech with him about their matters; but for all that he loved his father, and worshipped him as a wise and valiant man, yet at that hour he might not hearken the words of his mouth, so much was his mind entangled in the thought of those three, and they were ever before his eyes, as if they had been painted on a table by the best of limners.  And of the two women he thought exceeding much, and cast no wyte upon himself for running after the desire of strange women.  For he said to himself that he desired not either of the twain; nay, he might not tell which of the twain, the maiden or the stately queen, were clearest to his eyes; but sore he desired to see both of them again, and to know what they were.  So wore the hours till the Wednesday morning, and it was time that he should bid farewell to his father and get aboard ship; but his father led him down to the quays and on to the Katherine, and there Walter embraced him, not without tears and forebodings; for his heart was full."]]]
