They were gathered in the far corner, just outside one of the many huts erected there--a sorry affair, which at one time had done duty on the race-course as a tool-shed.  In those days it would not have been considered good enough even for the dogs of the owners of German race-horses; but now, yes, it was good enough--too good--for these enemy prisoners, for these individuals snatched from amongst the civil population of Germany.  Young men, some of them, hale men in those days before the war; elderly men, invalids from some of Germany's health resorts--harmless individuals in numerous cases, who, had they been Germans and in England, would have been left alone, able to live their lives in peace and security, provided they obeyed certain rules and regulations of a not too drastic nature; but in Germany German \"frightfulness\" allowed of no leniency even to sick men.  And here they were, the hale, the young, the sick, and the old, hustled to Ruhleben, and herded there together in such an old shed as the one in this far corner.  Many men brought up in luxury in France or in England, needing care and comfort because of the state of their health, and undoubtedly quite harmless individuals, were forced to find such accommodation during those dreary months of later 1914 and the months which followed as this World War went on.  It happened, too, that amongst the people interned at this place were a number of jockeys and racing people, employed up to the date of the war by German masters, and detained in the country.  These--perhaps a dozen of them--had been posted to the very hut round which the German guards were then standing, and, as Henri and Jules came upon the scene, could be observed within the ring of guards, cowering, looking askance at the Germans, and evidently in sore trouble.  \"One of our jockey friends then is the culprit,\" said Jules; \"it's one of the racing-men who has been goaded to madness.\"  \"And has been shot by a German guard?\" asked Henri.  \"Not a bit of it, not a bit of it!\" exclaimed Stuart; \"there has been no shooting here.  Just listen to the questions being asked.  I know German sufficiently to be able to tell what's passing, and those German guards are asking how the work commenced, who thought of the idea, and who was the ring-leader?  If that isn't connected with an attempt at escape, call me a Dutchman.  No, no; don't call me a German,\" he said _sotto voce_ in Henri's ear, grimacing as he did so; \"don't call me that, my boy, or you will be in trouble.\"  Certainly the German guards were asking many questions; they were firing them off by the hundred almost, they were shouting them at their prisoners and at one another, till there was such a babel that no one could answer and few could understand.  It was not, indeed, until a non-commissioned officer of burly form and bullying appearance came upon the scene that the commotion ended, and some sort of order was introduced.  \"Stop this brawling,\" he bellowed, thrusting his way in amongst the guards and pushing them unceremoniously to either side.  \"What's this racket?  Who fired the shot?  Quick, answer!\"  A somewhat startled-looking individual, a man with grey beard and rotund body, who before the onset of the war may have anticipated well enough that he would never again be called to the colours, advanced somewhat timidly from behind his comrades and drew himself up stiffly at attention.  Yet not stiffly enough, not with that snap which is characteristic of the younger German.  The non-commissioned officer coughed and snorted, and looked the man over with a threatening eye which set the fellow trembling.  \"Ha!  Ho!  It is you, eh?  You fired the shot--you?\" and there was a note of contempt in his voice.  \"Then why?  On whose orders?  Here are the orders of the day as to the duties of a sentry, and as to the occasions on which he shall use a rifle.  Listen, I will read them.\"  It was a sample of German militarism which the Sergeant was reproducing to the full, a sample of the preciseness of the Teuton.  Keeping this elderly guard at attention till the poor fellow looked as though he would explode, he groped in the pocket in the tail of his tunic, and, producing a notebook, proceeded to extricate from it a sheet of paper on which were some typewritten lines; and then in a ponderous and somewhat menacing voice he read the orders--orders which set forth exactly and minutely when a guard should come on duty and when he should be relieved, what reports he should prepare, and what he was to observe amongst the prisoners.  Finally, having elaborated a number of minor points, it set forth the orders as to using firearms.  \"And shall not fire upon the prisoners unless there be occasion,\" coughed the Sergeant; \"that is to say, unless there is insubordination amongst them, mutiny, a threat to strike, or an endeavour to escape. That is the gist of the orders.  Now, my friend, you have either obeyed or you have disobeyed your orders.  Your report!  You fired a shot. Why?  Under what heading?\"  No wonder the unfortunate and rotund guard who had set the camp in an uproar flushed till he became quite scarlet, till his face swelled to the point of bursting, and until his eyes looked as though they would fall out of his astonished head.  He stuttered and coughed, and stood at ease, for the effort to remain at attention was beyond him.  \"Halt!  Stand to attention!\" thundered the non-commissioned officer. \"Now, your report.  There was incipient mutiny amongst the prisoners, eh?\"  The guard shook his head and spluttered; even now he was unable to command so much as a single word.  \"No!  Then there was insubordination amongst a number, or in the case of a single individual, eh?\"  \"Not so,\" the guard managed to stutter; \"not so, Sergeant.\"  \"Ah!  Then we get nearer to it.  A man struck you, or threatened to do so?\"  \"No, it was not that,\" the German standing to attention managed to answer; \"not that, Sergeant.\"  \"What, then?  Then it was someone attempting an escape?  Someone trying to break out of Ruhleben!\" shouted the Sergeant--bellowed it, in fact--when he saw that the guard was nodding his head emphatically. \"You mean to tell me that you have stood there all these minutes, and allowed me to read the orders of the day, and to cross-examine you, without giving so much as a hint as to the real cause of the firing of your rifle?  You mean to say that you have allowed all this delay, well knowing that a prisoner is attempting or had made an escape, and thereby have assisted him to make clean away from this prison?\"  It was the non-commissioned officer's turn almost to explode with indignation and anger; he towered above the trembling guard as he thundered at him, and might still have been abusing him and threatening him had it not been that at that moment another individual came upon the scene--a short, spare, dried-up fellow, a lieutenant, one risen from the ranks not long ago, and still retaining all the bullying ways of a non-commissioned officer.  If the burly sergeant had jostled the guards unceremoniously to either side, had stamped on their feet, had threatened and browbeaten them, the new-comer was tenfold more violent and domineering.  If looks could have slaughtered individuals, the glance he cast at the sergeant would have slain that perspiring and angry person in an instant, while the scathing glances cast at the group of guards would have decimated the whole party.  Yet, if this under-officer's looks were terrible, if he were still more threatening than the non-commissioned officer, he was at least practical, and quick to get to the bottom of matters.  \"Stop this racket!\" he commanded abruptly, snapping the words like pistol-shots at those round him.  \"There was an alarm; it started with a rifle-shot--I know all that, so you needn't report it.  Stop!\" he commanded, seeing the non-commissioned officer open his mouth as if to describe what had happened.  \"A rifle-shot gave the alarm--something caused one of the guards to fire.  This man here undoubtedly is the man who did so.  Sergeant, you have called for his report?  You have been here a good five minutes--what's the report?\"  \"A prisoner escaping.  This fool here has kept the knowledge from me until this very moment, and I have only just managed to drag the information from him.  I have----\"  \"Hold!\" snapped the officer.  \"I am not asking what you did; I am asking what caused the sentry to fire.  A prisoner escaping, you tell me--he's gone then; you've ascertained that fact?\"  \"I--I--he--you----\"  The non-commissioned officer was utterly taken aback, and it was his turn now to look askance at this dried-up, sinister-looking under-officer.  If the unfortunate and aged guard who had fired that shot had been remiss in making a rapid report--remissness excusable enough considering the violence of the Sergeant--the latter had been more remiss in not pursuing the matter more rapidly.  He knew it, and knew that the under-officer already condemned him.  Moreover, with that under-officer, he was well aware, excuses would not avail him.  \"I was going to----\"  \"That will do,\" the officer told him.  \"Whatever you were going to do was not your duty.  You have been delaying a report; I will deal with you later in the Commandant's office.  Now, my friend,\" he began, turning upon the trembling guard, \"a prisoner was escaping; I will ask the question that should have been asked at the very commencement: you fired a shot--you killed the man, eh?--so that he did not escape, or you stopped him?\"  There was the dawn of a smile actually on the face of the rotund guard who had been so odiously browbeaten by the Sergeant.  It was his turn, he felt, his turn to be jubilant, and at the expense of the man who had bullied him so abominably.  He was, in fact, helping to turn the tables on the Sergeant, and hastened to assist the officer.  \"I was about to report the matter, sir,\" he said.  \"A prisoner was escaping,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30791"],["title","With Joffre at Verdun: A Story of the Western Front (#4)"],["body"," failed.  I did not shoot him, because it was not possible, seeing that he was out of sight and underground.  I therefore fired my rifle to give an alarm and to call assistance.  Meanwhile I stood guard over the opening, which I discovered by mere accident.  In the hut, there, sir, there is a hole beneath the boards laid on the floor, and a tunnel leading from it.  It is not my duty to enter the huts, and, in fact, the orders of sentries are emphatic on that point; we are to patrol outside though, and not to venture farther unless there is a commotion.  But it is the duty of the non-commissioned officer in whose charge a hut may be to see that the prisoners keep the place tidy, to watch them carefully, and to observe if they show signs of an attempted escape.\"  \"Hah!\"  The fierce little dried-up under-officer actually smiled--smiled at this stout sentry, smiled at him, and, indeed, almost winked.  For, in an instant, he had realized what was happening, how by this last statement the guard was implicating the Sergeant, who had been so recently upbraiding him.  To speak the truth, he was no lover of the non-commissioned officer either; and in days gone by--not so very long ago either--when he, too, had been of the non-commissioned officers' ranks, and had enjoyed but little seniority over the Sergeant, he had had occasion to complain of his bullying, of his arrogance, and of his unpleasant gibes and innuendoes.  It was an opportunity then to be snatched at, both for the sake of himself and of this somewhat ancient sentry, who, whatever he might be, however stupid, was essentially harmless.  \"So,\" he began, \"that is as you say, my friend; it is not your duty to enter any of the enclosures, but to march to and fro and to keep an eye on the prisoners.  It is for the sergeant in charge of each of the huts to carry out his duties, and to detect any and every effort to escape. Then who is the sergeant in charge of this place outside which we are standing?\"  There was silence amongst the group, a deathly silence, during which the aged Landsturm sentry pulled himself up stiffly at attention, or into the nearest approach to that position to which he could attain, and smiled covertly in the direction of the sergeant who had browbeaten him.  Others of those somewhat senile guards, who at the sound of their officer's voice had assumed that position of respect demanded of all German soldiers, also cast swift glances in the same direction, and even went so far--seeing that the snappy little officer's back was turned and his attention otherwise engaged--as to grin quite openly, and smirk, as they watched the flaming face of the Sergeant.  As for the latter, perspiration was pouring from beneath his helmet, the man's hands were twitching, while his eyes were rolling in the most horrible manner.  He was cornered, he knew, and guessed thoroughly that the opportunity thus discovered, thanks to the sentry and to his own bullying manner, would be taken advantage of.  \"Who, then, is the sergeant responsible?\" asked the officer in cold, unsympathetic tones, looking the unfortunate sergeant over from the spike of his _Pickelhaube_ to the thick soles of his regulation boots. \"Surely not this sergeant?  Surely not the non-commissioned officer before me--the one so quick to find fault with a sentry who seems to have been doing only his duty?  Surely not!\"  And yet a glance at his face showed well enough that he knew that the culprit stood before him; moreover, that he was determined to make the most of the opportunity.  \"I--we--this fool here----\" began the Sergeant, spluttering, confused, and now just as thoroughly frightened as had been the victim he had pounced upon such a little time before.  \"Stop!\" snapped the officer; \"you are under arrest; go back to your quarters.  Now, my man, you fired your rifle to stop a man from escaping.  Narrate the circumstances, and quickly, for, for all I know, the rascal may be even now continuing the attempt.\"  At that the sentry smiled--smiled boldly too, when he saw the discomfiture of the Sergeant.  Turning half-right abruptly, till he faced the entrance of the hut, he pointed towards it, and shook his grizzly head  knowingly.  \"It was like this, sir,\" he said, with an air of triumph, \"I was passing to and fro on my beat, noting nothing out of the ordinary, until there came a moment when I was opposite this hut, almost on the precise spot on which I am now standing, when I heard sounds which attracted my notice--heavy sounds, the noise of men digging.  There was no sergeant in sight, no one responsible for the hut to whom I could appeal, yet a glance within showed me an opening in the floor, covered as a rule by boards, which were now removed.  There was a man in the hole, deep down and beyond it, in a tunnel, a man whose figure I could only just discern--a ruffian who was attempting to dig his way from the hut out beyond the wire entanglements.  It was then, seeing there was no one here to support me, that I fired my rifle.\"  \"Ha!  And the fellow is there still?\" demanded the officer quickly.  \"Still, your honour, unless he has escaped during the time the Sergeant cross-questioned me; of a truth, he is still there, unless, perhaps, he should have in the meantime, while I was delayed in executing my duty, contrived to clamber out of the opening.\"  \"Close in, you men,\" bellowed the officer; \"half a dozen of you come along with me, and hold your rifles ready.  Now, into the hut and let us capture these fellows.\"  Closing round the entrance to the hovel--termed a hut--in which the unfortunate interned aliens had been forced to live for months, the sentries watched the officer and a few of their comrades push their way into the interior, heard them stamping on the boards, and listened to the peremptory orders of the former.  \"Come out, you ruffian, or ruffians,\" he bellowed.  \"We have you securely, and any further attempt at escape will be met with instant execution.  Ah!  I can see a man down below.  Go in, two of you men, and haul him up to the surface.\"  With no great show of enthusiasm, stiffly, and with a lack of energy and that activity to be expected of younger men, two of the guards at once lowered themselves into the pit dug beneath the boards which did duty as a flooring to this hovel, and, disappearing from sight in the tunnel excavated from the bottom of it, were presently heard giving expression to gruff commands, while the sound of scuffling followed. Then they reappeared, dragging a couple of dishevelled and exceedingly dirty prisoners with them.  Others of the guards then stepped forward, and in a trice the wretched men who had been detected in the act of escaping were dragged from the hole, were placed between sentries, and were marched out of the hut.  Meanwhile, as may be imagined, the excitement in the camp had not tended to decrease, for curiosity had been added to it.  There was a throng of prisoners round the hut long since, watching at first the altercation between the Sergeant and the sentry, and then observing and listening to all that followed.  \"A pretty kettle of fish--eh?\" sneered Stuart, the healthy Britisher. \"Sorry for those poor beggars; for their rations have been short enough already, and now, if they are not shot, they will get close confinement and bread and water only for a couple of weeks or more.  Bad luck! Horribly bad luck!  Just at the last, too, for it looks as though they were well on the way to safety.\"  \"Now, report,\" suddenly came the voice of the little officer, as he glowered upon the prisoners.  \"You two who went into the tunnel report on its length, its depth.  Bah!  You didn't look!  You didn't ascertain that!  Wait while I investigate the matter.\"  Seizing an electric torch from one of the hapless prisoners, the officer dropped into the pit immediately and was gone for some few minutes, only to emerge again, dirty like the prisoners, but triumphant instead of crestfallen, his face beaming, his eyes sparkling with happiness.  So pleased was he that he even went to the length of patting that stout, rotund sentry on the shoulder as soon as he had emerged into the open.  \"A fine catch,\" he told him, \"bravely done, my friend!  See, you detected them just at the very right moment, for the dusk is already growing, and in five minutes or less they would have been in the open. Let me tell you, that tunnel was not prepared in a day or two, or even in a week, I am certain.  It is the work of days and days, grim, hard work, and has been carried right up beyond the hut and under the wire entanglements.  There it stops, though already it was rising to the surface, and to-morrow morning, when we investigate the place, I feel sure that a thrust with a bar will break a way into the open.  March the prisoners across to the guard-room; and you, my friend, come along and make your report to the Commandant.  Ha!  What are all these rascals doing here?  Curious, eh?  Get back to your stables!\"  There was an instant move on the part of the prisoners interned in the camp, who had collected in this corner to see what was passing. Turning about promptly--for to disobey an order when under the thumb of Germans was to court a shot from a rifle--they went off briskly in the dusk to their own particular huts, while behind them was heard the sharp command of the sergeant in charge of the sentries, the tramp of heavy feet, and the passage of the sentries and prisoners in the direction of the guard-room.  \"Come along,\" said Stuart, his hands deep in his pockets, his head held forward, his chin on his breast.  \"I'm frightfully sorry for those poor fellows.  Just fancy!  To be within, say, a foot of freedom and then to fall, and then to be detected by the merest mischance.\"  \"Within a foot of freedom!  That's what that officer said,\" Henri was muttering to himself.  \"Just a foot, just a thrust of an iron bar, and then to safety, freedom--freedom from this prison.  Why not!\"  \"Why"]]]
