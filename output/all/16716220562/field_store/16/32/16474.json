Lat._, cxiv., 948.)        [Illustration: St. Gregory, from MS. of Coronation Services]  This refers, strictly speaking, to the Antiphonale Missarum. But the following extract treats directly of the chants of the office contained in the _Liber Responsorialis_, or corresponding volume for the hour services.    \"As for the chants for use at the different hours, whether of the day   or of the night, it is believed that it was St. Gregory who assigned to   them their complete arrangement, just as he had already done, as we   have said, for the Sacramentary.\" (_c._ xxv., 958.)  These two passages establish the fact that there was a tradition in the middle of the ninth century that St. Gregory set in order the ecclesiastical music. It seems also that there was an inscription at the beginning of the Antiphoner stating as a fact that he had done this. The following extract helps us to identify what this inscription was.    V.--Agobard of Lyons (779-840). _Liber de Correctione Antiphonarii_,   _c._ xv., _Patr. Lat._ civ., 336. \"But because the inscription serving   for title to the book in question [_i.e._, the Antiphoner] puts in the   forefront the name of 'Gregorius Præsul,' thereupon some people imagine   that the work was composed by the Blessed Gregory, Pope of Rome and   illustrious doctor.\"  He is here defending the chant of Lyons against the ultramontane efforts of Amalarius to introduce the Roman ways. He goes on to try to prove that the Antiphoner defended by Amalarius cannot be St. Gregory's, because he had forbidden the use of words not taken directly from Scripture.  VI.--Amalarius of Metz (815-835) is undoubtedly the person who played the foremost part in the fusion of the Gallican element with the rest of the Gregorian or Gelasian Liturgy, from which combination has come in substance the Roman Liturgy in use to-day. He had travelled much, and had been at Rome. He is a weighty authority in the present question. The following extracts are taken from a supplementary chapter of his _De Divinis Officiis_, published by Mabillon, in his _Vetera Analecta_ (_Paris_, 1723). He is speaking of the Pope Gregory who is the author of the Dialogues, and who sent St. Augustine into England.    \"Amongst the monks who have been raised to the Supreme Pontificate can   be cited Denys, and Gregory of incomparable memory. Now Gregory,   amongst many other things by which he furthered the advantage of the   Church, had the glory of being the chief organizer of the Office for   clerical use.\" (_p._ 93.)    \"In the time of St. Bennet the whole order of psalmody had not yet been   fixed with precision in the Psalter and the Antiphoner: it was the   incomparable Pope Gregory of holy memory, himself a zealous observer of   the rule of St. Bennet and an imitator of his monastic perfection, who   afterwards regulated the arrangement of it under the direction of the   Holy Spirit.\" (_pp._ 93-4.)    \"Far from blaming those who preserve the Gregorian usage, they should   rather praise them.\" (_p._ 94.)    \"In the authentic model of St. Gregory, the _Alleluia_ and the _Gloria_   are suppressed at the Mass for Innocents' Day, in order to express the   grief of the mothers or of the Church.\" (_p._ 96.)  Amalarius was commissioned by Louis the Debonair to procure at Rome a copy of the Antiphoner to serve as a model for an uniform use in place of the varying uses then to be found. The Pope in answer to his request replied, \"I have no Antiphoner that I can send to my son and lord the Emperor. Those which we had, were taken to France by Wala, Abbot of Corbie, when he came here on a mission.\" On his return to France, Amalarius went to Corbie, where he found the four volumes brought by Wala. They contained an inscription saying that this collection was put in order by Pope Adrian I. But he found that they differed from the books at Metz, which were older still; so in despair he made a compilation of his own, taking from each what seemed to him the best.  Now it has been argued that if these Antiphoners had either of them borne the name of Gregory the Great, Amalarius would not have had the audacity to alter them in this manner, nor would he if there had existed anywhere in Gaul any bearing his name. But this idea has arisen from the confusion attending the name \"antiphoner.\" The book that Amalarius was dealing with was not the Antiphoner for Mass, but the Antiphoner for Divine Service. There were great variations in the latter in different localities down to the reform by Pius V., far more than in the former. When the \"famous authentic model of Gregory\" is spoken of, it is the Antiphonale Missarum which is meant.    VII.--Amalarius, Bishop of Trèves (809-814). _Liber Officiorum_, from a   MS. at Trèves, quoted by Morin, _fol._ 6, _De Missa Innocentium_. \"The   Mass of the Innocents begins in the Diurnal with this Rubric: '_Gloria   in Excelsis Deo_ is not sung, nor _Alleluia_, unless it be Sunday; this   day is passed in a sort of sadness.' The Holy Pope Gregory, in whom   dwelt in very truth the Holy Ghost, and to whom is due the composition   of this office, means us to share the feelings of the pious women who   bewailed and lamented the death of the Innocents. And if it is   permitted to transgress the order of so great a Father, it would   equally be lawful to chant Alleluia with the complete office of the day   on Good Friday.\"      It is a question here of the Antiphoner of the Mass.    (_fol._ 7.) On the day of the Epiphany \"we lose one of the chants which   we have at Christmas, viz., the Invitatory. St. Gregory, the organizer   of the offices, meant by this peculiarity to recall to our memory as   strongly as he could what passed formerly at the time of the   accomplishment of the mysteries which we honour. That is why we chant   in the sixth place the psalm which we had avoided in the beginning. It   is true that certain blunderers treat this with indifference and   contempt, thinking it much better to follow the ordinary usage of each   day. But, as we have already said, he wished by this to distinguish\"   &c., &c.      This passage refers to the Antiphoner of the Office.    (_fol._ 9-10.) \"That is why Gregory, the author of our office, has   placed Septuagesima.... However, Gregory the institutor of our   office....\"      It is a question of the Antiphoner and of the Sacramentary.    (_fol._ 39.) \"The author of our office, who is none other than   Gregory....\"      He is referring to a portion of the Antiphoner of the Mass.  In the following passage Amalarius distinguishes the work of the two first Gregories as to the Thursdays in Lent.    (_fol._ 102.) \"The Holy Pope Gregory in arranging the offices of the   year had left vacant the Thursdays of Lent.... A long time after him   another Pope, Gregory the younger, ordained that these days should also   be celebrated by Masses and Prayers, but with less solemnity, and he   borrowed wherever he could material to form the offices of these   Thursdays.\"    VIII.--Pope Adrian I. (772-795). A MS. from Saint Martial de Limoges   contains this passage (_Paris, Bibl. Nat., No._ 2400.) \"Adrian II.,   after the example of his predecessor of the same name, completed the   Gregorian Antiphoner in several places. He also arranged a second   prologue in hexameter verse to be chanted at High Mass on the first day   of Advent. This prologue begins in the same way as another very short   one composed by the first Adrian to be sung at all the Masses of this   first Sunday in Advent, but that of Adrian II. is composed of a greater   number of verses.\"  We have seen the passage in which Walafrid Strabo speaks of the inscription at the beginning of the Antiphoner, ascribing its origin to Gregory I., and again that in which Agobard of Lyons tells us that the inscription contained the words \"Gregorius Præsul.\" There are five forms extant of the prologue in hexameter verse. The shortest, and therefore the one probably composed by Adrian I., is as follows:--        \"Gregorius Præsul meritis et nomine dignus       Unde genus ducit, summum ascendit honorem.       Renovavit monumenta patrum priorum: tunc       Composuit hunc libellum musicæ artis       Scholæ cantorum anni circuli: Ad te levavi.\"  All the five forms begin with the same two first lines. Eckhart got over the difficulty caused to his theory by these lines by supposing that \"Gregorius Præsul\" meant not Gregory the Great, but Gregory II. But he does not explain how \"Unde genus ducit,\" &c., can refer to the latter. But it fits Gregory I. in this way: Pope Felix was his great-great-grandfather; so that, on succeeding to the papacy, he as it were entered on a family inheritance.  This prologue proves that the Antiphoner was ascribed by tradition to St. Gregory in the latter half of the eighth century.  IX.--Egbert, Archbishop of York (732-766), is a still more important witness. Born about 678, he was ordained deacon at Rome, and received the archiepiscopal pallium from Gregory III. in 735. He was the disciple and friend of Bede, the confidant and benefactor of St. Boniface, and the teacher of Alcuin. Shortly after he became archbishop he composed a work addressed to his brother bishops, and called _De Institutione Catholica_. The following extracts from it refer to the Ember-day Fasts.    \"As for us in the Church of England, we always observe the Fast of the   First Month in the first week of Lent, relying on the authority of our   teacher, St. Gregory, who has thus regulated it in the model which he   has handed down to us in his Antiphoner and his Missal through the   medium of our pedagogue the Blessed Augustine.\" (_Patr. Lat._ lxxxix.,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31582"],["title","St. Gregory and the Gregorian Music (#3)"],["body",".)    \"As for the Fast of the Fourth Month, the same St. Gregory, by the same   envoy, has prescribed in his Antiphoner and his Missal the week which   follows Pentecost as that in which the Church of England ought to   celebrate it. And this is attested not only by our own Antiphoners, but   also by those which we have inspected with their corresponding missals   in the Churches of St. Peter and St. Paul.\" (_Ibid._)  Egbert brings us back to the seventh century, but during that century (the beginning of which saw the death of Gregory) we have no direct evidence. There are some considerations, however, which may account for this.  In the first place, we have very little light thrown on the history of St. Gregory by the sources of the seventh century. Apart from his Registrum there is little recorded that would by itself justify his surname of the Great. In the _Liber Pontificalis_ there are only a few lines about him, whilst the Hellenic Popes, who sat in the Papal chair from 685 to 741, have detailed biographies, generally very laudatory. The mission of Augustine for the conversion of England is undoubtedly one of the most striking facts in Gregory's life; but the only chronicler of the seventh century who mentions it is the Continuator of Prosper. Is it surprising, then, that there is a still more profound silence on a fact less calculated to attract outside attention, such as is the recasting of the liturgical books peculiar to the Church at Rome?  In the second place, care must be taken not to apply the ideas of to-day to another age. It must not be supposed that the Gregorian Reform was promulgated throughout the Western Churches in the same manner, for instance, as the Reform of Pius V. The modern system of centralization did not then exist. When Gregory took the liturgical books in hand, he had at first in view only the Papal chapel, and the churches at Rome under his immediate supervision. It was their importation into England in the lifetime of St. Augustine, and into the Frankish Empire two hundred years after, under the pressure exerted by the first Carlovingians, which gave the greatest impetus to their universal use. In Italy, on the contrary, and even at Rome, it came about gradually only through the insistence of such Popes as Leo IV. and Stephen X. that the Gregorian Chant in the end completely supplanted that in use in early times in the Peninsula. This explains why the first witnesses in favour of the Gregorian tradition come to us from England and Carlovingian Gaul.  [Illustration: St. Gregory, from MS. of The Dialogues of St. Gregory at the British Museum]  Again, one ought not to expect to find the chroniclers laying stress on the Gregorian origin of the Roman books in the lifetime of those who were contemporaries and disciples of the great Pope, and who had themselves introduced the book from Rome. The fact would be taken as a matter of course. It would not be till these had passed away that a tradition would begin to form, and stress be laid on the fact; and this brings us to the date of Archbishop Egbert.  Besides, who would have suspected the full importance of this Gregorian form, and, in particular, have foreseen that it would put a limit to the period of elaboration of the Western liturgy? So many Popes had already taken the matter in hand. The great work of Gregory was to organize, set in order, and fix. But only time can show what is really fixed. The greatness of his work is only apparent after having remained unaltered for centuries.  These considerations tend to show that there is no cause for surprise that it should have taken so long for people to realize the greatness of Gregory's work in setting in order the music of the Church.                              INTERNAL EVIDENCE.  The oldest Antiphoners that we possess are some two hundred years later than Gregory I. But they possess two peculiarities which raise a presumption in favour of an origin at least as old as St. Gregory.  The first peculiarity lies in the version of Scripture from which are taken the portions to which the music is set. This version is the old Latin one known as \"Itala.\" Now even if at the time of St. Gregory it had not entirely given place to the Vulgate, yet from his time onwards the latter prevailed universally (except for the Psalter, which was retained at Rome till the time of Pius V., and is still used at St. Peter's), not only in Rome, but in all the West; so much so, that St. Isidore of Seville could assert in the first half of the seventh century, that St. Jerome's version had already been taken into use by all the Churches as preferable to the ancient one. It is natural to seek the explanation of preserving an obsolete text of the words in the respect felt for the melodies to which they were set. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that these melodies existed for the most part before the definite abandonment of the Itala at Rome, that is to say before the middle of the seventh century.  The second peculiarity which supports this conclusion is to be found in the comparison of the Offices, known to have been added since the time of St. Gregory, with the older portion of the Antiphoner. With very few, and those very doubtful, exceptions, the materials for these are all taken from older Offices. Sometimes both words and tunes are transferred bodily; sometimes new words are set to the old melodies.  There are certain Masses of Saints, the chants for which were taken from those which later were collected together to form the Common. For the Feasts of the Annunciation, the Assumption, and the Nativity of the Virgin, all the chants were taken from older Masses, _e.g._, from the masses of Advent and of certain Virgins and Martyrs. The Procession of the Purification, both words and melody, was borrowed from the Greeks by Pope Sergius. For the Mass of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross all the chants were taken from elsewhere, with the possible exception of the Communion. The _Introit_ and the _Gradual_ were taken from Maundy Thursday, the _Alleluia_ from Friday in Easter week, and the _Offertory_ from Maundy Thursday, or the Second Mass for Christmas-day. The _Introit_ for the Purification is borrowed from the Eighth Sunday after Trinity.  The compositions either in the Sanctorale or the Temporale of the Mass that can be definitely dated as introduced after the death of St. Gregory are very few, and may perhaps have been borrowed, with the Festivals themselves, from outside by the Roman Church.  It is a reasonable conclusion to draw, then, that the addition of these portions in the seventh century shows at least a great diminution of musical productive power, and that the bulk of the Antiphoner of the Mass must have been composed before this date. This inference is supported by the conclusion which M. Gevaert draws from his examination of the Antiphons of Divine Service (_La Melopée Antique_, _p._ 175), viz., that the Golden Age for compositions of this class was the period 540-600. The natural deduction from this is that the main settlement of the Antiphoner of the Mass fell within the same period.  Still it may not have been wholly due to a cessation of musical activity that new music for the Mass gradually ceased to be written in the course of the seventh century, for a certain amount of music still continued to be written for the Hour Services. It may have been due to a feeling that the book was a closed and settled one after a final and authoritative revision such as St. Gregory's is traditionally held to have been, and that it was presumptuous to add to it. But whichever view is taken of this, the Gregorian tradition is equally supported.  A further support to the claims of Gregory I. as against Gregory II. is to be found in an examination of the Communions of the Masses of Lent. These form a series taken from the Psalms in numerical order, I. to XXVI., with the exception of five for which have been substituted texts taken from the Gospel. The Thursdays in Lent, however, form an exception to this scheme; they are interpolations breaking the order of it. Now we know that they were added by Gregory II.; therefore the original scheme of the Masses of Lent, at least, was drawn up before the time of Gregory II. Of the twenty-four pieces contained in the masses for the first six Thursdays in Lent, twenty-one appear in the Sundays after Trinity. It seems certain that the Thursdays in Lent must have borrowed from the Sundays after Trinity, and not _vice versa_; this is supported by the fact that the Graduals and Offertories of the Thursdays in Lent are all borrowed, and of the Sundays after Trinity hardly any. So this addition, which we know to be of the date of Gregory II., was made to a scheme already in existence, and both words and music were borrowed from other parts of the Antiphonale Missarum.  As against the claims made for the Hellenic Popes of the seventh and eighth centuries, it is worth while to examine the music which it is probable was introduced by Hellenic influence during that time, and compare it with the bulk of the \"Gregorian.\" The tropes and the melodies from which the sequences developed probably come under this head, and some specimens of these may be seen in the _Winchester Troper_ (_Ed._ Rev. W. H. Frere, _H. Bradshaw Society_, 1894). An examination of these melodies will show that their structure is entirely unlike the structure of the Gregorian melodies, especially in the close with a rise from the note below the final to the final, which continually occurs at the end of the phrases. This will be very clear from the accompanying melody, _Cithara_, from which the sequence _Rex Omnipotens_ was formed. This form of close appears at the end of each of the first five sections, and again at the end of the seventh and eighth. In the rest of the sequence, the melody rises to a higher range, and the close appears a fifth higher in the ninth and tenth sections, a fourth higher in"]]]
