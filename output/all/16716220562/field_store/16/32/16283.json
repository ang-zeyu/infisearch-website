Rainey and Rollin H. Baker   The pigmy woodrat, _Neotoma goldmani_ Merriam, the smallest known member of the genus, inhabits rocky areas in the elevated desert regions of the northern part of the Mexican Plateau (Mesa del Norte). Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 31:82, October 10, 1910) had for study ten specimens from two localities in Coahuila. Since his report, Dalquest (Louisiana State Univ. Studies, Biol. Sci. Ser. No. 1:162, December 28, 1953) extended the known distribution of this species approximately 225 miles southward into San Luis Potosí, where he reported animals from five localities. Field workers from the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas recently have taken _goldmani_ in the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas and San Luis Potosí, and now we can define, with greater accuracy, the geographic range of this species (see fig. 1 and list of specimens examined).  Goldman (_loc. cit._), relying chiefly on external appearance, placed _goldmani_ in the _desertorum_ group, now known as the _lepida_ group (Goldman, Jour. Mamm., 13:67, February 9, 1932). Blossom (Occ. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 315:3, May 29, 1935) thought that _goldmani_ might be a subspecies of _lepida_ but that intergradation between the two had not been demonstrated. Our newly acquired material, instead of confirming the opinions of Goldman and Blossom, shows that _goldmani_ is more closely related to _Neotoma albigula_.  Externally _goldmani_ resembles _Neotoma lepida_ (examples from California, Utah, and Colorado) in having long, silky pelage; ochraceous buffy coloring, especially along sides; and underparts basally plumbeous except for a small throat patch where the hairs are entirely white in some individuals. In _albigula_ this patch of white hairs usually is much larger and more conspicuous. Cranially, instead of resembling the _lepida_ group (including _Neotoma stephensi_), _goldmani_ looks more nearly like a miniature _albigula_ (specimens of _albigula_ from Coahuila). The auditory bullae, in relation to the length of the skull, are of comparable size in _goldmani_ and _albigula_ whereas those of the _lepida_ group are proportionately much larger. Moreover, the posterior margin of the palatal bridge is concave in _goldmani_ and _albigula_ instead of truncate as in the _lepida_ group. _Neotoma goldmani_ differs from both _albigula_ and _lepida_ in: ascending branches of premaxillaries broader posteriorly; supraorbital ridges less pronounced; rostrum less massive; interparietal broader in relation to width of cranium; interorbital space, relative to length of skull, wider; and upper molar teeth broader in relation to their length.      [Illustration: FIGURE 1. Distribution of the pigmy woodrat,     _Neotoma goldmani_. Solid circles represent specimens     examined; hollow circles represent others reported but not     examined.]  The baculum of _goldmani_, when compared with bacula and with figures of these bones in Burt and Barkalow (Jour. Mamm., 23:291 and 293, August 13, 1942) of species representing the _floridana_, _lepida_, _albigula_, _mexicana_, _fuscipes_, and _cinerea_ groups, was found to resemble most closely the baculum of _albigula_ in general proportions (ratio of length to lateral diameter of base) and in having a distinct knob at the distal end. The baculum of _goldmani_ differs slightly from that of _albigula_ in having a less downwardly curved shaft and in having a less pronounced median dorsal depression at the proximal end. Although _goldmani_ bears some external resemblance to _lepida_, the cranial characters mentioned above and the size and shape of the baculum show that _goldmani_ is best arranged as a member of the _albigula_ group.      [Illustration: FIGURE 2. Dorsal, end (proximal), and lateral     views of the baculum of _Neotoma goldmani_, adult, No. 40758     KU, × 5.]  Measurements (in millimeters) of the mature baculum (fig. 2, No. 40758 KU) are: total length, 6.2; lateral diameter of base, 2.6; dorso-ventral diameter of base, 1.4; lateral diameter of the shaft near the middle of the bone, 0.6. Except for being smaller, the bacula of the younger _goldmani_ are like the mature ones.  Assistance with field work is acknowledged from the Kansas University Endowment Association and the National Science Foundation. The figures were drawn by Victor Hogg. Bacula were prepared for study following the method outlined by White (Jour. Mamm., 32:125, February 15, 1951).      _Specimens examined._--Total, 15, all in the Museum of     Natural History at the University of Kansas.

LENDELL COCKRUM   In studying the kinds of mammals known from Kansas, I had occasion to examine a series of _Perognathus flavus_ from the western part of the state. Comparisons of these specimens with topotypes of named subspecies revealed that the specimens from Kansas belong to a heretofore undescribed subspecies which ranges through western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, and western Oklahoma. This subspecies is named and described as follows.   =Perognathus flavus bunkeri=, new subspecies       _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 11716, Univ.      Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; Conard Farm, 1 mi. E Coolidge,      Hamilton County, Kansas; 1 July 1936; obtained by F. Parks      and C. W. Hibbard, original No. 894 of Hibbard.       _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements). Color light,      upper parts between Pinkish Buff and Cinnamon-Buff      (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and      Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912), sparsely mixed      with black hairs; the effect at a distance of eight feet, is      between Clay Color and Tawny-Olive; lateral line between      Pinkish Buff and Cinnamon-Buff; postauricular spots near      Pinkish Buff; small subauricular spots white; underparts      white. Skull of medium size (see measurements); frontonasal      and mastoidal regions much enlarged; interparietal      transversely narrow.       _Comparisons._--From topotypes of _P. f. flavus_ from El      Paso, El Paso County, Texas, _P. f. bunkeri_ differs as      follows: Averaging larger in all cranial measurements taken      except in occipitonasal length, which is approximately the      same, and in interparietal width, which is less; color more      buffy, with fewer black hairs dorsally. From topotypes of      _P. f. piperi_ from 23 miles southwest of Newcastle, Weston      County, Wyoming, _P. f. bunkeri_ differs as follows: Smaller      in frontonasal length, mastoidal breadth, and length of      auditory bulla; color more buffy, with fewer black hairs      dorsally. From topotypes of _P. f. sanluisi_ from nine miles      east of Center, Alamosa County, Colorado, _P. f. bunkeri_      differs as follows: Averaging larger in all cranial      measurements taken except interparietal width, which is      smaller; color lighter and more buffy.  _Remarks._--This is a brightly colored subspecies of _Perognathus flavus_, with less black dorsally than any adjacent one. The lateral line is well marked. Three young adult specimens taken from Wakeeney, Trego County, Kansas, are much brighter than other specimens from Kansas. The five specimens from Greeley, Weld County, Colorado, are much darker dorsally, like _P. f. piperi_, but are referable to _P. f. bunkeri_ on the basis of cranial characters.  The name _P. f. bunkeri_ is proposed in recognization of the continued attention which the late Charles Dean Bunker, Curator of Birds and Mammals of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, gave to building up the collection of mammals from Kansas. Acknowledgment is made of the assistance afforded me by a Research Assistantship with the Kansas Biological Survey.       _Measurements._--Measurements of holotype and average of      four adults (two males and two females) from the type      locality are as follows: total length, 104, 105.2; length of      tail, 44, 47.5; length of hind foot, 16, 16.7; length of      ear, 7, 7.2; occipitonasal length, 20.6, 20.9; frontonasal      length, 14.0, 13.9; mastoidal breadth, 12.1, 12.0; length of      bulla, 8.0, 7.8; interorbital breadth, 4.5, 4.6; alveolar      length of upper molariform tooth-row, 3.3, 3.1;      interparietal width, 3.2, 3.2. All of the measurements      listed above are available for each of the five specimens      except that the occipitonasal length and frontonasal length      are not available for the two males.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 54, distributed by localities      of capture as shown below.
