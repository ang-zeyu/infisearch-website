The real ridge rose ahead, thickly forested on the lower slopes, then strewn with rock and granite like the landscape of an airless, deserted moon. And above the rock, there were straight walls capped with blinding snow and ice. Down one peak a glacier flowed, a waterfall, a cascade shockingly arrested in motion. I murmured the trailman's name for the mountain, aloud, and translated it for the others:  \"The Wall Around the World.\"  \"Good name for it,\" Lerrys murmured, coming with his mug in his hand to look at the mountain. \"Jason, the big peak there has never been climbed, has it?\"  \"I can't remember.\" My teeth were chattering and I went back toward the fire. Regis surveyed the distant glacier and murmured, \"It doesn't look too bad. There could be a route along that western _arête_--Hjalmar, weren't you with the expedition that climbed and mapped High Kimbi?\"  The giant nodded, rather proudly. \"We got within a hundred feet of the top, then a snowstorm came up and we had to turn back. Some day we'll tackle the Wall Around the World--it's been tried, but no one ever climbed the peak.\"  \"No one ever will,\" Lerrys stated positively, \"There's two hundred feet of sheer rock cliff, Prince Regis, you'd need wings to get up. And there's the avalanche ledge they call Hell's Alley--\"  Kendricks broke in irritably, \"I don't care whether it's ever been climbed or ever will be climbed, we're not going to climb it now!\" He stared at me and added, \"I hope!\"  \"We're not.\" I was glad of the interruption. If the youngsters and amateurs wanted to amuse themselves plotting hypothetical attacks on unclimbable sierras, that was all very well, but it was, if nothing worse, a great waste of time. I showed Kendricks a notch in the ridge, thousands of feet lower than the peaks, and well-sheltered from the icefalls on either side.  \"That's Dammerung; we're going through there. We won't be on the mountain at all, and it's less than 22,000 feet high in the pass--although there are some bad ledges and washes. We'll keep clear of the main tree-roads if we can, and all the mapped trailmen's villages, but we may run into wandering bands--\" abruptly I made my decision and gestured them around me.  \"From this point,\" I broke the news, \"we're liable to be attacked. Kyla, tell them what you saw.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She put down her mug. Her face was serious again, as she related what she had seen on the bridge. \"We're on a peaceful mission, but they don't know that yet. The thing to remember is that they do not wish to kill, only to wound and rob. If we show fight--\" she displayed a short ugly knife, which she tucked matter-of-factly into her shirt-front, \"they will run away again.\"  Lerrys loosened a narrow dagger which until this moment I had thought purely ornamental. He said, \"Mind if I say something more, Jason? I remember from the 'Narr campaign--the trailmen fight at close quarters, and by human standards they fight dirty.\" He looked around fiercely, his unshaven face glinting as he grinned. \"One more thing. I like elbow room. Do we have to stay roped together when we start out again?\"  I thought it over. His enthusiasm for a fight made me feel both annoyed and curiously delighted. \"I won't make anyone stay roped who thinks he'd be safer without it,\" I said, \"we'll decide that when the time comes, anyway. But personally--the trailmen are used to running along narrow ledges, and we're not. Their first tactic would probably be to push us off, one by one. If we're roped, we can fend them off better.\" I dismissed the subject, adding, \"Just now, the important thing is to dry out.\"  Kendricks remained at my side after the others had gathered around the fire, looking into the thick forest which sloped up to our campsite. He said, \"This place looks as if it had been used for a camp before. Aren't we just as vulnerable to attack here as we would be anywhere else?\"  He had hit on the one thing I hadn't wanted to talk about. This clearing was altogether too convenient. I only said, \"At least there aren't so many ledges to push us off.\"  Kendricks muttered, \"You've got the only blaster!\"  \"I left it at Carthon,\" I said truthfully. Then I laid down the law:  \"Listen, Buck. If we kill a single trailman, except in hand-to-hand fight in self-defense, we might as well pack up and go home. We're on a peaceful mission, and we're begging a favor. Even if we're attacked--we kill only as a last resort, and in hand-to-hand combat!\"  \"Damned primitive frontier planet--\"  \"Would you rather die of the trailmen's disease?\"  He said savagely, \"We're apt to catch it anyway--here. You're immune, you don't care, you're safe! The rest of us are on a suicide mission--and damn it, when I die I want to take a few of those monkeys with me!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I bent my head, bit my lip and said nothing. Buck couldn't be blamed for the way he felt. After a moment I pointed to the notch in the ridge again. \"It's not so far. Once we get through Dammerung, it's easy going into the trailmen's city. Beyond there, it's all civilized.\"  \"Maybe _you_ call it civilization,\" Kendricks said, and turned away.  \"Come on, let's finish drying our feet.\"  And at that moment they hit us.         *       *       *       *       *  Kendricks' yell was the only warning I had before I was fighting away something scrabbling up my back. I whirled and ripped the creature away, and saw dimly that the clearing was filled to the rim with an explosion of furry white bodies. I cupped my hands and yelled, in the only trailman dialect I knew, \"Hold off! We come in peace!\"  One of them yelled something unintelligible and plunged at me--another tribe! I saw a white-furred, chinless face, contorted in rage, a small ugly knife--a female! I ripped out my own knife, fending away a savage slash. Something tore white-hot across the knuckles of my hand; the fingers went limp and my knife fell, and the trailman woman snatched it up and made off with her prize, swinging lithely upward into the treetops.  I searched quickly, gripped with my good hand at the bleeding knuckles, and found Regis Hastur struggling at the edge of a ledge with a pair of the creatures. The crazy thought ran through my mind that if they killed him all Darkover would rise and exterminate the trailmen and it would all be my fault. Then Regis tore one hand free, and made a curious motion with his fingers.  It looked like an immense green spark a foot long, or like a fireball. It exploded in one creature's white face and she gave a wild howl of terror and anguish, scrabbled blindly at her eyes, and with a despairing shriek, ran for the shelter of the trees. The pack of trailmen gave a long formless wail, and then they were gathering, flying, retreating into the shadows. Rafe yelled something obscene and then a bolt of bluish flame lanced toward the retreating pack. One of the humanoids fell without a cry, pitching senseless over the ledge.  I ran toward Rafe, struggling with him for the shocker he had drawn from its hiding-place inside his shirt. \"You blind damned fool!\" I cursed him, \"you may have ruined everything--\"  \"They'd have killed him without it,\" he retorted wrathfully. He had evidently failed to see how efficiently Regis defended himself. Rafe motioned toward the fleeing pack and sneered, \"Why don't you go with your friends?\"  With a grip I thought I had forgotten, I got my hand around Rafe's knuckles and squeezed. His hand went limp and I snatched the shocker and pitched it over the ledge.  \"One word and I'll pitch you after it,\" I warned. \"Who's hurt?\"  Garin was blinking senselessly, half-dazed by a blow; Regis' forehead had been gashed and dripped blood, and Hjalmar's thigh sliced in a clean cut. My own knuckles were laid bare and the hand was getting numb. It was a little while before anybody noticed Kyla, crouched over speechless with pain. She reeled and turned deathly white when we touched her; we stretched her out where she was, and got her shirt off, and Kendricks crowded up beside us to examine the wound.  \"A clean cut,\" he said, but I didn't hear. Something had turned over inside me, like a hand stirring up my brain, and....         *       *       *       *       *  Jay Allison looked around with a gasp of sudden vertigo. He was not in Forth's office, but standing precariously near the edge of a cliff. He shut his eyes briefly, wondering if he were having one of his worst nightmares, and opened them on a familiar face.  Buck Kendricks was bone-white, his mouth widening as he said hoarsely, \"Jay! Doctor Allison--for God's sake--\"  A doctor's training creates reactions that are almost reflexes; Jay Allison recovered some degree of sanity as he became aware that someone was stretched out in front of him, half-naked, and bleeding profusely. He motioned away the crowding strangers and said in his bad Darkovan, \"Let her alone, this is my work.\" He didn't know enough words to curse them away, so he switched to Terran, speaking to Kendricks:  \"Buck, get these people away, give the patient some air. Where's my surgical case?\" He bent and probed briefly, realizing only now that the injured was a woman, and young.  The wound was only a superficial laceration; whatever sharp instrument had inflicted it, had turned on the costal bone without penetrating lung tissue. It could have been sutured, but Kendricks handed him only a badly-filled first-aid kit; so Dr. Allison covered it tightly with a plastic clip-shield which would seal it from further bleeding, and let it alone. By the time he had finished, the strange girl had begun to stir. She said haltingly, \"Jason--?\"  \"Dr. Allison,\" he corrected tersely, surprised in a minor way--the major surprise had blurred lesser ones--that she knew his name.

SMITH  Illustrated by KOSSIN  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction January 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]   [Sidenote: _\"Nuts to you!\" was what Narli knew Earthmen would tell him ... only it was frismil nuts!_]  \"The Perzils are giving a vilbar party tomorrow night,\" Professor Slood said cajolingly. \"You _will_ come this time, won't you, Narli?\"  Narli Gzann rubbed his forehead fretfully. \"You know how I feel about parties, Karn.\" He took a frismil nut out of the tray on his desk and nibbled it in annoyance.  \"But this is in your honor, Narli--a farewell party. You must go. It would be--it would be unthinkable if you didn't.\" Karn Slood's eyes were pleading. He could not possibly be held responsible for his friend's anti-social behavior and yet, Narli knew, he would somehow feel at fault.  Narli sighed. He supposed he would have to conform to public sentiment in this particular instance, but he was damned if he would give in gracefully. \"After all, what's so special about the occasion? I'm just leaving to take another teaching job, that's all.\" He took another nut.  \"That's _all_!\" Slood's face swelled with emotion. \"You can't really be that indifferent.\"  \"Another job, that's all it is to me,\" Narli persisted. \"At an exceptionally high salary, of course, or I wouldn't dream of accepting a position so inconveniently located.\"  Slood was baffled and hurt and outraged. \"You have been honored by being the first of our people to be offered an exchange professorship on another planet,\" he said stiffly, \"and you call it 'just another job.' Why, I would have given my right antenna to get it!\"  Narli realized that he had again overstepped the invisible boundary between candor and tactlessness. He poked at the nuts with a stylus.  \"Honored by being the first of our species to be offered a guinea-pigship,\" he murmured.  He had not considered this aspect of the matter before, but now that it occurred to him, he was probably right.  \"Oh, I don't mind, really.\" He waved away the other's sudden commiseration. \"You know I like being alone most of the time, so I won't find that uncomfortable. Students are students, whether they're Terrestrials or Saturnians. I suppose they'll laugh at me behind my back, but then even here, my students always did that.\"  He gave a hollow laugh and unobtrusively put out one of his hands for a nut. \"At least on Earth I'll know why they're laughing.\"  There was pain on Slood's expressive face as he firmly removed the nut tray from his friend's reach. \"I didn't think of it from that angle, Narli. Of course you're right. Human beings, from what I've read of them, are not noted for tolerance. It will be difficult, but I'm sure you'll be able to--\" he choked on the kindly lie--\"win them over.\"  Narli repressed a bitter laugh. Anyone less likely than he to win over a hostile alien species through sheer personal charm could hardly be found on Saturn. Narli Gzann had been chosen as first exchange professor between Saturn and Earth because of his academic reputation, not his personality. But although the choosers had probably not had that aspect of the matter in mind, the choice, he thought, was a wise one.  As an individual of solitary habits, he was not apt to be much lonelier on one planet than another.  And he had accepted the post largely because he felt that, as an alien being, he would be left strictly alone. This would give him the chance to put in a lot of work on his definitive history of the Solar System, a monumental project from which he begrudged all the time he had to spend in fulfilling even the minimum obligations expected of a professor on sociable Saturn.  The salary was a weighty factor, too--not only was it more than twice what he had been getting, but since there would be no necessity for spending more than enough for bare subsistence he would be able to save up a considerable amount and retire while still comparatively young. It was pleasant to imagine a scholarly life unafflicted by students.  He could put up with a good deal for that goal.  But how could he alleviate the distress he saw on Karn's face? He did not consciously want to hurt the only person who, for some strange reason, seemed to be fond of him, so he said the only thing he could think of to please: \"All right, Karn, I'll go to the Perzils tomorrow night.\"  It would be a deadly bore--parties always were--and he would eat too much, but, after all, the thought that it would be a long time before he'd ever see any of his own kind again would make the affair almost endurable. And just this once it would be all right for him to eat as much as he wanted. When he was on Earth out of reach of decent food, he would probably trim down considerably.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I just _know_ you're going to love Earth, Professor Gzann,\" the hostess on the interplanetary liner gushed.  \"I'm sure I shall,\" he lied politely. She smiled at him too much, over-doing her professional cordiality; underneath the effusiveness, he sensed the repulsion. Of course he couldn't blame her for trying not to show her distaste for the strange creature--the effort at concealment was, as a matter of fact, more than he had expected from a Terrestrial. But he wished she would leave him alone to meditate. He had planned to get a lot of meditation done on the journey.  \"You speak awfully good English,\" she told him.  He looked at her. \"I am said to have some scholarly aptitude. I understand that's why I was chosen as an exchange professor. It does seem reasonable, doesn't it?\"  She turned pink--a sign of embarrassment with these creatures, he had learned. \"I didn't mean to--to question your ability, Professor. It's just that--well, you don't look like a professor.\"  \"Indeed?\" he said frostily. \"And what do I look like, then?\"  She turned even rosier. \"Oh--I--I don't know exactly. It's just that--well....\" And she fled.  He couldn't resist flicking his antennae forward to catch her _sotto voce_ conversation with the co-pilot; it was so seldom you got the chance to learn what others were saying about you behind your back. \"But I could hardly tell him he looks like a teddy bear, could I?\"  \"He probably doesn't even know what a teddy bear is.\"  \"Perhaps I don't,\" Narli thought resentfully, \"but I can guess.\"  With low cunning, the Terrestrials seemed to have ferreted out the identity of all his favorite dishes and kept serving them to him incessantly. By the time the ship made planetfall on Earth, he had gained ten grisbuts.  \"Oh, well,\" he thought, \"I suppose it's all just part of the regular diplomatic service. On Earth, I'll have to eat crude native foods, so I'll lose all the weight again.\"  President Purrington of North America came himself to meet Narli at the airfield because Narli was the first interplanetary exchange professor in history.  \"Welcome to our planet, Professor Gzann,\" he said with warm diplomatic cordiality, wringing Narli's upper right hand after a moment of indecision. \"We shall do everything in our power to make your stay here a happy and memorable one.\"  \"I wish you would begin by doing something about the climate,\" Narli thought. It was stupid of him not to have realized how hot it would be on Earth. He was really going to suffer in this torrid climate; especially in the tight Terrestrial costume he wore over his fur for the sake of conformity. Of course, justice compelled him to admit to himself, the clothes wouldn't have become so snug if he hadn't eaten quite so much on board ship.  Purrington indicated the female beside him. \"May I introduce my wife?\"  \"Ohhh,\" the female gasped, \"isn't he _cute_!\"  The President and Narli stared at her in consternation. She looked abashed for a moment, then smiled widely at Narli and the press photographers.  \"Welcome to Earth, dear Professor Gzann!\" she exclaimed, mispronouncing his name, of course. Bending down, she kissed him right upon his fuzzy forehead.  Kissing was not a Saturnian practice, nor did Narli approve of it; however, he had read enough about Earth to know that Europeans sometimes greeted dignitaries in this peculiar way. Only this place, he had been given to understand, was not Europe but America.  [Illustration]  \"I am having a cocktail party in your honor this afternoon!\" she beamed, smoothing her flowered print dress down over her girdle. \"You'll be there at five sharp, won't you, dear?\"  \"Delighted,\" he promised dismally. He could hardly plead a previous engagement a moment after arriving.  \"I've tried to get all the things you like to eat,\" she went on anxiously, \"but you will tell me if there's anything special, won't you?\"  \"I am on a diet,\" he said. He must be strong. Probably the food would be repulsive anyhow, so he'd have no difficulty controlling his appetite. \"Digestive disorders, you know. A glass of Vichy and a biscuit will be....\"  He stopped, for there were tears in Mrs. Purrington's eyes. \"Your tummy hurts? Oh, you poor little darling!\"  \"Gladys!\" the President said sharply.  There were frismil nuts at Mrs. Purrington's cocktail party and vilbar and even slipnis broogs ... all imported at fabulous expense, Narli knew, but then this was a government affair and expense means nothing to a government since, as far as it is concerned, money grows on taxpayers. Some of the native foods proved surprisingly palatable, too--pâté de foie gras and champagne and little puff pastries full of delightful surprises. Narli was afraid he was making a zloogle of himself. However, he thought, trying not to catch sight of his own portly person in the mirrors that walled the room, the lean days were just ahead.  Besides, what could he do when everyone insisted on pressing food on him? \"Try this, Professor Gzann.\" \"Do try that, Professor Gzann.\" (\"Doesn't he look cunning in his little dress suit?\") They crowded around "]]]
