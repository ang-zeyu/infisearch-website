The average number of dorsal body-blotches for the same samples are, respectively, 36.6, 37.7, 38.4, and 34.6. Only in the southernmost sample is there a noticeable difference in the number of blotches.  The specimen from Párajo Verde, Veracruz, was considered to be an intergrade between _P. deppei_ and _P. lineaticollis_ by Smith (1943: 461), who stated that, although the snake had 231 ventrals and dark lateral streaks as does _deppei_, it had light-centered dorsal blotches and stripes on the neck as does _lineaticollis_. This specimen (USNM 110892) has a high number of ventrals for _deppei_; one from Jalisco has 232, and one each from Guanajuato and Veracruz have 229. The blotches posteriorly are lighter than those anteriorly and are slightly lighter in the center than at the periphery. Two anterior blotches are divided medially and narrowly connected by black streaks. Although these are somewhat suggestive of the pattern of _lineaticollis_, they are more nearly like that of _deppei_. Four other specimens from the same area are typically _deppei_. There is some doubt as to the actual provenance of the snake stated to have come from Párajo Verde, for, according to Smith (1943: 460), the snake had been tied to a truck and dragged halfway down the slopes of the Cumbres de Acultzingo, where he found it. He surmised that it probably was dragged no farther than the settlement, Párajo Verde, at the Cumbres de Acultzingo.  Fugler and Webb (1956: 171) commented on the uniformly brown dorsum of a specimen (KU 39564) from 16 miles east and 18 miles north of Ocampo, Coahuila. It has a higher number of ventrals (242) and caudals (88) than is known for deppei. It is, without a doubt, a _Pituophis_. It is not _Pituophis catenifer_, as attested to by the presence of only two prefrontals. The high number of ventrals and caudals, together with the uniform dark brown dorsum, provide a combination of characters indicating that this specimen may represent an undescribed species in the _deppei_ group of _Pituophis_.  _Distribution._--Southern Chihuahua and southern Coahuila southward on the western and central parts of the Mexican Plateau to the Valley of México and to southeastern Puebla and adjacent Veracruz.  _Specimens examined._--Total of 63, as follows: _Aguascalientes_: 16 km.

Couch.  _Diagnosis._--This subspecies is characterized by solid body-blotches that are black anteriorly and brown posteriorly, anterior dorsal interspaces six or more scales in length, and the absence of dark stripes or rows of spots on the anterior part of the body. There are 215 to 235 ventrals, 52 to 68 caudals, and 21 to 31 dorsal body-blotches. The position of the lateral intercalary spots and lateral streaks are the same as in _deppei deppei_.  _Variation._--Throughout the range of this subspecies the posterior body-blotches are brown and noticeably lighter than the anterior ones. Juveniles are colored like adults. Specimens from the northern part of the range (Nuevo León and Tamaulipas) have 21 to 28 (average 24.0) dorsal body-blotches and 7 to 11 (average 8.9) scales in the interspace between the first and second dorsal body-blotches, as compared with specimens from the southern part of the range (Hidalgo, Queretaro, and San Luis Potosí), which have 24 to 31 (average 27.7) dorsal body-blotches and 6 to 10 (average 7.8) scales in the first interspace. Likewise, there is a difference in the number of ventrals between the northern and southern samples; those from the north have an average of 228.8 ventrals, and those from the south have 222.0. In all of these characters the southern sample shows trends towards the southern subspecies, _deppei_, which has fewer ventrals, fewer scales in the first interspace, and more dorsal body-blotches.  _Distribution._--Eastern part of the Mexican Plateau and lower leeward slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental from Hidalgo and Queretaro northward to southeastern Coahuila.  _Specimens examined._--Total of 28, as follows: _Coahuila_: Buena Vista, USNM 1522; 50 km.

Cope (1861: 300 and 1887: 72) stated that the specimen was from the southern Mexican Plateau and that it was collected by Carlos Sartorius. Smith and Taylor (1945: 108 and 1950: 348) gave the type locality as Jalapa, Veracruz. Although this locality was the source of many specimens sent to the United States by Sartorius, it is not within the known range of _lineaticollis_, and therefore cannot appropriately be thought of as the type locality. In the absence of a type specimen and a justifiable type locality, I hereby designate as a neotype, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, No. 114668. This specimen was collected 24 kilometers northwest of Ciudad Oaxaca, Oaxaca, on February 29, 1956, by William E. Duellman. It is an adult female having 229 ventrals, 67 caudals, and long black neck-stripes followed posteriorly by 23 light-centered dorsal body-blotches.  _Diagnosis._--This subspecies is characterized by the presence of continuous dark paravertebral stripes on the anterior part of the body, and light-centered dorsal body-blotches and lateral intercalary spots (Pl. 45, Fig. 2). There are 229 to 258 ventrals, 54 to 72 caudals, and 23 to 45 dorsal body-blotches posterior to the neck-stripes. The young are colored like the adults.  _Variation._--Specimens from the southern part of the range in Oaxaca have 229 to 245 ventrals (average 238.3); to the north on the Mexican Plateau in the state of Michoacán seven specimens have 231 to 243 (average 237.1) ventrals. In the relatively isolated mountain ranges of the Sierra del Sur in Guerrero and the Sierra de Coalcomán in southern Michoacán the ranges of variation and average numbers of ventrals are, respectively, 234 to 258 (245.8) and 236 to 246 (242.2). The longest neck-stripes are found in specimens from Oaxaca and Guerrero; nevertheless, some specimens from the Mexican Plateau in Michoacán and three of the four specimens from the Sierra de Coalcomán have neck-stripes equally long. One specimen from 40 kilometers north of Ciudad México and several from the vicinity of Tancítaro, Michoacán,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31570"],["title","A Taxonomic Study of the Middle American Snake, Pituophis deppei (#2)"],["body","rather shorter neck-stripes. One specimen from Dos Aguas, Michoacán, has the neck-stripes partially fragmented into rows of spots as in _gibsoni_.  On the basis of specimens from Tancítaro, Michoacán, Schmidt and Shannon (1947: 79) described the subspecies _brevilineata_, which they diagnosed as differing from _lineaticollis_ in having fewer ventrals and shorter neck-stripes. The present data suggest that the characters used to diagnose the subspecies are variable not only in Michoacán, but throughout the range of the species. Consequently, _Pituophis (deppei) brevilineata_ Schmidt and Shannon (1947) is placed in the synonymy of _Pituophis lineaticollis lineaticollis_ Cope (1861).  _Distribution._--The southern part of the Mexican Plateau in the states of Michoacán, México, and Morelos, the Sierra de Coalcomán in southern Michoacán, and the Sierra del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca.  _Specimens examined._--Total of 25, as follows: _Guerrero_: Acahuizotla, USNM 46537; Chilpancingo, CNHM 38356-9, UIMNH 35000, UMMZ 85724-5; Omiltemi, USNM 46462. _México_: 40 km.

Washington,      vol. 67, p. 172, August 5, 1954.  _Type._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No. 107060, obtained by Colvin Gibson. Type locality: Yepocapa, Chimaltenango, Guatemala.  _Diagnosis._--This race is characterized by paired, elongated, pale-centered, paravertebral spots on the anterior part of the body. Posterior to the paired spots are 22 to 27 dorsal body-blotches; these and the lateral intercalary spots have pale centers. There are 234 to 246 ventrals and 57 to 65 caudals.  _Variation._--The few specimens that are available from a small geographic area do not permit a discussion of geographic variation at this time. All of the specimens have the paired paravertebral spots and blotches with light centers. In this respect the population of _lineaticollis_ east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is noticeably different from the nominal subspecies in the Mexican highlands. Smith and Taylor (1945: 108) listed a specimen from San Cristobal, Chiapas. I have not seen this specimen and so do not know to which subspecies it belongs. On geographical grounds it probably is _gibsoni_.  _Distribution._--Guatemalan highlands and probably highlands of Chiapas. Aside from the specimens examined, two others are known--one from Volcán Agua, Sacatepequez (Slevin, 1939: 400), and one from Dueñas, Sacatepequez (Boulenger, 1894: 65); these localities are not shown in figure 1.  _Specimens examined._--Eight, as follows: Guatemala: _Chimaltenango_: Chichavac, CNHM 1927; Finca El Tesoro, 3 km.
