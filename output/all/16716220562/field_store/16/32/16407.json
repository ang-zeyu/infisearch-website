(Type from mountains of      Veracruz, Mexico.)       _Sigmodon hispidus toltecus_ Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 15:110, June 2, 1902.       _Specimens examined_, 23 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W      Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,      1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El      Carrizo, 22.  _Remarks._--Among named kinds of _Sigmodon_ this series most closely approaches _S. h. toltecus_ to the southward. The specimens are slightly lighter in color of the upper parts than are examples of this same subspecies from 8 km. NW of Potrero, Veracruz, but in other ways are similar. The single specimen from 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria is a skull only, but seems closest to _S. h. toltecus_. As is often the case with collections of _Sigmodon_, this series contains mostly immatures.  Cotton rats were found abundantly in cultivated areas. Local farmers stated that these rats were destructive to sugar cane by girdling the stems one and one-half inches above the ground.   ~Neotoma micropus micropus~ Baird  Baird Wood Rat       _Neotoma micropus_ Baird, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.      Philadelphia, p. 333, April, 1855. (Type from Charco      Escondido, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 2 from 7 km. S and 2 km. W San      Fernando.   ~Neotoma angustapalata~ new species  Tamaulipan Wood Rat       _Type._--Male, subadult, skin and skull; No. 36976, Univ.      Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El      Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 14 January 1950; obtained by      William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 578.       _Range._--Known only from the type locality; probably found      in other localities along the humid, east face of the Sierra      Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.       _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); upper parts      dusky brown, paler on sides, individual hairs on middle of      back tipped with black or with Light Pinkish Cinnamon      (capitalized color term after Ridgway, Color Standards and      Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912); head grayer      especially on cheeks; underparts dusky (dark bases of      white-tipped hairs exposed), hairs on throat and inguinal      region of adult specimen white to base; outside of legs      dusky gray; tail scaly in appearance and sparsely covered      with short, blackish hairs above and short, whitish hairs      below; skull with auditory bulla large; external auditory      meatus large; palatine region narrow; sides of      interpterygoid fossa concave and broadly excavated near      posterior end of molariform tooth-rows.       _Comparison._--_Neotoma angustapalata_ has been compared      with _N. torquata_ (specimens from Veracruz and Puebla), _N.      navus_ (Coahuila), _N. mexicana_ (New Mexico), _N. micropus_      (Tamaulipas), _N. albigula_ (Coahuila), _N. ferruginea_      (Jalisco), and _N. distincta_ (from published description in      Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 31:64, October 19, 1910). _Neotoma      angustapalata_ differs from _N. micropus_ and _N. albigula_      in having a deep, instead of a shallow, anterointernal      reentrant angle on the first upper molar and seems to belong      to the _N. mexicana_ group of wood rats. _Neotoma      angustapalata_ differs from _N. navus_, _N. mexicana_, _N.      torquata_, and _N. ferruginea_ in larger size, darker      underparts, tail with sparse, short hairs and scaly      appearance, more broadly concave sides of interpterygoid      fossa at posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, larger      external auditory meatus, and narrower palatine breadth.      _Neotoma angustapalata_ differs from the description of _N.      distincta_ in having a faintly bicolored tail, no ochraceous      pectoral band, broadly concave sides to interpterygoid      fossa, and narrower palatine breadth.  _Remarks._--_Neotoma angustapalata_ is represented by two specimens; the type and another specimen, an adult male, no. 37062, with skin and broken skull. The description takes into account both of these specimens. The most significant characteristics of _N. angustapalata_ are its scaly-appearing tail with short, sparse hairs, dusky underparts, broadly concave sides of the interpterygoid fossa at the posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, and the narrow palatine breadth. Among named kinds of _Neotoma_, the newly named species most closely resembles _N. torquata_ and _N. distincta_; however, it is geographically widely separated from these two species. _Neotoma navus_ of southeastern Coahuila is the only other member of the _N. mexicana_ group in northeastern Mexico.  These wood rats were taken in rocks and crevices at the base of a small hill in thick vegetation growing in deep humus. Schaldach termed the trapping site as \"arid tropical tending toward humid tropical\".       _Measurements._--The subadult, male holotype measures as      follows: Total length, 325; length of tail, 154; length of      hind foot, 36; length of ear from notch, 29; basilar length      (of skull), 33.9; zygomatic breadth, 22.1; interorbital      breadth, 5.7; length of nasals, 15.2; length of incisive      foramina, 8.7; length of palatal bridge, 8.5; least breadth      of palate between first upper molars, 2.7; greatest breadth      of interpterygoid space, 4.1; alveolar length of upper      molariform tooth-row, 9.6. The adult, male, no. 37062,      measures as follows: Total length, 380; tail vertebrae, 195;      hind foot, 42; ear from notch, 31; interorbital breadth (of      skull), 6.4.       _Specimens examined_, 2, from the type locality.   ~Rattus rattus~ subsp.

C.  Copyright, 1907, by James C. Elliott.     PREFACE.   A readable book should instruct, entertain and amuse. The author, outside of the historical interest of this little book, has aimed to cover a broad-enough field for all classes of readers to find some nourishing food--at least in the way of variety and shifting scenes--from the standpoint of a young private.  And in order to understand his viewpoint, a brief sketch of the author is admissible. Born in Cleveland County, N. C., about midway between Charlotte and Asheville, July 12, 1845. His father, a small slaveholder and a farmer, he was brought up to work on the farm and was well practiced in the use of firearms, and was well seasoned in the fox-chase and hunting sports. His father was an ardent Whig, and they got their political inspiration from William G. Brownlow's Knoxville, Tenn., Whig. (See Brownlow's and Pryneis' debate on Negro slavery.) Brownlow proved conclusively that slavery was of Divine origin; that it had always existed and always would exist, because the Bible said, \"The heathen you buy with your money shall never go free, but shall be an inheritance to you and your children forever.\" But when hostilities began, Brownlow sided with the Union and was the War Governor of Tennessee. The war spirit ran high in our section and all the boys were eager to take a hand in the fun of chasing the invaders out of our country. The first Manassas battle started them back the way our _smart men_ said they would go. And I thought the fun would all be over before I would have a chance to share in the glory. But they kept coming in larger swarms. After I had organized and drilled with the Home Guards, I saw there was still a prospect to get to the front in time to take a hand. Two years had dragged along, the battle of Gettysburg had turned the scale, more than half of my early in friends had been knocked out when I entered the army for a three-years' term at the age of 18 years. We had understood at the first that we must fight three to one, but to whip that many Yankees was not thought to be much of a job; but when I waded in, it was quite evident that we must fight five to one. But we still thought they must be whipped, all the same. The numbers come up to our expectations, but we were sadly deceived in their fighting qualities. When they first came our climate did not agree with them, but the longer they stayed the harder they were to persuade away; and they finally worried us out, until we had to let them alone; and after staying with us awhile we learned they are as good as we are. From a distance, they are inclined to view us with a critic's eye, as through a glass darkly; but when they come down and bring their washing, they get a clearer view. Then, and not until then, the veil is removed away, and all our problems stand revealed in open day. Progress comes through evolution and revolution; where moral forces lag physical force compels the way. The only issue now is in patriotic rivalry of the sections. The heritage of one is the property of all.  \"Oh! carry me back to old Virginia,\" \"The old Kentucky home,\" \"Carolina,\" \"Oh, for Carolina,\" \"Away down in Georgia,\" \"On the Sewanee River,\" etc., are refrains not equaled in the more frigid region. Then we have \"Dixie,\" covering the whole Southland. All these are now held in common by our whole people. Whoever heard of any one ever wanting to be carried back to New England, where the natural resources are mainly ice, granite, rock, codfish and beans. Still we are all proud of the hardy New Englander who makes the desert blossom as the rose wherever he pitches his tent. His hard environment has been a blessing to every other part of the country, forcing him to seek greener pastures in balmier climes, and to disseminate his energy and frugality in those more leisureful sections that need encouragement to greater thrift. It was the combined qualities of the Virginia cavalier and the New England Puritan that made Stonewall Jackson invincible and Robert E. Lee the highest type of the American patriot.     THE SOUTHERN SOLDIER BOY.   JAMESTOWN AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE.  The English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, was the beginning of the highest civilization in the liberty of man and the establishment of the purest and best political government the world has ever known--perfected through many vicissitudes, stands as the beacon light of human liberty for all the world.   THE JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION.  The 26th of April, 1607, is the date that will linger in history after many a dreary record of battle and coronation has been swept away. For on that date the first permanent colony of English speech made its landing on the soil of North America. It is fitting that the three hundredth anniversary of this event should be marked by the opening of the Jamestown Exposition.  The founding of Jamestown was not a step in a struggle, but a trophy of victory. And, though it began the westward march of the Saxon tongue, which has long since encircled the globe, it marked the victory less of a race than of a civilization. It was really the dedication of a continent to individual liberty; it was the definite announcement that the worn-out systems of empire should not usurp the new western land. It was a trophy gained in a hundred years of such warfare as the world has rarely seen, but it was a thousand times worth the price.  When the peoples of Europe landed on the shores of the sixteenth century, they were a curiously assorted company. Germany was still playing the solemn farce of the Roman Empire, whose real existence had terminated a thousand years before. Spain had just driven the last armed infidel from her borders, and was preparing to use in foreign conquest the military excellence she had developed in her long crusade at home. Italy, divided into a dozen small states, had carried civilization as high as a purely city civilization can go, and was ready to decline. France was halting between two opinions, but, on the whole, leaned strongly toward the course of European aggression, which she pursued for centuries. All these countries were organized on the military plan. The individual counted for little among them; commerce counted for less; all who were not soldiers could escape contempt only by becoming priests. In England and Holland a different organization prevailed. There the civilization was industrial, rather than military. Commerce was accounted a worthy work; not so high as fighting, of course, but still perfectly respectable; and the individual enjoyed a freedom and security unknown elsewhere.  Which type of civilization would endure? That was the great question before the world. Would the soldier and aristocrat, or the merchant and artisan, survive in the struggle which had already begun? The sixteenth century passed, and the contest was decided. The sturdy mechanic had outworn his armored and tinseled lord. Italy was ruined; Germany broken in two; Spain hopelessly wrecked; France, bled white by civil war, was gasping for breath. But England and Holland stood erect and at ease; and, pausing only to make sure that the victory was theirs indeed, went forth to possess the world. Jamestown and New Amsterdam were the first efforts of the free northern peoples to possess the land they had won.  And not only was Jamestown the first English colony on the continent, but it was the first white settlement that deserved the name of colony at all. The adventures of the Spaniards were not colonizing, but conquest. They were crusaders, going forth to found kingdoms, not settlers seeking out homes. They went to the most densely inhabited parts of the new world, simply because only a dense population of slaves could uphold the costly military type of Spanish civilization. The English came as homemakers. They sought out the unsettled parts of the land, and these they covered with a working civilization. Bad as slavery afterward became in this country, it never had a twentieth part of the influence on our life that the same institution had in Spanish lands. The result is history. The industrial civilization which had beaten militarism on its own ground in the old world, outstripped it with ridiculous ease in the new. Spain had a century's start, yet to-day two-thirds of the white people on the Western continent speak the English language and live within the borders of the United States.   A TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA.  Here is to Virginia, \"The Old Dominion\" State. At last with the young Confederacy linked her fate. Go search the annals of history back to the days of Abraham; trace Jewish civilization; compare Greek and Roman progress; weigh the Crusaders of the Middle Ages and the Reformers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Then look to the English people who first wrested the great Magna Charta--the Bill of Civil Rights--and human freedom from King John, and implanted these principles first in Virginia with the best blood of England, producing a Washington, a"]]]
