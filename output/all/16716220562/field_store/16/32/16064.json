When I arrived on the battle-field General Curtis told me that General Siegel and his Divisions had gone to the rear towards Cassville; in fact, I myself heard him give one of the Brigades that was passing an order to halt there, which they did not obey, but kept on. General Siegel wrote back advising Curtis to form his new line in the rear of Cross Timbers, as Van Dorn might return to the fight, but Curtis instructed Colonel Carr's Division to remain on the field and hold it, which it did. General Curtis afterwards made very severe complaints to General Halleck of the actions of General Siegel, and in answer General Halleck wrote as follows:      I was by no means surprised at General Siegel's conduct before the     battle of Pea Ridge. It was plainly in keeping with what he did at     Carthage and Wilson's Creek. After your expedition started I received     documentary proof from Captains Sturgis, Schofield, and Totten, and a     number of other officers, in regard to his conduct on those occasions,     which destroyed all confidence in him. It was for that reason that I     telegraphed to you so often not to let Siegel separate from you. I     anticipated that he would try to play you a trick by being absent at     the critical moment. I wished to forewarn you of the snare, but I     could not then give you my reasons. I am glad you prevented his     project and saved your army. I cannot describe to you how much     uneasiness I felt for you. You saved your army and won a glorious     victory by refusing to take his advice.  Captain Kinsman, of Company B, Fourth Iowa, who was holding Pea Ridge, and witnessed the battle from that point, and could look down upon Carr's Division, described the battle in the rear as follows:      At 8:30 o'clock Colonel Dodge opened the ball, and the battle was soon     raging all along the line with a fierceness and obstinacy which omened     a terrific struggle. The weather was splendid, and the smoke instead     of hanging murkily among the trees, rose rapidly and rolled away over     the hills in dense sulphurous masses. The thunder of the artillery was     terrific, and the shot and shell hissed and screamed through the air     like flying devils, while the infantry of both armies, with their     rifles, shot-guns, and muskets, kept a perfect hurricane of death     howling through the woods. The rebels fought well, but generally fired     too high, and their batteries, although getting our range accurately,     missed the elevation much of the time. Their poor shooting was our     salvation. Had they done as well as our men, with the tremendous odds     against us, they must have annihilated us. The enemy were clear around     our right flank, enveloping us, and it looked as though they would     capture Dodge's Brigade, when Colonel Dodge took a battalion of     Colonel Carr's regiment, the Third Illinois cavalry, and charged the     forces that were turning our right flank like a whirlwind. Everything     gave way before them. Every man in that battalion seemed to ride for     his life, and they swept way around our front, routing and     demoralizing that flank of the enemy, and effectually freeing our rear     and flank. Price told some of our boys of the Fourth Iowa who were     captured on the day of the fight and have since escaped, that we     fought more like devils than human beings. The rebel colonels (several     of them) inquired of our boys who those black-coated fellows were, and     who led them. They said there must have been at least 3,000 of them.     When the boys told them there were less than 600 of them, the Colonels     said they needn't tell them any such stuff as that; that they knew it     was a damned lie. But they sent their compliments to Colonel Dodge for     the bravery of himself and his command, and well they might, for     opposed to Colonel Dodge's Brigade of 1,050 men, and two guns of the     First Iowa Battery, were six regiments of Confederate troops, a large     force of Confederate Missouri State troops, and eighteen guns, and     many of these Confederate troops were the men who did the hard     fighting at the Wilson Creek battle. All day, from 8:30 in the morning     till 5:30 at night, Dodge's Brigade held its ground, dealing death     into the rebel ranks, and, when dark came, with ammunition expended,     the Fourth Iowa walked away from the field in good order, with the     sullen savage tread of men who might be driven by main strength, but     could not be conquered. Although this was one of the first battles of     the war, the Northern men showed their desperate fighting qualities;     and on the second day the South met and faced great slaughter.  Fayel, the correspondent of the Missouri Democrat, gives this account of the part Colonel Eugene A. Carr's Fourth Iowa Division took in the battle at Elk Horn Tavern:      Having given an account of the battle fought by Brigadier-General Jeff     C. Davis's Division, which occurred the same day, on our left, I will     now attempt to give some details of the Elk Horn Battle--the latter     having commenced early in the morning. First in order comes a     description of the locality near Elk Horn Tavern.      The house is on the Fayetteville and Springfield road, about four     miles north of Sugar Creek, between which two points our camp was     pitched, on the elevated ridge constituting the northern bank of the     creek. Leading north from the tavern, the road drops into the head of     the long gorge running towards Keetsville seven miles, known as the     \"Cross Timbers.\"      Into the strong fastness north of the Tavern the enemy had obtained a     lodgment from 10,000 to 15,000 strong in the rear of our wing, on the     morning of the 7th. His strength consisted in part of the following     rebel Divisions, as was subsequently ascertained: Frost's, Slack's,     Parson's, and Rains's; and the batteries of Ghebor, Clark (six     pieces), E. McDonald (three pieces), and Wade (four pieces). There was     present also one Regiment of Indians, the whole commanded by General     Van Dorn in person, and General Price, who directs the Missouri     forces.      Early in the morning, while General Curtis was in consultation with     his officers regarding a change of front, consequent on the approach     of the enemy on the west of us, news came that the enemy were in close     vicinity to the Elk Horn Tavern. The General then immediately ordered     Colonel Carr to proceed to effect a dislodgment of the enemy. The     formidable numbers present at the time not being known, Colonel Carr     directed Colonel Dodge, with the First Brigade of the Fourth Division,     to take a position near the Elkhorn Tavern, Colonel Carr accompanying     the expedition himself. The point indicated was about a mile and a     half distant from our camp, the ground being level and gradually     ascending, with open fields on either side of the road, interspersed     with an occasional belt of timber.      Colonel Dodge having discovered the enemy in the timber to the right,     opened the First Iowa Battery on them, causing considerable execution;     two rebels on horseback were seen to fall, and the rest fled. The     enemy having fled to the hollow, Colonel Dodge deployed his line,     covering as much ground as possible, the Thirty-fifth Illinois being     on his left. He sent forward a company of skirmishers from the Fourth     Iowa, who soon became sharply engaged with the enemy and the latter     opened on us a perfect tornado of round shot, shell, and grape. The     Thirty-fifth Illinois became engaged, fighting with determined     bravery, and about, this time Colonel Smith was wounded in the head by     a shell, which took off a part of his scalp. He also received a bullet     in his shoulder, and his horse was shot under him, all about the same     time. Just before he was wounded, several ammunition-chests exploded,     one after the other, wounding Captain Jones and Lieutenant Gamble, who     were standing near Colonel Carr, the latter making a fortunate escape.     The explosion of a caisson was terrific.      There was a short lull in the storm of leaden hail, during which time     the enemy advanced up the hollow through the brush, along the main     road, when Colonel Vandever, who had arrived, ordered forward the     infantry. A desperate conflict with small arms ensued. Back rolled the     tide of battle, the enemy being driven to the foot of the hill, when     he reopened the batteries. Our men fought like heroes; many fell     covered with wounds. The latter, when brought to the rear by their     comrades, encouraged those who were still breasting the fierce     cannonade, by hurrahing for the Union.      Colonel Vandever, in leading forward his brigade, had his horse hit     twice, and Colonel Phelps, in the van of his own Regiment, had three     horses shot under him. Major Geiger, of the same Regiment, and Captain     Hayden, of the Dubuque Battery, had two horses shot under them. Major     Coyle, of the Ninth Iowa, was wounded in the leg.      Colonel Dodge having discovered that the enemy were preparing for a     general attack, changed his front to the right, covering his men with     a log fence, thus compelling the enemy to cross an open field to reach     him. Our line was formed and we opened fire with one section of a     battery, the other pieces having left the field for want of     ammunition. The enemy advanced on our right, left, and center, under     cover of a destructive fire, poured in on our works under twelve     pieces of artillery. The fighting now lasted over two hours, during     which time we held our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30597"],["title","The Battle of Atlanta (#5)"],["body","n; only one Brigade contending against     at least six thousand rebel infantry and a heavy bombardment from     their artillery, the latter playing upon us at short range. Our men     fought like heroes without wincing under the galling fire belching     forth from behind trees and rocks, and much of the time from a     concealed foe. At one time we were reinforced by three rifled pieces     from a German battery, which fired four rounds, and then was compelled     to withdraw from the field, being flanked by a Regiment of the enemy.       Colonel Dodge, in order to discover the position of the enemy on his     right, directed his firing to cease, when a thousand rebel plush caps     and black broad brims popped up into view from the bushes, and,     forming, they advanced with great confidence to within one hundred     feet of our line. Our men were then ordered to pour in a fire on the     dastardly enemy, taking good aim. They were thrown into confusion by     our murderous volley and fled.      Their places were filled by a fresh Regiment, and Colonel Dodge,     finding that the enemy were outflanking him on the right and that his     force was too weak to permit an extension of his line, sent for and     soon received a reinforcement of five companies of the Eighth Indiana,     which were posted on the right. The firing now became terrific. The     enemy annoyed us severely by placing a battery on our left, which     completely enfiladed our line. The Fourth Iowa now getting short of     ammunition, and the Thirty-fifth Illinois having been forced to give     way on the left, it was at this critical time that Lieutenant-Colonel     Challenor was ordered to rally his men, who were hurled on the enemy,     driving his left back a short distance. Having advanced too far, the     Lieutenant-Colonel was surrounded and captured with forty of his men.     Our ammunition, as before stated, having given out, we fell back to     the open field, maintaining our line of battle in splendid order. The     enemy rushed forward with their batteries and entire force. The Fourth     Iowa halted, turned on them, and checked for a time their advance     until the last round of ammunition was exhausted. General Curtis     coming up about this stage of the action, was received with a round of     cheers from our boys. The General learning that the ammunition had     given out, ordered the Fourth Iowa to fix bayonets and charge on the     enemy. The men did so briskly, across the field, but found no enemy.      On Colonel Vandever's front the enemy now commenced swarming up the     road and along the gorge, and out of the brush in front of us. Our     troops fought them bravely, the officers exposing their persons in     leading in front of their men; but we were overwhelmed at this time by     superior numbers. We retreated across the field, but rallied again     along the fence behind our original position. Upon retiring as above     mentioned, reinforcements were seen coming up under General Asboth. In     a gallant attempt to resist the advancing column of the enemy, General     Asboth received a severe wound in the arm. After the terrible conflict     of the day our gallant troops bivouacked in front of the enemy,     awaiting the reopening of the conflict in the morning.      Colonel Vandever fought Little's Division. Colonel Dodge's Brigade     contended in the morning directly with Rain's and Clark's Divisions,     both immediately under the direction of Sterling Price. The latter had     his position for some time behind young Clarke's battery.      The enemy fired wagon-nuts, pieces of chain, marble, gravel, and all     sorts of projectiles. The overcoat worn by Colonel Dodge was perfectly     riddled by the jagged holes made by these unusual missiles.      Colonel Dodge, the day after the battle, received a letter from a     widow lady in Illinois, stating that she had three sons in the field     fighting for the Union; that her youngest son, who was in feeble     health, was in his Brigade, and she asked it as a special favor to her     in her loneliness to have him discharged. The young man whose mother     had such solicitude in his behalf was named Preston Green, and was     killed in the action of the 7th, near Elkhorn, while bravely     performing his duty.      During the battle, Colonel Dodge's horse was shot under him. An     enlisted man, detailed as clerk in the Adjutant's office, was acting     as orderly for Colonel Dodge. When his horse fell, he ordered the     orderly to dismount and give him his horse. The orderly said, \"You     will be killed if you get on another horse; this is the third you have     lost.\" But the orderly dismounted and stood where the Colonel had     stood when he asked for the horse, and at that moment was instantly     killed by a shot from the enemy. After the battle, the Adjutant,     Lieutenant Williamson, found in the orderly's desk a note in which he     said he was sure he would be killed in the battle, and in which, also,     he left directions as to the disposal of his effects and whom to write     to.  In General Price's command there was a Regiment or more of Indians commanded by Colonel Albert B. Pike. They crawled up through the thick timber and attacked my extreme left. I saw them and turned one of the guns of my battery on them, and they left. We saw no more of them, but they scalped and mutilated some of our dead. General Curtis entered a complaint to General Price, who answered that they were not of his command, and that they had scalped some of his dead, and he said he did not approve of their being upon the field. They evidently scalped many of the dead, no matter what side they belonged to.  The battle of Pea Ridge being one of the first of the war and one of unquestioned victory, had a great deal of attention called to it, and for months--in fact for years, and, I think even now--was considered to have been won by General Siegel. The proper credit was not given to General Curtis, while the history and records of the battle show that he was entitled to all of the credit, and fought the battle in opposition to Siegel's views. A statement of the losses shows what commands fought the battle. The total force engaged on our side, according to General Curtis's report, was 10,500 men, formed in four Divisions, Siegel's two Divisions being the largest, the Third and Fourth Divisions having less than 2,000 men each. The losses were:    First Division,* commanded by Osterhaus                 144   Second Division,* commanded by Asboth                   119   Third Division, commanded by Colonel Jeff C. Davis      329   Fourth Division, commanded by Colonel Carr              701         *Divisions were commanded by General Siegel.  Van Dorn's and Price's reports of the battle show how great their defeat was, and why it was, and while for some time General Curtis called anxiously on Halleck for more reinforcements, demanding that the column which was marching South in Kansas be sent to him, Van Dorn and Price, from the time they left the field, never stopped until they landed at Memphis, Tenn., their first movement being towards Pocahontas, with a view of attacking Pope in the rear, who was at New Madrid. Finding New Madrid captured, they turned their forces to Desarc, and were then transported by boats to Memphis. This relieved Missouri of any Confederate force in or near its border, and General Halleck immediately gave General Curtis orders to move on the flank of Van Dorn and keep up with him, but through that swampy, hilly country it was impossible for him to meet Van Dorn, and Curtis with his Army finally landed at Helena, Ark., and most of it joined the Vicksburg siege.  Captain Phil Sheridan was the Quartermaster and Commissary of General Curtis's Army. He kept us in flour, meat, and meal, and sometimes had my whole regiment detailed in running and protecting mills, driving cattle, etc. He had great difficulty in obtaining details, as at that early day a good many commanders, and especially General Siegel and his officers, did not think it the duty of a soldier to be detailed on anything but a soldier's duty; so Sheridan naturally came to me, as he was my Quartermaster while I commanded the post at Rolla, and when with the marching column he camped and tented with me. Sheridan and Curtis had considerable difficulty, and Curtis relieved him and ordered him to report to General Halleck, at St. Louis. We who knew Sheridan's ability, and the necessities of our Army, did all we could to hold him with us. He left us just before the Battle of Pea Ridge, and our Army saw a great difference after he was gone. He used to say to me, \"Dodge, if I could get into the line I believe I could do something;\" and his ambition was to get as high a rank as I then had and as large a command--a Colonel commanding a Brigade. In his memoirs he pays the Fourth Iowa a great compliment, and says they will have a warm place in his heart during his life.  During the Battle of Pea Ridge Sheridan was at Springfield, Mo., preparing to turn over his property to the officer who was to relieve him, and he there showed his soldierly qualities. The dispatches from Curtis's army had to be relayed at Springfield. The first dispatches after the battle were sent all in praise of General Siegel, and by portions of his command, claiming he had won the battle. Sheridan, knowing this to be untrue, withheld the Siegel dispatches until the telegrams from General Curtis to General Halleck were received, and sent them forward first, notwithstanding the fact that he felt he had been unjustly treated by General Curtis.  This Army had no water or rail communication. It was 300 miles from its nearest supply-depot, and therefore it had to live off of a country that was sparsely settled by poor people; but Sheridan showed that dominant combination of enterprise and energy, by running every mill and using every means"]]]
