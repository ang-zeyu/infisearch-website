But if it should, you will have had a rather startling experience! You will have seen a thing generally considered to be impossible!\"  He smile reassuringly, stepping down from the lectern. \"Naturally, there will be no danger. You know me well enough to realize that I never permit the group or individuals to attempt what lies beyond their capability.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cavender stifled a yawn, blinked water from his eyes, watching Ormond walk over to a small polished table on the left side of the room in front of the rows of chairs. On it Mavis Greenfield had placed a number of enigmatic articles, some of which would be employed as props in one manner or another during the evening's work. The most prominent item was a small suitcase in red alligator hide. Dr. Ormond, however, passed up the suitcase, took a small flat wooden plate from the table and returned to the center of the room.  \"On this,\" he said, holding up the plate, \"there rests at this moment the air of this planet and nothing else. But in a minute or two--for each of you, in his or her world of subjective reality--something else _will_ appear on it.\"  The students nodded comprehendingly. So far, the experiment was on familiar ground. Dr. Ormond gave them all a good-humored wink.  \"To emphasize,\" he went on, \"that we deal here with practical, down-to-earth, _real_ matters ... not some mystical nonsense ... to emphasize that, let us say that the object each of you will visualize on this plate will be--a ham sandwich!\"  There were appreciative chuckles. But Cavender felt a twinge of annoyance. At the moment, when along with fighting off fatigue he'd been trying to forget that he hadn't eaten since noon, Dr. Al's choice looked like an unfortunate one. Cavender happened to be very fond of ham.  \"Now here,\" Ormond continued, putting the plate down, \"is where this experiment begins to differ from anything we have done before. For all of us will try to imagine--to visualize as being on this plate--_the same ham sandwich_. And so there will be no conflict in our projections, let's decide first on just what ingredients we want to put on it.\" He smiled. \"We'll make this the finest ham sandwich our collective imagination can produce!\"  There were more chuckles. Cavender cursed under his breath, his mouth beginning to water. Suggestions came promptly.  \"Mustard?\" Dr. Ormond said, \"Of course--Not too sharp though, Eleanor?\" He smiled at Mrs. Folsom. \"I agree! A light touch of delicate salad mustard. Crisp lettuce ... finely chopped gherkins. Very well!\"  \"Put it all on rye,\" Cavender said helplessly. \"Toasted rye.\"  \"Toasted rye?\" Ormond smiled at him, looked around. \"Any objections? No? Toasted rye it shall be, Wally. And I believe that completes our selection.\"  He paused, his face turning serious. \"Now as to that word of caution I gave you. For three minutes each of you will visualize the object we have chosen on the plate I will be holding up before me. You will do this with your eyes open, and to each of you, in your own subjective reality, the object will become, as you know, more or less clearly discernible.  \"But let me tell you this. Do not be too surprised if at the end of that time, when the exercise is over, the object _remains visible to_ you ... does not disappear!\"  There was silence for a moment. Then renewed chuckles, but slightly nervous ones, and not too many.  Dr. Ormond said sternly, \"I am serious about that! The possibility, though it may be small tonight, is there. You have learned that, by the laws of Insight, any image of subjective reality, if it can be endowed with _all_ the attributes of objective reality by its human creator, _must_ spontaneously become an image in objective reality!  \"In this case, our collective ham sandwich, if it were perfectly visualized, could not only be seen by you but felt, its weight and the texture of each of its ingredients perceived, their appetizing fragrance savored\"--Cavender groaned mentally--\"and more: if one of you were to eat this sandwich, he would find it exactly as nourishing as any produced by the more ordinary methods of objective reality.  \"There are people in the world today,\" Dr. Ormond concluded, speaking very earnestly now, \"who can do this! There always have been people who could do this. And you are following in their footsteps, being trained in even more advanced skills. I am aware to a greater extent than any of you of the latent power that is developing--has developed--in this group. Tonight, for the first time, that power will be focused, drawn down to a pinpoint, to accomplish one task.  \"Again, I do not say that at the end of our exercise a ham sandwich will lie on this plate. Frankly, I don't expect it. But I suggest very strongly that you don't let it surprise or startle you too much if we find it here!\"  There was dead stillness when he finished speaking. Cavender had a sense that the lecture room had come alive with eerie little chills. Dr. Ormond lifted the plate solemnly up before him, holding it between the fingertips of both hands.  \"Now, if you will direct your attention here ... no, Eleanor, with your eyes open!  \"Let us begin....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cavender sighed, straightened up in his chair, eyes fixed obediently on the wooden plate, and banned ham sandwiches and every other kind of food firmly from his thoughts. There was no point in working his appetite up any further when he couldn't satisfy it, and he would have to be on guard a little against simply falling asleep during the next three minutes. The cloudiness of complete fatigue wasn't too far away. At the edge of his vision, he was aware of his fellow students across the room, arranged in suddenly motionless rows like staring zombies. His eyelids began to feel leaden.  The three minutes dragged on, came to an end. Ormond slowly lowered his hands. Cavender drew a long breath of relief. The wooden plate, he noted, with no surprise, was still empty.  \"You may stop visualizing,\" Ormond announced.  There was a concerted sighing, a creaking of chairs. The students came out of their semitrances, blinked, smiled, settled into more comfortable positions, waiting for Dr. Al's comments.  \"No miracles this time!\" Ormond began briskly. He smiled.  Mrs. Folsom said, \"Dr. Al--\"  He looked over at her. \"Yes, Eleanor?\"  Eleanor Folsom hesitated, shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"Go on. I'm sorry I interrupted.\"  \"That's all right.\" Dr. Al gave her a warm smile. It had been, he continued, a successful exercise, a very promising first attempt, in spite of the lack of an immediate materialization, which, of course, had been only a remote possibility to start with. He had no fault to find with the quality of the group's effort. He had sensed it ... as they, too, presently would be able to sense it ... as a smooth flow of directed energy. With a little more practice ... one of these days ...  Cavender stifled one yawn, concealed another which didn't allow itself to be stifled behind a casually raised hand. He watched Ormond move over to the prop table, put the wooden plate down beside the red suitcase without interrupting his encouraging summary of the exercise, hesitate, then pick up something else, something which looked like a flexible copper trident, and start back to the center of the room with it.  Mrs. Folsom's voice said shrilly, \"_Dr. Al--!_\"  \"Yes, Eleanor? What is it?\"  \"Just now,\" Mrs. Folsom said, her voice still holding the shrill note, \"just a moment ago, on the plate over there, I'm certain ... I'm almost certain I saw the ham sandwich!\"  She added breathlessly, \"And that's what I was going to say before, Dr. Al! Right after you told us to stop visualizing I thought I saw the sandwich on the plate! But it was only for a moment and I wasn't sure. But now I'm sure, almost sure, that I saw it again on the plate on the table!\"  The old woman was pointing a trembling finger towards the table. Her cheeks showed spots of hectic red. In the rows behind her, the students looked at one another, shook their heads in resignation, some obviously suppressing amusement. Others looked annoyed. They were all familiar with Eleanor Folsom's tendency to produce such little sensations during the meetings. If the evening didn't promise to bring enough excitement, Eleanor always could be counted on to take a hand in events.  Cavender felt less certain about it. This time, Mrs. Folsom sounded genuinely excited. And if she actually believed she'd seen something materialize, she might be fairly close to getting one of those little heart attacks she kept everyone informed about.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Al could have had the same thought. He glanced back at the prop table, asked gravely, \"You don't see it there now, do you, Eleanor?\"  Mrs. Folsom shook her head. \"No. No, of course not! It disappeared again. It was only there for a second. But I'm sure I saw it!\"  \"Now this is very interesting,\" Ormond said seriously. \"Has anyone else observed anything at all unusual during the last few minutes?\"  There was a murmured chorus of dissent, but Cavender noticed that the expressions of amusement and annoyance had vanished. Dr. Al had changed the tune, and the students were listening intently. He turned back to Mrs. Folsom.  \"Let us consider the possibilities here, Eleanor,\" he said. \"For one thing, you should be congratulated in any case, because your experience shows that your visualization was clear and true throughout our exercise. If it hadn't been, nothing like this could have occurred.  \"But precisely what was the experience? There we are, as of this moment, on uncertain ground. You saw something. That no one else saw the same thing might mean simply that no one else happened to be looking at the plate at those particular instances in time. I, for example, certainly gave it no further attention after the exercise was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30764"],["title","Ham Sandwich (#2)"],["body","over. You _may_ then have observed a genuine materialization!\"  Mrs. Folsom nodded vigorously. \"Yes, I--\"  \"But,\" Ormond went on, \"under the circumstances, the scientific attitude we maintain at this Institute demands that we leave the question open. For now. Because you might also, you understand, have projected--for yourself only--a vivid momentary impression of the image you had created during our exercise and were still holding in your mind.\"  Mrs. Folsom looked doubtful. The flush of excitement began to leave her face.  \"Why ... well, yes, I suppose so,\" she acknowledged unwillingly.  \"Of course,\" Ormond said. \"So tonight we shall leave it at that. The next time we engage in a similar exercise ... well, who knows?\" He gave her a reassuring smile. \"I must say, Eleanor, that this is a very encouraging indication of the progress you have made!\" He glanced over the group, gathering their attention, and raised the trident-like device he had taken from the table.  \"And now for our second experiment this evening--\"  Looking disappointed and somewhat confused, Eleanor Folsom settled back in her chair. Cavender also settled back, his gaze shifting sleepily to the remaining items on the prop table. He was frowning a little. It wasn't his business, but if the old woman had started to hypnotize herself into having hallucinations, Dr. Al had better turn to a different type of meeting exercises. And that probably was exactly what Ormond would do; he seemed very much aware of danger signals. Cavender wondered vaguely what the red suitcase on the table contained.  There was a blurry shimmer on the wooden plate beside the suitcase. Then something thickened there suddenly as if drawing itself together out of the air. Perrie Rochelle, sitting only ten feet back from the table, uttered a yelp--somewhere between surprise and alarm. Dexter Jones, beside her, abruptly pushed back his chair, made a loud, incoherent exclamation of some kind.  Cavender had started upright, heart hammering. The thing that had appeared on the wooden plate vanished again.  But it had remained visible there for a two full seconds. And there was no question at all of what it had been.  For several minutes, something resembling pandemonium swirled about the walls of the lecture room of the Institute of Insight. The red suitcase had concealed the wooden plate on the prop table from the eyes of most of the students sitting on the right side of the room, but a number of those who could see it felt they had caught a glimpse of something. Of just what they weren't sure at first, or perhaps they preferred not to say.  Perrie and Dexter, however, after getting over their first shock, had no such doubts. Perrie, voice vibrant with excitement, answered the questions flung at her from across the room, giving a detailed description of the ham sandwich which had appeared out of nowhere on the polished little table and stayed there for an incredible instant before it vanished. Dexter Jones, his usually impassive face glowing and animated, laughing, confirmed the description on every point.  On the opposite side of the room, Eleanor Folsom, surrounded by her own group of questioners, was also having her hour of triumph, in the warmth of which a trace of bitterness that her first report of the phenomenon had been shrugged off by everyone--even, in a way, by Dr. Al--gradually dissolved.  Dr. Al himself, Cavender thought, remained remarkably quiet at first, though in the excitement this wasn't generally noticed. He might even have turned a little pale. However, before things began to slow down he had himself well in hand again. Calling the group to a semblance of order, he began smilingly to ask specific questions. The witnesses on the right side of the room seemed somewhat more certain now of what they had observed.  Dr. Ormond looked over at Cavender.  \"And you, Wally?\" he asked. \"You were sitting rather far back, to be sure--\"  Cavender smiled and shrugged.  \"Sorry, Dr. Al. I just wasn't looking in that direction at the moment. The first suggestion I had that anything unusual was going on was when Perrie let out that wild squawk.\"  There was general laughter. Perrie grinned and flushed.  \"Well, I'd have liked to hear _your_ squawk,\" she told Cavender, \"if you'd seen a miracle happen right before your nose!\"  \"Not a miracle, Perrie,\" Ormond said gently. \"We must remember that. We are working here with natural forces which produce natural phenomena. Insufficiently understood phenomena, perhaps, but never miraculous ones. Now, how closely did this materialization appear to conform to the subjective group image we had decided on for our exercise?\"  \"Well, I could only see it, of course, Dr. Al. But as far as I saw it, it was exactly what we'd ... no, wait!\" Perrie frowned, wrinkling her nose. \"There was something added!\" She giggled. \"At least, I don't remember anyone saying we should imagine the sandwich wrapped in a paper napkin!\"  Across the room, a woman's voice said breathlessly, \"Oh! A _green_ paper napkin, Perrie?\"  Perrie looked around, surprised. \"Yes, it was, Mavis.\"  Mavis Greenfield hesitated, said with a nervous little laugh, \"I suppose I did that. I added a green napkin after we started the exercise.\" Her voice quavered for an instant. \"I thought the image looked neater that way.\" She looked appealingly at the students around her. \"This is really incredible, isn't it.\"  They gave her vague smiles. They were plainly still floating on a cloud of collective achievement--if they hadn't created that sandwich, there could have been nothing to see!  It seemed to Cavender that Dr. Ormond's face showed a flicker of strain when he heard Mavis' explanation. But he couldn't be sure because the expression--if it had been there--was smoothed away at once. Ormond cleared his throat, said firmly and somewhat chidingly. \"No, not incredible, Mavis! Although--\"  He turned on his smile. \"My friends, I must admit that you _have_ surprised me! Very pleasantly, of course. But what happened here is something I considered to be only a very remote possibility tonight. You are truly more advanced than I'd realized.  \"For note this. If even one of you had been lagging behind the others, if there had been any unevenness in the concentration each gave to the exercise tonight, this materialization simply could not have occurred! And that fact forces me now to a very important decision.\"  He went over to the prop table, took the suitcase from it. \"Mavis,\" he said gravely, \"you may put away these other devices. We will have no further need for them in this group! Dexter, move the table to the center of the room for me, please.\"  He waited while his instructions were hastily carried out, then laid the suitcase on the table, drew up a chair and sat down. The buzz of excited conversation among the students hushed. They stared at him in anticipatory silence. It appeared that the evening's surprises were not yet over--and they were ready for _anything_ now!         *       *       *       *       *  \"There is a point,\" Dr. Ormond began in a solemn voice, riveting their eager attention on him, \"a point in the orderly advance towards Total Insight at which further progress becomes greatly simplified and accelerated, because the student has now developed the capability to augment his personal efforts by the use of certain instruments.\"  Cavender thoughtfully reached inside his coat, brought out a cigarette case, opened it and slowly put a cigarette to his lips. About to flick on a lighter, he saw Ruben Jeffries watching him with an expression of disapproval from across the aisle. Jeffries shook his head, indicated the NO SMOKING sign on the wall. Cavender nodded, smiling a rueful apology for his absent-mindedness, and returned the cigarette to its case. He shoved his hands into his trousers pockets, slouched back in the chair.  \"I have told you,\" Ormond was saying, \"that the contributions many of you so generously made to the Institute were needed for and being absorbed by vital research. Tonight I had intended to give you a first inkling of what that research was accomplishing.\" He tapped the suitcase on the table before him. \"In there is an instrument of the kind I have mentioned. The beneficial forces of the Cosmos are harnessed by it, flow through it. And I believe I can say that my efforts in recent months have produces the most effective such device ever seen....\"  \"Dr. Al,\" Mrs. Folsom interrupted firmly, \"I think you should let them know how the instrument cured my heart condition.\"  Faces shifted toward her, then back to Dr. Al. The middle-aged majority of the students pricked their ears. For each of them, conscious of the years of increasingly uncertain health to come, Mrs. Folsom's words contained a personal implication, one that hit home. But in spite of the vindication of her claim to have seen a materialized ham sandwich, they weren't quite ready to trust her about this.  Dr. Ormond's face was grave.  \"Eleanor,\" he said reprovingly, \"that was letting the cat out of the bag, wasn't it? I hadn't intended to discuss that part of the matter just yet.\"  He hesitated, frowning, tapping the table top lightly with his knuckles. Mrs. Folsom looked unabashed. She had produced another sensation and knew it.  \"Since it was mentioned,\" Ormond said with deliberation at last, \"it would be unfair not to tell you, at least in brief, the facts to which Eleanor was alluding. Very well then--Eleanor has served during the past several weeks as the subject of certain experiments connected with this instrument. She reports that after her first use of it, her periodically recurring heart problem ceased to trouble her.\"  Mrs. Folsom smiled, nodded vigorously. \"I have not,\" she announced, \"had one single touch of pain or dizziness in all this time!\"  \"But one should, of course,\" Dr. Ormond added objectively, \"hesitate to use the word 'cure' under such circumstances.\"  In the front row someone asked, \"Dr. Al,"]]]
