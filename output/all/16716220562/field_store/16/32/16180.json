The door slid open, and Geoffrey found himself staring at the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.  She was lithe almost to the point of boyishness, even though she was clearly some years older than Geoffrey. She had short hair the color of hammered copper, high cheekbones, and tawny eyes. She was wearing a tunic and short trousers, and there was an empty pistol holster strapped around her waist. Obviously, she was not a lady. But it was much too late for Geoffrey to care about that. She stopped in the doorway, shaking her head slowly at The Barbarian. \"I swear, Hodd,\" she said in a low, laughing voice, \"one of these days you _won't_ come back from the dead, and I'll be surprised.\"  \"It was close enough, this time,\" The Barbarian growled. He jerked his head toward Geoffrey. \"That young buck over there knows how to handle his enemies. Once he learns what to do about his friends, I may have to retire.\"  Myka arched her burning eyebrows. \"Oh? What's the story behind that, I'd like to know.\"  \"We can always talk,\" Geoffrey said a little edgily. \"But we can't always find an empty tankette.\"  \"Quite right, lad,\" The Barbarian said. \"I saw some vehicles parked over that way.\"  \"Those belong to the nobles. There ought to be some captured ones of yours somewhere around here.\"  \"With plenty of guards on them. No, thanks.\"  \"That didn't trouble you earlier.\"  \"Myka, as you may have noticed, is more than a tank. This time the prize isn't worth it. I'd rather just slip over to where I can get transportation for the choosing.\"  \"Not with my help.\"  The Barbarian looked at him and grunted. He seemed oddly disappointed. \"I would have bet the other way,\" he muttered. Then the shaggy head rose, and he circled Myka's waist with one arm. \"All right, I'll do it without your help.\"  \"Is Myka trained to drive a tankette and fight at the same time?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then you'd better do it my way. You'd make a poor showing, kicking drive levers with a broken leg.\" Geoffrey nodded toward The Barbarian's right shin. \"It's been that way since before you picked me up, hasn't it? I saw it wobble when you kneed that man-at-arms.\"  Myka looked at The Barbarian sharply, worry on her face, but the man was chuckling. \"All right, bucko, we'll do it your way.\"  \"Fine.\" Geoffrey wasn't so sure it was. Suddenly he was committed not only to helping The Barbarian escape, but also to escape with him. He was faintly surprised at himself. But there was something about the man. Something worth saving, no matter what. And there was the business now of having been recognized. Once Dugald learned he was still alive, there would be a considerable amount of danger in staying in the vicinity. Of course, he had only to stoop over the unconscious guard with The Barbarian's knife....  With a quick motion, he tossed the weapon back to its owner.  _That_ one was an easy choice, Geoffrey thought. Simply stealing--or was it recapturing?--a tankette and using it to drive away with Myka and The Barbarian didn't mean he had to go all the way to the barbarian lands with them. Let the guard revive and run to Dugald with the news. All Geoffrey had to do was to remove himself a few miles, find shelter, and bide his time.  One recaptured barbarian tankette might not even be missed. And the guard might not be believed--well, that was a thin hope--but, in any case, no one had any reason to suspect The Barbarian was still alive. There'd be no general pursuit.  Well ... maybe not. There was a man-at-arms choked to death, by a stronger arm than Geoffrey's, and it was The Barbarian's woman who would be missing. There might be quite a buzz about that.  Geoffrey shook his head in impatient annoyance. This kind of life demanded a great deal more thinking than he was accustomed to. All these unpredictable factors made a man's head spin.  And then again, maybe they didn't. The thing to do was to act, to do what would get him out of here now, and leave him free tomorrow to do whatever thinking tomorrow demanded. With a little practice, too, thinking would undoubtedly come more easily.  \"All right,\" he said decisively, \"let's get moving over in that direction, and see if the guards haven't gotten a little careless.\" He motioned to Myka and The Barbarian, and began to lead the way into the underbrush. He thrust out a hand to pull a sapling aside, and almost ran full-tilt into Harolde Dugald.         *       *       *  Dugald was almost exactly Geoffrey's age and size, but he had something Geoffrey lacked--a thin-lipped look of wolfish wisdom. His dark eyes were habitually slitted, and his mouth oddly off-center, always poised between a mirthless grin and a snarl. His long black hair curled under at the base of his skull, and his hands were covered with heavy gold and silver rings. There was one for each finger and thumb, and all of them were set with knobby precious stones.  His lips parted now, and his long white teeth showed plainly in the semi-darkness. \"I was coming back to inspect my prizes,\" he said in a voice like a fine-bladed saw chuckling through soft metal. \"And look what I've found.\" The open mouth of his heavy, handmade side pistol pointed steadily between Geoffrey's eyes. \"I find my erstwhile neighbor risen from the dead, and in the company of a crippled enemy and his leman. Indeed, my day is complete.\"  The one thing Geoffrey was not feeling was fear. The wire-thin strand of his accumulated rage was stretched to breaking. Somewhere, far from the forefront of his mind, he was feeling surprise and disappointment. He was perfectly aware of Dugald's weapon, and of what it would do to his head at this range. But Geoffrey was not stopping to think. And Dugald was a bit closer to him than he ought to have been.  Geoffrey's hands seemed to leap out. One tore the pistol out of Dugald's hand and knocked it spinning. The other cracked, open-palmed, against the other man's face, hard enough to split flesh and start the blood trickling down Dugald's cheek. The force of the combined blows sent Dugald staggering. He fell back, crashing into a bush, and hung against it. Stark fear shone in his eyes. He screamed: \"Dugald! _Dugald!_ To me! To me!\"  For a second, everything went silent; nobles quarreling, guards roistering among the captures--suddenly the battlefield was still. Then the reaction to the rallying cry set off an entirely different kind of hubbub. The sound now was that of an alerted pack of dogs.  Once more, Geoffrey swept his hand across Dugald's face, feeling his own skin break over the knuckles. But there was no time for anything else. Now they had to run, and not in silence. Now everything went by the board, and the nearest safety was the best. Behind them as they tore through the brush, they could hear Dugald shouting:  \"That way! The Barbarian's with him!\" The Barbarian was grunting with every step. Myka was panting. Geoffrey was in the lead, his throat burning with every breath, not knowing where he was leading them, but trying to skirt around the pack of nobles that would be running toward them in the darkness.  He crashed against plated metal. He peered at it in the absolute darkness this far from the fires and torches. \"Tankette!\" he said hoarsely. \"Empty.\" They scrambled onto it, Geoffrey pulling at The Barbarian's arm. \"Down, Myka--inside. Ought to be room between steering posts and motor.\" He pushed the woman down through the hatch, and dropped back to the ground. He ran to the crank clipped to one track housing and thrust it into place. \"You--you'll have to hang onto--turret,\" he panted to The Barbarian. \"Help me start.\" He wound furiously at the starting crank until he felt the flywheel spin free of the ratchet, and then engaged the driveshaft. The tankette shuddered to the sudden torque. The motor resisted, turned its shaft reluctantly, spun the magneto, ignited, stuttered, coughed, and began to roar. The headlights flickered yellowly, glowed up to brightness as the engine built up revolutions. The Barbarian, clinging to the turret with one arm, pushed the choke control back to halfway and advanced the spark. Geoffrey scrambled up the sharply pitched rear deck, clawing for handholds on the radiator tubing, and dropped into the turret seat. He took the controls, kicked at the left side track control without caring, for the moment, whether Myka was in the way or not, spun the tankette halfway round, and pulled the throttle out as far as it would go. Its engine clamoring, its rigid tracks transmitting every shock and battering them, the tankette flogged forward through the brush. There was gunfire booming behind them, and there were other motors sputtering into life.  There was no one among the nobles to drive as well as Geoffrey could--certainly no one who could keep up with him at night, in country he knew. He could probably depend on that much.  He lit the carbide lamp over the panel.  Geoffrey looked at the crest worked into the metal, and laughed. He had even managed to steal Dugald's tankette.         *       *       *       *       *  By morning, they were a good fifty miles away from where the battle had been fought. They were almost as far as the Delaware River, and the ground was broken into low hills, each a little higher than the last. Geoffrey had only been this far away from his home a few times, before his father's death, and then never in this direction. Civilization was not considered to extend this far inland. When a young man went on his travels, preparatory for the day when he inherited his father's holdings and settled down to maintain them, he went along the coast, perhaps as far as Philadelphia or Hartford.  Geoffrey had always"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30828"],["title","The Barbarians (#3)"],["body","a lively interest in strange surroundings. He had regretted the day his journeyings came to an end--not that he hadn't regretted his father's passing even more. Now, as dawn came up behind them, he could not help turning his head from side to side and looking at the strangely humped land, seeing for the first time a horizon which was not flat. He found himself intrigued by the thought that he had no way of knowing what lay beyond the next hill--that he would have to travel, and keep traveling, to satisfy a perpetually renewed curiosity.  All this occupied one part of his mind. Simultaneously, he wondered how much farther they'd travel in this vehicle. The huge sixteen-cylinder in-line engine was by now delivering about one-fourth of its rated fifty horsepower, with a good half of its spark plugs hopelessly fouled and the carburetor choked by the dust of yesterday's battle.  They were very low on shot and powder charges for the two-pounder turret cannon, as well. The tankette had of course never been serviced after the battle. There was one good thing--neither had their pursuers'. Looking back, Geoffrey could see no sign of them. But he could also see the plain imprint of the tankette's steel cleats stretched out behind them in a betraying line. The rigid, unsprung track left its mark on hard stone as easily as it did in soft earth. The wonder was that the tracks had not quite worn themselves out as yet, though all the rivets were badly strained and the tankette sounded like a barrel of stones tumbling downhill.  The Barbarian had spent the night with one arm thrown over the cannon barrel and the fingers of his other hand hooked over the edge of the turret hatch. In spite of the tankette's vicious jouncing, he had not moved or changed his position. Now he raised one hand to comb the shaggy hair away from his forehead, and there were faint bloody marks on the hatch.  \"How much farther until we're over the mountains?\" Geoffrey asked him.  \"Over the--lad, we haven't even come to the beginning of them yet.\"  Geoffrey grimaced. \"Then we'll never make it. Not in this vehicle.\"  \"I didn't expect to. We'll walk until we reach the pass. I've got a support camp set up there.\"  \"Walk? This is impossible country for people on foot. There are intransigent tribesmen all through this territory.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"How do I _know_? Why, everybody knows about them!\"  The Barbarian looked at him thoughtfully, and with just the faintest trace of amusement. \"Well, if _everybody_ knows they're intransigent, I guess they are. I guess we'll just have to hope they don't spot us.\"  Geoffrey was a little nettled by The Barbarian's manner. It wasn't, after all, as if anybody claimed there were dragons or monsters or any other such oceanic thing living here. This was good, solid fact--people had actually come up here, tried to bring civilization to the tribes, and failed completely. They were, by all reports, hairy, dirty people equipped with accurate rifles. No one had bothered to press the issue, because obviously it was hardly worth it. Geoffrey had expected to have trouble with them--but he had expected to meet it in an armored vehicle. But now that the mountains had turned out to be so far away, the situation might grow quite serious. And The Barbarian didn't seem to care very much.  \"Well, now, lad,\" he was saying, \"if the tribesmen're that bad, maybe your friends the nobles won't dare follow us up here.\"  \"They'll follow us,\" Geoffrey answered flatly. \"I slapped Dugald's face.\"  \"Oh. Oh, I didn't understand that. Code of honor--that sort of thing. All the civilized appurtenances.\"  \"It's hardly funny.\"  \"No, I suppose not. I don't suppose it occurred to you to kill him on the spot?\"  \"Kill a _noble_ in hot blood?\"  \"Sorry. Code of honor again. Forget I mentioned it.\"  Geoffrey rankled under The Barbarian's barely concealed amusement. To avoid any more of this kind of thing, he pointedly turned and looked at the terrain behind them--something he ought to have done a little earlier. Three tankettes were in sight, only a few miles behind them, laboring down the slope of a hill.  And at that moment, as though rivetted iron had a dramatic sense of its own, their tankette coughed, spun lazily on one track as the crankshaft paused with a cam squarely between positions, and burned up the last drops of oil and alcohol in its fuel tank.         *       *       *  Geoffrey and Myka crouched down in a brushy hollow. The Barbarian had crawled up to the lip of the depression, and was peering through a clump of weeds at the oncoming trio. \"That seems to be all of them,\" he said with a turn of his head. \"It's possible they kept their speed down and nursed themselves along to save fuel. They might even have a fuel waggon coming up behind them. That's the way I'd do it. It would mean these three are all we can expect for a few hours, anyway, but that they'll be heavily reinforced some time later.\"  \"That will hardly matter,\" Geoffrey muttered. Myka had found Dugald's personal rifle inside the tankette. Geoffrey was rolling cartridges quickly and expertly, using torn up charges from the turret cannon. He had made the choice between a round or two for the now immobile heavy weapon and a plentiful supply for the rifle, and would have been greatly surprised at anyone's choosing differently. The Barbarian had not even questioned it, and Myka was skillfully casting bullets with the help of the hissing alcohol stove and the bullet mold included in the rifle kit. There was plenty of finely ground priming powder, and even though Geoffrey was neither weighing the charges of cannon powder nor measuring the diameter of the cartridges he was rolling, no young noble of any pretensions whatsoever could not have done the same.  The rub lay in the fact that none of this was liable to do them much good. If they were to flee through the woods, there would certainly be time for only a shot or two when the tribesmen found them. If the rifle was to be used against the three nobles, then it was necessary, in all decency, to wait until the nobles had stopped, climbed out of their tankettes, equipped themselves equally, and a mutual ground of battle had been agreed upon. In that case, three against one would make short work of it.  The better chance lay with the woods and the tribesmen. It was the better chance, but Geoffrey did not relish it. He scowled as he dropped a primer charge down the rifle's barrel, followed it with a cartridge, took a cooled bullet from Myka, and tamped it down with the ramrod until it was firmly gripped by the collar on the cartridge. He took a square of clean flannel from its compartment in the butt and carefully wiped the lenses of the telescopic sight.  \"Can I stop now?\" Myka asked.  Geoffrey looked at her sharply. It had never occurred to him that the woman might simply be humoring him, and yet that was the tone her voice had taken. Truth to tell, he had simply handed her the stove, pig lead, and mold, and told her to go to work.  He looked at her now, remembering that he'd been hurried and possibly brusque. It ought not to matter--though it did--since she was hardly a lady entitled to courtesy. She hardly looked like anything, after hours crouched inside the tankette.  Her copper hair was smeared with grease, disarranged, and even singed where she had presumably leaned against a hot fitting. Her clothes were indescribably dirty and limp with perspiration. She was quite pale, and seemed to be fighting nausea--hardly surprising, with the exhaust fumes that must have been present in the compartment.  Nevertheless, her hair glinted where the sun struck it, and her litheness was only accented by the wrinkled clothing. Over-accented, Geoffrey thought to himself as he looked at the length of limb revealed by her short trousers.  He flushed. \"Of course. Thank you.\" He looked at the pile of finished bullets. There were enough of them to stand off an army, provided only the army did not shift about behind rocks and trees as the tribesmen did, or was not equally armed, as the nobles would be. Yet, a man had to try to the end. \"You don't expect this to do much good,\" he said to the woman.  Myka grinned at him. \"Do you?\"  \"No, frankly. But why did you help me?\"  \"To keep you busy.\"  \"I see.\" He didn't. He scooped the bullets up, put them in one pocket, and dropped the cartridges in another. He stood up.  \"There wasn't any point in letting you get nervous,\" Myka explained. \"You can be quite a deadly boy in action, if what I've seen and heard about you is any indication. I didn't want you killing any of our friends.\" She was smiling at him without any malice whatsoever; rather, with a definite degree of fondness. Geoffrey did not even feel resentful at this business of being casually managed, as though he were liable to do something foolish.  But he scrambled up to a place beside The Barbarian in a burst of tense movement, and looked out toward the approaching tankettes. What Myka had just said to him, and the cryptic smile on The Barbarian's face, and a thought of Geoffrey's own, had all fitted themselves together in his mind.  There was no reason, really, to believe that barbarians would be hostile to barbarians, and certainly the inland raiders could not have returned year after year without _some_ means of handling the mountain tribes. Friendship, or at least an alliance, would be the easiest way.  And out on the slope of the nearest hill, bearded men in homespun clothing were rolling boulders down on the advancing tankettes.  The slope of the hill was quite steep, and the boulders were massive. They tumbled and bounded with a speed that must have seemed terrifying from below. Tearing great chunks out of the earth, they rumbled down on the tankettes while the tribesmen yelled with bloodcurdling ferocity and fired on the tankettes with impossible rapidity. With respectable marksmanship, too. The nobles were swerving their vehicles frantically"]]]
