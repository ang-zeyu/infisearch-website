(BOB) SANDERS, STATE PRINTER TOPEKA, KANSAS 1968  32-3687     The Genera of Phyllomedusine Frogs (Anura: Hylidae)  BY  WILLIAM E. DUELLMAN   One of the most distinctive phyletic lines among the diverse Neotropical hylid frogs is composed of a group of 40 species placed in the genus _Phyllomedusa_ (Funkhouser, 1957) or in two or three different genera (Goin, 1961; Lutz, 1966). These species differ from all other Neotropical hylids by possessing a vertical, instead of horizontal, pupil. The only other hylids having a vertical pupil belong to the Papuan genus _Nyctimystes_. Goin (1961) erroneously stated that _Nyctimantis_ and _Triprion_ have vertical pupils.  Although limited information is available on the cytotaxonomy of hylids, the data show that phyllomedusine species have _n_=13 (2_n_=26) chromosomes. _Acris_ has _n_=11 (2_n_=22) (Cole, 1966). Members of the _Hyla leucophyllata_, _microcephala_, and _parviceps_ groups have _n_=15 (2_n_=30), _Gastrotheca ceratophrys_ has a haploid number of 14, the Papuan hylid genus _Nyctimystes_ and all but one of the Australo-Papuan _Hyla_ for which the numbers are known have a haploid number of 13, and all other New World hylids studied have _n_=12 (2_n_=24) (Duellman and Cole, 1965; Duellman, 1967).  Cei (1963) and Cei and Erspamer (1966) noted that phyllomedusine frogs differ notably from other Neotropical hylids on the basis of the amines and polypeptides in the skin. All species of phyllomedusines deposit their eggs in a gelatinous mass on leaves or branches above water. Although this type of egg deposition is characteristic of some rhacophorines and apparently all centrolenids, it is known among hylids only in the phyllomedusines and in two species of _Hyla_.  The distinctive combination of morphological, physiological, chromosomal, and behavioral characteristics is strongly suggestive that these frogs represent an early phyletic divergence within the Hylidae. Günther (1859) proposed the familial name Phyllomedusidae for _Phyllomedusa bicolor_ (Boddaert). I suggest the recognition of the group as a subfamily. The following classification of the phyllomedusines is based on my own knowledge of the Middle American and some South American species and on evidence from the literature on those South American species with which I am not personally familiar.   Subfamily Phyllomedusinae Günther, 1859       Phyllomedusidae Günther 1859 [Type genus, _Phyllomedusa_ Wagler,      1830].  _Definition._--Moderately small to large hylids having vertical pupils, _n_=13 (2_n_=26) chromosomes, skin containing large amounts of powerful bradykinin-like and physalaemin-like polypeptides, eggs suspended from vegetation above water, and tadpoles have a ventral spiracle sinistral to midline.  _Range._--Low and moderate elevations in South and Middle America, including Trinidad, from northern Argentina and northwestern Ecuador to Veracruz and southern Sonora, México.  _Content._--Three genera, one of which probably is composite.   Genus =Agalychnis= Cope, 1864.  _Agalychnis_ Cope, 1864 [Type species, _Hyla moreletii_ Duméril, 1853, by subsequent designation].  _Definition._--Fingers and toes at least half webbed; terminal discs large; first toe shorter than second and not opposable to others; skin smooth, lacking osteoderms; parotoid glands, if present, poorly developed and diffuse; palpebral membrane reticulate (except in _A. calcarifer_); iris red or yellow; skull shallow, depth less than 40 per cent of length; nasals large; frontoparietal fontanelle large; quadratojugals reduced; prevomerine teeth present.  _Range._--Central Veracruz and northern Oaxaca, México, southeastward through Central America to northwestern Ecuador; one species disjunct in Amazonian Ecuador.  _Content._--Eight species [synonyms in brackets]: _annae_ (Duellman, 1963); _calcarifer_ Boulenger, 1902; _callidryas_ (Cope, 1862) [_helenae_ Cope, 1885; _callidryas taylori_ (Funkhouser, 1957)]; _craspedopus_ (Funkhouser, 1957); _litodryas_ (Duellman and Trueb, 1967); _moreleti_ (Duméril, 1853) [_holochroa_ (Salvin, 1861)]; _saltator_ Taylor, 1955; _spurrelli_ Boulenger, 1913.  _Remarks._--Savage and Heyer (1967) provided evidence that _A. callidryas taylori_ (Funkhouser) and _A. helenae_ Cope were junior synonyms of _A. callidryas_ (Cope).   Genus =Pachymedusa=, new genus  Type species, _Agalychnis dacnicolor_ Cope, 1864.  _Definition._--Fingers and toes having basal webs and lateral fringes; terminal discs large; first toe shorter than second and not opposable to others; skin smooth or shagreened, lacking osteoderms; paratoid glands present, diffuse; palpebral membrane reticulate; iris golden yellow with black reticulations; skull deep, depth more than 50 per cent of length; nasals large; frontoparietal fontanelle moderately large; quadratojugal robust; prevomerine teeth present.  _Range._--Pacific slopes and lowlands from southern Sonora to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México.  _Content._--Monotypic: _dacnicolor_ Cope, 1864 [_alcorni_ Taylor, 1952].  _Remarks._--The generic name is derived from the Greek _pachy_ meaning thick and the Greek _Medousa_ (Latin, _Medusa_) in reference to _Phyllomedusa_; the sense implied is the heavy body of _Pachymedusa dacnicolor_.   Genus =Phyllomedusa= Wagler, 1830  _Phyllomedusa_ Wagler, 1830 [Type species, _Rana bicolor_ Boddaert, 1772].  _Pithecopus_ Cope, 1866 [Type species, _Phyllomedusa azurea_ Cope, 1862 (=_Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis_ Daudin, 1803), by original designation].  _Hylomantis_ Peters, 1872 [Type species _Hylomantis aspera_ Peters, 1872, by monotypy].  _Phrynomedusa_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923 [Type species, _Phrynomedusa fimbriata_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923, by subsequent designation].  _Bradymedusa_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926 [Type species, _Bradymedusa moschada_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926 (=_Phyllomedusa rohdei_ Mertens, 1926) by subsequent designation].  _Definition._--Fingers and toes having greatly reduced webbing or lacking webs; terminal discs small; first toe shorter than, equal to, or longer than second, opposable or not; skin smooth or rugose having osteoderms or not; parotoid glands present, in most species, usually distinct and elevated; palpebral membrane not reticulate; iris uniformly silvery white to orange-bronze with black reticulations; skull moderate to deep, depth more than 38 per cent of length; nasals moderately small; frontoparietal fontanelle present, variable in size; quadratojugal reduced in some species; prevomerine teeth present or absent.  _Range._--Low and moderate elevations in South America east of the Andes from the Caribbean (including Trinidad) to northern Argentina; Costa Rica and Panamá in Central America.  _Content._--Thirty-one species [synonyms in brackets]: _aspera_ (Peters, 1872); _ayeaye_ (B. Lutz, 1966); _bahiana_ A. Lutz, 1925; _bicolor_ (Boddaert, 1772) [_scleroderma_ Cope, 1868]; _blombergi_ Funkhouser, 1957; _boliviana_ Boulenger, 1902; _buckleyi_ Boulenger, 1882; _burmeisteri burmeisteri_ Boulenger, 1882; _burmeisteri distincta_ B. Lutz, 1950; _centralis_ Bokermann, 1965; _cochranae_ Bokermann, 1966; _coelestis_ (Cope, 1874); _edentula_ Andersson, 1945; _feltoni_ Shreve, 1935; _fimbriata_ (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923) [_appendiculata_ A. Lutz, 1925]; _guttata_ A. Lutz, 1925; _hypochondrialis_ (Daudin, 1803) [_azurea_ Cope, 1862; _megacephala_ (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926)]; _iheringi_ Boulenger, 1885; _lemur_ Boulenger, 1882; _loris_ Boulenger, 1912; _medinae_ Funkhouser, 1962; _nicefori_ Barbour, 1926; _orcesi_ Funkhouser, 1957; _pailona_ Shreve, 1959; _perlata_ Boulenger, 1882; _rohdei_ Mertens, 1926 [_moschada_ (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926)]; _sauvagei_ Boulenger, 1882 [_rickettsii_ Günther, 1897]; _tarsius_ (Cope, 1868); _tomopterna_ (Cope, 1868) [_palliata_ Peters, 1872]; _trinitatis_ Mertens, 1926, _vaillanti_ Boulenger, 1882, _venusta_ Duellmann and Trueb, 1967.  _Remarks._--_Phyllomedusa_ includes 1) a series of large species (_bicolor-burmeisteri_) showing progressive specialization of the feet; 2) a series of small species having grasping feet (_ayeaye_, _centralis_, _cochranae_, _guttata_, _hypochondrialis_, and _rohdei_); 3) a series of small, relatively unspecialized species (_lemur_, _loris_, and _medinae_); and 4) several other species of questionable affinities. Lutz (1966) resurrected Cope's (1866) _Pithecopus_ for 12 species (_ayeaye_, _boliviana_, _burmeisteri_, _coelestis_, _hypochondrialis_, _nicefori_, _rohdei_, _sauvagei_, _tarsius_, _tomopterna_, _trinitatis_, and _vaillanti_). Adequate material is not available for detailed study of all South American species; consequently, a firm classification cannot be established at this time. Nevertheless, it is obvious that Lutz's arrangement is unnatural. If subsequent investigations show, as seems likely, that the small specialized phyllomedusines are a natural phyletic unit, the generic name _Pithecopus_ is available. However, species such as _boliviana_, _burmeisteri_, _nicefori_, and _trinitatis_ do not belong in _Pithecopus_. As noted by Funkhouser (1962), the small, relatively unspecialized species (_lemur_, _loris_, and _medinae_) form a natural group; possibly this group should be accorded generic recognition. Until more evidence on the interspecific relationships is acquired, the maintenance of the current classification is desirable.
