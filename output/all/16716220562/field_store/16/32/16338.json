[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31232"],["title","History of Morgan's Cavalry (#8)"],["body","S.B. Buckner, commanding the Kentucky State-guard, had an interview with General Geo. B. McClellan, who commanded a department embracing territory contiguous to Kentucky--if, indeed, Kentucky was not included by the commission given him in his department. General Buckner obtained, as he supposed, a guarantee that the neutrality of Kentucky would be observed by the military authorities of the United States. He communicated the result of this interview to Governor Magoffin, and, immediately, it became a matter of _official_ as well as popular belief that the neutrality of Kentucky was safe for all time to come.  The dream, however, was a short one, and very soon afterward the Federal Government commenced to recruit in Kentucky, to establish camps and organize armed forces in the State.  \"Camp Dick Robinson,\" some twenty-six miles from Lexington, was the largest, first formed, and most noted of these establishments. For many weeks the Kentuckians were in a high state of excitement about \"Camp Dick,\" as it was called. They used the name as if it were synonymous with the Federal army, and spoke of the rumors that \"Camp Dick\" was to be moved from point to point, as glibly as if the ground it occupied had possessed the properties of the flying carpet of the fairy tale.  The Legislature, notwithstanding its high-sounding resolutions about neutrality, stood this very quietly, although many citizens (Union men) endeavored to have these camps broken up and the troops removed. Others, again, professed to desire that the Federal troops should be removed, but clandestinely advised President Lincoln to rather increase than withdraw the forces, and offered their services to introduce into Kentucky guns for the armament of the loyal Home-guards. These men were of the class of \"Educators.\" But the game required two to play it. On the 4th of September, in anticipation of a Federal movement upon that point, General Polk, of the Confederate army, occupied Columbus, in Kentucky.  In the midst of the excitement created by the information of the occupation of Columbus, Governor Magoffin sent in the following message:      \"EX. DEP'T, FRANKFORT, _Sept. 9, 1861_.     \"_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:      \"I have received the following dispatches by telegraph from General     Leonidas Polk, which I deem proper to lay before you,      \"B. MAGOFFIN.\"  [If any answer were needed to the outcries of those who so strongly condemned his action, General Polk certainly furnished it. His first dispatch was a simple intimation to Governor Magoffin of his presence upon the soil of Kentucky, and of the authority by which he remained.]      \"COLUMBUS, KENTUCKY, _Sept. 9, 1861_.     \"_Governor B. Magoffin_:      A military necessity having required me to occupy this town, I have     taken possession of it by the forces under my command. The     circumstances leading to this act we reported promptly to the President     of the Confederate States. His reply was, the necessity justified the     action. A copy of my proclamation I have the honor to transmit you by     mail.      \"_Respectfully_,     \"LEONIDAS POLK, _Major-General Commanding_.\"  In a letter of the same date, inclosing his proclamation, General Polk said, after explaining the cause of his delay in writing:      \"It will be sufficient to inform you, which my short address here will     do, that I had information, on which I could rely, that the Federal     forces intended, and were preparing, to seize Columbus. I need not     describe the danger resulting to West Tennessee from such success, nor     say that I could not permit the loss of so important a position, while     holding the command intrusted to me by my government. In evidence of     the information I possessed, I will state that as the Confederate     forces occupied this place, the Federal troops were formed, in     formidable numbers, in position upon the opposite bank, with their     cannon turned upon Columbus. The citizens of the town had fled with     terror, and not a word of assurance of safety or protection had been     addressed to them.\"  General Polk concluded with this language:      \"I am prepared to say that I will agree to withdraw the Confederate     troops from Kentucky, provided that she will agree that the troops of     the Federal Government be withdrawn simultaneously; with a guarantee,     which I will give reciprocally for the Confederate Government, that the     Federals shall not be allowed to enter, or occupy any point of Kentucky     in the future.      \"I have the honor to be     \"Your obedient servant, respectfully,     \"LEONIDAS POLK, _Major-Gen, Com._\"  General Folk's proclamation was as follows:      \"COLUMBUS, _Sept. 14, 1861_.      \"The Federal Government having in defiance of the wishes of the people     of Kentucky, disregarded their neutrality, by establishing camps and     depots of arms, and by organizing military companies within their     territory, and by constructing a military work, on the Missouri shore,     immediately opposite, and commanding Columbus, evidently intended to     cover the landing of troops for the seizure of the town, it has become     a military necessity, worth the defense of the territory of the     Confederate States, that the Confederate forces occupy Columbus in     advance. The Major-General commanding has, therefore, not felt himself     at liberty to risk the loss of so important a position, but has decided     to occupy it. In pursuance of this decision, he has thrown a sufficient     force into the town and ordered fortifying it. It is gratifying to know     that the presence of his troops is acceptable to the people of     Columbus, and on this occasion they assure them that every precaution     will be taken to insure their quiet, the protection of their property,     with their personal and corporate rights.      LEONIDAS POLK.\"  Dispatches, concerning the peculiar manner in which Kentucky observed her neutrality and permitted it to be observed by her Federal friends, began to pour in on the Governor about this time. He had already received, on the 7th, a dispatch from Lieutenant Governor Reynolds, of Missouri, on the subject. Governor Reynolds stated that, \"The Mississippi river below the mouth of the Ohio, is the property of Kentucky and Missouri conjointly.\" He then alluded to the \"presence of United States gunboats in the river at Columbus, Kentucky, to protect the forces engaged in fortifying the Missouri shore immediately opposite.\" \"This,\" he went on to say, \"appears to me to be a clear violation of the neutrality Kentucky proposes to observe in the present war.\" And then again on the 14th came a dispatch from Knoxville, Tennessee, as follows:      \"_To his Excellency B. Magoffin_:      SIR: The safety of Tennessee requiring, I occupy the mountain passes at     Cumberland, and the three long mountains in Kentucky. For weeks I have     known that the Federal commander at Hoskin's Cross Roads was     threatening the invasion of East Tennessee, and ruthlessly urging our     own people to destroy their own road bridges. I postponed this     precaution until the despotic Government at Washington, refusing to     recognize the neutrality of Kentucky, has established formidable camps     in the center and other parts of the State, with the view first to     subjugate our gallant sister, then ourselves. Tennessee feels, and has     ever felt, toward Kentucky as a twin sister; their people, are as our     people in kindred, sympathy, valor, and patriotism; we have felt and     still feel a religious respect for Kentucky's neutrality; we will     respect it as along as our safety will permit. If the Federal forces     will now withdraw from their menacing positions, the forces under my     command shall be immediately withdrawn.      Very respectfully,     F.K. ZOLLICOFFER,     _Brigadier General Commanding_.\"  It would seem that each one of these communications put the case very clearly, and that, Kentucky having permitted her neutrality to be violated by the one side, after her emphatic and definite declaration that it was meant to be good against both, could consistently take no action, unless it should be such as Generals Polk and Zollicoffer suggested, viz: to provide for a simultaneous withdrawal of both Federal and Confederate forces. Certainly Kentucky meant that neither of the combatants should occupy her soil--as has been shown, her declarations upon that head were clear and vigorous. If she intended that troops of the United States should come into her territory, for any purpose whatever, while the Confederate forces should be excluded, it is unnecessary to say that she selected in \"neutrality\" a word, which very inaccurately and lamely expressed her meaning. The people of Kentucky had long since--two months at least, a long time in such a period, before this correspondence between their Governor and the Confederate Generals--ceased to do anything but blindly look to certain leaders, and blindly follow their dictation. The Southern men of the State, and their peculiar leaders, were sullen and inert; the mass of the people were bewildered, utterly incompetent to arrive at a decision, and were implicitly led by the Legislature to which all the politicians, who aspired to influence, now resorted. In view of the history of this neutrality, of the professions made, only a few weeks previously, by the same men who returned an answer from the Capital of Kentucky to the propositions of the Confederate authorities that Kentucky should act fairly, and not declare one policy and clandestinely pursue another--in view of the facts which are fastened in the record--what sort of men does that answer prove them to have been? This was the answer:  \"_Resolved, By the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that his Excellency, Governor Magoffin, be, and he is hereby instructed to inform those concerned, that Kentucky"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31234"],["title","A History of the English Church in New Zealand (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made available by Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

If asked why I took in hand a task of such difficulty and delicacy as that of writing a History of the Church in our Dominion, I can really find no more truthful answer than that of the schoolboy, \"Please, Sir, I couldn't help it.\" From boyhood's days in the old country, when a copy of the Life of Marsden fell into my hands, I felt drawn to the subject; the reading of Selwyn's biography strengthened the attraction; the urging of friends in later years combined with my own inclinations; and thus the work was well on its way when the General Synod of 1913 committed it to my hands as a definite duty.  For the last quarter of a century the Church of this Dominion has indeed possessed a history by my honoured teacher, Dean Jacobs. That scholarly volume could hardly be bettered on the constitutional side. In this department the Dean wrote as one who had taken no mean part in the events which he describes. His ecclesiastical learning and his judicial temper rendered him admirably qualified for the task. In working over the same ground I have perhaps been able to point out a few facts which he had missed or ignored, but on the whole I have left this part of the field to him. This is not a constitutional history: it seeks rather to depict the general life of the Church, and the ideals which guided its leading figures.  The Dean's description of the missionary period is also an admirable piece of work, but he had not the advantage of the stores of material which are now available. Through the indefatigable enthusiasm of the late Dr. Hocken the journals of the early missionaries have been brought to this country, and are made available to the student. His comprehensive collection enables us to come into close touch with days which are already far distant from our own. Of course the historian must be guided by the principle, _summa sequi fastigia rerum_; but he cannot estimate aright the work of the heroic leaders and rulers of the Church unless he can follow the thoughts and careers of the less conspicuous agents--the humble missionary or catechist, the native convert or thinker.  In acknowledging my obligations to the late Dr. Hocken, I would wish to express my gratitude to the authorities of the Dunedin Museum, where his library is kept; and also to my friend Archdeacon Woodthorpe, who kindly placed at my service the unpublished volume in which Dr. Hocken's researches into the life of Marsden are contained. For permission to consult the Godley correspondence in the Christchurch Museum I have to thank the Board of Governors of Canterbury College; and for the loan of a rare and valuable pamphlet on the death of the Rev. C. S. Volkner I am greatly indebted to Mr. Alexander Turnbull, of Wellington. Archdeacon Fancourt, of the same city, has afforded me generous help in recovering some of the early history of the diocese he has so long served; while, in Auckland, the Rev. J. King Davis--a descendant of the two missionaries whose names he bears--has enabled me to identify the positions of some long forgotten _pas_, and has furnished valuable information on other points. Other correspondents, from the Bay of Islands to Otago, have assisted generously with their local knowledge. Outside of New Zealand I have to acknowledge help from Mrs. Hobhouse, of Wells, and the Ven. Archdeacon Hobhouse, of Birmingham, the widow and son of the first Bishop of Nelson.  Many clergy have kindly acceded to my application for photographs of their churches. A fair number of these I have been able to use, and to all the senders I desire to express my thanks. For the view of the ruined church at Tamaki I am indebted to Miss Brookfield, of Auckland, and for the excellent representation of the scene at the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi to Mr. A. F. McDonnell, of Dunedin. In the preparation of the MS. for the press I have been greatly assisted by the Rev. H. East, Vicar of Leithfield.  But the greatest help of all remains to be told. To the aged and venerable Bishop Leonard Williams this book owes more than I can estimate. Not only has he furnished me with abundant information from the stores of his own unique and first-hand knowledge, but, on many points, he has engaged in fresh and laborious research. Every chapter has been sent to him as soon as written, and has benefited immensely by his careful and judicial criticism. Without this thorough testing my book would be far more imperfect than it is.  It is due, however, to the bishop, as well as to my readers, to state emphatically that he is in no way responsible for the views expressed in this book. There are, in fact, a few points on which we do not quite agree. The intricacies of high policy or of mingled motive will never appeal in exactly the same way to different minds. My aim throughout has been to arrive at the simple truth, and I have often been driven to abandon long-cherished ideas by its imperative demand.  In the spelling of Maori names Bishop Williams' authority has always been followed except when a place is looked at from the pakeha or colonial point of view. Then it is spelt in the colonial manner. Readers may be glad to be warned against confusing Turanga (Poverty Bay) with Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty. Similarly, it may be well to call attention to the wide difference between Tamihana Te Waharoa and Tamihana Te Rauparaha. Both were notable men, but their characters were not alike, and they took opposite sides in the great war.  The scope of this book has not permitted me to trace the history of the Melanesian Mission, nor to deal with the island dependencies of our Dominion. Even within the limits of New Zealand itself the treatment of the later period may perhaps seem inadequate. But the events of the years 1850-1890 have been already covered to some extent in my book, \"Bishop Harper and the Canterbury Settlement,\" while for the latest stage of all I have the pleasure of appending to this preface a valuable letter from the present Primate, whose high office and long experience enable him to speak with unique authority upon the life of the Church of to-day.                                  H. T. P.     Glenmark Vicarage, Canterbury, N.Z.,       March, 1914.   LETTER FROM THE MOST REVEREND THE PRIMATE.   Dear Canon Purchas--  In consideration of my long career as a church-worker in New Zealand, you have honoured me with a request to add to your forthcoming volume of the History of the Church here a short account of my impressions as to her life and progress since 1871, and also my ideas as to her prospects and the chief tasks which lie before her.
