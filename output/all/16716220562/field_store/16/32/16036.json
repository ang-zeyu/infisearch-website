I guessed this must mean that I now was well in advance of the farthest point to which Capron's troop had moved, and I was running forward feeling confident that I must be close on our men, when I saw the body of a sergeant blocking the trail and stretched at full length across it.  Its position was a hundred yards in advance of that of any of the others--it was apparently the body of the first man killed.  After death the bodies of some men seem to shrink almost instantly within themselves; they become limp and shapeless, and their uniforms hang upon them strangely.  But this man, who was a giant in life, remained a giant in death--his very attitude was one of attack; his fists were clinched, his jaw set, and his eyes, which were still human, seemed fixed with resolve.  He was dead, but he was not defeated.  And so Hamilton Fish died as he had lived--defiantly, running into the very face of the enemy, standing squarely upright on his legs instead of crouching, as the others called to him to do, until he fell like a column across the trail.  \"God gives,\" was the motto on the watch I took from his blouse, and God could not have given him a nobler end; to die, in the fore-front of the first fight of the war, quickly, painlessly, with a bullet through the heart, with his regiment behind him, and facing the enemies of his country.  The line at this time was divided by the trail into two wings.  The right wing, composed of K and A Troops, was advancing through the valley, returning the fire from the ridge as it did so, and the left wing, which was much the longer of the two, was swinging around on the enemy's right flank, with its own right resting on the barbed-wire fence.  I borrowed a carbine from a wounded man, and joined the remnant of L Troop which was close to the trail.  This troop was then commanded by Second Lieutenant Day, who on account of his conduct that morning and at the battle of San Juan later, when he was shot through the arm, was promoted to be captain of L Troop, or, as it was later officially designated, Capron's troop.  He was walking up and down the line as unconcernedly as though we were at target practice, and an Irish sergeant, Byrne, was assisting him by keeping up a continuous flow of comments and criticisms that showed the keenest enjoyment of the situation.  Byrne was the only man I noticed who seemed to regard the fight as in any way humorous.  For at Guasimas, no one had time to be flippant, or to exhibit any signs of braggadocio.  It was for all of them, from the moment it started, through the hot, exhausting hour and a half that it lasted, a most serious proposition.  The conditions were exceptional.  The men had made a night march the evening before, had been given but three hours' troubled sleep on the wet sand, and had then been marched in full equipment uphill and under a cruelly hot sun, directly into action.  And eighty per cent. of them had never before been under fire.  Nor had one man in the regiment ever fired a Krag-Jorgensen carbine until he fired it at a Spaniard, for their arms had been issued to them so soon before sailing that they had only drilled with them without using cartridges.  To this handicap was also added the nature of the ground and the fact that our men could not see their opponents. Their own men fell or rolled over on every side, shot down by an invisible enemy, with no one upon whom they could retaliate, with no sign that the attack might not go on indefinitely.  Yet they never once took a step backward, but advanced grimly, cleaning a bush or thicket of its occupants before charging it, and securing its cover for themselves, and answering each volley with one that sounded like an echo of the first. The men were panting for breath; the sweat ran so readily into their eyes that they could not see the sights of their guns; their limbs unused to such exertion after seven days of cramped idleness on the troop-ship, trembled with weakness and the sun blinded and dazzled them; but time after time they rose and staggered forward through the high grass, or beat their way with their carbines against the tangle of vines and creepers.  A mile and a half of territory was gained foot by foot in this fashion, the three Spanish positions carried in that distance being marked by the thousands of Mauser cartridges that lay shining and glittering in the grass and behind the barricades of bushes.  But this distance had not been gained without many losses, for every one in the regiment was engaged.  Even those who, on account of the heat, had dropped out along the trail, as soon as the sound of the fight reached them, came limping to the front--and plunged into the firing-line.  It was the only place they could go--there was no other line.  With the exception of Church's dressing station and its wounded there were no reserves.  Among the first to be wounded was the correspondent, Edward Marshall, of the New York _Journal_, who was on the firing-line to the left.  He was shot through the body near the spine, and when I saw him he was suffering the most terrible agonies, and passing through a succession of convulsions.  He nevertheless, in his brief moments of comparative peace, bore himself with the utmost calm, and was so much a soldier to duty that he continued writing his account of the fight until the fight itself was ended.  His courage was the admiration of all the troopers, and he was highly commended by Colonel Wood in the official account of the engagement.   [Picture: Wounded Rough Riders coming over the hill at Siboney.  Head of  column of Second Infantry going to support the Rough Riders, June 24th]  Nothing so well illustrated how desperately each man was needed, and how little was his desire to withdraw, as the fact that the wounded lay where they fell until the hospital stewards found them.  Their comrades did not use them as an excuse to go to leave the firing-line.  I have watched other fights, where the men engaged were quite willing to unselfishly bear the wounded from the zone of danger.  The fight had now lasted an hour, and the line had reached a more open country, with a slight incline upward toward a wood, on the edge of which was a ruined house.  This house was a former distillery for _aguardiente_, and was now occupied in force by the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt on the far left was moving up his men with the intention of taking this house on the flank; Wood, who was all over the line, had the same objective point in his mind.  The troop commanders had a general idea that the distillery was the key to the enemy's position, and were all working in that direction.  It was extremely difficult for Wood and Roosevelt to communicate with the captains, and after the first general orders had been given them they relied upon the latter's intelligence to pull them through.  I do not suppose Wood, out of the five hundred engaged, saw more than thirty of his men at any one time.  When he had passed one troop, except for the noise of its volley firing, it was immediately lost to him in the brush, and it was so with the next.  Still, so excellent was the intelligence of the officers, and so ready the spirit of the men, that they kept an almost perfect alignment, as was shown when the final order came to charge in the open fields.  The advance upon the ruined building was made in stubborn, short rushes, sometimes in silence, and sometimes firing as we ran.  The order to fire at will was seldom given, the men waiting patiently for the officers' signal, and then answering in volleys.  Some of the men who were twice Day's age begged him to let them take the enemy's impromptu fort on the run, but he answered them tolerantly like spoiled children, and held them down until there was a lull in the enemy's fire, when he would lead them forward, always taking the advance himself.  By the way they made these rushes, it was easy to tell which men were used to hunting big game in the West and which were not.  The Eastern men broke at the word, and ran for the cover they were directed to take like men trying to get out of the rain, and fell panting on their faces, while the Western trappers and hunters slipped and wriggled through the grass like Indians; dodging from tree trunk to tree trunk, and from one bush to another.  They fell into line at the same time with the others, but while doing so they had not once exposed themselves.  Some of the escapes were little short of miraculous.  The man on my right, Champneys Marshall, of Washington, had one bullet pass through his sleeve, and another pass through his shirt, where it was pulled close to his spine.  The holes where the ball entered and went out again were clearly cut.  Another man's skin was slightly burned by three bullets in three distinct lines, as though it had been touched for an instant by the lighted end of a cigar.  Greenway was shot through this shirt across the breast, and Roosevelt was so close to one bullet, when it struck a tree, that it filled his eyes and ears with tiny splinters.  Major Brodie and Lieutenant Thomas were both wounded within a few feet of Colonel Wood, and his color-sergeant, Wright, who followed close at his heels, was clipped three times in the head and neck, and four bullets passed through the folds of the flag he carried.  One trooper, Rowland, of Deming, was shot through the lower ribs; he was ordered by Roosevelt to fall back to the dressing station, but there Church told him there was nothing he could do for him then, and directed him to sit down until he could be taken to the hospital at Siboney.  Rowland sat still for a short time, and then remarked restlessly, \"I don't seem to be doing much good here,\" and picking up his carbine, returned to the firing-line.  There Roosevelt found him.  \"I thought I ordered you to the rear,\" he demanded.  \"Yes, sir, you did,\" Rowland said, \"but there didn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],["title","Notes of a War Correspondent (#8)"],["body"," to be much doing back there.\"  After the fight he was sent to Siboney with the rest of the wounded, but two days later he appeared in camp.  He had marched from Siboney, a distance of six miles, and uphill all the way, carrying his carbine, canteen, and cartridge-belt.  \"I thought you were in hospital,\" Wood said.  \"I was,\" Rowland answered sheepishly, \"but I didn't seem to be doing any good there.\"  They gave him up as hopeless, and he continued his duties and went into the fight of the San Juan hills with the hole still through his ribs. Another cowboy named Heffner, when shot through the body, asked to be propped up against a tree with his canteen and cartridge-belt beside him, and the last his troop saw of him he was seated alone grimly firing over their heads in the direction of the enemy.  Early in the fight I came upon Church attending to a young cowboy, who was shot through the chest.  The entrance to his wound was so small that Church could not insert enough of the gauze packing to stop the flow of blood.  \"I'm afraid I'll have to make this hole larger,\" he said to the boy, \"or you'll bleed to death.\"  \"All right,\" the trooper answered, \"I guess you know your business.\"  The boy stretched out on his back and lay perfectly quiet while Church, with a pair of curved scissors, cut away the edges of the wound.  His patient neither whimpered nor swore, but stared up at the sun in silence.  The bullets were falling on every side, and the operation was a hasty one, but the trooper made no comment until Church said, \"We'd better get out of this; can you stand being carried?\"  \"Do you think you can carry me?\" the trooper asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Well,\" exclaimed the boy admiringly, \"you certainly know your business!\"  Another of the Rough Riders was brought to the dressing station with a shattered ankle, and Church, after bandaging it, gave him his choice of riding down to Siboney on a mule, or of being carried, a day later, on a litter.  \"If you think you can manage to ride the mule with that broken foot,\" he said, \"you can start at once, but if you wait until to-morrow, when I can spare the men, you can be carried all the way.\"  The cowboy preferred to start at once, so six hospital stewards lifted him and dropped him on the mule, and into a huge Mexican saddle.  He stuck his wounded ankle into one stirrup, and his untouched one into the other, and gathered up the reins.  \"Does it pain you?  Can you stand it?\" Church asked anxiously.  The cowboy turned and smiled down upon him with amused disdain.  \"Stand _this_?\" he cried.  \"Why, this is just like getting money from home.\"  Toward the last, the firing from the enemy sounded less near, and the bullets passed much higher.  Roosevelt, who had picked up a carbine and was firing to give the direction to the others, determined upon a charge. Wood, at the other end of the line, decided at the same time upon the same manoeuvre.  It was called \"Wood's bluff\" afterward, for he had nothing to back it with; while to the enemy it looked as though his whole force was but the skirmish-line in advance of a regiment.  The Spaniards naturally could not believe that this thin line which suddenly broke out of the bushes and from behind trees and came cheering out into the hot sunlight was the entire fighting force against it.  They supposed the regiment was coming close on its heels, and as Spanish troops hate being rushed as a cat hates water, they fired a few parting volleys and broke and ran.  The cheering had the same invigorating effect on our own side as a cold shower; it was what first told half the men where the other half were, and it made every individual man feel better.  As we knew it was only a bluff, the first cheer was wavering, but the sound of our own voices was so comforting that the second cheer was a howl of triumph.  As it was, the Spaniards thought the Rough Riders had already disregarded all the rules of war.  \"When we fired a volley,\" one of the prisoners said later, \"instead of falling back they came forward.  That is not the way to fight, to come closer at every volley.\"  And so, when instead of retreating on each volley, the Rough Riders rushed at them, cheering and filling the hot air with wild cowboy yells, the dismayed enemy retreated upon Santiago, where he announced he had been attacked by the entire American army.  One of the residents of Santiago asked one of the soldiers if those Americans fought well.  \"_Well_!\" he replied, \"they tried to catch us with their hands!\"  I have not attempted to give any account of General Young's fight on our right, which was equally desperate, and, owing to the courage of the colored troops of the Tenth in storming a ridge, equally worthy of praise.  But it has seemed better not to try and tell of anything I did not see, but to limit myself to the work of the Rough Riders, to whom, after all, the victory was due, as it was owing to Colonel Wood's charge, which took the Spaniards in flank, that General Wheeler and General Young were able to advance, their own stubborn attack in front having failed to dislodge the enemy from his rifle-pits.  According to the statement of the enemy, who had every reason not to exaggerate the size of his own force, 4,000 Spaniards were engaged in this action.  The Rough Riders numbered 534, and General Young's force numbered 464.  The American troops accordingly attacked a force over four times their own number intrenched behind rifle-pits and bushes in a mountain pass.  In spite of the smokeless powder used by the Spaniards, which hid their position, the Rough Riders routed them out of it, and drove them back from three different barricades until they made their last stand in the ruined distillery, whence they finally drove them by assault.  The eager spirit in which this was accomplished is best described in the Spanish soldier's answer to the inquiring civilian, \"They tried to catch us with their hands.\"  The Rough Riders should adopt it as their motto.    II--THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN HILL   After the Guasimas fight on June 24, the army was advanced along the single trail which leads from Siboney on the coast to Santiago.  Two streams of excellent water run parallel with this trail for short distances, and some eight miles from the coast crossed it in two places. Our outposts were stationed at the first of these fords, the Cuban outposts a mile and a half farther on at the ford nearer Santiago, where the stream made a sharp turn at a place called El Poso.  Another mile and a half of trail extended from El Poso to the trenches of San Juan.  The reader should remember El Poso, as it marked an important starting-point against San Juan on the eventful first of July.  For six days the army was encamped on either side of the trail for three miles back from the outposts.  The regimental camps touched each other, and all day long the pack-trains carrying the day's rations passed up and down between them.  The trail was a sunken wagon road, where it was possible, in a few places, for two wagons to pass at one time, but the greater distances were so narrow that there was but just room for a wagon, or a loaded mule-train, to make its way.  The banks of the trail were three or four feet high, and when it rained it was converted into a huge gutter, with sides of mud, and with a liquid mud a foot deep between them.  The camps were pitched along the trail as near the parallel stream as possible, and in the occasional places where there was rich, high grass.  At night the men slept in dog tents, open at the front and back, and during the day spent their time under the shade of trees along the trail, or on the banks of the stream.  Sentries were placed at every few feet along these streams to guard them from any possible pollution.  For six days the army rested in this way, for as an army moves and acts only on its belly, and as the belly of this army was three miles long, it could advance but slowly.  This week of rest, after the cramped life of the troop-ship, was not ungrateful, although the rations were scarce and there was no tobacco, which was as necessary to the health of the men as their food.  During this week of waiting, the chief excitement was to walk out a mile and a half beyond the outposts to the hill of El Poso, and look across the basin that lay in the great valley which leads to Santiago.  The left of the valley was the hills which hide the sea.  The right of the valley was the hills in which nestle the village of El Caney.  Below El Poso, in the basin, the dense green forest stretched a mile and a half to the hills of San Juan.  These hills looked so quiet and sunny and well kept that they reminded one of a New England orchard.  There was a blue bungalow on a hill to the right, a red bungalow higher up on the right, and in the centre the block-house of San Juan, which looked like a Chinese pagoda.  Three-quarters of a mile behind them, with a dip between, were the long white walls of the hospital and barracks of Santiago, wearing thirteen Red Cross flags, and, as was pointed out to the foreign attaches later, two six-inch guns a hundred yards in advance of the Red Cross flags.  It was so quiet, so fair, and so prosperous looking that it breathed of peace.  It seemed as though one might, without accident, walk in and take dinner at the Venus Restaurant, or loll on the benches in the Plaza, or rock in one of the great bent-wood chairs around the patio of the Don Carlos Club.  But, on the 27th of June, a long, yellow pit opened in the hill-side of San Juan, and in it we could see straw sombreros rising and bobbing up and down, and under the shade of the block-house, blue-coated Spaniards strolling leisurely about or riding forth on little white ponies to scamper over the hills.  Officers of every regiment, _attaches_ of foreign countries, correspondents, and staff officers daily reported the fact that the rifle-pits were growing in length and in number, and that in plain sight from the"]]]
