DUELLMAN   Field studies on hylid frogs in southern México and northern Central America have resulted in the collection of numerous specimens of _Ptychohyla_, a genus of hylid frogs heretofore poorly represented in museum collections. Experience with the living frogs in their natural habitats has been helpful in defining the species and in formulating ideas concerning their relationships.  Taylor (1944) proposed the generic name _Ptychohyla_ for a new species of frog, _Ptychohyla adipoventris_ [= _Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_ (Ahl)--_fide_ Duellman, 1960] from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero. Taylor defined the genus as having large ventrolateral glands and horny nuptial spines in males. Stuart (1954:169) discussed the generic characters and pointed out that both the ventrolateral glands and horny nuptial spines were seasonal in their development, being found only in breeding males. Stuart then went on to describe _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_, a species characterized by the absence of horny nuptial spines in breeding males. My investigations of these frogs have revealed the presence of two groups of species. In both groups breeding males have large ventrolateral glands, but the two groups are easily separated by four characters. The first group contains, among others, _Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_, _euthysanota_, _spinipollex_, and another species in the Mesa Central of Chiapas to which I tentatively apply the name _Ptychohyla macrotympanum_ (Tanner), 1957. This group of species is characterized by horny nuptial spines in breeding males, presence of a tarsal fold, a call consisting of a single long note, and tadpoles having lips not greatly expanded. The second group, as recognized here, is characterized by the absence of horny nuptial spines in breeding males, lack of a tarsal fold, a call consisting of a series of short notes, and tadpoles having greatly expanded lips. In this group belong _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and the two species described below.  Only the descriptions of the new species are given in this paper; detailed comparisons, descriptions of osteological features, analyses of calls, and discussions of relationships are reserved for a forthcoming review of the entire genus.  In the spring of 1959, collections of amphibians and reptiles were made in the cloud forests on the northern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northern Oaxaca. Among the hylids found, two specimens of a heretofore unnamed species of _Ptychohyla_ have brilliant red flash-colors on the groin and thighs; in allusion to these fiery colors I propose that this species be named:  ~_Ptychohyla ignicolor_~ new species  (Plate 25, Fig. 1)       _Holotype._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No.      119603, from a stream 6 kilometers south of Vista Hermosa,      Oaxaca, México (1865 meters); obtained on March 31, 1959, by      Thomas E. Moore. Original Number WED 14159.       _Paratype._--UMMZ 119602 from Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca (1500      meters); obtained on March 30, 1959, by William E. Duellman.       _Diagnosis._--A species of the _schmidtorum_-group of      _Ptychohyla_ differing from other known members of the group      in having the diameter of the tympanum less than one-half      the diameter of the eye, no white spot below the eye, no      lateral light stripe, bright green dorsum in life and red      flash-colors on groin and thighs.       _Description of Holotype._--Adult male having a snout-vent      length of 30.0 mm.; tibia length, 14.6 mm.; tibia      length/snout-vent length, 48.7 per cent; foot length      (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to      tip of longest toe), 12.3 mm.; head length, 9.2 mm.; head      length/snout-vent length, 32.3 per cent; head width, 9.3      mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 31.0 per cent; diameter      of eye, 3.2 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.3 mm.;      tympanum/eye, 40.6 per cent. Snout in lateral profile      square, in dorsal profile obtusely rounded; canthus      pronounced; loreal region slightly concave; lips moderately      flaring; top of head flat; nostrils protuberant; internarial      distance, 2.8 mm.; interorbital distance, 3.3 mm., much      broader than width of eyelid, 2.8 mm. A heavy dermal fold      from posterior corner of eye above tympanum to insertion of      forelimb, covering upper edge of tympanum; tympanum      elliptical, its greatest diameter equal to its distance from      eye. Forearm robust with a distinct fold on wrist; pollex      moderately enlarged without nuptial spines; second and      fourth fingers equal in length; subarticular tubercles      round; none is bifid; disc of third finger slightly larger      than tympanum; no web between first and second fingers;      vestige of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when      hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to      anterior corner of eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal      tubercle large, flat, and elliptical; outer metatarsal      tubercle near inner one and triangular; subarticular      tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest      1-2-5-3-4; toes about one-half webbed; discs smaller on toes      than on fingers. Anal opening directed posteriorly at upper      level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of large tubercles below      anal opening; small tubercles ventral and lateral to these.      Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of limbs smooth, that of      throat and belly granular. Ventrolateral glands noticeably      thickened, extending from axilla nearly to groin and only      narrowly separated medially on chest. Skin of anterior part      of chin thickened and glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly      notched behind and only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine      teeth 0-3, situated on rounded elevations between somewhat      larger, round inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one      situated along posterior margin of each mandibular ramus.  PLATE 25  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Paratype of _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ (UMMZ 119602). × 3.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Holotype of _Ptychohyla chamulae_ (KU 58063). × 3.]       Color (in alcohol) dull brown above with irregular dark      brown blotches; dorsal surfaces of limbs brown with narrow      darker brown transverse bars; posterior surfaces of thighs      cream-color with brown spots and mottling; groin and dorsal      surfaces of first and second toes white; belly      cream-colored; glandular areas orange-brown; chest and chin      having black spots. Ventral surfaces of hind limbs and first      toes cream-colored; undersides of other toes and soles of      feet brown.       Color (in life) uniform bright green above; venter pale      creamy yellow; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs,      ventral surfaces of shanks, anterior surfaces of tarsi and      upper proximal surfaces of first three toes red; iris pale      golden color.       The paratype is an adult male, having a snout-vent length of      26.3 mm., and agrees with the holotype in proportions. The      ventrolateral glands are less extensive and the chin less      spotted than in the holotype.       _Comparisons_: Both _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and the species      described below differ from _P. ignicolor_ in lacking red      flash-colors and in having a white spot below the eye.      _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ also differs in having a small      tympanum. As stated above, these species can be      distinguished from the rest of the genus by the absence of a      tarsal fold and absence of horny nuptial spines in breeding      males.       _Remarks_: The holotype was found on a moss-covered log over      a stream in dense cloud forest by day. The paratype was      calling at night from a low herb at the edge of a small      stream in the cloud forest. Nearby a _Ptychohyla      leonhard-schultzei_ was calling.  Along two cascading mountain streams in cloud forest on the northern slopes of the Mesa Central in central Chiapas numerous specimens of a distinctive species of _Ptychohyla_ were found in association with two species of _Hyla_ and two of _Plectrohyla_. The first specimen of this new species of _Ptychohyla_ was discovered by Dale L. Hoyt, who found the frog on a rock at midday. At night on August 5, 1960, numerous individuals were found calling from leaves of plants growing on the slopes of the ravine by the streams. None was more than two meters above the ground. Tadpoles were found in the fast-flowing stream, where they were holding onto rocks with their mouths. Little is known of the herpetofauna of these mountains that are the home of the Chamula Indians. Since the little frog described here comes from the land of the Chamulas, I propose that it be named:  ~_Ptychohyla chamulae_~ new species  (Plate 25, Fig. 2)       _Holotype._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History      No. 58063, from a stream above (6.2 kilometers by road      south) Rayón Mescalapa, Chiapas, México (1690 meters); one      of a series collected on August 5, 1960, by William E.

A thin dermal fold from posterior corner of      eye above tympanum to insertion of forelimb, covering upper      edge of tympanum; tympanum nearly round, its diameter equal      to its distance from eye. Forearm slender lacking distinct      fold on wrist; a row of low, rounded tubercles on      ventrolateral surface of forearm; pollex moderately enlarged      without nuptial spines; second and fourth fingers equal in      length; subarticular tubercles round, none bifid; discs      small, that of third finger noticeably smaller than      tympanum; no web between first and second fingers; vestige      of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when hind limbs      adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of      eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal tubercle large, flat,      and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle slightly more      distal than inner, small, and elliptical; subarticular      tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest      1-2-5-3-4; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc;      fourth toe webbed to base of penultimate phalanx; discs      smaller on toes than on fingers. Anal opening directed      posteriorly at upper level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of      large tubercles below anal opening and a slightly smaller      pair farther below. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of      forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and      ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands      well developed, not reaching axilla or groin and broadly      separated midventrally. Skin of anterior part of chin      glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly notched behind and      only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-2, situated      on small triangular elevations between large, ovoid inner      nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner      posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.       Color (in alcohol) dark purplish brown on dorsal surfaces of      head, body, and shanks; thighs brown above and yellowish tan      posteriorly; white stripe extending from below eye above      forearm to mid-flank. Ventral surfaces creamy white;      ventrolateral glands orange-tan flecked with dark brown;      edge of lower lip with dark brown spots; narrow white line      on upper lip; palms white and soles brown.       Color (in life) uniform dark bright green above with creamy      white bar below eye; lateral stripe silvery white; ventral      surfaces deep yellow; posterior surfaces of thighs yellow      brown; iris reddish bronze.       _Variation._--Sixteen adult males are available; these have      snout-vent lengths of 26.3 to 28.5 mm. (average, 27.6 mm.).      The tympanum/eye ratio is 48.2 to 58.6 per cent (average,      53.2 per cent). The number of vomerine teeth varies from      four to six. The extent of the ventrolateral glands is      variable. In five specimens the glands nearly meet      midventrally; in two others the glands include the axillary      region; in none do the glands extend into the groin. In      other structural details there is no noticeable variation.       The greatest variation in color pattern is found in the      lateral stripe. The pale spot or bar below the eye is      present in all specimens; in one individual there is no      lateral stripe; in three the stripe extends posteriorly only      to above the forearm, in two to the mid-flank, and in the      others to the groin.       Although all of the males were bright uniform green above      when collected at night as they were calling, some changed      color later. In these individuals the dorsum became a      somewhat paler green with faint irregular yellowish tan      blotches.       The one available female (UMMZ 121399) has a snout-vent      length of 30.3 mm. and a tympanum/eye ratio of 52.8 per      cent, and is colored like the males. The tubercles by the      anal opening are placed irregularly and do not consist of      two pairs below the opening. There are no ventrolateral      glands, glandular area on the chin, or enlarged prepollex.       _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla chamulae_ resembles _P.      schmidtorum_ in color pattern and body proportions, but the      ground color of _schmidtorum_ is chocolate brown and not      green as in _chamulae_. Also, in _schmidtorum_ the webbing      and posterior surfaces of the thighs are pale cream-color in      preserved specimens as contrasted with tan in _chamulae_. In      living _schmidtorum_ the iris is bright red, not reddish      bronze as in _chamulae_. The ventrolateral glands in      _schmidtorum_ more closely approximate one another      midventrally than in _chamulae_. It is conceivable that      these populations are subspecifically related; _schmidtorum_      occurs in the same kind of habitat as does _chamulae_, but      is known only from the Pacific slopes of southeastern      Chiapas and southwestern Guatemala, whereas _chamulae_ is      known only from the Atlantic slopes of the Mesa Central in      north-central Chiapas. Both of these species differ from      _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ in having a relatively larger      tympanum, more webbing on the foot, different arrangement of      anal tubercles, and different coloration.       _Description of Tadpole._--Six tadpoles having fully      developed mouth parts have body lengths of 5.5 to 11.9 mm.      and total lengths of 17.3 to 44.0 mm. The following      description is based on a tadpole (KU 58199) having small      hind limbs, a body length of 10.5 mm., and a total length of      39.0 mm. Body ovoid, only slightly flattened dorsally and      ventrally (Fig. 1); body only slightly deeper than wide;      eyes directed dorsolaterally and slightly protuberant;      nostrils small. Tail long and slender; greatest depth of      tail-musculature two-thirds greatest depth of tail-fin;      tail-musculature extending nearly to tip of tail-fin.       Mouth directed anteroventrally; thin fleshy lips greatly      expanded and forming large suckerlike disc; width of mouth      greater than width of snout and nearly as wide as body.      Outer edge of lips having small papillae; inner surface of      mouth smooth; scattered large papillae, seemingly in rows,      around teeth and beak (Fig. 2). Tooth rows 3/3; the upper      rows subequal in length; upper rows one and three      interrupted medially; lower rows one and two about equal in      length to upper rows; third lower row short. Upper beak      heavy and horn-covered.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_ (KU 58199). × 2.5.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Mouthparts of tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_ (KU 58199). × 16.]       Color (in alcohol) dark brown over entire body and      tail-musculature; a white area near base of tail, and a dark      streak on anterior one-fourth of tail; tail-fin transparent      having brown blotches.       _Remarks_.--Five metamorphosing tadpoles and juveniles (KU      58074, 58234-8) were found at night on vegetation by      streams. Of two completely metamorphosed young each has a      snout-vent length of 15.7 mm. Another having a snout-vent      length of 16.2 mm. has a tail stub 2 mm. long and a      completely metamorphosed mouth. Two others have snout-vent      lengths of 13.6 and 14.1 mm. and tail lengths of 11.5 and      8.1 mm. respectively; in these the mouth parts are      incompletely metamorphosed. The single female available      (UMMZ 121399) contains approximately 60 ovarian eggs, the      largest of which are about 2.5 mm. in diameter.       _Referred Specimens.--Chiapas_: 6.2 km. S of Rayón      Mescalapa, KU 58063-74, 58199 (1 tadpole), 58234-8; 5.6 km.      S of Rayón Mescalapa, KU 58062, 58200 (5 tadpoles); 11.4 mi.      N of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, UMMZ 121395-9. The      specimens listed last were collected along a stream between      Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán and Rayón Mescalapa, which,      according to Floyd L. Downs, is probably the same stream      listed above as 5.6 km. S of Rayón Mescalapa.  Acknowledgments  I take this opportunity to thank Dale L. Hoyt, Thomas E. Moore, and John Wellman, who ably assisted in collecting and studying these frogs in the field. I am indebted to Floyd L.
