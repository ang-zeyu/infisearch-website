The true history of men's minds is found in their actions; their wants are indicated by their contrivances; and certain it is that in highly cultivated ages we discover the most refined intellects attempting NEOLOGISMS.[27] It would be a subject of great curiosity to trace the origin of many happy expressions, when, and by whom created. Plato substituted the term _Providence_ for _fate_; and a new system of human affairs arose from a single word. Cicero invented several; to this philosopher we owe the term of _moral_ philosophy, which before his time was called the philosophy of _manners_. But on this subject we are perhaps more interested by the modern than by the ancient languages. Richardson, the painter of the human heart, has coined some expressions to indicate its little secret movements, which are admirable: that great genius merited a higher education and more literary leisure than the life of a printer could afford. Montaigne created some bold expressions, many of which have not survived him; his _incuriosité_, so opposite to curiosity, well describes that state of negligence where we will not learn that of which we are ignorant. With us the word _incurious_ was described by Heylin, 1656, as an unusual word; it has been appropriately adopted by our best writers, although we still want _incuriosity_. Charron invented _étrangeté_ unsuccessfully, but which, says a French critic, would be the true substantive of the word _étrange_; our Locke is the solitary instance produced for \"foreignness\" for \"remoteness or want of relation to something.\" Malherbe borrowed from the Latin, _insidieux_, _sécurité_, which have been received; but a bolder word, _dévouloir_, by which he proposed to express _cesser de vouloir_, has not. A term, however, expressive and precise. Corneille happily introduced _invaincu_ in a verse in the Cid,    Vous êtes _invaincu_, mais non pas _invincible_.  Yet this created word by their great poet has not sanctioned this fine distinction among the French, for we are told that it is almost a solitary instance. Balzac was a great inventor of neologisms. _Urbanité_ and _féliciter_ were struck in his mint. \"Si le mot _féliciter_ n'est pas française, il le sera l'année qui vient;\" so confidently proud was the neologist, and it prospered as well as _urbanité_, of which he says, \"Quand l'usage aura muri parmi nous un mot de si mauvais gout, et corrigé _l'amertume de la nouveauté_ qui s'y peut trouver, nous nous y accoutumerons comme aux autres que nous avons emprunté de la même langue.\" Balzac was, however, too sanguine in some other words; for his _délecter_, his _sériosité_, &c. still retain their \"bitterness of novelty.\"  Menage invented a term of which an equivalent is wanting in our language; \"J'ai fait _prosateur_ à l'imitation de l'italien _prosatore_, pour dire un homme qui écrit en prose.\" To distinguish a prose from a verse writer, we _once_ had \"a proser.\" Drayton uses it; but this useful distinction has unluckily degenerated, and the current sense is so daily urgent, that the purer sense is irrecoverable.  When D'Albancourt was translating Lucian, he invented in French the words _indolence_ and _indolent_, to describe a momentary languor, rather than that habitual indolence in which sense they are now accepted; and in translating Tacitus, he created the word _turbulemment_; but it did not prosper any more than that of _temporisement_. Segrais invented the word _impardonnable_, which, after having been rejected, was revived, and is equivalent to our expressive _unpardonable_. Molière ridiculed some neologisms of the _Précieuses_ of his day; but we are too apt to ridicule that which is new, and which we often adopt when it becomes old. Molière laughed at the term _s'encanailler_, to describe one who assumed the manners of a blackguard; the expressive word has remained in the language. The meaning is disputed as well as the origin is lost of some novel terms. This has happened to a word in daily use--_Fudge_! It is a cant term not in Grose, and only traced by Todd not higher than to Goldsmith. It is, however, no invention of his. In a pamphlet, entitled \"Remarks upon the Navy,\" 1700, the term is declared to have been the name of a certain nautical personage who had lived in the lifetime of the writer. \"There was, sir, in our time, one _Captain Fudge_, commander of a merchantman, who upon his return from a voyage, how ill-fraught soever his ship was, always brought home his owners a good cargo of lies; so much that now, aboard ship, the sailors, when they hear a great lie told, cry out, 'You _fudge_ it!'\" It is singular that such an obscure byword among sailors should have become one of the most popular in our familiar style; and not less, that recently at the bar, in a court of law, its precise meaning perplexed plaintiff and defendant and their counsel. I think it does not signify mere lies, but bouncing lies, or rhodomontades.  There are two remarkable French words created by the Abbé de Saint Pierre, who passed his meritorious life in the contemplation of political morality and universal benevolence--_bienfaisance_ and _gloriole_. He invented _gloriole_ as a contemptuous diminutive of _glorie_; to describe that vanity of some egotists, so proud of the small talents which they may have received from nature or from accident. _Bienfaisance_ first appeared in this sentence: \"L'Esprit de la vraie religion et le principal but de l'evangile c'est _la bienfaisance_, c'est-à-dire la pratique de la charité envers le prochain.\" This word was so new, that in the moment of its creation this good man explained its necessity and origin. Complaining that \"the word 'charity' is abused by all sorts of Christians in the persecution of their enemies, and even heretics affirm that they are practising Christian charity in persecuting other heretics, I have sought for a term which might convey to us a precise idea of doing good to our neighbours, and I can form none more proper to make myself understood than the term of _bienfaisance_, good-doing. Let those who like, use it; I would only be understood, and it is not equivocal.\" The happy word was at first criticised, but at length every kind heart found it responded to its own feeling. Some verses from Voltaire, alluding to the political reveries of the good abbé, notice the critical opposition; yet the new word answered to the great rule of Horace.    Certain législateur, dont la plume féconde   Fit tant de vains projets pour le bien du monde,   Et qui depuis trente ans écrit pour des ingrats,   Vient de créer un mot qui manque à Vaugelas:   Ce mot est BIENFAISANCE; il me plaît, il rassemble   Si le coeur en est cru, bien des vertus ensemble.   Petits grammairiens, grands précepteurs de sots,   Qui pesez la parole et mesurez les mots,   Pareille expression vous semble hazardée,   Mais l'univers entier doit en cherir l'idée!  The French revolutionists, in their rage for innovation, almost barbarised the pure French of the Augustan age of their literature, as they did many things which never before occurred; and sometimes experienced feelings as transitory as they were strange. Their nomenclature was copious; but the revolutionary jargon often shows the danger and the necessity of neologisms. They form an appendix to the Academy Dictionary. Our plain English has served to enrich this odd mixture of philology and politics: _Club_, _clubiste_, _comité_, _jure_, _juge de paix_, blend with their _terrorisme_, _lanterner_, a verb active, _lévee en masse_, _noyades_, and the other verb active, _septembriser_, &c. The barbarous term _demoralisation_ is said to have been the invention of the horrid capuchin Chabot; and the remarkable expression of _arrière pensée_ belonged exclusively in its birth to the jesuitic astuteness of the Abbé Sieyes, that political actor, who, in changing sides, never required prompting in his new part!  A new word, the result of much consideration with its author, or a term which, though unknown to the language, conveys a collective assemblage of ideas by a fortunate designation, is a precious contribution of genius; new words should convey new ideas. Swift, living amidst a civil war of pamphlets, when certain writers were regularly employed by one party to draw up replies to the other, created a term not to be found in our dictionaries, but which, by a single stroke, characterises these hirelings; he called them _answer-jobbers_. We have not dropped the fortunate expression from any want of its use, but of perception in our lexicographers. The celebrated Marquis of Lansdowne introduced a useful word, which has of late been warmly adopted in France as well as in England--_to liberalise_; the noun has been drawn out of the verb--for in the marquis's time that was only an abstract conception which is now a sect; and to _liberalise_ was theoretically introduced before the _liberals_ arose.[28] It is curious to observe that as an adjective it had formerly in our language a very opposite meaning to its recent one. It was synonymous with \"libertine or licentious;\" we have \"a _liberal_ villain\" and \"a most profane and _liberal_ counsellor;\" we find one declaring \"I have spoken _too liberally_.\" This is unlucky for the _liberals_, who will not--    Give allowance to our _liberal_ jests   Upon their persons--       BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.  Dr. Priestley employed a forcible, but not an elegant term, to mark the general information which had begun in his day; this he frequently calls \"the _spread_ of knowledge.\" Burke attempted to brand with a new name that set of pert, petulant, sophistical sciolists, whose philosophy the French, since their revolutionary period, have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],["title","Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#8)"],["body","as _philosophism_, and the philosophers themselves as _philosophistes_. He would have designated them as _literators_, but few exotic words will circulate; new words must be the coinage of our own language to blend with the vernacular idiom. Many new words are still wanted. We have no word by which we could translate the _otium_ of the Latins, the _dillettante_ of the Italians, the _alembiqué_ of the French, as an epithet to describe that sublimated ingenuity which exhausts the mind, till, like the fusion of the diamond, the intellect itself disappears. A philosopher, in an extensive view of a subject in all its bearings, may convey to us the result of his last considerations by the coinage of a novel and significant expression, as this of Professor Dugald Stewart--_political religionism_. Let me claim the honour of one pure neologism. I ventured to introduce the term of FATHER-LAND to describe our _natale solum_; I have lived to see it adopted by Lord Byron and by Mr. Southey, and the word is now common. A lady has even composed both the words and the air of a song on \"Father-land.\" This energetic expression may therefore be considered as authenticated; and patriotism may stamp it with its glory and its affection. FATHER-LAND is congenial with the language in which we find that other fine expression MOTHER-TONGUE. The patriotic neologism originated with me in Holland, when, in early life, it was my daily pursuit to turn over the glorious history of its independence under the title of _Vaderlandsche Historie_--the history of FATHER-LAND!  If we acknowledge that the creation of some neologisms may sometimes produce the beautiful, the revival of the dead is the more authentic miracle; for a new word must long remain doubtful, but an ancient word happily recovered rests on a basis of permanent strength; it has both novelty and authority. A collection of _picturesque words_, found among our ancient writers, would constitute a precious supplement to the history of our language. Far more expressive than our term of _executioner_ is their solemn one of the _deathsman_; than our _vagabond_, their _scatterling_; than our _idiot_ or _lunatic_, their _moonling_,--a word which, Mr. Gifford observes, should not have been suffered to grow obsolete. Herrick finely describes by the term _pittering_ the peculiar shrill and short cry of the grasshopper: the cry of the grasshopper is pit! pit! pit! quickly repeated. Envy \"_dusking_ the lustre\" of genius is a verb lost for us, but which gives a more precise expression to the feeling than any other words which we could use.  The late Dr. Boucher, in the prospectus of his proposed Dictionary, did me the honour, then a young writer, to quote an opinion I had formed early in life of the purest source of neology, which is in the _revival of old words_.    Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake!  We have lost many exquisite and picturesque expressions through the dulness of our lexicographers, or by the deficiency in that profounder study of our writers which their labours require far more than they themselves know. The natural graces of our language have been impoverished. The genius that throws its prophetic eye over the language, and the taste that must come from Heaven, no lexicographer imagines are required to accompany him amidst a library of old books!   FOOTNOTES:    [19] Aulus Gellius, lib. i. c. 10.    [20] Instit. lib. i. c. 5.    [21] This verse was corrected by Bentley _procudere nummum_, instead     of _producere nomen_, which the critics agree is one of his happy     conjectures.    [22] Henry Cockeram's curious little \"English Dictionarie, or an     Interpretation of hard English words\", 12mo, 1631, professes to give     in its first book \"the choicest words themselves now in use,     wherewith our language is inriched and become so copious.\" Many have     not survived, such as the following:--        Acyrologicall    An improper speech.       Adacted          Driven in by force.       Blandiloquy      Flattering speech.       Compaginate      To set together that which is broken.       Concessation     Loytering.       Delitigate       To scold, or chide vehemently.       Depalmate        To give one a box on the ear.       Esuriate         To hunger.       Strenuitie       Activity.      Curiously enough, this author notes some words as those \"now out of     use, and onely used of some ancient writers,\" but which we now     commonly use. Such are the following:--        Abandon          To forsake or cast off.       Abate            To make lesse, diminish, or take from.    [23] A most striking instance of the change of meaning in a word is     in the old law-term _let_--\"without _let_ or hindrance;\" meaning     void of all opposition. Hence, \"I will _let_ you,\" meant \"I will     hinder you;\" and not as we should now think, \"I will give you free     leave.\"    [24] Shakspeare makes \"Ancient Pistol\" use a new-coined Italian     word, when he speaks of being \"better accommodated;\" to the great     delight of Justice Shallow, who exclaims, \"It comes from     _accommodo_--a good phrase!\" And Ben Jonson, in his \"Tale of a Tub,\"     ridicules Inigo Jones's love of two words he often used:--                     ----If it _conduce_       To the design, whate'er is _feasible_,       I can express.    [25] The term _pluck_, once only known to the prize-ring, has now     got into use in general conversation, and also into literature, as a     term indicative of ready courage.    [26] Such terms as \"_patent_ to the public\"--\"_normal_     condition\"--\"_crass_ behaviour,\" are the inventions of the last few     years.    [27] Shakspeare has a powerfully-composed line in the speech of the     Duke of Burgundy, (_Henry V._ Act v. Sc. 2), when, describing the     fields overgrown with weeds, he exclaims--                           ----The coulter rusts,       That should _deracinate_ such _savagery_.    [28] The \"Quarterly Review\" recently marked the word _liberalise_ in     italics as a strange word, undoubtedly not aware of its origin. It     has been lately used by Mr. Dugald Stewart, \"to _liberalise_ the     views.\"--Dissert. 2nd part, p. 138.     THE PHILOSOPHY OF PROVERBS.   In antique furniture we sometimes discover a convenience which long disuse had made us unacquainted with, and are surprised by the aptness which we did not suspect was concealed in its solid forms. We have found the labour of the workmen to have been as admirable as the material itself, which is still resisting the mouldering touch of time among those modern inventions, elegant and unsubstantial, which, often put together with unseasoned wood, are apt to warp and fly into pieces when brought into use. We have found how strength consists in the selection of materials, and that, whenever the substitute is not better than the original, we are losing something in that test of experience, which all things derive from duration.  Be this as it may! I shall not unreasonably await for the artists of our novelties to retrograde into massive greatness, although I cannot avoid reminding them how often they revive the forgotten things of past times! It is well known that many of our novelties were in use by our ancestors! In the history of the human mind there is, indeed, a sort of antique furniture which I collect, not merely for their antiquity, but for the sound condition in which I still find them, and the compactness which they still show. Centuries have not worm-eaten their solidity! and the utility and delightfulness which they still afford make them look as fresh and as ingenious as any of our patent inventions.  By the title of the present article the reader has anticipated the nature of the old furniture to which I allude. I propose to give what, in the style of our times, may be called the Philosophy of Proverbs--a topic which seems virgin. The art of reading proverbs has not, indeed, always been acquired even by some of their admirers; but my observations, like their subject, must be versatile and unconnected; and I must bespeak indulgence for an attempt to illustrate a very curious branch of literature, rather not understood than quite forgotten.  Proverbs have long been in disuse. \"A man of fashion,\" observes Lord Chesterfield, \"never has recourse to proverbs and vulgar aphorisms;\" and, since the time his lordship so solemnly interdicted their use, they appear to have withered away under the ban of his anathema. His lordship was little conversant with the history of proverbs, and would unquestionably have smiled on those \"men of fashion\" of another stamp, who, in the days of Elizabeth, James, and Charles, were great collectors of them; would appeal to them in their conversations, and enforce them in their learned or their statesmanlike correspondence. Few, perhaps, even now, suspect that these neglected fragments of wisdom, which exist among all nations, still offer many interesting objects for the studies of the philosopher and the historian; and for men of the world still open an extensive school of human life and manners.  The home-spun adages, and the rusty \"sayed-saws,\" which remain in the mouths of the people, are adapted to their capacities and their humours. Easily remembered, and readily applied, these are the philosophy of the vulgar, and often more sound than that of their masters! whoever would learn what the people think, and how they feel, must not reject even these as insignificant. The proverbs of the street and of the market, true to nature, and lasting only because they are true, are records that the populace at Athens and at Rome were the same people as at Paris and at London, and as they had before been in the city of Jerusalem!  Proverbs existed before books. The Spaniards date the origin of their _refranes que dicen las viejas tras el fuego_, \"sayings of old wives by their firesides,\" before the existence of any writings in their language, from the circumstance that"]]]
