That tree--I've forced myself to be nice to her, but the more I see of her, the more convinced I am that she's trying to steal you from me.\"  Phyllis was beginning to poison his mind, he thought, because it had seemed to him also, in his last conversation with Magnolia, that he had discerned more than ordinary warmth in her attitude toward him ... and perhaps a trace of spite toward his wife?  Preposterous! The tree had only been trying to cheer him up as any friend might reasonably do. After all, a tree and a man.... Nonsense! One had an anabolic metabolism, one a catabolic.  But this was a different kind of tree. She spoke, she read, she was capable of conscious turgor movements. And he, he had often thought secretly, was a different kind of man. Whereas Phyllis....  But that was disloyalty--to the type as well as the individual. The tree could be a companion to him, but she could not give him sons to work his land; she could not give him daughters to populate his planet; moreover, she did not, could not possibly know what human love meant, while Phyllis could at least learn.  \"Look, dear,\" he said, sitting down beside his wife on the couch and taking her hand in his. She didn't draw away this time. \"Suppose that what you say is true--not that it is, of course. Just because the tree has a crush on me doesn't mean I necessarily have a crush on her, does it?\"  His wife looked up at him, her rose-red lips parted, her moss-gray eyes shining. \"Oh, if only I could believe that, James!\"  \"Anyhow, she doesn't know what the whole thing's about, poor kid!\"  \"Poor _kid_!\"  \"Phyllis, you know you're prettier than any tree.\" That was not literally true, but reason was useless; he had to make his point in terms she could understand. \"And, remember, she's got a lot of rings--she must be centuries old--while you are only nineteen.\"  \"Twenty,\" Phyllis corrected. \"I had a birthday on the ship.\"  \"Well, you certainly must allow me to wish you a happy birthday, darling.\"  She was in his arms at last; he was about to kiss her, and the tree seemed very remote, when she drew back. \"But are you sure she doesn't--she isn't--she can't be watching us?\"  \"Darling, I swear it!\" \"_Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops_\".... But he had sense enough not to say it, and Elysium had not one blessed moon, but three, and everything was all right.  For a while anyway.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I see your wife is developing a corm,\" the tree remarked, as James paused for a chat. He hadn't much time to be sociable those days, for there was such a lot of work to be done, so many preparations to be made, so many things to be requisitioned from Earth. The supply ships were beginning to come now, bringing necessities and an occasional luxury for those who could afford it.  \"She's pregnant,\" James explained. \"Happened before I left Earth.\"  \"How do you mean?\"  \"She's about to fruit. Didn't I read that zoology book to you?\"  \"Yes, but--oh, James, it all seems so vulgar! To fruit without ever having bloomed--how squalid!\"  \"It all depends on how you look at it,\" he said. \"I--that is, we had hoped that when the baby came, you would be godmother to it. You know what that is, don't you?\"  \"Of course I do. You read _Cinderella_ to me. I know it's a great honor. But I'm afraid I must decline.\"  \"Why? I thought you were my--our friend.\"  \"Jim, there is something I must confess: my feelings toward you are not merely those of a friend. Although Phyllis doesn't have too many rings of intellect, she is a female, so she knew all along.\" Magnolia's leaves rustled diffidently. \"I feel toward you the way I never felt toward any intelligent life-form, but only toward the sun, the soil, the rain. I sense a tropism that seems to incline me toward you. In fact, I'm afraid, Jim, in your own terms, I love you.\"  \"But you're a tree! You can't love me in my own terms, because trees can't love in the way people can, and, of course, people can't love like trees. We belong to two entirely different species, Maggie. You can't have listened to that zoology book very attentively.\"  \"Our race is a singularly adaptable one or we wouldn't have survived so long, Jim, or gone so far in our particular direction. It's lack of fertility, not lack of enterprise, that's responsible for our decline. And I think your species must be an adaptable one, too; you just haven't really tried. Oh, James, let us reverse the classical roles--let me be the Apollo to your Daphne! Don't let Phyllis stand in our way. The Greek gods never let a little thing like marriage interfere with their plans.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But I love Phyllis,\" he said in confusion. \"I love you, too,\" he added, \"but in a different way.\"  \"Yes, I know. More like a sister. However, I have plenty of sisters and I don't need a brother.\"  \"We're starting a conservation program,\" he tried to comfort her. \"We have every hope of getting some pollen from the other side of the planet once we have explained to the trees there how far we can make a little go, and you've got to accept it; you mustn't be silly about it.\"  \"It isn't the same thing, Jim, and you know it. One of the penalties of intelligence is a diffusiveness of the natural instincts. I would rather not fruit at all than--\"  [Illustration]  \"Magnolia, you just don't understand. No matter how much you--well, pursue me, I can never turn into a laurel tree.\"  \"I didn't--\"  \"Or any kind of tree! Look, some more books were just sent over from Base.\"  Magnolia gave a rueful rustle. \"Just were sent? Didn't they come over a month ago?\"  James flushed. \"I know I haven't had a chance to do much reading to you in the last few weeks, Maggie--or any at all, in fact--but I've been so busy. After the baby's born, things will be much less hectic and we'll be able to catch up.\"  \"Of course, James. I understand. Naturally your family comes first.\"  \"One of the books that came was an advanced zoology text that might make things a little clearer.\"  \"I should very much like to hear it. When you have the time to spare, that is.\"  \"Tell you what,\" he said. \"I'll get the book and read you the chapter on the reproductive system in mammals. Won't take more than an hour or so.\"  \"If you're in a hurry, it can wait.\"  \"No,\" he told her. \"This will make me feel a little less guilty about having neglected you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Whereupon the umbilical cord is severed,\" he concluded, \"and the human infant is ready to take its place in the world as a separate entity. Now do you understand, Magnolia?\"  [Illustration]  \"No,\" she said. \"Where do the bees come in?\"  \"I thought you were in such a hurry to get to Base, James,\" Phyllis remarked sweetly from the doorway, wiping her reddening hands on a dish towel.  \"I am, dear.\" He slipped the book behind his back; it was possible that, in her present state of mind--induced, of course, by her delicate condition--Phyllis might misunderstand his motive in reading that particular chapter of that particular book to that particular tree. \"I just stopped for a chat with Magnolia. She's agreed to be godmother to the baby.\"  \"How very nice of her. Earth Government will be so pleased at such a _fine_ example of rapport with the natives. You might even get a medal. Wouldn't that be nice?... James,\" she hurried on, before he could speak, \"you still haven't found any green-leafed plants on the planet, have you? Have you looked everywhere? Have you looked _hard_?\"  \"Haven't I told you time and time again, Mrs. Haut,\" the tree said, \"that there aren't any--that there can't be any? It's impossible to synthesize chlorophyll from the light rays given off by our sun--only cyanophyll. What do you want with a green-leafed plant, anyway?\"  Phyllis's voice broke. \"I think I'd lose my mind if I was convinced that I'd never see a green leaf again. All this awful blue, blue, blue, all the time, and the leaves never fall, or, if they do, there are new ones right away to take their place. They're always there--always blue.\"  \"We're everblue,\" Magnolia explained. \"Sorry, but that's the way it is.\"  \"Jim, I hate to hurt your feelings, but I just have to take down those curtains. The colors--I can't stand it!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Pregnant women sometimes get fanciful notions,\" James said to the tree. \"It's part of the pregnancy syndrome. Try not to pay any attention.\"  \"Kindly don't explain me to a tree!\" Phyllis cried. \"I have a right to prefer green, don't I?\"  \"There is, as your proverb says, no accounting for strange tastes,\" the tree murmured. \"However--\"  \"We're going to have a formal christening,\" James interrupted, for the sake of the peace. \"We thought we should, since ours will be the first baby born on the planet. Everybody on Elysium will come--that is, all the human beings. Only because they _can_ come, you know; we'd love to have the trees if they were capable of locomotor movement. You'll get to widen your social contacts, Maggie. Dr. Lakin and Dr. Cutler will probably be here; I know you'll be glad to see Dr. Lakin again, and you've been anxious to meet Dr. Cutler. They've been asking after you, too. I think Dr. Lakin is planning to write a monograph on you for the _Journal of the American Association of Professors of English Literature_--with your permission, of course.\"  \"Christening--that's one of your native festivals, isn't it? It should be most interesting.\"  \"That's right,\" Phyllis murmured. \"It will be Christmas soon. I'd almost forgotten. It'll be the first Christmas I've ever spent away from home. And there won't be any snow or--or anything.\" She started to guttate--to cry again.  \"Cheer up, honey,\" Jim said. \"It won't be as bad as you think, because I didn't forget Christmas was coming. There's something specially nice for you on its way from Earth; I only hope it gets here on time.\" Phyllis sniffled. \"Maybe we'l"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31583"],["title","The Venus Trap (#4)"],["body","have a Christmas party, too. Would you like that?\" But she remained unresponsive.  He turned to the tree. \"Christening's entirely different, though,\" he explained. \"It's--I guess naming the fruit would be the best way to describe it.\"  \"Is that so?\" Magnolia said. \"What kind of fruit do you expect to have, Mrs. Haut? Oranges? Bananas? As your good St. Luke says, the tree is known by its fruit. You look as if yours might be a watermelon.\"  \"Why, the--idea!\" Phyllis choked. \"Are you going to stand there, James, and let that _vegetable_ insult me?\"  \"I'm sure she didn't mean to,\" he protested. \"She got confused by--that zoology book I read her.\"  The door slammed behind his weeping wife.  \"I don't think you quite understand, Maggie,\" he said. \"In fact, sometimes I almost think you, too, don't want to understand.\"  \"I know what kind of fruit it's going to be,\" the tree concluded triumphantly. \"Sour apples.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Ouch,\" exclaimed Magnolia, \"that tickles! There's more to acting as a Christmas tree than I had anticipated from your glowing descriptions, Jim.\"  \"Here, dear,\" Phyllis said, \"maybe you'd better let me put the decorations on her.\"  \"You can't get on the ladder in your condition,\" he said, apprehensive not only for her welfare but for the tree's. Phyllis had not taken kindly to the idea of having Magnolia as official Christmas tree, suggesting that, if she must participate in the ceremonies, it might be better in the capacity of Yule log. However, Jim knew Magnolia would be offended if any other tree were chosen to be decorated.  \"I'll manage all right,\" he assured his wife. \"If you want to be useful, you might put on some coffee and make sandwiches or something. The bachelors are coming over from Base with that equipment that arrived yesterday, and they'll probably be glad of a snack before turning in.\"  \"The coffee's already on and the canapes made,\" Phyllis smiled. \"And I've baked cookies, too, and whipped up a batch of penuche. What kind of a Christmas party do you think it would be without refreshments?\"  \"Very efficient, isn't she?\" Magnolia remarked, as the battery-powered lights that James had affixed to her began to wink on, for the deep red-violet dusk had already fallen and the first moon was rising. \"Have you thought, Mrs. Haut, that if you fruit today, it will save the expense of another festival?\"  \"I don't expect to fruit for another two months,\" Phyllis said coldly, \"and why shouldn't we have another festival? We can afford it and I like parties. I haven't been to one since the day I landed.\"  [Illustration]  \"Is the life out here getting a little quiet for you, petiole?\" the tree asked solicitously. \"It must be hard when one has no intellectual resources upon which to draw.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Phyllis held her peace for ten seconds; then, \"I wonder where those boys can be,\" she said. \"I hope they bring some pickles along. I asked to have some sent, but I'm accustomed to having no attention paid to what I want.\"  \"There's a surprise coming for you, Phyllis,\" James could not help telling her again, hoping to arouse some semblance of interest. \"Something I know you'll love.... And for you, too,\" he said courteously to Magnolia.  \"You mean the same surprise for both, or a surprise apiece?\" the tree asked.  \"Oh, one for each, of course.\"  \"I see the lights of the 'copter now!\" Phyllis cried and, running out into the middle of the lawn, began waving her handkerchief. He hadn't seen her so pleasantly excited for a long time.  \"I don't suppose I'll need to turn on the landing lights,\" he said to Magnolia. \"You should do the trick.\"  \"Am I all finished?\" she rustled anxiously. \"I do wish I could see myself. How do I look?\"  [Illustration]  \"Splendid. I've never had as beautiful a Christmas tree as you, Maggie,\" he told her with complete honesty. \"Not even on Earth.\"  \"I'm glad, Jim, but I still wish I could be more to you than just a Christmas tree.\"  \"Shh. The others might hear.\"  For the helicopter had landed and the visitors were pouring out, with shouts of admiration. Not only the bachelors had come--and in full force--but some of the older men from Base, who apparently felt they could manage to do without their wives for twelve hours, even if those hours included Christmas Eve. He wondered where he and Phyllis could put them all, but some could sleep outside, if need be, for it was never cold on Elysium. The winds were gentle and the rains light and fragrant.         *       *       *       *       *  While the visitors were crowding around Phyllis and the tree, James rooted eagerly through the packages they had brought, until he found what he wanted. Then he rushed over to the group. \"I know I should wait until tomorrow, but I want to give the girls their presents now.\" The other men smiled sympathetically, almost as joyful as he. \"Merry Christmas, Magnolia!\" He hoped Phyllis would understand that it was etiquette which dictated that the alien life-form should get her gift first.  \"Thank you,\" the tree said. \"I am deeply touched. I don't believe anyone ever gave me a present before. What is it?\"  \"Liquid plant food--vitamins and minerals, you know. For you to drink.\"  \"What fun!\" she exclaimed in pretty excitement. \"Pour some over me right now!\"  \"Not so fast, Jim, boy!\" Dr. Cutler, the biologist, snatched the jug from James' hand. \"First you-all better let me take a sample of this here stuff back to Base to test on a lower life-form, so's I can make sure it won't do anything bad to Miss Magnolia. Might have iron in it and I have a theory that iron may not be beneficial for the local vegetation.\"  \"Oh, thank you!\" the tree rustled. \"It's so very thoughtful of you, Doctor, but I'm sure Jim would never give me anything that would injure me.\"  \"I'm sure he isn't fixing to do a thing like that, ma'am, but he's no botanist.\"  \"And for you, Phyllis....\" James handed his wife the awkward bundle to unwrap for herself.  She tore the papers off slowly. \"Oh, Jim, darling, it's--it's--\"  \"You wanted a bit of green, so I ordered a plant from Earth. You like it? I hope you do.\"  \"Oh, _Jim_!\" She embraced him and the pot simultaneously. \"More than _anything_!\"  \"It won't stay green,\" Magnolia observed. \"Either it'll turn blue or it'll die. Puny-looking specimen, isn't it?\"  \"Well,\" said James, \"it's only a youngster. I guess this Christmas is too early, but next Christmas there ought to be berries. It's a holly plant, Phyl.\"  \"Holly,\" she repeated, her voice shaking a little. \"_Holly._\" She and Dr. Cutler exchanged glances.  \"I told you, Miz Phyllis, ma'am--he may know the first thing about botany, but he doesn't know anything after that.\"  \"Jim,\" Phyllis said, linking her free arm through his, \"I misjudged you. Dr. Cutler is right. You don't know so very much about botany, after all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He looked at her blankly. Her voice was trembling, and not with tears this time. \"I love this little plant; it's just what I wanted ... but there aren't ever going to be any berries, because, to have berries, you have to have two plants. And the right two. Holly's di--dio--it's just like us.\"  \"Oh,\" James said, feeling thoroughly inadequate. \"I'm sorry.\"  \"But you mustn't be sorry. I'm going to plant it here on Elysium, and I hope it will stay green in spite of what she says, and it'll have blossoms anyway ... and it was very, very sweet of you, dear.\"  She kissed his cheek.  \"Is this one a boy or a girl?\" Magnolia asked.  \"You-all can't tell till it blooms, Miss Magnolia, ma'am,\" Dr. Cutler informed her.  \"Maybe I can. Hand it up here, please.\"  Phyllis paused for an irresolute moment, then, smiling nervously at her guests, obliged.  \"It's a boy,\" Magnolia announced, after a minute. \"A boy.\" She gave back the pot reluctantly. \"Phyllis,\" she said, \"you and I have never been friends and I admit that it's been my fault just as much as yours.\"  \"As much as mine?\" Phyllis echoed. \"I like that--\" and was going to go on when she obviously recollected that they had company, and stopped.  \"So I know it's presumptuous of me to ask you a favor.\"  \"Yes, Magnolia?\" Phyllis said, her fine cornsilk eyebrows arched a trifle. \"What is this favor?\"  \"When you plant the little fellow--you said you were going to, anyhow--would you plant him near me?\"  Phyllis looked down at the plant she held cradled in her arms and then up at the tree. \"Of course, Magnolia,\" she said, frowning slightly. \"I didn't realize....\" Her voice began to tremble. \"I _have_ been pretty rotten, haven't I?\" She looked toward James, but he turned his glance away.  \"Just because you were a plant,\" Phyllis continued, \"didn't mean I had to be a b-b-beast. It must have been awful for you, seeing me like this, practically crowing over you, and knowing that you yourself would never have the chance to be a m-m-m-mother.\"  \"'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,'\" Magnolia said sadly, \"'and waste its sweetness on the desert air.'\"         *       *       *       *       *  Phyllis was crying unashamedly now. \"I'll plant him right next to you--Maggie. I want you to have him. He can be your baby.\"  \"Thank you, Phyl,\" Maggie said softly. \"That's very ... blue of you.\"  \"Although I think that's a jim-dandy idea,\" the biologist said, \"and I sure wouldn't want to do anything to discourage it, being real interested in the results of an experiment like that my own self, I don't think you ought to feel so mean about it, Miz Phyllis. If all she wanted--begging your pardon, Miss Magnolia, ma'am--was a baby, why didn't she take an interest in the holly until she found out it was a male? Why wouldn't a little old girl holly have done as well?\"  \"Why--why, you scheming vegetable!\" Phyllis exploded at Magnolia, clutching the holly plant to her protective bosom. \"He's much too young for you, and I'm going to plant him far away, where he can't possibly fall into your clutches.\"  \"Now,"]]]
