BY   J. B. JONES,    CLERK IN THE WAR DEPARTMENT OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES GOVERNMENT;   AUTHOR OF \"WILD WESTERN SCENES,\" ETC. ETC.     VOLS. I and II.     PHILADELPHIA:   J. B. LIPPINCOTT & CO.   1866.      Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1866, by   J. B. LIPPINCOTT & CO.,    In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the   Eastern District of Pennsylvania.     PREFACE.   This Diary was written with the knowledge of the President and the Secretary of War. I informed them of it by note. They did not deprecate criticism on their official conduct; for they allowed me still to execute the functions of a very important position in the Government until the end of its career.  My discriminating friends will understand why I accepted the poor title of a clerkship, after having declined the _Charg√©ship_ to Naples, tendered by Mr. Calhoun during the administration of President Polk.
