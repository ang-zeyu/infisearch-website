In 1931 and 1932, R.L. Landberg obtained a few specimens that are in the Denver Museum of Natural History. In 1935, C.W. Quaintance, Lloyd White, Harold P. Pratt, and A.E. Borell prepared specimens, some of which remain in the museum at the Park (all specimens in the museum at the Park are designated by \"MV\" for Mesa Verde and by their catalogue numbers), and some are in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California at Berkeley (designated \"MVZ\" in the following accounts). Specimens in The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History are referred to by catalogue numbers only. Specimens prepared by D. Watson bear dates from 1936 until 1955. In 1938, Raymond F. Harlow prepared some specimens; his Student Technician's Report of 7 typescript pages, for July 8 to September 9, 1938, is on file at Mesa Verde National Park. In 1944 and 1945, Dr. D.A. Sutton, then a student at the University of Colorado, collected chipmunks for his own study, and also some other specimens that are in the University of Colorado Museum and the Park Museum. In 1949, Dr. R.B. Finley, then a student at The University of Kansas, collected in and near the Park and obtained a few specimens preserved in The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Rodents preserved by Harold R. Shepherd have been mentioned. I have examined 244 specimens that were collected by the above persons. Between August 8 and September 4, 1956, and on July 17, 1960, I collected 216 mammals from Mesa Verde National Park. Between November 3, and 12, 1957, J.R. Alcorn collected 275 mammals from the Mesa. The total of specimens examined is 735.  Written reports by C.W. Quaintance, H.P. Pratt, and R. Harlow have been of considerable use. A typescript report of 13 pages by Wildlife Technician H.P. Pratt for the period from September 9 to October 15, 1935, and monthly reports comprising 40 typescript pages and 4 pages with photographs by C.W. Quaintance for the period from February 18 through July 17, 1935, are on file at offices of Region Four, National Park Service, 180 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco 5, California. Chief Ranger Wade has kindly made available the files in his office, including reports of the Superintendent and reports of the Chief Ranger in earlier years, and Annual or Biennial Animal Census Reports since 1930. Special reports on prairie dogs, porcupines, and deer are in the files. These reports, and random reports that were regarded as reliable, are recorded on card files in both the Chief Ranger's office and Park Archeologist's office. Most of the information reported here on the larger mammals was gleaned from the above sources. A study of population fluctuations in porcupines by Donald A. Spencer and perhaps a study of movements of porcupines by Spencer, Wade and Fitch are to be published elsewhere. Other studies still in progress are mentioned in the following accounts.     ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES   Sorex merriami leucogenys Osgood Merriam's Shrew       _Specimen_: MV 7898/507, head of Navajo Canyon (locality No. 7 in      Fig. 2), October 21, 1954.  This was the third reported specimen of the rare Merriam's shrew from Colorado (Rodeck and Anderson, 1956:436).   Sorex vagrans obscurus Merriam Wandering Shrew       _Specimens examined._--Total, 8: Morfield Canyon, 7600 ft., 75972,      75973; Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69235-69238; 1/4 mi. N      Middle Well, Prater Canyon, 7500 ft., 69239-69240.  The specimens from Prater Canyon were trapped in the grasses and sedges of the meadow comprising the floor of the canyon. The ground and vegetation were dry at the time of capture, September 2, 3, and 4, 1956. _Microtus montanus_ was the only other species taken in the mouse traps in the sedge and grass. Five of the six specimens from Prater Canyon are young, having slightly worn teeth; the sixth is an old adult male the teeth of which are so much worn that only a few traces of the reddish-brown pigment remain. His testes were 5 mm. long. These specimens are from an area of intergradation between _S. v. obscurus_ and _S. v. monticola_. The length of the maxillary tooth-row in these six specimens averaged 6.23 (6.1-6.4) millimeters. Comparison with average measurements of 6.6 and 6.8 in samples of _S. v. obscurus_, and of 5.9 in a sample of _S. v. monticola_ (Findley, 1955:64, 65) reveals the intermediate size of the specimens from the Mesa Verde. The gap between habitat suitable for _Sorex vagrans_ on the Mesa Verde and the nearest record-station for _S. v. monticola_ to the south and west in the Chuska Mountains is wider than the gap between the Mesa Verde and the nearest record-station for _S. v. obscurus_ to the north and east, one mile west of Mancos, 75971, 7000 feet, or at Silverton. On geographic grounds the specimens from the Mesa Verde are referred to _S. v. obscurus_. The two specimens from Morfield Canyon were trapped on November 4, 1957, and are grayish above and silvery below. Their pelage contrasts markedly with the dorsally brownish and ventrally buffy pelage of the September-taken specimens from Prater Canyon.   Myotis californicus stephensi Dalquest California Myotis       _Specimens examined._---Total, 3: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69243,      69246, August 21 and 22, 1956; 4505 Denver Museum, within the Park      (exact locality not recorded), R.L. Landberg, July 27, 1931.  The specimens from Rock Springs were an adult male and a non-pregnant adult female. Both were shot over the road in pinyon and juniper. The specimens are referred to _M. c. stephensi_ on account of their paleness, _stephensi_ being paler than _M. c. californicus_ from east of Mesa Verde in Colorado.   Myotis evotis evotis (H. Allen) Long-eared Myotis       _Specimens examined._--Total, 4: Chickaree Draw, Prater Canyon,      8200 ft., MV 7841/507, probably in the summer of 1935; Rock      Springs, 7400 ft., 69241, August 23, 1956, and 69249, August 18,      1956; Museum, Headquarters, 6950 ft., 69251, August 24, 1956.  An adult male (69241) was taken in a Japanese mist net stretched fifteen feet across a dirt road where it entered the stand of pinyon and juniper at the south edge of the burn on Wetherill Mesa between 7:20 and 8:30 p.m.; at the same place and time I captured five other bats of four species: _Myotis thysanodes_, _Myotis subulatus_, _Eptesicus fuscus_, and _Plecotus townsendii_. A piece of mist net attached to an aluminum hoop-net two and one half feet in diameter was used to good advantage in capturing bats rebounding from the larger mist net, and in frightening bats into the larger net when they approached closely. An adult male (69249) was shot at 7:20 p.m. while flying six to eight feet from the ground between pinyon trees up to 20 feet high; the air temperature was 70Â° F. A female (69251) was found seemingly exhausted on the floor in the museum at Park Headquarters in the daytime, and was immature as indicated by small size, open basicranial sutures, unworn teeth, weakly ossified zygoma, and open epiphyseal sutures of phalanges.   Myotis subulatus melanorhinus (Merriam) Small-footed Myotis       _Specimens examined._--Total, 8: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69242,      69244, 69245, 69247, 69248, August 21 to 23, 1956; Hospital, Park      Headquarters, MV 7886/507, [Male], July 12, 1939; Headquarters,      MV 7877/507, [Female], August 30, 1938; 4504 Denver Museum,      within the Park (exact locality not recorded), R.L. Landberg, July      27, 1931.  The specimens from Rock Springs are two adult males that were shot, and one adult male, one adult female, and one young male that were netted at the place described in the account of _Myotis evotis_. The three adult males are near the average color of _M. s. melanorhinus_, and distinctly darker than the _Myotis californicus_ from the Mesa Verde. In the female the pelage is paler and brighter, and the ears and membranes are darker, than in _M. californicus_.   Myotis thysanodes thysanodes Miller Fringed Myotis       _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69250, ad. [Female], August      23, 1956; taken in net as noted in account of _Myotis evotis_.   Myotis volans interior Miller Long-legged Myotis       _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69252, ad. [Female], August      21, 1956; shot over road.   Eptesicus fuscus pallidus Young Big Brown Bat       _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69253, ad. [Female], August      23, 1956; taken in net as noted in account of _Myotis evotis_.   Plecotus townsendii pallescens (Miller) Townsend's Big-eared Bat       _Specimens examined._--Total, 5: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69254, ad.      [Female], non-pregnant, August 23, 1956; Square Tower House,      6700 ft., 69255-69258, March, 1955.  The specimen from Rock Springs was taken in a net as noted in the account of _Myotis evotis_. The specimens from Square Tower House were obtained by D. Watson in a dimly lighted chamber formed by fracture in the rocks at the bottom of the canyon wall, above the talus slope. The bats were suspended from the wall of the chamber, which was at least six feet wide and fifteen feet long.   Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana (Saussure) Brazilian Free-tailed Bat       _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Cliff Palace, 6800 ft., MV      7862/507 and 7863/507, males, both collected by A.E. Borell, on      August 23, 1936.   Lepus californicus texianus Waterhouse Black-tailed Jackrabbit  The black-tailed jackrabbit inhabits the Montezuma Valley to the north of the Mesa Verde and the Mancos Valley to the northeast, and has been seen occasionally on the top of the Mesa according to reports with date and locality noted in the files at the Park for the years 1941, 1942, 1947, 1948, 1950, and 1951. In 1942 four observations were made, in 1950 and 1951 two observations were recorded each year, and in other"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31035"],["title","Mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (#2)"],["body","only one observation was recorded each year. Nine observations are for Chapin Mesa south of Far View; only two observations are for higher elevations on the North Rim.   Sylvilagus audubonii warreni Nelson Desert Cottontail       _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Head of Prater Canyon, MV      7850/507; Far View Ruins, 75974, ad. [Female], non-pregnant,      November 8, 1957.  One specimen was shot, while it was sitting near a pile of logs, by J.R. Alcorn by means of a bow and arrow. Although _S. audubonii_ occurs on the Mesa along with _S. nuttallii_, _S. audubonii_ is the species of the lowlands throughout the western United States at the latitude of Mesa Verde National Park. For example, _S. a. warreni_ (69260) but not _S. n. pinetis_ was obtained along the east side of the Mancos River at 6200 feet elevation (less than 50 yards outside the Park) and the same was true at the same elevation at a place 4-1/2 mi. N of the Park (No. 69259 from 2 mi. E Cortez).   Sylvilagus nuttallii pinetis (J.A. Allen) Nuttall's Cottontail       _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: ad. [Male], 69263, skull only,      dead on road, 1-3/4 mi. N Park Headquarters, 7275 feet, August 9,      1956; ad. [Female], 69261, no embryos, dead on road, 3/4 mi. S      and 1-3/4 mi. W Park Point, 8000 ft, August 8, 1956; ad. [Male],      69262, shot in brushy area on the burn on Wetherill Mesa 2 mi. NNW      Rock Springs, 7900 ft., August 24, 1956.  Nuttall's cottontail in Colorado is in general the cottontail of the highlands, and the three localities just mentioned are on the top of the Mesa Verde.   Sciurus aberti mimus Merriam Abert's Squirrel       _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: [Male], MV 7872/507, prepared      by D. Watson, killed by a car \"near\" the Park Well on September 24,      1937; [Female] (an unnumbered cased skin only), found dead      \"near\" the Park Well on June 21, 1937.  Since 1934 these squirrels have been observed and recorded each year except in 1938, 1943, 1947, 1953, 1957, and 1958. The 77 reported observations can be grouped as follows: 11 from within a mile of the entrance to the Park, 14 from the North Rim or higher parts of canyons adjacent to it, 38 from Chapin Mesa south of Far View, and 14 not classifiable. The large number of observations on Chapin Mesa, chiefly in the vicinity of Park Headquarters, indicates the presence of more observers rather than more squirrels in this area.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus fremonti (Audubon and Bachman) Red Squirrel       _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: MV 7843/507, Chickaree Draw,      Prater Canyon, 1935, C.W. Quaintance and Lloyd White; [Female],      69264, no embryos, 1/4 mi. NNW Middle Well, Prater Canyon, 7600      ft., August 31, 1956.  Red squirrels, or chickarees as they are called in Colorado, are known from only one place on the Mesa Verde, a side canyon on the west side of Prater Canyon above Middle Well. This side canyon has been named Chickaree Draw by C.W. Quaintance, who, with Lloyd White, studied the chickaree there in 1935. Quaintance reported the small colony at 7800 feet elevation in Douglas fir beneath which were found piles of cones from which the seeds had been eaten by the chickarees. On May 29, 1935, White observed a chickaree eating green oak leaves. On June 3, 1935, a nest was found in an old hollow snag up under the rim rock; there were four young squirrels in the nest. At least one nest was in a juniper and was composed mostly of oak leaves and grass. One nest twenty-five feet from the ground in a Douglas fir was composed of oak leaves and finely shredded cedar bark. In August, 1956, I found these squirrels in the same area and I shot one specimen. Other chickarees were seen and heard and the characteristic piles of parts of Douglas fir cones still attest to their presence. On September 1, 1953, D. Watson observed a pair of chickarees in Prater Canyon. The only other specific record in the files at the Park is of two seen in a branch of Soda Canyon in late 1956. Jean Pinkley tells me that chickarees have been observed in 1958 and 1959 at several other localities from Prater Canyon to the hill at the head of Navajo Canyon. The extent to which increased observations indicate an increase in number of chickarees is uncertain, since the amounts of time spent in the field and the percentage of observations recorded are not known.   Marmota flaviventris luteola A.H. Howell Yellow-bellied Marmot  Records are available of observations at 14 different places in the Park and in 19 different years between 1930 and 1960. Approximately two-thirds of the observations have been on Prater Grade or in upper Prater Canyon or in upper Morfield Canyon. On the morning of August 24, 1956, Harold Shepherd and I heard the whistle of an animal that he was certain was a marmot, 2 mi. NNW of Rock Springs at the west rim of Wetherill Mesa. Mr. Shepherd has worked in areas occupied by marmots for years in southwestern Colorado. Wetherill Mesa is the locality farthest west in the Park where marmots are known to occur. They occur as far south as Cliff Palace.   Cynomys gunnisoni zuniensis Hollister Gunnison's Prairie Dog       _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: MV 7836/507, Prater Canyon, 7600      ft., C.W. Quaintance and L. White, May 24, 1935; [Female], MV      7847/507, head of Prater Canyon, June 13, 1935, C.W. Quaintance      (the skin is on display); MV 7887/507, Prater Canyon, September 1,      1939.  C.W. Quaintance in reports on the results of his work in 1935 included the following information:  On February 20 in Prater Canyon Ranger Markley noticed that prairie dogs were active although about three feet of snow lay on the ground. Between April 15 and May 15 approximately 500 prairie dogs were in Prater Canyon above Lower Well; through field glasses 350 were counted. Young were first noted in Prater Canyon on July 12. Quaintance and Lloyd White had under observation two bulky nests of the red-tailed hawk in the tops of tall Douglas firs in side draws of Prater Canyon. Quaintance found near the rimrock a quarter of a mile from the prairie-dog town the skeletons of two prairie dogs between a sliver of a dead pinyon branch and the branch itself. Another skeleton lay on a dead limb fifteen feet from the ground. A red-tailed hawk once was observed to swoop down, seize a prairie dog and fly down the canyon. The four colonies found in the Park were in Prater Canyon, in Morfield Canyon, in the east fork of School Section Canyon, and in Whites Canyon. The last two were smaller colonies than the first two.  Prairie dogs were observed away from these colonies. On June 20 a young prairie dog ran into a culvert on the Knife Edge Section of the road. Others were observed on the north side of the road, at the head of the east prong of School Section Canyon, on the road west of Park Point, and on the road at the head of Long Canyon five miles from the nearest known colony in the Park. Possibly this last individual came from the Montezuma Valley north of the Park. Mr. Prater, after whom Prater Canyon is named, homesteaded on the Mesa Verde in 1899. He informed Quaintance that prairie dogs were present in Morfield Canyon prior to 1900 but were not in Prater Canyon in 1899. Prater said he drowned out a few that came into Prater Canyon before 1914. In 1942, Chief Ranger Faha wrote in his Annual Animal Census Report that he had interviewed an old time resident (name not noted) who stated that prairie dogs were not present on the Mesa Verde until about 1905 or 1906 and that Helen Morfield, the daughter of Judge Morfield who homesteaded in Morfield Canyon, brought the first prairie dogs on the Mesa Verde. Estimates of the prairie-dog population in the Annual Animal Census Reports for 1935 through 1941 were: 1935--800, 1936--650, 1937--650, 1938--650, 1939--no report, 1940--1500 and increasing, 1941--slight decrease. After 1942 more adequate records were kept by Chief Ranger Wade and other Park Service personnel.  On August 9, 1943, occupied burrows of prairie dogs were found to be thinly scattered down Prater Canyon from the head of the canyon at the Maintenance Camp to a point about one hundred feet below the lower well. The largest concentration was in the vicinity of the upper well near Prater's Cabin. Little new digging that would indicate a spreading population was noticed. Seemingly desirable, but unoccupied, habitat extended at least two miles south of the inhabited area. In Morfield Canyon, burrows were found from a point one hundred yards north of the fence at the south boundary of Section 17, south for a mile and one-half to a point one-third of a mile into Section 29. The greatest concentration was in the vicinity of Morfield Well. South of this point the burrows were found only along the narrow dry sides of the canyon and in sage-covered areas at slightly higher elevations than the rest of the floor of the canyon. Seemingly desirable habitat extended at least three miles to the south and one mile to the north of the occupied area. The report of the study in 1943 concluded with the statement that artificial control by poisoning would be unwise and unnecessary. Requests were being made at that time to exterminate prairie dogs in the Park on the basis of the unproved assumption that prairie dogs move from the Park to surrounding range land where extermination was then being attempted by poisoning.  On August 10, 1944, no occupied burrows were found in Whites Canyon or the east fork of School Section Canyon. A heavy rain on August 9 made accurate count of occupied burrows possible. In Prater Canyon the occupied area extended 200 feet south of the area occupied in 1943. In Morfield Canyon no change had occurred. North of the fence in Morfield Canyon 130 occupied burrows were counted. More than one hole, if judged to be part of the same burrow system, were counted as one. The vegetation within the colony had continued to improve in spite of the large population of prairie dogs.  On "]]]
