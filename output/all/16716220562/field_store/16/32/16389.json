These children must not be allowed to [1] eat certain food, nor to breathe the cold air, because there is danger in it; when they perspire, they must be loaded down with coverings until their bodies become dry,—and the mother of one child is often busier than [5] the mother of eight.  Great charity and humility is necessary in this work of healing. The loving patience of Jesus, we must strive to emulate. “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself” has daily to be exemplified; and, although [10] skepticism and incredulity prevail in places where one would least expect it, it harms not; for if serving Christ, Truth, of what can mortal opinion avail? Cast not your pearls before swine; but if you cannot bring peace to all, you can to many, if faithful laborers in His [15] vineyard.  Looking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally reflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease seems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to many minds, to be depicted in some future time upon [20] the body. A periodical of our own will counteract to some extent this public nuisance; for through our paper, at the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able to reach many homes with healing, purifying thought. A great work already has been done, and a greater work [25] yet remains to be done. Oftentimes we are denied the results of our labors because people do not understand the nature and power of metaphysics, and they think that health and strength would have returned natu- rally without any assistance. This is not so much from [30] a lack of justice, as it is that the _mens populi_ is not suffi- ciently enlightened on this great subject. More thought  [Page 8.]  is given to material illusions than to spiritual facts. If [1] we can aid in abating suffering and diminishing sin, we shall have accomplished much; but if we can bring to the general thought this great fact that drugs do not, cannot, produce health and harmony, since “in Him [5] [Mind] we live, and move, and have our being,” we shall have done more.”     Love Your Enemies.   Who is thine enemy that thou shouldst love him? Is it a creature or a thing outside thine own creation? [10]  Can you see an enemy, except you first formulate this enemy and then look upon the object of your own conception? What is it that harms you? Can height, or depth, or any other creature separate you from the Love that is omnipresent good,—that blesses infinitely [15] one and all?  Simply count your enemy to be that which defiles, defaces, and dethrones the Christ-image that you should reflect. Whatever purifies, sanctifies, and consecrates human life, is not an enemy, however much we suffer in [20] the process. Shakespeare writes: “Sweet are the uses of adversity.” Jesus said: “Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you _falsely_, for my sake; ... for so persecuted they the prophets which were before [25] you.”  The Hebrew law with its “Thou shalt not,” its de- mand and sentence, can only be fulfilled through the gospel’s benediction. Then, “Blessed are ye,” inso-  [Page 9.]  much as the consciousness of good, grace, and peace, [1] comes through affliction rightly understood, as sanctified by the purification it brings to the flesh,—to pride, self- ignorance, self-will, self-love, self-justification. Sweet, indeed, are these uses of His rod! Well is it that the [5] Shepherd of Israel passes all His flock under His rod into His fold; thereby numbering them, and giving them refuge at last from the elements of earth.  “Love thine enemies” is identical with “Thou hast no enemies.” Wherein is this conclusion relative to [10] those who have hated thee without a cause? Simply, in that those unfortunate individuals are virtually thy best friends. Primarily and ultimately, they are doing thee good far beyond the present sense which thou canst entertain of good. [15]  Whom we call friends seem to sweeten life’s cup and to fill it with the nectar of the gods. We lift this cup to our lips; but it slips from our grasp, to fall in frag- ments before our eyes. Perchance, having tasted its tempting wine, we become intoxicated; become lethar- [20] gic, dreamy objects of self-satisfaction; else, the con- tents of this cup of selfish human enjoyment having lost its flavor, we voluntarily set it aside as tasteless and unworthy of human aims.  And wherefore our failure longer to relish this fleet- [25] ing sense, with its delicious forms of friendship, wherewith mortals become educated to gratification in personal pleasure and trained in treacherous peace? Because it is the great and only danger in the path that winds upward. A false sense of what consti- [30] tutes happiness is more disastrous to human progress than all that an enemy or enmity can obtrude upon  [Page 10.]  the mind or engraft upon its purposes and achievements [1] wherewith to obstruct life’s joys and enhance its sor- rows.  We have no enemies. Whatever envy, hatred, revenge —the most remorseless motives that govern mortal mind [5] —whatever these try to do, shall “work together for good to them that love God.”  Why?  Because He has called His own, armed them, equipped them, and furnished them defenses impregnable. Their [10] God will not let them be lost; and if they fall they shall rise again, stronger than before the stumble. The good cannot lose their God, their help in times of trouble. If they mistake the divine command, they will recover it, countermand their order, retrace their steps, and [15] reinstate His orders, more assured to press on safely. The best lesson of their lives is gained by crossing swords with temptation, with fear and the besetments of evil; insomuch as they thereby have tried their strength and proven it; insomuch as they have found [20] their strength made perfect in weakness, and their fear is self-immolated.  This destruction is a moral chemicalization, wherein old things pass away and all things become new. The worldly or material tendencies of human affections and [25] pursuits are thus annihilated; and this is the advent of spiritualization. Heaven comes down to earth, and mortals learn at last the lesson, “I have no enemies.”  Even in belief you have but one (that, not in reality), and this one enemy is yourself—your erroneous belief [30] that you have enemies; that evil is real; that aught but good exists in Science. Soon or late, your enemy will  [Page 11.]  wake from his delusion to suffer for his evil intent; to [1] find that, though thwarted, its punishment is tenfold.  Love is the fulfilling of the law: it is grace, mercy, and justice. I used to think it sufficiently just to abide by our State statutes; that if a man should aim a ball at [5] my heart, and I by firing first could kill him and save my own life, that this was right. I thought, also, that if I taught indigent students gratuitously, afterwards assisting them pecuniarily, and did not cease teachi ing the wayward ones at close of the class term, but [10] followed them with precept upon precept; that if my instructions had healed them and shown them the sure way of salvation,—I had done my whole duty to students.  Love metes not out human justice, but divine mercy. If one’s life were attacked, and one could save it only [15] in accordance with common law, by taking another’s, would one sooner give up his own? We must love our enemies in all the manifestations wherein and whereby we love our friends; must even try not to expose their faults, but to do them good whenever opportunity [20] occurs. To mete out human justice to those who per- secure and despitefully use one, is not leaving all retribu- tion to God and returning blessing for cursing. If special opportunity for doing good to one’s enemies occur not, one can include them in his general effort to benefit the [25] race. Because I can do much general good to such as hate me, I do it with earnest, special care—since they permit me no other way, though with tears have I striven for it. When smitten on one cheek, I have turned the other: I have but two to present. [30]  I would enjoy taking by the hand all who love me not, and saying to them, “_I_ love _you_, and would not know-  [Page 12.]  ingly harm you.” _Because_ I thus feel, I say to others: [1] Hate no one; for hatred is a plague-spot that spreads its virus and kills at last. If indulged, it masters us; brings suffering upon suffering to its possessor, through- out time and beyond the grave. If you have been badly [5] wronged, forgive and forget: God will recompense this wrong, and punish, more severely than you could, him who has striven to injure you. Never return evil for evil; and, above all, do not fancy that you have been wronged when you have not been. [10]  The present is ours; the future, big with events. Every man and woman should be to-day a law to him- self, herself,—a law of loyalty to Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. The means for sinning unseen and unpunished have so increased that, unless one be watchful and stead- [15] fast in Love, one’s temptations to sin are increased a hundredfold. Mortal mind at this period mutely works in the interest of both good and evil in a manner least understood; hence the need of watching, and the danger of yielding to temptation from causes that at former [20] periods in human history were not existent. The action and effects of this so-called human mind in its silent argu- ments, are yet to be uncovered and summarily dealt with by divine justice.  In Christian Science, the law of Love rejoices the heart; [25] and Love is Life and Truth. Whatever manifests aught else in its effects upon mankind, demonstrably is not Love. We should measure our love for God by our love for man; and our sense of Science will be measured by our obedience to God,—fulfilling the law of Love, doing good to all; [30] imparting, so far as we reflect them, Truth, Life, and Love to all within the radius of our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],["title","Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#3)"],["body","of thought.  [Page 13.]  The only justice of which I feel at present capable, [1] is mercy and charity toward every one,—just so far as one and all permit me to exercise these sentiments toward them,—taking special care to mind my own business.  The falsehood, ingratitude, misjudgment, and sharp [5] return of evil for good—yea, the real wrongs (if wrong can be real) which I have long endured at the hands of others—have most happily wrought out for me the law of loving mine enemies. This law I now urge upon the solemn consideration of all Christian Scientists. Jesus [10] said, “If ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.”     Christian Theism.   Scholastic theology elaborates the proposition that evil is a factor of good, and that to believe in the reality [15] of evil is essential to a rounded sense of the existence of good.  This frail hypothesis is founded upon the basis of mate- rial and mortal evidence—only upon what the shifting mortal senses confirm and frail human reason accepts. [20] The Science of Soul reverses this proposition, overturns the testimony of the five erring senses, and reveals in clearer divinity the existence of good only; that is, of God and His idea.  This postulate of divine Science only needs to be con- [25] ceded, to afford opportunity for proof of its correctness and the clearer discernment of good.  Seek the Anglo-Saxon term for God, and you will find it to be good; then define good as God, and you will find that good is omnipotence, has all power; it fills [30]  [Page 14.]  all space, being omnipresent; hence, there is neither place [1] nor power left for evil. Divest your thought, then, of the mortal and material view which contradicts the ever- presence and all-power of good; take in only the immor- tal facts which include these, and where will you see or [5] feel evil, or find its existence necessary either to the origin or ultimate of good?  It is urged that, from his original state of perfec- tion, man has fallen into the imperfection that requires evil through which to develop good. Were we to [10] admit this vague proposition, the Science of man could never be learned; for in order to learn Science, we begin with the correct statement, with harmony and its Principle; and if man has lost his Principle and its harmony, from evidences before him he is inca- [15] pable of knowing the facts of existence and its con- comitants: therefore to him evil is as real and eternal as good, God! This awful deception is evil’s umpire and empire, that good, God, understood, forcibly destroys. [20]  What appears to mortals from their standpoint to be the necessity for evil, is proven by the law of opposites to be without necessity. Good is the primitive Princi- ple of man; and evil, good’s opposite, has no Principle, and is not, and cannot be, the derivative of good. [25] Thus evil is neither a primitive nor a derivative, but is suppositional; in other words, a lie that is incapable of proof—therefore, wholly problematical.  The Science of Truth annihilates error, deprives evil of all power, and thereby destroys all error, sin, sickness, [30] disease, and death. But the sinner is not sheltered from suffering from sin: he makes a great reality of evil, iden-  [Page 15.]  tifies himself with it, fancies he finds pleasure in it, and [1] will reap what he sows; hence the sinner must endure the effects of his delusion until he awakes from it.     The New Birth.   St. Paul speaks of the new birth as “waiting for the [5] adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.” The great Nazarene Prophet said, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.” Nothing aside from the spiritualization—yea, the highest Christianization—of thought and desire, can give the true perception of God [10] and divine Science, that results in health, happiness, and holiness.  The new birth is not the work of a moment. It begins with moments, and goes on with years; moments of sur- render to God, of childlike trust and joyful adoption [15] of good; moments of self-abnegation, self-consecration, heaven-born hope, and spiritual love.  Time may commence, but it cannot complete, the new birth: eternity does this; for progress is the law of infinity. Only through the sore travail of mortal mind [20] shall soul as sense be satisfied, and man awake in His likeness. What a faith-lighted thought is this! that mortals can lay off the “old man,” until man is found to be the image of the infinite good that we name God, and the fulness of the stature of man in Christ appears. [25]  In mortal and material man, goodness seems in em- bryo. By suffering for sin, and the gradual fading out of the mortal and material sense of man, thought is de- veloped into an infant Christianity; and, feeding at first on the milk of the Word, it drinks in the sweet revealings [30]  [Page 16.]  of a new and more spiritual Life and Love. These nourish [1] the hungry hope, satisfy more the cravings for immor- tality, and so comfort, cheer, and bless one, that he saith: In mine infancy, this is enough of heaven to come down to earth. [5]  But, as one grows into the manhood or womanhood of Christianity, one finds so much lacking, and so very much requisite to become wholly Christlike, that one saith: The Principle of Christianity is infinite: it is indeed God; and this infinite Principle hath infinite [10] claims on man, and these claims are divine, not human; and man’s ability to meet them is from God; for, being His likeness and image, man must reflect the full dominion of Spirit—even its supremacy over sin, sick- ness, and death. [15]  Here, then, is the awakening from the dream of life in matter, to the great fact that _God is the only Life_; that, therefore, we must entertain a higher sense of both God and man. We must learn that God is infinitely more than a person, or finite form, can contain; that [20] God is a divine _Whole_, and _All_, an all-pervading in- telligence and Love, a divine, infinite Principle; and that Christianity is a divine Science. This newly awakened consciousness is wholly spiritual; it emanates from Soul instead of body, and is the new birth begun [25] in Christian Science.  Now, dear reader, pause for a moment with me, earn- estly to contemplate this new-born spiritual altitude; for this statement demands demonstration.  Here you stand face to face with the laws of infinite [30] Spirit, and behold for the first time the irresistible con- flict between the flesh and Spirit. You stand before the  [Page 17.]  awful detonations of Sinai. You hear and record the [1] thunderings of the spiritual law of Life, as opposed to the material law of death; the spiritual law of Love, as opposed to the material sense of love; the law of om- nipotent harmony and good, as opposed to any supposi- [5] titious law of sin, sickness, or death. And, before the flames have died away on this mount of revelation, like the patriarch of old, you take off your shoes—lay aside your material appendages, human opinions and doc- trines, give up your more material religion with its rites [10] and ceremonies, put off your _materia medica_ and hygiene as worse than useless—to sit at the feet of Jesus. Then, you meekly bow before the Christ, the spiritual idea that our great Master gave of the power of God to heal and to save. Then it is that you behold for the first [15] time the divine Principle that redeems man from under the curse of materialism,—sin, disease, and death. This spiritual birth opens to the enraptured understand- ing a much higher and holier conception of the supremacy of Spirit, and of man as His likeness, whereby man reflects [20] the divine power to heal the sick.  A material or human birth is the appearing of a mor- tal, not the immortal man. This birth is more or less prolonged and painful, according to the timely or un- timely circumstances, the normal or abnormal material [25] conditions attending it.  With the spiritual birth, man’s primitive, sinless, spiritual existence dawns on human thought,—through the travail of mortal mind, hope deferred, the perishing pleasure and accumulating pains of sense,—by which [30] one loses himself as matter, and gains a truer sense of Spirit and spiritual man.  [Page 18.]  The purification or baptismals that come from Spirit, [1] develop, step by step, the original likeness of perfect man, and efface the mark of the beast. “Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;” therefore rejoice in tribulation, and wel- [5] come these spiritual signs of the new birth under the law and gospel of Christ, Truth.  The prominent laws which forward birth in the divine order of Science, are these: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me;” “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” [10] These commands of infinite wisdom, translated into the new tongue, their spiritual meaning, signify: Thou shalt love Spirit only, not its opposite, in every God- quality, even in substance; thou shalt recognize thy- self as God’s spiritual child only, and the true man [15] and true woman, the all-harmonious “male and female,” as of spiritual origin, God’s reflection,—thus as chil- dren of one common Parent,—wherein and whereby Father, Mother, and child are the divine Principle and divine idea, even the divine “Us”—one in good, and [20] good in One.  With this recognition man could never separate him- self from good, God; and he would necessarily entertain habitual love for his fellow-man. Only by admitting evil as a reality, and entering into a state of evil [25] thoughts, can we in belief separate one man’s interests from those of the whole human family, or thus attempt to separate Life from God. This is the mistake that causes much that must be repented of and overcome. Not to know what is blessing you, but to believe that [30] aught that God sends is unjust,—or that those whom He commissions bring to you at His demand that which  [Page 19.]  is"]]]
