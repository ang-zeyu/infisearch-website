The battle began within fifteen or twenty minutes of 12 o'clock (noon) and lasted until midnight, and covered the ground from the Howard House along the entire front of the Fifteenth (Logan's) Corps, the Seventeenth (Blair's) on the front of the Sixteenth (which was formed in the rear of the Army), and on to Decatur, where Sprague's Brigade of the Sixteenth Army Corps met and defeated Wheeler's Cavalry--a distance of about seven miles.  The Army of the Tennessee had present on that day at Atlanta and Decatur about 26,000 men; there were 10,000 in the Fifteenth Army Corps, 9,000 in the Sixteenth Corps, and 7,000 in the Seventeenth. About 21,000 of these were in line of battle. Three Brigades of the Sixteenth Corps were absent, the Sixteenth Corps having 5,000 men in a single line which received the attack of the four Divisions of Hardee's Corps, Hardee's left, Cleburn's Division lapping the extreme left of Blair and joining Cheatham's Corps which attacked Blair from the Atlanta front; and, according to Hood, they were joined by the Georgia Militia under General Smith. Extending down the line in front of the Armies of the Ohio and the Cumberland, Stewart's Corps occupied the works and held the lines in front of the Army of the Cumberland. The Sixteenth Army Corps fought in the open ground; the Fifteenth and Seventeenth behind intrenchments.  Where I stood just at the rear of the Sixteenth Army Corps, I could see the entire line of that corps, and could look up and see the enemy's entire front as they emerged from the woods, and I quickly saw that both of my flanks were overlapped by the enemy. Knowing General McPherson was some two miles away, I sent a staff officer to General Giles A. Smith, requesting him to refuse his left and protect the gap between the Seventeenth Corps and my right, which he sent word he would do. Later, as the battle progressed, and I saw no movement on the part of General Smith, I sent another officer to inform him that the enemy were passing my right flank, which was nearly opposite his center, and requested him to refuse his left immediately, or he would be cut off. This officer (Lieutenant D. Sheffly, who belonged to the Signal Corps, and acted as my aide only for the time being) found, on reaching Smith, that he was just becoming engaged; that he had received orders to hold his line, with a promise that other troops would be thrown into the gap.  My second messenger, Lieutenant Sheffly, returning over the road upon which McPherson was a few minutes later shot dead, met the General on the road with a very few attendants, and turned to warn him of his dangerous position, assuring him that the enemy held the woods and were advancing. The General paying no heed to the warning and moving on, my aide turned and followed him. They had proceeded but a short distance into the woods when a sharp command, \"Halt,\" was heard from the skirmish-line of the rebels. Without heeding the command, General McPherson and his party wheeled their horses, and at that moment a heavy volley was poured in, killing McPherson and so frightening the horses that they became unmanageable and plunged into the underbrush in different directions. My aide became separated from the General and the rest of the party, and was knocked from his horse by coming in contact with a tree, and lay for some time in an unconscious condition on the ground. As soon as he was sufficiently recovered he returned on foot to me, having lost his horse and equipments. Of General McPherson he saw nothing after his fall. His watch, crushed by contact with the tree, was stopped at two minutes past 2 o'clock, which fixed the time of General McPherson's death.  General McPherson could not have left his point of observation more than a few minutes when I detected the enemy's advance in the woods some distance to my right, and between that flank and General Blair's rear. Fuller quickly changed front with a portion of his brigade to confront them, and pushing promptly to the attack captured their skirmish-line and drove back their main force. Upon the persons of some of these prisoners we found McPherson's papers, field-glass, etc., which conveyed to me the first knowledge I had of his death; or, rather, as I then supposed, of his capture by the enemy; and seeing that the papers were important I sent them by my Chief of Staff with all haste to General Sherman.  General McPherson, it seems, had just witnessed the decisive grapple of the Sixteenth Corps with the charging columns of the enemy, and, as probably conveying his own reflections at that moment, I quote the language of General Strong, the only staff officer present with him at that critical time:      The General and myself, accompanied only by our orderlies, rode on and     took positions on the right of Dodge's line, and witnessed the     desperate assaults of Hood's army.      The Divisions of Generals Fuller and Sweeney were formed in a single     line of battle in the open fields, without cover of any kind (Fuller's     Division on the right,) and were warmly engaged. The enemy, massed in     columns three or four lines deep, moved out of the dense timber     several hundred yards from General Dodge's position, and after gaining     fairly the open fields, halted and opened a rapid fire upon the     Sixteenth Corps. They, however, seemed surprised to find our infantry     in line of battle, prepared for attack, and after facing for a few     minutes the destructive fire from the Divisions of Generals Fuller and     Sweeney, fell back in disorder to the cover of the woods. Here,     however, their lines were quickly reformed, and they again advanced,     evidently determined to carry the position.      The scene at this time was grand and impressive. It seemed to us that     every mounted officer of the attacking column was riding at the front     of, or on the right or left of, the first line of battle. The     regimental colors waved and fluttered in advance of the lines, and not     a shot was fired by the rebel infantry, although the movement was     covered by a heavy and well-directed fire from artillery, which was     posted in the woods and on higher ground, and which enabled the guns     to bear upon our troops with solid shot and shell, firing over the     attacking column.      It seemed impossible, however, for the enemy to face the sweeping,     deadly fire from Fuller's and Sweeney's Divisions, and the guns of the     Fourteenth Ohio and Welker's Batteries of the Sixteenth Corps fairly     mowed great swaths in the advancing columns. They showed great     steadiness, and closed up the gaps and preserved their alignments; but     the iron and leaden hail which was poured upon them was too much for     flesh and blood to stand, and, before reaching the center of the open     field, the columns were broken up and thrown into great confusion.     Taking advantage of this, General Dodge, with portions of General     Fuller's and General Sweeney's Divisions, with bayonets fixed, charged     the enemy and drove them back to the woods, taking many prisoners.      General McPherson's admiration for the steadiness and determined     bravery of the Sixteenth Corps was unbounded. General Dodge held the     key to the position.      Had the Sixteenth Corps given way the rebel army would have been in     the rear of the Seventeenth and Fifteenth Corps, and would have swept     like an avalanche over our supply trains, and the position of the Army     of the Tennessee would have been very critical, although, without     doubt, the result of the battle would have been in our favor, because     the Armies of the Cumberland and the Ohio were close at hand, and the     enemy would have been checked and routed further on.  General Blair, in his official report of the battle, says:      I witnessed the first furious assault upon the Sixteenth Army Corps,     and its prompt and gallant repulse. It was a fortunate circumstance     for that whole army that the Sixteenth Army Corps occupied the     position I have attempted to describe, at the moment of the attack;     and although it does not become me to comment upon the brave conduct     of the officers and men of that Corps, still I can not refrain from     expressing my admiration for the manner in which the Sixteenth Corps     met and repulsed the repeated and persistent attacks of the enemy.  The Sixteenth Corps has a record in that battle which we seldom see in the annals of war. It met the shock of battle and fired the last shot late that night, as the enemy stubbornly yielded its grasp on Bald Hill. It fought on four parts of the field, and everywhere with equal success. It lost no gun that it took into the engagement, and its losses were almost entirely in killed and wounded--the missing having been captured at Decatur through getting mired in a swamp.  At no time during the Atlanta campaign was there present in the Sixteenth Corps more than two small Divisions of three Brigades each, and at this time these two Divisions were widely scattered; on the Atlanta field only ten Regiments and two Batteries were present, three entire Brigades being absent from the Corps. It was called upon to meet the assault of at least three Divisions or nine Brigades, or at the least forty-nine Regiments, all full to the utmost that a desperate emergency could swell them, impelled by the motive of the preconcerted surprise, and orders from their commander at all hazards to sweep over any and all obstructions; while, on the other hand, the force attacked and surprised was fighting without orders, guided only by the exigency of the moment. Their captures represented forty-nine different Regiments of the enemy. How many more Regiments were included in those nine Brigades I have never been able to learn.

PRIDDEN, M.A.  VICAR OF BROXTED, ESSEX.    \"_Truth_, in her native calmness and becoming moderation, shall  be the object of our homage and pursuit; and we will aim at the  attainment of knowledge for the improvement of our reason, and not  for the gratification of a passion for disputing.\"--_Address of  the Bp of Australia in 1841 to the Church of England Book Society._    LONDON:  JAMES BURNS, 17, PORTMAN STREET,  PORTMAN SQUARE.  1843.      LONDON:  PRINTED BY R. CLAY, BREAD STREET HILL.          *       *       *       *       *     [Illustration: Map of Australia]     PREFACE.   A few words by way of Preface are requisite, in order that the objects of the present Work may be stated to the reader, and that he may also be made acquainted with the sources whence the information here communicated is derived, and from consulting which he may still further inform himself concerning Australia. The aim of the writer of the following pages has been,--while furnishing a description of some of the most flourishing and interesting settlements belonging to the British Crown, which, at the same time, exhibit in contrast to each other the two extremes of savage and civilised life;--to call the attention of his countrymen, both at home and in the colonies, to the evils which have arisen from the absence of moral restraint and religious instruction in colonies of civilised and (nominally) christian men. And although it must in many ways be a disadvantage that the person professing to describe a particular country should have gained all his knowledge of it from the report of others, without ever having himself set foot upon its shores; yet, in one respect at least, this may operate advantageously. He is less likely to have party prejudices or private interests to serve in his account of the land to which he is a total stranger. In consequence, probably, of his being an indifferent and impartial observer, not one of our Australian colonies wears in his eye the appearance of a perfect paradise; but then, on the other hand, there is not one of those fine settlements which prejudice urges him to condemn, as though it were barren and dreary as the Great Sahara itself. And the same circumstance--his never having breathed the close unwholesome air of colonial party-politics--will render it less likely that his judgment respecting persons and disputed opinions should be unduly biassed. There will be more probability of his judging upon right _principles_, and although his facts may (in some instances, unavoidably) be less minutely accurate than an inhabitant of the country would have given, yet they may be less coloured and less partially stated. Instead of giving his own observations as an eye-witness, fraught with his own particular views, he can calmly weigh the opposite statements of men of different opinions, and between the two he is more likely to arrive at the truth. With regard to the present Work, however impartial the author has endeavoured to be, however free he may be from colonial passions and interests, he does not wish to deceive the reader by professing a total freedom from all prejudice. If this were desirable, it is impossible; it is a qualification which no writer, or reader either, possesses. But thus much may be stated, that all his prejudices are in favour of those institutions with which it has pleased God to bless his native land. In a volume that is intended to form part of a series called \"The Englishman's Library,\" it may be permitted, surely, to acknowledge a strong and influencing attachment to the Sovereign, the Church, and the Constitution of England.  The object and principles of the present volume being thus plainly set forth, it remains only to mention some of the sources whence the information contained in it is derived. To the Travels of Captain Grey on the western coast of New Holland, and to those of Major Mitchell in the interior, the first portion of this Work is deeply indebted, and every person interested in the state of the natives, or fond of perusing travels in a wild and unknown region, may be referred to these four volumes,[1] where they will find that the extracts here given are but a specimen of the stores of amusement and information which they contain. Captain Sturt's \"Expeditions\" and Mr. Oxley's \"Journal\" are both interesting works, but they point rather to the progress of discovery in New Holland than to the actual state of our local knowledge of it. Dr. Lang's two volumes upon New South Wales are full of information from one who has lived there many years, and his faults are sufficiently obvious for any intelligent reader to guard against. Mr. Montgomery Martin's little book is a very useful compendium, and those that desire to know more particulars concerning the origin of the first English colony in New Holland may be referred to Collins's account of it. Various interesting particulars respecting the religious state of the colonies in Australia have been derived from the correspondence in the possession of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, free access to which was allowed through the kind introduction of the Rev. C. B. Dalton. Many other sources of information have been consulted, among which the Reports of the Parliamentary Committee upon Transportation, in 1837 and 1838; and that of the Committee upon South Australia, in 1841, must not be left unnoticed. Neither may the work of Judge Burton upon Religion and Education in New South Wales be passed over in silence; for, whatever imperfections may be found in his book,[2] the facts there set forth are valuable, and, for the most part, incontrovertible, and the principles it exhibits are excellent. From the works just mentioned the reader may, should he feel inclined, verify for himself the facts stated in the ensuing pages, or pursue his inquiries further. In the meantime, he cannot do better than join the author of the little book which he holds in his hand, in an humble and earnest prayer to Almighty God, that, in this and in every other instance, whatever may be the feebleness and imperfection of human efforts, all things may be made to work together for good towards promoting the glory of God, the extension of Christ's kingdom, and the salvation of mankind.    [1] Published, all of them, by T. and W. Boone, London, to whom it is   only just to acknowledge their kindness in permitting the use that has   been made of these two publications in the first portion of the present   Work.    [2] See Dr. Ullathorne's Reply to Burton, especially at p. 5, where it   appears that the judge was not quite impartial in one of his statements.   Dr. Ullathorne himself has, in his 98 pages, contrived to crowd in at   least twice as many misrepresentations as Burton's 321 pages contain.   But that is no excuse. The Romish Church may need, or seem to need,   such support. The cause defended by Judge Burton needs it not.     #Contents.#   INTRODUCTION.
