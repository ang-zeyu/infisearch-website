I’d gien ower wark at seventy,     But I gat agate once more; “I’ll live for my country, not on her”     Were my words on t’ fettlers’ floor.  Shoo’s putten her trust i’ us workers,     We’ll save her, niver fear; Feight for her, live for her, dee for her,     Her childer that loves her dear.  Eight o’ my grandsons has fallen,     My youngest lad’s crippled i’ t’ arm; But I’ll give her choose-what[5] shoo axes,     Afore I’ll see her tak harm.  T’ war is a curse an’ a blessin’,     If fowks could understan’; It’s brokken my home an’ my childer,     But it’s made me an Englishman.   [1] Until.   [2] Starve.   [3] Arrogant.   [4] Patches.

But yit afore all’s ovver,     An’ I lig cowd as snow, I’ll hear once more them owd church bells     O’ Kirkby Overblow.  Mony a neet an’ mornin’     I’ve heerd yon church bells peal; An’ how I’ve threaped an’ cursed ’em     When I was strong an’ weel! Gert, skelpin’, chunterin’ taistrils,[1]     All janglin’ in a row! Ay, mony a time I’ve cursed yon bells     O’ Kirkby Overblow.  When you hear yon church bells ringin’,     You can’t enjoy your sin; T’ bells clutches at your heart-strings     I’ t’ ale-house ower your gin. At pitch-an’-toss you’re laikin’,     Down theer i’ t’ wood below; An’ then you damn them rowpy[2] bells     O’ Kirkby Overblow.  An’ when I’ve set off poachin’     At back-end o’ the year, Wi’ ferret, bag an’ snickle,[3]     Church bells have catched my ear. “Thou’s takken t’ road to Hell, lad,     Wheer t’ pit-fire’s bumin’ slow;” That’s what yon bells kept shoutin’ out     At Kirkby Overblow.  But now I’m owd an’ bed-fast,     I ommost like their sound, Ringin’ so clear i’ t’ star-leet     Across the frozzen ground. I niver mell on[4] parsons,     There ain’t a prayer I know; But prayer an’ sarmon’s i’ yon bells     O’ Kirkby Overblow.  Six boards o’ gooid stout ellum     Is what I’ll want to-morn; Then lay me low i’ t’ church-yard     Aneath t’ owd crooked thorn. I’ll have no funeral sarvice     When I’m browt down below, But let ’em touzle t’ bells like mad     At Kirkby Overblow.  I don’t know wheer I’m boun’ for,     It hardlins can be Heaven; I’ve sinned more sins nor most men     ’Twixt one an’ seven-seven. But this I’ll tak my oath on:     Wheeriver I mun go, I’ll hark to t’ echoes o’ yon bells     O’ Kirkby Overblow.   [1] Unwieldy, grumbling rascals.   [2] Hoarse.   [3] Snare.   [4] Meddle with.     The Gardener and the Robin   Why! Bobbie, so thou’s coom agean!     I’m fain to see thee here; It’s lang sin I’ve set een on thee,     It’s ommost hauf a yeer. What’s that thou says? Thou’s taen a wife     An’ raised a family. It seems thou’s gien ’em all the slip     Now back-end’s drawin’ nigh.  I mun forgi’e thee; we’re owd friends,     An’ fratchin’s not for us; Blackbirds an’ spinks[1] I can’t abide,     At doves an’ crows I cuss. But thou’ll noan steal my strawberries,     Or nip my buds o’ plum; Most feather-fowl I drive away,     But thou can awlus coom.  Ay, that’s thy place, at top o’ t’ clod,     Thy heead cocked o’ one side, Lookin’ as far-learnt as a judge.     Is that a worrm thou’s spied? By t’ Megs! he’s well-nigh six inch lang,     An’ reed as t’ gate i’ t’ park; If thou don’t mesh him up a bit,     He’ll gie thee belly-wark.  My missus awlus lets me know     I’m noan so despert thin; If I ate sausages as thou     Eats worrms, I’d brust my skin! Howd on! leave soom for t’ mowdiwarps[2]     That scrats down under t’ grund ; Of worrms, an’ mawks,[3] an’ bummel-clocks[4]     Thou’s etten hauf a pund.  So now thou’ll clear thy pipes an’ sing:     Grace after meat, I s’pose. Thou looks as holy as t’ owd saint     I’ church wi’ t’ brokken nose. Thou’s plannin’ marlocks[5] all the time,     Donned i’ thy sowdier coat; An’ what we tak for hymns o’ praise     Is just thy fratchin’ note.  I’ve seen thee feightin’ theer on t’ lawn,     Beneath yon laurel tree; Thy neb was reed wi’ blooid, thou looked     As chuffy[6] as could be. Thou’s got no mense nor morals, Bob,     But weel I know thy charm. Ay, thou can stand upon my spade.     I’ll niver do thee harm.   [1] Chaffinches.   [2] Moles.   [3] Maggots.   [4] Beetles.

O dowly, dowly was that neet     He stole lile Doad away!  ’Twas Whissuntide we wedded,     Next Easter he was born, Just as t’ last star i’ t’ April sky     Had faded into t’ morn. Throstles were singin, canty,[1]     For they’d their young i’ t’ nest; But birds don’t know a mother’s love     That howds her barn to t’ breast.  When wark was ower i’ summer,     I nussed him on my knees; An’ Mike browt home at lowsin’-time     Wild rasps an’ strawberries. We used to sit on t’ door-sill     I’ t’ leet o’ t’ harvist-moon, While our lile Doad would clench his fists     An’ suck his toes an’ croon.  But when t’ mell-sheaf[2] was gotten,     An’ back-end days set in, Wi’ frost at neet an’ roke[3] by day,     His face gate pinched an’ thin. We niver knew what ailed him,     He faded like a floor, He faded same as skies’ll fade     When t’ sun dips into t’ moor.  Church bells on Kersmas mornin’     Rang out so merrily, But cowd an’ dreesome were our hearts:     We knew lile Doad must dee. He lay so still in his creddle,     An’ slowly he dwined away, While[4] I laid two pennies on his een     On Holy Innocents’ Day.  The Lord’s bin hard on me, Sir,     He’s stown my barn away. O, dowly, dowly was that neet     He stole lile Doad away!   [1] Briskly.   [2] The last sheaf of the harvest.   [3] Mist.   [4] Until.     His Last Sail   GRANDFATHER  T’ watter is blue i’ t’ offin’,     An’ blue is t’ sky aboon; Swallows are settin’ sou’ard,     An’ wanin’ is t’ harvist moon. Ower lang I’ve bin cowerin’ idle     I’ my neuk by t’ fire-side; I’ll away yance mair i’ my coble,     I’ll away wi’ t’ ebbin’ tide.  MALLY  Nay, Gransir, thoo moant gan sailin’,     Thoo mun bide at yam to-neet; At eighty-two thoo sudn’t think     O’ t’ Whitby fishin’ fleet. North cone’s up on t’ flagstaff,     There’s a cap-full o’ wind i’ t’ bay; T’ waves wap loud on t’ harbour bar,     Thoo can hardlins fish to-day.  GRANDFATHER  It’s leansome here i’ t’ hoose, lass,     When t’ fisher-folk’s at sea, Watchin’ yon eldin[1] set i’ t’ fire     Bleeze up, dwine doon, an’ dee. An’ t’ sea-gulls they coom flyin’     Aboon our red roof-tiles; They call me doon the chimley,     An’ laugh at other whiles.  “There’s mack’rel oot at sea, lad,”     Is what I hear ’em say; “Their silver scales are glestrin’ breet,     Look oot across the bay; But mack’rel’s not for thee, lad,     For thoo’s ower weak to sail.” My een wi’ saut tears daggle[2]     When I hear their mockin’ tale.  MALLY  Dean’t mind their awfish[3] skreekin’,     They ’tice folk to their death; Then ride aboon yon billows     An’ gloor at them beneath. They gloor at eenless corpses     Slow driftin’ wi’ the tide, Deep doon amang the weedy wrack,     Wheer t’ scaly fishes glide.  GRANDFATHER  I’d fain lig wi’ my kinsfolk,     Fore-elders, brothers, sons, Wheer t’ star-fish shine like twinklin’ leets,     An’ t’ spring-tide watter runs. T’ kirkyard’s good for farm-folk,     That ploo an’ milk their kye, But I could sleep maist soondly     Wheer t’ ships gan sailin’ by.  T’ grave is whisht[4] an’ foulsome,     But clean is t’ saut sea-bed; Thoo can hark to t’ billows dancin’     To t’ tune o’ t’ tide owerhead. Yon wreaths o’ floors i’ t’ kirkyard     Sean wither an’ fade away, But t’ sea-tang wreaths round a droon’d man’s head     Will bide while Judgment Day.  Sae fettle[5] my owd blue coble,     I kessen’d her “Mornin’ Star,” An’ I’ll away through t’ offin’     Wheer t’ skooals o’ mack’rel are. Thoo can look for my boat i’ t’ harbour,     When thoo’s said thy mornin’ psalm; Mebbe I’ll fill my fish-creel full—     Mebbe I’ll nean coom yam.   [1] Kindling.   [2] Grow moist.   [3] Elfish.

Thou hast done enough i’ thy time,     Tewed i’ t’ house an’ wrowt at loom; Just for once thou mun sit idle,     Feet on t’ hear’stone, fingers toom.[1]  One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:     So I promised when we wed. Then thy een were glest’rin’ clearer     Nor the stars aboon us spread. If they’re dimmer now, they’re tend’rer,     An’ yon wrinkles on thy face Tell a lesson true as t’ Bible,     Speik o’ charity an’ grace.  One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:     We’ve supped sorrow, tasted joy, But our love has grown sincerer,     Gethered strength nowt can destroy. Love is like an oak i’ t’ forest,     Ivery yeer it adds a ring; Love is like yon ivin tendrils,     Ivery day they closer cling.  One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:     Time’s the shuttle, life’s the yarn. Have thy crosses seemed severer     ’Cause thou niver had a barn? Mebbe I sud not have loved thee     Hauf so weel, if I mud share All our secret thowts wi’ childer,     Twinin’ round my owd arm-chair.  One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:     ’Tis our gowden weddin’ day. There sal coom no gaumless fleerer     To break in upon our play.

But what are facts an’ figures ’side o’ truths     We’ve bowt wi’ childer’ tears an’ brokken lives? An’ what are argiments o’ cockered youths     To set agean yon groans o’ caitiff[3] wives?  ’Twere “hungry forties” when I were a lad,     An’ fowks were clemmed, an’ weak i’ t’ airm an’ brain; We lived on demick’d[4] taties, bread gone sad,     An’ wakkened up o’ neets croodled[5] wi’ pain.  When t’ quartern loaf were raised to one and four,     We’d watter-brewis, swedes stown out o’ t’ field; Farmers were t’ landlords’ jackals, an’ us poor     Tewed in Egyptian bondage unrepealed.  I mind them times when lads marched down our street     Wi’ penny loaves on pikes all steeped i’ blooid; “It’s breead or blooid,” they cried. “We’ve nowt to eat;     To Hell wi’ all that taxes t’ people’s fooid.”  There was a papist duke[6] that com aleng     Wi’ curry powders, an’ he telled our boss That when fowk’s bellies felt pination’s teng,[7]     For breead, yon stinkin’ powders they mun soss.[8]  I went to wark when I were eight yeer owd;     I tended galloways an’ sammed up coils. ’Twere warm i’ t’ pit, aboon ’t were despert cowd,     An’ clothes were nobbut spetches,[9] darns an’ hoils.  Thro’ six to eight I worked, then two mile walk     Across yon sumpy[10] fields to t’ kitchen door. I’ve often fainted, face as white as chalk,     Then fall’n lang-length upon wer cobble-floor.  My mother addled seven and six a week,     Slavin’ all t’ day at Akeroyd’s weyvin’-shed: Fayther at t’ grunstone wrowt, while he fell sick;     Steel filin’s gate intul his lungs, he said.  I come thee then no thank for all thy speyks,     Thou might as weel have spared thisen thy pains; I see no call to laik at ducks an’ drakes     Wi’ t’ bitter truth that’s burnt intul our brains.  “Corn laws be damned,” said dad i’ forty-eight;     “Corn laws be damned,” say I i’ nineteen-five. Tariff reform, choose, how, will have to wait     Down Yelland way, so lang as I’m alive.  If thou an’ thine sud tax us workers’ fooid,     An’ thrust us back in our owd misery, May t’ tears o’ our deead childer thin thy blooid,     An’ t’ curse o’ t’ “hungry forties” leet on thee.

The Flowers of Knaresborough Forest   But now they are moaning, on ilka green loaning The Flowers of the Forest are a’ wede away. _Jane Elliot_ (1727-1805).  O! day-time is weary, an’ dark o’ dusk dreary     For t’ lasses i’ t’ mistal, or rakin’ ower t’ hay; When t’ kye coom for strippin’, or t’ yowes for their clippin’,     We think on our sowdiers now gone reet away.  The courtin’-gate’s idle, nae lad flings his bridle     Ower t’ yak-stoup,[1] an’ sleely cooms seekin’ his may; The trod by the river is green as a sliver,[2]     For the Flowers o’ the Forest have all stown away.  At Marti’mas hirin’s, nae ribbins, nae tirin’s,     When t’ godspenny’s[3] addled, an’ t’ time’s coom for play; Nae Cheap-Jacks, nae dancin’, wi’ t’ teamster’ clogs prancin ,     The Flowers o’ the Forest are all flown a way.  When at neet church is lowsin’, an’ t’ owd ullet is rousin’     Hissel i’ our laithe,[4] wheer he’s slummered all t’ day, Wae’s t’ heart! but we misses our lads’ saftest kisses,     Now the Flowers o’ the Forest are gone reet away.  Ploo-lads frae Pannal have crossed ower the Channel,     Shipperds frae Fewston have taen the King’s pay, Thackrays frae Dacre have sold ivery acre;     Thou’ll finnd ne’er a delver[5] frae Haverah to Bray.  When t’ north wind is howlin’, an’ t’ west wind is yowlin’,     It’s for t’ farm lads at sea that us lasses mun pray; Tassey-Will o’ t’ new biggin, keepin’ watch i’ his riggin ,     Lile Jock i’ his fo’c’sle, torpedoed i’ t’ bay.  Mony a lass now is weepin’ for her marrow that’s sleepin’,     Wi’ nae bield for his corp but the cowd Flanthers clay; He’ll ne’er lift his limmers,[6] he’ll ne’er wean his gimmers[7]:     Ay, there’s Flowers o’ the Forest are withered away.

The Miller by the Shore an East Coast Chanty   The miller by the shore am I,     A man o’ despert sense; I’ve fotty different soorts o’ ways     O’ addlin’ honest pence. Good wheat and wuts and barley-corns     My mill grinds all t’ day lang ; Frae faave ’o t’ morn while seven o’ t’ neet     My days are varra thrang.  Chorus  I mill a bit, I till a bit,     I dee all maks ’o jobs, Frae followin’ ploos and hollowin’ coos     To mendin’ chairs and squabs.[1] Oh! folks they laugh and girn at me,     I niver tak it ill; If I’s the Jack ’o ivery trade,     They all bring grist to t’ mill.  I tend my hunderd yakker farm,     An’ milk my Kyloe kye. I’ve Lincoln yowes an’ Leicester tups     An’ twenty head ’o wye.[2] I’ve stirks to tak to Scarbro’ mart,     I’ve meers for farmers’ gigs; And oh! I wish that you could see     My laatle sookin’ pigs.  I mill a bit. ...  When summer days graws lang an’ breet,     Oot cooms my “Noah’s Arks,” Wheer city folk undriss theirsels     An’ don my bathin’ sarks.[3] An’ when they git on land agean,     I rub’ em smooth as silk; Then bring’ em oot, to fill their weeams,     My parkin ceakes an’ milk.  I mill a bit. ...  I pike[4] stray timmer on the shore,     An’ cuvins[5] on the scar; I know wheer crabs ’ll hugger up,[6]     I know wheer t’ lobsters are. I’ve cobles fishin’ oot i’ t’ bay,     For whitings, dabs and cods, I’ve herrin’ trawls and salmon nets,     I’ve hooks and lines and rods.  I mill a bit. ...  On darksome neets, back-end ’o t’ yeer,     I like another sport; I row my boat wheer t’ lugger lies,     Coom frae some foreign port; A guinea in a coastguard’s poke     Will mak him steck his een ; So he says nowt when I coom yam     Wi’ scent and saccharine.  I mill a bit. ...   [1] Settles.   [2] Heifers.   [3] Shirts.   [4] Pick up.   [5] Periwinkles.   [6] Crowd together.     The Bride’s Homecoming           A weddin’, a woo,         A clog an’ a shoe, A pot full o’ porridge; away we go!             _A Yorkshire Wedding-Rhyme_.  Thoo mun hod on tight, my darlin’,     We’ve mony a beck to cross; Twix’ thy father’s hoose an’ mine, love,     There’s a vast o’ slacks an’ moss. But t’ awd mare, shoo weant whemmle[1]     Though there’s twee on her back astride; Shoo’s as prood as me, is Snowball,     Noo I’s fetchin’ heame my bride.         A weddin’, a woo,         A clog an’ a shoe, A pot full o’ porridge; away we go!  Gow! but I feel sae leetsome,     Sin I’ve lived to see this day; My heart is like a blackbod’s     Efter a shoor i’ May. I’ t’ sky aboon nea lairock     Has sae mich reet to sing As I have, noo I’ve wedded     T’ lile lass o’ Fulsa Ing.         A weddin’, a woo,         A clog an’ a shoe, A pot full o’ porridge; away we go!  Does ta hear yon watter bubblin’,     Deep doon i’ t’ moorland streams? It soonds like childer’ voices     When they’re laughin’ i’ their dreams. An’ look at yon lang-tailed pyots,[2]     There s three on ’em, I’ll uphod! Folks say that three’s for a weddin’,     Ay, a pyot’s a canny bod.         A weddin’, a woo,         A clog an’ a shoe, A pot full o’ porridge; away we go!  I love to feel thee clingin’     Wi’ thy hands aroond my breast; Thy bosom’s leetly heavin’,     Like a ship on t’ saut waves’ crest. An’ thy breath is sweet as t’ breezes,     That cooms ower t’ soothern hills, When t’ violet blaws i’ t’ springtime     Wi’ t’ yollow daffydills.         A weddin’, a woo,         A clog an’ a shoe, A pot full o’ porridge; away we go!  Is ta gittin’ tired, my honey,     We’ll be heame i’ hafe an hour; Thoo’ll see our hoose an’ staggarth,     Wi’ t’ birk-trees bendin’ ower. There’s a lillilow[3] i’ our cham’er     To welcome my viewly bride ; An’ sean we’ll be theer oorsels, lass,     Liggin’ cosy side by side.         A weddin’, a woo,         A clog an’ a shoe, A pot full o’ porridge; away we go!   [1] Stumble.   [2] Magpies.   [3] Light.     The Artist   Lang-haired gauvies[1] coom my way, drawin’ t’ owd abbey an’ brig,     All their crack is o’ Art-staities an’ picturs an’ paints; Want to put me on their canvas, donned i’ my farmer’s rig,     Tell me I’m pairt o’ t’ scenery, stained-glass windeys an’ saints.  I reckon I’m artist an’ all, though I niver gave it a thowt;     Breeder o’ stock is my trade, Mike Pullan o’ t’ Abbey Close. What sud a farmer want wi’ picturs that brass has bowt?     All his art is i’ t’ mistal, wheer t’ heifers are ranged i’ rows.  Look at yon pedigree bull, wi’ an eye as breet as a star,     An’ a coat that shines like velvet, when it catches t’ glent o’ t’     sun; Hark to him bealin’ for t’ cows, wi’ a voice like t’ thunner on t’ scar,     Watch them sinews i’ t’ neck, ripplin’ wi’ mischief an’ fun.  Three generations o’ men have lived their lives for yon bull,     Tewed at his keep all t’ day, dreamed o’ his sleekness all t’ neet; Moulded the bugth o’ his buttocks, fashioned the breadth o’ his skull—     Ivery one on ’em artists, sculptors o’ butcher’s meat.  What are your Rubens and Vandykes anent the craft that is Breed?     Anent the art that is Life, what’s figures o’ bronze or stone? Us farmers ’ll mould you models, better nor statties that’s deead—     Strength that is wick i’ the flesh, Beauty that’s bred i’ the bone.  Bailiff’s doughter at t’ Hollins, shoo’s Breed, an’ shoo’s Life, an shoo’s Art,     Bred frae a Westmorland statesman out o’ a Craven lass; Carries hersen like a queen when shoo drives to markit i’ t’ cart:     Noan o’ yon scraumy-legged[2] painters sal iver git howd o’ her     brass.  Picturs is reight enough for fowks cluttered up i’ Leeds,     Fowks that have ne’er hannled beasts, can’t tell a tup frae a yowe     ; But the art for coontry lads is the art that breathes an’ feeds,     An’ t’ finest gallery i’ t’ worrld is a Yorkshire cattle-show.
