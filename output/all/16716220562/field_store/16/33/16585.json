Consciousness only came back to him after the billows had surged back ward into the woods, leaving the red mud of the field splotched with brown lumps which had lately been men.{75}  As his mind cleared his hand flinched from the hot gun-barrel, and he looked down curiously to see the rain-drops turn into steam as they struck it. His throat was afire from the terrible powder thirst. He lifted his canteen to his lips and almost drained it. He drew a long breath, and looked around to see what had happened since they left the cedars. Shorty was by his side, and unhurt. He now under stood why his face was so black. He could feel the thick incrustation of powder and sweat on his own. Several of Co. Q were groaning on the ground, and the Captain was detailing men to carry them back to where the Surgeon had established himself. Two were past all surgery, staring with soulless eyes into the lowering clouds.  \"Poor Bill and Ebe,\" said Si, gazing sorrowfully at the bodies. \"Co. Q will miss them. What good boys they--\"  \"Were\" stuck in his throat. That those strong, active, ever-ready comrades of a few minutes before now merely \"were\" was unspeakable.  His thoughts were distracted by a rebel battery on the hill sending a volley of shells at the fence. Some went over, and tore gaps in the cedars beyond. One struck the corner of the fence near him, and set the rails to flying.  \"I like fence-rails in their place as well as any man,\" said Shorty, as they dodged around; \"but a fence-rail's got no business sailin' 'round in the air like a bird.\"  An Aid rode up to the Colonel.  \"The General's compliments, Colonel. He directs me to express to you his highest compliments on the{76} splendid manner in which you have defended your position. You and your men have done nobly. But we are outflanked, and it will be necessary to retire to a new position about a half-mile to the rear. You will withdraw your regiment by companies, so as to attract as little attention from the enemy as possible. As soon as they are under cover of the cedars you will move rapidly to the new position.\"  \"Very well,\" said the Colonel, saluting. \"You will be good enough to say to the General that my men and myself appreciate highly his praise. We are proud to receive it, and shall try to deserve it in the future. His orders shall be immediately obeyed.\"  \"They call this a civil war,\" said Shorty, as an other volley of shells tore around. \"Seems to me sometimes that it's too durned civil. If we're goin' to git out of here, we might save compliments for a quieter time.\"  One by one the companies filed back into the cedars, Co. Q being last. Just as they started the rebels on the opposite hill discovered the movement, raised a yell, and started across the field.  \"Halt Front!\" commanded the Captain. \"Those fellows are too tumultuous and premature. We must check them up a little. Wait till they come to that little branch, then everybody pick his man and let him have it. Aim below the belt.\"  The frenzy of the first struggle was now gone from Si's mind; instead had come a deadly determination to make every shot tell.  \"I'm goin' to fetch that mounted officer on their right,\" he said to Shorty and those around him.  \"Very well,\" said Shorty. \"I'll take that Captain{77} near him who's wavin' his sword and yellin'. The rest o' you fellers pick out different men.\"  The rebel line was in the weeds which bordered the branch when the Captain gave the order to fire.  When the smoke arose the mounted officer and the yelling Captain were down.  \"If somebody else didn't get them, we did,\" said Shorty, as they turned and rushed back into the cedars.  The rebels were only checked momentarily. They soon came swarming on, and as Co. Q crashed through the cedars the rebels were yelling close be hind. Fortunately, they could not do any effective firing, on account of the brush. But when they came to the edge of the thicket there was a long run across a furrowed, muddy cottonfield, to reach the knoll on which the brigade was re-forming. The battery was already in action there, throwing shells over the heads of Co. Q at the rebels swarming out of the cedars in pursuit.  Si and Shorty threw away overcoats, blankets, haversacks and canteens everything which would impede their running, except their guns and cartridge-boxes. Their caps were gone, and Si had lost one shoe in the mud. They all sat down on the ground for a minute and panted to get their breath.  The rebels were checked, but only temporarily. They were thronging out in countless multitudes, lining up into regiments and brigades, preparatory to a rush across the field upon the brigade. Away to the right of the brigade rebel batteries had been concentrated, which were shelling it and the ground to the rear, to prevent any assistance being sent it.{78}  \"Captain,\" said the Colonel, riding up to Co. Q, \"the General says that we have got to stay here and hold those fellows back until the new line can be formed along the pike. We haven't ammunition enough for another fight. You'll have to send a Corporal and a squad back to the pike to bring up some more. Pick out men that'll be sure to come back, and in a hurry.\"  \"Corp'l Klegg,\" said the Captain, without an instant's hesitation, \"you hear what's to be done. Take five men and go.\"  Si looked around to see if there was someone he could borrow a shoe from. But that was hardly a time when men were likely to lend shoes. He picked Shorty and four others. They flung down their guns and started on a run for the pike.  The batteries were sweeping the fields with shells, but they were so intent on their errand that they paid no attention to the demoniac shrieks of the hurtling pieces of iron.  They gained the other side of the field, but as they entered the welcome shelter of the woods they encountered an officer with a drawn sword, commanding a line of men.  \"Stop there, you infernal, cowardly rascals,\" he yelled. \"Pick up those guns there, and get into line, or I'll shoot you. You, Corporal, ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"  \"We're after ammunition for the 200th Ind.,\" gasped Si. \"We must have it right away. Where's the division ammunition train?\"  \"That ammunition story's played. Can't work it on me. Where's your regiment? Where's your{79} caps? Where's your shoes? Where's your guns? You're rattled out of your senses. Stop here and cool off. Pick up guns there and fall into line.\"  \"Name o' God, Lieutenant,\" said Shorty excitedly. \"This's no time for any foolishness. Our regiment's out there on the hill without any ammunition. The rebels are gittin' ready to jump it, four or five to one. Don't fool, for heaven's sake. There's not a minute to waste. Come with us and help us git the ammunition. That's a blame sight more important than stoppin' these here runaways, who're no good when they are stopped. Come along, for God's sake.\"  His earnestness impressed the Lieutenant.  \"Lieut. Evans,\" he called out, \"take command of the line while I go back with these men to the ammunition-train. I can get it quicker for them than they can. Your Colonel should have sent a commissioned officer with you.\"  \"The Colonel needs all the officers he has left with him,\" panted Shorty, running ahead of the rest. \"Everybody back there's got all he can attend to, and we couldn't really be spared.\"  There was a crowd of similar men surging around the ammunition wagons, each eager to get his load and rush back. The covers of the wagons had been torn off, and a man stood in each, pitching the boxes to the clamoring details. All were excited and reckless. The pitching would be wild, or the catching bad, and occasionally a box would strike a man on the head or body and knock him down. He would scarcely stop to swear, but snatch up his precious box and rush off toward his regiment.{80}  \"Open out here, let us in,\" commanded the Lieutenant, striking right and left with the flat of his sword. It was not a moment for gentle courtesies. The crowd opened up, and Si and Shorty pushed in near the wheels.  \"Now give us six boxes in a hurry,\" commanded the Lieutenant.  Si caught the first box, Shorty the second, and before the Lieutenant was hardly done speaking the rest had theirs, and started back on the run, accompanied by the Lieutenant. The boxes were very heavy and the mud was deep, but they went faster than they had ever done, even when running from the rebels.  \"I'm awfully afraid you'll have a time getting across the field there,\" said the Lieutenant, as they came to the edge, and he surveyed the ground in front doubtfully. \"Lieut. Evans says they've moved a battery up closer, and are sweeping the field with canister.\"  \"We don't care what they're shootn',\" said Si resolutely. \"We're goin' back to the regiment with these boxes, or die a-tryin'.\"  \"Go on, then, and God help you,\" said the Lieutenant. \"I'd go with you if I could do any good.\"  Si arranged his box for a desperate rush. A blast of canister swept through, cutting down shrubs, splattering the mud, and shrieking viciously.  \"Let's get as far as we can before they fire again,\" he shouted, and plunged forward. Half-way across the field his foot caught in a devil's shoe-string, and down he went in the mud, with the heavy box driving him deeper.{81}  Just then another blast of canister hurtled across the field.   [Illustration: A LUCKY FALL 81]  \"Golly, it was lucky, after all, that I was tripped,\" said Si, rising, stunned and dripping. \"That load of canister was meant for me personally.\"  Two minutes later he flung the box down before the company, and sank panting on the ground. The others came up after. Some had teen grazed by canister, but none seriously wounded. They arrived just in the nick of time, for the regiment had expended its last cartridge in repulsing the last assault, and was now desperately fixing bayonets to meet the next with cold steel. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31772"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 2 (#8)"],["body","of the boxes were pried off with bayonets, and the Sergeants ran along the companies distributing the packages. The assault was met with a stream of fire, given with steady deadliness, which sent the rebels back to their covert.  An Aid dashed across the field to the brigade commander.  \"The line is now formed,\" he said. \"Retire your command to it.\"  That night, after the battle had ceased, Si and Shorty were seated on a rail by the Nashville pike munching rations which they had luckily found in a thrown-away haversack. They were allowed no fires, they had no blankets nor overcoats, and it was bitter cold.  \"Shorty, you said last night you was sure that they couldn't git up nothin' to-day that'd be as bad as what we had yesterday,\" said Si. \"I bel'eve that I'd rather guard wagon-trains and fight cavalry than have such another day as this.\"  \"I think the lake of brimstone'd be a pleasant change from this,\" snorted Shorty.  {84}    CHAPTER VII. AFTER THE FIRST DAY  THE DISCOMFORTS OF THAT LAST NIGHT OF 1862.  IT WAS so desperately cold and comfortless that Si and Shorty felt that they must do something or perish.  There were some fragments of cracker-boxes near. With these they dug a hole several inches deep, put some splinters in, and started a stealthy blaze. They were careful to sit on the side toward the rebels, the better to hide from them any sight of it. It was a very small fire, but there was more relief in it than Si had before gotten from those a thousand times larger. It kept his unshod foot from freezing, and brought the blood back to his numb hands.  \"Just think, Shorty,\" said Si; \"night before last we had a whole panel of fence on the fire, and all our blankets and overcoats, and yet you kicked. I believe this is a judgment on you for not being thankful for what you receive.\"  \"Judgment be blowed,\" ejaculated Shorty. \"This ain't no judgment; it's just durned luck that is, what isn't foolishness in sendin' a boy to mill. If we'd had only half as many men out there in the cedars as the rebels had we'd licked thunder out of 'em. We simply couldn't whip four or five to one. McCook didn't size up his job right.\"  \"Well, we have something to be thankful for,\" said Si, determined to see the bright side of things. \"Neither of us got hurt, which is a blessing.\"  \"Don't know whether it is or not. If we are goin' to freeze to death before mornin' I'd rather've bin shot the first volley.\"  The misty darkness around them was filled with noise and motion. Men who had become separated from their regiments were wandering around trying to find them, in the bewildering maze of men, wagons and animals. Officers were calling aloud the names of regiments to bring together stragglers. Aids were rushing around to find Generals and Colonels to give and receive orders and instructions. Regiments and batteries were marching hither and yon to get into position and complete the formation of the line for the morrow's battle. The 200th Ind., which had fallen back in good order with its brigade, was well together, and made an island around which a restless sea of humanity flowed and eddied. Cheer less as was its bivouac in the cold mud, yet it was infinitely preferable to being lost in the inextricable confusion that reigned over those cottonfields on that sorrowful night of Dec. 31, 1862.  \"I'm not goin' to freeze to death,\" said Si, starting up, at last. \"I'm going to look around and see if I can't find something to make us more comfortable. Shorty, hold on to that hole in the ground. It's all that we've got left in the world, and if we lose that I don't know what'll become of us.\"  \"Better stay here, and not go wanderin' off into that mob,\" remonstrated Shorty. \"You'll git lost entirely, and never find your way back.\"{85}  \"I'll not get lost,\" responded Si. \"I've got the lay o' the ground in my mind. If I did,\" he continued proudly, \"it'd be easy to find you agin. Everybody knows where the 200th Ind. is.\"  He went only a little ways, and carefully, at first.  He was rewarded by kicking against an object which upon examination proved to be a well-filled haver sack, which someone had flung away in his hurry. He carried it back, rejoicing, to Shorty.  [Illustration: FINDING A GOOD THING 85]  \"Finders is keepers,\" said Shorty, unbuckling the knapsack. \"We'll just call this fair exchange for what we've throwed away in to-day's hustle. Let's open her up.\"  \"Some new recruit's,\" said Si, as they examined the inside. \"Looks like the one I packed from Injianny. What's this? I declare if it ain't a pair o' new shoes, and about my size; and some socks. I tell you, Shorty, I'm in luck.\"  He pulled the muddy socks off his shoeless foot, and drew on one of the warm, homemade affairs, and then the shoe. Both fitted well. He put on the other sock and shoe, and life at once seemed brighter.  \"Shorty,\" said he, \"I shouldn't wonder if I could find a blanket and an overcoat. You keep on holding that hole down, and I'll go out agin. I won't be gone long, for I'm dead tired. Just as soon as I find an overcoat or a blanket to put between us and the mud, I'll come back and we'll lay down. Every joint in me aches.\"  He started off less carefully this time. His new shoes made him feel more like walking. He was some distance from the regiment before he knew it. He found an overcoat. It had been trampled into the mud by thousands of passing feet, but still it was an overcoat, and it was not a time to be too nice about the condition of a garment. Presently he found a blanket in similar condition. He pulled on the overcoat, and threw the blanket over his {87}shoulders. He felt warmer, but they were very heavy. Still, he thought he would go on a little ways farther, and perhaps he would find another overcoat and blanket, which would fix out both him and his partner.  All this time men were sweeping by him in companies, regiments and squads; batteries were moving in all directions, and mounted officers were making their way to and fro. Filling up the spaces between these were hundreds of men, single and in small groups, wandering about in search of their regiments, and inquiring of everyone who would stop to listen to them as to the whereabouts of regiments, brigades and divisions. No one could give any satisfactory information. Organizations which had formed a line two miles long in the morning had been driven back, frequently in tumult and disorder, for miles through the thickets and woods. Fragmentary organizations had been rallied from time to time. A fragment of a regiment would rally at one point with fragments of other regiments and make a stand, while other regiments would rally at widely-separated places and renew the fight, only to be pushed back again toward the Nashville Pike. Regiments and brigades that had remained nearly intact had been rapidly shifted from one point to another, as they were needed, until the mind could not follow their changes, or where nightfall had found them, or whither they had been shifted to form the new line.  At last Si succeeded in picking up another over coat and blanket out of the mud, and started to go back to the regiment.{88}  But where was the regiment? He had long since lost all track of its direction. He had been so intent upon studying the ground for thrown-away clothing that he had not noticed the course he had taken.  It suddenly dawned on him that he was but one drop in that great ocean of 35,000 men, surging around on the square miles lying between the Nashville Pike and Stone River. He looked about, but could see nothing to guide him. His eyes rested everywhere on dark masses of moving men. Those immediately around him were inquiring weariedly for their own regiments; they had no patience to answer inquiries as to his own. Discouraged, he determined to walk as straight ahead as possible in the direction which he had come, and see where that would bring him. He was so tired that he could scarcely drag one foot after another, but he plodded on. At length he drew out of the throng a little, and saw that he was approaching the banks of a large stream. This disheartened him, for they had not been within miles of Stone River during the day. He saw a group of men huddled around a larger fire than had been permitted near the front. This, too, was discouraging, for it showed that he had been forging toward the rear. But he went up to the group and inquired:  \"Do any o' you know where the 200th Ind. is?\"  The men had become wearied out answering similar questions, and were as cross as soldiers get to be under similar circumstances.  \"The 200th Ind.,\" snapped one; \"better go back to the rear-guard and inquire. The straggler-ketchers 've got 'em.\"{89}  \"No,\" said another; \"they skipped out before the rear-guard was formed, and were all drowned trying to swim the Cumberland.\"  \"They say the Colonel went on foot,\" said a third, \"and was the first man in the regiment to reach Nashville. Made the best long-distance run on record.\"  \"You infernal liars,\" roared Si; \"if I wasn't so tired I'd lick the whole caboodle of you. But I'll say this: Any man who says that the 200th Ind. run, or that our brave Colonel run, or that any man in it run, is a low-down, measly liar, and hain't a grain a' truth in him, and he daresn't take it up.\"  It was a comprehensive challenge, that would have met with instantaneous response at any other time, but now the men were too exhausted for such vanities as fisticuffs.  \"O, go off and find your rattled, lousy Hoosiers,\" they shouted in chorus. \"Go talk to the Provost-Marshal about 'em. He's got the most of 'em. The rest are breaking for the Wabash as fast as their legs can carry them. Don't be bothering us about that corn-cracking, agery crowd.\"  \"Where'd you leave your regiment, you chuckle-headed straggler?\"  \"You were so rattled you couldn't tell which way they went.\"  \"Where's your gun?\"  \"Where's your cartridge-box and haversack?\"  \"Where's your cap?\"  \"You were so scared you'd 'a'"]]]
