Citizen gamblers would gain admittance to camp under various pretexts and immediately set up boards in secluded places, and play till they were discovered and run out, by which time they would have made enough to make it an inducement to try again whenever they could find an opportunity. They followed the army incessantly for this purpose, and in the aggregate carried off immense sums of the soldiers' pay. Chuck-a-luck is one of the fairest of gambling games, when fairly played, which it rarely or never is by a professional gambler. A tolerably quick, expert man finds little difficulty in palming the dice before a crowd of careless soldiers so as to transfer the majority of their bets to his pocket. The regular citizen gamblers were reinforced by numbers of insatiable chuck-a-luckers in the ranks, who would set up a \"board\" at the least chance, even under the enemy's fire, while waiting the order to move.  Chuck-a-luck was Shorty's greatest weakness. He found it as difficult to pass a chuck-a-luck board as an incurable drunkard does to pass a dram-shop.{47}  Si knew this, and shuddered a little as he saw the \"layouts,\" and tried to get his partner past them. But it was of no use. Shorty was in an intractable mood. He must have a strong distraction. If he could not fight he would gamble.  \"I'm goin' to bust this feller's bank before I go another step,\" said he, stopping before one. \"I know him. He's the same feller that, you remember, I busted down before Nashville. I kin do it agin. He's a bum citizen gambler. He thinks he's the smartest chuck-a-lucker in the Army o' the Cumberland, but I'll learn him different.\"  \"Don't risk more'n a dollar,\" begged Si as a final appeal.  \"All down?\" called the \"banker.\"  \"Allow doublin'?\" inquired Shorty.  \"Double as much as you blamed please, so long's you put your money down,\" answered the \"banker\" defiantly.  \"Well, then, here goes a dollar on that five-spot,\" said Shorty, \"skinning\" a bill from a considerable roll.  \"Don't allow more'n 25 cents bet on single cards, first bet,\" said the \"banker,\" dismayed by the size of the roll.  \"Thought you had some sand,\" remarked Shorty contemptuously. \"Well, then, here's 25 cents on the five-spot, and 25 cents on the deuce,\" and he placed shin-plasters on the numbers. \"Now, throw them dice straight, and no fingerin'. I'm watchin' you.\"  \"Watch and be durned,\" said the \"banker\" surlily. \"Watch your own business, and I'll watch mine. I'm as honest as you are any day.\"{48}  The \"banker\" lifted the box, and showed two sixes and a tray up. He raked in the bets on the ace, deuce, four and five-spots, and paid the others.  \"Fifty cents on the deuce; 50 cents on the five,\" said Shorty, laying down the fractional currency.  Again they lost.  \"A dollar on the deuce; a dollar on the five,\" said Shorty.  The same ill luck.  \"Two dollars on the deuce; two dollars on the five,\" said Shorty, though Si in vain plucked his sleeve to get him away.  The spots remained obstinately down.  \"Four dollars on the deuce; four dollars on the five,\" said Shorty.  No better luck.  \"Eight dollars on the deuce; eight dollars on the five,\" said Shorty.  \"Whew, there goes more'n a month's pay,\" said the other players, stopping to watch the dice as they rolled out, with the deuce and five-spot down somewhere else than on top. \"And his roll's beginning to look as if an elephant had stepped on it. Now we'll see his sand.\"  \"Come, Shorty, you've lost enough. You've lost too much already. Luck's agin you,\" urged Si. \"Come away.\"  \"I ain't goin',\" said Shorty, obstinately. \"Now's my chance to bust him. Every time them spots don't come up increases the chances that they'll come up next time. They've got to. They're not loaded; I kin tell that by the way they roll. He ain't fingerin' 'em; I stopped that when I made him{49} give 'em a rollin' throw, instead o' keep in' 'em kivvered with the box.\"  \"Sixteen dollars on the deuce; sixteen dollars on the five-spot. And I ain't takin' no chances o' your jumpin' the game on me, Mr. Banker. I want you to plank down $32 alongside o' mine.\"  Shorty laid down his money and put his fists on it. \"Now put yours right there.\"  \"O, I've got money enough to pay you. Don't be skeered,\" sneered the \"banker,\" \"and you'll git it if you win it.\"  \"You bet I will,\" answered Shorty. \"And I'm goin' to make sure by havin' it right on the board alongside o' mine. Come down, now.\"  The proposition met the favor of the other players, and the \"banker\" was constrained to comply.  \"Now,\" said Shorty, as the money was counted down, \"I've jest $20 more that says that I'll win. Put her up alongside.\"  The \"banker\" was game. He pulled out a roll and said as he thumbed it over:  \"I'll see you $20, and go you $50 better that I win.\"  Shorty's heart beat a little faster. All his money was up, but there was the $50 which the Deacon had intrusted to him for charitable purposes. He slipped his hand into his bosom, felt it, and looked at Si. Si was not looking at him, but had his eyes fixed on a part of the board where the dice had been swept after the last throw. Shorty resisted the temptation for a moment, and withdrew his hand.  \"Come down, now,\" taunted the \"banker.\" \"You've blowed so much about sand. Don't weaken over a{50} little thing like $50. I'm a thoroughbred, myself, I am. The man don't live that kin bluff me.\"  The taunt was too much for Shorty. He ran his hand into his bosom in desperation, pulled out the roll of the Deacon's money, and laid it on the board.  Si had not lifted his eyes. He was wondering why the flies showed such a liking for the part of the board where the dice were lying. Numbers of them had gathered there, apparently eagerly feeding. He was trying to understand it.  He had been thinking of trying a little shy at the four-spot himself, as he had noticed that it had never won, and two or three times he had looked for it before the dice were put in the box, and had seen the \"banker\" turn it down on the board before picking the dice up. A thought flashed into his mind.  The \"banker\" picked up the dice with seeming carelessness, dropped them into the box, gave them a little shake, and rolled them out. Two threes and a six came up. The \"banker's\" face lighted up with triumph, and Shorty's deadened into acute despair.  \"I guess that little change is mine,\" said the \"banker\" reaching for the pile.  \"Hold on a minnit. Mister,\" said Si, covering the pile with his massive hands. \"Shorty, look at them dice. He's got molasses on one side. You kin see there where the flies are eatin' it.\"  Shorty snatched up the dice, felt them and touched his tongue to one side. \"That's so, sure's you're a foot high,\" said he sententiously.  Just then someone yelled:  \"Scatter! Here come the guards!\"{51}  All looked up. A company coming at the doublequick was almost upon them. The \"banker\" made a final desperate claw for the money, but was met by the heavy fist of Shorty and knocked on his back. Shorty grabbed what money there was on the board, and he and Si made a burst of speed which took them out of reach of the \"provos\" in a few seconds. Looking back from a safe distance they could see the \"bankers\" and a lot of the more luckless ones being gathered together to march to the guard-house. \"Another detachment of horny-handed laborers for the fortifications,\" said Shorty grimly, as he{52} recovered his breath, watched them, and sent up a yell of triumph and derision. \"Another contribution to the charity fund,\" he continued, looking down at the bunch of bills and fractional currency in his hands.  [Illustration: SHORTY SETTLES WITH THE BANKER. 51]  \"Shorty,\" said Si earnestly, \"promise me solemnly that you'll never bet at chuck-a-luck agin as long as you live.\"  \"Si, don't ask me impossibilities. But I want you to take every cent o' this money and keep it. Don't you ever give me more'n $5 at a time, under any consideration. Don't you do it, if I git down on my knees and ask for it. Lord, how nigh I come to losin' that $50 o' your father's.\"    CHAPTER IV. A SPY'S EXPERIENCES  MR. ROSENBAUM TELLS THE BOYS MORE OF HIS ADVENTURES.  MR. ROSENBAUM became a frequent visitor to the Hoosier's Rest, and generally greatly interested Si and Shorty with his stories of adventure.  \"How did you happen to come into the Army of the Cumberland?\" asked Si. \"I'd a-thought you'd staid where you knowed the country and the people.\"  \"That was just the trouble,\" replied Rosenbaum. \"I got to know them very well, but they got to know me a confounded sight better. When I was in the clothing pizniss in St. Louis I tried to have everybody know me. I advertised. I wanted to be a great big sunflower that everybody noticed. But when I got to be a spy I wanted to be a modest little violet that hid under the leaves, unt nobody saw. Then every man what knew me become a danger, unt it got so that I shuddered every time that I see a limb running out from a tree, for I didn't know how soon I might be hung from it. I had some awful narrow escapes, I tell you.  \"But what decided me to leave the country unt skip over de Mississippi River was something that happened down in the Boston Mountains just before the battle of Pea Ridge. I was down there watching Van Dorn unt Ben McCullough for General Curtis, unt{54} was getting along all right. I was still playing the old racket about buying up Mexican silver dollars to buy ammunition. One night I was sitting at a campfire with two or three others, when a crowd of Texans come up. They was just drunk enough to be devilish, unt had a rope with a noose on the end, which I noticed first thing. I had begun to keep a sharp lookout for such things. My flesh creeped when I saw them. I tried to think what had stirred them up all at once, but couldn't for my life recollect, for everything had been going on all right for several days. The man with the rope--a big, ugly brute, with red hair unt one eye--says:  \"'You're a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31773"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 3 (#5)"],["body","Jew, ain't you?'  \"'Yes,' says I; 'I was born that way.'  \"'Well,' says he, 'we're going to hang you right off.' Unt he put the noose around my neck unt began trying to throw the other end over a limb.\"  [Illustration: CLOSE CALL FOR ROSENBAUM. 54]  \"'What for?' I yelled, trying to pull the rope off my neck. 'I ain't done nothing.'  \"'Hain't eh?' said the man with one eye. 'You hook-nosed Jews crucified our Savior.'  \"'Why, you red-headed fool,' said I, catching hold of the rope with both hands, 'that happened more as 1,800 years ago. Let me go.'  \"'I don't care if it did,' said the one-eyed man, getting the end of the rope over the limb, 'we didn't hear about it till the Chaplain told us this morning, unt then the boys said we'd kill every Jew we come across. Catch hold of the end here, Bowers.'  \"The other fellers around me laughed at the Texans so that they finally agreed to let me go if I'd promise not to do it again, holler for Jeff Davis, unt treat all around. It was a fool thing, but it scared me worse'n anything else, unt I resolved to get out of there unt go where the people read their Bibles unt the newspapers.\"  \"How did you manage to keep Gen. Curtis posted as to the number of rebels in front of him?\" asked Si. \"You couldn't always be running back and forth from one army to the other.\"  \"O, that was easy enough. You see. General{56} Curtis was advancing, unt the rebels falling back most of the time. There was cabins every little ways along the road. All these have great big fireplaces, built of smooth rocks, which they pick up out of the creek unt wherever they can find them.  \"I'd go into these houses unt talk with the people unt play with the children. I'd sit by the fire unt pick up a dead coal unt mark on these smooth rocks. Sometimes I'd draw horses unt wagons unt men to amuse the children. Sometimes I'd talk to the old folks about how long they'd been in the country, how many bears unt deers the man had killed, how far it was to the next place, how the roads run, unt so on, unt I'd make marks on the jam of the fireplace to help me understand.  \"The next day our scouts would come in unt see the marks unt understand them just as well as if I'd wrote them a letter. I fixed it all up with them before I left camp. I kin draw very well with a piece of charcoal. I'd make pictures of men what would make the children unt old folks open their eyes. Our scouts would understand which one meant Ben McCullough, which one Van Dorn, which one Pap Price, unt so on. Other marks would show which way each one was going unt how many men he hat with him. The rebels never dropt on to it, but they came so close to it once or twice that my hair stood on end.\"  \"That curly mop of yours'd have a time standing on end,\" ventured Shorty. \"I should think it'd twist your neck off tryin' to.\"  \"Well, something gave me a queer feeling about the throat one day when I saw a rebel Colonel stop{57} unt look very hard at a long letter which I'd wrote this way on a rock.  \"'Who done that?' he asked.  \"'This man here,' says the old woman, 'He done it while he was gassing with the old man unt fooling with the children. Lot o' pesky nonsense, marking up de walls dat a-way.'  \"'Looks like very systematic nonsense,' said the Colonel very stern unt sour. 'There may be something in it. Did you do this?' said he, turning to me.  \"'Yes, sir,' said I, 'I have a bad habit of marking when I'm talking. I always done it, even when I was a child. My mother used to often slap me for spoiling the walls, but she could never break me of it.'  \"'Humph,' said he, not at all satisfied with my story, unt looking at the scratches harder than ever. 'Who are you, unt what are you doing here?'  \"I told him my story about buying Mexican silver dollars, unt showed him a lot of the dollars I'd bought.  \"'Your story ain't reasonable,' said he. 'You haven't done bizniss enough to pay you for all the time you've spent around the army. I'll put you under guard till I can look into your case.'  \"He called to the Sergeant of the Guard, unt ordered him to take charge of me. The Sergeant was that same dirty loafer. Bob Smiles, that I had the trouble with by Wilson's Creek. He kicked me unt pounded me, unt put me on my horse, with my hands tied behind me, unt my feet tied under the horse's belly. I was almost dead by night, when we reached Headquarters. They gave me something to{58} eat, unt I laid down on the floor of the cabin, wishing I was Pontius Pilate, so that I could crucify every man in the Southern Confedrisy, especially Bob Smiles. An hour or two later I heard Bob Smiles swearing again.\"  [Illustration: THE SPY IN CUSTODY. 58]  \"'Make out the names of all the prisoners I have,' he was saying, 'with where they belong unt the charges against them. I can't. Do they take me for a counter-jumping clerk? I didn't come into the army to be a white-faced bookkeeper, I sprained{59} my thumb the other day, unt I can't write even a Httle bit. What am I to do?'  \"That was all moonshine about his spraining his thumb. He vas ignorant as a jackass. If he had 40 thumbs he couldn't write even his own name so's anybody could read it.  \"'I don't believe these's a man in a mile of here that can make out such a list,' he went on. They're all a set of hominy-eating blockheads. Perhaps that hook-nosed Jew might. He's the man. I'll make him do it, or break his swindling head.'  \"He come in, kicked me, unt made me get up, unt then took me out unt set me down at a table, where he had paper, pen unt ink, unt ordered me to take down the names of the prisoners as he brought them up. He'd look over my shoulder as I wrote, as if he was reading what I set down, but I knowed that he couldn't make out a letter. I was tempted to write all sorts of things about him, but I didn't, for I was in enough trouble already. When I come to my own name, he said:  \"'Make de charge a spy, a thief, unt a Dutch traitor to the Southern Confedrisy.'  \"I just wrote: 'Levi Rosenbaum, Memphis, Tenn. Merchant. No charge.'  \"He scowled very wisely at it, unt pretended to read it, unt said:  \"'It's lucky for you that you wrote it just as I told you. I'd 'a' broke every bone in your body if you hadn't.'  \"I'd just got done when an officer come down from Headquarters for it. He looked it over unt said:  \"'Who made this out?'  \"'Why, I made it out,' said Bob Smiles, bold as brass.  \"'But who wrote it?\" said de officer.  \"'O, I sprained my thumb, so I couldn't write very well, unt I made a Jew prisoner copy it,' said Bob Smiles.  \"'It's the best writing I have seen,' said the officer. 'I want the man what wrote it to go with me to Headquarters at once. I have some copying there to be done at once, unt not one of them corn-crackers that I have up there can write anything fit to read. Bring that man out here unt I will take him with me.\"  \"Bob Smiles hated to let me go, but he couldn't help himself, unt I went with the officer. I was so tired I could hardly move a step, unt I felt I could not write a word. But I seemed to see a chance at Headquarters, unt I determined to make every effort to do something. They gave me a stiff horn of whisky unt set me to work. They wanted me to make out unt copy a consolidated report of the army.  \"I almost forgot I was tired when I found out what they wanted, for I saw a chance to get something of great value. They'd been trying to make up a report from all sorts of scraps unt sheets of paper sent in from the different Headquarters, unt they had spoiled a half-dozen big sheets of paper after they'd got them partly done. If I do say it myself, I can write better and faster and figure quicker than most any man you ever saw. Those rebels thought they had got hold of a wonder--a{61} lightning calculator unt lightning penman together.  \"As fast as I could copy one paper, unt it would prove to be all right, I would fold it up unt stick it into a big yaller envelope. I also folded up the spoiled reports, unt stuck them in the envelope, saying that I wanted to get rid of them--put them where seeing them wouldn't bother me. I carefully slipped the envelope under the edge of a pile of papers near the edge of the table. I had another big yaller envelope that looked just like it lying in the middle of the table, into which I stuck papers that didn't amount to nothing. I was very slick about it, unt didn't let them see that I had two envelopes.  \"It was past midnight when I got the consolidated report made out, unt the rebels was tickled to death with it. They'd never seen anything so well done before. They wanted a copy made to keep, unt I said I'd make one, though I was nearly dead for sleep. I really wasn't, for the excitement made me forget all about being tired.  \"I was determined, before I slept, to have that yellow envelope, with all those papers, in General Curtis's hands, though he was 40 miles away. How in the world I was going to do it I could not think, but I was going to do it, if I died a trying. The first thing was to get that envelope off the table into my clothes; the next, to get out of that cabin, away from Bob Smiles unt his guards, through the rebel lines, unt over the mountains to General Curtis's camp. It was a dark, windy night, unt things were in confusion about the camp--just the kind of a time when{62} anybody might kill a Jew pedler, unt no questions would be asked.  \"I had got the last copy finished, unt the officers was going over it. They had their heads together, not 18 inches from me, across the table. I had my fingers on the envelope, but I didn't dare slip it out, though my fingers itched. I was in hopes that they'd turn around, or do something that'd give me a chance.  \"Suddenly Bob Smiles opened the door wide, unt walked in, with a dispatch in his hand. The wind swept in, blew the candles out, unt sent de papers flying about the room. Some went into the fire. The officers yelled unt swore at him, unt he shut the door, but I had the envelope in my breast-pocket.  \""]]]
