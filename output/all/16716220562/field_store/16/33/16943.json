A disintegrator ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly for a moment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in which I stood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light switched off, it shot to one side, and a moment later another vast hulk crashed to earth. I looked out, then stepped out on the ground.  The only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the south which were hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly down. The others must have crashed down while I was deafened by the sound of the explosion of my own rockets.  Somebody hit the other repellor ray of one of the two remaining ships and it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other, farther away, drifted down diagonally, its disintegrator ray playing viciously over the ground below it.  I shouted with exultation and relief.  \"Take back the command, Boss!\" I yelled.  His commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending ship, rang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped back into the compartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my Wilma. Her padded helmet had absorbed much of the blow, I thought; otherwise, her skull might have been fractured.  \"Oh, my head!\" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently in my arms and strode out in the open with her. \"We must have won, dearest, did we?\"  \"We most certainly did,\" I reassured her. \"All but one crashed and that one is drifting down toward the south; we've captured this one we're in intact. There was only one member of the crew aboard when we dove in.\"  [Illustration: As the American leaped, he swung his legs up in front of him, catching the Han full in the stomach.]  Less than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to tune in ultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated broadcast of the Han intelligence office in Nu-yok from the Susquanna station. It was in the form of a public warning and news item, and read as follows:  \"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-yok, broadcasting warning to navigators of private ships, and news of public interest. The squadron of seven ships, which left Nu-yok this morning to investigate the recent destruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming Valley, has been destroyed by a series of mysterious explosions similar to those which wrecked the GK-984.  \"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of five of the seven ships ceased operating suddenly at approximately the same moment, about seven-four-nine.\" (According to the Han system of reckoning time, seven and forty-nine one hundredths after midnight.) \"After violent disturbances the location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity registers applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead.  \"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of disaster which overtook the squadron except certain evidences of explosive phenomena similar to those in the case of the GK-984, which recently went dead while beaming the valley in a systematic effort to wipe out the works and camps of the tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the deduction that the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet undetermined, technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to the Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority be given the Navigation Intelligence Division to make an investigation of this technique and develop a defense against it.  \"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this territory in particular, and in general hold as closely as possible to the official inter-city routes, which now are being patrolled by the entire force of the Military Office, which is beaming the routes generously to a width of ten miles. The Military Office reports that it is at present considering no retaliatory raids against the tribesmen. With the Navigation Intelligence Division, it holds that unless further evidence of the nature of the disaster is developed in the near future, the public interest will be better served, and at smaller cost of life, by a scientific research than by attempts at retaliation, which may bring destruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless further evidence actually is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the contrary, the Military will hold to a defensive policy.  \"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the Heaven-Council has the matter under consideration.  \"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of the following condensation of its detailed observations:  \"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley where the wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of its location finder before it went dead recently. There the bottom projectoscope relays of all ships registered the wreck of the GK-984. Teleprojectoscope views of the wreck and the bowl of the valley showed no evidence of the presence of tribesmen. Neither ship registers nor base registers showed any indication of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On orders from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-248, LK-745 and LG-25 scouted southward at 3,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220 stood above at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit personal inspection of the wreck by the science committee. The party debarked, leaving one man on board in the control cabin. He set all projectoscopes at universal focus except RB-3,\" (this meant the third projectoscope from the bow of the ship, on the right-hand side of the lower deck) \"with which he followed the landing group as it walked around the wreck.  \"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the instruments at Base was that relayed automatically from projectoscope RB-4 of the GK-18, which as the party disappeared from view in back of the wreck, recorded two green missiles of roughly cylindrical shape, projected from the wreckage into the landing compartment of the ship. At such close range these were not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at which the projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once ordered the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave the control room in compliance with this order. An instant later confused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as might be made by a man falling heavily, and footsteps reapproached the control room, a figure entering and leaving the control room hurriedly. The Base Captain now believes, and the stills of the photorecord support his belief, that this was not the crew member who had been left in the control room. Before the Base Captain could speak to him he left the room, nor was any response given to the attention signal the Captain flashed throughout the ship.  \"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship now out of focus control, dimly showed the landing party walking back toward the ship. RB-4 showed it more clearly. Then on both these instruments, a number of blinding explosives in rapid succession were seen and the electrophone relays registered terrific concussions; the ship's electronic apparatus and projectoscopes apparatus went dead.  \"Reports of the other ships' Base Observers and Executives, backed by the photorecords, show the explosions as taking place in the midst of the landing party as it returned, evidently unsuspicious, to the ship. Then in rapid succession they indicate that terrific explosions occurred inside and outside the three ships standing above close to their rep-ray generators, and all signals from these ships thereupon went dead.  \"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered an identical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to the knowledge of the disaster. But with the LK-745 and the LG-25 it was different.  \"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction by an explosion of the rear rep-ray generator, and that the ship hung stern down for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The forward viewplates and indicators did not cease functioning, but their records are chaotic, except for one projectoscope still, which shows the bowl of the valley, and the GK-981 falling, but no visible evidence of tribesmen. The control-room viewplate is also a chaotic record of the ship's crew tumbling and falling to the rear wall. Then the forward rep-ray generator exploded, and all signals went dead.  \"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this ship hung nose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it slowly descended out of control.  \"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its Action Captain was precluded. The record of the interior rear viewplate shows members of the crew climbing toward the rear rep-ray generator in an attempt to establish manual control of it, and increase the lift. The projectoscope relays, swinging in wide arcs, recorded little of value except at the ends of their swings. One of these, from a machine which happened to be set in telescopic focus, shows several views of great value in picturing the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear projectoscope records enable the reconstruction in detail of the pendulum and torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the earth. But none of the views showing the forest below contain any indication of tribesmen's presence. A final explosion put this ship out of commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point four miles S. by E. of the center of the valley.\"  The message ended with a repetition of the warning to other airmen to avoid the valley.     CHAPTER VII  Incredible Treason   After receiving this report, and reassurances of support from the Big Bosses of the neighboring Gangs, Hart determined to reestablish the Wyoming Valley community.  A careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the northern sections and slopes that had been \"beamed\" by the first Han ship.

Definitely nice.\"  \"You think so?\" Freddy snorted, and glanced out the port at the broad expanse of sun-flooded Indian Ocean beneath the wings of the B-17. \"What's nice about it, I'd like to know? Nothing but water down there. And more water!\"  \"So what are you kicking about, Pal?\" Dave shot at him. \"You're only seeing the top of it, you know. But I meant it's nice to be air chauffeured around once in a while. Just sit back and relax and enjoy yourself, while some other guy does all the work.\"  \"I always suspected that you were born lazy,\" Freddy said. \"And every day in every way I'm becoming more and more convinced. I wouldn't relax too much, old thing, if I were you. In case you don't remember, there is still a world war going on. And particularly in this part of the world. Just over there a couple of hundred miles or so are some islands called the Dutch East Indies. Right now a mess of slant-eyed devils are in control. And they have quite a few airplanes, too, for another thing.\"  \"Meaning?\" Dawson grunted and frowned.  \"Meaning that we're expected to do something in return for this hitch hike hop from India to Australia,\" the English youth explained. \"In other words, we are expected, like everybody else aboard, to keep an eye out for possible approaching enemy planes.\"  \"Do tell, do tell!\" Dawson murmured, and pushed himself up to a half sitting position.  Turning his head slightly, he took a long look out the port nearest him. Then presently he shook his head, relaxed and slumped back to his original position.  \"Nope,\" he grinned at Freddy. \"No enemy planes approaching, sir. Now what?\"  Freddy made sounds in his throat and stabbed a finger at the bomb bay doors.  \"You could step down through there, and neglect to take your parachute along!\" he snapped. \"You know something, Dave? I'm just a little worried about you.\"  \"Good!\" Dawson chuckled, and bit off another hunk of chocolate. \"Worrying about me will keep you out of trouble, and that will be fine. But, seriously, what's on your mind, my good fellow? You do have a mind, don't you?\"  \"I have a _mind_ to toss you overboard, and not even mention it to the others!\" Freddy came right back. \"But seriously speaking, too, I really am worried about you. You've lost your pep and you're going stale. And--\"  \"Hey, what gives?\" Dawson cried, and sat up straight. \"Just stick a Jap Zero out there, sweetheart, and I'll show you who's going stale. Where do you get that stuff, anyway?\"  \"Oh, I don't mean that,\" Freddy said with a faint gesture. \"I imagine you could shoot down a Zero--if the pilot would keep it still long enough. No, I mean about your pep, your--well, your disinterest, Dave. Once you used to be all keyed up about what was going to happen next. But now...? Well, you just seem to slide along from day to day. Sort of take things as they come.\"  \"So?\" Dawson mumbled, and munched on his chocolate.  \"See what I mean?\" Freddy cried angrily. \"No interest at all in what's going to happen next. Take this flight we're making right now. A couple of weeks ago we were pulled out of China to India. And now we're on our way to Australia. And, from there to where, or what? You haven't said a word about that. Yet once you used to comb your brain for the answers. Nowadays, though, you don't appear to give such things so much as a thought. Are you getting war weary, Dave, or just naturally slipping.\"  Dawson didn't say anything for a while. He finished his chocolate and licked his fingers in frowning silence.  \"Well, I'll tell you, pal,\" he finally spoke. \"Maybe it's because I'm getting old. And so are you, only you won't admit it. Yet maybe that's not right, either. I think it's because I'm all washed up with guessing, and never guessing right. I mean about jobs for us to do. Think back over our war experiences, Freddy. Think back and just name one time when we got orders to report some place that we knew why, and what it was all about. Go ahead. Think hard, and try and come up with one example. Just try, brother; just try!\"  Freddy Farmer concentrated hard for a moment or two, and then finally shook his head.  \"No, I'm afraid I can't think of a single time,\" he said. \"But--\"  \"Nuts to the buts!\" Dawson snapped. \"That's the idea, see? Here today, and some place else tomorrow. And nobody ever tells us. So why get all steamed up wondering and guessing? I'm just tired of doing it, see? So I skip the wondering and guessing, nowadays.\"  Freddy Farmer stared at him and then grunted and dragged down one corner of his mouth.  \"And if you'll pardon the Yank expression, my dear sir,\" he said, \"you are what is known as a cockeyed liar. And you know it! You mean to tell me you're not wondering _why_ we've been ordered to Australia? Don't be coy, old thing! You're just trying to put off an act!\"  \"It's put _on_ an act, dummy!\" Dave growled at him. \"Okay, I have wondered a little. So what? At least I'm not filling the breeze with a lot of questions out loud. I'll just take what comes, and let it go at that. Only I hope it's some action. And I do mean real action!\"  \"And I've a fancy that's just what you're going to get!\" the English-born air ace spoke up. \"I was talking with a chap in Calcutta, just before we left. He has a friend attached to Far East H.Q., and he hinted that the Japs have assembled a thundering big naval and air force in the Southeastern Pacific. And an all out attack is to be made on Australia 'most any day now.\"  \"Nuts!\" Dawson snorted. \"After all these years, and you fall for that kind of rumor stuff. You should know better, Freddy!\"  \"Oh, you think so?\" the English youth flared up. \"I suppose you've got the real inside information straight from General MacArthur?\"  \"No,\" Dawson replied with a straight face. \"But I met a chap in Calcutta, too. A Yank infantry lieutenant. He has a girl who goes around with a fellow who has an uncle who had dinner in Washington with the close friend of a Senator. And what do you think that Senator said had been decided?\"  Freddy Farmer hesitated, but couldn't stop himself.  \"What did he say?\" he asked.  \"That the U.S. has made a deal with Japan about the Pacific!\" Dave came back instantly. \"We're going to take half, and the Japs are going to take half. We're--Hey! What's wrong, Freddy?\"  The last was because the English youth had suddenly wrapped his arms about his middle, and was swaying back and forth with an expression of agonizing pain on his face. He suddenly stopped and gave a sad shake of his head.  \"You!\" he groaned. \"Good grief! Why did it have to be you, my very best friend? And I swore by all that's holy that I'd do it, too!\"  \"Say, what is this?\" Dawson demanded, and leaned forward. \"What in thunder are you raving about, anyway? Swore you'd do what?\"  \"Swore I'd shoot the very next blighter who pulled that old, old one about the U.S. taking the top half of the Pacific, and"]]]
