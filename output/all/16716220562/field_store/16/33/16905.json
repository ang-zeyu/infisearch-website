Dave dropped into step at his side, and they had traveled but a few yards when a harsh voice suddenly stopped them in their tracks.  \"Halt!\"  The two boys stood motionless, their eyes blinking into the light. Dave heard Freddy Farmer catch his breath in a sharp gasp. He suddenly realized that for some unknown reason his own heart was pounding furiously, and there was a peculiar dryness in his throat. At that moment he heard hobnailed boots strike the surface of the road. The figure of a soldier came into the light. On his head was a bucket shaped helmet, and in his hands was a wicked looking portable machine gun. He moved forward in a cautious way, and then Dave was able to see his uniform. His heart seemed to turn to ice in his chest, and his hands suddenly felt very cold and damp.  He was looking straight at a German soldier!     CHAPTER FOUR  _Prisoners Of War!_   \"Good Grief, a German!\"  Freddy Farmer's whispered exclamation served to jerk Dave out of his stunned trance. He blinked and swallowed hard and tried to stop the pounding of his heart.  \"Hey, there, we're lost!\" he suddenly called out. \"Where are we anyway?\"  The advancing German soldier pulled up short and stopped. He stuck his head forward and stared hard. There was a sharp exclamation behind him and then a second figure came into the light. The second figure was a German infantry officer. He kept one hand on his holstered Luger automatic and came up to Dave and Freddy.  \"You are English?\" he asked in a heavy nasal voice. \"What are you doing here? Ah, an ambulance, eh? So, you are trying to sneak back through our advanced lines? It is good that I have found you just in time. Keep your hands up, both of you! I will see if you have guns, yes!\"  \"We're not armed, Captain!\" Dave exclaimed. \"We're not soldiers. We're just lost.\"  \"I am not a captain, I am a lieutenant!\" the German snapped and searched Dave for a gun. \"You will address me as such. Not soldiers, you tell me? Then, why this ambulance? And why are you here?\"  \"As you were just told,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up in a calm voice, \"because we are lost. Now, if you will be good enough to tell us the way to Courtrai we will be off.\"  The German officer snapped his head around.  \"Ah, so _you_ are English, yes?\" he demanded.  \"And proud of it!\" Freddy said stiffly. \"And this chap, if you must know, is an American friend of mine. Now, will you tell us the way to Courtrai?\"  The German said nothing for a moment or two. There was a look of disappointment on his sharp featured face. It was as though he was very sad he had not found a pistol or an automatic on either of them. He moved back a step and stood straddle legged with his bunched fists resting on his hips.  \"American and English?\" he finally muttered. \"This is all very strange, very unusual. You say you don't know where you are?\"  \"That's right, Lieutenant,\" Dave said and choked back a hot retort. \"Where are we anyway? And what are you doing here? My gosh! Is this Germany?\"  The German smiled and showed ugly teeth.  \"It is now,\" he said. \"But that is all you need to know. I think you have lied to me. Yes, I am sure of it. I will take you to the _Kommandant_. He will get you to talk, I'm sure. _Himmel!_ Our enemies send out little boys to spy on us! The grown men must be too afraid. But, you cannot fool us with your tricks!\"  \"Tricks, nothing!\" Dave blurted out in a burst of anger. \"We told you the truth. I was on my way to join my father in London....\"  \"Don't waste your breath, Dave,\" Freddy Farmer said quietly. \"I'm sure he wouldn't understand, anyway.\"  \"Silence, you Englisher!\" the German snarled and whirled on the boy. \"You will make no slurs at a German officer. Come! We will go to see the _Kommandant_ at once!\"  \"We'd better do as he orders, Freddy,\" Dave said swiftly. \"After we've told our story to his commanding officer they'll let us go. They can't keep us very long. If they do, I'll appeal to the nearest American Consul. He'll straighten things out for us.\"  \"So?\" the German muttered and gave Dave a piercing look. \"Well, we shall see. If you are spies it will go very hard with you, yes. Now, march back to the car in front of me.\"  The officer half turned his head and snapped something at the soldier who had been standing in back of him. The soldier immediately sprang into action. He hurried past and climbed into the front seat of the ambulance. Dave impulsively took hold of Freddy's arm again.  \"Don't worry, Freddy!\" he whispered. \"Everything, will come out all right. You wait and see. Don't let these fellows even guess that we're worried.\"  \"What's that?\" the German suddenly thundered. \"What's that you are saying to him?\"  The officer had half drawn his Luger and the movement chilled Dave's heart. He forced himself, though, to look the German straight in the eye.  \"I was simply telling him the American Consul would fix things up for us,\" he said evenly.  The German snorted.  \"Perhaps,\" he growled. \"We shall see.\"  Walking straight with their heads up and their shoulders back, the two boys permitted themselves to be herded back to the car. When they passed beyond the glow of the headlights they were plunged into darkness and for a moment Dave could see nothing. Then his eyes became used to the change and he saw that the car was a combination car and truck. It was actually an armored troop transport. Steel sheets protected the back and the driver's seat, and instead of heavy duty tires on the rear wheels there were tractor treads instead so that the army vehicle could travel across country and through mud as well as along a paved road.  In the back were some fifteen or twenty German soldiers each armed with a small machine gun and completely fitted out for scouting work. They peered down at Dave and Freddy as the officer motioned them to get into the transport, but none of them spoke. They either did not understand English, or else they were too afraid of the officer to speak. And so Dave and Freddy climbed aboard in silence and sank down on the hard plank that served as a seat. The officer got in beside the driver and growled a short order.  The engine roared up, gears clanked and crashed, and the transport lunged forward. It traveled a few yards and swung off the road and around in the direction from which it had obviously come. That direction was to the east, and that caused Dave to swallow hard and press his knee against Freddy's. The pressure that was returned told him that the English boy had a good hold on himself, and wasn't going to do anything foolish.  Glad of that, Dave stared ahead over the shoulder of the driver at the road. At various points the pavement had been torn up by a bomb or by a shell and the transport's driver was forced to detour around such spots. Presently, wrecked ammunition wagons, and light field artillery pieces were to be seen, strewn along the side of the road. They were all smashed almost beyond recognition, and close by them were the death stilled figures of Belgian soldiers, and refugees who had been unable to escape the swiftly advancing German hordes.  Suddenly the sound of airplane engines lifted Dave's eyes up to the skies. He could not see the planes, they were too high. However the pulsating beat of the engines told him they were Hitler's night bombers out on patrol. Impulsively he clenched his two fists and wished very much he was up there in a swift, deadly pursuit or fighter plane. He had taken flying lessons back home, and had even made his first solo. But he had not been granted his private pilot's license yet because of his age.  \"But I'd like to be up there in a Curtis P-Forty!\" he spoke aloud. \"I bet I could do something, or at least try!\"  His words stiffened Freddy Farmer at his side. The English boy leaned close.  \"Are you a pilot, Dave?\" he whispered. \"Do you fly?\"  \"Some,\" Dave said. \"I've gone solo, anyway. I hope some day to get accepted for the Army Air Corps. I think flying is the best thing yet. There's nothing like it. Hear those planes up there? Boy!\"  \"They're German,\" Freddy said. \"Heinkel bombers, I think. Or perhaps they are Dorniers, I can't tell by the sound. I'm crazy about flying, too. I joined an aero club back in England. I've got a few hours solo to my credit. When war broke out I tried to enlist in the Royal Air Force, but they found out about my age and it was no go, worse luck. But, some day I'm going to wear R.A.F. wings. At least, I hope and pray so. I....\"  \"Silence!\" the German officer's harsh voice grated against their eardrums once more. \"You will not speak!\"  \"A rum chap, isn't he?\" Freddy breathed out the corner of his mouth.  \"Sure thinks he's a big shot,\" Dave breathed.  And then as the transport continued to rumble and roll eastward Nature took charge of things as far as the boys were concerned. Strong and healthy though they were, they had been through a lot since dawn. It had been more than enough to wear down a full grown man. And soon they fell sound asleep.  The rasping and clanging of gears and the shouting of voices in German eventually dragged Dave out of his sound slumber. It was still dark but he could see the first faint light of a new dawn low down in the east. The motorized transport had come to a stop in the center of a small village. Dave could see that here, too, shells and bombs had been at work, but lots of the buildings remained untouched. There were German soldiers in all kinds of uniforms all over the place. A hand was slapped against his shoulder and he looked up to stare into the small bright eyes of the German lieutenant.  \"Wake up your friend!\" the German snapped, \"We are here. Get out, both of you!\"  \"Where are we?\" Dave asked and gently shook Freddy Farmer who was fast asleep on his shoulder. \"What town is this, Lieutenant?\"  The German"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32440"],["title","Dave Dawson at Dunkirk (#5)"],["body","slyly. Then annoyance flashed through his eyes. He whipped out a hand and took a steel grip on Freddy's shoulder and shook viciously.  \"Wake up, Englander!\" he barked. \"You have had enough sleep for the present. Wake up, I say!\"  A smart slap across the cheek emphasized the last. The English lad woke up instantly, and he would have lunged out with a clenched fist if Dave had not caught hold of his arm.  \"Take it easy, Freddy!\" he exclaimed. \"This is the end of the line. Here's where we get off. How do you feel?\"  Freddy shook his head and dug knuckles into his sleep filled eyes. That seemed to do the trick. He was fully awake in an instant.  \"Oh yes, I remember, now,\" he said. \"Where are we, though? What's this place?\"  The German threw back his head and laughed.  \"I will tell you,\" he said and waggled a finger in front of their faces. \"This is the Headquarters of the German Army Intelligence in the field. I am taking you before the _Kommandant_. And now we shall learn all about you two. Yes, you will be very wise to answer truthfully all the questions _Herr Kommandant_ asks.\"  With a curt nod to show that he meant what he said the German climbed down onto the street, and then motioned for Dave and Freddy to climb down, too.  \"That building, there,\" he said and pointed. \"March! And do not be so foolish as to try and run away. I warn you!\"  Dave and Freddy simply shrugged and walked across the street to the doorway of a solidly built stone building. A guard standing in front clicked his heels and held his rifle at salute at the approach of the officer.  \"My compliments to _Herr Kommandant_,\" the officer said sharply. \"_Leutnant_ Mueller reporting with two prisoners for questioning.\"  The guard saluted again, then executed a smart about face and went in through the door. Dave caught a flash glimpse of desks, and chairs, and the part of a wall covered by a huge map, before the door was closed in his face. He looked at Freddy and grinned, and then glanced up into the small eyes of the German officer. Those small eyes seemed to bore right back into his brain.  \"You will do well to tell the whole truth!\" the German said without hardly moving his lips. \"Remember that!\"  At that moment the door was reopened and the guard was nodding at the lieutenant.  \"_Herr Kommandant_ will see you at once, _Herr Leutnant_,\" he said.  \"Good!\" the officer grunted, and pushed Dave and Freddy in the back. \"Inside, at once!\"     CHAPTER FIVE  _In the Enemy's Camp_   The first thing Dave saw as the Lieutenant pushed him through the open doorway was a desk bigger than any other desk he had ever seen. It was a good nine feet long and at least five feet wide. It took up almost one whole side of the room and upon it were piled books, official papers, a couple of portable short-wave radio sets, and at least a dozen telephones. And seated at the desk was a huge red faced, bull necked German in the uniform of a staff colonel.  \"My prisoners, _Herr Kommandant_ Stohl,\" the Lieutenant said. \"_Heil Hitler!_\"  The big German Colonel lifted his gaze from some papers in front of him, looked at Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer and started violently. His eyes widened and his jaw dropped in amazement. He got control of himself almost instantly and whipped his eyes to the Lieutenant's face.  \"Is this a joke, _Herr Leutnant_?\" he demanded in a booming voice that shook the thick walls of the room. \"What is the charge against these two peasant urchins? Look, the clothes of that one, there, are in rags!\"  The high ranking officer lifted a finger the size of a banana and jabbed it at Dave. The lieutenant flushed and made gurgling sounds in his throat.  \"They are not urchins, not peasants, _Herr Kommandant_,\" he explained hastily. \"This one of the brown hair claims he is an American. And this one of the light hair is an Englisher. I caught them trying to sneak past our advance units with an ambulance. They stated that they were lost, and wanted to know the way to Courtrai. When I caught them they were a good forty miles southeast of that city. I did not believe their stories so I escorted them here at once.\"  \"And the ambulance?\" the German asked slowly. \"There were wounded soldiers in it, perhaps?\"  \"No, _Herr Kommandant_,\" the Lieutenant said with a shake of his head. \"There was nothing. It was completely empty. It has never been used. That, also, added to my suspicions of these two. I shall give it a better examination at your orders, sir.\"  \"Do so at once, now,\" the senior officer said and made a wave of dismissal with one hand.  \"At once, _Herr Kommandant_,\" the Lieutenant said in a magpie voice. \"_Heil Hitler!_\"  The German Colonel waited until he had left, then focussed his eyes on Dave and Freddy, and smiled faintly.  \"And now, boys,\" he said in a kindly voice, \"what is all this about? How did you happen to get so far behind our lines?\"  \"We told the lieutenant the truth, sir,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up. \"I was lost. It was all my fault. I had no idea where I was. You have no right to hold us as prisoners. We have done nothing except get lost, and it was all my fault.\"  The German's smile broadened and his shoulders shook.  \"So, I have no right, eh?\" he chuckled. \"You are not in your England now, my boy. But suppose you tell me all about it?\"  \"Very well, sir,\" Freddy said in a quiet dignified voice. \"And you can take my word for its being the truth, too.\"  The English youth paused a moment and then told the story of leaving the Paris headquarters of the British Volunteer Ambulance Service, becoming separated from the others, and after many hours picking up Dave Dawson.  \"And so there you are, sir,\" he finished up. \"A very unfortunate incident, but I've already told you it was my fault.\"  The big German, shrugged, started to speak but checked himself and swiveled around in his chair to peer at the well marked map that took up most of the wall in back of him. Presently he turned front again and fixed his eyes on Dave.  \"And you?\" he grunted. \"Where were you forced to leave your car? And where is this French Army lieutenant your friend mentioned?\"  \"I don't know where he is,\" Dave said. \"When the German planes started shooting and bombing those refugees I....\"  \"One moment!\" the Colonel grated harshly. \"Our pilots do not shoot or bomb helpless civilians. Those were undoubtedly French planes, or British ones, made to look like German planes. Go on.\"  Anger rose up in Dave Dawson. He had seen those planes with his own eyes. And he knew enough about foreign planes to know that they were neither French nor British. They were German, and there were no two ways about that. He opened his mouth to hurl the lie back in the German's face, but suddenly thought better of it.  \"The spot was about seventy miles north of Paris, I think,\" he said. \"I know that a few minutes before, we had passed through a small village named Roye. And I remember looking at my watch. It was a little after one this afternoon.\"  \"I see,\" murmured the German, and an odd look seeped into his eyes. \"And when you awoke it was night? You saw the ambulance of this English boy's, and he picked you up?\"  \"That's right, sir,\" Dave said with a nod.  \"And so?\" the German said in the same murmuring tone. \"So from a little after one this afternoon until your friend picked you up you traveled over thirty miles ... _while unconscious_? You expect me to believe that?\"  \"I'm not telling a lie!\" Dave said hotly. \"You can believe what you darn well like. It's still the truth, just the same. I don't know how I got there. Maybe some passing car picked me up, and then dumped me out thinking that I was dead. Maybe somebody took me along to rob me because of my American clothes. They might have thought I had some money, and....\"  Dave slopped short at the sudden thought and started searching the pockets of his torn clothes. All he could find was a handkerchief, a broken pencil, and a bent American Lincoln penny that he carried as a lucky piece. Everything else was gone. His wallet, his money, his passport ... everything. He looked at the Colonel in angry triumph.  \"That's what happened!\" he cried. \"Somebody picked me up and robbed me, and then left me in that field under the trees. Good gosh! I'm broke, and I'll need money to get to England. I....\"  Dave stopped short again as he saw the smile on the Colonel's face. This time it was a different kind of smile. There was nothing pleasant or fatherly about it. It was a cold, tight lipped smile, and Dave shivered a bit in spite of himself.  \"You are not going to England ... yet!\" the German said slowly. \"There is something very funny about all this, and I mean to find out what it is. Yes, it is rather strange, I think.\"  \"For cat's sake, why?\" Dave blurted out. \"We simply got lost in the dark, and that's all there is to it!\"  \"Exactly!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up. \"It is the truth. We are not even old enough to be soldiers ... unfortunately.\"  The German officer scowled so that his heavy black brows formed a solid line across the lower part of his forehead.  \"Your sharp tongue may get you into more trouble than you think, my little Englisher!\" he growled. \"You had best take care. Now, we will ask some more questions. You both left Paris this morning, eh? You saw troops and tanks and things on the march?\"  \"Millions of them!\" Freddy Farmer said quickly. \"And airplanes, too. I never saw so many soldiers, or so much military equipment.\"  \"So?\" the German breathed. \"You saw which way they were heading, of course?\"  \"Naturally,\" Freddy said. \"They were going into Belgium, of course. And not just French troops with tanks and guns, either. There were thousands of British and Canadians. And there were more thousands from Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa. And the sky was filled with R.A.F. and French planes. And....\"  The German's booming laughter stopped Freddy. The big man shook like jelly and he was forced to blow his nose before he could speak.  \"I must say I"]]]
