Why, I can name several dozen famous soldiers in this war that the Axis would love to get a million times more than they'd want to get us. Do you mean that everybody who's got in a few pokes at the Axis has an F.B.I. escort when he goes on leave?\"  \"Hardly,\" Agent Carter said with a smile. \"Let's say that you two happen to be special cases. Why, you can search me. Lots of times we're given orders, and we have no idea what's behind them. Let's go over and meet my partner. Or is my suggestion of a moment ago out?\"  \"No,\" Dawson replied. \"I told you it was okay by us. Besides, maybe your partner can tell us things.\"  \"If he can, he won't,\" Agent Carter said. \"You can count on that, I'm afraid. His name is Hickson, and it so happens that he's a rabid Ranger fan. He comes from this town. Let's go over.\"  Still not quite sure that he wasn't being made the goat of some crazy gag, Dawson walked with Agent Carter and Freddy Farmer across the lobby to where a thin, almost sickly-looking man of uncertain years was seated in a chair reading a newspaper. He put down his paper and smiled as the trio approached. It was then Dawson had a vague feeling he had seen that thin face somewhere quite recently. Then as Agent Carter made the introductions, it came to Dawson. Agent Hickson had been the man next in line behind him when he had bought tickets for the hockey game. As he shook hands and mumbled some pleasantry, Dave realized he had seen that thin face other places, too, during the day.  \"Did I give you as much trouble, Agent Hickson,\" he asked, \"as Farmer seems to have given Agent Carter?\"  \"No, Captain,\" the other replied with a twinkle in his eye. \"And don't ever go in for crime. You'd be a cinch.\"  \"With those big flat feet, it would be obvious!\" Freddy Farmer chuckled, as the red climbed into Dawson's face.  \"Okay, okay!\" Dave growled and grinned at the same time. \"I'm not like you, with things on your conscience! So naturally I wouldn't even give it a thought that anybody was following me. But look, Agent Hickson, can you add anything to what Agent Carter has told us? Which was absolutely nothing.\"  \"I'm afraid I can't, Captain.\" Hickson smiled, and shook his head. \"Carter and I are just a couple of slaves who do what we're told and ask no questions.\"  \"But you do know _something_, only you won't tell us, what?\" Freddy Farmer pressed the issue.  The F.B.I. man shook his head again and made a little cross mark over his heart.  \"I honestly don't know a thing,\" he said, \"except that I like this particular job. I'm from New York, you know. And I'm a hockey fan, in case Carter hasn't told you.\"  \"He has,\" Dawson grinned, and glanced at his wrist watch. \"And I sort of go for the game, myself. It's hours, though, before game time. Anybody have any suggestions what to do until then? Listen, Freddy! Eating is strictly out, at least for a couple of hours!\"  \"You don't have to shout, old thing; I hear you,\" the English youth replied. \"Yes, I have a suggestion. I've been meaning to see that United Nations display they have at Radio City. What say we go back to the hotel and clean up a bit? These blasted American shoes I bought yesterday are killing me.\"  Dawson started to shake his head, but instantly checked the movement. A gleam leaped into his eyes.  \"Fair enough,\" he said. \"I could do with a clean shirt myself. Come on. We'll take a cab.\"  During the cab ride across town to the hotel, they talked of this and that and nothing in particular. When the cab pulled up in front of the hotel, Dawson opened the door, let the two F.B.I. men get out ahead of him, and got out quickly himself, leaving Freddy Farmer the last to alight. Without so much as a look over his shoulder, Dawson linked arms with the two F.B.I. men and hurried them up the steps into the hotel.  \"Dave!\" he heard Freddy Farmer call out. \"Oh, I say, _Dave_!\"  The two F.B.I. men wanted to stop, but Dawson practically pushed them through the doors.  \"It's okay,\" he chuckled. \"Just his turn to be left holding the bag. He'll be right in. You'll see.\"  That was exactly the case. A moment later Freddy came hurrying inside, flush-faced, with a very hard-eyed taxicab driver right at his heels.  \"I say, Dave!\" the English youth panted. \"You know I haven't a bean on me. Let me have--\"  \"We're all broke!\" Dawson said coldly. \"You were last out, anyway. Go over to the desk, borrow the fare, and have it put on your bill. I'll see if there's any mail for us. Meet you upstairs in our room.\"  Freddy Farmer glared and pursed his lips as though he were striving to hold back the blistering words that rose in his throat.  The cab driver looked at him and scowled darkly. \"How's about it, General?\" he growled. \"I can't keep my hack out front all afternoon!\"  \"Oh yes, quite,\" Freddy said. \"Come along!\"  After giving a look that should have raised third-degree burns on the Yank pilot's face, Freddy went over to the lobby desk and spoke to the clerk. Bursting with inner laughter, Dawson watched Freddy's face grow redder and redder as the desk clerk gave him the fishy eye. Then the clerk went into the manager's office. He came right out, though, yanked open a desk drawer, and handed a bill to Freddy.  \"Now I have got to watch _my_ step, and how!\" Dawson chuckled, and walked over to the mail window.  There was something in the box. It was a telegram addressed to them both. Dave ripped it open and was reading the message just as Freddy Farmer came over. The wire read:       \"Take seven P.M. plane for Washington La Guardia Airport. Report my      office War Department on arrival.       COLONEL WELSH\"  \"And so what?\" Dave asked, looking at Freddy Farmer.  \"So leave it over, I fancy,\" the English youth murmured with a frown. \"I wonder what now?\"  \"You do the guessing; I'm stumped,\" Dawson said, glancing up quickly as Agents Carter and Hickson came over.  There was a telegram in Agent Carter's hand. Agent Hickson looked as though he had just lost his last friend.  \"So we all take an airplane ride instead, eh?\" Agent Carter said, and nodded at the wire in Dawson's hand.  \"You too?\" Dave questioned.  \"Right,\" Agent Carter replied. \"There are four reservations waiting for us at La Guardia.\"  \"Wouldn't you know!\" Agent Hickson groaned and shook his head sadly. \"Wouldn't you know I was nuts to think I could mix pleasure with business!\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Silent Lips_   \"Well, I guess this is the parting of the ways, Captain,\" Agent Carter of the F.B.I. said as the taxicab rolled to a stop on front of a War Department Building in Washington. \"Hickson and I will keep the cab for the ride over to the Bureau. Sorry we all missed an evening in New York together, but there'll come another day, I hope. Best of luck, you two. It's been nice knowing you.\"  \"Same thing, the other way around, sir,\" Dawson said as he shook hands and climbed out of the cab. \"And thanks for the protection--or whatever it was supposed to be.\"  Agent Carter laughed and raised a protesting hand.  \"Now let's not go into that again!\" he said. \"The answer is still that I don't know. Maybe Colonel Welsh will tell you. We can't, because we simply don't know. What's the matter, Captain Farmer?\"  Freddy was just straightening up after sticking his head back in through the cab door opening. He shrugged and grinned.  \"Just looking to see if you had your fingers crossed, sir, while you said that,\" he replied. \"But I see you didn't, and so that's that. Well, cheerio, and good hunting, and all that sort of thing. Sorry I didn't speak to you sooner.\"  \"That's the kind of tough break we get in our kind of job,\" Agent Carter said, and made a flip wave with his hand. \"So long, until we meet again.\"  \"And let's hope that'll be soon!\" Dawson called out as the cab rolled away.  The two air aces stood on the curb until the taxi turned the corner toward Pennsylvania Avenue and was lost to view. Then they impulsively turned and looked at each other.  \"Swell fellows, those two,\" Dawson said. \"Wish we could have had more time together. I've always wanted to ask a real honest-to-goodness F.B.I. man a few questions.\"  \"Then those two will never know how lucky they are,\" Freddy Farmer came right back. \"But speaking of questions--\"  \"Check, and double-check!\" Dawson echoed, and started across the sidewalk to the main entrance of the War Department Building. \"The sooner we ask them, the sooner we _may_ get an idea as to what the heck is going on.\"  The door guard stopped them and requested identification papers. They complied by producing their leave papers and the wire from Colonel Welsh. The guard referred to a book on his table desk, and nodded.  \"Third floor, Captain,\" he said, and gave them each a building pass that had to be turned in when they left. \"Room Three Twenty-Nine.\"  The two youths nodded, returned the guard's salute, and headed for the stairway. The door of Room 329 was just like all the other doors on that floor except that it had \"Colonel Welsh, Private\" painted on the glass. Dawson rapped his knuckles on the glass, and immediately received the summons to enter. Colonel Welsh, Chief of U. S. Armed Forces Intelligence, was seated behind a huge desk that seemed to take up most of the office. He was practically hidden behind a mass of papers, bound reports, and such, piled up all over the desk top.  He glanced up, smiled, pushed back his chair, and rose to come around the end of the desk.  \"Welcome to Washington again, you two,\" he said, and shook hands. \"A nice flight down?\"  \"Fine, sir,\" Dawson replied. \"We had a couple of swell air companions, too. You in charge of the F.B.I. now, Colonel?\"  \"F.B.I.? Me?\" Colonel Welsh echoed. \"Hardly! Not as long as J. Edgar Hoover continues to run it so perfectly. But what do you mean?\"  Dawson stared hard at the senior officer, and then gave a little sigh.  \"Oh, so it's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32331"],["title","Dave Dawson at Casablanca (#3)"],["body","that, eh?\" he murmured. \"I thought that maybe you might have had something to do with the two F.B.I. agents who trailed Freddy and me all over New York. I suppose you didn't?\"  Colonel Welsh didn't reply at once. He motioned them to chairs and then reseated himself at his desk.  \"No, not directly,\" he said in reply to Dawson's question. \"But of course I knew all about it. So you spotted them, eh?\"  \"Freddy did,\" Dawson replied. \"I didn't, because _I_ have a clear conscience. We--or Freddy, I mean--called the turn on one of them. He 'fessed up and introduced us to his partner. Naturally, we asked questions, but they didn't, or wouldn't, admit they knew what it was all about.\"  \"If you'll only explain, sir,\" Freddy Farmer chimed in, \"maybe I'll be able to sleep tonight.\"  \"Of course I'll explain, Farmer,\" the Colonel said with a smile. \"As for sleeping tonight, I wouldn't count on it, if I were you. Those F.B.I. men were following you around simply to see if anybody _else_ was following you around, that's all.\"  \"That's _all_?\" Dawson echoed. \"Who else would be following us around? And why, for cat's sake? Don't tell me, Colonel, that you really believe some Axis agent might try to get in a bit of personal revenge just because Freddy and I have been lucky on a couple of things! Why, that's--\"  \"No, that wasn't the idea,\" the Chief of Intelligence interrupted quietly. \"Though I have had that fear more than once. Your being lucky a couple of times, as you so wrongly call it, was most disheartening to certain Japs and certain Nazis, who have long memories. But this recent F.B.I. business was a bit different. I'm not going to give you details, because I'm pledged to utmost secrecy. So don't waste breath asking questions. This much, though, I can tell you. A list of names, compiled by the War Department, was recently turned over to the F.B.I. Your names were on that list, and you've been watched over by F.B.I. men ever since. The reason, as I said, was to see if anybody was following you.\"  \"You mean, sir--\" Dawson frowned and hesitated. \"You mean--because if they were, it would indicate that the mysterious list of names wasn't as secret as it was supposed to be? That it, sir?\"  \"That's it exactly, Dawson,\" the Colonel said. \"Nice work to have figured that out, too. That's right--that list is most secret. It has the President's approval, the Secret Service's approval, as well as the okay of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces. It is most secret, and it was the F.B.I.'s job to make absolutely sure by maintaining a constant check on every man on that list. Now does that satisfy you?\"  \"No, sir,\" Dawson said with a grin. Then with a shrug: \"But you said something about not wasting breath asking for details. However, I could do with a hint, if that's in order.\"  \"It isn't,\" the Colonel told him instantly. \"For once it's my job to assign you to a certain mission without the right to tell you a thing about it. You'll learn soon enough, and when you do, you'll realize why I have to keep my lips silent. This I can and will tell you, though. It'll be a most pleasant mission, and you'll both get a tremendous thrill out of it.\"  \"Well, that's something, anyway,\" Dawson said. \"I'm all for it, whatever it is.\"  \"Quite,\" Freddy Farmer echoed. Then, with an almost sly look at the Colonel, he asked, \"A mission in this country, sir?\"  \"A mission that will take in several countries, Farmer,\" the Intelligence Chief replied. \"And that _is_ the very last bit of information I'm going to give you. Now just excuse me a couple of minutes while I tend to some of this stuff. Then we'll get along out to Bolling Field.\"  \"Bolling Field, sir?\" Dave cried, and leaned forward.  For all the good it did him, he might just as well have yelled at the man in the moon. Colonel Welsh seemed to forget that either Dawson or Farmer existed as he gave all his attention to the paper work on his desk.  It was almost ten minutes later when he signed his name to the last of the papers, collected them, and slipped them into one of the desk drawers which he locked with one of many keys he took from his pocket.  \"Sorry it took so long, boys,\" he said, and reached for his service cap. \"All done now, though. So let's go.\"  The colonel led the way outside, locked his office door, and touched Dawson on the arm as the Yank air ace started along the corridor toward the main stairway.  \"No, not that way, Dawson,\" he said, and pointed a finger the other way. \"We're still not taking any chances. Follow me, you two.\"  Dawson and Farmer did just that. They came out into the Washington night by a small rear door on the ground floor of the War Department Building. There was no guard there, and Colonel Welsh used another key from his bunch to unlock the door. From the door they followed him through a shadow-filled alley, down another one that crossed the first at right angles, and finally out onto a narrow, poorly lighted street, where a car was parked in the deep shadows of some overhanging tree branches.  \"Jump in, you two,\" Colonel Welsh said, and opened the door. \"I think we can all sit in front. I'll be your pilot this time. But on four rubber tires, instead of wings.\"  \"What about our building passes, sir?\" Freddy Farmer asked. \"Won't the guard--\"  \"I'll take care of that,\" the colonel said. \"You can explain to him, if you want, when you come back.\"  \"Come back from where, sir?\" Dawson asked before he could choke off the question.  \"From a lot of places, Dawson,\" Colonel Welsh said with a chuckle. \"From a lot of places. Now, hop in, and enjoy the ride.\"     CHAPTER FOUR  _Orders for Eagles_   The usually active, buzzing Bolling Field was shrouded in darkness and looked almost completely deserted as Colonel Welsh wheeled the car up toward the main gates. When he came within twenty yards of those gates, however, there was instant proof that not everybody was asleep. Two small-sized searchlight beams cut the darkness and focused square on the moving car. Dawson, from past experience, knew that up in the little towers that housed the searchlights were a couple of machine guns that were also trained dead on the car. In addition, the captain on duty and two armed guards suddenly appeared and closed in on the car in nothing flat. And as if the twin searchlight beams were not enough, the captain snapped on a flashlight and played it straight into Colonel Welsh's face, then into Dawson's, and then into Freddy Farmer's. Just to make sure, the captain turned the light on the colonel's face once more, and then snapped it out.  \"Your pass, please, sir,\" he said quietly.  The colonel produced it, and the captain was completely satisfied. He stepped back, saluted, and gave an order. As the heavy gates swung open, Colonel Welsh slipped the car into gear and rolled on through. Looking back, Dawson noted that the guns of the guards, and the searchlight beams, too, followed the car well inside the field. The idea seemed silly to him for a moment. Then he realized that it would be quite easy for somebody who wasn't wanted to hook a ride on the rear bumper, and thus get inside where he didn't belong.  \"Yes, sir!\" he murmured as he turned front again. \"This is one place that would stop even Superman cold.\"  \"I hope that's true, and I believe it is,\" Colonel Welsh stated.  Dawson turned his head and glanced sharply at the Intelligence Chief. An undernote in the officer's voice had a queer ring. Before he could ask questions, however, Colonel Welsh turned the car in through the wide-open doors of one of the hangars, braked it to a stop just inside, and switched off the engine. A single rafter-light threw a pale glow about the interior, and in one sweeping glance Dave saw that the hangar was empty of planes except for a single Army-Air-Forces, Wright Cyclone-powered, Vultee V-12C, attack bomber. A couple of mechanics and a technical sergeant were standing by the wing. They came over to the car at once, and gave the colonel a snappy salute.  \"All set and ready, as you ordered, sir,\" the technical sergeant said.  Colonel Welsh climbed out of the car, and nodded.  \"Very good, Sergeant,\" he said. \"Roll her out and start her up, will you? We're going to use Captain Billings' office for a few minutes. If anybody happens to wander in, no matter who, you have my authority to send him right along on his way.\"  \"Right, sir,\" the technical sergeant answered, and grinned as though he could name two or three high rankers he would just love to toss out on their ears, now that he had the permission to do so.  However, he didn't mention that little item. Instead, he snapped orders to the two mechanics, and all three of them began rolling the attack bomber out onto the hangar apron. Meanwhile Colonel Welsh led Dawson and Farmer into Captain Billings' office in a rear corner of the hangar. He snapped on the light, closed the door, waved them to a couple of chairs, and sat down at a desk. He drew six envelopes from an inside pocket of his tunic. Each envelope was heavily sealed with wax, and each was made of a peculiar-looking paper. At first glance it struck Dawson that it was oil paper, or shark's skin. At any rate, he had a sudden thought that each envelope was absolutely waterproof.  The colonel placed them in a pile on the desk in front of him, and then rested a hand on top of the pile, almost as though he expected a non-existent wind or an invisible force to snatch them away.  \"You two are headed for Natal, Brazil,\" he began, speaking quietly. \"With stops on the way at Miami, Puerto Rico, San Fernando in British Trinidad, Paramaribo in Dutch Guiana, Belem in Brazil, and Natal. You will land on the government airport at each of those points. Officially, you are making a survey flight for the Army Air Transport Command. At Miami and Puerto Rico you will contact the American commanding officer, and deliver to him _in the presence of no one else_ the envelope that bears his name. On the authority of a letter which "]]]
