Marra to Bonney   What would you do wi’ a doughter—     Pray wi’ her, bensil[1] her, flout her?— Say, what would you do wi’ a daughter     That’s marra to Bonney[2] hissen?  I prayed wi’ her first, of a Sunday,     When chapil was lowsin’ for t’ neet; An’ I laid all her cockaloft marlocks[3]     ’Fore th’ Almighty’s mercy-seat. When I looked for her tears o’ repentance,     I jaloused[4] that I saw her laugh; An’ she said that t’ Powers o’ Justice     Would scatter my words like chaff.  Then I bensilled her hard in her cham’er,     As I bensils owd Neddy i’ t’ cart. If prayers willent teach thee, my dolly,     Happen whip-stock will mak thy tears start. But she stood there as chuff as a mawmet,[5]     Not one chunt’rin[6] word did she say: But she hoped that t’ blooid o’ t’ martyrs     Would waish all my sins away.  Then I thought, mebbe floutin’ will mend her;     So I watched while she cam out o’ t’ mill, And afore all yon Wyke lads an’ lasses     I fleered at her reight up our hill. She winced when she heeard all their girnin’,     Then she whispered, a sob i’ her throat: “I reckon I’ll noan think o’ weddin’     While women are given their vote.”  What would you do wi’ a doughter—     Pray wi’ her, bensil her, flout her?— Say, what would you do wi’ a daughter     That’s marra to Bonney hissen?

I awlus said that foreigners     Sud niver mel on me; But sike a viewly face as thine     I’d travel far to see.  Mary Mecca, Mary Mecca,     I’m sad to see thee here, Wheer t’ wind blaws hask[2] frae Norway     I’ t’ spring-time o’ the year. I’d liever finnd thee sittin’,     Wi’ a bowl o’ cruds an’ cream, Wheer t’ foxglove bells ring through the dells,     Anent a Dartmoor stream.  Mary Mecca, Mary Mecca,     The way thou snods thy hair, It maks my heart go dancin’     Like winnlestraws[3] i’ t’ air. One neet I heard thee singin’,     As I cam home frae toon; ’Twas sweet as curlews makkin’ love     Agean a risin’ moon.  Mary Mecca, Mary Mecca,     I dream o’ thy gray een; I think on all I’ve wasted,     An’ what I might hae been.

I’ve ranted fifty yeer, coom first o’ May,     An’ niver changed my gospil through ’em all.  There’s nowt like t’ Blooid o’ t’ Lamb an’ t’ Fire o’ Hell     To bring a hardened taistril[1] to his knees; If fowks want more nor that, then thou can tell     ’Em straight, I’ve got no cure for their disease.  I willent thole this New Theology     That blends up Hell wi’ Heaven, sinners wi’ saints For black was black when I turned Methody,     An’ white was white, i’ souls as weel as paints.  That’s awlus t’ warp an’ t’ weft o’ my discourse,     An’ awlus will be, lang as I can teach; If fowks won’t harken tul it, then, of course,     They go to church and hear t’ owd parson preach.  His sarmon’s like his baccy, sweet an’ mild;     Fowk’s ommost hauf asleep at t’ second word. By t’ Mass! they’re wick as lops,[2] ay, man an’ child,     When I stan’ up an’ wrastle wi’ the Lord.  Nay, I’m not blamin’ parson, I’ll awant[3];     Preachin’s his trade, same way as millin’s mine. I’ trade you’ve got to gie fowks what they want,     An’ that is mostly sawcum[4] meshed reet fine.  Tak squire theer; he don’t want no talk o’ Hell,     He likes to hark to t’ parable o’ t’ teares ; He reckons church is wheat that’s gooid to sell,     But chapil’s nobbut kexes,[5] thorns, an’ brears.  Squire’s lasses, they can’t do wi’ t’ Blooid o’ t’ Lamb     They’re all for t’ blooid o’ t’ foxes, like our Bob. The Lord Hissen will have to save or damn     Church fowks wid out me mellin’ on[6] His job.  But gie me chapil lasses gone astray,     Or lads that cooms home druffen of a neet, An’ I’ll raise Cain afore I go away,     If I don’t gie ’em t’ glent o’ t’ Gospil leet.  I’ll mak ’em sit on t’ penitential stooils,     An’ roar as loud as t’ buzzer down at t’ mill; I’ll mak ’em own that they’ve bin despert fooils,     Wi’ all their pride o’ life a bitter pill.  I’ve mony texts, but all to one point keep,     Same as all t’ becks flow down to one saut sea: Damnation an’ salvation, goats an’ sheep—     That’s t’ Bible gospil that thou’ll get thro’ me.

The fire-leet casts thy shadow     Owerthwart the kitchen wall; It’s dancin’ up an’ doon, lass,     My heart does dance an’ all. Three times I’ve gien oor love-call     To bring my bird to t’ nest. When wilt a coom, my throstle,     An’ shelter on my breast?         O coom an’ meet me, Mally,         O coom an’ greet me, Mally,     Meet me, greet me, at the courtin’ gate.  I’ve wrowt all t’ day at t’ harvist,     But ivery hour seemed sweet, Acause I thowt I’d haud thee     Clasped i’ my airms to-neet. Black Bess she raked aside me     An’ leuked at me an’ smiled; I telled her I loved Mally,     It made her despert wild.         O coom an’ meet me, Mally,         O coom an’ greet me, Mally,     Meet me, greet me, at the courtin’ gate.  Thy shadow’s gone frae t’ kitchen,     T’ hoose-door is oppened wide. It’s she, my viewly Mally,     The lass I’ll mak my bride. White lilies in her garden,     Fling oot your scent i’ t’ air, An’ mingle breath wi’ t’ roses     I’ve gethered for her hair.         O let me haud thee, Mally,         O let me faud thee, Mally,     Haud thee, faud thee, at the courtin’ gate.

Noisy, chackin’ fieldfares, weel I ken your cry, When i’ flocks you’re sweepin’ ower the hills sae high:         Oft on trees you gethers,         Preenin’ out your feathers, An’ I’m fain to see your coats as blue as t’ summer sky.  Curlews, larks an’ tewits,[2] all have gone frae t’ moors, Frost has nipped i’ t’ garden all my bonny floors;         Roses, lilies, pansies,         Stocks an’ yallow tansies Fade away, an’ soon the leaves ’ll clutter[3] doon i’ shoors.  Here i’ bed I’m liggin’, liggin’ day by day Hay-cart whemmled ower,[4] and underneath I lay;         I was nobbut seven,         Soon I’ll be eleven; Fower times have I seen you fieldfares coom an’ flee away.  You’ll be gone when t’ swallow bigs his nest o’ loam, April winds ’ll blaw you far ower t’ saut sea foam;         You’ll not wait while May-time,         Summer dews an’ hay-time; Lang afore our gerse is mawn your mates ’ll call you home.  Fieldfares, liltin’[5] fieldfares, you’ll noan sing to me. Why sud you bide silent while you’ve crossed the sea?         Are you brokken-hearted,         Sin frae home you’ve parted, Leavin’ far frae Yorkshire moors your nests i’ t’ tall fir tree?  Storm-cock sings at new-yeer, swingin’ on yon esh, Sings his loudest song when t’ winds do beat an’ lesh;         Robins, throstles follow,         An’ when cooms the swalloww, All the birds ’ll chirm to see our woodlands green an’ nesh.  Fieldfares, bonny fieldfares, I’ll be gone ’fore you;         I’m sae weak an’ dowly, hands are thin an’ blue.         Pain is growin’ stranger, As the neets get langer.

Their banks are breet wi’ moss an’ broom,     An’ sweet is t’ scent o’ t’ thyme; You can hark to t’ bees’ saft, dreamy soom[1]     I’ t’ foxglove bells an’ t’ lime.  Chorus  O! Swawdill’s good for horses, an’ Wensladill for cheese,     An’ Airedill fowk are busy as a bee;             But wheersoe’er I wander,             My owd heart aye grows fonder O Whardill, wheer I’ll lig me down an’ dee.  Reet bonny are our dales i’ March,     When t’ curlews tak to t’ moors, There’s ruddy buds on ivery larch,     Primroses don their floors. But bonnier yet when t’ August sun     Leets up yon plats o’ ling; An’ gert white fishes lowp an’ scun,[2]     Wheer t’ weirs ower t’ watter hing.  O! Swawdillls good...  By ivery beck an abbey sleeps,     An’ t’ ullet is t’ owd prior. A jackdaw thruf each windey peeps,     An’ bigs his nest i’ t’ choir. In ivery dale a castle stands—     Sing, Clifford, Percy, Scrope!— They threaped amang theirsels for t’ lands,     But fowt for t’ King or t’ Pope.  O! Swawdill’s good...  O! Eastward ho! is t’ song o’ t’ gales,     As they sweep ower fell an’ lea; And Eastward ho! is t’ song o’ t’ dales,     That winnd frae t’ moors to t’ sea. Coom winter frost, coom summer druft,     Their watters munnot bide; An’ t’ rain that’s fall’n when bould winds soughed     Sal iver seawards glide.  O! Swawdill’ s good...   [1] Hum.

In her hand she held twelve sage-leaves,     Plucked in her garden at noon; And over them she had whispered thrice     The spell of a mystic rune.  For many had come a-wooing     The maid with the sloe-blue eyes; Fain would she learn of St Agnes     To whom should fall the prize.  They said she must drop a sage-leaf     At each stroke of the midnight hour; Then should the knight of her father’s choice Obey the summons of her voice,     And appear ’neath her oriel’d bowwer.  To the holy virgin-martyr     She lifted her hands in prayer; Then she watched the rooks that perched asleep     In the chestnut branches bare.  At last on the frosty silence     There rang out the midnight chime; And the hills gave back in echoes     The knell of the dying time.  She held her breath as she counted     The beats of the chapel bell; At every stroke of the hammer     A sage-leaf fluttered and fell,     Slowly fluttered and fell.  Her heart stood still a moment,     As the last leaf touched the ground; And her hand went swift to her maiden breast,     For she heard a far-off sound;  ’Twas the sound of a horseman spurring     His steed through the woodland glade; And ever the sound drew nearer, And the footfalls echoed clearer,     Till before her bower they stayed.  She strained her eyes to discover,     By the light of a ghostly moon, Who was the knight had heard and obeyed     The hest of the mystic rune.  But naught could she see from her casement,     Save a man on a coal-black steed; For his mantle was muffled about him,     His blazon she could not read.  She crossed herself and she whispered—     Her voice was faint but clear— “Oh! Who art thou that darest ride, Through the aspen glade, by the river’s side,     My chamber window near?  “Say, art thou the lord of Bainbridge,     Or Gervase of Bolton Hall, That comest so late on St Agnes Eve     Within my manor wall?”  “I am not the lord of Bainbridge,     Nor Gervase of Bolton Hall, But I marked the light in thy casement,     And I saw the sage-leaves fall,     Flutter awhile and fall.”  “Camest thou over the moorlands,     Or camest thou through the dale? Speak no guile to a witless maid,     But tell me a soothfast tale.”  “I came not over the moorlands,     Nor along the dale did ride; But thou seeest thy plighted lover,     That has come to claim his bride.”  “Say, art thou knight or yeoman,     Of noble or simple birth? Fain would I know thy lineage,     Thy prowess and thy worth.”  “Nor knight nor lowly yeoman,     But a mighty king am I; Bold vassals do my bidding,     And on mine errands hie.  “They come to court and castle,     They climb the palace stairs; Nor pope nor king may entrance bar     To him my livery wears.”  “But why should a king so mighty     Pay court to a simple maid? My father’s a knight of low degree, No princely realm he holds in fee, No proud-foot damsels wait on me:     Thy steps have surely strayed.”  “No step of mine hath wandered     From the goal of my desires; ’Tis on thee my hopes are centred,     ’Tis to thee my heart aspires.  “I love thee for thy beauty,     I love thee for thy grace, I love thee for the dancing lights     That gleam in thy moon-lit face: And these I deem a peerless dower     To win a king’s embrace.”  “One boon, O royal lover,     I ask on St Agnes Day; I fain would gaze on thy visage fair     Ere with thee I steal away.  “Unmuffle thou the mantle     That hides thee like a pall; And let the purple trappings     From off thy shoulders fall.”  Slowly he loosed the mantle,     And showed his face beneath. The lights went out in the maiden’s eyes; One swooning word she breathed to the skies:     The gaunt hills echoed “Death.”"]]]
