He watched the scouting plane catapulted into the air, and the grim thought came into his mind that Noah, sending forth the dove from the ark, must have been in a similar position. Like Noah, Captain Higgins was sending forth a dove to search the waste of waters.  Besides Craig, there was another civilian on the bridge, Michaelson. Nobody was paying any attention to him. Normally, if he had intruded without invitation to this sacred spot, he would have been bounced off so fast it would have made his head swim. But the officers had other things to think about besides a stray civilian who had popped out of nowhere. Michaelson, after fluttering vainly from officer to officer and getting no attention, turned at last to Craig. Michaelson was waving his note book.         *       *       *       *       *  \"These men will pay no attention to me,\" Michaelson complained, nodding toward the officers.  \"They got troubles,\" Craig said. \"They've run into a problem that is driving them nuts.\"  \"But I could help them solve their problem!\" Michaelson said, irritation in his voice.  \"Aw, beat it--Huh? What did you say?\" Craig demanded.  \"I can tell them what happened, if they will only listen. I was trying to warn them, before it happened, but I was unable to reach the bridge in time.\"  \"You--_you know what happened_?\" Craig choked.  \"Certainly!\" Michaelson said emphatically.  Craig stared at the little man. Michaelson did not look like he had much on the ball but he spoke excellent English, and even if he was a queer duck, he seemed to be intelligent. Craig remembered that Michaelson had been trying to reach the bridge just before the bombers struck, also that the man had been trying to get in touch with the captain just before the warning sounded that the bombers were approaching. Craig turned to the officers.  \"Captain Higgins,\" he said.  \"Don't bother me now, Craig,\" the captain snapped.  \"There's a man here who wants to talk to you,\" Craig said.  \"I have no time--\" For the first time, the captain saw Michaelson. \"Who the devil are you?\" he snapped. \"What are you doing on my bridge?\"  \"He's the man who wants to talk to you,\" Craig explained. \"His name is Michaelson.\"  Michaelson smiled shyly. \"You may have heard of me,\" he said.  \"Are you Michaelson the scientist, the man who is called the second Einstein?\" Higgins demanded.  Michaelson blushed. \"I am a scientist,\" he said. \"As for being a second Einstein, no. There is only one Einstein. There can be only one. But it may be that I can help you with your problem.\"  Craig saw the attitude of the officers change. They had heard of Michaelson. It was a great name. Until then they had not known that he was on their bridge. They became respectful.  \"If you can help us, shoot,\" Higgins said bluntly.  \"I will try,\" the scientist said. He pursed his lips and looked thoughtful. \"If you are familiar with geology you unquestionably know something about 'faults'. 'Faults' are unstable areas on the surface of the earth, places where, due to joints or cracks in the underlying strata of rocks, slippage is likely to take place. There is, for instance, the great San Andreas Rift, in California, which is a 'fault'.\"  \"Sorry, Mr. Michaelson,\" Higgins interrupted. \"If you've got something to say, say it, but don't start giving us a lecture on geology.\"  \"In explaining the unknown, it is best to start with what is known,\" the scientist answered. \"Earth faults are known. When I talk about them, you will understand me. However, there is another kind of fault that is as yet unknown, or known only to a few scientists who suspected its existence--\" He paused. \"I am referring to the space-time fault.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The faces of the officers registered nothing. Craig frowned, but listened with quickened interest. A space-time fault! What was Michaelson talking about?  \"You will not find a space-time fault mentioned in any scientific treatise,\" Michaelson continued. \"There is no literature on the subject, as yet. Certain erratic phenomena, of which the apparent slowing of the speed of light in certain earth areas was the most important, led a few scientists to speculate on the existence of some strange condition of space and time that would account for the observed phenomena. The speed of light is regarded as being constant, yet in certain places on earth, for no apparent reason, light seemed to move slower than it did elsewhere. What was the reason for this strange slow-down? Investigation revealed the existence of what I have called a space-time fault.\"  \"Please, Mr. Michaelson,\" Captain Higgins spoke. \"We are not scientists. With all respect to your ability, I must request you to come directly to the point.\"  \"Very well,\" the scientist said. \"We have fallen into a space-time fault. I have been conducting certain researches in and near this area in an effort to locate the boundaries of what I had hoped would be called--since I discovered it--the Michaelson Fault. Under ordinary circumstances the ship would, in all probability, have passed directly through the fault, though I suspect, from certain data of ships that have disappeared mysteriously, that _all_ ships have not always passed through the fault. In our case, the explosion of the bombs was sufficient to cause a momentary dislodgment of the space-time balance in this area, with the result that we were precipitated through the fault.\"  He paused and looked expectantly at his audience. It was his impression that he had made a complete explanation of what had happened. He expected the officers to understand. They didn't understand.  Craig, watching in silence, caught a vague glimpse of what the scientist was saying. He felt a cold chill run up and down his spine. If he understood Michaelson correctly--  \"We were precipitated through the fault?\" a lieutenant spoke. \"I don't follow. What do you mean, sir?\"  \"Mean?\" Michaelson answered. \"I mean we passed through the fault.\"  \"But what does that mean?\"  \"That we have passed through time!\"  Craig was aware of a mounting tension when he heard the words. Then he had understood Michaelson correctly! He had been afraid of that. He saw from the faces of the officers that they either did not comprehend what the scientist had said, or comprehending, were refusing to believe.  \"Passed through time!\" somebody said. \"But that is ridiculous.\"  Michaelson shrugged. \"You are thinking with your emotions,\" he said. \"You are thinking wishfully. You hope we have not passed through time. Therefore you say it is not true.\"  \"But,\" Captain Higgins spoke, \"if we have passed through time, how far have we gone, and in what direction?\"  \"How far I cannot say,\" Michaelson answered. \"There is little question of the direction: We have gone back. A space-time fault can only slip back. It cannot slip forward, or I cannot conceive of it slipping forward. As to the distance we have gone, in space, a few feet. In time, the distance may be a hundred thousand years. It may be a million years, or ten million.\" He tapped his notebook. \"I have much data here, but not enough data to determine how far we have gone.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Craig was cold, colder than he had ever been in all his life. They had passed through time! Desperately he wanted to doubt that the scientist knew what he was talking about. His eyes sought the reassurance of the battleship. Surely such a mass of steel could not pass through time! But--the sun had jumped, a hurricane of wind had roared out of nowhere and was still roaring through the rigging of the ship. The calm sea had become storm-tossed. And--the radio was silent.  Was Michaelson right? Or was he a madman? Craig could not grasp completely the reasoning of the scientist. A space-time fault sounded impossible. But there was no question about the existence of earth faults. Craig had seen a few of those areas where the foundations of the earth had crumpled. If the inconceivable pressures of the planet could crush miles of rock like he could crush a playing card in his hands, why could not the more tenuous fabric of space-time be crushed also?  The faces of the officers reflected doubt. Craig saw them steal uneasy glances at each other, saw them glance at the bulk of the battleship for reassurance. The ship was their world.  Out of the corner of his eyes Craig saw something coming across the sea. At the same time, in the forepeak, a lookout sang out.  \"I'm afraid,\" Craig said, pointing, \"that now there is no doubt that Mr. Michaelson is right. Look there.\"  Sailing down the wind was a gigantic bird-lizard. With great fanged beak out-stretched, it was flapping through the air on leathery wings. It was a creature out of the dawn of time.  It proved, by its mere existence, that Michaelson was right.  The Idaho, and all her crew, had passed through a space-time fault into an antediluvian world!     CHAPTER III  The Return of the Dove   There were dozens of the great bird-lizards flapping about the ship. Either they thought it was an enemy, to be attacked and destroyed, or they thought it was something to eat. In either event, it was to be attacked. They were attacking it. They would circle it, flap heavily to a point above, then launch themselves into a glide, fanged mouth open, screaming shrilly.  The anti-aircraft gunners knocked the beasts out of the air with ease.  On the bridge a group of tense officers watched the slaughter without being greatly interested in it. They knew that the guns of the Idaho were proof against any creature of earth, sky, or water, in this world. They were not afraid of the beasts of this strange time into which they had been thrust.  The scouting plane was still out, searching the waste of water for land.  The officers of the Idaho were all thinking the same thing. Captain Higgins put their thoughts into words.  \"Mr. Michaelson,\" the captain said slowly. \"I can't argue"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32563"],["title","The Lost Warship (#4)"],["body","you. I am forced to believe that somehow we have been forced back in time. However I am charged with the responsibility for this ship. Back where we came from, the Idaho is needed. I want to get her back where she belongs. How can we accomplish this?\"  The scientist hesitated. He did not want to say what he had to say. He shook his head. \"I question whether or not we can accomplish it,\" he said at last.  \"But we _have_ to return!\" Higgins protested.  \"I know,\" Michaelson said sympathetically. \"The problem is _how_!\"  \"You mean there is no way to return?\"  The scientist shrugged. \"If there is, I do not know of it.\"  \"But can't you make any suggestion? After all, this is your field. You're a scientist.\"  \"This is my field but even I know little or nothing about it. Almost nothing is known about the true nature of the space-time continuum. Only recently have we even guessed that such things as space-time faults existed. We were hurled through this particular fault by accident, the result of an unfortunate combination of circumstances. Whether we can duplicate that accident, and whether it would return us to our own time--I just don't know. Nobody knows.\"  The officers of the Idaho received this information with no sign of pleasure. Craig felt sorry for them. After all, some of them had wives, all of them had friends back in the United States. Or was it _forward_ in the United States, in the America that was to be? It was hard to remember that Columbus had not as yet sailed westward, would not sail westward for--how many hundreds of thousands of years?  All human history would have to unroll before there was an America. If the theory of continental drift was correct, there might not even be an American continent, it might still be joined to Europe. Babylon and Nineveh, Karnak and Thebes, Rome and London--there were no such cities in the world, would not be for--         *       *       *       *       *  The men on this ship were probably the only human beings alive on earth! Men had not yet become human, or maybe hadn't. The Neanderthal Man, the Cro-Magnons, maybe the Java Man, the Piltdown Man, had not yet appeared on the planet!  \"As I understand it,\" an officer said, \"we were sailing directly across a space-time fault when the explosion of the bombs sent us through the fault? Is that correct?\"  \"That is correct,\" Michaelson answered.  \"Then why don't we locate this fault and set off some explosions of our own?\" the officer suggested. \"Is there any chance that we might return--home--that way?\"  \"I don't know,\" the scientist frankly answered. \"Maybe it would work, maybe it won't. We can certainly try it, and if it fails, nothing is lost. Meanwhile I will go over my data and see if I can find some way of accomplishing what we desire.\"  Michaelson went below. The Idaho was brought around. Immediately a worried officer posed another problem.  \"How are we going to find that fault?\" he asked. \"We can't see it. We can't feel it. How are we going to know when we have reached the right place?\"  \"We'll search the whole area,\" Higgins said. \"We haven't moved far and locating the fault ought not to be too difficult. For that matter, we are probably still in it.\"  The officers moved quickly and efficiently to put his orders into execution. The plan was to put the ship in the same position she had occupied when the bombs struck, then use the small boats to plant explosive charges in the water around the battle wagon, charges which could be electrically exploded from the ship. Captain Higgins moved to where Craig was standing. He took off his cap and wiped perspiration from his forehead.  \"What do you make of this?\" he asked.  Craig shrugged. \"I pass,\" he said.  \"But--one minute we were part of a task force and Jap bombers were having a go at us. The next minute--\" Higgins looked helpless. \"Damn it, Craig,\" he exploded, \"things like that can't happen!\"  \"They aren't supposed to happen,\" the big man grimly answered. \"We just saw one of them happen.\"  \"But--\" Higgins protested, \"surely we would have known about these space-time faults, if they existed. Other ships would have fallen into them.\"  \"Maybe other ships have fallen into them,\" Craig suggested. \"In the last war the Cyclops vanished without a trace. There have been other ships, dozens of them, that have disappeared. And, for that matter, how is the commander of your task force going to handle the disappearance of the Idaho?\"  \"I don't know,\" Higgins muttered.  \"He is going to have to report the loss of the battleship. What will he say?\"  \"What can he say?\"  \"He'll search the area, for survivors and wreckage. When he finds neither the only conclusion he can reach will be that the Idaho was instantaneously sunk with the loss of all hands. Remember we were under attack at the time. Remember that intense blue light that flared around the horizon? To the men in the other ships that light may have looked like an explosion of the magazines of the Idaho. The admiral commanding your task force may report that a bomb seemingly passed down the smoke stack of the Idaho and the resulting explosion touched off the powder magazine.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Craig paused and in growing perplexity watched what Higgins was doing. The captain was vigorously kicking the steel wall of the bridge. He was pounding his right foot against it as if he was trying to kick it down. There was a look of pain on his face. Craig watched for a second, then grinned.  \"Does it hurt?\" he said.  \"Yes!\"  \"Then it must be real,\" the big man suggested.  Higgins left off kicking the wall. Craig knew _why_ he had been kicking it--to assure himself that the wall was really there. Higgins was a man in a nightmare but instead of pinching himself to see if he was awake, he kicked the wall.  \"Damn it!\" the captain muttered. \"Why did this have to happen to us?\"  \"Destiny,\" Craig mused. \"Fate. How did the steamer I was on happen to get bombed? How did I happen to be in the life-boat that wasn't machine-gunned? How did we happen to get picked up? The only answer is fate.\"  \"That's a darned poor answer,\" Higgins said.  \"It's the only answer,\" Craig replied. \"Your dove is coming back.\"  \"What? Have you gone wacky on me?\" the startled captain answered.  Craig pointed to the sea. Barely visible on the horizon was a tiny dot.  \"Oh, the plane,\" the captain said, watching the dot. It was moving swiftly toward them.  Craig watched it, a frown on his face. \"I thought you sent out only _one_ plane,\" he said.  \"That's right. I did send one.\"  \"Well,\" Craig said slowly, \"unless my eyes have gone bad, three planes are coming back.\"  \"What?--But that's impossible?\" Higgins snatched a pair of glasses, swiftly focused them on the plane. It was still only a dot in the sky. Two smaller dots were following swiftly behind it.  \"Maybe a couple of those lizard-birds are chasing it?\" Craig hazarded.  \"Nonsense!\" the captain retorted. \"It can fly rings around those things. Those lizards are too slow to keep up with it. But there is something following it.\"  Higgins kept the glasses to his eyes, straining to see the approaching dots.  \"If those things are planes,\" he muttered, and there was a note of exultation in his voice, \"then Michaelson, and his talk of space-time faults, is nuts.\"  What Higgins meant was, that if the two dots were planes, then what had happened to the Idaho had been an illusion of some kind. Planes could exist only in a modern world. They were one of mankind's most recent inventions.  The stubby-winged scouting plane from the ship was easily visible now. It was driving hell for leather for the Idaho. Craig watched it with growing apprehension.  \"That pilot is running away from something,\" he said.  \"Impossible!\" Higgins snapped.  The plane swept nearer. It was flying at a low altitude. The two dots were hard on its heels. They were overtaking it. And--they were no longer dots.  \"Planes!\" Higgins shouted.         *       *       *       *       *  Craig kept silent. They were planes all right, but--He saw something lance out from one of them. The scouting plane leaped upward in a screaming climb. Something reached toward it again, touched it. It began to lose altitude. It was still coming toward the Idaho but it was on a long slant.  \"It's being attacked!\" Higgins shouted, pain in his voice.  Over the Idaho the call to battle stations rolled. Again the mighty vessel surged to the tempo of men going into action.  The scouting plane was dropping lower and lower. It hit the water. One of the pursuing ships dived down at it.  The anti-aircraft batteries let go. For the second time the Idaho was defending herself. Thunder rolled across the waters.  The attacking plane was within point-blank range. Mushrooms of black smoke puffed into existence around it, knocked it around in the air, caught it with a direct hit.  A gigantic explosion sounded.  A ball of smoke burst where the plane had been. Fragments floated outward, slid downward to the sea. There was not enough of the plane left for identification.  The second plane lifted upward. For the first time Craig got a good look at it. His first impression, illogical as that was, was that it was a Jap ship. When it lifted up he got a good look at it. It wasn't a Jap plane. No marks of the rising sun were visible on its body.  Craig saw then that it wasn't a plane at all. It had stubby, sloping wings, but the wings were apparently more for the purpose of stabilizing flight than for the lift they might impart. It looked like a flying wedge.  He could not tell how it was propelled. If it had a motor, he could not see it.  It was fast, faster than greased lightning.  Apparently its pilot had not noticed the battleship until the barrage of anti-aircraft fire had destroyed the first plane. Not until then did he even know the Idaho existed. Like a bird that had been suddenly startled by the appearance of a hawk, the plane leaped into the air. Shells were still bursting "]]]
