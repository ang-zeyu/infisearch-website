It gives a single man command over something complete; in its potentialities from softest to loudest in one and the same register it excels all other instruments. The trumpet can blare, but not sigh; contrariwise the flute; the pianoforte can do both. Its range embraces the highest and deepest practicable tones. Respect the Pianoforte!  Let doubters consider how the pianoforte was esteemed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, who dedicated their choicest thoughts to it.  And the pianoforte has one possession wholly peculiar to itself, an inimitable device, a photograph of the sky, a ray of moonlight--the Pedal.  The effects of the pedal are unexhausted, because they have remained even to this day the drudges of a narrow-souled and senseless harmonic theory; the treatment accorded them is like trying to mould air or water into geometric forms. Beethoven, who incontestably achieved the greatest progress on and for the pianoforte, divined the mysteries of the pedal, and to him we owe the first liberties.  The pedal is in ill-repute. For this, absurd irregularities must bear the blame. Let us experiment with _sensible_ irregularities.                             *       *       *  \"I FELT ... that the book I shall write will be neither in English nor in Latin; and this for the one reason ... namely, that the language in which it may be given me not only to write, but also to think, will not be Latin, or English, or Italian, or Spanish, but a language not even one of whose words I know, a language in which dumb things speak to me, and in which, it may be, I shall at last have to respond in my grave to an Unknown Judge.\"                                     (Von Hofmannsthal: A letter.)

There were the same dusty jars of ginseng root and tigers' whiskers, the same little bronze Buddahs, the same gim-cracks mixed with fine jade. Edith Williams gave a little murmur of pleasure as the door shut behind them.  \"Mark,\" she said, \"it hasn't changed! It doesn't look as if a thing had been sold since we were here on our honeymoon.\"  \"It certainly doesn't,\" Dr. Mark Williams agreed, moving down the narrow aisle behind her. \"If someone hadn't told us Sam Kee was dead, I'd believe we'd stepped back twenty years in time, like they do in those scientific stories young David reads.\"  \"We must buy something,\" his wife said. \"For a twentieth anniversary present for me. Perhaps a bell?\"  From the shadowy depths of the shop a young man emerged, American in dress and manner despite the Oriental contours of his face and eyes.  \"Good evening,\" he said. \"May I show you something?\"  \"We think we want a bell,\" Dr. Williams chuckled. \"But we aren't quite sure. You're Sam Kee's son?\"  \"Sam Kee, junior. My honored father passed to the halls of his ancestors five years ago. I could just say that he died--\" black eyes twinkled--\"but customers like the more flowery mode of speech. They think it's quaint.\"  \"I think it's just nice, and not quaint at all,\" Edith Williams declared. \"We're sorry your father is dead. We'd hoped to see him again. Twenty years ago when we were a very broke young couple on a honeymoon he sold us a wonderful rose-crystal necklace for half price.\"  \"I'm sure he still made a profit.\" The black eyes twinkled again. \"But if you'd like a bell, here are small temple bells, camel bells, dinner bells....\"  But even as he spoke, Edith Williams' hand darted to something at the back of the shelf.  \"A bell carved out of crystal!\" she exclaimed. \"And rose-crystal at that. What could be more perfect? A rose-crystal wedding present and a rose-crystal anniversary present!\"  The young man half stretched out his hand.  \"I don't think you want that,\" he said. \"It's broken.\"  \"Broken?\" Edith Williams rubbed off the dust and held the lovely bell-shape of crystal, the size of a pear, to the light. \"It looks perfect to me.\"  \"I mean it is not complete.\" Something of the American had vanished from the young man. \"It has no clapper. It will not ring.\"  \"Why, that's right.\" Mark Williams took the bell. \"The clapper's missing.\"  \"We can have another clapper made,\" his wife declared. \"That is, if the original can't be found?\"  The young Chinese shook his head.  \"The bell and the clapper were deliberately separated by my father twenty years ago.\" He hesitated, then added: \"My father was afraid of this bell.\"  \"Afraid of it?\" Mark Williams raised his eyebrows.  The other hesitated again.  \"It will probably sound like a story for tourists,\" he said. \"But my father believed it. This bell was supposedly stolen from the temple of a sect of Buddhists somewhere in the mountains of China's interior. Just as many Occidentals believe that the Christian Judgement Day will be heralded by a blast on St. Peter's trumpet, so this small sect is said to believe that when a bell like this one is rung, a bell carved from a single piece of rose crystal, and consecrated by ceremonies lasting ten years, any dead within sound of it will rise and live again.\"  \"Heavenly!\" Edith Williams cried. \"And no pun intended. Mark, think what a help this bell will be in your practise when we make it ring again!\" To the Chinese she added, smiling: \"I'm just teasing him. My husband is really a very fine surgeon.\"  The other bowed his head.  \"I must tell you,\" he said, \"you will not be able to make it ring. Only the original clapper, carved from the same block of rose crystal, will ring it. That is why my father separated them.\"  Again he hesitated.  \"I have told you only half of what my father told me. He said that, though it defeats death, Death can not be defeated. Robbed of his chosen victim, he takes another in his place. Thus when the bell was used in the temple of its origin--let us say when a high priest or a chief had died--a slave or servant was placed handy for Death to take when he had been forced to relinquish his grasp upon the important one.\"  He smiled, shook his head.  \"There,\" he said. \"A preposterous story. Now if you wish it, the bell is ten dollars. Plus, of course, sales tax.\"  \"The story alone is worth more,\" Dr. Williams declared. \"I think we'd better have it sent, hadn't we, Edith? It'll be safer in the mail than in our suitcase.\"  \"Sent?\" His wife seemed to come out of some deep feminine meditation. \"Oh, of course. And as for its not ringing--I shall make it ring. I know I shall.\"  \"If the story is true,\" Mark Williams murmured, \"I hope not....\"         *       *       *       *       *  The package came on a Saturday morning, when Mark Williams was catching up on the latest medical publications in his untidy, book-lined study. He heard Edith unwrapping paper in the hall outside. Then she came in with the rose-crystal bell in her hands.  \"Mark, it's here!\" she said. \"Now to make it ring.\"  She plumped herself down beside his desk. He took the bell and reached for a silver pencil.  \"Just for the sake of curiosity,\" he remarked, \"and not because I believe that delightful sales talk we were given, let's see if it will ring when I tap. It should, you know.\"  He tapped the lip of the bell. A muted _thunk_ was the only response. Then he tried with a coin, a paper knife, and the bottom of a glass. In each instance the resulting sound was nothing like a bell ringing.  \"If you've finished, Mark,\" Edith said then, with feminine tolerance, \"let me show you how it's done.\"  \"Gladly,\" her husband agreed. She took the bell and turned away for a moment. Then she shook the bell vigorously. A clear, sweet ringing shivered through the room--so thin and etherial that small involuntary shivers crawled up his spine.  \"Good Lord!\" he exclaimed. \"How did you do that?\"  \"I just put the clapper back in place with some thread,\" Edith told him.  \"The clapper?\" He struck his forehead with his palm. \"Don't tell me--the crystal necklace we bought twenty years ago!\"  \"Of course.\" Her tone was composed. \"As soon as young Sam Kee told us about his father's separating the clapper and the bell, I remembered the central crystal pendant on my necklace. It _is_ shaped like a bell clapper--we mentioned it once.  \"I guessed right away we had the missing clapper. But I didn't say so. I wanted to score on you, Mark--\" she smiled affectionately at him--\"and because, you know, I had a queer feeling Sam Kee, junior, wouldn't let us have the bell if he guessed we had the clapper.\"  \"I don't think he would.\" Mark Williams picked up his pipe and rubbed the bowl with his thumb. \"Yet he didn't really believe that story he told us any more than we do.\"  \"No, but his father did. And if old Sam Kee had told it to us--remember how wrinkled and wise he seemed?--I do believe we'd have believed the story.\"  \"You're probably right.\" Dr. Williams rang the bell and waited. The thin, sweet sound seemed to hang in the air a long moment, then was gone.  \"Nope,\" he said. \"Nothing happened. Although, of course, that may be because there was no deceased around to respond.\"  \"I'm not sure I feel like joking about the story.\" A small frown gathered on Edith's forehead. \"I had planned to use the bell as a dinner bell and to tell the story to our guests. But now--I'm not sure.\"  Frowning, she stared at the bell until the ringing of the telephone in the hall brought her out of her abstraction.  \"Sit still, I'll answer.\" She hurried out. Dr. Williams, turning the rose crystal bell over in his hand, could hear the sudden tension in her voice as she answered. He was on his feet when she reentered.  \"An emergency operation at the hospital,\" she sighed. \"Nice young man--automobile accident. Fracture of the skull, Dr. Amos says. He wouldn't have disturbed you but you're the only brain man in town, with Dr. Hendryx away on vacation.\"  \"I know.\" He was already in the hall, reaching for his hat. \"Man's work is from sun to sun, but a doctor's work is never done,\" he misquoted.  \"I'll drive you.\" Edith followed him out. \"You sit back and relax for another ten minutes....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Two hours later, as they drove homeward, the traffic was light, which was fortunate. More than once Mark, in a frowning abstraction, found himself on the left of the center line and had to pull back into his own lane.  He had lost patients before, but never without a feeling of personal defeat. Edith said he put too much of himself into every operation. Perhaps he did. And yet--No, there was every reason why the young man should have lived. Yet, just as Mark Williams had felt that he had been successful, the patient had died.  In twenty years of marriage, Edith Williams had learned to read his thoughts at times. Now she put a hand comfortingly on his arm.  \"These things happen, darling,\" she said. \"You know that. A doctor can only do so much. Some of the job always remains in the hands of Nature. And she does play tricks at times.\"  \"Yes, confound it, I know it,\" her husband growled. \"But I resent losing that lad. There was no valid reason for it--unless there was some complication I overlooked.\" He shook his head, scowling. \"I ordered an autopsy but--Yes, I'm going to do"]]]
