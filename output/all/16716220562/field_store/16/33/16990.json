A specimen taken near the Río Grande in Coahuila, opposite Samuels, Texas, and assigned to _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_ by Nelson and Goldman (op. cit.:140), has been examined by us and is referable to _convexus_. This specimen is typical of _convexus_ except for the lesser inflation of the mastoid bullae and tympanic bullae. Conspicuous differences between _convexus_ and _angusticeps_ indicate that the Río Grande is an effective barrier to passage by these rodents.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 14, all from Coahuila: Río Grande, 17 mi.

E Nava, 810 ft., Coahuila; 16 June 1952; obtained by Robert J. Russell, original number 276.  _Distribution._--Desert lowlands of northeastern Coahuila, from the Río Grande to as far southwestward as the Río Sabinas (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body medium for the species (see tables 1 and 2); tail long; hind foot small; upper parts Light Ochraceous-Buff (in summer pelage) and Orange-Buff (in winter pelage), bases of hairs Plumbeous; underparts white to pale buffy; skull small, broad and slightly convex in dorsal outline; zygomata widely flaring; palate short; rostrum short; nasals short; mastoid and tympanic bullae inflated; basioccipital with lateral edges parallel; maxillary teeth small.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_, found to the north, _bullatus_ differs in: Hind foot shorter; skull much broader in relation to length; rostrum narrower but, relative to length of skull, wider; tympanic bullae slightly more inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth smaller. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops angusticeps_, found across the Río Grande and upstream from localities where _bullatus_ is known to occur, _bullatus_ differs in: Body slightly smaller; color paler, especially on sides; skull shorter and broader; rostrum shorter and broader; nasals shorter; mastoid and tympanic bullae more inflated; maxillary teeth smaller. For comparisons of _bullatus_ with the subspecies of _C. castanops_ found to the west and south, see accounts of the subspecies to follow.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_ in small size resembles _C. c. tamaulipensis_ Nelson and Goldman of the lower Río Grande Valley in Tamaulipas, but the two differ markedly in cranial features. _Cratogeomys c. bullatus_ is smaller than _convexus_ but these two subspecies resemble each other in color and cranial characters. Both have an arched skull, inflated mastoid and tympanic bullae, short nasals, and a short rostrum. Comparison of _bullatus_ with _angusticeps_, which occurs across the Río Grande but not directly opposite the range of _bullatus_, indicates that these two subspecies are less closely related than _bullatus_ is to _tamaulipensis_ and _convexus_.  _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_ is especially common in sandy soils in the vicinity of Nava where the mounds were in fallow irrigated fields and other open places between extensive live oak thickets. South and west of the Río Grande the animals were less abundant and lived in heavier soils usually as individuals or in small groups. Specimens were taken at elevations from as low as 800 feet to as high as 2,000 feet.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 24, from: 2 mi. S and 6-1/2 mi. E Nava, 810 ft., 2; 2 mi. S and 12 mi.

Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., Don Martin, 800 ft., Coahuila; 19 August 1949; obtained by W. Kim Clark, original number 1034.  _Distribution._--Extreme northeastern Coahuila from the vicinity of Presa Don Martin southward into northwestern Neuvo León in the valley of the Río Salado and its tributaries at least as far south as the vicinity of Vallecillo (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body large for species (see tables 1 and 2); hind foot short; upper parts Apricot Buff (in fresh summer pelage) and Salmon-Buff strongly mixed with black (in fresh winter pelage); underparts Light Ochraceous-Buff; skull large, especially in females, and broad; zygomatic arches widely flaring; palate long; rostrum broad; nasals long; mastoid and tympanic bullae not conspicuously inflated; incisors narrow; maxillary teeth large.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_ found to the north, _ustulatus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts darker, more rufous and less buffy; skull larger, especially in palate, nasals, and rostrum; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic bullae less inflated; incisors slightly larger; maxillary teeth larger. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis_ found to the southeast, _ustulatus_ differs in: Body larger; upper parts, in winter pelage, darker, more rufous and less buffy; underparts paler; skull larger, especially in palate, rostrum and nasals; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic bullae more inflated; pterygoids larger; basioccipital narrower, its sides parallel instead of convex; maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops subsimus_, found to the southwest, _ustulatus_ differs in: Tail shorter; hind foot smaller; upper parts darker, more rufous and less pinkish-buff; skull shorter; zygomata less widely flaring; palate shorter; rostrum averaging slightly narrower; nasals shorter; incisors narrower; maxillary teeth slightly smaller. For comparison of _ustulatus_ with the subspecies of _C. castanops_ to the southwest, see account of that subspecies to follow.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops ustulatus_ is a large-sized pocket gopher with a relatively larger, skull. In size o£ skull, _ustulatus_ is exceeded only by _C. c. subsimus_ found beyond the mountains in the southern part of Coahuila. In size, _ustulatus_ differs so markedly from _bullatus_ that the two can be distinguished easily by this feature alone. The skull of _C. c. convexus_ approaches that of _ustulatus_ in size, but is smaller in all respects, save breadth of rostrum.  This pocket gopher is found commonly along the Río Salado and its watershed. Fallow cotton fields in the vicinity of Anahuac [= Rodríques], Nuevo León, are preferred living places. This subspecies was found at elevations as high as 1000 feet and as low as 600 feet.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 10, from: Don Martin, 800 ft., 5; _base of Don Martin Dam_, 2; _2 mi. SE Don Martin Dam, along Río Salado_, 2; 5 mi. SE Don Martin, 1.  _Records from Nuevo León._--Total, 14, from: 9 mi. N and 2 mi. W Anahuac [= Rodríques], 1; 4 mi. N and 1 mi. W Anahuac [= Rodríques], 5; 3 mi. N Lampazos, 4; 1 mi. N Vallecillo, 1000 ft., 1; Vallecillo, 20 mi. S Río Salado, 1000 ft., 3.    +Cratogeomys castanops jucundus+ new subspecies   _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 56603, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; Hermanas, 1205 ft., Coahuila; 5 December 1953; obtained by Robert W. Dickerman, original number 2051.  _Distribution._--Arid plains and broad intermontane valleys of east-central Coahuila (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body largest for the species (see table 1); tail long; hind foot large; upper parts in winter pelage Ochraceous-Buff, in summer pelage Antimony Yellow; underparts Pale Ochraceous-Buff; skull medium in size, broad; zygomata moderately flaring; palate medium in length; rostrum broad; nasals moderately long; maxillary teeth small.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomy castanops ustulatus_, found to the east, jucundus differs in: Body larger; tail longer; hind foot larger; upper parts paler, more ochraceous and less rufous; skull averaging smaller; zygomata slightly less expanded laterally; palate and nasals shorter; squamosal breadth less; mastoid bullae less inflated, especially in females; rostrum slightly narrower; maxillary tooth-row shorter. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis_, found to the southeast, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; tail longer; hind foot smaller; upper parts, in winter pelage, paler, more ochraceous and less rufous; skull larger; zygomata more widely flaring; palate longer; rostrum broader; tympanic bullae more inflated; basioccipital with sides parallel instead of convex; maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomy castanops excelsus_, found to the southwest, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot averaging larger; upper parts darker, more ochraceous, and less buffy; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull slightly smaller; zygomata less widely flaring, especially in females; palate shorter; nasals shorter; squamosal breadth less; mastoid bullae more inflated; incisors narrower. From _Cratogeomys castanops subsimus_, found to the south, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more ochraceous and less yellowish; skull smaller; zygomata less widely expanded laterally; palate and nasals shorter; rostrum narrower; squamosal breadth less; maxillary tooth-row shorter. From _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_, found to the north, _jucundus_ differs in: Body larger; tail averaging longer; hind foot larger; color of upper parts more ochraceous and less rufous; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull larger, especially in length, in width across zygomata, in lengths of palate, rostrum and nasals; mastoid and tympanic bullae less inflated; squamosal breadth greater.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops jucundus_ is large, exceeding subsimus in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32623"],["title","Geographic Variation in the Pocket Gopher, Cratogeomys castanops, in Coahuila, (#2)"],["body","of the body, but differing from _subsimus_ in relatively smaller skull. Passage to the north and northeast by _jucundus_ is at least partly blocked by inhospitable mountainous country; the resulting semi-isolation may be one reason for the distinctive characteristics of _jucundus_ compared with those of _bullatus_ and _ustulatus_. Two specimens from Monclova, assigned to _tamaulipensis_ by Nelson and Goldman (op. cit.:142), are here referred to _jucundus_ on the basis of cranial characters and size.  Specimens were trapped in fallow irrigated fields in the vicinity of Monclova. Others were taken in deep soils in desert flats.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 19, from: Hermanas, 1205 ft., 9; _1 mi.

Hist.; 1.5 mi. NW Ocampo, 3300 ft., Coahuila; 16 December 1953; obtained by Robert W. Dickerman, original number 2164.  _Distribution._--Desert plains of north-central Coahuila, surrounded for the most part by higher mountainous country (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body large for species (see tables 1 and 2); tail short; hind foot large; upper parts Ochraceous-Buff (in summer pelage) and Orange-Buff (in fresh winter pelage); underparts Pale Ochraceous-Salmon; skull medium in size and narrow; zygomata narrow; rostrum narrow; palate short; nasals medium in length; basioccipital small and narrow; mastoid bullae not greatly inflated; tympanic bullae inflated; incisors small; maxillary teeth small.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops jucundus_, found beyond the mountains to the southeast, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail shorter; hind foot slightly smaller; upper parts darker, more ochraceous and less yellowish, with plumbeous bases of hairs more conspicuous; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull slightly shorter, more nearly flat, and narrower; zygomata less widely flaring; rostrum narrower; mastoid bullae less inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth slightly smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_, found to the south and southwest, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body slightly smaller; tail shorter; hind foot slightly larger; upper parts darker, more ochraceous and less pinkish-buff; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull smaller and narrower; zygomata less widely flaring; sides more nearly parallel and not expanded anteriorly; palate shorter; rostrum narrower and, in relation to greatest length of skull, longer; tympanic bullae slightly more inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops consitus_, found to the north and west, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot larger; upper parts paler, more ochraceous and less rufous; skull decidedly larger and wider; zygomata more widely flaring; palate and nasals longer; rostrum broader; mastoid bullae and tympanic bullae larger; maxillary teeth smaller. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_ (Baird), found to the northwest, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts, in winter pelage, paler, more ochraceous and less dark-rufous; skull slightly smaller and narrower; rostrum narrower; nasals slightly shorter; sides of basioccipital more nearly parallel instead of wedge-shaped; mastoid bullae less inflated; incisor and maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_, found to the northeast, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts slightly darker, more ochraceous and less buffy; skull narrower; zygomata more nearly parallel and less expanded anteriorly; rostrum narrower and longer; nasals longer; squamosal breadth greater; mastoid bullae less inflated; maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_, found to the east, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot larger; upper parts darker, more ochraceous and less buffy; skull larger in all respects; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic bullae less inflated; maxillary teeth larger.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus_ is limited to the Llano de Ocampo, an elevated, desert plain surrounded on three sides, west, south and east, by higher mountainous country which seems to bar the passage of this rodent. On the eastern side this barrier extends north to the very banks of the Río Grande in the Cañon de Boquillas. This subspecies, therefore, is in contact with other populations of _Cratogeomys_ only to the north and northwest. This subspecies is well characterized by size, color and cranial characteristics.  _Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus_ is not abundant; groups of mounds constructed by one or a few individuals were found in widely separated places. Mounds were often small, appeared old and, in other ways, were inconspicuous on arid flats. The animals were taken at elevations as low as 3250 feet and as high as 4150 feet.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 13, from: 50 mi. N and 20 mi. W Ocampo, 4150 ft., 1; 18 mi. S and 14 mi. E Tanque Alvarez, 4000 ft., 4; 1-1/2 mi. NW Ocampo, 3300 ft., 6; _Ocampo_, 1; 5 mi. N and 19 mi.

Washington, 47:140, June 13, type from Gallego, 5500 ft., Chihuahua.  _Distribution._--Arid high plains from central Chihuahua, east and southeast at least into northwestern Coahuila (see fig. 1).  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops lacrimalis_ Nelson and Goldman, specimens from Boquillas and Marathon north of the Río Grande in Texas, _consitus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more light buffy and less rufous; underparts paler, light buffy instead of dark buffy; skull decidedly smaller; zygomata slightly less widely flaring; palate especially shorter; rostrum narrower; squamosal breadth less; incisors smaller. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_, found to the north along the Río Grande, _consitus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more buffy and less rufous; skull markedly smaller, especially in palate and nasals; zygomata less widely flaring; tympanic bullae more inflated; mastoid bullae less inflated; basioccipital parallel-sided as opposed to wedge-shaped. From _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_, found to the east, _consitus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more buffy and less ochraceous; underparts paler, white or light buffy instead of pale ochraceous; skull smaller; zygomata less widely flaring; palate shorter; rostrum decidedly narrower and, relative to length of skull, longer; squamosal breadth less; incisors smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_, found to the south, _consitus_ differs in: Size smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts darker, more rufous and less pinkish-buff; skull conspicuously smaller, especially in palate, rostrum, and nasals; zygomata less widely flaring; mastoid bullae and tympanic bullae more inflated; incisors smaller; maxillary teeth relatively larger. For comparison of _consitus_ with _Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus_, see previous account.   _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops consitus_ is a small pocket gopher (see tables 1 and 2); the largest adult available to us is much smaller than the smallest adult of any adjacent subspecies. Specimens from Coahuila assigned to _consitus_ compare favorably with topotypes although those from the vicinity of Jaco are smaller, paler and have a narrower rostrum and smaller maxillary teeth. An immature male trapped three miles northeast of Sierra Mojada is tentatively assigned to _consitus_. This subspecies seems to be rare in northwestern Coahuila and small colonies are widely scattered.  _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_ (Baird) may occur along the Río Grande in extreme northwestern Coahuila. No specimens are known from Coahuila, and none was found in the vicinity of Boquillas, Coahuila, in 1952.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 8, from: 3 mi. N and 9 mi. E El Pino, 1; 6 mi. E Jaco, Chihuahua, _in_ Coahuila, 6; 3 mi. NE Sierra Mojada, 1.    +Cratogeomys castanops excelsus+ Nelson and Goldman   1934. _Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_ Nelson and Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:143, June 13, type from San Pedro, 10 mi. W Laguna de Mayrán, Coahuila.  _Distribution._--Desert plains of southwestern Coahuila and northeastern Durango (see fig. 1).  _Comparisons._--_Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_ is characterized by large size and pale color; it is the palest subspecies of _C. castanops_. Of adjacent subspecies, excelsus most closely resembles _C. c. subsimus_ which occurs to the east and resembles least _C. c. consitus_, which occurs to the northwest.  From _Cratogeomys castanops subsimus_, found to the east, _excelsus_ differs in: Body averaging slightly larger; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more light buffy and less yellowish; skull smaller; palate especially shorter; rostrum narrower; nasals shorter; incisors slightly smaller; maxillary tooth-row shorter. Compared with topotypes of _C. c. goldmani_, found to the south, _excelsus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot smaller; upper parts in winter pelage paler, more buffy and less rufous; skull larger; zygomata more widely flaring; rostrum broader; nasals shorter; tympanic bullae larger and more inflated; maxillary teeth larger.  Specimens of _excelsus_ from the vicinity of Torreón, in southwestern Coahuila, are slightly smaller in cranial dimensions than more typical examples of the subspecies. In small size, at least, these specimens show some resemblance to _goldmani_ to the south. The range of _excelsus_ approaches that of _C. c. consitus_ in west-central Coahuila (see"]]]
