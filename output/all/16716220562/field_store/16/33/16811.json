He didn't accept our parole.\"  \"They ought to be usin' their men to fight an' not be after keepin' a whole company here as guards,\" O'Malley grumbled.  \"After the show you put on, they need a company,\" Stan snapped. \"If we'd been good boys, they might have left us with a couple of guards.\"  \"Who started the fuss?\" O'Malley demanded.  \"I stumbled, but that was just to slow down the procession,\" Stan answered. \"I'll admit it was a mistake.\"  \"We'd better be doing some heavy thinking,\" Allison warned. \"If we don't we'll spend the rest of this campaign in a prison camp.\"  There was no time for thinking and very little chance to talk. The Yanks were hustled out to the runways and loaded into a shaky and battered Fiat 20, two-engine bomber. They were escorted by the two squads of guards who stood around with rifles at ready until the plane started down the runway.  Stan was squeezed in between O'Malley and Allison. The space inside the bomber was very limited, for it was not intended as a passenger plane. Besides the pilot and copilot, two men armed with pistols sat in the cramped quarters. The Italians had very thoughtfully provided their prisoners with parachutes. One of the guards spoke English and was not unwilling to talk. Stan singled him out at once.  \"I have been in America,\" the guard said in a friendly fashion.  \"What city?\" Stan asked.  \"New York. I stay one year.\"  \"Didn't you like it?\" Stan asked with a grin.  \"Sure, it was much good. I come back for my brother and then there is war. I must stay.\" The soldier shook his head sadly.  \"After the war you'll be going back?\" Stan asked.  \"Sure. It is a fine place to live, New York. I make plenty money, got friends.\" The soldier smiled. \"I will see you then.\"  Stan laughed. \"You sure will.\" His eyes were on the back of the pilot's neck. If O'Malley reached out he could touch the man flying the plane. Stan bent forward, at the same time signaling O'Malley with his knee in short and long taps. O'Malley finally woke up and answered the Morse SOS. As Stan talked to the soldier he also telegraphed to O'Malley and later to Allison.  What Stan suggested was that they get control of the two pistols. The friendly soldier was bending closer. Stan would offer to show him some pictures from America that he had in his wallet. He would get the man off guard and when he had a chance would grab his pistol and push him over into the cramped back part of the ship. O'Malley and Allison would have to get the other pistol.  \"I think I have some pictures you may recognize,\" Stan said. He fished out a wallet which the Italians had not taken from him. Opening it he pulled out several snapshots of planes he had piloted at one time or another, but he held them so that the soldier had to bend forward. The guard leaned over almost against Stan.  Like a flash Stan's hand shot out and he had the pistol. He lunged forward at the same instant, planting his head in the guard's chest. The soldier went over his stool and landed in a cramped position in the narrow waist of the plane.  O'Malley had leaped the instant Stan's hand shot out. Allison did a good imitation of an American tackle. The second guard lost his gun but put up a tussle. Stan wedged past the struggling men and jammed the pistol barrel into the neck of the pilot.  \"We'll take over now,\" he snapped.  The pilot cringed forward while the copilot turned about. Stan circled his neck with an arm and cinched down tight. Before the copilot could wiggle free, O'Malley was up forward with the other pistol. The copilot lifted his hands. His face was white and he seemed scared.  \"Drag him back and tuck him away with the guards,\" Stan ordered.  O'Malley and Allison dragged the copilot back and crowded him into the narrow rear compartment with the others. Allison stood guard over them, while O'Malley and Stan took over from the pilot. The pilot was not afraid of the Yanks. He did signals of distress with his wings and put the ship into a dive before Stan laid him out with a rap over the head. Sliding into the seat Stan began to fight the old Fiat to get her out of a spin.  She was going down, twisting and shuddering in every rivet and stay. O'Malley finally climbed up front and grabbed the free set of controls. They heaved her out of her spin just in time. Their wings fanned the tops of a grove of trees and they had to lay over to miss the spire of a church.  \"I can handle her now,\" Stan called across. \"I'll go up a bit and then you get back there and have the Italians bail out. We won't need any prisoners. If they kick about it, tell them we'll be setting this ship down on a Malta air strip. That ought to make them bail out.\" Stan grinned at O'Malley.  \"Sure, an' it ought to,\" O'Malley agreed. \"No Fiat iver got to land on Malta under her own power. We'll be shot to kindlin' wood.\"  \"Maybe we won't go to Malta, but that's where we're headed until they bail out,\" Stan laughed.  O'Malley went back and within a few minutes the Italian crew was unloading. O'Malley had convinced them the plane was headed for Malta and they wanted none of the reception they knew an Italian plane would get over that base.  Stan watched them sail down, one after another. As the last parachute blossomed out, Allison and O'Malley crowded forward. Stan had swung due south, and was holding that course.  \"Suppose you see what you can do with the radio,\" Stan said.  Allison laughed. \"There isn't any radio and there isn't a gun aboard this ship, except our two pistols.\"  \"Fine,\" Stan said and opened the old Fiat up a bit more. \"In that case we better get in before dark.\"  \"You better be after rememberin' that I'm commander o' this outfit,\" O'Malley broke in.  \"All right, Commander, the ship is yours.\" Stan eased over a bit. With a grin O'Malley squeezed into the pilot's seat.  \"Now you can be after givin' the orders,\" he said. \"Where in blazes are we?\"  \"We're over Italy,\" Stan said. \"I think the town we just flew over was Cosenza, up the coast from Reggio.\"  \"Do you be after thinkin' that's water ahead?\" O'Malley asked.  They looked ahead and saw a strip of water and a long beach. Stan frowned. \"Must be the Gulf of Taranto. I guess I'm a bit mixed up.\"  \"I say, old man, we better swing around and head southwest,\" Allison said.  \"We could fly to Africa,\" O'Malley remarked.  \"Not on our gas supply. The Italians must be short of gas. They certainly didn't fill this crate up.\" Allison's mocking grin appeared at the corners of his mouth.  \"How much? Don't be holdin' out secrets on us,\" O'Malley growled.  \"It's only a wild guess, but I'd say about forty minutes.\"  O'Malley gave a startled yelp and spun the ship around to a south by west course. \"Sure, an' we're gettin' out o' here,\" he said.  Allison slipped into the copilot's seat while Stan sat on a folding stool behind him. O'Malley gave all his attention to nursing speed out of the old ship. He got her air-speed indicator up to two hundred and fifty miles per hour, but the indicator needle was bent, so there was no sure way of knowing how fast they were going. They left the expanse of water behind and headed over a rugged country. Stan felt certain they were flying down the toe of the Italian boot.  Everything was going fine when Stan spotted fighter planes above them and to the west. He did not say anything until the craft were near enough to be identified.  \"Nine Airacobras off your port wing at two o'clock, Commander,\" he shouted.  O'Malley craned his neck and squinted, then he began to grin. \"Sure, an' there is,\" he said. \"It's an escort we've been needin'. Likely the boys will know the way home.\"  \"Certainly they will,\" Allison said. \"And they'll know a Fiat BR 20, also. This crate looks like a bomber.\"  \"We better duck and go downstairs for a bit of hedge-hopping,\" Stan advised. The Airacobras had spotted the lone bomber and were peeling off like hounds scenting a buck.  O'Malley did not need any suggestions as to what to do. He nosed the Fiat over and sent her down the chute in a screaming dive that threatened to pull the wings off her. Stan glanced at his chute harness to make sure everything was in order. He figured O'Malley would fold up the Fiat like an old accordion when he started to pull her out of the dive.  The Airacobras rapidly overtook the bomber, even though she was power-diving far beyond her limit of stability. Stan saw one of the boys flash in on their tail.  \"Kite her!\" he bellowed. \"Stinger on your tail!\"  O'Malley and Allison both hauled back and the Fiat wobbled and staggered as she started to lift. Stan could hear her joints giving way, then she bounced. Lead whistled below them, while the Airacobra roared down the trail of its own bullets.  \"Close,\" Allison muttered.  Stan squinted up and back. Two more fighters were lining up. It seemed plain that they were surprised at the antics of the Fiat. They had never seen one do stunts like that before. The two came raking in, blasting from longer range. Stan felt the lead rip through the Fiat's wings and body. One bullet plunked through close to his head, ripping a big hole, another exploded back in the tail compartment and half of the peninsula could be seen through the hole.  \"Sure, an' they need shootin' practice!\" O'Malley bellowed as he slipped off on one wing, did a stall, and laid over for another dive. They were now close to the treetops. Another Airacobra dived in and when it zoomed away, they were minus one wing tip and their port engine was stuttering. But they were down among the treetops and O'Malley was hedge-hopping like a wild man. They missed an ancient castle set on a cliff. How O'Malley managed it he himself did not know. One wing lifted and the turrets of the old castle slipped under. Down they went into a little valley, fanning the treetops. One motor was dead and the other was not putting out much power."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32288"],["title","A Yankee Flier in Italy (#7)"],["body","they realized that they were being covered by flak fired from a field ahead of them. The barrage was fierce and concentrated. It sent the Yank fighters kiting up to a safer level. The boys felt sure of their kill anyway. The Fiat had started to billow smoke out of the tail compartment where an incendiary shell had lodged.  \"I'd rather bail out than land in this thing!\" Allison shouted.  O'Malley shook his head and grinned. \"Not one chance, she won't lift a foot. Here goes for a belly landing!\"  They skimmed over a row of trees and headed for an open field surrounded by woods. The Fiat gave up the ghost halfway across the field. She just settled down and hit the earth in a cloud of smoke and dust. Twisting and turning she plowed her way toward the far tree line. Finally she whirled around and piled up. The dust and smoke was so thick the three Yanks could see nothing. Pawing and struggling they fought their way out of the mass of wreckage. They heard men shouting all around them. Bursting out of the smoke and dust, they found themselves surrounded by fifty or more German soldiers.  For a moment the Germans were as surprised as the three Yanks. They had expected to rescue a crew of Italian fliers. The men before them were dressed in the garb of Italian civilians. An officer bellowed an order and the Germans charged in.  There was no place to run, except out on the open field, and that would have been suicide because a half dozen of the Germans were armed with tommy-guns. The Yanks just stood waiting for the Germans to reach them. The officer in command of the rescue group, a tall fellow with a saber scar on his cheek, halted before them and regarded them critically. Slowly a sarcastic smile formed on his lips. He spoke to them sharply in Italian.  Stan answered in English. \"We are officers of the United States Army.\"  The officer looked blank but another officer who had come up broke in, speaking clipped but perfect English.  \"American fliers dressed as Italian civilians.\" He raised his eyebrows. \"We can thank your fighters for shooting you down. Your spy system is very dumb, indeed. Your fighter planes should have known better.\"  \"We were Italian prisoners of war. Our uniforms were ruined. As a matter of courtesy the Italians furnished us what clothing they had.\" Stan spoke stiffly. \"We demand the rights of prisoners of war.\"  \"We will decide what rights you have, but I believe you will be shot as spies.\" The officer turned to his superior and spoke in rapid German.  Allison had said nothing at all. O'Malley just glared at his captors, his big hands balled into fists. Stan moved close to him.  \"Keep your shirt on. We're in a tight spot,\" he said in a low voice.  \"Quiet, you!\" bellowed the officer. \"Do not talk to each other.\"  The ranking officer shouted a command and three German soldiers with machine guns closed in behind the boys.  \"March!\" the younger officer snapped.  They marched toward the woods. The officer moved stiffly ahead. The boys realized that escape from two squads of Italians would have been much easier than escape from the three Germans. They seemed eager to use their deadly tommy-guns.  \"I understand German, you know,\" Allison murmured as he bumped against Stan. Stan moved closer to his pal and Allison went on.  \"The commander is very angry because they were forced to open up on our fighters. Now the location of their guns is known. He is also eager to learn something about the strength of our air forces attacking Sicily and heading for Italy. He hinted we would be baited on by a promise of being treated as prisoners of war if we talked.\"  \"We won't talk,\" Stan muttered. \"Anyway, we don't know anything.\"  Entering the woods they found themselves in a cleverly hidden camp. The boys were lodged in a barracks room with barred windows. Two other prisoners, both Italians, were in the room. A guard stood at the door, while several others paced up and down outside.  \"Looks snug and tight,\" Stan said.  \"Sure, an' we'll soon find out,\" O'Malley growled.  \"We'll go into a huddle and cook up something,\" Stan said. \"We're not in the hands of Italians now, and I don't feel up to facing a firing squad.\"     CHAPTER VI  FIRING SQUAD   The three Yanks seated themselves on a rough bench in their cell. The two Italian prisoners looked them over without interest, then went back to their own talk, which they were carrying on in whispers. Every once in a while they shot glances at the boys as though fearing they were trying to hear what was being said.  \"Suspicious chaps, what?\" Allison said, amused.  \"Wonder what they were thrown in for?\" Stan mused.  \"Sure, an' it matters very little. What happens to Mrs. O'Malley's boy is what's worryin' me,\" O'Malley broke in. \"Ivery window is fastened as tight as the purse o' a Scotsman an' the door is well guarded.\"  \"They'll be coming after us very soon,\" Stan said. \"They'll question us one at a time.\"  \"You'd best act as commander,\" O'Malley said. \"I might plant a fist on the nose o' one o' their generals.\"  \"I say, that's a fine idea,\" Allison agreed. \"Stan, you are in command.\"  It was natural for them to turn to Stan. He had always been the most level-headed of the three in tight spots. He grinned at them.  \"We'll see who they pick,\" he answered. \"But we don't talk.\"  A few minutes later the junior officer who spoke English appeared. He shoved past the guard and stood at the barred door. The two Italian prisoners stopped talking at once. The boys did not get up from their bench. They returned the stare of the officer. His eyes moved over them and paused on Stan.  \"Are you in command?\"  \"I am in command,\" Stan answered.  \"Come with me. The colonel is very reasonable. If you are not pig-headed you may be treated as prisoners of war.\"  Stan got to his feet. One of the Italians had risen. He looked at Stan closely. Suddenly Stan turned back to his pals and bent close to them. In a whisper he said:  \"Be careful. I just got the idea those Italians may be planted in here to listen to what we say.\"  \"Come on, you,\" the officer snapped.  Stan moved to the iron grating. Pulling a bunch of keys out of the side pocket of his tunic, the guard unlocked the door. Stan stepped out on a narrow walk which led to a row of doors. The officer marched stiffly at his side. At a glance Stan saw that the place was well guarded. Not less than a dozen men with rifles were spotted within sight of the guardhouse and of the buildings grouped around it.  \"You will do well to answer all questions truthfully and in detail. Colonel Kittle is a man of action.\" The officer gave decided emphasis to the last words.  Stan did not reply. They were entering a big room with wall cabinets and a desk. Chairs ringed the desk on which lay various trophies and gadgets such as might have decorated the room of any flight lieutenant. Stan spotted a piece out of a Hurricane fighter. There was an American Colt forty-five automatic and a Russian helmet.  Behind the desk sat the tall officer with the saber scar across his cheek. Stan sized him up as a Prussian military man of the old school. Now that he had a good chance to look at the colonel he saw that the man was hollow-eyed, his skin was drawn tightly over his cheekbones, and his short, cropped hair was streaked with gray. Stan snapped a salute, not knowing exactly why he did it.  The colonel returned the salute and waved a bony hand toward a chair. Stan seated himself. The officer went on regarding him intently. The junior officer seated himself beside Stan and waited. Finally the colonel spoke in German. The young officer frowned, then began translating.  \"The colonel wishes to compliment you. The Americans have done very well in Africa.\"  \"Thanks,\" Stan answered warily.  \"He sees no reason why you should not be classed as a prisoner of war.\" The young officer's lip curled. He turned to the colonel and waited.  The colonel spoke for some little time. When he stopped talking the young lieutenant faced Stan.  \"We wish to know the approximate number of fighter and bomber craft based upon Africa. It would be helpful if you could add information regarding additional troops moved in to assist in the action against Italy.\"  Stan smiled. \"My compliments to the colonel. Tell him I am not at liberty to give such information.\"  The officer scowled. He translated and the colonel smiled back at Stan.  \"That will be all,\" the young officer snapped. It was plain the young officer did not like the way his commander was handling matters.  Stan was marched back to his cell. The young officer hurried away. When he was out of hearing, Stan spoke in low tones to his pals. He now noticed that the Italians seemed interested and were trying to listen.  \"The old boy with the scar is commander. He's a Prussian officer of the old school and does not think much of the Nazi methods. He seems to have convinced himself that we are really officers and told the truth about our clothes.\"  \"I'll get more dope,\" Allison said. \"I can understand their talk.\"  A few minutes later the young officer returned and took Allison to the office. O'Malley and Stan sat waiting for his return. The Italians sat with their backs against the wall in silence. Fifteen minutes passed and then Allison returned. The boys went into a huddle.  \"The colonel is not in favor of using the third degree on us. He says he has reports on us from the Italians and knows we are prisoners of war. He said all this in German. The young lieutenant seems to be in with the Gestapo. I gathered that they hate each other.\" Allison paused and grinned. \"The old boy told him off plenty, but the kid is stubborn. He's going over the head of the colonel, so we may have trouble.\"  \"Sure, an' I'll bet the colonel can get tough, just the same,\" O'Malley cut in.  \"Yes, he's as hard as nails but he has the old rules well trained into him. He'll do whatever the big shots order. Guess who the big boy in Italy is.\"  \"Couldn't make a stab,\" Stan said.  \"R"]]]
