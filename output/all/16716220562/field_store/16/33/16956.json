It is only a mere taste, not downright drinking; but ah me, it sets him on fire again, and I who had seen him go in and then by a providence have met his wife coming out from buying that carpet, told her where her husband was, and saw her go to fetch him.  Among the touching incidents of life, none comes nearer me than to see the bookman’s wife pleading with him to remember his (once) prosperous home and his (almost) starving children.  And indeed if there be any other as entirely affecting in this province, it is the triumphant cunning with which the bookman will smuggle a suspicious brown paper parcel into his study at an hour when his wife is out, or the effrontery with which he will declare when caught, that the books have been sent unbeknown to him, and he supposes merely for his examination.  For, like drink, this fearsome disease eats into the very fibre of character, so that its victim will practise tricks to obtain books in advance of a rival collector, and will tell the most mendacious stories about what he paid for them.  Should he desire a book, and it be not a king’s ransom, there is no sacrifice he will not make to obtain it.  His modest glass of Burgundy he will cheerfully surrender, and if he ever travelled by any higher class, which is not likely, he will now go third, and his topcoat he will make to last another year, and I do not say he will not smoke, but a cigar will now leave him unmoved.  Yes, and if he gets a chance to do an extra piece of writing, between 12 and 2 A.M., he will clutch at the opportunity, and all that he saves, he will calculate shilling by shilling, and the book he purchases with the complete price—that is the price to which he has brought down the seller after two days’ negotiations—anxious yet joyful days—will be all the dearer to him for his self-denial.  He has also anodynes for his conscience when he seems to be wronging his afflicted family, for is he not gathering the best of legacies for his sons, something which will make their houses rich for ever, or if things come to the worst cannot his collection be sold and all he has expended be restored with usury, which in passing I may say is a vain dream?  But at any rate, if other men spend money on dinners and on sport, on carved furniture and gay clothing, may he not also have one luxury in life?  His conscience, however, does give painful twinges, and he will leave the Pines Horace, which he has been handling delicately for three weeks, in hopeless admiration of its marvellous typography, and be outside the door before a happy thought strikes him, and he returns to buy it, after thirty minutes’ bargaining, with perfect confidence and a sense of personal generosity.  What gave him this relief and now suffuses his very soul with charity?  It was a date which for the moment he had forgotten and which has occurred most fortunately.  To-morrow will be the birthday of a man whom he has known all his days and more intimately than any other person, and although he has not so high an idea of the man as the world is good enough to hold, and although he has often quarrelled with him and called him shocking names—which tomcats would be ashamed of—yet he has at the bottom a sneaking fondness for the fellow, and sometimes hopes he is not quite so bad after all.  One thing is certain, the rascal loves a good book and likes to have it when he can, and perhaps it will make him a better man to show that he has been remembered and that one person at least believes in him, and so the bookman orders that delightful treasure to be sent to his own address in order that next day he may present it—as a birthday present—to himself.  Concerning tastes in pleasure there can be no final judgment, but for the bookman it may be said, beyond any other sportsman, he has the most constant satisfaction, for to him there is no close season, except the spring cleaning which he furiously resents, and only allows once in five years, and his autumn holiday, when he takes some six handy volumes with him.  For him there are no hindrances of weather, for if the day be sunshine he taketh his pleasure in a garden, and if the day be sleet of March the fireside is the dearer, while there is a certain volume—Payne’s binding, red morocco, a favourite colour of his—and the bookman reads _Don Quixote_ with the more relish because the snowdrift is beating on the window.  During the hours of the day when he is visiting patients, who tell their symptoms at intolerable length, or dictating letters about corn, or composing sermons, which will not always run, the bookman is thinking of the quiet hour which will lengthen into one hundred and eighty minutes, when he shall have his reward, the kindliest for which a man can work or hope to get.  He will spend the time in the good company of people who will not quarrel with him, nor will he quarrel with them. Some of them of high estate and some extremely low; some of them learned persons and some of them simple, country men.  For while the bookman counteth it his chief honour and singular privilege to hold converse with Virgil and Dante, with Shakespeare and Bacon, and suchlike nobility, yet is he very happy with Bailie Nicol Jarvie and Dandie Dinmont, with Mr. Micawber and Mrs. Gamp; he is proud when Diana Vernon comes to his room, and he has a chair for Colonel Newcome; he likes to hear Coleridge preach, who, as Lamb said, “never did anything else,” and is much flattered when Browning tries to explain what he meant in _Paracelsus_. It repays one for much worry when William Blake not only reads his _Songs of Innocence_ but also shows his own illustrations, and he turns to his life of Michael Angelo with the better understanding after he has read what Michael Angelo wrote to Vittoria Colonna.  He that hath such friends, grave or gay, needeth not to care whether he be rich or poor, whether he know great folk or they pass him by, for he is independent of society and all its whims, and almost independent of circumstances.  His friends of this circle will never play him false nor ever take the pet. If he does not wish their company they are silent, and then when he turns to them again there is no difference in the welcome, for they maintain an equal mind and are ever in good humour.  As he comes in tired and possibly upset by smaller people they receive him in a kindly fashion, and in the firelight their familiar faces make his heart glad.  Once I stood in Emerson’s room, and I saw the last words that he wrote, the pad on which he wrote them, and the pen with which they were written, and the words are these: “The Book is a sure friend, always ready at your first leisure, opens to the very page you desire, and shuts at your first fatigue.”  As the bookman grows old and many of his pleasures cease, he thanks God for one which grows the richer for the years and never fades.  He pities those who have not this retreat from the weariness of life, nor this quiet place in which to sit when the sun is setting.  By the mellow wisdom of his books and the immortal hope of the greater writers, he is kept from peevishness and discontent, from bigotry and despair.  Certain books grow dearer to him with the years, so that their pages are worn brown and thin, and he hopes with a Birmingham book-lover, Dr. Showell Rogers, whose dream has been fulfilled, that Heaven, having a place for each true man, may be “a bookman’s paradise, where early black-lettered tomes, rare and stately, first folios of Shakespeare, tall copies of the right editions of the Elzevirs, and vellumed volumes galore, uncropped, uncut, and unfoxed in all their verdant pureness, fresh as when they left the presses of the Aldi, are to be had for the asking.”  Between this man at least and his books there will be no separation this side the grave, but his gratitude to them and his devotion will ever grow and their ministries to him be ever dearer, especially that Book of books which has been the surest guide of the human soul.  “While I live,” says one who both wrote and loved books and was numbered among our finest critics, “while I live and think, nothing can deprive me of my value for such treasures.  I can help the appreciation of them while I last and love them till I die, and perhaps if fortune turns her face once more in kindness upon me before I go, I may chance, some quiet day, to lay my overbeating temples on a book, and so have the death I most envy.”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32563"],["title","The Lost Warship (#0)"],["body","Lost Warship                            by ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS  [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Stories January 1943.

In the life-boat, Craig arranged the piece of sail to protect them from the sun. He hoisted it to the top of the improvised mast, spreading it so that it threw a shadow on the boat. There was no wind. There had been no wind for three days.  Craig stood up and swept his eyes around the circle of the sea. The horizon was unbroken. As he sat down he was aware that the girl, Margy Sharp, who had been sleeping at his feet, had awakened.  \"See anything, pal?\" she whispered.  He shook his head.  Her pinched face seemed to become more pinched at his gesture. She sat up. Her eyes went involuntarily to the keg of water beside Craig. She licked her parched, cracked lips.  \"How's for a drink, pal?\" she asked.  \"A quarter of a cup is all we get today,\" Craig said. \"Do you want your share now or will you wait and take it later?\"  \"I'm terribly thirsty,\" the girl said. She glanced quickly back at the others in the boat. They were still sleeping.  \"How about slipping me a whole cup?\" she asked, her bold blue eyes fixed intently on Craig's face.  Craig looked at the sea.  \"They're asleep,\" the girl said quickly. \"They won't ever know.\"  Craig said nothing.  \"Please,\" the girl begged.  Craig sat in silence. He was a big man with a great thatch of black hair and hard gray eyes. He was clad in a pair of torn duck trousers. Rolled bottoms revealed bare feet. He wore no shirt. Holstered on his belt was a heavy pistol.  \"Look, big boy,\" the girl cajoled. \"Me and you could get along all right.\"  \"What makes you think so?\" Craig questioned.  This was apparently not the answer she had expected. She seemed to be startled. For a moment her eyes measured the man.  \"You've been looking for something that you wanted very badly,\" she said. \"You haven't found it. Because you haven't found it, you have become bitter.\"  Her words made Craig uncomfortable. They came too close to the truth. He shifted his position on the seat.  \"So what?\" he said.  \"So nothing,\" the girl answered. \"Except that we are two of a kind.\"  \"And because we are two of a kind, we can get along?\" he questioned.  \"Yes,\" she answered. She made no effort to hide the longing in her eyes. \"Look, Craig, me and you, we're tough.\" She gestured contemptuously at the others in the boat. \"_They_ aren't tough.\"  \"Aren't they?\"  \"No.\" The words came faster now, as if she had made up her mind to say what she had to say and be damned with the consequences. \"They're going to die. Oh, you needn't shake your head. You haven't fooled me for a minute with your pretending there will be a ship along to pick us up. There won't be a ship. Our only hope is that we may drift ashore on an island. It may be days before we find an island. There isn't enough water to keep us all alive that long. So--\"  She couldn't quite finish what she had to say. Craig watched her, his eyes cold and unrevealing. Her gaze dropped.  \"So why don't you and I split the water and let the others die of thirst because we are tough and they aren't? Is that what you mean?\" he asked.  \"No--\" She faltered. \"N--no.\" Defiance hardened her face. \"Yes!\" she snapped. \"That's what I mean. Why should we take care of them? We don't owe them anything. Why should we die with them? What have they--or anybody else--ever done for us? I'll tell you the answer. Nothing. Nothing! _Nothing!_\"  \"Because they have done nothing for us and because we are the stronger, we let them die. Is that what you mean?\"  \"Y--yes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Craig sat in silence for a moment. Dark thoughts were in his mind but his face showed nothing. \"I have a gun,\" he said, \"the only gun in the boat. That makes me the boss. Why don't I keep all the water for myself and let the rest of you die of thirst?\"  \"Oh, you wouldn't do that!\" Fright showed on her face.  \"Why wouldn't I?\" Craig challenged.  \"Because--oh, because--\"  \"What have you got to offer me that is worth a cup of water?\" he demanded.  \"What have I got that you want?\" she answered. Her eyes were fixed hungrily on Craig's face.  \"What have you got that I want! Oh, damn it, girl--\" The big man twisted uncomfortably. He avoided her gaze, looking instead at the glassy sea.  \"Is it time to wake up?\" a new voice asked. It was the voice of Mrs. Miller, who had been lying in the middle of the boat. She raised herself to her knees, looked around at the glassy sea. \"I thought--\" she whispered. \"For a moment I thought I was home again. I guess I must have been--dreaming.\" She pressed her hands against her eyes to shut out the sight of the sea.  \"Is it time to have a drink?\" she said, looking at Craig.  \"No,\" he said.  \"But we always have a drink in the morning,\" Mrs. Miller protested.  \"Not this morning,\" Craig said.  \"May I ask why? Are we--are we out of water?\"  \"We still have water,\" Craig answered woodenly.  \"Then why can't I have some? I--well, I guess I don't need to tell you why I need a drink.\"  The reason she needed water was obvious. Worse than anyone else in the boat, Mrs. Miller needed a drink.  \"Sorry,\" Craig shook his head.  \"Why?\"  \"Well, if you must know,\" Craig said uncomfortably. \"Margy and I have decided to keep all the water for ourselves.\"  \"Damn you, Craig!\" Margy Sharp said quickly.  \"You two have decided--to keep all the--water?\" Mrs. Miller said slowly, as if she was trying to understand the meaning of the words. \"But what--what about the rest of us?\"  \"It's too bad for the rest of you,\" Craig said. He was aware that Margy Sharp was gazing frantically at him but he ignored her. Picking up a tin cup, he held it under the faucet in the side of the keg. A thin stream of water trickled out. He filled the cup half full, and handed it to Margy Sharp.  \"Drink up,\" he said. \"Double rations for you and me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The girl took the cup. She looked at Craig, then glanced quickly at Mrs. Miller. Her parched lips were working but no sound came forth. She looked at the water and Craig could see the movement of her throat as she tried to swallow.  Mrs. Miller said nothing. She stared at Craig and the girl as if she did not understand what she was seeing.  \"Damn you, Craig,\" Margy Sharp said.  \"Go on and drink,\" the big man answered. \"That's what you wanted, isn't it?\"  \"Y--yes.\"  \"Then drink!\"  \"Oh, damn you--\" Tears were in the girl's eyes. While Craig watched woodenly, she turned and crawled back to where Mrs. Miller was sitting.  \"Craig was only teasing,\" she said gently. \"He's a great teaser. He meant for you to have the water all the time. Here, Mrs. Miller, this is for you.\"  \"Thank you, dear; thank you ever so much.\" Mrs. Miller drank the water slowly, in little sips. Margy Sharp watched her. Craig could see the girl trembling. When the last drop was gone, she brought the cup back to Craig--and flung it in his face.  \"I could kill you!\" she gasped.  \"I gave you what you wanted,\" he said. His voice was impersonal but the hardness had gone from his eyes.  Sobbing, Margy Sharp collapsed in the bottom of the boat. She hid her face in her hands.  \"Here,\" Craig said.  She looked up. He had drawn a fourth of a cup of water and was holding it toward her.  \"I--I gave my share to Mrs. Miller,\" she whispered.  \"I know you did,\" Craig answered. \"This is my share.\"  \"But--\"  \"Water would only rust my stomach,\" he said. \"Take it.\"  The girl drank. She looked at Craig. There were stars in her eyes.  He leaned forward and patted her on the shoulder. \"You'll do, Margy,\" he said. \"You'll do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The boat floated in the glassy sea. The long ground swell of the Pacific, marching aimlessly toward some unknown shore, lifted it steadily up and down, giving the boat the appearance of moving. An empty tin can, thrown overboard three days previously, floated beside the boat. A school of flying fish, fleeing from some pursuing maw beneath the surface, skipped from wave to wave.  Besides Craig, Margy Sharp, and Mrs. Miller, there were three other persons in the boat, all men. They were: English, a blond youth; Michaelson, a little bird of a man who seemed not yet to have comprehended what had happened to them, or to care; and Voronoff, whose chief distinguishing characteristic was a pair of furtive eyes. English had been wounded. He sat up and looked over the side of the boat. Pointing, he suddenly cried out:  \"Look! Look! There's a dragon! A flying dragon!\"  \"Easy, old man,\" Craig said gently. For two days English had been delirious. The infection that had developed in his wound was quite beyond the curative powers of the simple medicines carried among the emergency stores of the life boat.  \"It's a dragon!\" the youth shouted. \"It's going to get us.\"  He stared at something that he could see coming through the air.  Craig drew his pistol. \"If it comes after us, I'll shoot it,\" he said, displaying the gun. \"See this pistol.\"  \"That won't stop _this_ dragon,\" English insisted. \"Oh--oh--\" His eyes widened with fright as he watched something coming through the sky. He ducked down in the bottom of the boat, hid his face in his hands. Men, caught unprotected in the open by a bombing raid, threw themselves to the ground like that, while they waited for the bombs to fall. A few minutes later, English looked up. Relief showed on his face.  \"It's gone away,\" he said. \"It flew over and didn't see us.\"  \"There was no danger,\" Craig said gently. \"It wouldn't have harmed us. It was a tame dragon.\"  \"There aren't any tame dragons!\" the youth said scornfully. He was looking again at the sea. \"There's a snake!\" he yelled. \"A"]]]
