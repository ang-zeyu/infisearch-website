According to these figures beef should cost in the market twice what veal costs, and yet the butcher charges nearly the same for the two. It would save food for milk production if steers were eaten as veal and not fed up into beef cattle. A suitable tax on all steers over a year old would accomplish this result. If all heifers were developed into milch cows and no cow capable of giving milk in quantity were slaughtered, the country would be placed on a much better basis than at present. It might make beef expensive, but there is every reason why it should be expensive. It would increase the dairy business, which is evidently a need of the times, something for the protection of the welfare of mankind. For it must be remembered that a well-nourished cow during a single year will give in the form of milk as much protein and two and a half times the number of calories as are contained in her own body.  This was written before the publication of the following words of Armsby, the foremost authority on animal nutrition:[2]     Roast pig, to those who like it, is not only a delicacy but a    valuable article of diet, but nevertheless, it is possible to    pay too high a price for it, and while a proposal to restrict    rather than to promote meat production in the present crisis    may appear both irrational and unpatriotic it may nevertheless    be in the interest of true food economy....     It may be roughly estimated that about 24 per cent. of the    energy of grain is recovered for human consumption in pork,    about 18 per cent. in milk and only about 3.5 per cent. in    beef and mutton. In other words, the farmer who feeds bread    grains to his stock is burning up 75 to 97 per cent. of them    in order to produce for us a small residue of roast pig, and    so is diminishing the total stock of human food....     The task of the stock feeder must be to utilize through his    skill and knowledge the inedible products of the farm and    factory, such as hay, corn stalks, straw, bran, brewers' and    distillers' grains, gluten feed, and the like, and to make at    least a fraction of them available for man's use. In so doing    he will be really adding to the food supply and will be    rendering a great public service. Rather than seek to    stimulate live stock husbandry the ideal should be to adjust    it to the limits set by the available supply of forage crops    and by-product feeding stuffs while, on the other hand,    utilizing these to the greatest practicable extent, because in    this way we save some of what would otherwise be a total    loss....     The hog is the great competitor of man for the higher grades    of food, and in swine husbandry as ordinarily conducted we are    in danger of paying too much for our roast pig. Cattle and    sheep, on the other hand, although less efficient as    converters, can utilize products which man can not use and    save some of their potential value as human food. From this    point of view, as well as on account of the importance of milk    to infants and invalids, the high economy of food production    by the dairy cow deserves careful consideration, although of    course the large labor requirement is a counterbalancing    factor.     At any rate, it is clear that at the present time enthusiastic    but ill-considered \"booming\" of live stock production may do    more harm than good. If it is desirable to restrict or    prohibit the production of alcohol from grain or potatoes on    the ground that it involves a waste of food value, the same    reason calls for restriction of the burning-up of these    materials to produce roast pig. This means, of course, a    limited meat supply. To some of us this may seem a hardship.    Meat, however, is by no means the essential that we have been    wont to suppose and partial deprivation of it is not    inconsistent with high bodily efficiency. Certainly no    patriotic citizen would wish to insist on his customary    allowance of roast pig at the cost of the food supply of his    brothers in the trenches.  [2] \"Roast Pig,\" _Science_, 1917, xlvi, 160.  The United States Department of Agriculture has estimated that a pig that has reached the weight of 150 pounds should be slaughtered, because beyond that weight the cost of the quantity of feed required to maintain the animal is out of proportion to the gain in food value of the pig. One might, therefore, call a pig weighing 150 pounds a _maximal economic hog_.     II  CALORIES IN COMMON LIFE   A person is properly nourished who receives adequate energy in the form of carbohydrate and fat (and incidentally protein); adequate material for repair of wornout parts, such as protein and mineral salts; and the diet must contain certain accessory food substances known as food hormones or \"vitamins.\" Also, it must contain water. But this is not all, for the food offered must be acceptable to the palate of the individual. A member of the French Scientific Commission which visited the United States in the summer of 1917, when questioned regarding the use of corn bread in France, replied \"on ne peut pas changer des habitudes.\" The proper nutrition of an individual depends, therefore, not only upon a sufficient supply of food from a mechanistic standpoint, but also upon the reasonable satisfaction of the sense of appetite. These dual fundamentals of proper nutrition should be ever borne in mind.  Heat from the sun enters into the composition of the food substances when they are being built up in the plants, and this energy, which is latent in the food, is set free in the animal body and is used as the source of power behind all the physical activities of the body. The energy can all be recovered as heat and measured in the form of calories. According to the principles of the law of the conservation of energy, heat is not destructible. The understanding of the value of a calorie is indispensable for the comprehension of nutrition. A calorie is the measure of a unit of heat, or the quantity of heat necessary to raise a liter of water from 0° to 1° Centigrade. Apparatus has been invented for measuring the heat production of a man, an apparatus which is called a calorimeter or a measurer of calories. If one puts a man weighing, say, 156 pounds in the box of such an apparatus, so that he lies comfortably on a bed in complete muscular relaxation, and before his breakfast, one finds that he produces 70 calories an hour. Only in certain types of disease is there any variation from this normal, though of course the weight of the man makes a difference in his requirement for energy. If, at the same time the subject is in the box, the quantity of oxygen which he absorbs is measured and if certain other chemical analyses be carried out, one can calculate the exact amounts of protein, fat, and sugar which have been oxidized by this oxygen. Now, if one calculates how much heat ought to have been set free from the oxidation of these quantities of protein fat and carbohydrate, it is discovered that the heat which ought to have been produced is exactly that quantity which was measured as having been produced by the man. This measurement represents the _basal metabolism_ of a man at complete rest, when his oxidative activities are at their lowest ebb.  The basal metabolism as measured by 70 calories per hour in the case of this individual represents the sum of the fuel needed--(1) to maintain the beating of the heart, which every minute of a man's life moves the blood or one-twentieth part of the weight of the body, in a circle through the blood-vessels; (2) to maintain the muscles of respiration that the blood may be purified in the lungs; (3) to maintain the body temperature at that constant level which is so characteristic that a slight variation signifies illness, and (4) to maintain in the living state the numerous tissues of the body. Any extraneous muscular movements are carried out in virtue of an increased oxidation of materials and the heat production rises above the level of the basal metabolism with increased muscular effort. For a long time the power for the maintenance of the human machine can be furnished by its own body fat, as is seen in cases of prolonged fasting, but usually the power is derived instead from the food-fuel which is taken. The great question in the world to-day is whether or not a sufficient quantity of food-fuel is available to support the human family. The question of calories is not an academic one, but an intensely practical one.  Science strives to express itself in mathematic terms, and this paper is written with that end in view.  Phenomena of life are phenomena of motion. These motions are maintained at the expense of chemical energy liberated in the oxidative breakdown of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Furthermore, the protein structure of the body cells and the salts of the bones and other tissues are in a constant state of wearing down. The energy for the human machine and the materials for its self-repair are taken in the form of food. The general term _metabolism_ includes all the chemical activities which take place under the influence of living cells.  The total quantity of heat produced by the body is a measure of the intensity of the oxidation of carbohydrate, fat, and protein within the body.  It is important to know definitely whether there is any constant measure of the level of the basal metabolism in normal people, so that one may determine in cases of disease whether the heat production is normal or increased or decreased.  Rubner discovered that the heat production of mammalia during rest was the same per square meter of surface whether the being was a horse, a man, a dog, or a mouse. The proposition has appeared so improbable as to call forth much antagonism. DuBois deserves the credit of having established this relationship for man beyond the possibility of a doubt. He was able to do this on account of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32472"],["title","Food in War Time (#3)"],["body","of a new and accurate method of measuring the area of the body surface. It appears from his work that the _basal metabolism_ for men between twenty and fifty years old is approximately 40 calories per hour per square meter of body surface, within a ± error of 10 per cent.  Boothby has found that the metabolism of patients who have recovered their health after hospital operations and who have been confined in the hospital between twenty and fifty days does not vary from the normal standard of DuBois.  It has been found by DuBois that the basal metabolism in boys of twelve is 25 per cent. higher than for an adult of the same height and weight, or {50} calories per square meter of body surface; and that in boys of fifteen the metabolism is 11 per cent. higher than for the adult of the same size and shape, or {44} calories per square meter of body surface (unpublished work of DuBois). These results explain the large appetites of boys.  Women show a metabolism which is 7 per cent. lower than that of men, or {37} calories per hour per square meter of surface.  From the charts of the average heights and weights of men varying between fifteen and fifty-five years old, given by American life insurance companies, Mr. H. V. Atkinson, of my laboratory, has calculated the basal metabolism in a table here presented. Unfortunately, the weights given in these statistics include clothes worn by the individuals. The calculated heat production, however, is in each case based upon the weight without clothes. The table is computed from the following values:                      Calories per                     square meter   Age in years       of surface    15                    44   20-50                 40   55                    37  The table may also be used as follows:     To find the metabolism of--     Women between twenty to fifty years, multiply values for man    by 0.93.     Boys of twelve to thirteen years, multiply values for boys of    fifteen years by 1.10.   THE BASAL METABOLISM OF MEN  _Calculated from values of the basal metabolism determined by the methods of DuBois and applied to a table showing the average weights of 221,819 men of different ages and heights compiled from the statistics of the medico-actuarial investigation of 1912._    ------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------       Age.    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |     Heat per  | 5 ft.| 5 ft.| 5 ft.| 5 ft.| 5 ft.| 5 ft.| 6 ft.| 6 ft.| 6 ft.   square meter| 0 in.| 2 in.| 4 in.| 6 in.| 8 in.|10 in.| 0 in.| 2 in.| 4 in.    of surface |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   ------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------               |  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.|  Lbs.               | Cals.| Cals.| Cals.| Cals.| Cals.| Cals.| Cals.| Cals.| Cals.   15 years    |  107 |  112 |  118 |  126 |  134 |  142 |  152 |  162 |  172   44 calories |{1510}|{1584}|{1658}|{1753}|{1837}|{1922}|{2006}|{2096}|{2186}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   20 years    |  117 |  122 |  128 |  136 |  144 |  152 |  161 |  171 |  181   40 calories |{1430}|{1498}|{1565}|{1647}|{1719}|{1796}|{1868}|{1949}|{2035}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   25 years    |  122 |  126 |  133 |  141 |  149 |  157 |  167 |  179 |  189   40 calories |{1459}|{1517}|{1594}|{1671}|{1738}|{1820}|{1896}|{1992}|{2083}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   30 years    |  126 |  130 |  136 |  144 |  152 |  161 |  172 |  184 |  196   40 calories |{1478}|{1536}|{1604}|{1685}|{1757}|{1839}|{1920}|{2007}|{2112}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   35 years    |  128 |  132 |  138 |  146 |  155 |  165 |  176 |  189 |  201   40 calories |{1488}|{1556}|{1613}|{1695}|{1767}|{1853}|{1939}|{2035}|{2136}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   40 years    |  131 |  135 |  141 |  149 |  158 |  168 |  180 |  193 |  206   40 calories |{1498}|{1565}|{1623}|{1709}|{1781}|{1863}|{1959}|{2055}|{2160}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   45 years    |  133 |  137 |  143 |  151 |  160 |  170 |  182 |  195 |  209   40 calories |{1507}|{1570}|{1632}|{1719}|{1791}|{1872}|{1968}|{2064}|{2169}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   50 years    |  134 |  138 |  144 |  152 |  161 |  171 |  183 |  197 |  211   40 calories |{1517}|{1575}|{1642}|{1724}|{1796}|{1881}|{1973}|{2074}|{2184}               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   55 years    |  135 |  139 |  145 |  153 |  163 |  173 |  184 |  198 |  212   37 calories |{1449}|{1485}|{1548}|{1620}|{1692}|{1773}|{1854}|{1949}|{2052}   ------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------  The basal metabolism of an average boy of thirteen years of age weighing 80 pounds and of a height of 4 feet, 10 inches, may be calculated as 1525 calories per day. This is the same as that of a man twenty-five years old, weighing 126 pounds and 5 feet, 2 inches tall.  A boy thirteen years old and weighing 156 pounds, his height being 6 feet, 1 inch (there are such cases), would have a basal metabolism of 2300 calories, or larger than that of any grown man given in the table--larger than a man weighing 211 pounds and 6 feet, 4 inches in height. I personally know a boy of this age and size. His parents are said to have sent him to boarding school in order to reduce their food bills.  It is evident from this discussion that the food requirement of boys over twelve years old is about the same as that of men. The emaciation of the children of the poor probably reduces their requirement of food. It is not generally recognized that the boy needs as much food as his father. The requirements of girls have not been investigated, but they probably need as much as their mothers.  These data will give with close scientific precision the _minimal requirement for energy_ which is necessary for the maintenance of the bed-ridden.  Ordinary life, however, is not constituted after this fashion. \"By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.\"  From the work of F. G. Benedict one may calculate the increase in the basal metabolism, as follows:                                 Increase in                                 the basal                                 metabolism   Occupation                   in per cent.

Passing to a consideration of the subject of mechanical work done by a man, one finds that it requires about 1.1 calories to transport a pound of body weight three miles during an hour, and that increasing power must be generated if the speed is increased above this rate of _maximal economic velocity_.  These relations are shown below:                               Extra calories                            per hour required                             to move 1 pound   Rate of movement              of body    Walking 3 miles per hour        1.1   Walking 5.3 miles per hour      3.6   Running 5.3 miles per hour      3.1  If one wishes to determine the heat production of a man weighing 156 pounds and 5 feet, 7 inches in height, and who is walking or running, the following calculations can be made:    Rate of travel per hour in miles            3[3]  5.3[3]  5.3[4]                                              Cals.

[4] Running.  If the man's food cost 10 cents a thousand calories, it may be calculated that he would have to walk over eight miles at a rate of three miles per hour in order to save money when he pays a 5-cent carfare. (This, however, does not include the cost of shoe leather.)  The carrying of a load of 44 pounds is done at the same expenditure of energy as the carrying of one's own body weight when the rate is three miles an hour, so the soldier's equipment would call for the added expenditure of 48 calories (44 × 1.1), making his total hourly expenditure of energy nearly 300 calories (249 + 44) during a hike on a level road. His daily requirement for energy might be:                                                           Calories    Sleeping 8 hours at 70 calories per hour                  560   Resting in camp 6 hours at 77 calories per hour           462   Hike of 30 miles, 10 hours at 300 calories per hour      3000                                                            ----                                                            4022  This would be the heat production of a soldier on a day of a \"forced march.\" The ordinary day's march is only fifteen miles.  This assumes a level road. If, however, there are hills to climb and the body weight and the pack are lifted 1000 feet during the hike, this is done at the additional expense of approximately 0.96 calory of energy per pound of weight lifted. If the man weighed 156 pounds and the pack 44 pounds, the additional fuel requirement would be 192 calories (200 × 0.96). The total energy requirement for this kind of a hike would have been 4200 calories. Walking down hill is accomplished at an "]]]
