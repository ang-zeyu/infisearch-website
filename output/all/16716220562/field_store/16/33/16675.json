The phone rang and Burckhardt picked it up abstractedly. \"Contro Chemicals Downtown, Burckhardt speaking.\"  The voice said, \"This is Swanson,\" and stopped.  Burckhardt waited expectantly, but that was all. He said, \"Hello?\"  Again the pause. Then Swanson asked in sad resignation, \"Still nothing, eh?\"  \"Nothing what? Swanson, is there something you want? You came up to me yesterday and went through this routine. You--\"  The voice crackled: \"Burckhardt! Oh, my good heavens, _you remember_! Stay right there--I'll be down in half an hour!\"  \"What's this all about?\"  \"Never mind,\" the little man said exultantly. \"Tell you about it when I see you. Don't say any more over the phone--somebody may be listening. Just wait there. Say, hold on a minute. Will you be alone in the office?\"  \"Well, no. Miss Mitkin will probably--\"  \"Hell. Look, Burckhardt, where do you eat lunch? Is it good and noisy?\"  \"Why, I suppose so. The Crystal Cafe. It's just about a block--\"  \"I know where it is. Meet you in half an hour!\" And the receiver clicked.         *       *       *       *       *  The Crystal Cafe was no longer painted red, but the temperature was still up. And they had added piped-in music interspersed with commercials. The advertisements were for Frosty-Flip, Marlin Cigarettes--\"They're sanitized,\" the announcer purred--and something called Choco-Bite candy bars that Burckhardt couldn't remember ever having heard of before. But he heard more about them quickly enough.  While he was waiting for Swanson to show up, a girl in the cellophane skirt of a nightclub cigarette vendor came through the restaurant with a tray of tiny scarlet-wrapped candies.  \"Choco-Bites are _tangy_,\" she was murmuring as she came close to his table. \"Choco-Bites are _tangier_ than tangy!\"  Burckhardt, intent on watching for the strange little man who had phoned him, paid little attention. But as she scattered a handful of the confections over the table next to his, smiling at the occupants, he caught a glimpse of her and turned to stare.  \"Why, Miss Horn!\" he said.  The girl dropped her tray of candies.  Burckhardt rose, concerned over the girl. \"Is something wrong?\"  But she fled.  The manager of the restaurant was staring suspiciously at Burckhardt, who sank back in his seat and tried to look inconspicuous. He hadn't insulted the girl! Maybe she was just a very strictly reared young lady, he thought--in spite of the long bare legs under the cellophane skirt--and when he addressed her, she thought he was a masher.  Ridiculous idea. Burckhardt scowled uneasily and picked up his menu.  \"Burckhardt!\" It was a shrill whisper.  Burckhardt looked up over the top of his menu, startled. In the seat across from him, the little man named Swanson was sitting, tensely poised.  \"Burckhardt!\" the little man whispered again. \"Let's get out of here! They're on to you now. If you want to stay alive, come on!\"  There was no arguing with the man. Burckhardt gave the hovering manager a sick, apologetic smile and followed Swanson out. The little man seemed to know where he was going. In the street, he clutched Burckhardt by the elbow and hurried him off down the block.  \"Did you see her?\" he demanded. \"That Horn woman, in the phone booth? She'll have them here in five minutes, believe me, so hurry it up!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Although the street was full of people and cars, nobody was paying any attention to Burckhardt and Swanson. The air had a nip in it--more like October than June, Burckhardt thought, in spite of the weather bureau. And he felt like a fool, following this mad little man down the street, running away from some \"them\" toward--toward what? The little man might be crazy, but he was afraid. And the fear was infectious.  \"In here!\" panted the little man.  It was another restaurant--more of a bar, really, and a sort of second-rate place that Burckhardt had never patronized.  \"Right straight through,\" Swanson whispered; and Burckhardt, like a biddable boy, side-stepped through the mass of tables to the far end of the restaurant.  It was \"L\"-shaped, with a front on two streets at right angles to each other. They came out on the side street, Swanson staring coldly back at the question-looking cashier, and crossed to the opposite sidewalk.  They were under the marquee of a movie theater. Swanson's expression began to relax.  \"Lost them!\" he crowed softly. \"We're almost there.\"  He stepped up to the window and bought two tickets. Burckhardt trailed him in to the theater. It was a weekday matinee and the place was almost empty. From the screen came sounds of gunfire and horse's hoofs. A solitary usher, leaning against a bright brass rail, looked briefly at them and went back to staring boredly at the picture as Swanson led Burckhardt down a flight of carpeted marble steps.  They were in the lounge and it was empty. There was a door for men and one for ladies; and there was a third door, marked \"MANAGER\" in gold letters. Swanson listened at the door, and gently opened it and peered inside.  \"Okay,\" he said, gesturing.  Burckhardt followed him through an empty office, to another door--a closet, probably, because it was unmarked.  But it was no closet. Swanson opened it warily, looked inside, then motioned Burckhardt to follow.  It was a tunnel, metal-walled, brightly lit. Empty, it stretched vacantly away in both directions from them.  Burckhardt looked wondering around. One thing he knew and knew full well:  No such tunnel belonged under Tylerton.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a room off the tunnel with chairs and a desk and what looked like television screens. Swanson slumped in a chair, panting.  \"We're all right for a while here,\" he wheezed. \"They don't come here much any more. If they do, we'll hear them and we can hide.\"  \"Who?\" demanded Burckhardt.  The little man said, \"Martians!\" His voice cracked on the word and the life seemed to go out of him. In morose tones, he went on: \"Well, I think they're Martians. Although you could be right, you know; I've had plenty of time to think it over these last few weeks, after they got you, and it's possible they're Russians after all. Still--\"  \"Start from the beginning. Who got me when?\"  Swanson sighed. \"So we have to go through the whole thing again. All right. It was about two months ago that you banged on my door, late at night. You were all beat up--scared silly. You begged me to help you--\"  \"_I_ did?\"  \"Naturally you don't remember any of this. Listen and you'll understand. You were talking a blue streak about being captured and threatened, and your wife being dead and coming back to life, and all kinds of mixed-up nonsense. I thought you were crazy. But--well, I've always had a lot of respect for you. And you begged me to hide you and I have this darkroom, you know. It locks from the inside only. I put the lock on myself. So we went in there--just to humor you--and along about midnight, which was only fifteen or twenty minutes after, we passed out.\"  \"Passed out?\"  Swanson nodded. \"Both of us. It was like being hit with a sandbag. Look, didn't that happen to you again last night?\"  \"I guess it did,\" Burckhardt shook his head uncertainly.  \"Sure. And then all of a sudden we were awake again, and you said you were going to show me something funny, and we went out and bought a paper. And the date on it was June 15th.\"  \"June 15th? But that's today! I mean--\"  \"You got it, friend. It's _always_ today!\"  It took time to penetrate.  Burckhardt said wonderingly, \"You've hidden out in that darkroom for how many weeks?\"  \"How can I tell? Four or five, maybe. I lost count. And every day the same--always the 15th of June, always my landlady, Mrs. Keefer, is sweeping the front steps, always the same headline in the papers at the corner. It gets monotonous, friend.\"   IV  It was Burckhardt's idea and Swanson despised it, but he went along. He was the type who always went along.  \"It's dangerous,\" he grumbled worriedly. \"Suppose somebody comes by? They'll spot us and--\"  \"What have we got to lose?\"  Swanson shrugged. \"It's dangerous,\" he said again. But he went along.  Burckhardt's idea was very simple. He was sure of only one thing--the tunnel went somewhere. Martians or Russians, fantastic plot or crazy hallucination, whatever was wrong with Tylerton had an explanation, and the place to look for it was at the end of the tunnel.  They jogged along. It was more than a mile before they began to see an end. They were in luck--at least no one came through the tunnel to spot them. But Swanson had said that it was only at certain hours that the tunnel seemed to be in use.  Always the fifteenth of June. Why? Burckhardt asked himself. Never mind the how. _Why?_  And falling asleep, completely involuntarily--everyone at the same time, it seemed. And not remembering, never remembering anything--Swanson had said how eagerly he saw Burckhardt again, the morning after Burckhardt had incautiously waited five minutes too many before retreating into the darkroom. When Swanson had come to, Burckhardt was gone. Swanson had seen him in the street that afternoon, but Burckhardt had remembered nothing.  And Swanson had lived his mouse's existence for weeks, hiding in the woodwork at night, stealing out by day to search for Burckhardt in pitiful hope, scurrying around the fringe of life, trying to keep from the deadly eyes of _them_.  Them. One of \"them\" was the girl named April Horn. It was by seeing her walk carelessly into a telephone booth and never come out that Swanson had found the tunnel. Another was the man at the cigar stand in Burckhardt's office building. There were more, at least a dozen that Swanson knew of or suspected.  They were easy enough to spot, once you knew where to look--for they, alone in Tylerton, changed their roles from day to day. Burckhardt was on that 8:51 bus,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31979"],["title","The Tunnel Under the World (#4)"],["body","morning of every day-that-was-June-15th, never different by a hair or a moment. But April Horn was sometimes gaudy in the cellophane skirt, giving away candy or cigarettes; sometimes plainly dressed; sometimes not seen by Swanson at all.  Russians? Martians? Whatever they were, what could they be hoping to gain from this mad masquerade?  Burckhardt didn't know the answer--but perhaps it lay beyond the door at the end of the tunnel. They listened carefully and heard distant sounds that could not quite be made out, but nothing that seemed dangerous. They slipped through.  And, through a wide chamber and up a flight of steps, they found they were in what Burckhardt recognized as the Contro Chemicals plant.         *       *       *       *       *  Nobody was in sight. By itself, that was not so very odd--the automatized factory had never had very many persons in it. But Burckhardt remembered, from his single visit, the endless, ceaseless busyness of the plant, the valves that opened and closed, the vats that emptied themselves and filled themselves and stirred and cooked and chemically tasted the bubbling liquids they held inside themselves. The plant was never populated, but it was never still.  Only--now it _was_ still. Except for the distant sounds, there was no breath of life in it. The captive electronic minds were sending out no commands; the coils and relays were at rest.  Burckhardt said, \"Come on.\" Swanson reluctantly followed him through the tangled aisles of stainless steel columns and tanks.  They walked as though they were in the presence of the dead. In a way, they were, for what were the automatons that once had run the factory, if not corpses? The machines were controlled by computers that were really not computers at all, but the electronic analogues of living brains. And if they were turned off, were they not dead? For each had once been a human mind.  Take a master petroleum chemist, infinitely skilled in the separation of crude oil into its fractions. Strap him down, probe into his brain with searching electronic needles. The machine scans the patterns of the mind, translates what it sees into charts and sine waves. Impress these same waves on a robot computer and you have your chemist. Or a thousand copies of your chemist, if you wish, with all of his knowledge and skill, and no human limitations at all.  Put a dozen copies of him into a plant and they will run it all, twenty-four hours a day, seven days of every week, never tiring, never overlooking anything, never forgetting....  Swanson stepped up closer to Burckhardt. \"I'm scared,\" he said.  They were across the room now and the sounds were louder. They were not machine sounds, but voices; Burckhardt moved cautiously up to a door and dared to peer around it.  It was a smaller room, lined with television screens, each one--a dozen or more, at least--with a man or woman sitting before it, staring into the screen and dictating notes into a recorder. The viewers dialed from scene to scene; no two screens ever showed the same picture.  The pictures seemed to have little in common. One was a store, where a girl dressed like April Horn was demonstrating home freezers. One was a series of shots of kitchens. Burckhardt caught a glimpse of what looked like the cigar stand in his office building.  It was baffling and Burckhardt would have loved to stand there and puzzle it out, but it was too busy a place. There was the chance that someone would look their way or walk out and find them.         *       *       *       *       *  They found another room. This one was empty. It was an office, large and sumptuous. It had a desk, littered with papers. Burckhardt stared at them, briefly at first--then, as the words on one of them caught his attention, with incredulous fascination.  He snatched up the topmost sheet, scanned it, and another, while Swanson was frenziedly searching through the drawers.  Burckhardt swore unbelievingly and dropped the papers to the desk.  Swanson, hardly noticing, yelped with delight: \"Look!\" He dragged a gun from the desk. \"And it's loaded, too!\"  Burckhardt stared at him blankly, trying to assimilate what he had read. Then, as he realized what Swanson had said, Burckhardt's eyes sparked. \"Good man!\" he cried. \"We'll take it. We're getting out of here with that gun, Swanson. And we're going to the police! Not the cops in Tylerton, but the F.B.I., maybe. Take a look at this!\"  The sheaf he handed Swanson was headed: \"Test Area Progress Report. Subject: Marlin Cigarettes Campaign.\" It was mostly tabulated figures that made little sense to Burckhardt and Swanson, but at the end was a summary that said:       Although Test 47-K3 pulled nearly double the number of new      users of any of the other tests conducted, it probably      cannot be used in the field because of local sound-truck      control ordinances.       The tests in the 47-K12 group were second best and our      recommendation is that retests be conducted in this appeal,      testing each of the three best campaigns with and without      the addition of sampling techniques.       An alternative suggestion might be to proceed directly with      the top appeal in the K12 series, if the client is unwilling      to go to the expense of additional tests.       All of these forecast expectations have an 80% probability      of being within one-half of one per cent of results      forecast, and more than 99% probability of coming within 5%.  Swanson looked up from the paper into Burckhardt's eyes. \"I don't get it,\" he complained.  Burckhardt said, \"I don't blame you. It's crazy, but it fits the facts, Swanson, _it fits the facts_. They aren't Russians and they aren't Martians. These people are advertising men! Somehow--heaven knows how they did it--they've taken Tylerton over. They've got us, all of us, you and me and twenty or thirty thousand other people, right under their thumbs.  \"Maybe they hypnotize us and maybe it's something else; but however they do it, what happens is that they let us live a day at a time. They pour advertising into us the whole damned day long. And at the end of the day, they see what happened--and then they wash the day out of our minds and start again the next day with different advertising.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Swanson's jaw was hanging. He managed to close it and swallow. \"Nuts!\" he said flatly.  Burckhardt shook his head. \"Sure, it sounds crazy--but this whole thing is crazy. How else would you explain it? You can't deny that most of Tylerton lives the same day over and over again. You've _seen_ it! And that's the crazy part and we have to admit that that's true--unless we are the crazy ones. And once you admit that somebody, somehow, knows how to accomplish that, the rest of it makes all kinds of sense.  \"Think of it, Swanson! They test every last detail before they spend a nickel on advertising! Do you have any idea what that means? Lord knows how much money is involved, but I know for a fact that some companies spend twenty or thirty million dollars a year on advertising. Multiply it, say, by a hundred companies. Say that every one of them learns how to cut its advertising cost by only ten per cent. And that's peanuts, believe me!  \"If they know in advance what's going to work, they can cut their costs in half--maybe to less than half, I don't know. But that's saving two or three hundred million dollars a year--and if they pay only ten or twenty per cent of that for the use of Tylerton, it's still dirt cheap for them and a fortune for whoever took over Tylerton.\"  Swanson licked his lips. \"You mean,\" he offered hesitantly, \"that we're a--well, a kind of captive audience?\"  Burckhardt frowned. \"Not exactly.\" He thought for a minute. \"You know how a doctor tests something like penicillin? He sets up a series of little colonies of germs on gelatine disks and he tries the stuff on one after another, changing it a little each time. Well, that's us--we're the germs, Swanson. Only it's even more efficient than that. They don't have to test more than one colony, because they can use it over and over again.\"  It was too hard for Swanson to take in. He only said: \"What do we do about it?\"  \"We go to the police. They can't use human beings for guinea pigs!\"  \"How do we get to the police?\"  Burckhardt hesitated. \"I think--\" he began slowly. \"Sure. This place is the office of somebody important. We've got a gun. We'll stay right here until he comes along. And he'll get us out of here.\"  Simple and direct. Swanson subsided and found a place to sit, against the wall, out of sight of the door. Burckhardt took up a position behind the door itself--  And waited.         *       *       *       *       *  The wait was not as long as it might have been. Half an hour, perhaps. Then Burckhardt heard approaching voices and had time for a swift whisper to Swanson before he flattened himself against the wall.  It was a man's voice, and a girl's. The man was saying, \"--reason why you couldn't report on the phone? You're ruining your whole day's test! What the devil's the matter with you, Janet?\"  \"I'm sorry, Mr. Dorchin,\" she said in a sweet, clear tone. \"I thought it was important.\"  The man grumbled, \"Important! One lousy unit out of twenty-one thousand.\"  \"But it's the Burckhardt one, Mr. Dorchin. Again. And the way he got out of sight, he must have had some help.\"  \"All right, all right. It doesn't matter, Janet; the Choco-Bite program is ahead of schedule anyhow. As long as you're this far, come on in the office and make out your worksheet. And don't worry about the Burckhardt business. He's probably just wandering around. We'll pick him up tonight and--\"  They were inside the door. Burckhardt kicked it shut and pointed the gun.  \"That's what you think,\" he said triumphantly.  It was worth the terrified hours, the bewildered sense of insanity, the confusion and fear. It was the most satisfying sensation Burckhardt had ever had"]]]
