The gunfire and the sound of their voices so near shore had stirred up the rebels. A canoe with three men in it had pushed out, and, struggling with the current, had made its way toward them, guided by their own voices. The top of a floating tree had hidden it from their sight until it suddenly came around the mass of leafage, and a man standing up in the bow leveling a revolver at them ordered instant surrender. The other two men were sitting in the middle and stern with paddles, and having all they could do to maintain the course of the canoe.  Si and Shorty were so startled that for an instant they made no response to the demand. The Lieutenant was the first to speak:  \"Are you a commissioned officer?\" he inquired.  \"No,\" was the answer.  \"Then I refuse to surrender. I'll surrender to no one inferior to me in rank.\"  \"Sorry we'uns can't obleege yo', nohow,\" said the man with the revolver, in a sneer; \"but we'uns'll have t' be good enough commissioned ossifers for yo' jist now, an' yo'll have t' done hold up yo'uns hands. We'uns hain't no time t' send ashore for a Lootenant.\"  The other two chuckled as they struggled with the current, and forced the canoe up close to the log. Shorty made a motion as if throwing up his hands, and called out in a submissive way:  \"Here, le'me git hold o' the bow, and I kin help you. It's awful hard paddlin' in this current.\"  Without thinking the men threw the bow in so close that Shorty could clutch it with his long hand. The grab shook the ticklish craft, so that the man with the revolver could scarcely keep his feet.  \"Heah,\" he yelled at the other two. \"Keep the dugout stiddy. What air yo'uns doin'? Hold her off, I tell yo'uns.\"  Then to the Lieutenant:  \"Heah, yo'uns surrender to wonst, or I'll blow yo' heads offen yo'uns.\"  The Lieutenant started a further remonstrance, but Shorty had in the meantime got the other hand on the canoe, and he gave it such a wrench that the man with the pistol lost his footing and fell across the log, where he was grabbed by Shorty and his pistol-hand secured. The stern of the canoe had swung around until Si had been able to catch it with one hand, while with the other he grabbed the man in the stern, who, seeing the sudden assumption of hostilities, had raised his paddle to strike.  Si and Shorty had somewhat the advantage in position. By holding on to the log with their legs they had a comparatively firm, base, while the canoe was a very ticklish foundation for a fight.  The middle man also raised his paddle to strike, but the Lieutenant caught it and tried to wrest it away. This held the canoe and the log close together while Si and Shorty were struggling. Si saw this, and letting go, devoted both hands to this man, whom he pulled over into the water about the same time that Shorty possessed himself of the other man's pistol and dragged him out of the canoe.  \"Hold fast in the center there, Lieutenant,\" he called out, as he dropped the pistol into his bosom and took in the situation with a quick glance. \"You two Johnnies hold on to the log like grim death to a dead nigger, and you won't drown.\"  He carefully worked himself from the log into the canoe, and then Si did the same. They had come to a part where the water spread out in a broad and tolerably calm lake over the valley, but there was a gorge at the further end through which it was rushing with a roar. Log and canoe were drifting in that direction, and while the changes were being made the canoe drifted away from the log.  \"Hold on, men,\" shouted the Lieutenant; \"you are certainly not going to abandon your officer?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said Shorty. \"How could you imagine such a thing? But just how to trade you off for this rebel passenger presents difficulties. If we try to throw him overboard we shall certainly tip the canoe over. And I'm afraid he's not the man to give up peaceably a dry seat in the canoe for your berth on the log.\"  \"I order you to come back here at once and take me in that boat,\" said the Lieutenant imperatively.  \"We are comin' back all right,\" said Shorty; \"but we're not goin' to let you tip this canoe over for 40 Second Lieutenants. We'll git you out o' the scrape somehow. Don't fret.\"  \"Hello, thar! Help! Help!\" came across the waters in agonized tones, which at the same time had some thing familiar in them.  \"Hello, yourself!\" responded Shorty, making out, a little distance away, a \"jo-boat,\" that is, a rude, clumsy square-bottomed, square-ended sort of a skiff in which was one man. \"What's wanted?\"  \"I'm out here adrift without no oars,\" came in the now-distinctly recognizable voice of Jeff Hackberry. \"Won't yo' please tow me ashore?\"  \"Le's go out there and git him,\" said Shorty to Si. \"We kin put all these fellers in that jo-boat and save 'em.\"  A few strokes of their paddles brought them alongside.  \"How in the world did you come here, Hackberry,\" asked Shorty.  \"O, that ole woman that I wanted so bad that I couldn't rest till I got her wuz red-hot t' git rid o' me,\" whined Hackberry. \"She tried half-a-dozen ways puttin' wild parsnip in my likker, giving me pokeberry bitters, and so on, but nothin' fetched me. Finally she deviled me to carry her acrost the crick to the Confederit lines. I found this ole jo-boat at last, an' we got in. Suddenly, quick as lightning she picked up the oars, an' give the boat a kick which sent hit away out into the current. I floated away, yellin' at her, an' she standin' on the bank grinnin' at me and cussin'. I've been havin' the awfulest day floatin' down the freshet, expectin' every minute t' be drowned, an' both sides pluggin' away at me whenever they ketched sight o' me. I wuz willin' t' surrender t' either one that'd save me from being drownded, but none of 'em seemed t' care a durn about my drowndin'; they only wanted t' plug me.\"  \"Please save me, Mister,\" begged Jeff, \"an' I'll do anything under the shinin' sun for yo'; I'll jine the Yankee army; I'll lead you' to whar thar's nests o' the pizenest bushwhackers. I'll do anything yo' kin ax me. Only save me from being drownded. Right down thar's the big falls, an' if I go over them, nothin' kin same me from drowndin'.\" And he began a doleful blubbering.  \"On general principles, I think that'd be the best thing that could happen,\" remarked Shorty. \"But I haven't time to discuss that now. Will you do just what we want, if we save your life?\"  \"Yes; yes,\" responded he eagerly.  \"Well, if you don't, at the very minute I tell you, I'll plug you for certain with this,\" said Shorty, showing the revolver. \"Mind, I'll not speak twice. I'll give you no warnin'. You do what I tell you on the jump, or I'll be worse to you than Mrs. Bolster. First place, take this man in with you. And you (to the rebel in the canoe) mind how you git into that boat. Don't you dare, on your life, kick the canoe over as you crawl out. If I find it rocks the least bit as you leave I'll bust your cocoanut as the last act of my military career. Now crawl out.\"  The rebel crawled over the gunwale into the boat as cautiously as if there were torpedoes under him.  \"Now,\" said Shorty, with a sigh of relief, as the man was at last out of the canoe, \"we'll paddle around here and pick up some pieces of boards for you to use as oars. Then you bring the boat over to that log.\"  This was done, and the Lieutenant and the two rebels clinging to the log were transferred to the jo-boat. The moment the Lieutenant felt himself in the comparative security of the jo-boat his desire for command asserted itself.  \"Now, men,\" said he, authoritatively, \"pull away for the other side, pointing up stream. That glow over there is our campfires. Make for it.\"  \"All right, Lootenant,\" said Shorty. \"You command that boat. You've got your revolver with you, and kin make 'em mind. We'll pick up some more boards, so as to have oars for all o' 'em. They'd better use 'em lively, for it ain't a great ways t' the suck. If you git into that you'll go to Davy Jones's as sure as the Lord made little apples. Paddle, now, if you value your lives. Me and Si are goin' back to look for that galoot that shot at us. We want to make a present of him to our Colonel, who's after information from the other side. We want his gun and another one to make up for the two that we had to leave on the island. We'll join you before you git acrost.\"  The Lieutenant lifted up his voice in remonstrance against the desperate undertaking, but Si and Shorty paddled swiftly away, leaving him and his squad to struggle over the muddy lake in their clumsy bateau.  Though the boys were sadly worn by the day's exciting adventures, yet they were animated by the hope of doing something that would signally retrieve their earlier misfortunes. Both were adepts at canoe navigation, the canoe was light and easily managed with but two in it, and they had gotten the lay of the shore so well in mind that they felt sure that they could slip around and come in on the man who had fired upon them. The drizzle of the rain helped curtain them; they pushed the canoe through the top of a paw-paw thicket that rose but a little way above the flood, Shorty sprang out, and in a few steps came up behind the two pickets, who were crouching over a little fire they had built behind the cover of some dense weeds.  \"Was this the post that fired on men in a canoe a little while ago?\" he asked, as if a rebel officer out on a tour of investigation.  \"Yes,\" the men stammered, as soon as they could recover from the startle of his sudden appearance.  \"Which man fired?\" asked Shorty.  \"Me,\" answered one.  \"Well, I want you and both your guns,\" said Shorty, thrusting his revolver against the man's face. \"Pick up them guns and go right ahead there.\"  The man meekly did as bid, and in a few minutes was landed into the canoe, into which Shorty jumped and pushed off. When nearly across they came upon the jo-boat, with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31774"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 4 (#8)"],["body","standing erect with drawn revolver, while the men were laboring hard to propel it to shore. The boys fastened its painter to the stern of the canoe and helped by towing.  They headed for a large fire burning brightly on the bank, indicating that it was the headquarters of the pickets. In response to the sharp challenge, the Lieutenant responded:  \"Friends, without the countersign.\"  Quite a number of officers and men thronged to the water's edge to see what could be coming from that unexpected quarter. The Lieutenant ordered the boys to fall to the rear with their canoe, that he might be the first to land, and as his bateau labored close to the shore he recognized the Colonel in command of the picket line, and said in a loud voice:  \"Sir, I have the honor to report that I have been across the creek reconnoitering the enemy's lines. I have with me five prisoners four soldiers and one guerrilla.\"    CHAPTER VI. DISTRESSING ENEMIES  OTHER THAN THE REBELS AND RAIN, MUD, AND SWOLLEN STREAMS.  SI WOKE up early the next morning with a savage exclamation.  \"I declare, I'm all on fire,\" he said. \"Some thing's just eating me up. I believe I've got a million graybacks on me.\"  [Illustration: I'M ALL ON FIRE 77]  \"Same here, Si,\" said Shorty. \"Never knowed 'em to be so bad. Seem to 've just got in from a march, and are chawin' three days' rations out o' me every minute. I'd 'a' thought they'd all 've bin drowned from the duckin' they've bin havin' for the past five days, but it only seems to 've sharpened their teeth and whetted their appetites. They've all come to dinner, and invited their friends.\"  \"Where in the world could they have all come from?\" meditated Si. \"We wuz certainly clean of 'em when we started out six days ago.\"  \"O, the rebels skipped out in sich a hurry,\" ex plained Shorty, \"that they even dropped their house hold pets, which we inherited as we follered 'em up. I wish this infernal rain'd let up long enough for us to do some skirmishin' and bile our clothes. Or if the sun'd only come out an hour or two, we could find an ant-hill, an' lay our clothes on it. I don't know any little thing that I enjoy more on a pleasant day when we've bin a long march and got mighty 'crumby, than to pull off my shirt and lay it on a lively ant-hill, and light my pipe and set there and watch the busy ants collar its inhabitants and carry 'em off to fill up their smoke-houses with Winter meat.\"  He put his hand meditatively into his bosom as he spoke. As he withdrew it he looked down and exclaimed:  \"Jehosephat, it's fleas, too. Just look there. I'm alive with fleas.\"  \"Same here,\" ejaculated Si, who had made a similar discovery. \"Just look at 'em, hoppin' out every where. The rebels have not only set their grayback infantry on to us, but are jumping us with their flea cavalry.\"  \"If you call the graybacks infantry and the fleas cavalry, what in the world do you call these, Si?\" said Shorty, who had made still another discovery, and was pointing to his wrists and ankles, where rows of gorged ticks, looking like drops of fresh blood, encircled his limbs.  \"Them's heavy artillery,\" answered Si; \"and, Great Scott, I've got more of 'em on me than you have. And there's some just back of your ears, Shorty. Be careful, Shorty. Don't touch 'em. Le' me work 'em off. Be awful careful. If you break their heads off they'll stay in and make a sore that'll almost never get well.\"  They looked down the lines of men who, like themselves, had been rudely awakened from their slumber on wet beds by \"the pestilence that walketh by night.\" There were howls, yells, oaths and imprecations from everybody. Officers forgot their carefully-maintained dignity, and were as vociferous and profane as the men.  Many were stripped, and trying to singe their wet clothes over the smoldering fires. Many were even trying to subdue the pests by thrashing their garments in the cold water of the creek.  \"'Bout as much use as a General Order from Army Headquarters would be agin the varmints,\" said Shorty, as he watched their futile labors. \"Say, you fellers,\" he called out to them; \"why don't you repeat the Ten Commandments to 'em? Or sing the doxology? It'll do just as much good as sloshing your duds around in the water. The water only makes 'em savager'n ever. You ought to know that from experience.\"  By the happy thought of gently touching the gorged wood-ticks with the point of a pin Si and Shorty had gotten rid of those plagues, heads and all, so as to leave no apprehension as to future sores. They communicated this method to their afflicted comrades, and then turned their attention to the other parasites.  \"I guess I'll just go down to the Surgeon's tent and git a pound of angwintum,\" said Shorty, \"and rub myself from head to foot with it. That's the only thing I know of that'll do the least good.\"  \"Mustn't do that,\" objected Si. \"Put angwintum on you and get wet, and you'll be salivated. You ought to know that.\"  \"I don't care,\" said Shorty desperately. \"I'd rather be salivated till my teeth drop out and my hair falls off than be carried off in large chunks by fleas and graybacks. Come along.\"  \"Mebbe the Surgeon has something else that'll pizen these little cusses,\" said Si, falling in with his comrade.  They found a clamorous group around the Surgeon's tent, asking for \"angwintum (mercurial ointment) or anything else that would alleviate their torments. The worried Surgeon was scratching himself as he explained to the Colonel:  \"It seems to me, 'Colonel, that the rising water has concentrated all these parasites on the higher ground over which we have come. This is the only way in which I can account for their severe visitation upon us. The parasites seem to have the same instinct to gather on elevated spots when the water is rising that other animals have, and we have consequently gathered up four or five times as many, to say the least, as we should otherwise have gotten. But you don't know the worst of it yet. You see those men? They have sore feet. But it isn't ordinary sore feet. They've got chiggers in their feet.\"  \"Chiggers. What are they?\" asked the Colonel.  \"Chiggers, jiggers, chigoes pulex penetrans,\" answered the Surgeon. \"They are a great pest in the tropics, where the people go barefooted and do not take any care of their feet. This is the first time that I have ever heard of them being so far north. But there is no doubt about their being chiggers. They burrow in under the skin, and cause a great deal of suffering. Some of the men's hands and fingers are also affected by them. They are terrible things to deal with when they once get the start. If this thing goes on, not a man in the regiment will be able to walk a step.\"  \"What can be done?\" gasped the Colonel, gripping for a flea in his bosom.  \"Nothing,\" answered the Surgeon, smashing an insect on the back of his hand, \"except to issue a stringent order that the men must take special care of their feet and hands.\"  \"Humph,\" said the Colonel, scornfully, as he caught a bug on his wrist; \"much sense in an order of that kind, when the men have to wade through mud and water 18 hours out of 24, and then sleep in it the other six. Is that the best you can suggest? Is that all your conscience has to offer? Remember that you are responsible for the efficiency of the men on this great campaign, upon which the safety of the country depends. It will be a severe reflection upon you if you allow them to be broken down by a few insects.\"  \"Great Pharaoh and Moses,\" responded the Surgeon irritably, as he grabbed for \"a bite\" on his throat. \"Here we are, confronted with a condition of things like the curses which God Almighty sent against the Egyptians, and you expect me to manage it with quinine and epsom salts. It can't be done, Colonel.\"  \"Isn't there anything that you can suggest or recommend that will mitigate this trouble?\" said the Colonel in a more conciliatory manner, for he had just succeeded in crushing a tormentor. \"Certainly, there must be something in your pharmacopeia which will at least retard these infernal vermin from eating my men alive. Can't you at least check them a little until we can get through the campaign? Then the men can be trusted to take care of themselves.\" And the Colonel made a swoop for a particularly vicious flea which was banqueting on the lobe of his ear.  \"I never set up as a sharp on parasites,\" said the Surgeon, running down a \"small deer\" inside his collar; \"but I remember to have read that an application of tobacco-juice is about as effective a preventive of insect bites as can be found.\"  \"That'll do; that'll do,\" said Shorty triumphantly, as he and Si started back to their places to act at once on the Surgeon's suggestion. \"Just the thing. Tobacker'll kill 'em deader than small-beer. Why didn't I think about it before?\"  Shorty had some strong black plug tobacco. He cut this up into small pieces, while Si found an old tin can, into which they were put, and then the can filled up with boiling water.  \"Let's make her good and strong, Si,\" said Shorty, putting in some more tobacco; \"for the fellers are sock-dolagers, and it will take a horse dose to kill 'em. They'll just enjoy a little taste o' terbacker. Make it strong enough to bear up an aig. Now, let's git our clothes off while it's coolin' down. You drench me, and I'll drench you, and we'll salivate these gallinippers in a way that'll surprise 'em.\"  The surprise seemed to be mostly on the other side. Shorty's skin was raw from head to foot from the depredations of the various tribes of \"epizoa,\" as the physicians generalize them. He gave a yell that could be heard through the whole regiment as the acrid, biting tobacco-juice struck a thousand little punctures in his skin inside of a second. Everybody rushed up to see what was the matter, and stood around, laughing and commenting, while scratching and slapping at their own colonies of tormentors. Then Shorty began the most vehement stream of"]]]
