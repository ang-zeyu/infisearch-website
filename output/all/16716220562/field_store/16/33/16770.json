As I had half expected, both made their appearance the next day.  I struck so fine a shade betwixt the pride that is allowed to soldiers and the sorrowful humility that befits a captive, that I declare, as I went to meet them, I might have afforded a subject for a painter.  So much was high comedy, I must confess; but so soon as my eyes lighted full on her dark face and eloquent eyes, the blood leaped into my cheeks—and that was nature!  I thanked them, but not the least with exultation; it was my cue to be mournful, and to take the pair of them as one.  ‘I have been thinking,’ I said, ‘you have been so good to me, both of you, stranger and prisoner as I am, that I have been thinking how I could testify to my gratitude.  It may seem a strange subject for a confidence, but there is actually no one here, even of my comrades, that knows me by my name and title.  By these I am called plain Champdivers, a name to which I have a right, but not the name which I should bear, and which (but a little while ago) I must hide like a crime.  Miss Flora, suffer me to present to you the Vicomte Anne de Kéroual de Saint-Yves, a private soldier.’  ‘I knew it!’ cried the boy; ‘I knew he was a noble!’  And I thought the eyes of Miss Flora said the same, but more persuasively.  All through this interview she kept them on the ground, or only gave them to me for a moment at a time, and with a serious sweetness.  ‘You may conceive, my friends, that this is rather a painful confession,’ I continued.  ‘To stand here before you, vanquished, a prisoner in a fortress, and take my own name upon my lips, is painful to the proud. And yet I wished that you should know me.  Long after this, we may yet hear of one another—perhaps Mr. Gilchrist and myself in the field and from opposing camps—and it would be a pity if we heard and did not recognise.’  They were both moved; and began at once to press upon me offers of service, such as to lend me books, get me tobacco if I used it, and the like.  This would have been all mighty welcome, before the tunnel was ready.  Now it signified no more to me than to offer the transition I required.  ‘My dear friends,’ I said—‘for you must allow me to call you that, who have no others within so many hundred leagues—perhaps you will think me fanciful and sentimental; and perhaps indeed I am; but there is one service that I would beg of you before all others.  You see me set here on the top of this rock in the midst of your city.  Even with what liberty I have, I have the opportunity to see a myriad roofs, and I dare to say, thirty leagues of sea and land.  All this hostile!  Under all these roofs my enemies dwell; wherever I see the smoke of a house rising, I must tell myself that some one sits before the chimney and reads with joy of our reverses.  Pardon me, dear friends, I know that you must do the same, and I do not grudge at it!  With you, it is all different. Show me your house then, were it only the chimney, or, if that be not visible, the quarter of the town in which it lies!  So, when I look all about me, I shall be able to say: “_There is one house in which I am not quite unkindly thought of_.”’  Flora stood a moment.  ‘It is a pretty thought,’ said she, ‘and, as far as regards Ronald and myself, a true one.  Come, I believe I can show you the very smoke out of our chimney.’  So saying, she carried me round the battlements towards the opposite or southern side of the fortress, and indeed to a bastion almost immediately overlooking the place of our projected flight.  Thence we had a view of some foreshortened suburbs at our feet, and beyond of a green, open, and irregular country rising towards the Pentland Hills.  The face of one of these summits (say two leagues from where we stood) is marked with a procession of white scars.  And to this she directed my attention.  ‘You see these marks?’ she said.  ‘We call them the Seven Sisters. Follow a little lower with your eye, and you will see a fold of the hill, the tops of some trees, and a tail of smoke out of the midst of them. That is Swanston Cottage, where my brother and I are living with my aunt. If it gives you pleasure to see it, I am glad.  We, too, can see the castle from a corner in the garden, and we go there in the morning often—do we not, Ronald?—and we think of you, M. de Saint-Yves; but I am afraid it does not altogether make us glad.’  ‘Mademoiselle!’ said I, and indeed my voice was scarce under command, ‘if you knew how your generous words—how even the sight of you—relieved the horrors of this place, I believe, I hope, I know, you would be glad.  I will come here daily and look at that dear chimney and these green hills, and bless you from the heart, and dedicate to you the prayers of this poor sinner.  Ah!  I do not say they can avail!’  ‘Who can say that, M. de Saint-Yves?’ she said softly.  ‘But I think it is time we should be going.’  ‘High time,’ said Ronald, whom (to say the truth) I had a little forgotten.  On the way back, as I was laying myself out to recover lost ground with the youth, and to obliterate, if possible, the memory of my last and somewhat too fervent speech, who should come past us but the major?  I had to stand aside and salute as he went by, but his eyes appeared entirely occupied with Flora.  ‘Who is that man?’ she asked.  ‘He is a friend of mine,’ said I.  ‘I give him lessons in French, and he has been very kind to me.’  ‘He stared,’ she said,—‘I do not say, rudely; but why should he stare?’  ‘If you do not wish to be stared at, mademoiselle, suffer me to recommend a veil,’ said I.  She looked at me with what seemed anger.  ‘I tell you the man stared,’ she said.  And Ronald added.  ‘Oh, I don’t think he meant any harm.  I suppose he was just surprised to see us walking about with a pr--- with M. Saint-Yves.’  But the next morning, when I went to Chevenix’s rooms, and after I had dutifully corrected his exercise—‘I compliment you on your taste,’ said he to me.  ‘I beg your pardon?’ said I.  ‘Oh no, I beg yours,’ said he.  ‘You understand me perfectly, just as I do you.’  I murmured something about enigmas.  ‘Well, shall I give you the key to the enigma?’ said he, leaning back. ‘That was the young lady whom Goguelat insulted and whom you avenged.  I do not blame you.  She is a heavenly creature.’  ‘With all my heart, to the last of it!’ said I.  ‘And to the first also, if it amuses you!  You are become so very acute of late that I suppose you must have your own way.’  ‘What is her name?’ he asked.  ‘Now, really!’ said I.  ‘Do you think it likely she has told me?’  ‘I think it certain,’ said he.  I could not restrain my laughter.  ‘Well, then, do you think it likely I would tell you?’ I cried.  ‘Not a bit.’ said he.  ‘But come, to our lesson!’     CHAPTER VI—THE ESCAPE   The time for our escape drew near, and the nearer it came the less we seemed to enjoy the prospect.  There is but one side on which this castle can be left either with dignity or safety; but as there is the main gate and guard, and the chief street of the upper city, it is not to be thought of by escaping prisoners.  In all other directions an abominable precipice surrounds it, down the face of which (if anywhere at all) we must regain our liberty.  By our concurrent labours in many a dark night, working with the most anxious precautions against noise, we had made out to pierce below the curtain about the south-west corner, in a place they call the _Devil’s Elbow_.  I have never met that celebrity; nor (if the rest of him at all comes up to what they called his elbow) have I the least desire of his acquaintance.  From the heel of the masonry, the rascally, breakneck precipice descended sheer among waste lands, scattered suburbs of the city, and houses in the building.  I had never the heart to look for any length of time—the thought that I must make the descent in person some dark night robbing me of breath; and, indeed, on anybody not a seaman or a steeple-jack, the mere sight of the _Devil’s Elbow_ wrought like an emetic.  I don’t know where the rope was got, and doubt if I much cared.  It was not that which gravelled me, but whether, now that we had it, it would serve our turn.  Its length, indeed, we made a shift to fathom out; but who was to tell us how that length compared with the way we had to go? Day after day, there would be always some of us stolen out to the _Devil’s Elbow_ and making estimates of the descent, whether by a bare guess or the dropping of stones.  A private of pioneers remembered the formula for that—or else remembered part of it and obligingly invented the remainder.  I had never any real confidence in that formula; and even had we got it from a book, there were difficulties in the way of the application that might have daunted Archimedes.  We durst not drop any considerable pebble lest the sentinels should hear, and those that we dropped we could not hear ourselves.  We had never a watch—or none that had a second-hand; and though every one of us could guess a second to a nicety, all somehow guessed it differently.  In short, if any two set forth upon this enterprise, they invariably returned with two opinions, and often with a black eye in the bargain.  I looked on upon these proceedings, although not without laughter, yet with impatience and disgust.  I am one that cannot bear to see things botched or gone upon with ignorance; and the thought that some poor devil was to hazard his bones upon such premises, revolted me.  Had I guessed the name of that unhappy first adventurer, my sentiments might have been livelier still.  The designation of this personage was indeed all that remained for us to do; and even in that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32209"],["title","Assignment's End (#0)"],["body","ASSIGNMENT'S END                            By ROGER DEE                        Illustrated by DOCKTOR  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction December 1954.

Only one person was exempt--himself!_]  He was just emerging for the hundredth time during the week from the frightening hallucination that had come to plague him, when Kitty Murchinsom came into his office.  \"It's almost 15:00, Philip,\" she said.  When she had entered, her face had taken on the placid look that everyone wore--unwittingly, but inevitably--the instant they came near Alcorn.  Finding Kitty's cool blonde loveliness projected so abruptly against the bleak polar plain of his waking dream, he knew how much more she was than either fiancee or secretary alone. She was a beacon of reassurance in a sea of uncertainty.  \"Thanks, darling,\" he said, and looked at his watch. \"I'd have woolgathered past my appointment and it's an important one.\"  He stood up. Kitty came closer and put both hands on his shoulders.  \"You've had another of those dreams, haven't you? I wish you'd see a--a doctor about them.\"  He laughed, and if the sound rang hollow, she seemed not to notice.  \"That's why I asked you to call me. I've made an appointment with one.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She stood on tiptoe to kiss him. \"I'm glad you're decided. You haven't been yourself at all for a week, Philip, and I couldn't _bear_ a honeymoon with a preoccupied husband!\"  He managed the appropriate leer, though he had never felt less like it. The apprehension that followed his daytime chimera was on him again, so strongly that what he wanted most to do was to take Kitty's hand tightly, like a frightened child, and run headlong until he was beyond reach of whatever it was that threatened him.  \"Small chance,\" he said, instead. \"Any man who'd dream away a honeymoon with you is dead already.\"  She sighed placidly and turned back to the business at hand. \"You won't be late for your 16:00 conference with our Mr. O'Donnell and Director Mulhall of Irradiated Foods, will you? Poor Sean would be lost without you.\"  He felt the usual nagging dissatisfaction with the peculiar talent that had put him where he was in Consolidated Advertising. \"He'd probably lose this case without my soothing presence and CA would pay its first ungrounded refund claim in--\" he counted back over the time he had been with Consolidated--\"four years and eight months.\"  Kitty said wistfully, \"Shall I see you tonight, Philip?\"  He frowned, searching for a way to ease the hurt she would feel later, and finding none. \"That depends on the psychiatrist. If he can't help me, I may fly up to my cabin in the Catskills and wrestle this thing out for myself.\"  Kitty moved to go, and then turned back. \"I almost forgot. There was a call for you at noon from a secretary of Victor Jaffers' at Carter International. She seemed to know you'd be out and said that Mr. Jaffers would call again at 15:00.\"  \"Victor Jaffers?\" Alcorn repeated. The name added a further premonitory depression. \"I think I know what he wants. It's happened before.\"  When Kitty had gone, Alcorn took a restless turn about the room and was interrupted at once by the gentle buzzing of the radophone unit on his desk. He pressed the receiving stud and found himself facing Victor Jaffers' image.  \"Don't bother to record this,\" Jaffers said without preamble. \"Complete arrangements have already been made to prove that I've never spoken to you in my life.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jaffers was a small, still-faced man who might have been mistaken for a senior accountant's clerk--until the chill force of his eyes made itself felt. Alcorn had seen the Carter International head before only in teleprint pictures, had heard and discounted the stories about the man's studied ruthlessness. But those eyes and the blunt approach made him wonder.  \"I've got a place in the contact branch of my organization for your particular talent, Alcorn,\" Jaffers said flatly. \"It will pay you five times what you earn with Consolidated. You understand why I'm taking you on.\"  \"I know.\" The arrogance wearied rather than angered Alcorn. \"I have a gift for arranging fair settlements when both principals are present. Mr. Jaffers, I've never exploited my gift for personal profit. That's a matter of self-protection as well as ethics--I don't like trouble.\" He reached for the canceling stud to end the interview. \"Others have made the same offer before you and there'll be others again. But I won't use my ability unfairly.\"  Jaffers smiled, unamused. \"You do go straight to the point, which saves argument. But you'll work for me, Alcorn. Those others made the mistake of talking to you personally. I know that you can be reached as easily as any other man if my agents keep more than fifty feet away from you.\" His eyes moved past Alcorn to the window. \"Look at the window across the street.\"  Alcorn, turning, felt his neck prickle. Across the narrow canyon of street, without pretense at concealing himself, a man in gray clothing watched him from an open office window.  \"I've had you under surveillance for days,\" Jeffers' voice said behind him. \"I've located two others of your sort since my statisticians brought their existence to my attention, but somehow they slipped through my fingers this week. I'm taking no chances on you.\"  Alcorn whirled back incredulously. \"You've found others? Where and--\"  \"I'll tell you that when you're on my payroll.\"  \"It's a trick,\" Alcorn said angrily. \"I searched for years before I settled down with Consolidated and I didn't find a trace of anybody like myself. I don't believe there are any.\"  \"Most of them covered themselves better.\" Jaffers added, with cold finality, \"I don't haggle, Alcorn. You'll work for me or for no one.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The trouble is,\" Alcorn said, \"that I'm different from other people and I have to know why. I know _how_ I'm different, but if I knew _why_, I'd never have come to a psychiatrist.\"  Dr. Hagen rattled the data sheet in his hands and blinked behind his pince-nez like a friendly beagle. He was a very puzzled man, being accustomed to analyzing his own reactions as well as those of his patients. Alcorn could see him struggling to account for the sudden serenity that had come over him the instant Alcorn entered the office--certainly it was not the doctor's usual frame of mind, from the first sour look of him--and failing.  \"Different in what way, Mr. Alcorn?\"  \"I soothe people,\" Alcorn said. \"There's something about me that inspires trust and an eagerness to please. Everyone roughly within a radius of fifty feet--I've checked the limit a thousand times--immediately feels a sort of euphoria. They're as happy as so many children at a picnic and they can't do enough for me or for each other.\"  Dr. Hagen blinked, but not with disbelief.  \"It affects psychiatrists, too,\" Alcorn went on. \"You'd cheerfully waive the fee for this consultation if I asked it, or lend me fifty credits if I were strapped. The point is that people are never difficult when I'm around, because I was born with the unlikely gift of making them happy. That gift is the most valuable asset I own, but I've never understood it--and as long as I don't understand it, there's the chance that it may be a mixed blessing. I think it's backfired on me already in one fashion and possibly in another.\"  He shook out a cigarette and the psychiatrist obligingly held a lighter to it. Dr. Hagen, Alcorn thought, must normally have been an exceptionally strong-willed man, for he hesitated noticeably before he spun the wheel.  [Illustration]  \"Actually,\" Alcorn said, \"I've begun to worry about my sanity and I'm afraid my gift is responsible. For the past week, I've had a recurrent hallucination, a sort of waking nightmare that comes just when I least expect it and leaves me completely unstrung. It's worse than recurrent--it's progressive, and each new seizure leaves me a little closer to something that I'm desperately afraid to face.\"  The psychiatrist made a judicious tent of his fingers. \"Obviously you are an intelligent and conscientious man, Mr. Alcorn, else you would not have contented yourself with your comparatively minor job. But your profession as claims adjustor must impose a considerable strain upon your nervous organization. Add to this that you are a bachelor at the age of thirty-three and the natural conclusion--\"  In spite of his mood, Alcorn laughed. \"Wrong tack--remember my gift! Besides, I'm engaged to be married next month and I'm quite happy with the prospect. This trouble of mine is something entirely different. It's tied in somehow with my talent for soothing and it scares me.\"  He could have added that Jaffers' hardly veiled threat on his life disturbed him as well, but saw no point in wasting time on the one danger he understood perfectly.  \"This vision,\" Alcorn said, \"and the sensory sharpness and conviction of disaster that come with it--it's no ordinary hallucination. It's as real as my peculiar talent and represents a very real danger. It's working some sort of change in me that I don't like and I've got to find out what that change is or I'm done for. I _feel_ that.\"  Obligingly, the psychiatrist said, \"Describe your experience.\"  Talking about it made perspiration stand out on Alcorn's forehead. \"First I'm seized with a sudden sense of abnormally sharpened perception, as if I were on the point of becoming aware of a great many things beyond my immediate awareness. I can feel the emotions of people about me and I have the conviction that, in another moment, I shall be able to feel their thoughts as well.  \"Then I seem to be standing alone on a frozen arctic plain, a polar "]]]
