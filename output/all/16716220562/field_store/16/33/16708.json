Hendricks saw the gun butt coming. He tried to ward off the blow, but she was too fast. The metal butt struck against the side of his head, just above his ear. Numbing pain rushed through him. Pain and rolling clouds of blackness. He sank down, sliding to the ground.         *       *       *       *       *  Dimly, he was aware that Tasso was standing over him, kicking him with her toe.  \"Major! Wake up.\"  He opened his eyes, groaning.  \"Listen to me.\" She bent down, the gun pointed at his face. \"I have to hurry. There isn't much time left. The ship is ready to go, but you must tell me the information I need before I leave.\"  Hendricks shook his head, trying to clear it.  \"Hurry up! Where is the Moon Base? How do I find it? What do I look for?\"  Hendricks said nothing.  \"Answer me!\"  \"Sorry.\"  \"Major, the ship is loaded with provisions. I can coast for weeks. I'll find the Base eventually. And in a half hour you'll be dead. Your only chance of survival--\" She broke off.  Along the slope, by some crumbling ruins, something moved. Something in the ash. Tasso turned quickly, aiming. She fired. A puff of flame leaped. Something scuttled away, rolling across the ash. She fired again. The claw burst apart, wheels flying.  \"See?\" Tasso said. \"A scout. It won't be long.\"  \"You'll bring them back here to get me?\"  \"Yes. As soon as possible.\"  Hendricks looked up at her. He studied her intently. \"You're telling the truth?\" A strange expression had come over his face, an avid hunger. \"You will come back for me? You'll get me to the Moon Base?\"  \"I'll get you to the Moon Base. But tell me where it is! There's only a little time left.\"  \"All right.\" Hendricks picked up a piece of rock, pulling himself to a sitting position. \"Watch.\"  Hendricks began to scratch in the ash. Tasso stood by him, watching the motion of the rock. Hendricks was sketching a crude lunar map.         *       *       *       *       *  \"This is the Appenine range. Here is the Crater of Archimedes. The Moon Base is beyond the end of the Appenine, about two hundred miles. I don't know exactly where. No one on Terra knows. But when you're over the Appenine, signal with one red flare and a green flare, followed by two red flares in quick succession. The Base monitor will record your signal. The Base is under the surface, of course. They'll guide you down with magnetic grapples.\"  \"And the controls? Can I operate them?\"  \"The controls are virtually automatic. All you have to do is give the right signal at the right time.\"  \"I will.\"  \"The seat absorbs most of the take-off shock. Air and temperature are automatically controlled. The ship will leave Terra and pass out into free space. It'll line itself up with the moon, falling into an orbit around it, about a hundred miles above the surface. The orbit will carry you over the Base. When you're in the region of the Appenine, release the signal rockets.\"  Tasso slid into the ship and lowered herself into the pressure seat. The arm locks folded automatically around her. She fingered the controls. \"Too bad you're not going, Major. All this put here for you, and you can't make the trip.\"  \"Leave me the pistol.\"  Tasso pulled the pistol from her belt. She held it in her hand, weighing it thoughtfully. \"Don't go too far from this location. It'll be hard to find you, as it is.\"  \"No. I'll stay here by the well.\"  Tasso gripped the take-off switch, running her fingers over the smooth metal. \"A beautiful ship, Major. Well built. I admire your workmanship. You people have always done good work. You build fine things. Your work, your creations, are your greatest achievement.\"  \"Give me the pistol,\" Hendricks said impatiently, holding out his hand. He struggled to his feet.  \"Good-bye, Major.\" Tasso tossed the pistol past Hendricks. The pistol clattered against the ground, bouncing and rolling away. Hendricks hurried after it. He bent down, snatching it up.  The hatch of the ship clanged shut. The bolts fell into place. Hendricks made his way back. The inner door was being sealed. He raised the pistol unsteadily.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a shattering roar. The ship burst up from its metal cage, fusing the mesh behind it. Hendricks cringed, pulling back. The ship shot up into the rolling clouds of ash, disappearing into the sky.  Hendricks stood watching a long time, until even the streamer had dissipated. Nothing stirred. The morning air was chill and silent. He began to walk aimlessly back the way they had come. Better to keep moving around. It would be a long time before help came--if it came at all.  He searched his pockets until he found a package of cigarettes. He lit one grimly. They had all wanted cigarettes from him. But cigarettes were scarce.  A lizard slithered by him, through the ash. He halted, rigid. The lizard disappeared. Above, the sun rose higher in the sky. Some flies landed on a flat rock to one side of him. Hendricks kicked at them with his foot.  It was getting hot. Sweat trickled down his face, into his collar. His mouth was dry.  Presently he stopped walking and sat down on some debris. He unfastened his medicine kit and swallowed a few narcotic capsules. He looked around him. Where was he?  Something lay ahead. Stretched out on the ground. Silent and unmoving.  Hendricks drew his gun quickly. It looked like a man. Then he remembered. It was the remains of Klaus. The Second Variety. Where Tasso had blasted him. He could see wheels and relays and metal parts, strewn around on the ash. Glittering and sparkling in the sunlight.  Hendricks got to his feet and walked over. He nudged the inert form with his foot, turning it over a little. He could see the metal hull, the aluminum ribs and struts. More wiring fell out. Like viscera. Heaps of wiring, switches and relays. Endless motors and rods.  He bent down. The brain cage had been smashed by the fall. The artificial brain was visible. He gazed at it. A maze of circuits. Miniature tubes. Wires as fine as hair. He touched the brain cage. It swung aside. The type plate was visible. Hendricks studied the plate.  And blanched.  IV--IV.  For a long time he stared at the plate. Fourth Variety. Not the Second. They had been wrong. There were more types. Not just three. Many more, perhaps. At least four. And Klaus wasn't the Second Variety.  But if Klaus wasn't the Second Variety--  Suddenly he tensed. Something was coming, walking through the ash beyond the hill. What was it? He strained to see. Figures. Figures coming slowly along, making their way through the ash.  Coming toward him.  Hendricks crouched quickly, raising his gun. Sweat dripped down into his eyes. He fought down rising panic, as the figures neared.  The first was a David. The David saw him and increased its pace. The others hurried behind it. A second David. A third. Three Davids, all alike, coming toward him silently, without expression, their thin legs rising and falling. Clutching their teddy bears.  He aimed and fired. The first two Davids dissolved into particles. The third came on. And the figure behind it. Climbing silently toward him across the gray ash. A Wounded Soldier, towering over the David. And--         *       *       *       *       *  And behind the Wounded Soldier came two Tassos, walking side by side. Heavy belt, Russian army pants, shirt, long hair. The familiar figure, as he had seen her only a little while before. Sitting in the pressure seat of the ship. Two slim, silent figures, both identical.  They were very near. The David bent down suddenly, dropping its teddy bear. The bear raced across the ground. Automatically, Hendricks' fingers tightened around the trigger. The bear was gone, dissolved into mist. The two Tasso Types moved on, expressionless, walking side by side, through the gray ash.  When they were almost to him, Hendricks raised the pistol waist high and fired.  The two Tassos dissolved. But already a new group was starting up the rise, five or six Tassos, all identical, a line of them coming rapidly toward him.  And he had given her the ship and the signal code. Because of him she was on her way to the moon, to the Moon Base. He had made it possible.  He had been right about the bomb, after all. It had been designed with knowledge of the other types, the David Type and the Wounded Soldier Type. And the Klaus Type. Not designed by human beings. It had been designed by one of the underground factories, apart from all human contact.  The line of Tassos came up to him. Hendricks braced himself, watching them calmly. The familiar face, the belt, the heavy shirt, the bomb carefully in place.  The bomb--  As the Tassos reached for him, a last ironic thought drifted through Hendricks' mind. He felt a little better, thinking about it. The bomb. Made by the Second Variety to destroy the other varieties. Made for that end alone.  They were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32040"],["title","Diplomatic Immunity (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction August 1953.

Still, if the Earth was to live as a free world, he had to       die._         *       *       *       *       *     \"Come right in, gentlemen,\" the Ambassador waved them into the very special suite the State Department had given him. \"Please be seated.\"  Colonel Cercy accepted a chair, trying to size up the individual who had all Washington chewing its fingernails. The Ambassador hardly looked like a menace. He was of medium height and slight build, dressed in a conservative brown tweed suit that the State Department had given him. His face was intelligent, finely molded and aloof.  _As human as a human_, Cercy thought, studying the alien with bleak, impersonal eyes.  \"How may I serve you?\" the Ambassador asked, smiling.  \"The President has put me in charge of your case,\" Cercy said. \"I've studied Professor Darrig's reports--\" he nodded at the scientist beside him--\"but I'd like to hear the whole thing for myself.\"  \"Of course,\" the alien said, lighting a cigarette. He seemed genuinely pleased to be asked; which was interesting, Cercy thought. In the week since he had landed, every important scientist in the country had been at him.  _But in a pinch they call the Army_, Cercy reminded himself. He settled back in his chair, both hands jammed carelessly in his pockets. His right hand was resting on the butt of a .45, the safety off.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I have come,\" the alien said, \"as an ambassador-at-large, representing an empire that stretches half-way across the Galaxy. I wish to extend the welcome of my people and to invite you to join our organization.\"  \"I see,\" Cercy replied. \"Some of the scientists got the impression that participation was compulsory.\"  \"You will join,\" the Ambassador said, blowing smoke through his nostrils.  Cercy could see Darrig stiffen in his chair and bite his lip. Cercy moved the automatic to a position where he could draw it easily. \"How did you find us?\" he asked.  \"We ambassadors-at-large are each assigned an unexplored section of space,\" the alien said. \"We examine each star-system in that region for planets, and each planet for intelligent life. Intelligent life is rare in the Galaxy, you know.\"  Cercy nodded, although he hadn't been aware of the fact.  \"When we find such a planet, we land, as I did, and prepare the inhabitants for their part in our organization.\"  \"How will your people know that you have found intelligent life?\" Cercy asked.  \"There is a sending mechanism that is part of our structure,\" the Ambassador answered. \"It is triggered when we reach an inhabited planet. This signal is beamed continually into space, to an effective range of several thousand light-years. Follow-up crews are continually sweeping through the limits of the reception area of each Ambassador, listening for such messages. Detecting one, a colonizing team follows it to the planet.\"  He tapped his cigarette delicately on the edge of an ash tray. \"This method has definite advantages over sending combined colonization and exploration teams obviously. It avoids the necessity of equipping large forces for what may be decades of searching.\"  \"Sure.\" Cercy's face was expressionless. \"Would you tell me more about this message?\"  \"There isn't much more you need know. The beam is not detectable by your methods and, therefore, cannot be jammed. The message continues as long as I am alive.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Darrig drew in his breath sharply, glancing at Cercy.  \"If you stopped broadcasting,\" Cercy said casually, \"our planet would never be found.\"  \"Not until this section of space was resurveyed,\" the diplomat agreed.  \"Very well. As a duly appointed representative of the President of the United States, I ask you to stop transmitting. We don't choose to become part of your empire.\"  \"I'm sorry,\" the Ambassador said. He shrugged his shoulders easily. Cercy wondered how many times he had played this scene on how many other planets.  \"There's really nothing I can do.\" He stood up.  \"Then you won't stop?\"  \"I can't. I have no control over the sending, once it's activated.\" The diplomat turned and walked to the window. \"However, I have prepared a philosophy for you. It is my duty, as your Ambassador, to ease the shock of transition as much as possible. This philosophy will make it instantly apparent that--\"  As the Ambassador reached the window, Cercy's gun was out of his pocket and roaring. He squeezed six rounds in almost a single explosion, aiming at the Ambassador's head and back. Then an uncontrollable shudder ran through him.  The Ambassador was no longer there!         *       *       *       *       *  Cercy and Darrig stared at each other. Darrig muttered something about ghosts. Then, just as suddenly, the Ambassador was back.  \"You didn't think,\" he said, \"that it would be as easy as all that, did you? We Ambassadors have, necessarily, a certain diplomatic immunity.\" He fingered one of the bullet holes in the wall. \"In case you don't understand, let me put it this way. It is not in your power to kill me. You couldn't even understand the nature of my defense.\"  He looked at them, and in that moment Cercy felt the Ambassador's complete alienness.  \"Good day, gentlemen,\" he said.  Darrig and Cercy walked silently back to the control room. Neither had really expected that the Ambassador would be killed so easily, but it had still been a shock when the slugs had failed.  \"I suppose you saw it all, Malley?\" Cercy asked, when he reached the control room.  The thin, balding psychiatrist nodded sadly. \"Got it on film, too.\"  \"I wonder what his philosophy is,\" Darrig mused, half to himself.  \"It was illogical to expect it would work. No race would send an ambassador with a message like that and expect him to live through it. Unless--\"  \"Unless what?\"  \"Unless he had a pretty effective defense,\" the psychiatrist finished unhappily.  Cercy walked across the room and looked at the video panel. The Ambassador's suite was very special. It had been hurriedly constructed two days after he had landed and delivered his message. The suite was steel and lead lined, filled with video and movie cameras, recorders, and a variety of other things.  It was the last word in elaborate death cells.  In the screen, Cercy could see the Ambassador sitting at a table. He was typing on a little portable the Government had given him.  \"Hey, Harrison!\" Cercy called. \"Might as well go ahead with Plan Two.\"  Harrison came out of a side room where he had been examining the circuits leading to the Ambassador's suite. Methodically he checked his pressure gauges, set the controls and looked at Cercy. \"Now?\" he asked.  \"Now.\" Cercy watched the screen. The Ambassador was still typing.  Suddenly, as Harrison sent home the switch, the room was engulfed in flames. Fire blasted out of concealed holes in the walls, poured from the ceiling and floor.  In a moment, the room was like the inside of a blast furnace.  Cercy let it burn for two minutes, then motioned Harrison to cut the switch. They stared at the roasted room.  They were looking, hopefully, for a charred corpse.  But the Ambassador reappeared beside his desk, looking ruefully at the charred typewriter. He was completely unsinged.  \"Could you get me another typewriter?\" he asked, looking directly at one of the hidden projectors. \"I'm setting down a philosophy for you ungrateful wretches.\"  He seated himself in the wreckage of an armchair. In a moment, he was apparently asleep.         *       *       *       *       *  \"All right, everyone grab a seat,\" Cercy said. \"Time for a council of war.\"  Malley straddled a chair backward. Harrison lighted a pipe as he sat down, slowly puffing it into life.  \"Now, then,\" Cercy said. \"The Government has dropped this squarely in our laps. We have to kill the Ambassador--obviously. I've been put in charge.\" Cercy grinned with regret. \"Probably because no one higher up wants the responsibility of failure. And I've selected you three as my staff. We can have anything we want, any assistance or advice we need. All right. Any ideas?\"  \"How about Plan Three?\" Harrison asked.  \"We'll get to that,\" Cercy said. \"But I don't believe it's going to work.\"  \"I don't either,\" Darrig agreed. \"We don't even know the nature of his defense.\"  \"That's the first order of business. Malley, take all our data so far, and get someone to feed it into the Derichman Analyzer. You know the stuff we want. What properties has X, if X can do thus and thus?\"  \"Right,\" Malley said. He left, muttering something about the ascendancy of the physical sciences.  \"Harrison,\" Cercy asked, \"is Plan Three set up?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Give it a try.\"  While Harrison was making his last adjustments, Cercy watched Darrig. The plump little physicist was staring thoughtfully into space, muttering to himself. Cercy hoped he would come up with something. He was expecting great things of Darrig.  Knowing the impossibility of working with great numbers of people, Cercy had picked his staff with care. Quality was what he wanted.  With that in mind, he had chosen Harrison first. The stocky, sour-faced engineer had a reputation for being able to build anything, given half an idea of how it worked.  Cercy had selected Malley, the psychiatrist, because he wasn't sure that killing the Ambassador was going to be a purely physical problem.  Darrig was a mathematical physicist, but his restless, curious mind had come up with some interesting theories in other fields. He was the only one of the four who was really interested in the Ambassador as an intellectual "]]]
