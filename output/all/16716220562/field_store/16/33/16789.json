I gave the Margrave Hansen of Brussels the letter of recommendation which my lord of Bamberg wrote for me, and I made him a present of a \"Passion,\" engraved on copper for a remembrance.  I have also dined once more with my lords of Nuremberg. I saw in the town hall at Brussels, in the golden chamber, four paintings which the great Master Rogier did; and behind the King's palace in Brussels, the fountains, labyrinth, zoological garden. Anything more beautiful and pleasing to me, more like a paradise, I have never seen.  Erasmus is the name of the little man [Editor's note: not Erasmus of Rotterdam, but a clerk of Bannisis] who wrote out my supplication at Jacob Bannisis' house. At Brussels there is a very splendid town hall, large and covered with beautiful stonework, with a noble open tower. I have made a portrait of Master Conrad of Brussels by candlelight; he is my host. At the same time I drew Doctor Lamparter's son in charcoal, and also the hostess.  Also I have seen the things which they have brought to the King out of the new land of gold: a sun all of gold, a whole fathom broad, and a moon, too, of silver, of the same size, also two rooms full of armour, and the people there with all manner of wondrous weapons, harness, darts, wonderful shields, extraordinary clothing, beds, and all kinds of wonderful things for human use, much finer to look at than prodigies. These things are all so precious that they are valued at 100,000 gulden, and all the days of my life I have seen nothing that reaches my heart so much as these, for among them I have seen wonderfully artistic things and have admired the subtle ingenuity of men in foreign lands; indeed, I don't know how to express what I there found.  I also saw many other beautiful things at Brussels, and especially a great fish bone there, as vast as if it had been built up of square stones; it was a fathom long, very thick, weighs up to 1 cwt. (15 centner), and it has the form as is here drawn; it stood behind on the fish's head.  I have also been in the Lord of Nassau's house, which is so magnificently built and so beautifully decorated. I have again dined twice with my lords. Lady Margaret sent after me to Brussels and promised that she would speak in my behalf to King Charles, and has shown herself quite exceptionally kind to me: I sent her my engraved \"Passion\" and such another to her treasurer, Jan Marnix by name, and I made his portrait in charcoal. I paid 2 stivers for a buffalo ring, and also 2 stivers for opening St. Luke's picture.  When I was in Herr von Nassau's house I saw in the chapel the fine painting that Master Hugo has made, and I also saw two large beautiful halls, and all the treasures in various parts of the house, and the large bed in which fifty men can lie. And I also saw the great stone which the storm cast down in the field close to Herr von Nassau. This house lies high, and there is a most beautiful view at which one cannot but wonder. And I think that in all German lands there is not the like of it.  Master Bernhard, the painter, invited me to dinner, and had prepared a meal so costly that I do not think 10 florins will pay for it. Three friends invited themselves to it to give me good company, to wit, Lady Margaret's treasurer, whose portrait I made, and the King's steward, de Metenye, and the town treasurer, Van Busleyden; I gave him a \"Passion\" engraved on copper, and he gave me in return a black Spanish bag worth 3 florins. And I also gave a \"Passion\" engraved on copper to Erasmus of Rotterdam; likewise one to Erasmus, the secretary of Bannisis. The man at Antwerp who gave me the \"Child's Head\" is called Lorenz Sterk. I took the portrait in charcoal of Master Bernhard, Lady Margaret's painter. I have taken Erasmus of Rotterdam's portrait once more. I gave Lorenz Sterk a sitting \"St. Jerome\" and the \"Melancholy,\" and I made a portrait of my hostess's godmother. Six people whose portraits I painted at Brussels gave me nothing. I paid 3 stivers for two buffalo horns and 1 stiver for two Eulenspiegels.  So then on the Sunday after St. Giles', I traveled with Herr Tomasin to Mechlin and took leave of Herr Hans Ebner, and he would take nothing for my expenses while I was with him seven days; I paid 1 stiver on behalf of Hans Geuder; I gave 1 stiver as a tip to the host's servant; and at Mechlin I took supper with the Lady Nieuwekerke; and early on Monday I traveled from Mechlin to Antwerp.  AT ANTWERP (September 3 - October 4, 1520)  I breakfasted with the Portuguese factor, who gave me three porcelain dishes, and Rodrigo gave me some Calicut feathers. I spent 1 florin and paid my messenger 2 stivers. I bought Susanna a mantle for 2 florins, 10 stivers. My wife paid 4 florins Rhenish for a washtub, a bellows, a basin, a pair of slippers, wood for cooking, stockings, a cage for the parrot, 2 jugs, and for tips; she spent, moreover, for eating, drinking, and various necessaries, 21 stivers.  Now on Monday after St. Giles' I am back again at Jobst Planckfelter's, and have dined with him as many times as are drawn here-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII.  I gave Nicolas, Tomasin's man, 1 stiver; I paid 5 stivers for the little frame, and 1 stiver more. My host gave me an Indian cocoanut and an old Turkish whip; then I have dined IIIIIIIIIIIII more with Tomasin. The two lords of Rogendorf have invited me; I have dined once with them and made a large drawing of their coat of arms on wood, for engraving. I gave away 1 stiver; my wife changed a florin for 24 stivers; I gave 2 stivers as a tip. I have dined once in Focker's house with the young Jacob Rehlinger, and I have also dined once more with him. My wife has changed a florin for 24 stivers for expenses. I gave to Wilhelm Hauenhut, the servant of my lord Duke Frederick, the Platzgraf, an engraved \"Jerome,\" and the two new half-sheets, the \"Mary\" and the \"Anthony.\" I gave Herr Jacob Bannisis a good painting of a \"Veronica\" face, a \"Eustace,\" a \"Melancholy,\" and a sitting \"Jerome,\" a \"St. Anthony,\" the two new \"Marys,\" and the new \"Peasants.\" And I have given his secretary, Erasmus, who wrote my supplication, a sitting \"Jerome,\" a \"Melancholy,\" an \"Anthony,\" the two new \"Marys,\" and the \"Peasants,\" and I have given him also two small \"Marys,\" and all together what I have given is worth 7 florins, and I have given Master Marc, the goldsmith, a \"Passion\" on copper, and he gave me 3 florins in payment; besides this I have received 3 florins, 20 stivers, for prints. To the glazier Honigen, I have given four little engravings. I have dined with Herr Bannisis III. I paid 4 stivers for carbon and black chalk; I have given 1 florin, 8 stivers for wood, and spent 3 stivers more. I have dined with the lords of Nuremberg IIIIIIIIII. Master Dietrich, the glass painter, sent me the red colour which is found in the new bricks at Antwerp. I made charcoal portrait of Jacob von Lubeck; he gave my wife a Philip's florin.

I sold a woodcut \"Passion\" for 12 stivers, besides an \"Adam and Eve\" for 4 stivers. Felix, the captain and lute- player, bought a whole set of copper-engravings and a woodcut \"Passion\" and an engraved \"Passion,\" two half-sheets and two quarter-sheets, for 8 gold florins; so I gave him another set of engravings. I have taken Herr Bannisis's portrait in charcoal. Rodrigo gave me another parrot, and I gave his boy 2 stivers for a tip. I gave Johann von den Winckel, the trumpeter, a small woodcut \"Passion,\" \"St. Jerome in his Cell,\" and a \"Melancholy.\" I paid 6 stivers for a pair of gloves.

I paid 1 stiver for the printed \"Entry into Antwerp,\" showing how the King was received with a splendid triumph; the gates were beautifully decorated, and there were plays, much rejoicing, and beautiful maidens in tableaux vivants, whose like I have seldom seen. Changed 1 florin for expenses.  I have seen the bones of the great giant at Antwerp; his leg above his knee is five and a half feet long, and beyond measure heavy; so were his shoulder blades--a single one is broader than a strong man's back--and his other limbs. The man was eighteen feet high, and reigned at Antwerp and did great wonders, as is set out in an old book which belongs to the town magistrates.  Raphael of Urbino's effects have been all dispersed after his death, but one of his disciples, Tommaso of Bologna by name, a good painter, desired to see me, so he came to me and gave me a gold ring, an antique with a well-cut stone worth 5 florins, but I have been already offered twice as much for it; in return I gave him my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],["title","Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#7)"],["body","engravings, worth 6 florins.
