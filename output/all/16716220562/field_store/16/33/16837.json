Dave Dawson paused in his restless pacing up and down to look at it for the hundredth time in the last half hour. He glared at it, sighed heavily, and made noises deep in his throat.  \"Where is that Freddy Farmer guy, anyway?\" he grated to himself. \"For half an hour I've been pounding shoe leather here waiting for him. Darned if he isn't worse than a woman, not being at a place on time. But he's probably lost. And if he is, he can stay lost for all I care.\"  With a sharp nod for emphasis, he walked over to the newsstand and bought a bar of candy. The Union News lad back of the counter glanced at the row of decoration ribbons under Dawson's wings, and gave him a smile and the kind of look that said he'd like to hear about some of Dawson's experiences. Dave ignored the look, however, and turned away. He didn't want to talk about the war. In fact, he didn't even want to think about it. Freddy and he were enjoying a much-deserved leave, and they still had four days to go. And until those four days had come and gone, the war could be on another world as far as he was concerned. Right! The heck with it for four more days!  For the hundred-and-first time Dawson looked at the information-booth clock. The hands said twenty-seven minutes of four now, and Dave made noises in his throat once again. He pulled two hockey-game tickets out of his tunic pocket and looked at them.  \"For two cents I'd leave him flat and get somebody else to go with me!\" he muttered. \"I should have drawn the bum a map so he could use it to get over here from Times Square. He--\"  He let the rest trail off as he saw Freddy Farmer hurrying toward him from the direction of the IRT shuttle train to Times Square. He fixed the English-born air ace with a disgusted eye and watched him approach. Freddy came up to him all smiles and slightly flushed.  \"Waiting for somebody, old thing?\" he greeted Dave.  \"No!\" Dawson snapped. \"And my mother taught me never to speak to strangers. So scram, before I call a cop.\"  \"Speaking of your New York cops,\" Freddy Farmer chuckled, \"I wouldn't be here now, if it hadn't been for a bobby in the Bronx.\"  \"Bronx?\" Dawson exploded. \"What the heck were you doing up there? This morning you said you were going to hear Benny Goodman's band over at the Paramount Theatre.\"  \"And so I did,\" Freddy replied with a nod. \"And it was absolutely topping. But--\"  \"Topping, he says!\" Dawson snorted. \"You should show your passport when you use words like that. You mean keen, or in the groove, or on the beam, or strictly the nuts. But what about the Bronx? Did Goodman lead a parade?\"  \"If you'll be so kind as to shut that big mouth of yours, I'll explain!\" Freddy snapped. \"After the show I had something to eat, and--\"  \"As if I couldn't guess _that_!\" Dawson grunted. \"And so?\"  \"And so when I came out of the restaurant it was snowing,\" the English youth said. \"And--\"  \"Snowing, in _January_?\" Dawson mock-gasped and widened his eyes. \"Well, what do you know about that? So you just stood there and watched it snowing in January, of all times, while I cooled my heels here waiting for you!\"  \"Do you want to listen, or would you rather give that tongue of yours exercise?\" Freddy Farmer bit off.  \"Okay, okay, but make it good!\" Dawson sighed. \"I've got two tickets for the Ranger-Chicago Hawks hockey game tonight. Make your story good, or somebody else goes with me!\"  \"What?\" Freddy cried. \"You've got--Good grief! Now we've got four!\"  \"Four what?\" Dawson demanded. \"Or am I supposed to guess?\"  \"Four tickets to the hockey game,\" Freddy Farmer said, and produced two from his own pocket. \"I couldn't remember who was to get the tickets. So after I came out of the restaurant, I walked up to Madison Square Garden and got two tickets just to be sure. And--What's the matter, Dave? You suddenly sick, or something?\"  The last was because Dawson had made a face, groaned, and clapped one hand to his forehead. With the other he reached out and grabbed Freddy's hand that held the hockey-game tickets, and jerked it up until the tickets were about an inch from the end of the English youth's nose.  \"Boy, are you something!\" he groaned. \"Take a look, Bright Eyes! Take a good look! You went to the wrong window. Those tickets are for the Ranger-Boston Bruin game next Wednesday!\"  \"Oh, good grief, no!\" Freddy cried. \"I didn't know there was any special window. I just went to one and asked the chap for two good tickets to the next game. And he gave me these. I'll take them back and--\"  \"No, you won't, sweetheart!\" Dawson interrupted, and shook his head. \"You'll just be out that dough, and maybe it will teach you to use your head next time. We'll give the tickets to the first two soldiers we meet. But let's get back to the Bronx. Did the ticket fellow send you up there?\"  \"No, it was one of your blasted tube trains!\" Freddy Farmer growled. \"I asked the chap what tube I should take to get to Grand Central. He didn't understand me until I remembered that you call the _tube_ the subway. So--\"  \"You mean you English guys call the _subway_ the tube,\" Dawson cut in again. \"How many times have I got to tell you that when in Rome shoot Roman candles! So you went to the subway, and--? Now what?\"  Freddy Farmer didn't reply. He stood staring at something behind Dawson. Dave turned impulsively, but all he saw was a lot of people hurrying toward their respective destinations. He turned back and looked at Freddy.  \"Okay, come up for air!\" he growled. \"What's eating you, anyway?\"  \"That chap over there by the ticket window,\" the English-born air ace finally said. \"The chap in gray. I've seen him half-a-dozen times today.\"  \"So what?\" Dawson grunted. \"It's a free country and a small world. What of it?\"  \"Nothing, except that the first time was in the lobby of the hotel as you and I were leaving,\" Freddy said. \"And the next time he was three seats away from me in the Paramount. And the next time was in the restaurant; then at Madison Square Garden; and up in the Bronx, too.\"  \"No kidding?\" Dawson echoed, half expecting his pal to pull some kind of a gag.  \"No kidding at all,\" Freddy replied promptly. \"I'm certain that the chap has been following me around.\"  \"Could be,\" Dawson murmured, and casually turned around so that he could get a look at the man in gray. \"Frankly, though, you _do_ look like a guy with itchy fingers, and we've got a lot of expensive things in this town. He's probably a plain-clothes detective from Police Headquarters.\"  \"Then I'm definitely in a mess now!\" Freddy Farmer snapped right back at him. \"I'm sure it's a crime in any country to be caught talking to the likes of you! See him, Dave?\"  \"Yeah,\" Dawson grunted, turning back. \"A nice-looking guy. And he didn't get that overcoat with cigarette coupons. We'll check up in a couple of minutes and see if he continues to trail you. Right now, though, I can hardly wait. What about the Bronx, anyway?\"  \"I took the wrong tube train, that's all,\" Freddy said. \"And I went right to the end of the line, which was in the Bronx, but not a single station said Grand Central. I got off and asked"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32331"],["title","Dave Dawson at Casablanca (#1)"],["body"," bobby how to get there. He was a very fine chap, and straightened me out. But, good grief, I've certainly seen a lot of New York today!\"  \"Well, don't ever take a subway to Brooklyn!\" Dawson advised. \"You wouldn't be back for a week. What shall we do now? Where'll we go, I mean. Want to take a subway ride?\"  \"Deliver me!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"Definitely, no! Personally, I'm hungry. Let's go find a nice restaurant and fuel up, what?\"  \"Okay,\" Dawson sighed. \"I suppose you've got to have a nine-course snack to keep you from fainting until supper. Okay. But let's go to the dining room in the Biltmore Hotel next door. If your friend in gray follows you there, we'll know he's up to something. Ten to one, though, you've been having a pipe dream.\"  \"Perhaps,\" Freddy Farmer admitted as he dropped into step with Dawson. \"But that's definitely the same chap I've been seeing all day long. I wonder why the blighter _is_ following me around? No, no, my little man! Just keep your opinion to yourself. I--I say, wait a minute, Dave!\"  Freddy Farmer left Dawson's side and went over to two Yank soldiers who were obviously going no place, but just taking in the sights. They saluted him as he came up and stopped in front of them.  \"I say, you two on leave, what?\" he asked with a grin.  \"Yes, sir,\" they replied together, and gave him a funny look.  \"Will you be in town come next Wednesday?\" Freddy asked again.  \"Yes, sir,\" they replied in the same breath.  \"Good!\" Freddy beamed, and held out the hockey tickets. \"Use these, if you like. And half a minute! Here, buy yourselves some little thing, what? And good luck.\"  Freddy Farmer added two one-dollar bills to the hockey tickets and walked away. The two soldiers gaped down at the two tickets and the two dollars.  \"What's the matter with that guy; is he touched?\" one of them mumbled. \"And did you hear him, Fuzzy? He didn't even speak English!\"  \"Who cares?\" Fuzzy asked as he came out of his trance. \"Two four-buck-forty hockey tickets, and two bucks in cash! Who cares if the guy is touched? He's okay by me!\"  \"Well, well!\" Dawson chuckled when Freddy joined him. \"Darned if the kid didn't at that! And even let go of two bucks.\"  \"All I had on me,\" Freddy said with a smile. \"So that makes you the one to pay for our meal, see?\"  \"Oh, yeah?\" Dawson jeered. \"Well, don't look right now, but standing in your shoes is a guy who's heading for a lot of dish washing in the Biltmore kitchen!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Just in Case_   \"Well?\" Freddy Farmer demanded as he leaned across the dining table toward Dawson. \"Did I have a pipe dream, or not? Did you see who just came in and sat down?\"  \"Yeah,\" Dawson grunted, and buttered a roll. \"Your pal in gray. I wonder what's the big idea?\"  \"So do I!\" Freddy echoed instantly. \"And I've half a mind to go over right now and ask him. The beggar is beginning to give me the creeps. He doesn't look foreign, though.\"  \"Hey, come out of your spin, pal!\" Dawson chuckled. \"What do you think this is, Gestapo stuff?\"  Freddy Farmer looked at Dawson and smiled slowly.  \"I wouldn't know, old thing,\" he said. \"You see, this isn't England, so I wouldn't know for sure _what_ kind of funny business was afoot.\"  \"Ouch!\" Dawson yipped softly, and flung up an arm in front of his face. \"Right in the eye, that time. You're improving each day with your snappy come-back, my young friend. Keep it up, and you'll be the life of the party some day. Well, I guess that's all the fodder I want right now. How's for a stroll around in the beautiful January snow, huh? But it's probably slush by now, and--Hey! I almost forgot! You think I'm paying for your meal, don't you? Well--\"  \"Of course not!\" Freddy Farmer cut in quickly. \"And just to show my heart's in the right place, I'll even pay for both of us.\"  \"I wonder if there's a doctor in the house?\" Dawson murmured, and stared hard at the English youth. \"Sure you feel all right, Freddy?\"  \"Never felt better,\" the other replied. \"Wait just a moment, will you, old thing? I'll be right back.\"  Before Dawson could ask questions, Freddy got up from his chair and walked quickly across the dining room and down the broad flight of carpeted steps to the lobby. Dawson blinked, then took a sip of water, and glanced over at the man in gray. The mysterious stranger was looking toward the lobby, and was in the act of pushing himself up out of his chair. He seemed to change his mind, however. He shot a quick look over Dawson's way, then settled back in his chair and went to work on a piece of pie the waiter had placed in front of him.  \"That bird sure is plenty interested in Freddy,\" Dawson muttered to himself, and frowned. \"I wonder what the heck's cooking around here, anyway?\"  He played with that thought for two or three minutes, but was unable to get any place. And then as he happened to glance toward the dining-room lobby entrance, he saw Freddy Farmer standing there and beckoning to him urgently. Dawson raised questioning eyebrows, took a look toward the man in gray, got up from his chair, and started to leave the table. He had taken but two steps when the waiter appeared at his elbow.  \"The check, Captain,\" the waiter said politely.  \"Oh, yeah,\" Dawson murmured absently, and glanced at the total. He pulled some money from his pocket and gave it to the waiter. \"There you are,\" he murmured again, and hurried over to the lobby entrance to the dining room where Freddy was waiting.  The English-born air ace greeted him with a grin like a Cheshire cat.  \"And let that be a lesson to you, my good fellow,\" Freddy said with an emphatic nod of his head.  \"Says which?\" Dawson grunted, and gave him a blank look.  Freddy Farmer patted his stomach and licked his lips.  \"A delicious meal, quite!\" he breathed. \"I hope you gave the waiter a decent tip. But, knowing you, I doubt it.\"  Dawson started violently, and his jaw dropped.  \"Well, you little I-don't-know-what!\" he eventually exploded. \"Stuck me for the meal, didn't you? I knew darn well you must have had something in mind when you gave your last two bucks to those soldiers. You play the big-hearted big shot to them, and _I_ get stuck for your two bucks' worth of food!\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't say that,\" Freddy Farmer chuckled. \"Just say it's your share in the lease-lend agreement between America and England. I'll pay you back some day, too.\"  \"Yeah!\" Dawson sneered. \"When I'm a hundred and six and have lost all my teeth. When I can eat only soup instead of a thick steak like I just bought for you. But you just wait, my little bowlegged pet! I'll--Oh-oh! The man in gray, eh?\" Dawson added the last because of the flinty look that had suddenly leaped into Farmer's eyes.  \"Quite!\" Freddy murmured. \"And I'm jolly well sick of this hide-and-seek business. I'm going to find out what the blighter's up to. I detest shadows, excepting my own.\"  With a grim nod Freddy Farmer stepped past Dawson and walked over toward the man in gray who was just leaving the dining room. Dawson impulsively swung around and followed him. The man in gray acted as though he did not see Freddy, but the English youth stopped in front of him, barring his way.  \"Have you been wishing to speak to me, sir?\" Freddy asked quietly. \"Is that why you've been following me all over town all day?\"  The man in gray looked blank for a moment. Then he shrugged and gave Freddy a friendly smile.  \"It _has_ been rather obvious, hasn't it, Captain Farmer?\" he said as both Freddy and Dawson stared at him, dumbfounded. \"But you went to a lot of places where I couldn't help but show myself. I guess you've had enough experience to guess when you're being trailed. The name is Carter, Captain.\"  As the man in gray introduced himself, he slipped something out of his pocket and held it cupped in his hand so both youths could see it. They took a good look at the gold F.B.I. badge and quickly raised their eyes to the man's face.  \"The F.B.I. no less!\" Dawson breathed. \"What's up? Is Farmer wanted by the F.B.I.--I hope?\"  The man chuckled and shook his head.  \"No,\" he said. \"Neither of you are, in fact. The two of us just had orders to keep an eye on you both.\"  \"'_Two_ of us'?\" Dave echoed sharply. \"You mean--\" He let the rest go as the F.B.I. agent nodded.  \"That's right, Captain Dawson,\" he said quietly, and made a faint gesture toward the other side of the lobby. \"My partner has been looking after you, while I tried to keep up with Captain Farmer here. If Captain Farmer hadn't returned to the dining room, I'd have taken on the job of sticking with you, and my partner would have tackled Captain Farmer. Frankly, I would have enjoyed the change. But now--\"  The F.B.I. agent grinned and shrugged.  \"But now that the cat's out of the bag,\" he said, \"suppose we stop playing cops and robbers and make it a foursome? My partner got tickets right behind your seats for the hockey game tonight. We're also staying at your hotel. Or would you rather be alone? Now don't be afraid that you'll hurt my feelings. I'll understand. After all, a couple of fellows on leave have their rights, you know.\"  \"Yeah, sure, of course,\" Dawson mumbled absently, not quite sure if he was in the middle of a dream or not. \"Sure, sure it's okay by Freddy and me. But--but look, sir. I mean, what's all the big idea? Why should the F.B.I. want to follow us around? I don't get it.\"  \"To be perfectly frank, neither do I,\" Agent Carter made the amazing reply. \"All I know is that two days ago we were given orders to come up from Washington, register at your hotel, and keep an eye on you two.\"  \"But for what?\" Freddy Farmer asked. \"You mean you were to guard us from harm, or some such silly rot?\"  \"I wouldn't exactly call it silly rot, Captain,\" the F.B.I. man said gravely. \"After all, you two are marked men, in a way. I mean by that, you've been thorns in the side of Axis Intelligence more than once since this Second World War started. Not that personal revenge by enemy agents in this country is to be expected."]]]
