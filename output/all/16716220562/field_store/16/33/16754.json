The Albertine Mountains had been disintegrated. Nothing remained but these vast clouds of debris. Below, on the ground, a ragged plain stretched out, swept by fire and ruin. Gaping wounds yawned, immense holes without bottom, craters side by side as far as the eye could see. Craters and debris. Like the blasted, pitted surface of the moon. Two hours ago it had been rolling peaks and gulleys, brush and green bushes and trees.  Cole turned away.  \"You see?\" Sherikov snapped the screen off. \"You were down there, not so long ago. All that noise and smoke--all for you. All for you, Mr. Variable Man from the past. Reinhart arranged that, to finish you off. I want you to understand that. It's very important that you realize that.\"  Cole said nothing.  Sherikov reached into a drawer of the table before him. He carefully brought out a small square box and held it out to Cole. \"You wired this, didn't you?\"  Cole took the box in his hands and held it. For a time his tired mind failed to focus. What did he have? He concentrated on it. The box was the children's toy. The inter-system vidsender, they had called it.  \"Yes. I fixed this.\" He passed it back to Sherikov. \"I repaired that. It was broken.\"  Sherikov gazed down at him intently, his large eyes bright. He nodded, his black beard and cigar rising and falling. \"Good. That's all I wanted to know.\" He got suddenly to his feet, pushing his chair back. \"I see the doctor's here. He'll fix you up. Everything you need. Later on I'll talk to you again.\"  Unprotesting, Cole got to his feet, allowing the doctor to take hold of his arm and help him up.  After Cole had been released by the medical department, Sherikov joined him in his private dining room, a floor above the actual laboratory.  The Pole gulped down a hasty meal, talking as he ate. Cole sat silently across from him, not eating or speaking. His old clothing had been taken away and new clothing given him. He was shaved and rubbed down. His sores and cuts were healed, his body and hair washed. He looked much healthier and younger, now. But he was still stooped and tired, his blue eyes worn and faded. He listened to Sherikov's account of the world of 2136 AD without comment.  \"You can see,\" Sherikov said finally, waving a chicken leg, \"that your appearance here has been very upsetting to our program. Now that you know more about us you can see why Commissioner Reinhart was so interested in destroying you.\"  Cole nodded.  \"Reinhart, you realize, believes that the failure of the SRB machines is the chief danger to the war effort. But that is nothing!\" Sherikov pushed his plate away noisily, draining his coffee mug. \"After all, wars _can_ be fought without statistical forecasts. The SRB machines only describe. They're nothing more than mechanical onlookers. In themselves, they don't affect the course of the war. _We_ make the war. They only analyze.\"  Cole nodded.  \"More coffee?\" Sherikov asked. He pushed the plastic container toward Cole. \"Have some.\"  Cole accepted another cupful. \"Thank you.\"  \"You can see that our real problem is another thing entirely. The machines only do figuring for us in a few minutes that eventually we could do for our own selves. They're our servants, tools. Not some sort of gods in a temple which we go and pray to. Not oracles who can see into the future for us. They don't see into the future. They only make statistical predictions--not prophecies. There's a big difference there, but Reinhart doesn't understand it. Reinhart and his kind have made such things as the SRB machines into gods. But I have no gods. At least, not any I can see.\"  Cole nodded, sipping his coffee.  \"I'm telling you all these things because you must understand what we're up against. Terra is hemmed in on all sides by the ancient Centauran Empire. It's been out there for centuries, thousands of years. No one knows how long. It's old--crumbling and rotting. Corrupt and venal. But it holds most of the galaxy around us, and we can't break out of the Sol system. I told you about Icarus, and Hedge's work in ftl flight. We must win the war against Centaurus. We've waited and worked a long time for this, the moment when we can break out and get room among the stars for ourselves. Icarus is the deciding weapon. The data on Icarus tipped the SRB odds in our favor--for the first time in history. Success in the war against Centaurus will depend on Icarus, not on the SRB machines. You see?\"  Cole nodded.  \"However, there is a problem. The data on Icarus which I turned over to the machines specified that Icarus would be completed in ten days. More than half that time has already passed. Yet, we are no closer to wiring up the control turret than we were then. The turret baffles us.\" Sherikov grinned ironically. \"Even _I_ have tried my hand at the wiring, but with no success. It's intricate--and small. Too many technical bugs not worked out. We are building only one, you understand. If we had many experimental models worked out before--\"  \"But this is the experimental model,\" Cole said.  \"And built from the designs of a man dead four years--who isn't here to correct us. We've made Icarus with our own hands, down here in the labs. And he's giving us plenty of trouble.\" All at once Sherikov got to his feet. \"Let's go down to the lab and look at him.\"  They descended to the floor below, Sherikov leading the way. Cole stopped short at the lab door.  \"Quite a sight,\" Sherikov agreed. \"We keep him down here at the bottom for safety's sake. He's well protected. Come on in. We have work to do.\"  In the center of the lab Icarus rose up, the gray squat cylinder that someday would flash through space at a speed of thousands of times that of light, toward the heart of Proxima Centaurus, over four light years away. Around the cylinder groups of men in uniform were laboring feverishly to finish the remaining work.  \"Over here. The turret.\" Sherikov led Cole over to one side of the room. \"It's guarded. Centauran spies are swarming everywhere on Terra. They see into everything. But so do we. That's how we get information for the SRB machines. Spies in both systems.\"  The translucent globe that was the control turret reposed in the center of a metal stand, an armed guard standing at each side. They lowered their guns as Sherikov approached.  \"We don't want anything to happen to this,\" Sherikov said. \"Everything depends on it.\" He put out his hand for the globe. Half way to it his hand stopped, striking against an invisible presence in the air.  Sherikov laughed. \"The wall. Shut it off. It's still on.\"  One of the guards pressed a stud at his wrist. Around the globe the air shimmered and faded.  \"Now.\" Sherikov's hand closed over the globe. He lifted it carefully from its mount and brought it out for Cole to see. \"This is the control turret for our enormous friend here. This is what will slow him down when he's inside Centaurus. He slows down and re-enters this universe. Right in the heart of the star. Then--no more Centaurus.\" Sherikov beamed. \"And no more Armun.\"  But Cole was not listening. He had taken the globe from Sherikov and was turning it over and over, running his hands over it, his face close to its surface. He peered down into its interior, his face rapt and intent.  \"You can't see the wiring. Not without lenses.\" Sherikov signalled for a pair of micro-lenses to be brought. He fitted them on Cole's nose, hooking them behind his ears. \"Now try it. You can control the magnification. It's set for 1000X right now. You can increase or decrease it.\"  Cole gasped, swaying back and forth. Sherikov caught hold of him. Cole gazed down into the globe, moving his head slightly, focussing the glasses.  \"It takes practice. But you can do a lot with them. Permits you to do microscopic wiring. There are tools to go along, you understand.\" Sherikov paused, licking his lip. \"We can't get it done correctly. Only a few men can wire circuits using the micro-lenses and the little tools. We've tried robots, but there are too many decisions to be made. Robots can't make decisions. They just react.\"  Cole said nothing. He continued to gaze into the interior of the globe, his lips tight, his body taut and rigid. It made Sherikov feel strangely uneasy.  \"You look like one of those old fortune tellers,\" Sherikov said jokingly, but a cold shiver crawled up his spine. \"Better hand it back to me.\" He held out his hand.  Slowly, Cole returned the globe. After a time he removed the micro-lenses, still deep in thought.  \"Well?\" Sherikov demanded. \"You know what I want. I want you to wire this damn thing up.\" Sherikov came close to Cole, his big face hard. \"You can do it, I think. I could tell by the way you held it--and the job you did on the children's toy, of course. You could wire it up right, and in five days. Nobody else can. And if it's not wired up Centaurus will keep on running the galaxy and Terra will have to sweat it out here in the Sol system. One tiny mediocre sun, one dust mote out of a whole galaxy.\"  Cole did not answer.  Sherikov became impatient. \"Well? What do you say?\"  \"What happens if I don't wire this control for you? I mean, what happens to _me_?\"  \"Then I turn you over to Reinhart. Reinhart will kill you instantly. He thinks you're dead, killed when the Albertine Range was annihilated. If he had any idea I had saved you--\"  \"I see.\"  \"I brought you down here for one thing. If you wire it up I'll have you sent back to your own time continuum. If you don't--\"  Cole considered, his face dark and brooding.  \"What do you have to lose? You'd already be dead, if we hadn't pulled you out of those hills.\"  \"Can you really return me to my own time?\"  \"Of course!\"  \"Reinhart won't interfere?\"  Sherikov laughed. \"What can he do? How can he stop me? I have my own men. You saw them. They landed all around you. You'll be returned.\"  \"Yes. I saw your men.\"  \"Then you agree?\"  \"I agree,\" Thomas"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32159"],["title","Mammals from Southeastern Alaska (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                               Mammals from Southeastern Alaska                                      BY                              ROLLIN H.

BAKER and JAMES S. FINDLEY     The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History received from J. R. Alcorn and Albert A. Alcorn a sizable collection of mammals taken in the summer of 1951 in Alaska. In addition to visiting localities at which they had collected in 1947 and 1948 (see Baker, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:87-117, 1951) the Alcorns obtained specimens from localities not previously visited in the vicinity of Anchorage and Haines and from Sullivan Island, a small, timbered island in the Lynn Canal. A part of the funds for field work was made available by the Kansas University Endowment Association. The loan of specimens for comparative study from the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum is acknowledged.  =_Sorex obscurus alascensis_= Merriam. Dusky Shrew.--Comparison of two specimens from 7 miles SSE Haines and eight from Sullivan Island (six from the northeast end of the island and two from the southeast end) with topotypes of _Sorex obscurus longicauda_ Merriam from Wrangell, Alaska, and with topotypes of _Sorex obscurus alascensis_ from Yakutat, Alaska, shows that our specimens are intermediate between the two named kinds. However in nine of ten characters these specimens more closely resemble _S. o. alascensis_ than _S. o. longicauda_. Measurements of specimens from Wrangell and from localities progressively northward along the Alaskan coast reveal a decrease in size of the skull in a clinal fashion. Specimens from Sullivan Island are larger than those from the mainland south of Haines, which are in turn larger than specimens from 9 miles W and 4 miles N of Haines (reported upon by Baker, _op. cit._). No step is apparent in this cline and assignment of specimens must be made on a somewhat arbitrary basis. Specimens from Juneau, Alaska, in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum, were assigned by Jackson (N. Amer. Fauna, 51: 128, 1928) to _S. o. alascensis_ but seem to us to be closer to _S. o. longicauda_.  =_Sorex palustris navigator_= (Baird). Water Shrew.--Two males taken on August 5, at Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage provide a northwestern extension of the known range of this species. In external and cranial characters the males resemble _S. p. navigator_ from 9 miles W and 4 miles N of Haines, Alaska, and from Washington County, Idaho. The specimens from Peters Creek do not agree with the description of _Sorex alaskanus_ Merriam as given by Jackson (_op. cit._:189) although one, a second year animal, has the lambdoidal crests exceptionally well developed, as does _S. alaskanus_.  =_Myotis lucifugus lucifugus_= (LeConte). Little Brown Myotis.--A male taken at Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage, is darker than specimens assigned to this subspecies from northeastern British Columbia (Muncho Lake). Eight skins and skulls (three adults and five young of the year) and 18 specimens in alcohol taken at Screw Creek, elevation 2600 ft., mile 742 (10 miles S and 50 miles E Teslin, Yukon Territory), British Columbia, seem typical of _M. l. lucifugus_. These were obtained on August 11, 1951, at the same locality where on July 1, 1947, a single bat assigned to _M. l. alascensis_ Miller was taken (see Baker, _op. cit._:95). The latter specimen is readily distinguished by its darker color both above and below from those taken in 1951.  =_Tamiasciurus hudsonicus kenaiensis_= Howell. Red Squirrel.--A female taken at Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage, is referred to this subspecies after comparison with the published description of _T. h. kenaiensis_ Howell (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 49:136, 1936), with specimens of _T. h. preblei_ Howell from Yerrick Creek, Alaska, and with _T. h. petulans_ (Osgood) from 1 mile S of Haines.  =_Tamiasciurus hudsonicus petulans_= (Osgood). Red Squirrel.--Three specimens were taken on Chilkat Peninsula, elevation 10 ft., 7 miles SSE of Haines, Alaska, and one at the southeast end of Sullivan Island. These squirrels, taken in June and July, are molting on the sides, back and rump. Compared with the specimens from the mainland the male from Sullivan Island is paler on the back--near (_h_) Ochraceous-Tawny instead of near (14_j_) Sudan Brown (capitalized color terms from Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912)--and paler on the tail; otherwise this specimen resembles those from the mainland.  =_Peromyscus maniculatus algidus_= Osgood. Deer Mouse.--Osgood (N. Amer. Fauna, 28:54, 1909) reported intergradation between _P. m. algidus_ and _P. m. hylaeus_ Osgood in the \"region of Lynn Canal.\" One female from the mouth of the Endicott River, elevation 10 ft., seems referable to _algidus_. In comparison with two topotypes of _hylaeus_ this specimen is not so dark and more nearly agrees with _algidus_ from the Chilkat River, from 1 mile W of Haines and from Dezadeash Lake, Yukon Territory.  =_Phenacomys intermedius mackenzii_= Preble. Mountain Phenacomys.--An adult female was taken on 28 July at the southwestern end of Dezadeash Lake, elevation 2400 ft., in Yukon Territory (approximately 60 miles from the Alaskan boundary north of the Lynn Canal), the same place where a specimen was obtained in 1948 (see Baker, _op. cit._:104).  =_Microtus longicaudus littoralis_= Swarth. Long-tailed Vole.--Six of these voles were taken on Sullivan Island (two at the northeast end and four at the southeast end) and another was trapped on the mainland at the mouth of the Endicott River. All seven resemble _M. l. littoralis_ from the vicinity of Haines. One large adult male from the island has the following measurements: Total length, 202; length of tail, 71; length of hind foot, 21; height of ear from notch, 13.  =_Microtus oeconomus macfarlani_= Merriam. Tundra Vole.--Five specimens from 5 miles NNE of Gulkana, Alaska, 1700 ft., and four from Peters Creek, elevation 300 ft., 20 miles NE of Anchorage, Alaska, are assigned to this subspecies. In color they resemble _macfarlani_ from eastern Alaska (14 miles E and 25 miles N of Fairbanks) and are darker than _M. o. operarius_ (Nelson) from Tyonek, but judging from the description by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 17:41, 1900), are not so dark as _M. o. yakutatensis_ Merriam. These mice were taken inland from the coast. It is likely that the coastal population more nearly resembles either _operarius_ or _yakutatensis_.  =_Erethizon dorsatum myops_= Merriam. Porcupine.--Skulls of two females obtained from the Chilkat Peninsula, elevation 10 ft., 7 miles SSE of Haines, Alaska, agree with those of the same sex of _myops_ from Yerrick Creek, Alaska, and from 2 miles W of the Teslin River, Yukon Territory. The skull of the older animal has the longer nasals and more pronounced cranial ridges, which perhaps indicate a tendency toward _E. d. nigrescens_ Allen, which occurs to the southward (see Anderson, Canadian Jour. Res., 21:304, 1943).  _Transmitted October 8, 1953._"]]]
