It throws us off, out of kilter. And with the war....  \"Now I'm beginning to understand why the SRB machines couldn't factor him. It's impossible for us to understand this kind of person. Winslow says he asked for work, any kind of work. The man said he could do anything, fix anything. Do you understand what that means?\"  \"No,\" Dixon said. \"What does it mean?\"  \"Can any of us fix anything? No. None of us can do that. We're specialized. Each of us has his own line, his own work. I understand my work, you understand yours. The tendency in evolution is toward greater and greater specialization. Man's society is an ecology that forces adaptation to it. Continual complexity makes it impossible for any of us to know anything outside our own personal field--I can't follow the work of the man sitting at the next desk over from me. Too much knowledge has piled up in each field. And there's too many fields.  \"This man is different. He can fix anything, do anything. He doesn't work with knowledge, with science--the classified accumulation of facts. He _knows_ nothing. It's not in his head, a form of learning. He works by intuition--his power is in his hands, not his head. Jack-of-all-trades. His hands! Like a painter, an artist. In his hands--and he cuts across our lives like a knife-blade.\"  \"And the other problem?\"  \"The other problem is that this man, this variable man, has escaped into the Albertine Mountain range. Now we'll have one hell of a time finding him. He's clever--in a strange kind of way. Like some sort of animal. He's going to be hard to catch.\"  Reinhart sent Dixon out. After a moment he gathered up the handful of reports on his desk and carried them up to the SRB room. The SRB room was closed up, sealed off by a ring of armed Security police. Standing angrily before the ring of police was Peter Sherikov, his beard waggling angrily, his immense hands on his hips.  \"What's going on?\" Sherikov demanded. \"Why can't I go in and peep at the odds?\"  \"Sorry.\" Reinhart cleared the police aside. \"Come inside with me. I'll explain.\" The doors opened for them and they entered. Behind them the doors shut and the ring of police formed outside. \"What brings you away from your lab?\" Reinhart asked.  Sherikov shrugged. \"Several things. I wanted to see you. I called you on the vidphone and they said you weren't available. I thought maybe something had happened. What's up?\"  \"I'll tell you in a few minutes.\" Reinhart called Kaplan over. \"Here are some new items. Feed them in right away. I want to see if the machines can total them.\"  \"Certainly, Commissioner.\" Kaplan took the message plates and placed them on an intake belt. The machines hummed into life.  \"We'll know soon,\" Reinhart said, half aloud.  Sherikov shot him a keen glance. \"We'll know what? Let me in on it. What's taking place?\"  \"We're in trouble. For twenty-four hours the machines haven't given any reading at all. Nothing but a blank. A total blank.\"  Sherikov's features registered disbelief. \"But that isn't possible. _Some_ odds exist at all times.\"  \"The odds exist, but the machines aren't able to calculate them.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because a variable factor has been introduced. A factor which the machines can't handle. They can't make any predictions from it.\"  \"Can't they reject it?\" Sherikov said slyly. \"Can't they just--just _ignore_ it?\"  \"No. It exists, as real data. Therefore it affects the balance of the material, the sum total of all other available data. To reject it would be to give a false reading. The machines can't reject any data that's known to be true.\"  Sherikov pulled moodily at his black beard. \"I would be interested in knowing what sort of factor the machines can't handle. I thought they could take in all data pertaining to contemporary reality.\"  \"They can. This factor has nothing to do with contemporary reality. That's the trouble. Histo-research in bringing its time bubble back from the past got overzealous and cut the circuit too quickly. The bubble came back loaded--with a man from the twentieth century. A man from the past.\"  \"I see. A man from two centuries ago.\" The big Pole frowned. \"And with a radically different Weltanschauung. No connection with our present society. Not integrated along our lines at all. Therefore the SRB machines are perplexed.\"  Reinhart grinned. \"Perplexed? I suppose so. In any case, they can't do anything with the data about this man. The variable man. No statistics at all have been thrown up--no predictions have been made. And it knocks everything else out of phase. We're dependent on the constant showing of these odds. The whole war effort is geared around them.\"  \"The horse-shoe nail. Remember the old poem? 'For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of the shoe the horse was lost. For want of the horse the rider was lost. For want--'\"  \"Exactly. A single factor coming along like this, one single individual, can throw everything off. It doesn't seem possible that one person could knock an entire society out of balance--but apparently it is.\"  \"What are you doing about this man?\"  \"The Security police are organized in a mass search for him.\"  \"Results?\"  \"He escaped into the Albertine Mountain Range last night. It'll be hard to find him. We must expect him to be loose for another forty-eight hours. It'll take that long for us to arrange the annihilation of the range area. Perhaps a trifle longer. And meanwhile--\"  \"Ready, Commissioner,\" Kaplan interrupted. \"The new totals.\"  The SRB machines had finished factoring the new data. Reinhart and Sherikov hurried to take their places before the view windows.  For a moment nothing happened. Then odds were put up, locking in place.  Sherikov gasped. 99-2. In favor of Terra. \"That's wonderful! Now we--\"  The odds vanished. New odds took their places. 97-4. In favor of Centaurus. Sherikov groaned in astonished dismay. \"Wait,\" Reinhart said to him. \"I don't think they'll last.\"  The odds vanished. A rapid series of odds shot across the screen, a violent stream of numbers, changing almost instantly. At last the machines became silent.  Nothing showed. No odds. No totals at all. The view windows were blank.  \"You see?\" Reinhart murmured. \"The same damn thing!\"  Sherikov pondered. \"Reinhart, you're too Anglo-Saxon, too impulsive. Be more Slavic. This man will be captured and destroyed within two days. You said so yourself. Meanwhile, we're all working night and day on the war effort. The warfleet is waiting near Proxima, taking up positions for the attack on the Centaurans. All our war plants are going full blast. By the time the attack date comes we'll have a full-sized invasion army ready to take off for the long trip to the Centauran colonies. The whole Terran population has been mobilized. The eight supply planets are pouring in material. All this is going on day and night, even without odds showing. Long before the attack comes this man will certainly be dead, and the machines will be able to show odds again.\"  Reinhart considered. \"But it worries me, a man like that out in the open. Loose. A man who can't be predicted. It goes against science. We've been making statistical reports on society for two centuries. We have immense files of data. The machines are able to predict what each person and group will do at a given time, in a given situation. But this man is beyond all prediction. He's a variable. It's contrary to science.\"  \"The indeterminate particle.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"The particle that moves in such a way that we can't predict what position it will occupy at a given second. Random. The random particle.\"  \"Exactly. It's--it's _unnatural_.\"  Sherikov laughed sarcastically. \"Don't worry about it, Commissioner. The man will be captured and things will return to their natural state. You'll be able to predict people again, like laboratory rats in a maze. By the way--why is this room guarded?\"  \"I don't want anyone to know the machines show no totals. It's dangerous to the war effort.\"  \"Margaret Duffe, for example?\"  Reinhart nodded reluctantly. \"They're too timid, these parliamentarians. If they discover we have no SRB odds they'll want to shut down the war planning and go back to waiting.\"  \"Too slow for you, Commissioner? Laws, debates, council meetings, discussions.... Saves a lot of time if one man has all the power. One man to tell people what to do, think for them, lead them around.\"  Reinhart eyed the big Pole critically. \"That reminds me. How is Icarus coming? Have you continued to make progress on the control turret?\"  A scowl crossed Sherikov's broad features. \"The control turret?\" He waved his big hand vaguely. \"I would say it's coming along all right. We'll catch up in time.\"  Instantly Reinhart became alert. \"Catch up? You mean you're still behind?\"  \"Somewhat. A little. But we'll catch up.\" Sherikov retreated toward the door. \"Let's go down to the cafeteria and have a cup of coffee. You worry too much, Commissioner. Take things more in your stride.\"  \"I suppose you're right.\" The two men walked out into the hall. \"I'm on edge. This variable man. I can't get him out of my mind.\"  \"Has he done anything yet?\"  \"Nothing important. Rewired a child's toy. A toy vidsender.\"  \"Oh?\" Sherikov showed interest. \"What do you mean? What did he do?\"  \"I'll show you.\" Reinhart led Sherikov down the hall to his office. They entered and Reinhart locked the door. He handed Sherikov the toy and roughed in what Cole had done. A strange look crossed Sherikov's face. He found the studs on the box and depressed them. The box opened. The big Pole sat down at the desk and began to study the interior of the box. \"You're sure it was the man from the past who rewired this?\"  \"Of course. On the spot. The boy damaged it playing. The variable man came along and the boy asked him to fix it. He fixed it, all right.\"  \"Incredible.\" Sherikov's eyes were only an inch from the wiring. \"S"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32154"],["title","The Variable Man (#7)"],["body","tiny relays. How could he--\"  \"What?\"  \"Nothing.\" Sherikov got abruptly to his feet, closing the box carefully. \"Can I take this along? To my lab? I'd like to analyze it more fully.\"  \"Of course. But why?\"  \"No special reason. Let's go get our coffee.\" Sherikov headed toward the door. \"You say you expect to capture this man in a day or so?\"  \"_Kill_ him, not capture him. We've got to eliminate him as a piece of data. We're assembling the attack formations right now. No slip-ups, this time. We're in the process of setting up a cross-bombing pattern to level the entire Albertine range. He must be destroyed, within the next forty-eight hours.\"  Sherikov nodded absently. \"Of course,\" he murmured. A preoccupied expression still remained on his broad features. \"I understand perfectly.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Thomas Cole crouched over the fire he had built, warming his hands. It was almost morning. The sky was turning violet gray. The mountain air was crisp and chill. Cole shivered and pulled himself closer to the fire.  The heat felt good against his hands. _His hands._ He gazed down at them, glowing yellow-red in the firelight. The nails were black and chipped. Warts and endless calluses on each finger, and the palms. But they were good hands; the fingers were long and tapered. He respected them, although in some ways he didn't understand them.  Cole was deep in thought, meditating over his situation. He had been in the mountains two nights and a day. The first night had been the worst. Stumbling and falling, making his way uncertainly up the steep slopes, through the tangled brush and undergrowth--  But when the sun came up he was safe, deep in the mountains, between two great peaks. And by the time the sun had set again he had fixed himself up a shelter and a means of making a fire. Now he had a neat little box trap, operated by a plaited grass rope and pit, a notched stake. One rabbit already hung by his hind legs and the trap was waiting for another.  The sky turned from violet gray to a deep cold gray, a metallic color. The mountains were silent and empty. Far off some place a bird sang, its voice echoing across the vast slopes and ravines. Other birds began to sing. Off to his right something crashed through the brush, an animal pushing its way along.  Day was coming. His second day. Cole got to his feet and began to unfasten the rabbit. Time to eat. And then? After that he had no plans. He knew instinctively that he could keep himself alive indefinitely with the tools he had retained, and the genius of his hands. He could kill game and skin it. Eventually he could build himself a permanent shelter, even make clothes out of hides. In winter--  But he was not thinking that far ahead. Cole stood by the fire, staring up at the sky, his hands on his hips. He squinted, suddenly tense. Something was moving. Something in the sky, drifting slowly through the grayness. A black dot.  He stamped out the fire quickly. What was it? He strained, trying to see. A bird?  A second dot joined the first. Two dots. Then three. Four. Five. A fleet of them, moving rapidly across the early morning sky. Toward the mountains.  Toward him.  Cole hurried away from the fire. He snatched up the rabbit and carried it along with him, into the tangled shelter he had built. He was invisible, inside the shelter. No one could find him. But if they had seen the fire--  He crouched in the shelter, watching the dots grow larger. They were planes, all right. Black wingless planes, coming closer each moment. Now he could hear them, a faint dull buzz, increasing until the ground shook under him.  The first plane dived. It dropped like a stone, swelling into a great black shape. Cole gasped, sinking down. The plane roared in an arc, swooping low over the ground. Suddenly bundles tumbled out, white bundles falling and scattering like seeds.  The bundles drifted rapidly to the ground. They landed. They were men. Men in uniform.  Now the second plane was diving. It roared overhead, releasing its load. More bundles tumbled out, filling the sky. The third plane dived, then the fourth. The air was thick with drifting bundles of white, a blanket of descending weed spores, settling to earth.  On the ground the soldiers were forming into groups. Their shouts carried to Cole, crouched in his shelter. Fear leaped through him. They were landing on all sides of him. He was cut off. The last two planes had dropped men behind him.  He got to his feet, pushing out of the shelter. Some of the soldiers had found the fire, the ashes and coals. One dropped down, feeling the coals with his hand. He waved to the others. They were circling all around, shouting and gesturing. One of them began to set up some kind of gun. Others were unrolling coils of tubing, locking a collection of strange pipes and machinery in place.  Cole ran. He rolled down a slope, sliding and falling. At the bottom he leaped to his feet and plunged into the brush. Vines and leaves tore at his face, slashing and cutting him. He fell again, tangled in a mass of twisted shrubbery. He fought desperately, trying to free himself. If he could reach the knife in his pocket--  Voices. Footsteps. Men were behind him, running down the slope. Cole struggled frantically, gasping and twisting, trying to pull loose. He strained, breaking the vines, clawing at them with his hands.  A soldier dropped to his knee, leveling his gun. More soldiers arrived, bringing up their rifles and aiming.  Cole cried out. He closed his eyes, his body suddenly limp. He waited, his teeth locked together, sweat dripping down his neck, into his shirt, sagging against the mesh of vines and branches coiled around him.  Silence.  Cole opened his eyes slowly. The soldiers had regrouped. A huge man was striding down the slope toward them, barking orders as he came.  Two soldiers stepped into the brush. One of them grabbed Cole by the shoulder.  \"Don't let go of him.\" The huge man came over, his black beard jutting out. \"Hold on.\"  Cole gasped for breath. He was caught. There was nothing he could do. More soldiers were pouring down into the gulley, surrounding him on all sides. They studied him curiously, murmuring together. Cole shook his head wearily and said nothing.  The huge man with the beard stood directly in front of him, his hands on his hips, looking him up and down. \"Don't try to get away,\" the man said. \"You can't get away. Do you understand?\"  Cole nodded.  \"All right. Good.\" The man waved. Soldiers clamped metal bands around Cole's arms and wrists. The metal dug into his flesh, making him gasp with pain. More clamps locked around his legs. \"Those stay there until we're out of here. A long way out.\"  \"Where--where are you taking me?\"  Peter Sherikov studied the variable man for a moment before he answered. \"Where? I'm taking you to my labs. Under the Urals.\" He glanced suddenly up at the sky. \"We better hurry. The Security police will be starting their demolition attack in a few hours. We want to be a long way from here when that begins.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sherikov settled down in his comfortable reinforced chair with a sigh. \"It's good to be back.\" He signalled to one of his guards. \"All right. You can unfasten him.\"  The metal clamps were removed from Cole's arms and legs. He sagged, sinking down in a heap. Sherikov watched him silently.  Cole sat on the floor, rubbing his wrists and legs, saying nothing.  \"What do you want?\" Sherikov demanded. \"Food? Are you hungry?\"  \"No.\"  \"Medicine? Are you sick? Injured?\"  \"No.\"  Sherikov wrinkled his nose. \"A bath wouldn't hurt you any. We'll arrange that later.\" He lit a cigar, blowing a cloud of gray smoke around him. At the door of the room two lab guards stood with guns ready. No one else was in the room beside Sherikov and Cole.  Thomas Cole sat huddled in a heap on the floor, his head sunk down against his chest. He did not stir. His bent body seemed more elongated and stooped than ever, his hair tousled and unkempt, his chin and jowls a rough stubbled gray. His clothes were dirty and torn from crawling through the brush. His skin was cut and scratched; open sores dotted his neck and cheeks and forehead. He said nothing. His chest rose and fell. His faded blue eyes were almost closed. He looked quite old, a withered, dried-up old man.  Sherikov waved one of the guards over. \"Have a doctor brought up here. I want this man checked over. He may need intravenous injections. He may not have had anything to eat for awhile.\"  The guard departed.  \"I don't want anything to happen to you,\" Sherikov said. \"Before we go on I'll have you checked over. And deloused at the same time.\"  Cole said nothing.  Sherikov laughed. \"Buck up! You have no reason to feel bad.\" He leaned toward Cole, jabbing an immense finger at him. \"Another two hours and you'd have been dead, out there in the mountains. You know that?\"  Cole nodded.  \"You don't believe me. Look.\" Sherikov leaned over and snapped on the vidscreen mounted in the wall. \"Watch, this. The operation should still be going on.\"  The screen lit up. A scene gained form.  \"This is a confidential Security channel. I had it tapped several years ago--for my own protection. What we're seeing now is being piped in to Eric Reinhart.\" Sherikov grinned. \"Reinhart arranged what you're seeing on the screen. Pay close attention. You were there, two hours ago.\"  Cole turned toward the screen. At first he could not make out what was happening. The screen showed a vast foaming cloud, a vortex of motion. From the speaker came a low rumble, a deep-throated roar. After a time the screen shifted, showing a slightly different view. Suddenly Cole stiffened.  He was seeing the destruction of a whole mountain range.  The picture was coming from a ship, flying above what had once been the Albertine Mountain Range. Now there was nothing but swirling clouds of gray and columns of particles and debris, a surging tide of"]]]
