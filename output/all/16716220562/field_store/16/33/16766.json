C._]     CHAPTER I—A TALE OF A LION RAMPANT   It was in the month of May 1813 that I was so unlucky as to fall at last into the hands of the enemy.  My knowledge of the English language had marked me out for a certain employment.  Though I cannot conceive a soldier refusing to incur the risk, yet to be hanged for a spy is a disgusting business; and I was relieved to be held a prisoner of war. Into the Castle of Edinburgh, standing in the midst of that city on the summit of an extraordinary rock, I was cast with several hundred fellow-sufferers, all privates like myself, and the more part of them, by an accident, very ignorant, plain fellows.  My English, which had brought me into that scrape, now helped me very materially to bear it.  I had a thousand advantages.  I was often called to play the part of an interpreter, whether of orders or complaints, and thus brought in relations, sometimes of mirth, sometimes almost of friendship, with the officers in charge.  A young lieutenant singled me out to be his adversary at chess, a game in which I was extremely proficient, and would reward me for my gambits with excellent cigars.  The major of the battalion took lessons of French from me while at breakfast, and was sometimes so obliging as to have me join him at the meal.  Chevenix was his name.  He was stiff as a drum-major and selfish as an Englishman, but a fairly conscientious pupil and a fairly upright man.  Little did I suppose that his ramrod body and frozen face would, in the end, step in between me and all my dearest wishes; that upon this precise, regular, icy soldier-man my fortunes should so nearly shipwreck!  I never liked, but yet I trusted him; and though it may seem but a trifle, I found his snuff-box with the bean in it come very welcome.  For it is strange how grown men and seasoned soldiers can go back in life; so that after but a little while in prison, which is after all the next thing to being in the nursery, they grow absorbed in the most pitiful, childish interests, and a sugar biscuit or a pinch of snuff become things to follow after and scheme for!  We made but a poor show of prisoners.  The officers had been all offered their parole, and had taken it.  They lived mostly in suburbs of the city, lodging with modest families, and enjoyed their freedom and supported the almost continual evil tidings of the Emperor as best they might.  It chanced I was the only gentleman among the privates who remained.  A great part were ignorant Italians, of a regiment that had suffered heavily in Catalonia.  The rest were mere diggers of the soil, treaders of grapes or hewers of wood, who had been suddenly and violently preferred to the glorious state of soldiers.  We had but the one interest in common: each of us who had any skill with his fingers passed the hours of his captivity in the making of little toys and _articles of Paris_; and the prison was daily visited at certain hours by a concourse of people of the country, come to exult over our distress, or—it is more tolerant to suppose—their own vicarious triumph.  Some moved among us with a decency of shame or sympathy.  Others were the most offensive personages in the world, gaped at us as if we had been baboons, sought to evangelise us to their rustic, northern religion, as though we had been savages, or tortured us with intelligence of disasters to the arms of France.  Good, bad, and indifferent, there was one alleviation to the annoyance of these visitors; for it was the practice of almost all to purchase some specimen of our rude handiwork.  This led, amongst the prisoners, to a strong spirit of competition.  Some were neat of hand, and (the genius of the French being always distinguished) could place upon sale little miracles of dexterity and taste.  Some had a more engaging appearance; fine features were found to do as well as fine merchandise, and an air of youth in particular (as it appealed to the sentiment of pity in our visitors) to be a source of profit.  Others again enjoyed some acquaintance with the language, and were able to recommend the more agreeably to purchasers such trifles as they had to sell.  To the first of these advantages I could lay no claim, for my fingers were all thumbs.  Some at least of the others I possessed; and finding much entertainment in our commerce, I did not suffer my advantages to rust.  I have never despised the social arts, in which it is a national boast that every Frenchman should excel.  For the approach of particular sorts of visitors, I had a particular manner of address, and even of appearance, which I could readily assume and change on the occasion rising.  I never lost an opportunity to flatter either the person of my visitor, if it should be a lady, or, if it should be a man, the greatness of his country in war.  And in case my compliments should miss their aim, I was always ready to cover my retreat with some agreeable pleasantry, which would often earn me the name of an ‘oddity’ or a ‘droll fellow.’  In this way, although I was so left-handed a toy-maker, I made out to be rather a successful merchant; and found means to procure many little delicacies and alleviations, such as children or prisoners desire.  I am scarcely drawing the portrait of a very melancholy man.  It is not indeed my character; and I had, in a comparison with my comrades, many reasons for content.  In the first place, I had no family: I was an orphan and a bachelor; neither wife nor child awaited me in France.  In the second, I had never wholly forgot the emotions with which I first found myself a prisoner; and although a military prison be not altogether a garden of delights, it is still preferable to a gallows.  In the third, I am almost ashamed to say it, but I found a certain pleasure in our place of residence: being an obsolete and really mediaeval fortress, high placed and commanding extraordinary prospects, not only over sea, mountain, and champaign but actually over the thoroughfares of a capital city, which we could see blackened by day with the moving crowd of the inhabitants, and at night shining with lamps.  And lastly, although I was not insensible to the restraints of prison or the scantiness of our rations, I remembered I had sometimes eaten quite as ill in Spain, and had to mount guard and march perhaps a dozen leagues into the bargain. The first of my troubles, indeed, was the costume we were obliged to wear.  There is a horrible practice in England to trick out in ridiculous uniforms, and as it were to brand in mass, not only convicts but military prisoners, and even the children in charity schools.  I think some malignant genius had found his masterpiece of irony in the dress which we were condemned to wear: jacket, waistcoat, and trousers of a sulphur or mustard yellow, and a shirt or blue-and-white striped cotton.  It was conspicuous, it was cheap, it pointed us out to laughter—we, who were old soldiers, used to arms, and some of us showing noble scars,—like a set of lugubrious zanies at a fair.  The old name of that rock on which our prison stood was (I have heard since then) the _Painted Hill_.  Well, now it was all painted a bright yellow with our costumes; and the dress of the soldiers who guarded us being of course the essential British red rag, we made up together the elements of a lively picture of hell.  I have again and again looked round upon my fellow-prisoners, and felt my anger rise, and choked upon tears, to behold them thus parodied.  The more part, as I have said, were peasants, somewhat bettered perhaps by the drill-sergeant, but for all that ungainly, loutish fellows, with no more than a mere barrack-room smartness of address: indeed, you could have seen our army nowhere more discreditably represented than in this Castle of Edinburgh.  And I used to see myself in fancy, and blush.  It seemed that my more elegant carriage would but point the insult of the travesty.  And I remembered the days when I wore the coarse but honourable coat of a soldier; and remembered further back how many of the noble, the fair, and the gracious had taken a delight to tend my childhood. . . .  But I must not recall these tender and sorrowful memories twice; their place is further on, and I am now upon another business.  The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/322"],["title","St. Ives: Being the Adventures of a French Prisoner in England (#1)"],["body"," of the Britannic Government stood nowhere more openly confessed than in one particular of our discipline: that we were shaved twice in the week.  To a man who has loved all his life to be fresh shaven, can a more irritating indignity be devised?  Monday and Thursday were the days.  Take the Thursday, and conceive the picture I must present by Sunday evening!  And Saturday, which was almost as bad, was the great day for visitors.  Those who came to our market were of all qualities, men and women, the lean and the stout, the plain and the fairly pretty.  Sure, if people at all understood the power of beauty, there would be no prayers addressed except to Venus; and the mere privilege of beholding a comely woman is worth paying for.  Our visitors, upon the whole, were not much to boast of; and yet, sitting in a corner and very much ashamed of myself and my absurd appearance, I have again and again tasted the finest, the rarest, and the most ethereal pleasures in a glance of an eye that I should never see again—and never wanted to.  The flower of the hedgerow and the star in heaven satisfy and delight us: how much more the look of that exquisite being who was created to bear and rear, to madden and rejoice, mankind!  There was one young lady in particular, about eighteen or nineteen, tall, of a gallant carriage, and with a profusion of hair in which the sun found threads of gold.  As soon as she came in the courtyard (and she was a rather frequent visitor) it seemed I was aware of it.  She had an air of angelic candour, yet of a high spirit; she stepped like a Diana, every movement was noble and free.  One day there was a strong east wind; the banner was straining at the flagstaff; below us the smoke of the city chimneys blew hither and thither in a thousand crazy variations; and away out on the Forth we could see the ships lying down to it and scudding.  I was thinking what a vile day it was, when she appeared.  Her hair blew in the wind with changes of colour; her garments moulded her with the accuracy of sculpture; the ends of her shawl fluttered about her ear and were caught in again with an inimitable deftness.  You have seen a pool on a gusty day, how it suddenly sparkles and flashes like a thing alive? So this lady’s face had become animated and coloured; and as I saw her standing, somewhat inclined, her lips parted, a divine trouble in her eyes, I could have clapped my hands in applause, and was ready to acclaim her a genuine daughter of the winds.  What put it in my head, I know not: perhaps because it was a Thursday and I was new from the razor; but I determined to engage her attention no later than that day.  She was approaching that part of the court in which I sat with my merchandise, when I observed her handkerchief to escape from her hands and fall to the ground; the next moment the wind had taken it up and carried it within my reach.  I was on foot at once: I had forgot my mustard-coloured clothes, I had forgot the private soldier and his salute.  Bowing deeply, I offered her the slip of cambric.  ‘Madam,’ said I, ‘your handkerchief.  The wind brought it me.’  I met her eyes fully.  ‘I thank you, sir,’ said she.  ‘The wind brought it me,’ I repeated.  ‘May I not take it for an omen? You have an English proverb, “It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good.”’  ‘Well,’ she said, with a smile, ‘“One good turn deserves another.”  I will see what you have.’  She followed me to where my wares were spread out under lee of a piece of cannon.  ‘Alas, mademoiselle!’ said I, ‘I am no very perfect craftsman.  This is supposed to be a house, and you see the chimneys are awry.  You may call this a box if you are very indulgent; but see where my tool slipped! Yes, I am afraid you may go from one to another, and find a flaw in everything.  _Failures for Sale_ should be on my signboard.  I do not keep a shop; I keep a Humorous Museum.’  I cast a smiling glance about my display, and then at her, and instantly became grave.  ‘Strange, is it not,’ I added, ‘that a grown man and a soldier should be engaged upon such trash, and a sad heart produce anything so funny to look at?’  An unpleasant voice summoned her at this moment by the name of Flora, and she made a hasty purchase and rejoined her party.  A few days after she came again.  But I must first tell you how she came to be so frequent.  Her aunt was one of those terrible British old maids, of which the world has heard much; and having nothing whatever to do, and a word or two of French, she had taken what she called an _interest in the French prisoners_.  A big, bustling, bold old lady, she flounced about our market-place with insufferable airs of patronage and condescension.  She bought, indeed, with liberality, but her manner of studying us through a quizzing-glass, and playing cicerone to her followers, acquitted us of any gratitude.  She had a tail behind her of heavy, obsequious old gentlemen, or dull, giggling misses, to whom she appeared to be an oracle.  ‘This one can really carve prettily: is he not a quiz with his big whiskers?’ she would say.  ‘And this one,’ indicating myself with her gold eye-glass, ‘is, I assure you, quite an oddity.’  The oddity, you may be certain, ground his teeth.  She had a way of standing in our midst, nodding around, and addressing us in what she imagined to be French: ‘_Bienne_, _hommes_! _ça va bienne_?’  I took the freedom to reply in the same lingo: _Bienne_, _femme_! _ça va couci-couci tout d’même_, _la bourgeoise_!’  And at that, when we had all laughed with a little more heartiness than was entirely civil, ‘I told you he was quite an oddity!’ says she in triumph.  Needless to say, these passages were before I had remarked the niece.  The aunt came on the day in question with a following rather more than usually large, which she manoeuvred to and fro about the market and lectured to at rather more than usual length, and with rather less than her accustomed tact.  I kept my eyes down, but they were ever fixed in the same direction, quite in vain.  The aunt came and went, and pulled us out, and showed us off, like caged monkeys; but the niece kept herself on the outskirts of the crowd and on the opposite side of the courtyard, and departed at last as she had come, without a sign.  Closely as I had watched her, I could not say her eyes had ever rested on me for an instant; and my heart was overwhelmed with bitterness and blackness.  I tore out her detested image; I felt I was done with her for ever; I laughed at myself savagely, because I had thought to please; when I lay down at night sleep forsook me, and I lay, and rolled, and gloated on her charms, and cursed her insensibility, for half the night.  How trivial I thought her! and how trivial her sex!  A man might be an angel or an Apollo, and a mustard-coloured coat would wholly blind them to his merits.  I was a prisoner, a slave, a contemned and despicable being, the butt of her sniggering countrymen.  I would take the lesson: no proud daughter of my foes should have the chance to mock at me again; none in the future should have the chance to think I had looked at her with admiration.  You cannot imagine any one of a more resolute and independent spirit, or whose bosom was more wholly mailed with patriotic arrogance, than I.  Before I dropped asleep, I had remembered all the infamies of Britain, and debited them in an overwhelming column to Flora.  The next day, as I sat in my place, I became conscious there was some one standing near; and behold, it was herself!  I kept my seat, at first in the confusion of my mind, later on from policy; and she stood, and leaned a little over me, as in pity.  She was very still and timid; her voice was low.  Did I suffer in my captivity? she asked me.  Had I to complain of any hardship?  ‘Mademoiselle, I have not learned to complain,’ said I.  ‘I am a soldier of Napoleon.’  She sighed.  ‘At least you must regret _La France_,’ said she, and coloured a little as she pronounced the words, which she did with a pretty strangeness of accent.  ‘What am I to say?’ I replied.  ‘If you were carried from this country, for which you seem so wholly suited, where the very rains and winds seem to become you like ornaments, would you regret, do you think?  We must surely all regret! the son to his mother, the man to his country; these are native feelings.’  ‘You have a mother?’ she asked.  ‘In heaven, mademoiselle,’ I answered.  ‘She, and my father also, went by the same road to heaven as so many others of the fair and brave: they followed their queen upon the scaffold.  So, you see, I am not so much to be pitied in my prison,’ I continued: ‘there are none to wait for me; I am alone in the world.  ’Tis a different case, for instance, with yon poor fellow in the cloth cap.  His bed is next to mine, and in the night I hear him sobbing to himself.  He has a tender character, full of tender and pretty sentiments; and in the dark at night, and sometimes by day when he can get me apart with him, he laments a mother and a sweetheart. Do you know what made him take me for a confidant?’  She parted her lips with a look, but did not speak.  The look burned all through me with a sudden vital heat.  ‘Because I had once seen, in marching by, the belfry of his village!’ I continued.  ‘The circumstance is quaint enough.  It seems to bind up into one the whole bundle of those human instincts that make life beautiful, and people and places dear—and from which it would seem I am cut off!’  I rested my chin on my knee and looked before me on the ground.  I had been talking until then to hold her; but I was now not sorry she should go: an impression is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow!  Presently she seemed to make an effort.  ‘I will take this toy,’ she said, laid a five-and-sixpenny piece in my hand, and was gone ere I could thank her.  I retired to a place apart near the ramparts and behind a gun.  The beauty, the expression of her eyes, the"]]]
