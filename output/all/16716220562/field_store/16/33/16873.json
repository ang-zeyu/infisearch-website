Good. Tell me, my son, are there many men like you in the world of today? I have a dream, a secret private dream, that the scientists from your world might come here and study the strange things on this island.\"  \"They would come here in droves if they knew about it. And so would everybody else. You would be over-run by hordes of the curious.\"  \"Yes, we know that. That isn't quite what I meant. It was my hope that perhaps we could make this island what it was in the olden days--secret place where the wise men could come to study.\" The priest's face glowed again. \"There is so much here to be learned and here, also, is the time in which to learn. Here great discoveries might be made. Here could possibly be discovered not only the secrets of nature but the secrets of the minds and the hearts of men. From this place, as the centuries passed, there might be fed out, little by little, knowledge that would change the world; knowledge that would change the hearts and the minds of men; knowledge that would eliminate poverty, stop wars, knowledge that would help the human race become what it must one day be.\"  The glow on Rozeno's face was bright. The dream he dreamed was suddenly, in Parker's mind, a living, breathing vital hope, the hope of all honest men everywhere, that tomorrow might be better!  \"Would you, my son, help me achieve that dream? Will you go back through the veil and explain to some of your greatest scientists what we have here?\"  \"I would like nothing better,\" the big pilot answered. In a way, this was his dream too, though up until now it had always been a secret, hidden, impossible-to-accomplish thing. His hand went out to Rozeno. Deep inside of him, the glow grew to greater heights. Only one other thing was needed to make this glow a really perfect feeling, Effra, who had found this island and had tried to tell him about it. But Effra was gone.  They moved on to a big room where some of the scientific equipment of the vanished race still functioned. Set in a sunken pool ten feet in diameter in the center of the room was a circle of what looked like mercury. Leading up from it were heavy bus bars of some unknown metal. The bus bars came together and marched across the room to a control panel, one of the strangest control panels Parker had ever seen. The meters were graduated in colors. In front of the chair where the operator sat was a keyboard like that of a vast pipe organ. How much training would an operator need to operate this keyboard? Directly in front of the operator's seat was a square panel that looked like a television screen.         *       *       *       *       *  Set in niches where the right hand of the operator could reach them easily were statuettes of birds, animals, reptiles. Made of some metal, they were perfect representations. Parker saw a condor, a bald-headed eagle, a humming-bird, a cougar, a jaguar, an alligator. His eyes went back to the pool in the center of the room.  \"It is generating power,\" Rozeno said. \"As it turns, it creates some force, some energy. I do not understand this energy. No one now alive understands it. Understanding is one of the things I hope your scientists may achieve--come away, Ulnar.\" The last was spoken as the Indian strayed near the operator's seat.  Ulnar grunted impatiently. There was something about that seat that lured him. But he came away. They went into another room, leaving behind them the pool of mercury that turned slowly, like a miniature earth on some axis of its own. Parker took one look at the contents of this room, and gasped.  The crown jewels of England were no greater than these! Here were crowns of pounded yellow gold; here were gargoyle masks made of the same yellow metal; masks that sparkled with gems. Here, lying on the rock shelves, were ingots of what looked to be solid gold, each one heavy enough to be a full load for a grown man.  Ulnar was examining a gargoyle mask. He touched a gold bar, his old withered fingers seeming to savor the feel of it.  Rozeno smiled gently. \"Ulnar treasures these things, they were put in his charge a very long time ago. He has been faithful to his trust.\"  \"But--\" Parker whispered.  \"This is a part of Montezuma's treasure, a part that Cortez did not get. There is as much of it here as 400 men could carry away. Ulnar was one of Montezuma's most trusted sub-chiefs. He brought the treasure here, to keep it for his Chieftan.\"  Ulnar's wrinkled face broke into a grin. \"Me take good care,\" he said simply. \"Me clean, me polish, me save for my Chief.\"  \"Tell me one thing?\" he said.  \"Gladly, my son.\"  \"Does Johnny Retch know this is here?\"  \"I suppose so. All who live on our island know about it.\"  Muscles knotted at the corners of Parker's jaws. He pressed his arms down against his jacket so that he could feel the guns in the pockets. The guns felt good.  \"Father Rozeno!\" a voice called from a corridor outside the treasure room. \"Father Rozeno? Where are you?\"  \"Here I am, my dear,\" the priest answered.  At the sound of that voice, Bill Parker forgot all about the guns in his pockets, Johnny Retch, Montezuma's treasure, and everything else that was on this island. He stood stock still, paralyzed.  A girl came through the opening into the treasure room. She wore a dark dress; sandals; her hands were gloved; she had apparently been working at some task. She smiled at Ulnar, glanced at Parker, nodded, looked at Rozeno, smiled, then glanced back quickly at Parker as if he reminded her of someone she had once known, then turned again to the priest. \"Father, I have been cleaning all morning--\"  So far she got. Bill Parker broke his paralysis and swept her into his arms.  \"Effra--Effra--Effra--\" His voice was a choked whisper, almost inaudible in the treasure chamber of Montezuma. As she had come through the door, his mind had given him a flashing picture of the plane wrecked on the shore. Effra, fleeing from Dr. Yammer, had taken one last desperate chance on finding her island; one last lonely flight out over the Pacific. No wonder he had been unable to find her. She had found her island. She had come here. She _was_ here, in his arms.  There was wonder and awe and bewilderment in the big pilot. Here was a miracle almost past the understanding. \"I've found you--Effra--\"  For an instant, she lay in his arms like a frightened child who dared not move. \"Please--\" she whispered. He did not hear her. His lips sought hers, found them. She did not draw away, but neither did she respond. \"Effra--\" Parker looked up. Rozeno and Ulnar were regarding him with mild astonishment. In his arms, Effra stirred again. \"Please--let me go.\"  This time the big pilot heard her. Setting her back on her feet was one of the hastiest movements he had ever made in his life. \"Effra--I did not mean to startle you--but darling--\"  She stood irresolute, staring at him. \"Please--You have no right--\"  He saw that her eyes, fixed on him, regarded him as an utter and complete stranger.  \"Don't you know me, Effra?\" There was almost a sob in his voice.  \"I never saw you before in my life.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Parker turned, moved to a window slot, stood looking out. The trees below him, the island, the sea, the PT boat lying at anchor off shore, he saw all of these things, but yet he did not see them.  He had found Effra and she did not remember him, did not know him. Inside of him was agony, such pain as he had never known. He felt a touch on his arm. Rozeno stood there, his face troubled. \"Do you know our Effra, my son?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you, perhaps, love her?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And you are very unhappy because she does not respond?\"  \"Yes.\"  The old priest's face grew a little more sad. \"When she landed here, the last time, she made an awkward landing. She was thrown forward and she hit her head. She does not remember anything that happened before that.\" Rozeno's finger bit deeply into Parker's arm. \"Come now, and I will introduce you to her, as a stranger.\"  Bill Parker found himself being introduced to the woman he loved. \"I'm sorry about my actions of a minute ago,\" he said. \"I thought you were someone else.\"  The smile she gave him was forgiving but it was also cool and distant. \"That's all right, Mr. Parker. I understand.\" Her voice went into silence as another sound came into the room. The sound of rapid gunfire.  Parker had thought he had in his pocket the only two modern weapons on the island, but somewhere in the growth of trees far below the window slot, someone was firing a sub-machine gun.  Parker raced to the slot. Below him the island lay quiet. He turned. Mercedes, her face working, was staring at him.  \"Beel--Beel--I have not told you everything! That Johnny Retch, he hire you to fly him here in 'copter, to find thees island. He also have men in boat coming. Your job, which you did not know, was to find island, then lead men in boat to it. Johnny means to take all thees.\" The gesture of her hand included all the treasure of Montezuma. \"He have men in boat to help him take it. He does not mean to let anything stop him. Not anything!\"  Parker saw what he had not seen before, that Johnny Retch was a man who would always have two strings for his bow. Too late, he saw that the boat lying at anchor was not an accident.  \"I should have killed that dog when I had the chance!\" he snarled.  Shambling feet sounded in the corridor outside. Pedro burst into the room. He grunted words at Ulnar.  \"Pedro says men come up the ledge,\" Rozeno said. \"They must be from the boat. We must go to meet them. It will be a great pleasure to them. Come, Ulnar. Come, Bill.\" He moved toward the door.  Parker was across the room in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32359"],["title","Sinister Paradise (#6)"],["body","strides, catching Rozeno's arm. \"You can't do it, Father Rozeno. Those men who are coming up the ledge mean to kill.\"  \"My son!\" Hurt showed on the priest's face. \"Surely you do not know what you are talking about!\"  \"But I do know!\" Parker almost shouted the words. Quickly, desperately he tried to explain the situation to Rozeno. To his growing horror, he saw no comprehension in the old priest's eyes. Slowly Parker began to realize that this old man was so gentle and so kind himself that he could not comprehend even the thought of anyone else being--evil!  \"You may stay here, if you wish, my son, but Ulnar and I will go speak to these people who are coming up the ledge. Come, Ulnar.\"  His face glowing at the thought of meeting new people, the priest moved from the room. Ulnar grunted once, a hot, savage sound, then followed Rozeno like a dog following its master.  Effra started to follow them.  Parker caught her arm. \"Please, at least you stay here. Understand me now if you never understood me before. Is there a window slot from which the ledge can be seen?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then take me to it. Quickly!\"         *       *       *       *       *  From the slot, Parker could see a section of the ledge. Two men were crawling along it, advancing as cautiously as scouts trying to surprise an outpost. Parker had never seen either of them before but their faces confirmed everything Mercedes had said--they were thugs, killers. Thrusting the pistol through the slot, the pilot took careful aim, pulled the trigger.  The thunder of the gun rang through the room, echoed across the island. The bullet knocked rock chips into the face of the lead man. He recoiled as if he had been stung. The Tommy-gun in his hand spouted lead blindly at the face of the cliff. The second man spun around--began shooting blindly.  Parker moved away from the slot, listened to the rattle of the guns outside. He could distinguish the heavy thud of the Tommy-gun, the sharper crack of the carbine, but other weapons were also firing. \"They've got men with high-powered rifles posted in the tree down below.\"  He glanced from the slot. The men had disappeared from the ledge. As he moved back, a slug whined into the room. Mercedes cowered against the wall. Effra remained cool and poised. She was looking at Parker. \"Haven't I met you somewhere before?\" She seemed completely unaware of the rifle bullet that had just screamed through the slot.  \"I--\" Parker caught himself. There was agony in him. What good would it do if she did, finally, remember who he was, who she was? What they had once been to each other? He had three old men, and two women, and himself, with which to defend Montezuma's treasure against Johnny Retch, who had a small army of trained killers at his back.  What chance did they have? Johnny Retch, even if given Montezuma's gold, would not leave anyone alive except possibly Mercedes and Effra.  \"Do--do you know anything we can do to stop those men?\" Parker said.  Light seemed to come into Effra's eyes.  \"We might--we might use the Jezbro!\"  From the shelter of the trees, Johnny Retch operated like a general in charge of a force of Commandos engaged in attacking a miniature Gibralter. He was a very deliberate general. When the first shot from a slot in the cliff had driven the two men downward, he met them at the bottom of the ledge, a cigarette dangling from his lips, a sub-machine gun in his hands. \"Okay, boys, go back on up.\"  \"There's a guy in there with a gun,\" one of the two protested. \"He's inside and we're outside. We're sittin' ducks for him.\"  \"We're covering the slots with rifles in the trees.\"  \"But--\" Neither of the men wanted to go up that ledge again. They might be hardened killers but they did not like the idea of facing a gun they could not see.  \"Go on back up, boys,\" Retch said. He lifted the muzzle of the gun he held.  \"But--\"  \"Either go back up or you'll stay down here a long time!\"  They went back up the ledge. Retch retired to the shelter of the trees and watched.  No shots came until they reached the mouth of the tunnel leading into the cliff. There, one of the men was killed. He fell backward from the ledge, screaming as he turned over and over.  The falling man broke his way through the top of a tree and sprawled thudding on the ground. He did not move after he hit. Retch did not waste a second glance on him.  Muffled but clearly audible, the blasting roar of the machine gun came from the tunnel.  \"He got in,\" Retch said. \"Okay. Two more of you go up.\"  Two more men went up the ledge.  The entire population of the village had gathered to watch this storming of the cliff. They regarded Retch with wonder and with awe. Some of these men had been pirates in their day, they had known how to loot a tall ship, to kill its crew, to take over any wealth and any women it happened to carry.  Watching Retch, they discovered they had been amateurs in the fine art of attacking and killing. They had needed a man from the modern world to show them how the job ought to be done. They were greatly impressed, Gotch most of all.  Waving his sword, Gotch explained what he would do to that black priest, Rozeno, and to that cowardly Indian, Ulnar. Of all the listening group, only Peg-leg protested.  \"Yeah, you'll get them all right--if the Jezbro don't get you first!\" Peg-leg said.  Retch overheard the words. \"Come here, Peg-leg, I want to talk to you.\"  The old sailor stumped his way to where Retch stood.  \"Aye, Cap'n.\" He saluted. A look of surprise appeared on the old sailor's face as the first heavy slug hit him. As the second, third, and fourth slugs hit him, the expression of surprise became one of agony. He fell without a sound.         *       *       *       *       *  Retch stood looking down at him.  The group was silent. Gotch hastily lowered his sword.  \"I don't want to hear any more superstitious talk,\" Retch said. \"There are a lot of funny things here on this island but there is nothing to be afraid of--except _this_!\" He patted the stock of the stumpy little gun he held. \"And there's enough stuff up there to make all of us rich; we'll have everything we can ever want.\" A glow crept into Retch's eyes as he spoke. They glowed with a yellow color and the yellow seemed to come out of his eyes and spread over his face. He glanced down at Peg-leg.  \"Dump him into the sea,\" he said, walking away.  The two men climbing the ledge reached the opening. They stopped there and apparently held a conference with the man who was already inside. They went inside. A few minutes later, one appeared at the opening.  \"You can come on up now,\" he yelled, waving his gun. \"All secure here.\"  \"Gotch!\"  \"Yes, Cap'n.\"  \"Come on.\"  Gotch went up the ledge with Retch. He went in shivering fear which he tried desperately to conceal.  \"What the hell are you scared of?\" Retch snarled at him.  \"Nuthin', nuthin', Cap'n. Nuthin'.\"  \"You yellow-livered--\" Retch stopped in midsentence. A sound was in the air, the cheeping of a sleepy bird. It was a tiny sound, fragile, distant, far-away, almost too weak to register on the ears. Hearing it, Retch jerked his eyes to the sky, seeking the source.  Gotch threw himself flat on the ledge.  \"The Jezbro!\" Gotch gasped. \"God--God--\"  Looking at the sky, Retch caught a glimpse of something moving there. It looked like a bird, but it was like no bird he had ever seen in his life. It was more like shadow--a darkness that had a darting elusive silver color about it.  Like a swooping hawk, it was diving toward the ground, aiming at the group clustered in the trees at the spot where the ledge began to rise up the face of the cliff. As it dived, the cheeping sound of a sleeping bird was becoming a flooding blast of wild harp notes.  \"The Jezbro!\" Gotch wailed.  The Jezbro dived at the men on the ground. They heard it, saw it; they scattered through the trees like frightened chickens fleeing from a hawk.  The Jezbro selected a victim. Retch caught a glimpse of long, cruel talons extended; saw the man grasped in them. The man screamed as the talons touched him, tried to throw himself flat, tried to jerk away from them. Huge wings fluttered, beating the air. The man did not escape. The talons held. The beating wings lifted him.  Wild notes flooded outward. There was triumph in the music now. Huge wings beat the air. The Jezbro climbed up above the trees. Held firmly in the extended talons was a fully grown man.  Watching, Johnny Retch felt panic tumble through him, panic that was like a sudden touch of an ice cold hand. They had warned him about the Jezbro. Old Peg-leg had tried to tell him. Gotch had trembled in fear. They had all insisted that there was _something_ here that did not belong in the world as he knew it.  He had laughed at them, he had called them superstitious fools. To him, there was nothing that was not of this world.  Nor was there now, when the moment of wild panic had passed. As the Jezbro swept upward through the air, rising along the face of the cliff, Retch jerked up the Tommy gun.  Smoke and lead blasted from the muzzle. The Jezbro was unharmed. Taking careful aim this time, Retch fired again, a furious blast of rattling sound.  The Jezbro swerved, the harp notes missed a beat.  From the suddenly loosened talons a figure plummeted downward, screamed as it fell, stopped screaming as it crunched against the ground.  The Jezbro circled in the air. It rose upward, swooped. Huge wings flapped, a tail structure was extended. From the gaping, extended mouth, a scream arose. The Jezbro seemed to leap toward the summit of the sky.  A flash of light as brilliant as the explosion of a miniature atom bomb flared for a brief second. Thunder clapped, rolled around the horizon; echoed back. In the distance the veil that circled the island shimmered and twisted as if it was about to collapse. It righted itself.  Except for a puff of swiftly dissipating white vapor, the air was clear. Where wild harp notes had once flooded "]]]
