Beginning tomorrow, you'll have all your people with you.\"  \"_All_ our people? But you're going to drive them out?\"  \"All of them. Oh, we won't prohibit the use of the vine-webs too, but from now on your race will have to fight it out on the surface as well. You and Mathild have proven that it can be done. It's high time the rest of you learned, too.\"  \"Jarl, you think too little of these young people themselves,\" Adler said. \"Tell them what is in store for them. They are frightened.\"  \"Of course, of course. It's obvious. Honath, you and Mathild are the only living individuals of your race who know how to survive down there on the surface. And we're not going to tell your people how to do that. We aren't even going to drop them so much as a hint. That part of it is up to you.\"  Honath's jaw dropped.  \"It's up to you,\" Jarl Eleven repeated firmly. \"We'll return you to your tribe tomorrow, and we'll tell your people that you two know the rules for successful life on the ground--and that everyone else has to go down and live there too. We'll tell them nothing else but that. What do you think they'll do then?\"  \"I don't know,\" Honath said dazedly. \"Anything could happen. They might even make us Spokesman and Spokeswoman--except that we're just common criminals.\"  \"Uncommon pioneers, Honath. The man and the woman to lead the humanity of Tellura out of the attic, into the wide world.\" Jarl Eleven got to his feet, the great light playing over him. Looking up after him, Honath saw that there were at least a dozen other Giants standing just outside the oval of light, listening intently to every word.  \"But there's a little time to be passed before we begin,\" Jarl Eleven said. \"Perhaps you two would like to look over our ship.\"  Humbly, but with a soundless emotion much like music inside him, Honath took Mathild's hand. Together they walked away from the chimney to Hell, following the footsteps of the Giants."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32455"],["title","Christmas Eve and Christmas Day: Ten Christmas stories (#0)"],["body","EVE AND CHRISTMAS DAY.

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1872, by     EDWARD E. HALE,     In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.       CAMBRIDGE:     PRESS OF JOHN WILSON AND SON.     PREFACE.   This is a collection of ten Christmas Stories, some of which have been published before. I have added a little essay, written on the occasion of the first Christmas celebrated by the King of Italy in Rome.  The first story has never before been published.  It is but fair to say that I have not drawn on imagination for Laura's night duty, alone upon her island. This is simply the account of what a brave New-England woman did, under like circumstances, because it was the duty next her hand.  If any reader observes a resemblance between her position and that of a boy in another story in this volume, I must disarm censure, by saying, that she had never heard of him when she was called to this duty, and that I had never heard of her when I wrote his story.

CHAPTER I.  ANOTHER GENERATION.  \"Here he comes! here he comes!\"  \"He\" was the \"post-rider,\" an institution now almost of the past. He rode by the house and threw off a copy of the \"Boston Gazette.\" Now the \"Boston Gazette,\" of this particular issue, gave the results of the drawing of the great Massachusetts State Lottery of the Eastern Lands in the Waldo Patent.  Mr. Cutts, the elder, took the \"Gazette,\" and opened it with a smile that pretended to be careless; but even he showed the eager anxiety which they all felt, as he tore off the wrapper and unfolded the fatal sheet. \"Letter from London,\" \"Letter from Philadelphia,\" \"Child with two heads,\"--thus he ran down the columns of the little page,--uneasily. \"Here it is! here it is!--Drawing of the great State Lottery. 'In the presence of the Honourable Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and of their Honours the Commissioners of the Honourable Council,--was drawn yesterday, at the State House, the first distribution of numbers'----here are the numbers,--'First combination, 375-1. Second, 421-7. Third, 591-6. Fourth, 594-1. Fifth,'\"--and here Mr. Cutts started off his feet,--\"'Fifth, 219-7.' Sybil, my darling! it is so! 219-7! See, dear child! 219-7! 219-7! O my God! to think it should come so!\"  And he fairly sat down, and buried his head in his hands, and cried.  The others, for a full minute, did not dare break in on excitement so intense, and were silent; but, in a minute more, of course, little Simeon, the youngest of the tribes who were represented there, gained courage to pick up the paper, and to spell out again the same words which his father had read with so much emotion; and, with his sister Sally, who came to help him, to add to the store of information, as to what prize number 5--219-7--might bring.  For this was a lottery in which there were no blanks. The old Commonwealth of Massachusetts, having terrible war debts to pay after the Revolution, had nothing but lands in Maine to pay them with. Now lands in Maine were not very salable, and, if the simple and ordinary process of sale had been followed, the lands might not have been sold till this day. So they were distributed by these Lotteries, which in that time seemed gigantic. Every ticket-holder had some piece of land awarded to him, I think,--but to the most, I fear, the lands were hardly worth the hunting up, to settle upon. But, to induce as many to buy as might, there were prizes. No. 1, I think, even had a \"stately mansion\" on the land,--according to the advertisement. No. 2 had some special water-power facilities. No. 5, which Mr. Cutts's ticket had drawn, was two thousand acres on Tripp's Cove,--described in the programme as that \"well-known Harbor of Refuge, where Fifty Line of Battle Ship could lie in safety.\" To this cove the two thousand acres so adjoined that the programme represented them as the site of the great \"Mercantile Metropolis of the Future.\"  Samuel Cutts was too old a man, and had already tested too critically his own powers in what the world calls \"business,\" by a sad satire, to give a great deal of faith to the promises of the prospectus, as to the commercial prosperity of Tripp's Cove. He had come out of the Revolution a Brigadier-General, with an honorable record of service,--with rheumatism which would never be cured,--with a good deal of paper money which would never be redeemed, which the Continent and the Commonwealth had paid him for his seven years,--and without that place in the world of peace which he had had when these years began. The very severest trial of the Revolution was to be found in the condition in which the officers of the army were left after it was over. They were men who had distinguished themselves in their profession, and who had done their very best to make that profession unnecessary in the future. To go back to their old callings was hard. Other men were in their places, and there did not seem to be room for two. Under the wretched political system of the old Confederation there was no such rapid spring of the material prosperity of the country as should find for them new fields in new enterprise. Peace did any thing but lead in Plenty. Often indeed, in history, has Plenty been a little coy before she could be tempted, with her pretty tender feet, to press the stubble and the ashes left by the havoc of War. And thus it was that General Cutts had returned to his old love whom he had married in a leave of absence just before Bunker Hill, and had begun his new life with her in Old Newbury in Massachusetts, at a time when there was little opening for him,--or for any man who had spent seven years in learning how to do well what was never to be done again.  And in doing what there was to do he had not succeeded. He had just squeezed pork and potatoes and Indian meal enough out of a worn-out farm to keep Sybil, his wife, and their growing family of children alive. He had, once or twice, gone up to Boston to find what chances might be open for him there. But, alas, Boston was in a bad way too, as well as Samuel Cutts. Once he had joined some old companions, who had gone out to the Western Reserve in Northern Ohio, to see what opening might be there. But the outlook seemed unfavorable for carrying so far, overland, a delicate woman and six little children into a wilderness. If he could have scraped together a little money, he said, he would buy a share in one of the ships he saw rotting in Boston or Salem, and try some foreign adventure. But, alas! the ships would not have been rotting had it been easy for any man to scrape together a little money to buy them. And so, year in and year out, Samuel Cutts and his wife dressed the children more and more plainly, bought less sugar and more molasses, brought down the family diet more strictly to pork and beans, pea-soup, hasty-pudding, and rye-and-indian,--and Samuel Cutts looked more and more sadly on the prospect before these boys and girls, and the life for which he was training them.  Do not think that he was a profligate, my dear cousin Eunice, because he had bought a lottery ticket. Please to observe that to buy lottery tickets was represented to be as much the duty of all good citizens, as it was proved to be, eleven years ago, your duty to make Havelocks and to knit stockings. Samuel Cutts, in the outset, had bought his lottery ticket only \"to encourage the others,\" and to do his honorable share in paying the war debt. Then, I must confess, he had thought more of the ticket than he had supposed he would. The children had made a romance about it,--what they would do, and what they would not do, if they drew the first prize. Samuel Cutts and Sybil Cutts themselves had got drawn into the interest of the children, and many was the night when they had sat up, without any light but that of a pine-torch, planning out the details of the little colony they would form at the East-ward,--if--if only one of the ten great prizes should, by any marvel, fall to him. And now Tripp's Cove--which, perhaps, he had thought of as much as he had thought of any of the ten--had fallen to him. This was the reason why he showed so much emotion, and why he could hardly speak, when he read the numbers. It was because that had come to him which represented so completely what he wanted, and yet which he had not even dared to pray for. It was so much more than he expected,--it was the dream of years, indeed, made true.  For Samuel Cutts had proved to himself that he was a good leader of men. He knew he was, and many men knew it who had followed him under Carolina suns, and in the snows of Valley Forge. Samuel Cutts knew, equally well, that he was not a good maker of money, nor creator of pork and potatoes. Six years of farming in the valley of the Merrimac had proved that to him, if he had never learned it before. Samuel Cutts's dream had been, when he went away to explore the Western Reserve, that he would like to bring together some of the best"]]]
