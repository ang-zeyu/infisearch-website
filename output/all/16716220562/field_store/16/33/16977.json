They saw the dark spots on the skin before they became feverish; they recognised the black mark of the Death and they gave themselves up for lost.  Labourers became very scarce.  They claimed higher wages.  The lords tried to drag them back into serfdom; they tried to force them by law to take the old wage.  On both sides of the Severn the labourers took arms, and waged war against their lords.  The peasant war in England is called the Peasant Revolt; the peasant war in Wales is sometimes called the revolt of Owen Glendower.  A change came over the rebellions in Wales.  At first, the rebellions were those of Llywelyn’s country; the allies who had deserted him, and then turned against Edward, like Rees ap Meredith; or his own followers, like Madoc, who said he was his son; or men he had protected, like Maelgwn Vychan in Pembroke.  Later on, under Edward II. and Edward III., the rebellions were against the march lords, and the king was looked upon as a protector—such as the rebellion of Llywelyn Bren against the Clares and Mortimers in Glamorgan in 1316.  But the wilder spirits went to the French wars, and fought for both sides.  With the assassination of Owen of Wales in 1378, the last of Llywelyn’s near relatives to dream of restoring the independence of Wales, the rebellions against the King of England came to an end.  When they broke out again, it was not in Snowdon or Ceredigion; the old dominions of Llywelyn were almost unwilling to rise.  The new revolts were in the march lands, and especially in the towns.     XV OWEN GLENDOWER   THE English baron in Wales tried to add to his possessions by encroaching on the lands of the Welsh freemen.  His estate always remained the same, because it all went to the eldest son, according to what is called primogeniture; their lands, on the other hand, were divided between the sons according to what is called gavelkind.  He also, by laws they did not understand, took the waste land—forest and mountain.  As one man can more easily watch his interest than many, the baron succeeded; but the freemen felt that they were being robbed.  The tenants of the barons were restless and rebellious; they said they were free, that they would not work as serfs, that they would not bring food rents, but that they would pay a fixed rent for every acre they held.  At Ruthin, in the Vale of Clwyd, there was a baron called Lord Grey; and in the valley of the Dee there was a Welsh squire called Owen Glendower. Their lands met, and Grey took part of Owen’s sheep walk.  Owen had been a law student at Westminster, and he had served Henry of Lancaster.  In 1399 Richard II. had been dethroned, and the barons had made Henry of Lancaster king as Henry IV.  Owen saw, however, that the king was too weak to curb his lawless barons, and in 1400 he attacked Lord Grey, and burnt Ruthin.  The rebellion that had long been smouldering burst into a flame all over the country.  Owen was at once welcomed by the bard, the friar, and the peasant.  The bard hailed his star as that of the heir of the princes, who had come to deliver his country.  The friar welcomed him as the friend of the poor and of learning; and unruly students from Oxford, then the centre of a great intellectual awakening, flocked home to march under his banner.  The peasant welcomed him as his protector against the steward of his lord.  The main strength of the movement was the peasant revolt; and Welsh poets, like the English ones, sang the praises of the ploughman and of the plough.  Owen’s success was most rapid, so rapid that it was put down to magic. In four years the whole of Wales recognised him as its prince.  Henry IV. and Prince Henry came to Wales, made rapid marches and retook castles, punished the friars of Llan Vaes and the monks of Strata Florida.  But their victories led to nothing, and the storms fought against them. Owen’s victories were used to the full—that of the Vyrnwy was followed by an agreement with Grey of Ruthin, that of Bryn Glas by an alliance with the Mortimers.  His marches were nearly all triumphant; he was welcomed along the whole line of the marches by the peasants to the furthest corners of Gwent.  Owen was wise enough to see that no abiding power can be based on a popular rising.  He tried to establish a government that the King of England could not overthrow.  He had three institutions in mind—an independent Wales, governed by him as Prince in a Parliament of representatives of the commotes; an independent Welsh Church, with an Archbishop of St David’s at its head; and an independent system of learning and civilisation, guided by two Universities, one in North Wales and one in South Wales.  The new Wales was to be safeguarded by four alliances—with the English barons, with the Pope, with Scotland, and with France.  He failed to save the Percies from their defeat at Shrewsbury in 1403; but he based all his plans on an alliance with the Mortimers, the enemies of Lancaster and the Percies.  The head of the Mortimer family had died in Ireland in 1398, and had left four young children.  They were the real heirs to the crown, and Owen meant to win their throne for them.  Their uncle, Edmund Mortimer, married Glendower’s daughter.  But the young Earl of March, the elder of the Mortimer boys, had no ambition, and a plot to bring him and his brother to Owen failed.  The Papacy had always proved to be a broken reed for Welsh princes; but Owen’s alliance with Peter de Luna, the anti-Pope Benedict XIII., gave a certain amount of prestige to his title.  The alliance with Scotland, based on common kinship, could bring him no help at that time: because it was torn between two factions during the reign of the weak Robert III.; and the next king, the poet James I., was captured at sea and put into an English prison.  The French alliance was much more promising; it would give what Owen wanted most—siege engines, a fleet, and an army of trained soldiers. Charles VI. of France, the father-in-law of the deposed Richard, refused to make peace with the usurper Henry; his fleet protected the Welsh coast, and in 1405 a French army of 2,800 men landed at Milford.  Owen struggled on, with waning power, until his death in 1415.  He came too soon for success, while the power of the House of Lancaster was increasing.  Of all figures in the history of Wales, that of Owen Glendower is the most striking and the most popular.  The place of his grave is unknown, his lineage and the date of his death a matter of conjecture; there is much mystery about even his most brilliant years.  But his majestic figure, his wisdom, and his ideals remained in the memory of his country. His ghost wandered, it was said, around Valle Crucis.  His spirit, more than that of any hero of the past, seems to follow his people on their onward march.  This is not on account of his political ideals, but because he was the champion of the peasant and of education.     XVI THE WARS OF THE ROSES   THE reign of Henry V. was a reign of brilliant victories in France, and the reign of Henry VI. one of disastrous defeats.  During both reigns the lords were becoming more powerful in Wales as well as in England.  The hold of the king over them became weaker every year; they packed the Parliament, they appointed the Council, they overawed the law courts.  If a man wanted security, he must wear the badge of some lord, and fight for him when called upon to do so.  In the marches of Wales there were more than a hundred lords holding castle and court; and it was easy for a robber or a murderer to escape from one lordship to the other, or even to find a welcome and protection.  In Wales and in the marches the lords preyed upon their weaker neighbours, and the country became full of private war.  The selfish families, all fighting for more land and more power, gradually formed themselves into two parties—the parties of the Red Rose and of the White Rose.  The leading family in the Red Rose party was that of Lancaster, represented by the saintly King Henry VI.; the leading family in the White Rose party was that of York.  In the Wars of the Roses, York and Lancaster fought over the crown, and those who supported them over a castle or an estate.  Wales was divided.  The west was for Lancaster, from Pembroke to Harlech, and from Harlech to Anglesey.  The east was for York, from Cardiff and Raglan to Wigmore, and from Wigmore to Chirk.  Lancaster held estates in Wales and on the border—the castles of Hereford, Skenfrith, Ogmore, and Kidwelly being centres of strength and wealth.  York’s chief country was the march of Wales, with Ludlow as its centre.  The Welsh barons took sides according to their interests.  Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, held the west for his half-brother, the king.  Sir William Herbert, who was very powerful in the country south of the Mortimers, took the side of his powerful neighbour.  Others wavered, especially Grey of Ruthin and the Stanleys in North Wales.  One battle was fought between the Welsh Yorkists and the Welsh Lancastrians.  This was the battle of Mortimer’s Cross, near Wigmore, in February 1461.  The victor was the young Duke of York, who was crowned king as Edward IV. later in the year.  An old man, Owen Tudor, the father of Jasper Tudor, and the grandfather of the boy who was “to rule after them all” as Henry VII., was taken prisoner.  They took him to Hereford, and there they cut his head off and set it on the market cross.  The battles of the Wars of the Roses were very cruel ones; the noble prisoners that had been taken, even children of tender age, were murdered in cold blood on the evening of the battle.  “By God’s blood,” said one, as he killed a child, “thy father slew mine, and so will I do thee.”  The Welsh barons led their men to nearly all the important battles. North Wales archers, wearing the three feathers of the Prince of Wales, fought for Lancaster in the snow at the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32604"],["title","The Story of the Raising and Organization of a Regiment of Volunteers in 1862 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made available by Internet Archive/American Libraries (http://www.archive.org/details/americana)    Note: Images of the original pages are available through       Internet Archive/American Libraries.

War Papers. 46  THE STORY OF THE RAISING AND ORGANIZATION OF A REGIMENT OF VOLUNTEERS IN 1862.  Prepared by Companion  Brevet Brigadier General ELLIS SPEAR, U.S. Volunteers,  And Read at the Stated Meeting of March 4, 1903.     The Story of the Raising and Organization of a Regiment of Volunteers in 1862.   Heretofore papers which have been read before this Commandery have related to personal reminiscences of campaigns and battles, with all the interest which accompanies the personal element in such affairs. The preservation of these details is of great importance, not only for the special interest which attaches to them, but because they illustrate the larger actions and will be of value to future generations, as showing the very body and features of the time. How valuable these minor matters are, we perceive plainly by the use made of them as they are found in autobiographies and diaries of former generations. The knowledge of the manner in which people lived and thought and acted in private life throws light upon public affairs and public characters. It is interesting, and not unprofitable, to know that the Father of his Country in some wrathful mood swore roundly; or that the Philosopher of the Revolution, in his younger days, trudged in the streets of Philadelphia with a loaf of bread under each arm; or, when older, was very gay and festive in the gay and festive capital of France.  I propose to continue in the same grave historical vein, but to treat of less important affairs. I propose to avoid the beaten track of campaigns, battles, marches and skirmishes, and the luxurious life of Libbey or Andersonville prisons, and going back to the beginning of things, endeavor to explain how a volunteer regiment was raised and gotten into the field, and, incidentally, perhaps, to touch upon the character of its officers and men.  The regiment of which I speak was the last to be organized in its State under the call for three hundred thousand men, made by the general Government in 1862. It was the last of that \"three hundred thousand more\" responding to the call of \"Father Abraham,\" according to the popular ditty of the time. The recruiting was done by private individuals, and at their own expense, under the authority of the Governor of the State. These private individuals, as a matter of course, expected, as a reward for their labor and expenditures, to be commissioned in the companies which they might raise. That was the understanding. Doubtless, in their efforts, they were inspired by patriotism, but, as was said about the Pilgrim Fathers, that they \"sailed by Deuteronomy, modified by an eye to the main chance;\" so there was also, with the officers, some modification or further stimulus of personal consideration, just as with the enlisted men--their patriotic impulses were somewhat assisted by the bounty of a hundred dollars.  This method of raising troops was an effective one and inexpensive to the Government; but as it involved more or less of log-rolling amongst his neighbors, and more or less persuasion and perhaps promises in the obtaining of recruits on the part of the ambitious recruiting officer, it was not so promising for future discipline. Nor was the process of selecting line officers by their ability or success in persuading their neighbors to enlist, a severe test of military fitness. However, these considerations did not trouble the Governor nor the impromptu recruiting officer, who did not foresee them. He had no experience whatever in this line of business, and fortunately did not look so far ahead. To say that as a rule he was utterly green in military matters, is to do injustice to the words. However, he might be credited with some enterprise and even audacity, for such certainly were required in a young man given to serious reflection, who should proposed to organize a military company, and to command it in the field, when he scarcely knew a line of battle from a line of rail fence.  Amongst those raising companies were young lawyers who had perhaps learned to draw an indictment, but who would not then have been able to draw anything in the military line, unless it were rations, or the enemy's fire. There were schoolmasters whose only qualifications for getting men to the front and keeping them there, were based on experience in teaching young ideas how to shoot. There were farmers, clerks, and fellows just out of college, some graduates and some undergraduates, but with not a tried or known military qualification in the whole squad. I mistake; there was one who recruited a company, and who had been in the Mexican War, but he was afterward found to have forgotten most that he had ever learned, and was soon found also unable, in the matter of legs, to keep up with the procession. And there was another who had had experience in an earlier regiment raised in 1861, but he resigned after his first battle. However, with these miscellaneous qualifications, unaided by experience, the embryo officers worked energetically to enlist the men. The work was largely, but not wholly, of the button-holing order. It was not unattended with exciting incidents. Anxious mothers met the recruiting officers sometimes in tears and sometimes in wrath. One such, I remember, drove him from the premises with a pitchfork. It was the first charge he had met and he retreated. The young man, however, got his recruit. The method of recruiting at that time would not bear strict investigation. It shared in the general and unavoidable slip-shodness and haste which marked the whole work of raising great armies out of an undrilled and unmilitary population, and on short notice. Troops in large numbers were needed and that urgently. Political considerations forbade drafting. They must be raised by volunteering. The inducements were bounties to the men and commissions to the officers. He who could raise a company in the least time was looked upon with the greatest favor and, other things being equal, got the earliest letter in the alphabet of the regiment. The recruiting officer did not know what kind of a man, of what physical or moral fibre, the service required, and had no opportunity to learn. His object was to get his hundred men as quickly as possible; and provided the recruit had limbs, organs, and dimensions, that was enough. The care of the Governor of the State, and usually his knowledge, went also no further. He had the State's quota to fill, and was most concerned to fill it as early and as easily as possible. The average examining surgeon had no more knowledge of the business than the recruiting officer, and was inclined to take the patriotism of the volunteer as conclusive evidence of bodily soundness. The mustering officer mustered in the lump, what the recruiting officer had gathered and the surgeon had passed.  So there was small effort at sifting. The results were sometimes even ludicrous. One fellow, too short, was passed in high-heeled shoes, and grew shorter as time and his shoes wore on; but he made an excellent soldier. Another passed muster in a black beard, which soon after disclosed an ever widening zone of grey, and he became a veteran prematurely. More obscure bodily defects developed on the first hard campaign, and speedily furnished ample material for the hospital and pension roll. However, by hook or crook the ten companies were raised, and from various quarters were transported at the Government's expense, to the camp where they were to be organized into a regiment. There was some grumbling on account of having to ride in a freight car on the part of men who afterwards, many times, would have very gladly availed themselves of that jolting method of transportation. At the rendezvous the company first to arrive found neither quarters nor rations, and therefore marched into the city, woke up the Mayor, and then relied on his patriotic charity. But the later arrivals fared better, and there was plenty of beef and bread.  The Governor, when he saw the enlistment rolls, and heard that the men had been placed in camp at the rendezvous, said to himself and his counsellors: \"These fellows who have recruited so many men and have actually landed them in camp must have military qualifications,\" and straightway he commissioned them all. Strictly speaking, however, it was not straightway, but as soon as the clerks could fill out the commissions and the Governor found time to sign them.  All these assembled recruits and expectant officers presented when in camp the general appearance of a town meeting. But one uniform was to be seen; that was of the gentleman who had seen service in the regiment of 1861; the uniform of the Mexican veteran evidently had been worn out long since. However, soon the Major came who had seen some service as a captain in an earlier regiment, and who had succeeded in getting himself transferred with an increased rank; leave of absence and promotion at the same stroke. He wore a uniform, but looked lonesome. However, he had seen a camp and had been in a regiment, and had some ideas of what ought to be done. He organized a guard whose only weapons at first were those given by nature or borrowed from the wood pile. His first officer of the day, in a brown cutaway, striped trowsers, and a silk hat, bore as insignia of his office a part of a military weapon, now discarded, but at that early date in use, and known as a ramrod. If there were a sword in camp, excepting those of the major commanding and the veteran of '61, its owner must have"]]]
