His cap and shoulder-boards were bright with silver lace and he held a singularly ugly little automatic weapon cradled across one forearm.  Nina and Lindsay dropped their weapons. But the girl's back was up. Her slanting eyes crackled green fire as she said, \"What right have you bastards got to come busting in here without a warrant?\"  \"Sorry,\" said the officer with chilling courtesy. \"As it happens we do have a warrant. Remember, Miss Beckwith, this cottage is not United World's soil.\" He tossed an official looking document which Nina caught, motioned a couple of his men to pick up her weapons.  \"All right,\" she said after scanning the warrant. \"What do you want?\"  \"Ambassador Lindsay,\" was the reply. \"We have been ordered to ensure that no harm comes to him while he is on American soil.\"  \"I can read!\" snapped the girl. \"There's going to be hell to pay over this.\" Then, to Lindsay, \"We can't stop them now but they can't hold you. _I_ can see to that. Just try to keep your big dumb blundering self out of any extra trouble till we can take steps--will you promise me that, boss?\"  \"I'll try,\" said Lindsay.         *       *       *       *       *  They took him to Washington--or rather to Sherwood Forest, in Annapolis, where the summer White House sprawled over and beneath its landscaped acres. To a man from Mars it was very green, very lush, very beautiful.  Lindsay's first impression of famed President Giovannini was that the famous elected leader of the North American Republic was composed mostly of secretaries. But at last one of them--the seventh or eighth--said gravely, \"If you'll just step this way, please,\" to Lindsay and motioned for the Army officer to remain where he was. He was admitted to the bathroom of the man who had sent for him so summarily.  The president proved to be unexpectedly like some of the governors of Lindsay's home planet--incisive, unaffected, easily articulate. Physically he was stocky, of middle height, with a round, firmly fleshed sensitive face. He wore huaraches and bright blue shorts, no glasses or distortion harness.  He waved Lindsay to a contour chair beside his own, said, \"Sorry I had to have you hauled here this way. I was afraid you'd get killed if I didn't. Do you have any idea of the uproar you've caused in the past two days, young man?\"  Lindsay, somewhat taken aback by the president's abruptness, said, \"Well, I knew some small groups were upset but....\"  \"Take a look,\" the president told him, waving toward a quartet of vidar screens on the wall. Over one of them was the legend, New Orleans, over another, New York, over a third, Los Angeles, over the fourth, Chicago. \"Those are live shots,\" Giovannini added.  Lindsay was appalled. Each of them showed rioting crowds and defensive police action; the commentaries cried their confusion. However, the Martian got the drift quickly enough. Apparently his recent activities had driven the neurotic Earthlings to violence.  There appeared to be two chief factions. One of them, smashing and swarming and screaming its outrage, was demanding the abolishment of computer government. The other, equally violent and even more numerous, was after a villain named Zalen Lindsay.  Seeing that Lindsay was beginning to understand what was happening, the president pressed a button that turned off all the vidar screens and voices. He said, \"I could switch to any of our other cities--to cities in South America, India, Western Europe, England. They're especially bitter toward you in England.\"  \"I'm beginning to accept the fact--if not to understand,\" said Lindsay.  The president said, \"Lindsay, from the point of view of your planet you have done nothing improper. But from the point of view of this planet....\" He let silence and a shrug of thick shoulders finish the sentence.  \"I had no idea,\" Lindsay began, \"that conditions on Earth....\" He let his own voice trail off.  Giovannini finished it for him. \"You had no idea people on Earth were so damned neurotic,\" he said, and sighed. Then, \"Lindsay--call me Johnny, will you? All my friends do--Lindsay, for generations now people by and large have been forfeiting confidence in themselves to confidence in computers.  \"They have had good reason. Computer judgment has been responsible for the first true age of world peace in history. It may not be healthy but it's a damn sight healthier than war. And it has transformed this republic from an unwieldy group of states into a controlled anarchy that can be run by pushbuttons under ordinary conditions.\"  He paused while the Martian lit a cigarette, then went on with, \"Thanks first to Sylac, then to Elsac, we learned that Vermont was happiest under its Town Meeting method, North Carolina needed its oligarchy, while my native state, California, is much better off divided in two. Texas became happy with its triple legislature--they never are happy unless they have a little more of everything down there. It was the same in other countries--Canada, South America, Spain....\"  \"And England?\" Lindsay said softly.  The president sighed again. \"England,\" he admitted, \"is a bit of a problem--out of all proportion to its size and current importance. But the British are stubborn about their institutions. They've hung onto a Royal Family a hundred years longer than anyone else. We can hardly expect them to give up their beloved socialism so soon.\"  \"Just as long as Mars is not expected to pay for this indulgence, it's quite all right with my people,\" Lindsay told him.  \"What's _your_ first name--Zalen?\" the president asked. \"Well, Zalen, I know it's a problem but we all have to give a little or crowd somebody out. Zalen, people are getting killed on account of you right now.\"  \"I've nearly been killed a couple of times myself.\"  \"I know. Regrettable,\" said Giovannini. \"The UW crowd never has understood security. That's why I had to kidnap you, Zalen. Couldn't have you killed, you know. Not now anyway.\"  \"Glad you feel that way, Johnny.\" Lindsay told him drily. \"But hasn't it occurred to you that if people here are so easily set off it might be a good idea to knock out this computer business once and for all?\"  The president puffed on his cigarette. Then he said, \"Zale, twenty years ago, maybe even ten, it could have been done. Now it's too late. Which is why the ninety-billion-dollar investment in Giac. We've got to give them an absolute computer, one that will remove forever the basic distrust of computer judgment that underlies the neuroses you just mentioned.\"  \"Quite possibly,\" said Lindsay. \"But I haven't actually done a damned thing myself to undermine computer judgment. The mistakes have been made by the so-called experts who have fed their machines inadequate information. Those mistakes were infantile. They suggest some sort of neurosis on the part of the feeders. They could be mistake-prone, you know.\"  President Giovannini chuckled again. \"Of course they're mistake-prone, Zalen,\" he said. \"Some of them, anyway. And it's getting worse. That's the real reason for Giac. Wait'll you see it!\"  \"You think I'm going to be around that long, Johnny?\" Lindsay asked. \"I understand I'm to be sent back to Mars--if I live that long.\"  \"No, Lindsay, we need you--I'll explain in a moment. And we aren't going to let you die and become a martyr for generations of anti-computerites. We can't have that now, can we?\"  \"I'll go along with you on it,\" said Lindsay, wondering what the president was leading up to.  \"Good!\" The president beamed at him. \"Zalen--I want _you_ to be the first person to put Giac through a public test. That's how much I trust that machine. I want you, the man who has fouled up two computers, including Elsac, to try her out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  And Lindsay could only nod. The governors of Mars might not approve but after the uproar he had caused on this mission they could hardly object. President Giovannini's scheme was fully up to that renowned statesman's reputation for political astuteness. The more Lindsay thought it over the more beautiful was its simplicity.  Mere word that he was to conduct the first public test would quell the rioting. And unless Lindsay could show this mightiest of all symbolic logic computers to be fallible, computer rule would be entrenched on Earth as never before.  But what if, in some way, he succeeded in confounding the computer? Lindsay shuddered as he thought of the rioting he had so recently witnessed on the vidar-screens.  His face must have revealed his distress for the president said, \"You're worn out, Zalen. Can't have that, you know. Not with the big test coming tomorrow.\"  Lindsay barely remembered leaving the president and being led to a sleeping chamber somewhere in the vast mansion. When he woke up it was dark and Nina was perched on the edge of his contour couch, looking unexpectedly demure in a grey bolo with white collar and cuffs.  He said, as articulate as usual when she surprised him, \"Hi.\"  \"About time you woke up,\" she said. \"Do you know you snore?\"  \"I can't help it,\" he told her. Then, coming fully awake, \"How the devil did you get _here_?\"  \"I walked,\" she informed him succinctly. She stood up, her magnificent figure silhouetted against the light. \"Better get dressed--your duds are over there.\" She nodded toward a walldrobe. \"I'll wait in the bathroom.\" She breezed out.  When he looked at the clothing he was to wear he sensed that Nina had selected it for him. It was a little brighter in color, a little more daring in cut, than what he would have picked for himself.  Nina was placing jewels carefully in her hair, which she had released to form a sleek halo around her magnificent head, when he entered the bathroom.

SWAIN  [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Stories December 1942. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]   [Illustration: \"Look!\" said Henry Horn with a gasp. \"Here, you look at the camp through the glasses!\"]   [Sidenote: Henry Horn had a new invention; a pair of glasses that worked on the x-ray principle. But he didn't expect them to reveal Nazi secret agents and their works of sabotage!]   \"It's not enough to have a nudist colony move in next door!\" fumed Professor Paulsen. \"No, indeed! That wouldn't disrupt things enough. Now, in addition, every ne'er-do-well in the county comes prowling over our farm in order to spy on the naked numbskulls!\"  Scowling ferociously, the gaunt scientist stamped violently back across the meadow's lush verdure toward the little country home he shared with his partner, Henry Horn. Beside him, matching his own long strides, came the savant's old friend, Major Ray Coggleston of Army Intelligence.  \"None of us can hope for a bed of roses all the time, Joe,\" Coggleston remarked, grinning at the professor's outburst. \"'Into each life some rain must fall,' you know. You've got trespassers to bother you. Me, I'm responsible for protecting one of the biggest explosives laboratories in the country against Axis espionage and sabotage.\"  Instinctively, as he spoke, the officer's eyes sought out the long, low Ordnance experiment station, barely a mile away. Professor Paulsen, following the glance, nodded.  \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"And when you come right down to it, my worries over the nudist camp back there\"--he jerked his head toward the high board fence which marked the boundary--\"aren't very important. Not with a war in progress.\"  By now the two were in the yard and rounding the corner of the house.  The next instant they stopped dead in their tracks.  There, in the shade of the building, stood a slight, familiar figure. A figure which, at the moment, was the center of attention for a little knot of interested spectators.  \"Oh, yes, gentlemen, it certainly does work!\" cried Henry Horn enthusiastically, his scraggly goatee jerking spasmodically with each nod of emphasis. He waved the battered pair of binoculars he clutched in his right hand. \"Yes, it's a marvelous invention. You can see everything you want to, just like you were right inside that camp. And only a dollar for a minute's look!\"  The professor's face jumped to beet red, then apoplectic purple. His fists clenched, and the sound he made as he sucked in his breath closely resembled that of a cow pulling her foot out of a mudhole. He started forward.  Major Coggleston choked off an incipient frame-racking spasm of mirth barely in time. He caught the tall scientist's arm.  \"See you later, Joe!\" he snickered. \"I've got to get back on duty. There's a new super-explosive being tested, and I'm supposed to be on hand.\"  \"All right. Later.\" Professor Paulsen grated the words through clenched teeth, but it is doubtful that he was even conscious of speaking. His eyes were focussed straight at Henry in a horrible glare, and the smoke of indignation hovered about him in clouds.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Only a dollar, gentlemen!\" cried Henry, oblivious to all this new attention. \"It's just like going inside the camp. Really it is!\"  \"He's right, boys!\" broke in a burly, red-headed character. \"Those glasses of his are better than a seat on the fence.\" And, turning to the little man: \"I'll even buy 'em from you. How much'll you take?\"  \"You see, gentlemen?\" whooped Henry, steel-rimmed spectacles nearly sliding off the end of his nose in his excitement. \"The gentleman says my invention is everything I say it is--\"  \"_Henry!_\"  The little man jumped as if a red-hot flatiron had just been applied to that portion of his trousers designed for sitting.  \"Urghk!\" he exclaimed profoundly.  \"You prying Piltdown[1]!\" flamed the professor. \"Is there anything you won't do for money?\" A moment of thunderous silence. \"I'm surprised you're not doing a fan dance yourself, if these would-be Peeping Toms are willing to pay for nakedness.\"  The red-headed man guffawed.  \"And you!\" exploded the savant, turning on the spectators. \"Get out of here! Yes, all of you, you riffraff! I won't have you on the place!\"  Henry's potential customers fled before the Paulsen wrath like chaff before the wind, leaving the quaking little entrepreneur to face his fate alone. He stood braced against the verbal cloud-burst, eyes squeezed tight shut behind steel-rimmed glasses, goatee sticking straight out.  \"For days these snoopers have driven me half-crazy!\" raged the professor. \"I've tried every trick I could think of to keep them out. I've put signs forbidding trespassing on every tree. I've threatened mayhem and murder. Yet still they come!\"  \"But Joseph--\"  \"Keep quiet 'til I'm finished, you disgrace to science!\" The lean scholar ran trembling fingers through his greying hair. Then:  \"And now--today! Major Coggleston and I go down to the end of the meadow to drive three of the sneaking human dung beetles away from knot-holes. When we get back, what do we find?\"  \"Joseph, please--\"  \"We find you--my colleague, my partner, my friend! You--peddling the use of your binoculars to the slimy creatures!\" He glared savagely at his victim. \"If you were in Paris, Henry Horn, you'd be selling French postcards to tourists!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Still purple with rage, the savant turned away. Stared dourly back toward the high board fence that surrounded the nudists.  The next instant he jerked as stiff as if an electric shock had jolted through him.  \"Henry!\"  \"Yes, Joseph.\" The other's voice was meekly plaintive as he awaited a renewal of the diatribe.  \"Henry, that fence is between us and the nudists! How could you see them, binoculars or not?\"  Henry's face brightened. His goatee moved to a more confident angle.  \"That's what I've been trying to tell you, Joseph,\" he explained. \"It's my new invention--\"  \"Invention!\" There was a hysterical note in the way Professor Paulsen exclaimed the word. \"Please, Henry, not that! Don't tell me you've been inventing again--\"  His little colleague bristled.  \"And why shouldn't I be inventing, Joseph Paulsen?\" he demanded querulously. \"My inventions are mighty valuable. Why my new explosive--\"[2]  \"--Which you ran onto quite by accident, and which turned out not to be an explosive at all,\" the professor cut in grimly.  \"Well, the government--\"  \"The government doesn't have to live with you. Nor to put up with your 'inventive' ways.\" Henry's tall partner was fierce in his vehemence. \"You've cited one of your devil's devices that turned out well. Well, now let me mention a few. Remember what happened when you decided to find the universal solvent[3]?\"  \"But scientists all make mistakes sometimes, Joseph--\"  \"And how about that time you wiped out every peony within ten miles? Was that a mistake too?\"  \"Honestly, I didn't think it would kill anything but ragweed,\" Henry sniveled miserably.  \"Of course it was all an accident when you rendered every one of our guinea pigs sterile, wasn't it?\" sneered the other. \"That was a nice invention, Henry. All it did was to cut off our income for months on end, and nearly destroy our reputation for reliability as breeders of laboratory guinea pigs.\"  \"Oh, Joseph!\" Henry's voice was an abject wail. His goatee hung limp and bedraggled. \"You know I didn't mean any harm any of those times. Really I didn't. I just want to be a scientist--\" Again he began sniveling.  Professor Paulsen, still glaring, opened his mouth to denounce his partner further. Then, thinking better of it, he relaxed and put his arm around Henry's quivering shoulders.  \"Do you think I like to talk to you like this?\" he asked, leading the way toward the porch. \"Do you think it's pleasant for me?\" Wearily, he shook his head. \"I hate to be shouting at you all the time, Henry. It's just that patience will stretch only so far. Then it snaps.\"  A pause.  \"I keep thinking you'll learn by experience, Henry. That you'll realize you can't be forever blowing the roof off the laboratory, or Lord knows what else, and quit fooling around with things you don't understand.  \"But instead, you go right on. You dabble into some new branch of science, and a cloud of trouble sweeps down on us like a typhoon on Zamboanga.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Together, the friends climbed the porch steps and took seats on the ancient but comfortable wicker settee.  Henry darted a quick glance at his partner. Saw that the professor's face once more was placid; that the storm was over. Unconsciously, the little man's goatee perked up. He readjusted his steel-rimmed glasses to a more stable position.  \"Honestly, Joseph, this time my invention can't do any harm,\" he ventured. \"Really it can't.\"  For a moment fire flashed in the scientist's eyes. Then faded again.  \"All right, Henry. What is it this time?\"  Henry extended the binoculars.  \"Here, Joseph. Look at the nudist camp.\"  \"But the fence--\"  \"Please, Joseph. Go ahead and look.\"  \"Oh, all right--\"  The professor raised the field glasses.  The next instant he nearly dropped them.  \"What on earth--!\"  \"See, Joseph?\" shrilled Henry. \"Isn't it a wonderful invention? Isn't it?\"  His tall partner took down the binoculars and stared at them in blank amazement, his face a puzzled mask.  \"I'd swear I saw right through that fence!\" he gasped. \"I looked right into the middle of a whole pack of nudists!\"  \"Of course!\" Henry was bubbling with delight. \"That's why I call them my X-ray eyeglasses. You can see through anything with them.\" He took the glasses from the professor. Again leveled them at the nudist colony.  Then, giggling:  \"Doesn't that blonde girl have the cutest--\"  \"Henry!\"  \"Oh, all right.\" The little man"]]]
