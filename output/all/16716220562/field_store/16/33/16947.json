That possibility you must not forget for a single instant, and act accordingly.\"  The Chief of Combined U.S. Intelligence took another couple of moments out, and Dawson, watching him intently, saw the corners of his mouth tighten, and a hard, steely look come into his eyes.  \"And let's not try to kid ourselves either,\" he suddenly said in a low, quiet voice that contained just a faint ring of steel against steel. \"It is going to be the hardest job any of you have yet tackled. And some of you, only a few I hope to God, will not be coming back. We are playing for surprise one hundred per cent, but we've got to remember that the Japs have not thus far shown themselves to be stupid and dumb when it comes to the question of pulling a fast one. For that reason, we've got to be on the alert against any surprises they might pull out of the hat. Frankly, nobody knows where this carrier force is right now, or where it's headed. Not even our own Navy Department. This maneuver is strictly hush-hush. And that's just as it should be, everything considered. We have a tough job ahead, and there's no sense making it any tougher through being careless and not on the alert. And now, just one more thing. You can consider it an honor to be selected to take part in this maneuver, but don't let it go any farther than that. I mean, there are pilots, and air crews aboard this carrier, and the Hawk, who will not take part in your work. That, however, doesn't mean they won't have a job to do, and a mighty important one, too. So just don't get the idea that you are something special--even if you are. See what I mean? All right, then. Thanks for listening, and a million in luck. Very good, sir. Your turn.\"  The colonel spoke the last to the carrier task force commander seated beside him. The high ranking naval officer rose to his feet, spoke a few words of greeting to the pilots, assured them that they were most welcome aboard the ship, and expressed the hope that they would find their stay aboard pleasant for themselves, and profitable for the cause for which they were fighting. Then the Naval officer turned them over to the executive flight officer. He in turn led them out into the deck hangar, and with the aid of a few junior officers assigned the planes to be used on the Jap hunt.  The plane given to Dawson and Farmer was a Wright \"Cyclone\" powered Douglas \"Dauntless.\" That suited them both right down to the ground. Or rather, right down to the deck. It did because they both had flown that type of carrier-based plane quite often. And in their combined opinion it was the very latest thing in long range scout-bombing planes.  \"Nice, very nice!\" Dawson breathed happily, as he ran his eyes over the sleek, yet powerfully built aircraft. \"I was worrying a little about what they were going to give us to fly. But I'm not worrying any more. This baby is all that I'd ask for.\"  \"Quite; me, too!\" Freddy Farmer echoed. \"It's got the range, and the power.\"  \"Also, it has the what it takes, in case we bump into Zeros and such,\" Dave reminded him. \"Gee, I wonder if they're going to let us try out the ships before they send us off on the hunt job?\"  \"Naturally,\" Freddy Farmer replied, as though he considered such a question quite unnecessary. \"After all, you know, even aircraft of the same type are different in lots of little things.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" Dawson grunted. \"But--\"  And that's as far as he got. It was almost as though his question about test flying the Douglas Dauntless had been overheard, because at that moment a junior officer came up with the announcement that most of the aircraft were about to be taken up onto the flight deck so that they could be test flown before darkness set down for the night.  And just twenty-five minutes later by Dave's watch he was seated in the pilot's pit of the Dauntless buckling his safety harness, and making the one hundred and one last minute preparations for flight. Seated in the pit in back of him was Freddy Farmer, making ready himself. The Carrier Carson had turned slightly into the wind and was rushing through the Southwest Pacific at full knots to give the pilots every take-off advantage possible.  \"Okay, Freddy?\" Dave called back. \"All set?\"  \"Been waiting for hours!\" the English youth shot back at him \"Right-o! Any time you get the signal.\"  Dave grunted and fixed his eyes on the flight bridge. The officer there suddenly turned and pointed his flag at Dave. Dawson gunned his engine slightly, and with the aid of a crew man on each wing he wheeled the Dauntless forward and into take-off position. The flight officer raised the flag, looked at Dave, and then brought the flag down fast. Dawson's hand on the throttle shoved it forward. The Wright Cyclone in the nose roared up in its song of power and the Dauntless moved forward down the deck. It picked up speed with every rev of its three-bladed steel prop, and Dave had it clear of the deck in no time at all. He went cutting up and off to the left to make room for the next plane taking off.  \"Well, pal, how's it suit you?\" he called back to Freddy when there were some five thousand feet of air under the wings.  \"What suits me?\" the English youth echoed back. \"This plane, or your flying, or what? Of course, if you mean your flying, why--\"  \"Save it, sweetheart, save it!\" Dave growled. \"No. This pip of a plane, and _my_ expert flying, go without saying. What I meant was, how does this Jap hunt shape up to you?\"  \"Could be worse, I fancy,\" Freddy replied. \"Truth to tell, though, I could do with a whole lot more details. The colonel didn't say very much, you know.\"  \"Well, for cat's sake, what else could he say?\" Dawson demanded. \"Somewhere in an area of about a hundred thousand square miles is supposed to be a big Jap force on its way south to make plenty of trouble. Maybe it isn't going south. The colonel doesn't know. Or anybody else, for that matter. However, the colonel can't take chances on our Guadalcanal and Tulagi attack going haywire. I mean, having this Jap force bump into them right at the beginning of the attack. See what I mean?\"  \"Rot!\" Freddy snorted. \"As if a ten-year-old child couldn't reason _that_ out? Certainly! Of course, you silly blighter. Naturally the colonel doesn't know _where_ this Jap force is. But I meant, more details on how, and when, and how long we're to patrol, and stuff? He only touched on that part by saying that we're to find the Jap force.\"  \"Okay, okay, fire horse!\" Dave grunted. \"Just be patient. I promise you, I'll refuse to take off on a single patrol until your craving for details is completely satisfied. Will that be all right, fussy pants?\"  Freddy Farmer made some remark, but Dave didn't hear it. He didn't because at that moment he heard the call signal from the carrier in his earphones. He answered at once, and his heart started hammering against his ribs as the crisp spoken orders came through from the carrier far below and several miles to the north of his position.  \"Proceed due east from your position, Tiger!\" the carrier officer said, using the Dauntless' code name. \"Scout for unidentified aircraft. Proceed at full throttle. If it is an enemy aircraft, attack and destroy at once. Repeat! Attack and _destroy_ at once!\"  \"Orders received and understood, Swordfish!\" Dawson called back instantly. \"On course, now!\"  As Dave had spoken the words he had heeled the Dauntless around on wingtip, opened up the Cyclone wide, and was now streaking across the Southwest Pacific sky toward the east. Their headphones being connected, Freddy Farmer had heard the orders at the same time. And so, naturally, he asked no questions about Dave's sudden and violent maneuver. As a matter of fact he said nothing. He simply sat tight in his pit, and like Dave riveted his eyes on the eastern sky ahead.  The east was a little smudgy because night was approaching. Also there were some cloud banks hanging in the sky that cast all kinds of crazy shadows. As a matter of fact, half a dozen times Dawson was dead sure he spotted the shadow of a moving plane hugging close to the clouds. But each time he opened his mouth to call out to Freddy Farmer the \"shadow\" just melted away into nothing.  Eventually, though, Freddy Farmer's eagle eyes scored a hit on something that wasn't just a shadow that melted away the next time he looked. He called out sharply to Dave, and pointed with his hand.  \"A lone aircraft ahead and about ten degrees to starboard, Dave!\" he announced. \"See it? Just under that cloud that's shaped like a pear. See it? See...? By Jove, Dave, get us more speed! That's a blasted Jap snooper! Good grief! And this far south? Wait! Yes, Dave, yes! It is one of their four-engined Kawanishi flying boats, just as sure as you're a foot high. Blast them! Way down here snooping on us!\"  For some four or five seconds Dawson didn't make any reply. He leaned forward in the seat, as though that would aid his vision, and stared hard at the heavens ahead and ten degrees to starboard. But for those number of seconds he couldn't see a single thing that increased his heart beat. Then, suddenly, he did see it. He saw the huge four-engined long range flying boat type of craft that the Japs had copied from the type of flying boat that the French had used before the war on the mail and passenger run between Dakar and Brazil. Now that he could see it he was amazed that he hadn't seen it much sooner because of its tremendous size. The wing span was a good one hundred and thirty-two feet, and the hull made him think of a good sized destroyer. And as he peered at it and impulsively tried to force the Dauntless on to even greater speed by pressing the heel of one palm hard against the already wide open throttle, he realized without getting any closer that the huge flying boat was well armed.  \"Don't you see it yet, Dave?\" Freddy Farmer's voice cut into this thoughts. \"It's just under--\"  \"Don't worry; I spot it, eagle eyes!\" Dawson cut"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32542"],["title","Dave Dawson on Guadalcanal (#8)"],["body","off. \"I'm just selecting which part of it to smack first. Come snooping down here on us, huh? Not today, my little Jap rats. At least, not any more. Just another couple of shakes, now, and you're going to only have eyes that are blind! And how!\"     CHAPTER SEVEN  _Discovered?_   As Dawson grated out the words he automatically checked to make sure that his guns were ready for action. They were, but in the next split second the fear was his that he might not be able to use them. Those aboard the Kawanishi flying boat had obviously spotted his approach, because the huge craft had suddenly changed course and was racing upward and eastward toward the safety of a towering bank of clouds. Dave instantly nosed the Dauntless up for altitude, and shook his head savagely.  \"No, not even that way!\" he shouted aloud into the thunder of his own engine. \"We'll smoke you out of there even if it takes all night. Nope! You rats are all washed up, and I don't mean maybe!\"  With a vigorous nod for emphasis, Dawson hunched forward even more on the seat and let fly with a short burst from his guns to warm them up. Perhaps the Japs heard his firing and accepted it as a challenge. Or maybe the slant-eyed killer at the controls saw that he wouldn't be able to make the safety of the clouds in time, and was veering around to present less of a target to the oncoming Dauntless.  At any rate, the huge craft came curving around in the air, and its blunt nose started spewing out a jetting ribbon of red flame. Dave grinned and inched his plane up a little more.  \"Thanks for saving me the trouble of hunting you out!\" he shouted. \"But you'd be a flock of dead ducks, no matter what you tried. Me and Freddy have been around, slobs, see? We sort of know most of the answers, now, when it comes to you baby killers. Okay! Try this one on your rice bowl!\"  As the last left Dave's lips he pulled the nose of the Douglass Dauntless straight up toward Heaven. He let the plane prop claw upward until it was just this side of the stalling point. Then, with a kick on the rudder pedal and a swift pass at the controls, he whipped the scout-bomber over and down at practically the vertical. As he had been going straight up, the Kawanishi had been rushing straight forward, and so as a result the big craft was almost directly below when Dawson came rushing down again. He had only to ease just a little out of his dive to catch the top of the flying boat in his sights. And the instant he had it pinned in his sights he let go with his forward guns.  For one brief instant nothing seemed to happen. Then suddenly the huge Kawanishi appeared to stand still in the air. Stand still and spew out jetting ribbons of red flame from a dozen different points from the nose of the hull clear back to the tail. The jetting ribbons of flame marked the efforts of the Jap gunners aboard to get the diving Dauntless in their sights. However, they might just as well have tried to pick off a haywire comet rushing down at them.  And then, as the flying boat seemed to come to a dead halt in the air, the efforts of the Jap gunners came to a swift and abrupt halt. A tiny tongue of flame shot up from the forward end. Then as though by magic it spread out fan-shaped and went sweeping backward to engulf everything in a raging inferno of flame. Eyes popping, and heart practically standing still, Dawson stared in awe at the horrible sight. And then in the nick of time he snapped out of his trance, and hauled the plunging Dauntless off to the side and into the clear.  \"About time, little man!\" he heard Freddy Farmer shout. \"I thought you were going to run into the beggar, and tell him you were sorry. But you know you're very hoggish, don't you. A very greedy beggar, if there ever was one.\"  Dawson didn't make any reply at once. He brought the Dauntless back onto even keel, and then turned in the seat to look back at the Kawanishi. That is, he turned in the seat to look back at what was _left_ of the huge flying boat. And that was just a great ball of flame and smoke that hovered in midair for a moment or two before it started dropping earthward trailing behind a long column of fluffy black. Dave followed it all the way down until it smacked into the Southwest Pacific with a mighty splash.  \"What was that you were babbling about, pal?\" he then demanded of his flying mate.  \"I was remarking that you are a rotter!\" Freddy Farmer snapped. \"Very definitely so. And twice as greedy, too. What do you think I'm back here for, with guns of my own, eh?\"  \"I sure could answer that one, but skip it, pal!\" Dave laughed at him. \"But it was just one of those things, Freddy, so help me. I must have nailed the pilot and one of the tanks first burst. Boy! Did he burn up and go down quick! Talk about shooting clay pigeons! That was certainly the cinchiest thing I ever tackled. I--Holy smoke! Hold it a moment, Freddy! I should be reporting to the carrier.\"  Forgetting Freddy Farmer for the moment, Dave concentrated on raising the carrier on the radio, and made his report. His report was acknowledged, and he was given orders to return to the surface vessel at once. The orders had been short and sweet, and Dave broke off contact with a faint frown.  \"Now what, I wonder?\" he grunted absently. \"They didn't seem to be very pleased about it. What did they expect, anyway?\"  \"Good grief, what did _you_ expect?\" Freddy Farmer snapped at him. \"A citation for a medal while you're still in the air? Use your head, old thing. The carrier task force commander is pleased right enough, I fancy. But undoubtedly quite worried, too. He wants us back in a hurry for questioning.\"  \"Huh?\" Dave echoed, and started searching the surrounding skies. \"You mean, because maybe there's some more of those big babies around?\"  \"Oh my hat!\" the English youth groaned. \"At times I swear you absolutely have not a brain in your head, Dave. And this is one of them. Radio, my little man. Radio!\"  Dave turned in the seat and gave Freddy a nasty stare.  \"All right, wise guy!\" he growled. \"Stop playing riddles, and out with it. What do you mean, radio?\"  \"The Jap radio!\" Freddy came right back at him fast. \"The radio _on that Kawanishi_ that you just shot down so expertly. Perhaps they sighted our task force and radioed word to their base before you put the lot of them out of commission. Now do you see?\"  Dave stiffened in the seat, let out a yelp, and clapped one hand to his forehead.  \"Knock me for an outside loop, am I dumb!\" he cried. \"Am I thick, and dumb, and stupid! Holy smokes, yes, Freddy! And I'm taking off my humble hat to you. That's right, pal. If they did sight our carrier task force and got word of it back to their base in time, then we certainly are off to a terrible start, and how. Jeepers! I wonder just how far from home that Kawanishi was?\"  \"We'll probably never know, but what does it matter?\" the English youth grunted. \"The point is, _did_ they get word back about the Hawk and the Carson, or didn't they? I bet Colonel Welsh and Admiral Jackson are having a few very bad moments right now. That Kawanishi business could turn everything upside down, you know. And worse luck, it probably will.\"  Dawson just nodded, and let it go at that as he gave his attention to getting back to the task force as quickly as he could. It was about fifteen minutes before they spotted the force on the horizon. And it was another ten before they were safely aboard the Carson, and a junior officer was leading them to the Admiral's quarters. They found Colonel Welsh there, too. And also the ship's executive flight officer. The Admiral took the salute, but it was Colonel Welsh who spoke to them.  \"Nice shooting,\" he said quietly. \"Now let's have your report in detail. Did the Jap see you approach, or did you get him before he realized what was happening?\"  Dave glanced at Freddy, got the sign to do the talking, and made a little gesture with one hand.  \"I'm afraid he saw us, sir,\" he replied. And then he reported in detail their flight from take-off to landing.  When he had finished a heavy silence hung over the Admiral's quarters. It was plain to see that the news was not what they had been hoping it would be. And after a few moments Admiral Jackson looked at Colonel Welsh, and sighed heavily.  \"Well, that changes our plans, I guess, Colonel,\" he said. \"The Japs must certainly know where we are, now, even though they don't know where we're heading. And by morning they're bound to have flocks of their long range planes out looking for us. That makes it not so good.\"  Colonel Welsh nodded in unhappy agreement and chewed on his lower lip.  \"Not good at all,\" he murmured. \"A rotten bit of luck right at the start. One hour sooner and we'd have been covered by darkness. But why talk about that now? He knows where we are, and so the next move is up to us. I'm afraid, Admiral, our only hope is to fall back on the substitute plan, and take our chances.\"  \"Confound that Kawanishi!\" Admiral Jackson grated, and banged a bunched fist on the desk top. \"Ten to one he was probably way off his patrol course, and just happened to bump into us by accident. Not the first time that sort of thing has happened, either. Yes, I guess you're right, Colonel. We've got to go back to the substitute plan, and pray. I'll inform the other carrier and the rest of the task force.\"  The Admiral sighed, shook his head in an unhappy gesture, and then looked at Dawson and Freddy Farmer.  \"Don't take any of the blame for the rotten luck, you two,\" he said with a faint smile. \"You did the best you could. At least it's something that they'll never go back to their base to report in detail. Very well, then, gentlemen. If you'll excuse me I'll give my orders to the signal officer.\"  The others took the \"hint\" and filed quickly out of the Admiral's quarters. Dawson and Freddy Farmer went down onto the flight deck and over to where crew men were checking over their Dauntless.  \"Any damage?\" Dave asked the"]]]
