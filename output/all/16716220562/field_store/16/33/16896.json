The enemy scattered out and swooped to meet them. Stan saw O'Malley drive straight over a One-Nine almost ramming the Jerry, and missing him clean with a burst of fire. That was not like O'Malley.  The Jerry banked and flipped over, thinking only of getting away before O'Malley cut back across him and sawed him in two parts; but O'Malley kept straight on. Stan picked up the One-Nine, scissoring off a wing tip and sending him wavering away toward the east.  Stan watched O'Malley as the wild Irishman zoomed up over a One-Ten. The Messerschmitt banked and tried to escape, but O'Malley was on him in a reckless roaring dive. Stan shot over the two and saw the Jerry spray O'Malley's ship with lead. Pieces of his hatch cover showered away like feathers from a potted duck. Again O'Malley missed a perfect burst and came up under the Jerry. He returned the compliment paid him by slicing the top off the Messerschmitt's hatch cover. Stan knew the miss had been deliberate. O'Malley never let one get away when he had a spot shot like that.  Then light dawned upon Stan. O'Malley was after the Jerry's gun. Allison was very busy himself and doing such a savage job that he was about to clear the air without Stan's help. Stan dived down to make the game one against one for Allison. When he came up, O'Malley was on the tail of the Messerschmitt and bawling at Allison:  \"By the shades of St. Patrick, you keep out of this!\"  The Jerry was hurt, but not badly, and O'Malley had him on the run. When the Jerry dived O'Malley was on his tail. He didn't shoot him down. When he dropped off on one wing, peeling away under full throttle, O'Malley had him covered. Then Stan heard the Irisher yelling at the Jerry pilot.  \"Leave that gun like she is, you spalpeen, or I'll send you to the fishes!\"  Apparently the Jerry did not understand what O'Malley said, possibly his radio wasn't set to pick up the transmitter of the Spitfire, but he did understand the short bursts of fire that clipped pieces out of various parts of his ship. He headed the way the lank Irishman pointed and drove ahead.  Allison and Stan dropped in behind, letting O'Malley have his prize. Stan called to Allison:  \"Somebody ought to tip off the Ack-Ack boys or O'Malley may get a warm reception.\"  \"Let him show his stuff,\" Allison drawled and Stan thought he heard the Flight Lieutenant chuckle.  The Messerschmitt ducked over the coast and down with O'Malley steering him expertly to the field. Bursts of gunfire began to blossom below and puffs of white smoke broke around the Jerry and his pursuer.  \"They think O'Malley's Spitfire is a captured plane with a Jerry in it,\" Stan muttered.  O'Malley sent his catch down through the shellfire, twisting and turning. The Nazi pilot was an expert and wiggled through until they got close in, then the fire got so hot he and O'Malley had to hit for the ceiling. They circled and were high up when Stan and Allison slid down the field.  Undaunted, O'Malley came in again and this time he sent his prize through the rain of exploding shells. The Messerschmitt rolled to a stop with O'Malley close behind him. In a moment the flustered Jerry was climbing out of his shattered hatch with his hands elevated above his head.  Ground men closed in around him, shouting and doing a war dance. O'Malley climbed out after removing part of the hatch cover from around his neck. He strode to the Messerschmitt and bellowed at the ground men.  \"Git ye a hump on yerselves an' pull out that fore gun!\"  Four mechanics raced away to get tools while O'Malley stood guard over his prize. He refused to let anyone touch the ship. A senior ground officer came hurrying up and O'Malley gave him a sloppy salute. The officer snapped:  \"I'll take charge here now.\"  \"Ye'll do nothing of the sort,\" O'Malley shouted. \"And as I live and breathe them's Wing Commander Farrell's very orders!\"  The officer looked at the wild-eyed O'Malley and decided it would be best to wait for reinforcements, possibly a Group Captain or an Air Commodore.  \"It's my job, you know, old man,\" he said but his tone had changed.  \"'Tis my job, me hearty,\" O'Malley assured him.  The mechanics arrived and in a few minutes the fore gun was on the ground at O'Malley's feet. It was so heavy he could not handle it. He turned to the grinning Stan who was standing beside Allison.  \"Lend a hand so we can deliver this gadget before sundown.\"  Stan and Allison stepped forward.  \"This is positively against regulations,\" the senior officer sputtered.  \"An' who, may I ask, bagged this here gun?\" O'Malley demanded. \"I may be bold, but I suggest ye give some attention to that Jerry waitin' over there to be captured accordin' to regulations.\"  The Jerry was standing with his arms still elevated. He was alone and unguarded.  \"And be lettin' O'Malley of Red Flight be knowin' where you put the bye. I aim to see that he has cigarettes and a few of the common comforts.\" O'Malley grinned at the Jerry. The youngster grinned back at him and saluted stiffly.  Dragging the gun between them, the three members of Red Flight stamped across the field and barged past a startled sentry who was walking post outside headquarters.  Wing Commander Farrell was just finishing a flight report. His gray eyes were hard and his mouth was drawn into a tight line. Coral Raid had dropped two bombers and three fighters. The credit side showed only one fighter and a Junkers. Farrell looked up and his eyes rested upon a lank and hungry-looking Irish youth. He stared at O'Malley for a long minute, then remembered him and his pie.  \"What do you want, Lieutenant?\" he snapped. \"I suppose you have that new enemy gun in your pocket.\"  His sarcasm was lost upon O'Malley. He grinned wolfishly as he stepped aside.  \"Indaid, an' I hope it's the latest model. I put a very good Jerry flier to a lot of trouble to be after fetchin' it to you.\"  The Wing Commander's eyes popped out as he stared at the machine Allison and Stan had dropped upon the floor. Suddenly he leaped out of his chair and charged around the desk. Getting down on his knees, he bent over the gun and examined it. When he straightened he was smiling.  \"So you are the wild Irishman we have been hearing about,\" he said. \"It would seem some rumors are correct in this war.\"  \"An' now, sor, I'll be running along,\" O'Malley said. \"I'm feelin' a bit o' the pinch of hunger.\"  \"Have two pies on my chit book,\" the Wing Commander said and smiled broadly.  \"Indaid, that I will,\" O'Malley answered gravely.  The three coal barge nurses returned to the briefing room and checked their chutes which had been discarded on the field. They found Lieutenant Garret waiting for them. He drew his mouth into a triumphant frown. Beside his desk lay the three chutes, neatly piled there by the field crew.  \"See those chutes?\" he snapped.  \"Sure, an' one of them gadgets is a personal friend o' mine,\" O'Malley said and grinned broadly.  \"I'm putting it down against you. You discarded them on the field without properly caring for them. That is a violation of general orders.\" Garret scowled at the Irish flier.  O'Malley leaned his elbows on the desk and regarded the officer thoughtfully.  \"Very remarkable, indaid,\" he said softly.  \"Red Flight reports two Dorniers and three Messerschmitts down and one captured,\" Allison said and his eyes locked with those of the briefing officer.  \"Red Flight gets credit for two Dorniers. The Royal Navy reported them. And one Messerschmitt brought in.\" Garret's eyes gleamed triumphantly.  \"Sure, an' are ye certain ye can give us one Messer?\" O'Malley asked. \"Perhaps the poor bye got himself lost an' mistook this berg for Berlin.\"  \"There is no independent check on the other fighters,\" Garret snapped.  Stan said nothing. He could not trust himself to speak. What he wanted to do was to lay a right on Garret's jaw.  \"You fellows better walk pretty straight from now on. And keep yourself looking like officers,\" Garret barked.  Without bothering to fill in a report, O'Malley shoved off to the mess room. Allison filled out his report and Stan made his out. They reported the exact action and the results. They left Garret scowling at their cards.  \"Wilson!\" Garret called sharply as Stan started to walk away at Allison's side. \"I want a word with you, alone.\"  Stan turned back and stood at the desk. His gaze locked with Garret's.  \"Have you ever flown stunts or test jobs in the United States?\" He leaned forward and his small eyes searched Stan's face.  Stan returned his stare. \"You have my card where you can dig it out. Suppose you take a look at it?\" Stan turned on his heel and walked away.  Garret let him go without asking any more questions, but he was shaking his head and frowning as though trying to remember something or somebody that had slipped his mind.  \"He's about got my number,\" Stan muttered to himself as he went into the mess.     CHAPTER VI  THE SEA DOGS GROWL   Stan stepped out of the barracks and stood for a moment watching the scene on the field before the hangars. A row of Defiants had been rolled out. Men worked around them or scurried to and from the hangars. There was an uneasy feel about the scene. Stan scented action and a feeling of irritation filled him. Red Flight was on barge patrol when it should have been on combat. It was fools like Garret who messed up battle plans.  He was about to turn toward the mess division and had turned into the narrow alley leading to the building, when he halted and stepped back, close to the wall. Garret was coming out of the doorway of the mess and beside him walked a tall man. The man had a lean, weathered face with a scar across the right cheek. He wore a checked suit and a pearl-gray hat with a broad brim. The hat could have come from no place but the western part of the United States.  Stan recognized him at once as Charles L. Milton. He didn't have to guess twice why Garret had him in hand and why"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],["title","A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#0)"],["body","TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:  This text version uses the UTF-8 Unicode character set.

RAYMOND HALL   The most popular small game mammal in nearly every part of North America is one or another of the species of rabbits or hares. The rabbit is one of the few species of wild game that still is hunted commercially and sold for food on the open market. The close association and repeated contact of man with these animals has resulted in his contracting such of their diseases as are transmissible to him. Consequently the rabbits and hares have figured in many investigations concerned with public health and medicine. Because the number of such investigations is increasing, there has been an increasing number of specimens of these animals submitted to mammalogists for identification; also, inquiries are received as to the degree of relationship between two or more of the named kinds of rabbits in which identical, or closely related, disease organisms have been found; other inquiries have to do with the degree of relationship of named kinds of rabbits and hares in widely separated parts of the continent.  The monographs to which the investigator could turn to obtain answers to some of these questions are Arthur H. Howell's \"Revision of the American Pikas\" (1924), and Edward H. Nelson's \"The Rabbits of North America\" (1909) published 27 and 42 years ago, respectively. These monographs are still excellent sources of detailed information, as, of course, also is Marcus Ward Lyon's \"Classification of the Hares and their Allies\" (1904). The acquisition of additional study specimens in recent years, however, has provided new data on the geographic occurrence of several species, and study of these specimens has given basis for a different arrangement of several named kinds of the lagomorphs. Two principal aims of the present synopsis, therefore, are to combine in one publication the current taxonomic arrangement and as much as is known of the geographic distribution of the several species and subspecies.  The maps herewith and listings of marginal localities are the means chosen to present the information on geographic distribution. The artificial key is supplemented by line drawings of skulls of certain species and by a minimum of text to aid the user of the key. The skulls are necessary for the identification of some species of the genus _Sylvilagus_. The skins, on the contrary, are essential for the identification of the species of the genus _Lepus_ in central Mexico and in the Great Basin of the western United States. Consequently, it has been impossible to construct a key based on external characters only or on cranial features only. Furthermore, the only apparent differences between a given pair of species in one region may not be apparent in another region where the same two species occur together. A case in point is provided by _Sylvilagus floridanus_ and _Sylvilagus nuttallii_ where the Great Plains meet the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains and where the Sonoran desert meets the southwestern flank of these mountains. The details are described by Hall and Kelson (1951:52, 53) and are indicated in the part of the accompanying artificial key that takes out the species _Sylvilagus nuttallii_. Because of this geographic change in specific characters and because of the slight amount of difference between certain species of leporids, I have frequently resorted to geography, instead of to morphology alone, in constructing the artificial key. Despite this fault of the key to the lagomorphs, it, and the accompanying account, I hope, will aid workers who need to identify kinds of lagomorphs and to know about their geographic distribution.  Another reason for presenting a synopsis of the lagomorphs at this time is that the presentation may bring suggestions for improvement in the arrangement of the kind of information presented here; an account along similar lines for all of the kinds of mammals native to North America is in prospect. Corrections of, and additions to, the material presented here will be welcomed and I shall be especially grateful for suggestions as to a more useful arrangement of the data.  In arranging the families, genera and species the aim has been, in each category, to list the most primitive members first and to list last the one which presents the highest total of specialization. The term _total of specialization_ is used here, as Miller (1924:2) used it, to denote the sum of the physical modifications which any mammal, or taxonomic category of mammals, is supposed by the author to have undergone during the course of its development away from its original or generalized mammalian stock.  Subspecies of any one species are arranged alphabetically. On the maps, of course, the subspecies are shown in their correct geographic positions.  For each subspecies, or species if it has not been divided into subspecies, there is given (1) the accepted scientific name (selected in accordance with the rules of the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature); (2) a citation to the account in which the terminal part of the name was first proposed (the original description of zoological parlance) followed by a statement of the type locality; (3) a citation to the account in which the combination of "]]]
