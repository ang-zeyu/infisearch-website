Two, three, four days passed and he refused all food.  Then his wife Hispulla sent our mutual friend Caius Geminius to tell me the sad news that Corellius had determined to die, that he was not moved by the entreaties of his wife and daughter, and that I was the only one left who might possibly recall him to life.  I flew to see him, and had almost reached the house when Hispulla sent me another message by Julius Atticus, saying that now even I could do nothing, for his resolve had become more and more fixed.  When the doctor offered him nourishment he said, \"My mind is made up,\" and the word has awakened within me not only a sense of loss, but of admiration.  I keep thinking what a friend, what a manly friend is now lost to me.  He was at the end of his seventy-sixth year, an age long enough even for the stoutest of us.  True.  He has escaped a lifelong illness; he has died leaving children to survive him, and knowing that the State, which was dearer to him than everything else beside, was prospering well.  Yes, yes, I know all this.  And yet I grieve at his death as I should at the death of a young man in the full vigour of life; I grieve--you may think me weak for so doing--on my own account too.  For I have lost, lost for ever, the guide, philosopher, and friend of my life.  In short, I will say again what I said to my friend Calvisius, when my grief was fresh:  \"I am afraid I shall not live so well ordered a life now.\"  Send me a word of sympathy, but do not say, \"He was an old man, or he was infirm.\" These are hackneyed words; send me some that are new, that are potent to ease my trouble, that I cannot find in books or hear from my friends. For all that I have heard and read occur to me naturally, but they are powerless in the presence of my excessive sorrow.  Farewell.   1.XIII.--TO SOSIUS SENECIO.  This year has brought us a fine crop of poets:  right through April hardly a day passed without some recital or other.  I am delighted that literature is so flourishing and that men are giving such open proofs of brains, even though audiences are found so slow in coming together. People as a rule lounge in the squares and waste the time in gossip when they should be listening to the recital.  They get some one to come and tell them whether the reciter has entered the hall yet, whether he has got through his introduction, or whether he has nearly reached the end of his reading.  Not until then do they enter the room, and even then they come in slowly and languidly.  Nor do they sit it out; no, before the close of the recital they slip away, some sidling out so as not to attract attention, others rising openly and walking out boldly.  And yet, by Hercules, our fathers tell a story of how Claudius Caesar one day, while walking up and down in the palace, happened to hear some clapping of hands, and on inquiring the cause and being told that Nonianus was giving a reading, he suddenly joined the company to every one's surprise.  But nowadays even those who have most time on their hands, after receiving early notices and frequent reminders, either fail to put in an appearance, or if they do come they complain that they have wasted a day just because they have not wasted it.  All the more praise and credit, therefore, is due to those who do not allow their love of writing and reciting to be damped either by the laziness or the fastidiousness of their audiences.  For my own part, I have hardly ever failed to attend.  True, the authors are mostly my friends, for almost all the literary people are also friends of mine, and for this reason I have spent more time in Rome than I had intended.  But now I can betake myself to my country retreat and compose something, though not for a public recital, lest those whose readings I attended should think I went not so much to hear their works as to get a claim on them to come and hear mine.  As in everything else, if you lend a man your ears, all the grace of the act vanishes if you ask for his in return.  Farewell.   1.XIV.--TO JUNIUS MAURICUS.  You ask me to look out for a husband for your brother's daughter, and you do well to select me for such a commission.  For you know how I looked up to him, and what an affection I had for his splendid qualities; you know, too, what good advice he gave me in my salad days, and how by his warm praises he actually made it appear that I deserved them.  You could not have given me a more important commission or one that I should be better pleased to undertake, and there is no charge that I could possibly accept as a greater compliment to myself than that of being set to choose a young man worthy of being the father of grandchildren to Arulenus Rusticus.  I should have had to look carefully and long, had it not been that Minucius Acilianus was ready to hand,-- one might almost say that Providence had prepared him for the purpose. He has for me the close and affectionate regard of one young man for another--for he is only a few years younger than myself--yet at the same time he pays me the deference due to a man of years, for he is as anxious that I should mould and form his character as I used to be that you and your son should mould mine.  His native place is Brixia, a part of that Italy of ours which still retains and preserves much of the old- fashioned courtesy, frugality and even rusticity.  His father, Minucius Macrinus, was one of the leaders of the Equestrian order, because he did not wish to attain higher rank; he was admitted by the divine Vespasian to Praetorian rank, and to the end of his days preferred this modest and honourable distinction to the--what shall I say?--ambitions or dignities for which we strive.  His grandmother on his mother's side was Serrana Procula, who belonged to the township of Patavia.  You know the character of that place--well, Serrana was a model of austere living even to the people of Patavia.  His uncle was Publius Acilius, a man of almost unique weight, judgment, and honour.  In short, you will find nothing in the whole of his family which will fail to please you as much as if the family were your own.  As for Acilianus himself, he is an energetic and untiring worker, and the very pink of courtesy.  He has already acquitted himself with great credit in the quaestorship, tribunate, and praetorship, and so he has thus spared you the trouble of having to canvass in his behalf.  He has a frank, open countenance, fresh-coloured and blooming; a handsome, well-made figure, and an air that would become a senator.  These are points which, in my opinion, are not to be neglected, for I regard them as meet rewards to a girl for her chastity.  I don't know whether I should add that his father is a well-to-do man, for when I think of you and your brother for whom we are looking out for a son-in-law, I feel disinclined to speak of money.  On the other hand, when I consider the prevailing tendencies of the day and the laws of the state which lay such prominent stress upon the matter of income, I think it right not to overlook the point.  Moreover, when I remember the possible issue of the marriage, I feel that in choosing a bridegroom one must take his income into account.  Perhaps you will imagine that I have let my affection run away with me, and that I have exaggerated my friend's merits beyond their due.  But I pledge you my word of honour that you will find his virtues to be far in excess of my description of them.  I have the most intense affection for the young man, and he deserves my love, but it is one of the proofs of a lover that you do not overburden the object of your regard with praise.  Farewell.   1.XV.--TO SEPTICIUS CLARUS.  What a fellow you are!  You promise to come to dinner and then fail to turn up!  Well, here is my magisterial sentence upon you.  You must pay the money I am out of pocket to the last farthing, and you will find the sum no small one.  I had provided for each guest one lettuce, three snails, two eggs, spelt mixed with honey and snow (you will please reckon up the cost of the latter as among the costly of all, since it melts away in the dish), olives from Baetica, cucumbers, onions, and a thousand other equally expensive dainties.  You would have listened to a comedian, or a reciter, or a harp-player, or perhaps to all, as I am such a lavish host.  But you preferred to dine elsewhere,--where I know not--off oysters, sow's matrices, sea-urchins, and to watch Spanish dancing girls!  You will be paid out for it, though how I decline to say.  You have done violence to yourself.  You have grudged, possibly yourself, but certainly me, a fine treat.  Yes, yourself!  For how we should have enjoyed ourselves, how we should have laughed together, how we should have applied ourselves!  You can dine at many houses in better style than at mine, but nowhere will you have a better time, or such a simple and free and easy entertainment.  In short, give me a trial, and if afterwards you do not prefer to excuse yourself to others rather than to me, why then I give you leave to decline my invitations always. Farewell.   1.XVI.--TO ERUCIUS.  I used to be very fond of Pompeius Saturninus--our Saturninus, as I may call him--and to admire his intellectual powers, even before I knew him; they were so varied, so supple, so many-sided; but now I am devoted to him body and soul.  I have heard him pleading in the Courts, always keen and empassioned, and his addresses are as polished and graceful when they are impromptu as when they have been carefully prepared.  He has a never-failing flow of apt sentiment; his style is weighty and dignified, his language is of the sonorous, classical school.  All these qualities charm me immensely when they come pouring forth in a streaming rush of eloquence, and they charm me too when I read them in book form.  You will experience the same pleasure as I do when you take "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3234"],["title","The Letters of the Younger Pliny, First Series — Volume 1 (#8)"],["body","up, and you will at once compare them with some one of the old masters whose rival indeed he is.  You will find even greater charm in the style of his historical compositions, in its terseness, its lucidity, smoothness, brilliancy and stateliness, for there is the same vigour in the historical harangues as there is in his own orations, only rather more compressed, restricted, and epigrammatic.  Moreover, he writes verses that Catullus or Calvus might have composed. They are positively brimming over with grace, sweetness, irony and love. He occasionally, and of set design, interpolates among these smooth and easy-flowing verses others cast in a more rugged mould, and here again he is like Catullus and Calvus.  A little while ago he read me some letters which he declared had been written by his wife.  I thought, on hearing them, that they were either Plautus or Terence in prose, and whether they were composed, as he said, by his wife or by himself, as he denies, his credit is the same.  It belongs to him either as the actual author of the letters or as the teacher who has made such a polished and learned lady of his wife--whom he married when she was a girl.  So I pass the whole day in the company of Saturninus.  I read him before I set pen to paper; I read him again after finishing my writing, and again when I am at leisure.  He is always the same but never seems the same. Let me urge and beg of you to do likewise, for the fact that the author is still alive ought not to be of any detriment to his works.  If he had been a contemporary of those on whom we have never set eyes, we should not only be seeking to procure copies of his books but also asking for busts of him.  Why then, as he is still amongst us, should his credit and popularity dwindle, as though we were tired of him?  Surely it is discreditable and scandalous that we should not give a man the due he richly deserves, simply because we can see him with our own eyes, speak to him, hear him, embrace him, and not only praise but love him. Farewell.   1.XVII.--TO CORNELIUS TITIANUS.  Faith and loyalty are not yet extinct among men:  there are still those to be found who keep friendly remembrances even of the dead.  Titinius Capito has obtained permission from our Emperor to erect a statue of Lucius Silanus in the Forum.  It is a graceful and entirely praiseworthy act to turn one's friendship with a sovereign to such a purpose, and to use all the influence one possesses to obtain honours for others.  But Capito is a devoted hero-worshipper; it is remarkable how religiously and enthusiastically he regards the busts of the Bruti, the Cassii, and the Catos in his own house, where he may do as he pleases in this matter.  He even composes splendid lyrics on the lives of all the most famous men of the past.  Surely a man who is such an intense admirer of the virtue of others must know how to exemplify a crowd of virtues in his own person.  Lucius Silanus quite deserved the honour that has been paid to him, and Capito in seeking to immortalise his memory has immortalised his own quite as much.  For it is not more honourable and distinguished to have a statue of one's own in the Forum of the Roman People than to be the author of some one else's statue being placed there.  Farewell.   1.XVIII.--TO SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS.  You say in your letter that you have been troubled by a dream, and are afraid lest your suit should go against you.  So you ask me to try and get it postponed, and that I will have to put it off for a few days, or at least for one day.  It is not an easy matter, but I will do my best, for, as Homer says, \"A dream comes from Zeus.\"  However, it makes all the difference whether your dreams usually signify the course of future events or their opposite.  When I think over a certain dream I once had, what causes you fear seems to me to promise a splendid termination to your case.  I had undertaken a brief for Julius Pastor, when there appeared to me in my sleep a vision of my mother-in-law, who threw herself on her knees before me and begged that I would not plead.  I was quite a young man at the time of the action, which was to be heard in the Fourfold Court, and I was appearing against the most powerful men of the State, including some of the Friends of Caesar.  All these things or any one of them might well have shattered my resolution after such an ominous dream.  Nevertheless, I went on with the case, remembering the well-known line of Homer:  \"But one omen is best, to fight on behalf of one's country.\"  For in my case the keeping of my word seemed to me as important as fighting on behalf of my country or as any other still more pressing consideration--if any consideration more pressing can be imagined.  Well, the action went off successfully, and it was the way that I conducted that case which got me a hearing with men and opened the door to fame.  So I advise you to see whether you too cannot turn your dream, as I did mine, to a prosperous issue, or if you think that it is safer to follow the well-known proverb:  \"Never do anything if you feel the least hesitation,\" write and tell me so.  I will invent some excuse or other, and will so arrange matters that you can have your suit brought on when you like.  For, after all, your position is not the same as mine was; a trial before the Centumvir's Court cannot be postponed on any consideration, but an action like yours can be, although it is rather difficult to arrange.  Farewell.   1.XIX.--TO ROMANUS FIRMUS.  You and I were born in the same township, we went to school together, and shared quarters from an early age; your father was on terms of friendship with my mother and my uncle, and with me--as far as the disparity in our years allowed.  These are overwhelming reasons why I ought to advance you as far as I can along the path of dignities.  The fact of your being a decurio in our town shows that you have an income of a hundred thousand sesterces, and so, that we may have the pleasure of enjoying your society not only as a decurio, but as a Roman knight, I offer you 300,000 numm., to make up the equestrian qualification.  The length of our friendship is sufficient guarantee that you will not forget this favour, and I do not even urge you to enjoy with modesty the dignity which I thus enable you to attain, as perhaps I ought, just because I know you will do so without any urging from without.  People ought to guard an honour all the more carefully, when, in so doing, they are taking care of a gift bestowed by the kindness of a friend. Farewell.   1.XX.--TO CORNELIUS TACITUS.  I am constantly having arguments with a friend of mine who is a learned and practised speaker, but who admires in pleading nothing so much as brevity.  I allow that brevity ought to be observed, if the case permits of it; but sometimes it is an act of collusion to pass over matters that ought to be mentioned, and it is even an act of collusion to run briefly and rapidly over points which ought to be dwelt upon, to be thoroughly driven home, and to be taken up and dealt with more than once.  For very often an argument acquires strength and weight by being handled at some length, and a speech ought to be impressed on the mind, not by a short, sharp shock, but by measured blows, just as a sword should be used in dealing with the body of an opponent.  Thereupon he plies me with authorities, and flourishes before me the speeches of Lysias among the Greeks, and those of the Gracchi and Cato from among Roman orators.  The majority of these are certainly characterised by conciseness and brevity, but I quote against Lysias the examples of Demosthenes, Aeschines, Hyperides, and a multitude of others, while against the Gracchi and Cato I set Pollio, Caesar, Caelius, and, above all, Marcus Tullius, whose longest speech is generally considered to be his best. And upon my word, as with all other good things, the more there is of a good book, the better it is.  You know how it is with statues, images, pictures, and the outlines of many animals and even trees, that if they are at all graceful nothing gives them a greater charm than size.  It is just the same with speeches,--even the mere volumes themselves acquire a certain additional dignity and beauty from mere bulk.  These are but a few of the many arguments I usually employ to establish my point; but there is no pinning my friend down in an argument.  He is such a slippery fellow that he wriggles off the pin and declares that these same orators, whose speeches I instance, spoke at less length than their published addresses seem to show.  I hold the contrary to be the case, and there are many speeches of many orators in favour of my opinion, as, for example, the Pro Murena and the Pro Vareno of Cicero, in which he indicates by side-heads alone, and quite barely and briefly, how he dealt with certain charges against his clients.  From these it is clear that he actually spoke at much greater length and left out a considerable number of passages when he published the addresses.  Cicero indeed says that in his defence of Cluentius \"he had simply followed the ancient custom and compressed his whole case into a peroration,\" and that in defending Caius Cornelius \"he had pleaded for four days.\"  Hence it cannot be questioned that after speaking somewhat discursively for several days, as he was bound to do, he subsequently trimmed and revised his oration and compressed it into a single book--a long one, it is true, but yet a single book.  But, argues my friend, a good indictment is a different thing from a good speech.  I know some people hold that view, but I--of course I may be wrong--feel persuaded that though it is possible to have a good indictment without a good speech, it is not possible for a good speech not to be a good indictment.  For a speech is the exemplar of an indictment--one might even call it its archetype.  Hence in every first- class oration we find a thousand extempore"]]]
