P. PUTNAM'S SONS                The Knickerbocker Press, New York     PREFACE   This book has been designed with a view to meet an extensive demand for definite data on the subject of Soured Milks. The author has had this matter brought before him, times without number, by those inquiring for authentic information on the subject, and he has therefore considered it desirable to gather together such information as is available in connection with ancient and modern practice. He has endeavoured to present this to the reader in concise form.  The author is indebted to many friends for their assistance in getting the book together, and would specially mention Dr. H. B. Hutchinson, Bacteriologist, Rothamsted Experimental Station, for assistance in connection with the bacteriology of fermented milks; Mr. Thomas Douglas, of Wimbledon, who has assisted with the chemistry of the subject; Mr. S. Javrilovitch, of Belgrade, Servia, for local information and illustrations; Dr. Otokar Laxa, Bacteriologist, of Prague, Bohemia, for general assistance; the editor of _Bacteriotherapy_, New York, U.S.A., for the use of the group of illustrations 30-44; the publishers of the _Centralblatt für Bakteriologie_, Jena, for the group of illustrations 14-29; and many others, some of whom are referred to in the text.

There is a good deal of evidence to show that in Paleolithic and Neolithic times, cattle were part of the possessions of the nomadic races; and, according to the Vedas, the manufacture of butter was known in India 1500 years B.C.  In the eastern part of Europe, milk has always been looked upon as one of the principal kinds of food, but not necessarily the milk of cows, as, from ancient times to the present day, the milk from camels, buffaloes, sheep, and goats has been used indiscriminately throughout the East.  According to Layard,[1] \"the Bedouins do not make cheese. The milk of their sheep and goats is shaken into butter or turned into curds; it is rarely or never drunk fresh, new milk being thought very unwholesome, as soon by experience I found it to be, in the desert. I have frequently had occasion to describe the process of making butter by shaking the milk in skins. This is also an employment confined to women, and one of a very laborious nature. The curds are formed by boiling the milk, and then putting some curds made on the previous day into it and allowing it to stand. When the sheep no longer give milk, some curds are dried, to be used as a leaven on a future occasion. This preparation, called _leben_, is thick and acid, but very agreeable and grateful to the taste in a hot climate. The sour milk, or _sheneena_, a universal beverage amongst the Arabs, is either buttermilk pure and diluted, or curds mixed with water.    [Illustration: THE PASS OF BUKOVA.—During the revolution   of 1904, a number of Turkish soldiers, just before   traversing this pass, were given coffee containing \"café\"   by a Bulgarian coffee-seller, or keeper of a small khan.   Whilst in the pass the poison began to take effect, and   they realized that they had been poisoned. Fortunately for   them, a peasant with three horses loaded with Yoghourt   (soured milk) had taken advantage of their escort. The   soldiers ate freely of the Yoghourt, which counteracted   the effects of the poison.]  \"The camel's milk is drunk fresh. It is pleasant to the taste, rich, and exceedingly nourishing. It is given in large quantities to the horses. The Shammar and Aneyza Bedouins have no cows or oxen, those animals being looked upon as the peculiar property of tribes who have forgotten their independence, and degraded themselves by the cultivation of land. The sheep are milked at dawn, or even before daybreak, and again in the evening on their return from the pastures. The milk is immediately turned into leben, or boiled to be shaken into butter. Amongst the Bedouins and Jebours it is considered derogatory to the character of a man to milk a cow or sheep, but not to milk the camel. The Sheikhs occasionally obtain dates from the cities. They are eaten dry with bread and leben, or fried in butter, a very favourite dish of the Bedouin....\"  The practice is now the same as it was in scriptural times, when milk was looked upon as the principal article of diet, and throughout the Scriptures there are copious references to milk in different forms, some of which are of peculiar interest at the present day.  It may be noticed, for example, that milk is absent from the sacred offerings amongst the Hebrews, and this was ascribed by the late Professor Robertson Smith to the fact that all ferments were excluded from presentation at the altar,[2] it being recognised that, owing to the hot climate, milk of all kinds became rapidly sour, and in this way came to be looked upon as only fit for consumption when in that condition. It has been suggested that the prohibition referred to is on the same level as the prohibition of the use of blood, \"as milk has sometimes been regarded as a kind of equivalent for blood, and containing the sacred life.\"[3] To this day the wandering tribes of Arabia consider the milk of their camels and flocks more refreshing when it has been slightly fermented or soured by being poured into a milk-skin on the inside of which are still sticking sour clots from the previous milking, and there shaken for a brief period; but this slightly soured milk (the _Oxygala_ of Pliny) is known widely in the East simply as leben (milk). The name is also applied to what we term buttermilk.[4]    [Illustration: KABYLES SOURING MILK    In the north of Africa the use of soured milk is common,   and the illustration shows Kabyles shaking a skin full of   milk so as to sour it. The skin has previously been used   for the same operation, and, as a consequence, clots of   milk are left from the previous day's use, and thus   fermentation is set up.]  The use of milk-skins for the carrying of milk is not confined to one country, as, while it is common all over the north of Africa, it is also known in the Pyrenees and in some parts of the Balkan Peninsula, the object being identical in each case; and when it is intended to make butter from the milk, the skin is simply rocked between the knees until the butter separates, a process of butter-making which was also used after the introduction of earthenware churns.[5] Dried soured milk is also used by the Arabs, and it is reconstituted when required by rubbing it up with a little water, and it is known as _Meeresy_.[6] The ordinary soured milk is the common article of diet, and is looked upon as being necessary at every meal, and travellers frequently refer to the use of this product, as a few references will show.  Charles G. Addison states: \"A supper was brought in on a round tray. In the centre was a huge pilaff of rice, and around it several small dishes of stewed meats, grilled bones, sour clotted milk called _yaoort_,[7] bits of meat roasted, etc....  \"We retired into a tent to breakfast, where we found an immense bowl of delicious fresh camels' milk, with thin hot cakes of unleavened bread, baked upon the ashes, ready prepared for us. The principal food of the Bedouins consists of flour and some camels' milk made into a paste, boiled, and eaten swimming in melted grease and butter; boiled wheat and beans dried in the sun and prepared with butter are a favourite dish. They are all remarkably fond of butter and grease; the butter is made in a goat-skin, suspended to the tent pole, and constantly shaken about by the women.\"[8]  Burckhardt[9] says: \"The provisions of my companion consisted only of flour; besides flour, I carried some butter and dried leben (sour milk), which would dissolve in water. It forms not only a refreshing beverage, but is much to be recommended as a preservative of health when travelling in summer. These are our only provisions.\" With regard to the inhabitants of the Houran, Burckhardt relates that the most common dishes of these people are _bourgoul_ and _keshk_. \"In summer they supply the place of the latter by milk, leben, and fresh butter. Of the bourgoul I have spoken on other occasions; there are two kinds of keshk—_keshk-hammer_ and _keshk-leben_. The first is prepared by putting leaven into the bourgoul and pouring water over it. It is then left until almost putrid, and afterwards spread out in the sun and dried, after which it is pounded, and, when called for, served up mixed with oil or butter. The keshk-leben is prepared by putting leben into the bourgoul instead of leaven; in other respects the process is the same. Keshk and bread are the common breakfasts. Towards sunset a plate of bourgoul, or some Arab dish, forms the dinner.\"  Again, Taylor[10] says: \"I received a small jug of thick buttermilk, not remarkably clean, but very refreshing.\"  These references particularly refer to the East, from which it would appear that soured milk was universally known in ancient times as it is at the present day, and this remark applies not only to Egypt, Palestine, and Arabia, but throughout Turkey and the Balkan States, where the consumption of soured milk is equally common. It seems curious that the use of this commodity should have been confined for centuries to the East, as we shall see later on that its dietetic value is so great that it is really a wonderful thing that no one has taken the trouble to introduce its use to the Western nations until quite recently.    [Illustration: THE HANDLING OF MILK IN THE PYRENEES    The handling of milk in the Pyrenees is, more especially   in the villages, conducted in goat or sheep skins, in a   similar way to the methods which prevail in Eastern   Europe, and the picture shows a skin of milk on a small   farm in the Pyrenees. The churning is very often performed   by simply rocking the skin between the knees, acidity   being induced by remnants of the previous day's milk;   souring of milk is induced by the same method.]  A curious example of how the virtues of such an article may be independently discovered by another nation is to be found in Lapland, where reindeer's milk is the article used. \"The reindeer's milk,\" says Acerbi,[11] \"constitutes a principal part of the Laplander's food, and he has two methods of preparing it, according to the season. In summer he boils the milk with sorrel till it arrives to a consistence; in this manner he preserves it for use during that short season. In winter the following is his method of preparation: The milk, which he collects in autumn till the beginning of November, from the reindeer, is put into casks, or whatever vessels he has, in which it soon turns sour, and, "]]]
