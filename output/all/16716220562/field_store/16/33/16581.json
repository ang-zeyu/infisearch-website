An enormous colic was raging around in his interior, and Si fairly howled with pain. He thought he was going: to die right away.  [Illustration: LAYING THE FOUNDATION 091 ]  \"Shorty,\" said he, between the gripes, to his comrade, \"I'm afeared I'm goin' to peter out. After I'm gone you write to--to--Annie and tell her I died for my country like a man. I'd ruther been shot than die with the colic, but I 'spose 'twont make much difference after it's all over!\" 9 \"I'll do it,\" replied Shorty. \"We'll plant you in good shape; and Si, we'll gather up the corn-cobs and build a monument over you!\"  But Si wasn't cut off in the bloom of youth by that colic. His eruptive condition frightened Shorty, however, and though he was in nearly as bad shape himself, he went up and routed out one of the doctors, who growled a good deal about being disturbed.  The debris of the supper scattered about the camp told him what was the matter, and he had no need to make a critical diagnosis of Si's case. He gave him a dose of something or other that made the pain let up a little, and Si managed to rub along through the night.  Fortunately for Si, and for more than half the members of the regiment, the army did not move next day, and the doctors had a good opportunity to get in their work.  At the usual hour in the morning the bugle blew the \"sick-call.\" A regiment of tanned and grizzled veterans from Ohio lay next to the 200th Ind., and as Si lay there he heard them take up the music:       \"Git yer qui-nine! Git yer qui-nine!      Tumble up you sick and lame and blind;      Git a-long right smart, you'll be left be-hind.\"  \"Fall in fer yer ipecac!\" shouted the Orderly of Co. Q. Si joined the procession and went wabbling up to the \"doctor's\" shop. He was better than he had been during the night, but still looked a good deal discouraged.  It was a regular matinee that day. The Surgeon and his assistants were all on hand, as the various squads, colicky and cadaverous, came to a focus in front of the tent.  [Illustration: A RUDE AWAKENING 093 ]  The doctors worked off the patients at a rapid rate, generally prescribing the same medicine for all, no matter what ailed them. This was the way the army doctors always did, but it happened in this case that they were not far wrong, as the ailments, arising from a common cause, were much the same.  Si waited till his turn came, and received his rations from the Hospital Steward. Of course, he was excused from duty for the day, and as he speedily recovered his normal condition he really had a good time.  [Illustration: VISITS THE DOCTOR 094 ]  A few days after this the whole regiment was ordered on fatigue duty to repair an old corduroy road. Si didn't want to go, and \"played off.\" He told the Orderly he wasn't able to work, but the Orderly said he would have to shoulder an ax or a shovel, unless he was excused by the doctor. He went up at sick-call and made a wry face, with his hands clasped over his body in the latitude of his waistband.  The doctor gave him a lot of blue-mass pills, which Si threw into the fire as soon as he got back to his quarters. Then he played seven-up all day with Shorty, who had learned before Si did how to get a day off when he wanted it.  Si thought it was a great scheme, but he tried it once too often. The doctor \"caught on,\" and said, the next time Si went up, that castor oil was what he needed to fetch him around. So he poured out a large dose and made Si take it right then and there.  The next time fatigue duty was ordered Si thought he felt well enough to go along with the boys.    CHAPTER XI. THE PLAGUE OP THE SOLDIER  INTRODUCTION TO \"ONE WHO STICKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER.\"  \"HELLO Si; goin' for a soljer, ain't ye?\"  \"You bet!\"  \"Wall, you'd better b'lieve its great fun; it's jest a picnic all the time! But, say, Si, let's see yer finger-nails!\"  \"I'd like ter know what finger-nails 's got to do with soljerin'!\" said Si. \"The 'cruitin' ossifer 'n' the man 't keeps the doctor shop made me shuck myself, 'n' then they 'xamined my teeth, 'n' thumped me in the ribs, 'n' rubbed down my legs, 'n' looked at my hoofs, same 's if 'I'd bin a hoss they wuz buyin', but they didn't say nothin' 'bout my finger-nails.\"  \"You jest do 's I tell ye; let 'em grow, 'n' keep 'em right sharp. Ye'll find plenty o' use fer 'em arter a while, 'n' 'twont be long, nuther. I know what I'm talkin' 'bout; I've been thar!\"  This conversation took place a day or two before Si bade farewell to his mother and sister Marier and pretty Annabel and left the peaceful precincts of Posey County to march away with the 200th Ind. for that awful place vaguely designated as \"the front!\" He had promptly responded to the call, and his name was near the top of the list of Company Q.  [Illustration: \"LET YER NAILS GROW; YE'LL NEED 'EM\" 097 ]  Si already had his blue clothes on. By enlisting early he had a good pick of the various garments, and so got a suit that fitted his form--which was plump as an apple-dumpling tolerably well. It was left for the tail-enders of the company to draw trousers that were six inches too long or too short, and blouses that either wouldn't reach around, and left yawning chasms in front, or were so large that they looked as if they were hung on bean-poles.  Of course, Si couldn't be expected to do any more plodding farm work, now that he had \"jined\" the army. While the company was filling up he spent most of his time on dress parade in the village near by, eliciting admiring smiles from all the girls, and an object of the profoundest awe and wonder to tha small boys.  One day Si was sitting on the sugar-barrel in the corner grocery, gnawing a \"blind robin,\" and telling how he thought the war wouldn't last long after the 200th Ind. got down there and took a hand and got fairly interested in the game; they would wind it up in short meter. Such ardent emotions always seethed and bubbled in the swelling breasts of the new troops when they came down to show the veterans just how to do it.  One of the town boys who had been a year in the service, had got a bullet through his arm in a skirmish, and was at home on furlough, came into the store, and then took place the dialog between him and Si that opens this chapter.  Si wondered a good deal what the veteran meant about the finger-nails. He did not even know that there existed in any nature a certain active and industrious insect which, before he had been in the army a great while, would cause his heart to overflow with gratitude to a beneficent Providence for providing him with nails on his fingers.  When the 200th left Indiana all the boys had, of course, brand-new outfits right from Uncle Sam's great one-price clothing house. Their garments were nice and clean, their faces well washed, and their hair yet showed marks of the comb. At Louisville they stuck up their noses, with a lofty consciousness of superiority, at the sight of Buell's tanned and ragged tramps, who had just come up on the gallop from Tennessee and northern Alabama.  [Illustration: \"SAY, CAP, WHAT KIND O' BUG IS THIS?\" 099 ]  If the new Hoosier regiment had been quartered for a while in long-used barracks, or had pitched its tents in an old camp, Si would very soon have learned, in the school of experience, the delightful uses of finger-nails. But the 200th stayed only a single night in Louisville and then joined the procession that started on the chase after the rebel army. It generally camped on new ground, and under these circumstances the insect to which allusion has been made did not begin its work of devastation with that suddenness that usually marked its attack upon soldiers entering the field. But he never failed to \"git there\" sooner or later, and it was more frequently sooner than later.  One afternoon, when a few days out on this march, a regiment of Wisconsin veterans bivouacked next to the 200th Ind. The strange antics as they threw off their accouterments attracted Si's attention.  \"Look a' thar,\" he said to Shorty. \"What 'n name of all the prophets 's them fellers up to?\"  \"Seems like they was scratchin' theirselves!\"  \"I s'pose that's on account of the dust 'n' sweat,\" said Si.  \"It's a mighty sight worse 'n that!\" replied Shorty, who knew more about these things than Si did. \"I reckon we'll all be doin' like they are 'fore long.\"  Si whistled softly to himself as he watched the Wisconsin boys. They were hitching and twisting their shoulders about, evidently enjoying the friction of the clothing upon their skins. There was a general employment of fingers, and often one would be seen getting come other fellow to scratch his back around where he couldn't reach himself. If everybody was too busy to do this for him he would back up to a tree and rub up and down against the bark.  Life has few pleasures that can equal the sensations of delightful enjoyment produced in those days, when graybacks were plenty, by rubbing against a tree that nicely fitted the hollow of the back, after throwing off one's \"traps\" at the end of a day's march.  Directly the Wisconsin chaps began to scatter into the woods. Si watched them as they got behind the trees and threw off their blouses and shirts. He thought at first that perhaps they were going in swimming, but there was no stream of water at hand large enough to justify this theory in explanation of their nudity. As each man set down, spread his nether garment over his knees and appeared to be intently engaged, with eyes and fingers. Si's curiosity was very much excited.  \"Looks 's if they wuz all mendin' up their shirts and sewin' on buttons,\" said Si, \"Guess it's part o' their regular drill, ain't it, Shorty?\"  Shorty laughed at Si's ignorant simplicity. He knew what those veterans were doing, and he knew that Si would have to come to it, but he didn't want to shock his tender sensibilities by telling him of it.  \"Them fellers ain't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31772"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 2 (#0)"],["body","KLEGG  THRU THE STONE RIVER CAMPAIGN AND IN WINTER QUARTERS AT MURFREESBORO.

TRYING TO EDUCATE ABRAHAM LINCOLN     PREFACE  \"Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., and Shorty, his Partner,\" were born years ago in the brain of John McElroy, Editor of THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE.  These sketches are the original ones published in THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE, revised and enlarged some what by the author. How true they are to nature every veteran can abundantly testify from his own service. Really, only the name of the regiment was invented. There is no doubt that there were several men of the name of Josiah Klegg in the Union Army, and who did valiant service for the Government. They had experiences akin to, if not identical with, those narrated here, and substantially every man who faithfully and bravely carried a musket in defense of the best Government on earth had some times, if not often, experiences of which those of Si Klegg are a strong reminder.  THE PUBLISHERS.      THIS BOOK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED  TO THE RANK AND FILE  OF THE GRANDEST ARMY EVER MUSTERED FOR WAR.     SI KLEOG    CHAPTER I. THROUGH MUD AND MIRE  DUTY'S PATH LEADS THE 200TH IND. SOUTHWARD FROM NASHVILLE.  \"SHORTY\" said Si Klegg, the morning after Christmas, 1862, as the 200th Ind. sullenly plunged along through the mud and rain, over the roads leading southward from Nashville, \"they say that this is to be a sure-enough battle and end the war.\"  \"Your granny's night-cap they do,\" answered Shorty crossly, as he turned his cap around back ward to stop the icy current from chasing down his backbone. \"How many thousand times 's that bin stuffed into your ears? This is the forty-thousandth mile we've marched to find that battle that was goin' to end the war. And I'll bet we'll march 40,000 more. This war ain't goin' to end till we've scuffed the top off all the roads in Kentucky and Tennessee, and wore out God's patience and all the sole-leather in the North. I believe it's the shoe-makers that's runnin' this war in the interest o' their business.\"  The cold, soaking rain had reduced the most of the 200th Ind. to a mood when they would have {16}disputed the Ten Commandments and quarreled with their mothers.  \"There's no use bein' crosser'n a saw-buck, if you are wet, Shorty,\" said Si, walking to the side of the road and scraping off his generous-sized brogans several pounds of stiff, red mud. \"They say this new General with a Dutch name is a fighter from Wayback, an' he always licks the rebels right out of their boots. I'm sure, I hope it's so. I like huntin' ez well ez anybody, an' I'll walk ez fur ez the next man to find something to shoot. But I think walkin' over two States, backward and forward, is altogether too much huntin' for so little shootin'. Don't you?\"  \"Don't worry,\" snapped Shorty. \"You'll git all the shootin' you want before your three years are up. It'll keep.\"  \"But why keep it so long?\" persisted Si. \"If it can be done up in three months, an' we kin git back home, why dribble it out over three years? That ain't the way we do work back home on the Wabash.\"  \"Confound back home on the Wabash,\" roared Shorty. \"I don't hear nothin' else, day and night, but 'back home on the Wabash.' I've bin on the Wabash, an' I don't want to never see the measly, muddy, agery ditch agin'. Why, they have the ager so bad out there that it shakes the buttons off a man's clothes, the teeth out of his head, the horns off the cows. An' as for milk-sickness.\"  \"Shorty!\" thundered Si, \"stop right there. If you wasn't my pardner I'd fight you this minute. I kin join in jawin' about the officers an' the {17}Government. A great deal of your slack that I can't agree with I kin put up with, but you mustn't say nothin' against my home in the Wabash Valley. That I won't stand from no man. For fear that I may lose my temper I'm goin' away from you till you're in better humor.\"  With that Si strode on ahead, feeling as cross and uncomfortable internally as he was ill-at-ease externally. He hated above all things to quarrel with Shorty, but the Wabash Valley, that gardenspot of earth, that place where lived his parents, and sister, and Annabel but the subject was too sore to think about.  Presently an Aid came galloping along the middle of the road, calling upon the men to make way for him. His horse's hoofs threw the mud in every direction, and Si caught a heavy spatter directly in his face.  \"Confound them snips of Aids,\" said he angrily, as he wiped the mud off. \"Put on more airs than if they was old Gen. Scott himself. Always pretend to be in such a powerful hurry. Everybody must hustle out of their way. I think that fool jest did that on purpose.\"  The rain kept pouring down with tormenting persistence. Wherever Si looked were drenched, de pressed-looking men; melancholy, steaming horses; sodden, gloomy fields; yellow, rushing streams, and boundless mud that thousands of passing feet were churning into the consistency of building-mortar.  Si had seen many rainy days since he had been in the army, but this was the first real Winter rain {18}he had been out in.  Jabe Belcher, the most disagreeable man in Co. Q, was just ahead of him. He stepped into a mudpuddle, slipped, threw the mud and water over Si, and his gun, which he flung in the effort to save himself, struck Si on the shoulder.  [Illustration: THE AID SPATTERS MUD ON SI 18]  \"Clumsy lunkhead!\" roared Si, as ill-tempered now as anybody. \"Couldn't you see that puddle and keep out of it? You'd walk right into the Cumberland River if it was in front of you. Never saw such a bat-eyed looney in my life.\"  \"If the Captain wasn't lookin',\" retorted Belcher, \"I'd shut up both of them dead-mackerel eyes o' your'n, you backwoods yearlin'. I'll settle with you after we git into camp. Your stripes won't save you.\"  \"Never mind about my stripes, old Stringhalt. I kin take them off long enough to wallop you.\"  Si was in such a frame of mind that his usual open-eyedness was gone. The company was wading across a creek, and Si plunged in without a thought. He stepped on a smooth stone, his feet went from under him and he sat 'down hard and waist-deep in much the coldest water that he ever remembered.  \"O, Greenland's icy mountains,\" was all that he could think to say.  The other boys yelled:  \"Come on to camp, Si. That's no place to sit down.\"  \"Feet hurt, Si, and goin' to rest a little?\"  \"This your day for taking a bath, Si?\"  \"Thinks this is a political meetin', and he's to take the chair.\"  \"Place Rest!\"  \"When I sit down, I prefer a log or a rail; but some men's different.\"  \"See a big bass there, Si, an' try to ketch him by settin' down on him?\"  \"Git up, Si; git up, an' give your seat to some lady.\"  [Illustration: SI SAT DOWN HARD 20]  Si was too angry to notice their jibes. He felt around in the icy water for his gun, and clambered out on the bank. He first poured the water out of his gun-barrel and wiped the mud off. His next thought was the three days' rations he had drawn {20}that morning. He opened his haversack, and poured out the water it had caught. With it went his sugar, coffee and salt. His hardtack was a pasty mess; his meat covered with sand and dirt. He turned the haversack inside out, and swashed it out in the stream.  Back came Capt. McGillicuddy, with water streaming from the down-turned rim of his hat, and his humor bad. He was ignorant of Si's mishap.  \"Corporal Klegg, what are you doing back here? Why aren't you in your place? I've been looking all around for you. The company wagon's stalled back somewhere. That spavin-brained teamster's at his old tricks. I want you to take five men off the rear of the company, go back and find that wagon, and bring it up. Be smart about it.\"  \"Captain,\" remonstrated Si, \"I'm wetter'n a drowned rat!\"  \"Well, who in thunder ain't?\" exploded the Captain. \"Do I look as dry as a basket of chips? Am I walking around in a Panama and linen clothes? Did you expect to keep from getting your feet wet when you came into the army? I want none of your belly-aching or sore-toeing. You take five men and bring up that wagon in a hurry. Do you hear me?\"  And the Captain splashed off through the red mud to make somebody else still more miserable.  Si picked up his wet gun from the rain-soaked sod, put it under his streaming overcoat, ordered the five drenched, dripping, dejected boys near him to follow, and plunged back into the creek, which had by this time risen above his knees. He was past the stage of anger now. He simply wished that he was dead and out of the whole business. A nice, dry grave on a sunny hillock in Posey County, with a good roof over it to keep out the rain, would be a welcome retreat.  In gloomy silence he and his squad plodded back through the eternal mud and the steady downpour, through the miry fields, through the swirling yellow floods in the brooks and branches, in search of the laggard company wagon.{22}  Two or three miles back they came upon it, stuck fast in a deep mud-hole.
