The yellow haze had become so thick that they seemed to be at the bottom of a custard cup.  [Illustration]  \"I do hope we're heading the right way,\" Professor Bernardi said, _although who knows what is right and what is wrong any more_?  \"Perhaps we aren't,\" Mrs. Bernardi mused, stroking Algol, who had crawled into her lap. \"Perhaps we will go drifting along endlessly. Every sixteen days, it will get dark and every sixteen days it will get light, and meanwhile we will continue floating along, never going anywhere, never getting anywhere, never seeing anything but haze and raft and river and each other.\" Algol wheezed in his sleep.  \"Nonsense!\" Jrann-Pttt said rudely. \"I have a compass. I know the direction perfectly well.\"  \"And yet you let us think we were wandering about blindly.\" Miss Anspacher gave him a contemptuous look. The captain pressed her hand.  \"Since you seem to breathe the same air and eat much the same food that we do, Mr. Pitt,\" Mrs. Bernardi changed her tack, \"I suppose we'll be physically comfortable on your planet for the rest of our lives. Our children will be born there and our children's children, and eventually they'll forget all about Earth and think it was only a legend.\"  \"But you did expect to settle permanently on Venus, didn't you?\" the vine asked, bewilderedly. \"Or for a long visit, anyway. So I don't really see that it makes much difference if you go to Jrann-Pttt's Alpha Centauri place. So much nicer to be living with friends, I should think.\"  \"But Alpha Centauri is so very far away,\" Mrs. Bernardi sighed. \"There wouldn't be much chance of our ever getting back.\"  \"Look!\" Mortland exclaimed. \"The river's branching. Which fork do we take?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jrann-Pttt, who had been dabbling his arms idly in the translucent violet-blue water, withdrew them hastily as nine green eyes, obviously belonging to the same individual, rose to the surface and regarded him with more than casual interest. He consulted his compass. \"Left.\"  \"Contrarily!\" the mosquito-bat suddenly squeaked, pointing a small rod at his companions. \"Rightward.\"  There was a stunned silence.  \"Monster!\" Mortland cried in reproach. \"You can talk! How could you deceive us like that?\"  \"Can talk,\" the creature retorted. \"Me not intelligent life-form, ha! Who talks last talks best. Have not linguistic facility of inferior life-forms, but can communicate rudely in your language.\"  \"Remember,\" Mortland cautioned, \"there are ladies present.\"  \"Have been lying low and laughing to self--ha, ha!--at witlessness of lowerly life-forms.\"  \"But why?\" Mrs. Bernardi demanded distractedly. \"Haven't we been kind to you?\"  \"You be likewise well treated in our zoo,\" it assured her. \"All of you. Our zoo finest in Galaxy. And clean, too.\"  \"Now really, sir, I must protest--\" Professor Bernardi began, trying to extricate a blaster unobtrusively from the pile of gear in which the too-confident terrestrials had cached their weapons.  Monster gestured with his rod. \"This is lethal weapon. Do not try hindrancing me. Hate damage fine specimens. Captain, go rightward.\"  \"Oh, is that so!\" Greenfield retorted hotly. \"Let me tell you, you--you insect!\"  \"George!\" Miss Anspacher clutched his arm. \"Do what it says. For my sake, George!\"  \"Oh, all right,\" he muttered. \"Just for you, then. Told you not to trust any of 'em,\" he went on, reluctantly poling the raft in the ordered direction. \"Foreigners!\"  \"Fine zoo,\" the mosquito-bat insisted. \"Very clean. Run with utmost efficientness. Strict visiting hours.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"And there goes Plan D,\" the vine said lightly. There was a hint of laughter in its voice. Jrann-Pttt stared at it in consternation. \"Are you also from the Alpha Centauri system, sir?\" It turned its attention to the mosquito-bat. \"Naturally I'm curious to know where I'm going,\" it explained, \"since I seem definitely to be included in your gracious invitation.\"  \"Alpha Centauri, hah!\" the mosquito-bat snorted. \"I from what Earthlets laughingly term Sirius. Alpha Centauri merely little star.\"  \"Now see here!\" Jrann-Pttt sprang to his feet. Criminal he might be, but he was not going to sit there and have his sun insulted!  \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" Miss Anspacher cried. \"No use getting yourself killed, Jrann-Pttt!\"  \"Correctly,\" Monster approved. \"Elementary intelligence displayed. Why damage fine specimens?\"  _From one prison into another_, the saurian mentalized bitterly.  _Yes_, returned Dfar-Lll, _and it's all your fault._ The junior lizard burst into tears. _I wish I had let Merglyt-Ruuu do what he wanted. I would have been better off._  \"Sirius,\" the vine repeated. \"That's even farther away than Alpha Centauri, isn't it? I never thought I would get that far away from the swamp! This really will be an adventure!\"  \"How do you know--\" Professor Bernardi began.  \"Frankly,\" it went on, \"I don't see why you chaps are so put out by the whole thing. What's the difference between Alpha Centauri and Sirius anyway? Matter of a few light-years, but otherwise a star's a star for all that.\"  \"To Jrann-Pttt, we wouldn't have been specimens,\" Mrs. Bernardi said, belatedly recognizing the advantages of Alpha Centauri.  \"No, not specimens,\" the vine told her easily. \"I don't suppose you know he had no intention of taking you back to his system. He wanted you to help him kill the officers of his ship so they couldn't look for him and the other escaped prisoner or report back to his planet. Then he was going to put the ship out of commission and found his own colony here with you as his slaves. I'd just as soon be a specimen as a slave. Sooner. Better to reign in a zoo than serve in a swamp!\"  \"Just how do you know all this?\" Miss Anspacher demanded.  \"It's obvious enough,\" Bernardi said gloomily. \"Another telepath.\" _How can we compete or even cope with creatures like these? What a fool I was to think I could outwit them._  \"Telepathy just tricksomeness,\" the mosquito-bat put in jealously. \"I have no telepathy, yet superior to all.\"  \"But why should Mr. Pitt want to kill his officers?\" Mrs. Bernardi asked querulously. \"He's the commandant, isn't he? Or is he a professor? I never got that straight.\"  \"He was one of the criminals on the ship,\" the vine told her. \"What you might call a confidence man. This is about the only system in the Galaxy where he isn't wanted. He did tell you the truth, though, when he said they were sent on an expedition to collect zoological specimens. Dangerous work,\" it sighed, \"and so his people use criminals for it. They were sent out in small detachments. Our friend here killed his guard in a fight over a female prisoner, which was why--\"  \"But what happened to the female prisoner?\" Miss Anspacher's eye caught Dfar-Lll's. \"Oh, no!\" she gasped.  \"Why not?\" Dfar-Lll demanded. \"I'm as much of a female as you are. Maybe even more.\"  The captain leaned close to Miss Anspacher. \"No one can be more feminine than you are, Dolores,\" he whispered.  \"But he--she's so young!\" Mrs. Bernardi wailed.  The vine made an amused sound. \"Don't you have juvenile delinquents on Earth?\"  \"Oh, what does all that matter now?\" Jrann-Pttt said sullenly. \"We're all going to a Sirian zoo, anyway.\"  \"Correctly,\" approved the monster-bat. \"Finest zoo. Clean. Commodious cages. Reasonable visiting hours. Very nice.\"  Mrs. Bernardi began to cry.  \"Now,\" the vine comforted her, \"a zoo's not so bad. After all, most of us spend our lives in cages of one kind or another, and without the basic security a zoo affords--\"  \"But we don't know we're in cages,\" Mrs. Bernardi sobbed. \"That's the important thing.\"  Professor Bernardi looked at the vine. \"But why are you--\" he began, then halted. \"Perhaps I don't want an answer,\" he said. There was no hope at all left in him, now that there was no doubt.  \"You are wise,\" the vine agreed quietly. Algol arose from Mr. Bernardi's lap and rubbed against its thick pale green stem. He knew. The mosquito-bat looked at both of them restlessly.  The yellow haze had deepened to old gold. Now it was beginning to turn brown.  \"It's twilight,\" Miss Anspacher observed. \"Soon it will be dark.\"  \"Perhaps we'll sail right past his ship in the night,\" Mortland suggested hopefully.  The mosquito-bat gave a snort. \"Ship has lights. All modern convenients.\"  Suddenly the air seemed to have grown chilly--colder than it had any right to be on that torrid planet. All around them, it was dark and very quiet.  \"I think I do see lights,\" Mortland said.  \"Must be ship,\" Monster replied. And somehow the rest of them could sense the uneasiness in the thin, piping, alien voice. \"Must be!\"  \"Your ship's a very large one then,\" Bernardi commented as they rounded a bend and a whole colony of varicolored pastel lights sprang up ahead of them.  \"Not my ship!\" the mosquito-bat exclaimed in a voice pierced with anguish. \"Not my ship!\"  Before them rose the fantastic, twisting, convoluting, turning spires of a tall, marvelous, glittering city.  \"You will find that the streets actually are filled with chlorophyll,\" the vine said. \"And I know you'll be happy here, all of you. You see, we can't have you going back to your planets now. No matter how good your intentions were, you'd destroy us. You do see that, don't you?\"  \"You may be right,\" Bernardi agreed dispiritedly, \"although that doesn't cheer us any. But what will you do with us?\"  \"You'll be provided with living quarters comparable to those on your own planets,\" the vine told him, \"and you'll give lectures just as if you were in a university--only you'll be much more secure. I assure you--\" its voice was very gentle now--\"you'll hardly know you're in a zoo.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3169"],["title","The Pursuit of the House-Boat (#0)"],["body","from the 1919 Harper and Brothers edition by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org        [Picture: The Stranger drew forth a bundle of business cards]                                  THE PURSUIT OF THE                                 HOUSE-BOAT                              _BEING SOME FURTHER_                          _ACCOUNT OF THE DOINGS_                        _OF THE ASSOCIATED SHADES_,                           _UNDER THE LEADERSHIP_                         _OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ESQ._                                      BY                            JOHN KENDRICK BANGS                 AUTHOR OF “A HOUSE-BOAT ON THE STYX,” ETC.

Like a thief in the night had they come, and for no better reason than that the Captain had been unanimously voted a shade too shady to associate with self-respecting spirits had they made off with the happy floating club-house of their betters; and worst of all, with them, by force of circumstances over which they had no control, had sailed also the fair Queen Elizabeth, the spirited Xanthippe, and every other strong-minded and beautiful woman of Erebean society, whereby the men thereof were rendered desolate.  “I can’t stand it!” cried Raleigh, desperately, as with his accustomed grace he presided over a special meeting of the club, called on the bank of the inky Stygian stream, at the point where the missing boat had been moored.  “Think of it, gentlemen, Elizabeth of England, Calpurnia of Rome, Ophelia of Denmark, and every precious jewel in our social diadem gone, vanished completely; and with whom?  Kidd, of all men in the universe!  Kidd, the pirate, the ruffian—”  “Don’t take on so, my dear Sir Walter,” said Socrates, cheerfully. “What’s the use of going into hysterics?  You are not a woman, and should eschew that luxury.  Xanthippe is with them, and I’ll warrant you that when that cherished spouse of mine has recovered from the effects of the sea, say the third day out, Kidd and his crew will be walking the plank, and voluntarily at that.”  “But the House-boat itself,” murmured Noah, sadly.  “That was my delight. It reminded me in some respects of the Ark.”  “The law of compensation enters in there, my dear Commodore,” retorted Socrates.  “For me, with Xanthippe abroad I do not need a club to go to; I can stay at home and take my hemlock in peace and straight.  Xanthippe always compelled me to dilute it at the rate of one quart of water to the finger.”  “Well, we didn’t all marry Xanthippe,” put in Cæsar firmly, “therefore we are not all satisfied with the situation.  I, for one, quite agree with Sir Walter that something must be done, and quickly.  Are we to sit here and do nothing, allowing that fiend to kidnap our wives with impunity?”  “Not at all,” interposed Bonaparte.  “The time for action has arrived. All things considered, he is welcome to Marie Louise, but the idea of Josephine going off on a cruise of that kind breaks my heart.”  “No question about it,” observed Dr. Johnson.  “We’ve got to do something if it is only for the sake of appearances.  The question really is, what shall be done first?”  “I am in favor of taking a drink as the first step, and considering the matter of further action afterwards,” suggested Shakespeare, and it was this suggestion that made the members unanimous upon the necessity for immediate action, for when the assembled spirits called for their various favorite beverages it was found that there were none to be had, it being Sunday, and all the establishments wherein liquid refreshments were licensed to be sold being closed—for at the time of writing the local government of Hades was in the hands of the reform party.  “What!” cried Socrates.  “Nothing but Styx water and vitriol, Sundays? Then the House-boat must be recovered whether Xanthippe comes with it or not.  Sir Walter, I am for immediate action, after all.  This ruffian should be captured at once and made an example of.”  “Excuse me, Socrates,” put in Lindley Murray, “but, ah—pray speak in Greek hereafter, will you, please?  When you attempt English you have a beastly way of working up to climatic prepositions which are offensive to the ear of a purist.”  “This is no time to discuss style, Murray,” interposed Sir Walter. “Socrates may speak and spell like Chaucer if he pleases; he may even part his infinitives in the middle, for all I care.  We have affairs of greater moment in hand.”  “We must ransack the earth,” cried Socrates, “until we find that boat. I’m dry as a fish.”  “There he goes again!” growled Murray.  “Dry as a fish!  What fish, I’d like to know, is dry?”  “Red herrings,” retorted Socrates; and there was a great laugh at the expense of the purist, in which even Hamlet, who had grown more and more melancholy and morbid since the abduction of Ophelia, joined.  “Then it is settled,” said Raleigh; “something must be done.  And now the point is, what?”  “Relief expeditions have a way of finding things,” suggested Dr. Livingstone.  “Or rather of being found by the things they go out to relieve.  I propose that we send out a number of them.  I will take Africa; Bonaparte can lead an expedition into Europe; General Washington may have North America; and—”  “I beg pardon,” put in Dr. Johnson, “but have you any idea, Dr. Livingstone, that Captain Kidd has put wheels on this House-boat of ours, and is having it dragged across the Sahara by mules or camels?”  “No such absurd idea ever entered my head,” retorted the Doctor.  “Do you, then, believe that he has put runners on it, and is engaged in the pleasurable pastime of taking the ladies tobogganing down the Alps?” persisted the philosopher.  “Not at all.  Why do you ask?” queried the African explorer, irritably.  “Because I wish to know,” said Johnson.  “That is always my motive in asking questions.  You propose to go looking for a house-boat in Central Africa; you suggest that Bonaparte lead an expedition in search of it through Europe—all of which strikes me as nonsense.  This search is the work of sea-dogs, not of landlubbers.  You might as well ask Confucius to look for it in the heart of China.  What earthly use there is in ransacking the earth I fail to see.  What we need is a navel expedition to scour the sea, unless it is pretty well understood in advance that we believe Kidd has hauled the boat out of the water, and is now using it for a"]]]
