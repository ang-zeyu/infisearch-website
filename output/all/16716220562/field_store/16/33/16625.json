Mr. Wayne, glancing out of the window, saw some one passing down the front steps. Suddenly a look of recognition came into his face, and he turned to his wife with the exclamation, \"I declare, Mary, our daughter Helen is almost a woman, isn't she?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Wayne, coming to his side and watching the slender figure going down the street. Her face bore a look of motherly pride, but she sighed, as she said,  \"Yes, Time and Death are equally inexorable; they both take our babies from us.\"  \"But not after the same fashion,\" replied Mr. Wayne. \"Death takes them from our sight, where we cannot witness their growth and development, cannot know into what beauty they have blossomed.\"  \"Still,\" said Mrs. Wayne, \"we do not recognize the changes Time makes until they are accomplished. So gradually does the blossom unfold that there is no day to which we can point as the day on which the bud became the full blown flower. On what day did Helen cease to be a baby and become a child? On what day will she cease to be a child and become a woman?\"  \"We will know when the actual physical change takes place, but even after that I trust there will remain to us something of our little girl. I do not like to think of her approaching the sentimental age. How old is she?\"  \"Thirteen.\"  \"Well, we need have no present fear of a sudden development of sentimentality.\"  \"Fortunately, no,\" replied Mrs. Wayne, \"though many a mother of girls no older than Helen is troubled with the question of beaux. Helen, however, has had the good fortune to have for friends boys who seemed to enjoy her comradeship, and I have been very careful not to suggest that their relation could possibly border on the sentimental. So far, she has been perfectly obedient and ever ready to adopt my ideas on all subjects. We have been such close friends that I believe I am acquainted with her inmost thoughts, and if she had felt any romantic emotions I believe she would have confessed them to me.\"  \"Happy mother!\" said Mr. Wayne approvingly, \"I wish all girls found in their mothers their closest friends and confidants. By the way, you have always talked freely to her about life's mysteries; have you explained her approaching womanhood to her?\"  \"Not yet,\" was the reply. \"Perhaps I have been a little unwilling to believe that she is really nearing that crisis. I cannot bear to lose my little girl,\" and Mrs. Wayne looked into her husband's face, smiling through her tears.  \"Yes, I can understand that,\" he said, \"and yet we believe that only through the normal development of her physical nature can she be the 'woman perfected.' I beg of you not to postpone your instruction too long. I am more and more convinced that right knowledge not only safeguards purity, but really produces true modesty. To give a young person a reverent knowledge of self is to insure that delicacy of thought which preserves the bloom of modesty. If the girls who are engaged in street flirtations could only be taught the lesson of true womanhood, I am sure they would become quiet and lady-like in conduct. I would rather lose my little girl altogether than have her fall into this error. You have no hesitancy about speaking to her?\"  \"Not in the least. But I have thought that perhaps she would indicate by some question that her mind was becoming ready for the disclosure. It always seems to me that to force information before the mind is ready to receive it, is to jeopardize its reception.\"  \"Don't wait, Mary. You risk too much by allowing some one else the opportunity to give her the knowledge with the taint of evil suggestion.\"  \"You are right,--and I could not bear that anyone else should explain to her all these mysteries. I have always been her teacher and I will not relinquish that privilege. I will seize the very first that will allow us uninterrupted time.  \"But do you not think that you as a father should have some part in this blessed work of guiding our daughter? I believe that it will be most helpful to her to get the man's view on the problems of her life. You know, one never gets a true perspective of material objects with only one eye; and I believe this is equally true of life. I can give her the woman's view, but she needs to know also how men look upon life. She will be better able to judge of the right or wrong of conduct if she knows that my view is supported by your own.\"  \"You are right, as usual,\" replied Mr. Wayne smiling, \"and you may rest assured that I will always be glad to supplement your counsel by my own.\"     Almost a Woman  CHAPTER I.   \"Mother.\" The clear girlish voice rang through the house with persistent intensity but awakened no responsive call. Mr. Wayne, coming up the steps, heard the repeated summons for \"Mother\" and sent out his answering cry, \"Father's here.\" Quick, light steps answered his call and an urgent young voice demanded, \"Where's mother?\"  \"Mother has been called away for tonight, so you'll have to put up with father.\"  \"O, dear!\" sighed the girl despondently.  \"Is father such a poor substitute, then?\" inquired Mr. Wayne in an aggrieved tone.  \"O, no,\" responded Helen, quickly. \"You're usually as good as mother; but there were some special things I wanted to ask her about this evening. I suppose I can wait,\" she added, dolorously.  \"Try me and see if I won't answer tolerably well. What are these weighty problems?\" drawing his daughter to his knee as he spoke.  \"That's it,\" pouted Helen. \"You always make fun,--mother doesn't.\"  \"Pardon me, daughter, I had no intention of making fun. I only wanted you to feel at home with me. It was a clumsy attempt, I'll admit, but really and truly I would like to be in your confidence--to feel that you trust me, too. I can't fill mother's place, I know, but I can do what mother can't, I can give you the man's view of things, and that is sometimes of great value for a girl to know.\"  \"Yes,\" said Helen, snuggling down in her father's lap, for they were great friends and she felt his sympathy. \"I often wish we could know how things look to other people. I know boys don't look at matters as girls do, but we can't always tell just what they do think.\"  \"That is true,\" replied Mr. Wayne, gravely. \"I often think that if girls knew just what boys say among themselves it would make them more careful of their conduct.  \"For instance, not long ago I was on a steamer where there was dancing. I went into the smoking room, and there I heard the comments of the young men. I am sure the girls had no idea how their dress, figures, freedom and flirtatiousness were criticised and laughed at by these young men, who seemed to them, doubtless, so very nice and polite. Of course, these girls were mostly strangers to the young men and were getting acquainted without introductions, probably thinking it fine fun.\"  \"Yes, father. I've heard some of the real nice girls talk about getting acquainted in that way, and they seem to think it all right. Someway, it never seemed quite nice to me.\"  \"I hope not, my daughter. I should be sorry to have you form acquaintances in that way. You never can tell what a man's character is by his clothes or manners. Indeed, you may think you know a man pretty well, and yet be mistaken. I suppose girls who are familiar with young men and allow them liberties imagine that they are trustworthy. I sat in front of two young men on a train not long ago. They appeared well and really were nice, as boys go, but they had the usual boy's idea as to honor. They were talking freely of the girls they knew, discussing their merits and charms, saying that this one was soft and 'huggable,' that another was sweet to kiss--\"  \"O, father!\" exclaimed Helen, in a fury of surprise and anger. \"They didn't talk that way so that you could hear! And call the girls by name, too?\"  \"Yes, they did, dear. Then after they had discussed several, who all seemed to allow great freedom, they mentioned another name, and their whole manner changed. 'Ah,' said one, 'there's no nonsense about her. It's 'hands off' there every time and'--he went on, with great emphasis, 'that's the kind of a girl I mean to marry. A man doesn't want to feel that his wife's been slobbered over by all the young men of her acquaintance.'\"  Helen hid her face on her father's shoulder. \"How perfectly dreadful!\" she said. \"They were not gentlemen.\"  \"I'll admit that,--and yet the conduct of the girls in permitting such freedom was really an excuse for their speaking so discourteously of them. The girls had not maintained their own self-respect, and therefore had not secured the respect of the young men. The girl who respected herself compelled respect from them, and that is the idea I wish to impress on your mind. Never expect any one to respect you more than you respect"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31861"],["title","Almost a Woman (#1)"],["body","rself, nor to shield your honor if you have placed yourself in their power.\"  \"But, father,\" said Helen hesitatingly, \"most of the girls and boys think it no harm to kiss each other good night, and the girls say the boys would be offended if a girl refused.\"  \"They are mistaken. Of course, the boys like to have the girls think so; but they don't talk that way among themselves, you may be sure.\"  \"But, you see, father,\" urged Helen, hesitatingly, \"they say they are engaged, and that makes it all right.\"  \"How long do they stay engaged?\" asked Mr. Wayne. \"Do they really consider it a true engagement, to end ultimately in marriage, or is it merely an excuse for freedom of association?\"  \"O, they're all the time breaking their engagements. I don't believe they expect them to last very long. Now, there's Dora Ills. She's only sixteen and she says she's been engaged four times, and when she breaks the engagement she doesn't give back the ring. She's making a collection of engagement rings, she says.\"  \"It is very evident that she cannot have the highest respect for herself. I knew of a girl whose sister had been engaged several times and who said to her, 'Why, Lida, you've never been engaged yet, have you?' And Lida replied, 'No, and I have made up my mind that I'll not be one of your pawed-over girls.'  \"Her expression was not an elegant one, but it showed that she respected herself, and of course, she will be more truly respected by the young men if she does not permit them to approach too closely. A girl is very much mistaken if she fancies that a young man thinks more of her if she lets him be familiar. On the other hand, it is always true that he thinks more of her if she makes him feel that she is not to be carelessly approached. As one boy said to me, 'Girls ought to know that boys always want most that which is hardest to get.'\"  \"But, father, if it's so difficult for boys and girls to be together and act as they should, wouldn't it be best to keep them entirely apart until they are old enough to marry?\"  \"That is what they think in the old world, and girls are kept shut up in schools and convents until they are grown; then their parents select a husband for them, and after they are married they are allowed to go into society. I am afraid our girls wouldn't like that,--they'd want to select their own husbands.\"  \"They could do that after they got out of school.\"  \"My observation is that the girl who has been shut up away from young men, is the very one who doesn't know how to act when she comes out of school. She has very romantic ideas, and is quite apt to be misled by a glittering exterior. She is less able to judge wisely or to guide her own conduct judiciously than the girl who, having been educated with boys, has less romantic ideas concerning them. No, I believe in co-education and in the common social life for both sexes; but with it I should ask that all young people should be taught to respect themselves and each other, and to understand their responsibility to future generations.\"  \"And what is that responsibility? What have we young people to do with future generations?\"  \"Just exactly what we older people once had. We didn't think of it in our youth, but we can see now that even then we were creating our own characters and at the same time the characters of our future children. Now, I can see in you many of my own youthful characteristics. I can understand why you find it hard to do things that I'd like you to do, and easy to do some I'd rather you wouldn't do. And if, in the years to come, you have a daughter, she will be apt to be largely what you are now. All the efforts you make now to overcome your own faults are in reality helping to overcome those faults for her also. Suppose the young people knew and thought of these things; don't you think they would judge more wisely of what they ought to do?\"  \"Why, yes, I know what I'd want my daughter to do, it seems to me, even better than I could tell what I ought to do myself.\"  \"Wouldn't that be a good way to decide your own conduct--to do only those things which you'd be perfectly willing your daughter should do?\"  \"But, father, tell me why it's so much more important for girls to be particular about what they do than for boys.\"  \"It's not more important.\"  \"Well, people seem to think it is. The other day Johnnie Webster was going to a show and his little sister Carrie wanted to go, too, and he told her it was no place for girls, and she said, 'Then it is no place for boys'; and he said, 'But boys don't have to be as good as girls.' And his father and mother both heard it and never said a word. They only laughed.\"  \"It is unfortunately quite a common idea that boys and men do not have to be as good as girls and women; but it is not God's idea. He doesn't have two standards of morals, and I think the time is coming when men will be glad to live up to the highest level of purity.\"  \"Don't you think it seems worse for girls to swear or drink or gamble than for boys?\"  \"It does _seem_ worse, because we have had such high ideals for women; but to God it must seem no worse, because he judges of us as _souls_, not as men and women, and He has laid down only one rule of conduct for all souls.\"  \"I'd like to know how the idea ever grew that it was not so bad for men to do wrong as for women.\"  \"Perhaps we cannot now see all the reasons for this state of things, but we can see at least one reason. Many, many years ago men bought their wives, or took them by force from others, so they felt that they _owned_ their wives. Of course, each man liked to feel that his wife was above reproach, that she really did belong to him; therefore, he held any lack of fidelity as a great sin against himself. But he did not think that he belonged to her. She had neither bought nor captured him, so she had no power over him, except such as she could gain by her fascinations.  \"Naturally, he didn't care to be bound by the same rigid ideas to which he held her. He felt himself free to do what fancy dictated. The general level of morals was low, so he followed the pleasures of sense, and the wife could only submit, or try to be more fascinating to him than any one else. But if he was great and influential or handsome, and was not bound by any moral restraints, there would be other women desirous of gaining his attentions and the material comforts he might be able to give, and he would quite willingly think himself free to follow his fancy without censure. In this way has grown up the double moral standard, the pure woman holding herself to the strictest morality, and men imagining themselves not so sternly held to the narrow path of absolute purity.  \"Women are not now slaves, bought as wives and valued for their personal charms alone. They have intellectual power and moral force and social influence, and they can, if they will, create the single moral standard,--that is, the one high ideal for both men and women.\"  \"O, father, do you think girls have as much power as that? It always seems to me as if girls might be of value when they are grown up, but that while we are girls we can't do much to make the world better.\"  \"That is the mistake girls generally make, when in fact the most important time of life is youth. It is while you are girls that you are forming your own character, and at the same time you are helping to form the character of the generations to come. You are of far more value to the nation now, while you are young and can make of yourselves almost anything you please, than you will be when you are old and your habits are fixed. If girls all lived nobly and exacted noble conduct of all their associates, boys as well as girls, it would not take long to settle all questions of reform. Young men will be what young women ask them to be, and that, you see, makes girls of great importance. Do you remember what we were reading in Sesame and Lilies the other day about woman's queenly power? Get the book and let us read it again.\"  Helen brought the book, and, finding the place, read:  \"Woman's power is for rule, not for battle, and her intellect is not for invention or creation, but for sweet ordering, arrangement and decision. Her great function is Praise.  \"There is not a war in the world, no, nor an injustice, but you women are answerable for it, not in that you have provoked, but in that you have not hindered. Men, by their nature, are prone to fight. They will fight for any cause or none. It is for you to choose their cause for them, and to forbid when there is no cause. There is no suffering, no injustice, no misery in the earth, but the guilt of it lies with you.  \"Queens you must always be: queens to your lovers: queens to your husbands and sons: queens of higher mystery to the world beyond, which bows itself and will forever bow before the myrtle crown and the stainless sceptre of womanhood.\"  Helen leaned her head on her father's shoulder in silence. Then she said, softly: \"It makes me almost afraid to become a woman.\"  Mr. Wayne kissed his daughter tenderly, saying: \"It is worthy your highest ambition to be a noble woman. I would be glad to see you such an one as is pictured in Lowell's poem of Irene. Would you like to read it to me?\"  Helen took the book from her father's hand and read.   IRENE.      Hers is a spirit deep, and crystal-clear;     Calmly beneath her earnest face it lies,     Free without boldness, meek without a fear,     Quicker to look than speak its sympathies;     Far down into her large and patient eyes     I gaze, deep-drinking of the infinite,     As, in the mid-watch of a clear, still night,     I look into the fathomless blue skies.      So circled lives she with Love's holy light,     That from the shade of self she walketh free:     The garden of her soul still keepeth she     An Eden where the snake did never enter;     She hath a natural, wise sincerity,     A simple truthfulness, and these have lent her     A dignity as"]]]
