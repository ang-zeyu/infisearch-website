In the synagogue the child listened to the reading of the Law; then he was led to the house of the teacher to whom his education was to be entrusted.  The teacher took him in his arms, \"as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child,\" and presented him with a tablet, on which were written the Hebrew alphabet and some verses from the Bible applicable to the occasion.  The tablet was then spread with honey, which the child ate as if to taste the sweetness of the Law of God.  The child was also shown a bun made by a young maiden, out of flour kneaded together with milk and with oil or honey, and bearing among other inscriptions the words of Ezekiel: \"Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee.  Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.\" Other Biblical passages were inscribed on the shell of an egg, and after they were read, the bun and the egg as well as apples and other fruit were eaten by the pupils present.  This ceremony, marred only by the introduction of superstitious practices, such as the conjuring up of evil demons, was well adapted to stamp itself on the child's mind, and its naive symbolism was bound to make a profound impression upon his imagination.  Pagan antiquity knew of nothing so delicate and at the same time so elevated in sentiment.  Pindar, and Horace after him, conceived the fancy that the bees of Hymettus alighted on the child's brow and dropped rich honey upon it.  The Jewish celebration of a new period in childhood, though not a poetic fiction, is none the less charming and picturesque.  It shows how precious was the cultivation of the mind to a people whom the world delights to represent as absorbed by material interests and consumed by the desire for wealth.  Education has always been highly valued among the Jews, who long acted up to the saying of Lessing: \"The schoolmaster holds the future in his hands.\"  The religious law is a system of instruction, the synagogue is a school.  It will redound to the eternal honor of Judaism that it raised the dissemination of knowledge to the height of a religious precept.  At a time when among the Christians knowledge was the special privilege of the clergy, learning was open to every Jew, and, what is still finer, the pursuit of it was imposed upon him as a strict obligation.  The recalcitrant, say the legalists, is compelled to employ a tutor for his child. Every scholar in Israel is obliged to gather children about him; and the rabbinical works contain most detailed recommendations concerning the organization of schools and methods of instruction.  One comes upon principles and rules of pedagogy unusually advanced for their time.  For instance, teachers were forbidden to have more than forty pupils, and were not to use a more severe means of punishment than whipping with a small strap. In Christian schools, on the contrary, pedagogic methods were backward and barbarous.  It was considered an excellent plan to beat all pupils with the ferule [ferrule sic], in order to make knowledge enter the heads of the bad and to keep the good from the sin of pride.  Among the Jews instruction was tempered to suit the faculty of the learner.  First the child was taught to read Hebrew, translate the daily prayers, and recite the more important of them by heart.  Then the Pentateuch beginning with Leviticus was explained to him, and, if necessary, it was translated into French.  It was read with a special chant.  Rashi, be it said parenthetically, by his commentary gave this Bible instruction a more solid basis.  Not until the pupil was a little older did he study the Talmud, which is so well qualified to develop intelligence and clear-headedness.  His elementary education completed, and provided he had shown taste and inclination for the more difficult studies, the young man went to special schools.  But if he had not shown signs of progress, he was taught simply to read Hebrew and understand the Bible.  The author of a curious pedagogic regulation in the middle ages fixes the whole term of study at fourteen years: the seven years preceding the religious majority of the child are spent in the local school, at the study of the Pentateuch (two years), at the study of the rest of the Bible (two years), and at the study of the easier Talmudic treatises (three years).  The remaining seven years are devoted to the higher study of the Talmud in an academy outside the birthplace of the youth.  This education was obtained sometimes from private teachers, and sometimes in schools founded and maintained at the expense of the community or even of educational societies.  A sufficiently clear idea may thus be obtained of Rashi's early education; and in assuming that he soon distinguished himself for precocity and for maturity of thought, we shall not be shooting wide of the mark.  But legend will not let its heroes off so cheaply; legend will have it that Rashi, in order to complete his education, travelled [traveled sic] to the most distant lands. Not satisfied with having him go to the south of France, to Narbonne, to the school of Moses ha-Darshan (who had doubtless died before Rashi's coming to his school was a possibility), or to Lunel, to attend the school of Zerahiah ha-Levi (not yet born), tradition maintains that at the age of thirty-three Rashi made the tour of almost the whole world as then known, in order to atone for a mistake made by his father, who regretted having lost a precious object, and also in order to assure himself that his commentaries had not been surpassed.  He is said to have traversed Italy, Greece, Egypt, Palestine, and Persia, returning by way of Germany.  So long a voyage must, of course, have been marked by a number of events.  In Egypt, Rashi became the disciple-the more exigent say, the intimate friend-of Maimonides, who, as we all know, was born in 1135, nearly a century later than Rashi.  Maimonides, as fiction recounts, conceived a great affection for Rashi, and imparted to him all his own learning.  Not to fall behind Maimonides in courtesy, Rashi showed him his commentaries, and Maimonides at the end of his life declared that he would have written more commentaries, had he not been anticipated by the French rabbi.  While in the Orient Rashi is represented as having met a monk, and the two discussed the superiority of their respective religions.  At the inn the monk suddenly fell sick.  Rashi, caring for him as for a brother, succeeded in curing him by means of a miraculous remedy.  The monk wanted to thank him, but Rashi interrupted, saying: \"Thou owest me nothing in return.  Divided as we are by our religions, we are united by charity, which my religion imposes upon me as a duty.  If thou comest upon a Jew in misfortune, aid him as I have aided thee.\"  Fictitious though the story be, it is not unworthy the noble character of Rashi.  He <I>was</I> noble, therefore noble deeds are ascribed to him.  On his return Rashi is said to have passed through Prague, whither his reputation had preceded him.  On his entrance into the synagogue, the declamations of the faithful proved to him the admiration they felt for the young rabbi of only thirty-six years.  The pleasure manifested by the Jews irritated Duke Vratislav, who had the famous rabbi arrested, brought before him, and questioned in the presence of his counsellor [counselor sic], the Bishop of Olmutz.  The bishop raising his eyes recognized in the prisoner the Jew who had saved his life, and he told the story to the duke.  The order was immediately given to set Rashi free; but the people, thinking the Jews lost, had fallen upon the Jewish quarter.  Rashi threw himself at the feet of the sovereign, and begged protection for his brethren.  Provided with a safe-conduct, Rashi went forth to appease the mob.  The Jews in their great joy saluted him as their savior.  Tradition adds that the duke conceived great admiration for the Jewish scholar, and made him one of his advisers.  Another, even sweeter reward, awaited him.  Rebecca, the daughter of his host, fell in love with him, and, as Rashi returned the feeling, her father consented to the marriage.  But all this is on the face of it romance.  Certain passages in Rashi's works give abundant proof that Rashi never visited either Palestine or Babylonia, and his conception of the geography of the two countries is utterly fantastic.  For instance, he believed that the Euphrates flowed from the one land into the other.  Moreover, he himself admitted that his ideas concerning them were gathered only from the Bible and the Talmud.[14]  Though Rashi did not let his curiosity carry him to all parts of the globe, he did not confine himself to his birthplace.  He went first to Worms and then to Mayence, remaining some length of time in both places.  He was moved to the step, not by taste for travel, but by taste for study, in accordance with the custom of his time, by which a student went from school to school in order to complete his knowledge.  Of old, it was customary for the workman to make the tour of France for the purpose of perfecting himself in his trade and finding out the different processes of manufacture.  Similarly, the student went from city to city, or, remaining in the same place, from school to school, in order to study a different subject under each master according to the manuscripts which the particular master happened to possess, and which he made his pupils copy.  So far from being disqualified from entering a school on account of vagabondage, the stranger student was accorded a warm welcome, especially if he was himself a scholar.  Strangers found open hospitality in the community, and were sometimes taken in by the master himself.  Knowledge and love of knowledge were safe-conducts.  In every city the lettered new-comer found hosts and friends.  Rashi probably stood in need of such"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],["title","Rashi (#7)"],["body","and protection, for, if an obscure remark made by him may be relied upon, his life as a student was not free from care, and he must have suffered all sorts of privations.  Nor was it rare that fortune failed to smile upon the students, and-not to give a list of examples-cases of poverty were fairly frequent in the Christian universities, at which mendicancy itself was almost respectable. The temptation might be legitimate to sentimentalize over this love of knowledge, this zeal for work, as they manifested themselves in Rashi, causing him to brave all the evil strokes of fortune for their sake; but one must strain a point to take him literally when he says, as he does in a certain somewhat involved passage, that he studied \"without nourishment and without garments.\" However that may be, the same passage shows that while still a student whose course was but half completed, he married, in conformity with the Talmudic maxim, which recommends the Jew to marry at eighteen years of age.  From time to time he went to visit his family at Troyes, always returning to Worms or Mayence.  The fact that the academies of Lorraine which Rashi frequented were in his day the great centres of Talmudic learning, is due to the happy lot which the Jews enjoyed in that country.  The chief trading route of Europe at that time connected Italy with Rhenish Germany, and the Jews knew how to render themselves indispensable in the traffic along this route.  Moreover, they lived on good terms with their neighbors.  The explanation of the cordial relations between Jews and Christians lies in the ease with which the Jews rose to the level of general culture.  The architecture of their synagogues is a striking example.  The cathedral of Worms was built in 1034, at the same period as the synagogue there.  The two structures display so many similarities that one is tempted to believe they represent the handiwork of the same builders.  At all events, it is clear that the Jews cultivated the Romanesque style, so majestic in its simplicity.[15]  Lorraine was not at that time a province of the German Empire; and Rashi leaving the banks of the Seine for those of the Rhine did not expatriate himself in the true sense of the word. Lorraine, or, as it was then called, Lotharingia, the country of Lothair (this is the name that occurs in the rabbinical sources), was more than half French.  Situated between France and Germany, it came within the sphere of French influence.  French was the language in current use, spoken by Jew and Christian alike. German words, in fact, were gallicized in pronunciation.  In Rashi's day the barons of Lorraine rendered homage to the king of France, Henry I.  Naturally, then, the Jews of Lorraine and those of Northern France were in close intellectual communion.  The academies along the Rhine and the Moselle formed, as it were, the link between France and Germany.  In general, and despite the rarity and difficulty of communication, the Jews of France, Germany, and Italy entered freely into relations with one another.[16]  No testimony exists to prove that Rashi, as has been said, studied at Speyer, at which, without doubt, R. Eliakim had not yet begun to teach.  Possibly, Rashi did go to Germany, if confidence is to be placed in some information he gives concerning \"the country of Ashkenaz,\" and if the fact may be deduced from the occurrence in his commentaries of some dozen German words, the authenticity of which is not always certain.  Though doubt may attach to Rashi's journeys, it is certain that Rashi passed the larger number of his years of study (about 1055- 1065) in Worms.  For a long time it was thought-and the belief still obtains-that he also gave instruction in Worms; and recently a street in the city was named after him.  Tradition has connected many things with this alleged stay of Rashi as rabbi at Worms.  Even in our days visitors are shown the school and the little synagogue attached to it as recalling his sojourn in the place, and a small building touching the eastern wall of the great synagogue is also supposed to perpetuate his memory, and it is still called the \"Rashi Chapel.\"  At the bottom of the wall a recess is visible, miraculously caused in order to save his mother when her life was endangered by the two carriages.[17] Some say that Rashi taught from this niche, and a seat in it, raised on three steps, called the Rashi Chair, is still pointed out.  These traditions do not merit credence.  Moreover, they are of comparatively recent origin.  For a long time the school bore the name, not of Rashi, but of Eleazar of Worms, and it was not built until the beginning of the thirteenth century.  Destroyed in 1615, it was restored in 1720 through the generosity of Loeb Sinzheim, of Vienna, and at present it is the Jewish hospital. Alongside the school was a little chapel, belonging to it, which was destroyed in 1615, restored several years later, and finally burned by the French in 1689.  The other chapel, the so-called \"Rashi Chapel,\" his Yeshibah (school), is so tiny that it could hardly have held the crowd of hearers who thronged there, as tradition has it, in order to listen to him.  Besides, the building did not bear the name of Rashi when in 1623 David Joshua Oppenheim, head of the community, erected the school and adjoining chapel, as a Hebrew inscription in the southern wall of the chapel declares.  The chapel having lost its utility was closed in 1760, and from this time on it has been consecrated to the memory of Rashi.  It was restored in 1855.  At Worms Rashi first studied under the head of the Talmudic academy there, Jacob ben Yakar, by that time a man well on in years.  His age doubtless explains the respect and veneration paid him, to which his disciple gave touching expression.  But we know besides how sincere was his piety, his humility, and his spirit of self-denial.  One day a Christian delivered several tuns [tons sic] of wine to a Jew of Worms under peculiar conditions.  Jacob did not want to decide so complicated and delicate a question, and he fled.  Rashi and another disciple pursued and overtook him.  Then he authorized the use of the wine.  Once when the community was going to pay its respects to the emperor or the governor, Jacob declined the honor of heading the procession.  \"I am nothing but a poor man,\" he said.  \"Let others bring their money, I can offer only my prayers.  Each should give of that which he has.\"  Other characteristics of his are mentioned.  Once he and his colleague, Eliezer, surnamed the Great, took an animal they had bought to the slaughter house. There it was found that there was an imperfection in its body; according to Eliezer the imperfection rendered it unfit for eating; according to Jacob it was of no importance.  The animal having been divided, Eliezer threw his share away.  Then Jacob did the same, saying that he would not eat the meat of an animal when another denied himself the enjoyment of it.  Later it is told of Jacob that in his humility he swept the floor of the synagogue with his beard.  To cite Rashi himself, \"I never protest against the usages in the school of my master, Jacob ben Yakar: I know that he possessed the finest qualities.  He considered himself a worm which is trodden underfoot, and he never arrogated to himself the honor-though he would have been justified in so doing-of having introduced any innovation whatsoever.\"  It seems that Rashi, who spoke of Jacob ben Yakar with the utmost respect, and called him \"my old master,\" studied not only the Talmud but also the Bible under his guidance.  The scholar who desired to obtain a grasp on all the studies, if not in their full content, at least in all their variety, had to devote many years to study at a school, not necessarily the same school, throughout his student years, for since the celebrity of a school depended upon the knowledge and renown of its head, it gained and lost pupils with its master.  Thus, on the death of Jacob ben Yakar, Rashi studied under the guidance of his successor, Isaac ben Eleazar ha-Levi,[18] though not for long, it seems.  Wishing in a way to complete the cycle of instruction, he went to Mayence, the centre [center sic] of great Talmudic activity.  The school here was directed by Isaac ben Judah (about 1050-1080), sometimes called the \"Frenchman.\" Rashi considered Isaac ben Judah his master <I>par excellence.</I>  In this school were composed the Talmudic commentaries generally attributed to R. Gershom and sometimes cited under the title of \"Commentaries of the Scholars of Mayence.\"  Isaac ben Judah - not to be confounded with Isaac ha- Levi, both having been the disciples of Eliezer the Great-was scrupulously pious, and absolutely bound by traditional usage.  Rashi, it thus becomes apparent, was not content to learn from only one master, he attended various schools, as if he had had a prevision of his future task, to sum up and, as it were, concentrate all Talmudic teachings and gather the fruits of the scientific activities of all these academies.  Similarly, Judah the Saint, before he became the redactor of the Mishnah, placed himself under a number of learned men, \"as if,\" says Graetz, \"he had had a presentiment that one day he would collect the most diverse opinions and put an end to the juridical debates of the Tannaim.\"  Rashi's intellectual status during these years of study must not be misunderstood.  Pupil he doubtless was, but such a one as in course of time entered into discussions with his teachers, and to whom questions were submitted for decision.  It may even be that toward the end of his school period, he commenced to compose his Talmudic commentaries, or, rather, revise the notes of his masters.  At Worms as at Mayence, his fellow-students probably counted among their number those young scholars who remained his friends and correspondents.  Such were Azriel ben Nathan, his kinsman Eliakim ha-Levi ben Meshullam, of Speyer (born about"]]]
