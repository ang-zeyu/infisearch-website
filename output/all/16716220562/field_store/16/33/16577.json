A NIGHT OF SONG     PREFACE.  \"Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., and Shorty, his Partner,\" were born more than 25 years ago in the brain of John McElroy, editor of The National Tribune, who invented the names and characters, outlined the general plan, and wrote a number of the chapters. Subsequently, the editor, having many other important things pressing upon his attention, called in an assistant to help on the work, and this assistant, under the direction and guidance of the editor, wrote some of these chapters. Subsequently, without the editor's knowledge or consent, the assistant adopted all the material as his own, and expanded it into a book which had a limited sale and then passed into the usual oblivion of shortlived subscription books.  The sketches in this first number are the original ones published in The National Tribune in 1885-6, revised and enlarged somewhat by the editor.  Those in the second and all following numbers appeared in The National Tribune when the editor, John McElroy, resumed the story in 1897, 12 years after the first publication, and continued it for the unprecedented period of seven years, with constantly growing interest and popularity. They gave \"Si Klegg\" a nation-wide and enduring celebrity. Gen. Lew Wallace, the foremost literary man of his day, pronounced \"Si Klegg\" the \"great idyll of the war.\"  How true they are to nature every veteran can abundantly testify from his own service. Really, only the name of the regiment was invented. There is no doubt that there were several men of the name of Josiah Klegg in the Union Army, and who did valiant service for the Government. They had experiences akin to, if not identical with, those narrated here, and substantially every man who faithfully and bravely carried a musket in defense of the best Government on earth had sometimes, if not often, experiences of with those of Si Klegg, Shorty and the boys are strong reminders.  Many of the illustrations in this first number are by the late Geo. Y. Coffin, deceased, a talented artist, whose work embellished The National Tribune for many years. He was the artist of The National Tribune until his lamented and premature death, and all his military work was done by daily consultation, instruction and direction of the editor of The National Tribune.  THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE.     THIS BOOK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED  TO THE RANK AND FILE  OF THE GRANDEST ARMY EVER MUSTERED FOR WAR.      SI KLEGG     CHAPTER I. GOING TO WAR--SI KLEGG'S COMPLETE EQUIPMENT  AND WHAT BECAME OF IT.  AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career.  He was thrifty and provident, and believed in being ready for any emergency. His friends and family coincided with him. The Quartermaster provided him with a wardrobe that was serviceable, if not stylish, but there were many things that he felt he would need in addition.  \"You must certainly have a few pairs of homeknit socks and some changes of underclothes,\" said his tearfully-solicitous mother. \"They won't weigh much, and they'll in all likelihood save you a spell of sickness.\"  \"Certainly,\" responded Josiah, \"I wouldn't think of going away without 'em.\"  Into the capacious knapsack went several pounds of substantial knit woolen goods.  \"You can't get along without a couple of towels and a piece of soap,\" said his oldest sister, Maria, as she stowed those things alongside the socks and underclothes.  \"Si,\" said Ellen, his second sister, \"I got this pocket album for my gift to you. It contains all our pictures, and there is a place for another's picture, whose name I suppose I needn't mention,\" she added archly.  Si got a little red in the face, but said:  \"Nothing could be nicer, Nell. It'll be the greatest comfort in the world to have all your pictures to look at when I'm down in Dixie.\"  \"Here's a 'housewife' I've made for you with my own hands,\" added Annabel, who was some other fellow's sister. She handed him a neatly-stitched little cloth affair. \"You see, it has needles, thread, buttons, scissors, a fine-tooth comb, and several other things that you'll need very badly after you've been in camp awhile. And\" (she got so near Si that she could whisper the rest) \"you'll find in a little secret pocket a lock of my hair, which I cut off this morning.\"  \"I suppose I'll have a good deal of leisure time while we're in camp,\" said Si to himself and the others; \"I believe I'll just put this Ray's Arithmetic and Greene's Grammar in.\"  \"Yes, my young friend,\" added the Rev. Boanarg, who had just entered the house, \"and as you will be exposed to new and unusual temptations, I thought it would be judicious to put this volume of 'Baxter's Call to the Unconverted' in your knapsack, for it may give you good counsel when you need it sorely.\"   \"Thankee,\" said Si, stowing away the book. Of course, Si had to have a hair-brush, blackingbrush, a shaving kit, and some other toilet appliances.  [Illustration: SI DECIDES TO ENLIST 017 ]  Then it occurred to his thoughtful sister Maria that he ought to have a good supply of stationery, including pens, a bottle of ink, and a portfolio on which to write when he was far away from tables and desks.  These went in, accompanied by a half-pint bottle of \"No. 6,\" which was Si's mother's specific for all the ills that flesh is heir to. Then, the blanket which the Quartermaster had issued seemed very light and insufficient to be all the bed-clothes a man would have when sleeping on the bare ground, and Si rolled up one of the warm counterpanes that had helped make the Indiana Winter nights so comfortable for him.  \"Seems rather heavy,\" said Si as he put his knapsack on; \"but I guess I'll get used to it in a little while. They say that soldiers learn to carry surprising loads on their backs. It'll help cure me of being round-shouldered; it'll be better 'n shoulder-braces for holding me up straight.\"  Of course, his father couldn't let him go away without giving him something that would contribute to his health and comfort, and at last the old gentleman had a happy thought--he would get the village shoemaker to make Si a pair of his best stout boots. They would be ever so much better than the shoes the Quartermaster furnished for tramping over the muddy roads and swamps of the South. Si fastened these on top of his knapsack until he should need them worse than at present.  His old uncle contributed an immense bowie knife, which he thought would be of great use in the sanguinary hand-to-hand conflicts Si would have to wage.  On the way to the depot Si found some of his comrades gathered around an enterprising retail dealer in hardware, who was convincing them that they could serve their country much better, besides adding to their comfort, by buying from him a light hatchet and a small frying-pan, which he offered, in consideration of their being soldiers, to sell them at remarkable low rates.  [Illustration: OFF TO THE WAR 019 ]  Si saw at once the great convenience a hatchet and a frying-pan would be, and added them to his kit. An energetic dealer in tinware succeeded in selling him, before he reached the depot, a cunning little coffee-pot and an ingenious combination of knife, fork and spoon which did not weigh more than a pound.  When he got in the cars he was chagrined to find that several of his comrades had provided themselves with convenient articles that he had not thought of. He consoled himself that the regiment would stop some time in Louisville, when he would have an opportunity of making up his deficiencies.  But when the 200th reached Louisville there was no leisure for anything. Bragg was then running his celebrated foot-race with Buell for the Kentucky metropolis, and the 200th Ind. was trotted as rapidly as unused legs could carry it to the works several miles from the center of the city.  Everybody who was in that campaign remembers how terribly hot and dry everything was.  Si Klegg managed to keep up tolerably near the head of the column until camp was reached, but his shoulders were strained and blisters began to appear on his feet.  \"That was a mighty tough pull, wasn't it?\" he said to his chum as they spread their blankets on the dog-kennel and made some sort of a bed; \"but I guess after a day or two we'll get so used to it that we won't mind it.\"  For a few days the 200th Ind. lay in camp, but one day there came an order for the regiment to march to Bardstown as rapidly as possible. A battle was imminent. The roads were dusty as ash-heaps, and though the pace was not three miles an hour, the boys' tongues were hanging out before they were out of sight of camp.  \"I say, Captain, don't they never have resting "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31771"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 1 (#1)"],["body","in the army?\" said Si.  \"Not on a forced march,\" answered the Captain, who, having been in the first three months' service, was regarded as a veteran. \"Push on, boys; they say that they'll want us before night.\" Another hour passed.  [Illustration: AS SI LOOKED WHEN HE LANDED AT LOUISVILLE 021 ]  \"Captain, I don't believe you can put a pin-point anywhere on my feet that ain't covered with a blister as big as a hen's egg,\" groaned Si.  \"It's too bad, I know,\" answered the officer; \"but you must go on. They say Morgan's cavalry are in our rear shooting down every straggler they can find.\"  Si saw the boys around him lightening their knapsacks. He abominated waste above all things, but there seemed no help for it, and, reaching into that receptacle that bore, down upon his aching shoulders like a glacier on a groundhog, he pulled out and tossed into the fence corner the educational works he had anticipated so much benefit from. The bottle of \"No. 6\" followed, and it seemed as if the knapsack was a ton lighter, but it yet weighed more than any stack of hay on the home farm.  A cloud of dust whirled up, and out of it appeared a galloping Aid.  \"The General says that the 200th Ind. must push on much faster. The enemy is trying to get to the bridge ahead of them,\" he shouted as he dashed off in another cloud of dust.  A few shots were heard in the rear.  \"Morgan's cavalry are shooting some more stragglers,\" shouted some one.  Si was getting desperate. He unrolled the counterpane and slashed it into strips with his bowie. \"My mother made that with her own hands,\" he explained to a comrade, \"and if I can't have the good of it no infernal rebel shall. He next slashed the boots up and threw them after the quilt, and then hobbled on to overtake the rest of his company.  \"There's enough dry-goods and clothing lying along in the fence corners to supply a good-sized town,\" the Lieutenant-Colonel reported as he rode over the line of march in rear of the regiment.  The next day Si's feet felt as if there was a separate and individual jumping toothache in every sinew, muscle, tendon and toe-nail; but that didn't matter. With Bragg's infantry ahead and John Morgan's cavalry in the rear, the 200th Ind. had to go forward so long as the boys could put one foot before the other.  [Illustration: SI'S LOAD BEGINS TO GET HEAVY 023 ]  The unloading went on even more rapidly than the day before.  \"My knapsack looks like an elephant had stept on it,\" Si said, as he ruefully regarded it in the evening.  \"Show me one in the regiment that don't,\" answered his comrade.  Thenceforward everything seemed to conspire to teach Si how vain and superfluous were the things of this world. The first rain-storm soaked his cherished album until it fell to pieces, and his sister's portfolio did the same. He put the photographs in his blouse pocket and got along just as well. When he wanted to write he got paper from the sutler. A mule tramped on his fancy coffee-pot, and he found he could make quite as good coffee in a quart-cup. A wagon-wheel lan over his cherished frying-pan, and he melted an old canteen in two and made a lighter and handier pan out of one-half of it. He broke his bowie-knife prying the lid off a cracker-box. He piled his knapsack with the others one day when the regiment was ordered to strip them off for a charge, and neither he nor his comrades ever saw one of them again. He never attempted to replace it. He learned to roll up an extra pair of socks and a change of underclothing in his blanket, tie the ends of this together and throw it over his shoulder sash fashion. Then, with his socks drawn up over the bottoms of his pantaloons, three days' rations in his haversack and 40 rounds in his cartridgebox, he was ready to make his 30 miles a day in any direction he might be sent, and whip anything that he encountered on the road.    CHAPTER II. THE DEADLY BAYONET  IT IS USED FOR NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE THAN FOR PRODDING MEN.  IN COMMON with every other young man who enlisted to defend the glorious Stars and Stripes, Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., had a profound superstition concerning the bayonet. All the war literature he had ever read abounded in bloodcurdling descriptions of bayonet charges and hand-to-hand conflicts, in which bayonets were repeatedly thrust up to the shanks in the combatants' bodies just as he had put a pitch-fork into a bundle of hay. He had seen pictures of English regiments bristling with bayonets like a porcupine with quills, rushing toward French regiments which looked as prickly as a chestnut-bur, and in his ignorance he supposed that was the way fighting was done. Occasionally he would have qualms at the thought of how little his system was suited to have cold steel thrust through it promiscuous-like, but he comforted himself with the supposition that he would probably get used to it in time--\"soldiers get used to almost anything, you know.\"  When the 200th Ind. drew its guns at Indianapolis he examined all the strange accouterments with interest, but gave most to the triangular bit of steel which writers who have never seen a battle make so important a weapon in deciding contests.  It had milk, molasses, or even applejack, for Si then was not a member of the Independent Order of Good Templars, of which society he is now an honored officer. Nothing could be nicer, when he was on picket, to bring buttermilk in from the neighboring farm-house to his chum Shorty, who stood post while he was gone.  [Illustration: SI's CHUM, \"SHORTY\" ELLIOTT 026 ]    Later in the service Si learned the inestimable value of coffee to the soldier on the march. Then he stript the cloth from his canteen, fastened the strand with bits of wire and made a fine coffee-pot of it. In the morning he would half fill it with the splendid coffee ihe Government furnished, fill it up with water and hang it from a bush or a stake over the fire, while he went ahead with his other culinary preparations. By the time these were finished he would have at least a quart of magnificent coffee that the cook of the Fifth Avenue could not surpass, and which would last him until the regiment halted in the afternoon.  The bully of the 200th took it into his thick head one day to try to \"run over\" Si. The latter had just filled his canteen, and the bully found that the momentum of three pints of water swung at arm's length by an angry boy was about equal to a mule's kick.  Just as he was beginning to properly appreciate his canteen, he learned a sharp lesson, that comes to all of us, as to how much \"cussedness\" there can be in the simplest things when they happen to go wrong. He went out one day and got a canteen of nice sweet milk, which he and \"Shorty\" Elliott heartily enjoyed. He hung the canteen upon the ridge-pole of the tent, and thought no more about it until the next day, when he came in from drill, and found the tent filled with an odor so vile that it made him cough.  \"Why in thunder don't the Colonel send out a detail to find and bury that dead mule? It'll pizen the hull camp.\"  He had been in service just long enough to believe that the Colonel ought to look out for and attend to everything.  \"'Taint no dead mule,\" said Shorty, whose nose had come close to the source of the odor. \"It's this blamed canteen. What on earth have you been putting in it. Si?\"  \"Ha'int had nothin' in but that sweet milk yesterday.\"  \"That's just what's the matter,\" said the Orderly, who, having been in the three-months' service, knew all about war. He had come in to detail Si and Shorty to help unload Quartermaster's stores. \"You must always scald 'out your canteens when you've had milk in 'em. Don't you remember how careful your mother is to scald her milk pans?\"  After the company wagon had run over and hopelessly ruined the neat little frying-pan which Si had brought from Posey County, he was in despair as to how he should fry his meat and cook his \"lobscouse.\" Necessity is the mother of invention. He melted in two a canteen he picked up, and found its halves made two deep tin pans, very light and very handy. A split stick made a handle, and he had as good a frying-pan as the one he had lost, and much more convenient, for when done using the handle was thrown away, and the pan slipt into the haversack, where it lay snug and close, instead of clattering about as the frying-pan did when the regiment moved at the double-quick.  The other half of the canteen was useful to brown coffee, bake hoe-cake, and serve for toilet purposes.  One day on the Atlanta campaign the regiment moved up in line to the top of a bald hill. As it rose above the crest it was saluted with a terrific volley, and saw that another crest across the narrow valley was occupied by at least a brigade of rebels.  \"We'll stay right here, boys,\" said the plucky little Colonel, who had only worn Sergeant's stripes when the regiment crossed the Ohio River. \"We've preempted this bit of real estate, and we'll hold it against the whole Southern Confederacy. Break for that fence there, boys, and every fellow come back with a couple of rails.\"  It seemed as if he hardly ceased speaking when the boys came running back with the rails which they laid down along the crest, and dropped flat behind them, began throwing the gravelly soil over them with their useful half-canteens. In vain the shower of rebel bullets struck and sang about them. Not one could penetrate that little ridge of earth and rails, which in an hour grew into a strong rifle-pit against which the whole rebel brigade charged, only to sustain a bloody repulse.  The war would have lasted a good deal longer had it not been for the daily help of the ever-useful half-canteen.    CHAPTER III. THE OLD CANTEEN  THE MANY AND QUEER USES TO WHICH IT WAS AT LAST PUT.  [Illustration: THE DIVERSE USES OF THE GOOD OLD CANTEEN 029 ]  WHEN Josiah (called \"Si\" for short) Klegg, of the 200th Ind., drew his canteen from the Quartermaster at Louisville, he did not have "]]]
