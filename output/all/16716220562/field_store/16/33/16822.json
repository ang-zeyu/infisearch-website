Kenniston saw that his bait had caught them.  \"You've heard of John Dark, the notorious space-pirate?\" he asked.  Gloria nodded. \"Of course. The telenews was full of his exploits until the Patrol caught and destroyed his ship a few weeks ago.\"  Kenniston corrected her. \"The Patrol caught up to John Dark's ship in the asteroid, but didn't completely destroy it. They gunned the pirate craft to a wreck in a running fight. But Dark's wrecked ship drifted into a dangerous zone of meteor swarms where they couldn't follow.\"  \"I remember now--that's what the telenews said,\" conceded the heiress. \"But Dark and his crew were undoubtedly killed, they said.\"  \"John Dark,\" Kenniston went on, \"looted scores of ships during his career. He amassed a hoard of jewels and precious metals. And he kept it right with him in his ship. That treasure's still in that lost wreck.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked Hugh Murdock bluntly.  \"Because I found the lost wreck of Dark's ship myself,\" Kenniston answered. He hated to lie like this, but knew that he had no choice.         *       *       *       *       *  He plunged on. \"I'm a meteor-miner by profession. Two weeks ago my Jovian partner and I were prospecting in the outer asteroid zone in our little rocket. Our air-tanks got low and to replenish them, we landed on the asteroid Vesta. That's the big asteroid they call the World with a Thousand Moons, because it's circled by a swarm of hundreds of meteors.  \"It's a weird, jungled little world, inhabited by some very queer forms of life. In landing, my partner and I noticed where some great object had crashed down into the jungle. We discovered it was the wreck of John Dark's ship. The wreck had drifted until it crashed on Vesta, almost completely burying itself in the ground. No one was alive on it, of course.\"  Kenniston concluded. \"We knew Dark's treasure must still be in the buried wreck. But it would take machinery and equipment to dig out the wreck. So we came here to Mars, intending to get a small cruiser, load it with the necessary equipment, and go back to Vesta and lift the treasure. Only we haven't been able to get a ship of any kind.\"  He leaned toward the girl. \"Here's my proposition, Miss Loring. You take us and our equipment to Vesta in your cruiser, and we'll share the treasure with you fifty-fifty. What do you say?\"  The blonde girl beside Gloria uttered a squeal of excitement. \"Pirate treasure! Gloria, let's do it--what a thrill it would be!\"  The others showed equal excitement. The romance of a treasure hunt in the wild asteroids lured them, rather than the possible rewards.  \"We'd certainly be able to take back a wonderful story to Earth if we found John Dark's treasure,\" admitted Gloria, with quick, eager interest.  Hugh Murdock was an exception to the general enthusiasm. He asked Kenniston, \"How do you know the treasure's still in the buried wreck?\"  \"Because the wreck was still undisturbed,\" Kenniston answered. \"And because we found these jewels on the body of one of John Dark's crew, who had been flung clear somehow when the wreck crashed.\"  He held out a half-dozen gems he took from his pocket. They were Saturnian moon-stones, softly shining white jewels whose brilliance waxed and waned in perfect periodic rhythm.  \"These jewels,\" Kenniston said, \"must have been that pirate's share of the loot. You can imagine how rich John Dark's own hoard must be.\"  The jewels, worth many thousands, swept away the lingering incredulity of the others as Kenniston had known they would.  \"You're sure no one else knows the wreck is there?\" Gloria asked breathlessly.  \"We kept our find absolutely secret,\" Kenniston told her. \"But since I can't get a ship any other way, I'm willing to share the hoard with you. If I wait too long, someone else may find the wreck.\"  \"I accept your proposition, Mr. Kenniston!\" Gloria declared. \"We'll start for Vesta just as soon as you can get the equipment you'll need loaded on the _Sunsprite_.\"  \"Gloria, you're being too hasty,\" protested Hugh Murdock. \"I've heard of this world with a Thousand Moons. There're stories of queer, unhuman creatures they call Vestans, who infest that asteroid. The danger--\"  Gloria impatiently dismissed his objections. \"Hugh, if you are going to start worrying about dangers again, you'd better go back to Earth and safety.\"  Murdock flushed and was silent. Kenniston felt a certain sympathy for the young businessman. He knew, if these others did not, just how real was the alien menace of those strange creatures, the Vestans.  \"I'll go right down to the spaceport and see about loading the equipment aboard your cruiser,\" Kenniston told the heiress. \"You'd better give me a note to your captain. We ought to be able to start tomorrow.\"  \"Pirate treasure on an unexplored asteroid!\" exulted the enthusiastic Robbie. \"Ho for the World with a Thousand Moons!\"  Kenniston felt guilty when he and Holk Or left the big hotel. These youngsters, he thought, hadn't the faintest idea of the peril into which he was leading them. They were as ignorant as babies of the dark evil and unearthly danger of the interplanetary frontier.  He hardened himself against the qualms of conscience. There was that at stake, he told himself fiercely, against which the safety of a lot of spoiled, rich young people was absolutely nothing.  Holk Or was chuckling as they emerged into the chill Martian night. He told Kenniston admiringly, \"That was one of the smoothest jobs of lying I ever heard, that story about finding John Dark's treasure. Take it from me, it was slick!\"  The Jovian guffawed loudly as he added, \"What would their faces be like if they knew that John Dark and his crew are still living? That it was John Dark himself who sent us here?\"  \"Be quiet, you idiot!\" ordered Kenniston hastily. \"Do you want the whole Patrol to hear you?\"   CHAPTER II  Discovered   The _Sunsprite_ throbbed steadily through the vast, dangerous wilderness of the asteroidal zone. To the eye, the cruiser moved in a black void starred by creeping crumbs of light. In reality those bright, crawling specks were booming asteroids or whirling meteor-swarms rushing in complicated, unchartable orbits and constantly threatening destruction.  For three days now, the cruiser had cautiously groped deeper into this most perilous region of the System. Now a bright, tiny disk of white light was shining far ahead like a beckoning beacon. It was the asteroid Vesta--their goal.  Kenniston, leaning against the glassite deck-wall, somberly eyed the distant asteroid.  \"We'll reach it by tomorrow,\" he thought. \"Then what? I suppose John Dark will hold these rich youngsters for ransom.\"  Kenniston knew that the pirate leader would instantly see the chance of extorting vast sums by holding this group of wealthy young people as captives.  \"I wish to God I hadn't had to bring them into this,\" Kenniston sweated. \"But what else could I do? It was the only way I could get back to Vesta with the materials.\"  His mind was going back over the disastrous events since the day three weeks before, when the Patrol had caught up to John Dark at last.  Dark's pirate ship, the _Falcon_, had been gunned to a helpless wreck. It had, fortunately for the pirates, drifted off into a region of perilous meteor-swarms where the Patrol cruisers dared not follow. The Patrol thought everybody on the pirate ship dead anyway, Kenniston knew.  But John Dark and most of his crew were still alive in the drifting wreck. They had fought the battle wearing space-suits, and that had saved them. They had clung grimly to the wreck as it drifted on and on until it finally fell into the feeble gravitational pull of Vesta.  Kenniston could still remember those tense hours when the wreck had fallen through the satellite swarm of meteors onto the World with a Thousand Moons. They had managed to cushion their crash. John Dark, always the most resourceful of men, had managed to jury-rig makeshift rocket-tubes that had softened the impact of their fall.  But the wrecked _Falcon_ had been marooned there in the weird asteroidal jungle, with the alien, menacing Vestans already gathering around it. The ship would never fly space again until major repairs were made. And they could not be made until quantities of material and equipment were brought. Someone must go for those materials to Mars, the nearest planet.  John Dark had superintended construction of a little two-man rocket from parts of the ship. Kenniston and Holk Or were to go in it.  \"You _must_ be back with that list of equipment and materials within two weeks, Kenniston,\" Dark had emphasized. \"If we stay castaway here longer than that, either the Vestans will get us or the Patrol discover us.\"  The pirate leader had added, \"The moon-jewels I've given you will more than pay for a small cruiser, if you can buy one at Mars. If you can't buy one, get one any way you can--but get back here quickly!\"  Well, Kenniston thought grimly, he had got a cruiser in the only way he could. Down in its hold were the berylloy plates and spare rocket-tubes and new cyclotrons he had had loaded aboard at Syrtis.  But he was also bringing back to Vesta with him a bunch of thrill-seeking, rich, young people who believed they were going on a romantic treasure-hunt. What would they think of him when they discovered how he had betrayed them?         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's Vesta, isn't it?\" spoke a girl's eager voice behind him, interrupting his dark thoughts.  Kenniston turned quickly. It was Gloria Loring, boyish in silken space-slacks, her hands thrust into the pockets.  There was a naive eagerness in her clear, lovely face as she looked toward the distant asteroid, that made her look more like an excited small girl than like the bored, jewelled heiress of that night at Syrtis.  \"Yes, that's the World with a Thousand Moons,\" Kenniston nodded. \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32317"],["title","The World with a Thousand Moons (#2)"],["body","We'll reach it by tomorrow. I've just been up on the bridge, telling your Captain Walls the safest route through the meteor swarms.\"  Her dark eyes studied him curiously. \"You've been out here on the frontier a long time, haven't you?\"  \"Twelve years,\" he told her. \"That's a long time in the outer planets. Most space-men don't last that long out here--wrecks, accidents or gravitation-paralysis gets them.\"  \"Gravitation-paralysis?\" she repeated. \"I've heard of that as a terrible danger to space-travelers. But I don't really know what it is.\"  \"It's the most dreaded danger of all out here,\" Kenniston answered. \"A paralysis that hits you when you change from very weak to very strong gravities or vice versa, too often. It locks all your muscles rigid by numbing the motor-nerves.\"  Gloria shivered. \"That sounds ghastly.\"  \"It is,\" Kenniston said somberly. \"I've seen scores of my friends stricken down by it, in the years I've sailed the outer System.\"  \"I didn't know you'd been a space-sailor all that time,\" the heiress said wonderingly. \"I thought you said you were a meteor-miner.\"  Kenniston woke up to the fact that he had made a bad slip. He hastily covered up. \"You have to be a good bit of a space-sailor to be a meteor-miner, Miss Loring. You have to cover a lot of territory.\"  He was thankful that they were interrupted at that moment by some of the others who came along the deck in a lively, chattering group.  Robbie Boone was the center of the group. That chubby, clownish young man, heir to the Atomic Power Corporation millions, had garbed himself in what he fondly believed to be a typical space-man's outfit. His jacket and slacks were of black synthesilk, and he wore a big atom-pistol.  \"Hiya, pal!\" he grinned cherubically at Kenniston. \"When does this here crate of ours jet down at Vesta?\"  \"If you knew how silly you looked, Robbie,\" said Gloria devastatingly, \"trying to dress and talk like an old space-man.\"  \"You're just jealous,\" Robbie defied. \"I look all right, don't I, Kenniston?\"  Kenniston's lips twitched. \"You'd certainly create a sensation if you walked into the Spaceman's Rendezvous in Jovopolis.\"  Alice Krim, a featherheaded little blonde, eyed Kenniston admiringly. \"You've been to an awful lot of planets, haven't you?\" she sighed.  \"Turn it off, Alice,\" said Gloria dryly. \"Mr. Kenniston doesn't flirt.\"  Arthur Lanning, the sulky, handsome youngster who always had a drink in his hand, drawled. \"Then you've tried him out, Gloria?\"  The heiress' dark eyes snapped, but she was spared a reply by the appearance of Mrs. Milsom. That dumpy, fluttery woman, the nominal chaperone of the group, immediately seized upon Kenniston as usual.  \"Mr. Kenniston, are you sure this asteroid we're going to is safe?\" she asked him for the hundredth time. \"Is there a good hotel there?\"  \"A good hotel there?\" Kenniston was too astounded to answer, for a moment.         *       *       *       *       *  Into his mind had risen memory of the savage, choking green jungles of the World with a Thousand Moons; of the slithering creatures slipping through the fronds, of the rustling presence of the dreaded Vestans who could never quite be seen; of the pirate wreck around which John Dark and half a hundred of the System's most hardened outlaws waited.  \"Of course there's no hotel there, Aunty,\" Gloria said disgustedly. \"Can't you understand that this asteroid's almost unexplored?\"  Holk Or had come up, and the big Jovian had heard. He broke into a booming laugh. \"A hotel on Vesta! That's a good one!\"  Kenniston flashed the big green pirate a warning glance. Robbie Boone was asking him, \"Will there be any good hunting there?\"  \"Sure there will,\" Holk Or declared. His small eyes gleamed with secret humor. \"You're going to find lots of adventure there, my lad.\"  When Mrs. Milsom had dragged the others away for the usual afternoon game of \"dimension bridge,\" the Jovian looked after them, chuckling.  \"This crowd of idiots hadn't ought to have ever left Earth. What a surprise they're going to get on Vesta!\"  \"They're not such a bad bunch, at bottom,\" Kenniston said halfheartedly. \"Just a lot of ignorant kids looking for adventure.\"  \"Bah, you're falling for the Loring girl,\" scoffed Holk Or. \"You'd better keep your mind on John Dark's orders.\"  Kenniston made a warning gesture. \"Cut it! Here comes Murdock.\"  Hugh Murdock came straight along the deck toward them, and his sober, clean-cut young face wore a puzzled look as he halted before them.  \"Kenniston, there's something about this I can't understand,\" he declared.  \"Yes? What's that?\" returned Kenniston guardedly.  He was very much on the alert. Murdock was not a heedless, gullible youngster like the others. He was, Kenniston had learned, an already important official in the Loring Radium company.  From the chaffing the others gave Murdock, it was evident that the young business man had joined the party only because he was in love with Gloria. There was something likeable about the dogged devotion of the sober young man. His very obvious determination to protect Gloria's safety, and his intelligence, made him dangerous in Kenniston's eyes.  \"I was down in the hold looking over the equipment you loaded,\" Hugh Murdock was saying. \"You know, the stuff we're to use to dig out the wreck of Dark's ship. And I can't understand it--there's no digging machinery, but simply a lot of cyclotrons, rocket-tubes and spare plates.\"  Kenniston smiled to cover the alarm he felt. \"Don't worry, Murdock, I loaded just the equipment we'll need. You'll see when we reach Vesta.\"  Murdock persisted. \"But I still don't see how that stuff is going to help. It's more like ship-repair stores than anything else.\"  Kenniston lied hastily. \"The cycs are for power-supply, and the rocket-tubes and plates are to build a heavy duty power-hoist to jack the wreck out of the mud. Holk Or and I have got that all figured out.\"  Murdock frowned as though still unconvinced, but dropped the subject. When he had gone off to join the others, Holk Or glared after him.  \"That fellow's too smart for his own good,\" muttered the Jovian. \"He's suspicious. Maybe I'd better see that he meets with an accident.\"  \"No, let him alone,\" warned Kenniston. \"If anything happened to him now, the others would want to turn back. And we're almost to Vesta now.\"  But worry remained as a shadow in the back of Kenniston's own mind. It still oppressed him hours later when the arbitrary ship's-time had brought the 'night.' Sitting down in the luxurious passenger-cabin over highballs with the others, he wondered where Hugh Murdock was.  The rest of Gloria's party were all here, listening with fascinated interest to Holk Or's colorful yarns of adventures on the wild asteroids. But Murdock was missing. Kenniston wondered worriedly if the fellow was looking over that equipment in the hold again.         *       *       *       *       *  A young Earth space-man--one of the _Sunsprite's_ small crew--came into the cabin and approached Kenniston.  \"Captain Walls' compliments, sir, and would you come up to the bridge? He'd like your advice about the course again.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" Gloria said as Kenniston rose. \"I like it up in the bridge best of any place on the ship.\"  As they climbed past the little telaudio transmitter-room, they saw Hugh Murdock standing in there by the operator. He smiled at Gloria.  \"I've been trying to get some messages through to Earth, but it seems we're almost out of range,\" he said ruefully.  \"Can't you ever forget business, Hugh?\" the girl said exasperatedly. \"You're about as adventurous as a fat radium-broker of fifty.\"  Kenniston, however, felt relieved that Murdock had apparently forgotten about the oddness of the equipment below. His spirits were lighter when they entered the glassite-enclosed bridge.  Captain Walls turned from where he stood beside Bray, the chief pilot. The plump, cheerful master touched his cap to Gloria Loring.  \"Sorry to bother you again, Mr. Kenniston,\" he apologized. \"But we're getting pretty near Vesta, and you know this devilish region of space better than I do. The charts are so vague they're useless.\"  Kenniston glanced at the instrument-panel with a practiced eye and then squinted at the void ahead. The _Sunsprite_ was now throbbing steadily through a starry immensity whose hosts of glittering points of light would have made a bewildering panorama to laymen's eyes.  They seemed near none of those blazing sparks. Yet every few minutes, red lights blinked and buzzers sounded on the instrument panel. At each such warning of the meteorometers, the pilot glanced quickly at their direction-dials and then touched the rocket-throttles to change course slightly. The cruiser was threading a way through unseen but highly perilous swarms of rushing meteors and scores of thundering asteroids.  Vesta was now a bright, pale-green disk like a little moon. It was not directly ahead, but lay well to the left. The cruiser was following an indirect course that had been laid to detour it well around one of the bigger meteor-swarms that was spinning rapidly toward Mars.  \"What about it, Mr. Kenniston--is it safe to turn toward Vesta now?\" Captain Walls asked anxiously. \"The chart doesn't show any more swarms that should be in this region now, by my calculations.\"  Kenniston snorted. \"Charts are all made by planet-lubbers. There's a small swarm that tags after that big No. 480 mess we just detoured around. Let me have the 'scopes and I'll try to locate it.\"  Using the meteorscopes whose sensitive electromagnetic beams could probe far out through space, to be reflected by any matter, Kenniston searched carefully. He finally straightened from the task.  \"It's all right--the tag-swarm is on the far side of No. 480,\" he reported. \"It should be safe to blast straight toward Vesta now.\"  The captain's anxiety was only partly assuaged. \"But when we reach the asteroid, what then? How do we get through the satellite-swarm"]]]
