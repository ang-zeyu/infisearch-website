Come on!\" urged Henry, his teeth chattering. \"Don't make him mad! Please, Joseph!\"  \"I'm coming,\" grunted the scientist. \"I certainly can't be blamed if the pebbles and twigs hurt my feet, can I?\"  And with that, he sprang.  Like a human octopus, all long arms and legs, he launched himself at the spy. His hands clutched at the red-head's throat. His legs wrapped around the man's waist and dashed him backward to the ground.  \"Help!\" screamed the spy. With a wild motion he hurled the package from him in a long arch.  _Bang!_         *       *       *       *       *  But the explosion was the crack of a detonating cap, not the thunderous roar of a heavy charge of powder.  Major Coggleston lunged forward. His fists beat a meaty tattoo on the spy's face.  The next instant the crackle of military commands and the thud of footsteps burst upon them. The four--Professor Paulsen, Major Coggleston and the spy, in a heap on the ground; and Henry Horn, wide-eyed and trembling, standing near at hand--were illumined in a powerful flashlight's beam. Half a dozen soldiers rushed up.  \"Major! We heard that shot! Are you all right?\"  The officer struggled to his feet, trying hard to preserve the dignity of his rank despite his nudity. In the light of the flash he looked even more than before like an overgrown kewpie doll.  \"Of course I'm all right!\" he puffed. \"What's more, that red-headed rat on the ground is the spy and murderer we've been looking for. Take him away, men!\"  He turned to Professor Paulsen.  \"Joe, this is one time I don't know what to say. If it hadn't been for you that devil would have made a clean getaway.\"  \"Forget it,\" retorted the gaunt scientist. \"It's little enough I can do for my country at my age.\"  \"Honestly, Joseph, I can't see how you got the nerve to do it!\" marveled Henry, still wide-eyed. \"Just think, we might all have been killed--\"  The professor glared.  \"What do you mean, we might all have been killed?\"  \"Why, the explosive in that package, and the detonator--really, Joseph, it was terribly dangerous--\"  \"Dangerous!\" snorted the savant. \"The only dangerous part was that he might have hit me over the head with it.\"  \"But--the explosive--\"  \"Explosive, my eye!\" And, again glaring: \"Do you mean to tell me you can't understand why that stuff he had in the package didn't go off, you abbreviated atom?\"  Henry's goatee waggled uncertainly. He adjusted the steel-rimmed spectacles which were his only garment.  \"Well ... really, Joseph....\"  \"I'll admit right out I don't get it,\" broke in Major Coggleston. \"You mean there wasn't any danger of that stuff going off?\"  \"Of course not.\" Professor Paulsen was distinctly snappish.  \"But why--\"         *       *       *       *       *  The scientist turned back to Henry. \"Don't you remember what I said to you this morning about those devil's glasses of yours transposing letters instead of just reversing them? And that you told me it would take a special lens to straighten them out?\"  \"You mean--\"  \"Take any formula and transpose the symbols all the way through, and see what you get. Trinitrocresol, for instance. The formula is C_{7}H_{5}N_{3}O_{7}. Transpose it all the way through, and you have _{7}O_{3}N_{5}H_{7}C. In that particular case, it wouldn't even make sense. But when our red-headed spy said he was a chemist and hadn't had any trouble compounding this new explosive, I figured the formula must be one that would be at least half-way logical, no matter which way you wrote it. Only the odds were a million to one that one way it would equal an explosive; the other, nothing at all. So I didn't hesitate to attack him.\"  \"Joe,\" said Major Coggleston admiringly, \"that's a lot faster thinking than I've ever done. And I don't need to tell you how grateful the Army will be.\"  \"Really, Joseph, it was awfully clever!\" Henry chimed in. \"I'd never have thought of it--\"  And then, changing thought in mid-sentence:  \"Look! There's that pretty blonde girl with the--\"  \"Henry!\" exploded Professor Paulsen. \"You're old enough to behave like a grown man, not an inspectionistic schoolboy!\" His hand shot out to grip his little partner's goatee and jerk his eyes from the luscious creature now parading her charms before them.  \"Ouch!\" squealed Henry, his face screwing up with pain. \"Joseph, you're hurting!\"  \"Then will you be good? Will you behave yourself?\"  \"Of course, Joseph. Just let me go!\" Then, sulkily, as the tall scientist released him: \"Though I still think you're mighty finicky, Joseph Paulsen. After all, what's wrong with my liking the cute way that girl wears the bangs across her forehead?\"         *       *       *       *       *  [Footnote 1: The Piltdown Man was a species of prehistoric being (_Eoanthropus dawsoni_), long since extinct, with a retreating, apelike chin and thick cranial bones, but a human-type cranium.--Ed.]  [Footnote 2: See \"Henry Horn's Blitz Bomb,\" Amazing Stories, June, '42.--Ed.]  [Footnote 3: See \"Henry Horn's Super-Solvent,\" _Fantastic Adventures_, November, '41.--Ed.]"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32592"],["title","Let There Be Light (#0)"],["body","There Be Light                             By Horace B.

In the bright sunlight, glistening spatters of sweat flew from them as the old axes bit alternately into the wood.  Blackie stood nearby, on the gravel shoulder of the highway, rubbing his short beard as he considered the depth of the white notch. Turning his broad, tanned face to glance along the patched and cracked concrete to where squat Vito kept watch, he caught the latter's eye and beckoned.  \"Okay, Sid--Mike. We'll take it a while.\"  The rhythm of the axe-strokes ceased. Red Mike swept the back of a forearm across the semi-shaven stubble that set him as something of a dandy. Wordlessly, big Sid ambled up the road to replace Vito.  \"Pretty soon, now,\" boasted Mike, eyeing the cut with satisfaction. \"Think it'll bring them?\"  \"Sure,\" replied Blackie, spitting on his hands and lifting one of the worn tools. \"That's what they're for.\"  \"Funny,\" mused Mike, \"how some keep going an' others bust. These musta been workin' since I was a little kid--since before the last blitz.\"  \"Aw, they don't hafta do much. 'Cept in winter when they come out to clear snow, all they do is put in a patch now an' then.\"  Mike stared moodily at the weathered surface of the highway and edged back to avoid the reflected heat.  \"It beats me how they know a spot has cracked.\"  \"I guess there's machines to run the machines,\" sighed Blackie. \"I dunno; I was too young. Okay, Vito?\"  The relieving pair fell to. Mike stepped out of range of the flying chips to sit at the edge of the soft grass which was attempting another invasion of the gravel shoulder. Propelled by the strength of Vito's powerful torso, a single chip spun through the air to his feet. He picked it up and held it to his nose. It had a good, clean smell.  When at length the tree crashed down across the road, Blackie led them to the ambush he had chosen that morning. It was fifty yards up the road toward the ruined city--off to the side where a clump of trees and bushes provided shade and concealment.  \"Wish we brought something to eat,\" Vito said.  \"Didn't know it would take so long to creep up on 'em this morning,\" said Blackie. \"The women'll have somethin' when we get back.\"  \"They better,\" said Mike.  He measured a slender branch with his eye. After a moment, he pulled out a hunting knife, worn thin by years of sharpening, and cut off a straight section of the branch. He began whittling.  \"You damn' fool!\" Sid objected. \"You want the busted spot on the tree to show?\"  \"Aw, _they_ ain't got the brains to notice.\"  \"The hell they ain't! It stands out like one o' them old street signs. D'ya think they can tell, Blackie?\"  \"I dunno. Maybe.\" Blackie rose cautiously to peer over a bed of blackberry bushes. \"Guess I'll skin up a tree an' see if anything's in sight.\"  He hitched up his pants, looking for an easy place to climb. His blue denims had been stoutly made, but weakened by many rips and patches, and he did not want to rip them on a snag. It was becoming difficult to find good, unrotted clothing in the old ruins.         *       *       *       *       *  Choosing a branch slightly over his head, he sprang for it, pulled, kicked against the trunk, and flowed up into the foliage with no apparent effort. The others waited below. Sid glanced up occasionally, Vito idly kicked at one of the clubs made from an old two-by-four.  The other lay beneath the piled jackets; but enough of the end protruded to show that they had been chopped from the same timber, gray-painted on one side, stained and gouged on the other where boards had once been nailed. A coil of rope lay beside the axes.  High in the upper branches, Blackie braced himself with negligent confidence and stared along the concrete ribbon.  _From here_, he thought, _you'd almost think the place was still alive, instead of crumbling around our ears._  The windows of the distant houses were dark, unglassed holes, but the sunlight made the masonry clean and shining. To Blackie, the ragged tops of most of the buildings were as natural as the tattered look of the few people he knew. Beyond, toward the center of the city, was real evidence of his race's bygone might--a vast jumble of shattered stone and fused metal. Queer weeds and mosses infected the area, but it would be centuries before they could mask the desolation.  Better covered, were the heaps along the road, seemingly shoved just beyond the gravel shoulders--mouldering mounds which legend said were once machines to ride in along the pavement.  Something glinted at the bend of the highway. Blackie peered closer.  He swarmed down the tree from branch to branch, so lithely that the trio below hardly had the warning of the vibrating leaves before he dropped, cat-footed, among them.  \"They're comin'!\"  He shrugged quickly into his stained jacket, emulated in silent haste by the others. Vito rubbed his hands down the hairy chest left revealed by his open jacket and hefted one of the clubs. In his broad paws, it seemed light.  They were quiet, watching Sid peer out through narrowly parted brush of the undergrowth. Blackie fidgeted behind him. Finally, he reached out as if to pull the other aside, but at that moment Sid released the bushes and crouched.  The others, catching his warning glance, fell prone, peering through shrubbery and around tree trunks with savage eyes.  The distant squawk of a jay became suddenly very clear, as did the sighing of a faint breeze through the leaves overhead. Then a new, clanking, humming sound intruded.  A procession of three vehicles rolled along the highway at an unvarying pace which took no account of patches or worn spots. They jounced in turn across a patch laid over a previous, unsuccessful patch, and halted before the felled tree. Two were bulldozers; the third was a light truck with compartments for tools. No human figures were visible.  A moment later, the working force appeared--a column of eight robots. These deployed as they reached the obstacle, and explored like colossal ants along its length.  \"What're they after?\" asked Mike, whispering although he lay fifty yards away.  \"They're lookin' over the job for whatever sends them out,\" Blackie whispered back. \"See those little lights stickin' out the tops o' their heads? I heard tell, once, that's how they're run.\"  Some of the robots took saws from the truck and began to cut through the tree trunk. Others produced cables and huge hooks to attach the obstacle to the bulldozers.  \"Look at 'em go!\" sighed Sid, hunching his stiff shoulders jealously. \"Took us hours, an' they're half done already.\"  They watched as the robots precisely severed the part of the tree that blocked the highway, going not one inch beyond the gravel shoulder, and helped the bulldozers to tug it aside. On the opposite side of the concrete, the shoulder tapered off into a six-foot drop. The log was jockeyed around parallel to this ditch and rolled into it, amid a thrashing of branches and a spurting of small pebbles.  \"Glad we're on the high side,\" whispered Mike. \"That thing 'ud squash a guy's guts right out!\"  \"Keep listenin' to me,\" Blackie said, \"an' you'll keep on bein' in the right place at the right time.\"  Mike raised his eyebrows at Vito, who thrust out his lower lip and nodded sagely. Sid grinned, but no one contradicted the boast.  \"They're linin' up,\" Blackie warned tensely. \"You guys ready? Where's that rope?\"  Someone thrust it into his hands. Still squinting at the scene on the highway, he fumbled for the ends and held one out to Mike. The others gripped their clubs.  \"Now, remember!\" ordered Blackie. \"Me an' Mike will trip up the last one in line. You two get in there quick an' wallop him over the head--but good!\"  \"Don't go away while we're doin' it,\" said big Sid. \"They won't chase ya, but they look out fer themselves. I don't wanna get tossed twenty feet again!\"  The eyes of the others flicked toward the jagged white scar running down behind Sid's right ear and under the collar of his jacket. Then they swung back to the road.  \"Good!\" breathed Blackie. \"The rollin' stuff's goin' first.\"  The truck and bulldozers set out toward the city, with the column of robots marching a fair distance behind. The latter approached the ambush--drew abreast--began to pass.  Blackie raised himself to a crouch with just the tips of his fingers steadying him.         *       *       *       *       *  As the last robot plodded by, he surged out of the brush, joined to Red Mike by their grips on the twenty feet of rope. They ran up behind the marching machine, trailed by the others.  In his right hand, Blackie twirled the part of the rope hanging between him and Mike. On the second swing, he got it over the head of the robot. He saw Mike brace himself.  The robot staggered. It pivoted clumsily to its left, groping vaguely for the hindrance. Mike and Blackie tugged again, and the machine wound up facing them in its efforts to maintain balance. Its companions marched steadily along the road.  \"Switch ends!\" barked Blackie.  Alert, Mike tossed him the other end of the rope and caught Blackie's. They ran past the robot on either side, looping it in. Blackie kept going until he was above the ditch. He wound a turn of rope about his forearm and plunged down the bank.  [Illustration: _With skill of long practice, they brought the robot down._]  A shower of gravel spattered after him as Mike jammed his heels into the shoulder of the highway to anchor the other end. Then he heard the booming sound of the robot's fall.  Blackie clawed his way up the bank. Vito and Sid were"]]]
