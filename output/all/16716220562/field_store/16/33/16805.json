Bindle looked at the horse suspiciously and, seeing there were no indications of vice, at the same time realising that there was nothing else to be done, he acquiesced.  \"Steady on, ole sport,\" he counselled Spotty. \"Don't you chuck me clean over the other side.\"  With a dexterous heave, Spotty landed him well upon the animal's back. Bindle calmly proceeded to throw one leg over, sitting astride.  \"Not that way,\" said Tippitt, \"both legs on the near side.\"  \"You can ride your nag wot way you like, Tippy,\" said Bindle; \"but as for me, I likes to 'ave a leg each side. 'Ow the 'ell am I goin' to 'old on if I sit like a bloomin' lady. My Gawd!\" he exclaimed, passing his hand along the backbone of the animal, \"if I don't 'ave a cushion I shall wear through in two ticks. 'Ere, Spotty, give us a cloth o' some sort, then you can back me as a two-to-one chance.\"  Tippitt, more accustomed than Bindle to such adventures, vaulted lightly upon his animal, and led the way out of the yard. For some distance they proceeded at an ambling walk, which Bindle found in no way inconvenient. Just as they had entered the Fulham Road, where it branches off from the Brompton Road, an urchin gave Bindle's horse a flick on the flank with a stick, sending it into a ponderous trot, amidst the jangle and clatter of harness. Bindle clutched wildly at the collar.  \"'Ere, stop 'im, somebody! 'Old 'im!\" he yelled. \"I touched the wrong button. Whoa, steady, whoa, ole iron!\" he shouted. Then turning his head to one side he called out: \"Tippy, Tippy, where the 'ell is the brake? For Gawd's sake stop 'im before 'e shakes me into a jelly!\"  Tippitt's animal jangled up beside that on which Bindle was mounted, and both once more fell back into the ponderous lope at which they had started. With great caution Bindle raised himself into an upright position.  \"I wonder wot made 'im do a thing like that,\" he said reproachfully. \"Bruised me all over 'e 'as. I shan't be able to sit down for a month. 'Ere, stop 'im, Tippy. I'm gettin' orf.\"  Tippitt stretched out his hand and brought both horses to a standstill. Bindle slipped ungracefully over his animal's tail.  \"You can 'ave 'im, Tippy, ole sport, I'm goin' to walk,\" he announced. \"When I get tired o' walking, I'll get on a bus. I'll meet you at Wimbledon Common;\" and Tippitt, his cigarette hanging loosely from a still looser lower lip, reached over, caught the animal's bridle and, without comment, continued on his way westward.  \"Well, live 'an learn,\" mumbled Bindle to himself. \"I don't care wot a jockey gets; but 'e earns it, every penny. Fancy an 'orse bein' as 'ard as that. Catch you up presently, Tippy,\" he cried. \"Mind you don't fall orf,\" and Bindle turned into The Drag and Hounds \"for somethink to take the bruises out,\" as he expressed it to himself.  \"Catch me a-ridin' of an 'orse again without an air-cushion,\" he muttered as he came out of the public-bar wiping his mouth. He hailed a west-bound bus, and, climbing on the top and lighting his pipe, proceeded to enjoy the morning sunshine.  When Tippitt reached the extreme end of Wimbledon Common, Bindle rose from the grass by the roadside, where he had been leisurely smoking and enjoying the warmth.  \"'Ad quite a pleasant little snooze, Tippy,\" he yawned, as he stretched his arms behind his head. \"Wonder who first thought o' ridin' on an 'orse's back,\" he yawned. \"As for me, I'd jest as soon ride on an 'and-saw.\"  They jogged along in the direction of Merton, Bindle walking beside the horses, Tippitt silent and apathetic, his cigarette still attached to his lower lip.  \"You ain't wot I should call a chatty cove, Tippy,\" remarked Bindle conversationally; \"but then,\" he added, \"that 'as its points. If you don't open your mouth, no woman can't say you ever asked 'er to marry you, can she?\"  \"Married, mate!\" Tippitt vouchsafed the information without expression or interest.  Bindle stood still and looked at him.  Tippitt unconcernedly continued on his way.  \"Well, I'm damned!\" remarked Bindle, as he continued after the horses. \"Well, I'm damned! They'd get you if you was deaf an' dumb an' blind. Pore ole Tippy! no wonder 'e looks like that.\"  Just outside Merton they came upon a stranded pantechnicon. Drawn up in front of it was a motor-car containing two ladies.  \"This the little lot?\" enquired Bindle as they pulled up beside the vehicle, which bore the name of John Smith & Company, Merton.  \"Are you from Empson & Daleys?\" enquired the elder of the two ladies, a sallow-faced, angular woman with pince-nez.  \"That's us, mum,\" responded Bindle.  \"I suppose those are the horses,\" remarked the same lady, indicating the animals with an inclination of her head.  \"You ain't got much to learn in the way o' guessing, mum,\" was Bindle's cheery response.  The lady eyed him disapprovingly. Her companion at the wheel smiled. She was younger. Bindle winked at her; but she froze instantly.  \"The horses that were in this van were taken ill,\" said the lady.  \"Wot, both together, mum!\" exclaimed Bindle.  \"Yes,\" replied the lady, looking at him sharply.  \"Must 'ave been twins or conchies,\"[1] was Bindle's explanation of the phenomenon. \"If one o' Ginger's twins 'as the measles, sure as eggs the other'll get 'em the next day. That's wot makes Ginger so ratty.\"      [1] Conscientious objectors to military service.  Bindle walked up to the van and examined it, as if to assure himself that it was in no way defective.  \"An' where are we to take it, mum?\" he enquired.  \"To Mr. Llewellyn John, Number 110, Downing Street,\" was the reply.  Bindle whistled. \"'E ain't movin', is 'e, mum?\"  \"The van contains a presentation of carved-oak dining-room furniture,\" she added.  \"An' very nice too,\" was Bindle's comment.  \"Outside Downing Street,\" she continued, \"you will be met by a lady who will give you the key that opens the doors of the van.\"  \"'Adn't we better take the key now, mum?\" Bindle enquired.  \"You'll do as you're told, please,\" was the uncompromising rejoinder.  \"Right-o! mum,\" remarked Bindle cheerily. \"Now then, Tippy, let's get these 'ere 'orses in. Which end d'you begin on?\"  Tippitt and Bindle silently busied themselves in harnessing the horses to the pantechnicon.  \"Now you won't make any mistake,\" said the lady when everything was completed. \"Number 110, Downing Street, Mr. Llewellyn John.\"  \"There ain't goin' to be no mistakes, mum, you may put your 'and on your 'eart,\" Bindle assured her.  \"Cawfee money, mum?\" enquired Tippitt. \"It's 'ot.\" Tippitt never wasted words.  \"Tippy, Tippy! I'm surprised at you!\" Bindle turned upon his colleague reproachfully. \"Only twice 'ave you spoke to-day, an' the second time's to beg. I'm sorry, mum,\" he said, turning to the lady. \"It ain't 'is fault. It's jest 'abit.\"  The lady hesitated for a moment, then taking her purse from her bag, handed Bindle a two-shilling piece.  Tippitt eyed it greedily.  With a final admonition not to forget, the lady drove off.  Bindle looked at the coin, spat on it, and put it in his pocket.  \"Funny thing 'ow a woman'll give a couple o' bob, where a man'll make it 'alf a dollar,\" he remarked.  \"Wot about me?\" enquired Tippitt.  \"Wot about you, Tippy?\" repeated Bindle. \"Well, least said soonest mended. You can't 'elp it.\"  \"But I asked 'er,\" persisted Tippitt.  \"Ah! Tippy,\" remarked Bindle, \"it ain't 'im wot asks; but 'im wot gets. 'Owever, you shall 'ave a stone-ginger at the next stoppin' place. Your ole pal ain't goin' back on you, Tippy.\"  Without a word, Tippitt climbed up into the driver's seat, whilst Bindle clambered on to the tail-board, where he proceeded to fill his pipe with the air of a man for whom time has no meaning.  \"Good job they ain't all like me,\" he muttered. \"I likes a day in the country, now _and_ then; but always! Not me.\" He struck a match, lighted his pipe and, with a sigh of contentment, composed himself to bucolic meditation.  One of the advantages of the moving-profession in Bindle's eyes was that it gave him hours of leisured ease, whilst the goods were in transit. \"You can slack it like a Cuthbert,\" he would say. \"All you 'as to do is to sit on the tail of a van an' watch the world go by--_some_ life that.\"  Bindle was awakened from his contemplation of the hedges and the white road that ribboned out before his eyes by a man coming out of a gate. At the sight of the pantechnicon he grinned and, with a jerk of his thumb, indicated the van as if it were the greatest joke in the world.  Bindle grinned back, although not quite understanding the cause of the man's amusement.  \"'Ot little lot that, mate,\" remarked the man, stepping off the kerb and walking beside the tailboard.  Bindle looked at him, puzzled at the remark.  \"Wot exactly might you be meanin', ole son?\" he enquired.  \"Oh! come orf of it,\" said the man. \"I won't tell your missis. Like a razzle myself sometimes,\" and he laughed, obviously amused at this joke.  Bindle slipped off the tail-board and joined the man, who had returned to the pavement.  \"You evidently seen a joke wot's caught me on the blind side,\" he remarked casually.  \"A joke,\" remarked the man; \"a whole van-load of jokes, if you was to ask me.\"  \"Well, p'raps you're right,\" remarked Bindle philosophically, \"but if there's as many as all that, I should 'ave thought there'd 'ave been enough for two; but as I say, p'raps you're right. These ain't the times for givin' anythink away, although,\" he added meditatively, \"I 'adn't 'eard of their 'avin' rationed jokes as well as meat and sugar. We shall be 'avin' joke-queues soon,\" he added. \"You seem to be a sort of joke-'og, you do.\" Bindle turned and regarded his companion with interest.  \"You mean to say you don't know wot's inside that there van?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32285"],["title","Adventures of Bindle (#4)"],["body"," enquired the man incredulously.  \"Carved-oak dinin'-room furniture, I been told,\" replied Bindle indifferently.  The man laughed loudly. Then turned to Bindle. \"You mean to say you don't know that van's full o' gals?\" he demanded.  \"Full o' wot?\" exclaimed Bindle, coming to a dead stop. His astonishment was too obvious to leave doubt in the man's mind as to its genuineness.  \"Gals an' women,\" he replied. \"Saw 'em gettin' in down the road, out of motors. Dressed in white they was, with coloured sashes over their shoulders. Suffragettes, I should say. They didn't see me though,\" he added.  Bindle gave vent to a low, prolonged whistle as he resumed his walk.  \"'Old me, 'Orace!\" he cried happily. \"Wot 'ud Mrs. B. say if she knew.\" Suddenly he paused again, and slapped his knee.  \"Well, I'm damned!\" he cried. \"A raid, of course.\"  The man looked anxiously up at the blue of the sky.  \"It's all right,\" said Bindle reassuringly. \"My mistake; it was a bird.\"  A few minutes later the man turned off from the main road.  \"Hi! Tippy,\" Bindle hailed, \"don't you forget that stone-ginger at the next dairy.\"  A muttered reply came from Tippitt. Five minutes later he drew up outside a public-house on the outskirts of Wimbledon. Bindle took the opportunity of climbing up on the top of the van, where he gained the information he required. Every inch of the roof was perforated!  \"Air-'oles,\" he muttered with keen satisfaction; \"air-'oles, as I'm a miserable sinner,\" and he clambered down and entered the public-bar, where he convinced Tippitt that his mate could be trusted with money.  When Bindle had drained to the last drop his second pewter, his mind was made up.  \"Number 110, Downing Street,\" he muttered. \"White dresses an' coloured sashes. That's it. Well, Joe Bindle, you can't save the bloomin' British Empire from destruction; but you can save the Prime Minister from 'avin' 'is afternoon nap spoilt, leastwise you can try.  \"I'm a-goin' for a little stroll, Tippy,\" he remarked, as he walked towards the door. \"Back in ten minutes. If you gets lonely, order another pint an' put it down to me.\"  \"Right-o! mate,\" replied Tippitt.  Bindle walked along Wimbledon High Street and turned into an oil-shop.  \"D'you keep lamp black?\" he enquired of the young woman behind the counter.  \"Yes,\" she replied. \"How much do you want, we sell it in packets?\"  \"Let's 'ave a look at a packet,\" said Bindle.  When he had examined it, he ordered two more.  \"Startin' a minstrel troupe,\" he confided to the young woman.  \"But you want burnt cork,\" she said practically; \"lamp black's greasy. You'll never get it off.\"  \"That's jest why I want it,\" remarked Bindle with a grin.  The young woman looked at him curiously and, when he had purchased a pea-puffer as well, she decided that he was a harmless lunatic; but took the precaution of testing the half-crown he tendered by ringing it on the counter.  \"Shouldn't be surprised if we was to 'ave an 'eavy shower of rain in a few minutes,\" remarked Bindle loudly a few minutes later, as he rejoined Tippitt, who was engaged in watering the horses.  Tippitt looked at Bindle, his cigarette wagging. Then turning his eyes up to the cloudless sky in surprise, he finally reached the same conclusion as the young woman at the oil-shop.  \"Now up you get, Tippy,\" admonished Bindle, \"an' there's another drink for you at The Green Lion.\" Bindle knew his London.  As the pantechnicon rumbled heavily along by the side of Wimbledon Common, Bindle whistled softly to himself the refrain of \"The End of a Happy Day.\"  Whilst Tippitt was enjoying his fourth pint that morning at The Green Lion, Bindle borrowed a large watering-can, which was handed up to him on the roof of the pantechnicon by a surprised barman. Bindle emptied the contents of one of the packets of lamp-black into the can, and started to stir it vigorously with a piece of twig he had picked up from the side of the Common. When the water had reluctantly absorbed the lamp-black to Bindle's entire satisfaction, he called out loudly:  \"I knew we was goin' to 'ave a shower,\" and he proceeded to water the top of the pantechnicon. \"Now I must put this 'ere tarpaulin over, or else the water'll get through them 'oles,\" he said.  He clearly heard suppressed exclamations as the water penetrated inside the van. Having emptied the can, he proceeded to drag the tarpaulin over the roof, leaving uncovered only a small portion in the centre.  The barman of The Green Lion had been watching Bindle with open-mouthed astonishment.  \"What the 'ell are you up to, mate?\" he whispered.  Bindle put his forefinger of the right hand to the side of his nose and winked mysteriously. Then going inside The Green Lion he, in a way that did not outrage the regulations that there should be no \"treating,\" had Tippitt's tankard refilled, and called for another for himself.  \"If you watch the papers,\" Bindle remarked to the barman, \"I shouldn't be surprised if you was to see wot I was a-doin' on the top of that there van,\" and again he winked.  The barman looked from Bindle to Tippitt, then touching his forehead with a fugitive first finger, and glancing in the direction of Bindle, made it clear that another was prepared to support the diagnosis of the young woman at the oil-shop.  Bindle completed the journey on the top of the van, industriously occupied in puffing lamp-black through the holes in the roof. His method was to dip the end of the pea-puffer into the packet, then insert it in one of the holes and give a sharp puff. This he did half a dozen times in quick succession. Then he would pause for a few minutes to allow the lamp-black to settle. He argued that if he puffed it all in at once, it would in all probability choke the occupants.  By the time they turned from the King's Road into Ebury Street, Bindle's task was accomplished--the lamp-black was exhausted.  \"Victoria Station,\" he called out loudly to Tippitt. \"Shan't be long now, mate. Another shower a-comin', better cover up these bloomin' 'oles,\" and he drew the tarpaulin over the rest of the roof. \"Let 'em stoo a bit now,\" he muttered to himself. \"That'll make 'em 'ot.\"  He had been conscious of suppressed coughing and sneezing from within, which he detected by placing his ear near the holes in the roof.  Opposite the Houses of Parliament, a lady came up to Bindle and handed him a key. \"This is the key of the pantechnicon,\" she said loudly. \"You are not to undo it until you reach Number 110, Downing Street. Do you understand?\"  \"Right-o!\" remarked Bindle, \"I got it.\"  \"Now don't forget!\" said the lady, and she disappeared swiftly in the direction of Victoria Street.  \"No, I ain't goin' to forget,\" murmured Bindle to himself, \"an' I shouldn't be surprised if there was others wot ain't goin' to forget either.\"  He watched the lady who had given him the key well out of sight, then slipping off the tail-board of the van he walked swiftly along Whitehall.  A few yards south of Downing Street, an inspector of police was meditatively contemplating the flow of traffic north and south.  Bindle went up to him. \"Pretend that I'm askin' the way, sir. I'm most likely bein' watched. I got a van wot's supposed to contain carved-oak furniture for Mr. Llewellyn John, 110, Downing Street. I think it's full o' suffragettes goin' to raid 'im. You get your men round there, the van'll be up in two ticks. Now point as if you was showing me Downing Street.\"  The inspector was a man of quick decision and, looking keenly at Bindle, decided that he was to be trusted.  \"Right!\" he said, then extending an official arm, pointed out Downing Street to Bindle. \"Don't hurry,\" he added.  \"Right-o!\" said Bindle. \"Joseph Bindle's my name. I'm a special, Fulham district.\"  The inspector nodded, and Bindle turned back to the van. A moment later the inspector strolled leisurely through the archway leading to the Foreign Office.  \"That's Downing Street on the left,\" shouted Bindle to Tippitt as he came up, much to Tippitt's surprise. He was at a loss to account for many things that Bindle had done and said that day.  As they turned into Downing Street, Bindle was a little disappointed at finding only two constables; but he was relieved a a moment later by the sight of the inspector to whom he had spoken, hurrying through the archway, leading from the Foreign Office.  \"Where are you going to?\" called out the inspector to Tippitt, taking no notice of Bindle.  Tippitt jerked his thumb in the direction of Bindle, who came forward at that moment.  \"Number 110, Downing Street, sir,\" responded Bindle. \"Some furniture for Mr. Llewellyn John.\"  \"Right!\" said the inspector loudly; \"but you'll have to wait a few minutes until that motor-car has gone.\"  Bindle winked as a sign of his acceptance of the mythical motor-car and, drawing the key of the pantechnicon from his pocket, showed it to the inspector, who, by closing his eyes and slightly bending his head, indicated that he understood.  Tippitt had decided that everybody was mad this morning. The police inspector's reference to a motor-car outside Number 110, whereas his eyes told him that there was nothing there but roadway and dust, had seriously undermined his respect for the Metropolitan Police Force. However, it was not his business. He was there to drive the horses, who in turn drew a van to a given spot; there his responsibility ended.  After a wait of nearly ten minutes, the inspector re-appeared. \"It's all clear now,\" he remarked. \"Draw up.\"  As the pantechnicon pulled up in front of Number 110, Bindle glanced up at the house and saw Mr. Llewellyn John looking out of one of the first-floor windows. He had evidently been apprised of what was taking place.  Bindle noticed that the doors of Number 110 and 111 were both ajar. He was, however, a little puzzled at the absence of police. The two uniformed constables had been reinforced by three others, and there were two obviously plain-clothes men loitering about.  \"Now then, Tippy, get "]]]
