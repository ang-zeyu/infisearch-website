At San Fernando, Paramaribo, Belem, and Natal, of course you will contact the officer in command of the American staff, and not the commanding officer of the airport.\"  The colonel paused for a moment as though permitting time for his instructions to sink in. Then he tapped the pile of heavily sealed, waterproof envelopes with his fingers.  \"These contain information on perhaps the most important secret of this war!\" he continued, speaking in a grave tone. \"The Axis would gladly give up half a dozen divisions of troops for the possession of any one of these envelopes. And that doesn't even begin to describe how important they are. I am the only man in the world who knows of the flight you two are to begin in a few minutes. At least, I pray to God that I'm the only one. However, in view of the fact that absolutely nothing is _sure_ in this war, I must give you this order: Under no circumstances, not even under the threat of the most horrible kind of death, is either of you to permit a single one of these letters to get into the hands of anybody but the American officer whose name is typed on the front of each envelope. Do I make myself clear?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Dawson said with a nod.  \"Definitely, sir,\" Freddy Farmer echoed.  \"And I'm sure you do,\" the colonel said. \"I can't help, though, but stress that point. _Don't let any of these envelopes out of your sight until each has been delivered to the proper person._ Make doubly sure that each of those proper persons understands what he is to do. Naturally, you'll be asked questions by those officers as to what the envelopes contain. That is one reason why I'm not even telling you, so that you can truthfully reply that you do not know. Just remember, this is the most secret mission you have ever undertaken. Guard these envelopes with your lives and see that they are delivered to the proper parties. If the commanding officer does not happen to be there when you arrive, do _not_ give the envelope to the next in command. Stay there until the commanding officer does arrive. If you have a forced landing, play up the fact you are on a survey flight. If your plane is damaged, a wire sent to me in Washington will get an immediate reply ordering the commandant of the airfield nearest the scene of your crash to turn over a plane to you. If one of you happens to be injured in the crash, the other will carry on alone as soon as possible, without creating suspicion that the flight is not for survey purposes.\"  The colonel suddenly stopped talking and drew from his pocket two small vials containing a brownish liquid. He placed them beside the pile of envelopes, and looked at the two air aces again.  \"If both of you are hurt badly,\" he said, \"or if--and I pray God it will not happen--you should fall into the hands of enemy agents, or force-land on the water and be approached by a lurking U-boat, you are to take the caps from these vials and pour the contents over the envelopes. The powerful acid they contain will completely destroy the envelopes and their contents in a matter of seconds. In short, it is your sacred trust to destroy these envelopes before you die--or are captured. Now, to make sure, repeat to me the instructions I've just given you.\"  Dawson spoke for the pair and repeated almost word for word everything the colonel had told them.  \"Well, that's all I've got to say,\" the Intelligence Chief said with a nod. \"Here, Dawson. Three of these and a vial are for you. And the other three and a vial are for you, Farmer. Naturally, my prayers go with you for a safe and very uneventful flight. If it helps any, I personally chose you two for this flight, because--well, you've come through for me several times in the past, and I know you will again. One thing, though. If any of the envelopes fall into Axis hands, I might just as well put a bullet through my brain, because I wouldn't want to go on living. Have either of you any questions?\"  \"Yes, sir, I have one,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up.  \"Then let's have it,\" Colonel Welsh said with a nod.  The English-born air ace hesitated a moment, and a slight flush crept up into his sun-and-wind-bronzed face.  \"These chaps to whom we deliver the envelopes, sir,\" he said with a frown. \"What if they--Well, what I'm trying to say, sir, is supposing _they_ don't follow the orders we give them? What if they should lose their envelopes or--well, you know.\"  \"They won't, Farmer,\" Colonel Welsh said with a grim shake of his head. \"Each of the six officers that you will contact is not only an officer in our Armed Forces, but a carefully selected member of Intelligence as well. In short, each is one of my own men. And after you show them this letter of authority, you need not worry that they won't follow orders right to the letter.\"  As he spoke, the colonel drew a seventh, but unsealed, envelope from his pocket and handed it to Freddy Farmer. Then he turned his head and looked at Dawson's frown.  \"Yes, Dawson?\" he asked. \"You've a question, too?\"  \"A couple, Colonel,\" Dave replied. Then with a shrug, \"The first may strike you as stupid.\"  \"How can I say, until you ask it?\" the Intelligence officer demanded as the Yank air ace didn't go on.  \"These officers we're to contact--\" Dawson said presently--\"is there any way we can make sure that each _is_ the one we believe him to be? In other words, we've just got six names, Colonel. I haven't read them yet, but it's possible that neither Freddy nor I know the men from Adam as far as looks are concerned.\"  \"A mighty good question, Dawson,\" Colonel Welsh said with an emphatic nod. \"Just shows you've got your eye on the ball right at the start. Contact the officer, show him my letter of authority, and demand his identification. It will be a copper disc with some numbers stamped on it. Every set of numbers will add up to forty-one--the year, incidentally, of Pearl Harbor. If the numbers don't add up to forty-one, then he is not your man.\"  \"And if they _don't_ add up to forty-one, sir?\" Freddy Farmer asked, and leaned forward.  Colonel Welsh's lips stiffened, and an agate-hard glint came into his eyes. He pointed to the letter of authority Freddy held in his hands.  \"Use that to have the man placed under close arrest at once!\" he said harshly. \"And get in radiophone communication with me as soon as possible. _If_ the man tries to evade arrest, tries to escape--shoot him dead on the spot! Yes, that's an unusual order, but this is an unusual mission. Now, the other question, Dawson? What is it?\"  \"When we reach Natal, sir,\" Dave said, \"what do we do? Fly back and report to you?\"  \"No,\" the senior officer said with a shake of his head. \"I'm allowing three days for you to make this stop-over flight to Brazil. That should get you in Natal by the fourteenth, the fifteenth at the latest. Put up at the Pan-Am Hotel. I will join you there on the fifteenth. I'll have another little mission for you when I get there. Well, any other questions?\"  Dawson and Farmer looked at each other. Then they looked at Colonel Welsh, and each shook his head. The senior officer stood up, and as though the gods had waited for that exact instant, the Vultee's Wright-Cyclone outside broke forth with its song of mighty power.  \"Then that's that,\" Colonel Welsh said. \"There's some flying gear over there on the wall. Select what you want, and then let's get outside to the plane. I'll stake my life that not a soul has heard what we've been talking about, but four walls always get on my nerves. I like it better out in the open where I can see in all directions, and for some distance, too. But don't pay any attention to me. I'm under a slight strain, and it's trying its darnedest to get me. Stupid, of course. So select your stuff, and let's get out to the plane. God bless you, and all kinds of happy landings until we meet again in Natal, Brazil.\"  If they happened to be listening to the colonel's parting words, the gods of war, and death, and doom, must have had quite a laugh for themselves!     CHAPTER FIVE  _Whispering Death_   Shifting to a slightly more comfortable position in the Vultee's cockpit seat, Dave Dawson absently drummed the fingers of one hand on the side of the cockpit and stared down at the sky-blue Caribbean Sea rolling far beneath his wings. Behind him was Puerto Rico, and a considerable way ahead of him was the British-owned island of Trinidad. Several miles off the Vultee's left wing tip were the Leeward and Windward islands of the West Indies jutting up out of the blue water. High above him was a cloudless sky with a shimmering ball of gold in the center.  All in all, it was a scene that would have made poets rave, and the hardest of hearts melt. However, if the truth must be known, it left Dawson cold. Not because he did not possess an eye for Nature's beauty; it was rather because, though he was looking at it, he wasn't actually seeing it. His mind was too filled with other and more personal thoughts.  The previous night he and Freddy Farmer had taken off from Bolling Field and had flown directly to the Army Air Forces base at Miami. There, after making sure, they had delivered the first of the sealed envelopes. Later they had flown on to the base at San Juan, on Puerto Rico, and delivered the second envelope. Now they were winging their way farther south to the Air Transport Command base at San Fernando on Trinidad.  \"After Trinidad, Paramaribo, and Belem, and Natal,\" Dawson said, and scowled down at the beautiful Caribbean. \"That's just the point, too. A couple of air-mail pilots, that's all we are!\"  \"What's that, Dave?\" he heard Freddy Farmer's voice in the inter-com phones. \"What are you mumbling about?\"  \"Mumbling?\" Dawson snorted. \"I was shouting with joy! I'm so excited that I can hardly keep from jumping overboard. And now that I think of it, maybe that _would_ be a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32331"],["title","Dave Dawson at Casablanca (#5)"],["body","idea!\"  \"Then go right ahead, old thing,\" the English youth in the rear pit chuckled. \"Nothing I want more than for you to have your own way, you know.\"  \"Don't look right now, but you can go fly a kite to the moon, pal!\" Dawson growled. \"I suppose you're enjoying this here-to-there hop in the sky?\"  \"Well, I _have_ seen better piloting,\" Freddy came right back. \"But, considering one thing and all, I'm not too fed up--yet. On the other hand, it is a bit boring. I mean--\"  \"You mean what?\" Dave asked as Freddy let the rest hang in mid-air.  \"Don't know just how to put it in words,\" young Farmer replied. \"But--well, after that little talk with the colonel last night, I was quite steamed up, as you would say. Very mysterious, and exciting, and possibly dangerous, if you get what I mean.\"  \"I do,\" Dawson grunted. \"But all it is to me now is mysterious. You can have my share of the excitement and danger, if any. I'm just full of beans, though, I guess. After some of the close shaves you and I have had, routine stuff just gets me down, but quickly! But there have been two bright spots in this thing so far, thank goodness.\"  \"Bright spots?\" Freddy Farmer echoed. \"Then I must have been looking the other way at the time. What do you mean?\"  \"At Miami and San Juan,\" Dawson replied. \"The way those two commanding officers tried to pump us as to what the sealed envelopes contained. It was nice to look very wise and not tell them a darn thing. It was fun to see somebody else floundering around in the dark. Misery loves company. Say! Know what I hope, Freddy?\"  \"I wouldn't even dare guess!\" the English-born air ace replied. \"What do you hope?\"  \"That the lad we contact at San Fernando has a copper disc with numbers that add up to forty-five!\" Dawson told him.  \"What?\" young Farmer gasped. \"Forty-five? But, Dave, the number is--\"  \"Sure, forty-one!\" Dawson cut in. \"But don't you catch on, pal? If the number is forty-five, it means that the lad is a phoney. And that means that maybe we'll get some excitement out of this aerial messenger boy job.\"  \"Rot, and very much so!\" Freddy snapped angrily. \"Come off it, Dave! This is very serious business, and you are absolutely balmy to even hope that things will go wrong. Just remember what Colonel Welsh said, Dave. If one of these sealed envelopes should fall into Axis hands, he'd rather put a bullet in his brain than go on living. Stop being a blasted fool, old thing! It's not a bit like you at all!\"  \"Okay, okay, papa!\" Dawson chuckled. \"Consider that you have up-ended me and given me the shingle where it counts most. Just the same, I hate to think of going stark, raving mad in the cockpit of a Wright-powered Vultee.\"  \"Well, if that's all that's bothering you, you can put it out of your mind at once,\" Freddy snapped, \"because you were that way a long, long time ago!\"  \"Oh, yeah?\" Dawson shouted.  \"Yeah!\" Freddy Farmer replied. \"But definitely!\"  They left it that way for the next fifteen minutes or so. At the end of that time the Vultee was well out of sight of all land, and Dawson was keeping it on course with instruments. At the end of that time, too, the southern part of the heavens began to mist and fog up and gradually change to a copperish gray. The straight line that marked where the blue of the sky ended and the copperish gray began told Dawson that a line squall was moving across the Caribbean. But five minutes later the little twinge of uneasiness that had come to him melted away, because the copperish gray moved westward and not up northward toward the Vultee. However, because of the silly mood that had gripped him since leaving Puerto Rico, he had to voice a crazy thought.  \"Wouldn't you know, not even a storm to give us something extra to do!\"  \"Eh, Dave?\" he heard Freddy Farmer say. Then a second later, he felt Farmer's hand tapping him on the shoulder, and heard his pal's excited voice crackling in his inter-com phones. \"Bear ten degrees eastward, Dave! There's something down there on the water. Can't see it clearly yet. Looks like a bit of rag being waved about by somebody.\"  Dawson changed the Vultee's course, and at the same time twisted around in the seat and glanced back at Freddy. Then he turned front and peered ahead and down in the direction of the English youth's pointed finger. He squinted his eyes slightly and even shielded them against the golden sun with his free hand. But for all he could see, he might just as well have kept both eyes shut. There was just blue Caribbean, turned golden here and there by shafts of sunlight dancing off the surfaces of the rolling swells.  \"I know you can see through a brick wall, Freddy,\" he said, \"but if you can see anything down there, then I'll eat it!\"  \"It will be quite a meal!\" Freddy Farmer cried. \"Because it happens to be a life raft! And there are chaps on it. Yes, four chaps! And one is waving his shirt, or something. Blast those dirty U-boat blighters!\"  \"Never mind the U-boats!\" Dawson growled. \"Just stick to the raft. Where the heck is it? I think you're seeing things. I--Hold it, everybody; hold it! I see it now, Freddy! I wasn't looking far enough out. Yeah! That's a raft sure enough. Boy! I bet this sun is doing plenty to those birds!\"  As Dawson spoke, he watched the small raft riding the rolling swells of the blue Caribbean, as helpless as a leaf. As he stared at the four figures in the raft, his anger boiled and the blood throbbed in his temples. Dirty U-boat blighters, and how, as Freddy had said. Of all the fighting forces to come out of Nazi Germany, the U-boat commanders and crews were the worst. Human life, and particularly the lives of women and children, meant even less to them than it did to the Gestapo. Steel sharks of the sea, they were called. To call them that was an insult to a real man-eating shark. There just wasn't any name to call those who manned Nazi U-boats, because there is no name in any language that adequately describes them.  Yes, the dirty U-boat blighters! Down there on the bobbing raft were four who were no doubt victims of a terrible life-and-ship-destroying explosion that had probably come in the dark of night. As those and other bitter thoughts raced through Dawson's mind, he impulsively eased back the Wright-Cyclone's throttle and slanted the nose of the Vultee downward.  \"How I wish this was a flying boat, and we could pick up those poor beggars!\" he heard Freddy Farmer groan.  \"You and me both!\" Dave agreed. \"We have a radio, thank goodness. So we can get help sent out before those fellows have to spend another night at sea. I wonder how long they've been floating around?\"  \"Quite some time, I fancy,\" Freddy Farmer said. \"The chap waving his shirt seems to be the only one with any life in him. The three huddled down in the raft might as well be dead. Sights like that one make me thank my lucky stars I'm in the air end of this blasted war.\"  \"You can say that again for me!\" Dawson echoed. \"At least in the air you get it clean and fast. Mostly, anyway. Check and double-check! The boys that really deserve the medals and the praise in this scrap are the merchant marine fellows. They have nothing to fight back with except a pea-shooter at the stern, and maybe one on the bow. They're perfect floating targets twenty-four hours a day. If their engines break down, heaven help them! Yes, my hat is off to those fellows, and I don't mean maybe. I--Hey, Freddy! See that? He's trying to send us a message with his shirt, isn't he? He seems to be waving it down to the right more than down to the left.\"  \"That's right!\" Freddy Farmer cried. \"That's the old International Morse code done with a flag. To the right is a dot, and to the left is a dash. And straight down in front means the end of a word. Now, where's my blasted pencil, and I'll put it down. There he put it down in front three times! That means the end of the message. If he'll only repeat it, I think I can get it.\"  The man standing on the tiny raft seemed to wait a moment or two, as though he were striving to rally his waning strength for another effort. Then he started waving his shirt again. It was a short message, and both boys got it without bothering to jot down each letter. The message signaled was:  FLY OVER LOW PLEASE, IMPORTANT  \"What do you make of that, Freddy?\" Dawson asked, and dipped the Vultee's nose even more. \"Does he think we're a rescue plane that's come to drop food and water, poor devil?\"  \"I don't know,\" the English youth replied. \"Possibly. Or maybe there's something on the raft he wants us to see. The only thing to do is to go down and find out. I say! I've just remembered! I have some chocolate, Dave. I'll tie it up in my handkerchief and try to drop it right onto the raft, if you get us down low enough. But, for heaven's sake, don't hit the raft, or the water!\"  \"Aw gee!\" Dawson grated at him. \"And that's just what I was planning to do, too! You spoil all my fun, you dope! Act your age, will you?\"  \"Just don't take us down too low,\" Freddy Farmer reminded him evenly.  Dawson opened his mouth to make a fitting retort. Instead he shrugged, let Freddy's remark slide, and concentrated on getting the Vultee down as low as he possibly could. When he had reached an altitude of some ten or fifteen feet, he throttled the Wright Cyclone until it was just a shade on the good side of stalling. He guided it toward the tiny life raft. The shirt-waver had ceased his signaling and was crouching down on the raft as though he were afraid Dawson was going to bounce the Vultee's belly off the top of his hatless head.  \"So you're also silly enough to think I'll come too close?\" Dawson growled, as he experienced a moment of annoyance. \"Well, relax, fellow! Just relax, and let's have a look at the meaning of that message. Okay, Freddy! Get set to drop that chocolate!\"  As he spoke, he impulsively started to jerk his head around. Some inner warning cut short his effort, and it was that inner warning that"]]]
