CHR. ASBJÃ–RNSEN   TRANSLATED BY  H. L. BROEKSTAD.   BOSTON  DANA ESTES AND CO.  PUBLISHERS   _Copyright, 1895,_  BY ESTES AND LAURIAT  _All rights reserved_   Colonial Press  Electrotyped and Printed by C. H. Simonds & Co.  Boston, Mass., U. S. A.     'ROUND THE YULE-LOG.   The wind was whistling through the old lime and maple trees opposite my windows, the snow was sweeping down the street, and the sky was black as a December sky can possibly be here in Christiania. I was in just as black a mood. It was Christmas Eve,--the first I was to spend away from the cosey fireside of my home. I had lately received my officer's commission, and had hoped that I should have gladdened my aged parents with my presence during the holidays, and had also hoped that I should be able to show myself in all my glory and splendour to the ladies of our parish. But a fever had brought me to the hospital, which I had left only a week before, and now I found myself in the much-extolled state of convalescence. I had written home for a horse and sledge and my father's fur coat, but my letter could scarcely reach our valley before the day after Christmas, and the horse could not be in town before New Year's Eve.  My comrades had all left town, and I knew no family with whom I could make myself at home during the holidays. The two old maids I lodged with were certainly very kind and friendly people, and they had taken great care of me in the commencement of my illness, but the peculiar ways and habits of these ladies were too much of the old school to prove attractive to the fancies of youth. Their thoughts dwelt mostly on the past; and when they, as often might occur, related to me some stories of the town, its people and its customs, these stories reminded me, not only by their contents, but also by the simple, unaffected way in which they were rendered, of a past age.  [Illustration: Picture of two old maids]  The antiquated appearance of these ladies was also in the strictest harmony with the house in which they lived. It was one of those old houses in Custom House Street, with deep windows, long dark passages and staircases, gloomy rooms and garrets, where one could not help thinking of ghosts and brownies; in short, just such a house, and perhaps it was the very one, which Mauritz Hansen has described in his story, \"The Old Dame with the Hood.\" Their circle of acquaintances was very limited; besides a married sister and her children, no other visitors came there but a couple of tiresome old ladies. The only relief to this kind of life was a pretty niece and some merry little cousins of hers, who always made me tell them fairy tales and stories.  I tried to divert myself in my loneliness and melancholy mood by looking out at all the people who passed up and down the street in the snow and wind, with blue noses and half-shut eyes. It amused me to see the bustle and the life in the apothecary's shop across the street. The door was scarcely shut for a moment. Servants and peasants streamed in and out, and commenced to study the labels and directions when they came out in the street. Some appeared to be able to make them out, but sometimes a lengthy study and a dubious shake of the head showed that the solution was too difficult. It was growing dusk. I could not distinguish the countenances any longer, but gazed across at the old building. The apothecary's house, \"The Swan,\" as it is still called, stood there, with its dark, reddish-brown walls, its pointed gables and towers, with weather-cocks and latticed windows, as a monument of the architecture of the time of King Christian the Fourth. The Swan looked then, as now, a most respectable and sedate bird, with its gold ring round its neck, its spur-boots, and its wings stretched out as if to fly. I was about to plunge myself into reflection on imprisoned birds when I was disturbed by noise and laughter proceeding from some children in the adjoining room, and by a gentle, old-maidish knock at my door.  [Illustration: Picture of an old maid knocking at the door]  On my requesting the visitor to come in, the elder of my landladies, Miss Mette, entered the room with a courtesy in the good old style; she inquired after my health, and invited me, without further ceremony, to come and make myself at home with them for the evening. \"It isn't good for you, dear Lieutenant, to sit thus alone here in the dark,\" she added. \"Will you not come in to us now at once? Old Mother Skau and my brother's little girls have come; they will perhaps amuse you a little. You are so fond of the dear children.\"  [Illustration: Picture of an old woman wearing a cap]  I accepted the friendly invitation. As I entered the room, the fire from the large square stove, where the logs were burning lustily, threw a red, flickering light through the wide-open door over the room, which was very deep, and furnished in the old style, with high-back, Russia leather chairs, and one of those settees which were intended for farthingales and straight up-and-down positions. The walls were adorned with oil paintings, portraits of stiff ladies with powdered coiffures, of bewigged Oldenborgians, and other redoubtable persons in mail and armour or red coats.  [Illustration: Picture of the narrator looking at the paintings]  \"You must really excuse us, Lieutenant, for not having lighted the candles yet,\" said Miss Cicely, the younger sister, who was generally called \"Cilly,\" and who came towards me and dropped a courtesy, exactly like her sister's; \"but the children do so like to tumble about here before the fire in the dusk of the evening, and Madam Skau does also enjoy a quiet little chat in the chimney corner.\"  \"Oh, chat me here and chat me there! there is nothing you like yourself better than a little bit of gossip in the dusk of the evening, Cilly, and then we are to get the blame of it,\" answered the old asthmatic lady whom they called Mother Skau.  \"Eh! good evening, sir,\" she said to me, as she drew herself up to make the best of her own inflated, bulky appearance. \"Come and sit down here and tell me how it fares with you; but, by my troth, you are nothing but skin and bones!\"  I had to tell her all about my illness, and in return I had to endure a very long and circumstantial account of her rheumatism and her asthmatical ailments, which, fortunately, was interrupted by the noisy arrival of the children from the kitchen, where they had paid a visit to old Stine, a fixture in the house.  \"Oh, auntie, do you know what Stine says?\" cried a little brown-eyed beauty. \"She says I shall go with her into the hay-loft to-night and give the brownie his Christmas porridge. But I won't go; I am afraid of the brownies!\"  \"Never mind, my dear, Stine says it only to get rid of you; she dare not go into the hay-loft herself--the foolish old thing--in the dark, for she knows well enough she was frightened once by the brownies herself,\" said Miss Mette. \"But are you not going to say good evening to the Lieutenant, children?\"  \"Oh, is that you, Lieutenant? I did not know you. How pale you are! It is such a long time since I saw you!\" shouted the children all at once, as they flocked round me.  \"Now you must tell us something awfully jolly! It is such a long time since you told us anything. Oh, tell us about Buttercup, dear Mr. Lieutenant, do tell us about Buttercup and Goldentooth!\"  I had to tell them about Buttercup and the dog Goldentooth, but they would not let me off until I gave them a couple of stories into the bargain about the brownies at Vager and at Bure, who stole hay from each other, and who met at last with a load of hay on their backs, and how they fought till they vanished in a cloud of hay-dust. I had also to tell them the story of the brownie at Hesselberg, who teased the house-dog till the farmer came out and threw him over the barn bridge. The children clapped their hands in great joy and laughed heartily.  [Illustration: Picture of two brownies fighting]  \"It served him right, the naughty brownie!\" they shouted, and asked for another story.  \"Well,\" said I, \"I will tell you the story of Peter Gynt and the trolls.  \"In the olden days there lived in Kvam a hunter whose name was Peter Gynt, and who was always roaming about in the mountains after bears and elks, for in those days there were more forests on the mountains than there are now, and consequently plenty of wild beasts.  \"One day, shortly before Christmas, Peter set out on an expedition. He had heard of a farm on Doorefell "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31993"],["title","'Round the yule-log: Christmas in Norway (#1)"],["body","was invaded by such a number of trolls every Christmas Eve that the people on the farm had to move out, and get shelter at some of their neighbours'. He was anxious to go there, for he had a great fancy to come across the trolls, and see if he could not overcome them. He dressed himself in some old ragged clothes, and took a tame white bear which he had with him, as well as an awl, some pitch and twine. When he came to the farm he went in and asked for lodgings.  [Illustration: Picture of Peter Gynt and his tame white bear]  \"'God help us!' said the farmer; 'we can't give you any lodgings. We have to clear out of the house ourselves soon and look for lodgings, for every Christmas Eve we have the trolls here.'  \"But Peter thought he should be able to clear the trolls out,--he had done such a thing before; and then he got leave to stay, and a pig's skin into the bargain. The bear lay down behind the fireplace, and Peter took out his awl and pitch and twine, and began making a big, big shoe, which it took the whole pig's skin to make. He put a strong rope in for lacings, that he might pull the shoe tightly together, and, finally, he armed himself with a couple of handspikes.  \"Shortly he heard the trolls coming. They had a fiddler with them, and some began dancing, while others fell to eating the Christmas fare on the table,--some fried bacon, and some fried frogs and toads, and other nasty things which they had brought with them. During this some of the trolls found the shoe Peter had made. They thought it must belong to a very big foot. They all wanted to try it on at once, so they put a foot each into it; but Peter made haste and tightened the rope, took one of the handspikes and fastened the rope around it, and got them at last securely tied up in the shoe.  \"Just then the bear put his nose out from behind the fireplace, where he was lying, and smelt they were frying something.  \"'Will you have a sausage, pussy?' said one of the trolls, and threw a hot frog right into the bear's jaws.  \"'Scratch them, pussy!' said Peter.  \"The bear got so angry that he rushed at the trolls and scratched them all over, while Peter took the other handspike and hammered away at them as if he wanted to beat their brains out. The trolls had to clear out at last, but Peter stayed and enjoyed himself with all the Christmas fare the whole week. After that the trolls were not heard of there for many years.  \"Some years afterwards, about Christmas time, Peter was out in the forest cutting wood for the holidays, when a troll came up to him and shouted,--  [Illustration: Picture of a troll shouting at Peter Gynt]  \"'Have you got that big pussy of yours, yet?'  \"'Oh, yes! she is at home behind the fireplace,' said he; 'and she has got seven kittens, all bigger and larger than herself.'  \"'We'll never come to you any more, then,' said the troll, and they never did.\"  The children were all delighted with this story.  \"Tell us another, dear Lieutenant,\" they all shouted in chorus.  \"No, no, children! you bother the Lieutenant too much,\" said Miss Cicely. \"Aunt Mette will tell you a story now.\"  \"Yes, do, auntie, do!\" was the general cry.  \"I don't know exactly what I shall tell you,\" said Aunt Mette, \"but since we have commenced telling about the brownies, I think I will tell you something about them, too. You remember, of course, old Kari Gausdal, who came here and baked bread, and who always had so many tales to tell you.\"  \"Oh, yes, yes!\" shouted the children.  \"Well, old Kari told me that she was in service at the orphan asylum some years ago, and at that time it was still more dreary and lonely in that part of the town than it is now. That asylum is a dark and dismal place, I can tell you. Well, when Kari came there she was cook, and a very smart and clever girl she was. She had, one day, to get up very early in the morning to brew, when the other servants said to her,--  \"'You had better mind you don't get up too early, and you mustn't put any fire under the copper before two o'clock.'  \"'Why?' she asked.  \"'Don't you know there is a brownie here? And you ought to know that those people don't like to be disturbed so early,' they said; 'and before two o'clock you mustn't light the fire by any means.'  \"'Is that all?' said Kari. She was anything but chicken-hearted. 'I have nothing to do with that brownie of yours, but if he comes in my way, why, by my faith, I will send him head over heels through the door.'  \"The others warned her, but she did not care a bit, and next morning, just as the clock struck one, she got up and lighted the fire under the copper in the brewhouse; but the fire went out in a moment. Somebody appeared to be throwing the logs about on the hearth, but she could not see who it was. She gathered the logs together, one at a time, but it was of no use, and the chimney would not draw, either. She got tired of this at last, took a burning log and ran around the room with it, swinging it high and low while she shouted, 'Be gone, be gone whence you came! If you think you can frighten me you are mistaken.' 'Curse you!' somebody hissed in one of the darkest corners. 'I have had seven souls in this house; I thought I should have got eight in all!' 'But from that time nobody saw or heard the brownie in the asylum,' said Kari Gausdal.\"  [Illustration: Picture of Kari swinging the burning log]  \"I am getting so frightened!\" said one of the children. \"No, you must tell us some more stories, Lieutenant; I never feel afraid when you tell us anything, because you tell us such jolly tales.\" Another proposed that I should tell them about the brownie who danced the Halling dance with the lassie. That was a tale I didn't care much about, as there was some singing in it. But they would on no account let me off, and I was going to clear my throat and prepare my exceedingly inharmonious voice to sing the Halling dance, which belongs to the story, when the pretty niece, whom I have already referred to, entered the room, to the great joy of the children and to my rescue.  \"Well, my dear children, I will tell you the story, if you can get cousin Lizzie to sing the Halling for you,\" said I, as she sat down, \"and then you'll dance to it yourselves, won't you?\"  Cousin Lizzie was besieged by the children, and had to promise to do the singing, so I commenced my story.  \"There was, once upon a time,--I almost think it was in Hallingdal,--a lassie who was sent up into the hay-loft with the cream porridge for the brownie,--I cannot recollect if it was on a Thursday or on a Christmas Eve, but I think it was a Christmas Eve. Well, she thought it was a great pity to give the brownie such a dainty dish, so she ate the porridge herself, and the melted butter in the bargain, and went up into the hay-loft with the plain oatmeal porridge and sour milk, in a pig's trough instead. 'There, that's good enough for you, Master Brownie,' she said. But no sooner had she spoken the words than the brownie stood right before her, seized her round the waist, and danced about with her, which he kept up till she lay gasping for breath, and when the people came up into the hay-loft in the morning, she was more dead than alive. But as long as they danced, the brownie sang,\" (and here Cousin Lizzie undertook his part, and sang to the tune of the Halling)--  [Illustration: Picture of the girl lying in the hay-loft]      \"And you have eaten the porridge for the brownie,     And you shall dance with the little brownie!      \"And have you eaten the porridge for the brownie?     Then you shall dance with the little brownie!\"  I assisted in keeping time by stamping on the floor with my feet, while the children romped about the room in uproarious joy.  \"I think you are turning the house upside down, children!\" said old Mother Skau; \"if you'll be quiet, I'll give you a story.\"  The children were soon quiet, and Mother Skau commenced as follows:  [Illustration: Picture of a Brownie hurling dishes on the floor]  \"You hear a great deal about brownies and fairies and such like beings, but I don't believe there is much in it. I have neither seen one nor the other. Of course I have not been so very much about in my lifetime, but I believe it is all nonsense. But old Stine out in the kitchen there, she says she has seen the brownie. About the time when I was confirmed she was in service with my parents. She came to us from a captain's, who had given up the sea. It was a very quiet place. The captain only took a walk as far as the quay every day. They always went to bed early. People said there was a brownie in the house. Well, it so happened that Stine and the cook were sitting in their room one evening, mending and darning their things; it was near bedtime, for the watchman had already sung out 'Ten o'clock!' but somehow the darning and the sewing went on very slowly indeed; every moment 'Jack Nap' came and played his tricks upon them. At one moment Stine was nodding and nodding, and then came the cook's turn,--they could not keep their eyes open; they had been up early that morning to wash clothes. But just as they were sitting thus, they heard a terrible crash down stairs in the kitchen, and Stine shouted, 'Lor' bless and preserve us! it must be the brownie.' She was so frightened she dared scarcely move a foot, but at last the cook plucked up courage and went down into the kitchen, closely followed by Stine. When they opened the kitchen door they found all the crockery on the floor, but none of it broken, while the brownie was standing on the big kitchen table with his red cap on, and hurling one dish after the other on to the floor, and laughing in great glee. The cook had heard that the brownies could sometimes be tricked into moving into another house when anybody would tell them of a very quiet place, and as she long had been wishing for an opportunity to play a trick upon this brownie, she took courage and spoke to him,--her voice was a little shaky at the time,--that he"]]]
