Of the four, he alone knew every inch of the physical set-up of the refinery. So?\"  \"Yes. That's right. But that doesn't say where--Wait a minute, though. If he'd just shoved it in a crack somewhere in the mountains, he'd know a detector might find it, more easily than before it was dug. He'd have put it some where deep, deeper than he could possibly dig. Maybe in an abandoned mine?\"  \"No place,\" said Shearing, \"is too deep for us to probe. We've examined every abandoned mine on that side of Titan. And it doesn't fit, anyway. No. Try again.\"  \"He wouldn't have brought it back to the refinery. One of us would be sure to find it. Unless, of course--\"  Hyrst stopped, and the tension in the sick-bay tightened another notch. The ship lurched sharply, swerved, and shot upward with a deafening thunder of rocket-blasts. Hyrst shut his eyes, thinking hard.  \"Unless he put it in some place so dangerous that nobody ever went there. A place where even he didn't go, but which he would know about being the engineer.\"  \"Can you think of any place that would answer that description?\"  \"Yes,\" said Hyrst slowly. \"The underground storage bins. They're always hot, even when they're empty. Anything hidden near them would be blanketed by radiation. No detector would see anything but uranium. Probably even you wouldn't.\"  \"No,\" said Shearing, looking amazed. \"Probably we wouldn't. The radioactive disturbance would be too strong to get through, even if we were looking for something beyond it, which we weren't.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Christina had sprung up. Now she bent over Hyrst and said, \"But is there a way it could have been done? Obviously, the Titanite couldn't have been put directly into the bin with the uranium--if nothing else, it would have been shipped out in the next tanker.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Hyrst. \"There would be several ways. I can think of a couple myself, and I've never even see the layout. The repair-lift shaft, I know, goes clear down to the feeder mechanism, and there's some kind of a system of dispersal tunnels and an emergency gadget that trips automatically to release a liquid-graphite damping material into them in case the radiation level gets too high. I don't remember that it ever did, but it's a safeguard. There'd be plenty of places to hide a lead box full of Titanite.\"  \"_Unless I show them how_,\" repeated Shearing slowly, and began to undo the straps that held Hyrst to the table. \"It has an ominous sound. I'll bet you that locating the Titanite will be child's play compared to getting it out. Well, we'll do what we can.\"  \"The first thing,\" said Christina grimly, \"is to get rid of Bellaver. If he has the slightest suspicion where we're headed he'll radio ahead and have all Titan alerted.\"  Hyrst, sitting up now on the edge of the table, hanging on against the lurching of the ship, said, \"That's right--he owns the refinery now, doesn't he? Is it still working?\"  \"No. The mines around there played out, oh, ten, fifteen years ago. The activity's shifted to the north and east on the other side of the range. That is what may possibly give us a chance.\" Shearing staggered with Hyrst across the bucking deck and sat tailor-fashion in the bunk, his eyes intent. \"Hyrst, I want you to remember everything you can about the refinery. The ground plan, exactly where the buildings are, the hoists, the landing field. Everything.\"  Hyrst said, showing the edges of his teeth, \"When do I get Vernon?\"  \"You'll get him. I promise you.\"  \"What about Bellaver? He's still behind us.\"  Shearing smiled. \"That's Christina's job! Let her worry.\"  Hyrst nodded. He began to remember the refinery. Christina and the other two went out.  A short while later a number of things happened, violently, and in quick succession. The ship of the Lazarites, pursuing its wild and headlong course through the swarming debris of the Belt, was far ahead of Bellaver's yacht but still within instrument range. Apparently in desperation it plunged suddenly on a tangential course into a cluster of great jagged rocks all travelling together at a furious rate of speed. The cluster was perhaps two hundred miles across. The Lazarite ship twisted and turned, and then there was a swift bright flowering of flame, and then nothing.  \"She's blown her tubes,\" said Bellaver exultantly, on the bridge of his yacht. The instruments had lost contact, chiefly because the cluster was so thick that it was impossible to separate one body from another.  Vernon said, \"They're not blanking my mind any more. It stopped, like that.\"  But he was still doubtful.  \"Can you locate the ship?\" asked Bellaver.  \"I'm trying.\"  Bellaver caught his arm. \"Look there!\"  There was a second, larger and more brilliant, flash of flame.  \"They've hit an asteroid,\" he said. \"They're done for.\"  \"I can't locate them,\" Vernon said. \"No ship, no wreckage. It could be a trick. They could be holding a cloak.\"  \"A trick?\" said Bellaver. \"I doubt it. Anyway, we're running low on fuel, and I'm not going to go into that cluster and risk my own neck to find out. If by any chance they do come out again later on, we'll deal with them.\"  But they both watched the cluster until it had whirled on out of sight. And neither eye nor instrument nor Vernon's probing mind could distinguish any sign of life.     CHAPTER VIII   Titan lay below them in the Saturn-glow, under the fantastic glory of the Rings. A bitter, repellent world of jagged peaks and glimmering plains of poison snow. The tiny life-raft dropped toward it, skittering nervously as it hit the thin atmosphere. Hyrst clung hard to the handholds, trying not to retch. He was not habituated to space anyway, and the skiff had been bad enough. Now, without any hull around him and nothing but a curved shield in front of him, he felt like an ant on a flying leaf.  \"I don't like it either.\" Shearing said. \"But it gives us a fifty-fifty chance of getting through unnoticed. Radar usually isn't looking for anything so small.\"  \"_I_ understand all the reasons,\" Hyrst said. \"It's my stomach that's obtuse.\"  He could make out the pattern of the refinery now, a million miles of vertigo below him. The Lazarite ship was somewhere up and out behind them, hiding in the Rings. The trick had worked with Bellaver out there in the Belt, and they hoped now that it would work with Bellaver's observers on Titan. There was no need for any fake explosions this time, to give the impression of destruction. Secrecy was the watch-word, all lights out and jet-blasts muffled to a spark. Later, when Hyrst and Shearing had accomplished their mission, the ship would drop down fast and take them off, with the Titanite, before any patrol craft would have time to arrive.  They hoped.  The buildings of the refinery were dark and cold, drifted out of shape by an accumulation of the thin, evil snow. The spiderweb of roads had faded from the plain, and the landing field was smooth and unmarked. Around its perimeter the six stiff towers of the hoists stood up like lonely sentinels, hooded and cloaked.  Hyrst felt a sudden tightening of his throat, and this was a thing he had not expected. A refinery on Titan was hardly a thing to be sentimental about. But it was bound up so intimately with other things, with hopes for a future that was now far behind him, with plans for Elena and the kids that were now a cruel mockery, with friendly memories of Saul and Landers, now long dead, that he could not look at it unmoved.  \"Let's try again,\" said Shearing quietly. \"If we could locate the Titanite definitely it might make all the difference. We'll hardly have time to search all six of the bins.\"  Glad of the distraction, Hyrst tried. He linked his mind to Shearing's and they probed with this double probe, one after the other, the six hoists and the bins beneath them, while the raft fell whistling down the air.  It was the same as all the tries before. The bins had been empty for more than a decade, but the residual radiation was still hot enough to present a luminous haze to the eyes of the mind, fogging everything around it.  \"Wait a minute,\" Hyrst said. \"Let's use our wits. Look at the way those hoists are placed, in a wide crescent. Now if I was MacDonald, coming in from the mountains with a load of Titanite, and I wanted not to be seen, which one would I pick?\"  \"Either One or Six,\" said Shearing, without hesitation. \"They're the farthest away from the buildings.\"  \"But Number Six is at the west end of the crescent, and to reach it you would have to go clear across the landing field.\" He pointed mentally to Number One. \"I'll bet on that one. Shall we give it another try?\"  They did. This time, for a fleeting second, Hyrst thought he had something.  \"So did I,\" said Shearing. \"Sort of down under and _behind_.\"  \"Yes,\" said Hyrst. \"_Look_ out!\" His involuntary cry was caused by the sudden collision of the life-raft with a cloud. The vapor was very thick, and after the cruel clarity of space it made Hyrst feel that he was smothering. Shearing jockeyed the raft's meagre controls, and in a minute or two they were below the cloud and spiralling down toward the landing field. It was snowing.  \"Good,\" said Shearing. \"We'll hope it keeps up.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They landed close to Number One Hoist and floundered rapidly through the shallow drifts, carrying some things. The hatch had been sealed with a plastic spray to prevent corrosion, and it took them several minutes to get it open. Inside the tower it was pitch black, but they did not need lights. Their other senses showed them the worn metal treads of the steps quite clearly. In the upper chamber the indicator panels were dark and dead. Hyrst shivered inside his suit. He had been here so many times before, so long ago.  \"Let's get busy,\" Shearing said.  They pulled on the rayproofs they had brought with them from the raft. Without power the lift was useless, but the skeleton cage,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32498"],["title","The Brain (#0)"],["body","BRAIN                            By Alexander Blade  [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Stories October 1948.

It filled a whole mountain--and then it came to life...!]     CHAPTER I   Cautiously the young flight engineer stretched his cramped legs across some gadgets in his crowded little compartment. Leaning back in his swivel chair he folded a pair of freckled hands behind his neck and smiled at Lee.  \"This is it doctor; we're almost there.\"  The tall and lanky man at the frame of the door didn't seem to understand. Bending forward he peered through the little window near the engineer's desk, into the blue haze of the jets and down to the earth below, a vast bowl of desert land gleaming like silver in the glow of the sunrise.  \"But this couldn't possibly be Washington,\" he finally said in a puzzled tone. \"Why, we crossed the California coast only half an hour ago. Even at 1200 miles an hour we couldn't be almost there.\"  The engineer's smile broadened into a friendly grin: \"No, we're not anywhere near Washington. But in a couple of minutes you'll see Cephalon and that's as far as we go. One professor and 15 tons of termites to be flown from Wallabawalla Mission station, Northern Territory, Australia, to Cephalon, Arizona, U.S.A., one way direct. Those are our instructions. Say, this is the queerest cargo I've ever flown, doctor, if you don't mind my saying so.\"  Lee blinked. Removing his glasses which were fairly thick, he wiped them carefully and put them on again as if to get a clearer picture of an unexpected situation. His long fingered hand went through his greying hair and then down the cheek which was sallow, stained with the atabrine from his latest malaria attack and badly in need of a shave. His mouth formed a big \"O\" of surprise as nervously he said:  \"I don't get it. I don't understand this business at all. First the Department of Agriculture extends an urgent letter of invitation to a completely forgotten man out there in the Never-Never land. Then almost on the heels of the letter the government sends a plane. I would have been glad to mail to the Department samples of \"Ant-termes Pacificus\" sufficient for most scientific purposes if they needed them for experiments in termite control; that would have been the simple and the sensible thing to do. But no, they want everything I have; you fellows drop out of the sky with a sort of habeas corpus and a whole wrecking crew. You disturb the lives of my species, which took me ten years to breed; you pack up their mounds lock, stock and barrel. And then you drop me at some place I never even heard about--Cephalon. What is this Cephalon, anyway? If the place had any connotations to entomology, I would have known about it....\"         *       *       *       *       *  The flight engineer glanced at the irritated scientist curiously and sympathetically: \"If you don't know, I couldn't tell you what it's all about myself, I'm sure,\" he said slowly. \"Cephalon--Cephalon is a place alright, but it doesn't show on the map. Sort of a Shangri-la, if you know what I mean.\"  This cryptic statement failed to have a calming effect on Lee. \"Nonsense,\" he frowned. \"If it is an inhabited place it must be on the map and if it isn't on the map the place doesn't exist.\"  \"Look here,\" the flight engineer pointed through the window to the horizon ahead. \"What do you think this is, doctor, a mirage?\"  Lee stared at the apparition which swiftly materialized out of the ground haze at the plane's supersonic speed. \"It _does_ look like a mirage,\" he said judiciously. \"Is that Cephalon?\"  The engineer nodded. \"Prettiest little town in the U. S. for my money. Ideal airport, too. Rather unusual though--I mean the architecture. Take a good look while we're circling around for the come-in signal.\"  Pretty and unusual were hardly the words for it, Lee thought, as he gazed in admiration. Below, Cephalon spread like a visionary's dream of a far-away future blended with a far-away past. Along wide, palm shaded avenues the flat-roofed terraced houses fanned out into the desert. Style elements of ancient Peru and Mexico were blended together with the latest advances of technology, such as the rectangular sheets of water which covered and cooled the roofs. The business center, dotted with helicopter landing fields on top of the pyramidal buildings, was reminiscent of the classic Babylon and Nineveh. At the center of the man-made oasis a huge fortress-like structure sprawled and towered like a seven-pointed star. Even so, for all its impressiveness of masonry, the lush green of its parks, the bursts of color from its hanging gardens, made Cephalon resemble one enormous flower bed.  Overawed and mystified the lone passenger from Down-Under took in the scene while the big plane circled with diminished speed. \"It's beautiful,\" he murmered. \"It's a dream.\" And louder then: \"Pardon me if I find it hard to trust my senses. I've been away from home for more than ten years, to be sure. But then, even in the Australian bush I've received some periodicals and scientific journals from the U.S.A. Surely if a city like this has been built during my absence there should have been mention of the fact. And surely a city like this must show on some map. I don't understand. The longer I look the less I understand....\"  The flight engineer shrugged. \"It's a new city, maybe that's why it doesn't show.\"  Lee nodded. \"In that case you must know the meaning of all this. Why did they build this city in the middle of the desert? What purpose does it serve? Why am I here? Why are we circling for so long? There don't seem to be any other planes up in the air.\"  \"We cannot come in until our cargo has been examined and okayed,\" the engineer said.  Lee raised a pair of heavy and untidy brows: \"Cargo examination? In mid-air and with nobody from the ground examining it?\"  \"That's it. It's being done by Radar, one of the new fangled kinds, you know.\" He grinned: \"I hope, doctor, that your termite species is neither explosive nor fissionable in any way. Because in that case we could never make a landing in Cephalon.\"  \"How utterly absurd,\" Lee said disgustedly. \"Even a child would know better. There is no war going on--or is there? What makes them take such absurd precautions?\"  The engineer narrowed his eyes. \"You're an American, Dr. Lee, aren't you? Well, in any case, I can see no reason why I should be beating about the bush. After all, every foreign agent in this country must have learned by now about the existence of Cephalon. It's too big to be secret anyway. Besides, as you perceive, no attempt has been made to camouflage the place. Cephalon and the whole district takes up about a thousand square miles. It's a military preserve. Only you don't see any Brass. What they are doing, I wouldn't know, but I would rather try to rob all the gold from Fort Knox than get away with a single scrap of paper from that Braintrust Building in the center of the city over there. By the way, that skull shaped building right across the Plaza is the official hotel reserved for very important persons, such as you are listed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A deep-throated buzz over the intercom interrupted him. \"There, thank God, they finally made up their minds to let us in. One minute more and then a shower, a shave, bacon and eggs, and lots of Java!\"  There were what appeared to Lee to be a multitude of people waiting as they landed. Eager and intelligent white faces all lifted up to him and pressed forward with bewildering offerings and requests. A Western Union messenger handed him a telegram in which one Dr. Howard K. Scriven proffered greetings, expressing a desire to interview him. Some cleancut youngster, obviously a scientific worker, assured Lee that he was fully familiar with the care and feeding of \"_Ant-termes-pacificus-Lee_\", that Lee need not concern himself about their welfare, that the mounds would be immediately transferred to Experimental Station 19 G. The \"Flying Wing's\" supercargo and two truck-drivers came forward with papers for Lee to sign, as the first of the heavy steelboxes which harbored the mounds were lowered into a van with the whine of an electric hoist. Meanwhile somebody who said he was an assistant manager of the Cranium hotel informed Lee that reservations had been made for him and that he had a car waiting to conduct Dr. Lee to his suite. It was all very mysterious, but efficient. Feeling more and more like some prize exhibit handled without a will of its own on a whirlwind tour, Lee allowed himself to be whisked from the airport to the hotel. With the din of the jets still in his ears, overpowered by impressions which crowded his senses from all sides, he listened politely to the hotel manager's explanations of the sights without understanding a word of them.  There were flowers in his suite, the carpets were deeper, the bathtub was bigger, the towels piled higher, the breakfast more abundantly rich than anything Lee could remember in the 38 years of his life. \"So this is America in 1960,\" he thought. \"It must have advanced by leaps and by bounds over these past ten years.\"  He felt embarrassed because he had almost forgotten the uses of all those comforts, and at the same time deeply moved over the way they embraced him, him, the lost son, the voluntary exile who once had turned his back on them in despair and disgust. But why was all this? He had done nothing to deserve this kind of hospitality. Entomologists as a rule were not transported by magic carpets into Arabian Nights for modest achievements such as the discovery of a new species. All the things "]]]
