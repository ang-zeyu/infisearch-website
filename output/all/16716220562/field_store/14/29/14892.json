The great augmentation of the servile class in the Southern States, compared with the West India colonies, has been thought to indicate a much milder form of slavery; but there are other causes, which tend to produce the result. There are much fewer white men in the British West Indies than in our slave States; hence the increase of the _mulatto_ population is less rapid. Here the descendants of a colored mother _never_ become free; in the West Indies, they cease to be slaves in the _fourth generation_, at farthest; and their posterity increase the _free_ colored class, instead of adding countless links to the chain of bondage.  The manufacture of sugar is extremely toilsome, and when driven hard, occasions a great waste of negro life; this circumstance, together with the tropical climate of the West Indies, furnish additional reasons for the disproportionate increase of slaves between those islands and our own country, where a comparatively small quantity of sugar is cultivated.  It may excite surprise, that _Indians_ and their offspring are comprised in the doom of perpetual slavery; yet not only is _incidental_ mention of them as slaves to be met with in the laws of most of the States of our confederacy, but in one, at least, _direct legislation_ may be cited to sanction their enslavement. In Virginia, an act was passed, in 1679, declaring that \"for _the better encouragement of soldiers_, whatever Indian prisoners were taken in a war, in which the colony was then engaged, should be _free purchase_ to the soldiers taking them;\" and in 1682, it was decreed that \"all servants brought into Virginia, by sea or land, not being _Christians_, whether negroes, Moors, mulattoes, or Indians, (except Turks and Moors in amity with Great Britain) and all Indians, which should thereafter be _sold by neighboring Indians_, or any other trafficking with us, as slaves, _should be slaves to all intents and purposes_.\" These laws ceased in 1691; but the descendants of all Indians sold in the intermediate time are now among slaves.  In order to show the true aspect of slavery among us, I will state distinct propositions, each supported by the evidence of actually existing laws.  1. _Slavery is hereditary and perpetual, to the last moment of the slave's earthly existence, and to all his descendants, to the latest posterity._  2. _The labor of the slave is compulsory and uncompensated; while the kind of labor, the amount of toil, and the time allowed for rest, are dictated solely by the master. No bargain is made, no wages given. A pure despotism governs the human brute; and even his covering and provender, both as to quantity and quality, depend entirely on the master's discretion._  3. _The slave being considered a personal chattel, may be sold, or pledged, or leased, at the will of his master. He may be exchanged for marketable commodities, or taken in execution for the debts, or taxes, either of a living, or a deceased master. Sold at auction, \"either individually, or in lots to suit the purchaser,\" he may remain with his family, or be separated from them for ever._  4. _Slaves can make no contracts, and have no legal right to any property, real or personal. Their own honest earnings, and the legacies of friends belong, in point of law, to their masters._  5. _Neither a slave, nor free colored person, can be a witness against any white or free man, in a court of justice, however atrocious may have been the crimes they have seen him commit: but they may give testimony against a fellow-slave, or free colored man, even in cases affecting life._  6. _The slave may be punished at his master's discretion--without trial--without any means of legal redress,--whether his offence be real, or imaginary: and the master can transfer the same despotic power to any person, or persons, he may choose to appoint._  7. _The slave is not allowed to resist any free man under any circumstances: his only safety consists in the fact that his owner may bring suit, and recover, the price of his body, in case his life is taken, or his limbs rendered unfit for labor._  8. _Slaves cannot redeem themselves, or obtain a change of masters, though cruel treatment may have rendered such a change necessary for their personal safety._  9. _The slave is entirely unprotected in his domestic relations._  10. _The laws greatly obstruct the manumission of slaves, even where the master is willing to enfranchise them._  11. _The operation of the laws tends to deprive slaves of religious instruction and consolation._  12. _The whole power of the laws is exerted to keep slaves in a state of the lowest ignorance._  13. _There is in this country a monstrous inequality of law and right. What is a trifling fault in the white man, is considered highly criminal in the slave; the same offences which cost a white man a few dollars only, are punished in the negro with death._  14. _The laws operate most oppressively upon free people of color._   PROPOSITION 1.--_Slavery hereditary and perpetual._  In Maryland the following act was passed in 1715, and is still in force: \"All negroes and other slaves, already imported, or hereafter to be imported into this province, and all children now born, or hereafter to be born, of such negroes and slaves, shall be slaves during their natural lives.\" The law of South Carolina is, \"All negroes, _Indians_, (free Indians in amity with this government, and negroes, mulattoes, and mestizoes, who are _now_ free, excepted,) mulattoes or mestizoes, who now are, or shall hereafter be in this province, and all their issue born, or to be born, shall be and remain for ever hereafter absolute slaves, and shall follow the condition of _the mother_.\" Laws similar exist in Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In consequence of these laws, people so nearly white as not to be distinguished from Europeans, may be, and have been, legally claimed as slaves.   PROP. 2.--_Labor compulsory and uncompensated, &c._  In most of the slave States the law is silent on this subject; but that it is the established custom is proved by laws restraining the excessive abuse of this power, in some of the States. Thus in one State there is a fine of ten shillings, in another of two dollars, for making slaves labor on Sunday, unless it be in works of absolute necessity, or the necessary occasions of the family. There is likewise a law which provides that \"any master, who withholds proper sustenance, or clothing, from his slaves, or overworks them, so as to injure their health, shall upon _sufficient information_ [here lies the rub] being laid before the grand jury, be by said jury presented; whereupon it shall be the duty of the attorney, or solicitor-general, to prosecute said owners, who, on conviction, shall be sentenced to pay a fine, or be imprisoned, or both, at the discretion of the court.\"  The negro act of South Carolina contains the following language: \"Whereas many owners of slaves, and _others_, who have the care, management, and overseeing of slaves, _do confine them so closely to hard labor, that they have not sufficient time for natural rest_; be it therefore enacted, that if any owner of slaves, or others having the care, &c., shall put such slaves to labor more than _fifteen_ hours in twenty-four, from the twenty-fifth of March to the twenty-fifth of September; or more than _fourteen_ hours in twenty-four hours, from the twenty-fifth of September to the twenty-fifth of March, any such person shall forfeit a sum of money not exceeding twenty pounds, nor under five pounds, current money, for every time he, she, or they, shall offend therein, at the discretion of the justice before whom complaint shall be made.\"  In Louisiana it is enacted, that \"the slaves shall be allowed half an hour for breakfast, during the whole year; from the first of May to the first of November, they shall be allowed two hours for dinner; and from the first of November to the first of May, one hour and a half for dinner: provided, however, that the owners, who will themselves take the trouble of having the meals of their slaves prepared, be, and they are hereby authorized to abridge, by half an hour a day, the time fixed for their rest.\"  All these laws, _apparently_ for the protection of the slave, are rendered perfectly null and void, by the fact, that the testimony of a negro or mulatto is _never_ taken against a white man. If a slave be found toiling in the field on the Sabbath, who can _prove_ that his master commanded him to do it?  The law of Louisiana stipulates that a slave shall have _one_ linen shirt,[K] and a pair of pantaloons for the summer, and _one_ linen shirt and a woollen great-coat and pantaloons for the winter; and for food, one pint of salt, and a barrel of Indian corn, rice, or beans, every month. In North Carolina, the law decides that a quart of corn per day is sufficient. But, if the slave does not receive this poor allowance, who can _prove_ the fact. The withholding of proper sustenance is absolutely incapable of proof, unless the evidence of the sufferer himself be allowed; and the law, as if determined to obstruct the administration of justice, permits the master to exculpate himself by an oath that the charges against him are false. Clothing may, indeed, be ascertained by _inspection_; but who is likely to involve himself in quarrels with a white master because a poor negro receives a few rags less than the law provides? I apprehend that a person notorious for such gratuitous acts of kindness, would have little peace or safety, in any slaveholding country.  [Footnote K: This shirt is usually made of a coarse kind of bagging.]  If a negro be compelled to toil night and day, (as it is said they sometimes are,[L] at the season of sugar-making) who is to _prove_ that he works more than his fourteen or fifteen hours? No slave can be a witness for himself, or for his fellow-slaves; and should a white man happen to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28247"],["title","A Popular History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

A new era has dawned, not by chronological prescription alone, but to the vital sense of humanity. Novel thoughts are rife; fresh impulses stir the nations; the soughing of the wind of progress strikes every ear. \"The old order changeth\" more and more swiftly as mental activity becomes intensified. Already many of the scientific doctrines implicitly accepted fifteen years ago begin to wear a superannuated aspect. Dalton's atoms are in process of disintegration; Kirchhoff's theorem visibly needs to be modified; Clerk Maxwell's medium no longer figures as an indispensable factotum; \"absolute zero\" is known to be situated on an asymptote to the curve of cold. Ideas, in short, have all at once become plastic, and none more completely so than those relating to astronomy. The physics of the heavenly bodies, indeed, finds its best opportunities in unlooked-for disclosures; for it deals with transcendental conditions, and what is strange to terrestrial experience may serve admirably to expound what is normal in the skies. In celestial science especially, facts that appear subversive are often the most illuminative, and the prospect of its advance widens and brightens with each divagation enforced or permitted from the strait paths of rigid theory.  This readiness for innovation has undoubtedly its dangers and drawbacks. To the historian, above all, it presents frequent occasions of embarrassment. The writing of history is a strongly selective operation, the outcome being valuable just in so far as the choice what to reject and what to include has been judicious; and the task is no light one of discriminating between barren speculations and ideas pregnant with coming truth. To the possession of such prescience of the future as would be needed to do this effectually I can lay no claim; but diligence and sobriety of thought are ordinarily within reach, and these I shall have exercised to good purpose if I have succeeded in rendering the fourth edition of _A Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century_ not wholly unworthy of a place in the scientific literature of the twentieth century.  My thanks are due to Sir David Gill for the use of his photograph of the great comet of 1901, which I have added to my list of illustrations, and to the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society for the loan of glass positives needed for the reproduction of those included in the third edition.  London, _July_, 1902.    PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION  The progress of astronomy during the last hundred years has been rapid and extraordinary. In its distinctive features, moreover, the nature of that progress has been such as to lend itself with facility to untechnical treatment. To this circumstance the present volume owes its origin. It embodies an attempt to enable the ordinary reader to follow, with intelligent interest, the course of modern astronomical inquiries, and to realize (so far as it can at present be realized) the full effect of the comprehensive change in the whole aspect, purposes, and methods of celestial science introduced by the momentous discovery of spectrum analysis.  Since Professor Grant's invaluable work on the _History of Physical Astronomy_ was published, a third of a century has elapsed. During the interval a so-called \"new astronomy\" has grown up by the side of the old. One effect of its advent has been to render the science of the heavenly bodies more popular, both in its needs and in its nature, than formerly. More popular in its needs, since its progress now primarily depends upon the interest in, and consequent efforts towards its advancement of the general public; more popular in its nature, because the kind of knowledge it now chiefly tends to accumulate is more easily intelligible--less remote from ordinary experience--than that evolved by the aid of the calculus from materials collected by the use of the transit-instrument and chronograph.  It has thus become practicable to describe in simple language the most essential parts of recent astronomical discoveries, and, being practicable, it could not be otherwise than desirable to do so. The service to astronomy itself would be not inconsiderable of enlisting wider sympathies on its behalf, while to help one single mind towards a fuller understanding of the manifold works which have in all ages irresistibly spoken to man of the glory of God might well be an object of no ignoble ambition.  The present volume does not profess to be a complete or exhaustive history of astronomy during the period covered by it. Its design is to present a view of the progress of celestial science, on its most characteristic side, since the time of Herschel. Abstruse mathematical theories, unless in some of their more striking results, are excluded from consideration. These, during the eighteenth century, constituted the sum and substance of astronomy, and their fundamental importance can never be diminished, and should never be ignored. But as the outcome of the enormous development given to the powers of the telescope in recent times, together with the swift advance of physical science, and the inclusion, by means of the spectroscope, of the heavenly bodies within the domain of its inquiries, much knowledge has been acquired regarding the nature and condition of those bodies, forming, it might be said, a science apart, and disembarrassed from immediate dependence upon intricate, and, except to the initiated, unintelligible formulæ. This kind of knowledge forms the main subject of the book now offered to the public.  There are many reasons for preferring a history to a formal treatise on astronomy. In a treatise, _what_ we know is set forth. A history tells us, in addition, _how_ we came to know it. It thus places facts before us in the natural order of their ascertainment, and narrates instead of enumerating. The story to be told leaves the marvels of imagination far behind, and requires no embellishment from literary art or high-flown phrases. Its best ornament is unvarnished truthfulness, and this, at least, may confidently be claimed to be bestowed upon it in the ensuing pages.  In them unity of treatment is sought to be combined with a due regard to chronological sequence by grouping in separate chapters the various events relating to the several departments of descriptive astronomy. The whole is divided into two parts, the line between which is roughly drawn at the middle of the present century. Herschel's inquiries into the construction of the heavens strike the keynote of the first part; the discoveries of sun-spot and magnetic periodicity and of spectrum analysis determine the character of the second. Where the nature of the subject required it, however, this arrangement has been disregarded. Clearness and consistency should obviously take precedence of method. Thus, in treating of the telescopic scrutiny of the various planets, the whole of the related facts have been collected into an uninterrupted narrative. A division elsewhere natural and helpful would here have been purely artificial, and therefore confusing.  The interests of students have been consulted by a full and authentic system of references to the sources of information relied upon. Materials have been derived, as a rule with very few exceptions, from the original authorities. The system adopted has been to take as little as possible at second-hand. Much pains have been taken to trace the origin of ideas, often obscurely enunciated long before they came to resound through the scientific world, and to give to each individual discoverer, strictly and impartially, his due. Prominence has also been assigned to the biographical element, as underlying and determining the whole course of human endeavour. The advance of knowledge may be called a vital process. The lives of men are absorbed into and assimilated by it. Inquiries into the kind and mode of the surrender in each separate case must always possess a strong interest, whether for study or for example.  The acknowledgments of the writer are due to Professor Edward S. Holden, director of the Washburn Observatory, Wisconsin, and to Dr. Copeland, chief astronomer of Lord Crawford's Observatory at Dunecht, for many valuable communications.
