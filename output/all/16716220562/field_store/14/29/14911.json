With an unconscious sigh she looked across to the Bilton house. Plenty of people over there to make merry. Five stockings to hang up. She wished she might have sent something in. To be sure, there was the dog, but that was some time ago. Very likely the dog would have been dead now, anyhow. She felt, herself, that this logic was not irrefutable, but she wished she could have sent some paper parcels just the same. So strong had this impulse been that she had said to her husband somewhat timidly that morning,--  \"There are a good many of those Bilton children to get presents for.\"  \"More fools they that get 'em presents, then,\" he had pleasantly replied.  \"I don't suppose he has much to buy them with,\" she continued.  \"He had enough to buy poison for my dog,\" exclaimed her husband, giving his newspaper an angry shake.  \"I'd almost like to send them in some cheap little toys.\"  \"Well, as long as you don't quite like to, it won't do any harm,\" he said with some violence, laying down his newspaper, and looking at her in a manner not to be misunderstood. \"But you see that the liking doesn't get any farther.\"  \"It's Christmas, you know,\" said his plucky wife.  \"Oh, no, I don't know it!\" he replied gruffly. \"I haven't fallen over forty children a minute in the street with their ridiculous parcels, and I haven't had women drop brown-paper bundles that come undone all over me when they crowd into the horse car, and I haven't found it impossible to get to the shirt-collar counter on account of Christmas novelties! Oh, no, I didn't know it was Christmas!\"  After that there was really not much to be said, for we all know Christmas is dreadfully annoying, and the last thing a man in this sort of temper wants to hear about is peace and good will.  Notwithstanding the fact that Mrs. Gilton looked over to her neighbors' with an envious feeling this dark afternoon, their Christmas cheer was not so abounding as it had been in more prosperous times. There was not very much money to be spent this year, and they were obliged to give up something. Mr. and Mrs. Bilton had decided that it should be the Christmas dinner; they would have a simple luncheon, and let all the money that could be spared go for the stockings. Each child had its own sum to invest for others, and there was still a small amount for the older members of the family. That it was a small amount Mrs. Bilton felt strongly, as she went from shop to shop. But when she reached home again she was somewhat encouraged; there was such an air of joyous expectation in the house, and her purchases looked larger now that they were away from the glittering counters. Then each of the five children came to her separately and confided to her the nothing less than wonderful results of judicious bargaining which had enabled them to buy useful and beautiful presents for each of the others out of the sums intrusted to their care, ranging in amount from the two dollars of John to the fifty cents of Cora Cordelia. She felt sure that there were further secrets yet; secrets attended by brown paper and string, which she had taken the greatest care for the last two weeks not heedlessly to expose,--riddles of which the solution lay perilously near her eyes, which would be revealed to her astonished gaze the next morning.  She had reason to believe that even Cora Cordelia was making something for her, and though it was difficult for her to ignore the fact that it was a knit washcloth, she had hitherto avoided absolute certainty on the subject. So that altogether it was a pretty cheerful afternoon at the Biltons'.  Meanwhile, down in the main street of the city it was a confusing scene. It was darker there than where the streets were more open; and although there were several daring spirits of that adventurous turn of mind which leads people into byways of discovery, who asserted that the street lamps were lighted, it was not generally believed. The snow was blowing down and up and across, and getting more and more unmanageable under the feet of foot passengers every moment. It was cold and windy and blinding and crowded, and a good many other disconcerting things, all of which Mr. Gilton felt the full force of as he stood on the corner where he had just bought his turkey. It was a fine turkey, and had been a good bargain, and though he had to carry it home himself, there was nothing derogatory in that. If it had been anybody else he would have been thrilled with a glow of satisfaction, but Mr. Gilton was long past glows of satisfaction--it was years since he had permitted himself to have such things.  \"Jour--our--nal! fi-i-i-ve cents!\" screamed an intermittent newsboy in his ear.  \"Get out!\" replied Mr. Gilton, the uncompromising nature of his language being intensified by the fact that he jumped nearly two feet from the suddenness of the newsboy's attack. Even the newsboy, inured to the short words of an unfriendly world, and usually quite indifferent thereto, was impressed by the asperity of the suggestion and moved somewhat hastily on. Possibly his cold, wet little existence had been rendered morbidly susceptible by the general good feeling of the hour, one lady having even spontaneously given him five cents.  After this exchange of amenities Mr. Gilton stepped into his horse car. It was crowded, of course, as horse cars that are small and run once in half an hour are apt to be, and he had to stand up, and the turkey legs stuck out of the brown paper in a very conspicuous way. If Mr. Gilton had been anybody else he would have been chaffed about his turkey, because to make up for the conveniences that the horse car line did not furnish the public, the large-hearted public furnished the horse car line with an unusual amount of friendliness. There was almost always something going on in these horse cars. Their social privileges were quite a feature. To-night they were in unusual force on account of the season. But nobody said anything to Mr. Gilton. Only when he jerked the bell and stepped off, one stout man with his overcoat collar turned up to his ears said, without turning his head:--  \"I supposed of course he was going to give the turkey to the conductor.\"  Everybody laughed in that end of the car except one small old lady in the corner, who was a stranger and visiting, and who was left with the impression that the gentleman who got off must be a very kind man. It was darker and blowier and snowier than when he had left the corner, and Mr. Gilton floundered through the unbroken drifts up the little path to the door with increasing grudges in his heart against the difficulties of Christmas. The lock was off, and he went in slamming the door after him. There was no light in the hall, and he murmured loudly against the inconvenience.  \"Confound it!\" he said, \"why didn't they light the gas? I'm not one of those confounded Biltons; I can afford to pay for what I don't get;\" and, without pausing to take off his hat and coat, he strode to the sitting-room door and flung it open. That was an awful moment. The sudden change from the cold and darkness almost blinded him, and confirmed the impression that he was the victim of an illusion. The sound of many voices, and then the hush of sudden consternation, was in his ears. There was a lamp and there was a fire, and there between them sat Mr. Bilton on one side and Mrs. Bilton on the other, and round about, in various unconventional attitudes, sat four Bilton children. And there in the very midst of them, in his heavy overcoat, with snow melting on his hat, his beard, and his shoulders, stood Mr. Gilton. The unexpected scene, the amazed faces gazing into his, rendered him speechless; he wondered vaguely if he were losing his reason. Then, in a flush of enlightenment, he realized what had happened; thanks to the storm outside, he had come into the wrong house. Naturally his first impulse was towards flight, but as his bewildered gaze slipped about the room it fell upon five stockings hung against the mantelpiece, and stayed there fascinated. Five foolish, limp, expressionless stockings,--it was long since he had seen such an unreasonable spectacle. Then he recollected himself and looked around him. Perhaps even then, if he had made a dash for the door, he might have escaped and matters have been none the worse. But in that instant of hesitation caused by the sudden sight of those five stockings something dreadful occurred. It must be premised that Cora Cordelia did not know Mr. Gilton very well by sight, being in the first place small and not noticing, and in the second, filled with an unreasoning fear that caused her to flee whenever she had seen him approach. This is the only excuse for what she did; for while her mother was feebly murmuring, as if in extenuation, \"We thought it was John coming in,\" Cora Cordelia clasped her hands in delirious delight, and cried aloud, \"It's Santa Claus! Oh, it's Santa Claus!\" Could anything more awful happen to a cross man, a very cross man, than to be taken for Santa Claus!  Mr. Gilton looked at Cora Cordelia, and wondered why she had not been slaughtered in her cradle.  \"And,\" exclaimed Susan Bilton, with sudden communicative fervor, \"he has come and brought us a turkey for to-morrow's dinner!\"  The truth was that Susan had been coming to the age that is sceptical about Santa Claus, but she could not resist this sudden appearance.  No one could appreciate the nonsense of the whole situation better than Mr. Gilton; and yet, strangely enough, together with his annoyance was mingled a touch of the strange feeling that had dawned upon him first when he saw the stockings. To be sure, it only added to his annoyance, but it was there. By this time--it was really a very short time--Mrs. Bilton had recovered herself and risen, and Mr. Bilton had risen too.  \"Hush, children; it is not Santa Claus,\" she said, \"it is Mr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28307"],["title","A Christmas Accident and Other Stories (#2)"],["body",". We are glad to see you, Mr. Gilton;\" and she held out her hand to him. \"Won't you sit down?\" She felt that he had come in the Christmas spirit, and she was anxious to meet him half-way.  \"Yes,\" said her husband, coming forward, and instantly taking his cue from his wife,--for he was really a very nice man,--\"we are very glad.\" To be sure, in his manner there was a certain stiffness, for a man cannot always change completely in a moment, as a woman can; but Mr. Gilton was too perplexed to notice this. In the incomprehensible way that one's mind has of clinging to unimportant things at great crises, while he was fuming with rage and bothered with this strange feeling which was not precisely rage, he was wondering how in the world he was going to sit down with that ridiculous turkey, with its ridiculous legs, in his arms, and not look more absurd than he did now. In this moment of absentmindedness he had mechanically taken Mrs. Bilton's hand and shaken it, and after that of course there was nothing to do except to shake Mr. Bilton's. Then he began to know it was all up. He had not spoken yet, but now he made a frantic effort to save what might be left besides honor. \"I came--\" he began, \"I came--came to your house--\" There he paused a moment, and that unlucky child with that tendency to be possessed by one idea, which is characteristic of small and trivial minds, and for which she should have been shaken, burst in with, \"And did the reindeer bring you, and are they outside?\"  He almost groaned, so overwhelmed was he by this new idiocy. Reindeer! If those overworked, struggling car-horses could have heard that! Then Mrs. Bilton, pitying his evident confusion, came to his assistance.  \"Don't mind the children, Mr. Gilton,\" she said, her cheeks flushing, and looking very pretty with the excitement of the unusual circumstances, \"we are glad you came, however you made your way here. I think we may thank Christmas Eve for it. Now do take off your overcoat and sit down.\"  Oh, mispraised woman's tact! What complications you may produce! That finished it, of course. He sat down. In those few moments that strange feeling had grown marvellously stronger. It seemed to be made up of the most diverse elements,--a mixture of green wreaths and his own childhood, and his mother, and a top he had not thought of for years, and the wide fireplace at home, and a stable with a child in it, and a picture, in a book he used to read, of a lot of angels in the sky, one particular one in the middle, and underneath it some words--what were the words? He'd forgotten they had anything to do with Christmas, anyway.  \"But you _did_ bring us the turkey, didn't you?\" said Cora Cordelia, helping her mother on.  To do the child justice,--for even Cora Cordelia has a right to demand justice,--her manners were corrupted by Christmas expectancy.  \"Cora Cordelia, I'm ashamed of you,\" said Mrs. Bilton.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Gilton, the words wrung from his lips, while beads stood on his forehead,--\"yes, I brought you the turkey.\"  \"Did you really?\" exclaimed Mrs. Bilton, who thought he had all the time. \"That was very kind of you.\"  \"Will you please take it--take it away?\" he said, with that wish to have something over which we associate with the dentist. So Mrs. Bilton took the turkey and thanked him, and gave it to Fanny, who carried it out to the kitchen, and Mr. Gilton gave one last look at its legs as it went through the door, feeling that now he must wake up from this nightmare. But things only went farther and became more incredible and upsetting, only that, strangely enough, that feeling of horror began to wear off, and that singular strain of association with all sorts of Christmas things to grow stronger. He himself could hardly believe that it was no worse, when he found himself seated by the littered table, with Mrs. Bilton near and Mr. Bilton over by the fire again, listening to first one and then the other, and occasionally letting fall a word himself, his conversational powers seeming to thaw out along with the snow on his greatcoat. These words themselves were a surprise to him. He was quite sure that he started them with a creditable gruffness, but the Christmas air mellowed them in a highly unsatisfactory fashion, so that they fell on his own ears quite otherwise than as he had meant they should sound. Moreover the general tenor of the conversation was exceedingly perplexing. It was all about how fine it was of him to come this evening, and how they had often regretted the hard feeling, and how things always did get exaggerated. Of course he would not have believed a word of it, if he had been able to get any grip on the situation, but he wasn't, and he just went on assenting to it all as if it were true. There came a time when Mr. Bilton cleared his throat, hesitated a moment, and then said boldly,--  \"I think I ought to tell you, Mr. Gilton, that I had nothing whatever to do with the death of your dog.\" Mr. Gilton felt the ground slipping away from under his very feet. That dog had been his piece of resistance, as it were. \"I wouldn't have poisoned him,\" went on Mr. Bilton, \"for a hundred dollars. But,\" he added, with a queer little smile, \"I wasn't going to tell you so, you know.\"  \"Of course you wasn't,\" exclaimed Mr. Gilton, hurriedly, with a touch of that unholy excitement that a lapse from grammar imparts.  \"We wouldn't any of us,\" asserted Walter.  \"No,\" said Susan, Fanny, and Cora Cordelia.  Then it came out that the whole family had rather admired the dog than otherwise. It was here that John did really come in, his entrance sounding very much as had Mr. Gilton's. He nearly fell over when he saw the visitor, but he had time to pull himself together, for Cora Cordelia had snatched that moment for showing Mr. Gilton her gifts for the family, and he was bound hand and foot with helplessness. Then they all came and showed him their gifts. While he examined them Mr. and Mrs. Bilton carefully averted their eyes and gazed hard at the opposite wall, while Cora Cordelia urged him, in stage whispers, not to let them suspect. It was pitiable the state to which he was reduced. Of course resisting this Christmas enthusiasm was out of the question. To be sure it came over him once with startling force, as she showed him a toy water-wheel, that went by sand,--which she had purchased for her father at a phenomenally low rate because the wheel could not be made to go,--that Cora Cordelia was the very child that he had fallen over as she came hastening out of a toy-shop with a queerly shaped bundle, the day before, and so been further imbittered towards Christmas. Susan had purchased a cup and ball for her mother, and as she went out of the room for a moment, insisted upon Mr. Gilton's trying to do it and see what fun it was. If Mr. Gilton lives to be a hundred he will never forget the mingled feelings with which he awkwardly tried to get that senseless ball into that idiotic cup. At last he stood up to go--it was after six o'clock--and they went with him to the door, and wished him Merry Christmas, and sent Merry Christmas to Mrs. Gilton, and said good-night several times, and he stumbled on through the snow, this time towards his own door. It had stopped snowing as suddenly and quietly as it had begun, and the stars had come out. He gazed up at them,--something he very rarely did. They seemed a part of Christmas. Just before he turned in at his own gate, he looked back at the Bilton house and shook his fist at it, but the expression on his face was such that the very same newsboy who had accosted him earlier failed utterly to recognize him and was emboldened to offer him a paper. He too was pushing his way home with two papers left, in a somewhat dispirited way.  \"I'll take 'em both,\" said this singular customer. \"Here's a quarter--never mind the change. It's Christmas Eve, I believe--\" and this when he knew perfectly well that a copy of that very same journal was waiting for him on his table. The boy looked at his quarter and looked again at his customer, and recognized him, and made up his mind to buy a couple of hot sausages on the corner, and went on his way feeling that there was a new heaven and a new earth. Mrs. Gilton was standing at the parlor window, peering out anxiously as he came up the path. She was in the hall as he entered.  \"Why, Reuben,\" she said, \"I was afraid something had happened.\"  Goodness gracious! As if something hadn't happened! He turned away to hang up his overcoat and tried to speak crossly.  \"Well,\" he said, \"I've lost my turkey. That's happened.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Mrs. Gilton, quickly; \"the other one came later, the first one, you know--so--so the Biltons didn't get it this time.\"  \"They got the second one, though,\" said Reuben, hanging up his hat.  \"Oh, dear, did they!\" said Mrs. Gilton. Then she went on, \"Well, I don't care if they did, so there! I guess they need it for their Christmas dinner.\"  \"No, they don't,\" said Reuben, turning around and facing her, \"because they are going to eat part of ours. They are coming in to-morrow to have dinner with us,--every one of them!\" he asserted more loudly, on account of the expression on his wife's face. \"Bilton, and his wife, and all the five children, down to Cora Cordelia! So we'll have to have something for them to eat.\"  If Mr. Gilton will never forget the cup and ball, Mrs. Gilton will never forget that moment. She went all over it in her mind whether she could manage him herself to-night, or whether to send Bridget right away then for the doctor, and if she hadn't better say a policeman too, and whether he could be kept for the future in a private house, or would have to be confined in an asylum. She was inclining towards the asylum when he, who was going into the sitting-room before her, turned round and laughed an odd little laugh. She began to think then that a private house would do.  The next day they all dined together, which proved that it was not all "]]]
