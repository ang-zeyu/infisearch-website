What humbug it is to call this Africa!\" growled Dickenson.  \"What do you mean?\" replied Lennox.  \"Mean?  Why, it's so cold.  Where's your blazing heat and your sand? One might be at the North Pole.  Ow! don't do that.\"  He started violently, for Lennox had suddenly stolen out a hand and pinched his arm sharply.  \"Quiet!  Listen!\"  Dickenson drew his breath hard and strained his ears instead of his eyes.  \"Well?  Can't hear anything.\"  \"Hist!  Listen again.\"  There was a pause.  \"Hear anything?\"  \"Yes; but I don't know what it is,\" said Dickenson, laying a hand behind one ear and leaning forward with his head on one side.  \"What does it sound like?\"  \"Something like a heavy wagon coming along a road with its wheels muffled.\"  \"Heavy wagon drawn by oxen?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Dickenson.  \"Mightn't it be a big gun?\"  \"It might,\" said Dickenson dubiously; \"but what, could a big gun be doing out there on the open veldt?\"  \"Lying still in its carriage, and letting itself be drawn to the place where it was to be mounted.\"  \"Yes, of course it might be; but it couldn't.\"  \"Why not?  Bob, old fellow,\" whispered Lennox in an excited whisper, \"I believe the Boers are stealing a march upon us.\"  \"Well, they won't, because we're on the watch.  But out with it: what is it you think?\"  \"They don't know that we are occupying the kopje to-night.\"  \"No; we came after it was dark.\"  \"Exactly.  Well, they're bringing up a big gun to mount up here and give us a surprise in the morning.\"  \"Phe-ew!\" whistled Dickenson.  \"Oh, surely not!\"  \"I feel sure that they are.\"  \"Well, let's send word on to the old man.  Send one of the sergeants.\"  \"And by the time he got there with his news, and reinforcements could be sent, the enemy would have the gun here.\"  \"Let's tell Roby, then.\"  \"Yes; come on.\"  In another minute they had told their officer their suspicions, and he hummed and ha'd a little after listening.  \"It hardly seems likely,\" he said, \"and I don't want to raise a false alarm.  Besides, the outposts have given no notice; and hark!  I can hear nothing.\"  \"Now?\"  They listened in the darkness, and it was as their captain suggested: all perfectly still.  \"There,\" he said.  \"It would be horrible to rouse up the colonel on account of a cock-and-bull story.\"  \"But it would be worse for him to be warned too late.  There it is again; hark!\" whispered Lennox, stretching out a hand in the direction farthest from the village.  \"Can't hear anything,\" said the captain.  \"I can,\" growled Dickenson softly.  \"Yes, so can I now.  It's a wagon whose drivers have missed their way, I should say.  But we'll see.\"  \"Or feel,\" grunted the captain.  \"It's as black as ink.--Here, Lennox, take a sergeant's guard and go forward softly to see if you can make anything out.  I don't know, though; it may be as you say, and if it is--\"  \"We ought to bring in that gun,\" whispered Lennox.  \"Yes, at all hazards.  I don't know, though.  There, take five-and-twenty of the lads, and act as seems best.  If you can do it easily, force the drivers to come on, but don't run risks.  If the Boers are in strength fall back at once.  You understand?\"  \"Quite,\" said Lennox softly.  \"Let me go with him, Roby?\"  \"No; I can't spare you.\"  \"Yes, do; I can help him.\"  \"He can do what there is to do himself, and would rather be alone, for it is only a reconnaissance.\"  \"I should like him with me,\" said Lennox quietly, and he felt his arm nipped.  \"Very well; but don't waste time.  I can hear it quite plainly now. Mind, fall back at once if they are in force.  I'll be well on the alert to cover you and your party.\"  The requisite number of men were soon under the young officer's orders, and they followed him softly down the rock-encumbered slope of the natural fortress--no easy task in the darkness; but the men were getting used to the gloom, and it was not long before the party was challenged by an outpost and received the word.  They passed on, getting well round to the farther side of the kopje before they were challenged again.  \"Glad you've come, sir,\" said the sentry; \"I was just going to fire.\"  \"Why?\" asked Lennox softly.  \"I can hear something coming out yonder in the darkness.  You listen, sir.  It's like a heavy wagon.\"  The man spoke in a whisper; then for some moments all was perfectly still.  \"Can't hear it now, sir,\" whispered the sentry; \"but I felt sure I heard something.\"  \"Wait again,\" said Lennox softly; and there was a good five minutes' interval of waiting, but not a sound could be heard.  \"Let's go forward, Bob,\" whispered Lennox; and after telling the sentry to be well upon the alert, he led his men slowly and cautiously straight away out into the black darkness of the veldt, but without hearing another sound till they were, as far as could be judged, a good two hundred yards from the last outpost, when the men were halted and stood in the black darkness listening once more, before swinging: round to the right and getting back by a curve to somewhere near the starting-place.  The next moment the young men joined hands and stood listening to an unmistakable sound away to their right and nearer to the kopje.  The sound was distant enough to be very soft, but there it was, plainly enough--the calm, quiet crunching up of the food a span of oxen had eaten, indicative of the fact that they had been pulled up by their drivers and were utilising their waiting time by chewing the cud.  \"Forward!\" whispered Lennox, and his men crept after him without a sound, every one full of excitement, for the general idea was that they were about to surprise some convoy wagon that had gone astray.  A minute later the munching of the oxen sounded quite loudly, and the little party was brought to a halt by a deep, gruff voice saying in Boer Dutch:  \"What a while you've been!  How much higher can we get?\"  \"Fix bayonets!\" cried Lennox sharply, and a yell of dismay arose, followed by a dozen random shots, as the metallic clinking of the keen, dagger-like weapons was heard against the muzzles of the men's rifles.  The shots fired seemed to cut the black darkness, and the exploded powder spread its dank, heavy fumes in the direction of the men's faces, but as far as Lennox could make out in the excitement of leading his party on in a charge, no one was hurt; and the next minute his little line was brought up short, several of the men littering angry ejaculations, and as many more bursting into a roar of laughter.    CHAPTER FOUR.  WAYS AND MEANS.  \"Here, what in the name of wonder!\" cried Dickenson angrily.  \"Yah! Keep those horns quiet, you beast.\"  \"What is it?\" cried Lennox excitedly.  \"Roast-beef, sir--leastwise to-morrow, sir,\" cried one of the men. \"We've bay'neted a team of oxen.\"  \"Speak the truth, lad,\" cried another from Lennox's left.  \"We've been giving point in a gun-carriage.\"  \"Silence in the ranks!\" cried Lennox sternly as he felt about in the darkness, joined now by his comrade, and found that their charge had been checked by a big gun, its limber, and the span--six or eight and twenty oxen--several of the poor beasts having received thrusts from the men's bayonets.  It was a strange breastwork to act as a protection, but from behind its shelter a couple of volleys were sent in the direction of the flashes of light which indicated the whereabouts of the enemy, and this made them continue their flight, the surprise having been too great for their nerves; while the right interpretation was placed upon the adventure at once--to wit, that in ignorance of the fact that Colonel Lindley had done in the darkness exactly what might have been expected, and occupied the kopje, the Boers had brought up a heavy gun with the intention of mounting it before morning, and had failed.  \"What's to be the next?\" said Dickenson.  \"Next?\" cried Lennox.  \"You must cover us with three parts of the men while with the rest I try to get the gun right up to the kopje.\"  It was no easy task, for the driver and foreloper of the team had fled with the artillerymen and the rest of the Boers, while the pricked oxen were disposed to be unmanageable.  But British soldiers are accustomed to struggle with difficulties of all kinds in war, and by the time the Boers had recovered somewhat from their surprise, and, urged by their leaders, were advancing again to try and recover the lost piece, the team of oxen were once more working together, and the ponderous gun was being slowly dragged onward towards the rocky eminence.  It was terribly hard work in the darkness; for the way, after about a hundred yards or so over level veldt, began to ascend, and blocks of granite seemed to be constantly rising from the ground to impede the progress of the oxen.  In spite of all, though, the gun and its limber were dragged on and on, while in the distance a line of tiny jets of fire kept on spurting out, showing that the enemy had recovered from the panic and were coming on, firing as they came, the bullets whizzing over the heads of our men, but doing no harm.  \"Steady! steady! and as quietly as you can,\" said Lennox in warning tones, as he kept on directing and encouraging his men.  \"They are firing by guesswork.--Ah! that won't do any good,\" he muttered, for just as he was speaking Dickenson and his men, who had spread out widely, began to reply; \"it will only show our weakness.\"  He looked forward again in the direction the oxen were being driven; but the kopje was invisible, and now he altered his opinion about the firing of Dickenson's detachment, for he felt that it would let the captain know what was going on, and bring up support.  He was quite right, for in a very little time Captain Roby had felt his way to them, learnt the cause of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27897"],["title","The Kopje Garrison: A Story of the Boer War (#6)"],["body",", and carefully covered the retreat till the intricacies of the rocky ascent put a stop to further progress in the gloom, and a halt was called till morning.  The rest of the night passed in the midst of a terrible suspense, for though the Boer firing gradually died out, as if the leaders had at last awakened to the fact of its being a mere waste of ammunition, the British detachment, scattered here and there about the captured gun, lay in momentary expectation of the enemy creeping up and then making a rush.  \"But they will not,\" said Lennox quietly.  \"They'll wait till morning, and creep up from stone to stone and bush to bush, trying to pick us off.\"  \"You need not be so cock-sure about it,\" growled Dickenson.  \"They are in force, and must have known from our fire how few we were.  A rush would do it.\"  \"Yes; but they will not rush,\" replied Lennox.  \"They understand too well the meaning of the word _bayonet_.  Cock-sure or no, they'll make no dash; but as soon as it begins to be light we shall have a hailstorm.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said Dickenson tetchily; \"there's no sign of rain.\"  \"I did not say rain,\" replied Lennox, \"but hail--leaden hail from every bit of cover round.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" said Dickenson.  \"Well, two sides can play at that game; and I fancy we have most cover here.\"  Lennox was quite right; for as soon as the first pale grey of a lovely dawn began to make objects stand up in an indistinct way upon the level veldt around the kopje, the sharp cracks of rifle after rifle began at every object that displayed movement upon the eminence, and the pattering of bullets among the rocks often preceded the reports of the Boer rifles.  But by this time Captain Roby had communicated with the colonel in the village, and had taken his steps, sending his men well out in the enemy's direction to take advantage of every scrap of cover to reply wherever it was necessary, which they did, their efforts, as the time went on, to some extent keeping the Boer fire down.  The colonel grasped the position at once and sent assistance, with the result that, in spite of terrible difficulties, by help of horse and mule to supplement the pulling powers of the ox-team, the big gun, limber, and an ammunition-wagon, which daylight showed lying deserted a quarter of a mile away among some bushes into which it had been dragged in the dark, were hauled to the flat top of the kopje, where they were surrounded with a rough but strong breastwork of the abundant stones, and by the men's breakfast-time a shell was sent well into the midst of a clump of bush which the Boers had made the centre of their advance.  A better shot could not have been made, for as soon as the shell had burst, the defenders of the kopje had the satisfaction of seeing that the greater part of the Boers' ponies had been gathered into shelter there, and a perfect stampede had begun, hundreds of horses, mounted and empty of saddle, streaming away in every direction except that in which the kopje lay.  There was no need for a second shell, for the sputtering rifle-fire ceased as if by magic, the Boers retiring, leaving the colonel's force at liberty to go on at leisure strengthening the emplacement of the enemy's heavy Creusot gun, and forming a magazine for the abundant supply of ammunition, also captured for its use.  The rest of the day was occupied, by as many of the men as could be spared, building up sangars [loose stone walls for breastworks] and contriving rifle-pits and cover to such an extent that already it would have taken a strong and determined force to make any impression; while, when the officers met at the mess that night and the matter was under discussion, the colonel smiled.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"pretty well for one day's work; but by the end of a week we shall have a little Gibraltar that will take all the men the Boers have in the field to capture--a regular stronghold, ready like a castle keep if we have to leave the village.\"  \"And may that never be, colonel,\" said Captain Roby.  \"Hear, hear!\" cried every one present.  \"So I say,\" said the colonel; \"but we may at any time be ordered to occupy some other position.  By the way, though, I should not dislike to send the Boer leader a letter of thanks for sending us that gun and a supply of oxen.  How many must be killed?\"  \"Killed?\" cried Captain Roby.  \"Yes; several were bayoneted in that charge.\"  \"Three only,\" replied the captain, \"and they don't look much the worse for it.  Their flesh seems to close up again like india-rubber.  The vet says they will all heal up.\"  \"Good,\" said the colonel.  \"Take it all together, I shall have a pleasant despatch to send to the general.  The capture of the big gun; not a man killed, and only three wounded.  How are they getting on, doctor?\"  \"Capitally.  Nothing serious.  But, by the way--\" The doctor stopped and began to clean out his pipe.  \"Yes, by the way?\" said the colonel.  \"Nothing unpleasant to report, I hope?\"  \"Um--no,\" drawled the doctor.  \"A fresh patient with a touch of fever; but it wasn't that.  I meant--that is, I wondered how you meant to send the despatch?\"  \"Ha!  Yes,\" said the colonel thoughtfully; \"how?  I don't feel disposed to risk any more men, and I hear that the Kaffirs do not seem to be tempted by the pay offered them, although I have offered double what I gave before.\"  \"That's bad,\" said the doctor.  \"Well, I suppose you can hold this place?\"  \"Tight!\" said the colonel laconically.  \"So long as provisions and ammunition hold out?\" said Captain Roby tentatively.  \"Yes,\" assented the colonel.  \"And when they are ended,\" cried Dickenson, who had sat listening in silence, \"we can try a bit of sport.  There are herds of antelopes and flocks of guinea-fowl about, sir.\"  \"I doubt it, Dickenson,\" said the colonel, smiling; \"and I fancy that the most profitable form of sport for us will be that followed out by our mounted men.\"  \"What's that, sir?\" asked Dickenson.  \"Stalking the enemy's convoys.  These fellows have to be fed, hardy and self-supporting as they are.  But there, we are pretty well supplied as yet, and the great thing is that our water-supply is never likely to fail.\"  The next morning the Boers made a fresh attack for the purpose of recapturing the gun or seizing the kopje where it was mounted.  But this advance, like several more which followed, only resulted in a severe repulse, and at last their attacks formed part of a long blockade in which they hoped to succeed by starving the little British force into subjection.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE BOER PRISONERS.  It was to this village and kopje, turned after its long occupation into what proved to be an impregnable stronghold--one which so far, to the Boers' cost, maintained its promise--that Drew Lennox and Bob Dickenson returned after their unfortunate fishing expedition, the colonel, a bluff, sun-burnt, stern-looking officer, meeting them with a frown as they came up.  \"How many men hurt, Roby?\" he said.  \"Only one, sir.  Dickenson had his ear nicked by a bullet.\"  \"Humph!  Might have been worse, my lad,\" said the colonel.  \"Show it to the doctor.--Where are your fish, Lennox?\"  \"In the river, sir,\" said the young officer, with a shrug of the shoulders.  \"How was that?\"  The young man briefly explained, and the colonel nodded his head.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"we want some change from our monotonous fare; but if you two had come back loaded with salmon I should have forbidden any further fishing--so of course I do now.  I can't afford to have my officers setting themselves up as butts for the Boers to practise at.\"  \"We have taken fifteen prisoners and their horses, sir,\" interposed Captain Roby, making an effort to turn aside the wrath of their chief.  \"Yes, Mr Roby, I saw that you had some prisoners,\" replied the colonel meaningly; \"but, excuse me, I had not finished addressing these two gentlemen.\"  \"I beg pardon, sir.\"  \"That will do,\" said the colonel.  \"There, I need say no more.  Let's see the prisoners.\"  \"I don't think I like fishing as a sport, Drew, old man,\" said Dickenson, rubbing his ear, and then wincing with pain.  \"Come on, and let's see the inspection of the enemy.  But the boss needn't have been so gruff.  We acted as bait, and he has caught fifteen Boers and their horses.\"  \"And how are we to feed them all now we have got them?\" said Lennox, with a quaint smile.  \"Oh, that's what made the old man so waxy!\" cried the other.  \"I see now.  Well, let him set them up and have them shot.\"  \"Of course; according to our merciless custom,\" said Lennox sarcastically; and directly after the two friends closed up to where the prisoners were being paraded, their horses, clever, wiry-looking little cobs, being led up behind them by some of the men.  It was almost the first time that the young men had been in such close contact with the sturdy, obstinate enemy they had so long kept at bay, and they stared eagerly at the rough, unshorn, ill-clad, farmer-like fellows, for the most part big-bearded, sun-tanned, and full of vigour, who met their gaze defiantly, but kept on directing uneasy glances at the other officers, more than once looking eagerly at their led horses as if mentally weighing whether by a bold rush they could reach their steeds, spring upon them, and gallop away.  But a glance round showed them the impossibility of such a proceeding, for they were unarmed and surrounded by men with fixed bayonets, while, in addition, every pony had an armed man holding its bridle; and as their shifty eyes were turned from one to another in a questioning way, the prevailing thought seemed to be that any such proceeding would be mad in the extreme, and could only result in their being shot down.  The inspection did not take long, and the colonel turned away to confer with the group of officers who followed him.  \"The sooner we get rid of these fellows the better,\" he said, \"for we can't keep them here.  What shall I do?\" he continued, in response to a question from the major of the "]]]
