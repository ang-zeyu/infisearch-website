He held up the men in front of me and directed them to different places. Some one told him that a wounded officer was following. This was, perhaps, as well, for I was an indistinguishable mass of filth and gore. My helmet was covered with mud, my tunic was cut about with shrapnel and bullets and saturated with blood; my breeches had changed from a khaki to a purple hue; my puttees were in tatters; my boots looked like a pair of very muddy clogs.  The military policeman consigned me to the care of some excellent fellow, of what regiment I cannot remember. After walking, or rather stumbling, a short way down Woman Street, my guide and I came upon a gunner Colonel standing outside his dug-out and trying to watch the progress of the battle through his field-glasses.  \"Good-morning,\" he said.  \"Good-morning, sir,\" I replied.  This opening of our little conversation was not meant to be in the least ironical, I can assure you. It seemed quite natural at the time.  \"Where are you hit?\" he asked.  \"In the thigh, sir. I don't think it's anything very bad.\"  \"Good. How are we getting on?\"  \"Well, I really can't say much for certain, sir. But I got nearly to their front line.\"  Walking was now becoming exceedingly painful and we proceeded slowly. I choked the groans that would rise to my lips and felt a cold perspiration pouring freely from my face. It was easier to get along by taking hold of the sides of the trench with my hands than by being supported by my guide. A party of bombers or carriers of some description passed us. We stood on one side to let them go by. In those few seconds my wound became decidedly stiffer, and I wondered if I would ever reach the end of the trenches on foot. At length the communication trench passed through a belt of trees, and we found ourselves in Cross Street.  Here was a First Aid Post, and R.A.M.C. men were hard at work. I had known those trenches for a month past, and I had never thought that Cross Street could appear so homelike. Hardly a shell was falling and the immediate din of battle had subsided. The sun was becoming hot, but the trees threw refreshing shadows over the wide, shallow brick-floored trenches built by the French two years before. The R.A.M.C. orderlies were speaking pleasant words, and men not too badly wounded were chatting gaily. I noticed a dresser at work on a man near by, and was pleased to find that the man whose wounds were being attended to was my servant L----. His wound was in the hip, a nasty hole drilled by a machine-gun bullet at close quarters. He showed me his water-bottle, penetrated by another bullet, which had inflicted a further, but slight, wound.  There were many more serious cases than mine to be attended to. After about five or ten minutes an orderly slit up my breeches.  \"The wound's in the front of the hip,\" I said.  \"Yes, but there's a larger wound where the bullets come out, sir.\"  I looked and saw a gaping hole two inches in diameter.  \"I think that's a Blighty one, isn't it?\" I remarked.  \"I should just think so, sir!\" he replied.  \"Thank God! At last!\" I murmured vehemently, conjuring up visions of the good old homeland.  The orderly painted the iodine round both wounds and put on a larger bandage. At this moment R----, an officer of \"D\" company, came limping into Cross Street.  \"Hallo, L----,\" he exclaimed, \"we had better try and get down to hospital together.\"  We started in a cavalcade to walk down the remaining trenches into the village, not before my servant, who had insisted on staying with me, had remarked--  \"I think I should like to go up again now, sir,\" and to which proposal I had answered very emphatically--  \"You won't do anything of the sort, my friend!\"  R---- led the way, with a man to help him, next came my servant, then two orderlies carrying a stretcher with a terribly wounded Scottish private on it; another orderly and myself brought up the rear--and a very slow one at that!  Turning a corner, we found ourselves amidst troops of the battalion in reserve to us, all of them eager for news. A subaltern, with whom I had been at a Divisional School, asked how far we had got. I told him that we were probably in their second line by now. This statement caused disappointment. Every one appeared to believe that we had taken the three lines in about ten minutes. I must confess that the night before the attack I had entertained hopes that it would not take us much longer than this. As a matter of fact my battalion, or the remains of it, after three hours of splendid and severe fighting, managed to penetrate into the third line trench.  Loss of blood was beginning to tell, and my progress was getting slower every minute. Each man, as I passed, put his arm forward to help me along and said a cheery word of some kind or other. Down the wide, brick-floored trench we went, past shattered trees and battered cottages, through the rank grass and luxuriant wild flowers, through the rich, unwarlike aroma of the orchard, till we emerged into the village \"boulevard.\"  The orderly held me under the arms till I was put on a wheeled stretcher and hurried along, past the \"boulevard pool\" with its surrounding elms and willows, and, at the end of the \"boulevard,\" up a street to the left. A short way up this street on the right stood the Advanced Dressing Station--a well-sandbagged house reached through the usual archway and courtyard. A dug-out, supplied with electric light and with an entrance of remarkable sandbag construction, had been tunnelled out beneath the courtyard. This was being used for operations.  In front of the archway and in the road stood two \"padrés\" directing the continuous flow of stretchers and walking wounded. They appeared to be doing all the work of organisation, while the R.A.M.C. doctors and surgeons had their hands full with dressings and operations. These were the kind of directions:  \"Wounded Sergeant? Right. Abdominal wound? All right. Lift him off--gently now. Take him through the archway into the dug-out.\"  \"Dead? Yes! Poor fellow, take him down to the Cemetery.\"  \"German? Dug-out No. 2, at the end of the road on the right.\"  Under the superintendence of the R.C. \"padré,\" a man whose sympathy and kindness I shall never forget, my stretcher was lifted off the carrier and I was placed in the archway. The \"padré\" loosened my bandage and looked at the wound, when he drew in his breath and asked if I was in much pain.  \"Not an enormous amount,\" I answered, but asked for something to drink.  \"Are you quite sure it hasn't touched the stomach?\" he questioned, looking shrewdly at me.  I emphatically denied that it had, and he brought a blood-stained mug with a little tea at the bottom of it. I can honestly say that I never enjoyed a drink so much as that one.  Shells, high explosives and shrapnel, were coming over every now and then. I kept my helmet well over my head. This also served as a shade from the sun, for it was now about ten o'clock and a sultry day. I was able to obtain a view of events round about fairly easily. From time to time orderlies tramped through the archway, bearing stretcher-cases to the dug-out. Another officer had been brought in and placed on the opposite side of the archway. The poor fellow, about nineteen, was more or less unconscious. His head and both hands were covered in bandages crimson with blood. So coated was he with mud and gore that I did not at first recognise him as an officer. At the farther end of the arch a young private of about eighteen was lying on his side, groaning in the agony of a stomach wound and crying \"Mother.\" The sympathetic \"padré\" did the best he could to comfort him. Out in the road the R.A.M.C. were dressing and bandaging the ever-increasing flow of wounded. Amongst them a captive German R.A.M.C. man, in green uniform, with a Red Cross round his sleeve, was visible, hard at work. Everything seemed so different from the deadly strife a thousand or so yards away. There, foe was inflicting wounds on foe; here were our men attending to the German wounded and the Germans attending to ours. Both sides were working so hard now to save life. There was a human touch about that scene in the ruined village street which filled one with a sense of mingled sadness and pleasure. Here were both sides united in a common attempt to repair the ravages of war. Humanity had at last asserted itself.  It was about eleven o'clock, I suppose, when the \"padré\" came up again to my stretcher and asked me if I should like to get on, as there was a berth vacant in an ambulance. The stretcher was hoisted up and slid into the bottom berth of the car. The berth above was occupied by an unconscious man. On the other side of the ambulance were four sitting cases--a private, a sergeant, a corporal, and a rifleman, the last almost unconscious. Those of us who could talk were very pleased with life, and I remember saying: \"Thank God, we're out of that hell, boys!\"  \"What's wrong with him?\" I asked the corporal, signifying the unconscious man.  \"Hit in the lungs, sir. They've set him up on purpose.\"  The corporal, pulling out his cigarette case, offered cigarettes all round, and we started to smoke. The last scene that I saw in Hébuterne was that of three men dressing a tall badly wounded Prussian officer lying on the side of the road. The ambulance turned the corner out of the village. There followed three \"crashes\" and dust flew on to the floor of the car.  \"Whizz-bangs,\" was the corporal's laconical remark.  We had passed the German road barrage, and were on our way to peace and safety.     CHAPTER IV  TOLL OF ATTACK   We climbed the little white road which led through the battery positions now almost silent, topped the crest, and dipped into Sailly-au-Bois. The village had been very little shelled since the night before, and appeared the same as ever, except that the intense traffic, which had flowed into it for the past month, had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28145"],["title","Attack: An Infantry Subaltern's Impression of July 1st, 1916 (#6)"],["body","eased. Limbers and lorries had done their work, and the only objects which filled the shell-scarred streets were slow-moving ambulances, little blood-stained groups of \"walking wounded,\" and the troops of a new division moving up into the line.  Though we were all in some pain as the ambulance jolted along through the ruts in the side of the road, we felt rather sorry for those poor chaps as they peered inside the car. Our fate was decided, theirs still hung in the balance. How often on the march one had looked back oneself into a passing ambulance and wished, rather shamefully, for a \"Blighty\" one. Sunburnt and healthy they looked as they shouted after us: \"Good luck, boys, give our love to Blighty.\"  At the end of the village the ambulance swung off on a road leading to the left. It must have crossed the track by which my platoon and I had gone up the night before. About 11.30 A.M. we arrived at Couin, the headquarters of the First Field Ambulance.  A hum of conversation and joking arose from every side, and, with some exceptions, you could not have found such a cheery gathering anywhere. The immediate strain of battle had passed, and friends meeting friends compared notes of their experiences in the \"show.\" Here a man with a bandaged arm was talking affectionately to a less fortunate \"pal\" on a stretcher, and asking him if he could do anything for him; it is extraordinary how suffering knits men together, and how much sympathy is brought out in a man at the sight of a badly wounded comrade: yonder by the huts an orderly assisted a \"walking case,\" shot through the lungs and vomiting blood freely.  Near by I recognised E----'s servant of the L---- S----. When he had finished giving some tea or water to a friend, I hailed him and asked him if Mr. E---- was hit. Mr. E----, he told me, had been laid up for some days past, and had not taken part in the attack. He was, however, going round and writing letters for the men. Would I like to see him? We were fairly good acquaintances, so I said that I should. Presently he arrived.  \"Bad luck, old chap. Where have you caught it?\" he asked.  \"In the thigh,\" I replied.  He wrote two post-cards home for me, one home and another to relatives, and I did my best to sign them. I remember that on one of them was inscribed: \"This is to let you know that E---- has been caught bending,\" and wondering what my grandfather, a doctor, would make out of that!  The sun was beating down on us now, and since, after I had been duly labelled \"G.S.W. (gun-shot wound) Back,\" a Medical Staff Officer advised that I should be transferred into the officers' hut, I entered its cooler shades with much gladness.  Captain W----t came in soon afterwards. In the second line German trench he had looked over the parados to see if any opposition was coming up from the third line trench, and had been hit by a machine-gun bullet in the shoulder. In making his way home he had been hit twice again in the shoulder. H---- also put in an appearance with a bullet wound in the arm. He had taken a party of \"walking wounded\" up to Sailly-au-Bois, and got a car on. A doctor brought round the familiar old beverage of tea, which in large quantities, and in company with whisky, had helped us through many an unpleasant day in the trenches. Captain W----t refused it, and insisted on having some bread and jam. I took both with much relish, and, having appeased an unusually large appetite, got an orderly to wash my face and hands, which were coated with blood.  \"I dare say you feel as you was gettin' back to civilisation again, sir,\" he said. Much refreshed, and quietly looking at a new number of _The Tatler_, I certainly felt as if I was, though, in spite of an air ring, the wound was feeling rather uncomfortable. At the end of the hut two or three poor fellows were dying of stomach wounds. It was a peculiar contrast to hear two or three men chatting gaily just outside my end of the hut. I could only catch fragments of the conversation, which I give here.  \"When Mr. A---- gave the order to advance, I went over like a bird.\"  \"The effect of the rum, laddie!\"  \"Mr A---- was going strong too.\"  \"What's happened to Mr. A----, do you know?\"  \"Don't know. I didn't see 'im after that.\"  \"'E's all right. Saw him just now. Got a wound in the arm.\"  \"Good. Isn't the sun fine here? Couldn't want a better morning for an attack, could you?\"  The hut was filling rapidly, and the three stomach cases being quite hopeless were removed outside. A doctor brought in an officer of the K----'s. He was quite dazed, and sank full length on a bed, passing his hand across his face and moaning. He was not wounded, but had been blown up whilst engaged in cutting a communication trench across No Man's Land, they told me. It was not long, however, before he recovered his senses sufficiently enough to walk with help to an ambulance. A \"padré\" entered, supporting a young officer of the ----, a far worse case of shell shock, and laid him out on the bed. He had no control over himself, and was weeping hysterically.  \"For God's sake don't let me go back, don't send me back!\" he cried.  The \"padré\" tried to comfort him.  \"You'll soon be in a nice hospital at the Base, old chap, or probably in England.\"  He looked at the padré blankly, not understanding a word that he was saying.  A more extraordinary case of shell shock was that of an officer lying about three beds down from me. In the usual course of events an R.A.M.C. corporal asked him his name.  \"F----,\" he replied in a vague tone.  The corporal thought that he had better make certain, so with as polite a manner as possible looked at his identification disc.  \"It puts Lt. B---- here,\" he said.  There followed a lengthy argument, at the end of which the patient said--  \"Well, it's no use. You had better give it up. I don't know what my name is!\"  A Fusilier officer was carried in on a stretcher and laid next to me. After a time he said--  \"Is your name L----?\"  I replied affirmatively.  \"Don't you recognise me?\" he questioned.  I looked at him, but could not think where I had seen him before.  \"My name's D----. I was your Company Quartermaster-Sergeant in the Second Battalion.\" Then I remembered him, though it had been hard to recognise him in officer's uniform, blood-stained and tattered at that. We compared notes of our experiences since I had left the second line of my battalion in England nearly a year before, until, soon afterwards, he was taken out to an ambulance.  At the other end of the hut it was just possible to see an officer tossing to and fro deliriously on a stretcher. I use the word \"deliriously,\" though he was probably another case of shell shock. He was wounded also, judging by the bandages which swathed the middle part of his body. The poor fellow thought that he was still fighting, and every now and again broke out like this--  \"Keep 'em off, boys. Keep 'em off. Give me a bomb, sergeant. Get down! My God! I'm hit. Put some more of those sandbags on the barricade. These damned shells! Can I stand it any longer? Come on, boys. Come along, sergeant! We must go for them. Oh! my God! I must stick it!\"  After a time the cries became fainter, and the stretcher was taken out.  About three o'clock I managed to get a doctor to inject me with anti-tetanus. I confess that I was rather anxious about getting this done, for in crawling back across No Man's Land my wound had been covered with mud and dirt. The orderly, who put on the iodine, told me that the German artillery was sending shrapnel over the ridge. This was rather disconcerting, but, accustomed as I had become to shrapnel at close quarters, the sounds seemed so distant that I did not bother more about them.  It must have been about four o'clock when my stretcher was picked up and I passed once again into the warm sunlight. Outside an orderly relieved me of my steel and gas helmets, in much the same way as the collector takes your ticket when you pass through the gates of a London terminus in a taxi. Once more the stretcher was slid into an ambulance, and I found myself in company with a young subaltern of the K----'s. He was very cheery, and continued to assert that we should all be in \"Blighty\" in a day or two's time. When the A.S.C. driver appeared at the entrance of the car and confirmed our friend's opinion, I began to entertain the most glorious visions of the morrow--visions which I need hardly say did not come true.  \"How were you hit?\" I asked the officer of the K----'s.  \"I got a machine-gun bullet in the pit of the stomach while digging that communication trench into No Man's Land. It's been pretty bad, but the pain's going now, and I think I shall be all right.\"  Then he recognised the man on the stretcher above me.  \"Hullo, laddie,\" he said. \"What have they done to you?\"  \"I've been hit in the left wrist and the leg, sir. I hope you aren't very bad.\"  The engine started, and we set off on our journey to the Casualty Clearing Station. For the last time we passed the villages, which we had come to know so intimately in the past two months during rest from the trenches. There was Souastre, where one had spent pleasant evenings at the Divisional Theatre; St. Amand with its open square in front of the church, the meeting-place of the villagers, now deserted save for two or three soldiers; Gaudiempré, the headquarters of an Army Service Corps park, with its lines of roughly made stables. At one part of the journey a 15-inch gun let fly just over the road. We had endured quite enough noise for that day, and I was glad that it did not occur again. From a rather tortuous course through bye-lanes we turned into the main Arras to Doullens road--that long, straight, typical French highway with its avenue of poplars. Shortly afterwards the ambulance drew up outside the Casualty Clearing Station.  The Casualty Clearing Station was situated in the grounds of a château. I believe that the château itself was used as a hospital for those"]]]
