Come, contrary to your custom, reply frankly.”  “It is true, your excellency; it is what I meant.”  “And, according to you, my daughter reciprocates the passion, no doubt?”  “I fear so, your excellency.”  “And what makes you think this, say?”  “First, Mr. Foedor never misses a chance of speaking to the lady Vaninka.”  “He is in the same house with her, would you have him avoid her?”  “When the lady Vaninka returns late, and when perchance Mr. Foedor has not accompanied you, whatever the hour Mr. Foedor is there, ready, to help her out of the carriage.”  “Foedor attends me, it is his duty,” said the general, beginning to believe that the serf’s suspicions were founded on slight grounds. “He waits for me,” he, continued, “because when I return, at any hour of the day or night, I may have orders to give him.”  “Not a day passes without Mr. Foedor going into my lady Vaninka’s room, although such a favour is not usually granted to a young man in a house like that of your excellency.”  “Usually it is I who send him to her,” said the general.  “Yes, in the daytime,” replied Gregory, “but at night?”  “At night!” cried the general, rising to his feet, and turning so pale that, after a moment, he was forced to lean for support on a table.  “Yes, at night, your excellency,” answered Gregory quietly; “and since, as you say, I have begun to mix myself up in a bad business, I must go on with it; besides, even if there were to result from it another punishment for me, even more terrible than that I have already endured, I should not allow so good, a master to be deceived any longer.”  “Be very careful about what you are going to say, slave; for I know the men of your nation. Take care, if the accusation you are making by way of revenge is not supported by visible, palpable, and positive proofs, you shall be punished as an infamous slanderer.”  “To that I agree,” said Gregory.  “Do you affirm that you have seen Foedor enter my daughter’s chamber at night?”  “I do not say that I have seen him enter it, your excellency. I say that I have seen him come out.”  “When was that?”  “A quarter of an hour ago, when I was on my way to your excellency.”  “You lie!” said the general, raising his fist.  “This is not our agreement, your excellency,” said the slave, drawing back. “I am only to be punished if I fail to give proofs.”  “But what are your proofs?”  “I have told you.”  “And do you expect me to believe your word alone?”  “No; but I expect you to believe your own eyes.”  “How?”  “The first time that Mr. Foedor is in my lady Vaninka’s room after midnight, I shall come to find your excellency, and then you can judge for yourself if I lie; but up to the present, your excellency, all the conditions of the service I wish to render you are to my disadvantage.”  “In what way?”  “Well, if I fail to give proofs, I am to be treated as an infamous slanderer; but if I give them, what advantage shall I gain?”  “A thousand roubles and your freedom.”  “That is a bargain, then, your excellency,” replied Gregory quietly, replacing the razors on the general’s toilet-table, “and I hope that before a week has passed you will be more just to me than you are now.”  With these words the slave left the room, leaving the general convinced by his confidence that some dreadful misfortune threatened him.  From this time onward, as might be expected, the general weighed every word and noticed every gesture which passed between Vaninka and Foedor in his presence; but he saw nothing to confirm his suspicions on the part of the aide-de-camp or of his daughter; on the contrary, Vaninka seemed colder and more reserved than ever.  A week passed in this way. About two o’clock in the morning of the ninth day, someone knocked at the general’s door. It was Gregory.  “If your excellency will go into your daughter’s room,” said Gregory, “you will find Mr. Foedor there.”  The general turned pale, dressed himself without uttering a word, and followed the slave to the door of Vaninka’s room. Having arrived there, with a motion of his hand he dismissed the informer, who, instead of retiring in obedience to this mute command, hid himself in the corner of the corridor.  When the general believed himself to be alone, he knocked once; but all was silent. This silence, however, proved nothing; for Vaninka might be asleep. He knocked a second time, and the young girl, in a perfectly calm voice, asked, “Who is there?”  “It is I,” said the general, in a voice trembling with emotion.  “Annouschka!” said the girl to her foster-sister, who slept in the adjoining room, “open the door to my father. Forgive me, father,” she continued; “but Annouschka is dressing, and will be with you in a moment.”  The general waited patiently, for he could discover no trace of emotion in his daughter’s voice, and he hoped that Gregory had been mistaken.  In a few moments the door opened, and the general went in, and cast a long look around him; there was no one in this first apartment.  Vaninka was in bed, paler perhaps than usual, but quite calm, with the loving smile on her lips with which she always welcomed her father.  “To what fortunate circumstance,” asked the young girl in her softest tones, “do I owe the pleasure of seeing you at so late an hour?”  “I wished to speak to you about a very important matter,” said the general, “and however late it was, I thought you would forgive me for disturbing you.”  “My father will always be welcome in his daughter’s room, at whatever hour of the day or night he presents himself there.”  The general cast another searching look round, and was convinced that it was impossible for a man to be concealed in the first room—but the second still remained.  “I am listening,” said Vaninka, after a moment of silence.  “Yes, but we are not alone,” replied the general, “and it is important that no other ears should hear what I have to say to you.”  “Annauschka, as you know, is my foster-sister,” said Vaninka.  “That makes no difference,” said the general, going candle in hand into the next room, which was somewhat smaller than his daughter’s. “Annouschka,” said he, “watch in the corridor and see that no one overhears us.”  As he spoke these words, the general threw the same scrutinizing glance all round the room, but with the exception of the young girl there was no one there.  Annouschka obeyed, and the general followed her out, and, looking eagerly round for the last time, re-entered his daughter’s room, and seated himself on the foot of her bed. Annouschka, at a sign from her mistress, left her alone with her father. The general held out his hand to Vaninka, and she took it without hesitation.  “My child,” said the general, “I have to speak to you about a very important matter.”  “What is it, father?” said Vaninka.  “You will soon be eighteen,” continued the general, “and that is the age at which the daughters of the Russian nobility usually marry.” The general paused for a moment to watch the effect of these words upon Vaninka, but her hand rested motionless in his. “For the last year your hand has been engaged by me,” continued the general.  “May I know to whom?” asked Vaninka coldly.  “To the son of the Councillor-in-Ordinary,” replied the general. “What is your opinion of him?”  “He is a worthy and noble young man, I am told, but I can have formed no opinion except from hearsay. Has he not been in garrison at Moscow for the last three months?”  “Yes,” said the general, “but in three months’ time he should return.”  Vaninka remained silent.  “Have you nothing to say in reply?” asked the general.  “Nothing, father; but I have a favour to ask of you.”  “What is it?”  “I do not wish to marry until I am twenty years old.”  “Why not?”  “I have taken a vow to that effect.”  “But if circumstances demanded the breaking of this vow, and made the celebration of this marriage imperatively necessary?”  “What circumstances?” asked Vaninka.  “Foedor loves you,” said the general, looking steadily at Vaninka.  “I know that,” said Vaninka, with as little emotion as if the question did not concern her.  “You know that!” cried the general.  “Yes; he has told me so.”  “When?”  “Yesterday.”  “And you replied—?”  “That he must leave here at once.”  “And he consented?”  “Yes, father.”  “When does he go?”  “He has gone.”  “How can that be?” said the general: “he only left me at ten o’clock.”  “And he left me at midnight,” said Vaninka.  “Ah!” said the general, drawing a deep breath of relief, “you are a noble girl, Vaninka, and I grant you what you ask-two years more. But remember it is the emperor who has decided upon this marriage.”  “My father will do me the justice to believe that I am too submissive a daughter to be a rebellious subject.”  “Excellent, Vaninka, excellent,” said the general. “So, then, poor Foedor has told you all?”  “Yes,” said Vaninka.  “You knew that he addressed himself to me first?”  “I knew it.”  “Then it was from him that you heard that your hand was engaged?”  “It was from him.”  “And he consented to leave you? He is a good and noble young man, who shall always be under my protection wherever he goes. Oh, if my word had not been given, I love him so much that, supposing you did not dislike him, I should have given him your hand.”  “And you cannot recall your promise?” asked Vaninka.  “Impossible,” said the general.  “Well, then, I submit to my father’s will,” said Vaninka.  “That is spoken like my daughter,” said the general, embracing her. “Farewell, Vaninka; I do not ask if you love him. You have both done your duty, and I have nothing more to exact.”  With these words, he rose and left the room. Annouschka was in the corridor; the general signed to her that she might go in again, and went on his way. At the door of his room he found Gregory waiting for him.  “Well, your excellency?” he asked.  “Well,” said the general, “you are both right and wrong. Foedor loves my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],["title","Vaninka (#8)"],["body","aughter, but my daughter does not love him. He went into my daughter’s room at eleven o’clock, but at midnight he left her for ever. No matter, come to me tomorrow, and you shall have your thousand roubles and your liberty.”  Gregory went off, dumb with astonishment.  Meanwhile, Annouschka had re-entered her mistress’s room, as she had been ordered, and closed the door carefully behind her.  Vaninka immediately sprang out of bed and went to the door, listening to the retreating footsteps of the general. When they had ceased to be heard, she rushed into Annouschka’s room, and both began to pull aside a bundle of linen, thrown down, as if by accident, into the embrasure of a window. Under the linen was a large chest with a spring lock. Annouschka pressed a button, Vaninka raised the lid. The two women uttered a loud cry: the chest was now a coffin; the young officer, stifled for want of air, lay dead within.  For a long time the two women hoped it was only a swoon. Annouschka sprinkled his face with water; Vaninka put salts to his nose. All was in vain. During the long conversation which the general had had with his daughter, and which had lasted more than half an hour, Foedor, unable to get out of the chest, as the lid was closed by a spring, had died for want of air. The position of the two girls shut up with a corpse was frightful. Annouschka saw Siberia close at hand; Vaninka, to do her justice, thought of nothing but Foedor. Both were in despair. However, as the despair of the maid was more selfish than that of her mistress, it was Annouschka who first thought of a plan of escaping from the situation in which they were placed.  “My lady,” she cried suddenly, “we are saved.” Vaninka raised her head and looked at her attendant with her eyes bathed in tears.  “Saved?” said she, “saved? We are, perhaps, but Foedor!”  “Listen now,” said Annouschka: “your position is terrible, I grant that, and your grief is great; but your grief could be greater and your position more terrible still. If the general knew this.”  “What difference would it make to me?” said Vaninka. “I shall weep for him before the whole world.”  “Yes, but you will be dishonoured before the whole world! To-morrow your slaves, and the day after all St. Petersburg, will know that a man died of suffocation while concealed in your chamber. Reflect, my lady: your honour is the honour of your father, the honour of your family.”  “You are right,” said Vaninka, shaking her head, as if to disperse the gloomy thoughts that burdened her brain,—“you are right, but what must we do?”  “Does my lady know my brother Ivan?”  “Yes.”  “We must tell him all.”  “Of what are you thinking?” cried Vaninka. “To confide in a man? A man, do I say? A serf! a slave!”  “The lower the position of the serf and slave, the safer will our secret be, since he will have everything to gain by keeping faith with us.”  “Your brother is a drunkard,” said Vaninka, with mingled fear and disgust.  “That is true,” said Annouschka; “but where will you find a slave who is not? My brother gets drunk less than most, and is therefore more to be trusted than the others. Besides, in the position in which we are we must risk something.”  “You are right,” said Vaninka, recovering her usual resolution, which always grew in the presence of danger. “Go and seek your brother.”  “We can do nothing this morning,” said Annouschka, drawing back the window curtains. “Look, the dawn is breaking.”  “But what can we do with the body of this unhappy man?” cried Vaninka.  “It must remain hidden where it is all day, and this evening, while you are at the Court entertainment, my brother shall remove it.”  “True,” murmured Vaninka in a strange tone, “I must go to Court this evening; to stay away would arouse suspicion. Oh, my God! my God!”  “Help me, my lady,” said Annouschka; “I am not strong enough alone.”  Vaninka turned deadly pale, but, spurred on by the danger, she went resolutely up to the body of her lover; then, lifting it by the shoulders, while her maid raised it by the legs, she laid it once more in the chest. Then Annouschka shut down the lid, locked the chest, and put the key into her breast. Then both threw back the linen which had hidden it from the eyes of the general. Day dawned, as might be expected, ere sleep visited the eyes of Vaninka.  She went down, however, at the breakfast hour; for she did not wish to arouse the slightest suspicion in her father’s mind. Only it might have been thought from her pallor that she had risen from the grave, but the general attributed this to the nocturnal disturbance of which he had been the cause.  Luck had served Vaninka wonderfully in prompting her to say that Foedor had already gone; for not only did the general feel no surprise when he did not appear, but his very absence was a proof of his daughter’s innocence. The general gave a pretext for his aide-de-camp’s absence by saying that he had sent him on a mission. As for Vaninka, she remained out of her room till it was time to dress. A week before, she had been at the Court entertainment with Foedor.  Vaninka might have excused herself from accompanying her father by feigning some slight indisposition, but two considerations made her fear to act thus: the first was the fear of making the general anxious, and perhaps of making him remain at home himself, which would make the removal of the corpse more difficult; the second was the fear of meeting Ivan and having to blush before a slave. She preferred, therefore, to make a superhuman effort to control herself; and, going up again into her room, accompanied by her faithful Annouschka, she began to dress with as much care as if her heart were full of joy. When this cruel business was finished, she ordered Annouschka to shut the door; for she wished to see Foedor once more, and to bid a last farewell to him who had been her lover. Annouschka obeyed; and Vaninka, with flowers in her hair and her breast covered with jewels, glided like a phantom into her servant’s room.  Annouschka again opened the chest, and Vaninka, without shedding a tear, without breathing a sigh, with the profound and death-like calm of despair, leant down towards Foedor and took off a plain ring which the young man had on his finger, placed it on her own, between two magnificent rings, then kissing him on the brow, she said, “Goodbye, my betrothed.”  At this moment she heard steps approaching. It was a groom of the chambers coming from the general to ask if she were ready. Annouschka let the lid of the chest fall, and Vaninka going herself to open the door, followed the messenger, who walked before her, lighting the way.  Such was her trust in her foster-sister that she left her to accomplish the dark and terrible task with which she had burdened herself.  A minute later, Annouschka saw the carriage containing the general and his daughter leave by the main gate of the hotel.  She let half an hour go by, and then went down to look for Ivan. She found him drinking with Gregory, with whom the general had kept his word, and who had received the same day one thousand roubles and his liberty. Fortunately, the revellers were only beginning their rejoicings, and Ivan in consequence was sober enough for his sister to entrust her secret to him without hesitation.  Ivan followed Annouschka into the chamber of her mistress. There she reminded him of all that Vaninka, haughty but generous, had allowed his sister to do for him. The, few glasses of brandy Ivan had already swallowed had predisposed him to gratitude (the drunkenness of the Russian is essentially tender). Ivan protested his devotion so warmly that Annouschka hesitated no longer, and, raising the lid of the chest, showed him the corpse of Foedor. At this terrible sight Ivan remained an instant motionless, but he soon began to calculate how much money and how many benefits the possession of such a secret would bring him. He swore by the most solemn oaths never to betray his mistress, and offered, as Annouschka had hoped, to dispose of the body of the unfortunate aide-decamp.  The thing was easily done. Instead of returning to drink with Gregory and his comrades, Ivan went to prepare a sledge, filled it with straw, and hid at the bottom an iron crowbar. He brought this to the outside gate, and assuring himself he was not being spied upon, he raised the body of the dead man in his arms, hid it under the straw, and sat down above it. He had the gate of the hotel opened, followed Niewski Street as far as the Zunamenie Church, passed through the shops in the Rejestwenskoi district, drove the sledge out on to the frozen Neva, and halted in the middle of the river, in front of the deserted church of Ste. Madeleine. There, protected by the solitude and darkness, hidden behind the black mass of his sledge, he began to break the ice, which was fifteen inches thick, with his pick. When he had made a large enough hole, he searched the body of Foedor, took all the money he had about him, and slipped the body head foremost through the opening he had made. He then made his way back to the hotel, while the imprisoned current of the Neva bore away the corpse towards the Gulf of Finland. An hour after, a new crust of ice had formed, and not even a trace of the opening made by Ivan remained.  At midnight Vaninka returned with her father. A hidden fever had been consuming her all the evening: never had she looked so lovely, and she had been overwhelmed by the homage of the most distinguished nobles and courtiers. When she returned, she found Annouschka in the vestibule waiting to take her cloak. As she gave it to her, Vaninka sent her one of those questioning glances that seem to express so much. “It is done,” said the girl in a low voice. Vaninka breathed a sigh of relief, as if a mountain had been removed from her breast. Great as was her self-control, she could no longer bear her father’s presence, and excused herself from remaining to supper with him, on the"]]]
