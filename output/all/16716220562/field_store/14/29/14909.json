The sound of distant music is heard on the lake; and the barges of      Sir Roderick are discovered, proceeding in triumph to the island.      Ellen, hearing her father's horn at that instant on the opposite      shore, flies to meet him and Malcolm Graeme, who is received with      cold and stately civility by the lord of the isle. Sir Roderick      informs the Douglas that his retreat has been discovered, and that      the King (James V), under pretence of hunting, has assembled a      large force in the neighborhood. He then proposes impetuously that      they should unite their fortunes by his marriage with Ellen, and      rouse the whole Western Highlands. The Douglas, intimating that his      daughter has repugnances which she cannot overcome, declares that      he will retire to a cave in the neighboring mountains until the      issue of the King's threat is seen. The heart of Roderick is wrung      with agony at this rejection; and when Malcolm advances to Ellen,      he pushes him violently back--and a scuffle ensues, which is with      difficulty appeased by the giant arm of Douglas. Malcolm then      withdraws in proud resentment, plunges into the water, and swims      over by moonlight to the mainland.       \"The third canto opens with an account of the ceremonies employed      in summoning the clan. This is accomplished by the consecration of      a small wooden cross, which, with its points scorched and dipped in      blood, is carried with incredible celerity through the whole      territory of the chieftain. The eager fidelity with which this      fatal signal is carried on, is represented with great spirit. A      youth starts from the side of his father's coffin, to bear it      forward, and, having run his stage, delivers it to a young      bridegroom returning from church, who instantly binds his plaid      around him, and rushes onward. In the meantime Douglas and his      daughter have taken refuge in the mountain cave; and Sir Roderick,      passing near their retreat on his way to the muster, hears Ellen's      voice singing her evening hymn to the Virgin. He does not obtrude      on her devotions, but hurries to the place of rendezvous.       \"The fourth canto begins with some ceremonies by a wild hermit of      the clan, to ascertain the issue of the impending war; and this      oracle is obtained--that the party shall prevail which first sheds      the blood of its adversary. The scene then shifts to the retreat of      the Douglas, where the minstrel is trying to soothe Ellen in her      alarm at the disappearance of her father by singing a fairy ballad      to her. As the song ends, the knight of Snowdoun suddenly appears      before her, declares his love, and urges her to put herself under      his protection. Ellen throws herself on his generosity, confesses      her attachment to Graeme, and prevails on him to seek his own      safety by a speedy retreat from the territory of Roderick Dhu.      Before he goes, the stranger presents her with a ring, which he      says he has received from King James, with a promise to grant any      boon asked by the person producing it. As he retreats, his      suspicions are excited by the conduct of his guide, and confirmed      by the warnings of a mad woman whom they encounter. His false guide      discharges an arrow at him, which kills the maniac. The knight      slays the murderer; and learning from the expiring victim that her      brain had been turned by the cruelty of Sir Roderick Dhu, he vows      vengeance. When chilled with the midnight cold and exhausted with      fatigue, he suddenly comes upon a chief reposing by a lonely      watch-fire; and being challenged in the name of Roderick Dhu,      boldly avows himself his enemy. The clansman, however, disdains to      take advantage of a worn-out wanderer; and pledges him safe escort      out of Sir Roderick's territory, when he must answer his defiance      with his sword. The stranger accepts these chivalrous terms; and      the warriors sup and sleep together. This ends the fourth canto.       \"At dawn, the knight and the mountaineer proceed toward the Lowland      frontier. A dispute arises concerning the character of Roderick      Dhu, and the knight expresses his desire to meet in person and do      vengeance upon the predatory chief. 'Have then thy wish!' answers      his guide; and gives a loud whistle. A whole legion of armed men      start up from their mountain ambush in the heath; while the chief      turns proudly and says, 'I am Roderick Dhu!' Sir Roderick then by a      signal dismisses his men to their concealment. Arrived at his      frontier, the chief forces the knight to stand upon his defense.      Roderick, after a hard combat is laid wounded on the ground;      Fitz-James, sounding his bugle, brings four squires to his side;      and, after giving the wounded chief into their charge, gallops      rapidly on towards Stirling. As he ascends the hill to the castle,      he descries approaching the same place the giant form of Douglas,      who has come to deliver himself up to the King, in order to save      Malcolm Graeme and Sir Roderick from the impending danger. Before      entering the castle, Douglas is seized with the whim to engage in      the holiday sports which are going forward outside; he wins prize      after prize, and receives his reward from the hand of the prince,      who, however does not condescend to recognize his former favorite.      Roused at last by an insult from one of the royal grooms, Douglas      proclaims himself, and is ordered into custody by the King. At this      instant a messenger arrives with tidings of an approaching battle      between the clan of Roderick and the King's lieutenant, the Earl of      Mar; and is ordered back to prevent the conflict, by announcing      that both Sir Roderick and Lord Douglas are in the hands of their      sovereign.       \"The last canto opens in the guard room of the royal castle at      Stirling, at dawn. While the mercenaries are quarreling and singing      at the close of a night of debauch, the sentinels introduce Ellen      and the minstrel Allan-bane--who are come in search of Douglas.      Ellen awes the ruffian soldiery by her grace and liberality, and is      at length conducted to a more seemly waiting place, until she may      obtain audience with the King. While Allan-bane, in the cell of Sir      Roderick, sings to the dying chieftain of the glorious battle which      has just been waged by his clansmen against the forces of the Earl      of Mar, Ellen, in another part of the palace, hears the voice of      Malcolm Graeme lamenting his captivity from an adjoining turret.      Before she recovers from her agitation she is startled by the      appearance of Fitz-James, who comes to inform her that the court is      assembled, and the King at leisure to receive her suit. He conducts      her to the hall of presence, round which Ellen casts a timid and      eager glance for the monarch. But all the glittering figures are      uncovered, and James Fitz-James alone wears his cap and plume. The      Knight of Snowdoun is the King of Scotland! Struck with awe and      terror, Ellen falls speechless at his feet, pointing to the ring      which he has put upon her finger. The prince raises her with eager      kindness, declares that her father is forgiven, and bids her ask      for a boon for some other person. The name of Graeme trembles on      her lips, but she cannot trust herself to utter it. The King, in      playful vengeance, condemns Malcolm Graeme to fetters, takes a      chain of gold from his own neck, and throwing it over that of the      young chief, puts the clasp in the hand of Ellen.\"  From this outline, it will be evident that Scott had gained greatly in narrative power since the production of _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_. Not only are the elements of the \"fable\" (to use the word in its old-fashioned sense) harmonious and probable, but the various incidents grow out of each other in a natural and necessary way. The _Lay_ was at best a skillful bit of carpentering whereof the several parts were nicely juxtaposed; _The Lady of the Lake_ is an organism, and its several members partake of a common life. A few weaknesses may, it is true, be pointed out in it. The warning of Fitz-James by the mad woman's song makes too large a draft upon our romantic credulity. Her appearance is at once so accidental and so opportune that it resembles those supernatural interventions employed by ancient tragedy to cut the knot of a difficult situation, which have given rise to the phrase _deus ex machina_. The improbability of the episode is further increased by the fact that she puts her warning in the form of a song. Scott's love of romantic episode manifestly led him astray here. Further, the story as a whole shares with all stories which turn upon the revelation of a concealed identity, the disadvantage of being able to affect the reader powerfully but once, since on a second reading the element of suspense and surprise is lacking. In so far as _The Lady of the Lake_ is a mere story, or as it has been called, a \"versified novelette,\" this is not a weakness; but in so far as it is a poem, with the claim which poetry legitimately makes to be read and reread for its intrinsic beauty, it constitutes a real defect.  Not only does this poem, with the slight exceptions just mentioned, show a gain over the earlier poems in narrative power, but it also marks an advance in character delineation. The characters of the _Lay_ are, with one or two exceptions, mere lay-figures; Lord Cranstoun and Margaret are the most conventional of lovers; William of Deloraine is little more than an animated suit of armor, and the Lady of Branksome, except at one point, when from her walls she defies the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28287"],["title","The Lady of the Lake (#7)"],["body","invaders, is nearly or quite featureless. With the characters of _The Lady of the Lake_ the case is very different. The three rivals for Ellen's hand are real men, with individualities which enhance and deepen the picturesqueness of each other by contrast. The easy grace and courtly chivalry, of the disguised King, the quick kindling of his fancy at sight of the mysterious maid of Loch Katrine, his quick generosity in relinquishing his suit when he finds that she loves another, make him one of the most life-like figures of romance. Roderick Dhu, nursing darkly his clannish hatreds, his hopeless love, and his bitter jealousy, with a delicate chivalry sending its bright thread through the tissue of his savage nature, is drawn with an equally convincing hand. Against his gloomy figure the boyish magnanimity of Malcolm Graeme, Ellen's brave faithfulness, made human by a surface play of coquetry, and the quiet nobility of the exiled Douglas, stand out in varied relief. Judged in connection with the more conventional character types of _Marmion_, and with the draped automatons of the _Lay_, the characters of _The Lady of the Lake_ show the gradual growth in Scott of that dramatic imagination which was later to fill the vast scene of his prose romances with unforgettable figures.  But the most significant advance which this poem shows over earlier work is in the greater genuineness of the poetic effect. In the description, for example, of the approach of Roderick Dhu's boats to the island, there is a singular depth of race feeling. There is borne in upon us, as we read, the realization of a wild and peculiar civilization; we get a breath of poetry keen and strange, like the shrilling of the bag-pipes across the water. Again, in the speeding of the fiery cross there is a primitive depth of poetry which carries with it a sense of \"old, unhappy, far-off things\"; it appeals to latent memories in us, which have been handed down from an ancestral past. There is nothing in either _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_ or _Marmion_ to compare for natural dramatic force with the situation in _The Lady of the Lake_ when Roderick Dhu whistles for his clansmen to appear, and the astonished Fitz-James sees the lonely mountain side suddenly bristle with tartans and spears; and the fight which follows at the ford is a real fight, in a sense not at all to be applied to the tournaments and other conventional encounters of the earlier poems. Even where Scott still clung to supernatural devices to help along his story, he handles them with much greater subtlety than he had done in his earlier efforts. The dropping of Douglas's sword from its scabbard when his disguised enemy enters the room, arouses the imagination without burdening it. It has the same imaginative advantage over such an episode as that in the _Lay_, where the ghost of the wizard comes to bear off the goblin page, as suggestion always has over explicit statement. This gain in subtlety of treatment will be made still more apparent by comparing with any supernatural episode of the _Lay_, the account in _The Lady of the Lake_ of the unearthly parentage of Brian the Hermit.  The gain in style is less perceptible. Scott was never a great stylist; he struck out at the very first a nervous, hurrying meter, and a strong though rather commonplace diction, upon which he never substantially improved. Abundant action, rapid transitions, stirring descriptions, common sentiments and ordinary language heightened by a dash of pomp and novelty, above all a pervading animation, spirit, intrepidity--these are the constant elements of Scott's success, present here in their accustomed measure. In the broader sense of style, however, where the word is understood to include all the processes leading to a given poetical effect, _The Lady of the Lake_ has some advantage, even over _Marmion_. It contains nothing, to be sure, so fine or so typical of Scott's peculiar power, as the account of the Battle of Flodden in _Marmion_; the minstrel's recital of the battle of Beal' an Duine does not abide the comparison. The quieter parts of _The Lady of the Lake_, moreover, are sometimes disfigured by a sentimentality and \"prettiness\" happily unfrequent with Scott. But the description of the approach of Roderick Dhu's war-boats, already mentioned, the superb landscape delineation in the fifth canto, and the beautiful twilight ending of canto third, can well stand as prime types of Scott's stylistic power.     THE LADY OF THE LAKE     CANTO FIRST  THE CHASE     Harp of the North! that moldering long hast hung     On the witch-elm that shades Saint Fillan's spring,   And down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung,     Till envious ivy did around thee cling,   Muffling with verdant ringlet every string--                     5     O Minstrel Harp, still must thine accents sleep?   Mid rustling leaves and fountains murmuring,     Still must thy sweeter sounds their silence keep,   Nor bid a warrior smile, nor teach a maid to weep?    Not thus, in ancient days of Caledon,                           10     Was thy voice mute amid the festal crowd,   When lay of hopeless love, or glory won,     Aroused the fearful, or subdued the proud.   At each according pause, was heard aloud     Thine ardent symphony sublime and high!                       15   Fair dames and crested chiefs attention bowed;     For still the burden of thy minstrelsy   Was Knighthood's dauntless deed, and Beauty's matchless eye.    O wake once more! how rude soe'er the hand     That ventures o'er thy magic maze to stray;                   20   O wake once more! though scarce my skill command     Some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay;   Though harsh and faint, and soon to die away,     And all unworthy of thy nobler strain,   Yet if one heart throb higher at its sway,                      25     The wizard note has not been touched in vain.   Then silent be no more! Enchantress, wake again!   I    The stag at eve had drunk his fill,   Where danced the moon on Monan's rill,   And deep his midnight lair had made                             30   In lone Glenartney's hazel shade;   But, when the sun his beacon red   Had kindled on Benvoirlich's head,   The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay   Resounded up the rocky way,                                     35   And faint, from farther distance borne,   Were heard the clanging hoof and horn.   II    As Chief, who hears his warder call,   \"To arms! the foemen storm the wall,\"   The antlered monarch of the waste                               40   Sprung from his heathery couch in haste.   But ere his fleet career he took,   The dew-drops from his flanks he shook;   Like crested leader proud and high,   Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky;                          45   A moment gazed adown the dale,   A moment snuffed the tainted gale,   A moment listened to the cry,   That thickened as the chase drew nigh;   Then, as the headmost foes appeared,                            50   With one brave bound the copse he cleared,   And, stretching forward free and far,   Sought the wild heaths of Uam-Var.   III    Yelled on the view the opening pack;   Rock, glen, and cavern, paid them back;                         55   To many a mingled sound at once   The awakened mountain gave response.   A hundred dogs bayed deep and strong,   Clattered a hundred steeds along,   Their peal the merry horns rung out,                            60   A hundred voices joined the shout;   With hark and whoop and wild halloo,   No rest Benvoirlich's echoes knew.   Far from the tumult fled the roe;   Close in her covert cowered the doe;                            65   The falcon, from her cairn on high,   Cast on the rout a wondering eye,   Till far beyond her piercing ken   The hurricane had swept the glen.   Faint, and more faint, its failing din                          70   Returned from cavern, cliff, and linn,   And silence settled, wide and still,   On the lone wood and mighty hill.   IV    Less loud the sounds of silvan war   Disturbed the heights of Uam-Var,                               75   And roused the cavern, where, 'tis told,   A giant made his den of old;   For ere that steep ascent was won,   High in his pathway hung the sun,   And many a gallant, stayed perforce,                            80   Was fain to breathe his faltering horse,   And of the trackers of the deer,   Scarce half the lessening pack was near;   So shrewdly on the mountain side,   Had the bold burst their mettle tried.                          85   V    The noble stag was pausing now   Upon the mountain's southern brow,   Where broad extended, far beneath,   The varied realms of fair Menteith.   With anxious eye he wandered o'er                               90   Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,   And pondered refuge from his toil,   By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.   But nearer was the copsewood grey,   That waved and wept on Loch-Achray,                             95   And mingled with the pine-trees blue   On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.   Fresh vigor with the hope returned,   With flying foot the heath he spurned,   Held westward with unwearied race,                             100   And left behind the panting chase.   VI    'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,   As swept the hunt through Cambusmore;   What reins were tightened in despair,   When rose Benledi's ridge in air;                              105   Who flagged upon Bochastle's heath,   Who shunned to stem the flooded Teith--   For twice that day, from shore to shore,   The gallant stag swam stoutly o'er.   Few were the stragglers, following far,                        110   That reached the lake of Vennachar;   And when the Brigg of Turk was won,   The headmost horseman rode alone.   VII    Alone, but with unbated zeal,   That horseman plied the scourge and steel;                     115   For jaded now, and spent with toil,   Embossed with foam, and dark with soil,   While"]]]
