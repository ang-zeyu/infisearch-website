A writer in \"The Youth's Companion\" speaks very entertainingly of \"voices in trees.\" He says,--       \"Trees, when played upon by the wind, yield forth a variety      of tones. Mrs. Hemans once asked Sir Walter Scott if he had      noticed that every tree gives out its peculiar sound. 'Yes,'      said he, 'I have; and I think something might be done by the      union of poetry and music to imitate those voices, giving a      different measure to the oak, the pine, the willow, &c.' The      same journal from which we take this anecdote mentions, that      in Henry Taylor's drama, 'Edwin the Fair,' there are some      pleasing lines, where the wind is feigned to feel the want      of a voice, and to woo the trees to give him one.       \"He applied to several: but the wanderer rested with the      pine, because her voice was constant, soft, and lowly deep;      and he welcomed in her a wild memorial of the ocean-cave,      his birthplace. There is a fine description of a storm in      'Coningsby,' where a sylvan language is made to swell the      diapason of the tempest. 'The wind howled, the branches of      the forest stirred, and sent forth sounds like an      incantation. Soon might be distinguished the various voices      of the mighty trees, as they expressed their terror or their      agony. The oak roared, the beech shrieked, the elm sent      forth its long, deep groan; while ever and anon, amid a      momentary pause, the passion of the ash was heard in moans      of thrilling anguish.'\"  I shall close this chapter on the music of Nature by appending a beautiful reference to what has been called \"the music of the spheres.\" The lines form, as well, an elegant and elevated description of and tribute to music in general. I regret that the author's name cannot be given.       \"The Father spake: in grand reverberations        Through space rolled on the mighty music-tide;      While to its low, majestic modulations        The clouds of chaos slowly swept aside.       The Father spake: a dream, that had been lying        Hushed from eternity in silence there,      Heard the pure melody, and, low replying,        Grew to that music in the wondering air,--       Grew to that music, slowly, grandly waking,        Till, bathed in beauty, it became a world;      Led by his voice, its spheric pathway taking,        While glorious clouds their wings around it furled.       Not yet has ceased that sound, his love revealing;        Though, in response, a universe moves by:      Throughout eternity its echo pealing,        World after world awakes in glad reply.       And wheresoever in his rich creation        Sweet music breathes,--in wave, in bird, or soul,--      'Tis but the faint and far reverberation        Of that great tune to which the planets roll.\"     III.  A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.       \"Thespis, the first professor of our art,      At country wakes sang ballads from a cart.\"       DRYDEN.   Music is as old as the world itself. In some form or other, it has always existed. Ere man learned to give vent to his emotions in tuneful voice, Nature, animate and inanimate, under the hand of the Great Master, sang his praises. Of this we learn in the sacred writings; while all about us, in the songs of birds, the musical sighing of the winds, the fall of waters, and the many forms of the music of Nature, we have palpable evidence of its present existence, and assurances of its most remote antiquity.  It would seem that not long after \"God breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life, and he became a living soul,\" he learned to express the joys and yearnings of his soul in song first, and then with some sort of musical instrument. And to man it was given, commencing with the early ages, to develop the simple ejaculations or melodies of a praise-giving soul into a beautiful, a noble art, replete at times with harmonic intricacies, and again with melodies grand in their very simplicity; into a beneficent science, divine from its inception, which has ever had as votaries many of earth's greatest minds, and has become a fountain of delight to all mankind.  The history of the music of antiquity--that is, in an art-form--is nearly, if indeed not quite, enveloped in mystery; and it were futile to profess to give an historical presentation of an art from its birth, when documentary evidence of the same is lost.  We may, however, very reasonably suppose of music generally, that it must have been gradually developed, having had its infancy, childhood, and youth; and that it grew slowly into present scientific form with the advance of the centuries.  From all we can gather in regard to the early history of music as a system, it would appear that it had its infancy in ancient Greece; although it is supposed by some that the Grecian method was founded upon that of the still more ancient one of the Egyptians. Dr. Burgh, a learned musical writer states that, of \"the time before Christ, music was most cultivated and was most progressive in Greece.\" The verses of the Greek poet Homer, who was himself a musician, abound in beautiful allusions to and descriptions of this charming science; while in mythology are recounted the wonderful musical achievements of the god Orpheus, who is said to have been so skilled in music that the very rocks and trees followed in his wake of harmony.  The first artificial music of which the Bible speaks was that which was sung or played in praise of the Creator,--sacred music. In fact, this noble quality of the soul was very rarely called into exercise, save in the worship of the Deity, until many centuries had passed. Of music before the Christian era, both vocal and instrumental, the books of the Old Testament often speak. As to its exact character, we are left to conjecture, being, as before intimated, without materials from which to form a judgment; but, in some form or other, there was, during that period, abundance of what was called music.  The first mention of music, either vocal or instrumental, in the Scriptures, is made in Gen. iv. 21: \"Jubal was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.\" Jubal was only seventh in descent from Adam; and from this passage it is thought by some that he was the inventor of instrumental music. In the year B.C. 1739, in Gen. xxxi. 27, Laban says to Jacob, \"Wherefore didst thou flee away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp?\" This is the first mention in the Bible of vocal music. King David, who has been called \"the sweet singer of Israel,\" is said to have been a skilful performer on the harp. By his magical touch upon its strings at a certain time, he produced sounds so sweetly soothing as to drive away the \"evil spirit\" from Saul.  The poet Byron pays an elevated, glowing tribute to this \"monarch minstrel\" in the following lines:--       \"The harp the monarch minstrel swept,        The king of men, the loved of Heaven,      Which Music hallowed while she wept        O'er tones her heart of hearts had given,--        Redoubled be her tears; its chords are riven.       It softened men of iron mould;        It gave them virtues not their own:      No ear so dull, no soul so cold,        That felt not, fired not, to the tone;        Till David's lyre grew mightier than his throne.       It told the triumphs of our King;        It wafted glory to our God;      It made our gladdened valleys ring,        The cedars bow, the mountains nod:        Its sound aspired to heaven, and there abode.       Since then, though heard on earth no more,        Devotion, and her daughter Love,      Still bid the bursting spirit soar        To sounds that seem as from above,        In dreams that day's broad light cannot remove.\"  And here I append from the First of Chronicles, xiii. 8, a description of the music of the \"house of Israel:\" \"And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.\"  Josephus, the learned Jewish historian, states that the Egyptians had two hundred thousand musicians playing at the dedication of the Temple of Solomon. This structure was of most wonderfully immense dimensions: and it may have been that this enormous body of performers played in _detachments_ about the building; otherwise the statement would seem apocryphal.  The Egyptian musical instruments, it appears, were mostly of very rude construction: performance upon them would not now, probably, be tolerated even in circles of the least musical culture.  Of these ancient instruments the Boston \"Folio\" thus speaks:--       \"The Egyptian flute was only a cow's-horn, with three or      four holes in it; and their harp, or lyre, had only three      strings. The Grecian lyre had only seven strings, and was      very small, being held in one hand. The Jewish trumpets that      made the walls of Jericho fall down were only rams'-horns:      their flute was the same as the Egyptian. They had no other      instrumental music but by percussion, of which the greatest      boast was made of the psaltery,--a small triangular harp, or      lyre, with wire strings, and struck with an iron needle or      stick. Their sackbut was something like a bagpipe; the      timbrel was a tambourine; and the dulcimer, a horizontal      harp with wire strings, and struck with a stick like the      psaltery.\"  The following"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],["title","Music and Some Highly Musical People (#4)"],["body","and able summary of the history of ancient Roman music is taken from a recent number of \"The Vox Humana:\"--       \"Art love was not a distinguished characteristic of the      ancient Romans; and we are not astonished, therefore, to      find them borrowing music from Etruria, Greece, and Egypt;      originating nothing, and (although the study was pursued by      the emperors) never finding any thing higher in its practice      than a sensuous gratification.       \"In the earliest days of Rome, the inhabitants were      exclusively farmers or warriors; and their first temples      were raised to Ceres or to Mars.       \"The priests of Ceres came originally from Asia Minor, and      were called the Arval Brotherhood. Flute-playing was a      prominent feature in their rites, and they were all      proficient upon that instrument. Their number was limited to      twelve.       \"The worship of Mars was conducted by the Salian priests,      whom Numa summoned to Rome from Etruria. These also used the      flute as an accessory to their sacrificial rites. In these      primitive days of Rome, much was borrowed from the Etruscans      in style and instruments of music.       \"The earliest songs of Rome were in praise of Romulus, and      told the story of the twin-brothers and the divine origin of      the city. They were sung by choruses of boys. Similar songs      were sung during meals by the elders, with an accompaniment      of flutes; these latter songs being especially directed to      the young men, and inciting them to be worthy of the deeds      of their ancestors.       \"Under the rule of the emperors, all these worthy      compositions went to decay, and were replaced by a much more      degrading school of music. At no time, however, was music      considered a necessary part of the education of Roman youth.       \"There existed in the latter days of ancient Rome some      music-schools; but the study was far less universally      pursued than in Greece at the same epoch. The musical course      has been given by Quintilian as follows:--       \"Theoretical: first, arithmetic, physics; second, harmony,      rhythm, metrics.       \"Practical: composition, rhythm, melody, poetry.       \"Execution: playing instruments, singing, dramatic action;      which makes a rather formidable array, even to modern eyes.       \"Among the Roman musical instruments, the flute was the most      popular, and essentially national. We have already stated      that it was used in the worship of their two chief deities:      it was in secular use to a yet greater extent.       \"This flute (_tibia_) was hooped with brass bands, and had      an immense resonance. It was used by both sexes; but, on      public and on most religious occasions, was played by men.       \"The frequency with which it was used made the art of      playing it a most remunerative one; and the flute-players      soon formed themselves into a guild, or protective society.      This guild had many privileges accorded to it, and existed      for a period of some centuries. The 'Guild of Dionysian      Artists' was a society of later date, and was a musical      conservatory, academy, and agency, all in one. It flourished      greatly under the patronage of various Roman emperors, and      for a long time supplied singers and actors to the Roman      world.       \"Valerius Maximus has given an anecdote which shows how      powerful and exacting the guild of flute-players could      afford to be.       \"They were one day excluded from the Temple of Jupiter,      where they had been allowed, by ancient custom, to take      their meals; upon which the entire guild left Rome, and went      to the village of Tibur near by. This caused great      embarrassment: no religious services could be held, and      scarce any state ceremony properly conducted. The senate      thereupon sent an embassy to induce them to return,--in      vain: the angry musicians were inflexible. The wily      ambassadors then called the inhabitants of Tibur to their      aid, and these pretended to give a great feast to welcome      the flute-players. At this feast the musicians were all made      very drunk; and, while asleep from the effects of their      liquor, they were bundled into chariots, and driven back to      Rome, where all their old privileges were restored, and      newer and greater ones added.       \"They received the right to give public representations and      spectacles in Rome; but at these they were all masked, the      reason being their shame at the manner of their inglorious      return to the city.       \"Flutes were used at funerals; and it appears, at one time,      the luxury and pomp of Roman obsequies grew so excessive,      that a law was passed limiting the number of flute-players      on such occasions to ten.       \"Only at one time did the flute disappear from any public      worship, and that was when the worship of Bacchus was      introduced into Rome. To this rite the kithara was used; but      this worship, which was somewhat refined, though jovial,      among the Greeks, became among the Romans so debauched and      uxorious, that it was soon prohibited by law.       \"The flute was used in combination with other instruments at      times. Apuleius speaks of a concert of flutes, kitharas, and      chorus, and mentions its deliciously sweet effect. It was      also used as a pitch-pipe, to give orators a guide in      modulating their voices when addressing an assembly: thus      Caius Gracchus always on such occasions had a slave behind      him, whose duty it was to aid him to commence his orations      in a proper pitch, and when his voice sank too low, or      became too shrill, to call him to a better intonation by the      sounds of the flute.       \"Although the flute was the favorite Roman instrument, it      was by no means the only one. Trumpets were used to a great      extent. A one-toned trumpet, of very loud voice, was used      for battle-signals. These were of very large size, usually      of brass; and their sound is described as 'terrible.' There      was also a smaller (shepherd's) trumpet of mellower tone.       \"Another much-used instrument, of different character, was      the _sumphonium_, which did not differ materially from the      modern bagpipe.       \"Instruments of percussion were few, and not indigenous to      the Romans: such as were used came from the East, and were      chiefly used in the worship of Eastern deities at Rome. When      the worship of Bacchus was prohibited, they passed away with      that licentious rite. The most complicated instrument of      the ancient world appeared in Rome during the first century      of our era. It was an _organ_, not, as in the scriptural      days, a mere syrinx, or Pan's pipes, but an undoubted organ,      somewhat similar in effect to our modern instrument.       \"The instrument is said to have been invented by Ctesbius of      Alexandria in Egypt, who lived about 250 B.C. It did not      appear extensively in Rome, however, until nearly three      hundred years later. This organ has given rise to much      fruitless discussion. In the field of musical history      especially, 'a little' knowledge has proved 'a dangerous      thing;' for, where slight descriptions exist of instruments      of music, latitude is left for every writer to form his own      theory, to fight for it, and denunciate those who differ      from it.       \"We have seen what a battle was fought over the three little      manuscripts of Greek music; what a host of differing      opinions were held about the scriptural word 'Selah:' and      now, about this hydraulic organ, each writer mounts his      hobby-horse, and careers over the field of conjecture.      Vitruvius has given a full description of the instrument      from personal inspection; but as his technical terms have      lost all significance to modern readers, and have been      translated in various ways, and as his work contained no      diagrams or illustrations of the various parts, it is      useless.       \"Some writers imagine the organ to have had seven or eight      stops,--that is, so many different _kinds_ of tones,--which      would place them nearly on a par with our own. Others think      that they possessed seven or eight _keys_; that is, so many      _tones_ only. It has been a point of dispute as to what      function the water performed in working it. Vitruvius is      rather hazy on this point, saying only that it is      'suspended' in the instrument. The water, when the organ was      played, was in a state of agitation, as if boiling.       \"There are medals still in existence which were awarded to      victors in organ contests, on which this instrument is      represented with two boys blowing or pumping; but the      representation is too small to clear up any doubtful      points.\"  But, without devoting further space to the music that was in vogue prior to the Christian era, I proceed to notice that our first reliable account of it, as a system, commences with the fourth century; at which time St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, arranged the sacred chants that bear his name, and which were to be sung in the cathedrals.  In the year 600 St. Gregory improved upon these chants, inventing the scale of eight notes. His system is the basis of our modern music.  From the close of the eleventh to the commencement of the fourteenth century, minstrels, _jongleurs_, or troubadours, were the principal devotees of music. They seem to have been its custodians, so to speak; and to their guild many of the knights belonged. Some of the kings and nobles of the time were also, in a sense, troubadours; such as, for instance, Thibault of Navarre, and William the Ninth of Poitou.  These roving musicians, who generally united the qualities of the poet, the musical composer, and performer, were treated with much favor by princes and all "]]]
