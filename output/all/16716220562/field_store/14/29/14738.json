Overawed it hearkens solemn     To that sacred revelation     Mortal man hath poetry called.\"[5]  A story from the Midrash charmingly characterizes the relation between Halacha and Haggada. Two rabbis, Chiya bar Abba, a Halachist, and Abbahu, a Haggadist, happened to be lecturing in the same town. Abbahu, the Haggadist, was always listened to by great crowds, while Chiya, with his Halacha, stood practically deserted. The Haggadist comforted the disappointed teacher with a parable. \"Let us suppose two merchants,\" he said, \"to come to town, and offer wares for sale. The one has pearls and precious gems to display, the other, cheap finery, gilt chains, rings, and gaudy ribbons. About whose booth, think you, does the crowd press?--Formerly, when the struggle for existence was not fierce and inevitable, men had leisure and desire for the profound teachings of the Law; now they need the cheering words of consolation and hope.\"  For more than a thousand years this nameless spirit of national poesy was abroad, and produced manifold works, which, in the course of time, were gathered together into comprehensive collections, variously named Midrash Rabba, Pesikta, Tanchuma, etc. Their compilation was begun in about 700 C. E., that is, soon after the close of the Talmud, in the transition period from the third epoch of Jewish literature to the fourth, the golden age, which lasted from the ninth to the fifteenth century, and, according to the law of human products, shows a season of growth, blossom, and decay.  The scene of action during this period was western Asia, northern Africa, sometimes Italy and France, but chiefly Spain, where Arabic culture, destined to influence Jewish thought to an incalculable degree, was at that time at its zenith. \"A second time the Jews were drawn into the vortex of a foreign civilization, and two hundred years after Mohammed, Jews in Kairwan and Bagdad were speaking the same language, Arabic. A language once again became the mediatrix between Jewish and general literature, and the best minds of the two races, by means of the language, reciprocally influenced each other. Jews, as they once had written Greek for their brethren, now wrote Arabic; and, as in Hellenistic times, the civilization of the dominant race, both in its original features and in its adaptations from foreign sources, was reflected in that of the Jews.\" It would be interesting to analyze this important process of assimilation, but we can concern ourselves only with the works of the Jewish intellect. Again we meet, at the threshold of the period, a characteristic figure, the thinker Sa'adia, ranking high as author and religious philosopher, known also as a grammarian and a poet. He is followed by Sherira, to whom we owe the beginnings of a history of Talmudic literature, and his son Haï Gaon, a strictly orthodox teacher of the Law. In their wake come troops of physicians, theologians, lexicographers, Talmudists, and grammarians. Great is the circle of our national literature: it embraces theology, philosophy, exegesis, grammar, poetry, and jurisprudence, yea, even astronomy and chronology, mathematics and medicine. But these widely varying subjects constitute only one class, inasmuch as they all are infused with the spirit of Judaism, and subordinate themselves to its demands. A mention of the prominent actors would turn this whole essay into a dry list of names. Therefore it is better for us merely to sketch the period in outline, dwelling only on its greatest poets and philosophers, the moulders of its character.  The opinion is current that the Semitic race lacks the philosophic faculty. Yet it cannot be denied that Jews were the first to carry Greek philosophy to Europe, teaching and developing it there before its dissemination by celebrated Arabs. In their zeal to harmonize philosophy with their religion, and in the lesser endeavor to defend traditional Judaism against the polemic attacks of a new sect, the Karaites, they invested the Aristotelian system with peculiar features, making it, as it were, their national philosophy. At all events, it must be universally accepted that the Jews share with the Arabs the merit \"of having cherished the study of philosophy during centuries of barbarism, and of having for a long time exerted a civilizing influence upon Europe.\"  The meagre achievements of the Jews in the departments of history and history of literature do not justify the conclusion that they are wanting in historic perception. The lack of writings on these subjects is traceable to the sufferings and persecutions that have marked their pathway. Before their chroniclers had time to record past afflictions, new sorrows and troubles broke in upon them. In the middle ages, the history of Jewish literature is the entire history of the Jewish people, its course outlined by blood and watered by rivers of tears, at whose source the genius of Jewish poetry sits lamenting. \"The Orient dwells an exile in the Occident,\" Franz Delitzsch, the first alien to give loving study to this literature, poetically says, \"and its tears of longing for home are the fountain-head of Jewish poetry.\"[6]  That poetry reached its perfection in the works of the celebrated trio, Solomon Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, and Moses ben Ezra. Their dazzling triumphs had been heralded by the more modest achievements of Abitur, writing Hebrew, and Adia and the poetess Xemona (Kasmune) using Arabic, to sing the praise of God and lament the woes of Israel.  The predominant, but not exclusive, characteristic of Jewish poetry is its religious strain. Great thinkers, men equipped with philosophic training, and at the same time endowed with poetic gifts, have contributed to the huge volume of synagogue poetry, whose subjects are praise of the Lord and regret for Zion. The sorrow for our lost fatherland has never taken on more glowing colors, never been expressed in fuller tones than in this poetry. As ancient Hebrew poetry flowed in the two streams of prophecy and psalmody, so the Jewish poetry of the middle ages was divided into _Piut_ and _Selicha_. Songs of hope and despair, cries of revenge, exhortations to peace among men, elegies on every single persecution, and laments for Zion, follow each other in kaleidoscopic succession. Unfortunately, there never was lack of historic matter for this poetry to elaborate. To furnish that was the well-accomplished task of rulers and priests in the middle ages, alike \"in the realm of the Islamic king of kings and in that of the apostolic servant of servants.\" So fate made this poetry classical and eminently national. Those characteristics which, in general literature, earn for a work the description \"Homeric,\" in Jewish literature make a liturgical poem \"Kaliric,\" so called from the poet Eliezer Kalir, the subject of many mythical tales, and the first of a long line of poets, Spanish, French, and German, extending to the sixteenth or seventeenth century. The literary history of this epoch has been written by Leopold Zunz with warmth of feeling and stupendous learning. He closes his work with the hope that mankind, at some future day, will adopt Israel's religious poetry as its own, transforming the elegiac _Selicha_ into a joyous psalm of universal peace and good-will.  Side by side with religious flourishes secular poetry, clothing itself in rhyme and metre, adopting every current form of poesy, and treating of every appropriate subject. Its first votary was Solomon Gabirol, that      \"Human nightingale that warbled     Forth her songs of tender love,     In the darkness of the sombre,     Gothic mediæval night.      She, that nightingale, sang only,     Sobbing forth her adoration,     To her Lord, her God, in heaven,     Whom her songs of praise extolled.\"[7]  Solomon Gabirol may be said to have been the first poet thrilled by _Weltschmerz_. \"He produced hymns and songs, penitential prayers, psalms, and threnodies, filled with hope and longing for a blessed future. They are marked throughout by austere earnestness, brushing away, in its rigor, the color and bloom of life; but side by side with it, surging forth from the deepest recesses of a human soul, is humble adoration of God.\"  Gabirol was a distinguished philosopher besides. In 1150, his chief work, \"The Fount of Life,\" was translated into Latin by Archdeacon Dominicus Gundisalvi, with the help of Johannes Avendeath, an apostate Jew, the author's name being corrupted into Avencebrol, later becoming Avicebron. The work was made a text-book of scholastic philosophy, but neither Scotists nor Thomists, neither adherents nor detractors, suspected that a heretical Jew was slumbering under the name Avicebron. It remained for an inquirer of our own day, Solomon Munk, to reveal the face of Gabirol under the mask of a garbled name. Amazed, we behold that the pessimistic philosopher of to-day can as little as the schoolmen of the middle ages shake himself free from the despised Jew. Schopenhauer may object as he will, it is certain that Gabirol was his predecessor by more than eight hundred years!  Charisi, whom we shall presently meet, has expressed the verdict on his poetry which still holds good: \"Solomon Gabirol pleases to call himself the small--yet before him all the great must dwindle and fall.--Who can like him with mighty speech appall?--Compared with him the poets of his time are without power--he, the small, alone is a tower.--The highest round of poetry's ladder has he won.--Wisdom fondled him, eloquence hath called him son--and clothing him with purple, said: 'Lo!--my first-born son, go forth, to conquest go!'--His predecessors' songs are naught with his compared--nor have his many followers better fared.--The later singers by him were taught--the heirs they are of his poetic thought.--But still he's king, to him all praise belongs--for Solomon's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27901"],["title","Jewish Literature and Other Essays (#3)"],["body"," is the Song of Songs.\"  By Gabirol's side stands Yehuda Halevi, probably the only Jewish poet known to the reader of general literature, to whom his name, life, and fate have become familiar through Heinrich Heine's _Romanzero_. His magnificent descriptions of nature \"reflect southern skies, verdant meadows, deep blue rivers, and the stormy sea,\" and his erotic lyrics are chaste and tender. He sounds the praise of wine, youth, and happiness, and extols the charms of his lady-love, but above and beyond all he devotes his song to Zion and his people. The pearl of his poems      \"Is the famous lamentation     Sung in all the tents of Jacob,     Scattered wide upon the earth ...      Yea, it is the song of Zion,     Which Yehuda ben Halevy,     Dying on the holy ruins,     Sang of loved Jerusalem.\"[8]  \"In the whole compass of religious poetry, Milton's and Klopstock's not excepted, nothing can be found to surpass the elegy of Zion,\" says a modern writer, a non-Jew.[9] This soul-stirring \"Lay of Zion,\" better than any number of critical dissertations, will give the reader a clear insight into the character and spirit of Jewish poetry in general:      O Zion! of thine exiles' peace take thought,     The remnant of thy flock, who thine have sought!     From west, from east, from north and south resounds,     Afar and now anear, from all thy bounds,               And no surcease,               \"With thee be peace!\"      In longing's fetters chained I greet thee, too,     My tears fast welling forth like Hermon's dew--     O bliss could they but drop on holy hills!     A croaking bird I turn, when through me thrills     Thy desolate state; but when I dream anon,     The Lord brings back thy ev'ry captive son--               A harp straightway               To sing thy lay.      In heart I dwell where once thy purest son     At Bethel and Peniel, triumphs won;     God's awesome presence there was close to thee,     Whose doors thy Maker, by divine decree,           Opposed as mates           To heaven's gates.      Nor sun, nor moon, nor stars had need to be;     God's countenance alone illumined thee     On whose elect He poured his spirit out.     In thee would I my soul pour forth devout!     Thou wert the kingdom's seat, of God the throne,     And now there dwells a slave race, not thine own,           In royal state,           Where reigned thy great.      O would that I could roam o'er ev'ry place     Where God to missioned prophets showed His grace!     And who will give me wings? An off'ring meet,     I'd haste to lay upon thy shattered seat,           Thy counterpart--           My bruisèd heart.      Upon thy precious ground I'd fall prostrate,     Thy stones caress, the dust within thy gate,     And happiness it were in awe to stand     At Hebron's graves, the treasures of thy land,     And greet thy woods, thy vine-clad slopes, thy vales,     Greet Abarim and Hor, whose light ne'er pales,           A radiant crown,           Thy priests' renown.      Thy air is balm for souls; like myrrh thy sand;     With honey run the rivers of thy land.     Though bare my feet, my heart's delight I'd count     To thread my way all o'er thy desert mount,           Where once rose tall           Thy holy hall,      Where stood thy treasure-ark, in recess dim,     Close-curtained, guarded o'er by cherubim.     My Naz'rite's crown would I pluck off, and cast     It gladly forth. With curses would I blast     The impious time thy people, diadem-crowned,     Thy Nazirites, did pass, by en'mies bound           With hatred's bands,           In unclean lands.      By dogs thy lusty lions are brutal torn     And dragged; thy strong, young eaglets, heav'nward     borne,     By foul-mouthed ravens snatched, and all undone.     Can food still tempt my taste? Can light of sun           Seem fair to shine           To eyes like mine?      Soft, soft! Leave off a while, O cup of pain!     My loins are weighted down, my heart and brain,     With bitterness from thee. Whene'er I think     Of Oholah,[10] proud northern queen, I drink     Thy wrath, and when my Oholivah forlorn     Comes back to mind--'tis then I quaff thy scorn,           Then, draught of pain,           Thy lees I drain.      O Zion! Crown of grace! Thy comeliness     Hath ever favor won and fond caress.     Thy faithful lovers' lives are bound in thine;     They joy in thy security, but pine           And weep in gloom           O'er thy sad doom.      From out the prisoner's cell they sigh for thee,     And each in prayer, wherever he may be,     Towards thy demolished portals turns. Exiled,     Dispersed from mount to hill, thy flock defiled     Hath not forgot thy sheltering fold. They grasp     Thy garment's hem, and trustful, eager, clasp,               With outstretched arms,               Thy branching palms.      Shinar, Pathros--can they in majesty     With thee compare? Or their idolatry     With thy Urim and thy Thummim august?     Who can surpass thy priests, thy saintly just,               Thy prophets bold,               And bards of old?      The heathen kingdoms change and wholly cease--     Thy might alone stands firm without decrease,     Thy Nazirites from age to age abide,     Thy God in thee desireth to reside.     Then happy he who maketh choice of thee     To dwell within thy courts, and waits to see,               And toils to make,               Thy light awake.      On him shall as the morning break thy light,     The bliss of thy elect shall glad his sight,     In thy felicities shall he rejoice,     In triumph sweet exult, with jubilant voice,               O'er thee, adored,               To youth restored.  We have loitered long with Yehuda Halevi, and still not long enough, for we have not yet spoken of his claims to the title philosopher, won for him by his book _Al-Chazari_. But now we must hurry on to Moses ben Ezra, the last and most worldly of the three great poets. He devotes his genius to his patrons, to wine, his faithless mistress, and to \"bacchanalian feasts under leafy canopies, with merry minstrelsy of birds.\" He laments over separation from friends and kin, weeps over the shortness of life and the rapid approach of hoary age--all in polished language, sometimes, however, lacking euphony. Even when he strikes his lyre in praise and honor of his people Israel, he fails to rise to the lofty heights attained by his mates in song.  With Yehuda Charisi, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, the period of the epigones sets in for Spanish-Jewish literature. In Charisi's _Tachkemoni_, an imitation of the poetry of the Arab Hariri, jest and serious criticism, joy and grief, the sublime and the trivial, follow each other like tints in a parti-colored skein. His distinction is the ease with which he plays upon the Hebrew language, not the most pliable of instruments. In general, Jewish poets and philosophers have manipulated that language with surprising dexterity. Songs, hymns, elegies, penitential prayers, exhortations, and religious meditations, generation after generation, were couched in the idiom of the psalmist, yet the structure of the language underwent no change. \"The development of the neo-Hebraic idiom from the ancient Hebrew,\" a distinguished modern ethnographer justly says, \"confirms, by linguistic evidence, the plasticity, the logical acumen, the comprehensive and at the same time versatile intellectuality of the Jewish race. By the ingenious compounding of words, by investing old expressions with new meanings, and adapting the material offered by alien or related languages to its own purposes, it has increased and enriched a comparatively meagre treasury of words.\"[11]  Side by side with this cosmopolitanism, illustrated in the Haggada, whose pages prove that nothing human is strange to the Jewish race, it reveals, in its literary development, as notably in the Halacha, a sharply defined subjectivity. Jellinek says: \"Not losing itself in the contemplation of the phenomena of life, not devoting itself to any subject unless it be with an ulterior purpose, but seeing all things in their relation to itself, and subordinating them to its own boldly asserted _ego_, the Jewish race is not inclined to apply its powers to the solution of intricate philosophic problems, or to abstruse metaphysical speculations. It is, therefore, not a philosophic race, and its participation in the philosophic work of the world dates only from its contact with the Greeks.\" The same author, on the other hand, emphasizes the liberality, the broad sympathies, of the Jewish race, in his statement that the Jewish mind, at its first meeting with Arabic philosophy, absorbed it as a leaven into its intellectual life. The product of the assimilation was--as early as the twelfth century, mark you--a philosophic conception of life, whose broad liberality culminates in the sentiment expressed by two most eminent thinkers: Christianity and Islam are the precursors of a world-religion, the preliminary conditions for the great religious system satisfying all men. Yehuda Halevi and Moses Maimonides were the philosophers bold enough to utter this thought of far-reaching significance.  The second efflorescence of Jewish poetry brings forth exotic romances, satires, verbose hymns, and humorous narrative poems. Such productions certainly do not justify the application of the epithet \"theological\" to Jewish literature. Solomon ben Sakbel composes a satiric romance in the Makamat[12] form, describing the varied adventures of Asher ben Yehuda, another Don Quixote; Berachya Hanakdan puts into Hebrew the fables of Æsop and Lokman, furnishing La Fontaine with some of his material; Abraham ibn Sahl receives from the Arabs, certainly not noted for liberality, ten goldpieces for each of his love-songs; Santob de Carrion is a beloved Spanish bard, bold enough to tell unpleasant truths unto a king; Joseph ibn Sabara writes a humorous romance; Yehuda Sabbataï, epic satires,"]]]
