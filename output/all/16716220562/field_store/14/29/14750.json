On the open plain beyond some antelopes were seen grazing, and Hendrik and Arend went after them for the purpose of providing Macora's people with food.  Groot Willem, on the other hand, preferred going towards the timber, where he had been told there was larger game; and, accompanied by Macora and four attendants, he started off, leaving Hans with Swartboy and Congo to take care of the pack-horses and other _impedimenta_, as also to superintend the building of the kraal.  Not far from the river-bank, Macora, with Willem, entered a dense forest standing in a tract of low marshy ground.  They had not gone far, before coming within sight of some reet boks (reed bucks, _Antelope eleotragus_, Schreber).  These were not more than three hundred yards away; and, from the unconcerned manner in which they continued their occupation, Groot Willem saw that they had never been hunted by men carrying fire-arms, although so near to a village of the Makololo.  The innocent creatures were unworthy of a shot from his roer, and he passed on without molesting them.  He was soon upon a path that showed signs of being nightly trodden by large animals, on their way to the water.  Amongst other spoor, he was pleased to observe that of the hippopotamus.  Several of these animals had evidently left the river only two or three hours before, and were then probably grazing in the neighbourhood.  They had been so little disturbed by man, that, contrary to their usual custom, they came out upon the land to browse by day.  Willem was satisfied that they had reached a place where they would be content to stop for a while; and, without proceeding any farther, he resolved to commence business by bringing down one of two buffaloes he saw lying at some distance off, under the shade of a clump of trees.  Leaving Macora and his men in care of his horse and three dogs which he had brought with him, he passed to the leeward of the game, trying to get between the buffaloes and the forest, to head them off in case of their retreating to the cover.  Willem was too much of a sportsman to think of stalking upon the buffaloes, and shooting at them while asleep; and after gaining the desired station, he whistled for his dogs, for the purpose of giving the buffaloes a bit of a chase, and trying a shot at them while on the run. His signal was scarce given, when he heard loud yells from the natives and the report of Macora's musket.  Something had gone wrong; for he saw that his own horse was loose and galloping over the plain, while the natives were scampering in different directions, evidently under the inspiration of fear.  The ox upon which Macora sat seemed trying its speed with his horse. The three dogs had answered his call and were coming towards him.  They were pursued by something,--by a creature that passed over the ground in a succession of long low leaps, and yet so much time was lost in gathering strength for each spring, that it did not much lessen the distance between itself and the animals it was pursuing.  The buffaloes had started up and gone off at full canter towards the timber,--passing within less than fifty paces of the spot where Willem stood.  He allowed them to escape unmolested.  A creature more deserving of his attention was rapidly approaching from the other side.    CHAPTER THIRTEEN.  THE FAITHFUL \"SMOKE.\"  As yet, the dogs did not seem aware that an enemy was after them.  They had heard their master's whistle, and having been released from the leash, were only intent in obeying the command.  On rousing the buffaloes from their repose, they probably thought that they had been called for the express purpose of pursuing and destroying them; and, heedless of all else, they followed upon the heels of the great quadrupeds, passing close to the hunter, who in vain endeavoured to call them off.  He was soon otherwise occupied.  The creature in pursuit of the dogs, and which had caused the flight of Macora and his attendants, was a large leopard.  It was a female, and rapidly there passed through the hunter's mind a conjecture of the circumstances under which the animal was acting.  It had left its young in its forest lair, and had been on a visit to the river for water or food.  It had not pursued Macora or his attendants, as its solicitude was for its young, and the dogs were now running in the direction where these were concealed.  At sight of Groot Willem, the leopard desisted from its pursuit of the dogs; and, crouching low upon the ground, crawled towards him,--not slowly, but with a speed only checked by instinctive caution.  As it advanced, its whole body was covered by the head, its eyes being the highest part of it presented to the view of the hunter.  The _felidea_ was now within ten yards of him and rapidly drawing nearer.  Something must be done.  The roer was raised to his shoulder, and with a steady hand and eye,--nerved by the perilous position he was in,--he drew a fine sight at the creature's snout and fired.  The shot took effect, for the leopard rolled over, rose up, turned around two or three times, and for a while seemed to have lost all consciousness of what had transpired.  Its young and its enemy were for a time apparently forgotten in the agony it was suffering from a broken jaw.  This, however, was but for a few seconds, for the sight of the hunter soon after aroused it to a perfect realisation of all that had taken place.  Willem, after firing, had run off to about fifty paces, and then stopped to reload.  While so engaged he kept his eye fixed upon the leopard.  It was again coming towards him, no longer with the caution it had before exhibited, but in a manner that showed its whole animal nature was absorbed by the spirit of revenge.  By the time he had placed the bullet in the barrel of his gun and driven it home, the brute was close upon him.  There was not time for him to withdraw the ramrod, much less to put on a cap.  Grasping his roer by the barrel, he prepared to defend himself, intending to use the weapon as a club.  The enraged creature was about to make a spring upon him, when assistance came from a quarter altogether unexpected.  One of the dogs--a large bull-dog called \"Smoke\"--had not followed the buffaloes to cover.  It had obeyed its master's command when called back from the chase.  Just as the leopard was crouching upon the earth to gather force for the final spring, Smoke seized it by one of the hind legs.  Not a second of time was lost by Willem.  One more chance for life had been thus given him, and he hastened to avail himself of it.  The hammer of the lock was thrown back and a cap placed on the nipple in less time than nine out of ten well-drilled soldiers could have performed the same feat; but by the time it was done, and the gun brought to his shoulder, poor Smoke was lying in his death-struggle along the grass.  The _felidea_ had turned to renew the attack on its human enemy.  One second more, and its huge body would have been launched against him,-- its sharp claws buried in his flesh.  He pulled trigger and sprang backwards.  A cloud of smoke rolled before his eyes, and, as this cleared away, he saw the leopard laid out along the earth by the side of the wounded dog,--like the latter, kicking out its legs in the last throes of death.  On looking for his companions, Willem saw that Macora and his men, having stopped at a distance of about five hundred yards off, had witnessed his victory.  The chief was now hastening towards him on foot, and was soon by his side, when, pointing to the ox about half a mile away, he tried to make Willem understand that that animal had carried him unwillingly away from his friend.  Perceiving all danger was over, the others came up; when, by signs, the big hunter gave them to understand that he wanted the hide taken off the leopard.  The four attendants went to work with their short assagais, in a manner that told him he would not have long to wait for a beautiful leopard skin, as a trophy of his victory, as also a memento of the danger through which he had passed.  He himself turned his attention to the wounded dog, which was still moaning on the ground, and looking at him with an expression that seemed to say, \"Why do you not first come and assist me.\"  Poor Smoke had sacrificed his own life to save that of his master.  The creature's back was broken, and it was otherwise severely injured.  It was evident that nothing could be done for it.  The dog must die, and the great heart of Groot Willem was sorely afflicted.  Turning to Macora, he observed that the chief had reloaded his musket. Willem pointed to the dog's head and then to the gun.  The chief took the hint and raised the weapon to his shoulder.  Groot Willem turned away with his eyes full of tears, and went off in pursuit of his horse.    CHAPTER FOURTEEN.  THE LAGOON.  On returning to the camp, they found that Hendrik and Arend had been successful in their chase of the antelopes, and the greater part of two were cooking over a large fire.  A quantity of felled timber had been brought to the ground for construction of the kraal, and the work of building it had already commenced.  For the labour of his followers Macora would accept nothing but a small quantity of coffee, a bottle of Schiedam and some tobacco, and in the evening he took his departure, after seeing his friends safely established in their camp.  Three of his people were left with the hunters, with orders to make themselves useful in whatever way they could be employed.  This addition to the company was, however, a source of great annoyance to the Bushman. Any communication made to them required the assistance of his rival, Congo.  Congo had others under him,--people to whom he gave instructions and commands.  Swartboy had not, and was, therefore, very discontented with the arrangements.  \"You and I must do something to-day,\" said Arend to Hendrik, as they were eating their first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],["title","Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

The wild ponds are very apt to be shallow and muddy, with low, marshy shores; but this one was deep and clear, and its high banks were clothed with a splendid growth of beech, maple and birch. Tall elms stood guard along the water's edge, and here and there the hardwood forest was broken by dark hemlock groves, and groups of lordly pine-trees, lifting their great green heads high above their deciduous neighbors. Only in one place, around the extreme eastern end, the ground was flat and wet; and there the tamarack swamp showed golden yellow in October, and light, delicate green in late spring. Wild morning-glories grew on the grassy point that put out from the northern shore, and in the bays the white water-lilies were blossoming. Nearly two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, it lay basking and shimmering in the sunshine, a big, broad, beautiful sheet of water set down in the very heart of the woods._  _There were no settlers anywhere near, nor even any Indians, yet there was no lack of inhabitants. Bears and wolves and a host of smaller animals were to be found, and along the shores were runways that had been worn deep in the soil by the tread of generation after generation of dainty little cloven hoofs. I suppose that some of those paths have been used by the deer for hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of years._  _The lands around the entire lake were offered for sale by the United States Government at the ridiculously low price which Uncle Sam has asked for most of his possessions; and with the help of some friends my father bought the whole shore. During the years which followed he was occupied in various ways, and some of the best recollections of my boyhood are of the days and the nights which I spent with him on his fishing-tug, steaming about the Straits of Mackinac and the northern part of Lake Huron. But he could not forget the Glimmerglass, that little wild lake up in the woods. He had fallen in love with it at first sight, and at last he took his family and went there to live._  _Human neighbors were scarce around the lake, and perhaps that was one reason why we took such a lively interest in the other residents--those who were there ahead of us. \"Him and me's chums,\" my small sister said of the red-squirrel that hung around the log-barn. And some of the animals seemed to take a very lively interest in us. The chipmunks came into the house occasionally, on foraging expeditions; and so, I regret to say, did the skunks. There was a woodchuck who used to come to the back door, looking for scraps, and who learned to sit bolt upright and hold a pancake in his fore paws while he nibbled at it, without being in the least disturbed by the presence and the comments of half a dozen spectators. The porcupines became a never-ending nuisance, for they made almost nightly visits to the woodshed. To kill them was of little use, for the next night--or perhaps before morning--there were others to take their places. Once in a while one of them would climb up onto the roof of the house; and between his teeth and his feet and the rattling of his quills on the shingles, the racket that he made was out of all proportion to his size._            It is sweet to lie at evening in your little trundle-bed,           And to listen to a porky gnawing shingles overhead;             Porky, porky, porky, porky;             Gnawing shingles overhead.  _The wolves had been pretty nearly exterminated since my father's first visit to the lake, and we saw little or nothing of them. The bears seemed to be more numerous, but they were very shy and retiring. We found their tracks more often than we came upon the animals themselves. Some of the cat tribe remained, and occasionally placed themselves in evidence. My brother came in one day from a long tramp on snow-shoes, and told how he had met one of them standing guard over the remains of a deer, and how the lynx had held him up and made him go around. Beavers were getting scarce, though a few were still left on the more secluded streams. Deer, on the contrary, were very plentiful. Many a time they invaded our garden-patch and helped themselves to our fresh vegetables._  _One August afternoon a flock of eight young partridges, of that spring's hatching, coolly marched out of the woods and into the clearing, as if they were bent on investigating their new neighbors. Partridges appear to be subject to occasional fits of stupidity, and to temporary (or possibly permanent) loss of common-sense; but it may be that in this case the birds were too young and inexperienced to realize what they were doing. Or perhaps they knew that it was Sunday, and that the rules of the household forbade shooting on that day. If so, their confidence was sadly misplaced. We didn't shoot them, but we did surround them, and by working carefully and cautiously we \"shooed\" them into an empty log-house. And the next day we had them for dinner._  _Around the shores of the Glimmerglass a few loons and wild-ducks usually nested, and in the autumn the large flocks from the Far North often stopped there for short visits, on their way south for the winter. They were more sociable than you would suppose--or at least the loons were--and the same small girl who had made friends with the red-squirrel learned to talk to the big birds._  _Down in the water the herring and a large species of salmon trout made their homes, and probably enjoyed themselves till they met with the gill-net and the trolling-hook. But herring and salmon trout did not satisfy us; we wanted brook trout, too. And so one day a shipment of babies arrived from the hatchery at Sault Ste. Marie, and thus we first became acquainted with the habits of infant fishes, and learned something of their needs and the methods of their foster-parents._  _One after another our neighbors introduced themselves, each in his own way. And they were good neighbors, all of them. Even the porcupines and the skunks were interesting--in their peculiar fashion--and I wish there were none worse than they in the city's slums._  _I have said good-by to the Glimmerglass, and it may be that I shall never again make my home by its shores. But the life of the woods goes on, and will still go on as long as man will let it. I suppose that, even as I write, the bears are \"holeing up\" for the winter, and the deer are growing anxious because the snow is covering the best of their food, and they of the cat tribe are getting down to business, and hunting in deadly earnest. The loons and the ducks have pulled out for the Gulf of Mexico, and the squirrels are glad that they have such a goodly store of nuts laid up for the next four months. The beavers have retired to their lodges--that is, if Charley Roop and his fellows have left any of them alive. The partridges--well, the partridges will just have to get along the best way they can. I guess they'll pull through somehow. The porcupines are all right, as you will presently see if you read this book. They don't have to worry. Down in the bed of the trout stream "]]]
