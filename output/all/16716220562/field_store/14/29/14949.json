This girl was the direct opposite in every way. She was the product of survival on Pyrrus. The heavy gravity that produced bulging muscles in men, brought out firm strength in straplike female muscles. She had the figure of a goddess, tanned skin and perfectly formed face. Her hair, which was cut short, circled her head like a golden crown. The only unfeminine thing about her was the gun she wore in a bulky forearm holster. When she saw Jason's eyes open she smiled at him. Her teeth were as even and as white as he had expected.  \"I'm Meta, pilot of this ship. And you must be--\"  \"Jason dinAlt. That was a lousy take-off, Meta.\"  \"I'm really very sorry,\" she laughed. \"But being born on a two-G planet does make one a little immune to acceleration. I save fuel too, with the synergy curve--\"  Kerk gave a noncommittal grunt. \"Come along, Meta, we'll take a look at the cargo. Some of the new stuff will plug the gaps in the perimeter.\"  \"Oh yes,\" she said, almost clapping her hands with happiness. \"I read the specs, they're simply wonderful.\"  _Like a schoolgirl with a new dress. Or a box of candy. That's a great attitude to have towards bombs and flame-throwers._ Jason smiled wryly at the thought as he groaned off the couch. The two Pyrrans had gone and he pulled himself painfully through the door after them.         *       *       *       *       *  It took him a long time to find his way to the hold. The ship was big and apparently empty of crew. Jason finally found a man sleeping in one of the brightly lit cabins. He recognized him as the driver who had turned the car over to them on Cassylia. The man, who had been sleeping soundly a moment before, opened his eyes as soon as Jason drifted into the room. He was wide awake.  \"How do I get to the cargo hold?\" Jason asked.  The other told him, closed his eyes and went instantly back to sleep before Jason could even say thanks.  In the hold, Kerk and Meta had opened some of the crates and were chortling with joy over their lethal contents. Meta, a pressure canister in her arms, turned to Jason as he came through the door.  \"Just look at this,\" she said. \"This powder in here--why you can eat it like dirt, with less harm. Yet it is instantly deadly to all forms of vegetable life ...\" She stopped suddenly as she realized Jason didn't share her extreme pleasure. \"I'm sorry. I forgot for a moment there that you weren't a Pyrran. So you don't really understand, do you?\"  Before he could answer, the PA speaker called her name.  \"Jump time,\" she said. \"Come with me to the bridge while I do the equations. We can talk there. I know so little about any place except Pyrrus that I have a million questions to ask.\"  Jason followed her to the bridge where she relieved the duty officer and began taking readings for the jump-setting. She looked out of place among the machines, a sturdy but supple figure in a simple, one-piece shipsuit. Yet there was no denying the efficiency with which she went about her job.  \"Meta, aren't you a little young to be the pilot of an interstellar ship?\"  \"Am I?\" She thought for a second. \"I really don't know how old pilots are supposed to be. I have been piloting for about three years now and I'm almost twenty. Is that younger than usual?\"  Jason opened his mouth--then laughed. \"I suppose that all depends on what planet you're from. Some places you would have trouble getting licensed. But I'll bet things are different on Pyrrus. By their standards you must rank as an old lady.\"  \"Now you're making a joke,\" Meta said serenely as she fed a figure into the calculator. \"I've seen old ladies on some planets. They are wrinkled and have gray hair. I don't know how old they are, I asked one but she wouldn't tell me her age. But I'm sure they must be older than anyone on Pyrrus, no one looks like that there.\"  \"I don't mean old that way,\" Jason groped for the right word. \"Not old--but grown-up, mature. An adult.\"  \"Everyone is grown-up,\" she answered. \"At least soon after they leave the wards. And they do that when they're six. My first child is grown-up, and the second one would be, too, only he's dead. So I _surely_ must be.\"  That seemed to settle the question for her, though Jason's thoughts jumped with the alien concepts and background, inherent behind her words.         *       *       *       *       *  Meta punched in the last setting, and the course tape began to chunk out of the case. She turned her attention back to Jason. \"I'm glad you're aboard this trip, though I am sorry you are going to Pyrrus. But we'll have lots of time to talk. There are so many things I want to find out about other planets, and why people go around acting the way they do. Not at all like home where you _know_ why people are doing things all the time.\" She frowned over the tape for a moment, then turned her attention back to Jason. \"What is your home planet like?\"  One after another the usual lies he told people came to his lips, and were pushed away. Why bother lying to a girl who really didn't care if you were serf or noble? To her there were only two kinds of people in the galaxy--Pyrrans, and the rest. For the first time since he had fled from Porgorstorsaand he found himself telling someone the truth of his origin.  \"My home planet? Just about the stuffiest, dullest, dead-end in the universe. You can't believe the destructive decay of a planet that is mainly agrarian, caste-conscious and completely satisfied with its own boring existence. Not only is there no change--but no one _wants_ change. My father was a farmer, so I should have been a farmer too--if I had listened to the advice of my betters. It was unthinkable, as well as forbidden for me to do anything else. And everything I wanted to do was against the law. I was fifteen before I learned to read--out of a book stolen from a noble school. After that there was no turning back. By the time I stowed aboard an off-world freighter at nineteen I must have broken every law on the planet. Happily. Leaving home for me was just like getting out of prison.\"  Meta shook her head at the thought. \"I just can't imagine a place like that. But I'm sure I wouldn't like it there.\"  \"I'm sure you wouldn't,\" Jason laughed. \"So once I was in space, with no law-abiding talents or skills, I just wandered into one thing and another. In this age of technology I was completely out of place. Oh, I suppose I could have done well in some army, but I'm not so good at taking orders. Whenever I gambled I did well, so little by little I just drifted into it. People are the same everywhere, so I manage to make out well wherever I end up.\"  \"I know what you mean about people being alike--but they are so _different_,\" she said. \"I'm not being clear at all, am I? What I mean is that at home I know what people will do and why they do it at the same time. People on all the other planets do act alike, as you said, yet I have very much trouble understanding why. For instance, I like to try the local food when we set down on a planet, and if there is time I always do. There are bars and restaurants near every spaceport so I go there. And I always have trouble with the men. They want to buy me drinks, hold my hand--\"  \"Well, a single girl in those port joints has to expect a certain amount of interest from the men.\"  \"Oh, I know that,\" she said. \"What I don't understand is why they don't listen when I tell them I am not interested and to go away. They just laugh and pull up a chair, usually. But I have found that one thing works wherever I am. I tell them if they don't stop bothering me I'll break their arm.\"  \"Does that stop them?\" Jason asked.  \"No, of course not. But after I break their arm they go away. And the others don't bother me either. It's a lot of fuss to go through and the food is usually awful.\"  Jason didn't laugh. Particularly when he realized that this girl _could_ break the arm of any spaceport thug in the galaxy. She was a strange mixture of naivete and strength, unlike anyone he had ever met before. Once again he realized that he _had_ to visit the planet that produced people like her and Kerk.  \"Tell me about Pyrrus,\" he asked. \"Why is it that you and Kerk assume automatically that I will drop dead as soon as I land? What is the planet like?\"  All the warmth was gone from her face now. \"I can't tell you. You will have to see for yourself. I know that much after visiting some of the other worlds. Pyrrus is like nothing you galaxy people have ever experienced. You won't really believe it until it is too late. Will you promise me something?\"  \"No,\" he answered. \"At least not until after I hear what it is and decide.\"  \"Don't leave the ship when we land. You _should_ be safe enough aboard, and I'll be flying a cargo out within a few weeks.\"  \"I'll promise nothing of the sort. I'll leave when I want to leave.\" Jason knew there was logic in her words, but his back was up at her automatic superiority.  Meta finished the jump settings without another word. There was a tension in the room that prevented them both from talking.  It was the next shipday before he saw her again, then it was completely by accident. She was in the astrogation dome when he entered, looking up at the sparkling immensity of the jump sky. For the first time he saw her off duty, wearing something other than a shipsuit. This was a loose, soft robe that accentuated her beauty.  She smiled at him. \"The stars are so wonderful,\" she said. \"Come look.\" Jason came close to her and with an unthinking, almost automatic movement, put his arm around her. Neither did she resent it, for she covered his hand with hers. Then they kissed and it was just the way he knew it would be.     VI.   After that they were together constantly. When Meta was on duty he brought her meals to the bridge and they talked. Jason learned little more about her world since, by unspoken agreement, they didn't discuss it."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],["title","Deathworld (#6)"],["body"," talked of the many planets he had visited and the people he had known. She was an appreciative listener and the time went quickly by. They enjoyed each other's company and it was a wonderful trip.  Then it ended.  There were fourteen people aboard the ship, yet Jason had never seen more than two or three at a time. There was a fixed rotation of duties that they followed in the ship's operation. When not on duty the Pyrrans minded their own business in an intense and self-sufficient manner. Only when the ship came out of jump and the PA barked _assembly_ did they all get together.  Kerk was giving orders for the landing and questions were snapped back and forth. It was all technical and Jason didn't bother following it. It was the attitude of the Pyrrans that drew his attention. Their talk tended to be faster now as were their motions. They were like soldiers preparing for battle.  Their sameness struck Jason for the first time. Not that they looked alike or did the same things. It was the _way_ they moved and reacted that caused the striking similarity. They were like great, stalking cats. Walking fast, tense and ready to spring at all times, their eyes never still for an instant.  Jason tried to talk to Meta after the meeting, but she was almost a stranger. She answered in monosyllables and her eyes never met his, just brushed over them and went on. There was nothing he could really say so she moved to leave. He started to put his hand out to stop her--then thought better of it. There would be other times to talk.  Kerk was the only one who took any notice of him--and then only to order him to an acceleration couch.  Meta's landings were infinitely worse than her take-offs. At least when she landed on Pyrrus. There were sudden acceleration surges in every direction. At one point there was a free fall that seemed endless. There were loud thuds against the hull that shook the framework of the ship. It was more like a battle than a landing, and Jason wondered how much truth there was in that.  When the ship finally landed Jason didn't even know it. The constant 2 G's felt like deceleration. Only the descending moan of the ship's engines convinced him they were down. Unbuckling the straps and sitting up was an effort.  Two G's don't seem that bad--at first. Walking required the same exertion as would carrying a man of his own weight on his shoulders. When Jason lifted his arm to unlatch the door it was heavy as two arms. He shuffled slowly towards the main lock.  [Illustration]  They were all there ahead of him, two of the men rolling transparent cylinders from a nearby room. From their obvious weight and the way they clanged when they bumped, Jason knew they were made of transparent metal. He couldn't conceive any possible use for them. Empty cylinders a meter in diameter, longer than a man. One end solid, the other hinged and sealed. It wasn't until Kerk spun the sealing wheel and opened one of them that their use became apparent.  \"Get in,\" Kerk said. \"When you're locked inside you'll be carried out of the ship.\"  \"Thank you, no,\" Jason told him. \"I have no particular desire to make a spectacular landing on your planet sealed up like a packaged sausage.\"  \"Don't be a fool,\" was Kerk's snapped answer. \"We're _all_ going out in these tubes. We've been away too long to risk the surface without reorientation.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jason did feel a little foolish as he saw the others getting into tubes. He picked the nearest one, slid into it feet first, and pulled the lid closed. When he tightened the wheel in the center, it squeezed down against a flexible seal. Within a minute the CO{2} content in the closed cylinder went up and an air regenerator at the bottom hummed into life.  Kerk was the last one in. He checked the seals on all the other tubes first, then jabbed the air-lock override release. As it started cycling he quickly sealed himself in the remaining cylinder. Both inner and outer locks ground slowly open and dim light filtered in through sheets of falling rain.  For Jason, the whole thing seemed an anticlimax. All this preparation for absolutely nothing. Long, impatient minutes passed before a lift truck appeared driven by a Pyrran. He loaded the cylinders onto his truck like so much dead cargo. Jason had the misfortune to be buried at the bottom of the pile so he could see absolutely nothing when they drove outside.  It wasn't until the man-carrying cylinders had been dumped in a metal-walled room, that Jason saw his first native Pyrran life.  The lift truck driver was swinging a thick outer door shut when something flew in through the entrance and struck against the far wall. Jason's eye was caught by the motion, he looked to see what it was when it dropped straight down towards his face.  Forgetful of the metal cylinder wall, he flinched away. The creature struck the transparent metal and clung to it. Jason had the perfect opportunity to examine it in every detail.  It was almost too horrible to be believable. As though it were a bearer of death stripped to the very essentials. A mouth that split the head in two, rows of teeth, serrated and pointed. Leathery, claw-tipped wings, longer claws on the limbs that tore at the metal wall.  Terror rose up in Jason as he saw that the claws were tearing gouges in the transparent metal. Wherever the creature's saliva touched the metal clouded and chipped under the assault of the teeth.  Logic said these were just scratches on the thick tube. They couldn't matter. But blind, unreasoning fear sent Jason curling away as far as he could. Shrinking inside himself, seeking escape.  Only when the flying creature began dissolving did he realize the nature of the room outside. Sprays of steaming liquid came from all sides, raining down until the cylinders were covered. After one last clash of its jaws, the Pyrran animal was washed off and carried away. The liquid drained away through the floor and a second and third shower followed.  While the solutions were being pumped away, Jason fought to bring his emotions into line. He was surprised at himself. No matter how frightful the creature had been, he couldn't understand the fear it could generate through the wall of the sealed tube. His reaction was all out of proportion to the cause. Even with the creature destroyed and washed out of sight it took all of his will power to steady his nerves and bring his breathing back to normal.         *       *       *       *       *  Meta walked by outside and he realized the sterilization process was finished. He opened his own tube and climbed wearily out. Meta and the others had gone by this time and only a hawk-faced stranger remained, waiting for him.  \"I'm Brucco, in charge of the adaptation clinic. Kerk told me who you were. I'm sorry you're here. Now come along, I want some blood samples.\"  \"Now I feel right at home,\" Jason said. \"The old Pyrran hospitality.\" Brucco only grunted and stamped out. Jason followed him down a bare corridor into a sterile lab.  The double gravity was tiring, a constant drag on sore muscles. While Brucco ran tests on the blood sample, Jason rested. He had almost dozed off into a painful sleep when Brucco returned with a tray of bottles and hypodermic needles.  \"Amazing,\" he announced. \"Not an antibody in your serum that would be of any use on this planet. I have a batch of antigens here that will make you sick as a beast for at least a day. Take off your shirt.\"  \"Have you done this often?\" Jason asked. \"I mean juice up an outlander so he can enjoy the pleasures of your world?\"  Brucco jammed in a needle that felt like it grated on the bone. \"Not often at all. Last time was years ago. A half-dozen researchers from some institute, willing to pay well for the chance to study the local life forms. We didn't say no. Always need more galaxy currency.\"  Jason was already beginning to feel light-headed from the shots. \"How many of them lived?\" he mumbled vaguely.  \"One. We got him off in time. Made them pay in advance of course.\"  At first Jason thought the Pyrran was joking. Then he remembered they had very little interest in humor of any kind. If one-half of what Meta and Kerk had told him was true, six to one odds weren't bad at all.  There was a bed in the next room and Brucco helped him to it. Jason felt drugged and probably was. He fell into a deep sleep and into the dream.  Fear and hatred mixed in equal parts and washed over him red hot. If this was a dream, he never wanted to sleep again. If it wasn't a dream, he wanted to die. He tried to fight up against it, but only sank in more deeply. There was no beginning and no end to the fear and no way to escape.  When consciousness returned Jason could remember no detail of the nightmare. Just the fear remained. He was soaked with sweat and ached in every muscle. It must have been the massive dose of shots, he finally decided, that and the brutal gravity. That didn't take the taste of fear out of his mouth, though.  Brucco stuck his head in the door then and looked Jason up and down. \"Thought you were dead,\" he said. \"Slept the clock around. Don't move, I'll get something to pick you up.\"  The pickup was in the form of another needle and a glassful of evil-looking fluid. It settled his thirst, but made him painfully aware of gnawing hunger.  \"Want to eat?\" Brucco asked. \"I'll bet you do. I've speeded up your metabolism so you'll build muscle faster. Only way you'll ever beat the gravity. Give you quite an appetite for a while though.\"  Brucco ate at the same time and Jason had a chance to ask some questions. \"When do I get a chance to look around your fascinating planet? So far this trip has been about as interesting as a jail term.\"  \"Relax and enjoy your food. Probably be months before you're able to go outside. If at all.\"  Jason felt his jaw hanging and closed it with a snap. \"Could you possibly tell me why?\"  \"Of course. You will have to go through the same training"]]]
