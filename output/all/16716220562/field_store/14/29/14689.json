II      The middle wall is razed,       An entrance now is free;     For cherubim with sword of flame       No longer guard the tree.                                     III      O Paradise restored!       Now I shall enter in,     And taste the bliss from which I fell       Through Adam's mortal sin,--                                     IV      For Christ, the Father's Son,       Who God's true image bore,     Of Virgin born, in low estate       Our human nature wore.                                      V      True God! True Man! to Thee       Our earnest prayers ascend;     O, of Thy loving-kindness hear,       Who art the Sinners' Friend.                                {Christos gennatai}                           By St. Cosmas, 760 A.D.                                 {ho Heirmos}                                      I      Christ is born, go forth to meet Him,       Christ by all the heaven adored;     Singing songs of welcome, greet Him,       For the earth receives her Lord.     All ye nations shout and sing;     For He comes, your glorious King.                                 {troparion}                                     II      Once His heavenly image bearing,       Man has sunk to depths of sin;     Now defiled, debased, despairing,       Clad in rags and foul within;     But our God, who beauty gave,     Lifts the soul He comes to save.                                     III      From the height of heaven beholding,       Pity filled the heart of grace,     And our Lord, His love unfolding,       Made the earth His dwelling-place;     And a virgin mother gave     God Incarnate, man to save.                                     IV      Wisdom, Might, and Word Eternal,       Glory of the Father, Thou!     Hid from man and powers supernal,       Lo, He wears our nature now!     To the Lord your worship bring,     Praise Him, your victorious King.                          {ti soi prosenenkômen, Christe}                       By St. Anatolius, died 458 A.D.                                       I      What shall we bring to Thee?     What shall our offering be       On this Thy natal morn?     For Thou, O Christ, hast come to earth--     A virgin mother gave Thee birth--       For our redemption born.                                     II      The whole creation broad     Gives praise and thanks to God,       Who gave His only Son;     And list! the bright angelic throng     Their homage yield in sweetest song       For peace on earth begun.                                     III      The heavens their glory shed,     The star shines o'er His head,       The promised Christ and King;     And wise men from the lands afar,     Led by the brightness of the star,       Their treasured offerings bring.                                     IV      What shall we give Thee now?     Lowly the shepherds bow,       Have we no gift to bring?     Our worship, lo, we yield to Thee,     All that we are, and hope to be--       This is our offering.            {ho ouranos kai hê gê sêmeron prophêtikôs euphrainesthôsan}                            ({Stichêra Idiomela})                                       I      In the bliss of old predicted,       Heaven and earth to-day rejoice;     Men and angels, one in spirit,       Shout aloud in gleeful voice;     For, to those in darkness drear,     God in human flesh is near.                                     II      Cave and manger show the mystery;       Shepherds tell the wondrous tale;     Bearing gifts to lay before Him       From the East the Magi hail;     Taught by angel words to sing,     We unworthy praises bring.                                     III      Glory be to God eternal!       Peace on earth its reign begin!     For the one Desire of nations       Comes to save us from our sin;     Freedom He will now bestow     From the bondage of the foe.                             {Doxa en hypsistois theô}                      By St. John of Damascus, 780 A.D.                                       I      Bethlehem rejoices,       Hark the voices clear,     Singing in the starlight       Nearer and more near.             Unto God be glory,               Peace to men be given,             This His will who dwelleth               In the heights of heaven.                                     II      Heaven can not contain Him,       Nor the bounds of earth,     Yet, O Glorious Mystery!       Virgin gives Him birth.             Unto God be glory,               Peace to men be given,             This His will who dwelleth               In the heights of heaven.                                     III      Now the light ariseth       In the darkened skies,     Now the proud are humbled       And the lowly rise.             Unto God be glory,               Peace to men be given,             This His will who dwelleth               In the heights of heaven.                           {Sêmeron ho Hadês stenôn boa}             ({stichêra idiomela} of the Holy and Great Sabbath)                                       I      To-day the groans of Hades rise,--       'Ah, better far for me     The Son of Man had never died       Upon the cursèd tree!     For by His power the fettered souls       I held in darkest night,     Are carried through the sundered gates       Into the realm of light.'           Let glory now the Cross adorn,           Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!                                     II      To-day the groans of Hades rise,--       'My might is overthrown;     I took One dead, from 'mong the dead,       And claimed Him for mine own;     But He hath crushed my ancient power;       And those I held in thrall     Have thrown aside the chains they wore,       And He hath rescued all.'           Let glory now the Cross adorn,           Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!                                     III      To-day the groans of Hades rise,--       'My power is gone from me;     The Shepherd died upon the Cross,       And Adam's sons are free;     The bars are taken from the tomb,       Death can no more appal;     For He who gave Himself to death,       By death hath rescued all.'           Let glory now the Cross adorn,           Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!                          {kai tên phloginên rhomphaian}                                ({kontakion})                                       I      No longer now at Eden's gate       The fiery weapon gleams,     But from the Cross that leads to life       A light alluring streams.                                     II      And now the power of Death is gone,       His sting is torn away;     Grim Hades can no longer claim       His silent victory.                                     III      For Thou, O Saviour, didst descend       Where darkness brooding lies,     And bad'st the souls in bondage held       Return to Paradise.                     {ho monogenês Hyios kai Logos tou theou}                  (From the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom)                                       I      Thou one Begotten Son,       Eternal Word adored,     Immortal while the ages run,       And our Almighty Lord;                                     II      To bring Salvation nigh,       To vanquish death and sin,     Thou didst in cruel anguish die,       And life for mortals win.                                     III      Save us, O Christ our God,       Save by Thy Cross, we pray;     Thou who didst bear the Father's rod,       And death by dying slay.                                     IV      Thou art the Eternal Son,       One in the glorious Three;     Co-equal praise while ages run       Shall ever rise to thee.                      {Kyrie, anabainontos sou en tô staurô}                            ({Doxa Êchos pl. d1})                                       I      When on the cruel Cross       The Lord was lifted high,     Affrighted earth in terror quailed       To see its Maker die.                                     II      Then had the yawning caves       Devoured the murderous band,     Had not the Crucified in love       Stretched forth His saving hand.

IV      O Lover of mankind,       To Thee all glory be,     For Thou didst give not death, but life,       When hanging on the tree.                          {Dia Lazarou tên egersin Kyrie}                         ({Antiphônon G' Êchos B'})       When Lazarus rose at Christ's command,       And God was glorified of men,       The children cried Hosanna then,     But Judas would not understand.                              {Êchos ho autos}      When seated with Thy chosen band       Thou didst to Thy disciples say       That one, O Christ, would Thee betray,     But Judas would not understand.                                 {ho autos}      The sop revealed the traitor's hand,       In answer to the question made;       They saw by whom Thou wert betrayed,     But Judas would not understand.                                 {ho autos}      The Jews, O Christ, Thy life demand,       'Twas purchased for a price like this--       For silver pieces and a kiss,     But Judas would not understand.                                 {ho autos}      Thou, with Thine own unstainèd hand,       Didst wash the feet, and humbly teach       That such a task becometh each,     But Judas would not understand.

I      When, O King Immortal,       Thou didst seek the gloom,     Tasting death in meekness,       Resting in the tomb--     On that dark and woful day,     Hades owned Thy kingly sway.                                     II      Victor! now we hail Thee,       Hail Thee Christ our God;     Thou hast burst the barrier       Of Thy dark abode;     On that glad and glorious day,     Hades owned Thy kingly sway.                                     III      They who bore the spices       In the early hour,     Heard the salutation       Of the Lord of power,     And His followers, sore and sad,     Found the peace that made them glad.                                     IV      Hail the King Immortal!       Death by death is slain,     And the weak and fallen       Rise to life again;     On this glad and glorious day     Hades owns the Victor's sway.                 {Idou ho Nymphios erchetai en tô mesô tês nyktos}                                ({troparia})                                       I      Behold the Bridegroom cometh       At the hour of midnight drear,     And blest be he who watcheth       When his Master shall appear,     But woe betide the careless one       Asleep when He is near!                                     II      O soul of mine, bestir thee       Lest thou sink in slumber quite,     And the Bridegroom find thee sleeping       When He cometh in His might.     Awake, awake to praises,       For He cometh in the night.                                     III      That fearful day approacheth,       Then live, O soul, aright,     And watch the hour, and trim thy lamp       And keep it burning bright,     Lest the voice be heard, 'He cometh!'       In the middle of the night.                                     IV      Beware when slumber binds thee,       Lest the Bridegroom pass thee by,     And thou knock without in darkness,       And for grief and anguish cry;     Take thy lamp, with oil, and trim it,       For the hour is drawing nigh.                    {ergô, hôs palai tois mathêtais epêngeilô}                                ({troparia})                        By St. Cosmas, died 760 A.D.                                       I      O Jesus, Lover of our race,     How rich the promise of Thy grace       To Thy disciples made,--     A holy Paraclete to send,     To succour, comfort, and befriend       With His inspiring aid.                                     II      On earth the light is shining clear,     The Holy Comforter is here,       To all the faithful given;     And now, what prophets long foretold,     In all His fulness we behold       The Spirit sent from heaven.            {tacheian kai stathêran didou paramythian tois doulois sou}                                       I      O Jesus, to Thy servants give       The consolation they require;     And when the cloud of trouble falls,       With heavenly hope their souls inspire.     Be ever near us, Christ, to bless     And help us in Thy faithfulness.                                     II      As Thou wert with Thy saints of old,       Be with us, ever present, Lord;     Unite us to Thyself, we pray,       As Thou hast promised by Thy word;     Then we"]]]
