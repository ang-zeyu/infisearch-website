In that land of which we have so many records of early and high civilisation, and also such strong evidences of present barbarism,--the land of which we know so much and so little,--the land where Nature exhibits some of her most wonderful creations and greatest contrasts, and where she is also prolific in the great forms of animal and vegetable life,--there, my young reader, let us wander once more.  Let us return to Africa, and encounter new scenes in company with old friends.  On the banks of the Limpopo brightly blazes a hunter's fire, around which the reader may behold three distinct circles of animated beings. The largest is composed of horses, the second of dogs, and the lesser or inner one, of young men, whom many of my readers will recognise as old acquaintances.  I have but to mention the names of Hans and Hendrik Von Bloom, Groot Willem and Arend Van Wyk, to make known that _The Young Yagers_ are again on a hunting expedition.  In the one in which we now encounter them, not all the parties are inspired by the same hopes and desires.  The quiet and learned Hans Von Bloom, like many colonial youths, is affected with the desire of visiting the home of his forefathers.  He wishes to go to Europe for the purpose of making some practical use of the knowledge acquired, and the floral collections made, while a _Bush-Boy_ and a _Young Yager_.  But before doing so, he wishes to enlarge his knowledge of natural history by making one more expedition to a part of Southern Africa he has not yet visited.  He knows that extensive regions of his native land, containing large rivers and immense forests, and abounding in a vast variety of rare plants, lie between the rivers Limpopo and Zambezi, and before visiting Europe he wishes to extend his botanic researches in that direction. His desire to make his new excursion amid the African wilds is no stronger than that of \"Groot Willem\" Van Wyk, who ever since his return from the last expedition, six months before, has been anxious to undertake another in quest of game such as he has not yet encountered.  Our readers will search in vain around the camp-fire for little Jan and Klaas.  Their parents would not consent to their going so far from home, on an excursion promising so many hardships and so much danger. Besides, it was necessary that they should become something better than mere _Bush-Boys_, by spending a few years at school.  The two young cornets, Hendrik Von Bloom and Arend Van Wyk, each endeavouring to wear the appearance of old warriors, are present in the camp.  Although both are passionately fond of a sportsman's life, each, for certain reasons, had refrained from urging the necessity or advantage of the present expedition.  They would have preferred remaining at home and trying to find amusement during the day with the inferior game to be found near Graaf Reinet,-- not that they fear danger or were in any way entitled to the appellation of \"cockney sportsmen\"; but home has an attraction for them that the love of adventure cannot wholly eradicate.  Hendrik Von Bloom could have stayed very happily at home.  The excitement of the chase, which on former occasions he had so much enjoyed, now no longer attracts him half so much as the smiles of Wilhelmina Van Wyk, the only sister of his friends Groot Willem and Arend.  The latter young gentleman would not have travelled far from the daily society of little Truey Von Bloom, had he been left to his own inclinations.  But Willem and Hans had determined upon seeking adventures farther to the north than any place they had yet visited; and hence the present expedition.  The promise of sport and rare adventures, added to the fear of ridicule should they remain at home, influenced Hendrik and Arend to accompany the great hunter and the naturalist to the banks of the Limpopo.  Seated near the fire are two other individuals, whom the readers of _The Young Yagers_ will recognise as old acquaintances.  One is the short, stout, heavy-headed Bushman, Swartboy, who could not have been coaxed to remain behind while his young masters Hans and Hendrik were out in search of adventures.  The other personage not mentioned by name is Congo, the Kaffir.  The Limpopo River was too far from Graaf Reinet for the young hunters to think of reaching it with wagons and oxen.  The journey might be made, but it would take up too much time; and they were impatient to reach what Groot Willem had long called \"The Promised Land.\"  In order, therefore, to do their travelling in as little time as possible, they had taken no oxen; but, mounted on good horses, had hastened by the nearest route to the banks of the Limpopo, avoiding in place of seeking adventures by the way.  Besides their own saddle-horses, six others were furnished with pack-saddles, and lightly laden with ammunition, clothing, and such other articles as might be required.  The camp where we now encounter them is a temporary halting-place on the Limpopo.  They have succeeded in crossing the river, and are now on the borders of that land so long represented to them as being a hunter's paradise.  A toilsome journey is no longer before them; but only amusement, of a kind so much appreciated that they have travelled several hundred miles to enjoy it.  We have stated that, in undertaking this expedition, the youths were influenced by different motives.  This was to a great extent true; and yet they had a common purpose beside that of mere amusement.  The consul for the Netherlands had been instructed by his government to procure a young male and female giraffe, to be forwarded to Europe.  Five hundred pounds had been offered for the pair safely delivered either at Cape Town or Port Natal; and several parties of hunters that had tried to procure these had failed.  They had shot and otherwise killed camelopards by the score, but had not succeeded in capturing any young ones alive.  Our hunters had left home with the determination to take back a pair of young giraffes, and to pay all expenses of their expedition by this, as also by the sale of hippopotamus teeth.  The hope was not an unreasonable one.  They knew that fortunes had been made in procuring elephants' tusks, and also that the teeth of the hippopotamus were the finest of ivory, and commanded a price four times greater than any other sent to the European market.  But the capturing of the young camelopards was the principal object of their expedition.  The love of glory was stronger than the desire of gain, especially in Groot Willem, who as a hunter eagerly longed to accomplish a feat which had been attempted by so many others without success.  In his mind, the fame of fetching back the two young giraffes far outweighed the five hundred pound prize to be obtained, though the latter was a consideration not to be despised, and no doubt formed with him, as with the others, an additional incentive.    CHAPTER TWO.  ON THE LIMPOPO.  During the first night spent upon the Limpopo our adventurers had good reason for believing that they were in the neighbourhood of several kinds of game they were anxious to fall in with.  Their repose was disturbed by a combination of sounds, in which they could distinguish the roar of the lion, the trumpet-like notes of the elephant, mingled with the voices of some creature they could not remember having previously heard.  Several hours of that day had been passed in searching for a place to cross the river,--one where the banks were low on each side, and the stream not too deep.  This had not been found until the sun was low down upon the horizon.  By the time they had got safely over, twilight was fast thickening into darkness, and all but Congo were unwilling to proceed farther that night.  The Kaffir suggested that they should go at least half a mile up or down the river and Groot Willem seconded the proposal, although he had no other reason for doing so than a blind belief in the opinions of his attendant, whether they were based upon wisdom or instinct.  In the end Congo's suggestion had been adopted, and the sounds that disturbed the slumbers of the camp were heard at some distance, proceeding from the place where they had crossed the river.  \"Now, can you understand why Congo advised us to come here?\" asked Groot Willem, as they listened to the hideous noises that were depriving them of sleep.  \"No,\" was the reply of his companions.  \"Well, it was because the place where we crossed is the watering-place for all the animals in the neighbourhood.\"  \"That is so, Baas Willem,\" said Congo, confirming the statement of his master.  \"But we have not come a thousand miles for the sake of keeping out of the way of those animals, have we?\" asked the hunter Hendrik.  \"No,\" answered Willem, \"we came here to seek them, not to have them seek us.  Our horses want rest, whether we do or not.\"  Here ended further conversation for the night, for the hunters becoming accustomed to the chorus of the wild creatures, took no further notice of it, and one after another fell asleep.  Morning dawned upon a scene of surpassing beauty.  They were in a broad valley, covered with magnificent trees, among which were many gigantic baobabs (_Adansonia digitata_).  Wild date-trees were growing in little clumps; while the floral carpet, spread in brilliant pattern over the valley, was observed by Hans with an air of peculiar satisfaction.  He had reached a new field for the pursuit of his studies, and bright dreams were passing gently through his mind,--dreams that anticipated new discoveries in the botanical world, which might make his name known among the savants of Europe.  Before any of his companions were moving, Groot Willem, accompanied by Congo, stole forth to take a look at the surrounding country.  They directed their course down the river.  On reaching the place where they had crossed it, they chanced upon a tableau that even a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],["title","The Giraffe Hunters (#1)"],["body","er, who is supposed to take delight in the destruction of animals, could not look upon without unpleasant emotions.  Within the space of a hundred yards were lying five dead antelopes, of a species Willem had never seen before.  Feeding on the carcasses were several hyenas.  On the approach of the hunters, they slowly moved away, each laughing like a madman who has just committed some horrible atrocity.  By the \"spoors\" seen upon the river-banks, it was evident that both elephants and lions had visited the place during the night.  While making these and other reconnoissances, Groot Willem was joined by Hans, who had already commenced his favourite study by making an examination of the floral treasures in his immediate locality.  Arriving up with Groot Willem, the attention of Hans was at once directed to an examination of the antelopes, which he pronounced to be elands, but believed them to be of a new and undescribed variety of this animal. They were elands; but each was marked with small white stripes across the body, in this respect resembling \"koodoos.\"  After a short examination of the spoor, Congo asserted that a troop of elands had first visited the watering-place, and that while they were there four bull elephants, also in search of water, had charged with great speed upon the antelopes.  Three or four lions had also joined in the strife, in which the only victims had been the unfortunate elands.  \"I think we are in a place where we had better make a regular enclosure, and stop for a few days,\" suggested Groot Willem, on his return to the camp.  \"There is plenty of feed for the horses, and we have proof that the `drift' where we crossed is a great resort for all kinds of game.\"  \"I'm of the same opinion,\" assented Hendrik; \"but I don't wish to encamp quite so close to the crossing as this is.  We had better move some distance off.  Then we shall not prevent game from seeking the drift, or be ourselves hindered from getting sleep.  Don't you think we'd better move little farther up the river?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" was the unanimous answer.  It was therefore decided that search should be made for a better camping-ground, where they could build themselves a proper enclosure, or \"kraal.\"  After partaking of their first breakfast upon the Limpopo, Groot Willem, Hans, and Hendrik mounted their horses and rode off up the river, accompanied by the full pack of dogs, leaving Arend, with Swartboy and Congo, to take care of the camp.  For nearly three miles, the young hunters rode along the bank of the river, without finding any spot where access to the water could be readily obtained.  The banks were high and steep, and therefore but little visited by such animals as they wished to hunt.  At this point the features of the landscape began to change, presenting an appearance more to their satisfaction.  Light timber, such as would be required for the construction of a stockade, was growing near the river, which was no longer inaccessible, though its banks appeared but little frequented by game.  \"I think this place will suit admirably,\" said Groot Willem.  \"We are only half an hour's ride from the drift, and probably we may find good hunting-ground farther up stream.\"  \"Very likely,\" rejoined Hendrik; \"but before taking too much trouble to build ourselves a big kraal, we had better be sure about what sort of game is to be got here.\"  \"You are right about that,\" answered Willem; \"we must take care to find out whether there are hippopotami and giraffes.  We cannot go home without a pair of the latter.  Our friends would be disappointed, and some I know would have a laugh at us.\"  \"And you for one would deserve it,\" said Hans.  \"Remember how you ridiculed the other hunters who returned unsuccessful.\"  Having selected a place for the kraal, should they decide on staying awhile in the neighbourhood, the young hunters proceeded farther up the river, for the purpose of learning something more of the hunting-ground before finally determining to construct the enclosure.    CHAPTER THREE.  A TWIN TRAP.  Not long after the departure of Groot Willem and his companions, Arend, looking towards a thicket about half a mile from the river, perceived a small herd of antelopes quietly browsing upon the plain.  Mounting his horse, he rode off, with the intention of bagging one or more of them for the day's dinner.  Having ridden to the leeward of the herd, and getting near them, he saw that they were of the species known as \"Duyker,\" or Divers (_Antelope grimmia_).  Near them was a small \"motte\" of the _Nerium oleander_, a shrub about twelve feet high, loaded with beautiful blossoms.  Under the cover of these bushes, he rode up close enough to the antelopes to insure a good shot, and, picking out one of the largest of the herd, he fired.  All the antelopes but one rushed to the edge of the thicket, made a grand leap, and dived out of sight over the tops of the bushes,--thus affording a beautiful illustration of that peculiarity to which they are indebted for their name of Divers.  Riding up to the one that had remained behind, and which was that at which he had fired, the young hunter made sure that it was dead; he then trotted back to the camp, and despatched Congo and the Bushman to bring it in.  They soon returned with the carcass, which they proceeded to skin and make ready for the spit.  While thus engaged, Swartboy appeared to notice some thing out upon the plain.  \"Look yonner, Baas Arend,\" said he.  \"Well, what is it, Swart?\"  \"You see da pack-horse dare?  He gone too much off from de camp.\"  Arend turned and looked in the direction the Bushman was pointing.  One of the horses, which had strayed from its companions, was now more than half a mile off, and was wandering onwards.  \"All right, Swart.  You go on with your cooking.  I'll ride after it myself, and drive it in.\"  Arend, again mounting his horse, trotted off in the direction of the animal that had strayed.  For cooking the antelope, Congo and Swartboy saw the necessity of providing themselves with some water; and taking a vessel for that purpose, they set out for the drift,--that being the nearest place where they could obtain it.  They kept along the bank of the river, and just before reaching a place where they would descend to the water, Congo, who was in the advance, suddenly disappeared!  He had walked on to a carefully concealed pit, dug for the purpose of catching hippopotami or elephants.  The hole was about nine feet deep; and after being astonished by dropping into it, the Kaffir was nearly blinded by the sand, dust, and other materials that had formed the covering of the pit.  Congo was too well acquainted with this South African device for killing large game to be anyways disconcerted by what had happened; and after becoming convinced that he was uninjured by the fall, he turned his glance upward, expecting assistance from his companion.  But Swartboy's aid could not just then be given.  The Bushman, amused by the ludicrous incident that had befallen his rival, was determined to enjoy the fun for a little longer.  Uttering a wild shout of laughter that was a tolerable imitation of an enraged hyena, Swartboy seemed transported into a heaven of unadulterated joy.  Earth appeared hardly able to hold him as he leaped and danced around the edge of the pit.  Never had his peculiar little mind been so intensely delighted; but the manifestations of that delight were more suddenly terminated than commenced; for in the midst of his eccentric capers he, too, suddenly disappeared into the earth as if swallowed up by an earthquake!  His misfortune was similar to that which had befallen his companion.  Two pitfalls had been constructed close together, and Swartboy now occupied the second.  It is a common practice among the natives of South Africa to trap the elephant in these twin pitfalls; as the animals, too hastily avoiding the one, run the risk of dropping into the other.  Swartboy and the Kaffir had unexpectedly found a place where this plan had been adopted; and, much to their discomfiture, without the success anticipated by those who had taken the trouble to contrive it.  The cavity into which Congo had fallen contained about two feet of mud on the bottom.  The sides were perpendicular, and of a soapy sort of clay, so that his attempts at climbing out proved altogether unsuccessful, thus greatly increasing the chagrin of his unphilosophic mind.  He had heard the Bushman's screams of delight, and the sounds had contributed nothing to reconcile him to the mischance that had befallen him.  Several minutes passed and he heard nothing of Swartboy.  He was not surprised at the Bushman's having been amused as well as gratified by his misfortune.  Still, he expected that in time he would lend assistance and pull him out of the pit.  But as this assistance was not given, and as Swartboy, not satisfied with laughing at his misfortune appeared also to have gone off and left him to his fate, the Kaffir became frantic with rage.  Several more minutes passed, which to Congo seemed hours, and still nothing was seen or heard of his companion.  Had Swartboy returned to the camp?  If so, why had not Arend, on ascertaining what was wrong, hastened to the relief of his faithful servant?  As some addition to the discomforts of the place, the pit contained many reptiles and insects that had in some manner obtained admittance, and, like himself, could not escape.  There were toads, frogs, large ants called \"soldiers,\" and other creatures whose company he had no relish to keep.  In vain he called, \"Swartboy!\" and \"Baas Arend!\"  No one came to his call.  The strong, vindictive spirit of his race was soon roused to the pitch of fury, and liberty became only desired for one object.  That was revenge,--revenge on the man who, instead of releasing him from his imprisonment, only exulted in its continuance.  The Bushman had not been injured in falling into the pit, as may be supposed.  After fully"]]]
