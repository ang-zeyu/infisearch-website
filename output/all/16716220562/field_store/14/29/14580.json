It was one of the nuisances of being stationed here at E.H.Q. that you'd have swarms of these super-bright youngsters hanging around, asking questions, disputing your answers, arguing with each other, and, if you didn't watch them carefully, taking things apart and putting them back together in different hookups to see what would happen.  The first thing these kids were taught was to disregard everything everybody had ever said; to start out from scratch as if nobody had ever had the sense to think about the problem before; to doubt most of all the opinions of experts, for, obviously, if the experts were right then there would be no problem. Most of them didn't have to be taught it, they seemed to have been born with it. Time was you batted a young smart aleck down, told him to go get dry behind the ears before he shot off his mouth. But not these days. These days you looked at him hopefully, and crossed your fingers. He might grow up to be an E.  Tom wondered what it would be like to doubt the realities, the very machinery under his hands, to assume that although it had always worked it might not work this time. He could not conceive that state of mind, or how a man could live in it without going insane. Every time he saw these tortured kids saying, \"Well, maybe, but what if ...\" he was glad to be nothing more than a ship captain who knew his machinery was exactly what it was supposed to be and nothing else.  But, in a way, it was nice for the lads too. After thousands of years of man's almost rabid determination to destroy the brightest and best of his young, the world had finally found a place for the bright boy.  This morning, probably because of the early dawn hour, there were only two of them in the generator room. As expected, they were arguing over the space-jump band. Frank was standing over to one side, observing but not participating. His cap was pushed back on his blond head, his big face expressionless. It was common gossip throughout flight crews everywhere that Frank, blindfolded, could take a cruiser apart and put it back together without missing a motion.  \"The jump band is founded on the basic of the Moebius strip,\" one student E was saying heatedly. \"This little gadget sends out a field in the shape of such a strip, a band with a half twist before rejoined. Its width is as variable as we need it, up to a light-year.\"  \"Only it hasn't any width at all,\" the other student argued. \"That's the whole point. The Moebius strip has only one edge, so it can't have width. We enter that edge, go through a line that doesn't exist, and come out a light-year away, without taking any longer than the time to pass a point.\"  \"But that's _what_ happens, not _how_,\" the other shouted angrily. \"Everybody knows _what_ happens. Tell me _how_ and maybe I'll listen.\"  Tom caught his flight engineer's eye and signaled with his head that it might be a good idea to get rid of the students. Any other time it would be all right, a part of their stand-by job, but they'd got word last night to have the ship in readiness from six o'clock on. They might have to wait all day, but then again, some E might get an idea and want to go shooting out to Eden right off.  Frank caught the signal, grinned, and began to herd the two students toward the door. They were in such heated argument now, accusing one another of parrot repetition instead of thinking for himself, that they didn't realize that they were being nudged out of the ship, down its ramp, and out on the field.  \"Don't think it hasn't been educational, and all,\" Frank murmured to them as he got them off the ramp. \"You get the how of it figured out, you let me know.\"  The two looked at him as if he might be an interesting phenomenon, decided he wasn't, and wandered away, back toward the school dormitories, still arguing.  \"Sometimes I think a quiet milk run out to Saturn would have its brighter side,\" Frank muttered to Tom when he came back inside the ship. Tom grinned at him in wordless understanding.  There was no tension between them. They had worked together so long that they had got over all the attraction-repulsion conflicts which operate far beneath the surface mind to cause likes and dislikes. Now they accepted one another in the way a man accepts his own hands--proud of them when they do something with extra skill, making allowances when they fumble; but never considering doing without them.  \"Wonder who the E will be this time?\" Frank asked, without too much concern. It didn't really matter. An E was an E, for better or for worse.  \"Haven't heard,\" Tom answered. \"Probably not decided yet. If the Senior E's think it isn't much of a problem, they might send a Junior. Or if they don't want to be bothered, they might send a Junior who's up for his solo problem.\"  \"Whoever, or whatever, I'm sure it will be interesting,\" Frank commented with a grin. Tom returned the grin. There wasn't any malice in it, nor any of the basic enmity and destructiveness of the stupid toward the bright, just a recognition that an E was an E. They had a vast respect for an E, but you couldn't get around it that some of them were--well, maybe eccentric was the word.  \"I hear there's trouble on that planet we're going to--Eden, isn't it?\" Frank commented.  \"You think we'd be hauling an E out there if there weren't?\" Tom countered wryly.  They continued to check over each item in the generator room, their flying fingers making sharp contrast to their slow, idle conversation. They gave the room extra care this time because there had been some quick-fingered students around who just might have got it into their heads to improve the machinery. Satisfied at last that there had been no subtle meddling, they snapped the cowl of the generator back into position. They took one more sharp look around, then walked, single file, up the narrow passage to the control room. Louie LeBeau was sitting in the astronavigator's seat, checking over his star charts and instruments. He glanced up at them as they came level with his cubicle. He was the third man of the team, as used to them as they were to him.  \"Fourteen hop adjustments to get us past Pluto and out of the heavy traffic,\" he grumbled sourly. His round face and liquid brown eyes were perpetually disgusted. \"They keep saying over at Traffic that they're going to provide a freeway out of the solar system so we can take it in one hop, but they don't do it. Wonder when we'll ever go modern, start doing things scientific?\"  They paid no attention to his grumbling. That was just Louie.  \"Then how many hops to Eden, after Pluto?\" Tom asked.  \"I figure twenty,\" Louie answered. \"Can't take full light-year leaps every time. There's stuff in the way. There's always stuff in the way to louse up a good flight plan. Universe is too crowded. There'll be no trouble getting _to_ Eden, no trouble _getting_ there. Make it in about fourteen hours. Fourteen hours to go eleven lousy little light-years. Fourteen hours I got to work in one stretch. Wait'll the union agent hears you're working me fourteen hours without a relief. And are you letting me get my rest now, so I can work fourteen hours? Or are you stopping me from resting with a lot of questions?\"  \"But you think there may be trouble _after_ we get to Eden?\" Tom asked.  Louie looked at him. There was no fear in the soft, brown eyes; just an enormous indignation that life should always treat him so dirty.  \"Don't you?\" he asked.     4   Calvin Gray, Junior Extrapolator, stood nude before his bathroom mirror and played a no-beard light over his chin and thin cheeks. That should take care of the beard problem for the next six months or so. He leaned forward and examined the fine lines beginning to appear at the corners of his eyes. Well, that was one of the signs he'd reached the thirty mark. One couldn't stay forever at the peak of youth--not yet, anyway. Perhaps he should think about that sometime.  Trouble was, there was always something more urgent....  He became conscious that Linda was standing in the bathroom door watching him. He hadn't heard her get out of bed.  \"You used the no-beard just last month, Cal,\" she said. There was a questioning note in her voice.  \"Want to keep handsome,\" he said lightly. \"Never know when I might have to run out to some other world. Wouldn't want one of my other wives to catch me with stubble on my face.\"  It was a stale joke, a childish one, but it served to introduce the topic foremost in his mind.  \"This Eden problem. I can't plan on it, but I hope it's my solo to qualify me for my big E. I'm due, you know.\"  Linda chose to avoid coming directly to grips with it.  \"Yehudi is already at the door,\" she said, and made a face of exasperation. \"Someday I'm going to turn off the gadget that signals the orderly room the minute you get out of bed, so I can have you all to myself.\"  \"It's better if you get used to him,\" Cal cautioned. \"Turn off the signal and that turns on an alarm. Instead of one Yehudi, you'd have twenty rushing in to see what was wrong.\"  \"Well, it seems to me a grown man ought to be able to take his morning shower without an observer standing by to see that he doesn't drown himself or swallow the soap,\" she commented with a touch of acid.  \"Get used to it, woman,\" he commanded. \"There's only one observer now. When--if I get my Senior rating, there'll be three.\"  She didn't say anything. Instead she stepped over to him, pressed her nude body against his, and tenderly nuzzled his arm.  \"Maybe if we go back to bed, he'll go away,\" she said, and glittered her eyes at him wickedly.  \"He won't, but it's a good idea,\" Cal grinned at her.  \"You could tell him to go away,\" she whispered with a little pout.  She was fighting. She was fighting with the only weapon she had to hold him, to keep him from going away, to face an unknown.

He took her tenderly in his arms, held her close to him, stroked her hair, kissed her mouth. She pulled her face away, buried it in his chest. He felt her sobbing.  He picked her up, lightly, carried her back into the bedroom, laid her gently on the bed, and, oblivious to the attendant who stood expressionless inside the door, knelt down beside the bed and held her head in his arms.  \"Don't fight it,\" he said softly. \"It isn't the first time a man has had to go.\"  \"It's the first time it ever happened to me,\" she sobbed.  \"You knew when you married me.... You agreed....\"  \"It was easy to agree, then. There was the glamor of being known as the wife of an E. Now that doesn't matter. There's just you, and the thought of losing you, never seeing you again.\"  \"I haven't gone yet,\" he reminded her. \"I don't know that I'll get the job. There are three Seniors at base right now. One of them might want it. Even if I do get the problem, who says I won't be back? You take old McGinnis. He's eighty if he's a day. He's been an E for nigh on to fifty years. He's still around, you'll notice.\"  She was quieter now. She lay, looking at him, drinking in his dark hair, blue eyes, handsome face, the shape of his intelligent head, the slope of his neck and shoulders, the tapering waist, all the masculine grace and beauty. She pressed her closed fist into her mouth. All the beauty she might never see again, feel enfolded around her, enfold with herself.  \"I'm a little fool,\" she said through clenched teeth. \"Of course you'll be back. And you'd better make it quick, or I'll come after you.\"  He kissed her, rumpled her short hair, straightened her crumpled body on the bed, pulled the sheet over her.  \"Why don't you go back to sleep,\" he suggested. \"Rest. I'll have breakfast in the E club room. That's where we'll be watching the Eden briefing. Sleep. Sleep all morning.\"  Gently he closed her eyes with the tip of his forefinger. Gently he kissed her once more. This time she didn't cling to him, try to hold him.  He tucked the sheet in around her throat. Dutifully, she kept her eyes closed. He stood up then, and signaled the orderly.  \"I'll take my shower now,\" he said.  The orderly didn't speak, just followed him into the bathroom to stand in the doorway and watch him through the shower glass. He was rigidly obeying the cardinal rule of E.H.Q.  Unless his life is in danger, never interrupt the thinking of an E. The whole course of man's destiny in the universe may depend on it.  How much of the future of the universe depended upon his not interrupting the scene he had just witnessed wasn't for him to say. He sighed. He thought of his own wife--shrewish, fat, coarse, always complaining. He wondered what she would do if he picked her up, carried her to bed, closed her eyes with his fingers. For once, he'd bet, she'd be speechless.  He must try it sometime. But first, she'd have to lose about fifty pounds.         *       *       *       *       *  When Cal got to the E club room two Seniors were already there--McGinnis and Wong. He thought their greeting was a shade more cordial, a shade more interested than usual. They seemed, this time, to be looking at him as if he were a person, not merely a Junior E. When he turned away from them to greet the three Juniors, who, along with himself, ranked the club-room privileges, he became certain of his impressions. Their faces were frankly envious.  Eden was to be his problem!  He'd hoped for it. Even half expected it. Yet all the way through his shower, dressing, coming down the elevator from his apartment, he'd been nagged with the fear he might not be considered; that the grief of Linda and her rise above it would lead only to anticlimax. By the time he'd got to the club-room door, followed by his orderly, he had already conditioned himself to disappointment.  Now he subdued his elation while he told his orderly what he wanted for breakfast.  \"You fellows join me in something?\" he asked both Juniors and Seniors.  \"A second cup of coffee,\" Wong agreed.  \"A second bourbon,\" old McGinnis said drily.  The Juniors shook their heads negatively. Yesterday they had been his constant companions, only a few degrees below him in accomplishment, pushing rapidly to become his equal competitors for the next solo. Today, this morning, there was already a gap between them and him, a chasm they would make no move to bridge until they had earned the right. They seated themselves at another table, apart.  \"Of course we haven't asked you if you want this Eden problem,\" McGinnis commented while orderlies placed food and drink in front of them. \"We ought to ask him, hadn't we, Wong?\"  \"First I should ask if either of you want it?\" Cal said quickly. \"Or perhaps Malinkoff, if he shows up.\"  \"Malinkoff is too deep in something to come to the briefing,\" Wong said.  \"Wong and I came only to help on your first solo, if we can,\" McGinnis said. \"Always think a young fellow needs a little send-off. I remember, about fifty years ago, more or less ...\"  \"Worst thing to guard against,\" Wong interrupted, \"is disappointment. This whole thing might add up to nothing. Might not turn out to be a genuine solo at all, just something any errand boy could do. In that case it wouldn't qualify you. You know that.\"  \"Sure,\" Cal said. Naturally the problem would have to give real challenge. You didn't just go out and knock a home run to become an E. You tackled something outside the normal frame of reference, something that required original thinking, the E kind of thinking. You brought it off successfully. A given number of Seniors reviewed what you'd done. If they thought it was worth something, you got your big E. If they didn't, you tried again. And you didn't get it by default, just because somebody thought there should be a given quota of Seniors on the list.  \"Little or big,\" he added, \"I'd like the problem.\"  They said no more. He knew the score. He'd had twelve years of the most intensive training the E's themselves could devise. He knew that sometimes a Junior spent another ten or twelve years chasing down jobs which anybody on the spot could have solved if they'd used their heads a little before they ran on to something that challenged that training. He'd be lucky if this was big enough--but not too big.  That was in their minds, too.     5   On ordinary days there were only the usual few science reporters in the press room of E.H.Q. These held their jobs by the difficult compromise between the scientists' insistence upon accuracy and their publishers' equal insistence upon sensationalism.  Since the publisher paid the salary; since rewrite men, like television writers, maintained their own feeling of superiority to the mass by writing down to the level of a not very bright twelve-year-old; since the facts had to be trimmed and altered to fit the open space or time slot; even these reporters had a difficult time of maintaining the usual odds--that there is only a twenty-to-one chance that anything said in the newspapers or on the air may be accurate.  But on this morning the press room was crowded. In spite of all efforts of journalism to stir up old animosities to make news, or to force factional leaders into rashness which could not be settled without violence; the various states of world government insisted upon negotiating ethnical differences amicably, and factional leaders persisted in keeping their heads. There had been no world-shaking discoveries made in the last week or so; the public no longer believed that changing a screw thread was exactly a scientific \"break-through\"; no real or imagined scandals seemed of such journalistic stature as to work the public into a frenzy of intolerance for one another's aberrations.  In such a dry spell, when advertisers were beginning to question circulation figures, and editors were racking their brains for a strong hate symbol to create interest, the delayed report from Eden came as a summer shower, that might be magnified into a flood.  EDEN SILENT quickly became COLONY FEARED LOST and progressed normally to COLONY WIPED OUT.  That there was no proof of loss or destruction bothered no one in journalism. If it did turn out this way, they'd have been on top of the news; and if it didn't, well, who remembers yesterday's headlines in the press of today's new hate and panic.  The public, with an established addiction to ever increasing daily doses of sensationalism, and deprived of its shots through this dry spell, snapped out of its apathy to greet this new thrill with vociferous calls to editors, wires to congressmen, telegrams to the Administration.  What are we doing about this colony that has been wiped out? Where is our space battle fleet? Who is going to be punished?  It was an overnight sensation, and on this morning following the news leak there could even be seen some secretaries to the writers for top commentators and columnists in the crowded press room.  Naturally these stood in little groups apart and associated only with each other to maintain the literary tradition of proper insulation from the realities of what was going on in the rest of the world. Obviously no first-rate writer could have afforded to appear in person not only because of damage to his stature lest it be noted he was doing his own spadework; but, more important, first-hand observation might limit his capacity for rationalizing the situation into the mold demanded by the bias of his commentator or columnist. It was always difficult to maintain author integrity when the facts did not support the sensationalism required by the employers, and best not to put oneself in such a position.  Now two of these secretaries could be seen over in a corner of the press room exchanging their views, probing one another for information. No one thought it curious they weren't trying to get the information from source for everyone in"]]]
