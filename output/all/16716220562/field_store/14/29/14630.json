And Polly was left, very rebellious indeed, in the big bed, with a cooling lotion on the poor eyes, that somehow didn't cool them one bit.  “If 'twas anythin' but my eyes, mammy, I could stand it,” she bewailed, flouncing over and over in her impatience; “and who'll do all the work now?”  “Don't think of the work, Polly,” said Mrs. Pepper.  “I can't do anything but think,” said poor Polly.  Just at that moment a queer noise out in the kitchen was heard.  “Do go out, mother, and see what 'tis,” said Polly.  “I've come,” said a cracked voice, close up by the bedroom door, followed by a big black cap, which could belong to no other than Grandma Bascom, “to set by you a spell; what's the matter?” she asked, and stopped, amazed to see Polly in bed.  “Oh, Polly's taken,” screamed Mrs. Pepper in her ear.  “Taken!” repeated the old lady, “what is it--a fit?”  “No,” said Mrs. Pepper; “the same as Ben's got; and Phronsie; the measles.”  “The measles, has she?” said grandma; “well, that's bad; and Ben's away, you say.”  “No, he isn't either,” screamed Mrs. Pepper, “he's got them, too!”  “Got two what?” asked grandma.  “Measles! he's got the measles too,” repeated Mrs. Pepper, loud as she could; so loud that the old lady's cap trembled at the noise.  “Oh! the dreadful!” said grandma; “and this girl too?” laying her hand on Phronsie's head.  “Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper, feeling it a little relief to tell over her miseries; “all three of them!”  “I haven't,” said Joel, coming in in hopes that grandma had a stray peppermint or two in her pocket, as she sometimes did; “and I'm not going to, either.”  “Oh, dear,” groaned his mother; “that's what Polly said; and she's got 'em bad. It's her eyes,” she screamed to grandma, who looked inquiringly.  “Her eyes, is it?” asked Mrs. Bascom; “well, I've got a receet that cousin Samanthy's folks had when John's children had 'em; and I'll run right along home and get it,” and she started to go.  “No, you needn't,” screamed Mrs. Pepper; “thank you, Mrs. Bascom; but Dr. Fisher's been here; and he put something on Polly's eyes; and he said it mustn't be touched.”  “Hey?” said the old lady; so Mrs. Pepper had to go all over it again, till at last she made her understand that Polly's eyes were taken care of, and they must wait for time to do the rest.  “You come along of me,” whispered grandma, when at last her call was done, to Joel who stood by the door. “I've got some peppermints to home; I forgot to bring 'em.”  “Yes'm,” said Joel, brightening up.  “Where you going, Joe?” asked Mrs. Pepper, seeing him move off with Mrs. Bascom; “I may want you.”  “Oh, I've got to go over to grandma's,” said Joel briskly; “she wants me.”  “Well, don't be gone long then,” replied his mother.  “There,” said grandma, going into her “keeping-room” to an old-fashioned chest of drawers; opening one, she took therefrom a paper, from which she shook out before Joe's delighted eyes some red and white peppermint drops. “There now, you take these home; you may have some, but be sure you give the most to the sick ones; and Polly--let Polly have the biggest.”  “She won't take 'em,” said Joel, wishing he had the measles. “Well, you try her,” said grandma; “run along now.” But it was useless to tell Joel that, for he was half-way home already. He carried out grandma's wishes, and distributed conscientiously the precious drops. But when he came to Polly, she didn't answer; and looking at her in surprise he saw two big tears rolling out under the bandage and wetting the pillow.  “I don't want 'em, Joe,” said Polly, when he made her understand that “twas peppermints, real peppermints;” “you may have 'em.”  “Try one, Polly; they're real good,” said Joel, who had an undefined wish to comfort; “there, open your mouth.”  So Polly opened her mouth, and Joel put one in with satisfaction.  “Isn't it good?” he asked, watching her crunch it.  “Yes,” said Polly, “real good; where'd you get 'em?”  “Over to Grandma Bascom's,” said Joel; “she gave me lots for all of us; have another, Polly?”  “No,” said Polly, “not yet; you put two on my pillow where I can reach 'em; and then you keep the rest, Joel.”  “I'll put three,” said Joel, counting out one red and two white ones, and laying them on the pillow; “there!”  “And I want another, Joey, I do,” said Phronsie from the other side of the bed.  “Well, you may have one,” said Joel; “a red one, Phronsie; yes, you may have two. Now come on, Dave; we'll have the rest out by the wood-pile.”  How they ever got through that day, I don't know. But late in the afternoon carriage wheels were heard; and then they stopped right at the Peppers' little brown gate.  “Polly,” said Mrs. Pepper, running to the bedroom door, “it's Mrs. Henderson!”  “Is it?” said Polly, from the darkened room, “oh! I'm so glad! is Miss Jerushy with her?” she asked, fearfully.  “No,” said Mrs. Pepper, going back to ascertain; “why, it's the parson himself! Deary! how we look!”  “Never mind, mammy,” called back Polly, longing to spring out of bed and fix up a bit.  “I'm sorry to hear the children are sick,” said Mrs. Henderson, coming in, in her sweet, gentle way.  “We didn't know it,” said the minister, “until this morning--can we see them?”  “Oh yes, sir,” said Mrs. Pepper; “Ben's upstairs; and Polly and Phronsie are in here.”  “Poor little things!” said Mrs. Henderson, compassionately; “hadn't you better,” turning to the minister, “go up and see Ben first, while I will visit the little girls?”  So the minister mounted the crooked stairs; and Mrs. Henderson went straight up to Polly's side; and the first thing Polly knew, a cool, gentle hand was laid on her hot head, and a voice said, “I've come to see my little chicken now!”  “Oh, ma'am,” said Polly, bursting into a sob, “I don't care about my eyes--only mammy--” and she broke right down.  “I know,” said the minister's wife, soothingly; “but it's for you to bear patiently, Polly--what do you suppose the chicks were doing when I came away?” And Mrs. Henderson, while she held Polly's hand, smiled and nodded encouragingly to Phronsie, who was staring at her from the other side of the bed.  “I don't know, ma'am,” said Polly; “please tell us.”  “Well, they were all fighting over a grasshopper--yes, ten of them.”  “Which one got it?” asked Polly in intense interest; “oh! I hope the white one did!”  “Well, he looked as much like winning as any of them,” said the lady, laughing.  “Bless her!” thought Mrs. Pepper to herself out in the kitchen, finishing the sack Polly had left; “she's a parson's wife, I say!”  And then the minister came down from Ben's room, and went into the bedroom; and Mrs. Henderson went up-stairs into the loft.  “So,” he said kindly, as after patting Phronsie's head he came over and sat down by Polly, “this is the little girl who came to see me when I was sick.”  “Oh, sir,” said Polly, “I'm so glad you wasn't!”  “Well, when I come again,” said Mr. Henderson, rising after a merry chat, “I see I shall have to slip a book into my pocket, and read for those poor eyes.”  “Oh, thank you!” cried Polly; and then she stopped and blushed.  “Well, what is it?” asked the minister, encouragingly.  “Ben loves to hear reading,” said Polly.  “Does he? well, by that time, my little girl, I guess Ben will be down-stairs; he's all right, Polly; don't you worry about him--and I'll sit in the kitchen, by the bedroom door, and you can hear nicely.”  So the Hendersons went away. But somehow, before they went, a good many things found their way out of the old-fashioned chaise into the Peppers' little kitchen.  But Polly's eyes didn't get any better, with all the care; and the lines of worry on Mrs. Pepper's face grew deeper and deeper. At last, she just confronted Dr. Fisher in the kitchen, one day after his visit to Polly, and boldly asked him if they ever could be cured. “I know she's--and there isn't any use keeping it from me,” said the poor woman--“she's going to be stone-blind!”  “My good woman,” Dr. Fisher's voice was very gentle; and he took the hard, brown hand in his own--“your little girl will not be blind; I tell you the truth; but it will take some time to make her eyes quite strong--time, and rest. She has strained them in some way, but she will come out of it.”  “Praise the Lord!” cried Mrs. Pepper, throwing her apron over her head; and then she sobbed on, “and thank you, sir--I can't ever thank you--for--for--if Polly was blind, we might as well give up!”  The next day, Phronsie, who had the doctor's permission to sit up, only she was to be kept from taking cold, scampered around in stocking-feet in search of her shoes, which she hadn't seen since she was first taken sick.  “Oh, I want on my very best shoes,” she cried; “can't I, mammy?”  “Oh, no, Phronsie; you must keep them nice,” remonstrated her mother; “you can't wear 'em every-day, you know.”  “'Tisn't every-day,” said Phronsie, slowly; “it's only one day.”  “Well, and then you'll want 'em on again tomorrow,” said her mother.  “Oh, no, I won't!” cried Phronsie; “never, no more to-morrow, if I can have 'em to-day; please, mammy dear!”  Mrs. Pepper went to the lowest drawer in the high bureau, and took therefrom a small parcel done up in white tissue paper. Slowly unrolling this before the delighted eyes of the child, who stood patiently waiting, she disclosed the precious red-topped shoes which Phronsie immediately clasped to her bosom.  “My own, very own shoes! whole mine!” she cried, and trudged out into the kitchen to put them on herself.  “Hulloa!” cried Dr. Fisher, coming in about a quarter of an hour later to find her tugging laboriously at the buttons--“new shoes! I declare!”  “My own!” cried Phronsie, sticking out one foot for inspection, where every button was in the wrong button-hole, “and they've got red tops, too!”  “So they have,” said the doctor, getting down on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],["title","The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Saunders Company Philadelphia     TO THE MEMORY OF  JOHN WICHENFORD WASHBOURN, C.M.G., M.D., F.R.C.P.  Physician to Guy's Hospital and Lecturer on Bacteriology in the Medical School, and Physician to the London Fever Hospital  MY TEACHER, FRIEND, AND CO-WORKER     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION   Bacteriology is essentially a practical study, and even the elements of its technique can only be taught by personal instruction in the laboratory. This is a self-evident proposition that needs no emphasis, yet I venture to believe that the former collection of tried and proved methods has already been of some utility, not only to the student in the absence of his teacher, but also to isolated workers in laboratories far removed from centres of instruction, reminding them of forgotten details in methods already acquired. If this assumption is based on fact no further apology is needed for the present revised edition in which the changes are chiefly in the nature of additions--rendered necessary by the introduction of new methods during recent years.  I take this opportunity of expressing my deep sense of obligation to my confrère in the Physiological Department of our medical school--Mr. J. H. Ryffel, B. C., B. Sc.--who has revised those pages dealing with the analysis of the metabolic products of bacterial life; to successive colleagues in the Bacteriological Department of Guy's Hospital, for their ready co-operation in working out or in testing new methods; and finally to my Chief Laboratory Assistant, Mr. J. C. Turner whose assistance and experience have been of the utmost value to me in the preparation of this volume. I have also to thank Mrs. Constant Ponder for many of the new line drawings and for redrawing a number of the original cuts.      JOHN W. H. EYRE.      GUY'S HOSPITAL, S. E.     _July, 1913._     PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION   In the following pages I have endeavoured to arrange briefly and concisely the various methods at present in use for the study of bacteria, and the elucidation of such points in their life-histories as are debatable or still undetermined.  Of these methods, some are new, others are not; but all are reliable, only such having been included as are capable of giving satisfactory results even in the hands of beginners. In fact, the bulk of the matter is simply an elaboration of the typewritten notes distributed to some of my laboratory classes in practical and applied bacteriology; consequently an attempt has been made to present the elements of bacteriological technique in their logical sequence.  I make no apology for the space devoted to illustrations, nearly all of which have been prepared especially for this volume; for a picture, if good, possesses a higher educational value and conveys a more accurate impression than a page of print; and even sketches of apparatus serve a distinct purpose in suggesting to the student those alterations and modifications which may be rendered necessary or advisable by the character of his laboratory equipment.  The excellent and appropriate terminology introduced by Chester in his recent work on \"Determinative Bacteriology\" I have adopted in its entirety, for I consider it only needs to be used to convince one of its extreme utility, whilst its inclusion in an elementary manual is calculated to induce in the student habits of accurate observation and concise description.  With the exception of Section XVII--\"Outlines for the Study of Pathogenic Bacteria\"--introduced with the idea of completing the volume from the point of view of the medical and dental student, the work has been arranged to allow of its use as a laboratory guide by the technical student generally, whether of brewing, dairying, or agriculture.  So alive am I to its many inperfections that it appears almost superfluous to state that the book is in no sense intended as a rival to the many and excellent manuals of bacteriology at present in use, but aims only at supplementing the usually scanty details of technique, and at instructing the student how to fit up and adapt apparatus for his daily work, and how to carry out thoroughly and systematically the various bacterioscopical analyses that are daily demanded of the bacteriologist by the hygienist.  Finally, it is with much pleasure that I acknowledge the valuable assistance received from my late assistant, Mr. J. B. Gall, A. I. C., in the preparation of the section dealing with the chemical products of bacterial life, and which has been based upon the work of Lehmann.      JOHN W. H. EYRE.      GUY'S HOSPITAL, S. E.
