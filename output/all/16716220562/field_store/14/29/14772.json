As early as the 16th century there was a belief in a <i>Terra australis</i> (to which was often added the epithet <i>incognita</i>), literally \"southern land,\" which was believed to be land lying round and stretching outwards from the South Pole.  In `Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia,' Sydney, Jan. 1892, is printed a paper read at the Geographical Congress at Berne, by E. Delmar Morgan, on the `Early Discovery of Australia.'  This paper is illustrated by maps taken from `Nordenskiold's Atlas.'  In a map by Orontius Finoeus, a French cosmographer of Provence, dated 1531, the <i>Terra australis</i> is shown as \"Terra Australis recenter inventa, sed nondum plene cognita.\"  In Ortelius' Map, 1570, it appears as \"Terra Australis nondum cognita.\"  In Gerard Mercator's Map, 1587, as \"Terra Australis\" simply.  In 1606 the Spaniard Fernandez de Quiros gave the name of <i>Terra Australis del Espiritu Santo</i> to land which he thought formed part of the Great Southland.  It is in fact one of the New Hebrides.  The word \"<i>Australian</i> \" is older than \"<i>Australia</i>\" (see quotations, 1693 and 1766).  The name <i>Australia</i> was adapted from the Latin name <i>Terra Australis</i>.  The earliest suggestion of the word is credited to Flinders, who certainly thought that he was inventing the name.  (See quotation, 1814.)  Twenty-one years earlier, however, the word is found (see quotation, 1793); and the passage containing it is the first known use of the word in print.  Shaw may thus be regarded as its inventor.  According to its title-page, the book quoted is by two authors, the <i>Zoology</i>, by Shaw and the <i>Botany</i> by Smith.  The <i>Botany</i>, however, was not published.  Of the two names--<i>Australia</i> and <i>Australasia</i>--suggested in the opening of the quotation, to take the place of New Holland, Shaw evidently favoured <i>Australia</i>, while Smith, in the `Transactions of the Linnaean Society,' vol. iv. p. 213 (1798), uses <i>Australasia</i> for the continent several times.  Neither name, however, passed then into general use.  In 1814, Robert Brown the Botanist speaks of \"<i>Terra Australis</i>,\" not of \"<i>Australia</i>.\" \"Australia\" was reinvented by Flinders.  <i>Quotations for \" Terra Australis\"</i>--  1621.  R. Burton, `Anatomy of Melancholy' (edition 1854), p. 56:  \"For the site, if you will needs urge me to it, I am not fully resolved, it may be in <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>, there is room enough (for of my knowledge, neither that hungry Spaniard nor Mercurius Britannicus have yet discovered half of it).\"  Ibid. p. 314:  \"<i>Terra Australis incognita</i>. ..and yet in likelihood it may be so, for without all question, it being extended from the tropic of Capricorn to the circle Antarctic, and lying as it doth in the temperate zone, cannot choose but yield in time some flourishing kingdoms to succeeding ages, as America did unto the Spaniards.\"  Ibid. p. 619:  \"But these are hard-hearted, unnatural, monsters of men, shallow politicians, they do not consider that a great part of the world is not yet inhabited as it ought, how many colonies into America, <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>, Africa may be sent?\"  <i>Early quotations for \"Australian</i>\"  1693.  `Nouveau Voyage de la Terre Australe, contenant les Coutumes et les Moeurs des Australiens, etc.'  Par Jaques Sadeur [Gabriel de Foigny].

It is in these savage regions however that Nature seems to have poured forth many of her most highly ornamented products with unusual liberality.\"  1814.  M.

This word, marked in `O.E.D.' and other Dictionaries as Australian, is provincial English.  In the `English Dialect Dictionary,' edited by Joseph Wright, Part I., the word is given as used in \"Ireland, Northamptonshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Hampshire and New Zealand.\"  It is also used in Essex.  1872.  C. H. Eden, `My Wife and I in Queensland,' p. 83:  \"In every milking yard is an apparatus for confining a cow's head called a `bail.'  This consists of an upright standiron, five feet in height, let into a framework, and about six inches from it another fixed at the heel, the upper part working freely in a slit, in which are holes for a peg, so that when the peg is out and the movable standiron is thrown back, there is abundance of room for a cow's head and horns, but when closed, at which time the two standirons are parallel to each other and six inches apart, though her neck can work freely up and down, it is impossible for her to withdraw her head . . .\"  1874.  W. M. B., `Narrative of Edward Crewe,' p. 225:  \"The former bovine female was a brute to manage, whom it would have been impossible to milk without a `bail.'  To what man or country the honour of this invention belongs, who can tell?  It is in very general use in the Australian colonies; and my advice to any one troubled with a naughty cow, who kicks like fury during the process of milking, is to have a bail constructed in their cow-house.\"  <hw>Bail up</hw>, <i>v</i>.  (1) To secure the head of a cow in a bail for milking.  (2) By transference, to stop travellers in the bush, used of bushrangers.  The quotation, 1888, shows the method of transference.  It then means generally, to stop.  Like the similar verb, <i>to stick up</i> (q.v.), it is often used humorously of a demand for subscriptions, etc.  1844.  Mrs. Chas. Meredith, `Notes and Sketches of New South Wales,' p. 132:  \"The bushrangers . . . walk quickly in, and `bail up,' i.e. bind with cords, or otherwise secure, the male portion.\"  1847.  Alex. "]]]
