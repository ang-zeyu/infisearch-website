I shall have to--Stop a moment,\" he growled softly as a puff of smoke spurted up and another bullet came dangerously near. \"That's the worst fellow, isn't he?\"  \"One's as bad as the other.  Lie close.\"  \"Can't lie any closer, old man.  Skin seems to be growing to the rock as it is.\"  _Crack_!  There was another shot, the puff of smoke rising from close alongside the former one which Dickenson had seen.  \"I say,\" he cried, \"which of us are they firing at?\"  \"Both, I expect,\" said Lennox.  \"They're sheltered by the same rock; one fires from one side, the other from the second.  I can't touch them. Try at once.\"  \"Don't you hurry me, or I shall muff it, old man,\" said Dickenson coolly.  \"I want a better chance.  There's nothing but a bit of wideawake to fire at now.--Ha!  Lie still.  He's reaching out to fire at me, I think.\"  Dickenson's rifle spurted, and their enemy's was like an echo; but the muzzle of the Boer's piece was suddenly jerked upward, and the bullet had an opportunity of proving how far a Mauser rifle would carry with a high trajectory.  \"Thanks, old fellow,\" said Lennox.  \"That has halved the risk.  Perhaps the other fellow will think it too dangerous to stay.\"  \"Doesn't seem like it,\" said Dickenson, drawing in his breath sharply and clapping his left hand to his ear.  \"Don't say you're hit, Bob!\" cried Lennox in an agonised tone.  \"All right; I won't if you don't want me to.\"  \"But are you?\"  \"I suppose so.  There's a bit taken out of my left ear, and I can feel something trickling down inside my collar.\"  \"Oh Bob, old fellow!\" cried Lennox.  \"Lie still, man!  What are you going to do?\"  \"Bind up the place.\"  \"You won't if you stir.\"  There was pretty good proof of this, for another shot whizzed between them.  But he who sent it had been too venturesome in taking aim to revenge his comrade's fall, and the result of Dickenson's return shot was fatal, for he too sprang up into a kneeling posture, and they saw him for a few moments trying to rise to his feet, but only to fall over to the left, right in view of the two officers.  Drew uttered a sigh of relief.  \"If we are to escape,\" he said, \"we must stop any one from getting into that position again.\"  \"Look sharp, then,\" said Dickenson, whose keen eyes detected a movement on the other side of the river.  \"There's a chap creeping among the bushes on all fours.\"  \"I see him,\" cried Drew; and as he followed the enemy's movements and took aim, Dickenson, who was in the better position for commanding them, followed his example.  \"Missed!\" cried Drew angrily as he fired and the Boer raised a hand and waved it derisively.  \"Hit!\" exclaimed Dickenson the next instant.  For he too had fired, and with better aim, the Boer drawing himself together, springing up, and turning to run, but only to stagger the next minute and fall heavily among the bushes, which hid him from sight.  \"Now for the next,\" continued Dickenson, coolly reloading.  \"Look out; I'm going to watch the other end.\"  He turned sharply as a fresh shower of bullets came scattering around them, and looked keenly at the granite rock and its burden, half-expecting to see a fresh occupant taking aim.  But apparently no one seemed disposed to expose himself anew to the rifles of such deadly shots, and the terrible peril to which the two fishermen had been exposed ceased for the time being, though the pair waited in momentary expectation of its recurrence.  But the enemy did not slacken their efforts to finish their task by easier means, and the firing from the front went on more briskly than ever, the young officers contenting themselves with holding theirs and displaying no excitement now, their shelter, so long as they lay close, being sufficient, the worst befalling them now being a sharp rap from a scrap of stone struck from the rocks, or the fall of a half-flattened bullet.  \"That's right; don't fire until we are in an emergency,\" said Drew at the end of a few minutes.  \"In a what?\" cried Dickenson.  \"In regular peril.\"  \"Why, what do you call this?\" cried Dickenson, with a laugh.  \"I made my will half-an-hour ago--in fancy, of course.\"  \"Well, it is a hot corner,\" said Drew, joining in his companion's grim mirth; \"but we haven't got to the worst of it yet.\"  \"What!\" yelled Dickenson.  \"Oh Drew, old man, you are about the coolest fish in the regiment.  It can't be worse than it has been.\"  \"Can't it?  Wait a few minutes, and the party who made for the ford will be at us.\"  \"But they can't get their horses down the way we came.\"  \"No; but they can leave them with a fourth of their fellows to hold while they get somewhere within shot, and then we're done.  What do you say to tying a handkerchief to a rifle-barrel and holding it up?  We've held out well.\"  \"Nothing!  What do you say?\"  \"Same as you do; but I thought I'd give you the option if you did not feel as obstinate as I do.\"  \"Obstinate?  I don't call it obstinate to hold out now.  I've seen too many of our poor lads carried to the rear.  Here,\" continued the speaker, after feeling, \"I haven't used half my cartridges yet.  Ask me again when they're all gone, and then I'll tell you the idea I've got.\"  \"What is it?  Tell me now.\"  \"Very well.  We'll fire the last cartridge at the cowardly brutes--fifty at least to two--and then give them a surprise.\"  \"What! walk out and hold up your hands?\"  \"No; that would be a surprise, of course; but I've got a better.\"  \"Let's have it.\"  \"Walk in.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Well, crawl, then, into the river.  Get quietly in from behind some of the overhanging bushes, and float down with the stream.\"  \"Wouldn't do, Bobby; they wouldn't trust us.  They'd see us floating.\"  \"They'd think we were dead.\"  \"Not they.  The Boers are too slim, as they call it, and would pump a few bullets into us.  Besides, I have no fancy for being dragged down by a crocodile or grabbed by a hippo.\"  \"Think there are any crocs?\"  \"Plenty in some of the rivers.\"  \"But the hippos, wouldn't touch us, would they?\"  \"Very likely.  They don't hesitate about seizing a canoe and crunching it in two.  No, your plan won't do, lad.  I'd rather die ashore here.\"  \"Dry?\" said Dickenson quietly.  \"Well, I dare say it would be nicer. But there, we're not quite cornered yet.\"  _Crack_ went a bullet overhead, and a report came from a fresh direction almost simultaneously.  \"Wrong!\" said Drew coolly.  \"We are cornered now.  That's the first shot from the men who have crossed to our side.\"  \"All right; I'm ready for them.  Let's finish our cartridges.\"  \"We will, Bob,\" said Drew quite calmly, in spite of their extremity.  \"What do you want?\" said Dickenson.  \"You haven't used all your cartridges?\"  \"No; only about half.\"  \"Then why did you hold out your hand?\"  \"Shake!  In case,\" said Drew laconically.  \"Sha'n't!  I'm not going to look upon the business as having come to that pitch yet.  Look out; we ought to see some of them soon.\"  For shots were beginning to come about them to supplement those sent from across the river, but so ill directed that it was evident that their fresh assailants were guessing at their position below the perpendicular cliff-like bank.  \"This won't hurt us,\" said Dickenson coolly.  \"No; but some of them will be having their heads over the edge up there directly.\"  \"They can't while their friends are firing from the other side as they are.  But when they do look down it will be rather awkward for the first two.\"  \"Here, quick, look out, Bob!\" cried Lennox, for the firing from the farther bank suddenly ceased, and the rustling and cracking of twigs somewhere overhead told that the fresh danger was very near.  Dickenson's reply to his companion's order was to place himself quickly with his back to the rocks that had sheltered him, sitting with his rifle pointing upward.  Drew took the same position, and none too soon; for, following closely upon the rustling sound, the makers of which were still invisible, a couple of shots were fired down at them, the bullets striking the stones just over their heads.  No reply was made, for the enemy were quite hidden, and with beating hearts the two young Englishmen waited in horrible suspense for their chance--one which never came; for directly after quite a volley was fired, apparently from some distance back from the edge, and, to Drew's horror, a big burly Boer seemed to leap down from the top of the cliff to seize them for prisoners.  That was his first surmise.  The next moment he knew the truth, for with a heavy thud the man struck the stones, falling sidewise, and then turned over upon his face, to lie with his limbs quivering slightly for a few moments before he lay perfectly still.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted Dickenson, springing to his feet.  \"Down! down!\" roared Drew, snatching at his brother officer's arm.  But the need for caution was at an end, for volley after volley came rolling down into the river-bed, and proof of help being at hand was given by the rapid firing of the Boers on the other side of the river, a duel on a large scale being kept up for some ten minutes before the firing on the far side ceased.  \"Whopped!\" shouted Dickenson excitedly.  \"Look! look!\" he cried, pointing down the river and across at an open spot where some dozens of the enemy were streaming away, galloping as hard as their little Bechuana ponies could go, but not escaping scatheless, four saddles being emptied by the fire from the cliff above the watchers' heads.  \"I wonder whether the other men who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27897"],["title","The Kopje Garrison: A Story of the Boer War (#4)"],["body","have escaped,\" said Drew thoughtfully, as he took his whistle from his cross-belt and held it ready to blow.  \"Take it for granted they have, my son,\" said Dickenson.  \"They really are clever at that sort of thing.  I say, I'm glad I didn't go through that performance.\"  \"What performance?\" said Drew wonderingly.  \"Hand-shaking in that sentimental way.\"  \"It wouldn't have done you any harm.\"  \"Perhaps not; but, I say, don't stand fiddling about with that whistle. Blow, man, blow, and let the lads know where we are.  I don't want to be shot now by our own men: too degrading, that.\"  Drew placed the whistle to his lips, and the shrill, penetrating, chirruping call rang out, while Dickenson stood looking upward towards the top of the bank.    Then Robin he put him his horn to his mouth   And a blast he did loudly blow,   While quick at the call his merry men all   Came tripping along in a row!  He half-hummed, half-sang the old lines in a pleasant baritone voice, and then listened.  \"Don't see many _merry men_ tripping--poor, hungry beggars!  Blow again, Drew, old man.  Why don't they stop firing?\"  Drew blew again, and, to the intense satisfaction of both, the whistle was answered from among the trees above.  \"Ahoy there!  Where are you?\"  \"Here! here!\" shouted the young officers together.  \"Cease firing!\" came now in a familiar voice, and the shots died out.  \"It's Roby,\" said Drew eagerly.  \"Never liked him so well before,\" said Dickenson, laughing.  \"Ahoy! We're coming up.\"  \"Oh, there you are!\" came from above, and a good, manly, sun-tanned face was thrust over the edge of the cliff.  \"All right?\"  \"Yes!  Yes!\" was the reply.  \"That's better than I expected, lads,\" cried the officer.  \"Does one good.  I thought we were avenging your death.  Well,\"--the speaker's face expanded into a broad grin--\"it's getting on towards dinner-time. What have you caught?\"  \"Tartars!\" growled Drew shortly.  \"Yes,\" said Dickenson; \"a regular mess.\"  The Kopje Garrison--by George Manville Fenn    CHAPTER THREE.  ON THE QUI VIVE.  \"So it seems,\" said the officer above.  \"But hullo, you!  You're wounded.\"  \"Pooh! stuff!\" said Dickenson shortly; \"bit picked out of my ear.\"  \"But,\"--began the head of the rescue party.  \"Let it be,\" said Dickenson snappishly as he pressed his hand to the injured place.  \"If I don't howl about it, I'm sure you needn't.\"  \"Very well, old fellow, I will not.  Ugh! what's that down there--that fellow dead?\"  The officer leaned out as far as he could so as to get a good look at the motionless figure at the foot of the cliff.  Drew glanced at the figure too, and nodded his head.  \"Who shot him--you or Dickenson?\"  \"Neither of us,\" said Drew gravely.  \"It was the work of one of your fellows; he fell from up there.  But what about the party who crossed by the ford?\"  \"Oh, we've accounted for them.  Cut them off from the ford and surrounded them.  Fifteen, and bagged the lot, horses and all.\"  \"You were a precious long time coming, though, Roby,\" grumbled Dickenson.  \"We seem to have been firing here all day.\"  \"That's gratitude!\" said the officer.  \"We came as quickly as we could. Nice job, too, to advance on a gang well under cover and double covered by the strong body across the river.  There must have been sixty or seventy of them; but,\" added the captain meaningly, \"sixty or seventy have not gone back.  How many do you think are down?  We've accounted for a dozen, I should say, _hors de combat_.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Drew shortly, \"and don't want to.\"  \"What do you say, Dickenson?\" asked the captain.  \"The same as Lennox here.\"  \"Come, come, speak out and don't be so thin-skinned.  We've got to report to Lindley.\"  \"Six haven't moved since,\" said Dickenson, looking uneasy now that the excitement of the fight was at an end; \"and I should say twice as many more wounded.\"  \"Serve 'em right.  Their own fault,\" said the captain.  It was decided to be too risky a proceeding to cross the river, for the Boers were certain to be only a short distance away, sheltered in some advantageous position, waiting to try and retrieve their dead and wounded; so a small party was posted by the ford to guard against any crossing of the river, and then the prisoners were marched off towards the village a couple of miles distant, where the detachment of infantry and mounted men had been holding the Boers across the river in check for some weeks past.  A few shots followed them from a distance at first; but the enemy had received quite as much punishment as they desired upon that occasion, and soon ceased the aggressive, being eager for a truce to communicate with the little rear-guard posted in the scrub by the river so as to recover their wounded and dead.  On the way back to the village the two young officer's had to relate in full their experience, which was given in a plain, unvarnished way; and then as a sharp descent was reached, and the rescued officers caught sight of the well-guarded prisoners marching on foot, their Bechuana ponies having been appropriated by their captors, Dickenson began to grow sarcastic.  \"Glad you've made such a nice lot of prisoners, Roby,\" he said.  \"Thanks,\" said the officer addressed, smiling contentedly.  \"Not so bad--eh?  The colonel will be delighted.  Nice useful lot of ponies-- eh?\"  \"Ye-es.  The old man must be delighted.  We're all about starving, and you're taking him about a score more mouths to feed.\"  \"Eh?\" cried the captain, aghast.  \"Why, of course; I never thought of that.\"  \"Dickenson did,\" said Lennox, laughing.  \"A thing like this touches him to the heart--I mean lower down.\"  \"You hold your tongue, my fine fellow,\" growled Dickenson.  \"You're as bad as I am.  I don't like the fighting, but I'm ready to do my share if you'll only feed me well.  I feel as if I'd been losing flesh for weeks.\"  \"And done you good,\" said Lennox seriously.  \"You were much too fat.\"  \"Look here, Drew,\" growled the young man addressed; \"do you want to quarrel?\"  \"Certainly not,\" was the reply.  \"I've had quite enough for one day.\"  Further conversation was prevented by their approach to the village, which was built at the foot of a precipitous kopje, the spot having been chosen originally for its fertility consequent upon the fact that a copious spring of fresh water rose high up among the rocks to form the little stream and gully at whose mouth the young officers had met with their fishing experience.  This village, known as Groenfontein, had been held now for nearly two months by the little force, the idea being that it was to be occupied for a day at the most, and vacated after the Boers had been driven off. But though this had been done at once, the enemy had, as Drew Lennox said, a disgracefully unmilitary way of coming back after they had been thoroughly beaten.  They had come back here after the driving; others had come to help them from east, west, north, and south, and as soon as they were strengthened they had set to work to drive the British force away or capture it _en bloc_; but that was quite another thing.  For, as Dickenson said, the colonel's instructions were to drive and not be driven.  So the Boers were driven as often as there was a chance; and then, as they kept on returning, the force had to stay, and did so, getting plenty of opportunities for making fresh drives, till the colonel felt that it was all labour in vain and waste of time.  Under these circumstances he sent messengers explaining the position and asking for instructions.  But his despatches did not seem to have been delivered, for no orders came to him, and their bearers did not return. Consequently, like a sturdy British officer, he fell back upon his first command to hold the Boers in check at Groenfontein, soon finding that they held him in check as well, for even had he felt disposed to retire, it would have been impossible except at the cost of losing half his men; so he held on and waited for the relief which he felt would sooner or later come.  But it did not come sooner, and he relied on the later, making the best of things.  Colonel Lindley's way of making the best of things was to return a contemptuous reply to the demands made from time to time for his surrender.  The first time this demand was made was when the enemy had him in front and rear.  The envoys who came informed him that his position was perfectly hopeless, for he could not cross the river in face of the strong body the Boers had lining the banks; and that they had him in front, and if his people did not give up their arms they would be shot down to a man.  The colonel's answer to this was, \"Very well, gentlemen; shoot away.\"  His officers were present, and Drew Lennox and Bob Dickenson exchanged glances at the word \"gentlemen,\" for the embassy looked like anything but that; and they departed in an insolent, braggart way, and very soon after began to shoot, using up a great many cartridges, but doing very little harm.  Then, growing weary, they gave up, and the colonel set one part of his men to work with the spade till dark, making rifle-pit and trench; while as soon as it was dark he despatched fully half of his force to occupy the precipitous mound at the back of the village, making a natural stronghold which he intended to connect with the camp by means of stone walls the next day, having a shrewd notion that if he did not the Boers would, for the mound commanded the place, and would soon make it untenable.  Captain Roby's company and another were sent to this duty, and the men were carefully posted--Lennox and Dickenson on the highest part, which was naturally the most windy and cold.  Their orders, which they conveyed to the men, were to keep the strictest lookout, though the enemy had retired far enough away; for the Boers had at that early period of the war already acquired the credit of being slim and clever at ambush and night attack.  But the night was well advanced, and the two friends, after visiting post after post,"]]]
