But see how the two things apply to each other. I have always noticed that people’s ideas run parallel. And so, observe this phenomenon, D’Artagnan. I was talking to you of Mouston, who is fat, and it led us on to Madame du Vallon--”  “Who was thin?”  “Hum! Is it not marvelous?”  “My dear friend, a _savant_ of my acquaintance, M. Costar, has made the same observation as you have, and he calls the process by some Greek name which I forget.”  “What! my remark is not then original?” cried Porthos, astounded. “I thought I was the discoverer.”  “My friend, the fact was known before Aristotle’s days--that is to say, nearly two thousand years ago.”  “Well, well, ‘tis no less true,” said Porthos, delighted at the idea of having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest sages of antiquity.  “Wonderfully--but suppose we return to Mouston. It seems to me, we have left him fattening under our very eyes.”  “Yes, monsieur,” said Mouston.  “Well,” said Porthos, “Mouston fattened so well, that he gratified all my hopes, by reaching my standard; a fact of which I was well able to convince myself, by seeing the rascal, one day, in a waistcoat of mine, which he had turned into a coat--a waistcoat, the mere embroidery of which was worth a hundred pistoles.”  “‘Twas only to try it on, monsieur,” said Mouston.  “From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my tailors, and to have him measured instead of myself.”  “A capital idea, Porthos; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than you.”  “Exactly! They measured him down to the ground, and the end of the skirt came just below my knee.”  “What a marvelous man you are, Porthos! Such a thing could happen only to you.”  “Ah! yes; pay your compliments; you have ample grounds to go upon. It was exactly at that time--that is to say, nearly two years and a half ago--that I set out for Belle-Isle, instructing Mouston (so as always to have, in every event, a pattern of every fashion) to have a coat made for himself every month.”  “And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions? Ah! that was anything but right, Mouston.”  “No, monsieur, quite the contrary; quite the contrary!”  “No, he never forgot to have his coats made; but he forgot to inform me that he had got stouter!”  “But it was not my fault, monsieur! your tailor never told me.”  “And this to such an extent, monsieur,” continued Porthos, “that the fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth, and so my last dozen coats are all too large, from a foot to a foot and a half.”  “But the rest; those which were made when you were of the same size?”  “They are no longer the fashion, my dear friend. Were I to put them on, I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam; and as though I had been two years away from court.”  “I understand your difficulty. You have how many new suits? nine? thirty-six? and yet not one to wear. Well, you must have a thirty-seventh made, and give the thirty-six to Mouston.”  “Ah! monsieur!” said Mouston, with a gratified air. “The truth is, that monsieur has always been very generous to me.”  “Do you mean to insinuate that I hadn’t that idea, or that I was deterred by the expense? But it wants only two days to the _fete_; I received the invitation yesterday; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe, and only this morning discovered my misfortune; and from now till the day after to-morrow, there isn’t a single fashionable tailor who will undertake to make me a suit.”  “That is to say, one covered all over with gold, isn’t it?”  “I wish it so! undoubtedly, all over.”  “Oh, we shall manage it. You won’t leave for three days. The invitations are for Wednesday, and this is only Sunday morning.”  “‘Tis true; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four hours beforehand.”  “How, Aramis?”  “Yes, it was Aramis who brought me the invitation.”  “Ah! to be sure, I see. You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet?”  “By no means! by the king, dear friend. The letter bears the following as large as life: ‘M. le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list--’”  “Very good; but you leave with M. Fouquet?”  “And when I think,” cried Porthos, stamping on the floor, “when I think I shall have no clothes, I am ready to burst with rage! I should like to strangle somebody or smash something!”  “Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything, Porthos; I will manage it all; put on one of your thirty-six suits, and come with me to a tailor.”  “Pooh! my agent has seen them all this morning.”  “Even M. Percerin?”  “Who is M. Percerin?”  “Oh! only the king’s tailor!”  “Oh, ah, yes,” said Porthos, who wished to appear to know the king’s tailor, but now heard his name mentioned for the first time; “to M. Percerin’s, by Jove! I was afraid he would be too busy.”  “Doubtless he will be; but be at ease, Porthos; he will do for me what he wouldn’t do for another. Only you must allow yourself to be measured!”  “Ah!” said Porthos, with a sigh, “‘tis vexatious, but what would you have me do?”  “Do? As others do; as the king does.”  “What! do they measure the king, too? does he put up with it?”  “The king is a beau, my good friend, and so are you, too, whatever you may say about it.”  Porthos smiled triumphantly. “Let us go to the king’s tailor,” he said; “and since he measures the king, I think, by my faith, I may do worse than allow him to measure _me!_”    Chapter III. Who Messire Jean Percerin Was.  The king’s tailor, Messire Jean Percerin, occupied a rather large house in the Rue St. Honore, near the Rue de l’Arbre Sec. He was a man of great taste in elegant stuffs, embroideries, and velvets, being hereditary tailor to the king. The preferment of his house reached as far back as the time of Charles IX.; from whose reign dated, as we know, fancy in _bravery_ difficult enough to gratify. The Percerin of that period was a Huguenot, like Ambrose Pare, and had been spared by the Queen of Navarre, the beautiful Margot, as they used to write and say, too, in those days; because, in sooth, he was the only one who could make for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear, seeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical defects, which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal. Percerin being saved, made, out of gratitude, some beautiful black bodices, very inexpensively indeed, for Queen Catherine, who ended by being pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people, on whom she had long looked with detestation. But Percerin was a very prudent man; and having heard it said that there was no more dangerous sign for a Protestant than to be smiled up on by Catherine, and having observed that her smiles were more frequent than usual, he speedily turned Catholic with all his family; and having thus become irreproachable, attained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of France. Under Henry III., gay king as he was, this position was as grand as the height of one of the loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras. Now Percerin had been a clever man all his life, and by way of keeping up his reputation beyond the grave, took very good care not to make a bad death of it, and so contrived to die very skillfully; and that at the very moment he felt his powers of invention declining. He left a son and a daughter, both worthy of the name they were called upon to bear; the son, a cutter as unerring and exact as the square rule; the daughter, apt at embroidery, and at designing ornaments. The marriage of Henry IV. and Marie de Medici, and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen, together with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere, king of the _beaux_ of the period, made the fortune of the second generation of Percerins. M. Concino Concini, and his wife Galligai, who subsequently shone at the French court, sought to Italianize the fashion, and introduced some Florentine tailors; but Percerin, touched to the quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem, entirely defeated these foreigners, and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his compatriots, and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would never employ any other, and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre.  And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin’s workshop, which the Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human body it contained. Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown Percerin, the king, Louis XIII., had the generosity to bear no malice to his tailor, and to retain him in his service. At the time that Louis the Just afforded this great example of equity, Percerin had brought up two sons, one of whom made his _debut_ at the marriage of Anne of Austria, invented that admirable Spanish costume, in which Richelieu danced a saraband, made the costumes for the tragedy of “Mirame,” and stitched on to Buckingham’s mantle those famous pearls which were destined to be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre. A man becomes easily notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham, a M. de Cinq-Mars, a Mademoiselle Ninon, a M. de Beaufort, and a Marion de Lorme. And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory when his father died. This same Percerin III., old, famous and wealthy, yet further dressed Louis XIV.; and having no son, which was a great cause of sorrow to him, seeing that with himself his dynasty would end, he had brought up several hopeful pupils. He possessed a carriage, a country house, men-servants the tallest in Paris; and by special authority from Louis XIV., a pack of hounds. He worked for MM. de Lyonne and Letellier,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27595"],["title","Eight Keys to Eden (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net          EIGHT KEYS TO EDEN     BY MARK CLIFTON    NOVELS        Eight Keys To Eden        They'd Rather Be Right*        The Forever Machine*   NON-FICTION BOOK        Opportunity Unlimited   NOVELETTES        Remembrance and Reflection        How Allied        What Thin Partitions**        Sense From Thought Divide        Star, Bright        Hide!

His finger hesitated over the key reluctantly, then he gritted his teeth and pressed it down. The supervisor came boiling out of his cubicle, half-running down the long aisle between the forty operators hunched over their panels.  \"What is it? What is it?\" he quarreled, even before he came to a stop.  \"Eden's due. Overdue.\" The operator tried to make it laconic, but it came out sullen.  The supervisor rubbed his forehead with his knuckles and punched irritably at some buttons on an astrocalculator. An up-to-the-second star map lit up the big screen at the end of the room. He didn't expect there to be any occlusions to interfere with the communications channel. The astrophysicists didn't set up reporting schedules to include such blunders. But he had to check.  There weren't.  He heaved a sigh of exasperation. Trouble always had to come on his shift, never anybody else's.  \"Lazy colonists probably neglecting to check in on time,\" he rationalized cynically to the operator. He rubbed his long nose and hoped the operator would agree that's all it was.  The operator looked skeptical instead.  Eden was still under the first five-year test. Five-year experimental colonists were arrogant, they were zany, they were a lot of things, some unprintable, which qualified them for being test colonizers and nothing else apparently. They were almost as much of a problem as the Extrapolators.  But they weren't lazy. They didn't forget.  \"Some fool ship captain has probably messed up communications by inserting a jump band of his own.\" The supervisor hopefully tried out another idea. Even to him it sounded weak. A jump band didn't last more than an instant, and no ship captain would risk his license by using the E frequency, anyway.  He looked hopefully down the long room at the bent heads of the other operators at their panels. None was signaling an emergency to draw him away from this; give him an excuse to leave in the hope the problem would have solved itself by the time he could get back to it. He chewed on a knuckle and stared angrily at the operator who was sitting back, relaxed, looking at him, waiting.  \"You sure you're tuned to the right frequency for Eden?\" the supervisor asked irritably. \"You sure your equipment is working?\"  The operator pulled a wry mouth, shrugged, and didn't bother to answer with more than a nod. He allowed a slight expression of contempt for supervisors who asked silly questions to show. He caught the surreptitious wink of the operator at the next panel, behind the supervisor's back. The disturbance was beginning to attract attention. In response to the wink he pulled the dogged expression of the unjustly nagged employee over his features.  \"Well, why don't you give Eden an alert, then!\" the supervisor muttered savagely. \"Blast them out of their seats. Make 'em get off their--their pants out there!\"  The operator showed an expression which plainly said it was about time, and reached over to press down the emergency key. He held it down. Eleven light-years away, if one had to depend upon impossibly slow three-dimensional space time, a siren which could be heard for ten miles in Eden's atmosphere should be blaring.  The supervisor stood and watched while he transferred the gnawing at his knuckles to his fingernails.  He waited, with apprehensive satisfaction, for some angry colonist to come through and scream at them to turn off that unprintable-phrases siren. He braced himself and worked up some choice phrases of his own to scream back at the colonist for neglecting his duty--getting Extrapolation Headquarters here on Earth all worked up over nothing. He wondered if he dared threaten to send an Extrapolator out there to check them over.  He decided the threat would have no punch. An E would pay no attention to his recommendation. He knew it, and the colonist would know it too.  He began to wonder what excuse the colonist would have.  \"Just wanted to see if you home-office boys were on your toes,\" the insolent colonist would drawl. Probably something like that.  He hoped the right words wouldn't fail him.  But there was no response to the siren.  \"Lock the key down,\" he told the operator. \"Keep it blasting until they wake up.\"  He looked down the room and saw that a couple of the near operators were now frankly listening.  \"Get on with your work,\" he said loudly. \"Pay attention to what you're recording.\"  It was enough to cause several more heads to raise.  \"Now, now, now!\" he chattered to the room at large. \"This is nothing to concern the rest of you. Just a delayed report, that's all. Haven't you ever heard of a delayed report before?\"  He shouldn't have asked that, because of course they had. It was like asking a mountain climber if he had ever felt a taut rope over the razor edge of a precipice suddenly go slack.  \"But there's nothing any of you can do,\" he said. He tried to cover the plaintive note by adding, \"And if you louse up your own messages ...\" But he had threatened them so often that there was no longer any menace.  He spent the next ten minutes hauling out the logs of Eden to see if they'd ever been tardy before. The logs covered two and a fraction years, two years and four months. The midgit-idgit scanner didn't pick up a single symbol to show that Eden had been even two seconds off schedule. The first year daily, the second year weekly, and now monthly. There wasn't a single hiccough from the machine to kick out an Extrapolator's signal to watch for anything unusual.  Eden heretofore had presented about as much of an _outré_ problem as an Iowa cornfield.  \"You're really sure your equipment is working?\" he asked again as he came back to stand behind the operator's chair. \"They haven't answered yet.\"  The operator shrugged again. It was pretty obvious the colonists hadn't answered. And what should he do about it? Go out there personally and shake his finger at them--naughty, naughty?  \"Well why don't you bounce a beam on the planet's surface, to see?\" the supervisor grumbled. \"I want to see an echo. I want to see for myself that you haven't let your equipment go sour. Or maybe there's a space hurricane between here and there. Or maybe a booster has blown. Or maybe some star has exploded and warped things. Maybe ... Well, bounce it, man. Bounce it! What are you waiting for?\"  \"Okay, okay!\" the operator grumbled back. \"I was waiting for you to give the order.\" He grimaced at the operator behind the supervisor. \"I can't just go bouncing beams on planets if I happen to be in the mood.\"  \"Now, now. Now, now. No insubordination, if you please,\" the supervisor cautioned.  Together they waited, in growing dread, for the automatic relays strung out through space to take hold, automatically calculating the route, set up the required space-jump bands. It was called instantaneous communication, but that was only relative. It took time.  The supervisor was frowning deeply now. He hated to report to the sector chief that an emergency had"]]]
