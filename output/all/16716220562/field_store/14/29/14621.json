He only thought of himself as the blameless victim of a woman's fickleness.  The bitter things he had read and heard of the sex's inconstancy rose in his mind, as acrid bile sometimes ascends in one's throat.  “Here,” he said to himself, “is an instance of feminine perfidy equal to anything that Byron ever sneered at.  This girl, who was so proud to receive my attentions a little while ago, and who so gladly accepted me for her promised husband, now turns away at the slightest cloud of disapproval falling upon me.  And to think, too, how I have given her all my heart, and lavished upon her a love as deep and true as ever a man gave a woman.”  He was sure that he had been so badly used as to have sufficient grounds for turning misanthrope and woman-hater.  Thin natures are like light wines and weak syrups in the readiness with which they sour.  The moon had risen as it did on that eventful betrothal-night. Again the stars had sunk from sight in the sea of silver splendor rolling from the round, full orb.  Again the roadway down the hill lay like a web of fine linen, bleaching upon an emerald meadow. Again the clear waters of the Miami rippled in softly merry music over the white limestone of their shallow bed.  Again the river, winding through the pleasant valley, framed in gently rising hill-sides, appeared as  great silver ribbon, decorating a mass of heavily-embroidered green velvet.  Again Sardis lay at the foot of the hills, its coarse and common place outlines softened into glorious symmetry by the moonlight's wondrous witchery.  He stopped for a moment and glanced at the old apple-tree, under which they had stood when   “Their spirits rushed together at the meeting of their lips.”   But its raiment of odorous blossoms was gone.  Instead, it bore a load of shapeless, sour, unripened fruit.  Instead of the freshling springing grass, at its foot was now a coarse stubble.  Instead of the delicately sweet breath of violets and fruit blooms scenting the evening air came the heavy, persistent perfume of tuberoses, and the mawkish scent of gaudy poppies.  “Bah, it smells like a funeral,” he said, and he turned away and walked slowly down the hill.  “And it is one.  My heart and all my hopes lie buried at the foot of that old apple-tree.”  It had been suggested that much of the sympathy we lavish upon martyrs is wanton waste, because to many minds, if not in fact to all, there is a positive pleasure in considering oneself a martyr. More absolute truth is contained in this than appears at the first blush.  There are very few who do not roll under their tongues as a sweet morsel the belief that their superior goodness or generosity has brought them trouble and affliction from envious and wicked inferiors.  So the honey that mingled with the gall and hysop of Harry Glen's humiliation was the martyr feeling that his holiest affections had been ruthlessly trampled upon by a cold-hearted woman.  His desultory readings of Byron furnished his imagination with all the woful suits and trappings necessary to trick himself out as a melancholy hero.  On his way home he had to pass the principal hotel in the place, the front of which on Summer evenings was the Sardis forum for the discussion of national politics and local gossip.  As he approached quietly along the grassy walk he overheard his own name used.  He stepped back into the shadow of a large maple and listened:  “Yes, I seen him as he got off the train,” said Nels Hathaway, big, fat, lazy, and the most inveterate male gossip in the village. “And he is looking mighty well--yes, MIGHTY well.  I said to Tom Botkins, here, 'what a wonderful consitution Harry Glen has, to be sure, to stand the hardships of the field so well.'”  The sarcasm was so evident that Harry's blood seethed.  The Tim Botkins alluded to had been dubbed by Basil Wurmset, the cynic and wit of the village, “apt appreciation's artful aid.”  Red-haired, soft eyed, moon-faced, round of belly and lymphatic of temperament, his principal occupation in life was to play  fiddle in the Sardis string-band, and in the intervals of professional engagements at dances and picnics, to fill one of the large splint-bottomed chairs in front of the hotel with his pulpy form, and receive the smart or bitter sayings of the loungers there with a laught that began before any one else's, and lasted after the others had gotten through.  His laugh alone was as good as that of all the rest of the crowd.  It was not a hearty, resonant laugh, like that from the mouth of a strong-lunged, wholesome-natured man, which has the mellow roundness of a solo on a French horn.  It was a slovenly, greasy, convictionless laugh, with uncertain tones and ill-defined edges.  Its effect was due to its volume, readiness, and long continuance.  Swelling up of the puffy form, and reddening ripples of the broad face heralded it, it began with a contagious cackle, it deepened into a flabby guffaw, and after all the others roundabout had finished their cachinnatory tribute it wound up with what was between a roar and the lazy drone of a bagpipe.  It now rewarded Nels Hathaway's irony, and the rest of the loungers joined in.  Encouraged, Nels continued, as its last echoes died away:  “Yes, he's just as spry and pert as anybody.  He seems to have recovered entirely from all his wounds; none of 'em have disfiggered him any, and his nerves have got over their terrible strain.”  Tim ran promptly through all the notes in his diapason, and the rest joined in on the middle register.  “Well, I'm not at all surprised,” said Mr. Oldunker, a bitter States' Rights Democrat, and the oracle of his party.  “I told you how it'd be from the first.  Harry Glen was one of them Wide-Awakes that marched around on pleasant evenings last Fall with oil-cloth capes and kerosene lamps.  I told you that those fellows'd be no where when the war they were trying to bring on came.  I'm not at all astonished that he showed himself lily-livered when he found the people that he was willing to rob of their property standing ready to fight for their homes and their slaves.”  “Ready to shoot into a crowd of unsuspecting men, you mean,” sneered Basil Wurmset, “and then break their own cursed necks when they saw a little cold steel coming their way.”  Tim came in promptly with his risible symphony.  “Well, they didn't run away from any cold steel that Harry Glen displayed,” sneered Oldunker.  Tim's laugh was allegro and crescendo at the first, and staccato at the close.  “You seem to forget that Capt. Bob Bennett was a Wide-Awake, too,”  retorted Wurmset, “though you might have remembered it from his having threatened to lick you for encouraging the boys to stone the lamps in the procession.”  Tim cackled, gurgled and roared.  Nels Hathaway had kept silent as long as he could.  He must put his oar into the conversational tide.  “I'd give six bits,” he said, “to know how the meeting between him and Rachel Bond passes off.  He's gone up to the house.  The boys seen him, all dressed up his best.  But his finery and his perfumed hankerchiefs won't count anything with her, I can tell YOU.  She comes of fighting stock, if ever a woman did.  The Bonds and Harringtons--her mother's people--are game breeds, both of 'em, and stand right on their record, every time.  She'll have precious little traffic with a white-feathered fellow.  I think she's been preparing for him the coldest shoulder any young feller in Sardis's got for many a long day.”  There was nothing very funny in this speech, but a good deal of risible matter had accumulated in Tim's diaphragm during its delivery which he had to get rid of, and he did.  Harry had heard enough.  While Tim's laugh yet resounded he walked away unnoticed, and taking a roundabout course gained his room. There he remained a week, hardly coming down to his meals.  It was a terrible week for him, for every waking hour of it he walked through the valley of humiliation, and drank the bitter waters of shame.  The joints of his hitherto impenetrable armor of self-conceit had been so pierced by the fine rapier thrusts of Rachel's scorn that it fell from him under the coarse pounding of the village loungers and left him naked and defenseless to their blows.  Every nerve and sense ached with acute pain.  He now felt all of his father's humiliation, all his mother's querulous sorrow, all his betrothed's anguish and abasement.  Thoughts of suicide, and of flying to some part of the country where he was entirely unknown, crowded upon him incessantly.  But with that perversity that nature seemingly delights in, there had arisen in his heart since he had lost her, such a love for Rachel Bond as made life without her, or without her esteem even, seem valueless.  To go into a strange part of the country and begin life anew would be to give her up forever, and this he could not do.  It would be much preferable to die demonstrating that he was in some degree worthy of her.  And a latent manly pride awakened and came to his assistance.  He could not be the son of his proud, iron-willed father without some transmission of that sire's courageous qualities.  He formed his resolution:  He would stay in Sardis, and recover his honor where he had lost it.  At the end of the week he heard the drums beat, the cannon fire, and the people cheer.  The company had come home, and was marching proudly down the street to a welcome as enthusiastic as if its members were bronzed veterans returning victoriously from a campaign that had lasted for years.  His mother told him the next day that the company had decided to re-enlist for three years or duration of the war, and that a meeting would be held that evening to carry the intention into execution. When the evening came Harry walked into the town hall, dressed as carefully as he had prepared himself for his visit with Rachel. He found the whole company assembled there, the members smoking,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27687"],["title","Steam Turbines (#0)"],["body","Fishburne and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                       STEAM TURBINES                              A BOOK OF INSTRUCTION                     FOR THE ADJUSTMENT AND OPERATION OF                         THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF THIS                            CLASS OF PRIME MOVERS                              COMPILED AND WRITTEN                                     BY                              HUBERT E.

INTRODUCTION   This issue of the Power Handbook attempts to give a compact manual for the engineer who feels the need of acquainting himself with steam turbines. To accomplish this within the limits of space allowed, it has been necessary to confine the work to the description of a few standard types, prepared with the assistance of the builders. Following this the practical experience of successful engineers, gathered from the columns of _Power_, is given. It is hoped that the book will prove of value to all engineers handling turbines, whether of the described types or not.                                      Hubert E. Collins.

THE CURTIS STEAM TURBINE IN PRACTICE[1]  [1] Contributed to _Power_ by Fred L. Johnson.   \"Of the making of books there is no end.\" This seems especially true of steam-turbine books, but the book which really appeals to the operating engineer, the man who may have a turbine unloaded, set up, put in operation, and the builders' representative out of reach before the man who is to operate it fully realizes that he has a new type of prime mover on his hands, with which he has little or no acquaintance, has not been written. There has been much published, both descriptive and theoretical, about the turbine, but so far as the writer knows, there is nothing in print that tells the man on the job about the details of the turbine in plain language, and how to handle these details when they need handling. The operating engineer does not care why the moving buckets are made of a certain curvature, but he does care about the distance between the moving bucket and the stationary one, and he wants to know how to measure that distance, how to alter the clearance, if necessary, to prevent rubbing. He doesn't care anything about the area of the step-bearing, but he does want to know the way to get at the bearing to take it down and put it up again, etc.  The lack of literature along this line is the writer's apology for what follows. The Curtis 1500-kilowatt steam turbine will be taken first and treated \"from the ground up.\"  On entering a turbine plant on the ground floor, the attention is at once attracted by a multiplicity of pumps, accumulators and piping. These are called \"auxiliaries\" and will be passed for the present to be taken up later, for though of standard types their use is comparatively new in power-plant practice, and the engineer will find that more interruptions of service will come from the auxiliaries than from the turbine itself.   Builders' Foundation Plans Incomplete  It is impractical for the manufacturers to make complete foundation drawings, as they are not familiar with the lay-out of pipes and the relative position of other apparatus in the station. All that the manufacturers' drawing is intended to do is to show the customer where it will be necessary for him to locate his foundation bolts and opening for access to the step-bearing.  [Illustration: FIG. 1]  Fig. 1 shows the builders' foundation drawing, with the addition of several horizontal and radial tubes introduced to give passage for the various pipes which must go to the middle of the foundation. Entering through the sides of the masonry they do not block the passage, which must be as free as possible when any work is to be done on the step-bearing, or lower guide-bearing. Entering the passage in the foundation, a large screw is seen passing up through a circular block of cast iron with a 3/4-inch pipe passing through it. This is the step-supporting screw. It supports the lower half of the step-bearing, which in turn supports the entire revolving part of the machine. It is used to hold the wheels at a proper hight in the casing, and adjust the clearance between the moving and stationary buckets. The large block which with its threaded bronze bushing forms the nut for the screw is called the cover-plate, and is held to the base of the machine by eight 1-1/2-inch cap-screws. On the upper side are two dowel-pins which enter the lower step and keep it from turning. (See Figs. 2 and 3.)  [Illustration: FIG. 2]  [Illustration: FIG. 3]  The step-blocks are very common-looking chunks of cast iron, as will be seen by reference to Fig. 4. The block with straight sides (the lower one in the illustration) has the two dowel holes to match the pins spoken of, with a hole through the center threaded for 3/4-inch pipe. The step-lubricant is forced up through this hole and out between the raised edges in a film, floating the rotating parts of the machine on a frictionless disk of oil or water. The upper step-block has two dowel-pins, also a key which fits into a slot across the bottom end of the shaft.  [Illustration: FIG. 4]  The upper side of the top block is counterbored to fit the end of the shaft. The counterbore centers the block. The dowel-pins steer the key into the key-way across the end of the shaft, and the key compels the block to turn with the shaft. There is also a threaded hole in the under side of the top block. This is for the introduction of a screw which is used to pull the top block off the end of the shaft. If taken off at all it must be pulled, for the dowel-pins, key and counterbore are close fits. Two long bolts with threads the whole length are used if it becomes necessary to take down the step or other parts of the bottom of the machine. Two of the bolts holding the cover-plate in place are removed, these long bolts put in their places and the nuts screwed up against the plate to hold it while the remaining bolts are removed.   How to Lower Step-Bearings to Examine Them  Now, suppose it is intended to take down the step-bearings for examination. The first thing to do is to provide some way of holding the shaft up in its place while we take its regular support from under it. In some machines, inside the base, there is what is called a \"jacking ring.\" It is simply a loose collar on the shaft, which covers the holes into which four plugs are screwed. These are taken out and in their places are put four hexagonal-headed screws provided for the purpose, which are screwed up. This brings the ring against a shoulder on the shaft and then the cover-plate and step may be taken down.  While all the machines have the same general appearance, there are some differences in detail which may be interesting. One difference is due to the sub-base which is used with the oil-lubricated step-bearings. This style of machine has the jacking ring spoken of, while others have neither sub-base nor jacking ring, and when necessary to take down the step a different arrangement is used.  [Illustration: FIG. 5]  A piece of iron that looks like a big horseshoe (Fig. 5) is used to hold the shaft up. The flange that covers the entrance to the exhaust base is taken off and a man goes in with the horseshoe-shaped shim and an electric light. Other men take a long-handled wrench and turn up the step-screw until the man inside the base can push the horseshoe shim between the shoulder on the shaft and the guide-bearing casing. The men on the wrench then back off and the horseshoe shim supports the weight of the machine. When the shim is in place, or the jacking ring set up, whichever the case may be, the cover-plate bolts may be taken out, the nuts on the long screws holding the cover in place.  The 3/4-inch pipe which passes up through the step-screw is taken down and, by means of the nuts on the long screws, the cover-plate is lowered about 2 inches. Then through the hole in the step-screw a 3/4-inch rod with threads on both ends is passed and screwed into the top step; then the cover-plate is blocked so it cannot rise and, with a nut on the lower end of the 3/4-inch rod, the top step is pulled down as far as it will come. The cover-plate is let down by means of the two nuts, and"]]]
