While this allows for the atmosphere men need, it also provides unceasing volcanic activity as the molten plasma forces its way to the surface.\"  For the first time Jason was silent. Trying to imagine what life could be like on a planet constantly at war with itself.  \"I've saved the best for last,\" Kerk said with grim humor. \"Now that you have an idea of what the environment is like--think of the kind of life forms that would populate it. I doubt if there is one off-world species that would live a minute. Plants and animals on Pyrrus are _tough_. They fight the world and they fight each other. Hundreds of thousands of years of genetic weeding-out have produced things that would give even an electronic brain nightmares. Armor-plated, poisonous, claw-tipped and fanged-mouthed. That describes everything that walks, flaps or just sits and grows. Ever see a plant with teeth--that bite? I don't think you want to. You'd have to be on Pyrrus and that means you would be dead within seconds of leaving the ship. Even I'll have to take a refresher course before I'll be able to go outside the landing buildings. The unending war for survival keeps the life forms competing and changing. Death is simple, but the ways of dealing it too numerous to list.\"  Unhappiness rode like a weight on Kerk's broad shoulders. After long moments of thought he moved visibly to shake it off. Returning his attention to his food and mopping the gravy from his plate, he voiced part of his feelings.  \"I suppose there is no logical reason why we should stay and fight this endless war. Except that Pyrrus is our home.\" The last piece of gravy-soaked bread vanished and he waved the empty fork at Jason.  \"Be happy you're an off-worlder and will never have to see it.\"  \"That's where you're wrong.\" Jason said as calmly as he could. \"You see, I'm going back with you.\"     IV.   \"Don't talk stupidly,\" Kerk said as he punched for a duplicate order of steak. \"There are much simpler ways of committing suicide. Don't you realize that you're a millionaire now? With what you have in your pocket you can relax the rest of your life on the pleasure planets. Pyrrus is a death world, not a sightseeing spot for jaded tourists. I cannot permit you to return with me.\"  Gamblers who lose their tempers don't last long. Jason was angry now. Yet it showed only in a negative way. In the lack of expression on his face and the calmness of his voice.  \"Don't tell me what I can or cannot do, Kerk Pyrrus. You're a big man with a fast gun--but that doesn't make you my boss. All you can do is stop me from going back on your ship. But I can easily afford to get there another way. And don't try to tell me I want to go to Pyrrus for sightseeing when you have no idea of my real reasons.\"  Jason didn't even try to explain his reasons, they were only half realized and too personal. The more he traveled, the more things looked the same to him. The old, civilized planets sank into a drab similarity. Frontier worlds all had the crude sameness of temporary camps in a forest. Not that the galactic worlds bored him. It was just that he had found their limitations--yet had never found his own. Until he met Kerk he had acknowledged no man his superior, or even his equal. This was more than egotism. It was facing facts. Now he was forced to face the fact that there was a whole world of people who might be superior to him. Jason could never rest content until he had been there and seen for himself. Even if he died in the attempt.  None of this could be told to Kerk. There were other reasons he would understand better.  \"You're not thinking ahead when you prevent me from going to Pyrrus,\" Jason said. \"I'll not mention any moral debt you owe me for winning that money you needed. But what about the next time? If you needed that much lethal goods once, you'll probably need it again some day. Wouldn't it be better to have me on hand--old tried and true--than dreaming up some new and possibly unreliable scheme?\"  Kerk chewed pensively on the second serving of steak. \"That makes sense. And I must admit I hadn't thought of it before. One failing we Pyrrans have is a lack of interest in the future. Staying alive day by day is enough trouble. So we tend to face emergencies as they arrive and let the dim future take care of itself. You can come. I hope you will still be alive when we need you. As Pyrran ambassador to a lot of places I officially invite you to our planet. All expenses paid. On the condition you obey completely all our instructions regarding your personal safety.\"  \"Conditions accepted,\" Jason said. And wondered why he was so cheerful about signing his own death warrant.  Kerk was shoveling his way through his third dessert when his alarm watch gave a tiny hum. He dropped his fork instantly and stood up. \"Time to go,\" he said. \"We're on schedule now.\" While Jason scrambled to his feet, he jammed coins into the meter until the _paid_ light came on. Then they were out the door and walking fast.  Jason wasn't at all surprised when they came on a public escalator just behind the restaurant. He was beginning to realize that since leaving the Casino their every move had been carefully planned and timed. Without a doubt the alarm was out and the entire planet being searched for them. Yet so far they hadn't noticed the slightest sign of pursuit. This wasn't the first time Jason had to move just one jump ahead of the authorities--but it was the first time he had let someone else lead him by the hand while he did it. He had to smile at his own automatic agreement. He had been a loner for so many years that he found a certain inverse pleasure in following someone else.  \"Hurry up,\" Kerk growled after a quick glance at his watch. He set a steady, killing pace up the escalator steps. They went up five levels that way--without seeing another person--before Kerk relented and let the escalator do the work.  Jason prided himself on keeping in condition. But the sudden climb, after the sleepless night, left him panting heavily and soaked with sweat. Kerk, cool of forehead and breathing normally, didn't show the slightest sign that he had been running.  They were at the second motor level when Kerk stepped off the slowly rising steps and waved Jason after him. As they came through the exit to the street a car pulled up to the curb in front of them. Jason had enough sense not to reach for his gun. At the exact moment they reached the car the driver opened the door and stepped out. Kerk passed him a slip of paper without saying a word and slipped in behind the wheel. There was just time for Jason to jump in before the car pulled away. The entire transfer had taken less than three seconds.  There had been only a glimpse of the driver in the dim light, but Jason had recognized him. Of course he had never seen the man before, but after knowing Kerk he couldn't mistake the compact strength of a native Pyrran.  \"That was the receipt from Ellus you gave him,\" Jason said.  \"Of course. That takes care of the ship and the cargo. They'll be off-planet and safely away before the casino check is traced to Ellus. So now let's look after ourselves. I'll explain the plan in detail so there will be no slip-ups on your part. I'll go through the whole thing once and if there are any questions you'll ask them when I'm finished.\"  The tones of command were so automatic that Jason found himself listening in quiet obedience. Though one part of his mind wanted him to smile at the quick assumption of his incompetence.  Kerk swung the car into the steady line of traffic heading out of the city to the spaceport. He drove easily while he talked.  \"There is a search on in the city, but we're well ahead of that. I'm sure the Cassylians don't want to advertise their bad sportsmanship so there won't be anything as crude as a roadblock. But the port will be crawling with every agent they have. They know once the money gets off-planet it is gone forever. When we make a break for it they will be sure we still have the goods. So there will be no trouble with the munition ship getting clear.\"  Jason sounded a little shocked. \"You mean you're setting us up as clay pigeons to cover the take-off of the ship.\"  \"You could put it that way. But since we have to get off-planet anyway, there is no harm in using our escape as a smokescreen. Now shut up until I've finished, like I told you. One more interruption and I dump you by the road.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jason was sure he would. He listened intently--and quietly--as Kerk repeated word for word what he had said before, then continued.  \"The official car gate will probably be wide open with the traffic through it. And a lot of the agents will be in plain clothes. We might even get onto the field without being recognized, though I doubt it. It is of no importance. We will drive through the gate and to the take-off pad. The _Pride of Darkhan_, for which we hold tickets, will be sounding its two-minute siren and unhooking the gangway. By the time we get to our seats the ship will take off.\"  \"That's all very fine,\" Jason said. \"But what will the guards be doing all this time?\"  \"Shooting at us and each other. We will take advantage of the confusion to get aboard.\"  This answer did nothing to settle Jason's mind, but he let it slide for the moment. \"All right--say we _do_ get aboard. Why don't they just prevent take-off until we have been dragged out and stood against a wall?\"  Kerk spared him a contemptuous glance before he returned his eyes to the road. \"I said the ship was the _Pride of Darkhan_. If you had studied this system at all, you would know what that means. Cassylia and Darkhan are sister planets and rivals in every way. It has been less than two centuries since they fought an intra-system war that almost destroyed both of them. Now they exist in an armed-to-the-teeth neutrality"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],["title","Deathworld (#4)"],["body"," neither dare violate. The moment we set foot aboard the ship we are on Darkhan territory. There is no extradition agreement between the planets. Cassylia may want us--but not badly enough to start another war.\"  That was all the explanation there was time for. Kerk swung the car out of the rush of traffic and onto a bridge marked _Official Cars Only_. Jason had a feeling of nakedness as they rolled under the harsh port lights towards the guarded gate ahead.  It was closed.  Another car approached the gate from the inside and Kerk slowed their car to a crawl. One of the guards talked to the driver of the car inside the port, then waved to the gate attendant. The barrier gate began to swing inwards and Kerk jammed down on the accelerator.  Everything happened at once. The turbine howled, the spinning tires screeched on the road and the car crashed open the gate. Jason had a vanishing glimpse of the open-mouthed guards, then they were skidding around the corner of a building. A few shots popped after them, but none came close.  Driving with one hand, Kerk reached under the dash and pulled out a gun that was the twin of the monster strapped to his arm. \"Use this instead of your own,\" he said. \"Rocket-propelled explosive slugs. Make a great bang. Don't bother shooting at anyone--I'll take care of that. Just stir up a little action and make them keep their distance. Like this.\"  He fired a single, snap-shot out the side window and passed the gun to Jason almost before the slug hit. An empty truck blew up with a roar, raining pieces on the cars around and sending their drivers fleeing in panic.  After that it was a nightmare ride through a madhouse. Kerk drove with an apparent contempt for violent death. Other cars followed them and were lost in wheel-raising turns. They careened almost the full length of the field, leaving a trail of smoking chaos.  Then the pursuit was all behind them and the only thing ahead was the slim spire of the _Pride of Darkhan_.         *       *       *       *       *  The _Pride_ was surrounded by a strong wire fence as suited the begrudged status of her planetary origin. The gate was closed and guarded by soldiers with leveled guns, waiting for a shot at the approaching car. Kerk made no attempt to come near them. Instead he fed the last reserves of power to the car and headed for the fence. \"Cover your face,\" he shouted.  Jason put his arms in front of his head just as they hit.  Torn metal screamed, the fence buckled, wrapped itself around the car, but did not break. Jason flew off the seat and into the padded dash. By the time Kerk had the warped door open, he realized that the ride was over. Kerk must have seen the spin of his eyeballs because he didn't talk, just pulled Jason out and threw him onto the hood of the ruined car.  \"Climb over the buckled wire and make a run for the ship,\" he shouted.  If there was any doubt what he meant, he set Jason an example of fine roadwork. It was inconceivable that someone of his bulk could run so fast, yet he did. He moved more like a charging tank than a man. Jason shook the fog from his head and worked up some speed himself. Nevertheless, he was barely halfway to the ship when Kerk hit the gangway. It was already unhooked from the ship, but the shocked attendants stopped rolling it away as the big man bounded up the steps.  [Illustration]  At the top he turned and fired at the soldiers who were charging through the open gate. They dropped, crawled, and returned his fire. Very few shot at Jason's running form.  The scene in front of Jason cranked over in slow motion. Kerk standing at the top of the ramp, coolly returning the fire that splashed all about. He could have found safety in an instant through the open port behind him. The only reason he stayed there was to cover Jason.  \"Thanks--\" Jason managed to gasp as he made the last few steps up the gangway, jumped the gap and collapsed inside the ship.  \"You're perfectly welcome,\" Kerk said as he joined him, waving his gun to cool it off.  A grim-jawed ship's officer stood back out of range of fire from the ground and looked them both up and down. \"And just what is going on here?\" he growled.  Kerk tested the barrel with a wet thumb, then let the gun slide back into its holster. \"We are law-abiding citizens of a different system who have committed no criminal acts. The savages of Cassylia are too barbarous for civilized company. Therefore we are going to Darkhan--here are our tickets--in whose sovereign territory I believe we are at this moment.\" This last was added for the benefit of the Cassylian officer who had just stumbled to the top of the gangway and was raising his gun.  The soldier couldn't be blamed. He saw these badly wanted criminals getting away. Aboard a Darkhan ship as well. Anger got the best of him and he brought his gun up.  \"Come out of there, you scum. You're not escaping that easily. Come out slow with your hands up or I'll blast you--\"  It was a frozen moment of time that stretched and stretched without breaking. The pistol covered Kerk and Jason. Neither of them attempted to reach for their own guns.  The gun twitched a bit as the ship's officer moved, then steadied back on the two men. The Darkhan spaceman hadn't gone far, just a pace across the lock. This was enough to bring him next to a red box set flush with the wall. With a single, swift gesture he flipped up the cover and poised his thumb over the button inside. When he smiled his lips peeled back to show all of his teeth. He had made up his mind, and it was the arrogance of the Cassylian officer that had been the deciding factor.  \"Fire a single shot into Darkhan territory and I press this button,\" he shouted. \"And you know what this button does--every one of your ships has them as well. Commit a hostile act against this ship and _someone_ will press a button. Every control rod will be blown out of the ship's pile at that instant and half your filthy city will go up in the explosion.\" His smile was chiseled on his face and there was no doubt he would do what he said. \"Go ahead--fire. I think I would enjoy pressing this.\"  The take-off siren was hooting now, the _close lock_ light blinking an angry message from the bridge. Like four actors in a grim drama they faced each other an instant more.  Then the Cassylian officer, growling with unvoicable frustrated anger, turned and leaped back to the steps.  \"All passengers board ship. Forty-five seconds to take-off. Clear the port.\" The ship's officer slammed shut the cover of the box and locked it as he talked. There was barely time to make the acceleration couches before the _Pride of Darkhan_ cleared ground.     V.   Once the ship was in orbit the captain sent for Jason and Kerk. Kerk took the floor and was completely frank about the previous night's activities. The only fact of importance he left out was Jason's background as a professional gambler. He drew a beautiful picture of two lucky strangers whom the evil forces of Cassylia wanted to deprive of their gambling profits. All this fitted perfectly the captain's preconceptions of Cassylia. In the end he congratulated his officer on the correctness of his actions and began the preparation of a long report to his government. He gave the two men his best wishes as well as the liberty of the ship.  It was a short trip. Jason barely had time to catch up on his sleep before they grounded on Darkhan. Being without luggage they were the first ones through customs. They left the shed just in time to see another ship landing in a distant pit. Kerk stopped to watch it and Jason followed his gaze. It was a gray, scarred ship. With the stubby lines of a freighter--but sporting as many guns as a cruiser.  \"Yours, of course,\" Jason said.  Kerk nodded and started towards the ship. One of the locks opened as they came up but no one appeared. Instead a remote-release folding ladder rattled down to the ground. Kerk swarmed up it and Jason followed glumly. Somehow, he felt, this was overdoing the no-frills-and-nonsense attitude.  Jason was catching on to Pyrran ways though. The reception aboard ship for the ambassador was just what he expected. Nothing. Kerk closed the lock himself and they found couches as the take-off horn sounded. The main jets roared and acceleration smashed down on Jason.  It didn't stop. Instead it grew stronger, squeezing the air out of his lungs and the sight from his eyes. He screamed but couldn't hear his own voice through the roaring in his ears. Mercifully he blacked out.  When consciousness returned the ship was at zero-G. Jason kept his eyes closed and let the pain seep out of his body. Kerk spoke suddenly, he was standing next to the couch.  \"My fault, Meta, I should have told you we had a 1-G passenger aboard. You might have eased up a bit on your usual bone-breaking take-off.\"  \"It doesn't seem to have harmed him much--but what's he doing here?\"  Jason felt mild surprise that the second voice was a girl's. But he wasn't interested enough to go to the trouble of opening his sore eyes.  \"Going to Pyrrus. I tried to talk him out of it, of course, but I couldn't change his mind. It's a shame, too, I would like to have done more for him. He's the one who got the money for us.\"  \"Oh, that's awful,\" the girl said. Jason wondered why it was _awful_. It didn't make sense to his groggy mind. \"It would have been much better if he stayed on Darkhan,\" the girl continued. \"He's very nice-looking. I think it's a shame he has to die.\"  That was too much for Jason. He pried one eye open, then the other. The voice belonged to a girl about twenty-one who was standing next to the bed, gazing down at Jason. She was beautiful.  Jason's eyes opened wider as he realized she was _very_ beautiful--with the kind of beauty never found in the civilized galaxy. The women he had known all ran to pale skin, hollow shoulders, gray faces covered with tints and dyes. They were the product of centuries of breeding weaknesses back"]]]
