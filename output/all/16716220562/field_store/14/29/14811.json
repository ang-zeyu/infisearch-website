He was employed as a boy in the castle grounds, and there he met a man who was a gardener at Kew. They talked, and the eleven-year-old boy was fired to see for himself what gardening could be. Next day he started off, with sixpence-halfpenny in his pocket, and walked all day till he came to Richmond. There he should have had supper; he had threepence left to get it with. But threepence was exactly the price of a little book, _The Tale of a Tub_, which he spied in a bookseller's window. He bought it, took it into a field near Kew Gardens, and sat down to read; read on till it was dark, tumbled to sleep under a haystack, and woke to ask the head gardener for work. He was given work, but the gardener persuaded him to return home. Ten years later he ran away from Farnham again, and for the last time. He was out on the road to meet some friends on the way to Guildford Fair; the London coach swung by, he swung up behind, and by nine that night was in London with half-a-crown in his pocket. He left London for a soldier, and his Farnham boyhood was over.  Riding by Farnham forty years after, Cobbett showed his son the spot where he received his education. It was easily come by, but he was of opinion that if he had not had it, \"if I had been brought up a milksop, with a nurserymaid everlastingly at my heels, I should have been this day as great a fool, as inefficient a mortal, as any of those frivolous idiots that are turned out from Winchester and Westminster School, or from any of those dens of dunces called Colleges and Universities.\" The spot is a sandy bank above the Bourne, a little stream, dry in summer, which runs a mile south of Farnham, from Holt Forest to the Wey. This is the education, described in _Rural Rides_:--      \"There is a little hop-garden in which I used to work when from     eight to ten years old; from which I have scores of times run to     follow the hounds, leaving the hoe to do the best that it could to     destroy the weeds; but the most interesting thing was a _sand-hill_,     which goes from a part of the heath down to the rivulet. As a due     mixture of pleasure with toil, I, with two brothers, used     occasionally to _disport_ ourselves, as the lawyers call it, at this     sand-hill. Our diversion was this: we used to go to the top of the     hill, which was steeper than the roof of a house; one used to draw     his arms out of the sleeves of his smock-frock, and lay himself down     with his arms by his sides; and then the others, one at head, and     the other at feet, sent him rolling down the hill like a barrel or a     log of wood. By the time he got to the bottom, his hair, eyes, ears,     nose, and mouth were all full of this loose sand; then the others     took their turn, and at every roll there was a monstrous spell of     laughter.\"  [Illustration: _Weydon Mill, Farnham._]  When will _Rural Rides_ be added to the cheap editions? No other book of the open air and open politics mixes the two with such a breezy grip as Cobbett's. One rides with the sturdy old man over the road which he thought the prettiest in England--the four miles between Guildford and Godalming--or across \"the most villainous spot God ever made,\" which was Hindhead, and listens to him praising the bean fields and the turnips here, and the oaks and acacias there, cursing the Wen-devils and place-men and pensioners, the reptiles, toad-eaters and tax-eaters, and yet the sheer honesty and affection of the man shine from every page. There never was such a mixture of execration and the scent of bean-blossom. But _Rural Rides_ remains a book of the library rather than the bookshelf.  Farnham has two other authors, one a native and one a friend. Miss Ada Bayly, known to her readers as Edna Lyall, made Farnham her holiday home since she was four years old, and set the scenes of two of her novels in the town. Even better known by his work, if not by his name, is Augustus Toplady, the author of the hymn, \"Rock of Ages.\" Toplady was born in a little house in West Street, now pulled down, in 1740. He wrote much that was bitter; all that is remembered is his hymn.  Every town on the Portsmouth road has its old coaching inn, and Farnham's is the Bush. It stands modestly aloof; you must walk under an arch to finds its oldest walls and its wistaria. It was not always the best inn in Farnham. In 1604, in the account of the Borough, the receipts of the Bailiffs are thus recorded:--      \"Dewes which hath bene payed accostomly paied to the Baylleffs of     the Borrough and Towne of Farneham, beyond the memory of any man     that now liveth as Aniale rents always as followeth:--      For the 4 Inns                               28s     That to saye of the Georg                     7s         of the Whit Hart                          7s         of the Anteolop                           7s         of the Crown                              7s     Of every alhouse within the Borough           2s     Of every alhouse out of the Borough          12d     Of every alhouse at the chosing of the       Bayleffs, called knowledge money            1d     Of every alhouse as will unlisensed or       licinsed at every ffayr day every       on of them                                  1d.\"  The Bush is not mentioned by name; it was a mere alehouse. Soon it became a full-grown inn, and the Georg, the Whit Hart and the Anteolop paled their ineffectual hearths.  [Illustration: _Oasthouses near Farnham._]  Farnham was once the greatest market in England for wheat. Now the chief industry is hops. Farnham hops are some of the best grown, and have always fetched long prices. In Cobbett's day, Kentish hops averaged five pounds a hundredweight, and Hampshire hops were about the same price; Farnham hops fetched seven pounds. English hops to-day average perhaps less than five pounds a hundred, and the hopgrower is in distress. Eighty years ago he was being ruined. Cobbett makes up his accounts, writing at Chilworth on Sept. 25, 1822:--      \"The crop of hops has been very fine here, as well as every where     else. The crop not only large, but good in quality. They expect to     get _six_ pounds a hundred for them at Weyhill Fair. That is _one_     more than I think they will get. The best Sussex hops were selling     in the Borough of Southwark at three pounds a hundred a few days     before I left London. The Farnham hops _may_ bring double that     price; but that, I think, is as much as they will: and this is ruin     to the hop-planter. The _tax_, with its attendant inconveniences,     amounts to a pound a hundred; the picking, drying, and bagging to     50s. The carrying to market not less than 5s. Here is the sum of £3     10s. of the money. Supposing the crop to be half a ton to the acre,     the bare tillage will be 10s. The poles for an acre cannot cost less     than £2 a year; that is another 4s. to each hundred of hops. This     brings the outgoings to 82s. Then comes the manure, then come the     poor-rates, and road-rates, and county-rates; and if these leave one     single farthing for _rent_ I think it is strange.\"  Hop-buyers and sellers in those days met in the old Market House, and were doubtless familiar with the queer inscription, still remembered by middle-aged Farnham farmers. John Clark built the Market House in 1566, and wrote on it his riddle:--      \"You who don't like me, give money to mend me,     You who do like me, give money to end me.\"  The Local Board of 1866, looking round for some worthy object on which to spend their money, liked the old house so well that they ended its existence on the spot.  No parish church is more difficult to drive up to than St. Andrew's at Farnham. If you know the way you can come to a corner of the churchyard by a side street, but Farnham goes to church chiefly by alleys and footpaths. The churchyard is more striking than the church, much of which is new. The thick turf, shaven and level, runs to the foot of mossy brick walls; an avenue of pollarded elms leads from the south door; all round stand little, old red houses. Six o'clock on a sunny autumn evening is the time to wait in Farnham churchyard. Every three hours the mellow, feeble bells ring a chime which suits September twilight:--      \"Life let us cherish     While yet the taper glows,     And the fresh floweret     Pluck ere it close.      Away with every toil and care,     And cease the rankling thorn to wear;     With manful hearts life's conflict meet,     Till Death sounds the retreat.\"  Vernon House, a Tudor building changed from its old name, Culver Hall, and altered so as to front on West Street, has an unhappy memory of the Parliament wars. Charles the First lodged there one December night, a closely guarded prisoner on his way from Hurst Castle to Windsor. A month later he was to leave Windsor for Whitehall. He had little to give his host, and gave him all he had. It was a white morning cap of quilted silk, which Mr. George Vernon, inheriting from his grandfather, left in 1732 to his grandson, \"desiring it may always go to the next heir male of my family, as a testimony of our steadfast loyalty and adherence to the Crown, which is the only bounty my family ever received for all the losses and expenses they sustained for the royal cause, which amounted to several thousands of pounds.\"  [Illustration: _In Farnham Churchyard._]  I had nearly forgotten Farnham's painter. He was Stephen Elmer, and a picture of his, \"The Last"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],["title","Highways and Byways in Surrey (#7)"],["body",",\" hangs in the church tower. But his forte was painting fish and game, dead and alive. In a curious old pamphlet, \"_The Earwig, or An Old Woman's Remarks on the present Exhibition of Pictures of the Royal Academy--a critical pamphlet published in Fleet Street_, 1781, I find the following entries. Of the painters and subjects, Mr. Elmer and Mrs. Robinson belong to Surrey. The rest supply the setting:--      \"10. Thais--Sir Joshua Reynolds, R.A.--The face was painted from the     famous Emily Bertie ... It was a cruel _snouch_ in the Painter, a     fine Girl having paid him seventy-five guineas for an hour's work,     and being unable to pay for the other half of her portrait, to     exhibit her with such a sarcastic allusion to her private life--to     call her Thais--to put a torch in her hand, and direct her to set     flames to the temple of Chastity. Such rigorous punishment seldom is     inflicted by a rich man on a pretty woman, merely from her want of     money.      79. Damn'd bad.      106. Mrs. Mahon in the character of Elvira--J. Roberts.--Painting,     painted.      107. Portrait of Mrs. Robinson--J. Roberts.--At some distance the     effect nearly the same as the preceding number; but on closer     inspection, the colour not quite so thickly laid on. We must do     justice to the Exhibiting Artists by saying that there are no worse     _of their size_ in the room than these Dulcineas.      129. Brace of Pheasants--S. Elmer, A.--No artist can come nearer to     the object he attempts. His fish, his birds, and fruit are as     exquisitely fine as any of the Flemish masters.\"  The National Gallery lacks an Elmer: private collectors may be luckier. Mr. J.E. Harting, to whom all Surrey naturalists owe a debt, reminds me that many of Elmer's best pictures were engraved to illustrate Daniel's _Rural Sports_, and that it was Elmer who painted the picture of the hybrid between a blackcock and a pheasant which readers of _Selborne_ will remember was sent by Lord Stawell to Gilbert White. \"It had been found by the spaniels of one of his keepers in a coppice, and shot on the wing.\"  [Illustration: _Frensham Pond._]     CHAPTER III  FRENSHAM AND TILFORD      A Surrey Labourer.--The Witch's Caldron.--Frensham Ponds.--The Last     of the Blackcock.--Herons and Waterlilies.--The Tilford     Oak.--Cobbett's Mistake.--Silver Billy.--The heroic age of     Cricketers.   Farnham has expanded to the south-east, and not prettily. But it is the key to the great stretch of pine wood, heather and bogland which lies to the south about Frensham, Tilford and Crooksbury Hill; and it is the best centre from which to visit Waverley Abbey and Moor Park, and to take long walks over some of the wildest country in the county. A week would not be long enough to explore the dozen square miles south of the town.  Wrecclesham lies to the south-west, almost on the Hampshire border, and still makes green pottery of patterns which were favourites in the sixteenth century. Further south runs the tiny Bourne, the stream by which Cobbett and his brothers had so good an education, as we have just seen, in the sand. The Bourne, which runs dry in summer, has few associations as a stream; one, perhaps, will remain with it. Readers of _The Bettesworth Book_ and _Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer_ will perhaps not be very wrong if they fix on this sandy valley as the Surrey which Bettesworth knew best. Than the _Memoirs_, I think, no more discerning study of an old labourer's fight to keep on his own legs, out of the workhouse, earning his own money with his spade and hoe, belongs to any Surrey village.  [Illustration: _Pierrepont House and Bridge._]  Deep country begins south of the Bourne, with the first Surrey bridge over the Wey, or rather one of the two Weys that are to join at Tilford. Untouched as yet by any town, the little river runs here over gravel and sand, clear and weedy. Trout lie under the bridge below Pierrepont House, in George III's day a seat of Evelyn Duke of Kingston, who named it after his family. He was the Duke who married the beautiful Countess of Bristol when her lawful husband was still alive: perhaps she used to stare into the Wey at Pierrepont and wonder whether it was worth doing.  [Illustration: _Beside Frensham Pond._]  Frensham stands a little distant from the river, just a cottage or two and a church. But the church holds a famous relic--an enormous caldron of beaten copper. Nobody knows its age; everybody has a story about it. It was brought by the fairies, is one tradition; it was nothing of the kind, is another. Mother Ludlam, the witch of Moor Park, four miles away, used it for boilings and philtremakings, according to one story; yet another connects it with a great stone which used to lie in the neighbourhood. John Aubrey, the antiquary, who \"perambulated\" Surrey in 1673 and 1674, gives the legend in full:--      \"In the vestry of the church, on the north side of the chancel, is     an extraordinary great kettle or caldron, which the inhabitants say,     by tradition, was brought hither by the fairies, time out of mind,     from Borough hill, about a mile from hence. To this place, if any     one went to borrow a yoke of oxen, money, etc., he might have it for     a year or longer so he kept his word to return it. There is a cave     where some have fancied to hear music. On this Borough hill (in the     Tithing of Cherte, in the parish of Frensham) is a great stone lying     along, of the length of about six feet: they went to this Stone, and     knocked at it, and declared that they would borrow, and when they     would repay, and a Voice would answer when they should come, and     that they should find what they desired to borrow at that Stone.     This caldron, with the trivet, was borrowed here after the manner     aforesaid, but not returned according to promise; and though the     caldron was afterwards carried to the stone, it could not be     received, and ever since that time no borrowing there....      \"The people saw a great fire one night (not long since), the next     day they went to see if any heath was burnt there, but found     nothing.\"  [Illustration: _Frensham Pond Hotel._]  \"These stories,\" says Aubrey, \"are verily believed by most of the old women of this parish, and by many of their daughters.\" The daughters ought to have known better. So ought Aubrey, according to Salmon, another Surrey historian, writing in 1736. He cannot understand why there should be anything astonishing about the size of the caldron, \"there having been many in England till lately to be seen, as well as very large spits which were given for entertainment of the parish at the wedding of poor maids.\" It was a notable thing to roast an ox whole. Clearly it would be satisfactory to boil a sheep.  [Illustration: _Frensham Pond._]  From Frensham village a road runs straight across the common to the south-west corner of the Great Pond, but the prettiest road to the water is by the side of the Wey. The Wey runs here deep and clean, edged with forget-me-nots through all the summer, winding and straightening through serene and shining pastures. There is nothing quieter in all Surrey than this little path by the tiny river, with the bank on one side rich with roses and elderflower, and on the other the sunlight gleaming on the chestnut coats of the cattle moving slowly through the sedge. Here is an old oak bridge, solid and lichened; here, facing the stream, a high bank of white sand, bored and tunnelled by sand-martins; a little further, and the brushwood flames with the pink and crimson spires of a thousand foxgloves. The grassy path runs on, until on a sudden bend the ground rises, and over a wooden stile opens out the vista of the great Frensham Pond. Could there be a deeper contrast? Behind lies green pasture-land, rush and sedge, oak and alder; before you, the shoulder of a hill purple with ling, the long level of grey and silver water, dancing under the wind away to a far strip of yellow sand flecked with patches of white foam; high above that, burnt and blackened ridges of heather-ground and gorse. Frensham Pond has often been painted, but that is the view I should choose, as I saw it first. To one coming up from these green depths of pasture, the air blows across the water with the freshness of the sea.  [Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, beyond Frensham Pond._]  Frensham Pond still lies open and wild to the sky, though it may not be long before its shyer visitors leave it for more secluded waters. The motor omnibuses from Farnham have not yet frightened them all away. Coot and moorhens paddle in and out of the reeds, and great grebes float leisurely about its surface. It has always been famous for its fishing. In Aubrey's time it was \"well known for its carps to the London fishmongers,\" and to-day it holds pike, perch and tench. I heard of no carp. Who would eat a carp?  In the bar of the little inn that stands on the edge of Frensham Pond there is an interesting case holding two blackcocks and a grey-hen, whose unhappy lot it was to be shot--perhaps the last of their race seen in this part of Surrey. They were killed nineteen years ago, in 1889. Actually the last blackcock chronicled in Surrey were a pair seen near Hindhead, I believe in 1906.  [Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, from Frensham Common._]  From Frensham Great Pond one may push on to Hindhead, three or four miles to the south-east, or may return to Farnham through Tilford by way of the Little Pond, another broad and shining stretch of water. The way to Farnham is the better, for it means leaving the high road for the natural paths that run over and round the windy ridges of the commonland to the east. From the rising ground between the two Frensham ponds there is a fine panorama of pine and heather. Crooksbury Hill juts up dark and commanding to the north; the level line of the ridge on the left, a few hundred yards away, is broken and humped with"]]]
