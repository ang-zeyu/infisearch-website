The following are cases of this description.    \"A young man whose wife's relations had promised him a   considerable estate as soon as she proved to be pregnant,   fatigued himself to no purpose by continued devotions at the   shrine of love; his over anxiety defeating the very object   he so ardently desired to accomplish. In despair at the   failure of his repeated efforts, he was, at length, on the   point of believing his wife barren, when, following the   advice of a judicious physician, he absented himself from   home for a fortnight, and upon his return proved by the   success which attended his amorous labours, that absence is   sometimes the best doctor.\"    \"A noble Venetian, aged twenty years, was married to a very   handsome lady, with whom he cohabited with a good deal of   vigour, but never could emit semen in the coition, whereas   in his dreams he could discharge very freely. This   misfortune very much afflicted him and his family; and as no   remedy could be found at home, the Venetian ambassadors   residing at the different courts of Europe were desired to   consult some of the most eminent physicians in the cities   where they resided, to account for the causes, and to find a   cure for this extraordinary complaint of the difference of   the states when in sleep and when actually in coition.    \"I was of opinion that it consisted altogether in the   urethra being closely shut by the vigour of the erection in   coition which found so great a resistance that the powers   that throw the seed out of the _vesiculæ seminals_ could not   overcome it; whereas, in dreams, the pressure on the urethra   being much less, an evacuation was affected.\"  The method of cure was not less successful than obvious from the foregoing account: for gentle evacuations and a slender diet brought about and fully completed their desires.[48]  Cabanis is of opinion that debility of the stomach almost always produces a similar state in the organs of generation. \"L'énergie ou la débilité de l'éstomac produit, presque toujours, un état analogue dans ceux de la génération. J'ai soigné un jeune homme chez qui la paralysie accidentelle de ces derniers avait été produit par certains vices de la digestion stomachique; et qui reprit la vigueur de son âge, aussitôt qu'il eût récouvré la puissance de digérer.\"[49]  Old Montaigne's advice in cases similar to those above cited is worthy of notice. \"As to what concerns married people,\" says he, \"having the year before them, they ought never to compel, or so much as offer at the feat, if they do not find themselves very ready. And it is better indecently to fail of handling the nuptial sheets, and of paying the ceremony due to the wedding night, when man perceives himself full of agitation and trembling, expecting another opportunity at a better and more private leisure, when his fancy shall be better composed, than to make himself perpetually miserable for having misbehaved himself, and being baffled at the first result. Till possession be taken, a man that knows himself subject to this infirmity, should leisurely and by degrees make certain little trials and light offers, without attempting at once to force an absolute conquest over his own mutinous and indisposed faculties; such as know their members to be naturally obedient to their desires, need to take no other care but only to counterplot their fancy. The indocile and rude liberty of this scurvy member, is sufficiently remarkable by its importunate, unruly, and unseasonable tumidity and impatience at such times as we have nothing for it to do, and by its most unseasonable stupidity and disobedience when we stand most in need of its vigour, so imperiously contesting the authority of the will, and with so much obstinacy denying all solicitations of hand and fancy. And yet, though his rebellion is so universally complained of, and that proofs are not wanting to condemn him, if he had, nevertheless, feed me to plead his cause, I should, peradventure, bring the rest of his fellow-members into suspicion of complotting the mischief against him, out of pure envy of the importance and ravishing pleasure peculiar to his employment, so as to have, by confederacy, armed the whole world against him, by malevolently charging him alone with their common offence.\"[50]  Too great warmth of clothing round the parts of generation, or too great pressure upon them, may be reckoned as causes of impotency. The custom of wearing breeches was considered by Hippocrates[51] as a predisposing cause of the impotency so common among the ancient Scythians. Mr. Hunter was also of opinion that this article of dress by keeping the parts too warm, affording them a constant support, and allowing the muscles but little freedom of motion, may, at least, relax and cause them to become flaccid, if it do not totally incapacitate them for the due performance of their functions.  Equally disadvantageous, in this respect, is the practice of riding upon horseback, as the organs of generation are, of necessity, frequently compressed either against the saddle or the horse's back. Lalemant, in his Commentaries upon Hippocrates, adduces the case of bakers, upon whom, by their not wearing breeches, the contrary effect is produced. \"We have often heard,\" says he, \"that bakers and others whose parts of generation are not covered by clothing, but hang freely, have large, well-grown testicles.\"[52]  Another cause of impotency is the allowing the parts of generation to remain too long in a state of inaction. Those parts of the body which are most exercised are always found to be better grown, stronger, and more fitted for the discharge of their natural functions provided the exercise be neither too violent nor too frequent. The parts, on the contrary, which are condemned to rest and inactivity wither and gradually lose their tone, as well as the power of effecting the movements natural to them. Galen observes that the genital organs of the athletæ, as well as those of all such whose profession or calling compelled them to remain chaste, were generally shrunken and wrinkled like those of old men, and that the contrary is the case with those who use them to an excess. \"All the athletæ,\" says he, \"as well as those who for the sake of preserving or improving the voice, are, from their youth, debarred the pleasures of love, have their natural parts shrunken and wrinkled like those of old men, while, in such as have from an early age indulged in those delights to an excess, the vessel of those parts, by the habit of being dilated, cause the blood to flow there in great abundance, and the desire of coition to be proportionately increased, all which is a natural consequence of those general laws which all our faculties obey. Thus it is that the breasts of women who have never had children remain always small, while those of females who have been mothers, and who suckle their children, acquire a considerable volume, that they continue to give milk as long as they suckle their infants, and that their milk does not fail until they cease to nourish them.\"[53] So well, indeed, was this fact known to the ancients, that Aristophanes uses the expression, [Greek: _pôosthên mikran_], _penem exiguum_, as an attribute of a youth who has preserved his innocence and [Greek: _kôlên megalên_], _penem magnum_, as the sign of a dissolute one.  It will easily be supposed that superstition when brought to act upon weak and ignorant minds, is capable of producing temporary impotence. The pretended charm or witchery common in France as late as the close of the 17th century, and known by the name of _nouer l'aiguillette_ (point tying) is a proof of this:    Ami lecteur, vous avez quelquefois   Oui conter qu'on _nouait l'aiguillette_,   C'est une étrange et terrible recette,   Et dont un Saint ne doit jamais user,   Que quand d'un autre il ne peut s'aviser.   D'un pauvre amant, le feu se tourne en glance;   Vif et perclus, sans rien faire, il se lasse;   Dans ses efforts étonné de languir,   Et consume sur le bord du plaisir.   Telle une fleur des fear du jour séchée,   La tête basse, et la tige penchée,   Demande en vain les humides vapeurs   Qui lui rendaient la vie et les couleurs.[54]  In olden times, prior to the invention of buttons, the femoral habiliments of men, or hose, as they were called, were fastened up by means of tags or points (Gallice) _aiguillettes_. Thus, Falstaff says, \"Their points being cut, down fell their hose.\" From this French word _aiguillette_ was derived the term _nouer aiguillette_ (to tie up the points), equivalent to--button up the flap, to express the rendering, by enchantment, a husband incapable of performing the conjugal rite. The whole secret of this charm consisted in the impostor choosing for his victim an individual whose youth, inexperience, or superstition presented him with a fit subject to work upon. The imagination of the party being already predisposed for the trick, a look, a sign, a menace, either of the voice or of the hand, accompanied by some extraordinary gesture, was sufficient to produce the effect, and, as the mere apprehension of an evil frequently occasions its occurrence, it followed that, superstition having prepared the event, the latter, in his turn, fortified the superstition, a vicious circle which may justly be considered an opprobrium to a man's intelligence.  That such was the opinion entertained of it by sensible men when it was in vogue, will be seen by the following curious passage from an old and quaint French writer:    \"Quelques uns tiennent cela pour superstition, qui quand on   dit la Messe des espousées, lorsque l'on prononce ce mot   _Sara_, à la bénédiction nuptiale, si vous estrerignez une   esguillette, que le marié ne pourra rien faire á son   espousée la nuict suyuante, tant que la dite esguillette   demeurera noüée. Ce que j'ay veu"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27752"],["title","Aphrodisiacs and Anti-aphrodisiacs: Three Essays on the Powers of Reproduction (#7)"],["body","faux infinies   fois: car pourveuque l'esguillette du compagnon soit   destachée, et qu'il siot bien roide et bien au point il ne   faut point douter qu'il n'accoustre bien la besongne, comme   il appartient. Aussi donne l'on vn folastre amulette et   digne du subject: c'est à sçavoir que pour oster le sort, it   faut pisser au travers d'une bague de laquelle on a esté   espousé. Véritablement ie le croy: car c'est à dire, en bon   Français que si on degoutte dans cet anneau de Hans Carvel,   il n'y a charme qui puisse nuire. Aussi nouer l'esguillette   ne signifie autre chose qu'vn coüard amant qui aura le   mēbre aussi peu disposé, que si l'esguillette ne sa brayette   estoit nouée.\"[55]  As to the mode itself of conjuration, Bodin, a writer upon these subjects, asserts that there are not less than fifty different ways of performing it: of all which the most efficacious one is to take a small strip or thong of leather, or silken or worsted thread, or cotton cord, and to make on it three knots successively, each knot, when made, being accompanied by the sign of the cross, the word _Ribald_ being pronounced upon making the first knot, _Nabal_ upon making the second one, and _Vanarbi_ upon making the third and last one; all which must be done during the celebration of the marriage ceremony. For the sake of change, one of the verses of the _Miserere mei, Deus!_ may be repeated backwards, the names of the bride and bridegroom being thrice pronounced. The first time, the knot must be drawn rather tight; the second time still more so, and the third time quite close. Vulgar operators content themselves with pronouncing some cabalistic words during the marriage rite, tracing, at the same time, some mysterious figures or diagrams on the earth with the left foot, and affixing to the dress of the bride or bridegroom small slips of paper having magical characters inscribed upon them. Further details may be found in the works of Sprenger, an inquisitor, Crespet of Sans, Debris, a Jesuit, Bodin, Wier, De Lancre, and other learned demonologists.  This species of enchantment was not unknown to the ancients. Accordingly to Herodotus[56] Amasis was prevented enjoying his wife Ladice by a sorcery of this description, nor was it till after the Queen had vowed a statue to Venus, \"_si secum coiret Amasis_,\" that the king's wishes and her own were gratified.  Plato warns married persons against such sorceries.[57] Virgil speaks also of impotency effected by ligature.    Terna tibi hæc primum, duplici diversa colore   Licia circumdo.[58]  Ovid admits the power of such charms in the following lines:    Carmine læsa, Ceres sterilem vanescit in herbam   Deficiunt læsi carmine fontis aquæ:   Ilicibus glandes, cantataque vitibus uva   Decedit, et nulla forma movente, flexunt.   Quid vetat et nervos   Et juveni et Cupido, carmine abesse viro.[59]  Of that most detestable of all tyrants, Nero, it is said that, finding he could not enjoy a female whom he passionately desired, he complained of having been bewitched.  The fables of Apuleius are full of the enchantments of Pamphilus.[60]  Numantina, the first wife of Plautius Sylvanus, was accused of having rendered her husband impotent by means of sorcery \"injecisse carminibus et veneficiis vecordium marito.\"[61]  Paulus (Julius) of Tyr states that the law of the Twelve Tables contained an express prohibition against the employment of ligatures; \"qui, sacra, impia nocturnave fecerint, ut quem incantarent, obligarent,\" &c.[62]  Gregory of Tours relates[63] that Eulatius having taken a young woman from a monastery and married her, his concubines, actuated by jealousy, put such a spell upon him, that he could by no means consummate his nuptials. Paulus Æmilius, in his life of King Clovis says that Theodoric sent back his wife Herméberge to her father, the King of Spain, as he had received her, a pure virgin, the force of witchcraft having incapacitated him from taking her maidenhead; which sorcery Aimoinus Monachaus[64] asserts to have been effected by Queen Brunchante.  The practise of point tying was formerly so general that princes and princess made it one of their most amusing pastimes. Louis Sforza having seen the young Princess Isabella, daughter of Alphonso King of Arragon, and who was betrothed to Geleas, duke of Milan, was so enamoured of her beauty that he point-tyed Geleas for several months. Marie de Padille, concubine of Don Pedro King of Castille and Leon, point-tied him so effectually that he could not give the least marks of his fondness to his consort Queen Blanche.  That the church acknowledged the power of these point-tiers is proved by the fact of their having been publicly anathematized by the provincial Councils of Milan and Tours, the Synods of Mont-Cassin and Ferriare, and by the clergy of France assembled at Mélun in 1579. A great number of rituals specify the means to be employed as counter-charms to the sorceries of the point-tiers; and the Cardinal Cu Perron,[65] a very able and experienced prelate, has inserted in the ritual of Evreux very sage directions for this purpose. Similar precautions may be found in the synodal statues of Lyons, Tours, Sens, Narbonne, Bourges, Troyes, Orléans, and many other celebrated churches. St. Augustine, St. Thomas and Peter Lombard positively recognise the power of point-tying and of disturbing, in this manner, married persons in the enjoyment of their dearest privilege. \"_Certum est_,\" says St. Augustine, \"_corporis vires incantationibus vinciri_.\"  Our James I., who prided himself so much upon his skill in demonology, declares positively that sorcerers and witches possess the power of point-tying, \"Or else by staying married folkes, to have naturally adoe with other, _by knitting knottes upon a point at the time of their marriage_.\"[66]  The old parliament of France have generally admitted the power of these sorcerers. In 1582 the Parliament of Paris condemned one Abel de la Rue to be hung and afterwards burnt for having wickedly and wilfully point-tied Jean Moreau de Contommiers. A singular sentence was pronounced in 1597 against M. Chamouillard for having so bewitched a young lady about to be married that her husband could not consummate the marriage. But the most singular instance of the kind upon record is that of R. F. Vidal de la Porte, who was condemned by the judges of Riom to make the _amende honorable_, and afterwards to be hung, and his lady to be burnt until reduced to ashes for having by sorceries and wicked and sacrilegious words point-tied, not only the young men of his town, but also all the dogs, cats and other domestic animals, so that the propagation of these species so useful to man was upon the point of being stopped. In 1718 the Parliament of Bordeaux ordered a famous point-tier to be burnt. This pretended sorcerer had been accused and convicted of having point-tied a nobleman of high family, his wife, and all the men and women servants in his establishment.  It must not be supposed that no counter-charms or amulets existed. The Curate Thiers, who has written at large upon this subject, enumerates twenty-two different ones, the most potent of which were the following:  1. To put salt in the pocket before proceeding to church; pennies marked with the cross and put into the shoes of the bride and bridegroom were equally efficacious.  2. To pass three times under the crucifix without bowing to it.  3. For the bridegroom to wear upon the wedding day, two shirts, one turned inside out upon the other, and to hold, in the left hand, during the nuptial benédiction, a small wooden cross.  4. To lay the new married couple naked upon the ground; to cause the bridegroom to kiss the great toe of the bride's left foot, and the bride the great toe of the bridegroom's right foot: after which they must make the sign of the cross with the left hand and repeat the same with the right or left hand.  5. To take the bridegroom's point-hose and pass it through the wedding ring: knot the said point, holding the fingers in the ring, and afterwards cut the knot saying, \"God loosens what the Devil fastens.\"  6. When the new-married couple are about to retire for the night to fasten upon the thigh of each a little slip of paper, inscribed with these words, _Domine, quis similis tibi?_  7. To broach a cask of white wine from which none has yet been drawn, and pour the first of the liquor which flows, through the wedding ring.  8. To rub with wolf's grease the door posts through which the married couple pass on their way to the nuptial bed.  9. To write upon virgin parchment before sunrise, and for nine days successively, the word _Arigazartor_.  10. To pronounce the word _Temon_ three times successively at sunrise, provided the day promises to be fine.  But the mode of procedure in which the learned curate Thiers appears to place the greatest confidence is that employed by a priest of his acquaintance. This person's plan was to tie the bride and bridegroom to a pillar and administer to them with his own hand the stimulus with which the pedagogue awakens the genius of idle and sluggish pupils; after this flagellation they are unbound and left together, amply provided with such restorative and stimulants as are proper to maintain the condition so favourable to Venus, in which he had placed them. The result was in the highest degree satisfactory.  Bodin informs us that he knew at Bordeaux, a woman of middle age, but still lively and fresh, who professed to cure radically all enchantments of this description. Nothing could be more natural than her _modus operandi_. She got into bed with her patients, and there by the resources of her amatory powers succeeded so well in arousing their flagged and sluggish desires that their domestic peace was never afterwards disturbed by the reproaches of their disappointed spouses. Upon her mother's death, the daughter embraced the same interesting profession and in addition to acquiring considerable "]]]
