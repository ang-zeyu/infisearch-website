It had been sliced off so sharply that it left a highly reflective concave mirror on the severed surface.  \"Where is it?\" demanded Manning. \"In that higher dimension?\"  Russ shook his head. \"You noticed that rushing sensation? That may have been the energy of matter rushing into some other space. It may be the key to the energy of matter!\"  Gregory Manning stared at the bar. \"I'm staying with you, Russ. I'm seeing this thing through.\"  \"I knew you would,\" said Russ.  Triumph flamed briefly in Manning's eyes. \"And when we finish, we'll have something that will break Interplanetary. We'll smash their stranglehold on the Solar System.\" He stopped and looked at Page. \"Lord, Russ,\" he whispered, \"do you realize what we'll have?\"  \"I think I do, Greg,\" the scientist answered soberly. \"Material energy engines. Power so cheap that you won't be able to give it away. More power than anybody could ever need.\"     _CHAPTER THREE_   Russ hunched over the keyboard set in the control room of the _Comet_ and stared down at the keys. The equation was set and ready. All he had to do was tap that key and they would know, beyond all argument, whether or not they had dipped into the awful heart of material energy; whether, finally, they held in their grasp the key to the release of energy that would give the System power to spare.  His glance lifted from the keyboard, looked out the observation port. Through the inkiness of space ran a faint blue thread, a tiny line that stretched from the ship and away until it was lost in the darkness of the void.  One hundred thousand miles away, that thread touched the surface of a steel ball bearing ... a speck in the immensity of space.  He thought about that little beam of blue. It took power to do that, power to hold a beam tight and strong and steady through the stress of one hundred thousand miles. But it had to be that far away ... and they had that power. From the bowels of the ship came the deep purr of it, the angry, silky song of mighty engines throttled down.  He heard Harry Wilson shuffling impatiently behind him, smelled the acrid smoke that floated from the tip of Wilson's cigarette.  \"Might as well punch that key, Russ,\" said Manning's cool voice. \"We have to find out sooner or later.\"  Russ's finger hovered over the key, steadied and held. When he punched that key, if everything worked right, the energy in the tiny ball bearing would be released instantaneously. The energy of a piece of steel, weighing less than an ounce. Over that tight beam of blue would flash the impulse of destruction....  His fingers plunged down.  Space flamed in front of them. For just an instant the void seemed filled with an angry, bursting fire that lapped with hungry tongues of cold, blue light toward the distant planets. A flare so intense that it was visible on the Jovian worlds, three hundred million miles away. It lighted the night-side of Earth, blotting out the stars and Moon, sending astronomers scurrying for their telescopes, rating foot-high streamers in the night editions.  Slowly Russ turned around and faced his friend.  \"We have it, Greg,\" he said. \"We really have it. We've tested the control formulas all along the line. We know what we can do.\"  \"We don't know it all yet,\" declared Greg. \"We know we can make it work, but I have a feeling we haven't more than skimmed the surface possibilities.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Russ sank into a chair and stared about the room. They knew they could generate alternating current of any frequency they chose by use of a special collector apparatus. They could release radiant energy in almost any quantity they desired, in any wave-length, from the longest radio to the incredibly hard cosmics. The electrical power they could measure accurately and easily by simple voltmeters and ammeters. But radiant energy was another thing. When it passed all hitherto known bonds, it would simply fuse any instrument they might use to measure it.  But they knew the power they generated. In one split second they had burst the energy bonds of a tiny bit of steel and that energy had glared briefly more hotly than the Sun.  \"Greg,\" he said, \"it isn't often you can say that any event was the beginning of a new era. You can with this--the era of unlimited power. It kind of scares me.\"  Up until a hundred years ago coal and oil and oxygen had been the main power sources, but with the dwindling of the supply of coal and oil, man had sought another way. He had turned back to the old dream of snatching power direct from the Sun. In the year 2048 Patterson had perfected the photo-cell. Then the Alexanderson accumulators made it possible to pump the life-blood of power to the far reaches of the System, and on Mercury and Venus, and to a lesser extent on Earth, great accumulator power plants had sprung up, with Interplanetary, under the driving genius of Spencer Chambers, gaining control of the market.  The photo-cell and the accumulator had spurred interplanetary trade and settlement. Until it had been possible to store Sun-power for the driving of spaceships and for shipment to the outer planets, ships had been driven by rocket fuel, and the struggling colonies on the outer worlds had fought a bitter battle without the aid of ready power.  Coal and oil there were in plenty on the outer worlds, but one other essential was lacking ... oxygen. Coal on Mars, for instance, had to burned under synthetic air pressures, like the old carburetor. The result was inefficiency. A lot of coal burned, not enough power delivered.  Even the photo-cells were inefficient when attempts were made to operate them beyond the Earth; that was the maximum distance for maximum Solar efficiency.  Russ dug into the pocket of his faded, scuffed leather jacket and hauled forth pipe and pouch. Thoughtfully he tamped the tobacco into the bowl.  \"Three months,\" he said. \"Three months of damn hard work.\"  \"Yeah,\" agreed Wilson, \"we sure have worked.\"  Wilson's face was haggard, his eyes red. He blew smoke through his nostrils.  \"When we get back, how about us taking a little vacation?\" he asked.  Russ laughed. \"You can if you want to. Greg and I are keeping on.\"  \"We can't waste time,\" Manning said. \"Spencer Chambers may get wind of this. He'd move all hell to stop us.\"  Wilson spat out his cigarette. \"Why don't you patent what you have? That would protect you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Russ grinned, but it was a sour one.  \"No use,\" said Greg. \"Chambers would tie us up in a mile of legal red tape. It would be just like walking up and handing it to him.\"  \"You guys go ahead and work,\" Wilson stated. \"I'm taking a vacation. Three months is too damn long to stay out in a spaceship.\"  \"It doesn't seem long to me,\" said Greg, his tone cold and sharp.  No, thought Russ, it hadn't seemed long. Perhaps the hours had been rough, the work hard, but he hadn't noticed. Sleep and food had come in snatches. For three months they had worked in space, not daring to carry out their experiments on Earth ... frankly afraid of the thing they had.  He glanced at Manning.  The three months had left no mark upon him, no hint of fatigue or strain. Russ understood now how Manning had done the things he did. The man was all steel and flame. Nothing could touch him.  \"We still have a lot to do,\" said Manning.  Russ leaned back and puffed at his pipe.  Yes, there was a lot to do. Transmission problems, for instance. To conduct away such terrific power as they knew they were capable of developing would require copper or silver bars as thick as a man's thigh, and even so at voltages capable of jumping a two-foot spark gap.  Obviously, a small machine such as they now had would be impractical. No matter how perfectly it might be insulated, the atmosphere itself would not be an insulator, with power such as this. And if one tried to deliver the energy as a mechanical rotation of a shaft, what shaft could transmit it safely and under control?  \"Oh, hell,\" Russ burst out, \"let's get back to Earth.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Harry Wilson watched the couple alight from the aero-taxi, walk up the broad steps and pass through the magic portals of the Martian Club. He could imagine what the club was like, the deference of the management, the exotic atmosphere of the dining room, the excellence of the long, cold drinks served at the bar. Mysterious drinks concocted of ingredients harvested in the jungles of Venus, spiced with produce from the irrigated gardens of Mars.  He puffed on the dangling cigarette and shuffled on along the airy highwalk. Below and above him, all around him flowed the beauty and the glamor, the bravery and the splendor of New York. The city's song was in his ears, the surging noises that were its voice.  Two thousand feet above his head reared giant pinnacles of shining metal, glinting in the noonday sun, architecture that bore the alien stamp of other worlds.  Wilson turned around, stared at the Martian Club. A man needed money to pass through those doors, to taste the drinks that slid across its bar, to sit and watch its floor shows, to hear the music of its orchestras.  For a moment he stood, hesitating, as if he were trying to make up his mind. He flipped away the cigarette, turned on his heel, walked briskly to the automatic elevator which would take him to the lower levels.  There, on the third level, he entered a Mecho restaurant, sat down at a table and ordered from the robot waiter, pushing ivory-tipped buttons on the menu before him.  He ate leisurely, smoked ferociously, thinking. Looking at his watch, he saw that it was nearly two o'clock. He walked to the cashier machine, inserted the metallic check with the correct change and received from the clicking, chuckling register the disk that would let him out the door.  \"Thank you, come again,\" the cashier-robot fluted.  \"Don't mention it,\" growled Wilson.  Outside the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28215"],["title","Empire (#4)"],["body","he walked briskly. Ten blocks away he came to a building roofing four square blocks. Over the massive doorway, set into the beryllium steel, was a map of the Solar System, a map that served as a cosmic clock, tracing the movement of the planets as they swung in their long arcs around the Sun. The Solar System was straddled by glowing, golden letters. They read: INTERPLANETARY BUILDING.  It was from here that Spencer Chambers ruled his empire built on power.  Wilson went inside.     _CHAPTER FOUR_   The new apparatus was set up, a machine that almost filled the laboratory ... a giant, compact mass of heavy, solidly built metal work, tied together by beams of girderlike construction. It was meant to stand up under the hammering of unimaginable power, the stress of unknown spatial factors.  Slowly, carefully, Russell Page tapped keys on the control board, setting up an equation. Sucking thoughtfully at his pipe, he checked and rechecked them.  Harry Wilson regarded him through squinted eyes.  \"What the hell is going to happen now?\" he asked.  \"We'll have to wait and see,\" Russ answered. \"We know what we want to happen, what we hope will happen, but we never can be sure. We are working with conditions that are entirely new.\"  Sitting beside a table littered with papers, staring at the gigantic machine before him, Gregory Manning said slowly: \"That thing simply has to adapt itself to spaceship drive. There's everything there that's needed for space propulsion. Unlimited power from a minimum of fuel. Split-second efficiency. Entire independence of any set condition, because the stuff creates its own conditions.\"  He slowly wagged his head.  \"The secret is some place along the line,\" he declared. \"I feel that we must be getting close to it.\"  Russ walked from the control board to the table, picked up a sheaf of papers and leafed through them. He selected a handful and shook them in his fist.  \"I thought I had it here,\" he said. \"My math must have been wrong, some factor that I didn't include in the equation.\"  \"You'll keep finding factors for some time yet,\" Greg prophesied.  \"Repulsion would have been the answer,\" said Russ bitterly. \"And the Lord knows we have it. Plenty of it.\"  \"Too much,\" observed Wilson, smoke drooling from his nostrils.  \"Not too much,\" corrected Greg. \"Inefficient control. You jump at conclusions, Wilson.\"  \"The math didn't show that progressive action,\" said Russ. \"It showed repulsion, negative gravity that could be built up until it would shoot the ship outside the Solar System within an hour's time. Faster than light. We don't know how many times faster.\"  \"Forget it,\" advised Greg. \"The way it stands, it's useless. You get repulsion by progressive steps. A series of squares with one constant factor. It wouldn't be any good for space travel. Imagine trying to use it on a spaceship. You'd start with a terrific jolt. The acceleration would fade and just when you were recovering from the first jolt, you'd get a second one and that second one would iron you out. A spaceship couldn't take it, let alone a human body.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Maybe this will do it,\" said Wilson hopefully.  \"Maybe,\" agreed Russ. \"Anyhow we'll try it. Equation 578.\"  \"It might do the trick,\" said Greg. \"It's a new approach to the gravity angle. The equation explains the shifting of gravitational lines, the changing and contortion of their direction. Twist gravity and you have a perfect space drive. As good as negative gravity. Better, perhaps, more easily controlled. Would make for more delicate, precise handling.\"  Russ laid down the sheaf of papers, lit his pipe and walked to the apparatus.  \"Here goes,\" he said.  His hand went out to the power lever, eased it in. With a roar the material energy engine built within the apparatus surged into action, sending a flow of power through the massive leads. The thunder mounted in the room. The laboratory seemed to shudder with the impact.  Wilson, watching intently, cried out, a brief, choked-off cry. A wave of dizziness engulfed him. The walls seemed to be falling in. The room and the machine were blurring. Russ, at the controls, seemed horribly disjointed. Manning was a caricature of a man, a weird, strange figure that moved and gestured in the mad room.  Wilson fought against the dizziness. He tried to take a step and the floor seemed to leap up and meet his outstretched foot, throwing him off balance. His cigarette fell out of his mouth, rolled along the floor.  Russ was shouting something, but the words were distorted, loud one instant, rising over the din of the apparatus, a mere whisper the next. They made no sense.  There was a peculiar whistling in the air, a sound such as he had never heard before. It seemed to come from far away, a high, thin shriek that was torture in one's ears.  Giddy, seized with deathly nausea, Wilson clawed his way across the floor, swung open the laboratory door and stumbled outdoors. He weaved across the lawn and clung to a sun dial, panting.  He looked back at the laboratory and gasped in disbelief. All the trees were bent toward the building, as if held by some mighty wind. Their branches straining, every single leaf standing at rigid attention, the trees were bending in toward the structure. _But there was no wind._  And then he noticed something else. No matter where the trees stood, no matter in what direction from the laboratory, they all bent inward toward the building ... and the whining, thundering, shrieking machine.  Inside the laboratory an empty bottle crashed off a table and smashed into a thousand fragments. The tinkling of the broken glass was a silvery, momentary sound that protested against the blasting thrum of power that shook the walls.  Manning fought along the floor to Russ's side. Russ roared in his ear: \"Gravitational control! Concentration of gravitational lines!\"  The papers on the desk started to slide, slithering onto the floor, danced a crazy dervish across the room. Liquids in the laboratory bottles were climbing the sides of glass, instead of lying at rest parallel with the floor. A chair skated, bucking and tipping crazily, toward the door.         *       *       *       *       *  Russ jerked the power lever back to zero. The power hum died. The liquids slid back to their natural level, the chair tipped over and lay still, papers fluttered gently downward.  The two men looked at one another across the few feet of floor space between them. Russ wiped beads of perspiration from his forehead with his shirt sleeve. He sucked on his pipe, but it was dead.  \"Greg,\" Russ said jubilantly, \"we have something better than anti-gravity! We have something you might call _positive_ gravity ... gravity that we can control. Your grandfather nullified gravity. We've gone him one better.\"  Greg gestured toward the machine. \"You created an attraction center. What else?\"  \"But the center itself is not actually an attracting force. The fourth dimension is mixed up in this. We have a sort of fourth-dimensional lens that concentrates the lines of any gravitational force. Concentration in the fourth dimension turns the force loose in three dimensions, but we can take care of that by using mirrors of our anti-entropy. We can arrange it so that it turns the force loose in only one dimension.\"  Greg was thoughtful for a moment. \"We can guide a ship by a series of lenses,\" he declared at last. \"But here's the really important thing. That field concentrates the forces of gravity already present. Those forces exist throughout all of space. There are gravitational lines everywhere. We can concentrate them in any direction we want to. In reality, we fall toward the body which originally caused the force of gravitation, not to the concentration.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Russ nodded. \"That means we can create a field immediately ahead of the ship. The ship would fall into it constantly, with the concentration moving on ahead. The field would tend to break down in proportion to the strain imposed and a big ship, especially when you are building up speed, would tend to enlarge it, open it up. But the field could be kept tight by supplying energy and we have plenty of that ... far more than we'd ever need. We supply the energy, but that's only a small part of it. The body emitting the gravitational force supplies the fulcrum that moves us along.\"  \"It would operate beyond the planets,\" said Greg. \"It would operate equally well anywhere in space, for all of space is filled with gravitational stress. We could use gravitational bodies many light years away as the driver of our ships.\"  A half-wild light glowed momentarily in his eyes.  \"Russ,\" he said, \"we're going to put space fields to work at last.\"  He walked to the chair, picked it up and sat down in it.  \"We'll start building a ship,\" he stated, \"just as soon as we know the mechanics of this gravity concentration and control. Russ, we'll build the greatest ship, the fastest ship, the most powerful ship the Solar System has ever known!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Damn,\" said Russ, \"that thing's slipped again.\"  He glared at the offending nut. \"I'll put a lock washer on it this time.\"  Wilson stepped toward the control board. From his perch on the apparatus, Russ motioned him away.  \"Never mind discharging the field,\" he said. \"I can get around it somehow.\"  Wilson squinted at him. \"This tooth is near killing me.\"  \"Still got a toothache?\" asked Russ.  \"Never got a wink of sleep last night.\"  \"You better run down to Frisco and have it yanked out,\" suggested the scientist. \"Can't have you laid up.\"  \"Yeah, that's right,\" agreed Wilson. \"Maybe I will. We got a lot to do.\"  Russ reached out and clamped his wrench on the nut, quickly backed it off and slipped on the washer. Viciously he tightened it home. The wrench stuck.  Gritting his teeth on the bit of his pipe, Russ cursed soundlessly. He yanked savagely at the wrench. It"]]]
