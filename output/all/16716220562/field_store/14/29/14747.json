His pride would be greatly mortified should the Kaffir get out of his pit, and find him in the other.  That would be a humiliating rencontre.  In silence, therefore, he listened to Congo's cries for assistance, while at the same time doing all in his power to extricate himself.  He tried to pull up a sharp-pointed stake that stood in the bottom of the pit.  This piece of timber had been placed there for the purpose of impaling and killing the hippopotamus or elephant that should drop down upon it; and had the Bushman succeeded in taking it from the place where it had been planted, he might have used it in working his own way to the surface of the earth.  This object, however, he was unable to accomplish, and his mind became diverted to another idea.  Swartboy had a system of logic, not wholly peculiar to himself, by which he was enabled to discover that there must be some first cause for his being in a place from which he could not escape.  That cause was no other than Congo.  Had the Kaffir not fallen into a pit, Swartboy was quite certain that he would have escaped the similar calamity.  He would have liberated Congo from his confinement, and perhaps sympathised with his misfortune, after the first ebullitions of his mirth had been exhausted; but now, on being entrapped himself, he was only conscious that some one was to blame for the disagreeable incident, and was unable to admit that this some one was himself.  The mishap had befallen him in company with the Kaffir.  It was that individual's misfortune that had conducted to his own, and this was another reason why he now submitted to his captivity in profound silence.  Unlike Congo, he did not experience the soul-harrowing thought of being neglected, and could therefore endure his confinement with some degree of patience not possible to his companion.  Moreover, he had the hope of speedy deliverance, which to Congo was denied.  He knew that Arend would soon return to the camp with the stray horse, and miss them.  The water-vessel would also be missed, and a search would be made for it in the right direction.  No doubt Arend, seeing that the bucket was taken away from the camp, and finding that they did not return, would come toward the drift,--the only place where water could be dipped up.  In doing so he must pass within sight of the pits. With this calculation, therefore, Swartboy could reconcile himself to patience and silence, whereas the Kaffir had no such consolatory data to reflect upon.    CHAPTER FOUR.  IN THE PITS.  As time passed on, however, and Swartboy saw that the sun was descending, and that the shades of night would soon be gathering over the river, his hopes began to sink within him.  He could not understand why the young hunter had not long ago come to release them.  Groot Willem, Hendrik, and Hans should have returned by that time; and the four should have made an effectual search for their missing servants. He had remained silent for a long time, under very peculiar circumstances.  But silence now became unbearable, and he was seized with a sudden desire to express his dissatisfaction at the manner Fate had been dealing out events,--a desire no longer to be resisted.  The silence was at last broken by his calling out--  \"Congo, you ole fool, where are you?  What for don't you go home?\"  On the Kaffir's ear the voice fell dull and distant; and yet he immediately understood whence it came.  Like himself, the Bushman was in a living grave!  That explained his neglect to render the long-desired assistance.  \"Lor', Swart! why I waiting for you,\" answered Congo, for the first time since his imprisonment attempting a smile; \"I don't want to go to the camp and leave you behind me.\"  \"You think a big sight too much of yourself,\" rejoined the Bushman. \"Who wants to be near such a black ole fool as you?  You may go back to the camp, and when you get there jus' tell Baas Hendrik that Swartboy wants to see him.  I've got something particular to tell him.\"  \"Very well,\" answered the Kaffir, becoming more reconciled to his position; \"what for you want see Baas Hendrik?  I'll tell him what you want without making him come here.  What shall I say?\"  In answer to this question, Swartboy made a long speech, in which the Kaffir was requested to report himself as a fool for having fallen into a pit,--that he had shown himself more stupid than the sea-cows, that had apparently shunned the trap for years.  On being requested to explain how one was more stupid than the other,-- both having met with the same mischance,--Swartboy went on to prove that his misfortune was wholly owing to the fault of Congo, by the Kaffir having committed the first folly of allowing himself to be entrapped.  Nothing, to the Bushman's mind, could be more clear than that Congo's stupidity in falling into the first pit had led to his own downfall into the second.  This was now a source of much consolation to him, and the verbal expression of his wrongs enabled him for a while to feel rather happy at the fine opportunity afforded for reviling his rival.  The amusement, however, could not prevent his thoughts from returning to the positive facts that he was imprisoned; that in place of passing the day in cooking and eating _duyker_, he had been fasting and fretting in a dark, dirty pit, in the companionship of loathsome reptiles.  His mind now expanding under the exercise of a startled imagination, he became apprehensive.  What if some accident should have occurred to Arend, and prevented his return to the camp?  What if Groot Willem and the others should have strayed, and not find their way back to the place for two or three days?  He had heard of such events happening to other stupid white men, and why not to them?  What if they had met a tribe of the savage inhabitants of the country, and been killed or taken prisoners?  These conjectures, and a thousand others, flitted through the brain of the Bushman, all guiding to the conclusion that, should either of them prove correct, he would first have to eat the reptiles in the pit, and then starve.  It was no consolation to him to think that his rival in the other pit would have to submit to a similar fate.  His unpleasant reveries were interrupted by a short, angry bark; and, looking up to the opening through which he had descended, he beheld the countenance of a wild dog,--the \"wilde honden\" of the Dutch Boers.  Uttering another and a different cry, the animal started back; and from the sounds now heard overhead, the Bushman was certain that it was accompanied by many others of its kind.  An instinctive fear of man led them to retreat for a short distance; but they soon found out that \"the wicked flee when no man pursueth,\" and they returned.  They were hungry, and had the sense to know that the enemy they had discovered was, for some reason, unable to molest them.  Approaching nearer, and more near, they again gathered around the pits, and saw that food was waiting for them at the bottom of both.  They could contemplate their victims unharmed, and this made them courageous enough to think of an attack.  The human voice and the gaze of human eyes had lost their power, and the pack of wild hounds, counting several score, began to think of taking some steps towards satisfying their hunger.  They commenced scratching and tearing away the covering of the pits, sending down a shower of dust, sand, and grass that nearly suffocated the two men imprisoned beneath.  The poles supporting the screen of earth were rotten with age, and the whole scaffolding threatened to come down as the wild dogs scampered over it.  \"If there should be a shower of dogs,\" thought Swartboy, \"I hope that fool Congo will have his share of it.\"  This hope was immediately realised, for the next instant he heard the howling of one of the animals evidently down in the adjoining pit.  It had fallen through, but, fortunately for Congo, not without injuring itself in a way that he had but narrowly escaped.  The dog had got transfixed on the sharp-pointed stake, planted firmly in the centre of the pit, and was now hanging on it in horrible agony, unable to get clear.  Without lying down in the mud, the Kaffir was unable to keep his face more than twelve inches from the open jaws of the dog, that in its struggles spun round as on a pivot; and Congo had to press close against the side of the pit, to keep out of the reach of the creature yelping in his ears.  Swartboy could distinguish the utterances of this dog from those of its companions above, and the interpretation he gave to them was, that a fierce combat was taking place between it and the Kaffir.  The jealousy and petty ill-will so often exhibited by the Bushman was not so strong as he had himself believed.  His intense anxiety to know which was getting the best of the fight, added to the fear that Congo was being torn to pieces, told him that his friendship for the Kaffir far outweighed the animosity he fancied himself to have felt.  The fiendish yells of the dogs, the unpleasant situation in which he was placed, and the uncertainty of the time he was to endure it, were well-nigh driving him distracted; when just then the wild honden appeared to be beating a retreat,--the only one remaining being that in the pit with Congo.  What was driving them away?  Could assistance be at hand?  Breathlessly the Bushman stood listening.    CHAPTER FIVE.  AREND LOST.  In the afternoon, when Groot Willem, Hans, and Hendrik returned to the camp, they found it deserted.  Several jackals reluctantly skulked off as they drew near and on riding up to the spot from which those creatures had retired, they saw the clean-picked bones of an antelope.  The camp must have been deserted for several hours.  \"What does this mean?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],["title","The Giraffe Hunters (#3)"],["body","Groot Willem.  \"What has become of Arend?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Hendrik.  \"It is strange Swart and Cong are not here to tell us.\"  Something unusual had certainly happened; yet, as each glanced anxiously around the place, there appeared nothing to explain the mystery.  \"What shall we do?\" asked Willem, in a tone that expressed much concern.  \"Wait,\" answered Hans; \"we can do nothing more.\"  Two or three objects were at this moment observed which fixed their attention.  They were out on the plain, nearly a mile off.  They appeared to be horses,--their own pack animals,--and Hendrik and Groot Willem started off towards them to drive them back to the camp.  They were absent nearly an hour before they succeeded in turning the horses and driving them towards the camp.  As they passed near the drift on their return, they rode towards the river to water the animals they were riding.  On approaching the bank, several native dogs, that had been yelling in a clump, were seen to scatter and retreat across the plain.  The horsemen thought little of this, but rode on into the river, and permitted their horses to drink.  While quietly seated in their saddles, Hendrik fancied he heard some strange sounds.  \"Listen!\" said he.  \"I hear something queer.  What is it?\"  \"One of the honden,\" answered Willem.  \"Where?\"  This question neither for a moment could answer, until Groot Willem observed one of the pits from the edge of which the dogs appeared to have retreated.  \"Yonder's a pit-trap!\" he exclaimed, \"and I believe there's a dog has got into it.  Well, I shall give it a shot, and put the creature out of its misery.\"  \"Do so,\" replied Hendrik.  \"I hate the creatures as much as any other noxious vermin, but it would be cruel to let one starve to death in that way.  Kill it.\"  Willem rode up to the pit and dismounted.  Neither of them, as yet, spoke loud enough to be heard in the pits, and the two men down below were at this time silent, the dog alone continuing its cries of agony.  The only thing Willem saw on gazing down the hole was the wild hound still hanging on the stake; and taking aim at one of its eyes he fired.  The last spark of life was knocked out of the suffering animal; but the report of the great gun was instantly followed by two yells more hideous than were ever uttered by \"wild honden.\"  They were the screams of two frightened Africans,--each frightened to think that the next bullet would be for him.  \"Arend!\" exclaimed Willem, anxious about his brother, and thinking only of him.  \"Arend! is it you?\"  \"No, Baas Willem,\" answered the Kaffir.  \"It is Congo.\"  Through the opening, Willem reached down the butt-end of his long roer, while firmly clasping it by the barrel.  The Kaffir took hold with both hands, and, by the strong arms of Groot Willem, was instantly extricated from his subterranean prison.  Swartboy was next hauled out, and the two mud-bedaubed individuals stood gazing at one another, each highly delighted at the rueful appearance presented by his rival.  Slowly the fire of anger, that seemed to have all the while been burning in the Kaffir's eyes, became extinguished, and broad smile broke like the light of day over his stoical countenance.  He had been released at length, and was now convinced that no one was to blame for his protracted imprisonment.  Swartboy had been punished for his ill-timed mirth, and Congo was willing to forget and forgive.  \"But where is Arend?\" asked Willem, who could not forget, even while amused by the ludicrous aspect of the two Africans, that his brother was missing.  \"Don't know, Baas Willem,\" answered Congo.  \"I been long time here.\"  \"But when did you see him last?\" inquired Hendrik.  Congo was unable to tell, for he seemed under the impression that he had been several days in the bosom of the earth.  From Swartboy they learnt that soon after their own departure Arend had started in pursuit of one of the horses seen straying over the plain. That was the last Swart had seen of him.  The sun was now low down, and, without wasting time in idle speech, Hendrik and Groot Willem again mounted their horses, and rode off towards the place where Arend was last seen.  They reached the edge of the timber nearly a mile from the camp, and then, not knowing which way to turn, or what else to do, Willem fired a shot.  The loud crack of the roer seemed to echo far-away through the forest, and anxiously they listened for some response to the sound.  It came, but not in the report of a rifle, or in the voice of the missing man, but in the language of the forest denizens.  The screaming of vultures, the chattering of baboons, and the roaring of lions were the responses which the signal received.  \"What shall we do, Willem?\" asked Hendrik.  \"Go back to the halting-place and bring Congo and Spoor'em,\" answered Willem, as he turned towards the camp, and rode off, followed by his cousin.    CHAPTER SIX.  SPOOR'EM.  The last ray of daylight had fled from the valley of the Limpopo, when Willem and Hendrik, provided with a torch and accompanied by the Kaffir and the dog Spoor'em, again set forth to seek for their lost companion.  The animal answering to the name Spoor'em was a large Spanish bloodhound, now led forth to perform the first duty required of him in the expedition.  The dog, when quite young, had been brought from one of the Portuguese settlements at the north,--purchased by Groot Willem and christened Spoor'em by Congo.  In the long journey from Graaf Reinet, this brute had been the cause of more trouble than all the other dogs of the pack.  It had shown a strong disinclination to endure hunger, thirst, or the fatigues of the journey; and had often exhibited a desire to leave its new masters.  Spoor'em was now led out, in hopes that he would do some service to compensate for the trouble he had caused.  Taking a course along the edge of the forest, that would bring them across the track made by Arend in reaching the place where the horse had strayed, the spoor of Arend's horse as well as the other's was discovered.  The tracks of both were followed into the forest, along well-beaten path, evidently made by buffaloes and other animals passing to and from the river.  This path was hedged in by a thick thorny scrub, which being impenetrable rendered it unnecessary for some time to avail themselves of the instincts of the hound.  Congo led the way.  \"Are you sure that the two horses have passed along here?\" asked Willem, addressing himself to the Kaffir.  \"Yaas, Baas Willem,\" answered Congo.  \"Sure dey both go here.\"  Willem, turning to Hendrik, added, \"I wish Arend had let the horse go to the deuce.  It was not worth following into a place like this.\"  After continuing through the thicket for nearly half a mile, they reached a stretch of open ground, where there was no longer a beaten trail, but tracks diverging in several directions.  The hoof-marks of Arend's horse were again found, and the bloodhound was unleashed and set upon them.  Unlike most hounds, Spoor'em did not dash onward, leaving his followers far behind.  He appeared to think that it would be for the mutual advantage of himself and his masters that they should remain near each other.  The latter, therefore, had no difficulty in keeping up with the dog.  Believing that they should soon learn something of the fate of their lost companion, they proceeded onward, with their voices encouraging the hound to greater speed.  The sounds of a contest carried on by some of the wild denizens of the neighbourhood were soon heard a few yards in advance of them.  They were sounds that the hunters had often listened to before, and therefore could easily interpret.  A lion and a pack of hyenas were quarrelling over the dead body of some large animal.  They were not fighting; for of course the royal beast was in undisputed possession of the carcass, and the hyenas were simply complaining in their own peculiar tones.  The angry roars of the lion, and the hideous laughter of the hyenas, proceeded from a spot only a few yards in advance, and in the direction Spoor'em was leading them.  The moon had risen, and by its light the searchers soon beheld the creatures that were causing the tumult.  About a dozen hyenas were gibbering around a huge lion that lay crouched alongside a dark object on the ground, upon which he appeared to be feeding.  As the hunters drew nearer, the hyenas retreated to some distance.  \"It appears to be the carcass of a horse,\" whispered Hendrik.  \"Yes, I am sure of it,\" answered Willem, \"for I can see the saddle.  My God!  It is Arend's horse!  Where is he?\"  Spoor'em had now advanced to within fifteen paces of where the lion lay, and commenced baying a menace; as if commanding the lion to forsake his unfinished repast.  An angry growl was all the answer Spoor'em could obtain; and the lion lay still.  \"We must either kill or drive him away,\" said Willem.  \"Which shall we try?\"  \"Kill him,\" answered Hendrik; \"that will be our safest plan.\"  Stealing out of their saddles, Willem and Hendrik gave their horses in charge to the Kaffir, and then proceeded to stalk.  With their guns at full cock they advanced side by side, Spoor'em sneaking along at their heels.  They stole up within five paces of the lion, which still held its ground.  The only respect it showed to their presence was to leave off feeding and crouch over the body of the horse, as though preparing to spring upon them.  \"Now,\" whispered Hendrik, \"shall we fire?\"  \"Yes, yes!--now!\"  Both pulled trigger at the same time, the two shots making but one report.  Instinctively each threw himself from the direct line of the creature's deadly leap.  This was done at the moment of firing; and the lion, uttering a terrific roar, launched itself towards them, and fell heavily between the two, having leaped a distance of full twenty feet.  That effort was its last, for it was unable to rise again.  Without taking the trouble to ascertain whether the fierce brute"]]]
