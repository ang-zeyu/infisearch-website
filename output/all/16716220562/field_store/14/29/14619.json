Git!” and he made a bayonet thrust at Jake that tore open his blouse and shirt, and laid a great gaping wound along his breast.  Jake leaped into the cabin and threw himself down upon the puncheon floor.  “Thar war none of our crowd taken,” said another of the squad, who had looked on approvingly.  “They wuz all killed, an' the only way to git even is ter send ye whar they are.”  Jake made another earnest effort to recall one of the prayers he had derided in his bad boyhood.  Leaving the red-nosed man to guard the prisoner, the rest of the Rebels started for the hollow, in search of water to cool their burning thirst.  They had gained such a distance from the scene of the fight, and were in such an out-of-the-way place, that the thought of being overtaken did not obtrude itself for an instant, either upon their minds or Jake's.  But as they came back up the hill, with a gourd full of spring water for their companion, they were amazed to see a party of blue-coats appear around the bend of the road at a little distance.  They dropped the gourd of water, and yelled to the man on guard:  “Kill the Yank, an' run for yer life!” and disappeared themselves, in the direction of the spring.  The guard comprehended the situation and the order.  He fired his gun at Jake, but with such nervous haste as to destroy the aim, and send the charge into the puncheon a foot beyond his intended victim, and then ran off with all speed to join his companions. the Union boys sent a few dropping shots after him, all of which missed their mark.  Jake managed to recover his nerves and wits sufficiently to stagger to the door as his comrades came up, and grasp one of the guns the Rebels had left.  Questions and congratulations were showered upon him, but he replied incoherently, and gasped a request for water, as if he were perishing from thirst.  While some hunted for this, others sought for traces of the Rebels; so he gained time to fix up a fairly presentable story of a desperate and long-continued bayonet struggle in which he was behaving with the greatest gallantry, although nearly hopeless of success, when the arrival of help changed the aspect of matters.  He had so many gaping wounds to confirm the truth of this story, that it was implicitly believed, and he was taken back to camp as on e of the foremost heroes of that eventful day.  The Colonel made him a Sergeant as soon as he heard the tale, and regretted much that he could not imitate the example of the great Napoleon, and raise him to a commission, on the scene of his valiant exploits.  His cot at the hospital was daily visited by numbers of admiring comrades, to whom he repeated his glowing account of the fight, with marked improvements in manner and detail accompanying every repetition.  He had no desire to leave the hospital during his term of service, but his hurts were all superficial and healed rapidly, so that in a fortnight's time the Surgeon pronounced him fit to return to duty.  He cursed inwardly tha officer's zeal in keeping the ranks as full as possible, and went back to his company to find it preparing to go into another fight.  “Hello, Jake,” said his comrades, “awful glad to see you back.  Now you'll have a chance to get your revenge on those fellows.  There'll be enough of us with you to see that you get a fair fight.”  “To the devil with their revenge and a fair fight,” said Jake to himself.  That evening he strolled around to the headquarters tent, and said to the commander of the regiment:  “Colonel, the doctor seems to think that I'm fit to return to duty, but I don't feel all right yet.  I've a numbness in my legs, so that I kin hardly walk sometims.  It's my old rheumatics, stirred up by sleeping out in the night air.  I hear that the man who's been drivin' the headquarters wagin has had to go to the hospital. I want to be at something, even if I can't do duty in the ranks, and I'd like to take his place till him and me gets well.”  “All right, Sergeant.  You can have the place as long as you wish, or any other that I can give you.  I can't do too much for so brave a man.”  So it happened that in the next fight the regiment was not gratified by any thrilling episodes of sanguinary, single-handed combats, between the indomitable Jake and bloodthirsty Rebels.  He had deferred his “revenge” indefinitely.      Chapter IV.  Disgrace.     For of fortune's sharp adversitie   The worst kind of infortune is this: A man that hath been in prosperitie,   And it remember when it passed is.                         -- Chaucer.   Harry Glen's perfect self-complacency did not molt a feather when the victors returned to camp flushed with their triumph, which, in the eyes of those inexperienced three-months men, had the dimensions of Waterloo.  He did not know that in proportion as they magnified their exploit, so was the depth of their contempt felt for those of their comrades who had declined to share the perils and the honors of the expedition with them.  He was too thoroughly satisfied with himself and his motives to even imagine that any one could have just cause for complaint at anything he chose to do.  This kept him from understanding or appreciating the force of the biting innuendoes and sarcasms which were made to his very face; and he had stood so aloof from all, that there was nobody who cared to take the friendly trouble of telling him how free the camp conversation was making with his reputation.  He could not help, however, understanding that in some way he had lost caste with the regiment:  but he serenely attributed this to mean-spirited jealousy of the superior advantages he was enjoying, and it only made him more anxious for the coming of the time when he could “cut the whole mob of beggars,” as Ned Burnleigh phrased it.”  A few days more would end the regiment's term of service, and he readily obtained permission to return him in advance.  The first real blow his confidence received was when he walked down the one principal street of Sardis, and was forced to a perception of the fact that there was an absence of that effusive warmth with which the Sardis people had ever before welcomed back their young townsman, of whose good looks and gentlemanliness they had always been proud.  Now people looked at him in a curious way.  They turned to whisper to each other, with sarcastic smiles and knowing winks, as he came into view, and they did not come forward to offer him their hands as of old.  It astonished him that nobody alluded to the company or to anything that had happened to it.  Turning at length from the main street, he entered the lateral one leading to his home.  As he did so, he heard one boy call out to another in that piercing treble which boys employ in making their confidential communications to one another, across a street,  “S-a-y-, did you know that Hank Glen 'd got back? and they say he looks pale yet?”  “Has he?” the reply came in high falsetto, palpably tinged with that fine scorn of a healthy boy, for anything which does not exactly square with his young highness's ideas.  “Come back to mammy, eh? Well, it's a pity she ever let him go away from her.  Hope she'll keep him with her now.  He don't seem to do well out of reach of her apron strings.”  The whole truth flashed upon him:  Envious ones had slandered him at home, as a coward.  He walked onward in a flurry of rage.  The thought that he had done anything to deserve criticism could not obtrude itself between the joints of his triple-plated armor of self-esteem.  A swelling contempt for his village critics flushed his heart.  “Spiteful, little-minded country boobies,” he said to himself with an impatient shake of his head, as if to adjust his hair, which was his usual sign of excitement, “they've always hated me because I was above them.  They take advantage of the least opportunity to show their mean jealousy.”  After a moment's pause:  “But I don't care.  I'd a little rather have their dislike than their good-will.  It'll save me a world of trouble in being polite to a lot of curs that I despise.  I'm going to leave this dull little burg anyhow, as soon as I can get away.  I'm going to Cincinnati, and be with Ned Burnleigh.  There is more life there in a day than here in a year.  After all, there's nobody here that I care anything for, except father and mother--and--Rachel.”  A new train of thought introduced itself at this tardy remembrance of his betrothed.  His heat abated.  He stopped, and leaning against a shady silver maple began anew a meditation that had occupied his mind very frequently since that memorable night under the old apple tree on the hill-top.  There had been for him but little of that spiritual exaltation which made that night the one supreme one in Rachel's existence; when the rapture of gratified pride and love blended with the radiant moonlight and the subtle fragrance of the flowers into a sweet symphony that would well chord with the song the stars sang together in the morning.  He was denied the pleasure that comes from success, after harrowing doubts and fears.  His unfailing consciousness of his own worth had left him little doubt that a favorable answer would promptly follow when he chose to propose to Rachel Bond, or to any other girl, and when this came with the anticipated readiness, he could not help in the midst of his gratification at her assent the intrusion of the disagreeable suspicion that,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2766"],["title","The Red Acorn (#5)"],["body","dventure, he had not done the best with his personal wares that he might.  Possibly there would appear in time some other girl, whom he might prefer to Rachel, and at all events there was no necessity for his committing himself when he did, for Rachel “would have kept,” as Ned Burnleigh coarsely put it, when made the recipient of Harry's confidence.  Three months of companionship with Ned Burnleigh, and daily imbibation of that young man's stories of his wonderful conquests among young women of peerless beauty and exalted social station confirmed this feeling, and led him to wish for at least such slackening of the betrothal tether as would permit excursions into a charmed realm like that where Ned reigned supreme.  For the thousandth time--and in each recurrence becoming a little clearer defined and more urgent--came the question:  “Shall I break with Rachel?  How can I?  And what possible excuse can I assign for it?”  There came no answer to this save the spurs with which base self-love was pricking the sides of his intent, and he recoiled from it--ashamed of himself, it is true, but less ashamed at each renewed consideration of the query.  He hastened home that he might receive a greeting that would efface the memory of the reception he had met with in the street.  There, at least, he would be regarded as a hero, returning laurel-crowned from the conflict.  As he entered the door his father, tall, spare and iron-gray, laid down the paper he was reading, and with a noticeable lowering of the temperature of his wonted calm but earnest cordiality, said simply:  “How do you do?  When did you get in?”  “Very well, and on the 10:30 train.”  “Did all your company come?”  Harry winced, for there was something in his father's manner, more than his words, expressive of strong disapproval.  He answered:  “No; I was unwell.  The water and the exposure disagreed with me, and I was allowed to come on in advance.”  Mr. Glen, the elder, carefully folded the paper he was reading and laid it on the stand, as if its presence would embarrass him in what he was about to say.  He took off his eye-glasses, wiped them deliberately, closed them up and hesitated for a moment, holding them between the thumb and fore finger of one hand, before placing them in their case, which he had taken from his pocket with the other.  These were all gestures with which experience had made Harry painfully familiar.  He used to describe them to his boy intimates as “the Governor clearing for action.”  There was something very disagreeable coming, and he awaited it apprehensively.  “Were you”--the father's cold, searching eyes rested for an instant on the glasses in his hand, and then were fixed on his son's face--“were you too ill the day of the fight to accompany your command?”  Harry's glance quailed under the penetrating scrutiny, as was his custom when his father subjected him to a relentless catechism; then he summoned assurance and assumed anger.  “Father,” he said, “I certainly did not expect that you would join these mean-spirited curs in their abuse of me, but now I see that---”  “Henry, you evade the question.”  The calm eyes took on a steely hardness.  “You certainly know by this time that I always require direct answers to my questions.  Now the point is this:  You entered this company to be its leader, and to share all its duties with it.  It went into a fight while you remained back in camp.  Why was this so?  Were you too sick to accompany it?”  “I certainly was not feeling well.”  “Were you too ill to go along with your company?”   and--there--was--some--work--in--camp that--needed--to--be--done--and there was enough without me, and--I--I--”  “That is sufficient,” said the elder man with a look of scorn that presently changed into one of deeply wounded pride.  “Henry, I know too well your disposition to shirk the unpleasant duties of life, to be much surprised that, when tried by this test, you were found wanting.  But this wounds me deeply.  People in Sardis think my disposition hard and exacting; they think I care for little except to get all that is due me.  But no man here can say that in all his long life Robert Glen shirked or evaded a single duty that he owed to the community or his fellow-men, no matter how dangerous or disagreeable that duty might be.  To have you fail in this respect and to take and maintain your place in the front rank with other men is a terrible blow to my pride.”  “O, Harry, is that you?” said his mother, coming into the room at that moment and throwing herself into her son's arms.  “I was lying down when I heard your voice, and I dressed and hurried down as quickly as possible.  I am so glad that you have come home all safe and well.  I know that you'll contradict, for your poor mother's sake, all these horrible stories that are worrying her almost to death.”  “Unfortunately he has just admitted that those stories are substantially true,” said the father curtly.  “I won't believe it,” sobbed his mother, “until he tells me so himself.  You didn't, did you, back out of a fight, and let that Bob Bennett, whose mother used to be my sewing girl, and whom I supported for months after he was born, and his father died with the cholera and left her nothing, by giving her work and paying her cash, and who is now putting on all sorts of airs because everybody's congratulating her on having such a wonderful son, and nobody's congratulating me at all, and sometimes I almost which I was dead.  Clearness of statement was never one of Mrs. Glen's salient characteristics.  Nor did deep emotion help her in this regard. Still it was only too evident that the fountains of her being were moved by having another woman's son exalted over her own.  Her maternal pride and social prestige were both quivering under the blow.  Harry met this with a flank movement.  “You both seem decidedly disappointed that I did not get myself wounded or killed,” he said.  “That's an unmanly whimper,” said his father contemptuously.  “Why, Harry, Bob Bennett didn't get either killed or wounded,” said his mother with that defective ratiocination which it is a pretty woman's privilege to indulge in at her own sweet will.  Harry withdrew from the mortifying conference under the plea of the necessity of going to his room to remove the grime of travel.  He was smarting with rage and humiliation.  His panoply of conceit was pierced for the first time since the completion of his collegiate course sent him forth into the world a being superior, in his own esteem, to the accidents and conditions that the mass of inferior mortals are subject to.  Yet he found reasons to account for his parent's defection to the ranks of his enemies.  “It's no new thing,” he said, while carefully dressing for a call upon Rachel in the evening, “for father to be harsh and unjust to me, and mother has one of her nervous spells, when everything goes wrong with her.”  “Anyhow,” he continued, “there's Ned Burnleigh, who understands me and will do me justice, and he amounts to more than all of Sardis--except Rachel, who loves me and will always believe that what I do is right.”  He sat down at his desk and wrote a long letter to Ned, inveighing bitterly against the stupidity and malice of people living in small villages, and informing him of his intention to remove to Cincinnati as soon as an opening could be found for him there, which he begged Ned to busy himself in discovering.  Attired in his most becoming garb, and neglecting nothing that could enhance his personal appearance, he walked slowly up the hill in the evening to Rachel Bond's house.  The shrinkage which his self-sufficiency had suffered had left room for a wonderful expansion of his affection for Rachel, whose love and loyalty were now essential to him, to compensate for the falling away of others. The question of whether he should break with her was now one the answering of which could be postponed indefinitely.  There was no reason why he should not enjoy the sweet privileges of an affianced lover during his stay in Sardis.  What would happen afterward would depend upon the shape that things took in his new home.  He found Rachel sitting on the piazza.  Though dressed in the deepest and plainest black she had never looked so surpassingly beautiful. As is usually the case with young women of her type of beauty, grief had toned down the rich coloring that had at times seemed almost too exuberant into that delicate shell-like tint which is the perfection of nature's painting.  Her round white arms shone like Juno's, as the outlines were revealed by the graceful motions which threw back the wide sleeves.  Her wealth of silken black hair was drawn smoothly back from her white forehead, over her shapely head, and gathered into a simple knot behind.  Save a black brooch at her throat, she wore no ornaments--not even a plain ring.  She rose as Harry came upon the piazza, and for a moment her face was rigid with intensity of feeling.  This evidence of emotion went as quickly as it came, however, and she extended her hand with calm dignity, saying simply:  “You have returned, Mr. Glen.”  In his anxiety to so play the impassioned lover as to conceal the recreancy he had fostered in his own heart, Harry did not notice the coolness of this greeting.  Then, too, his self-satisfaction had always done him the invaluable service of preventing a ready perception of the repellant attitudes of others.  He came forward eagerly to press a kiss upon her lips, but she checked him with uplifted hand.  “O, the family's in there, are they?” said he, looking toward the open windows of the parlor.  “Well, what matter?  Isn't it expected that a fellow will kiss his affianced wife on his return, and not care who knows it?”  He pointed to the old apple-tree where they had plighted their troth that happy night, with a gesture and a look that was a reminder of their former meeting and an invitation to go thither again.  She comprehended, but"]]]
