The musical world has paused, not caring to go farther, to conscientiously study their noble creations, so fruitful in the delights, the soul-elevating influences, which they afford.  [Footnote 7: It would, perhaps, be better at present to except those of Wagner, upon the _surpassing_ merits of which the best critics are as yet divided.]  But, although no great genius has of late years appeared with newer and greater creations to claim our attention from those of the past, it is gratifying to know that great advancement is being made in a more general musical culture among the people; while the number of really great instrumentalists and vocalists is quite large, and is constantly increasing. In these latter respects the present far exceeds the past.[8] In fact, the study of the art of music has begun to be considered a necessity; and ability in its comprehension and performance is now far from being considered as merely an ornamental accomplishment. All this springs from the very nature of this divine art, the mission, so to speak, of which is, to constantly open new fountains of pleasure in the human heart; to cheer, to soothe, and to bless mankind throughout all time.  [Footnote 8: It should also be here remarked, that there has been, too, a remarkable improvement made in the construction of most all musical instruments; they having been brought to a nicety and beauty of form and tone probably not dreamed of by the makers of the past.]  But, after all, we know not how soon another great musical genius may startle us from our complacent studies of the masters of the past; for we are even now somewhat threatened in this respect by Richard Wagner, the eminent composer of Germany. He is not satisfied with the music of the past nor the present, and points to his own present and prospective creations as samples of what the \"music of the future\" will be. Just now, musical critics, while generally conceding to him much power as a composer, are divided in opinion as to whether his ideas are to be accepted in their entirety.  Still, who can now tell what the \"music of the future\" _may_ be?  Before closing this chapter on the history of music, I think it highly proper, as a matter of record and of appropriate interest, to refer briefly to the almost wonderful achievements of that brilliant impressario, P.S. Gilmore of Boston, who in the year 1869 conceived the idea of having a grand musical festival, the noble objects of which were to celebrate the restoration of peace in the United States, and to quicken and increase the interest felt in music throughout this country, and also the world, by bringing together in a single performance a larger body of most skilful musicians than was ever before attempted. An immense building called \"The Coliseum\" was constructed for the purposes of the festival, which was to continue five days. On the 15th of June, in the city of Boston, \"The National Jubilee and Great Musical Festival\" was begun. The number of instruments and performers composing the great orchestra was 1,011; and an organ of immense proportions and power, built expressly for the occasion, was employed. The grand chorus and solo vocalists numbered 1,040. Besides, one hundred anvils (used in the rendering of Verdi's \"Anvil Chorus\") were played upon by a hundred of the city's firemen in full uniform; while to all this was added a group of cannon, the same being used in the performance of the \"Star-spangled Banner.\" The vast chorus, the orchestra, and all the leading performers (among the latter were Ole Bull, Parepa, and Carl Rosa), were selected from the finest musical people of the country, being accepted only after strict testing by skilful judges. At this great gathering many of the works of the great composers were performed, and only works of real merit had a place on the programme. These were all performed by this vast _ensemble_ with a precision and an excellence that were really grand and wonderful. This achievement of Gilmore was considered the most brilliant entertainment of modern times. Of it, it has been truly said,--       \"This great event, by the sublimity of its music, held the      nation spell-bound. The great volume of song swept through      the land like a flood of melody, filling every Christian      heart with 'glad tidings of great joy.' It came like a      sunburst upon a musical world, shedding light where had been      darkness before, and revealing a new sphere of harmony, a      fairy-land of promise, and triumphantly realizing greater      achievements in the divine art than were hitherto thought      possible. It will ever be a memorable epoch in the history      of music, a glorious event; and thousands upon thousands are      happier for that week of glorious music. The boom of the      cannon, the stroke of the bells,[9] the clang of the anvils,      the peal of the organ, the harmony of the thousand      instruments, the melody of the thousands of voices, the      inspiring works of the great masters, the song of the      'Star-spangled Banner,' the cheers of the multitude, the      splendor of the spectacle,--the memory of all this is the      rich possession of many, and will be ever recalled as the      happiest experiences of a lifetime.\"  [Footnote 9: The church-bells of the city were also employed in rendering some of the music.]  The success of the \"National Peace Jubilee\" was so perfect, and had produced a musical enthusiasm and revival so great, that, in the year 1872, Gilmore, still prolific in startling musical conceptions, projected and carried into execution another festival of the same general character as the first, only that it was far vaster and more daring in its proportions. This one he styled \"The World's Peace Jubilee and International Festival.\" Several times during the week that this great musical festival was held, not less than fifty thousand people were present in the immense Coliseum building. This time the orchestra consisted of two thousand instruments, and the chorus numbered over seventeen hundred voices; while a mighty organ and cannon and anvils were used as before. The great soloists engaged were Mme. Leutner, Johann Strauss, Franz Abt, and Bendel. Foreign governments being invited to send representatives from among their best musicians, England sent the Band of the Grenadier Guards; Germany, its great Prussian Band; France, the brilliant French Republic Band. King William of Prussia sent also, as a special compliment, his classical Court Cornet Quartet; and Ireland sent its best band. To this galaxy of star military bands, perhaps the greatest ever assembled, the United States added its own favorite Marine Band of Washington. At this second great and vast assemblage of artists the almost marvellous achievements of the first \"Jubilee\" were repeated to the utmost delight of many thousands of people, and Gilmore became at once the most brilliant and daring impressario genius of the world.  As before intimated, Wagner is not at all satisfied with pausing where Mozart, Beethoven, and other great composers, left off. He believes that their music can be improved upon. According to his theory, the music of the opera, in the most highly-developed form of the latter, is but an incidental element, the dramatic part being principal. He lately composed a triology--three operas connected as one--with a prologue, the subjects of the dramas being taken from mythology, and forming beautiful fairy tales. To carry to the greatest perfection his views and firmly-held ideas as to what music should be, and as to what he stoutly avers it will be in the future, he selected from far and near only the best artists for the performance of his opera (these were subjected to long and careful rehearsals under his own conductorship), and erected at Bayreuth, in Bavaria, a large and beautiful theatre, which, in its minutest details even, was built under his own supervision, and after his own peculiar ideas. It being calculated to show to the highest advantage his conception, that, in the expression of sentiment, music is only secondary, his orchestra of one hundred and ten performers was placed out of sight of the audience during the acting of the opera.  The great \"Musical Festival,\" as it was called, continued three days, the performance of each part of the triology occupying--exclusive of a wait of one hour after each act--from four to five hours.  At these performances the nobility of Germany and other countries, together with the Abb√© Liszt, and many others in the higher walks of music, were present. The audiences were immense, brilliant, and exceedingly demonstrative in applause. At the close of the opera, Wagner was called before the curtain, receiving quite an ovation: and in his speech he said, \"Now we see what can be done: at last we have a German art.\"  It is perhaps too early, as yet, to decide that Richard Wagner's ideal will be adopted by the musical world; nor should we be in too much haste to conclude that it will not be. Certainly he has succeeded, at least, in dividing the highest critics of the glorious art; and the history of music shows, as does also that of all art, that what is rejected to-day may be warmly and even rapturously accepted to-morrow.  Of the festival at Bayreuth, Mr. Hazard, musical critic of \"The New-York Tribune,\" writes, \"The effect of the music was magnificent beyond all description. It far surpassed all expectation; and the general verdict is that it is a triumph of the new school of music, final and complete.\"  Of the impression created by one of the parts of the opera, \"Rheingold\" (Mr. F.A. Schwabe), of \"The New-York Times,\" says, \"Musically considered, it is not significant. It is hopeless, therefore, to look for popularity for the work; at present, at least.\"  \"The agony is over; and the grandest of all operatic conceptions, the musical drama over which Richard Wagner toiled and dreamed for twenty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],["title","Music and Some Highly Musical People (#8)"],["body","ars, has been given to the world in its complete form.\"[10]  [Footnote 10: From a writer in the New-York Herald.]  Very recently, Mr. Moncure D. Conway thus expresses his high admiration for the work of Wagner:--       \"I am satisfied that the English-speaking world is little      aware at present of the immensity and importance of the work      Wagner has done for art. Plato declared that the true      musician must have poetry and music harmonized in himself;      and the world has waited twenty-five hundred years for that      combination to appear. Having carefully read the poems all      written by himself which Wagner has set to music, or rather      which incarnated themselves in music, and costumed      themselves in scenery as he wrote them, I venture to affirm      that none can so read them without the conviction that their      author is a true poet. In the first place, the general      conception of his chief operas, taken together, is in the      largest sense poetic, and I might even say Homeric. This man      has transmitted an entire religion to poetry, and then set      it to music. And it is one of the greatest of      religions,--what Nature engraved on the heart of our own      Teutonic ancestors. It is all there,--its thousand      phantasmal years, from the first cowering cry of the Norse      savage before the chariot of his storm-god to the last      gentle hymn that rose to Freya under her new name of      Mary,--all. It is interpreted as a purely human expression;      and, I repeat, no man has done so vast and worthy an      artistic work in our time.\"  While America has perhaps produced as yet no _great_ composers, it has several of very high merit, such as J.K. Paine, Dudley Buck, and others. In the United States there are many remarkable vocal and instrumental artists, a large number of classical musical clubs and societies; while several of its great vocalists, male and female, accept and decline engagements in Europe. Perhaps no finer orchestra exists anywhere than that of Theodore Thomas of New York; while nearly as high praise may be given to the Mendelssohn and Beethoven Quintette Clubs of Boston, and to others in different parts of the country.  Music is quite generally cultivated in this country; and there are many excellent critics, musical writers, and periodicals devoted to this beautiful and elevating science.  A very startling late American musical invention is the \"telephone,\" a description of the working of which is given below:--       \"MUSIC BY TELEGRAPH.       \"A most interesting field for the musical student is the      progress that is being made in _telegraphing musical      sounds_.       \"This is done by means of the telephone, which transmits      simultaneously several different tones through one wire by      means of steel forks made to vibrate at one end of the line,      the pulsations passing through the wire independently of      each other, and reappearing at the distant station on      vibrating reeds.       \"Some very interesting tests were made in the Centennial      Main Building a few days ago in the presence of about fifty      invited guests, among whom were noticed the Emperor and      Empress of Brazil, Sir William Thompson, and quite a number      of eminent electricians.       \"The experiments were of a very interesting and successful      character.       \"The inventor, Mr. Gray of Chicago, asked his assistant, Mr.      Goodridge, to transmit musical sounds, which were received      very distinctly amid hearty applause from those present.       \"It was the first time that many present had heard 'Home,      Sweet Home,' 'My Country, 'tis of Thee,' or 'Old Hundred,'      rendered so beautifully by telegraph; and they evidently      enjoyed the treat.\"  By this invention, music played upon a piano-forte or melodeon is reproduced upon a violin attached to the receiving end of the wire at a distance of twenty-four hundred miles.  Another important musical invention (English) is that of the \"voice harmonium.\" Of this Mr. Theo. T. Seward writes,--       \"To all such the invention of which I speak is a matter of      deep interest, because in it is practically solved the      problem of perfect intonation. It is called the 'voice      harmonium,' because the securing of perfect intonation      brings the tones much nearer to the quality of the human      voice. The instrument has been invented and patented by Mr.      Colin Brown of Glasgow, Ewing lecturer on music. By the use      of additional reeds and a most ingenious keyboard, he has      succeeded in giving each key in _perfect_ tune. The 'wolf'      is banished altogether, without the privilege of a single      growl. I do not need to say that the effect upon the ear is      rich, and extremely satisfactory. After listening to it a      little while, the tones of a tempered organ sound coarse and      harsh. I wish very much that some of our ingenious American      instrument-makers could have the opportunity of examining      it. It has been publicly exhibited at the South-Kensington      Exhibition, before the recent meeting of the British      Association, and elsewhere. The highest scientific      authorities have pronounced most thoroughly in favor of its      'perfectness, beauty, and simplicity.' Whether the greater      complication of the keyboard will interfere seriously with      its popular use, remains to be seen.\"  Mr. Theodore Thomas recently gave an excellent performance of the works of American composers. Among those rendered were compositions by Dudley Buck, A.H. Pease, and William Mason. One of the gems of the evening was a symphonic poem by William H. Foy, entitled \"A Day in the Country.\"  Mr. Thomas's orchestra, noted for placing upon its programmes only works of the highest merit, has recently also presented with much success a new symphony by the talented composer of oratorios, &c., J.K. Paine.  In alluding to the progress of music in the United States, \"The Music Trade Review\" says, \"If the centennial year could disclose all its triumphs, music would shine among its garlands. A hundred years ago was a voiceless void for us compared with the native voices and native workers who now know a sonnet from a saraband.\"     IV.  THE BEAUTY, POWER, AND USES OF MUSIC.       \"The soul lives its best hours when surrounded by melody,      and is drawn towards its home, Paradise, dreaming of its      hymning seraphs who adore with ecstasies that can find      utterance only in song.\"       \"And how can happiness be better expressed than by song or      music? And, if the body and mind are both attuned to a true      enjoyment of their resources, how much more will the moral      nature be refined and educated!\"   The cultivation of the art of music has ever followed closely the progress of civilization; and those nations that have attained to the highest state of the latter have most encouraged the growth, and have been most skilled in the creation and performance, of music. Montesquieu avers that \"music is the only one of all the arts that does not corrupt the mind.\" Confucius said, \"Wouldst thou know if a people be well governed, if its laws be good or bad? examine the music it practises.\" Again: another has quite aptly said that       \"Music is one of the greatest educators in the world; and      the study of it in its higher departments, such as      composition, harmony, and counterpoint, develops the mind as      much as the study of mathematics or the languages. It      teaches us love, kindness, charity, perseverance, patience,      diligence, promptness, and punctuality.\"  And a writer in \"Chambers's Journal\" remarks, that       \"In society, where education requires a submission to rule      singing belongs to the domain of art; but, in a primitive      state, all nations have their songs. Musical rhythm drives      away weariness, lessens fatigue, detaches the mind from the      painful realities of life, and braces up the courage to meet      danger. Soldiers march to their war-songs; the laborer      rests, listening to a joyous carol; in the solitary chamber,      the needlewoman accompanies her work with some love-ditty;      and in divine worship the heart is raised above earthly      things by the solemn chant.\"  Happily for the world, this beautiful art is one, the delightful forms of which nearly all may enjoy, the inspiring, soul-elevating influences of which nearly all may feel. I say, nearly all; because it is a sad truth that there are some persons who have no ear whatever for music, and to whom the harsh, rattling noise of the cart on the stony street affords just as much melody as do the sweetest tones that may issue from a musical instrument. Again: there are those, who, although possessing to some extent a faculty for musical discernment, are yet so much governed by what is called a sense of the \"practical\" in life as to avoid all opportunity for the enjoyment of melody, considering such indulgence as a waste of precious time. It is, however, pleasant to know that the number of all such persons--who must, I think, be regarded as really unfortunate--is but a small one, and that almost every one has a born capacity for musical appreciation and enjoyment.  It is true that the mighty genius of Mozart and Beethoven soared far above common musical minds. With a love for the noble art of music almost sacred in its intensity, these great composers penetrated far, far into its depths, finding their greatest enjoyment in so doing. Starting with the simpler forms of the art left by their predecessors, they deepened, they broadened and varied those forms; while, with every intricacy created, they experienced the sweetest of pleasure. And one of the most fitting tributes that can be paid to these and others of the noble masters of harmony is beautifully embodied in the lines of Rogers:--       \"The _soul_ of music slumbers in the shell      Till waked and kindled"]]]
