II      Thy grace, O Father, give,       That I may serve in fear;     Above all boons, I pray,       Grant me Thy voice to hear;     From sin Thy child in mercy free,     And let me dwell in light with Thee.                                     III      That, cleansed from filthy stain,       I may meet homage give,     And, pure in heart, behold       And serve Thee while I live;     Clean hands in holy worship raise,     And Thee, O Christ my Saviour, praise.                                     IV      In supplication meek       To Thee I bend the knee;     O Christ, when Thou shalt come,       In love remember me,     And in Thy kingdom, by Thy grace,     Grant me a humble servant's place.                                      V      Thy grace, O Father, give,       I humbly Thee implore;     And let Thy mercy bless       Thy servant more and more.     All grace and glory be to Thee     From age to age eternally.                     {tauta soi hêmeteroio thalysia, Christe}                    Cento from {christe anax, se prôton}                                       I      Christ, for Thee a wreath adorning       Weaves my raptured soul with glee,     For from death this glorious morning       Thou hast risen triumphantly.                                     II      From the tomb behold Him rising,       Christ our Lord whose praise is sung.     Death is slain; O power surprising!       Hades' gates are open flung.                                     III      Thou for man to earth in meekness       Cam'st that he new born might be;     Thou upon the cross in weakness       Diedst that he might die with Thee.                                     IV      Thou didst rise--we hail Thee, Jesus!       And we leave the tomb with Thee.     Victor, by the power that frees us,       Where Thou art, there we would be.                                      V      Hark! the highest heavens are ringing,       Choirs angelic lead the strain,     And my opened lips in singing       Tell the praises forth again.                                  AN EVENING HYMN                           {Se kai nyn eulogoumen}                                       I      Now at this evening hour,       O Thou, my Christ, to Thee,     Thou Word of God, Eternal Light,       All grateful praises be.                                     II      From Thee the Spirit comes,       Third beam of peerless light,     And in Thyself one glorious orb       The triple rays unite.                                     III      Thy word and wisdom Thou       To lighten man hast given,     That he the splendour might reflect       That shines superb in heaven;                                     IV      And having light within,       Might see Thine image bright,     And daily rise, till he himself       Is altogether light.                                  A MORNING HYMN                    {orthrios didômi tô theô mou dexias}                                       I      The morning breaks, I place my hand in Thine,     My God, 'tis Thine to lead, to follow mine;     No word deceitful shall I speak the while,     Nor shall I stain my hand with action vile.                                     II      Thine be the day with worthy labour filled,     Strong would I stand to do the duty willed;     Nor swayed by restless passion let me be,     That I may give the offering pure to Thee;                                     III      Else were I 'shamed when hoary age I see,     Shamed were this board that bears Thy gifts to me:     Mine is the impulse; O my Christ, I pray,     Be Thou Thyself to me the Blessed Way!                                  AN EVENING HYMN                     {epseusamên se tên alêtheian, loge}                                       I      O Word of Truth! in devious paths       My wayward feet have trod,     I have not kept the day serene       I gave at morn to God.                                     II      And now 'tis night, and night within,       O God, the light hath fled!     I have not kept the vow I made       When morn its glories shed.                                     III      For clouds of gloom from nether world       Obscured my upward way;     O Christ the Light, Thy light bestow       And turn my night to day!                                     SYNESIUS                                     SYNESIUS   Synesius was born about 375. In more particulars than one he was an outstanding man. His pedigree is said to have extended through seventeen centuries, and to have included the names of the most illustrious. Not only was he of noble lineage, he was a man also of high character and brilliant attainments. He was versed in the Neoplatonic philosophy, and his Christianity has been called in question by no less an authority than Mosheim; but how any one can read his odes and doubt the reality of his Christian faith, even in the full sense of the term, as believing in the Divinity of Christ and in His Resurrection, is hard to understand. He certainly was a good man, and knew Christ and loved Him. His writings prove that; and in 410 A.D., though reluctantly, he became Bishop of Ptolemais. Very little of his poetry has come down to us, but that little is of the highest order. He died 430 A.D.                       {soi nyx me pherei ton aoidon, anax}                        A Cento from {age moi psycha}                                       I      When darkness falls and night is here,       My hymns of praise in silence rise--     This knows the moon, whose silver sphere       Shines in the star-bespangled skies.                                     II      When morning breaks, and glorious day       Shines in the dawn and noontide fair--     This knows the sun--a grateful lay       Springs from my heart in fervent prayer.                                     III      When fails the light at sunset gray,       And twilight listens for my song--     This know the stars--in bright array       My praises mingle with their throng.                            {lypais d' astiptos psycha}                   A Cento from {Hymnômen kouron nymphas}                                       I      O may my soul, uncrushed by care,       Direct her gaze to where Thou art,     And in Thy splendour find, O Christ,       The strength of life Thou canst impart.                                     II      And freed from sin's depressing load,       May I pursue the path divine,     And rise above the cares of earth       Until my life is merged in Thine.                                     III      Unsullied life Thy servant grant       Who tunes his harp to sound Thy praise,     And still my life shall hymn Thy love,       And glory to the Father raise.                                     IV      And when I rest in glory bright,       The burden of my labour past,     In hymns I'll praise Thee more and more       While the eternal ages last.                                 {age moi psycha}                                       I      Up, up, my soul, on wings of praise,       No other service know;     In holy strains the love express       That fires the heart below.                                     II      Burn, burn, my soul, and ever be       With holy ardour fired,     And, strongly armed with firm resolve,       Be evermore inspired.                                     III      Pour forth a bloodless offering       Of hymns and holy lauds,     And weave a garland rich and fair       To crown the King of gods.                              {autos phôs ei pagaion}                    Cento from {Hymnômen kouron nymphas}                                       I      In the Father's glory shining,       Jesus, Light of light art Thou;     Sordid night before Thee fleeth,--       On our souls Thou'rt falling now.                                     II      Framer of the world, we hail Thee!       Thou didst mould the stars of night;     Earth to life Thou dost awaken,       Saviour Thou, of glorious might!                                     III      'Tis Thy hand that guides the chariot       When the sun illumes the skies,     And the dark of night relaxes       When Thou bidst the moon arise.                                     IV      At Thy word the harvest ripens,       Flocks and herds their pasture find;     Earth gives bread to feed the hungry,       For the hand of God is kind.                                      V      May my soul, her want perceiving,       Turn her gaze to where Thou art,     And in all Thy fulness find Thee       Food to satisfy the heart.
