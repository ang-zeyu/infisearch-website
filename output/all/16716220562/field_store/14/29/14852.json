We were taken into a long cement-floored building, and laid down in a line of stretchers which ran almost from the doorway up to a screen at the end of the room, behind which dressings and operations were taking place. On my right was the officer of the K----'s, still fairly cheery, though in a certain amount of pain; on my left lay a rifleman hit in the chest, and very grey about the face; I remember that, as I looked at him, I compared the colour of his face with that of the stomach cases I had seen. A stomach case, as far as I can remember, has an ashen pallor about the face; a lung case has a haggard grey look. Next to him a boy of about eighteen was sitting on his stretcher; he was hit in the jaw, the arms, and the hands, but he calmly took out his pipe, placed it in his blood-stained mouth, and started smoking. I was talking to the officer of the K----'s, when he suddenly fell to groaning, and rolled over on to my stretcher. I tried to comfort him, but words were of no avail. A doctor came along, asked a few questions, and examined the wound, just a small hole in the pit of the stomach; but he looked serious enough about it. The stretcher was lifted up and its tortured occupant borne away behind the screen for an operation. That was the last I saw of a very plucky young fellow. I ate some bread and jam, and drank some tea doled out liberally all down the two lines of stretchers, for another line had formed by now.  My turn came at last, and I was carried off to a table behind the screen, where the wound was probed, dressed, and bandaged tightly, and I had a foretaste of the less pleasant side of hospital life. There were two Army nurses at work on a case next to mine--the first English women I had seen since I returned from leave six months before. My wound having been dressed, I was almost immediately taken out and put into a motor-lorry. There must have been about nine of us, three rows of three, on the floor of that lorry. I did not find it comfortable, though the best had been done under the circumstances to make it so; neither did the others, many of whom were worse wounded than myself, judging by the groans which arose at every jolt.  We turned down a road leading to the station. Groups of peasants were standing in the village street and crying after us: \"Ah! les pauvres blessés! les pauvres Anglais blessés!\" These were the last words of gratitude and sympathy that the kind peasants could give us. We drew up behind other cars alongside the hospital train, and the engine-driver looked round from polishing his engine and watched us with the wistful gaze of one to whom hospital train work was no longer a novelty. Walking wounded came dribbling up by ones and twos into the station yard, and were directed into sitting compartments.  The sun was in my eyes, and I felt as if my face was being scorched. I asked an R.A.M.C.N.C.O., standing at the end of the wagon, to get me something to shade my eyes. Then occurred what I felt was an extremely thoughtful act on the part of a wounded man. A badly wounded lance-corporal, on the other side of the lorry, took out his handkerchief and stretched it over to me. When I asked him if he was sure that he did not want it, he insisted on my taking it. It was dirty and blood-stained, but saved me much discomfort, and I thanked him profusely. After about ten minutes our stretchers were hauled out of the lorry. I was borne up to the officers' carriage at the far end of the train. It was a splendidly equipped compartment; and when I found myself between the sheets of my berth, with plenty of pillows under me, I felt as if I had definitely got a stage nearer to England. Some one behind me called my name, and, looking round, I saw my old friend M---- W----, whose party I had nearly run into the night before in that never-to-be-forgotten communication trench, Woman Street. He told me that he had been hit in the wrist and leg. Judging by his flushed appearance, he had something of a temperature.  More wounded were brought or helped in--men as well as officers--till the white walls of the carriage were lined with blood-stained, mud-covered khaki figures, lying, sitting, and propped up in various positions.  The Medical Officer in charge of the train came round and asked us what we should like to drink for dinner.  \"Would you like whisky-and-soda, or beer, or lemonade?\" he questioned me. This sounded pleasant to my ears, but I only asked for a lemonade.  As the train drew out of the station, one caught a last glimpse of warfare--an aeroplane, wheeling round in the evening sky amongst a swarm of tell-tale smoke-puffs, the explosions of \"Archie\" shells.            *       *       *       *       *  PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA         *       *       *       *       *     The following pages contain advertisements of a few of the Macmillan books on kindred subjects.     Ambulance 464: Encore des Blesses  BY JULIEN H. BRYAN                                        _Illustrated. Cloth, 12mo._       Here we have the story of the experiences of a Princeton      Junior--a boy of seventeen, who went to the war and drove an      ambulance car in the Verdun and Champagne sectors. He tells      exactly what he saw and heard in the American Ambulance      Corps, bringing his story down to August, 1917. His accounts      are modest, interesting, sometimes amusing--always vivid.       War books by soldiers are very popular these days. The      author-fighter has contributed some of the most informing      volumes that have been issued on the great conflict. Of all      of those who have been to the front and have returned to      write about it, no one, perhaps, has had more unusual      experiences than fell to the lot of this youth. He has      written a book in which he tells what happened to him and his      immediate associates; a book that is remarkable for the      thrilling character of its narrative, the spirit of good      humor, of adventure and excitement which runs through it.       Mr. Bryan had his kodak with him and his text is illustrated      with many altogether unusual pictures, giving a new and clear      idea as to the war and its method of prosecution.     THE MACMILLAN COMPANY   Publishers   64-66 Fifth Avenue   New York     _MASEFIELD'S NEW WAR BOOK_  The Old Front Line  BY JOHN MASEFIELD                                  _Illustrated. Cloth, 12mo. $1.00_       What Mr. Masefield did for the Gallipoli Campaign, he now      does for the Campaign in France. His subject is the old front      line as it was when the battle of the Somme began. His      account is vivid and gripping--a huge conflict seen through      the eyes of a great poet, this is the book.       Of the importance of the battle, Mr. Masefield writes:       \"The old front line was the base from which the battle      proceeded. It was the starting place. The thing began there.      It was the biggest battle in which our people were ever      engaged, and so far it has led to bigger results than any      battle of this war since the Battle of the Marne. It caused a      great falling back of the enemy armies. It freed a great      tract of France, seventy miles long, by from ten to      twenty-five miles broad. It first gave the enemy the      knowledge that he was beaten.\"    THE MACMILLAN COMPANY   Publishers   64-66 Fifth Avenue   New York     A War Nurse's Diary                                        _Illustrated, Cloth, $1.25_       High courage, deep sympathy without sentimentality, and an      all-saving sense of humor amid dreadful and depressing      conditions are the salient features of this little book. The      author, who preserves her anonymity, has been \"over the top\"      in the fullest sense. She has faced bombardments and aerial      raids, she has calmly removed her charges under fire, she has      tended the wounded and dying amid scenes of carnage and      confusion, and she has created order and comfort where but a      short time before all was chaos and suffering. And all the      while she marvels at the uncomplaining fortitude of others,      never counting her own. Many unusual experiences have      befallen this \"war nurse\" and she writes of them all in a      gripping, vivid fashion.     THE MACMILLAN COMPANY   Publishers   64-66 Fifth Avenue   New York     Victor Chapman's Letters from France                                               _Illustrated, $2.00_       Victor Chapman was studying architecture in Paris when the      war broke out and at once he joined the French Foreign      Legion. A year later he was transferred to the Aviation Corps      and went to the front as pilot in the American Escadrille.      This volume comprises his letters written to his family,      covering the full period of his service from September, 1914,      to a few days before his death. \"They are,\" says the _New      York Times_ in commenting on them, \"graphic letters that show      imaginative feeling and unusual faculty for literary      expression and they are filled with details of his daily life      and duties and reflect the keen satisfaction he was taking in      his experiences. He knew many of those Americans who have won      distinction, and some of them death, in the Legion and the      Aviation Service, and there is frequent reference to one or      another of them.... In few of the memorials to those who have      laid down their lives in this war is it possible to find      quite such a sense of a life not only fulfilled but crowned      by its sacrifice, notwithstanding its youthfulness, as one      gets from this tribute to Victor Chapman.\"     THE MACMILLAN COMPANY   Publishers   64-66 Fifth Avenue   New York          *       *       *       *       *      +-----------------------------------------------------------+     | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |     |                                     "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28145"],["title","Attack: An Infantry Subaltern's Impression of July 1st, 1916 (#8)"],["body","                      |     | Page  36: Bazencourt replaced with Bayencourt             |     | Page  45: fraggrance replaced with fragrance              |     |                                                           |     +-----------------------------------------------------------+         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
