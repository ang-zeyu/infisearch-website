A DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC.       \"In the storm, in the smoke, in the fight, I come      To help thee, dear, with my fife and my drum.      My name is Music: and, when the bell      Rings for the dead men, I rule the knell;      And, whenever the mariner wrecked through the blast      Hears the fog-bell sound, it was I who passed.      The poet hath told you how I, a young maid,      Came fresh from the gods to the myrtle shade;      And thence, by a power divine, I stole      To where the waters of the Mincius roll;      Then down by Clitumnus and Arno's vale      I wandered, passionate and pale,      Until I found me at sacred Rome,      Where one of the Medici gave me a home.      Leo--great Leo!--he worshipped me,      And the Vatican stairs for my feet were free.      And, now I am come to your glorious land,      Give me good greeting with open hand.      Remember Beethoven,--I gave him his art,--      And Sebastian Bach, and superb Mozart:      Join _those_ in my worship; and, when you go      Wherever their mighty organs blow,      Hear in them heaven's trumpets to men below.\"       T.W. PARSONS.   What is music? Quite easy is it to answer after the manner of the dictionaries, and say, \"Music is (1) a number of sounds following each other in a natural, pleasing manner; (2) the science of harmonious sounds; and (3) the art of so combining them as to please the ear.\" These are, however, only brief, cold, and arbitrary definitions: music is far more than as thus defined. Indeed, to go no farther in the description of this really sublime manifestation of the beautiful would be to very inadequately express its manifold meanings, its helpful, delightful uses. And yet the impressions made upon the mind and the depth of feeling awakened in the heart by music are such as to render only a partial (a far from satisfying one) description of the same possible, even to those most skilful and eloquent in the use of language; for, in fact, ordinary language, after exhausting all of its many resources in portraying the mind's conceptions, in depicting the heart's finer, deeper feelings, reveals, after all, its poverty, when sought to describe effects so entrancing, and emotions so deep-reaching, as those produced by music. No: the latter must be heard, it must be felt, its sweetly thrilling symphonies must touch the heart and fill the senses, in order that it may be, in its fulness, appreciated; for then it is that music is expressed in a language of most subtle power,--a language all its own, and universal, bearing with it ever an exquisitely touching pathos and sweetness that all mankind may feel.  And so I may not hope to bring here to the reader's mind more than a slight conception of what music is. Nor does he stand in need of any labored effort to teach him the nature and power, the beneficent attributes, of this beautiful art. With his own soul attuned to all the delightful sounds of melody and harmony that everywhere about him, in nature and in art, he constantly hears, the reader requires no great length of words in explanation of that which he so deeply feels, and therefore already understands. Nevertheless, a due regard for the laws of unity, as well as a sincere wish to make this volume, in all its departments, speak the befitting words of tribute to the love-inspiring art of which it aims to treat,--words which, although they may not have the merit of affording great instruction, may at least have that of furnishing to the reader some degree of pleasure,--these are the motives that must serve as an excuse for the little that follows.  I have sometimes thought that only the elevated and elegant language of poetry should be employed in describing music: for music is poetry, and poetry is music; that is, in many of their characteristics they are one and the same. But, to put this idea in another form, let us say that Music is the beautiful sister of Poetry, that other soul-expressing medium; and who would create the latter must commune with the former, and be able to bring to his uses the sweet and finishing graces of her rhythmic forms. In early times, the qualities of the poet and musician were generally actually united in the same person. The poet usually set to music, and in most instances sang, his effusions. Nor to this day have the       \"Poets, who on earth have made us heirs      Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays,\"  ceased to sing, in bewitching verse, the noble qualities of music.  I have said that music speaks a language all its own, and one that is universal. Bring together a representation of all the nations of the earth, in which body there shall be a very Babel of tongues. All will be confusion until the all-penetrating, the all-thrilling voice of music is heard. At once, silence reigns; each ear quickly catches and recognizes the delicious sounds. The language of each one in the concourse may be different: but with \"music's golden tongue\" all are alike innately acquainted; each heart beats in sympathy with the delightful, absorbing tones of melody; and all seem members of one nation.  Again: music may be called that strangely peculiar form of the beautiful, whose presence seems, indeed is, appropriate on occasions the most diverse in character. Its aid is sought alike to add to the joys of festive scenes, to soothe and elevate the heart on occasions of mourning, and to enhance the solemnity, the excellence, of divine worship.  The poet Collins, aptly associating music with the good and beautiful, calls it the \"heavenly maid.\"  Martin Luther, himself a musical composer and performer of merit, paused in his great work of religious reform to declare, \"I verily think, and am not ashamed to say, that, next to divinity, no art is comparable to music.\" And Disraeli utters this noble thought: \"Were it not for music, we might in these days say the beautiful is dead.\"       \"Touching musical harmony, whether by instrument or by      voice, it being but of high and low in sounds a      proportionable disposition, such, notwithstanding, is the      force thereof, and so pleasing effects it hath in that part      of man which is most divine, that some have thereby been      induced to think that the soul itself is or hath in it      harmony: a thing which delighteth all ages, and beseemeth      all states; a thing as seasonable in grief as in joy; as      decent being added unto actions of greatest weight and      solemnity as being used when men most sequester themselves      from action. The reason hereof is an admirable facility      which music hath to express and represent to the mind, more      inwardly than any other sensible means, the very steps and      inflections of every way, the turns and varieties of all      passion whereunto the mind is subject.\"[1]       \"I would fain know what music is. I seek it as a man seeks      eternal wisdom. Yesterday evening I walked, late in the      moonlight, in the beautiful avenue of lime-trees on the bank      of the Rhine; and I heard a tapping noise and soft singing.      At the door of a cottage, under the blooming lime-tree, sat      a mother and her twin-babies: the one lay at her breast, the      other in a cradle, which she rocked with her foot, keeping      time to her singing. In the very germ, then, when the first      trace of life begins to stir, music is the nurse of the      soul: it murmurs in the ear, and the child sleeps; the tones      are the companions of his dreams; they are the world in      which he lives. He has nothing; the babe, although cradled      in his mother's arms, is alone in the spirit: but tones find      entrance into the half-conscious soul, and nourish it as      earth nourishes the life of plants.\"[2]  [Footnote 1: Hooker.]  [Footnote 2: Bertini.]     II.  THE MUSIC OF NATURE.       \"The lark sings loud, and the throstle's song        Is heard from the depths of the hawthorn dale;      And the rush of the streamlet the vales among        Doth blend with the sighs of the whispering gale.\"       MATIN AND EVENING SONGS.   To the inventive genius of man must, of course, be attributed the present developments, and the beautiful, diversified forms, existing in musical art. But, before man was, the great Author of harmony had created what may be called the music of Nature.  Afterwards, the human ear, penetrated by sounds of melody issuing from wind, wave, or bird, the rapt mind in strange and pleasing wonder contemplating the new and charming harmonies,--then it was that man received his first impressions, and took his first lessons in delightful symphony.  Take from man all creative and performing power in music, leaving him only the ear to catch and the mind to comprehend the sounds, and there would still be left to him God's own music,--the music of Nature, which, springing as it did from eternity, shall last throughout eternity.  Passing what must appear to human comprehension as vague (an attempt at the contemplation of which would be without profit in this connection), and what has been called the \"music of the spheres,\"[3] we may proceed to briefly touch upon those forms of natural music which are ever within our hearing, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],["title","Music and Some Highly Musical People (#2)"],["body","which constantly afford us pleasure.  [Footnote 3: Reference is supposed to be made to this in the Book of Job, in these words: \"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\"]  First let us go forth into the summer woods. The eye takes in the charming prospect,--the trees dressed in beautiful green; the \"grassy carpet,\" parted ever and anon by a gliding, gurgling brooklet; the wild flower peeping up near the feet; a landscape of even surface, or at times pleasingly undulated. The atmosphere is freighted with a delightful fragrance; and from rustling bough, from warbling bird, from rippling brook, and from the joyous hum of insects almost innumerable,       \"The air is full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs,      That give delight, and hurt not.\"  All these, the beauties of animate and inanimate Nature, pleasantly affect the senses. But the chief influence there--the crowning glory of the groves--is the songs, the charming music of the birds, as they warble from tree to tree, untrammelled by the forms of art, their sweetest melodies. How often do their lightsome, inspiriting carollings ring out upon the morning air, persuasively calling us from our couches to listen in delight to Nature's minstrelsy! \"After man,\" says a writer, \"the birds occupy the highest rank in Nature's concerts. They make the woods, the gardens, and the fields resound with their merry warbles. Their warbled 'shake' has never been equalled by human gifts of voice, nor by art.\"  Indeed, it has been found that many of the songs of birds are sung in certain of the keys; while a learned musical writer has produced a book in which are printed many samples of the music often sung by birds. In very recent times it is stated, too, that birds have been taught to sing some of the popular tunes of the day; this being accomplished by placing a bird in a room for a while, allowing it to hear no other bird, and only the tune to be learned. Professor Brown of Aiken, S.C., has mocking-birds which he has taught to sing such songs as \"The Star-spangled Banner\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\" These birds were to be taken to the Centennial Exhibition, to there exhibit their marvellous skill.  A writer in \"The Monthly Reader\" thus speaks of that pretty singer the bullfinch:--       \"I heard a lady cry out to a little bird in a cage, 'Come,      Bully, Bully, sweet little Bully Bullfinch, please give us      just one more tune.'       \"And then, to my surprise, the little bird whistled the tune      of 'Yankee Doodle' as well as I could have done it myself.       \"The lady then told me about the bird. It was a bullfinch.      She had bought it in the little town of Fulda, in Germany,      where there are schools for teaching these birds to sing.       \"When a bullfinch has learned to sing two or three tunes, he      is worth from forty to sixty dollars; for he will bring that      price in London or Boston or New York.       \"To teach them, the birds are put in classes of about six      each, and kept for a time in a dark room. Here, when their      food is given them, they are made to hear music. And so,      when they have had their food, or when they want more food,      they will sing, and try to sing a tune like that they have      just heard; for perhaps they think it has something to do      with what they eat.\"  But as, in presenting these examples of the musical teachableness of the \"feathered songsters,\" I am entering the domain of music as an art, I will not further digress. Certain it is, too, that these delightful musicians of Nature do not require the aid of the skill of man; nor is it desirable, for the sake of musical effect at least, that their own wild, free, and glad-hearted warblings should be changed. They are better as they are, affording as they do a pleasing contrast, and adding freshness and variety to the many other forms of music. Some one, dwelling upon the charming beauty of bird-music, has expressed in words of very excusable rapture the following unique wish:--       \"Oh! had I but the power        To set the proper words      To all your glorious melodies,        My sweet-voiced birds,       When words and dainty music        Would each to each belong,      Together we might give the world        A _perfect_ song.\"  But I need not refer at greater length to these sweet harmonists of Nature, since scarce an ear is so dull, and few hearts are so cold, as not to be charmed and cheered by their unceasing, joyous melodies.  It might well be thought that flowers, those \"fairy ministers of grace,\" with their delicately tinted, variegated, perfect hues, that emit, in their sweet, delicious perfumes, what may be called the \"breath of heaven,\" possess in these delightful qualities full enough to instruct and charm mankind. But there is a flower, it seems, that, inviting the aid of the evening zephyr, adds sweet music to its other fascinating beauties. Let the poet Twombly sing of the music-giving--       BLUE HAREBELL.       Have ye ever heard in the twilight dim            A low, soft strain      That ye fancied a distant vesper-hymn,            Borne o'er the plain      By the zephyrs that rise on perfumed wing,      When the sun's last glances are glimmering?       Have ye heard that music, with cadence sweet            And merry peal,      Ring out like the echoes of fairy feet            O'er flowers that steal?       The source of that whispering strain I'll tell;            For I have listened oft      To the music faint of the blue harebell            In the gloaming soft:      'Tis the gay fairy-folk the peal who ring,      At even-time, for their banqueting.       And gayly the trembling bells peal out            With gentle tongue;      While elves and fairies career about            'Mid dance and song.  It would be tedious to enumerate and dwell upon all the very numerous music-making agencies of the natural world; and I shall therefore allude only to a few of those not already mentioned.  Many have heard the sounds of waterfalls, and know that from them issues a kind of majestic music, which, to be appreciated, must be heard. Musicians of finely-cultivated ears have studied the tones of waterfalls; and two of them, Messrs. A. and E. Heim, say that a mass of falling water gives       \"The chord of C sharp, and also the non-accordant F. When C      and D sound louder than the middle note, F is heard very      fully, as a deep, dull, humming, far-resounding tone, with      a strength proportionate to the mass of the falling water.      It easily penetrates to a distance at which the other notes      are inaudible. The notes C, E, G, F, belong to all rushing      water, and in great falls are sometimes in different      octaves. Small falls give the same notes one or two octaves      higher. In the stronger falls, F is heard the most easily;      in the weak ones, C. At the first attempt, C is most readily      detected. Persons with musical cultivation, on attempting to      sing near rapidly-moving water, naturally use the key of C      sharp, or of F sharp if near a great fall.\"  Somewhat similar to waterfalls in the character of the tunes they produce (being distinguished, however, generally, by a greater softness and more gentle flow) are the waves, that, handsome in form, roll majestically shoreward, greeting the ear with a strange, dirge-like, yet, as it seems to the writer, pleasing harmony.  Here is given a duet between the waves and zephyrs:--       \"We sit beneath the dreaming moon,        And gaze upon the sea:      Our hearts with Nature are in tune;        List to her minstrelsy.      The waves chant low and soft their song,        And kiss the rocks in glee;      While zephyrs their sweet lay prolong,--        Their love-song to the sea.\"  There is a pretty, delicate music made by the rippling, gurgling brooklet, as its transparent waters glide over its pebbly bottom. And there's the musical sea-shell. Place it to the ear, and you shall catch, as if in the far distance, the reverberating roll of the billowy ocean as it sings a mighty song. To this the poet Wordsworth very gracefully refers in the following lines:--                             \"I have seen      A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract      Of inland ground, applying to his ear      The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell:      To which, in silence hushed, his very soul      Listened intensely, and his countenance soon      Brightened with joy; for from within were heard      Murmurings whereby the monitor expressed      Mysterious union with its native sea.\"  And an anonymous writer (it does not seem that he had good cause for hiding his name) thus discourses on the music of the sea:--       \"The gray, unresting sea,        Adown the bright and belting shore      Breaking in untold melody,        Makes music evermore.       Centuries of vanished time,        Since this glad earth's primeval morn,      Have heard the grand, unpausing chime,        Momently new born.       Like as in cloistered piles        Rich bursts of massive sounds upswell,      Ringing along dim-lighted aisles        With spirit-trancing spell;       So on the surf-white strand        Chants of deep peal the sea-waves raise,      Like voices from a viewless land        Hymning a hymn of praise.       By times, in thunder-notes,        The booming billows shoreward surge;      By times a silver laugh it floats;        By times a low, soft dirge.       Souls more ennobled grow        Listing the worldly anthem rise;      Discords are drowned in the great flow        Of Nature's harmonies.       Men change and 'cease to be,'        And empires rise and grow and fall;      But the weird music of the sea        Lives, and outlives them all.       The mystic song shall last        Till time itself no more shall be;      Till seas and shores have passed,        Lost in eternity.\"  But the wind is one of Nature's chief musicians.
