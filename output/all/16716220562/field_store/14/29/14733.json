His next act was to open the flap of his belt holster and carefully withdraw the revolver which now rarely left his side.  After a short examination of the mechanism, this came in for a good rub and polish from the handkerchief before it was replaced.  \"Nearly had one,\" cried his companion, after a snatch at the line he held.  \"Didn't get a bite, did you?\"  \"Bite?  A regular pull; but I was a bit too late.  Why don't you attend to your fishing instead of fiddle-faddling with that revolver?  Pull up your line.\"  Drew Lennox smiled doubtingly as he drew the leather cover of the holster over the stud before stooping to take hold of the line at his feet.  \"I believe that was all fancy, Master Bobby,\" he said.  \"If there have been any fish here, the crocodiles have cleared them out, or the Boers have netted them.  It will be dry biscuit for us again to-night, or--My word!\"  \"Got one?\" cried Dickenson, excited in turn, for his brother officer's manner had suddenly changed from resigned indifference to eager action, as he felt the violent jerk given to his line by something or other that he had hooked.  \"Got one?  Yes; a monster.  Look how he pulls.\"  \"Oh, be careful; be careful old chap!\" cried Dickenson wildly, and he left the stone upon which he was standing to hurry to his friend's side. \"That's a fifteen or twenty pound fish, and it means dinner for the mess.\"  \"I believe it's a young crocodile,\" said Lennox.  \"My word, how it tugs!\"  \"Play it--play it, man!  Don't pull, or you'll drag the hook out of its jaws.  Give it line.\"  \"Can't; he has it all out.\"  \"Then you'll have to follow it down-stream.\"  \"What! go into the water?  No, thanks.\"  \"What! shrink from wading when you've got on a fish like that at the end of your line?  Here, let me come.\"  \"No; I'll play the brute and land him myself.  But, I say, it's a fine one of some kind; pulls like an eel.  Look how it's wagging its head from side to side.\"  \"Better let me come,\" said Dickenson, whose face was scarlet from excitement.  \"Get out!\"  \"I'll never forgive you if you lose that fish, Lennox, old man.\"  \"Not going to lose him.  Look; he has turned, and is coming up-stream;\" for the line, which a few moments before was being violently jerked, suddenly grew slack.  \"Gone! gone! gone!\" cried Dickenson, with something of a sob in his throat.  \"You be quiet!\" said Drew.  \"I thought, it was only a bit of wood a few minutes ago.\"  \"Fish, of course, and the hook's broken away.\"  \"Think so?\" was the cool reply, as foot after foot of the line was drawn in.  \"I was beginning to be of the opinion that he had given it up as a bad job and was swimming right in to surrender.\"  \"No; I told you so.  You've dragged the hook right out the fish's jaws, and--Oh, I'm blessed!\"  \"With a good opinion of yourself, Bobby,\" said Drew, laughing; for after softly hauling in about eight or ten yards of the stout water-cord he felt the fish again, when it gave one smart tug at the line and dashed up past the stone, running out all that had been recovered in a very few seconds.  Directly after there was a check and a jerk at the officer's hand, while a cry escaped his lips as he let the line go and stooped to pick up his rifle.  \"That's no good,\" began Dickenson.  \"Quick, man!  Down with you!--Ah! you've left your rifle.  Cover!\"  \"Oh!\" ejaculated Dickenson; and his jaw dropped, and he stood motionless, staring across the river at the sight before him on the other bank.  \"Hands up!  Surrender!  You're surrounded!\" shouted a rough voice. \"Drop that rifle, or we fire.\"  Drew Lennox was bent nearly double in the act of raising it as these words were uttered, and he saw before him some twenty or thirty barrels, whose holders had covered him, and apparently only awaited another movement on the young officer's part to shoot him down as they would have done a springbok.  \"Oh dear!\" groaned Dickenson; \"to come to this!\"  And he was in the act of raising his hands in token of surrender when his comrade's head caught him full in the chest and drove him back among the bushes which grew densely at the mouth of the gully.  _Crack! crack! crack! crack_! rang out half-a-dozen rifles, and Lennox, who as the consequence of his spring was lying right across his comrade, rolled off him.  \"Hurt?\" panted the latter in agonised tones.  \"No.  Now then, crawl after me.\"  \"What are you going to do?\"  \"Creep up level with your rifle, and cover you while you get it.\"  \"Is it any use, old fellow?  There's about fifty of them over yonder.\"  \"I don't care if there are five hundred,\" growled Lennox through his teeth.  \"Come along; we must keep it up till help comes from the laager.\"  \"Then you mean to fight?\" panted Dickenson as he crawled after his leader; while the Boers from the other side kept up a dropping fire right into and up the gully, evidently under the impression that the two officers were making that their line of retreat instead of creeping under cover of the bushes at the foot of the cliff-like bank, till Drew stopped opposite where the abandoned rifle lay upon the stone Dickenson had left, so far unseen.  Where they stopped the bushes were shorter and thinner, and they had a good view of the enemy, who had taken cover close to the edge of their bank and were keeping up a steady fire, sending their bullets searching the dense growth of the ravine, while about a dozen mounted men now appeared, cantering along towards where there was a ford about a mile lower down.  \"That's to surround us, old man,\" said Dickenson.  \"The miserable liars! There isn't a man this side.  But oh, my chest!  You've knocked in some of my ribs.\"  \"Hang your ribs!  We must get that rifle.\"  \"Wait till I get my wind back,\" panted Dickenson.--\"Oh, what a fool I was to lay it down!\"  \"You were, Bobby; you were,\" said Drew quietly.  \"Here, hold mine, and I'll dash out and bring it back.\"  \"No, you don't!\" cried the young officer; and as he crouched there on all fours he bounded out like a bear, seized the rifle from where it lay, and rushed back, followed by the shouts and bullets of four or five Boers, who saw him, but not quickly enough to get an effective aim.  \"Now call me a fool again,\" panted Dickenson, shuffling himself behind a stone.  It was Drew Lennox's rifle that spoke, not he, as in reply to the fire they had brought upon them he took careful aim and drew trigger, when one of the Boers sprang up fully into sight, turned half-round, threw up his rifle, and fell back over the edge of the cliff among the bushes similar to those which sheltered the young Englishmen.  \"Good shot, lad!\"  \"Yes.  On his own head be it,\" said Lennox.  \"A cowardly ambush.  Fire as soon as you can steady yourself.  Where are you?  I can't see you.\"  \"Ahint this stone, laddie,\" replied Dickenson coolly enough now.  \"And you?\"  \"Behind this one here.\"  \"That's right; I was afraid you were only bushed.  Ah! my turn,\"--_crack_!--\"now.  Bull's-eye, old man.\"  As the words left his lips Lennox fired again, and another Boer who was badly hidden sprang up and dropped back.  \"Two less,\" said Drew in a husky whisper, while _crack! crack_! went the Boer rifles, and a peculiar shattering echo arose from the far side of the river as the bullets flattened upon the rocks or cut the bushes like knives; while from being few in number they rapidly became more, those of the enemy who had been searching the gully down which the young men had come now concentrating their fire upon the little cluster of rocks and trees behind which they were hidden.  \"Don't waste a cartridge, Bob lad,\" said Lennox, whose voice sounded strange to his companion, \"and hold your magazine in case they try a rush.\"  \"Or for those fellows who'll come round by the ford,\" replied Dickenson.  \"Never mind them.  The firing will bring our lads out, and they'll tackle those gentlemen.\"  \"All right.--Ah!  I've been waiting for you, my friend,\" whispered Dickenson, and he fired quickly at one of the enemy who was creeping along towards a spot from which he probably thought he would be able to command the spot where the young Englishmen lay.  But he never reached it.  He just exposed himself once for a few moments, crawling like a short, thick snake.  Then his rifle was jerked upwards to the full extent of the poor wretch's arm and fell back.  He made no other movement, but lay quite still, while the rifles around him cracked and the bullets pattered faster and faster about where the two young men were hidden.  \"I say, how queer your voice is!\" said Dickenson.  \"Not hurt, are you?\"  \"No, and yes.  This hurts me, Bob lad.  I almost wish I wasn't such a good shot.\"  \"I don't,\" muttered the other.  \"I want to live.\"  Then aloud, \"Don't talk like that, man!  It's their lives or ours.  Hit every one you can.--Phew! that was near my skull.  I say, I don't call this coming fishing.\"  He turned towards his comrade with a comical look of dismay upon his countenance after a very narrow escape from death, a bullet having passed through his cap, when _whizz! whizz! whirr_! half-a-dozen more bullets passed dangerously near.  \"Mind, for goodness' sake!\" shouted Lennox, in a voice full of the agony he felt.  \"Don't you see that you are exposing yourself?\"  \"What am I to do?\" cried the young officer angrily.  \"If I lean an inch that way they fire at me, and if I turn this way it's the same.\"  \"Creep closer to the stone.\"  \"Then I can't take aim.\"  \"Then don't try.  We've got to shelter till their firing brings help.\"  \"Oh, it's all very fine to talk, Drew, old chap, but I'm not going to lie here like a target for them to practise at without giving the beggars tit for tat.--Go it, you ugly Dutch ruffians!  There, how do you like that?\"  He fired as he spoke, after taking careful aim at another, who, from a post of vantage,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27897"],["title","The Kopje Garrison: A Story of the Boer War (#2)"],["body","on sending his bullets dangerously near.  \"Did you hit?\" asked Lennox.  \"I think so,\" was the reply.  \"He has backed away.\"  \"We must keep on firing at them,\" said Lennox; \"but keep your shots for those who are highest up there among the trees.\"  He set the example as he spoke, firing, after taking a long and careful aim, at a big-bearded fellow who had crawled some distance to his right so as to try and take the pair in the flank.  The Boer had reached his fresh position by making a rush, and his first shot struck the stones close to Drew's face, sending one up to inflict a stinging blow on the cheek, while in the ricochet it went whizzing by Dickenson's shoulder, making him start and utter an angry ejaculation, for he had again exposed himself.  \"Wish I could break myself off bad habits,\" he muttered, as a little shower of bullets came whizzing about them, but too late to harm.  There was a certain amount of annoyance in his tones, for he noted that, while he had started up a little, his companion, in spite of the stinging blow he had received on the cheek, lay perfectly motionless upon his chest, waiting his time, finger on trigger, and ready to give it a gentle pressure when he had ceased to aim at one particular spot where he had seen the Boer's head for a moment.  He did not have long to wait; for the moment the Boer had fired he slightly raised his head to try and mark the effect of his shot.  That was sufficient.  Lennox squeezed rather than pulled the trigger, and as the smoke rose the bush which had sheltered the Boer moved violently for a few moments, and all was still there; while the young officer quickly reloaded and waited to see if another man took his enemy's place.    CHAPTER TWO.  WHAT THEY CAUGHT.  \"Serve him right!\"  Dickenson growled more than spoke.  \"There's another chap creeping away yonder so as to enfilade us from the left.\"  \"Well, you know what to do,\" said Lennox grimly.  Dickenson uttered a grunt, and, paying no further heed to the bullets that kept on spattering about the rocks, every now and then striking up a shower of loose stones, waited, patiently watching a spot that he had marked down a couple of hundred yards away up the river to his left. For he had seen one of the most pertinacious of their aggressors draw back, apparently without reason.  \"He couldn't have known that I meant to pick him out for my next shot,\" the young officer said to himself, \"and he couldn't have been hurt, so he's up to the same sort of game as that fellow old Lennox brought down.\"  He turned his head sharply, not on account of a bullet coming too close, but to learn the effect of another shot from his companion.  \"Hit or miss?\" he said gruffly.  \"Hit,\" was the laconic reply.  Dickenson had only glanced round, and then fixed his eyes once more upon the little clump of bushes he had before noted.  \"That's the place he'll show at for certain,\" he muttered, and getting the sight of his rifle well upon one particular spot where a big grey stone reared itself up level with the tops of the bushes, he waited for quite five minutes, which were well dotted with leaden points.  \"Ha!  I was right,\" said Dickenson to himself, for all at once he caught a glimpse of the barrel of a rifle reared up and then lowered down over the top of the stone in his direction.  The distance was great, and the rifle-barrel looked no larger than a metal ramrod, but the clearness of the South African air showed it plainly enough; and hugging himself closer together, the young officer laid his cheek close to the stock of his piece, closed his left eye, and glanced along the barrel, waiting for the opportunity he felt sure must come.  The excitement of the moment made his heart beat fast, and his eyes glittered as he gazed; but there was nothing to see now save a beautiful green clump of thorn bush, with the great grey granite block in its midst.  \"I make it two hundred and fifty yards good,\" he said to himself, and he raised the sight of his rifle.  \"I ought to be able to hit a steady mark at that distance when cool, and I feel as cool now as a cucumber. They're grand shots these chaps, and if he can make out my face he'll bring me down as sure as a gun; and if he does there's new mourning to be got at home, and a lot of crying, and the old lady and the girls breaking their hearts about stupid old me, so I must have first shot if I can get it.  Very stupid of them at home.  They don't know what a fool every one thinks me out here.  Nice, though, all the same, and I like 'em--well, love 'em, say--love 'em all too well to let them go breaking their hearts about me; so here goes, Mr Boer.  But he doesn't go.  He must be waiting up there, because I saw his gun.  What a while he is! Or is it I'm impatient and think the time long?  Couldn't have been mistaken.  I'd speak to old Lennox, but if I do it's a chance if the enemy don't show and get first shot.\"  Dickenson seemed to cease thinking for a few moments, and lay listening to the rattle of the Boers' guns across the river and the spattering echo-like sounds of the bullets striking around.  Then he began to think again, with his eyes fixed upon the top of the grey stone in the distance, and noting now that a clearly-cut shadow from a long strand was cast right across the top of the stone.  \"That's just in front of where his face ought to be when he takes aim,\" thought the young officer.--\"Aim at me, to put them at home in mourning and make them go to church the next Sunday and hear our old vicar say a kind word for our gallant young friend who died out in the Transvaal. But he sha'n't if I can help it.  Nasty, sneaking, cowardly beggar!  I never did him any harm, and I don't want to do him any harm; but as he means to shoot me dead, why, common-sense seems to say, `Have first shot at him, Bobby, old chap, if you can, for you're only twenty, and as the days of man are seventy years all told, he's going to do you out of fifty, which would be a dead robbery, of course; and in this case a dead robbery means murder into the bargain.'\"  Bob Dickenson's musings stopped short for a few moments while he looked in vain for some sign of his enemy.  Then he went on again in a desultory way, paying no heed to the bullets flying over and around him, and for the time being forgetting all about his comrade, who kept on firing whenever he had an opportunity.  \"What a pity it seems!\" he mused.  \"Birds flitting about, bees and butterflies sipping the honey out of the flowers, which are very beautiful; so is this gully, with the sparkling water and ferns and things all a-growing and a-blowing, as they say.  Why, I should like nothing better than loafing round here enjoying myself by looking about and doing no harm to anything.  I wouldn't even catch the fish if I wasn't so hungry; and yet, here I am with a magazine-rifle trying to shoot a Boer dead.  \"Humph! yes,\" he continued after a short pause; \"but only so that he sha'n't shoot me dead.  This is being a soldier, this is.  Why was I such a fool as to be one?  The uniform and the band and the idea of being brave and all that sort of thing, I suppose.  Rather different out here.  No band; no uniform but this dirt-coloured khaki; no bed to sleep on; no cover but the tent; roasting by day, freezing by night: hardly a chance to wash one's self, and nothing to eat; and no one to look at you but the Boers, and when they come to see what the soldiers of the Queen are like they send word they are there with bullets, bless 'em!  Well, I suppose it's all right.  We must have soldiers, and I wanted to be one, and now I am one there does seem to be something more than the show in doing one's duty bravely, as they call it.  \"Well,\" he muttered at last, \"this is getting monotonous, and I'm growing tired of it.  If they do shoot us both, they'll have had to pay for it.  Why, they must have used a couple of hundred cartridges.  Not very good work for such crack shots as they are said to be.  If they spend a hundred cartridges to shoot one buck, it would come cheaper to buy their meat.  \"All fancy,\" he muttered directly after; \"that fellow couldn't have been going where I thought, and yet it seemed so likely.  There's the clump of trees, and the very stone a fellow would make for to rest his rifle on when he took aim from his snug hiding-place.  But there's no one there.  The sun shines right upon it, so that I could see in a moment if a Boer was there.  His face would be just beyond that shadow cast so clearly by what must be a dead bough.  Yes, all a fancy of mine.\"  \"Bob!\" cried Lennox.  \"Hullo!\"  \"I shall want some of your cartridges if help doesn't come soon.\"  Bob Dickenson made no further reply, but lay gazing with one eye along the barrel of his rifle; for as his comrade spoke it suddenly occurred to him that the top of the grey block of granite looked a little different, but in what way he could not have explained.  He noted, too, that there was a tiny flash of light such as might have been thrown off a bright crystal of feldspar, and without pause now he held his rifle more firmly, laid the sight upon the flashing light, and the next moment he would have pulled the trigger.  But ere he could tighten his finger upon the little curved piece of steel within the guard of his piece, there was a flash, a puff of smoke, and a sensation as if a wasp had whizzed by his ear.  He did not move, only waited while one might have counted ten, and then tightened his grasp.  \"Bah!\" he ejaculated as the little puff of smoke rose slowly, \"how this rifle kicks!  Humph!\" as the smoke cleared rapidly as soon as it rose enough for the wind to catch it, \"I was right after all.\"  \"Hit?\" asked Lennox.  \"Yes; and just in time, for we should have been in an awkward place directly.\"  \"Yes; and I'm afraid we shall be all the same,\" said Lennox.  \"Try if you can do any good at a couple of fellows across yonder.  I can't touch them from where I lie, and if I move I shall shoot no more.\""]]]
