He opened the drawer, pulled out the transfers, tossed them across to Mr. Staines.  \"Key,\" said Bones, chucking it down after the document.  He picked up his cheque and tore it into twenty pieces.  \"That's all,\" said Bones, and Mr. Staines beat a tremulous retreat.  When the man had gone, Bones returned to the girl who was sitting at her table before her typewriter.  It was observable that her lips were compressed too.  \"Young Miss Whitland,\" said Bones, and his voice was hoarser than ever, \"never, never in my life will I ever forgive myself!\"  \"Oh, please, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the girl a little wearily, \"haven't I told you that I have forgiven you?  And I am sure you had no horrid thought in your mind, and that you just acted impulsively.\"  Bones bowed his head, at once a sign of agreement and a crushed spirit.  \"The fact remains, dear old miss,\" he said brokenly, \"that I did kiss you in that beastly old private vault.  I don't know what made me do it,\" he gulped, \"but I did it.  Believe me, young miss, that spot was sacred.  I wanted to buy the building to preserve it for all time, so that no naughty old foot should tread upon that hallowed ground.  You think that's nonsense!\"  \"Mr. Tibbetts.\"  \"Nonsense, I say, romantic and all that sort of rot.\"  Bones threw out his arms.  \"I must agree with you.  But, believe me, Stivvins' Wharf is hallowed ground, and I deeply regret that you would not let me buy it and turn it over to the jolly old Public Trustee or one of those johnnies....  You do forgive me?\"  She laughed up in his face, and then Bones laughed, and they laughed together.     CHAPTER IV  THE PLOVER LIGHT CAR  The door of the private office opened and after a moment closed.  It was, in fact, the private door of the private office, reserved exclusively for the use of the Managing Director of Schemes Limited. Nevertheless, a certain person had been granted the privilege of ingress and egress through that sacred portal, and Mr. Tibbetts, yclept Bones, crouching over his desk, the ferocity of his countenance intensified by the monocle which was screwed into his eye, and the terrific importance of his correspondence revealed by his disordered hair and the red tongue that followed the movements of his pen, did not look up.  \"Put it down, put it down, young miss,\" he murmured, \"on the table, on the floor, anywhere.\"  There was no answer, and suddenly Bones paused and scowled at the half-written sheet before him.  \"That doesn't look right.\"  He shook his head.  \"I don't know what's coming over me.  Do you spell 'cynical' with one 'k' or two?\"  Bones looked up.  He saw a brown-faced man, with laughing grey eyes, a tall man in a long overcoat, carrying a grey silk hat in his hand.  \"Pardon me, my jolly old intruder,\" said Bones with dignity, \"this is a private----\"  Then his jaw dropped and he leant on the desk for support.  \"Not my----  Good heavens!\" he squeaked, and then leapt across the room, carrying with him the flex of his table lamp, which fell crashing to the floor.  \"Ham, you poisonous old reptile!\"  He seized the other's hand in his bony paw, prancing up and down, muttering incoherently.  \"Sit down, my jolly old Captain.  Let me take your overcoat.  Well! Well!  Well!  Give me your hat, dear old thing--dear old Captain, I mean.  This is simply wonderful!  This is one of the most amazin' experiences I've ever had, my dear old sportsman and officer.  How long have you been home?  How did you leave the Territory?  Good heavens! We must have a bottle on this!\"  \"Sit down, you noisy devil,\" said Hamilton, pushing his erstwhile subordinate into a chair, and pulling up another to face him.  \"So this is your boudoir!\"  He glanced round admiringly.  \"It looks rather like the waiting-room of a _couturière_.\"  \"My dear old thing,\" said the shocked Bones, \"I beg you, if you please, remember, remember----\"  He lowered his voice, and the last word was in a hoarse whisper, accompanied by many winks, nods, and pointings at and to a door which led from the inner office apparently to the outer. \"There's a person, dear old man of the world--a young person--well brought up----\"  \"What the----\" began Hamilton.  \"Don't be peeved!\"  Bones's knowledge of French was of the haziest. \"Remember, dear old thing,\" he said solemnly, wagging his inky forefinger, \"as an employer of labour, I must protect the young an' innocent, my jolly old skipper.\"  Hamilton looked round for a missile, and could find nothing better than a crystal paper-weight, which looked too valuable to risk.  \"'_Couturière_,'\" he said acidly, \"is French for 'dressmaker.'\"  \"French,\" said Bones, \"is a language which I have always carefully avoided.  I will say no more--you mean well, Ham.\"  Thereafter followed a volley of inquiries, punctuated at intervals by genial ceremony, for Bones would rise from his chair, walk solemnly round the desk, and as solemnly shake hands with his former superior.  \"Now, Bones,\" said Hamilton at last, \"will you tell me what you are doing?\"  Bones shrugged his shoulders.  \"Business,\" he said briefly.  \"A deal now and again, dear old officer. Make a thousand or so one week, lose a hundred or so the next.\"  \"But what are you doing?\" persisted Hamilton.  Again Bones shrugged, but with more emphasis.  \"I suppose,\" he confessed, with a show of self-deprecation which his smugness belied, \"I suppose I am one of those jolly old spiders who sit in the centre of my web, or one of those perfectly dinky little tigers who sit in my jolly old lair, waiting for victims.  \"Of course, it's cruel sport\"--he shrugged again, toying with his ivory paper-knife--\"but one must live.  In the City one preys upon other ones.\"  \"Do the other ones do any preying at all?\" asked Hamilton.  Up went Bones's eyebrows.  \"They try,\" he said tersely, and with compressed lips.  \"Last week a fellow tried to sell me his gramophone, but I had a look at it.  As I suspected, it had no needle.  A gramophone without a needle,\" said Bones, \"as you probably know, my dear old musical one, is wholly useless.\"  \"But you can buy them at a bob a box,\" said Hamilton.  Bones's face fell.  \"Can you really?\" he demanded.  \"You are not pulling my leg, or anything?  That's what the other fellow said.  I do a little gambling,\" Bones went on, \"not on the Stock Exchange or on the race-course, you understand, but in Exchanges.\"  \"Money Exchanges?\"  Bones bowed his head.  \"For example,\" he said, \"to-day a pound is worth thirty-two francs, to-morrow it is worth thirty-four francs.  To-day a pound is worth four dollars seventy-seven----\"  \"As a matter of fact, it is three dollars ninety-seven,\" interrupted Hamilton.  \"Ninety-seven or seventy-seven,\" said Bones irritably, \"what is four shillings to men like you or me, Hamilton?  We can well afford it.\"  \"My dear chap,\" said Hamilton, pardonably annoyed, \"there is a difference of four shillings between your estimate and the rate.\"  \"What is four shillings to you or me?\" asked Bones again, shaking his head solemnly.  \"My dear old Ham, don't be mean.\"  There was a discreet tap on the door, and Bones rose with every evidence of agitation.  \"Don't stir, dear old thing,\" he pleaded in a husky whisper.  \"Pretend not to notice, dear old Ham.  Don't be nervous--wonderful young lady----\"  Then, clearing his throat noisily, \"Come in!\" he roared in the tone that a hungry lion might have applied to one of the early Christian martyrs who was knocking by mistake on the door of his den.  In spite of all injunctions, Hamilton did look, and he did stare, and he did take a great deal of notice, for the girl who came in was well worth looking at.  He judged her to be about the age of twenty-one. \"Pretty\" would be too feeble a word to employ in describing her.  The russet-brown hair, dressed low over her forehead, emphasized the loveliness of eyes set wide apart and holding in their clear depths all the magic and mystery of womanhood.  She was dressed neatly.  He observed, too, that she had an open book under her arm and a pencil in her hand, and it dawned upon him slowly that this radiant creature was--Bones's secretary!  Bones's secretary!  He stared at Bones, and that young man, very red in the face, avoided his eye.  Bones was standing by the desk, in the attitude of an after-dinner speaker who was stuck for the right word.  In moments of extreme agitation Bones's voice became either a growl or a squeak--the bottom register was now in exercise.  \"Did--did you want me, young miss?\" he demanded gruffly.  The girl at the door hesitated.  \"I'm sorry--I didn't know you were engaged.  I wanted to see you about the Abyssinian----\"  \"Come in, come in, certainly,\" said Bones more gruffly than ever.  \"A new complication, young miss?\"  She laid a paper on the desk, taking no more notice of Hamilton than if he were an ornament on the chimney-piece.  \"The first instalment of the purchase price is due to-day,\" she said.  \"Is it?\" said Bones, with his extravagant surprise.  \"Are you certain, young miss?  This day of all days--and it's a Thursday, too,\" he added unnecessarily.  The girl smiled and curled her lip, but only for a second.  \"Well, well,\" said Bones, \"it's a matter of serious importance.  The cheque, jolly old young miss, we will sign it and you will send it off. Make it out for the full amount----\"  \"For the three thousand pounds?\" said the girl.  \"For the three thousand pounds,\" repeated Bones soberly.  He put in his monocle and glared at her.  \"For the three thousand pounds,\" he repeated.  She stood waiting, and Bones stood waiting, he in some embarrassment as to the method by which the interview might be terminated and his secretary dismissed without any wound to her feelings.  \"Don't you think to-morrow would do for the cheque?\" she asked.  \"Certainly, certainly,\" said Bones.  \"Why not?  To-morrow's Friday, ain't it?\"  She inclined her head and walked out of the room, and Bones cleared his throat once more.  \"Bones----\"  The young man turned to meet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],["title","Ali Pacha (#0)"],["body","*ALI PACHA*                                    _By_                          *Alexandre Dumas, Pere*           _From the Set of Eight Volumes of “Celebrated Crimes”_                                     1910     CONTENTS       *ALI PACHA*     CHAPTER I     CHAPTER II     CHAPTER III     CHAPTER IV     CHAPTER V     CHAPTER VI     CHAPTER VII     CHAPTER VIII     CHAPTER IX     CHAPTER X     CHAPTER XI     *ALI PACHA*     CHAPTER I   The beginning of the nineteenth century was a time of audacious enterprises and strange vicissitudes of fortune. Whilst Western Europe in turn submitted and struggled against a sub-lieutenant who made himself an emperor, who at his pleasure made kings and destroyed kingdoms, the ancient eastern part of the Continent; like mummies which preserve but the semblance of life, was gradually tumbling to pieces, and getting parcelled out amongst bold adventurers who skirmished over its ruins. Without mentioning local revolts which produced only short-lived struggles and trifling changes, of administration, such as that of Djezzar Pacha, who refused to pay tribute because he thought himself impregnable in his citadel of Saint-Jean-d’Acre, or that of Passevend-Oglou Pacha, who planted himself on the walls of Widdin as defender of the Janissaries against the institution of the regular militia decreed by Sultan Selim at Stamboul, there were wider spread rebellions which attacked the constitution of the Turkish Empire and diminished its extent; amongst them that of Czerni-Georges, which raised Servia to the position of a free state; of Mahomet Ali, who made his pachalik of Egypt into a kingdom; and finally that of the man whose, history we are about to narrate, Ali Tepeleni, Pacha of Janina, whose long resistance to the suzerain power preceded and brought about the regeneration of Greece.  Ali’s own will counted for nothing in this important movement. He foresaw it, but without ever seeking to aid it, and was powerless to arrest it. He was not one of those men who place their lives and services at the disposal of any cause indiscriminately; and his sole aim was to acquire and increase a power of which he was both the guiding influence, and the end and object. His nature contained the seeds of every human passion, and he devoted all his long life to their development and gratification. This explains his whole temperament; his actions were merely the natural outcome of his character confronted with circumstances. Few men have understood themselves better or been on better terms with the orbit of their existence, and as the personality of an individual is all the more striking, in proportion as it reflects the manners and ideas of the time and country in which he has lived, so the figure of Ali Pacha stands out, if not one of the most brilliant, at least one of the most singular in contemporary history.  From the middle of the eighteenth century Turkey had been a prey to the political gangrene of which she is vainly trying to cure herself to-day, and which, before long, will dismember her in the sight of all Europe. Anarchy and disorder reigned from one end of the empire to the other. The Osmanli race, bred on conquest alone, proved good for nothing when conquest failed. It naturally therefore came to pass when Sobieski, who saved Christianity under the walls of Vienna, as before his time Charles Martel had saved it on the plains of Poitiers, had set bounds to the wave of Mussulman westward invasion, and definitely fixed a limit which it should not pass, that the Osmanli warlike instincts recoiled upon themselves. The haughty descendants of Ortogrul, who considered themselves born to command, seeing victory forsake them, fell back upon tyranny. Vainly did reason expostulate that oppression could not long be exercised by hands which had lost their strength, and that peace imposed new and different labours on those who no longer triumphed in war; they would listen to nothing; and, as fatalistic when condemned to a state of peace as when they marched forth conquering and to conquer, they cowered down in magnificent listlessness, leaving the whole burden of their support on conquered peoples. Like ignorant farmers, who exhaust fertile fields by forcing crops; they rapidly ruined their vast and rich empire by exorbitant exactions. Inexorable conquerors and insatiable masters, with one hand they flogged their slaves and with the other plundered them. Nothing was superior to their insolence, nothing on a level with their greed. They were never glutted, and never relaxed their extortions. But in proportion as their needs increased on the one hand, so did their resources diminish on the other. Their oppressed subjects soon found that they must escape at any cost from oppressors whom they could neither appease nor satisfy. Each population took the steps best suited to its position and character; some chose inertia, others violence. The inhabitants of the plains, powerless and shelterless, bent like reeds before the storm and evaded the shock against which they were unable to stand. The mountaineers planted themselves like rocks in a torrent, and dammed its course with all their might. On both sides arose a determined resistance, different in method, similar in result. In the case of the peasants labour came to a stand-still; in that of the hill folk open war broke out. The grasping exactions of the tyrant dominant body produced nothing from waste lands and armed mountaineers; destitution and revolt were equally beyond their power to cope with; and all that was left for tyranny to govern was a desert enclosed by a wall.  But, all the same, the wants of a magnificent sultan, descendant of the Prophet and distributor of crowns, must be supplied; and to do this, the Sublime Porte needed money. Unconsciously imitating the Roman Senate, the Turkish Divan put up the empire for sale by public auction. All employments were sold to the highest bidder; pachas, beys, cadis, ministers of every rank, and clerks of every class had to buy their posts from their sovereign and get the money back out of his subjects. They spent their money in the capital, and recuperated themselves in the provinces. And as there was no other law than their master’s pleasure, so there, was no other guarantee than his caprice. They had therefore to set quickly to work; the post might be lost before its cost had been recovered. Thus all the science of administration resolved itself into plundering as much and as quickly as possible. To this end, the delegate of imperial power delegated in his turn, on similar conditions, other agents to seize for him and for themselves all they could lay their hands on; so that the inhabitants of the empire might be divided into three classes—those who were striving to seize everything; those who were trying to save a little; and those who, having nothing and hoping for nothing, took no interest in affairs at all.  Albania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage. Its inhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was mountainous and inaccessible. The pashas had great difficulty in collecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their bread. Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all soldiers. Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on the other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the world; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great movement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their veins, and that war was their element. Sometimes at feud with one another, canton against canton, village against village, often even house against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their sanjaks; sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never rested from combat except in an armed peace. Each tribe had its military organisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on his shoulder. When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their fields, or mowed their neighbours’, carrying off, it should be noted, the crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to trespass over pasture limits. This was the normal and regular life of the population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania. Lower Albania, less strong, was also less active and bold; and there, as in many other parts of Turkey, the dalesman was often the prey of the mountaineer. It was in the mountain districts where were preserved the recollections of Scander Beg, and where the manners of ancient Laconia prevailed; the deeds of the brave soldier were sung on the lyre, and the skilful robber quoted as an example to the children by the father of the family. Village feasts were held on the booty taken from strangers; and the favourite dish was always a stolen sheep. Every man was esteemed in proportion to his skill and courage, and a man’s chances of making a good match were greatly enhanced when he acquired the reputation of being an agile mountaineer and a good bandit.  The Albanians proudly called this anarchy liberty, and religiously guarded a state of disorder bequeathed by their ancestors, which always assured the first place to the most valiant.  It was amidst men and manners such as these that Ali Tepeleni was born. He boasted that he belonged to the conquering race, and that he descended from an ancient Anatolian family which had crossed into Albania with the troops of Bajazet Ilderim. But it is made certain by the learned researches of M. de Pouqueville that he sprang from a native stock, and not an Asiatic one, as he pretended. His ancestors were Christian Skipetars, who became Mussulmans after the Turkish invasion, and his ancestry certainly cannot be traced farther back than the end of the sixteenth century.  Mouktar Tepeleni, his grandfather, perished in the Turkish expedition against Corfu, in 1716. Marshal Schullemburg, who defended the island, having"]]]
