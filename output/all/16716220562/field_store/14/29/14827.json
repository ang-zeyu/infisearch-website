The fish-hawk preys upon fish. He sails slowly over the water until his sharp eyes see a fish, and then he dives down so straight and swift that he rarely misses.  11. Sometimes, when he comes up from the water, an old eagle that has been on the watch pounces upon him. The hawk tries to get away, but the eagle soon overtakes him.  12. With an angry scream the hawk drops the fish, and the eagle swoops downward so quickly that he catches the fish before it reaches the water. With his prey in his talons, he then soars away to his nest in the tree-tops, or high up among the rocks on the mountain-side.     LESSON XXII.  _LONG LEGS WITH FEATHERS._  [Illustration]  1. We have here the picture of a heron, a very curious bird. It has long legs, a large body, a long neck, and a long pointed bill.  2. Its toes are long and pointed, and when spread out they cover a large space. It can turn its neck and bill so that sometimes it looks as if it would wring its own neck off.  3. The heron lives on frogs and fish. With its long legs it can wade out in the shallow water, and its toes spread out so it does not sink in the mud.  4. When ready for breakfast, it wades in where the water is half-leg deep. Then it stands so still that the fish, the frogs, and the water-rats will swim all about its legs.  5. All at once, as quick as a flash, down plunges the beak, and up comes a frog from the water, and down it goes, whole, into the long throat. Another comes along, and goes the same way.  [Illustration]  6. When it has had enough, it steps ashore, cleans its feathers with its long bill, and goes to sleep standing on one leg. Its middle toe has a double nail, and with this it scratches off the down that sticks to its bill after cleaning its feathers.  7. The heron flies high in the air. When flying, its legs extend out straight behind, and its neck curls over and rests on its back.  8. The stork is another bird with long legs that wades in the water and eats frogs and fish. In Holland, the stork is so tame that it lives in the farm-yard, and often builds its nest on the house-tops.     LESSON XXIII.  _BO-PEEP AND THE ROOK._  [Illustration]       Little Bo-peep sat down on a heap       Of hay--she was tired with running;     When up came a rook, who at her did look,       And nodded his head and looked cunning.      Little Bo-peep said, \"Why do you keep       So near to me every day, sir?     With your very sharp beak, pray what do you seek,       For you always seem just in my way, sir?\"      \"Little Bo-peep, it is your sheep,       Not you, that I come to see, ma'am;     Their wool is so soft, that I want it oft       In my nest for my young ones and me, ma'am.\"      Said little Bo-peep, \"The wool you may sweep       From the hedges and many a thorn, sir;     But don't make your attacks upon my sheep's backs,       For I will not have their wool torn, sir.\"      The rook he cawed, and he hummed and hawed,       And muttered, \"What matter, what matter?\"     Bo-peep she said, \"Go--I have said no, no;       So it's useless for you to chatter.\"      *    *    *    *    *      \"There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree;     He's singing to me! He's singing to me!\"     \"And what does he say, little girl, little boy?\"     \"'Oh, the world's running over with joy!       Don't you hear? Don't you see?       Hush! Look! In my tree       I'm as happy as happy can be.'\"     LESSON XXIV.  _THE MOUSE AND ITS WAYS._  [Illustration]   1. Here are some of our near neighbors, little fellows in fur, who are so very friendly that they visit us by night and by day, and seem as much at home in our house as we are.  2. When, in the night, we hear tiny feet as they patter over the floor, or scamper across the pillow, or we find in the morning that the loaf for breakfast has been gnawed and spoiled, we are not apt to feel friendly toward the mouse.  [Illustration]  3. But, as he stands here by the trap, let us take a good look at him. We find that he has a coat of fine fur, which he always keeps clean, and a long tail that has no hair. He has whiskers like the cat; sharp claws, so that he can run up the side of a house, or climb anything that is a little rough; and eyes that can see in the night.  4. He has large ears, so that he can hear the faintest sound; and short legs, so that he can creep into the smallest hole.  5. His nose is pointed, and his under jaw is shorter than the upper one. In front, on each jaw, he has two sharp teeth, shaped like the edge of a chisel, and these he uses to gnaw with.  6. These teeth are growing all the while; and if he does not gnaw something hard nearly every day, so as to wear them off, they will soon become so long that he can not use them.     LESSON XXV.  _STORIES ABOUT MICE._  [Illustration:      When the cat's away     The mice will play.]   1. Mice increase so fast that, if we did not have some way to destroy them, they would soon overrun the house, so that we could not live in it.  2. They have their homes in the hollow walls, and can go about from one part of the house to the other without being seen; and when they smell food they gnaw a hole through the wall to get at it.  3. They are playful little animals, and may easily be tamed. When a mouse comes into the room where people live, it is ready to run away at once if anything moves.  4. But if all are still, it will scamper about the floor, and look over and smell everything in the room. The next day it will come back, and finally it will play about the room as if no one were there.  5. The mice that run about the house have gray coats; but some mice are white, with pink eyes, and these are often tamed and kept as pets.  6. A lady once tamed a common gray mouse, so that it would eat out of her hand. She also had a while mouse in a cage.  7. The gray mouse was very angry when he saw the lady pet the white mouse; and one day he some way got into the cage, and when the lady came back into the room, she found the white mouse was dead.  8. Music sometimes seems to have a strange effect upon a mouse. At one time, when a man was playing upon his violin, a mouse came out of his hole and danced about the floor. He seemed almost frantic with delight, and kept time to the music for several minutes. At last he stopped, fell over on the floor, and they found he was dead.     LESSON XXVI.  _WHITE-PAW STARTS TO SEE THE WORLD._  [Illustration]   1. White-paw was a young mouse that lived with his mother. Their home was in a barn, behind some sacks of corn, and a very nice home it was.  2. When a sunbeam flashed in upon them at midday, \"That was the sun,\" said Mrs. Mouse. When a ray of the moon stole quietly in, \"That is the moon,\" said the simple-minded creature, and thought she was very wise to know so much.  3. But little White-paw was not so contented as his mother. As he frisked and played in his one ray of sunshine or one gleam of moonlight, he had queer little fancies.  4. One morning, while at breakfast on some kernels of corn and sweet apples which his mother had brought home, he asked:  5. \"Mother, what is the world?\"  6. \"A great, terrible place!\" was the answer, and Mrs. Mouse looked very grave indeed.  7. \"How do you know, mother? Have you ever been there?\" asked the youngster.  8. \"No, child; but your father was lost in the great world, my son,\" and Mrs. Mouse's voice had a little shake in it.  9. \"Ah!\" said the son, \"that was for want of knowing better.\"  10. \"Knowing better! Why, he was the wisest mouse alive!\" said the faithful Mrs. Mouse.  11. \"I could not have been alive then,\" thought White-paw to himself. Then he said aloud, \"Mother, I have made up my mind to go and see the world; so good-by!\"  12. His mother wept. She tried to have him stay at home and be content--but all in vain; so she gave him a great hug, and he was off.     LESSON XXVII.  _WHAT THE MICE SAW IN THE FARM-YARD._  [Illustration]   1. He had not gone many steps when he met Mr. Gaffer Graybeard, a wise old mouse, and a great friend to the family.  2. \"Well, where are you off to, Mr. Pertnose?\" he asked, as the young traveler was whisking by. \"I'm off to see the world,\" was the answer.  3. \"Then good-by, for I never expect to see you again; but take an old mouse's advice, and beware of mouse-traps.\" \"What are mouse-traps?\" asked White-paw. \"You will know when you see them,\" was the answer.  4. White-paw went on his way, and just outside he met another young mouse who had also started to see the world, and the two went on together.  5. \"Oh, how big the world is!\" said White-paw, as they went into the farm-yard, and began to look about them.  6. \"And what queer creatures live in the world!\" said the other, as the cocks crowed, the hens clucked, the chickens peeped, the cow lowed, the sheep bleated, the pigs grunted, and the old house-dog barked.  7. \"If we are to find out about the world, we must ask questions,\" said White-paw.  8. So the two friends went about, stopping every now and then to admire or wonder at the new things they saw every moment.  9. Soon they came across a friendly-looking pig. \"Please, sir,\" asked the wee simple things, \"are you a mouse?\"  10. The pig looked down to them through his \"specs\" as he heard the question in the tiny little squeaking voice, and he grunted a little as he replied:  11. \"Yes, if you like to call me so,\" and the two friends went on.  12. In a little while they came up where the old cow was feeding; and White-paw, taking off his hat, said, \"Please, are you a mouse?\"  13. The old cow was too busy to answer such questions, but she shook her head in such a way that the travelers were glad to get off safe.  14. \"There are great friendly mice, and great unfriendly mice, in the world!\" said White-paw, as they went on their way.  15. Next they met a motherly old hen, who was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28077"],["title","Friends in Feathers and Fur, and Other Neighbors: For Young Folks (#6)"],["body","in scratching up food for her chickens; and White-paw asked, \"Please, ma'am, are you a mouse?\" \"We don't mind what folks call us,\" said the old hen, giving them a friendly wink.  16. As they went on they learned a great many things about the world; but as yet White-paw had not heard one word about a mouse-trap.  17. Having gone around the farm-yard, White-paw and his friend went through the gate toward the house. Here they met the dog, and asked the same question that they had asked before.  18. But the dog barked and snapped so that they could not make him hear, and they ran away in terror.     LESSON XXVIII.  _WHAT WHITE-PAW SAW IN THE KITCHEN._  [Illustration]   1. In their haste the two friends bolted into the kitchen of the farm-house, where an old tabby-cat lay dozing before the fire. But when they came in she arose to meet them.  2. \"What a polite fat mouse!\" thought White-paw. \"Please, ma'am--\" But pussy's eyes were fixed upon him with a horrid glare, and he could not go on.  3. Alas! his poor little friend! There was a cry and a crunching of bones, and White-paw just escaped through a hole into the pantry.  4. When he had in part got over his fright, he smelled toasted cheese--something he had heard of but never tasted. He sniffed about, and soon saw it in a little round hole.  5. By this time he was very hungry, and he reached out for the dainty morsel; but there was a sudden click, and he turned back--but too late! His tail and one of his legs were caught by the cruel teeth of a trap.  6. He pulled with all his might, but could not get away. He heard a little squeak, and an old mouse came limping up with only three legs.  7. \"Pull hard, my son; better lose a leg and tail than your life. See! I was caught like you. How came you here?\" he asked.  8. \"I came to see the world, and 'tis a terrible place!\" As White-paw spoke, he pulled himself free, but left one paw and the point of his tail in the trap.  9. The two hopped off together, and, after some friendly advice from the old mouse, White-paw limped away to his home, and soon found himself by his mother's side, where he could have his wounds dressed, and rest in peace.     LESSON XXIX.  _WHITE-PAW'S ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT WORLD._  [Illustration]   1. \"My dear son, what is the world like?\" asked Mrs. Mouse, after she had hugged White-paw, and set his supper before him.  2. \"Oh, it's a grand place! There are great black mice, and great white ones, and great spotted ones, and great friendly mice with long noses, and great uncivil mice with horns.  3. \"Then there are queer mice with only two legs, and some terrible mice that make a great noise.\" At this moment, Gaffer Graybeard came in, and White-paw said, \"Sir, I've learned what a mouse-trap is.\" \"Ah! then,\" said the sage, \"you've not seen the world in vain.\"   _THREE BLIND MICE._  [Illustration]        Three blind mice! Three blind mice!       See how they run! See how they run!     They all ran after the farmer's wife;     She cut off their tails with a carving-knife.     Did you ever see such a thing in your life       As three blind mice?     LESSON XXX.  _THE DEATH OF POOR PUSS._       \"Here lies poor Puss!\"--     \"Who saw her die?\" asked Grandmother Mouse,     Just peeping forth from her hole of a house.     \"I,\" said Tommy Titmouse, \"I saw her die;     I think she was choked while eating a fly.\"      \"Who'll dig her grave?\" asked Granny again;     In her voice, strange to say, there was no tone of pain.     \"The honest old dormouse, out in the wood,     He'd dig a good grave, if any one could.\"      \"Who'll be the bearers?\" The grandchildren all     Were ready at once, at sound of the call.     \"We'll carry Puss, since she can't carry us,     And bury her deep, without any fuss.\"      One seized her fore paw, another her tail,     Another her ear, to make sure not to fail.     Then off they all ran, for Puss winked her eye,     And sprang to her feet, as the mice squeaked \"Good-by.\"     [Illustration]  LESSON XXXI.  _FIELD-MICE._   1. Some kinds of mice live in the fields and woods, and never come into the house. The tiny little harvest-mouse has its home in the grain or thick grass, and feeds upon grain and insects.  2. It makes a nest of grass neatly woven together, and places it on the stalks, about a foot from the ground, where it is out of the way of the wet.  3. The nest is round, and about the size of a large orange. When the mother mouse goes away, she closes up the door of her nest, so no one can see her little ones.  4. The harvest-mouse runs up the corn and grass stalks easily. In climbing, it holds on by its tail as well as by its claws. The way it comes down from its nest is very curious. It twists its tail about the stalk and slides down.  5. Another of the field-mice is the dormouse, that lives in the woods. It has a bushy tail, and makes its nest in hollow trees. It lives upon nuts and fruit. As cold weather comes on, it rolls itself up in a ball, and sleeps until spring.  6. Once a dormouse was caught and kept in a cage, when it became quite tame, and a great pet with the children. One day it got out of its cage, and the children hunted all over the house, but could not find it, and gave it up as lost.  [Illustration]  7. The next day, as they sat down to dinner, a cold meat-pie was put upon the table. When it was cut open, there was the dormouse in the middle, curled up, and fast asleep.  8. The deer-mouse lives mostly in the fields, but it also makes its home in barns and houses. Its back and sides are of a slate color, but the under part of its body, and its legs and feet, are white. It is sometimes called the white-footed mouse, or wood-mouse. It builds a round nest in trees, that looks like a bird's nest, and it lives upon grain, seeds, and nuts.  9. This mouse seems fond of music, and once in a while one sings. Its song is very sweet, somewhat like that of a canary, but not so loud. Mr. Lockwood's singing mouse would keep up its wonderful little song ten minutes without stopping.     LESSON XXXII.  _HOW THE RAT LOOKS AND LIVES._  [Illustration]   1. The rat looks like a very large mouse. It has the same kind of chisel-teeth, sharp claws, and long tail, and it lives very much in the same way as a mouse.  2. It eats all kinds of food, and will live where most other animals would starve. Its teeth are strong, and it can gnaw its way into the hardest nuts, or through thick boards.  3. The claws of the rat are sharp, so that it can run up the side of a house, or up any steep place where its claws will take hold. When at the bottom of a barrel, or kettle of iron, brass, or tin, it can not climb out.  4. The hind feet of the rat are made in a curious way: they can turn round so that the claws point back. This enables a rat, when it runs down the side of a house, to turn its feet around and hold on, while it goes down head foremost.  5. The tail of the rat is made up of rings, and is covered with scales and very short hair. The rat uses it like a hand to hold himself up and to take hold of things.  6. Rats live in houses and barns, or wherever they can get enough to eat. In cities, they get into drains, and eat up many things which would be harmful if left to decay.  7. They are great pests in the house, running about in the walls, gnawing through the ceilings, and destroying food and clothing.  8. When rats get into a barn, they are very destructive. They eat up grain, and kill young chickens; and they often come in droves, when the pigs are fed, to share the food.  9. Rats increase very fast. Each mother rat produces fifty young ones in a year; and if we did not take great pains to destroy them, they would drive us out of our homes.     LESSON XXXIII.  _STORIES ABOUT THE RAT._  [Illustration]   1. Rats are very fond of eggs; but they do not like to be disturbed while eating, and so they contrive to carry the eggs to their nests, where they can enjoy their feast in safety.  2. In carrying off eggs, several rats will often go together. A rat will curl his tail around an egg, and roll it along. Coming to a staircase, they will hand the egg one to another so carefully as not to break it.  3. A lady once watched the rats, which were at work at her egg-basket. One rat lay down on his back, and took an egg in his arms. The other rats then seized him by the head, and dragged him off, egg and all.  4. Rats can easily be tamed, and even a dog can scarcely love its master better than a rat does when it is treated kindly. Mr. Wood tells this story of some tame rats:  5. \"Some young friends of mine have a couple of rats which they have tamed. One, quite white, with pink eyes, is called 'Snow,' and the other, which is white, with a brown head and breast, is named 'Brownie.'  6. \"The rats know their names as well as any dog could do, and answer to them quite as readily.  7. \"They are not kept shut up in a cage, but are as free to run about the house as if they were dogs or cats.  8. \"They have been taught a great number of pretty tricks. They play with their young master and mistress, and run about with them in the garden.  9. \"They sit on the table at meal-times, and take anything that is offered to them, holding the food in their fore paws and nibbling it; but never stealing from the plates.  10. \"They are very fond of butter, and they will allow themselves to be hung up by the hind feet and lick a piece of butter from a plate, or a finger.  11. \"Sometimes these rats play a funny game. They are placed on the hat-stand in the hall, or put into a hat and left there until their owners go up-stairs.  12. \"They wait until they are called, when they scramble down to the floor, gallop across the hall and up the stairs as fast as they can go.  13. \"They then hunt until they find their master, climb to his shoulder, and search every pocket for a piece of bread and butter, which they know is there for them.  14. \"They are very clean in their ways, and they are always washing their faces and"]]]
