For identifying the tree-top flitters an opera glass is scarcely powerful enough.  A field glass or a Bausch & Lomb binocular is really a necessity.  It draws the bird right down to you, while at the same time the elusive creature remains at what it regards a safe distance.  Its conduct will therefore not be constrained, and the observer can study it in its natural poses.  What an enigma the Tennessee warbler for a long time remained to me! Never still for a moment, yet so indistinctly marked that at a distance it looks like a dozen other birds one might name--a veritable feathered rebus.  But finally I fixed its place in the avian schedule with the help of my field glass--white under parts, slightly tinged with yellow, back and rump olive green, top and sides of head delicate bluish-ash; no eye-ring, no wing-bars.  There is no other warbler marked quite like that.  And yet its song is its most conspicuous mark, so to speak, for it is a loud, shrill, and very rapidly repeated run, which might be spelled out in this way: \"Chippy, chippy, chippy, chippity-chippity-chippity.\" The whole song is emitted at a galloping pace, giving you the impression that the bird is in a desperate hurry.  Important business on hand, no doubt!  Yes, there is a worm or a nit on the under side of that leaf, and he must nab it now or never!  With such pressing business matters on hand, he has no time for regaling you with \"linked sweetness long drawn out.\"  Still, he sometimes does prolong his ditty, giving it a saucy, challenging air.  No other warbler sings so loudly.  His voice is as shrill and penetrating as that of the indigo bird, though the song is quite different in technique.  [Illustration: Yellow Warbler]  Another feathered conundrum was the Nashville warbler, whose back and head are colored like those of the Tennessee, but whose under parts are bright yellow, instead of white or white only slightly washed with yellow; and, besides, sharp peering through your glass will reveal a distinct white ring encircling the eye.  The bird in the hand would also show a dainty chestnut patch on the crown, but this mark is seldom seen while it is flitting about in the leafy trees.  The songs of the Nashville and the Tennessee are somewhat similar, but not the same, the Tennessee's being louder, shriller, and more sharply accentuated, while his cousin's is more liquid and musical and far less sibilant.  My notes represent the Nashville's song phonetically as follows: \"Swee, swee, swee, ah-wit-ah-wit-ah-wit,\" delivered rapidly in a high key and with not a little energy and emphasis.  When my notes were made the little lyrist was putting his best foot forward, and was not high in the trees, so that I heard him distinctly.  The Tennessee warblers were also singing near at hand, giving me a good opportunity to compare the arias of the two species.  Belonging to the same subfamily is the orange-crowned warbler.  It has not so marked a preference for trees as its little relatives just mentioned, but likes, so far as my observation goes, to flit about in thickets, where it remains in hiding until driven from its covert or drawn forth by curiosity.  Only for a moment does it appear in sight, then plunges into another covert.  You will note that its eye-ring is yellow, and that its under parts are neither bright yellow, like the Nashville's, nor white, like the Tennessee's, but greenish yellow obscurely streaked on the chest.  I have never heard the song of the orange-crown.  There are a number of shy warblers that are especially partial to wild, unfrequented parts of the woods, where they are seldom disturbed by human intruders.  In Kansas I found them in the deep, densely wooded ravines running back from the Missouri River and its tributary valleys.  Although these feathered recluses are rarely molested by man, they seem to know enough about his character to look upon him with a suspicious eye when he ventures into their sylvan domain.  Hence they are hard to study, and it is not often that their deftly hidden nests can be found.  One of the most delightful of these hermits is the Kentucky warbler.  A brilliant little bird he is, with his golden under parts and superciliary line, his black patch on the cheek just below the eye, his black cap, and his coat of iridescent olive green.  You will not mistake him for the Maryland yellow-throat, which also wears a black patch on the side of his head; but this patch lies over the eye and includes it, and its upper border is white, while this bird lacks the yellow and curved superciliary band.  Besides, the yellow-throat is not a woodland but a marsh bird. The Kentucky warbler is attractive in many ways.  An industrious minstrel, his voice is strong and full for so small a bird, and until you learn to know his tune well, you may mistake it for that of the cardinal. But, as a piper, he lacks the versatility of the cardinal, who carries a number of music sheets in his repertory, while the little Kentuckian confines his lyrical efforts principally to one strain.  Sometimes he delivers his intermittent aria from a low bush or even from the ground, but his favorite song-perches are the branches of saplings and trees just below the zone of foliage.  Here, in the shadows, you may be compelled to look for him for some time before you espy his trig little form, and even then you are likely to see him because he flits to another perch rather than because you first catch the glint of his colors.  Whether he means it or not, he is something of a ventriloquist, for which reason you will often look for him in many places before seeing him.  As I have noted, he is an untiring singer.  It never occurred to me to time him, but Dr. Frank M. Chapman has had the patience to do so.  \"On one occasion,\" says this observer, \"at Englewood, New Jersey, I watched a male for three hours.  During this period, with the exception of five interruptions of less than forty-five seconds each, he sang with the greatest regularity once every twelve seconds.  Thus, allowing for the brief intervals of silence, he sang about 875 times, or some 5,250 notes. I found him singing, and when I departed he showed no signs of ceasing.\" It is such painstaking observations that add something new and fresh to our knowledge of birds.  The Kentucky warbler is fond of walking about on the ground in the woods, seeking for his favorite insects.  As you slowly follow, you will now and then catch a glimpse of him through the apertures of the leaves; then he will again disappear beneath his canvas of green.  Thus he pursues his quest hour after hour, and you may hear the rustle of his tiny feet upon the carpet of dead leaves.  Is it only a notion of mine, or am I correct, in thinking that his promenades on the ground are mostly taken early in the spring before there is danger from snakes?  I like the pretty Kentuckians, but must grant you that in some respects they are quite exasperating, never inclined to be as confiding as some other birds.  And then most birds will sooner or later betray the presence of their nests, but the Kentucky warblers seldom do so, knowing too well how to keep their procreant secrets.  They have evidently learned the use of strategy, as you will see: One day a pair began to chirp vigorously as I approached their demesne in a lonely hollow, and I felt a thrill of joy at the prospect of finding a nest.  One of them even flitted about with a worm in its bill--a sure sign of nestlings in the neighborhood.  For nearly four hours I watched the chirping couple, and peered, as I thought, into every nook and cranny of the place, but all in vain; neither nest nor bantlings could I find.  Yet in some way that seemed almost mysterious enough to be uncanny, the mother bird got rid of the tidbit which she held in her bill.  She probably decided to eat it herself rather than betray the whereabouts of her younglings.  I have seen more than one parent bird do that.  A few days later, in the same hollow, a Kentucky warbler was singing contentedly, showing no signs of uneasiness.  The female was not to be seen or heard.  I stalked about a long time, hoping to flush her from her nest, but all my efforts were as futile that day as they had been on my previous visit.  In another hollow, on the same day, I watched a Kentucky warbler flitting about with a worm in her bill.  Again and again she disappeared somewhere in the tanglewood, and came back with an empty bill to chirp her disapproval of my spying; but look as I would in the very places where she went down, I could discover no nest.  In Warbledom it is evidently no violation of ethical principles to act a lie in order to protect a nestful of bantlings.  But my story is not to have a disappointing ending, after all, for in the spring and summer of 1902 my stars became auspicious, and I found three Kentucky warblers' nests that were tenanted and several more that were already deserted.  Perhaps the turning of my luck was due not so much to accident as to the fact that I had \"caught on,\" and knew more about their ruses.  One of the nests discovered is worth describing.  It was on a hilltop in Kansas, blown by the freshest breezes that sweep over the limitless prairies.  An ideal spot, indeed, for the nesting of birds that love lone places.  In one of my rambles I found this pleasant elevation, and was attracted by the possibilities it offered for bird study.  Presently a male Kentucky warbler appeared with a couple of large worms in his beak, and I made up my mind to find his nest if perseverance could accomplish that object.  So I sat down in the shade of a tree and watched the bird closely.  Now note his admirable finesse.  After flitting about among the bushes for a minute or two, chirping his protest at my presence, he descended into the copse below and disappeared.  Of course, any student of birds would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],["title","Our Bird Comrades (#5)"],["body","supposed that he had gone down near the nest to feed his bairns, and that he only needed to go and examine the place to discover the little avian secret.  My pulses thrilled more than a little as I began my search for the nest right where the bird had descended into the thicket.  But do you know that my most strenuous efforts--and they _were_ strenuous on a hot day like that--resulted only in disappointment?  The nest was not to be found within a radius of a rod from the point where the little diplomat went down.  A few days later I made my way to the hilltop, and do you know that the shrewd bird played me the same trick?  He scuttled down into the bushes at almost the same point as before, and no nest rewarded my search.  I went home just about ready to give up my search for Kentucky warblers' nests, for I had been hunting them for a number of years without success.  However, in a few days I found my way again to the breezy hilltop.  The chats, vireos, and indigo birds gave due warning of my approach, and I felt sure that Master Kentucky and his mate would be on their guard.  To my delight, in a few minutes the female presented herself in one of the trees, her bill holding a bunch of worms.  Luckily she was not so wary or diplomatic as her husband, and, in addition, she extremely anxious to feed her hungry babies.  Instead of going over to the copse where the male bird had played me such a clever trick, she flew down the path about four rods to a small scrub oak, from which she soon dropped into the weeds below.  Then I said to myself; \"Aha!\" and smiled in a knowing way.  I walked down the path to the tree, but no Kentucky warblers were to be seen--not right away.  So I sat down in the path and waited to see what would happen.  It was only a short time till the female appeared, with a telltale bunch of worms in her beak.  A moment later her mate also arrived, carrying a small worm in the usual way.  The situation was growing interesting.  The two birdlets chirped and flitted about in the tree for a long time, afraid to go down to the nest.  I moved slowly and cautiously farther up the path to give them a better chance to divulge their secret.  Presently the pretty madame summoned courage to drop to a lower perch in the tree, then to a still lower one, then to the top of one of the bushes below, and at last into the weed clump and out of sight.  I wasted no time.  In a minute I was pressing the weeds apart and looking down admiringly into the little cot with its four half-fledged occupants--the first Kentucky warbler's nest I had ever seen.  Set upon the ground, its bulky foundation of dry leaves supported the cup proper, which was lined with fine grass.  Easy enough to find when you knew precisely where to look for it.  Think now of the little game the male bird had played me on my previous visits to the haunt!  He had descended into the copse about four rods distant from the nest instead of going down near its site; then he had doubtless followed a secret pathway through the weeds and bushes to the nest, fed his children, and hurried away without letting himself be seen.  The parent birds did not like the idea of my finding and inspecting their nest, for they chirped and darted about in a panic.  To relieve their anguish I retired up the slope a short distance, seated myself in the pleasant shade of a scrub oak, and made an entry of my find in my notebook.  Alas!  I had probably done harm to my little friends without intending it, for their chirping attracted the attention of one of their worst foes, and drew him to the spot.  I loitered about for perhaps ten minutes, and then decided to take one more peep at the pretty domicile before leaving the hilltop.  As I drew near, I observed that the parent birds were chirping in a low, but heart-broken way, as if they were almost stricken dumb with terror.  Were they so badly frightened because I was returning to their nest?  I stepped up cautiously and looked down at the nest.  It was now my turn to give vent to a cry of consternation, for what I saw was this: A large blacksnake coiled about the nest, the fold of his neck wabbling to and fro in a terrifying way, while with his mouth he was trying to seize one of the bantlings.  Fortunately I had a good-sized stick, almost a club, in my hand, and I wasted no time in bringing it down with all the force I could command upon the serpent, taking care to deliver the blow at the side of the nest.  The snake tried to uncoil, but another blow broke his backbone, if indeed the first one had not done so, and he was in my power.  He had swallowed one of the nestlings, but three were left, and seemed to be in good condition.  On my return to the place a few days later the nest was empty, and I fear that the remaining little ones had also been destroyed, perhaps by the mate of the snake from which I had rescued them.  On the shelf of a steep bluff covered with a riot of bushes and briars a pair of hooded warblers found a dwelling place to their taste in the spring of 1900.  This handsome birdlet may be known by his dainty yellow hood, bordered with black, and cannot be mistaken for any other member of the great feathered fraternity.  One cannot look at him without feeling that Nature tried to see what she could do in the way of an unusual arrangement of colors.  Who can tell what impelled her to make a living gem like this, as odd as it is beautiful?  On the side of the bluff referred to I was first attracted by the vivacious song of the little male, which I had not heard for several years--not since an excursion I had taken into Louisiana and Mississippi. His voice was clear and ringing, and the tune he executed was by no means a meager performance.  One day a loud, metallic chirping was heard, and presently two hooded warblers appeared, each with the proverbial green worm in its beak.  I decided to remain in the nook and watch, for the nesting habits of these rare warblers were new to me.  In and out, up and down, here and there, they flitted, making a checker-work of black and gold amid the foliage, craning their necks, peering at me with anxious inquiry in their dark little eyes, and filling the woodland with their uneasy chirping.  It was a long time to wait, but at length patience had its reward; one of the birds flew down to the bushes on the steep slope above me and fed a youngster in plain view.  No time was lost in pushing through the bushy tangle to the magic spot.  Behold! it was a young cowbird that had been fed by the devoted little mother!  That was trying beyond expression--to think that all the efforts of the pretty couple, all their intense solicitude, was wasted on a great, hulking impostor like the cowbird.  He had just scrambled from the nest, from which he had doubtless previously crowded the rightful heirs of the family to perish from starvation on the ground.  I found the nest only about a foot away from the perch of the young bird--a deep, neat little basket, compactly felted with down and plant fibers, set in the crotch of a slender bush of the thicket.  It was certainly too small to accommodate any tenants besides the strapping young cowbird.  In the spring of 1902 another hooded warbler's nest rewarded my search.  Its holdings were four callow bantlings, all of which were carried off by some marauder before my next visit.  Another little charmer of the woodland, especially of thick second-growth timber, is the blue-winged warbler, which glories in the high-sounding Latin name of _Helminthophila pinus_.  Wherever seen, he would attract attention on account of the peculiar cut and color of his clothes.  A conspicuous black line reaching from the corner of the mouth back through the eye is a diagnostic feature of his plumage, while his crown and breast gleam in bright yellow, almost golden in the sunshine; his wings and tail are blue-gray, with some white trimmings, and his back and rump are bright olive  There you have an array of colors that makes a picture indeed.  Madame Blue-wing wears the same pattern as her lord, but the hues are less brilliant.  The manners of Sir Blue-wing--I call him so because of his distinguished air--are interesting, for they differ, in one respect at least, from those of most of the other warblers of my acquaintance.  He flits about among the branches in rather a leisurely way--for a warbler; but his main characteristic is his unwarbler-like fashion of clinging back downward to the under side of the twigs, after the manner of the chickadee, in order to secure the nits and worms under the leaves.  He acts decidedly like a diminutive trapeze performer.  His song consists of an insect-like buzz, divided into stanzas of two syllables each, with a pensive strain running through it, as if the heart of the little singer were filled with sadness.  While it sounds rather faint at a distance, close at hand it has a strangely penetrating quality.  Although my numerous efforts to find a blue-wing's nest were unavailing, I had the satisfaction of proving beyond doubt that these birds breed in northeastern Kansas.  A quaint, squeaking call attracted my attention one day, and I found that it proceeded from the throat of a young blue-wing perched in the bushes, for presently the mamma came and thrust a morsel into the open mouth of the bantling.  Some young birds sit quietly and patiently, waiting for their rations, and utter only a faint twitter when they are fed; but the youthful blue-wings are not of so contented and silent a disposition.  On the contrary, they are noisy little fellows, making their presence known to friend and foe alike, although they are very careful never to permit the human observer to come too close.  They are duly warned of danger by their ever-vigilant parents.  Sometimes a youngster will sit on the same perch for a long time, preening his feathers and uttering a little call at intervals, just to keep in practice, as it were; while at other times he will"]]]
