Two opportunities of recovering the lost solidarity of the Europeans were presented before the republican Dutch had set themselves definitely to work for the supremacy of South Africa through reunion with their colonial kinsfolk. That both were lost was due at bottom to the disgust of the British people at the excessive cost and burden of establishing a civilised administration over the native population in South Africa. But in both cases the immediate agency of disaster was the refusal of the Home Government to listen to the advice of its local representative. Sir George Grey would have regained the lost solidarity of the Europeans by taking advantage of the natural recoil manifested among the Free State Dutch from independence and responsibility towards the more settled and prosperous life assured by British rule. His proposal was to unite the Cape Colony, Natal, and the Free State in a federal legislature, consisting of representatives chosen by popular vote in the several states. In urging this measure he took occasion to combat the pessimistic views of South African affairs which were prevalent in England. The country was not commercially useless, but of \"great and increasing value.\" Its people did not desire Kafir wars, but were well aware of the much greater advantages which they derived from the peaceful pursuits of industry. The colonists were themselves willing to contribute to the defence of that part of the Queen's dominions in which they lived. And, finally, the condition of the natives was not hopeless, for the missionaries were producing most beneficial effects upon the tribes of the interior. But the most powerful argument which Grey used was his ruthless exposure of the futility of the Conventions. By allowing the Boer emigrants to grow into independent communities the British Government believed that not only had they relieved themselves of responsibility for the republican Dutch, but that they had secured, in addition, the unfaltering allegiance of the larger Dutch population which remained behind in the Cape Colony. Grey assured the Home Government that in both respects it was the victim of a delusion bred of its complete ignorance of South African conditions. The Boer Republics would give trouble. Apart from the bad draftsmanship of the conventions--a fertile source of disagreement--these small states would be centres of intrigue and \"internal commotions,\" while at the same time their revenues would be too small to provide efficiently for their protection against the warlike tribes. The policy of _divide et impera_--or, as Grey called it, the \"dismemberment\" policy--would fail, since the political barrier which had been erected was wholly artificial.           [Footnote 4: Cetewayo.]       \"Although these European countries are treated as separate      nations,\" he wrote, \"their inhabitants bear the same family names      as the inhabitants of this Colony, and maintain with them ties of      the closest intimacy and relationship. They speak generally the      same language--not English, but Dutch. They are for the most part      of the same religion, belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church.      They have the same laws--the Roman Dutch. They have the same      sympathies, the same prejudices, the same habits, and frequently      the same feelings regarding the native races....       \"I think that there can be no doubt that, in any great public, or      popular, or national question or movement, the mere fact of      calling these people different nations would not make them so,      nor would the fact of a mere fordable stream running between them      sever their sympathies or prevent them from acting in unison....      Many questions might arise in which, if the Government on the      south side of the Orange River took a different view from that on      the north side of the river, it might be very doubtful which of      the two Governments the great mass of the people would obey.\"[5]           [Footnote 5: Despatch of November 19th, 1858, to Sir E. B.          Lytton.]  The \"divergence of opinion\" between Capetown and Downing Street was complete. Grey was charged with \"direct disobedience\" for listening to the offers of the Free State inhabitants. Recalled by a despatch of June 4th, 1859, he was reinstated in August on condition that \"he felt himself sufficiently free and uncompromised,\" both with the Cape Legislature and the people of the Free State, to be able personally to carry out the policy of the Home Government, which, said the despatch,       \"is entirely opposed to those measures, tending to the resumption      of sovereignty over that State, of which you have publicly      expressed your approval in your speech to the Cape Parliament,      and in your answers to the address from the State in question.\"  Nor was that all. In his endeavours to establish a simple but effective system of European magistrates over the Kafirs beyond the eastern border of the Colony, he was hampered by the short-sighted economy of the Home Government. It seems incredible that a Colonial Governor, even at that epoch, should have been looked upon by Downing Street as a sort of importunate mendicant. But Grey's language shows that this was the attitude against which he had to defend himself.  [Sidenote: The burden of the empire.]       \"I would now only urge upon Her Majesty's Government,\" he writes      on September 8th, 1858, \"that they should not distress me more      than is absolutely necessary for the government and control of      the people of the country which lies beyond the Colony of the      Cape of Good Hope. Stripping the country as I am of troops [to      serve in putting down the Indian Mutiny], some great disaster      will take place if necessary funds are at the same time cut off      from me. I am sure, if the enormous reductions I have effected in      military expenditure are considered, the most rigid economists      will feel that the money paid by Great Britain for the control of      this country has been advantageously laid out.\"  These extracts are not pleasant reading. They were written at the time when the Imperial spirit was at its nadir. In the plain language of the Secretary of State for the Colonies[6] in 1858, it was a time when ministers were \"compelled to recognise as fact the increased and increasing dislike of Parliament to the maintenance of large military establishments in our colonies at Imperial cost.\" Yet one more passage must be cited, not so much because it is tinged by a certain grim humour--although this is a valuable quality in such a context--as because it affords an eminently pertinent illustration in support of the contention that the refusal of the Home Government to follow the advice of the \"man on the spot\" has been the operative cause of the failure of British administration in South Africa. The reply to the charge of \"direct disobedience,\" which Grey formulates in one leisurely sentence, runs as follows:           [Footnote 6: Sir E. B. Lytton.]       \"With regard to any necessity which might exist for my removal on      the ground of not holding the same views upon essential points of      policy as Her Majesty's Government hold, I can only make the      general remark that, during the five years which have elapsed      since I was appointed to my present office, there have been at      least seven Secretaries of State for the Colonial Department,      each of whom held different views upon some important points of      policy connected with this country.\"  [Sidenote: The discovery of diamonds.]  Grey was not by any means the only Governor of the Cape to show the home authorities how impossible it was to govern South Africa from Downing Street, and to urge upon them the necessity of allowing their representative, the one man who was familiar with local conditions, to decide by what methods the objects of British policy could be most effectively advanced. But it was not until some considerable time after the Colonial Department had been placed under a separate Secretary of State, and the Colonial Office had been constituted on its present basis, with a staff of permanent officials, that these protests produced any appreciable effect. What really aroused an interest in South Africa--that is to say a practical interest, as distinct from the interest created by the stories of missionary enterprise and travel, and by the records of Kafir warfare--was the discovery of diamonds in Griqualand West in 1870, and the subsequent establishment of the diamond industry at Kimberley. It was the first time that anything certain had occurred to show that the vast \"hinterland\" of the Cape might prove to be a territory of industrial possibilities. The earnings of the diamond mines provided the Cape Colony with a revenue sufficient to enable it to link together its main towns by a tolerable railway system. The industry, once established, attracted British capital and British population, and by so doing it did what Blue-books and missionary reports had failed to do: it brought the every-day life of the British Colonist in South Africa within the purview of the nation. Thanks to the Kimberley mines the Cape ceased to be thought of as a country whose resources were exclusively pastoral and agricultural.  The epoch of the next great divergence of opinion was a more hopeful time from an Imperialist point of view. Lord Beaconsfield, who was the first statesman to give practical expression to the belief that the maintenance of empire was not inconsistent with the welfare of the masses of the home population, was in power. British statesmen, and the class from which British statesmen are drawn, had begun to study Colonial questions in a more hopeful and intelligent spirit. Something had been learnt, too, of the actual conditions of South Africa. And yet it was at this epoch "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],["title","Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#4)"],["body","what was, perhaps, the most ruinous of all the divergences of opinion between Capetown and Downing Street occurred.  [Sidenote: Sir Bartle Frere.]  When Sir Bartle Frere was sent out to South Africa to carry out a definite scheme for the union of the Republics with the British colonies in a federal system, British statesmen and the educated classes in general had adopted the views expressed by Grey twenty years before. Tardily they had learnt to recognise both the essential unity of the Dutch population and the value of the country as an industrial asset of the empire. But, in the meantime, the centre of political power had shifted in England. The extension of the franchise had placed the ultimate control of British policy in South Africa in the hands of a class of electors who were, as yet, wholly uneducated in the political and economic conditions of that country. The divergence of opinion between the home and the local authority became in this case wider than ever. In short, it was the will of the nation that caused Frere to be arrested midway in the accomplishment of his task, and gave a mandate in 1880 to the Liberal party to administer South Africa upon the lines of a policy shaped in contemptuous indifference of the profoundest convictions and most solemn warnings of a great proconsul and most loyal servant of the Crown.  The facts of Frere's supersession and recall are notorious: the story is too recent to need telling at length. We know now that, apart from the actual discovery of the Witwatersrand gold-mines, all that he foresaw and foretold has been realised in the events which culminated, twenty years later, in the great South African War. The military power which at that time (1877-80) stood in the way of South African unity under the British flag was the Zulu people. The whole adult male population of the tribe had been trained for war, and organised by Ketshwayo into a fighting machine. With this formidable military instrument at his command Ketshwayo proposed to emulate the sanguinary career of conquest pursued by his grandfather Tshaka;[7] and he had prepared the way for the half-subdued military Bantu throughout South Africa to co-operate with him in a general revolt against the growing supremacy of the white man. Frere removed this obstacle. But in doing so he, or rather the general entrusted with the command of the military operations, lost a British regiment at Isandlhwana. This revelation of the strength of the Zulu army was, in fact, a complete confirmation of the correctness of Frere's diagnosis of the South African situation. His contention was that England must give evidence of both her capacity and her intention to control the native population of South Africa before she could reasonably ask the republican Dutch to surrender their independence and reunite with the British colonies in a federal system under the British flag. A native power, organised solely for aggressive warfare against one of two possible white neighbours, constituted therefore, in his opinion, not only a perpetual menace to the safety of Natal, but an insuperable obstacle to the effective discharge of a duty by the paramount Power, the successful performance of which was a condition precedent to the reunion of the European communities. The only point in dispute was the question whether the powers of Ketshwayo's _impis_ had been exaggerated. To this question the disaster of Isandlhwana returned an emphatic \"No.\"           [Footnote 7: Chaka.]  [Sidenote: The recall of Frere.]  The divergence of opinion between Frere and Lord Beaconsfield's cabinet was trivial as compared with the profound gulf which separated his policy from the South African policy of Mr. Gladstone. After the return of the Liberal party to power in the spring of 1880, Frere was allowed to remain in office until August 1st, when he was recalled by a telegraphic despatch. But, as Lord Kimberley pointed out to him, there had been \"so much divergence\" between his views and those of the Home Government that he would not have been allowed to remain at the Cape, \"had it not been for the special reason that there was a prospect of his being able materially to forward the policy of confederation.\" This prospect, of course, had then been removed by the failure of the Cape Government, on June 29th, to bring about the conference of delegates from the several States, which was the initial step towards the realisation of Lord Carnarvon's scheme of federal union.  The vindication of Frere's statesmanship has been carried, by the inexorable logic of events, far beyond the sphere of Blue-book arguments. But it is impossible to read this smug despatch without recalling the words which Mr. Krüger wrote to Mr. (now Lord) Courtney on June 26th of the same year: \"The fall of Sir Bartle Frere will ... be useful.... We have done our duty and used all legitimate influence to cause the conference proposals to fail.\" That is to say, it was known to these faithful confederates of that section of the Liberal party of which Mr. Courtney was the head, that the Gladstone Government had determined to recall Sir Bartle Frere three days before \"the special reason\" for maintaining him at the Cape had disappeared.  [Sidenote: Frere's forecast.]  But what we are really concerned with is the nature of the opinions upon the central question of South African administration which Frere put forward at this critical period. With these before us, the most elementary acquaintance with the events of the last ten years will suffice to indicate the profound degree in which his knowledge of South African conditions surpassed the knowledge of those who took upon themselves to reverse his policy. What, above all, Frere realised was, that a point had been reached at which the whole of South Africa must be gathered under the British flag without delay. He had noted the disintegrating influences at work in the Cape Colony and the strength of the potential antagonism of the republican Dutch. The annexation of the Transvaal was not his deed, nor did either the time or the manner in which it was done command his approval. But he asserted that British rule, once established there, must be maintained at all costs. With this end in view, he urged that every responsibility incurred by England in the act of annexation must be fulfilled to the letter. Utilising the information which he had gained by personal observation during his visit to the Transvaal in 1879, and availing himself of the co-operation of President Brand, of the Free State, and Chief Justice de Villiers, in the Cape Colony, he drafted a scheme of administrative reform sufficient to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Boers for self-government without endangering the permanency of British rule. It included proposals for administrative and financial reforms framed with a view of reducing the cost of government to the lowest point consistent with efficiency, for the reorganisation of the courts of law, for the survey of the proposed railway line to Delagoa Bay, and full details of a system of representative government. This measure he urged upon the Colonial Office as one of immediate necessity, since it embodied the fulfilment of the definite promises of an early grant of self-government made to the Boers at the time of annexation.[8]           [Footnote 8: The receipt of the despatch in which these          valuable recommendations were made was not even acknowledged          by the Colonial Office. Frere himself gives the outlines of          his proposals in an article published in _The Nineteenth          Century_ for February, 1881.]  He recognised the value of Delagoa Bay as an essential factor in the political and commercial system of a united South Africa, and he earnestly recommended its acquisition by purchase from the Portuguese Government. His perception of the extreme importance of satisfying all legitimate claims of the Boers, and his acute realisation of the danger of allowing the Transvaal to become a \"jumping-off ground\" either for foreign powers or Afrikander Nationalists, are exhibited in due relationship in a private memorandum which he wrote from the Cape at the end of July, 1879:       \"Any reliance on mere force in the Transvaal must react      dangerously down here in the old colony, and convert the Dutch      Country party, now as loyal and prosperous a section of the      population as any under the Crown, into dangerous allies of the      small anti-English Republican party, who are for separation, thus      paralysing the efforts of the loyal English party now in power,      who aim at making the country a self-defending integral portion      of the British Empire. Further, any attempt to give back or      restore the Boer Republic in the Transvaal must lead to anarchy      and failure, and probably, at no distant period, to a vicious      imitation of some South American Republics, in which the more      uneducated and misguided Boers, dominated and led by better      educated foreign adventurers--Germans, Hollanders, Irish Home      Rulers, and other European Republicans and Socialists--will      become a pest to the whole of South Africa, and a most dangerous      fulcrum to any European Power bent on contesting our naval      supremacy, or injuring us in our colonies.       \"There is no escaping from the responsibility which has already      been incurred, ever since the British flag was planted on the      Castle here. All our real difficulties have arisen, and still      arise, from attempting to evade or shift this responsibility....      If you abdicate the sovereign position, the abdication has always      to be heavily paid for in both blood and treasure.... Your object      is not conquest, but simply supremacy up to Delagoa Bay. This      will have to be asserted some day, and the assertion will not      become easier by delay. The trial of strength will be forced on      you, and neither"]]]
