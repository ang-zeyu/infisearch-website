Mason; Paymaster Thomas Richmond Ware; Passed Assistant Surgeon Frederick Garretson; Acting Master Lewis Parrish; Chief Engineer Hugh Clark; Lieutenant of Marines Richard T. Henderson; Midshipmen John Tyler Walker, Alexander McComb Mason, and M.P. Goodwyn.  The vessel, being properly equipped, so far as the limited resources at hand could be used, proceeded down James river and took a position off Mulberry Island, on which point rested the right of the Army of the Peninsula, under Magruder. The time passed wearily and drearily enough whilst the _Patrick Henry_ lay at anchor off Mulberry Island. The officers and crew very rarely went on shore, the steamer being kept always with banked fires, prepared to repel an attack, which might have been made at any moment, the Federal batteries at Newport News and the vessels stationed there, the frigate _Savannah_, sloop _Cumberland_, and steamer _Louisiana_, being about fourteen miles distant.  To relieve the monotony of the irksome duty on which the _Patrick Henry_ was employed, Tucker determined to take her down the river, feel of the enemy, and warn him of what might be expected if boat expeditions should attempt to ascend the river. On the afternoon of Friday, September 13th, 1861, the _Patrick Henry_ weighed her anchor at Mulberry Island, and steamed down James river towards Newport News. Choosing her distance from that point, she opened fire upon the Federal squadron, which was promptly returned, principally by the _Savannah_, _Louisiana_, and a battery of light artillery, which had been moved up the left bank of the river. After giving the crew a good exercise at their guns, the _Patrick Henry_ was steamed back to her anchorage off Mulberry Island.  About the last of November, Tucker received information that one or two of the Federal gunboats came up the river every night and anchored about a mile and a half above their squadron at Newport News. Hoping to be able to surprise and capture these boats, the commander of the _Patrick Henry_ got her underway at 4 o'clock A.M. on December 2d, 1861. The morning was dark and suitable for the enterprise, and all lights on board the _Patrick Henry_ were either extinguished or carefully concealed. No vessel of the enemy was met with in the river, but at daylight four steamers were discovered, lying at anchor near the frigate _Congress_ and sloop _Cumberland_, off the batteries of Newport News. As the _Patrick Henry_ could not have returned unseen, Tucker took a position about a mile distant from the batteries, and opened on the Federal vessels with his port battery and pivot guns. The fire was promptly returned, many of the shots from the rifled guns passing over the _Patrick Henry_, and one, going through her pilot-house and lodging in the starboard hammock-netting, did some injury to the vessel, besides wounding slightly one of the pilots and a seaman by the splinters it caused. The skirmish, if such a term can be applied to a naval operation, lasted about two hours, during which time the _Patrick Henry_ fired twenty-eight shells and thirteen solid shots, but with what effect on the enemy is not known. From this best kind of drill practice, the Confederate steamer returned to her anchorage off Mulberry Island, continued her guard of the river, and waited for some opportunity for more active employment.  In February, 1862, the ladies of Charles City, a county bordering on James river, desired to present to the _Patrick Henry_ a flag which they had made for her as an evidence of their appreciation of her services in keeping boat expeditions and the enemy's small steamers from ascending the river. But the presentation of this flag did not take place; the C.S. steamers _Jamestown_, 2, and _Teaser_, v, had reinforced the _Patrick Henry_, and such incessant preparations were going on that no time could be spared for the ceremony. The occasion of these preparations was the expectation of being soon engaged in the attack which it was understood that the Confederate iron-clad _Virginia_ was about to make on the Federal batteries and men-of-war at Newport News. No care or preparation could make the _Patrick Henry_ as well fitted for war as a vessel of the same size built especially for the military marine service; but the best that could be done to make her efficient was done, and not without success, as the part the vessel took in the closely following battle of Hampton Roads conclusively demonstrates.  On the 7th of March, 1862, the James river squadron, consisting of the _Patrick Henry_, 12, Commander J.R. Tucker; _Jamestown_, 2, Lieutenant Commanding J.N. Barney, and _Teaser_, 1, Lieutenant Commanding W.A. Webb, proceeded down the river, and anchored at nightfall off Day's Neck Point, some six miles distant from Newport News. This movement was effected in order to be near at hand when the _Virginia_ made her expected attack on the Federal forces.  The 8th of March, 1862, was a bright, placid, beautiful day--more like a May than a March day. About 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the _Virginia_ came steaming out from behind Craney Island, attended by the gunboats _Beaufort_ and _Raleigh_. As soon as the _Virginia_ was seen, the James river squadron got underway under all the steam the boilers would bear, and proceeded to join her in her attack on the enemy. As Tucker's small squadron approached the Newport News batteries he formed it in line ahead, the _Patrick Henry_, 12, leading; next the _Jamestown_, 2, and lastly the _Teaser_, 1; this order being maintained until the batteries were passed. The batteries were run with less loss than was anticipated; the enemy probably expected the Confederate vessels to pass in the usual channel, about eight hundred yards from the guns of the Federal works, but by Tucker's directions the _Patrick Henry_ was run by much nearer the batteries, and the _Jamestown_ and _Teaser_ followed her closely. Probably in consequence of this deviation from the middle of the channel the Federal guns were not well aimed, and most of the shot from the batteries passed over the Confederate vessels. As the James river squadron ranged up abreast of the first battery, the vessels delivered their fire, and the flash from their guns had scarcely vanished when the Federal works were wrapped in smoke, and their projectiles came hissing through the air. The _Patrick Henry_ was struck several times during the passage; one shot passing through the crew of No. 3 gun, wounding two men and killing one, a volunteer from the army, who had come on board to serve only for the fight. His last words as he fell were, \"Never mind me, boys!\"  Whilst the James river squadron was passing the batteries, the _Virginia_ had rammed and sunk the _Cumberland_, a ship which was fought most gallantly to the bitter end, going down with her colors flying and her guns firing, like the celebrated French ship _Vengeur_.  Having run by the batteries with no material damage, the James river squadron joined the _Virginia_ and afforded her valuable aid in the battle she was waging. Whilst the forward guns of the _Patrick Henry_ were engaging one enemy, the after guns were firing at another, and the situation of the Confederate wooden vessels at this time seemed well nigh desperate. The Newport News batteries were on one side, on the other the frigates _Minnesota_, _St. Lawrence_ and _Roanoke_ were coming up from Old Point Comfort, and in front the beach was lined with field batteries and sharpshooters. Fortunately for the wooden vessels, both Confederate and Federal, the _Minnesota_, _St. Lawrence_ and _Roanoke_ grounded, and the smaller vessels which accompanied them returned to Old Point Comfort. The _Minnesota_, though aground, was near enough to take part in the action, and opened a heavy fire on the Confederate squadron.  The frigate _Congress_, early in the action, had been run aground, with a white flag flying. Tucker, as soon as he saw that the _Congress_ had shown a white flag, gave orders that no shot should be fired at her from the _Patrick Henry_, and he steadily refused to let any gun be aimed at her, notwithstanding that the Confederate gunboats _Raleigh_, _Teaser_ and _Beaufort_ had attempted to take possession of the surrendered vessel, and had been driven off by a heavy artillery and infantry fire from the Federal troops on the beach. After the Confederate gunboats had been forced to retire from the _Congress_, Flag-Officer Buchanan hailed the _Patrick Henry_ and directed Commander Tucker to burn that frigate. The pilots of the _Patrick Henry_ declared they could not take her alongside of the _Congress_ on account of an intervening shoal, which determined Tucker to approach as near as the shoal would permit and then send his boats to burn the Federal frigate. The boats were prepared for the service, and the boats' crews and officers held ready whilst the _Patrick Henry_ steamed in towards the _Congress_.  This movement of the _Patrick Henry_ placed her in the most imminent peril; she was brought under the continuous and concentrated fire of three points; on her port quarters were the batteries of Newport News, on her port bow the field batteries and sharpshooters on the beach, and on her starboard bow the _Minnesota_. It soon became evident that no wooden vessel could long float under such a fire; several shots struck the hull, and a piece of the walking-beam was shot away. As the sponge of the after pivot gun was being inserted in the muzzle of the piece, the handle was cut in two by a shot from the enemy; half in prayer and half in despair at being unable to perform his duty, the sponger exclaimed, \"Oh, Lord! how is the gun to be sponged?\" He was much relieved when the quarter-gunner of his division handed him a spare sponge. This state of things could not last"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27101"],["title","Life of Rear Admiral John Randolph Tucker (#4)"],["body","ng; a shot from a rifled gun of one of the field batteries on the beach penetrated the steam-chest, the engine-room and fire-room were filled with steam, four of the firemen were scalded to death and several others severely injured; the engineers and firemen were driven up on deck, and the engines stopped working: the vessel was enveloped in a cloud of escaped steam, and the enemy, seeing that some disaster to the boiler had occurred, increased his fire. At the moment, until the chief engineer made his report, no one on the spar-deck knew exactly what had happened, the general impression being that the boilers had exploded. It is an unmistakable evidence of the courage and discipline of the crew that the fire from the _Patrick Henry_ did not slacken, but went on as regularly as if nothing unusual had occurred. As the vessel was drifting towards the enemy in her disabled condition, the jib was hoisted to pay her head around, and the _Jamestown_, Lieutenant Commanding Barney, gallantly and promptly came to her assistance and towed her out of action.  The engineers soon got one boiler in working order. The other was so badly damaged that they were unable to repair it for immediate use, and with steam on one boiler alone the _Patrick Henry_ was again taken into action. The closing in of night put an end to the conflict, as in the dark it was impossible to distinguish friend from foe. The victory remained without dispute with the Confederate squadron, and was witnessed, as was the combat between the _Virginia_ and the _Monitor_ on the day following, by multitudes of spectators from Norfolk and the neighboring camps of the Confederate troops, as well as by many on the Federal side of the Roads.  It has been stated that the total Federal loss in this battle was nearly four hundred. The numerical strength of the Confederate force engaged was about six hundred, of which the total loss was about sixty. The loss on board the _Patrick Henry_ being five killed and nine wounded.  The part taken by the _Patrick Henry_ in this battle--it was a battle and not a combat--seems to have been lost sight of in consequence of the great power, as a new force in naval warfare, displayed by the _Virginia_, but the Federal commanders bear witness to the efficient service done by the Confederate wooden vessels. Lieutenant Commanding Pendergrast, of the _Congress_, reported that \"the _Patrick Henry_ and _Thomas Jefferson_ (_Jamestown_), rebel steamers, approached us from up the James river, firing with precision and doing us great damage,\" and Captain Van Brunt, of the _Minnesota_, reported that the _Patrick Henry_ and _Jamestown_ \"took their positions on my port bow and stern and their fire did most damage in killing and wounding men, insomuch as they fired with rifled guns.\"  The closing in of night having put an end to hostilities until morning, the Confederate squadrons anchored under Sewell's Point, at the mouth of the harbor of Norfolk. The crews were kept busy until a late hour of the night, making such repairs and preparations as were necessary for resuming operations in the morning. Soon after midnight a column of fire ascended in the darkness, followed by a terrific explosion--the Federal frigate _Congress_, which had been on fire all the evening, had blown up, the fire having reached her magazine.  Flag Officer Buchanan, having been wounded in the action, was sent to the Naval Hospital at Norfolk on the morning of the 9th, just prior to the getting under way of the squadron. The command ought, in conformity with military and naval usage, to have been formally transferred to the next senior officer of the squadron, who was Commander J.R. Tucker, of the _Patrick Henry_; but this obviously proper course was not followed, and Flag Officer Buchanan's flag was kept flying on board the _Virginia_, though he himself, in point of fact, was not and could not be in command of that vessel, or the Confederate squadron, since he was not within signal distance of either, being laid up in bed at the Norfolk Naval Hospital. Tucker did not assume command of the squadron, but simply continued to command the _Patrick Henry_.  At the first peep of dawn, on the morning of the 9th of March, the Confederate squadron was under way, having in view for its first object the destruction of the _Minnesota_, that frigate being still aground near Newport News. As the daylight increased, the _Minnesota_ was discovered in her old position, but no longer alone and unsupported. Close alongside of her there lay such a craft as the eyes of a seaman does not delight to look upon; no masts, no smokestack, no guns--at least nothing of the sort could be seen about her. And yet the thing had a grim, pugnacious look, as if there was tremendous power of some sort inherent in her, and ready to be manifested whenever the occasion required it. The _Monitor_ (for it was that famous vessel) promptly steamed out to meet the _Virginia_, as the latter vessel bore down on the _Minnesota_, and the celebrated combat between these iron-clads was joined immediately. It was the first action that had ever been fought between armored vessels, and as such will ever be remembered and commented upon. The combat resulted in a drawn fight as far as the _Virginia_ and _Monitor_ was concerned, but it established the power of iron-clad steamers as engines of war, and completely revolutionized the construction of the navies of the world.  That the combat between the _Virginia_ and the _Monitor_ was an indecisive action is clear. The _Monitor_ received the most damage in the fight, and was the first to retire from it into shoal water, though the fight was afterwards renewed. On the other hand, the _Virginia_ did not accomplish her object, which was the destruction of the _Minnesota_, and she did not accomplish it in consequence of the resistance offered by the _Monitor_. The two vessels held each other in check, the _Virginia_ protecting Norfolk, and the _Monitor_ doing the same for the Federal wooden fleet in Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake waters. The injuries received by the _Virginia_ in ramming the _Cumberland_, on the previous day, were probably greater than those inflicted on her by the _Monitor_; in neither case were they severe enough to disable or force her to withdraw from action.  On her return to Norfolk harbor, the _Virginia_ was accompanied by the _Patrick Henry_ and the other vessels of the Confederate squadron. The Confederate wooden steamers had taken no part in the action between the _Virginia_ and the _Monitor_, except to fire an occasional shot at the _Monitor_, as she passed, at very long range; no wooden vessel could have floated a quarter of an hour in an engagement at close quarters with either of the two iron-clads.  Flag Officer Tatnall having relieved Flag Officer Buchanan, who was incapacitated from command on account of severe wounds received in the first day's fight in Hampton Roads, and all the vessels of the squadron having been refitted, on the 13th of April the squadron again sallied out to attack the enemy. It was expected that the _Monitor_ would be eager to renew the combat with the _Virginia_, and it was agreed upon that, in case the _Virginia_ failed to capture or destroy the Federal iron-clad, an attempt should be made to carry the latter by boarding. This duty was assigned to the gunboats _Beaufort_ and _Raleigh_ and two other small steamers. One of these small steamers was the tender of the Norfolk Navy Yard; she was manned for the occasion by officers and men from the _Patrick Henry_, under the command of the executive-officer of that vessel, and was christened by the men _Patrick Henry, Junior_.  The Confederate squadron steamed about in Hampton Roads for two days, but the _Monitor_ did not leave her anchorage at Fortress Monroe, her passiveness being due, it seems, to orders from Washington not to engage the _Virginia_ unless she attempted to pass Old Point Comfort.  General J. Bankhead Magruder, commanding the Confederate Army of the Peninsula, was urgent in demanding the return of the James river squadron, and consequently the _Patrick Henry_ and _Jamestown_ were ordered to run by the Newport News batteries at night, and resume their old duty in James river. The _Jamestown_ ran up the river on the 19th and the _Patrick Henry_ on the 20th of April; the _Beaufort_, _Raleigh_ and _Teaser_ were also sent up the river; the headquarters of this detached squadron, of which Tucker was the senior officer, was at Mulberry Island, on which point rested the right flank of the Confederate Army of the Peninsula.  Up to this time the _Patrick Henry_ was brigantine rigged, but to fit her better for running by batteries without being discovered, both of her masts were now taken out and short signal poles substituted for them.  When the Confederate authorities determined upon the evacuation of Norfolk, the James river squadron was employed to remove what public property could be saved from the Navy Yard to Richmond. The hulls of several uncompleted vessels were towed past the Federal batteries at Newport News. The running past the batteries was always done at night, moonless nights being chosen whenever it was practicable to select the time of making the trip. So far as known, the vessels employed on this service were never detected by the enemy; at least they were never fired upon.  Soon after the evacuation of Norfolk, whilst the Confederate forces were retiring from the Peninsula to the lines around Richmond, a Federal squadron, consisting of the _Monitor_, _Galena_, _Naugatuck_, _Aroostook_ and _Port Royal_, entered James river. The _Monitor_ alone could with ease and without serious injury to herself have destroyed in fight all the Confederate vessels in James river, and no course was open to Tucker but to take his squadron up the river and make a stand at the place below Richmond best adapted for defense. The place most wisely selected was Drewry's Bluff,"]]]
