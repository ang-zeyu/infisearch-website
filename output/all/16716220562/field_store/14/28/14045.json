MAKING NEW FRIENDS  A friend once told me of a letter he had received from a correspondent who is an enthusiastic botanist.  The writer, having just returned from an excursion in which he found a flower that was new to him, gave vent to his feelings of exultation by exclaiming, \"Oh, the joy! the joy!\"  A like experience comes to the bird lover when he makes a new acquaintance in the feathered domain, no matter how many other observers may have seen and studied the species.  \"A bird that is new to _me_ is to all intents and purposes a new bird,\" is his self-complacent mode of reasoning, though it may not be distinguished for its logic.  [Illustration: Chipping Sparrow]  After studying the birds in Ohio and Indiana for a good many years, I moved to eastern Kansas, where I lived for five and a half years.  My rambles were by no means confined to the wooded bluffs and hollows that bound the Missouri River on the west, for I also made excursions out upon the prairies of Kansas, over into the state of Missouri, and down into Oklahoma; and everywhere I carried my field glass with me and kept both eyes intent on the birds.  You would expect an enthusiast in the pursuit of bird lore to do nothing else.  What a pleasure it was to ramble about in new fields and make acquaintance with new bird friends! There is not a very marked difference between the avifauna of eastern Kansas and Ohio, and yet there are some birds found in the former state that are not met with in the latter--enough to keep the observer on the tiptoe of expectancy for several months.  One of my new acquaintances was a little bird which is known as the clay-colored sparrow.  It belongs to the same genus (_Spizella_) as the chipping and field sparrows which are so well known in the East; but it has an individuality of its own, and is not merely a copy.  I stumbled upon it while pursuing my explorations near Peabody, far out on the level prairie, where the species was abundant during the season of migration.  As I was sauntering along a road, a peculiar croaking little trill greeted me from the hedge, sounding very much like the rasping call of certain kinds of grasshoppers when they are suddenly startled and take to wing.  But no insect had ever emitted quite such a sound in my hearing.  This could not be an insect.  It was worth while to look and make sure of the identity of the odd musician.  After some difficulty, I fixed my glass upon a number of little sparrows about the size of the chippies.  They bore a close resemblance to that species too, save that the crown-piece and the general tone of the back were decidedly darker, while the under parts were a good deal whiter.  The clear, ash-colored cervical interval between the crown and the back and the distinct brown loral and auricular space told me plainly who the little charmers were.  Not at the moment, however, for the birds were new to me, and I had to wait until I could consult my manual before I was able to decide that they were the clay-colored sparrows.  Their song is an odd vocal performance--a low, croaking trill, preceded by a few longer notes, all delivered in the same key.  It is, in fact, a contralto solo divided into brief stanzas, and easily might be mistaken for the grating buzz of an insect, especially if heard at a distance of a few rods.  It possesses little or no musical quality, and is perhaps the most curious style of bird minstrelsy with which I am acquainted.  In comparison the chippie's trill sounds loud and clear and bell-like, with a distinctly melodious quality of tone.  The song of the little clay-colored sparrow is also marked by a kind of drawl, giving one the impression that the bird is just a little too lazy to exert himself; yet when you get him in the field of your glass and see him throw back his head, expand his throat and chest, and open his mandibles as wide as he can, you quickly decide that he is not the apathetic creature his desultory song would lead you to infer.  It really is laughable, and almost pathetic, too, to note how much energy he expends in the production of his poor little aria.  Indeed, not in the least sluggish is the blood flowing in the veins of _Spizella pallida_, for he is a vivacious little body, flitting about actively in the hedges and bushes, and sometimes mounting into the trees, chanting his little alto strain all the while, as if his life depended upon it.  He is one of the comparatively few birds who is lavish of his song in migration.  Unlike the familiar chippie, he does not usually find a perch in plain sight, from which to rehearse his song, but keeps himself well hidden in the bushes or trees, darting into a hiding place as soon as he thinks himself discovered.  The shy little imp prefers to put a screen of foliage or twigs between himself and the observer.  Might his motto be, \"Little birds should be heard and not seen\"?  I had quite a time making sure of him, but, as a pleasant compensation, when his identity was once settled, I could not well have mistaken him for another species, for he is a bird of real distinction.  My study of the clay-colored sparrows was restricted to their habits in migration, at which time they move about in more or less compact little flocks, gathering seeds and chanting their monotonous trills.  While I first found these sparrows near Peabody, they were also fairly common, a few days later, in northeastern Kansas, about a mile back from the Missouri River, where their low alto strains formed a kind of gray background for the high-pitched trills of the Harris sparrows and the loud pipings of the cardinals.  Quaint as our little contralto's solos are, they have a distinct fascination for me, and now that I no longer live in the Sunflower state, I miss them sorely when the springtime comes.  These sparrows do not, I believe, breed in Kansas, but are known to establish their households in the northern part of Illinois, central and northern Iowa, the Red River region in Minnesota, the country drained by the upper Missouri River and its tributaries, Manitoba as far north as the Saskatchewan River, and the plains and bases of the foothills of eastern Colorado.  Their nests are built on the ground or in low bushes, and from three to five eggs, of a greenish-blue tint, flecked with cinnamon-brown, are deposited.  They spend the winters in southern Texas and still farther south.  Only \"accidentally,\" as the word goes, are they known in the eastern part of the United States, and for that reason little has yet been written about them in popular books on birds.  The time will come, no doubt, when they will have a well-recognized place in bird literature, just as the chippie, the vesper sparrow, and the song sparrow have to-day.  In bird study it is never safe to take too much for granted.  One must be constantly on the alert, and, more than that, one must be able to make fine distinctions with both the ear and the eye.  Here is a case in point.  For many days, while strolling about in quest of bird lore, I heard a quaint little song in the bushy clumps, and that, too, in some of the most out-of-the-way places.  \"It is nothing but the house wren,\" I muttered to myself, I know not how often.  \"It isn't worth while to look for it when there are new birds to be found.  Still, it's singular,\" I continued, \"that the house wren should dwell in such secluded places.  It would seem that his name is a misnomer--at least, in a good many instances.\" Several times I stopped to listen more intently to the rolling ditty.  \"There's something odd about that wren's song,\" I repeated.  \"Does the house wren always close its song with the rising inflection, as if it were asking a question?\"  Then I would perhaps make a half-hearted attempt to get a glimpse of the lyrist, but it kept itself well hidden in the bushes, and I desisted, begrudging the time taken from my quest for feathered rarities.  But one day, while strolling along the banks of a small stream, I again heard the labored ditty, and the next moment a small bird darted into full view, calling and scolding in an agitated way, and, while I watched it capering about, it broke into the very song to which for several weeks I had been listening so carelessly.  Why, it was not a wren after all!  It did not look like a wren, nor act like one, but, rather, its form and conduct were like those of a vireo; and a vireo it was.  My bird manual soon settled that point.  And what was the name of the little stranger who had introduced himself in so informal a way?  It was the Bell vireo, an entirely new species to me.  It is not an eastern species; it ranges from Illinois to the base of the Rocky Mountains.  In Kansas it is a summer resident, hanging its little basket of a nest on the twigs of bushes or low trees, after the regular vireo fashion.  It was my good fortune to find a nest on a copsy hilltop, where the bird's madrigals and lullabies mingled with those of the yellow-breasted chats, the indigo buntings, the blue-gray gnat catchers, and the Kentucky warblers.  To this day I feel a longing to visit the secluded spot where I held so many pleasant interviews with these birds.  Another Kansas bird that was new to my eyes and that afforded me much delight was the Harris sparrow--a distinctively western species, not known, or at least very rarely, east of the Mississippi River.  He is truly a fine bird, a little larger than the fox sparrow, neatly clad, his breast prettily decorated with a brooch of black spots held in place by a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],["title","Our Bird Comrades (#3)"],["body"," necklace of the same color, while his throat and forehead are bordered with black.  His rump and upper tail coverts are a delicate shade of grayish brown, by which he may be readily distinguished from the fox sparrow, whose rear parts are reddish brown. His beak, feet, and legs are of a pinkish tint, making him look quite trig and dressy.  The latest of the spring arrivals were the most highly colored, having the whole chin, throat, and top of the head a glossy, uniform black.  It would appear that the most matured individuals migrate farthest south in winter.  That, at least, would be the natural conclusion, judging from the fact that they arrive latest in the spring in our central latitudes.  In the southern part of Kansas the Harris sparrows are said to be common winter sojourners, but in the north-eastern part of the state they disappeared in November or December, and did not return until the middle of February, or later if the weather happened to be severe.  From the time of their vernal arrival they were to be seen in every ramble until they took flight for their breeding haunts in the North.  One spring some of them were still loitering in Kansas on the eleventh of May, and were singing blithely, no doubt waiting for the winter cold of their summer homes to be well past before they ventured farther toward the arctic lands.  In general, the habits of these birds are much like those of the white-throated sparrows, which are much more common in the East than in the West.  The Harris sparrows are fond of copses and hedges, and especially of brush heaps in new grounds.  So marked, indeed, is their penchant for brush heaps that I almost wish one might re-christen them \"brush-heap sparrows.\"  Many a time I have played a little trick on the unsuspecting birds by stealing up to a brush pile and giving it a sudden blow with my cane; then a whole covey of them would dash pellmell from their covert with loud chirps of protest against such wantonness.  Sometimes they are found in the depths of the woods, providing there is thick underbrush in which they can conceal themselves.  I seldom found them in open places either in the woods or fields.  Yet, shy as they are, they have a fondness for the dense hedges along the highways, flitting and chirping as the traveler passes by.  Being wary birds, they do not wander far from their hiding places, into which they precipitate themselves at the approach of a supposed danger. It was quite a while before I could get a clear view of their breasts, for, with provoking persistence, they kept their tails turned toward me.  However, when once you really become acquainted with a bird, it seems to lose part of its shyness, and so after a time I often had the Harris sparrows in plain view.  One of their characteristic habits was to stand at full height on the top of a brush heap, with tail lifted, crest feathers erect, and eyes wide open, the picture of wild alertness.  In such poses they are indeed handsome birds.  It was March 5, 1898, when I heard the first song of this sparrow, and even then it was only a fragment of a song.  But, the weather remaining pleasant, the sixteenth of the month brought a fine concert.  The bird's song was a surprise to me.  It began with a prolonged run so much like the opening tremolo of the white-throated sparrow that it might have led the most expert ornithologist astray.  The fact is, I looked around for quite a while in search of a white-throat, thinking him still a little out of tune, and therefore unable to finish his chanson; and I was undeceived only by the singing of several Harris sparrows that with unusual boldness had perched in plain sight.  The resemblance ceased, however, with the opening notes, for the western bird did not add the sweet, rhythmic triad of his white-throated cousin, the closing part of his song being only a somewhat labored trill of no distinct character, and not fulfilling the promise of his initial strain.  In the concerts of these birds--and frequently many of them would be trilling at the same time--they sang in several different keys, some of them striking the treble and others dropping almost to the alto. Occasionally two birds in different parts of a field would sing responsively, one trill running very high in the scale, the other an octave lower.  It seemed almost as if the responsive exercise was engaged in intentionally.  The Harris sparrow has another song which is quite unlike his melodious trill.  It is delivered in a loud voice of little musical quality, and the notes are pounded out in a percussive style, like the explosion in quick succession of a number of little cartridges.  Yet you must be quite close to the bird in order to hear the queer canticle distinctly, and when you do hear it you will wonder why nature ever put such a song into a bird's larynx.  The Harris sparrow also utters an explosive alarm-call, which expresses not a little petulance and concern.  One day a pretty picture was made by two of these birds that stood face to face on a brush heap, bowing at each other, each threatening to peck the other's head off, and both singing all the while at the top of their voices, yet each afraid, in spite of his bluster, to close with his opponent in actual contest.  It was a miniature exhibition of the beak-to-beak challenging often indulged in by two rival cocks of the farmyard.  For some minutes the little farce was kept up, then one of the birds became tired of the game and darted over to the next brush heap.  I have said that these birds are scarcely known east of the Mississippi River, but Mr. Ridgway says that they are occasionally seen during migration in Illinois and Wisconsin.  In eastern Kansas and western Missouri they are common, almost abundant, during both the vernal and autumnal migrations, and after you have once cultivated their acquaintance they are likable, if not quite companionable, birds.  But familiar as they are in the regions named, they are still something of a mystery to the naturalists of our country, for Mr. Ridgway says that their \"breeding range is unknown,\" save that there is a doubtful record of one nest at Fort Custer, Montana; while Mrs. Bailey says: \"The breeding range of the Harris sparrow is unknown except for Mr. Preble's Fort Churchill record.  The last of July, among the dwarf spruces of Fort Churchill, he found an adult male and female with young just from the nest.\"  It will be remembered that Fort Churchill is away up on the coast of the Hudson Bay.  It is probable, therefore, that the nest of the Harris sparrow has never been found by any of the naturalists of America.  Who would suppose that these birds, so numerous and so well known in Kansas, would, in the breeding season, surround themselves with such an air of mystery?  It was in Kansas, too, that I really came to know the Lincoln sparrow and hear his song, although I had caught a few fleeting glimpses of him in the East, and also in the neighborhood of Duluth, Minnesota.  In the Sunflower state his conduct was just about as inconsistent as it could have been without being downright absurd.  What do I mean by that? Why, while he was as wild as a deer, he still came to town, flitting about in the bushes of a vacant lot near my house, and even visiting the fence between my yard and the adjoining one, hopping about on the ground with one eye on the lookout for nits and worms and the other for human disturbers.  My attention was first drawn to him by hearing a squeaky little trill in the vacant lot.  But, my! how wary he was when I went out to find him!  The song bore some resemblance to that of the house wren, but had not so rolling and gurgling a quality, and was pitched to a slightly higher and finer key.  For a long time he kept himself ensconced in the thicket, trilling saucily at intervals, as if daring me to find him if I could, and when I finally drove him out of his hiding place, he darted off in a zigzag course to another bush clump, into which he dropped in the greatest possible haste.  By and by his curiosity got the better of him, and he flitted to the top of a brush heap and peeped out at me surreptitiously.  My glass was upon him in a moment, revealing his whitish throat and mottled chest washed with buff, the latter being his characteristic marking.  A few days later he was singing in a small apple tree by my neighbor's fence. I stole as close to him as I could and peered at him through my binocular, while he returned the compliment by peering at me, and then warily ventured to rehearse his little tune.  The least movement on my part would startle him, cause him to flit to another perch and crane out his neck to glare at me questioningly with wild, dilated eyes, uncertain whether I was to be trusted or not.  Both of us presently grew tired of our strained position, and so I walked off and he flew away.  No doubt there was mutual satisfaction in the inspection we gave each other; at least, I felt well satisfied with having heard the song of so shy a bird.  His stay in my neighborhood lasted only a few days; then he left as mysteriously as he had come, without even the courtesy of a good-bye.  He went to his summer home in the North, and I did not see him again until the next spring, just twelve months later almost to the day.
