WER.   Odd things happen to the soldier in winter quarters. He has nothing to   do then, so he amuses himself, and to pass the time he makes   acquaintances, which he only intends for the winter, but which the   good soul with whom he makes them, looks upon for life. Then, presto!   a ring is suddenly conjured on to his finger; he hardly knows himself   how it gets there; and very often he would willingly give the finger   with it, if he could only get free from it again.    FRAN.   Oh! and do you think this has happened to the Major?    WER.   Undoubtedly. Especially in Saxony. If he had had ten fingers on each   hand, he might have had all twenty full of rings.    FRAN. (aside).   That sounds important, and deserves to be inquired into.   Mr. Freeholder, or Mr. Sergeant!!!!!    WER.   Little woman, if it makes no difference to you, I like \"Mr. Sergeant\"   best.    FRAN.   Well, Mr. Sergeant, I have a note from the Major to my mistress. I   will just carry it in, and be here again in a moment. Will you be so   good as to wait? I should like very much to have a little talk with   you.    WER.   Are you fond of talking, little woman? Well, with all my heart. Go   quickly. I am fond of talking too: I will wait.    FRAN.   Yes, please wait.   (Exit.)      SCENE VI.   Paul Werner    WER.   That is not at all a bad little woman. But I ought not to have   promised her that I would wait, for it would be most to the purpose, I   suppose, to find the Major. He will not have my money, but rather   pawns his property. That is just his way. A little trick occurs to me.   When I was in the town, a fortnight back, I paid a visit to Captain   Marloff's widow. The poor woman was ill, and was lamenting that her   husband had died in debt to the Major for four hundred thalers, which   she did not know how to pay. I went to see her again to-day; I   intended to tell her that I could lend her five hundred thalers, when   I had received the money for my property; for I must put some of it   by, if I do not go to Persia. But she was gone; and no doubt she has   not been able to pay the Major. Yes, I'll do that; and the sooner the   better. The little woman must not take it ill of me; I cannot wait.   (Is going in thought, and almost runs against the Major, who meets   him.)      SCENE VII.   Major Von Tellheim, Paul Werner    MAJ. T.   Why so thoughtful, Werner?    WER.   Oh! that is you. I was just going to pay you a visit in your new   quarters, Major.    MAJ. T.   To fill my ears with curses against the Landlord of my old one. Do not   remind me of it.    WER.   I should have done that by the way: yes. But more particularly, I wish   to thank you for having been so good as to take care of my hundred   louis d'ors. Just has given them to me again. I should have been very   glad if you would have kept them longer for me. But you have got into   new quarters, which neither you nor I know much about. Who knows what   sort of place it is? They might be stolen, and you would have to make   them good to me; there would be no help for it. So I cannot ask you to   take them again.    MAJ. T. (smiling).   When did you begin to be so careful, Werner?    WER.   One learns to be so. One cannot now be careful enough of one's money.   I have also a commission for you, Major, from Frau Marloff; I have   just come from her. Her husband died four hundred thalers in your   debt; she sends you a hundred ducats here, in part payment. She will   forward you the rest next week. I believe I am the cause that she has   not sent you the whole sum. For she also owed me about eighty thalers,   and she thought I was come to dun her for them--which, perhaps, was   the fact--so she gave them me out of the roll which she had put aside   for you. You can spare your hundred thalers for a week longer, better   than I can spare my few groschens. There, take it!   (Hands him the ducats.)    MAJ. T.   Werner!    WER.   Well! Why do you stare at me so? Take it, Major!    MAJ. T.   Werner!    WER.   What is the matter with you? What annoys you?    MAJ. T. (angrily striking his forehead, and stamping with his foot.)   That... the four hundred thalers are not all there.    WER.   Come! Major, did not you understand me?    MAJ. T.   It is just because I did understand you! Alas, that the best men   should to-day distress me most!    WER.   What do you say?    MAJ. T.   This only applies partly to you. Go, Werner!   (Pushing back Werner's hand with the money in it.)    WER.   As soon as I have got rid of this.    MAJ. T.   Werner, suppose I tell you that Frau Marloff was here herself early   this morning!!!!!    WER.   Indeed?    MAJ. T.   That she owes me nothing now!!!!!    WER.   Really?    MAJ. T.   That she has paid me every penny--What will you say then?    WER. (thinks for a minute).   I shall say that I have told a lie, and that lying is a low thing,   because one may be caught at it.    MAJ. T.   And you will be ashamed of yourself?    WER.   And what of him who compels me to lie? Should not he be ashamed too?   Look ye, Major; if I was to say that your conduct has not vexed me, I   should tell another lie, and I won't lie any more.    MAJ. T.   Do not be annoyed, Werner. I know your heart, and your affection for   me. But I do not require your money.    WER.   Not require it! Rather sell, rather pawn, and get talked about!    MAJ. T.   Oh! people may know that I have nothing more. One must not wish to   appear richer than one is.    WER.   But why poorer? A man has something as long as his friend has.    MAJ. T.   It is not proper that I should be your debtor.    WER.   Not proper! On that summer day which the sun and the enemy made hot   for us, when your groom, who had your canteen, was not to be found,   and you came to me and said--\"Werner, have you nothing to drink?\" and   I gave you my flask, you took it and drank, did you not? Was that   proper? Upon my life, a mouthful of dirty water at that time was often   worth more than such filth   (taking the purse also out of his pocket, and holding out both to   him).   Take them, dear Major! Fancy it is water. God has made this, too, for   all.    MAJ. T.   You torment me: don't you hear, I will not be your debtor.    WER.   At first, it was not proper; now, you will not. Ah! that is a   different thing.   (Rather angrily.)   You will not be my debtor? But suppose you are already, Major? Or, are   you not a debtor to the man who once warded off the blow that was   meant to split your head; and, at another time, knocked off the arm   which was just going to pull and send a ball through your breast? How   can you become a greater debtor to that man? Or, is my neck of less   consequence than my money? If that is a noble way of thinking, by my   soul it is a very silly one too.    MAJ. T.   To whom do you say that, Werner? We are alone, and therefore I may   speak; if a third person heard us, it might sound like boasting. I   acknowledge with pleasure, that I have to thank you for twice saving   my life. Do you not think, friend, that if an opportunity occurred I   would have done as much for you, eh?    WER.   If an opportunity occurred! Who doubts it, Major? Have I not seen you   risk your life a hundred times for the lowest soldier, when he was in   danger?    MAJ. T.   Well!    WER.   But!!!!!    MAJ. T.   Why cannot you understand me? I say, it is not proper that I should be   your debtor; I will not be your debtor. That is, not in the   circumstances in which I now am.    WER.   Oh! so you would wait till better times. You will borrow money from me   another time, when you do not want any: when you have some yourself,   and I perhaps none.    MAJ. T.   A man ought not to borrow, when he has not the means of repaying.    WER.   A man like yourself cannot always be in want.    MAJ. T.   You know the world... Least of all should a man borrow from one who   wants his money himself.    WER.   Oh! yes; I am such a one! Pray, what do I want it for? When they want   a sergeant, they give him enough to live on.    MAJ. T.   You want it, to become something more than a sergeant--to be able to   get forward in that path in which even the most deserving, without   money, may remain behind.    WER.   To become something more than a sergeant! I do not think of that. I am   a good sergeant; I might easily make a bad captain, and certainly a   worse general.    MAJ. T.   Do not force me to think ill of you, Werner! I was very sorry to hear   what Just has told me. You have sold your farm, and wish to rove about   again. Do not let me suppose that you do not love the profession of   arms so much as the wild dissolute way of living which is   unfortunately connected with it. A man should be a soldier for his own   country, or from love of the cause for which he fights. To serve   without any purpose--to-day here, to-morrow there--is only travelling   about like a butcher's apprentice, nothing more.    WER.   Well, then, Major, I will do as you say. You know better what is   right. I will remain with you. But, dear Major, do take my money in   the meantime. Sooner or later your affairs must be settled. You will   get money in plenty then; and then you shall repay me with interest. I   only do it for the sake of the interest.    MAJ. T.   Do not talk of it.    WER.   Upon my life, I only do it for the sake of the interest. Many a time I   have thought to myself--\"Werner, what will become of you in your old   age? when you are crippled? when you will have nothing in the world?   when you will be obliged to go and beg!\" And then I thought again--   \"No, you will not be obliged to beg: you will go to Major Tellheim; he   will share his last penny with you; he will feed you till you die; and   with him you can die like an honest fellow.\"    MAJ. T. (taking Werner's hand).   And, comrade, you do not think so still?    WER.   No, I "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2663"],["title","Minna Von Barnhelm (#8)"],["body","not think so any longer. He who will not take anything from   me, when he is in want, and I have to give, will not give me anything   when he has to give, and I am in want. So be it.   (Is going.)    MAJ. T.   Man, do not drive me mad! Where are you going?   (Detains him.)   If I assure you now, upon my honour, that I still have money--If I   assure you, upon my honour, that I will tell you when I have no more--   that you shall be the first and only person from whom I will borrow   anything--will that content you?    WER.   I suppose it must. Give me your hand on it, Major.    MAJ. T.   There, Paul! And now enough of that, I came here to speak with a   certain young woman.      SCENE VIII.   Franziska (coming out of Minna's room), Major von Tellheim, Paul Werner    FRAN. (entering).   Are you there still, Mr. Sergeant?   (Seeing Tellheim.)   And you there too, Major? I will be at your service instantly.   (Goes back quickly into the room.)      SCENE IX.   Major von Tellheim, Paul Werner    MAJ. T.   That was she! But it seems you know her, Werner.    WER.   Yes, I know her.    MAJ. T.   Yet, if I remember rightly, when I was in Thuringia you were not with   me.    WER.   No; I was seeing after the uniforms in Leipsic.    MAJ. T.   Where did you make her acquaintance, then?    WER.   Our acquaintance is very young. Not a day old. But young friendship is   warm.    MAJ. T.   Have you seen her mistress, too?    WER.   Is her mistress a young lady? She told me you are acquainted with her   mistress.    MAJ. T.   Did not you hear? She comes from Thuringia.    WER.   Is the lady young?    MAJ. T.   Yes.    WER.   Pretty?    MAJ. T.   Very pretty.    WER.   Rich?    MAJ. T.   Very rich.    WER.   Is the mistress as fond of you as the maid is? That would be capital!    MAJ. T.   What do you mean?      SCENE X.   Franziska (with a letter in her hand), Major von Tellheim, Paul Werner    FRAN.   Major!!!!!    MAJ. T.   Franziska, I have not yet been able to give you a \"Welcome\" here.    FRAN.   In thought, I am sure that you have done it. I know you are friendly   to me; so am I to you. But it is not at all kind to vex those who are   friendly to you so much.    WER. (aside).   Ah! now I see it. It is so!    MAJ. T.   My destiny, Franziska! Did you give her the letter?    FRAN.   Yes; and here I bring you...   (holding out a letter).    MAJ. T.   An answer!    FRAN.   No, your own letter again.    MAJ. T.   What! She will not read it!    FRAN.   She would have liked, but--we can't read writing well.    MAJ. T.   You are joking!    FRAN.   And we think that writing was not invented for those who can converse   with their lips whenever they please.    MAJ. T.   What an excuse! She must read it. It contains my justification--all   the grounds and reasons!!!!!    FRAN.   My mistress wishes to hear them all from you yourself, not to read   them.    MAJ. T.   Hear them from me myself! That every look, every word of hers, may   embarrass me; that I may feel in every glance the greatness of my   loss.    FRAN.   Without any pity! Take it.   (Giving him his letter.)   She expects you at three o'clock. She wishes to drive out and see the   town; you must accompany her.    MAJ. T.   Accompany her!    FRAN.   And what will you give me to let you drive out by yourselves? I shall   remain at home.    MAJ. T.   By ourselves!    FRAN.   In a nice close carriage.    MAJ. T.   Impossible!    FRAN.   Yes, yes, in the carriage, Major. You will have to submit quietly; you   cannot escape there! And that is the reason. In short, you will come,   Major, and punctually at three.... Well, you wanted to speak to me   too alone. What have you to say to me? Oh! we are not alone.   (Looking at Werner.)    MAJ. T.   Yes, Franziska; as good as alone. But as your mistress has not read my   letter, I have nothing now to say to you.    FRAN.   As good as alone! Then you have no secrets from the Sergeant?    MAJ. T.   No, none.    FRAN.   And yet I think you should have some from him.    MAJ. T.   Why so?    WER.   How so, little woman?    FRAN.   Particularly secrets of a certain kind.... All twenty, Mr.   Sergeant!   (Holding up both her hands, with open fingers.)    WER.   Hist! hist! girl.    MAJ. T.   What is the meaning of that?    FRAN.   Presto! conjured on to his finger, Mr. Sergeant   (as if she was putting a ring on her fingers).    MAJ. T.   What are you talking about?    WER.   Little woman, little woman, don't you understand a joke?    MAJ. T.   Werner, you have not forgotten, I hope, what I have often told you;   that one should not jest beyond a certain point with a young woman!    WER.   Upon my life I may have forgotten it! Little woman, I beg!!!!!    FRAN.   Well, if it was a joke, I will forgive you this once.    MAJ. T.   Well, if I must come, Franziska, just see that your mistress reads my   letter beforehand? That will spare me the pain of thinking again--of   talking again, of things which I would willingly forget. There, give   it to her!   (He turns the letter in giving it to her, and sees that it has been   opened.)   But do I see aright? Why it has been opened.    FRAN.   That may be.   (Looks at it.)   True, it is open. Who can have opened it? But really we have not read   it, Major; really not. And we do not wish to read it, because the   writer is coming himself. Come; and I tell you what, Major! don't come   as you are now--in boots, and with such a head. You are excusable, you   do not expect us. Come in shoes, and have your hair fresh dressed. You   look too soldierlike, too Prussian for me as you are.    MAJ. T.   Thank you, Franziska.    FRAN.   You look as if you had been bivouacking last night.    MAJ. T.   You may have guessed right.    FRAN.   We are going to dress, directly too, and then have dinner. We would   willingly ask you to dinner, but your presence might hinder our   eating; and observe, we are not so much in love that we have lost our   appetites.    MAJ. T.   I will go. Prepare her somewhat, Franziska, beforehand, that I may not   become contemptible in her eyes, and in my own. Come, Werner, you   shall dine with me.    WER.   At the table d'hote here in the house? I could not eat a bit there.    MAJ. T.   With me, in my room.    WER.   I will follow you directly. One word first with the little woman.    MAJ. T.   I have no objection to that.   (Exit.)      SCENE XI.   Paul Werner, Franziska    FRAN.   Well, Mr. Sergeant!    WER.   Little woman, if I come again, shall I too come smartened up a bit?    FRAN.   Come as you please: my eyes will find no fault with you. But my ears   will have to be so much the more on their guard. Twenty fingers, all   full of rings. Ah! ah! Mr. Sergeant!    WER.   No, little woman; that is just what I wished to say to you. I only   rattled on a little. There is nothing in it. One ring is quite enough   for a man. Hundreds and hundreds of times I have heard the Major say--   \"He must be a rascally soldier, who can mislead a young girl.\" So   think I too, little woman. You may trust to that! I must be quick and   follow him. A good appetite to you.   (Exit.)    FRAN.   The same to you! I really believe, I like that man!   (Going in, she meets Minna coming out.)      SCENE XII.   Minna, Franziska    MIN.   Has the Major gone already, Franziska? I believe I should have been   sufficiently composed again now to have detained him here.    FRAN.   And I will make you still more composed.    MIN.   So much the better! His letter! oh! his letter! Each line spoke the   honourable noble man. Each refusal to accept my hand declared his love   for me. I suppose he noticed that we had read his letter. I don't mind   that, if he does but come. But are you sure he will come? There only   seems to me to be a little too much pride in his conduct. For not to   be willing to be indebted for his good fortune, even to the woman he   loves, is pride, unpardonable pride! If he shows me too much of this,   Franziska!!!!!    FRAN.   You will discard him!    MIN.   See there! Do you begin to pity him again already! No, silly girl, a   man is never discarded for a single fault. No; but I have thought of a   trick to pay him off a little for this pride, with pride of the same   kind.    FRAN.   Indeed, you must be very composed, my lady, if you are thinking of   tricks again.    MIN.   I am so; come. You will have a part to play in my plot.   (Exeunt.)     ACT IV.      SCENE I.   Minna's Room.     Minna (dressed handsomely and richly, but in good taste), Franziska     (They have just risen from a table, which a servant is clearing.)    FRAN.   You cannot possibly have eaten enough, my lady.    MIN.   Don't you think so, Franziska? Perhaps I had no appetite when I sat   down.    FRAN.   We had agreed not to mention him during dinner. We should have   resolved likewise, not to think of him.    MIN.   Indeed, I have thought of nothing but him.    FRAN.   So I perceived. I began to speak of a hundred different things, and   you made wrong answers to each.   (Another servant brings coffee.)   Here comes a beverage more suited to fancies--sweet, melancholy   coffee.    MIN.   Fancies! I have none. I am only thinking of the lesson I will give   him. Did you understand my plan, Franziska?    FRAN.   Oh! yes; but it would be better if he spared us the putting it in   execution.    MIN.   You will see that I know him thoroughly. He who refuses me now with   all my wealth, will contend for me against the whole world, as soon as   he hears that I am unfortunate and friendless.    FRAN. (seriously).   That must tickle the most refined self-love.    MIN.   You moralist! First you convict me of vanity--now of self-love. Let me   do as I please, Franziska. You, too, shall do as you please with your   Sergeant.    FRAN.   With my Sergeant?    MIN.   Yes. If you deny it altogether, then it is true. I have not seen him   yet; but from all you have said respecting him, I foretell your   husband for you.      SCENE"]]]
