X., “until I am dead, and possibly not then.”  “Let me see, what did he get--fifteen years!”  “Fifteen years,” repeated T. X., “and a very fortunate man to escape with his life.”  Sir George walked to the window and stared out on to busy Whitehall.  “I am told you are quite friendly with Kara again.”  T. X. made a noise which might be taken to indicate his assent to the statement.  “I suppose you know that gentleman has made a very heroic attempt to get you fired,” he said.  “I shouldn't wonder,” said T. X. “I made as heroic an attempt to get him hung, and one good turn deserves another. What did he do? See ministers and people?”  “He did,” said Sir George.  “He's a silly ass,” responded T. X.  “I can understand all that”--the Chief Commissioner turned round--“but what I cannot understand is your apology to him.”  “There are so many things you don't understand, Sir George,” said T. X. tartly, “that I despair of ever cataloguing them.”  “You are an insolent cub,” growled his Chief. “Come to lunch.”  “Where will you take me?” asked T. X. cautiously.  “To my club.”  “I'm sorry,” said the other, with elaborate politeness, “I have lunched once at your club. Need I say more?”  He smiled, as he worked after his Chief had gone, at the recollection of Kara's profound astonishment and the gratification he strove so desperately to disguise.  Kara was a vain man, immensely conscious of his good looks, conscious of his wealth. He had behaved most handsomely, for not only had he accepted the apology, but he left nothing undone to show his desire to create a good impression upon the man who had so grossly insulted him.  T. X. had accepted an invitation to stay a weekend at Kara's “little place in the country,” and had found there assembled everything that the heart could desire in the way of fellowship, eminent politicians who might conceivably be of service to an ambitious young Assistant Commissioner of Police, beautiful ladies to interest and amuse him. Kara had even gone to the length of engaging a theatrical company to play “Sweet Lavender,” and for this purpose the big ballroom at Hever Court had been transformed into a theatre.  As he was undressing for bed that night T. X. remembered that he had mentioned to Kara that “Sweet Lavender” was his favorite play, and he realized that the entertainment was got up especially for his benefit.  In a score of other ways Kara had endeavoured to consolidate the friendship. He gave the young Commissioner advice about a railway company which was operating in Asia Minor, and the shares of which stood a little below par. T. X. thanked him for the advice, and did not take it, nor did he feel any regret when the shares rose 3 pounds in as many weeks.  T. X. had superintended the disposal of Beston Priory. He had the furniture removed to London, and had taken a flat for Grace Lexman.  She had a small income of her own, and this, added to the large royalties which came to her (as she was bitterly conscious) in increasing volume as the result of the publicity of the trial, placed her beyond fear of want.  “Fifteen years,” murmured T. X., as he worked and whistled.  There had been no hope for John Lexman from the start. He was in debt to the man he killed. His story of threatening letters was not substantiated. The revolver which he said had been flourished at him had never been found. Two people believed implicitly in the story, and a sympathetic Home Secretary had assured T. X. personally that if he could find the revolver and associate it with the murder beyond any doubt, John Lexman would be pardoned.  Every stream in the neighbourhood had been dragged. In one case a small river had been dammed, and the bed had been carefully dried and sifted, but there was no trace of the weapon, and T. X. had tried methods more effective and certainly less legal.  A mysterious electrician had called at 456 Cadogan Square in Kara's absence, and he was armed with such indisputable authority that he was permitted to penetrate to Kara's private room, in order to examine certain fitments.  Kara returning next day thought no more of the matter when it was reported to him, until going to his safe that night he discovered that it had been opened and ransacked.  As it happened, most of Kara's valuable and confidential possessions were at the bank. In a fret of panic and at considerable cost he had the safe removed and another put in its place of such potency that the makers offered to indemnify him against any loss from burglary.  T. X. finished his work, washed his hands, and was drying them when Mansus came bursting into the room. It was not usual for Mansus to burst into anywhere. He was a slow, methodical, painstaking man, with a deliberate and an official, manner.  “What's the matter?” asked T. X. quickly.  “We didn't search Vassalaro's lodgings,” cried Mansus breathlessly. “It just occurred to me as I was coming over Westminster Bridge. I was on top of a bus--”  “Wake up!” said T. X. “You're amongst friends and cut all that 'bus' stuff out. Of course we searched Vassalaro's lodgings!”  “No, we didn't, sir,” said the other triumphantly. “He lived in Great James Street.”  “He lived in the Adelphi,” corrected T. X.  “There were two places where he lived,” said Mansus.  “When did you learn this?” asked his Chief, dropping his flippancy.  “This morning. I was on a bus coming across Westminster Bridge, and there were two men in front of me, and I heard the word 'Vassalaro' and naturally I pricked up my ears.”  “It was very unnatural, but proceed,” said T. X.  “One of the men--a very respectable person--said, 'That chap Vassalaro used to lodge in my place, and I've still got a lot of his things. What do you think I ought to do?'”  “And you said,” suggested the other.  “I nearly frightened his life out of him,” said Mansus. “I said, 'I am a police officer and I want you to come along with me.'”  “And of course he shut up and would not say another word,” said T. X.  “That's true, sir,” said Mansus, “but after awhile I got him to talk. Vassalaro lived in Great James Street, 604, on the third floor. In fact, some of his furniture is there still. He had a good reason for keeping two addresses by all accounts.”  T. X. nodded wisely.  “What was her name?” he asked.  “He had a wife,” said the other, “but she left him about four months before he was killed. He used the Adelphi address for business purposes and apparently he slept two or three nights of the week at Great James Street. I have told the man to leave everything as it is, and that we will come round.”  Ten minutes later the two officers were in the somewhat gloomy apartments which Vassalaro had occupied.  The landlord explained that most of the furniture was his, but that there were certain articles which were the property of the deceased man. He added, somewhat unnecessarily, that the late tenant owed him six months' rent.  The articles which had been the property of Vassalaro included a tin trunk, a small writing bureau, a secretaire bookcase and a few clothes. The secretaire was locked, as was the writing bureau. The tin box, which had little or nothing of interest, was unfastened.  The other locks needed very little attention. Without any difficulty Mansus opened both. The leaf of the bureau, when let down, formed the desk, and piled up inside was a whole mass of letters opened and unopened, accounts, note-books and all the paraphernalia which an untidy man collects.  Letter by letter, T. X. went through the accumulation without finding anything to help him. Then his eye was attracted by a small tin case thrust into one of the oblong pigeon holes at the back of the desk. This he pulled out and opened and found a small wad of paper wrapped in tin foil.  “Hello, hello!” said T. X., and he was pardonably exhilarated.     CHAPTER VI   A Man stood in the speckless courtyard before the Governor's house at Dartmoor gaol. He wore the ugly livery of shame which marks the convict. His head was clipped short, and there was two days' growth of beard upon his haggard face. Standing with his hands behind him, he waited for the moment when he would be ordered to his work.  John Lexman--A. O. 43--looked up at the blue sky as he had looked so many times from the exercise yard, and wondered what the day would bring forth. A day to him was the beginning and the end of an eternity. He dare not let his mind dwell upon the long aching years ahead. He dare not think of the woman he left, or let his mind dwell upon the agony which she was enduring. He had disappeared from the world, the world he loved, and the world that knew him, and all that there was in life; all that was worth while had been crushed and obliterated into the granite of the Princetown quarries, and its wide horizon shrunken by the gaunt moorland with its menacing tors.  New interests made up his existence. The quality of the food was one. The character of the book he would receive from the prison library another. The future meant Sunday chapel; the present whatever task they found him. For the day he was to paint some doors and windows of an outlying cottage. A cottage occupied by a warder who, for some reason, on the day previous, had spoken to him with a certain kindness and a certain respect which was unusual.  “Face the wall,” growled a voice, and mechanically he turned, his hands still behind him, and stood staring at the grey wall of the prison storehouse.  He heard the shuffling feet of the quarry gang, his ears caught the clink of the chains which bound them together. They were desperate men, peculiarly interesting to him, and he had watched their faces furtively in the early period of his imprisonment.  He had been sent to Dartmoor after spending three months in Wormwood Scrubbs. Old hands had told him variously that he was fortunate or unlucky. It was usual to have twelve months at the Scrubbs before testing the life of a convict establishment. He"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2688"],["title","The Clue of the Twisted Candle (#8)"],["body"," there was some talk of sending him to Parkhurst, and here he traced the influence which T. X. would exercise, for Parkhurst was a prisoner's paradise.  He heard his warder's voice behind him.  “Right turn, 43, quick march.”  He walked ahead of the armed guard, through the great and gloomy gates of the prison, turned sharply to the right, and walked up the village street toward the moors, beyond the village of Princetown, and on the Tavistock Road where were two or three cottages which had been lately taken by the prison staff; and it was to the decoration of one of these that A. O. 43 had been sent.  The house was as yet without a tenant.  A paper-hanger under the charge of another warder was waiting for the arrival of the painter. The two warders exchanged greetings, and the first went off leaving the other in charge of both men.  For an hour they worked in silence under the eyes of the guard. Presently the warder went outside, and John Lexman had an opportunity of examining his fellow sufferer.  He was a man of twenty-four or twenty-five, lithe and alert. By no means bad looking, he lacked that indefinable suggestion of animalism which distinguished the majority of the inhabitants at Dartmoor.  They waited until they heard the warder's step clear the passage, and until his iron-shod boots were tramping over the cobbled path which led from the door, through the tiny garden to the road, before the second man spoke.  “What are you in for?” he asked, in a low voice.  “Murder,” said John Lexman, laconically.  He had answered the question before, and had noticed with a little amusement the look of respect which came into the eyes of the questioner.  “What have you got!”  “Fifteen years,” said the other.  “That means 11 years and 9 months,” said the first man. “You've never been here before, I suppose?”  “Hardly,” said Lexman, drily.  “I was here when I was a kid,” confessed the paper-hanger. “I am going out next week.”  John Lexman looked at him enviously. Had the man told him that he had inherited a great fortune and a greater title his envy would not have been so genuine.  Going out!  The drive in the brake to the station, the ride to London in creased, but comfortable clothing, free as the air, at liberty to go to bed and rise when he liked, to choose his own dinner, to answer no call save the call of his conscience, to see--he checked himself.  “What are you in for?” he asked in self-defence.  “Conspiracy and fraud,” said the other cheerfully. “I was put away by a woman after three of us had got clear with 12,000 pounds. Damn rough luck, wasn't it?”  John nodded.  It was curious, he thought, how sympathetic one grows with these exponents of crimes. One naturally adopts their point of view and sees life through their distorted vision.  “I bet I'm not given away with the next lot,” the prisoner went on. “I've got one of the biggest ideas I've ever had, and I've got a real good man to help me.”  “How?” asked John, in surprise.  The man jerked his head in the direction of the prison.  “Larry Green,” he said briefly. “He's coming out next month, too, and we are all fixed up proper. We are going to get the pile and then we're off to South America, and you won't see us for dust.”  Though he employed all the colloquialisms which were common, his tone was that of a man of education, and yet there was something in his address which told John as clearly as though the man had confessed as much, that he had never occupied any social position in life.  The warder's step on the stones outside reduced them to silence. Suddenly his voice came up the stairs.  “Forty-three,” he called sharply, “I want you down here.”  John took his paint pot and brush and went clattering down the uncarpeted stairs.  “Where's the other man?” asked the warder, in a low voice.  “He's upstairs in the back room.”  The warder stepped out of the door and looked left and right. Coming up from Princetown was a big, grey car.  “Put down your paint pot,” he said.  His voice was shaking with excitement.  “I am going upstairs. When that car comes abreast of the gate, ask no questions and jump into it. Get down into the bottom and pull a sack over you, and do not get up until the car stops.”  The blood rushed to John Lexman's head, and he staggered.  “My God!” he whispered.  “Do as I tell you,” hissed the warder.  Like an automaton John put down his brushes, and walked slowly to the gate. The grey car was crawling up the hill, and the face of the driver was half enveloped in a big rubber mask. Through the two great goggles John could see little to help him identify the man. As the machine came up to the gate, he leapt into the tonneau and sank instantly to the bottom. As he did so he felt the car leap forward underneath him. Now it was going fast, now faster, now it rocked and swayed as it gathered speed. He felt it sweeping down hill and up hill, and once he heard a hollow rumble as it crossed a wooden bridge.  He could not detect from his hiding place in what direction they were going, but he gathered they had switched off to the left and were making for one of the wildest parts of the moor. Never once did he feel the car slacken its pace, until, with a grind of brakes, it stopped suddenly.  “Get out,” said a voice.  John Lexman threw off the cover and leapt out and as he did so the car turned and sped back the way it had come.  For a moment he thought he was alone, and looked around. Far away in the distance he saw the grey bulk of Princetown Gaol. It was an accident that he should see it, but it so happened that a ray of the sun fell athwart it and threw it into relief.  He was alone on the moors! Where could he go?  He turned at the sound of a voice.  He was standing on the slope of a small tor. At the foot there was a smooth stretch of green sward. It was on this stretch that the people of Dartmoor held their pony races in the summer months. There was no sign of horses; but only a great bat-like machine with out-stretched pinions of taut white canvas, and by that machine a man clad from head to foot in brown overalls.  John stumbled down the slope. As he neared the machine he stopped and gasped.  “Kara,” he said, and the brown man smiled.  “But, I do not understand. What are you going to do!” asked Lexman, when he had recovered from his surprise.  “I am going to take you to a place of safety,” said the other.  “I have no reason to be grateful to you, as yet, Kara,” breathed Lexman. “A word from you could have saved me.”  “I could not lie, my dear Lexman. And honestly, I had forgotten the existence of the letter; if that is what you are referring to, but I am trying to do what I can for you and for your wife.”  “My wife!”  “She is waiting for you,” said the other.  He turned his head, listening.  Across the moor came the dull sullen boom of a gun.  “You haven't time for argument. They discovered your escape,” he said. “Get in.”  John clambered up into the frail body of the machine and Kara followed.  “This is a self-starter,” he said, “one of the newest models of monoplanes.”  He clicked over a lever and with a roar the big three-bladed tractor screw spun.  The aeroplane moved forward with a jerk, ran with increasing gait for a hundred yards, and then suddenly the jerky progress ceased. The machine swayed gently from side to side, and looking over, the passenger saw the ground recede beneath him.  Up, up, they climbed in one long sweeping ascent, passing through drifting clouds till the machine soared like a bird above the blue sea.  John Lexman looked down. He saw the indentations of the coast and recognized the fringe of white houses that stood for Torquay, but in an incredibly short space of time all signs of the land were blotted out.  Talking was impossible. The roar of the engines defied penetration.  Kara was evidently a skilful pilot. From time to time he consulted the compass on the board before him, and changed his course ever so slightly. Presently he released one hand from the driving wheel, and scribbling on a little block of paper which was inserted in a pocket at the side of the seat he passed it back.  John Lexman read:       “If you cannot swim there is a life belt under your seat.”  John nodded.  Kara was searching the sea for something, and presently he found it. Viewed from the height at which they flew it looked no more than a white speck in a great blue saucer, but presently the machine began to dip, falling at a terrific rate of speed, which took away the breath of the man who was hanging on with both hands to the dangerous seat behind.  He was deadly cold, but had hardly noticed the fact. It was all so incredible, so impossible. He expected to wake up and wondered if the prison was also part of the dream.  Now he saw the point for which Kara was making.  A white steam yacht, long and narrow of beam, was steaming slowly westward. He could see the feathery wake in her rear, and as the aeroplane fell he had time to observe that a boat had been put off. Then with a jerk the monoplane flattened out and came like a skimming bird to the surface of the water; her engines stopped.  “We ought to be able to keep afloat for ten minutes,” said Kara, “and by that time they will pick us up.”  His voice was high and harsh in the almost painful silence which followed the stoppage of the engines.  In less than five minutes the boat had come alongside, manned, as Lexman gathered from a glimpse of the crew, by Greeks. He scrambled aboard and five minutes later he was standing on the white deck of the yacht, watching the disappearing tail of the monoplane. Kara was by his side.  “There goes fifteen hundred pounds,” said the Greek, with a smile, “add that to the two thousand I paid the warder and you have a tidy sum-but some things are worth all the money in the world!”      CHAPTER VII   T. X. came from Downing Street at 11 o'clock one night, and his heart was filled with joy and gratitude.  He swung his stick to the common danger of the public,"]]]
