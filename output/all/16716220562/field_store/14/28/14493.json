We were outspace over a century, you know, and when we got back the inspection teams found so many things wrong with the ship that she needs just about a complete overhauling. They've been working her over for the last two weeks, and the way it looks it'll be another couple of weeks before she's ready to go. And I don't know how much longer I can stand being penned up in this Enclave.\"  \"That's exactly how your brother----\" Roger started to say, and stopped. \"Sorry.\"  \"That's okay,\" Alan said.  Quantrell cocked an eye. \"What's that?\"  \"My brother. I had a twin, but he got restless and jumped ship last time we were down. He got left behind at blastoff time.\"  Quantrell nodded understandingly. \"Too bad. But I know what he was up against--and I envy the lucky so-and-so. I wish _I_ had the guts to just walk out like that. Every day that goes by in this place, I say I'm going over the hill next day. But I never do, somehow. I just sit here and wait.\"  Alan glanced down the quiet sun-warmed street. Here and there a couple of venerable-looking starmen were sitting, swapping stories of their youth--a youth that had been a thousand years before. The Enclave, Alan thought, is a place for old men.  They walked on for a while until the buzzing neon signs of a feelie theater were visible. \"I'm going in,\" Roger said. \"This place is starting to depress me. You?\"  Alan shot a glance at Quantrell, who made a face and shook his head. \"I guess I'll skip it,\" Alan said. \"Not just now.\"  \"Count me out too,\" Quantrell said.  Roger looked sourly from one to the other, and shrugged. \"I think I'll go all the same. I'm in the mood for a good show. See you around, Alan.\"  After Roger left them, Alan and Quantrell walked on through the Enclave together. Alan wondered whether it wasn't a good idea to have gone to the feelie with Roger after all; the Enclave was starting to depress him, too, and those three-dimensional shows had a way of taking your mind off things.  But he was curious about Quantrell. It wasn't often he had a chance to talk with someone his own age from another ship. \"You know,\" he said, \"we starmen lead an empty life. You don't get to realize it until you come to the Enclave.\"  \"I decided that a long time ago,\" Quantrell said.  Alan spread his hands. \"What do we do? We dash back and forth through space, and we huddle here in the Enclave. And we don't like either one or the other, but we fool ourselves into liking them. When we're in space we can't wait to get to the Enclave, and once we're down here we can't wait to get back. Some life.\"  \"Got any suggestions? Some way of fixing things up for us without queering interstellar commerce?\"  \"Yes,\" Alan snapped. \"I do have a suggestion. Hyperspace drive!\"  Quantrell laughed harshly. \"Of all the cockeyed----\"  \"There you are,\" Alan said angrily. \"First thing you do is laugh. A spacewarp drive is just some hairbrained scheme to you. But haven't you ever considered that Earth's scientists won't bother developing such a drive for us if we don't care ourselves? They're just as happy the way things are. _They_ don't have to worry about the Fitzgerald Contraction.\"  \"But there's been steady research on a hyperdrive, hasn't there? Ever since Cavour, I thought.\"  \"On and off. But they don't take it very seriously and they don't get anywhere with it. If they'd really put some men to work they'd find it--and then there wouldn't be any more Enclaves or any Fitzgerald Contraction, and we starmen could live normal lives.\"  \"And your brother--he wouldn't be cut off from his people the way he is----\"  \"Sure. But you laughed instead of thinking.\"  Quantrell looked contrite. \"Sorry. Guess I didn't put much jet behind my think-machine that time. But a hyperdrive would wipe out the Enclave system, wouldn't it?\"  \"Of course! We'd be able to come home from space and take a normal part in Earth's life, instead of pulling away and segregating ourselves here.\"  Alan looked up at the seemingly unreachable towers of the Earther city just across the river from the Enclave. Somewhere out there was Steve. And perhaps somewhere out there was someone he could talk to about the hyperdrive, someone influential who might spur the needed research.  The Earther city seemed to be calling to him. It was a voice that was hard to resist. He savagely jammed down deep inside him the tiny inner voice that was trying to object. He turned, looking backward at the dingy dreary buildings of the Enclave.  He looked then at Quantrell. \"You said you've been wanting to break loose. You want to get out of the Enclave, eh, Kevin?\"  \"Yes,\" Quantrell said slowly.  Alan felt excitement beginning to pound hard in the pit of his stomach. \"How'd you like to go outside there with me? See the Earther city?\"  \"You mean _jump ship_?\"  The naked words, put just that bluntly, stung. \"No,\" Alan said, thinking of how his father's face had gone stony the time Alan had told him Steve wasn't coming back. \"I mean just going out for a day or so--a sort of change of air. It's five days till the _Valhalla's_ due to blast off, and you say the _Encounter_ is stuck here indefinitely. We could just go for a day or so--just to see what it's like out there.\"  Quantrell was silent a long time.  \"Just for a day or so?\" he asked, at last. \"We'll just go out, and have a look around, just to see what it's like out there.\" He fell silent again. Alan saw a little trickle of sweat burst out on Quantrell's cheek. He felt strangely calm himself, a little to his own surprise.  Then Quantrell smiled and the confidence returned to his tanned face. \"I'm game. Let's go!\"  But Rat was quizzical about the whole enterprise when Alan returned to his room to get him.  \"You aren't serious, Alan. You really are going over to the Earther city?\"  Alan nodded and gestured for the little extra-terrestrial to take his usual perch. \"Are you daring to take my word in vain, Rat?\" he asked in mock histrionics. \"When I say I'm going to do something, I do it.\" He snapped closed his jacket and flipped the switch controlling the archaic fluorescent panels. \"Besides, you can always stay here if you want to, you know.\"  \"Never mind,\" Rat said. \"I'm coming.\" He leaped up and anchored himself securely on Alan's shoulder.  Kevin Quantrell was waiting for them in front of the building. As Alan emerged Rat said, \"One question, Alan.\"  \"Shoot.\"  \"Level, now: are you coming back--or are you going over the way Steve did?\"  \"You ought to know me better than that. I've got reasons for going out, but they're not Steve's reasons.\"  \"I hope so.\"  Quantrell came up to them, and it seemed to Alan that there was something unconvincing about his broad grin. He looked nervous. Alan wondered whether he looked the same way.  \"All set?\" Quantrell asked.  \"Set as I'll ever be. Let's go.\"  Alan looked around to see if anybody he knew might be watching. There was no one around. Quantrell started walking, and Alan fell in behind him.  \"I hope you know where you're going,\" Alan said. \"Because I don't.\"  Kevin pointed down the long winding street. \"We go down to the foot of this street, turn right into Carhill Boulevard, head down the main drive toward the bridge. The Earther city is on the other side of the river.\"  \"You better be right.\"  They made it at a fairly good clip through the sleepy Enclave, passing rapidly through the old, dry, dusty streets. Finally they came to the end of the street and rounded the corner onto Carhill Boulevard.  The first thing Alan saw was the majestic floating curve of the bridge. Then he saw the Earther city, a towering pile of metal and masonry that seemed to be leaping up into the sky ahead of them, completely filling the view.  Alan pointed to the bridge-mouth. \"That's where we go across, isn't it?\"  But Quantrell hung back. He stopped in his tracks, staring dangle-jawed at the immense city facing them.  \"There it is,\" he said quietly.  \"Sure. Let's go, eh?\" Alan felt a sudden burst of impatience and started heading toward the approach to the bridge.  But after three or four paces he realized Quantrell was not with him. He turned and saw the other spaceman still rooted to the ground, gazing up at the vast Earther city as if in narcoshock.  \"It's big,\" Quantrell murmured. \"_Too_ big.\"  \"_Kevin!_ What's wrong?\"  \"Leave him alone,\" Rat whispered. \"I have a hunch he won't be going with you.\"  Alan watched in astonishment as Quantrell took two steps hesitantly backward away from the bridge, then a third. There was a strange, almost thunderstruck expression on Kevin's face.  Then he broke out of it. He shook his head.  \"We aren't really going across--huh, Donnell?\" He gave a brittle little laugh.  \"Of course we are!\" Alan looked around nervously, hoping no one from the _Valhalla_ had spotted him in all this time. Puzzled at Quantrell's sudden hesitation after his earlier cockiness, Alan took a couple of shuffling steps toward the bridge, slowly, keeping his eyes on the other starman.  \"I can't go with you,\" Kevin finally managed to say. His face was flushed and strained-looking. He was staring upward at the seemingly topless towers of the city. \"It's too big for me.\" He choked back a half-whimper. \"The trouble with me is--the--trouble--with--me--is----\" Quantrell lowered his head and met Alan's stare. \"I'm afraid, Donnell. Stinking sweaty afraid. The city's too big.\"  Red-faced, he turned and walked away, back up the street.  Alan silently watched him go.  \"Imagine that. Afraid!\"  \"It's a big place,\" Rat warned. \"Don't you feel the same way? Just a little?\"  \"I feel perfectly calm,\" Alan said in utter sincerity. \"I know why I'm going over there, and I'm"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27444"],["title","Starman's Quest (#6)"],["body","to get moving. I'm not running away, the way Steve was. I'm going to the Earther city to find my brother and to find Cavour's drive, and to bring them both back here!\"  \"That's a tall order, Alan.\"  \"I'll do it.\"  Alan reached the approach to the bridge in a few more brisk steps and paused there. The noonday sun turned the long arch of the bridge into a golden ribbon in the sky. A glowing sign indicated the pedestrian walkway. Above that, shining teardrop autos whirred by, leaving faint trails of exhaust. Alan followed the arrows and soon found himself on the bridge, heading for the city.  He glanced back a last time. There was no sign of Kevin. The Starmen's Enclave seemed utterly quiet, almost dead.  Then he turned and kept his gaze forward. The Earther city was waiting for him.     _Chapter Five_   He reached the end of the walkway and paused, a little stunned, staring at the incredible immensity of the city spread out before him.  \"It's a big place,\" he said. \"I've never been in a city this big.\"  \"You were born here,\" Rat reminded him.  Alan laughed. \"But I only stayed here a week or two at most. And that was three hundred years ago. The city's probably twice as big now as it was then. It----\"  \"Hey, you! Move on!\" a harsh voice from behind snapped suddenly.  \"What's that?\"  Alan whirled and saw a tall, bored-looking man in a silver-gray uniform with gleaming luminescent bands across the sleeves, standing on a raised platform above the road.  \"You can't just stand here and block the walkway,\" the tall man said. His words were heavily accented, thickly guttural; Alan had a little trouble understanding them. The ship's language never changed; that of Earth kept constantly evolving. \"Get back in the Enclave where you belong, or get moving, but don't stand here or I'll punch your ticket for you.\"  Alan took a couple of steps forward. \"Just hold on a minute. Who----\"  \"He's a policeman, Alan,\" Rat said softly. \"Don't make trouble. Do as he says.\"  Throttling his sudden anger, Alan nodded curtly at the officer and stepped off the walkway. He was an outsider here, and knew he couldn't expect the sort of warm fellowship that existed aboard the ship.  This was a city. A crowded, uncomfortable Earther city. These were the people who were left behind, who never saw the stars in naked glory. They weren't going to be particularly polite.  Alan found himself at an intersection, and wondered where he was to begin. He had some vague idea of finding Steve in this city as easily as he might aboard ship--just check the A Deck roster, then the B Deck, and so on until he found him. But cities weren't quite that neatly organized, Alan realized.  A long broad street ran parallel to the river. It didn't seem very promising: lined with office buildings and warehouses. At right angles to it, though, stretching out in front of him, was a colorful, crowded avenue that appeared to be a major artery of the city. He glanced tentatively in both directions, waited till a lull came in the steady procession of tiny bullet-shaped automobiles flashing by, and hastily jogged across the waterfront street and started down the avenue.  Maybe there was some kind of register of population at the City Hall. If Steve still lived in this city, he could look him up that way. If not----  Facing him were two rows of immense buildings, one on each side of the street. Above every three blocks there was a lacy aerial passageway connecting a building on one side of the street with one on the other, high above the ground. Alan looked up and saw black dots--they looked like ants, but they were people--making their way across the flexi-bridges at dizzying altitudes.  The streets were crowded. Busy stern-faced people raced madly from one place to the next; Alan was accustomed to the more orderly and peaceful life of a starship, and found himself getting jostled by passersby from both directions.  He was surprised to find the streets full of peddlers, weary-looking little men trundling along behind small slow-moving self-powered monocars full of vegetables and other produce. Every few moments one would stop and hawk his wares. As Alan started hesitantly up the endless-seeming street, one of the venders stopped virtually in front of him and looked at him imploringly. He was a small untidy-looking man with a dirty face and a red scar streaking his left cheek.  \"Hey, boy.\" He spoke in a soft slurred voice. \"Hey, boy. Got something nice for you here.\"  Alan looked at him, puzzled. The vender reached into his cart and pulled out a long yellow fruit with a small, thick green stem at one end. \"Go on, boy. Treat yourself to some of these. Guild-grown, fresh-ripened, best there are. Half a credit for this one.\" He held it almost under Alan's nose. \"Go on,\" he said insistently.  Alan fished in his pocket and produced one of the half-credit pieces he had been given in the Enclave commissary. For all he knew it was the custom of this city for a new arrival to buy the first thing offered to him by a vender; in any event, he was hungry, and it seemed that this was the easiest way to get rid of the little man. He held out the coin.  \"Here. I'll take it.\"  The vender handed the piece of fruit over and Alan accepted it. He studied it, wondering what he was supposed to do now. It had a thick, tough rind that didn't seem at all appetizing.  The vender chuckled. \"What's the matter, boy? Never seen a banana before? Or ain't you hungry?\" The little man's derisive face was thrust up almost against Alan's chin.  He backed away a step or two. \"Banana? Oh, sure.\"  He put the end of the banana in his mouth and was just about to take a bite when a savage burst of laughter cut him off.  \"Looka him!\" the vender cried. \"Stupid spacer don't even know how to eat a banana! Looka! Looka!\"  Alan took the fruit out of his mouth unbitten and stared uncomprehendingly at it. He felt uneasy; nothing in his past experience had prepared him for deliberate hostility on the part of other people. Aboard ship, you did your job and went your way; you didn't force your presence on other people or poke fun at them maliciously. It was the only way to live when you had to spend your whole lifetime with the same shipload of men and women.  But the little vender wasn't going away. He seemed very amused by everything. \"You--you a spacer, no?\" he demanded. By now a small crowd had paused and was watching the scene.  Alan nodded.  \"Lemme show you how, spacer,\" the vender said, mockery topmost in his tone. He snatched the banana back from Alan and ripped back the rind with three rough snaps of his wrist. \"Go on. Eat it this way. She tastes better without the peel.\" He laughed raucously. \"Looka the spacer!\"  Someone else in the crowd said, \"What's he doing in the city anyway? He jump ship?\"  \"Yeah? Why ain't he in the Enclave like all the rest of them?\"  Alan looked from one to the other with a troubled expression on his face. He didn't want to touch off any serious incident, but he was determined not to let these Earthers push him around, either. He ignored the ring of hostile faces about him and calmly bit into the banana. The unfamiliar taste pleased him. Despite hoots and catcalls from the crowd he finished it.  \"Now the spacer knows how to eat a banana,\" the vender commented acidly. \"Here, spacer. Have another.\"  \"I don't want another.\"  \"Huh? No good? Earth fruits are _too_ good for you, starman. You better learn that fast.\"  \"Let's get out of here,\" Rat said quietly.  It was sensible advice. These people were just baiting him like a bunch of hounds ringing a hare. He flexed his shoulder in a signal that meant he agreed with Rat's suggestion.  \"Have another banana,\" the vender repeated obstinately.  Alan looked around at the crowd. \"I said I didn't want another banana, and I _don't_ want one. Now get out of my way!\"  No one moved. The vender and his monocar blocked the path.  \"Get out of my way, I said.\" Alan balled the slimy banana peel up in his hand and rammed it suddenly into the vender's face. \"There. Chew on that a while.\"  He shouldered his way past the spluttering fruit vender, and before anyone in the crowd could say or do anything he was halfway down the street, walking briskly. He lost himself in the passing stream of pedestrians. It was easy to do, despite the conspicuous orange-and-blue of his _Valhalla_ uniform. There were so many people.  He went on for two unmolested blocks, walking quickly without looking back. Finally he decided he was safe. He glanced up at Rat. The little extra-terrestrial was sitting patiently astride his shoulder, deep, as usual, in some mysterious thoughts of his own.  \"Rat?\"  \"What, Alan?\"  \"Why'd they do that? Why did those people act that way? I was a perfect stranger. They had no business making trouble for me.\"  \"That's precisely it--you _were_ a complete stranger. They don't love you for it. You're 300 years old and still 17 at the same time. They can't understand that. These people don't like starmen very much. The people in this city aren't ever going to see the stars, Alan. Stars are just faint specks of light that peek through the city haze at night. They're terribly, terribly jealous of you--and this is the way they show it.\"  \"Jealous? But why? If they only knew what a starman's life is like, with the Contraction and all! If they could only see what it is to leave your home and never be able to go back----\"  \"They can't see it, Alan. All they can see is that you have the stars and they don't. They resent it.\"  Alan shrugged. \"Let them go to space, then, if they don't like it here. No one's stopping them.\"  They walked on silently for a while. Alan continued to revolve the incident in his mind. He realized he had a lot to learn about people, particularly Earther people. He could handle himself pretty well aboard ship, but down on Earth he was a rank greenhorn and he'd have to step carefully.  He looked gloomily at the maze of streets before him and half-wishe"]]]
