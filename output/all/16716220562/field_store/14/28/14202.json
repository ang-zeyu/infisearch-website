Four were used as stowing-places for baggage, the remaining ones had been given up to the two prisoners.  The roof was almost hidden by numerous pipes, most of them running fore and aft, while a few branched off through the walls. The flat bulkhead evidently formed one of the walls of the engine-room, for, as the lad placed his hand against it to steady himself, he could feel a distinct tremor, quite different from the vibration under his feet.  The floor was of steel, with a raised chequer pattern in order to give a better grip to one's feet.  At frequent intervals there were circular places, similar to those covering the coal-shoots in the pavement of residential thoroughfares.  Walls, ceiling, and floor were covered with beads of moisture, but whether from condensation or leakage Ross could not decide.  At the end of the corridor or alley-way was a steel water-tight door, running in gun-metal grooves packed with india-rubber.  The door was closed.  Seizing the lever that served as a handle, Trefusis tried to turn it, but without success.  Failing that, he kicked the steelwork with his heavy half-boots, yet no response came to his appeal.  \"The fellow told me to call,\" he muttered airily.  \"What did he want to play the fool for?\"  Retracing his steps, Ross went to the other end of the alley-way. There was barely room to pass his companion as he did so.  The place from which he had previously seen the reflected light was now shut off by a door similarly constructed to the one that he had vainly attempted to open.  He was locked in a steel tomb that was itself a metal box within a metal box--a water-tight compartment of the submarine.  \"They might just as well have switched off the light while they were about it,\" he exclaimed bitterly; then at the next instant he wildly regretted his words.  The idea of being imprisoned in that cheerless compartment without a light of any description appalled him.  Almost frantically he returned to the door that had previously baffled him.  As he did so he became aware that the submarine was tilting longitudinally.  Since he was unaware of the direction of the craft, and which was the bow or stern, he was unable to judge whether the unterseeboot was diving, or ascending to the surface.  The incline became so great that he had to grasp the door-lever for support.  Turning his head, he saw that Vernon was hanging on grimly to the partition between the tiers of bunks.  Then, as the vessel regained an even keel, silently and smoothly the door slid back in its grooves, revealing a small space barely six feet in length and five in breadth, and separated from the rest of the vessel by a closed water-tight panel.  Part of the compartment was occupied by a bend, at which the seaman to whom he had previously spoken was busily engaged in mending a rent in an oilskin coat.  \"My friend is now awake,\" announced Ross.  The man laid aside his work.  \"Good!\" he replied.  \"He is just in time.  I will bring him his food and his clothes.  After that you will both go on deck for fresh air before you are interviewed by Herr Kapitan Schwalbe.  See that door? Beyond that you must not pass without permission.  It is forbidden.  If you do so, you will not have another opportunity in a hurry.\"  \"What are they going to do with us?\" asked Ross.  The sailor shook his head.  \"It is forbidden to ask questions,\" he said sternly.  \"Whatever is necessary that you should know will be told you.\"  He turned his back upon his questioner, signifying in a plain manner that it was useless for Trefusis to say more.  Taking the hint the lad returned to his chum, wondering deeply at the fate that had thrown them into the hands of the enemy.     CHAPTER V  Aboard U75  Like Ross, Vernon Haye made a poor meal.  He had barely finished when a petty officer appeared and curtly ordered the lads to follow him. Since he did so in German it was fairly certain that Trefusis' admission had been communicated to both officers and crew.  Staggering, they passed along the alley-way into a broad subdivision that extended completely athwartships.  It was one of the two broadside torpedo-rooms, and contained two tubes of slightly greater diameter than the British 21-inch.  In \"launching-trays\" by the side of the tubes were eight torpedoes with their deadly war-heads attached.  Both transverse bulkheads were almost hidden by indicators, voice-tubes, and pipes for transmitting the compressed air from the air-flasks to the torpedo-tubes.  Passing through another water-tight door the prisoners found themselves in yet another compartment.  On one side was an \"air-lock\", with its complement of life-saving helmets; on the other was an oval-shaped door forming means of communication with the small room built against the curved sides of the submarine.  Ross guessed, and rightly as it afterwards transpired, that the door led into a space that could be flooded at will, and which in turn enabled a diver to operate from the U-boat while submerged.  Confronting the lads was an almost perpendicular steel ladder communicating with the conning-tower.  Their guide was about to ascend when a stern voice exclaimed in German:  \"Not that, you idiotic clodhopper!  Have you lost your reason?  The forward hatchway, don't you know?\"  \"Pardon, Herr Leutnant,\" said the petty officer, abjectly apologetic, and, backing down the ladder, he passed through another door entering into an alley-way between the officers' cabins.  Here was the bowl of a supplementary periscope, so that a vision of what was taking place could be obtained without going into the conning-tower.  The alley-way terminated at another broadside torpedo-room, the pairs of tubes pointing in the opposite direction to those the lads had just seen.  Beyond were the living-quarters of the crew, kept spotlessly clean and tidy, yet Spartan-like in their simplicity.  Two of the men were sound asleep in their bunks.  Three more, who were playing cards at a plain deal table, glanced up from their game as the British lads passed by; but their interest was of brief duration, and stolidly they resumed their play.  Stooping down to avoid a large metal trough--the \"house\" for the for'ard 105-millimetre disappearing gun--Ross and his chum arrived at the ladder by which they were to gain the open air.  The hatch-cover was thrown back.  For the first time during their captivity they made the discovery that it was night.  Looking upwards, they could see a rectangle of dark sky twinkling with stars that, with the slight motion of the submarine, appeared to sway to and fro.  The cool night breeze fanned their heated foreheads as they gained the deck.  For some time, coming suddenly from the glare of the electrically lighted interior, their eyes were blinded.  They could see nothing but an indistinct blurr of star-lit, gently heaving water.  Gradually the sense of vision returned.  They found themselves on the fore-deck of the unterseeboot.  They had made up their minds to see a turtle-back deck with a narrow level platform in the centre; instead they found that the deck was almost flat and, in nautical parlance, flush, save where it was broken by the elongated conning-tower topped by the twin periscopes and slender wireless mast.  Lying on the deck in all conceivable attitudes were most of the U-boat's crew, taking advantage of a brief spell on the surface to breathe deeply of the ozone-laden atmosphere.  Not a light was visible on board.  Even the hatchway by which the lads had gained the deck was constructed to trap any stray beam from the brilliant glare below.  Miles away, and low down upon the horizon, a white light blinked solemnly; then after a brief interval it was succeeded by a red gleam. This in turn was followed by white again.  Trefusis, with a sailor's inborn instinct, began to count the intervals.  Although having no means of consulting the only time-recording watch in the possession of the two captives, he had a fair idea of counting seconds.  At fourteen from the disappearance of the red light the white appeared.  An almost identical space of time occurred before the red reappeared.  \"It's the Wolf Light,\" mentally ejaculated the lad.  His next step was to fix the bearing of the lighthouse.  This he did by looking for the Great Bear, and then, following the Pointers, the North Star.  \"Phew!\" he muttered softly.  \"Nor'-nor'-west.  This brute of a submarine is right in the chops of the Channel--the main highway for vessels making for London and the south coast ports.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Vernon, who heard his chum speaking, but had failed to grasp the significance of his words.  \"Nothing,\" replied Ross almost in a whisper.  \"I'll tell you later.\"  The cool air had revived both lads wonderfully.  They had been left to their own devices, for the petty officer had gone aft.  Those of the crew who were on deck seemed as apathetic as the men below concerning the presence of the kidnapped youths.  They looked like men utterly worn out by fatigue and nervous strain.  Grasping the flexible wire hand-rail Ross continued his survey of the horizon, all of which was visible except a small portion obscured by the rise of the conning-tower.  The air was remarkably clear.  Taking into consideration the refraction of the atmosphere, the navigation lamps of a vessel shown at twenty feet above the sea would be visible from the low-lying deck of the submarine at a distance of six to seven miles.  But there were no signs of any vessels in the vicinity.  The German submarine rolled lazily in complete isolation, waiting, like a snake in the grass, for its prey.  \"Herr Kapitan would see you,\" exclaimed the guttural voice of the petty officer.  \"Come aft.  Remember, when you are addressed, to remove your caps.\"  The man led the way, making no attempt to avoid the recumbent limbs and bodies of the crew who impeded his passage.  Treading with discretion Ross and Vernon followed till, after skirting the base of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26641"],["title","The Submarine Hunters: A Story of the Naval Patrol Work in the Great War (#6)"],["body","nning-tower, they found themselves in the presence of Lieutenant-Commander Schwalbe, the Kapitan of U75.  Schwalbe was sitting in a small arm-chair which had been brought from his cabin.  He was smoking a cigar.  At his elbow stood his satellite, Hermann Rix, who was also smoking.  This luxury was denied the crew, the officers being permitted to smoke only when the submarine was running awash or resting on the surface.  [Illustration: THE INTERVIEW WITH THE GERMAN CAPTAIN (missing from book)]  \"So you have recovered from your little involuntary rest,\" exclaimed Schwalbe in excellent English.  He was a remarkably good linguist, for previous to the outbreak of the war he had been the skipper of a North-German-Lloyd boat.  By sheer good luck he had reached a home port the day after the momentous declaration of hostilities, having narrowly escaped capture by a British destroyer.  Owing to the great expansion of the German submarine service, and its equally rapid reduction at the hands of the British Navy, the supply of specially trained officers of the Imperial Navy for this branch had run out.  More had been transferred from the pent-up High Seas Fleet, while others had been absorbed from the now useless German Mercantile Marine, and hastily put through a course of instruction.  Schwalbe was one of these, and after less than two months' hazardous work in the capacity of Unter-leutnant found himself in command of U75, one of the \"last words\" of von Tirpitz's piratical fleet.  Neither Ross nor Vernon replied.  They could form no suitable answer. It was no doubt very considerate on the part of the Kapitan to enquire after their healths, but somehow the lads felt that the skipper of U75 was responsible for their presence on board.  \"Come, come,\" continued Schwalbe.  \"Don't be sulky.\"  \"We are not,\" expostulated Ross.  \"I'm glad to hear it,\" rejoined the Kapitan, with a grin that had the effect of letting his cigar fall to the deck.  He stooped to retrieve it, but, suddenly remembering that it was beneath his dignity, changed his mind and kicked the glowing stump on one side.  Having taken another from a gun-metal case, he lit it with a device that merely smouldered instead of giving a bright light.  \"It is as well we understand each other,\" he continued.  \"Do you know why you are on board U75?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied Ross.  \"Neither do I,\" rejoined Schwalbe with astonishing candour.  \"I wish I had not been honoured with your company.\"  \"The remedy is in your hands then, sir,\" said Trefusis.  \"You can land us the next time you put in at St. Mena's Island for petrol, or else put us on board the first fishing craft we fall in with.\"  \"I beg to differ,\" was the rejoinder.  \"Unfortunately you are on board, and you must make the best of it, I understand from my friend--shall I say Dr. Ramblethorne--that you are both very inquisitive. Inquisitiveness is a bad trait in ones so young.  You see, it has got you into trouble.  The doctor has strong reasons for getting me to take care of you for some considerable time, so you will have an opportunity of seeing how we Germans make war.  No half-measures, mark you.  It is useless to make war with a velvet glove.  You English people call us pirates, I believe?\"  \"It certainly looks like piracy when German submarines sink harmless merchantmen without warning,\" declared Vernon.  \"For my part I have never sent a merchant vessel to the bottom without warning,\" said Schwalbe.  \"As a seaman I regret having to sink any ship of commerce.  As an officer of the German Navy I have to obey orders unquestionably.  Nevertheless I have always given the crews of British ships a chance of escape, and have never sunk any vessel until the men are safely in the boats, unless she attempts to show fight or to run away.\"  \"Would you blame a skipper for trying to save his ship?\" asked Ross.  \"You do not understand,\" exclaimed Schwalbe.  \"We are at war.  A blockade has been declared upon the British Islands.  If, after full warning, merchantmen persist in taking the risk, it is their look-out, not mine.  However, to return to a more personal matter: having been saddled with you, I must endure your presence.  You will be well fed, as far as the resources at our command will allow.  You will be free to go wherever you wish on board, with the exception of the conning-tower, motor- and torpedo-rooms.  I am not ungrateful, for my brother, who had the misfortune to be in the _Ariadne_, was captured by your fleet.  He is being well treated somewhere in England.  Hence I give privileges to the son of Admiral Trefusis and the son of Commander Haye so long as they are my compulsory guests.  But bear in mind: you will be watched. Should you commit any fault, however slight, you will pay dearly for it.  If you are foolish enough to attempt any act of treachery, death will be the penalty.  Have I made myself perfectly clear?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied both lads.  \"Very well.  Is there anything you would like me to do within the bounds of reason?\"  \"Could we communicate with our parents?\" asked Ross.  \"No,\" replied Schwalbe decisively.  \"There are strong objections.  And, while I am on the subject, should you fall in with the crews of destroyed ships you are strictly forbidden to communicate with them either by word or gesture.  That will be a punishable offence of the second degree.  Anything more?\"  \"My friend has had a nasty knock on the head,\" said Trefusis.  \"Have you a doctor on board?\"  Again Kapitan Schwalbe smiled broadly.  \"No,\" he replied.  \"There is no need.  Cases of illness must wait till we return to port.  The only injuries we are likely to sustain would put us beyond all medical aid.  But several of the men are fairly skilled in rough surgery, so I will----\"  \"Vessel on the port bow, sir; she's showing no lights,\" announced a voice.  \"All hands to stations!\" ordered the skipper.  \"Down below with you!\" hissed the petty officer, who during the interview had stood rigidly at attention at two paces to the rear of his charges.  Already the hitherto recumbent men were alert.  Quickly, yet in order, they disappeared down the fore hatchway, and amongst them were Ross and Vernon.  The officers had taken their places inside the shelter of the conning-tower.  Everything was battened down from within, and with a gentle purr the electric motors were set in motion, while at the same time water ballast was admitted into the trimming-tanks.  Swift and stealthy had been their preparations, but the presence of the submarine was betrayed by the phosphorescent swirl of the water caused by the churning of the twin propellers as she slipped beneath the surface.  Twenty seconds later a swift vessel that looked suspiciously like a trawler, although her speed belied her, tore over the place where U75 had disappeared.  Bare inches only separated the top of the latter's conning-tower from the massive keel plates of the craft that had all but accomplished its mission.  The watch-dogs of the British Navy were at work.     CHAPTER VI  The Tramp  Like a startled hare the unterseeboot fled for shelter.  Not until she reached a depth of fifteen fathoms did she check her diagonally downward course.  At intervals a dull booming, audible above the rattle of the motors, proclaimed the unpleasant fact that her antagonist was circling around the spot marked by the phosphorescent swirl and the iridescence of escaped oil, and was firing explosive grapnels in the hope of ripping open the U-boat's hull.  Kapitan Schwalbe, looking very grey in the artificial light, was standing behind the quartermaster.  His hands were clenched in momentary apprehension.  Beads of perspiration stood out upon his forehead.  He was experiencing a foretaste of the torment of the lost.  As a submarine officer of the Imperial German Navy he was a failure. Only sheer luck had hitherto saved him from the fate that had overtaken scores of his brother officers in that branch of the service.  Skilled as he was in the handling of a huge liner, he lacked the iron nerve that is essential to the man who has to risk his life in a steel box that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, offers no means of escape in the event of a catastrophe.  Yet he had to do his duty, notwithstanding his utter distaste for submarine work.  He had had no option.  The officers of the British Navy volunteer for submarine duties; those of the German Navy are simply told off whether they want to or not.  The nerve-racking work was beginning to tell upon him.  His orders condemned him to a forlorn hope, for the English Channel was known to be a death-trap for the under-sea blockaders.  The sight of a trawler filled him with feelings akin to terror.  The possibility, nay probability, of a merchantman carrying guns made him approach his intended prey with the utmost caution; yet, as he had remarked to Ross Trefusis, he had never torpedoed any vessel flying the red ensign without giving her warning.  But it was not chivalry that prompted Schwalbe to act with consideration.  Had he been untrammelled he would have sent his prey to the bottom without compunction, for he had all the brutal instincts of the kultured Hun.  It was a superstitious fear that held his frightfulness in check--a presentiment based upon the Mosaic Law, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  Having placed a considerable distance between him and his attacker, Kapitan Schwalbe ordered the electric motors to be stopped.  The ballast tanks were \"blown\", and cautiously U75 rose to the surface.  It was the best course open to her.  The depth of the water was much too great to allow her to rest on the bed of the sea.  On the other hand, in order to keep submerged, the motors would have to be in motion.  No one knew better than Schwalbe that the British patrol-boats would be in a position to locate with uncanny certitude the presence of their quarry, unless the strictest silence were maintained by the fugitive.  So, ready to dive at the first"]]]
