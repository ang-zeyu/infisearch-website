Thus this preface shows the supreme purpose of Luke was to confirm the belief of Theophilus, who is apparently his patron and friend, and to deepen his conviction of the truth of the gospel story. Surely, such an introduction must remind every reader that our Christian faith is based upon an impregnable foundation of historic fact.      II. THE BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD OF JESUS. CHS. 1:5 TO 2:52     A. The Birth of John Foretold. Chs. 1:5-25       5 There was in the days of Herod, king of Judæa, a certain priest     named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the     daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. 6 And they were     both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and     ordinances of the Lord blameless. 7 And they had no child, because     that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were _now_ well stricken     in years.       8 Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office     before God in the order of his course, 9 according to the custom     of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of     the Lord and burn incense. 10 And the whole multitude of the     people were praying without at the hour of incense. 11 And there     appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side     of the altar of incense. 12 And Zacharias was troubled when he saw     _him_, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said unto him,     Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy     wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name     John. 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall     rejoice at his birth. 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the     Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be     filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. 16 And     many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their     God. 17 And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of     Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the     disobedient _to walk_ in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for     the Lord a people prepared _for him_. 18 And Zacharias said unto     the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my     wife well stricken in years. 19 And the angel answering said unto     him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was     sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. 20     And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the     day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst     not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. 21 And the     people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he     tarried in the temple. 22 And when he came out, he could not speak     unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the     temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained     dumb. 23 And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration     were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.       24 And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid     herself five months, saying, 25 Thus hath the Lord done unto me in     the days wherein he looked upon _me_, to take away my reproach     among men.   Luke is the gospel of gladness, of praise, and of prayer, of tender, human interest, and of heavenly grace. It is fitting, therefore, that the narrative should open with a scene in the Temple at the hour of incense and with a divine promise which fills a heart with rapturous joy. This promise concerns the birth of one who is to prepare the way for the ministry of Christ, and this ministry forms the sum and substance of the gospel story.  The time was “in the days of Herod,” called “the Great,” a monster of cruelty, a vassal of Rome, who ruled the Jews with savage tyranny. The political slavery of the people was only less pitiful than their spiritual decline, for religion had become an empty form, a mere system of ceremonies and rites. However, God is never without his witnesses and his true worshipers. Among these were “a certain priest named Zacharias” and his wife Elisabeth, who lived in the hill country of Judea, south of Jerusalem. They “were both righteous before God,” not sinless but without reproach, carefully observing the moral and also the ritual requirements of the law. Yet godliness is no guarantee against sorrow or against the disappointment of human hopes, and these pious souls were saddened because their home was childless. This trial was peculiarly great among a people who regarded childlessness as a sign of divine displeasure and it was even more distressing to the hearts of the faithful who were yearning for the birth of the promised Messiah.  Twice each year Zacharias went to Jerusalem to perform for a week his sacred tasks. Finally there came to him a privilege which a priest could enjoy only once in his lifetime; the “lot” fell upon him, and he thus was chosen to enter the Holy Place at the hour of prayer and there offer incense upon the golden altar just before the veil in the very presence of God. It was the supreme hour of his life. As the cloud of perfume began to rise, true symbol of accepted petitions, an angel appeared and assured the startled priest that his supplications had been heard. For what had Zacharias then been praying—for a son, or for the salvation of his people? Were not both desires included in that supplication? As the representative of a nation, the priest hardly could have confined his petition to what was purely personal and private. Yet, as he pleaded for the coming of the Messiah, there must have been in his soul the secret yearning of the long years or the memory of that abandoned hope which he had always associated in thought with the salvation of Israel. Many a minister of Christ has a similar experience; in the very performance of his public tasks there rests on his soul the conscious shadow of some private grief.  The angel declared that the prayer for national salvation had been heard, and he gradually unfolded the contents of the divine answer; the Messiah was about to appear, and his coming was to be heralded by a son who was to be born to the aged priest. The angel spoke with great definiteness: the child would be named John; many would rejoice at his birth; he would be a Nazirite, and as such would take the vow of total abstinence from wine and of complete dedication to God; as a consequence of this dedication he would be filled with the divine Spirit and thus enabled to lead his people to repentance. He would labor in the spirit and power of Elijah, calling men to lives of natural affection and justice and preparing them for the salvation which Christ would bring.  So surprising a message was too great to be credited at once by the wondering priest. He had ceased to hope that the longing of his heart could be fulfilled. He therefore asked for a sign by which he might be assured that the blessed promise was true. The angel replied with a statement of his own majestic power and the glory of his mission and he granted to Zacharias a sign. This sign was at once a rebuke and a blessing. It rebuked the unbelief of the aged priest, yet it strengthened his faith. He was smitten with dumbness which was to continue until the promise of the angel had been realized. Zacharias would not accept the word of the Lord; he would not praise him for his goodness and his grace. Therefore, his tongue was to be silent and he was to be unable to speak until at last his lips were opened in glad thanksgiving. Unbelief is never joyous; infidelity has no songs.  However, the sign suggests supernatural power. The faith of Zacharias and also of Elisabeth will be strengthened by the very silence in their home. So when the people in the court of the Temple waited for the priest to reappear, when as he came they still waited for the usual benediction, when they found that Zacharias had been stricken with dumbness, they concluded he had seen a vision in the Temple, and he himself was assured that the messenger had come from God. In due time the promise was fulfilled; a new life came into being. Meanwhile, until it would be evident that her “reproach” for childlessness had been taken away, Elisabeth lived in strict retirement. She would not have others, by seeing her, think that she was under divine displeasure at the very time when she secretly knew that she was a special recipient of divine grace. She was jealous for the glory of her God; she delighted in her hidden fellowship with him. From the homes of such priests who can pray, and of such hearts which can trust, there ever have been coming the great prophets of the Lord.     B. The Annunciation To Mary. Ch. 1:26-38       26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto     a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a     man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s     name was Mary. 28 And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou     that art highly favored, the Lord _is_ with thee. 29 But she was     greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner     of salutation this might be. 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear     not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. 31 And behold, thou     shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call     his name JESUS. 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son     of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne     of his father David: 33 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob     for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 34 And Mary     said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?     35 And"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26881"],["title","The Gospel of Luke, An Exposition (#3)"],["body"," angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall     come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow     thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be     called the Son of God. 36 And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she     also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth     month with her that was called barren. 37 For no word from God     shall be void of power. 38 And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of     the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel     departed from her.   The prediction to Mary of the birth of Jesus is recorded by Luke with marked dignity, delicacy, and reserve. It is an important record. This prediction is the crown of all prophecy and it reveals the supreme mystery of the Christian faith, namely, the nature of our Lord, at once human and divine.  The same angelic being who had spoken to Zacharias speaks again, not now to an aged and distinguished priest amidst the splendors of the Temple in Jerusalem, but to a humble maiden betrothed to a carpenter in an obscure village of Galilee. The angelic salutation, “Hail, thou that art highly favored,” has been translated less accurately, “Hail, thou that art full of grace,” and it has been misinterpreted to encourage the practice of praying to the virgin as divine. It does not mean, however, that Mary was to be a source but rather a recipient of grace; upon her God was bestowing peculiar favor. She may rightly be regarded as the most blessed among women; but only a woman still.  Mary had been startled by so strange an appearance and greeting; now she was further amazed by the announcement, “Thou shalt ... bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.” Before her marriage she was to become a mother, and she was to call her child by that significant name which signifies “Saviour” or “God is Saviour.” “He shall be great,” continued the angel, both in his person, as “the Son of the Most High,” and in his royal power, for “the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David.” This throne of David does not refer to the Christian Church or to merely heavenly or spiritual influence. It is a rule on earth which here is promised, yet it is not to be limited to one nation nor is it to be confined to one age. It is the Kingdom of the Messiah, which is to bring joy to “the house of Jacob for ever” and also to all the nations of the world—“and of his kingdom there shall be no end.”  The exclamation of Mary expressed astonishment but not unbelief: “How shall this be?” Then came the answer which is unsurpassed as a clear and sublime statement of the incarnation, “The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee;” the creative power of God was to rest upon Mary as the cloud of glory had rested upon the tabernacle of Israel and as a result the child who would be born should be in reality, and should be called, “the Son of God.” Of the truth of his promise the angel added a sign and proof in the surprising fact that Elisabeth, the aged kinswoman of Mary, was soon to be blessed with a son. This was in fulfillment of a promise made by the same angel messenger, and the marvel in the case of Elisabeth would assure Mary of the certain accomplishment of the gracious and more surprising promise to her. The reply of Mary is probably unequaled in all history as an expression of perfect faith, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.” Thus she revealed belief in the word of God and submission to the will of God. There was no doubt in her mind as to the truth of the divine promise with all that it suggested of miracle and of mystery; and there was no shrinking on her part from all that the fulfillment of this promise possibly might involve of suspicion and shame and reproach and suffering and even death. Those who believe most firmly in the promises of God, submit most patiently to his providences; they see the glory which surely will succeed the gloom. Mary was to become the mother of the Messiah, of the Son of Man, of the Saviour of the world.     C. The “Magnificat.” Ch. 1:39-56       39 And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country     with haste, into a city of Judah; 40 and entered into the house of     Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth. 41 And it came to pass, when     Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her     womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; 42 and she     lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed _art_ thou     among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. 43 And whence     is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me?       44 For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine     ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 45 And blessed is she     that believeth; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things     which have been spoken to her from the Lord. 46 And Mary said,      My soul doth magnify the Lord,     47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.     48 For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid:       For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me                   blessed.     49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;       And holy is his name.     50 And his mercy is unto generations and generations       On them that fear him.     51 He hath showed strength with his arm;       He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.     52 He hath put down princes from _their_ thrones,       And hath exalted them of low degree.     53 The hungry he hath filled with good things;       And the rich he hath sent empty away.     54 He hath given help to Israel his servant,       That he might remember mercy     55 (As he spake unto our fathers)       Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.       56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto     her house.   The Magnificat, the lovely lyric which comes from the lips of Mary, has been sung during many centuries as one of the chief canticles of the Christian Church. Its occasion was a visit paid to her kinswoman, Elisabeth, by Mary shortly after she had received the promise of the birth of a son. Elisabeth on hearing the salutation of Mary addressed her in high spiritual ecstasy, declaring her supremely blessed among women because of the Son to be born, and wondering at her own honor in being thus visited by the mother of her Lord, by which phrase she means the mother of the Messiah; it is to be noted that the Bible does not contain the phrase “Mother of God.” Elisabeth congratulated Mary upon her faith and assured her that the promise upon which Mary relied was certain to be fulfilled.  The name of the song which Mary then sang, the Magnificat, has come from the first line in its Latin form, _Magnificat anima mea Dominum_. The model is that of the ancient hymn sung by Hannah when her heart, like that of Mary, was rejoicing in the promised gift of a son. The verses form a perfect mosaic of Old Testament quotations. The hymn was not addressed to Elisabeth or to the Lord; it is rather a meditation upon the mercy and grace of God.  According to the common division the song is composed of four stanzas of four lines each, except the third stanza which contains six lines. The general movement of thought seems to be from the goodness of God to Mary as an individual, to his consequent kindness to Israel as a nation.  The first stanza, or strophe, vs. 46-48, illustrates, as do those which follow, one of the chief features of Hebrew poetry, namely, the expression, in successive lines, of thoughts which are parallel or closely related. In her “soul” or “spirit” or innermost being, Mary praises or magnifies the Lord and rejoices in him as her Saviour. This salvation is not only for her people, but particularly for herself; it is not only political but also spiritual. It is to be wrought out by the gift God is granting to Mary. He has chosen her, an obscure village maiden betrothed to a poor carpenter, and has bestowed upon her such honor that all future generations will call her “blessed.” While realizing the honor she dwells most upon her unworthiness while recognizing what it may cost her, she declares her submission as a true “bondmaid” or slave of the Lord. Humility and faith could hardly be more sublime.  The second stanza, vs. 49, 50, centers the thought upon the character of God as revealed in his gracious gift. His power, his holiness, his mercy are praised. In his goodness to Mary he had shown his divine power, yet in accordance with the moral perfection of his revealed nature and in order to bring blessings to countless generations who would trust and reverence him.  In the third stanza, vs. 51-53, is an illustration of another feature of Hebrew poetry; not only is there striking parallelism, but here past tenses are used to describe future events; the results of the coming of the Messiah are stated as though already achieved. In contrast with the blessedness of those that fear the Lord, “the proud,” the rebellious, and unbelieving are pictured as “scattered” like the hosts of a defeated army; the oppressed are exalted while tyrants are dethroned; the hungry are filled and the rich are sent away “empty.” These results are to be regarded as spiritual as well as physical. Such reversals are certain to occur where Christ is accepted and those who receive blessings from him are the humble who are conscious of their need.  The last strophe, vs. 54, 55, emphasizes the faithfulness of God to his ancient promises which Mary sees fulfilled in the birth of her Son. In this saving help given to Israel, God is showing that he has not forgotten the mercy “toward Abraham and his seed” promised to the “fathers” of old. Only in Christ Jesus can be realized all the promises to Israel, all the hopes of the ages.     D. The Birth of John, and the “Benedictus.” Ch. 1:57-80       57 Now Elisabeth’s time"]]]
