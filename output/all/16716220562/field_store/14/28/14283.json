It has been said that the boyhood of Jesus is like a walled garden from which we have been given but a single flower, but this is so fragrant as to fill our hearts with a longing to enter within the secret inclosure. We have but a single incident of his boyhood days; it is recorded for us only by Luke, a visit to Jerusalem paid by Jesus when he was twelve years old. At about this age a young Jew became a “son of the law” and began to observe its requirements, among which were the pilgrimages to the holy city to observe the sacred feasts. On this first visit to Jerusalem, Jesus was unintentionally left behind by his parents as they started on their return journey to Nazareth. At the end of the first day they failed to find him in the long caravan which was moving northward toward Galilee. The day following, Mary and Joseph returned to Jerusalem, and on the third day they discovered Jesus in the Temple in the midst of the teachers who were surprised at his knowledge of the sacred Scriptures. There was an implied rebuke in the words of Mary, “Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing?” In the reply of Jesus there was something of surprise and also of reproof, yet there were deep undertones of love, of spiritual vision, and of solemn resolve: “How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?”  These are the first recorded words of Jesus and they are an index and an explanation of his entire career; for their preservation this story was recorded by Luke. If they contained a rebuke for Mary, it must have been conveyed in accents of reverence and affection; and was there not involved a delicate compliment? Jesus does not reprove his parents for seeking him, but for not seeking him in the Temple first of all; and does he not seem to have implied that his parents had taught him to love the house of God and to delight in the law of God? He was saying in effect: “Why thus did you seek me? Why did you not remember that the Temple is the very place where I should be found?”  These words are thus a revelation of the life in the home at Nazareth. It was not by a miracle or due to some divine attribute, but because of the training he had received from his pious parents, that Jesus at the age of twelve was a master of the Scriptures, and had learned to reverence and adore all that was related to them and to the worship of God. Is it not possible for parents to-day to awaken in the hearts of their children a love for the house and the Word and the will of God?  These words, further, were a revelation of the consciousness of divine sonship. Jesus already realized that in a unique sense God was his own Father, the true source of his being. He instantly corrected the words of Mary, “thy father,” which referred to Joseph, with his own words “my Father,” which referred to God. Luke depicts Jesus as the ideal Man, but always as one conscious that he was the Son of God.  Our children should learn to regard God as their Father, not in the unique sense employed by Jesus as the eternal Son, nor yet in the sense which can apply to all created beings, but as denoting that intimate relationship with God made possible for believers through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Most important of all, these words are the revelation of a firm resolve, of a great molding purpose; Jesus perceived that it was his duty to be in the house of his Father—not merely in the literal Temple, but in the sphere of life and activity of which the Temple was the great expression and symbol and sign. He had determined, that is, to devote all his thoughts and energies and powers to the definite service of God. At the age of twelve are not most children sufficiently mature to form a somewhat similar purpose and to recognize in the service of God the supreme and comprehensive duty of every life?  With this definite ideal in mind Jesus returned to Nazareth and continued to live in submission to his parents, toiling for eighteen years as a carpenter and in the quiet retirement of an obscure village receiving a training for his public career which would have been impossible amidst the formalism and the distractions of Jerusalem. His development was as natural as it was perfect; he “advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men;” his bodily and mental growth were no more marked than his increasing charm and spiritual power. Such development is possible in the humblest sphere for those whose lives are yielded to the will of God.      III. THE PREPARATION. CHS. 3:1 TO 4:13     A. The Preaching Of John. Ch. 3:1-20       1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar,     Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and Herod being tetrarch     of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of     Ituræa and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 2 in the     high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto     John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 3 And he came into     all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of     repentance unto remission of sins; 4 as it is written in the book     of the words of Isaiah the prophet,        The voice of one crying in the wilderness,       Make ye ready the way of the Lord,       Make his paths straight.     5 Every valley shall be filled,       And every mountain and hill shall be brought low;       And the crooked shall become straight,       And the rough ways smooth;     6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.       7 He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized     of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the     wrath to come? 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of     repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have     Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of     these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 9 And even now the     axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that     bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the     fire. 10 And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we     do? 11 And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats,     let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let     him do likewise. 12 And there came also publicans to be baptized,     and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do? 13 And he said     unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you. 14 And     soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he     said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse     _any one_ wrongfully; and be content with your wages.       15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in     their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ; 16     John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with     water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of     whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in     the Holy Spirit and _in_ fire: 17 whose fan is in his hand,     thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat     into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable     fire.       18 With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings     unto the people; 19 but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him     for Herodias his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which     Herod had done, 20 added this also to them all, that he shut up     John in prison.   John the Baptist was the first inspired prophet to break the silence of the centuries which had elapsed since the days of Malachi. The importance of his ministry is indicated by Luke in the minute exactness with which he fixes its date. By naming the civil and religious rulers he gives a sixfold designation of the time; then, too, it accords with the universal aspect of his Gospel, and with the genius of Luke as a historian, to link his story with secular events. Naturally he mentions first the reigning emperor, Tiberius Cæsar; he next names Pilate, the governor of Judea who attained an immortality of shame for condemning Jesus to the cross; Herod Antipas, a seducer and murderer, son of Herod the Great, is designated as ruler of Galilee; Philip and Lysanias are said to be governing neighboring provinces; as ecclesiastical rulers, Annas and Caiaphas are mentioned; while the former had been deposed some years before, he continued to share with his son-in-law the actual duties of the high priesthood, and he also shared the infamy in which their names are united. Such a list of leading spirits indicates the absolute moral and religious degeneracy of the times and the need of some one to call Israel back to the service and worship of God.  Such a messenger appeared in the person of John the Baptist who after his long discipline in the wilderness came with a definite message from God and drew out great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26881"],["title","The Gospel of Luke, An Exposition (#7)"],["body","to the Jordan Valley to attend his preaching and to accept his baptism as a sign and seal of their repentance. The nature of his ministry is declared to have been a fulfillment of the prediction of Isaiah who described “one crying in the wilderness,” one sent of God to prepare the way for the coming of Christ. This preparation is pictured in terms of Oriental imagery. When a monarch was about to make a journey, a servant was sent before him to prepare the highway. Valleys needed to be filled, hills lowered, crooked places made straight, rough ways made smooth. Thus, before men would be ready to receive Christ, moral obstacles must be removed; men must repent of their sins and turn from them. Luke closes his quotation from Isaiah with the line, “And all flesh shall see the salvation of God,” which is in accord with the universal character of his Gospel.  The burden of the message preached by John was that which in all ages has awakened a response in the hearts of men: he preached sin and judgment, repentance and pardon. The tone of his message as recorded by Luke, however, was particularly severe; here he is said to have addressed the multitudes as the “offspring of vipers” and to have asked them why they were pretending to have heard a warning of wrath to come. The reason for such severity was that, while wishing to escape the impending judgment, the people were unwilling to forsake their sins. They regarded the baptism of John as a magical rite which could make impenitent men safe in the hour of judgment. John bade them show their repentance by their works and not to trust in their descent from Abraham as securing their salvation. He declared that judgment was upon them; the ax was already lying at the root of the trees and every fruitless tree was about to be “hewn down, and cast into the fire.”  To the question of the people John made it perfectly plain that by repentance he meant no mere form or ceremony, nor was the word merely an abstract theological term; the thing he demanded was plain and practical, that each man should turn from his besetting sin and should show love to his fellow man. Clothing and food were to be given to those in need, for repentance meant to turn from the sin of selfishness. Publicans or taxgatherers, who were everywhere detested because of their dishonesty and greed, were told to demand no more tribute than was appointed and lawful. Soldiers, or more exactly “men on military service,” possibly acting as local police, were told to extort no money by violence and to seek for none by false charges, and to be content with their wages. All who are to receive Christ in any age must turn from their sins. Repentance is not a mystical experience; it is plain and simple and practical. It consists in turning from greed and dishonesty and unkindness and violence and discontent, and from all that is contrary to the revealed will of God.  The coming of Christ was very definitely predicted by John. While some imagined that the prophet himself was the Messiah, John declared that the mission of Christ was so much greater than his own that he would be unworthy as a slave, to loose the latchet of his shoes. While John baptized with water, Christ would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. Water was a material element, and merely symbolized an inward change; Jesus would bring them into fellowship with a divine Person, and would exert upon their souls cleansing and transforming power. He would come, however, to punish the impenitent; he would separate the wheat from the chaff; the former he would gather into his garner, but the chaff he would burn with unquenchable fire.  The close of the career of John is introduced by Luke at this point of his narrative to prepare the way for his account of the ministry of Christ. It was actually some time after Jesus had begun his work that Herod the tetrarch arrested John and cast him into prison because he had rebuked the profligate king for his impurity and his sin. John had been a faithful messenger of God, but the world does not reverence its prophets; they are usually imprisoned, beheaded, burned, or crucified.     B. The Baptism Of Jesus. Ch. 3:21, 22       21 Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that,     Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was     opened, 22 and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form, as a     dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my     beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.   Why did the ideal Man, the Son of God, submit to the baptism of John, a baptism of repentance? Surely not to confess any sin of his own; but first of all to set his seal of approval upon the work of John and to attest the message which declared that repentance and confession of sin are absolutely necessary for all who are to share the salvation of Christ.  Then again by his baptism Jesus identified himself with his people, not as being sinful, but as doing what they were commanded to do and as sympathizing with them in their hatred of sin, in their distress for its burden, and in their hope and expectation of relief. Only those who sympathize can serve and save.  Then again baptism indicated that the penitent had broken with the past to begin a life of new holiness and obedience. So in his baptism Jesus was ending his quiet years of preparation in Nazareth and was about to enter upon the ministry of service and sacrifice which was to be performed in obedience to the will of his Father. It is for this reason that Luke, with the art of a skilled historian, first completed the story of John, the great forerunner, before mentioning that which in reality was the supreme incident in the career of John—his baptism of Jesus. That incident introduced Jesus to his public ministry and that ministry was to form the very substance of the gospel.  That the incident is merely introductory to his narrative, is evident also from the way in which Luke records the baptism. He does not describe the event. He merely mentions it to designate the time when Jesus saw the descending Spirit and heard the voice from heaven. The former was a symbolic indication of the power by which the work of Jesus was to be performed; the latter was a declaration that he was the Christ, upon whom rested the approval of God.  We are not to suppose that Jesus before had lacked the presence of the Holy Spirit, nor that he now assumed any new relation to his Father, but, as in baptism he had yielded himself to his appointed service, so now he was empowered for his task; as in humility he had identified himself with the sons of men, so now he was assured anew that he was the Son of God; as he had shown his sympathy with penitent sinners, he now was declared to be the sinless One in whom God was well pleased.  Thus with the followers of Christ, while all enjoy the abiding presence of his Spirit, yet, as they yield themselves anew to his service, they are filled anew with his power, they are strengthened for their tasks, and are cheered by a new assurance of their sonship and their acceptance with God. Luke alone mentions that this experience came when Jesus was in prayer. He realized that it was a time of crisis. Prayer is usually the condition of those heavenly visions and spiritual experiences which prepare us for our tasks in life.     C. The Genealogy Of Jesus. Ch. 3:23-38       23 And Jesus himself, when he began _to teach_, was about thirty     years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the _son_     of Heli, 24 the _son_ of Matthat, the _son_ of Levi, the _son_ of     Melchi, the _son_ of Jannai, the _son_ of Joseph, 25 the _son_ of     Mattathias, the _son_ of Amos, the _son_ of Nahum, the _son_ of     Esli, the _son_ of Naggai, 26 the _son_ of Maath, the _son_ of     Mattathias, the _son_ of Semein, the _son_ of Josech, the _son_ of     Joda, 27 the _son_ of Joanan, the _son_ of Rhesa, the _son_ of     Zerubbabel, the _son_ of Shealtiel, the _son_ of Neri, 28 the     _son_ of Melchi, the _son_ of Addi, the _son_ of Cosam, the _son_     of Elmadam, the _son_ of Er, 29 the _son_ of Jesus, the _son_ of     Eliezer, the _son_ of Jorim, the _son_ of Matthat, the _son_ of     Levi, 30 the _son_ of Symeon, the _son_ of Judas, the _son_ of     Joseph, the _son_ of Jonam, the _son_ of Eliakim, 31 the _son_ of     Melea, the _son_ of Menna, the _son_ of Mattatha, the _son_ of     Nathan, the _son_ of David, 32 the _son_ of Jesse, the _son_ of     Obed, the _son_ of Boaz, the _son_ of Salmon, the _son_ of     Nahshon, 33 the _son_ of Amminadab, the _son_ of Arni, the _son_     of Hezron, the _son_ of Perez, the _son_ of Judah, 34 the _son_ of     Jacob, the _son_ of Isaac, the _son_ of Abraham, the _son_ of     Terah, the _son_ of Nahor, 35 the _son_ of Serug, the _son_ of     Reu, the _son_ of Peleg, the _son_ of Eber, the _son_ of Shelah,     36 the _son_ of Cainan, the _son_ of Arphaxad, the _son_ of Shem,     the _son_ of Noah, the _son_ of Lamech, 37 the _son_ of     Methuselah, the _son_ of Enoch, the _son_ of Jared, the _son_ of     Mahalaleel, the _son_ of Cainan, 38 the _son_ of Enos, the _son_     of Seth, the _son_ of Adam, the _son_ of God.   The genealogy of Jesus given by Luke contains marked differences from that recorded by Matthew. Possibly some of these differences can be explained and may be found of real significance.  1. First of all, the genealogy is found in a different part of the Gospel. In Matthew it opens the story; in Luke it closes the third chapter. This is of course by no mere chance. The purpose of Matthew is to prove that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, who, as the King of Israel, fulfills all the Old Testament prophecies. It is of the utmost importance that Jesus should be shown to be the Son of David and of Abraham and that the official genealogy containing this record should open the story and even precede the account of the nativity.  Luke, however, has given the significant account of"]]]
