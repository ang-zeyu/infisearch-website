They have little reason to regret their inability to make gold, whilst, by their innumerable inventions and discoveries, they have so greatly stimulated industry and facilitated labour, as prodigiously to increase the luxuries as well as the necessaries of life.  EMILY.  But, I do not understand by what means chemistry can facilitate labour; is not that rather the province of the mechanic?  MRS. B.  There are many ways by which labour may be rendered more easy, independently of mechanics; but even the machine, the most wonderful in its effects, the Steam-engine, cannot be understood without the assistance of chemistry. In agriculture, a chemical knowledge of the nature of soils, and of vegetation, is highly useful; and, in those arts which relate to the comforts and conveniences of life, it would be endless to enumerate the advantages which result from the study of this science.  CAROLINE.  But, pray, tell us more precisely in what manner the discoveries of chemists have proved so beneficial to society?  MRS. B.  That would be an injudicious anticipation; for you would not comprehend the nature of such discoveries and useful applications, as well as you will do hereafter. Without a due regard to method, we cannot expect to make any progress in chemistry. I wish to direct your observations chiefly to the chemical operations of Nature; but those of Art are certainly of too high importance to pass unnoticed. We shall therefore allow them also some share of our attention.  EMILY.  Well, then, let us now set to work regularly. I am very anxious to begin.  MRS. B.  The object of chemistry is to obtain a knowledge of the intimate nature of bodies, and of their mutual action on each other. You find therefore, Caroline, that this is no narrow or confined science, which comprehends every thing material within our sphere.  CAROLINE.  On the contrary, it must be inexhaustible; and I am a loss to conceive how any proficiency can be made in a science whose objects are so numerous.  MRS. B.  If every individual substance were formed of different materials, the study of chemistry would, indeed, be endless; but you must observe that the various bodies in nature are composed of certain elementary principles, which are not very numerous.  CAROLINE.  Yes; I know that all bodies are composed of fire, air, earth, and water; I learnt that many years ago.  MRS. B.  But you must now endeavour to forget it. I have already informed you what a great change chemistry has undergone since it has become a regular science. Within these thirty years especially, it has experienced an entire revolution, and it is now proved, that neither fire, air, earth, nor water, can be called elementary bodies. For an elementary body is one that has never been decomposed, that is to say, separated into other substances; and fire, air, earth, and water, are all of them susceptible of decomposition.  EMILY.  I thought that decomposing a body was dividing it into its minutest parts. And if so, I do not understand why an elementary substance is not capable of being decomposed, as well as any other.  MRS. B.  You have misconceived the idea of _decomposition_; it is very different from mere _division_. The latter simply reduces a body into parts, but the former separates it into the various ingredients, or materials, of which it is composed. If we were to take a loaf of bread, and separate the several ingredients of which it is made, the flour, the yeast, the salt, and the water, it would be very different from cutting or crumbling the loaf into pieces.  EMILY.  I understand you now very well. To decompose a body is to separate from each other the various elementary substances of which it consists.  CAROLINE.  But flour, water, and other materials of bread, according to our definition, are not elementary substances?  MRS. B.  No, my dear; I mentioned bread rather as a familiar comparison, to illustrate the idea, than as an example.  The elementary substances of which a body is composed are called the _constituent_ parts of that body; in decomposing it, therefore, we separate its constituent parts. If, on the contrary, we divide a body by chopping it to pieces, or even by grinding or pounding it to the finest powder, each of these small particles will still consist of a portion of the several constituent parts of the whole body: these are called the _integrant_ parts; do you understand the difference?  EMILY.  Yes, I think, perfectly. We _decompose_ a body into its _constituent_ parts; and _divide_ it into its _integrant_ parts.  MRS. B.  Exactly so. If therefore a body consists of only one kind of substance, though it may be divided into its integrant parts, it is not possible to decompose it. Such bodies are therefore called _simple_ or _elementary_, as they are the elements of which all other bodies are composed. _Compound bodies_ are such as consist of more than one of these elementary principles.  CAROLINE.  But do not fire, air, earth, and water, consist, each of them, but of one kind of substance?  MRS. B.  No, my dear; they are every one of them susceptible of being separated into various simple bodies. Instead of four, chemists now reckon upwards of forty elementary substances. The existence of most of these is established by the clearest experiments; but, in regard to a few of them, particularly the most subtle agents of nature, _heat_, _light_, and _electricity_, there is yet much uncertainty, and I can only give you the opinion which seems most probably deduced from the latest discoveries. After I have given you a list of the elementary bodies, classed according to their properties, we shall proceed to examine each of them separately, and then consider them in their combinations with each other.  Excepting the more general agents of nature, heat, light, and electricity, it would seem that the simple form of bodies is that of a metal.  CAROLINE.  You astonish me! I thought the metals were only one class of minerals, and that there were besides, earths, stones, rocks, acids, alkalies, vapours, fluids, and the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.  MRS. B.  You have made a tolerably good enumeration, though I fear not arranged in the most scientific order. All these bodies, however, it is now strongly believed, may be ultimately resolved into metallic substances. Your surprise at this circumstance is not singular, as the decomposition of some of them, which has been but lately accomplished, has excited the wonder of the whole philosophical world.  But to return to the list of simple bodies--these being usually found in combination with oxygen, I shall class them according to their properties when so combined. This will, I think, facilitate their future investigation.  EMILY.  Pray what is oxygen?  MRS. B.  A simple body; at least one that is supposed to be so, as it has never been decomposed. It is always found united with the negative electricity. It will be one of the first of the elementary bodies whose properties I shall explain to you, and, as you will soon perceive, it is one of the most important in nature; but it would be irrelevant to enter upon this subject at present. We must now confine our attention to the enumeration and classification of the simple bodies in general. They may be arranged as follows:  CLASS I.  _Comprehending the imponderable agents, viz._    HEAT or CALORIC,   LIGHT,   ELECTRICITY.  CLASS II.  _Comprehending agents capable of uniting with inflammable bodies, and in most instances of effecting their combustion._    OXYGEN,   CHLORINE,   IODINE.*      [Footnote *: It has been questioned by some eminent chemists,     whether these two last agents should not be classed among the     inflammable bodies, as they are capable of combining with oxygen,     as well as with inflammable bodies. But they seem to be more     distinctly characterised by their property of supporting     combustion than by any other quality.]  CLASS III.  _Comprehending bodies capable of uniting with oxygen, and, forming with it various compounds. This class may be divided as follows:_  DIVISION 1.    HYDROGEN, _forming_ water.  DIVISION 2.  _Bodies forming acids._    NITROGEN,    _forming_ nitric acid.   SULPHUR,     _forming_ sulphuric acid.   PHOSPHORUS,  _forming_ phosphoric acid.   CARBON,      _forming_ carbonic acid.   BORACIUM,    _forming_ boracic acid.   FLUORIUM,    _forming_ fluoric acid.   MURIATIUM,   _forming_ muriatic acid.  DIVISION 3.  _Metallic bodies forming alkalies._    POTASSIUM,  _forming_ potash.   SODIUM,     _forming_ soda.   AMMONIUM,   _forming_ ammonia.  DIVISION 4.  _Metallic bodies forming earths._    CALCIUM, _or metal forming_ lime.   MAGNIUM,    _forming_ magnesia.   BARIUM,     _forming_ barytes.   STRONTIUM,  _forming_ strontites.   SILICIUM,   _forming_ silex.   ALUMIUM,    _forming_ alumine.   YTTRIUM,    _forming_ yttria.   GLUCIUM,    _forming_ glucina.   ZIRCONIUM,  _forming_ zirconi.*      [Footnote *: Of all these earths, three or four only have as yet     been distinctly decomposed.]  DIVISION 5.  _Metals, either naturally metallic, or yielding their oxygen to carbon or to heat alone._  _Subdivision 1._  _Malleable Metals._    GOLD,   PLATINA,   PALLADIUM,   SILVER*   MERCURY†   TIN,   COPPER,   IRON,   LEAD,   NICKEL,   ZINC.      [Footnote *: These first four metals have commonly been     distinguished by the appellation of perfect or noble metals, on     account of their possessing the characteristic properties of     ductility, malleability, inalterability, and great specific     gravity, in an eminent degree.]      [Footnote †: Mercury, in its liquid state, cannot, of course,     be called a malleable metal. But when frozen, it possesses a     considerable degree of malleability.]  _Subdiv. 2._"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],["title","Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#4)"],["body","Metals._    ARSENIC,   BISMUTH,   ANTIMONY,   MANGANESE,   TELLURIUM,   COBALT,   TUNGSTEN,   MOLYBDENUM,   TITANIUM,   CHROME,   URANIUM,   COLUMBIUM _or_ TANTALIUM,   IRIDIUM,   OSMIUM,   RHODIUM.*      [Footnote *: These last four or five metallic bodies are placed     under this class for the sake of arrangement, though some of their     properties have not been yet fully investigated.]  CAROLINE.  Oh, what a formidable list! You will have much to do to explain it, Mrs. B.; for I assure you it is perfectly unintelligible to me, and I think rather perplexes than assists me.  MRS. B.  Do not let that alarm you, my dear; I hope that hereafter this classification will appear quite clear, and, so far from perplexing you, will assist you in arranging your ideas. It would be in vain to attempt forming a division that would appear perfectly clear to a beginner: for you may easily conceive that a chemical division being necessarily founded on properties with which you are almost wholly unacquainted, it is impossible that you should at once be able to understand its meaning or appreciate its utility.  But, before we proceed further, it will be necessary to give you some idea of chemical attraction, a power on which the whole science depends.  _Chemical Attraction_, or the _Attraction of Composition_, consists in the peculiar tendency which bodies of a different nature have to unite with each other. It is by this force that all the compositions, and decompositions, are effected.  EMILY.  What is the difference between chemical attraction, and the attraction of cohesion, or of aggregation, which you often mentioned to us, in former conversations?  MRS. B.  The attraction of cohesion exists only between particles of the _same_ nature, whether simple or compound; thus it unites the particles of a piece of metal which is a simple substance, and likewise the particles of a loaf of bread which is a compound. The attraction of composition, on the contrary, unites and maintains, in a state of combination, particles of a _dissimilar_ nature; it is this power that forms each of the compound particles of which bread consists; and it is by the attraction of cohesion that all these particles are connected into a single mass.  EMILY.  The attraction of cohesion, then, is the power which unites the integrant particles of a body: the attraction of composition that which combines the constituent particles. Is it not so?  MRS. B.  Precisely: and observe that the attraction of cohesion unites particles of a similar nature, without changing their original properties; the result of such an union, therefore, is a body of the same kind as the particles of which it is formed; whilst the attraction of composition, by combining particles of a dissimilar nature, produces compound bodies, quite different from any of their constituents. If, for instance, I pour on the piece of copper, contained in this glass, some of this liquid (which is called nitric acid), for which it has a strong attraction, every particle of the copper will combine with a particle of acid, and together they will form a new body, totally different from either the copper or the acid.  Do you observe the internal commotion that already begins to take place? It is produced by the combination of these two substances; and yet the acid has in this case to overcome not only the resistance which the strong cohesion of the particles of copper opposes to their combination with it, but also to overcome the weight of the copper, which makes it sink to the bottom of the glass, and prevents the acid from having such free access to it as it would if the metal were suspended in the liquid.  EMILY.  The acid seems, however, to overcome both these obstacles without difficulty, and appears to be very rapidly dissolving the copper.  MRS. B.  By this means it reduces the copper into more minute parts than could possibly be done by any mechanical power. But as the acid can act only on the surface of the metal, it will be some time before the union of these two bodies will be completed.  You may, however, already see how totally different this compound is from either of its ingredients. It is neither colourless, like the acid, nor hard, heavy, and yellow like the copper. If you tasted it, you would no longer perceive the sourness of the acid. It has at present the appearance of a blue liquid; but when the union is completed, and the water with which the acid is diluted is evaporated, the compound will assume the form of regular crystals, of a fine blue colour, and perfectly transparent*. Of these I can shew you a specimen, as I have prepared some for that purpose.      [Footnote *: These crystals are more easily obtained from a     mixture of sulphuric with a little nitric acid.]  CAROLINE.  How very beautiful they are, in colour, form, and transparency!  EMILY.  Nothing can be more striking than this example of chemical attraction.  MRS. B.  The term _attraction_ has been lately introduced into chemistry as a substitute for the word _affinity_, to which some chemists have objected, because it originated in the vague notion that chemical combinations depended upon a certain resemblance, or relationship, between particles that are disposed to unite; and this idea is not only imperfect, but erroneous, as it is generally particles of the most dissimilar nature, that have the greatest tendency to combine.  CAROLINE.  Besides, there seems to be no advantage in using a variety of terms to express the same meaning; on the contrary it creates confusion; and as we are well acquainted with the term Attraction in natural philosophy, we had better adopt it in chemistry likewise.  MRS. B.  If you have a clear idea of the meaning, I shall leave you at liberty to express it in the terms you prefer. For myself, I confess that I think the word Attraction best suited to the general law that unites the integrant particles of bodies; and Affinity better adapted to that which combines the constituent particles, as it may convey an idea of the preference which some bodies have for others, which the term _attraction of composition_ does not so well express.  EMILY.  So I think; for though that preference may not result from any relationship, or similitude, between the particles (as you say was once supposed), yet, as it really exists, it ought to be expressed.  MRS. B.  Well, let it be agreed that you may use the terms _affinity_, _chemical attraction_ and _attraction of composition_, indifferently, provided you recollect that they have all the same meaning.  EMILY.  I do not conceive how bodies can be decomposed by chemical attraction. That this power should be the means of composing them, is very obvious; but that it should, at the same time, produce exactly the contrary effect, appears to me very singular.  MRS. B.  To decompose a body is, you know, to separate its constituent parts, which, as we have just observed, cannot be done by mechanical means.  EMILY.  No: because mechanical means separate only the integrant particles; they act merely against the attraction of cohesion, and only divide a compound into smaller parts.  MRS. B.  The decomposition of a body is performed by chemical powers. If you present to a body composed of two principles, a third, which has a greater affinity for one of them than the two first have for each other, it will be decomposed, that is, its two principles will be separated by means of the third body. Let us call two ingredients, of which the body is composed, A and B. If we present to it another ingredient C, which has a greater affinity for B than that which unites A and B, it necessarily follows that B will quit A to combine with C. The new ingredient, therefore, has effected a decomposition of the original body A B; A has been left alone, and a new compound, B C, has been formed.  EMILY.  We might, I think, use the comparison of two friends, who were very happy in each other’s society, till a third disunited them by the preference which one of them gave to the new-comer.  MRS. B.  Very well. I shall now show you how this takes place in chemistry.  Let us suppose that we wish to decompose the compound we have just formed by the combination of the two ingredients, copper and nitric acid; we may do this by presenting to it a piece of iron, for which the acid has a stronger attraction than for copper; the acid will, consequently, quit the copper to combine with the iron, and the copper will be what the chemists call _precipitated_, that is to say, it will be thrown down in its separate state, and reappear in its simple form.  In order to produce this effect, I shall dip the blade of this knife into the fluid, and, when I take it out, you will observe, that, instead of being wetted with a bluish liquid, like that contained in the glass, it will be covered with a thin coat of copper.  CAROLINE.  So it is really! but then is it not the copper, instead of the acid, that has combined with the iron blade?  MRS. B.  No; you are deceived by appearances: it is the acid which combines with the iron, and, in so doing, deposits or precipitates the copper on the surface of the blade.  EMILY.  But, cannot three or more substances combine together, without any of them being precipitated?  MRS. B.  That is sometimes the case; but, in general, the stronger affinity destroys the weaker; and it seldom happens that the attraction of several substances for each other is so equally balanced as to produce such complicated compounds.  CAROLINE.  But, pray, Mrs. B., what is the cause of the chemical attraction of bodies for each other? It appears to me more extraordinary or unnatural, if I may use the expression, than the attraction of cohesion, which unites particles of a similar nature.  MRS. B.  Chemical attraction may, like that of cohesion or gravitation, be one of the powers inherent in matter which, in our present state of knowledge, admits of no other satisfactory explanation than an"]]]
