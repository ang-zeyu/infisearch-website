Approval has therefore been given for this. As a further assistance to both primary and post-primary schools, three additional school psychologists have been appointed.  (iv) _Housing for Teachers._--The Department has been trying to deal with this problem in two ways:      (_a_) By an extension of existing policy for the erection of     teachers' houses. All Education Boards were consulted as to where     the greatest need for additional houses lay, and, without     exception, they gave highest priority to rural areas and small     towns. The Government is giving consideration to an extension of     policy based on this advice. In 1954, 61 houses were built for     teachers; this year the number is expected to be 84.      (_b_) By the use of the \"pool\" housing scheme administered by     an Inter-departmental Pool Housing Committee. Under this scheme, a     proportion of all new State houses erected is set aside for letting     to State employees and teachers on transfer. The Department of     Education is represented on the Committee that makes the     allocations and represents the needs and interests of the teachers     and the schools. Most of the areas concerned are in housing     settlements.  (v) _Facilities for Recreation._--The use of school grounds and buildings after school hours is entirely in the hands of boards and local committees. The Department has no direct authority in the matter, but does facilitate and encourage such use. Practice varies, but in many schools very great use is made of school facilities for community purposes. The work in this respect will be made more effective by the decision taken at the beginning of 1955 to build halls in all new post-primary and intermediate schools built to the new designs, to re-introduce the £2 for £1 subsidy up to £4,000 for halls in primary schools and to give a pound-for-pound subsidy up to £4,000 on gymnasia in post-primary schools. Approval has just been given, on an experimental basis, for a subsidy on a gymnasium and cafeteria in one intermediate school in Auckland, with the express condition that it be used \"to provide recreational and cultural facilities for young people who have left school\".  The Committee recommends these opinions for the consideration of the Government.   (_f_) Research Into Juvenile Delinquency  The Mazengarb Committee was of opinion that there should be a long-term study of the problem of delinquency. As a matter of fact the present Committee heard evidence on this suggestion from several witnesses, and we were greatly impressed by what we heard. It goes without saying that if one would seek a remedy for a given problem a thorough diagnosis of the problem itself is a fundamental prerequisite. First let us find the facts; let us know what is the nature and extent of the evil; let us get as much data as to its causes and incidence. With that material in hand we should be in a better position to search for useful methods of treatment. This task of fact finding would be a long and arduous one; it would need to be entrusted to experts of wide knowledge and experience. A start has already been made by the setting up of the Inter-Departmental Committee referred to earlier in this report. We strongly recommend the Government to give very favourable consideration to this particular proposal, and we hope that ways and means will be found of giving effect to it. We think that this suggestion is of fundamental importance in any approach to the problem, and we consider it should be given consideration by the Government.  _Instruction for Parents_: In the long run the responsibility for a child's general well-being rests upon the parents. Some can, and do, take every care to discharge that responsibility. Others either fail or neglect to do so. In some cases this failure comes from a lack of the necessary knowledge or from inability to impart it. In one memorandum addressed to the Committee there appear the following paragraphs:      \"I think it highly probable that much delinquency is due to the     fact that parents simply do not know how to teach their children on     a subject that many parents regard as secret between parents. I     think it highly unlikely that a parent will consult an adviser     (say, a doctor) as to how the child should be trained, and I am not     so sure that a doctor would know what advice to tender even if he     was consulted.      \"Instruction of parents seems to be the job of a specialist. The     doctors have prepared several booklets on sex instruction.      \"I am wondering if good attendance could be secured for a series of     lectures by specialists to parents, either to both sexes or to     mothers alone. A mother would probably be more likely to attend a     meeting as one of an audience rather than to suffer the     embarrassment of a personal consultation with, say, a doctor to     whom she has to admit that she does not know how to discharge her     duty to her children.      \"It is generally agreed that much of the cause of child delinquency     is due to unsatisfactory home influence and parental control and     example, but the fact that many of the offenders come from good     homes and fine parents is strong evidence, I feel, that there is     some important deficiency even in those good homes, and it may well     be that that deficiency lies in the fact that the parents do not     really know how to give their children the knowledge that they     should have in the way they should receive it. I am confident that     we have people who could help in this important work. Perhaps women     lecturers would be best.\"  We are of opinion that the views expressed above do merit very serious consideration. We realize the tremendous difficulty we face in trying to reach those who stand most in need of the help that is here referred to. We recognize, however, that all our children must spend a big portion of their young lives in our primary and post-primary schools. It is here that positive and well-planned character training and instruction in moral values can be undertaken with a certainty that the instruction and the training will reach those whom we would wish to help. Do we take full advantage of this opportunity? Do we give enough attention to those inner disciplines that are so essential if a good life is to be enjoyed by our young people? We are satisfied that our teachers as a whole nobly discharge their obligations to our community in this regard. We think, however, that the matters touched upon in this paragraph are within the special province of the Department of Education and its Minister, and it is our recommendation that they should be referred to that Minister for examination and for such positive action as he may consider proper and desirable.  We think also that much more could be done in the homes if the ranks of our visiting teachers, public health nurses, and school psychologists were strengthened considerably, and we strongly recommend that action along these lines should be taken by the Departments of Education and Health.  We are also of opinion that in any effort to reach parents over the widest possible field a very useful agency lies ready to our hands in our Parent-Teacher and Home and School Associations, and it is our hope that this agency might be much more positively used to awaken and maintain a due sense of parental responsibility and a proper understanding of the moral and spiritual needs of children.  With such thoughts in mind, we would recommend that the Director of Education be asked to confer with the appropriate experts to see how far, and under what conditions, suitable courses of lectures could be provided for parents and prospective parents.   The Special Legislation of the 1954 Session  Following upon the presentation of the Mazengarb report the Government immediately took steps to give effect to those recommendations which called for special legislation. Three Bills were introduced, the first dealing with \"indecent publications\", the second dealing with child welfare, and the third with police offences.  In our order of reference we were directed to study these pieces of legislation and to report as to their efficacy and as to whether there were any specific amendments that were necessary or desirable.  In the preparation of this part of our report we have had the advice and much valued assistance of the Department of Justice. We deal here with the question of \"publications\". Our comments as to the Child Welfare Act appear elsewhere in this report. No comment is needed regarding the amendment to the Police Offences Act. First as to _publications of a more or less objectionable character circulating in New Zealand_.  We set out at some length some portions of the report submitted for our consideration by the Minister of Justice, the Hon. Mr Marshall. _Inter alia_, it is said:   I. _Objectionable Publications in General_      \"Our survey of the book trade disclosed that there were three types     of publication to which particular attention should be     given--comics, certain crime stories, and nudist and other     suggestive magazines.      (_a_) _Comics_: \"These are the publications which have attracted     most public attention, both here and overseas, and in particular     the type of comic known as the 'crime' or 'horror' comic has come     in for a great deal of severe criticism. It is true that reading of     a mildly bloodthirsty nature directed at the juvenile market is no     new thing. The comic books of today, however, are not those of a     generation ago, nor are they at all similar to the comic strips now     appearing in the newspapers. Many of them are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#5)"],["body"," of matter which     is brutal, horrifying, and sadistic, and although to a certain     extent they are published for and read by adults of feeble     mentality they are also available to children.      \"The origin of this type of comic is the United States, but other     countries have not been slow to follow suit. Large numbers of     comics are reprinted in England and Australia from American plates.     The interim report of the Kefauver Committee strongly indicts crime     and horror comics and gives some revolting illustrations of their     contents. Reports indicate that comics almost as bad were     circulating in England before the introduction of legislation     there. The nature of crime comics circulating in Canada was     responsible for an Act passed there in 1949 prohibiting such     comics.      \"Even before the passing of last year's Act none of the comics on     sale in New Zealand was as bad as the worst American or English     examples. At the same time some of them were most objectionable.     Since action has been taken here and in Australia the standard of     comics distributed in New Zealand appears to have improved     considerably. That is not to say that they are all free from     objection, and there are a number of crime comics which we do not     think should be allowed to go on circulating. Indeed, we think that     this country can well do without the crime comic altogether.     Recently objection was taken to some forty comics, and we are     waiting advice from the distributors as to their attitude. Later in     this report we shall refer to further proposals for dealing with     comics.      (_b_) _Crime Stories_: \"The second class of publications referred     to comprises publications usually known as 'thrillers'. These books     are quite different from the ordinary detective novel and from the     more traditional type of thriller. Many examples of this new type     of gangster thriller have been flooding the New Zealand market in     the form of paper-backs selling at 2s. 6d. or less. They are     entirely devoid of literary or other merit and are devoted to the     wanton depiction in gross detail of brutality, violence, and sex.      \"These publications and a number of so-called detective magazines     which imitate them may perhaps be regarded as the adolescent     equivalent of the crime comic, and we believe them to be equally     harmful. Action against them will, we think, no more infringe the     principle of freedom of speech than action against narcotics     infringes the principle of free enterprise in the economic sphere.      \"Action against these publications was taken some time ago, and     some of the results of this action have appeared from recent     reports in the press. As an illustration of what has been done we     advised the Associated Booksellers that you considered all the     novels of Mickey Spillane to be indecent and that you were prepared     to prosecute in respect of them. The booksellers agreed with this     opinion and recommended their members not to stock these books. We     think it significant that these books, which were agreed to be     objectionable, were being sold by many reputable booksellers in New     Zealand. This shows how easy it is to offend unwittingly against     the Act.      \"There was a group of even more objectionable publications     published in paper-back form by an English firm, Milestone Ltd. We     advised the police some time ago that we intended to take     proceedings against any one found selling these books. The     Booksellers' Association agreed with this view.      \"There is an enormous output of books and paper-backs of the     detection-thriller type, and it is by no means easy to know where     to draw the line. It should be possible, however, to eliminate the     really harmful and leave the rest.      (_c_) _The Suggestive Magazine_: \"The third class of publications     is the suggestive magazine. Some public concern has been expressed     that a number of suggestive magazines are continuing to circulate     in this country. The truth is, however, that, although the names     are the same, the contents are very different. We have carefully     examined all these magazines, and, although they are not perhaps     very edifying, we are satisfied that at present none of them     clearly infringes the law.      \"Nudist magazines are another matter. Those we have seen appear     unobjectionable if their circulation is restricted to nudists and     persons interested in the nudist cult. They have, however, been     appearing in some newsagents' and tobacconists' shops and openly     displayed in windows, and we consider circulation in this form to     be undesirable. Serious consideration is being given to the     prosecution of any one who displays these magazines or sells them     to the general public.\"   II. _Suggested Amendments to the Law Relating to Indecent Publications._  The Justice Department has given much attention to the question as to the efficacy of the amending Act introduced in 1954. We had the advantage of reading the report presented by the Department to the Minister of Justice, and we set out below certain portions of the report which we as a Committee think worthy of notice. The report says, _inter alia_:      \"(1) We think that the substantive changes made in the special     legislation in 1954 have been beneficial, and we strongly recommend     that they be retained. The Indecent Publications Act 1910, as it     previously stood, dealt with sex and with sex alone, and this is     not sufficient. It is, for instance, doubtful if the Spillane     novels or some of the books in the Milestone series could     successfully be objected to merely on grounds of sex; but they are,     nevertheless, of an immoral and mischievous tendency and should not     be allowed to continue in circulation. They might be described as     'sadistic' in the true psychological sense in that they combine sex     and violence.      \"There has been some suggestion that the Act leaves too vague just     what is indecent and that the word 'indecent' should be defined     with precision. In the nature of things there are, however, very     great difficulties in attempting such a definition. It is     significant that no precise definition of indecency exists either     in the principal Act or so far as we are aware in the legislation     of any other Commonwealth country.      \"The present state of affairs might be dangerous if prosecutions     could be taken on the decision of police officials in any town in     New Zealand. Whatever may be said in theory, however, the fact that     prosecutions can be brought only with the leave of the     Attorney-General is, we think, a sufficient guarantee that the law     will be applied uniformly and reasonably. Moreover, there is a     further safeguard in the right of appeal to the Supreme Court     against all decisions of a Magistrate under the Act.      \"We believe that the bookselling trade is quite happy with the     present substantive law as it is now being administered, and we     firmly hold the opinion that the best course is to leave the     substantive provisions of the 1954 Act largely as they are.      \"(2) The registration provisions are a rather complex way of     achieving their object, which is to enable the Court to put a     seller out of business if he is convicted of an offence against the     Act and if the Court believes his conduct is such as to warrant     this penalty. We think that this object could be achieved by giving     the Court this power directly. It could be provided that on     convicting any one under the Act the Court may make an order     prohibiting him for a certain period from carrying on the business     of selling books or periodicals. The provisions as to registration     could then be repealed.\"  Some members of the present Committee felt that this power should be exercised only in the case of a second or subsequent conviction.      \"(3) The marking requirements of the Act are not well adapted to     their object, and, as we have mentioned, it has proved necessary to     a large extent to dispense with compliance with them. We think it     is anomalous that the law should continue to require marking while     almost every publication is exempted.      \"In place of the present marking provisions we suggest that every     New Zealand publisher should continue to be required to print his     name and address on what he publishes, that the importer of     overseas periodicals for sale or distribution be required to supply     to the Department of Justice a list of the titles imported by him,     and that every one other than a retail bookseller who carries on     the business of importing books be required to supply to that     Department a list of the publishers whose books he imports.      \"(4) There is one anomaly in section 5 (1) (_d_) of the principal     Act as set out in the 1954 Act. This is the provision which     requires the Magistrate to take account of the persons, classes, or     age groups to whom a document is sold or is intended or likely to     be sold _and the tendency of the document to deprave or corrupt     such persons_. The words in italics are appropriate in the     Victorian statute from which they were copied because the     common-law test of depraving or corrupting applies in Victoria, but     they are at best unnecessary in New Zealand where the Act lays down     its own test--namely, that the act of the defendant must be of an     'immoral or mischievous tendency'.      \"(5) The 1954 Amendment contains some ambiguities and anomalies in     matters of detail which should be remedied when any further     legislation is brought down. These defects were discussed in an     article by Professor I. D. Campbell in the 1955 _New Zealand Law     Journal_, page 294.      \"_New Provisions Suggested_: (1)"]]]
