It turned out that our suppositions as to the cause of his delay were correct.  He had met with the same difficulties that confronted us, and had been compelled to go into camp.  Meanwhile valuable time had been lost, and the Indians, with their families and stock, were well on their way to the Okenagan country, a region into which we could not penetrate in the winter season.  No other course was therefore left but to complete the dismal failure of the expedition by returning home, and our commander readily gave the order to march back to the Dalles by the \"short\" route over the Yakima Mountains.  As the storm was still unabated, it was evident our march home would be a most difficult one, and it was deemed advisable to start back at once, lest we should be blocked up in the mountains by the snows for a period beyond which our provisions would not last.  Relying on the fact that the short route to the Dalles would lead us over the range at its most depressed point, where it was hoped the depth of snow was not yet so great as to make the route impassable, we started with Colonel Nesmith's battalion in advance to break the road, followed by my dragoons.  In the valley we made rapid progress, but when we reached the mountain every step we took up its side showed the snow to be growing deeper and deeper.  At last Nesmith reached the summit, and there found a depth of about six feet of snow covering the plateau in every direction, concealing all signs of the trail so thoroughly that his guides became bewildered and took the wrong divide.  The moment I arrived at the top my guide--Donald Mc Kay--who knew perfectly the whole Yakima range, discovered Nesmith's mistake. Word was sent to bring him back, but as he had already nearly crossed the plateau, considerable delay occurred before he returned.  When he arrived we began anew the work of breaking a road for the foot troops behind us, my detachment now in advance.  The deep snow made our work extremely laborious, exhausting men and horses almost to the point of relinquishing the struggle, but our desperate situation required that we should get down into the valley beyond, or run the chance of perishing on the mountain in a storm which seemed unending.  About midnight the column reached the valley, very tired and hungry, but much elated over its escape.  We had spent a day of the most intense anxiety, especially those who had had the responsibility of keeping to the right trail, and been charged with the hard work of breaking the road for the infantry and artillery through such a depth of snow.  Our main difficulties were now over, and in due time we reached the Dalles, where almost everyone connected with the expedition voted it a wretched failure; indeed, General Rains himself could not think otherwise, but he scattered far and wide blame for the failure of his combinations.  This, of course, led to criminations and recriminations, which eventuated in charges of incompetency preferred against him by Captain Edward O. C. Ord, of the Third Artillery. Rains met the charges with counter-charges against Ord, whom he accused of purloining Father Pandoza's shoes, when the soldiers in their fury about the ammunition destroyed the Mission.  At the time of its destruction a rumor of this nature was circulated through camp, started by some wag, no doubt in jest; for Ord, who was somewhat eccentric in his habits, and had started on the expedition rather indifferently shod in carpet-slippers, here came out in a brand-new pair of shoes.  Of course there was no real foundation for such a report, but Rains was not above small things, as the bringing of this petty accusation attests.  Neither party was ever tried, for General John E. Wool the department commander, had not at command a sufficient number of officers of appropriate rank to constitute a court in the case of Rains, and the charges against Ord were very properly ignored on account of their trifling character.  Shortly after the expedition returned to the Dalles, my detachment was sent down to Fort Vancouver, and I remained at that post during the winter of 1855-'56, till late in March.     CHAPTER V.  AN INDIAN CONFEDERATION--MASSACRE AT THE CASCADES OF THE COLUMBIA--PLAN TO RELIEVE THE BLOCKHOUSE--A HAZARDOUS FLANK MOVEMENT--A NEW METHOD OF ESTABLISHING GUILT--EXECUTION OF THE INDIAN MURDERERS.  The failure of the Haller expedition from lack of a sufficient force, and of the Rains expedition from the incompetency of its commander, was a great mortification to the officers and men connected with them, and, taken together, had a marked effect upon the Indian situation in Oregon and Washington Territories at that particular era.  Besides, it led to further complications and troubles, for it had begun to dawn upon the Indians that the whites wanted to come in and dispossess them of their lands and homes, and the failures of Haller and Rains fostered the belief with the Indians that they could successfully resist the pressure of civilization.  Acting under these influences, the Spokanes, Walla Wallas, Umatillas, and Nez Perces cast their lot with the hostiles, and all the savage inhabitants of the region east of the Cascade Range became involved in a dispute as to whether the Indians or the Government should possess certain sections of the country, which finally culminated in the war of 1856.  Partly to meet the situation that was approaching, the Ninth Infantry had been sent out from the Atlantic coast to Washington Territory, and upon its arrival at Fort Vancouver encamped in front of the officers' quarters, on the beautiful parade-ground of that post, and set about preparing for the coming campaign.  The commander, Colonel George Wright, who had been promoted to the colonelcy of the regiment upon its organization the previous year, had seen much active duty since his graduation over thirty years before, serving with credit in the Florida and Mexican wars.  For the three years previous to his assignment to the Ninth Infantry he had been stationed on the Pacific coast, and the experience he had there acquired, added to his excellent soldierly qualities, was of much benefit in the active campaigns in which, during the following years, he was to participate.  Subsequently his career was brought to an untimely close when, nine years after this period, as he was returning to the scene of his successes, he, in common with many others was drowned by the wreck of the ill-fated steamer Brother Jonathan.  Colonel Wright took command of the district in place of Rains, and had been at Vancouver but a short time before he realized that it would be necessary to fight the confederated tribes east of the Cascade Range of mountains, in order to disabuse them of the idea that they were sufficiently strong to cope with the power of the Government.  He therefore at once set about the work of organizing and equipping his troops for a start in the early spring against the hostile Indians, intending to make the objective point of his expedition the heart of the Spokane country on the Upper Columbia River, as the head and front of the confederation was represented in the person of old Cammiackan, chief of the Spokanes.  The regiment moved from Fort Vancouver by boat, March 25, 1856, and landed at the small town called the Dalles, below the mouth of the Des Chutes River at the eastern base of the Cascade Range, and just above where the Columbia River enters those mountains.  This rendezvous was to be the immediate point of departure, and all the troops composing the expedition were concentrated there.  On the morning of March 26 the movement began, but the column had only reached Five Mile Creek when the Yakimas, joined by many young warriors-free lances from other tribes, made a sudden and unexpected attack at the Cascades of the Columbia, midway between Vancouver and the Dalles, killed several citizens, women and children, and took possession of the Portage by besieging the settlers in their cabins at the Upper Cascades, and those who sought shelter at the Middle Cascades in the old military block-house, which had been built some years before as a place of refuge under just such circumstances. These points held out, and were not captured, but the landing at the Lower Cascades fell completely into the hands of the savages. Straggling settlers from the Lower Cascades made their way down to Fort Vancouver, distant about thirty-six miles, which they reached that night; and communicated the condition of affairs.  As the necessity for early relief to the settlers and the re-establishment of communication with the Dalles were apparent, all the force that could be spared was ordered out, and in consequence I immediately received directions to go with my detachment of dragoons, numbering about forty effective men, to the relief of the middle blockhouse, which really meant to retake the Cascades.  I got ready at once, and believing that a piece of artillery would be of service to me, asked for one, but as there proved to be no guns at the post, I should have been obliged to proceed without one had it not been that the regular steamer from San Francisco to Portland was lying at the Vancouver dock unloading military supplies, and the commander, Captain Dall, supplied me with the steamer's small iron cannon, mounted on a wooden platform, which he used in firing salutes at different ports on the arrival and departure of the vessel.  Finding at the arsenal a supply of solid shot that would fit the gun, I had it put upon the steamboat Belle, employed to carry my command to the scene of operations, and started up the Columbia River at 2 A.M. on the morning of the 27th. We reached the Lower Cascades early in the day, where, selecting a favorable place for the purpose, I disembarked my men and gun on the north bank of the river, so that I could send back the steamboat to bring up "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26512"],["title","Description of a New Vespertilionine Bat from Yucatan (#0)"],["body","[Author's Edition, extracted from Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Vol. IX, September 28, 1897.]   ARTICLE XIX.--DESCRIPTION OF A NEW VESPERTILIONINE BAT FROM YUCATAN.   By J.A. ALLEN.   In a small collection of mammals recently sent by Dr. G.F. Gaumer from Izamal, Yucatan, to this Museum for identification, is a single specimen of a species of _Adelonycteris_, which appears to be undescribed. It may be called  ADELONYCTERIS GAUMERI, sp. nov.       Above dark brown, with an olivaceous wash, the fur being      uniform dark brown to the base tipped with a slight tinge of      olivaceous, the extreme tip slightly grayish in certain      lights; below much lighter, the fur being dark brown basally      and broadly tipped with pale buffy gray; ears and membranes      black, naked, and with no trace of a whitish border. Ears of      medium size, rather thin, evenly convex on the front border,      slightly hollowed on the posterior border below the rounded      posteriorly directed tip; tragus long and rather narrow,      pointed, equal to half the height of the ear. Face      semi-nude, about as in _A. fusca_.       _Measurements._--\"Length, 95 mm.; expanse, 286; wing, 124;      tail, 40\";[1] ear, 21; tragus, 11; fore arm, 39; thumb, 7;      3d digit, 79 = phal. i, 37, phal. ii, 24; phal. iii, 11;      phal. iv, 7; tibia, 70; foot, 8.       [Footnote 1: Collector's measurements from the fresh      specimen; the rest are from the dry skin.]       _Skull._--Similar in a general way to that of _A. fusca_,      but about one-half smaller. Middle inner upper incisors      considerably worn, and the ridges for muscular attachment      strongly developed, indicating an old individual. Greatest      length (front base of incisors to end of crest), 18; mastoid      breadth, 8.3; zygomatic breadth, 10.1; interorbital breadth,      4; length of molar-premolar series, 4.2; palatal length,      5.3.       _Type_, No. 12753/11040, [female symbol] ad., Izamal,      Yucatan; collected by Dr. George F. Gaumer, for whom the      species is named.  In coloration _Adelonycteris gaumeri_ resembles examples of _A. fusca_ in immature dark pelage, but it differs from this species in the thinness of the ears, and in the greater relative length of the narrower and more tapering tragus, and in its very much smaller size. In size it resembles both _'Vesperugo' propinquus_ Peters and _V. (MarsipolÃ¦mus) albigularis_ Peters, respectively from Guatemala and Mexico. The peculiar structure of the ears, to say nothing of the coloration, in _V. albigularis_, render comparison with this species unnecessary. _V. propinquus_ is described as reddish above, paler and more reddish yellow below, and in this respect is widely different from _A. gaumeri_. It has also a longer thumb and foot than _A. gaumeri_.  The type and only specimen of this species has been kindly presented by Dr. Gaumer to this Museum, with other specimens of Yucatan mammals."]]]
