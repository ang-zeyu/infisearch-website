Completely preoccupied again, Matt went to a big switch and threw it. The dynamo hummed, raised its pitch to a high, almost intolerable keening note. The ring of pseudo-searchlights seemed in an ominous sort of way to spring into life. The impression must have been entirely imaginary; actually the projectors didn't move in the slightest, didn't even vibrate. Yet the conviction persisted in the minds of both Jim and Dennis that some black, invisible force was pouring down those conduits, to be sifted, diffused, and hurled through the lead lenses at the dog in the bell.         *       *       *       *       *  Thrilled to the core, not having the faintest idea what it was they were about to see, but convinced that it must surely be of stupendous import, the two stared unwinkingly at the furious hound. Matt was staring, too; but his glance was almost casual, and was concentrated more on the glass of the bell than on the experimental object.  The reason for the direction of his gaze almost immediately became apparent. And as the reason was disclosed, Dennis and Jim exclaimed aloud in disappointment--at the same time, so intense was their nameless suspense, not knowing they had opened their mouths. It appeared that for yet a little while they were to remain in ignorance of the precise meaning of the experiment.  The glass of the bell was clouding. A swirling, milky vapor, not unlike fog, was filling the bell from top to bottom.  The dog, rapidly being hidden from sight by the gathering mist, suddenly stopped its antics and stood still in the center of the bell as though overcome by surprise and indecision. Motionless, staring vacantly, it stood there for an instant--then was concealed completely by the rolling vapor.  But just before it disappeared, Jim turned to Denny in astonishment, to see if Denny had observed what he had; namely, that the fog seemed not to be gathering from the air penned up in the bell, but in some strange and rather awful way to be exuding _from the body of the dog itself_!         *       *       *       *       *  The two stared back at the bell again, neither one sure he had been right in his impression. But now the glass was entirely opaque. So thick was the vapor within that it seemed on the point of turning to a liquid. Inside, swathed in the secrecy of the fleecy folds of mist--what was happening to the dog? The two men could only guess.  Matt glanced up at an electric clock with an oversized second hand. His fingers moved nervously on the switch, then threw it to cut contact. The dynamo keened its dying note. A silence so tense that it hurt filled the great laboratory.  All eyes were glued on the bell.  The thick vapor that had been swirling and crowding as if to force itself through the glass, grew less restive in motion. Then it began to rise, ever more slowly, toward the top.  More and more compactly it packed itself into the arched glass dome, the top layers finally resembling nothing so much as cloudy beef gelatin. And now these top layers were solidifying, clinging to the glass.  Meanwhile, the bottom line of the vapor was slowly rising, an inch at a time, like a shimmering curtain being raised from a stage floor. At last ten inches showed between the pedestal and the swaying bottom of the almost liquid vapor. Jim and Denny stooped to peer under the blanket of cloud. The dog! In what way had it been affected?  Again they exclaimed aloud, involuntarily, unconsciously.  There was no dog to be seen.         *       *       *       *       *  With about fourteen clear inches now exposed, they looked a second time, more intently. But their first glance had been right. The dog was gone from the bell. Utterly and completely vanished! Or so, at least, they thought at the moment.  The rising and solidifying process of the vapor went on, while Dennis and Jim stood, almost incapable of movement, and watched to see what Breen was going to do next.  His next move came in about four minutes, when the crowding vapor had at last completely come to rest at the top of the dome like a deposit of opaque jelly. He stepped to the windlass that raised the bell, and turned the handle.  Immediately the two watchers strode impulsively toward the exposed pedestal floor.  \"Wait a minute,\" commanded the scientist, his eyes sparkling with almost ferocious intensity. The two stopped. \"You might step on it,\" he added, amazingly.  He caught up a common glass water tumbler, and cautiously moved to the edge of the platform. \"It may be dead, of course,\" he muttered. \"But I might as well be prepared.\"  Wonderingly, Jim and Dennis saw that he was intently searching every square inch of the pedestal flooring. Then they saw him crawl, like a stalking cat, toward a portion near the center--saw him clap the tumbler, upside down, over some unseen thing....  \"Got him!\" came Matt's deep, fuzzy voice. \"And he isn't dead, either. Not by a long way! Now we'll get a magnifying glass and study him.\"  Feeling like figures in a dream, Jim and Dennis looked through the lens with their absorbed host.         *       *       *       *       *  Capering about under the inverted tumbler, like a four-legged bug--and not a very large bug, either--was an incredible thing. A thing with a soft, furry coat such as no true insect possesses. A thing with tiny, canine jaws, from which hung a panting speck of a tongue like no bug ever had.  \"Yes,\" rumbled Matt, \"the specimen is far indeed from being dead. I don't know how long it might exist in so microscopic a state, nor whether it has been seriously deranged, body or brain, by the diminishing process. But at least--it's alive.\"  \"My God!\" whispered Dennis. And, his first coherent sentence since the physicist had thrown the switch: \"So this--_this_--is the overgrown brute you put under the bell a few minutes ago! This eighth-of-an-inch thing that is a miniature cartoon of a dog!\"  Jim could merely stare from the tumbler and the marvel it walled in, to the man who had worked the miracle, and back to the tumbler again.  Denny sighed. \"That thick, jellylike substance in the top of the bell,\" he said, \"what is it?\"  \"Oh, that.\" The miracle worker didn't lift his eyes from the tumbler and the very much alive and protesting bit of life it housed. \"That's the dog. Rather, it's practically all of the dog save for this small residue of substance that clothes the vital life-spark.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jim dabbed at his forehead and found it moist with sweat. \"But how is it done?\" he said shakily.  \"With element eighty-five, as I told you,\" said Breen, most of whose attention was occupied by a new stunt he was trying: he had cut a microscopic sliver of meat off a gnawed bone, and was sliding it under the glass. Would the dog eat? Could it...?  It could, and would! With a mighty bound, that covered all of a quarter of an inch, the tiny thing leaped on the meat and began to gnaw wolfishly at it. The effect was doubly shocking--to see this perfect little creature acting like any regular, full-sized dog, although as tiny as a woman's beauty spot!  \"Marvelous stuff, eighty-five,\" Matt went on. \"Any living thing, exposed to the lead-filtered emanations it gives off when disintegrated electrically to precisely the right degree, is reduced indefinitely in size. I could have made that dog as small as a microbe, even sub-visible perhaps, if I chose. Curious.... Maybe the presence of eighty-five in minute quantities on earth is all that has kept every living thing from growing indefinitely, expanding gigantically right off the face of the globe....\"         *       *       *       *       *  But now Dennis was hardly listening to him. A notion so fantastic, so bizarre that he could not at once grasp it fully, had just struck him.  \"Listen,\" he said at last, his voice so hoarse as to be almost unrecognizable, \"listen--can you reverse that process?\"  Matt nodded, and pointed to the viscous deposit in the dome of the bell. \"The protoplasmic substance is still there. It can be rebuilt, remolded to its original form any time I put the dog back in the bell and let the particles of eighty-five, which are suspended in the vacuum tubes, settle back into their original, inert mass. You see, there is such a close affinity--\"  Dennis cut him short almost rudely. It wasn't causes, marvelous though they might be, that he was interested in; it was results.  \"Would you dare ... that is ... would you like to try that experiment on a human being?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Now for once the inventor's entire interest was seized by something outside his immediate work. He stared open-mouthed at Dennis.  \"Would I?\" he breathed. \"Would I like ...\" He grunted. \"Such a question! No experiment is complete till man, the highest form of all life, has been subjected to it. I'd give anything for the chance!\" He sighed explosively. \"But of course that's impossible. I could never get anyone to be a subject. And I can't have it tried on myself because I'm the only one able to handle my apparatus in the event that anything goes wrong.\"  \"But--would you try it on a human being if you had a chance?\" persisted Denny.  \"Hah!\"  \"And could you reduce a human being in stature as radically as you did the dog? For example, could you make a man ... ant-size?\"  Matt nodded vigorously, eyes fairly flaming. \"I could make him even smaller.\"  Dennis stared at Jim. His face was transfigured. He shook with nervous eagerness. And Jim gazed back at Dennis as breathlessly and as tensely.  \"Well?\" said Dennis at last.  Jim nodded slowly.  \"Yes,\" he said. \"Of course.\"  And in those few words two men were committed to what was perhaps the strangest, most deadly, and surely the most unique, adventure the world has yet known. The improbable had happened.

CHAPTER III  _Ant-Sized Men_   Next morning, at scarcely more than daybreak, Jim and Denny stood, stripped and ready for the dread experiment, beside Matthew Breen's glass bell. The night, of course, had been sleepless. Sleep? How could slumber combat the fierce anticipations, the exotic imaginings, the clanging apprehensions of the two?  Most of the night had been spent by Denny in dutifully arguing with Jim about the advisability of his giving up the adventure, in soothing his conscience by presenting in all the angles he could think of the risks they would run.  \"You'll be entering a different world, Jim,\" Denny had said. \"An unimaginably different world. A terrible world, in which you'll be a naked, soft, defenseless thing. I'd hate to bet that we'd live even to reach the termitary. And once inside that--it's odds of seven to one that we'll never get out again.\"  \"Stow it,\" Jim had urged, puffing at his pipe.  \"I won't stow it. You may think you've run up against dangers before, but let me tell you that your most perilous jungle is safe as a church compared to the jungle an ordinary grass plot will present to us, if, as we plan, we get reduced to a quarter of an inch. I'm going in this with a mission. To me it's a heaven-sent opportunity--one I'm sure any entomologist would grab at. But you, frankly, are just a fool--\"  \"All right,\" Jim had cut in, \"let it go at that. I'm confirmed in my folly. You can't argue me out of it, so don't try any more. Now, to be practical--have you thought of any way we could arm ourselves?\"  \"Arm ourselves?\" repeated Dennis vaguely.  \"Yes. It's a difficult problem. The finest watch-maker couldn't turn out a working model of a gun that could be handled by a man a quarter of an inch tall. At the same time I have no desire to go into this thing bare-handed. And I think I know something we can use.\"  \"What?\"  \"Spears,\" said Jim with a grin. \"Steel spears. They make steel wire, you know, down to two-thousandths of an inch and finer. Probably our friend has some in his laboratory. Now, if we grind two pieces about a quarter of an inch long off such a wire, and sharpen the ends as well as we can, we'll have short spears we could swing very well.  \"Then, there's the matter of clothes.\" He grinned again. \"We'll want a breech clout, at least. I propose that we get the sheerest silk gauze we can find, and cut an eighth-inch square apiece to tie about our middles after the transformation.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He slapped his fist into his palm. \"By George! Such talk really begins to bring it home. Two men, clad in eighth-inch squares of silk gauze, using bits of almost invisibly fine steel wire as weapons, junketing forth into a world in which they'll be about the smallest and puniest things in sight! No more lords of creation, Denny. We'll have nothing but our wits to carry us through. But they, of course, will be supreme in the insect world as they are in the animal world.\"  \"Will they be supreme?\" Denny said softly. That unknown intelligence--that mysterious intellect (super-termite?) that seemed to rule each termite tribe, and which appeared so marvelously profound! \"I wonder....\"  Then he, in his turn, had descended to the practical.  \"You've solved the problem of weapons and clothing, Jim,\" he said, \"and now for my contribution.\" He left the room and came back in a few minutes with something in his hands. \"Here are some shields for us.  \"Oh, not pieces of steel armor. Shields in a figurative more than a literal sense.\"  He set down a small porcelain pot, and opened it. Within was a repulsive-looking, whitish-brown paste.  \"Ground-up termites,\" he explained. \"If we're to go wandering around in a termitary, we've got to persuade the inmates that we're friends, not foes. So we'll smear ourselves all over with this termite-paste before ever we enter the mound.\"  \"Clever, these supposedly impractical scientists,\" murmured Jim, with a lightness that did not quite succeed in covering his real admiration of the shrewdness of the thought.  And now they stood in front of Breen's glass bell, with Breen beside them all eagerness to begin the experiment.  \"What am I supposed to do after I've reduced you to the proper size?\" he asked.  \"Take us out to Morton's Grove, to the big termitary you'll find about a quarter of a mile off the road,\" said Denny. \"Set us down near the opening to one of the larger termite tunnels. Then wait till we come out again. You may have to wait quite a while--but that isn't much to ask in return for our submission to your rays.\"  \"I'll wait a week, if you wish. Let's see, what had I better carry you in?\"  It was decided--with a lack of forethought later to be bitterly regretted--that an ordinary patty-dish of the kind in which restaurants serve butter, would make as good a conveyance as anything else.         *       *       *       *       *  Matt got the patty-dish and placed it on the pedestal floor, tipping it on edge so Jim and Denny would be able to climb into it unaided (he wouldn't dare attempt to lift bodies so small for fear of mortally injuring them between thumb and forefinger). Into the patty-dish, so they could be readily located, were placed the bits of wire, the tiny fragments of silk gauze to serve as breech clouts, and a generous dab of termite-paste; and the two men stepped inside the glass dome to share the fate that, the night before, had been the dog's.  The bell was lowered around them. They watched the inventor step to the switch and pull it down....  At first there was no sensation whatever. Almost with incredulity, they watched the glass walls cloud, realized that the fogging vapor was formed of exudations from their own substance. Then physical reaction set in.  The first symptom was paralysis. With the vapor wreathing their heads in dense clouds, they found themselves unable to move a muscle. The paralysis spread partially to the involuntary muscles. Heart action was retarded enormously; and they ceased almost entirely to breathe. In spite of the cessation of muscular functioning, however, they were still conscious in a vague way. Conscious enough, at all events, to go through a hell of agony when--second and last stage--every nerve in their bodies seemed of a sudden to be rasped with files, and every tiny particle of their flesh jerked and twitched as if to break loose from the ever-shrinking skin.         *       *       *       *       *  Time, of course, was completely lost sight of. It might have been ten hours, or five minutes later when they realized they were still alive, still standing on their own feet, and now able to breathe and move. The spell of rigidity had been broken; nerves and muscles functioned smoothly and painlessly again. Also they were in clear air.  \"I guess the experiment didn't work,\" Dennis began unsteadily. But then, as his eyes began to get accustomed to his fantastically new, though intrinsically unchanged surroundings, he cried aloud.  The experiment _had_ worked. No doubt of that! And they were in a world where all the old familiar things were new and incredible marvels.  \"What can be the nature of this stuff we're standing on?\" wondered Jim, looking down.  Following his gaze, Denny too wondered for an instant, till realization came to him. \"Why, it's ordinary wood! Just the wood of the pedestal platform!\"  But it didn't seem like wood. The grain stood out in knee-high ridges in all directions to the limit of visibility. It was like a nightmare picture of a frozen bad-lands, split here and there by six-feet-broad, unfathomable chasms--which were the cracks in the flooring.  \"Where's the patty-dish?\" queried Jim.  Dennis gazed about. \"We were standing right over it when the reducing process started.... Oh, there it is!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Far off to the right an enormous, shallowly hollowed plateau caught their eyes. They started toward it, hurdling the irregular ridges, leaping across the dizzy chasms.  The tiny dish had been tipped on edge--but when they reached it they found its thickness alone a daunting thing.  \"It's a pity Matt didn't select a thinner kind of china,\" grumbled Dennis; gazing at the head-high wall that was the edge of the plate. \"Here--I'll stand on your shoulders, and then give you an arm up. Look out--it's slippery!\"  It was. Their feet slid out from under them on the glazed surface repeatedly. It was with the utmost effort that they finally made their way to the center of the shallow plateau.  There, lying beside two heaps of coarse cloth and a mound of horrible-smelling stuff that he recognized as the dab of termite-paste, they saw two glistening steel bars. About five feet long, they seemed to be, and half an inch in diameter. The wire-ends which, a few moments ago, they had been forced to handle with tweezers for fear of losing!  Jim picked one up and drew it back for a pretended spear-thrust. He laughed, vibrantly, eagerly.  \"I'm just beginning to realize it's really happened, and that the hunt has started. Bring on your bugs!\"  Dennis stooped and picked up his spear. It was unwieldy, ponderous, the weight of that long, not-too-thin steel bar. Jim's great shoulders and heavy arms were suited well enough to such a weapon; but Dennis could have wished that his were some pounds lighter.  They turned their attention to the evil-smelling hill of termite-ointment. With many grimaces, they took turns in smearing each other from head to feet with the repulsive stuff. Then they knotted about them the yard-square pieces of fabric--once sheer silk gauze, now cloth as stiff and cumbersome as sail-cloth. They faced each other, ready for their trip.
