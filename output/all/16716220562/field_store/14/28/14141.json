They, too, faded in the distance, and at length the reefs with their white surge, and Pencarrow Light high on the cliffs above the poor rusty remnants of a wreck, were far astern.  The leading vessels had lifted their bows westward through the Strait, and each following ship was in turn changing course.  At sea at last, Mac left his perch, and departed below to his work, a shower-bath and breakfast.  Later in the morning the weather cleared, the cliffs, the hills and the snowy mountains were glorious in the sunshine, and the troops basked at full length on deck while distant points took form far ahead, came on the beam and passed astern.  Once through the Strait, the fleet took up its regular formation, the ten transports in two lines of five, with the two large cruisers ahead and the two small ones astern.  Late at night, the Farewell Light passed into the blackness, and when dawn broke again, grey, chill and wet, no land was visible behind the reeling stern.  For five or six days--Mac lost count--the transports rolled and creaked and swayed up the grey, lumpy swell, lurched over the crests and plunged away down into the troughs.  The spray lifted over the bows and swept along the decks, the wind howled dismally through the rigging, and the ship was wet and comfortless.  All was grey--the ships, the sky, the sea and the long trails of smoke fleeing away to leeward.  Mac had found a good job on board, together with Joe of the Canterbury Squadron and Jock of his own squadron, in charge of the fodder.  Both were from the sheep country and real fine fellows, though Joe had had a college education, while Jock claimed only to have been dragged up in the bush.  Three times a day, about an hour before their own meals, they weighed out for the horses the rations of chaff, oats, hay, linseed and so forth, and issued them to fatigues from the troops, the service corps and the mounted machine-gunners, who came slipping and sliding along the deck in heavy gum-boots.  The second-class dining saloon of peace days had descended to becoming a fodder room for the horses, and outside its door gathered the boys clamouring for their loads, laughing and swearing and generally hindering Mac and his cobbers at their work.  Everything had gone like clockwork in port, but, for the first few days at sea, these practical sons of the bush and the sheep-stations were for the moment put out of their stride.  Hefty men lay huddled helplessly on their bunks and others moped about searching for the drier, warmer corners.  But the horses had to be fed, though many of them, too, hung their heads in the deepest dejection.  The men who were not seasick turned to with a will, and many who were went to work with bold hearts, though feeling too utterly miserable for description when down below on the stuffy, reeling horse-decks.  Mac, in the foolishness of his abandonment, had flung himself at the first spasm of seasickness on to the top of some of his bales of hay; the sweet fragrance of the hay aggravated the evil effects of the rolling, and three days passed like an interminable nightmare. Sometimes the bales and bags slid about the place with the rolling of the ship, occasionally he made weak though desperate attempts to help Joe and Jock who struggled on nobly; but eventually Mac managed to drag himself and two blankets to the top of the horse-boxes high on the boat-deck.  There lay rows of men like corpses in their blankets, with pinched white faces peeping out, which smiled pathetically with the bashfulness of returning spirits.  All were on their feet again by dawn of the sixth day, and in odd moments between work peered over the side to catch a glimpse of the low dim line of the Tasmanian coast.  They kept along the land for a few hours, and then, forming single line-ahead, steamed slowly up the beautiful sunny waters of the Derwent, with white curving beaches and bush-clad hills on either side.  Five ships berthed at once for fresh water.  In the afternoon the troops were marched through the town, and the people cheered heartily and hurried in great excitement to see them, bringing cake and fruit and beer.  Some of the boys, keen on adventure, slipped quietly out of the ranks and down side streets, and in the evening other hard cases garbed themselves as stokers, walked boldly past the guard and spent the merriest of evenings in Hobart, to return, perhaps, to a term of C.B. which the holiday was well worth. The other five vessels watered in the morning, and by evening the fleet was again at sea, steaming slowly southwards in a fog towards the southern point of Tasmania.  In Morse code each ship in turn mournfully wailed her number, and endeavoured to keep station in the thick pall.  For day after day they swung over the long seas which always sweep across the Australian Bight, but the troops ran about the ships as if they had never been anywhere else, and the horses stamped and whinnied unanimously when the boys stood ready to feed, and looked eagerly for more than the martinet of a Vet would allow.  The Vet was a brusque man whose job was to look after the horses and not to concern himself with the fine points of military lore, distinctions of rank, or the airs of those officers who thought themselves not made of ordinary clay.  He was impatient with people who were incompetent or who hindered him in his work.  So on the occasions when Captain O'Grady violated the sanctity of the fodder-room by stowing there some of his infantry equipment, the Vet would angrily demand:  \"Mac!  What's that blanky stuff doing there?  Is that some more of O'Grady's blanky rubbish?\"  \"Yes.  He said you said he----\"  \"I don't care a blank what he said.  Heave his blanky stuff out of here.  O'Grady and his blanky stuff can go to hell.  Next time he tries to bring his rubbish in here you tell him to get to blanky blazes with it!  See?\"  \"Righto!  I'll do that.\"  Mac was not soaked in military etiquette, but he rather hesitated, when the Captain-Quartermaster brought some gear to stow, to instruct him to go to blanky hell with his blanky, etc., etc.  However, as soon as Captain O'Grady had disappeared he and Joe shoved his gear out on the wet deck and the Quartermaster constantly finding it there decided to seek other havens.  \"I'll teach that blanky infantryman to stow his blanky stuff here,\" rumbled the Vet with satisfaction when there were no more signs of alien goods lumbering the fodder-room.  The first burial of a member of the force took place one stormy day in the Australian Bight.  He had died the night before on the Ruapehu.  In the middle of the afternoon the whole fleet lay to for ten minutes, the troops standing to attention on every ship.  The vessels rolled heavily to the rushing silent seas, the troops with grim faces swayed in their long lines on the careening decks.  There was no colour to the scene but grey.  The greyness, the vast space, the haunting notes of the \"Last Post\" echoing along the troopdecks, the lonely body deserted on the wide sea, left a deep impression on those light-hearted adventurers.  Death!  And to be buried here in a lonely ocean grave! Mac wondered how many of these 8,500 men would see New Zealand's shores again, and how many would lie in foreign lands.  But such speculations did not trouble him for long.  \"Carry On\" sounded briskly, and Mac returned to his work in the fodder-room.  Like many others of that light-hearted crew, Mac had really not embarked upon these adventures on account of the \"ruthless violation of the rights of small nations,\" with the desire \"to crush once and for all the Prussian military despotism,\" and so forth.  Had he given the question deep thought he might possibly have welcomed these reasons as additional charms; though the fact was that he had never worried much concerning why he had come.  War, bloody war, romantic, glorious war raging in the Old World, and he obeyed the irresistible desire to join in it.  The whole atmosphere of the life appealed to him, the uncertainty of the future, the unknown destination, the company of all the boys, and the free, fresh life.  More than a week passed and then one morning against the pale blue of the dawn sky showed low dim outlines of deeper blue, and towards midday the fleet entered the wide waters of King George's Sound and cast anchor with the _Tahiti_ nearest the sea.  On the upper reaches of the Sound lay a great fleet of thirty or forty large vessels--the Australian fleet.  Mac had not previously known that they were to fall in with them here.  For four days they lay at anchor swinging to the tide, in the entrance, lonely and unvisited, while the eager, bare-footed, bare-legged and bare-chested men gazed longingly at the distant port and tried to persuade themselves that the vessel must go up there for coal and water.  Several times the life-boat crews lowered the boats and raced clumsily with each other; and once the troops polished and cleaned all the morning for an inspection by the G.O.C. which never came off.  Otherwise they drilled at odd times, groomed, fed and exercised the horses and basked in the sun.  Rumours were unusually active, and the question of destination was fiercely argued--South-West Africa, India for garrison duty, or France by the Cape or Suez.  The course the fleet set after leaving the Sound would partly decide the question.  The first daylight of Sunday, November 1st--a dawn of rare perfection, with the spacious Sound unruffled by any stray breeze, the wide blue heaven unbroken by any cloud--saw that purposeful activity among the ships which immediately precedes putting to sea.  Smoke drifted upwards from many funnels, some ships were busy clearing their anchors, while others manoeuvred out of tight corners.  First came the men-o'-war, sweeping"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26548"],["title","The Tale of a Trooper (#4)"],["body","past the _Tahiti_ and out to sea.  Then, in single-line-ahead, followed the transports in grand procession past the _Tahiti's_ bows, whose troops stood on the topmost perches to miss nothing of the glorious review.  Everywhere to the upperworks of each passing vessel clung the Australians.  As each vessel came abreast, wild, enraptured cheering broke out, and, with all the power of healthy lungs, with enthusiasm unreserved, with cooees and hakas and scrappy messages semaphored by the arms, the Australians and New Zealanders met in a deep friendship which was to last through years of campaigning and privation.     CHAPTER IV  LAZY SHIPBOARD LIFE  The _Tahiti_ fell in astern of the long line whose foremost ships were almost hull down, and left the Sound empty and deserted.  When all were at sea, they took station, the thirty Australian ships in three lines ahead, with the ten New Zealand transports in two lines astern, their leading ships stationed between the three rearmost vessels of the Australian line.  The men-o'-war took up positions far ahead on the horizon and on the flanks.  Towards evening a nor'-west course was set, which the troops generally accepted as sufficient evidence that Colombo would be the next port of call.  For some days the fleet swung heavily to a considerable swell from the west; and Mac watched, from the boat deck, the long line of careering masts ahead, sliding about like so many drunken matches, spray flying from the bows, and the foaming wake seething from the labouring screws of the ship ahead.  It amused him to cast his eyes aft along the boat deck, the full length of which stretched two lines of horse-boxes facing outwards.  With an even keel only the noses of the horses showed beyond the stalls; but, when the vessel rolled heavily to a beam swell, their heads swung in and out like the cuckoos of cuckoo clocks.  One moment, as the ship lay well over into a trough, Mac could see nothing but a long line of posts; the next, as she lifted to a sea, out shot those eighty heads.  They trod backwards and forwards in regular step, and were cursed constantly by the men whose bunks were immediately below the trampling hoofs.  The horses settled down to the life in a wonderful fashion, and through the splendid attention of the troops appeared not a whit the worse for the first three weeks at sea.  With the increasing heat and the lack of exercise some of them were growing a little short-tempered; and men, passing along the front of a line of boxes, had to be prepared for a horse occasionally making a grab at him.  Least of all to appreciate the presence of horses in the vessels were the officers of the ships accustomed to Royal Mails and jolly passengers.  They now appeared in all the immaculate glory of white ducks; and it almost gave Mac the impression that the horses had taken a special dislike to them.  Either they would frequently be bitten at, or else when one of them was standing comfortably on deck smoking, a horse would give a violent sneeze behind him, and he would disappear into his cabin, muttering wrathfully as he changed into a clean suit. And the Captain himself was no more pleased when he noticed the way in which the constant trampling of the horses was wearing ugly tracks in his best teak decks.  Every morning and afternoon, when the vessels were not rolling too heavily, long strips of cocoa-nut matting were laid round the boat deck and the length of the upper deck; and the horses were led round and round for a little, though valuable, exercise.  Men spread awnings from the front of the boxes, and watered them steadily from above, so that the horses might be as cool as possible.  All of this was hard, hot work, to which the men stuck splendidly.  Mac, however, had none of it, for, his turn in the fodder-room being over, he was sent to the bridge as a signaller.  He knew little about the work, but another signaller was wanted, and he was sent to learn.  It was the best of work, clean, cool and interesting.  He did his watches on the bridge, looking down on everything from that exalted position, swept the fleet constantly with his glasses, and did what was told him.  He peered into the log book, and closely examined the charts in spare moments when the officer of the watch was not noticing.  He examined everything that was to be examined, instruments, code books and distant ships, and altogether thoroughly approved of being a signaller.  Often there was work to be done, in daylight by semaphore arms, or international flag code; and at night by morse lamps, carefully shaded.  Mac fumbled about and fell over himself at times before he mastered the mysteries of flag signals--the knots, the halyards and the nautical language.  \"AJP tackline J,\" the Skipper would roar; and two of the signallers would fall over each other in a hurried attempt to get it all tied together.  And something usually went wrong--the tackline missed out, two J's put on by mistake, or an M instead of a J.  Once Mac failed to make fast the two ends, and one hoist of flags went trailing out over the beam.  He let them down into the water, so that the weight might swing them inboard, while the other signaller struggled manfully with a hayrake to grapple them; and the Captain cursed and Mac flushed all over, knowing that every ship in the fleet was grinning at them.  Two days out from King George's Sound the fleet was joined by two more transports with Australian troops from Fremantle.  A week later H.M.S. _Minotaur_ passed down the lines between the ships, and soon after disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The fleet had been sailing with carefully screened lights, and now precautions were to be doubled, no dynamos to be run, and navigation lights to be further dulled by several thicknesses of signal flags across the glass.  Various small happenings left the troops with a sort of impression that there might be something in the wind.  When, therefore, early one tropic morning the three remaining men-o'-war moved nervously from their stations, rolled great black-brown coils of smoke from their funnels, and nosed suspiciously out towards the western horizon,  like  three  dogs seeking  a  scent, it was evident the day would not be without interest.  Within a few minutes H.M.A.S. _Sydney_ set a definite course, and with a foaming wake and a trail of heavy smoke, went off at full speed to the sou'-west.  Mac went below for breakfast in the steamy saloon.  Word went round that the _Emden_ was at the bottom of the business; and men gathered in groups, talking with animation, and gazing occasionally towards the south-west.  Later in the morning the Japanese cruiser went off in that direction, leaving only H.M.A.S. _Melbourne_ with the fleet.  At about eleven the great news came; and great enthusiasm welcomed it. In the _Tahiti_ it leaked out before it was officially announced; and the poor signallers were blamed in consequence.  At any rate it was true.  About ten thirty the _Sydney_ had reported the _Emden_ beached and blazing; and that she had gone off in pursuit of another vessel. The _Maunganui_ had offered to take the _Sydney's_ wounded; but she replied that there were only twelve casualties, sent her thanks, and said there was no need.  That was all the troops heard of the fight for some days, though later the _Empress of Russia_ passed on her way to pick up the many wounded from the wrecked _Emden_.  Then came the crossing of the Line; and in all ships Father Neptunes were busy lathering, dosing and abusing unlucky troops who tried to escape their gentle hands.  Crowds of men splashed rowdily about in great sails of water.  But a medical officer unfortunately lost his life over these proceedings, and a momentary sadness settled over the fleet.  The New Zealand section went ahead of the main fleet a day or two before reaching Colombo in order to proceed with coaling and watering. Early on a Sunday morning the mist-covered hills of Ceylon took form on the starboard bow; and, later on, a palm-grown shore and natives in catamarans.  Then the house-tops, the breakwater and the shipping of Colombo emerged from the luxurious forest and curving shores.  About the middle of the forenoon the New Zealand vessels in two lines of five were about to enter the harbour, when the _Sydney_ and the _Empress of Russia_ were signalled coming up astern; and the New Zealand ships lay to to give way to the men-o'-war.  In deep, impressive silence, they passed down between the lines, while the bluejackets and the troops stood at rigid attention, salute after salute sounded from each ship in turn, and ensigns dipped.  Two days at Colombo passed merrily enough with forty-five shipfuls of light-hearted troops exploring that Oriental city for the first time; and at the end of it the Cingalees were left in a dazed condition. Bazaars, wineshops, native quarters and Gal Face all rang with the delighted shouts of irresponsible troops making the best of a short time; and rickshaws were raced against each other with great effect. Before many hours had passed the Staff announced their disapproval of such unmilitary conduct, and stopped leave; but the men were not overawed by the thunder of the heads, and those who could swarmed ashore from the ships, leave or no leave.  At length the vessels went to the outer anchorage, at a safe distance from Oriental seductions. Next morning a tug brought from the shore a washed-out collection of adventurers, and distributed them to their ships.  Under way again, the fleet steered a west-nor'-westerly course for Aden, and the men, none the worse for a little joy in Colombo, settled again to ship routine. Six German sailors from the _Emden_ had been placed on board the _Tahiti_ at Colombo; and from them Mac heard something of the battle--how the _Sydney_ had surprised them when they had some boats' crews away destroying the wireless and cable stations at Cocos Islands; how the _Emden_ had been"]]]
