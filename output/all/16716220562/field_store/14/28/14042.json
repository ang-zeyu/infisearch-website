For the Tongan, therefore, inspiration indubitably was possession.  When one of the higher gods was invoked, through his priest, by a chief who wished to consult the oracle, or, in old Israelitic phraseology, to \"inquire of,\" the god, a hog was killed and cooked over night, and, together with plantains, yams, and the materials for making the peculiar drink _kava_ (of which the Tongans were very fond), was carried next day to the priest. A circle, as for an ordinary kava-drinking entertainment, was then formed; but the priest, as the representative of the god, took the highest place, while the chiefs sat outside the circle, as an expression of humility calculated to please the god.      As soon as they are all seated the priest is considered as    inspired, the god being supposed to exist within him from that    moment. He remains for a considerable time in silence with his    hands clasped before him, his eyes are cast down and he rests    perfectly still. During the time the victuals are being shared    out and the kava preparing, the matabooles sometimes begin to    consult him; sometimes he answers, and at other times not;    in either case he remains with his eyes cast down. Frequently he    will not utter a word till the repast is finished and the kava    too. When he speaks he generally begins in a low and very    altered tone of voice, which gradually rises to nearly its    natural pitch, though sometimes a little above it. All that he    says is supposed to be the declaration of the god, and he    accordingly speaks in the first person, as if he were the god.    All this is done generally without any apparent inward emotion    or outward agitation; but, on some occasions, his countenance    becomes fierce, and as it were inflamed, and his whole frame    agitated with inward feeling; he is seized with an universal    trembling, the perspiration breaks out on his forehead, and his    lips turning black are convulsed; at length tears start in    floods from his eyes, his breast heaves with great emotion, and    his utterance is choked. These symptoms gradually subside.    Before this paroxysm comes on, and after it is over, he often    eats as much as four hungry men under other circumstances could    devour. The fit being now gone off, he remains for some time    calm and then takes up a club that is placed by him for the    purpose, turns it over and regards it attentively; he then looks    up earnestly, now to the right, now to the left, and now again    at the club; afterwards he looks up again and about him in like    manner, and then again fixes his eyes on the club, and so on for    several times. At length he suddenly raises the club, and, after    a moment's pause, strikes the ground or the adjacent part of the    house with considerable force, immediately the god leaves him,    and he rises up and retires to the back of the ring among the    people (vol. i. pp. 100, 101).  The phenomena thus described, in language which, to any one who is familiar with the manifestations of abnormal mental states among ourselves, bears the stamp of fidelity, furnish a most instructive commentary upon the story of the wise woman of Endor. As in the latter, we have the possession by the spirit or soul (Atua, Elohim), the strange voice, the speaking in the first person. Unfortunately nothing (beyond the loud cry) is mentioned as to the state of the wise woman of Endor. But what we learn from other sources (_e.g._ 1 Sam. x. 20-24) respecting the physical concomitants of inspiration among the old Israelites has its exact equivalent in this and other accounts of Polynesian prophetism. An excellent authority, Moerenhout, who lived among the people of the Society Islands many years and knew them well, says that, in Tahiti, the _role_ of the prophet had very generally passed out of the hands of the priests into that of private persons who professed to represent the god, often assumed his name, and in this capacity prophesied. I will not run the risk of weakening the force of Moerenhout's description of the prophetic state by translating it:--  \"Un individu, dans cet etat, avait le bras gauche enveloppe d'un morceau d'etoffe, signe de la presence de la Divinite. Il ne parlait que d'un ton imperieux et vehement. Ses attaques, quand il allait prophetiser, etaient aussi effroyables qu'imposantes. Il tremblait d'abord de tous ses membres, la figure enflee, les yeux hagards, rouges et etincelants d'une expression sauvage. Il gesticulait, articulait des mots vides de sens, poussait des cris horribles qui faisaient tressaillir tous les assistants, et s'exaltait parfois au point qu'on n'osait par l'approcher. Autour de lui, le silence de la terreur et du respect.... C'est alors qu'il repondait aux questions, annoncait l'avenir, le destin des batailles, la volonte des dieux; et, chose etonnante! au sein de ce delire, de cet enthousiasme religieux, son langage etait grave, imposant, son eloquence noble et persuasive.\" [21]  Just so Saul strips off his clothes, \"prophesies\" before Samuel, and lies down \"naked all that day and night.\"  Both Mariner and Moerenhout refuse to have recourse to the hypothesis of imposture in order to account for the inspired state of the Polynesian prophets. On the contrary, they fully believe in their sincerity. Mariner tells the story of a young chief, an acquaintance of his, who thought himself possessed by the Atua of a dead woman who had fallen in love with him, and who wished him to die that he might be near her in Bolotoo. And he died accordingly. But the most valuable evidence on this head is contained in what the same authority says about King Finow's son. The previous king, Toogoo Ahoo, had been assassinated by Finow, and his soul, become an Atua of divine rank in Bolotoo, had been pleased to visit and inspire Finow's son--with what particular object does not appear.     When this young chief returned to Hapai, Mr. Mariner, who was    upon a footing of great friendship with him, one day asked him    how he felt himself when the spirit of Toogoo Ahoo visited him;    he replied that he could not well describe his feelings, but the    best he could say of it was, that he felt himself all over in a    glow of heat and quite restless and uncomfortable, and did not    feel his own personal identity, as it were, but seemed to have a    mind different from his own natural mind, his thoughts wandering    upon strange and unusual subjects, though perfectly sensible of    surrounding objects. He next asked him how he knew it was the    spirit of Toogoo Ahoo? His answer was, 'There's a fool! How can    I tell you _how_ I knew it! I felt and knew it was so by a    kind of consciousness; my _mind_ told me that it was Toogoo    Ahoo (vol. i. pp. 104, 105).  Finow's son was evidently made for a theological disputant, and fell back at once on the inexpugnable stronghold of faith when other evidence was lacking. \"There's a fool! I know it is true, because I know it,\" is the exemplar and epitome of the sceptic-crushing process in other places than the Tonga Islands.  The island of Bolotoo, to which all the souls (of the upper classes at any rate) repair after the death of the body, and from which they return at will to interfere, for good or evil, with the lives of those whom they have left behind, obviously answers to Sheol. In Tongan tradition, this place of souls is a sort of elysium above ground and pleasant enough to live in. But, in other parts of Polynesia, the corresponding locality, which is called Po, has to be reached by descending into the earth, and is represented dark and gloomy like Sheol. But it was not looked upon as a place of rewards and punishments in any sense. Whether in Bolotoo or in Po, the soul took the rank it had in the flesh; and, a shadow, lived among the shadows of the friends and houses and food of its previous life.  The Tongan theologians recognised several hundred gods; but there was one, already mentioned as their national god, whom they regarded as far greater than any of the others, \"as a great chief from the top of the sky down to the bottom of the earth\" (Mariner, vol. ii. p. 106). He was also god of war, and the tutelar deity of the royal family, whoever happened to be the incumbent of the royal office for the time being. He had no priest except the king himself, and his visits, even to royalty, were few and far between. The name of this supreme deity was Ta-li-y-Tooboo, the literal meaning of which is said to be \"Wait there, Tooboo,\" from which it would appear that the peculiar characteristic of Ta-li-y-Tooboo, in the eyes of his worshippers, was persistence of duration. And it is curious to notice, in relation to this circumstance, that many Hebrew philologers have thought the meaning of Jahveh to be best expressed by the word \"Eternal.\" It would probably be difficult to express the notion of an eternal being, in a dialect so little fitted to convey abstract conceptions as Tongan, better than by that of one who always \"waits there.\"  The characteristics of the gods in Tongan theology are exactly those of men whose shape they are supposed to possess, only they have more intelligence and greater power. The Tongan belief that, after death, the human Atua more readily distinguishes good from evil, runs parallel with the old Israelitic conception of Elohim expressed in Genesis, \"Ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good from evil.\" They further agreed with the old Israelites, that \"all rewards for virtue and punishments for vice happen to men in this world only, and come immediately from the gods\" (vol. ii. p. 100). Moreover,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],["title","The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#6)"],["body"," they were of opinion that though the gods approve of some kinds of virtue, are displeased with some kinds of vice, and, to a certain extent, protect or forsake their worshippers according to their moral conduct, yet neglect to pay due respect to the deities, and forgetfulness to keep them in good humour, might be visited with even worse consequences than moral delinquency. And those who will carefully study the so-called \"Mosaic code\" contained in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, will see that, though Jahveh's prohibitions of certain forms of immorality are strict and sweeping, his wrath is quite as strongly kindled against infractions of ritual ordinances. Accidental homicide may go unpunished, and reparation may be made for wilful theft. On the other hand, Nadab and Abihu, who \"offered strange fire before Jahveh, which he had not commanded them,\" were swiftly devoured by Jahveh's fire; he who sacrificed anywhere except at the allotted place was to be \"cut off from his people\"; so was he who ate blood; and the details of the upholstery of the Tabernacle, of the millinery of the priests' vestments, and of the cabinet work of the ark, can plead direct authority from Jahveh, no less than moral commands.  Amongst the Tongans, the sacrifices were regarded as gifts of food and drink offered to the divine Atuas, just as the articles deposited by the graves of the recently dead were meant as food for Atuas of lower rank. A kava root was a constant form of offering all over Polynesia. In the excellent work of the Rev. George Turner, entitled _Nineteen Years in Polynesia_ (p. 241), I find it said of the Samoans (near neighbours of the Tongans):--     _The offerings_ were principally cooked food. As in ancient    Greece so in Samoa, the first cup was in honour of the god.    It was either poured out on the ground or _waved_ towards    the heavens, reminding us again of the Mosaic ceremonies.    The chiefs all drank a portion out of the same cup, according to    rank; and after that, the food brought as an offering was    divided and eaten '_there before the Lord._'  In Tonga, when they consulted a god who had a priest, the latter, as representative of the god, had the first cup; but if the god, like Ta-li-y-Tooboo, had no priest, then the chief place was left vacant, and was supposed to be occupied by the god himself. When the first cup of kava was filled, the mataboole who acted as master of the ceremonies said, \"Give it to your god,\" and it was offered, though only as a matter of form. In Tonga and Samoa there were many sacred places or _morais,_ with houses of the ordinary construction, but which served as temples in consequence of being dedicated to various gods; and there were altars on which the sacrifices were offered; nevertheless there were few or no images. Mariner mentions none in Tonga, and the Samoans seem to have been regarded as no better than atheists by other Polynesians because they had none. It does not appear that either of these peoples had images even of their family or ancestral gods.  In Tahiti and the adjacent islands, Moerenhout (t. i. p. 471) makes the very interesting observation, not only that idols were often absent, but that, where they existed, the images of the gods served merely as depositories for the proper representatives of the divinity. Each of these was called a _maro aurou,_ and was a kind of girdle artistically adorned with red, yellow, blue, and black feathers--the red feathers being especially important--which were consecrated and kept as sacred objects within the idols. They were worn by great personages on solemn occasions, and conferred upon their wearers a sacred and almost divine character. There is no distinct evidence that the _maro aurou_ was supposed to have any special efficacy in divination, but one cannot fail to see a certain parallelism between this holy girdle, which endowed its wearer with a particular sanctity, and the ephod.  According to the Rev. R. Taylor, the New Zealanders formerly used the word _karakia_ (now employed for \"prayer\") to signify a \"spell, charm, or incantation,\" and the utterance of these karakias constituted the chief part of their cult. In the south, the officiating priest had a small image, \"about eighteen inches long, resembling a peg with a carved head,\" which reminds one of the form commonly attributed to the teraphim.  \"The priest first bandaged a fillet of red parrot feathers under the god's chin, which was called his pahau or beard; this bandage was made of a certain kind of sennet, which was tied on in a peculiar way. When this was done it was taken possession of by the Atua, whose spirit entered it. The priest then either held it in the hand and vibrated it in the air whilst the powerful karakia was repeated, or he tied a piece of string (formed of the centre of a flax leaf) round the neck of the image and stuck it in the ground. He sat at a little distance from it, leaning against a tuahu, a short stone pillar stuck in the ground in a slanting position and, holding the string in his hand, he gave the god a jerk to arrest his attention, lest he should be otherwise engaged, like Baal of old, either hunting, fishing, or sleeping, and therefore must be awaked.... The god is supposed to make use of the priest's tongue in giving a reply. Image-worship appears to have been confined to one part of the island. The Atua was supposed only to enter the image for the occasion. The natives declare they did not worship the image itself, but only the Atua it represented, and that the image was merely used as a way of approaching him.\" [22]  This is the excuse for image-worship which the more intelligent idolaters make all the world over; but it is more interesting to observe that, in the present case, we seem to have the equivalents of divination by teraphim, with the aid of something like an ephod (which, however, is used to sanctify the image and not the priest) mixed up together. Many Hebrew archaeologists have supposed that the term \"ephod\" is sometimes used for an image (particularly in the case of Gideon's ephod), and the story of Micah, in the book of Judges, shows that images were, at any rate, employed in close association with the ephod. If the pulling of the string to call the attention of the god seems as absurd to us as it appears to have done to the worthy missionary, who tells us of the practice, it should be recollected that the high priest of Jahveh was ordered to wear a garment fringed with golden bells.      And it shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the sound thereof    shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before    Jahveh, and when he cometh out, that he die not (Exod.    xxviii. 35).  An escape from the obvious conclusion suggested by this passage has been sought in the supposition that these bells rang for the sake of the worshippers, as at the elevation of the host in the Roman Catholic ritual; but then why should the priest be threatened with the well-known penalty for inadvisedly beholding the divinity?  In truth, the intermediate step between the Maori practice and that of the old Israelites is furnished by the Kami temples in Japan. These are provided with bells which the worshippers who present themselves ring, in order to call the attention of the ancestor-god to their presence. Grant the fundamental assumption of the essentially human character of the spirit, whether Atua, Kami, or Elohim, and all these practices are equally rational.  The sacrifices to the gods in Tonga, and elsewhere in Polynesia, were ordinarily social gatherings, in which the god, either in his own person or in that of his priestly representative, was supposed to take part. These sacrifices were offered on every occasion of importance, and even the daily meals were prefaced by oblations and libations of food and drink, exactly answering to those offered by the old Romans to their manes, penates, and lares. The sacrifices had no moral significance, but were the necessary result of the theory that the god was either a deified ghost of an ancestor or chief, or, at any rate, a being of like nature to these. If one wanted to get anything out of him, therefore, the first step was to put him in good humour by gifts; and if one desired to escape his wrath, which might be excited by the most trifling neglect or unintentional disrespect, the great thing was to pacify him by costly presents. King Finow appears to have been somewhat of a freethinker (to the great horror of his subjects), and it was only his untimely death which prevented him from dealing with the priest of a god, who had not returned a favourable answer to his supplications, as Saul dealt with the priests of the sanctuary of Jahveh at Nob. Nevertheless, Finow showed his practical belief in the gods during the sickness of a daughter, to whom he was fondly attached, in a fashion which has a close parallel in the history of Israel.     If the gods have any resentment against us, let the whole    weight of vengeance fall on my head. I fear not their vengeance    --but spare my child; and I earnestly entreat you, Toobo Totai    [the god whom he had evoked], to exert all your influence with    the other gods that I alone may suffer all the punishment they    desire to inflict (vol. i. p. 354).  So when the king of Israel has sinned by \"numbering the people,\" and they are punished for his fault by a pestilence which slays seventy thousand innocent men, David cries to Jahveh:--     Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep,    what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me,    and against my father's house. (2 Sam. xxiv. 17).  Human sacrifices were extremely common in Polynesia; and, in Tonga, the \"devotion\" of a child by strangling was a favourite method of averting the wrath of the gods. The well-known instances of Jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter and of David's giving up the seven sons of Saul to be sacrificed by the"]]]
