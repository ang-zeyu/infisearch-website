He brought me here and played a joke on me. He told me this was a house I could sleep in, and shut me up in here,--and blest if I don't b'lieve it's nothin' but a hen-house. Let me out here a minute,\" he continued, after a pause, cajolingly.  \"No, I won't,\" said Willy firmly, getting his gun ready.  There was a pause, and then from the depths of the hen-house issued the most awful groan:  \"Umm! Ummm!! Ummmm!!!\"  Willy was frightened.  \"Umm! Umm!\" was repeated.  \"What's the matter with you?\" asked Willy, feeling sorry in spite of himself.  \"Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm so sick,\" groaned the man in the hen-house.  \"How? What's the matter?\"  \"That man that fooled me in here gave me something to drink, and it's pizened me; oh! oh! oh! I'm dying.\"  It was a horrible groan.  Willy's heart relented. He moved to the door and was just about to open it to look in when a light flashed across the yard from Uncle Balla's house, and he saw him coming with a flaming light-wood knot in his hand.     CHAPTER V.   Instead of opening the door, therefore, Willy called to the old man, who was leisurely crossing the yard: \"Run, Uncle Balla. Quick, run!\"  At the call Old Balla and Frank set out as fast as they could.  \"What's the matter? Is he done kill de chickens? Is he done got away?\" the old man asked, breathlessly.  \"No, he's dyin',\" shouted Willy.  \"Hi! is you shoot him?\" asked the old driver.  \"No, that other man's poisoned him. He was the robber and he fooled this one,\" explained Willy, opening the door and peeping anxiously in.  \"Go 'long, boy,--now, d'ye ever heah de better o' dat?--dat man's foolin' wid you; jes' tryin' to git yo' to let him out.\"  \"No, he isn't,\" said Willy; \"you ought to have heard him.\"  But both Balla and Frank were laughing at him, so he felt very shamefaced. He was relieved by hearing another groan.  \"Oh, oh, oh! Ah, ah!\"  \"You hear that?\" he asked, triumphantly.  \"I boun' I'll see what's the matter with him, the roscol! Stan' right dyah, y' all, an' if he try to run shoot him, but mine you don' hit _me_,\" and the old man walked up to the door, and standing on one side flung it open. \"What you doin' in dyah after dese chillern's chickens?\" he called fiercely.  \"Hello, old man, 's 'at you? I's mighty sick,\" muttered the person within. Old Balla held his torch inside the house, amid a confused cackle and flutter of fowls.  \"Well, ef 'tain' a white man, and a soldier at dat!\" he exclaimed. \"What you doin' heah, robbin' white folks' hen-roos'?\" he called, roughly. \"Git up off dat groun'; you ain' sick.\"  \"Let me get up, Sergeant,--hic--don't you heah the roll-call?--the tent's mighty dark; what you fool me in here for?\" muttered the man inside.  The boys could see that he was stretched out on the floor, apparently asleep, and that he was a soldier in uniform. Balla stepped inside.  \"Is he dead?\" asked both boys as Balla caught him by the arms, lifted him, and let him fall again limp on the floor.  \"Nor, he's dead-drunk,\" said Balla, picking up an empty flask. \"Come on out. Let me see what I gwi' do wid you?\" he said, scratching his head.  [Illustration: THE OLD MAN WALKED UP TO THE DOOR, AND STANDING ON ONE SIDE FLUNG IT OPEN.]  \"I know what I gwi' do wid you. I gwi' lock you up right whar you is.\"  \"Uncle Balla, s'pose he gets well, won't he get out?\"  \"Ain' _I_ gwi' lock him up? Dat's good from you, who was jes' gwi' let 'im out ef me an' Frank hadn't come up when we did.\"  Willy stepped back abashed. His heart accused him and told him the charge was true. Still he ventured one more question:  \"Hadn't you better take the hens out?\"  \"Nor; 'tain' no use to teck nuttin' out dyah. Ef he comes to, he know we got 'im, an' he dyahson' trouble nuttin'.\"  And the old man pushed to the door and fastened the iron hasp over the strong staple. Then, as the lock had been broken, he took a large nail from his pocket and fastened it in the staple with a stout string so that it could not be shaken out. All the time he was working he was talking to the boys, or rather to himself, for their benefit.  \"Now, you see ef we don' find him heah in the mornin'! Willy jes' gwi' let you get 'way, but a _man_ got you now, wha'ar' been handlin' horses an' know how to hole 'em in the stalls. I boun' he'll have to butt like a ram to git out dis log hen-house,\" he said, finally, as he finished tying the last knot in his string, and gave the door a vigorous rattle to test its strength.  Willy had been too much abashed at his mistake to fully appreciate all of the witticisms over the prisoner, but Frank enjoyed them almost as much as Unc' Balla himself.  \"Now y' all go 'long to bed, an' I'll go back an' teck a little nap myself,\" said he, in parting. \"Ef he gits out that hen-house I'll give you ev'y chicken I got. But he am' _gwine_ git out. A _man's_ done fasten him up dyah.\"  The boys went off to bed, Willy still feeling depressed over his ridiculous mistake. They were soon fast asleep, and if the dogs barked again they did not hear them.  The next thing they knew, Lucy Ann, convulsed with laughter, was telling them a story about Uncle Balla and the man in the hen-house. They jumped up, and pulling on their clothes ran out in the yard, thinking to see the prisoner.  Instead of doing so, they found Uncle Balla standing by the hen-house with a comical look of mystification and chagrin; the roof had been lifted off at one end and not only the prisoner, but every chicken was gone!  The boys were half inclined to cry; Balla's look, however, set them to laughing.  \"Unc' Balla, you got to give me every chicken you got, 'cause you said you would,\" said Willy.  \"Go 'way from heah, boy. Don' pester me when I studyin' to see which way he got out.\"  \"You ain't never had a horse get through the roof before, have you?\" said Frank.  \"Go 'way from here, I tell you,\" said the old man, walking around the house, looking at it.  As the boys went back to wash and dress themselves, they heard Balla explaining to Lucy Ann and some of the other servants that \"the man them chillern let git away had just come back and tooken out the one he had locked up\"; a solution of the mystery he always stoutly insisted upon.  One thing, however, the person's escape effected--it prevented Willy's ever hearing any more of his mistake; but that did not keep him now and then from asking Uncle Balla \"if he had fastened his horses well.\"     CHAPTER VI.   These hens were not the last things stolen from Oakland. Nearly all the men in the country had gone with the army. Indeed, with the exception of a few overseers who remained to work the farms, every man in the neighborhood, between the ages of seventeen and fifty, was in the army. The country was thus left almost wholly unprotected, and it would have been entirely so but for the \"Home Guard,\" as it was called, which was a company composed of young boys and the few old men who remained at home, and who had volunteered for service as a local guard, or police body, for the neighborhood of their homes.  Occasionally, too, later on, a small detachment of men, under a leader known as a \"conscript-officer,\" would come through the country hunting for any men who were subject to the conscript law but who had evaded it, and for deserters who had run away from the army and refused to return.  These two classes of troops, however, stood on a very different footing. The Home Guard was regarded with much respect, for it was composed of those whose extreme age or youth alone withheld them from active service; and every youngster in its ranks looked upon it as a training school, and was ready to die in defence of his home if need were, and, besides, expected to obtain permission to go into the army \"next year.\"  The conscript-guard, on the other hand, were grown men, and were thought to be shirking the very dangers and hardships into which they were trying to force others.  A few miles from Oakland, on the side toward the mountain road and beyond the big woods, lay a district of virgin forest and old-field pines which, even before the war, had acquired a reputation of an unsavory nature, though its inhabitants were a harmless people. No highways ran through this region, and the only roads which entered it were mere wood-ways, filled with bushes and carpeted with pine-tags; and, being travelled only by the inhabitants, appeared to outsiders \"to jes' peter out,\" as the phrase went. This territory was known by the unpromising name of Holetown.  Its denizens were a peculiar but kindly race known to the boys as \"poor white folks,\" and called by the negroes, with great contempt, \"po' white trash.\" Some of them owned small places in the pines; but the majority were simply tenants. They were an inoffensive people, and their worst vices were intemperance and evasion of the tax-laws.  They made their living--or rather, they existed--by fishing and hunting; and, to eke it out, attempted the cultivation of little patches of corn and tobacco near their cabins, or in the bottoms where small branches ran into the stream already mentioned.  In appearance they were usually so thin and sallow that one had to look at them twice to see them clearly. At best, they looked vague and illusive.  They were brave enough. At the outbreak of the war nearly all of the men in this community enlisted, thinking, as many others did, that war was more like play than work, and consisted more of resting than of laboring. Although most of them, when in battle, showed the greatest fearlessness, yet the duties of camp soon became irksome to them, and they grew sick of the restraint and drilling of camp-life; so some of them, when refused a furlough, took it, and came home. Others stayed at home after leave had ended, feeling secure in their stretches of pine and swamp, not only from the feeble efforts of the conscript-guard, but from any parties who might be sent in search of them.  In this way it happened, as time went by, that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26725"],["title","Two Little Confederates (#4)"],["body","became known to harbor a number of deserters.  According to the negroes, it was full of them; and many stories were told about glimpses of men dodging behind trees in the big woods, or rushing away through the underbrush like wild cattle. And, though the grown people doubted whether the negroes had not been startled by some of the hogs, which were quite wild, feeding in the woods, the boys were satisfied that the negroes really had seen deserters.  This became a certainty when there came report after report of these wood-skulkers, and when the conscript-guard, with the brightest of uniforms, rode by with as much show and noise as if on a fox-hunt. Then it became known that deserters were, indeed, infesting the piny district of Holetown, and in considerable numbers.  Some of them, it was said, were pursuing agriculture and all their ordinary vocations as openly as in time of peace, and more industriously. They had a regular code of signals, and nearly every person in the Holetown settlement was in league with them.  When the conscript-guard came along, there would be a rush of tow-headed children through the woods, or some of the women about the cabins would blow a horn lustily; after which not a man could be found in all the district. The horn told just how many men were in the guard, and which path they were following; every member of the troop being honored with a short, quick \"toot.\"  \"What are you blowing-that horn for?\" sternly asked the guard one morning of an old woman,--old Mrs. Hall who stood out in front of her little house blowing like Boreas in the pictures.  \"Jes' blowin' fur Millindy to come to dinner,\" she said, sullenly. \"Can't y' all let a po' 'ooman call her gals to git some'n' to eat? You got all her boys in d'army, killin' 'em; whyn't yo' go and git kilt some yo'self, 'stidder ridin' 'bout heah tromplin' all over po' folk's chickens?\"  When the troop returned in the evening, she was still blowing; \"blowin' fur Millindy to come home,\" she said, with more sharpness than before. But there must have been many Millindys, for horns were sounding all through the settlement.  The deserters, at such times, were said to take to the swamps, and marvellous rumors were abroad of one or more caves, all fitted up, wherein they concealed themselves, like the robbers in the stories the boys were so fond of reading.  After a while thefts of pigs and sheep became so common that they were charged to the deserters.  Finally it grew to be such a pest that the ladies in the neighborhood asked the Home Guard to take action in the matter, and after some delay it became known that this valorous body was going to invade Holetown and capture the deserters or drive them away. Hugh was to accompany them, of course; and he looked very handsome, as well as very important, when he started out on horseback to join the troop. It was his first active service; and with his trousers in his boots and his pistol in his belt he looked as brave as Julius Cæsar, and quite laughed at his mother's fears for him, as she kissed him good-bye and walked out with him to his horse, which Balla held at the gate.  The boys asked leave to go with him; but Hugh was so scornful over their request, and looked so soldierly as he galloped away with the other men that the boys felt as cheap as possible.     CHAPTER VII.   When the boys went into the house they found that their Aunt Mary had a headache that morning, and, even with the best intentions of doing her duty in teaching them, had been forced to go to bed. Their mother was too much occupied with her charge of providing for a family of over a dozen white persons, and five times as many colored dependents, to give any time to acting as substitute in the school-room, so the boys found themselves with a holiday before them. It seemed vain to try to shoot duck on the creek, and the perch were averse to biting. The boys accordingly determined to take both guns and to set out for a real hunt in the big woods.  They received their mother's permission, and after a lunch was prepared they started in high glee, talking about the squirrels and birds they expected to kill.  Frank had his gun, and Willy had the musket; and both carried a plentiful supply of powder and some tolerably round slugs made from cartridges.  They usually hunted in the part of the woods nearest the house, and they knew that game was not very abundant there; so, as a good long day was before them, they determined to go over to the other side of the woods.  They accordingly pushed on, taking a path which led through the forest. They went entirely through the big woods without seeing anything but one squirrel, and presently found themselves at the extreme edge of Holetown. They were just grumbling at the lack of game when they heard a distant horn. The sound came from perhaps a mile or more away, but was quite distinct.  \"What's that? Somebody fox-hunting?--or is it a dinner-horn?\" asked Willy, listening intently.  \"It's a horn to warn deserters, that's what 'tis,\" said Frank, pleased to show his superior knowledge.  \"I tell you what to do:--let's go and hunt deserters,\" said Willy, eagerly.  \"All right. Won't that be fun!\" and both boys set out down the road toward a point where they knew one of the paths ran into the pine-district, talking of the numbers of prisoners they expected to take.  In an instant they were as alert and eager as young hounds on a trail. They had mapped out a plan before, and they knew exactly what they had to do. Frank was the captain, by right of his being older; and Willy was lieutenant, and was to obey orders. The chief thing that troubled them was that they did not wish to be seen by any of the women or children about the cabins, for they all knew the boys, because they were accustomed to come to Oakland for supplies; then, too, the boys wished to remain on friendly terms with their neighbors. Another thing worried them. They did not know what to do with their prisoners after they should have captured them. However, they pushed on and soon came to a dim cart-way, which ran at right-angles to the main road and which went into the very heart of Holetown. Here they halted to reconnoitre and to inspect their weapons.  Even from the main road, the track, as it led off through the overhanging woods with thick underbrush of chinquapin bushes, appeared to the boys to have something strange about it, though they had at other times walked it from end to end. Still, they entered boldly, clutching their guns. Willy suggested that they should go in Indian file and that the rear one should step in the other's footprints as the Indians do; but Frank thought it was best to walk abreast, as the Indians walked in their peculiar way only to prevent an enemy who crossed their trail from knowing how many they were; and, so far from it being any disadvantage for the deserters to know _their_ number, it was even better that they should know there were two, so that they would not attack from the rear. Accordingly, keeping abreast, they struck in; each taking the woods on one side of the road, which he was to watch and for which he was to be responsible.  The farther they went the more indistinct the track became, and the wilder became the surrounding woods. They proceeded with great caution, examining every particularly thick clump of bushes; peeping behind each very large tree; and occasionally even taking a glance up among its boughs; for they had themselves so often planned how, if pursued, they would climb trees and conceal themselves, that they would not have been at all surprised to find a fierce deserter, armed to the teeth, crouching among the branches.  Though they searched carefully every spot where a deserter could possibly lurk, they passed through the oak woods and were deep in the pines without having seen any foe or heard a noise which could possibly proceed from one. A squirrel had daringly leaped from the trunk of a hickory-tree and run into the woods, right before them, stopping impudently to take a good look at them; but they were hunting larger game than squirrels, and they resisted the temptation to take a shot at him,--an exercise of virtue which brought them a distinct feeling of pleasure. They were, however, beginning to be embarrassed as to their next course. They could hear the dogs barking farther on in the pines, and knew they were approaching the vicinity of the settlement; for they had crossed the little creek which ran through a thicket of elder bushes and \"gums,\" and which marked the boundary of Holetown. Little paths, too, every now and then turned off from the main track and went into the pines, each leading to a cabin or bit of creek-bottom deeper in. They therefore were in a real dilemma concerning what to do; and Willy's suggestion, to eat lunch, was a welcome one. They determined to go a little way into the woods, where they could not be seen, and had just taken the lunch out of the game-bag and were turning into a by-path, when they met a man who was coming along at a slow, lounging walk, and carrying a long single-barrelled shot-gun across his arm.  When first they heard him, they thought he might be a deserter; but when he came nearer they saw that he was simply a countryman out hunting; for his old game-bag (from which peeped a squirrel's tail) was over his shoulder, and he had no weapon at all, excepting that old squirrel-gun.  \"Good morning, sir,\" said both boys, politely.  \"Mornin'! What luck y' all had?\" he asked good-naturedly, stopping and putting the butt of his gun on the ground, and resting lazily on it, preparatory to a chat.  \"We're not hunting; we're hunting deserters.\"  \"Huntin' deserters!\" echoed the man with a smile which broke into a chuckle of amusement as the thought worked its way into his brain. \"Ain't you see' none?\"  \"No,\" said both boys in a breath, greatly pleased at his friendliness. \"Do you know where any are?\"  The man scratched his head, seeming to"]]]
