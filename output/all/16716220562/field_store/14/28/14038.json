When you get to the Antares we'll give each of the boys a full shot of kwil. The ones that don't go limp on it can start helping.\"  Dr. Egavine said reflectively, \"You feel the drug would still be a requirement?\"  \"Well,\" Dasinger said, \"Hovig appears to have been a man who took precautions, too. We know he had three generators and that he set off one of them. The question is where the other two are. It wouldn't be so very surprising, would it, if one or both of them turned out to be waiting for intruders in the vault where he sealed away the loot?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The night was cool. Wind rustled in the ground vegetation and the occasional patches of trees. Otherwise the slopes were quiet. The sky was covered with cloud layers through which the Mooncat drifted invisibly. In the infrared glasses Dasinger had slipped on when he started, the rocky hillside showed clear for two hundred yards, tinted green as though bathed by a strange moonlight; beyond was murky darkness.  \"Still all right?\" Duomart's voice inquired from the wrist communicator.  \"Uh-huh!\" Dasinger said. \"A little nervous, but I'd be feeling that way in any case, under the circumstances.\"  \"I'm not so sure,\" she said. \"You've gone past the two and a half mile line from the generator. From what that Graylock monster said, you should have started to pick up its effects. Why not take your shot, and play safe?\"  \"No,\" Dasinger said. \"If I wait until I feel something that can be definitely attributed to the machine, I can keep the kwil dose down to what I need. I don't want to load myself up with the drug any more than I have to.\"  A stand of tall trees with furry trunks moved presently into range of the glasses, thick undergrowth beneath. Dasinger picked his way through the thickets with some caution. The indications so far had been that local animals had as much good reason to avoid the vicinity of Hovig's machine as human beings, but if there was any poisonous vermin in the area this would be a good place for it to be lurking. Which seemed a fairly reasonable apprehension. Other, equally definite, apprehensions looked less reasonable when considered objectively. If he stumbled on a stone, it produced a surge of sharp alarm which lingered for seconds; and his breathing had quickened much more than could be accounted for by the exertions of the downhill climb.         *       *       *       *       *  Five minutes beyond the wood Dasinger emerged from the mouth of a narrow gorge, and stopped short with a startled exclamation. His hand dug hurriedly into his pocket for the case of kwil needles.  \"What's the matter?\" Duomart inquired sharply.  Dasinger produced a somewhat breathless laugh. \"I've decided to take the kwil. At once!\"  \"You're feeling ... things?\" Her voice was also shaky.  \"I'll say! Not just a matter of feeling it, either. For example, a couple of old friends are walking towards me at the moment. Dead ones, as it happens.\"  \"Ugh!\" she said faintly. \"Hurry up!\"  Dasinger shoved the needle's plunger a quarter of the way down on the kwil solution, pulled the needle out of his arm. He stood still for some seconds, filled his lungs with the cool night air, let it out in a long sigh.  \"That did it!\" he announced, his voice steadying again. \"The stuff works fast. A quarter shot....\"  \"Why did you wait so long?\"  \"It wasn't too bad till just now. Then suddenly ... that generator can't be putting out evenly! Anyway, it hit me like a rock. I doubt you'd be interested in details.\"  \"I wouldn't,\" Duomart agreed. \"I'm crawly enough as it is up here. I wish we were through with this!\"  \"With just a little luck we should be off the planet in an hour.\"  By the time he could hear the lapping of the lake water on the wind, he was aware of the growing pulse of Hovig's generator ahead of him, alive and malignant in the night. Then the Fleet scout came into the glasses, a squat, dark ship, its base concealed in the growth that had sprung up around it after it piled up on the slope. Dasinger moved past the scout, pushing through bushy aromatic shrubbery which thickened as he neared the water. He felt physically sick and sluggish now, was aware, too, of an increasing reluctance to go on. He would need more of the drug before attempting to enter the Antares.  To the west, the sky was partly clear, and presently he saw the wreck of the Dosey Asteroids raider loom up over the edge of the lake arm, blotting out a section of stars. Still beyond the field of the glasses, it looked like an armored water animal about to crawl up on the slopes. Dasinger approached slowly, in foggy unwillingness, emerged from the bushes into open ground, and saw a broad ramp furred with a thick coat of moldlike growth rise steeply towards an open lock in the upper part of the Antares. The pulse of the generator might have been the beating of the maimed ship's heart, angry and threatening. It seemed to be growing stronger. And had something moved in the lock? Dasinger stood, senses swimming sickly, dreaming that something huge rose slowly, towered over him like a giant wave, leaned forwards....         *       *       *       *       *  \"Still all right?\" Duomart inquired.  The wave broke.  \"_Dasinger! What's happened?_\"  \"Nothing,\" Dasinger said, his voice raw. He pulled the empty needle out of his arm, dropped it. \"But something nearly did! The kwil I took wasn't enough. I was standing here waiting to let that damned machine swamp me when you spoke.\"  \"You should have heard what you sounded like over the communicator! I thought you were ...\" her voice stopped for an instant, began again. \"Anyway,\" she said briskly, \"you're loaded with kwil now, I hope?\"  \"More than I should be, probably.\" Dasinger rubbed both hands slowly down along his face. \"Well, it couldn't be helped. That was pretty close, I guess! I don't even remember getting the hypo out of the case.\"  He looked back up at the looming bow of the Antares, unbeautiful enough but prosaically devoid of menace and mystery now, though the pulsing beat still came from there. A mechanical obstacle and nothing else. \"I'm going on in now.\"  From the darkness within the lock came the smell of stagnant water, of old decay. The mold that proliferated over the ramp did not extend into the wreck. But other things grew inside, pale and oily tendrils festooning the walls. Dasinger removed his night glasses, brought out a pencil light, let the beam fan out, and moved through the lock.  The crash which had crumpled the ship's lower shell had thrust up the flooring of the lock compartment, turned it into what was nearly level footing now. On the right, a twenty-foot black gap showed between the ragged edge of the deck and the far bulkhead from which it had been torn. The oily plant life spread over the edges of the flooring and on down into the flooded lower sections of the Antares. The pulse of Hovig's generator came from above and the left where a passage slanted steeply up into the ship's nose. Dasinger turned towards the passage, began clambering up.         *       *       *       *       *  There was no guesswork involved in determining which of the doors along the passage hid the machine in what, if Graylock's story was correct, had been Hovig's personal stateroom. As Dasinger approached that point, it was like climbing into silent thunder. The door was locked, and though the walls beside it were warped and cracked, the cracks were too narrow to permit entry. Dasinger dug out a tool which had once been the prized property of one of Orado's more eminent safecrackers, and went to work on the lock. A minute or two later he forced the door partly back in its tilted frame, scrambled through into the cabin.  Not enough was left of Hovig after this span of time to be particularly offensive. The generator lay in a lower corner, half buried under other molded and unrecognizable debris. Dasinger uncovered it, feeling as if he were drowning in the invisible torrent pouring out from it, knelt down and placed the light against the wall beside him.  The machine matched Graylock's description. A pancake-shaped heavy plastic casing eighteen inches across, two thick studs set into its edge, one stud depressed and flush with the surface, the other extended. Dasinger thumbed experimentally at the extended stud, found it apparently immovable, took out his gun.  \"How is it going, Dasinger?\" Miss Mines asked.  \"All right,\" Dasinger said. He realized he was speaking with difficulty. \"I've found the thing! Trying to get it shut off now. Tell you in a minute....\"  He tapped the extended stud twice with the butt of the gun, then slashed heavily down. The stud flattened back into the machine. Its counterpart didn't move. The drowning sensations continued.  Dasinger licked his lips, dropped the gun into his pocket, brought out the lock opener. He had the generator's cover plate pried partway back when it shattered. With that, the thunder that wasn't sound ebbed swiftly from the cabin. Dasinger reached into the generator, wrenched out a power battery, snapping half a dozen leads.  He sat back on his heels, momentarily dizzy with relief, then climbed to his feet with the smashed components of Hovig's machine, and turned to the door. Something in the debris along the wall flashed dazzlingly in the beam of his light.  Dasinger stared at the star hyacinth for an instant, then picked it up. It was slightly larger than the one Graylock had carried out of the Antares with him, perfectly cut. He found four others of similar quality within the next minute, started back down to the lock compartment with what might amount to two million credits in honest money, around half that in the Hub's underworld gem trade, in one of his pockets.  \"Yes?\"  \"Got the thing's teeth pulled now.\"  \"Thank God! Coming right down....\"  The Mooncat was sliding in from the south as Dasinger "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26292"],["title","The Star Hyacinths (#7)"],["body","out on the head of the ramp. \"Lock's open,\" Duomart's voice informed him. \"I'll come aft and help.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It took four trips with the gravity crane to transfer the salvage equipment into the Antares's lock compartment. Then Miss Mines sealed the Mooncat and went back upstairs. Dasinger climbed into one of the three salvage suits, hung the wrist communicator inside the helmet, snapped on the suit's lights and went over to the edge of the compartment deck. Black water reflected the lights thirty feet below. He checked the assortment of tools attached to his belt, nudged the suit's gravity cutoff to the right, energized magnetic pads on knees, boot tips and wrists, then fly-walked rapidly down a bulkhead and dropped into the water.  \"No go, Duomart!\" he informed the girl ten minutes later, his voice heavy with disappointment. \"It's an ungodly twisted mess down here ... worse than I thought it might be! Looks as if we'll have to cut all the way through to that vault. Give Egavine the signal to start herding the boys down.\"  Approximately an hour afterwards, Miss Mines reported urgently through the communicator, \"They'll reach the lock in less than four minutes now, Dasinger! Better drop it and come up!\"  \"I'm on my way.\" Dasinger reluctantly switched off the beam-saw he was working with, fastened it to the belt of the salvage suit, turned in the murky water and started back towards the upper sections of the wreck. The job of getting through the tangled jungle of metal and plastic to the gem vault appeared no more than half completed, and the prospect of being delayed over it until the Spy discovered them here began to look like a disagreeably definite possibility. He clambered and floated hurriedly up through the almost vertical passage he'd cleared, found daylight flooding the lock compartment, the system's yellow sun well above the horizon. Peeling off the salvage suit, he restored the communicator to his wrist and went over to the head of the ramp.         *       *       *       *       *  The five men came filing down the last slopes in the morning light, Taunus and Calat in the lead, Graylock behind them, the winged animal riding his shoulder and lifting occasionally into the air to flutter about the group. Quist and Egavine brought up the rear. Dasinger took the gun from his pocket.  \"I'll clip my gun to the suit belt when I go back down in the water with the boys,\" he told the communicator. \"If the doctor's turning any tricks over in his mind, that should give him food for thought. I'll relieve Quist of his weapon as he comes in.\"  \"What about the guns in Graylock's hut?\" Duomart asked.  \"No charge left in them. If I'm reasonably careful, I really don't see what Dr. Egavine can do. He knows he loses his half-interest in the salvage the moment he pulls any illegal stunts.\"  A minute or two later, he called out, \"Hold it there, doctor?\"  The group shuffled to a stop near the foot of the ramp, staring up at him.  \"Yes, Dasinger?\" Dr. Egavine called back, sounding a trifle winded.  \"Have Quist come up first and alone, please.\" Dasinger disarmed the little man at the entrance to the lock, motioned him on to the center of the compartment. The others arrived then in a line, filed past Dasinger and joined Quist.  \"You've explained the situation to everybody?\" Dasinger asked Egavine. There was an air of tenseness about the little group he didn't like, though tension might be understandable enough under the circumstances.  \"Yes,\" Dr. Egavine said. \"They feel entirely willing to assist us, of course.\" He smiled significantly.  \"Fine.\" Dasinger nodded. \"Line them up and let's get going! Taunus first. Get ...\"  There was a momentary stirring of the air back of his head. He turned sharply, jerking up the gun, felt twin needles drive into either side of his neck.  His body instantly went insensate. The lock appeared to circle about him, then he was on his back and Graylock's pet was alighting with a flutter of wings on his chest. It craned its head forward to peer into his face, the tip of its mouth tube open, showing a ring of tiny teeth. Vision and awareness left Dasinger together.  The other men hadn't moved. Now Dr. Egavine, his face a little pale, came over to Dasinger, the birdlike creature bounding back to the edge of the lock as he approached. Egavine knelt down, said quietly, his mouth near the wrist communicator, \"Duomart Mines, you will obey me.\"  There was silence for a second or two. Then the communicator whispered, \"Yes.\"  Dr. Egavine drew in a long, slow breath.  \"You feel no question, no concern, no doubt about this situation,\" he went on. \"You will bring the ship down now and land it safely beside the Antares. Then come up into the lock of the Antares for further instructions.\" Egavine stood up, his eyes bright with triumph.         *       *       *       *       *  In the Mooncat three miles overhead, Duomart switched off her wrist communicator, sat white-faced, staring at the image of the Antares in the ground-view plate.  \"Sweet Jana!\" she whispered. \"How did he ... now what do I ...\"  She hesitated an instant, then opened a console drawer, took out the kwil needle Dasinger had left with her and slipped it into a pocket, clipped the holstered shocker back to her belt, and reached for the controls. A vast whistling shriek smote the Antares and the ears of those within as the Mooncat ripped down through atmosphere at an unatmospheric speed, leveled out smoothly and floated to the ground beside the wreck.  There was no one in sight in the lock of the Antares as Duomart came out and sealed the Mooncat's entry behind her. She went quickly up the broad, mold-covered ramp. The lock remained empty. From beyond it came the sound of some metallic object being pulled about, a murmur of voices. Twelve steps from the top, she took out the little gun, ran up to the lock and into it, bringing the gun up. She had a glimpse of Dr. Egavine and Quist standing near a rusty bench in the compartment, of Graylock half into a salvage suit, Dasinger on the floor ... then a flick of motion to right and left.  The tips of two space lines lashed about her simultaneously, one pinning her arms to her sides, the other clamping about her ankles and twitching her legs out from beneath her. She fired twice blindly to the left as the lines snapped her face down to the floor of the compartment. The gun was clamped beneath her stretched-out body and useless.         *       *       *       *       *  \"What made that animal attack me anyway?\" Dasinger asked wearily. He had just regained consciousness and been ordered by Calat to join the others on a rusted metal bench in the center of the lock compartment; Duomart to his left, Egavine on his right, Quist on the other side of Egavine. Calat stood watching them fifteen feet away, holding Dasinger's gun in one hand while he jiggled a few of Hovig's star hyacinths gently about in the other.  Calat's expression was cheerful, which made him the exception here. Liu Taunus and Graylock were down in the hold of the ship, working sturdily with cutter beams and power hoists to get to the sealed vault and blow it open. How long they'd been at it, Dasinger didn't know.  \"You can thank your double-crossing partner for what happened!\" Duomart informed him. She looked pretty thoroughly mussed up though still unsubdued. \"Graylock's been using the bird-thing to hunt with,\" she said. \"It's a bloodsucker ... nicks some animal with its claws and the animal stays knocked out while the little beast fills its tummy. So the intellectual over there had Graylock point you out to his pet, and it waited until your back was turned....\" She hesitated, went on less vehemently, \"Sorry about not carrying out orders, Dasinger. I assumed Egavine really was in control here, and I could have handled _him_. I walked into a trap.\" She fished the shards of a smashed kwil needle out of her pocket, looked at them, and dropped them on the floor before her. \"I got slammed around a little,\" she explained.  Calat laughed, said something in the Fleet tongue, grinning at her. She ignored him.  Egavine said, \"My effects were secretly inspected while we were at the Fleet station, Dasinger, and the Fleetmen have been taking drugs to immunize themselves against my hypnotic agents. They disclosed this when Miss Mines brought the speedboat down. There was nothing I could do. I regret to say that they intend to murder us. They are waiting only to assure themselves that the star hyacinths actually are in the indicated compartment.\"  \"Great!\" Dasinger groaned. He put his hands back in a groping gesture to support himself on the bench.  \"Still pretty feeble, I suppose?\" Miss Mines inquired, gentle sympathy in her voice.  \"I'm poisoned,\" he muttered brokenly. \"The thing's left me paralyzed....\" He sagged sideways a little, his hand moving behind Duomart. He pinched her then in a markedly unparalyzed and vigorous manner.  Duomart's right eyelid flickered for an instant.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Somebody wrung the little monster's neck before I got here,\" she remarked. \"But there're other necks _I'd_ sooner wring! Your partner's, for instance. Not that he's necessarily the biggest louse around at the moment.\" She nodded at Calat. \"The two runches who call themselves Fleetmen don't intend to share the star hyacinths even with their own gang! They're rushing the job through so they can be on their way to the Hub before the Spy arrives. And don't think Liu Taunus trusts that muscle-bound foogal standing there, either! He's hanging on to the key of the Mooncat's console until he comes back up.\"  Calat smiled with a suggestion of strain, then said something in a flat, expressionless voice, staring at her.  \"Oh, sure,\" she returned. \"With Taunus holding me, I suppose?\" She looked at Dasinger. \"They're not shooting _me_ right off, you know,\" she told him. \"They're annoyed with me, so they're"]]]
