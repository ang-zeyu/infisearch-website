They required little urging, the officers' words of encouragement being quite perfunctory although well-intentioned.  In open order with flankers thrown out the Waffs hurried through the bush, the sound of continuous rifle-fire growing louder and louder.  \"Button's holding out all right,\" declared the company-major to Wilmshurst, referring to the lieutenant left in charge of the camp. \"He has MacGregor and young Vipont to back him up and twenty-five Haussas.  Hullo, what's that?\"  \"German machine-guns, sir,\" replied Wilmshurst promptly.  \"Yes, worse luck,\" resumed the major.  \"We've been running after the shadow and the substance butts in during our absence.\"  An orderly came dashing up with a written message.  The major's face fell as he read it.  \"We're out of it again, Wilmshurst,\" he remarked, after the runner had been sent back with a confirmatory report.  \"How's that, sir?\" asked the subaltern.  \"Orders from the colonel for 'A' Company to hold the position shown on the attached map, and to cut off the retreat of the enemy.  Here we are: see this kloof?  Three platoons are to lie in ambush at that spot, another--yours, Mr. Wilmshurst--will take up a position two miles to the north-west, in case any stragglers attempt to break through the smaller defile shown on the map.  It looks nothing more than a native path.  We'll find that out later on.\"  At the word of command \"A\" Company halted until the rest of the battalion was almost out of sight.  Then the detachment, moving to the right in column of fours, marched at a rapid pace along a comparatively clear path through the scrub.  When the three platoons had taken up their position at the indicated spot Wilmshurst's platoon had still a distance of two miles to cover--and that two miles was the roughest part of the whole day's march.  It was a disused track possibly dating back to the old days when the Arab slave-raiders traversed the greater part of Central Africa in search of \"black ivory,\" and was now greatly overgrown by cacti and other fibrous plants.  Here and there palm trees had fallen completely across the path, while in no part was it more than a yard in breadth, being hedged in on both sides by dense tropical vegetation. And yet the track was distinctly marked upon the German-compiled maps with which the British troops were working.  It was hardly a route that any European under ordinary circumstances would tackle under the glaring heat of the afternoon's sun. Mosquitoes--harbingers of malaria--and fire-flies buzzed in swarms, snakes and lizards, their hitherto undisturbed solitude rudely shaken by the stealthy patter of three score pairs of bare feet, wriggled across the swampy ground, while overhead thousands of frightened birds flew in large circles, chattering the while in a way that would alarm every Boche within a radius of three miles.  A mile and a half of this sort of marching--the Haussas were in single file--and the platoon emerged into a wider track running obliquely across the path they had taken.  Halting his men Wilmshurst, assisted by Sergeant Bela Moshi, examined the ground.  There were evidences that a number of European and native troops had passed, going in the opposite direction to the Waffs' bivouac, while what was somewhat remarkable there were more recent tracks of a horse's hoofs.  \"Him am gov'ment horse, sah,\" declared the sergeant.  \"Him lib for go plenty fast no time,\" meaning that the animal was a British Army mount (this from the peculiar shape of the horse-shoe prints) and had passed by quite recently.  \"Probably Sutton dispatched a mounted orderly to summon help,\" thought Wilmshurst.  \"In that case the fellow's taken the wrong track.  He'll be back shortly.  Hope it will be before Fritz ambles along here--if it's our luck that the Huns do retire this way.\"  Two hundred yards further on the scrub became quite scanty in a wide belt that terminated in a low range of hills.  The slopes of the rising ground were fairly steep except at a gap in the centre, where a deep ravine had been utilized by the makers of the road.  It was an ideal spot for an ambuscade.  Sheltering behind the cacti that abundantly covered the hill the Haussas could extend on a fairly broad front, and concentrate a heavy fire upon any enemy retiring along the path.  The maxim on its tripod mounting was set up to enable it to sweep the expected column with an oblique fire, its panther-skin encased water-jacket being camouflaged by foliage carefully placed so as not to obstruct the sights.  Hardly were these preparations completed when, with a terrific roar and a tremendous cloud of dust, an explosive missile burst within two hundred yards of the platoon's position.  \"Dash it all!\" ejaculated Wilmshurst.  \"That's a thundering big shell. Keep down, men.\"  The Haussas in natural and childlike curiosity were craning their necks to see the unexpected sight.  Just then a loud buzzing sound came from immediately overhead.  At the risk of being blinded by the terrific glare the subaltern glanced aloft to see a large seaplane that, having completed a long volplane, had restarted its engine.  By the conspicuous marks on the wings and fuselage Wilmshurst made the disconcerting discovery that the aircraft was a British machine, and that it was diligently engaged in attempting to bomb the Waffs out of existence under the mistaken idea that they were an enemy patrol.  \"That's done it!\" muttered Wilmshurst.  \"The silly joker has put the kybosh on our chances of surprising the Boches.  Lucky if we escape being hit with some of the infernal eggs!\"  With difficulty restraining the Haussas from opening fire, for they would not be convinced that the \"great buzz-bird\" could possibly make a mistake, and that it must be a Boche machine, Dudley awaited developments, watching with decided apprehension the seaplane circling to take up a favourable position for another bomb-dropping effort.  The second missile burst in a donga a hundred yards to the rear of the Haussas' line, while a few seconds later a third exploded at half that distance again on the Waffs' flank.  Wilmshurst was now sarcastically interested.  \"If you can't do better than that, old son,\" he chuckled, \"you'd better hook it.  My word, if ever I meet you on terra firma, I won't forget to chip you.\"  The ineffectual strafing continued for nearly a quarter of an hour.  At the end of that time the airmen, either discovering their mistake or else having been called up by wireless to attack more numerous forces, desisted from their present operations.  Banking steeply the seaplane bore away rapidly in a south-easterly direction, and was soon a mere speck in the azure sky.  Followed a long period of inaction on the part of the Haussas.  Scarce daring to move lest a keen-eyed Askari should detect their presence, the Waffs hugged the sun-baked earth until the lengthening shadows warned them of the approach of night.  The distant firing had passed from rapid volleys through desultory exchange of shots to a complete cessation.  The rest of \"A\" Company were not engaged, so it appeared to the still hopeful Haussas that their foes had effected a retreat in a different direction from that expected.  With the fall of night a large hostile detachment might easily slip through the scantily-held lines, and that accounted for the uneasy glances that the Waffs gave at the declining orb of day.  \"Hist, sah!\" exclaimed Beta Moshi.  \"Dey come.\"  With every sense keenly on the alert Wilmshurst strove to detect the approach of the foe.  Already the men had slipped clips of cartridges into the magazines of their rifles, and, the exact range being known, had set sights to eight hundred yards, at which distance the retiring Huns would be on slightly-sloping ground practically destitute of cover.  A cloud of dust rising sullenly in the still air marked the approach of the column.  The Huns were moving rapidly, although there were no sounds to indicate that they were fighting a rear-guard action, while there were no signs of any advance guard.  \"We've got them cold,\" exclaimed Wilmshurst, gleefully, then, \"No. 1 Section, volley firing, ready.\"  Suddenly a shot rang out away on the left front of the concealed Haussas.  \"Who the deuce fired that?\" thought the subaltern angrily, vowing to make it hot for the luckless black who could not keep control over his itching trigger finger.  The mischief was done.  At the warning shot the retiring enemy stopped short almost in the jaws of the trap that awaited them; then at a hot pace they disappeared into the bush to be swallowed up in the rapidly deepening night.  \"Find out who fired that shot, sergeant,\" ordered Wilmshurst.  Bela Moshi's efforts were unavailing.  Even when the platoon was paraded and every man's rifle examined the culprit was not discovered.  \"Jolly rummy,\" mused the subaltern.  \"It's a dead cert that none of my men fired.  Some one did.  Why and for what reason?\"  Fired with anger at the futile ending to their tedious efforts the Haussas sent a deputation to the young officer offering to search the bush in the direction from which the shot came, for the men of the extreme left flank were emphatic in their belief that they heard the sounds of booted feet after the report.  \"Off you go, then,\" replied Wilmshurst.  \"Hurry back if you hear the 'Fall in.'\"  The two men selected--Tari Barl and No Go--lost no time in starting upon their hazardous quest.  Armed only with their bayonets the Haussas vanished into the darkness.  Another period of tension ensued.  The tropical heat of the day gave place to intense cold as the parched earth rapidly radiated its heat. Presently the stars began to glimmer in the firmament, their brightness increasing to their full splendour of an African night.  Still no message came for the platoon to fall back upon the rest of \"A\" Company.  Vaguely Wilmshurst began to wonder whether the outlying Waffs "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26670"],["title","Making a Fireplace (#0)"],["body","A                                FIREPLACE                            _By_ HENRY H.

That will be taken for granted. It is enough to say that in these days a home can scarcely be considered worthy of the name if it does not contain at least one hearth. There is some inexplicable quality in a wood fire that exerts almost a hypnotic influence upon those who eagerly gather about it. The smoldering glow of the logs induces a calm and introspective mood that banishes all the trivialities and distractions of the day’s work and gives one an opportunity to replenish his store of energy for the coming day.  The open fire, unlike most of the comforts that we demand in a modern home, has been associated with the race as far back almost as the home itself. At first, of course, it was as a necessity and the development from that to a luxury has been an exceedingly slow one extending over the years down to the present time.  There are two forms of the open fire—a possible third one, the gas log, being a subject on which the less said the better. We have, therefore, a choice between the open fireplace designed for wood and the basket grate in which to burn coal, preferably cannel coal. This latter fuel is not nearly so well known in this country as in England where the scarcity of wood necessarily makes coal the more commonly used fuel. With our own abundance of wood, however, there will perhaps be little hesitancy in choosing the open fireplace rather than the basket grate for coal, although in certain cases, for example an apartment where the flue has been built too small, or in a house where an available chimney offers only a small flue area for fireplace use, the basket grate will prove a welcome solution of the problem. Of course there is no excuse whatever for building a modern home with a chimney too small for the sort of fireplace you want, but where the chimney has already been built without this provision it may possibly be found that a small terra cotta flue lining may be inserted in the larger flue without seriously damaging the latter’s power of draft. In that event the addition of a basket grate fireplace to an old house would be an interesting possibility.  However fully we may appreciate the desirability of some sort of fireplace, there seems to be a rather widespread impression that the attainment is largely a matter of chance. Too many home-builders have instructed their architects to provide a fireplace or two in the fond hope that the matter was then practically closed—a mere matter of time until they might be sitting before the fire’s cheerful glow. Too frequently the result has been a disappointment when the first few trials introduced into the room more smoke than heat or cheer. The reason for this is that there is a scientific basis for fireplace building which is frequently ignored absolutely by an over-confident and stupid mason. Where the work of building the home has been entrusted to an architect’s hands the latter usually appreciates the fact that the building of the fireplaces is liable more than any other part of the house to be taken into the mason’s own hands with, if he is not watched, disastrous results. Undoubtedly every mason would resent most strongly any insinuation as to his lack of knowledge regarding fireplace construction. Each mason not only thinks that he knows how a fireplace should be built, but it is almost as general a rule that he feels that his particular method is the only correct one.      [Illustration: One of the best forms of the basket grate in     brass. The splayed sides send out more heat]      [Illustration: A modern English fire corner. Facing and hearth     have been worked out in a rather startling contrast of tiles]   In view of this it might be well for any man building his own home to give some attention to the matter of his fireplaces, to insist on knowing how they are designed and to follow their construction throughout so that there is no chance for a blunder; and this chance is not so slight as might be supposed. In a house in which the author had carefully shown every detail of construction in the drawings, it was found when the building was nearly completed that the cast-iron throat flues, which ordinarily prevent any possible mistake of construction on the mason’s part, had been put in reversed and it was necessary to tear down the whole face of the chimney breast in each case to replace them properly.  The matter of construction is not at all a complicated affair, as the next chapter will aim to show.                                  CONSTRUCTION   The chief difficulty in attaining a successful fireplace design does not lie in securing an abundant draft. In fact it is an easy matter to make a fireplace draw if the flue is large enough and the opening from the fire chamber into the flue unobstructed. There will never be any question of getting a roaring blaze the moment the fire is lighted.  This is, in a way, the type of fireplace that our Colonial ancestors built—great cavernous openings and generous flues, with the result that the more wood was piled upon the blaze the more they blistered their toes and at the same time chilled their backs. For it is evident that when we secure such a strong, unobstructed current of hot air up the chimney, enough cool air to take its place must be drawn into the room through every opening and crevice. The result is a mighty draft that rushes past those unfortunate enough to be sitting about the fire and carries rapidly up the chimney almost all of the heat of combustion.  In the fireplace of our Colonial ancestors probably ninety per cent. of the heat was entirely lost, being carried up the chimney. However, cord wood was then to be had for the cutting.  We want a different sort of a fire in these days—one that will burn with a steady, constant blaze or glow, conserving most of its heat, which the back and sides of the fire chamber will reflect out into the room.  Such a fireplace will not necessarily be a large one. It is amusing to hear how universally the demand goes up for large fireplaces—“great big fellows that will burn full cord wood.” It is hard to see just why this is. It may be based on the assumption that if a small fireplace is desirable a large one is more so. This is a fallacy that the architect and fireplace builder find it hard to dispel. There is no objection whatever to a large fireplace in a summer camp or informal shack of that sort. In fact a small one would in such a place be ridiculous, but when we come to our year-round living-room or dining-room or den, where the walls of the room are tight and the whole atmosphere quieter and more restrained, a large fireplace would be distinctly a disturbing element. Such a room as this, unless very poorly built, would not permit the in-take of sufficient air for the draft of a big fireplace, whereas in our slab cabin or log bungalow the conditions are quite different.      [Illustration: A section through the fireplace and chimney. The     broad cross-hatching represents brickwork]  For the ordinary room, therefore, a fair average size for the fireplace opening is three feet in width by two and a half feet high, with a depth half the width. From such a fireplace it is possible to get a maximum of heat with a minimum of draft.  There are two vital principles that should be observed in the design of any fireplace. One of these is the relation between the size of the opening into the room and the size of the flue itself. A cross-section of the flue—which incidentally should be kept the same throughout its extent—should be one-tenth of the area of the opening into the room. The second vital consideration is the introduction of what are known as a “smoke shelf” and a “smoke chamber.” The reason for constructing a fireplace with these two features will appear more readily by reference to the diagram. This is drawn to show that when a fire is kindled on the hearth the warm air current, which is generated immediately, begins to rise through the"]]]
