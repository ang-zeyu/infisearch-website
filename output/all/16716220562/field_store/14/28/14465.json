In the latter case I remembered reading that the \"Unter den linden\" had been widened by the process of pushing the dwellings back until they each housed 60 families. Germany, on this occasion, had grabbed the idea but missed the spirit, in the absence of which town planning is merely a name.  Even the manufactures of Germany had been built upon those of other countries. There was a case I recalled, that of the Australian cordial manufacturer, who desired to introduce his stuff into Germany. He was met with a stiff tariff, but informed that if he established a factory there there would be no need to import it. Why, now I came to remember it, even the original \"Rush-on-Paris\" plan was stolen. Hilaire Belloc, the Anglicised Frenchman, had written of it in the \"London\" Magazine, of May, 1912. When that plan failed what had Germany done? Why, dug itself in on the Aisne!  The idea of the German submarine raids was not original, as it formed the base of a story by Sir Conan Doyle that appeared in the English \"Strand Magazine\" and in the American \"Colliers' Weekly\" many months before!  Germany, in fact, built its fame on assiduous imitation rather than originality. But at what cost? Its people had degenerated in the process from thinking humans to dumb, driven cattle, going, going, for ever going, but non-comprehending the why or the wherefore of it all, beyond the arrogant assumption of \"welt-politik.\" Every refining trait was subordinated to the exigencies of the gospel of force. Not only the plebeian mass, but the exclusive aristocracy, revelled in the brutish impulse that associated all appeals to reason with effeminacy and invested the sword-slash on the student's cheek with the honor ordinarily claimed by the diploma.  This gospel of exalting animal strength developed a living passion for tyranny and grossness. We have seen it evidenced in the orgies that have reddened Belgium and France.  And I had given my parole to a nation without a soul--a nation that expected honor but knew not what it meant.  I crept to bed disturbed in mind, but resolved next day to take certain action.  [Illustration: \"I remembered our march across the great Rhine Bridge, with its wonderful arches and great bronze horses.\"--Chapter VIII.]     CHAPTER XI.  The Escape from Cologne.   Next morn I rose from a sleepless couch.  Thoughts grim and gaunt had purged my brain the whole night long. There was a flood of reasons why I should leave that German home. I chafed at being a guest in the house of old Goche, whose animosity to the Cause was undying. I could see that our discussions on the war were increasing in bitterness and would, ere long, terminate in a storm. I desired to avoid this for the sake of Miss Goche, whose friendship was the only balm in that period of stress. I had little further desire to accept hospitality from a stranger simply because I happened to be from the same country as his granddaughter.  But greatest of all reasons why I should leave was because I had now completely recovered from my wound, and the War of the World was waging within 100 miles of me.  My job was \"action on the firing line\" and not lolling in security as a guest of an enemy! Now that my wound had healed and my strength had knitted firmly again, I felt I was a traitor in giving my parole not to escape.  That August morning, when I made my first daily call at the barracks, I stated to the officer to whom I generally reported, that I was going to try and escape. He first seemed somewhat surprised, but soon broke into a laugh. Turning, he spoke laughingly to another officer, who joined in the hilarity.  \"So you're going to escape, eh?\" he said. \"Well, we don't think you will. If you intended to escape you would not be so foolish as to tell us about it; and then, if you did attempt it, you could not get out of Cologne with an English face like yours. That's alright,\" he repeated, \"you will report this afternoon as usual.\"  I stood awhile.  \"There is the door,\" he said. \"Good morning, we are busy.\"  I returned and acquainted Miss Goche of my action.  I explained there were two reasons for my giving notice. I could now attempt to get away without breaking my parole; and now no blame could be placed on the Goche household for my escape.  I need not here mention the scene that followed, but I may state I was aware that my departure had taken on a new aspect. I knew I was leaving one for whom I had now more than friendship, one whom I found had risked much to make me secure. She admitted that, without doubt, my duty lay beyond the Rhine.  \"But you will please me greatly if you will report at the barracks this afternoon, as usual,\" she said.  I did so, and was met by an officer with an \"I told you so\" smile.  I left the Goche home that afternoon at dusk. I did not intend to cross the river at Cologne. The way west would be too black with grim forebodings. The best opportunity of escaping seemed to be south, down the right bank of the Rhine to Coblenz, then crossing to the Rhine mountains, going south into Luxembourg, and then keeping east, trusting to good fortune to get through the German lines into the Vosges.  Miss Goche accompanied me as far as the park on the river bank, where in a quiet alcove I somewhat Germanised my appearance. I shaved my short beard and trimmed my moustache with the ends erect, the now universal fashion of the German menfolk; and with an old felt cap and unmistakable German clothes, I felt I could probably pass muster until I opened my mouth.  I had, thanks to my good friend, learned off a few German phrases for use at odd times, so, as night fell we parted.  Down the pathway I stepped with a world of mystery ahead of me. I remember now it took no slight effort to leave, but though the call away was unmistakable, I knew the reply was the hardest task in my experience. But I set my teeth and trudged down the track till I reached the bend, then I looked back. At the top of the road a figure stood, a hand waved and--yes--a kiss was thrown, then she turned away.  I felt alone in a new world, so marked my way and went into the night.  [Illustration]  During the first hours I stepped along in fear and trembling. I peopled every dark corner with a sentry; I pictured every distant tree as covering watching soldiers. I wondered at the lack of challenge, till it dawned upon me that I was not in the fighting country. There was no war in these parts, so I tramped along at the side of the road till early morning, the only incident being a hail from a man on a bridge which I had passed but did not have to cross. The bridges were evidently guarded. As dawn light came into the sky I saw an aeroplane pass flying low and stared at by an early morning ploughman, then I crept behind a hedge and stole a sleep.     CHAPTER XII.  The Waste of War.   I could not have been long in slumber, when a slight noise, perhaps the cracking of a stick, drove sleep from my anxious brain, and I sat up with surprise, staring at a long figure in black that stood peering at me. The black gown, the beads and the broad-brimmed hat told me it was a priest.  He spoke to me in German. It was one of the sentences Miss Goche told me I would be asked--he wished to know where I was going. So I fired at him a second of my readied German phrases: \"I'm going south to fight,\" I said, which was true.  Then he let free a flood of German that floored me. He waited for a reply that hesitated; then with a queried look into my face, he said: \"English! you're no German,\" and his eyes began to twinkle.  \"You can confess,\" he said, \"remember there is no war with men of God. I, too, am going south, I am going to France, our journey will seem quicker in company, let us step forth.\"  He was a Christian Brother. He had been to Australia, where many of his Order were established. I explained I knew of their work in education; in fact, I happened to know many of the fraternity by name. I ran over a gamut of names of those I knew in past years. There were Brothers Paul, Wilbrid, Aloysius and Mark.  \"I may know some of those you mention,\" he said, \"but I do not think it possible. We seldom know each other by name unless we are beneath the same roof. There are hundreds called by the names you mentioned, I myself am a 'Brother Wilbrid.'\"  It is a wonderful fact that there is nothing that knits strangers together, as the hitting on the name of a mutual friend, so we became close companions.  He had been born in Lorraine, but had lived most of his time in Berlin. His close-cropped grey hair showed he was well on in years. He had been an artisan before he joined his Order, and he lightened our long tramp to Coblenz with his idea of the trend of things.  The road was good and the air was clean and sweet. We passed by some farms where women were behind the plough.  Summer was breaking, and the Autumn sunshine was drying the last dewdrops from the grass.  \"Note,\" Brother Wilbrid said, \"how all Nature welcomes the sunshine, hear the birds twitter, see the cattle slowly moving on that rise. All Nature here joins in a hymn of peace, yet far beyond those western ridges three million men lay trenched through the winter and stared in hellish hate at each other across a narrow strip.  \"All Nature welcomed the Spring with a p√¶an of praise, but by fighting men it was welcomed as the opportunity to rise from winter holes and rush across the Spring sun-warmed earth to warm it anew with flowing blood. But it is not the waste of blood that so appals, it's the waste of effort and the waste of heroism. The labor of three million men could, in the wasted months of war build much to ensure unending human happiness. Thirty-two thousand men cut a channel through Panama and shortened the world's journey to your home by a third! Think what the labor of three million men could do!  \"And then there is the waste of heroism.  \"Men with large hearts will risk their lives to drag a comrade out of danger. It is heroism--yes--but it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27382"],["title","The Sequel (#7)"],["body","wasted on a cause of foolishness----\"  \"But,\" I interrupted, \"there is other heroism than that on the fighting line,\" and I told him the story of Abbe Chinot, of Rheims, the young priest in charge of the cathedral; how, when German shells were crashing into the grand old pile which was being used as a hospital for German soldiers, Chinot, aided by Red Cross nurses, dragged the wounded into the street, where surged a mob, maddened that their beloved church was in flames, and that their homes and five hundred of their folks had been smashed with German shells. The sight of the grey uniforms on the German wounded drove the mob into frenzied screams of revenge, but the fearless Abbe placed himself between the uplifted rifles of the crowd and the German wounded. \"If you kill them,\" he said, \"you must first kill us\"; and how the mob, struck with his perfect courage, moved away in silence.  [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS.]  [Illustration: \"Smashed with German Shells.\"  (The Rheims Cathedral Front.)]  \"Yes, that is fine, very fine,\" he said--\"yet it does not prove that the war made the brave Abbe heroic.  \"This war is unnecessary. It is the most unnecessary of all wars. It is not a war of the people. It is a merchants' war. It is not a war of the workers. It is a war for commerce--and four million or more lives will go up to God in the interests of Trade.  \"I fear the consequences of this war. I feel this war spirit will bring on a sequel that will surprise humanity.  \"A great writer[1] likened the war spirit to a carbuncle on the body. The poison flowing through the blood localises itself, and a painful lump forms in the flesh. Relief is sought in salves, ointments, and poultices. But the lump continues to swell, and the pain to increase, until at the very time when the soul is in mortal agony the carbuncle bursts and spews out the poison. The pain ceases, the swelling subsides, and the flesh regains its normal color.  \"The poison of injustice flows through the veins of society. Men are denied their natural rights; and when the oppression becomes unendurable, their oppressors make all manner of excuses. The affliction is due, they say, to the wrath of God, to the niggardliness of nature, or to the encroachments of foreign nations. Ah, the encroachments of foreign nations! When all other excuses fail, there is this to fall back upon; and each ruling class of oppressors holds its victims in subjection by charging the trouble to the others.  \"But the people are awakening. A few already see their real oppressors. It is for each who sees the truth to tell his fellow, and that fellow his fellow, until presently all will know the truth, and the truth shall make them free; free from industrial tyranny at home, and free from military tyranny from abroad. The work of the peace advocate is not negative. It is not enough for him to cry peace, peace! He must first lay the foundation for peace. To cry peace while the people writhe under injustice is like trying to heal the carbuncle without cleansing the blood.\"  [Illustration: \"The Waste of War.\"--Chapter XII.  (The Cartoon, \"Advance of Civilisation,\" by Bradley, in the \"Chicago Daily Mail.\")]  [Footnote 1: Stoughton Cooley.]  [Illustration: \"It is not the people's fight.\"--Chapter XIII.  (The Cartoon, \"Must Peace Wait for This,\" by Bradley, in the \"Chicago Daily Mail.\")]     CHAPTER XIII.  How the War Wrecked Theories.   I shall never forget that wonderful walk on the Coblenz road: the grave, hard-cut featured face of the man of religion, pouring out his socialistic theories, like a long pent-up torrent bursting through years of accumulated debris. At one moment he would be calm and clear, but at times, in his excitement, he would lash at wayside flowers with his stick like a soldier with a sabre.  \"The people are not sincere at heart in this Great War,\" he said, \"it is not the people's fight. If soldiers only had their own way this war would be short lasting--in fact the war nearly ended on Christmas Day. You have heard how the Germans and the English ceased firing at the dawn of that holy morn. How a bayonet from a German trench held up a placard with those magic words of good cheer that ever move the world--\"A Merry Christmas.\" How each side sang hymns at the other's invitation, crossed the zone of fire, and exchanged cigarettes. Surely the spirits of Jesus and Jaures moved along that line that wonderful morn.\"  \"And yet,\" I said, \"when time was up, back to their trenches the soldiers crept and fought again like devils.\"  He went on, ignoring my interruption.  \"And German officers, high in rank, held up their hands in horror at the idea of an armistice being arranged without their consent. That is the spirit that is going to end war--that human spirit that came to the surface on Christmas morn and that proved that this awful war is but a thing of Business.\"  Our road passed along the cliff tops of the Rhine. There was little traffic on the river and no sign of war. Everything seemed peaceful. The war, in draining the men and youths from the countryside, had placed a mantle of calm upon life in the villages of the Rhine Valley. Even across the river a long length of railway line lay as a long road of emptiness. Not a train, not a truck, not any sign of life was upon the long stretch of metal.  \"And yet,\" said Brother Wilbrid, \"that is the main line from Bonn to Coblenz. All railwaymen, stock, and traffic are confined to the Theatres of War.\"  We had walked in silence for quite a while. My companion was lost in thought. I ventured an interruption.  \"You are a Socialist,\" I said.  He looked at me a while before replying.  \"A Socialist? Well, no, I'm not--that is so far as Socialists have gone. I describe myself as a 'Humanist.' Socialism as we had it before the war was synonymous with revolution. Its creed, 'Revolution before evolution,' spelt destruction and anarchy. It aimed to get what it wanted by force instead of striving to get it by constitutional means. I broke with them just there--and yet--and yet,\" he mused, as if to himself, \"they were hounded down as outlaws of society for promising force--for threatening to do what the armies are to-day doing in the 'interests of civilisation.'  \"What a shuffle of theories this mighty conflict has brought about! Strange that your Allies claim they are fighting to save civilisation from being destroyed by the 'German barbarians,' whilst the German convinces himself that he is fighting to impress his 'higher culture' upon an unenlightened world!  \"Listen! I was once an engineer in the Krupp Works, at Essen; that nest of the German War Eagle. I was but a unit in a mighty mass. We were all well treated. Our health was well served. Our masters had learned that, just as they watched the health of horses, it was just as necessary to study the well-being of their human workers; so model homes and villages were built for us, our masters realising that if we were healthy they would get more work from us. They were philanthropists with an eye on the output. And the average German worker was getting contented--getting into a groove.\"  [Illustration: \"That Nest of the German War Eagle.\"-Chapter XIII.  (The Krupp Works, at Essen.)]  \"Then,\" I ventured, \"if a man's contented and has nothing to growl about--why worry?\"  \"Ah,\" he replied, \"that's just the trouble, the German worker, as a worker, has little to complain of, but he is becoming systematised. He cannot rise, he is forced to be content and do his job. His health is insured by groups of employers sharing the responsibility. If workers get hurt too much or sick too much, the insurance syndicate begins to lose money; hence safety devices are considered and sanitoria built to prevent illness; and this German social insurance speeds individual initiative to top speed. It makes the German worker a splendid animal--and there is the danger.  \"You know it's human nature to complain--progress is built upon discomfort, contentment means stagnation. I could see the workers fixed in their contented groove under the studied philanthropy of his employers and ending as in the dumb-driven-cattle age of the Feudal Barons.\"  \"It strikes me,\" I said, \"that the Socialist is of that type of Irishman that's never happy unless there's a chance of a fight. You might at least admit that many employers have hearts like other human beings. There are many that recognise that profits are not everything.\"  \"No doubt,\" he said, \"but they're not in Germany. Prior to the war the workers were moving close to a war with employers--the rise of Labor has been steady and sure the world over. Why in your own country, Australia, Labor already controls the Governments. It was coming to that in Europe. The worker was climbing, climbing, all the time--organising, organising--but against the increasing demand for labor the employers had a powerful weapon in the invention of labor-saving machinery.  \"Every day saw more and more of the work of the world taken up by machinery. Did a labor union demand increased wages, then a machine was devised to do the work with less assistance. In a return issued by the U.S. Government, it was estimated that 4,500,000 factory machine workers of that country were turning out products in quantities equal to the hand labor of 45,000,000 men. That meant that 90 per cent. of the work in factories was being done by machinery; that one man, with the help of machines could produce ten times more than he needs. It was more acute in Germany. In other words, to satisfy the wants of one man for one day, a factory worker with a machine requires only one hour instead of the ten he formerly worked. For whom was he doing the work of the remaining nine hours? Why, for rulers, soldiers, and other parasites, who do not work but have to live.  \"When I was a worker in Essen I saw the set lives of the workers--noted how a new labor-saving device threw out so many men at a time.
