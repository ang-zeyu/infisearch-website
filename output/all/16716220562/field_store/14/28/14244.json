And when treason was hatching its plot and massing its armies, then, O God of Israel, who didst bring David from the sheepfold, Thou gavest one reared in the humble cabin to become the hope and stay of this great people in their most perilous hour, to shield them in disaster and lead them to final victory.  We thank Thee that Thou gavest us an honest man, simple-hearted and loving as a child, but with a rugged strength that needed only culture and discipline. Thanks be to God that this discipline was granted him through stern public trial, domestic sorrow, and Thy solemn providences, till the mere politician was overshadowed by the nobler growth of his moral and spiritual nature, till he came, as we believe, into sympathy with Christ, and saw that we could succeed only by doing justice. Then, inspired by Thee, he uttered those words of power which changed three millions of slaves into men--the great act which has rendered his name forever illustrious and secured the triumph of our cause. We think of him almost as the prophet of his era. Thou didst make that honest, great-hearted man the central figure of his age, setting upon goodness, upon moral grandeur, the seal of Thine approval and the crown of victory. We bless Thee that he did not die until assured of victory, until he knew that his great work was done, and he had received all the honor that earth could bestow, and then we believe Thou didst give him a martyr's crown. We thank Thee that we have this hope for the illustrious dead.  Great reason have we also to thank Thee that such was the enduring strength of our institutions that they received no perceptible shock from the death of even such a man and in such an hour, and that Thou didst provide for that perilous moment one whose strength was sufficient to receive and bear the weight of government, and who, we trust, will work out the great problem of Christian freedom to its final solution, and by equal law and equal rights bind this great people into one inseparable whole.  We thank Thee that the representatives of the nation have come to sit to-day in the shadow of Abraham Lincoln's tomb, to express once more their now chastened sorrow. May they all reconsecrate themselves to those principles which made him worthy to be remembered thus, and then a redeemed and transfigured land will be a fitting monument for him and for them.  Endow the President with wisdom equal to his great responsibilities, that the blessings of a whole nation may also be given to him. May his advisers, our judges, and our legislators, be constantly instructed by Thee.  May Thy blessing rest on the officers of the army and navy, by whose skill and courage our triumph was won; upon our soldiers and sailors; upon our people, and on those who are struggling on toward a perfect manhood.  Bless these eminent men the honored representatives of Foreign Powers. Remember the sovereigns and people they represent. We thank Thee that peace reigns with them as with us. May it continue until the nations shall learn war no more.  Remember Abraham Lincoln's widow and family. Comfort them in their sore bereavement. May they be consoled to know how much the father and husband is loved and honored still.  Give Divine support to the distinguished orator of the day. May he so speak as to impress the whole nation's mind. Prepare us to live as men in this age should, that we may be received into Thy Heavenly Kingdom, and to Thy name shall be the praise and the glory forevermore. Amen.  Hon. LAFAYETTE S. FOSTER, President _pro tempore_ of the Senate, in introducing the orator of the day, said:  No ordinary occasion could have convened this august assemblage. For four weary years, the storm of war, of civil war, raged fiercely over our country. The blood of the best and bravest of her sons was freely shed to preserve her name and place among the nations of the earth. In April last, the dark clouds which had so long hung heavily and gloomily over our heads, were all dispersed, and the light of peace, more welcome even than the vernal sunshine, gladdened the eyes and the hearts of our people. Shouts of joy and songs of triumph echoed through the land. The hearts of the devout poured themselves in orisons and thanksgivings to the God of battles and of nations that the most wicked and most formidable rebellion ever known in human history had been effectually crashed, and our country saved.  In the midst of all this abounding joy, suddenly and swiftly as the lightning's flash came the fearful tidings that the Chief Magistrate of the Republic--our President--loved and honored as few men ever were--so honest, so faithful, so true to his duty and his country, had been foully murdered--had fallen by the bullet of an assassin. All hearts were stricken with horror. The transition from extreme joy to profound sorrow was never more sudden and universal. Had it been possible for a stranger, ignorant of the truth, to look over our land, he would have supposed that there had come upon us some visitation of the Almighty not less dreadful than that which once fell on ancient Egypt on that fearful night when there was not a house where there was not one dead.  The nation wept for him.  After being gazed upon by myriads of loving eyes, under the dome of this magnificent Capitol, the remains of our President were borne in solemn procession through our cities, towns, and villages, all draped in the habilaments of sorrow, the symbols and tokens of profound and heartfelt grief, to their final resting-place in the capital of his own State. There he sleeps, peacefully, embalmed in his country's tears.  The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States have deemed it proper to commemorate this tragic event by appropriate services. This day, the birth-day of him whom we mourn, has properly been selected. An eminent citizen, distinguished by his labors and services in high and responsible public positions at home and abroad--whose pen has instructed the present age in the history of his country, and done much to transmit the fame and renown of that country to future ages--Hon. George Bancroft--will now deliver a discourse.  Hon. GEORGE BANCROFT (who on coming forward to the Clerk's desk was greeted with warm demonstrations of applause) then proceeded to deliver the Memorial Address.  The exercises of the day were closed by the following prayer and benediction by the Rev. Dr. GRAY, Chaplain of the Senate:  God of a bereaved nation, from Thy high and holy Habitation look down upon us and suitably impress us to-day, with a sense that God only is great. Kings and Presidents die; but Thou, the Universal Ruler, livest to roll on thine undisturbed affairs forever, from Thy Throne. A wail has gone up from the heart of the nation to heaven--O, hear, and pity, and assuage, and save. We pray that Thou wilt command thy blessing now, which is life forevermore, upon the family of the President dead; upon the President living upon the Ministers of state; upon the united Houses of Congress; upon the Judges of our Courts; upon the officers of the Army and the Navy; upon the broken families and desolated homes all over the laud; and especially upon the nation. And grant that grace and peace and mercy from the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of God the Spirit, may rest upon and abide with us all, forever and ever. Amen.  The Senators then returned to the Senate Chamber, and the President of the United States, the orator of the day, and the invited guests withdrew, the Marine Band, stationed in the amphitheater, performing national airs.  Hon. E. B. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, after the House had resumed the transaction of business, by unanimous consent, introduced the following concurrent resolutions; which were read, considered, and agreed to:  _Resolved,_ (the Senate concurring,) That the thanks of Congress be presented to Hon. George Bancroft for the appropriate memorial address delivered by him on the life and services of Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United States, in the Representatives Hall before both Houses of Congress and their invited guests, on the 12th day of February, 1866, and that he be requested to furnish a copy for publication.  _Resolved,_ That the chairmen of the joint committee appointed to make the necessary arrangements to carry into effect the resolution of this Congress in relation to the memorial exercises in honor of Abraham Lincoln be requested to communicate to Mr. Bancroft the aforegoing resolution, receive his answer thereto, and present the same to both Houses of Congress.  These resolutions were transmitted to the Senate, where, on motion of the Hon. Solomon Foot, of Vermont, they were considered by unanimous consent, and concurred in.        *      *      *  In the Senate, on the 16th of February, Hon. Mr. FOOT stated that in pursuance of the concurrent resolutions of the two Houses of Congress adopted on the 12th instant, the chairmen of the joint committee of arrangements on the memorial exercises of the late President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, had placed a certified copy of said concurrent resolutions in the hands of Hon. George Bancroft, and had requested of him a copy of his address on the occasion referred to for publication, as would appear from the following correspondence, which he moved be read, laid upon the table, and printed.  As no objection was made, the Secretary read as follows:  THE CAPITOL, WASHINGTON,   _February_ 13, 1866.  SIR: We have the honor to present to you an official copy of the two concurrent resolutions adopted by the Senate and House of Representatives on the 12th instant, expressing the thanks of Congress for the appropriate memorial address delivered by you on the life and services of Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United States, and instructing us to request from you a copy of the address for publication.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit https://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
