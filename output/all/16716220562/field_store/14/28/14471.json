Then would you help me to get back to my hotel?\"         *       *       *       *       *  By the fourth day, his hands weren't trembling any longer. He ate a good breakfast, dressed carefully, then took a hotel limousine down to the offices of the Mathers, Demming and Rostoff Corporation.  At the entrance to the inner sanctum the heavyset Scotty looked up at his approach. He said, \"The boss has been looking for you, Mr. Mathers, but right now you ain't got no appointment, have you? Him and Mr. Rostoff is having a big conference. He says to keep everybody out.\"  \"That doesn't apply to me, Scotty,\" Don snapped. \"Get out of my way.\"  Scotty stood up, reluctantly, but barred the way. \"He said it applied to everybody, Mr. Mathers.\"  Don put his full weight into a blow that started at his waist, dug deep into the other's middle. Scotty doubled forward, his eyes bugging. Don Mathers gripped his hands together into a double fist and brought them upward in a vicious uppercut.         *       *       *       *       *  Scotty fell forward and to the floor.  Don stood above him momentarily, watchful for movement which didn't develop. The hefty bodyguard must have been doing some easy living himself. He wasn't as tough as he looked.  Don knelt and fished from under the other's left arm a vicious-looking short-barrelled scrambler. He tucked it under his own jacket into his belt, then turned, opened the door and entered the supposedly barred office.  Demming and Rostoff looked up from their work across a double desk.  Both scowled. Rostoff opened his mouth to say something and Don Mathers rapped, \"Shut up.\"  Rostoff blinked at him. Demming leaned back in his swivel chair. \"You're sober for a change,\" he wheezed, almost accusingly.  Don Mathers pulled up a stenographer's chair and straddled it, leaning his arms on the back. He said coldly, \"Comes a point when even the lowest worm turns. I've been checking on a few things.\"  Demming grunted amusement.  Don said, \"Space patrols have been cut far below the danger point.\"  Rostoff snorted. \"Is that supposed to interest us? That's the problem of the military--and the government.\"  \"Oh, it interests us, all right,\" Don growled. \"Currently, Mathers, Demming and Rostoff control probably three-quarters of the system's radioactives.\"  Demming said in greasy satisfaction, \"More like four-fifths.\"  \"Why?\" Don said bluntly. \"Why are we doing what we're doing?\"  They both scowled, but another element was present in their expressions too. They thought the question unintelligent.  Demming closed his eyes in his porcine manner and grunted, \"Tell him.\"  Rostoff said, \"Look, Mathers, don't be stupid. Remember when we told you, during that first interview, that we wanted your name in the corporation, among other reasons, because we could use a man who was above law? That a maze of ridiculously binding ordinances have been laid on business down through the centuries?\"  \"I remember,\" Don said bitterly.  \"Well, it goes both ways. Government today is also bound, very strongly, and even in great emergency, not to interfere in business. These complicated laws balance each other, you might say. Our whole legal system is based upon them. Right now, we've got government right where we want it. This is free enterprise, Mathers, at its pinnacle. Did you ever hear of Jim Fisk and his attempt to corner gold in 1869, the so-called Black Friday affair? Well, Jim Fisk was a peanut peddler compared to us.\"  \"What's this got to do with the Fleet having insufficient fuel to ...\" Don Mathers stopped as comprehension hit him. \"You're holding our radioactives off the market, pressuring the government for a price rise which it can't afford.\"  Demming opened his eyes and said fatly, \"For triple the price, Mathers. Before we're through, we'll corner half the wealth of the system.\"  Don said, \"But ... but the species is ... at ... _war_.\"  Rostoff sneered, \"You seem to be getting noble rather late in the game, Mathers. Business is business.\"  Don Mathers was shaking his head. \"We immediately begin selling our radioactives at cost of production. I might remind you gentlemen that although we're supposedly a three-way partnership, actually, everything's in my name. You thought you had me under your thumb so securely that it was safe--and you probably didn't trust each other. Well, I'm blowing the whistle.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Surprisingly fast for such a fat man, Lawrence Demming's hand flitted into a desk drawer to emerge with a twin of the scrambler tucked in Don's belt.  Don Mathers grinned at him, even as he pushed his jacket back to reveal the butt of his own weapon. He made no attempt to draw it, however.  He said softly, \"Shoot me, Demming, and you've killed the most popular man in the Solar System. You'd never escape the gas chamber, no matter how much money you have. On the other hand, if I shoot you ...\"  He put a hand into his pocket and it emerged with a small, inordinately ordinary bit of ribbon and metal. He displayed it on his palm.  The fat man's face whitened at the ramifications and his hand relaxed to let the gun drop to the desk. \"Listen, Don,\" he broke out. \"We've been unrealistic with you. We'll reverse ourselves and split, honestly--split three ways.\"  Don Mathers laughed at him. \"Trying to bribe me with money, Demming? Why don't you realize, that I'm the only man in existence who has no need for money, who can't spend money? That my fellow men--whom I've done such a good job of betraying--have honored me to a point where money is meaningless?\"  Rostoff snatched up the fallen gun, snarling, \"I'm calling your bluff, you gutless rummy.\"  Don Mathers said, \"Okay, Rostoff. There's just two other things I want to say first. One--I don't care if I die or not. Two--you're only twenty feet or so away, but you know what? I think you're probably a lousy shot. I don't think you've had much practice. I think I can get my scrambler out and cut you down before you can finish me.\" He grinned thinly, \"Wanta try?\"  Max Rostoff snarled a curse and his finger whitened on the trigger.  Don Mathers fell sideward, his hand streaking for his weapon. Without thought there came back to him the long hours of training in hand weapons, in judo, in hand to hand combat. He went into action with cool confidence.         *       *       *       *       *  At the spaceport he took a cab to the Presidential Palace. It was an auto-cab, of course, and at the Palace gates he found he had no money on him. He snorted wearily. It was the first time in almost a year that he'd had to pay for anything.  Four sentries were standing at attention. He said, \"Do one of you boys have some coins to feed into this slot? I'm fresh out.\"  A sergeant grinned, approached, and did the necessary.  Don Mathers said wearily, \"I don't know how you go about this. I don't have an appointment, but I want to see the President.\"  \"We can turn you over to one of the assistant secretaries, Captain Mathers,\" the sergeant said. \"We can't go any further than that. While we're waiting, what's the chances of getting your autograph, sir? I gotta kid ...\"  It wasn't nearly as complicated as he'd thought it was going to be. In half an hour he was seated in the office where he'd received his decoration only--how long ago was it, really less than a year?  He told the story briefly, making no effort to spare himself. At the end he stood up long enough to put a paper in front of the other, then sat down again.  \"I'm turning the whole corporation over to the government....\"         *       *       *       *       *  The President said, \"Wait a minute. My administration does not advocate State ownership of industry.\"  \"I know. When the State controls industry you only put the whole mess off one step, the question then becomes, who controls the State? However, I'm not arguing political economy with you, sir. You didn't let me finish. I was going to say, I'm turning it over to the government to untangle, even while making use of the inventories of radioactives. There's going to be a lot of untangling to do. Reimbursing the prospectors and small operators who were blackjacked out of their holdings by our super-corporation. Reimbursing of the miners and other laborers who were talked into accepting low pay in the name of patriotism.\" Don Mathers cut it short. \"Oh, it's quite a mess.\"  \"Yes,\" the President said. \"And you say Max Rostoff is dead?\"  \"That's right. And Demming off his rocker. I think he always was a little unbalanced and the prospect of losing all that money, the greatest fortune ever conceived of, tipped the scales.\"  The President said, \"And what about you, Donal Mathers?\"  Don took a deep breath. \"I wish I was back in the Space Services, frankly. Back where I was when all this started. However, I suppose that after my court martial, there won't be ...\"  The President interrupted gently. \"You seem to forget, Captain Mathers. You carry the Galactic Medal of Honor, the bearer of which can do no wrong.\"  Don Mathers gaped at him.  The President smiled at him, albeit a bit sourly. \"It would hardly do for human morale to find out our supreme symbol of heroism was a phoney, Captain. There will be no trial, and you will retain your decoration.\"  \"But I don't want it!\"  \"I'm afraid that is the cross you'll have to bear the rest of your life, Captain Mathers. I don't suppose it will be an easy one.\"  His eyes went to a far corner of the room, but unseeingly. He said after a long moment, \"However, I am not so very sure about your not deserving your award, Captain.\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_     November 1960.

Reed, Henry Eyster Jacobs, et Al., Trans. & Eds.   (Philadelphia: A. J. Holman Company, 1915), Vol. 1, pp. 29-38.       DISPUTATION OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER   ON THE POWER AND EFFICACY OF   INDULGENCES  OCTOBER 31, 1517  Out of love for the truth and the desire to bring it to light, the following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg, under the presidency of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts and of Sacred Theology, and Lecturer in Ordinary on the same at that place. Wherefore he requests that those who are unable to be present and debate orally with us, may do so by letter.  In the Name our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.  1. Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, when He said Poenitentiam agite, willed that the whole life of believers should be repentance.  2. This word cannot be understood to mean sacramental penance, i.e., confession and satisfaction, which is administered by the priests.  3. Yet it means not inward repentance only; nay, there is no inward repentance which does not outwardly work divers mortifications of the flesh.  4. The penalty [of sin], therefore, continues so long as hatred of self continues; for this is the true inward repentance, and continues until our entrance into the kingdom of heaven.  5. The pope does not intend to remit, and cannot remit any penalties other than those which he has imposed either by his own authority or by that of the Canons.  6. The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring that it has been remitted by God and by assenting to God's remission; though, to be sure, he may grant remission in cases reserved to his judgment. If his right to grant remission in such cases were despised, the guilt would remain entirely unforgiven.  7. God remits guilt to no one whom He does not, at the same time, humble in all things and bring into subjection to His vicar, the priest.  8. The penitential canons are imposed only on the living, and, according to them, nothing should be imposed on the dying.  9. Therefore the Holy Spirit in the pope is kind to us, because in his decrees he always makes exception of the article of death and of necessity.  10. Ignorant and wicked are the doings of those priests who, in the case of the dying, reserve canonical penances for purgatory.  11. This changing of the canonical penalty to the penalty of purgatory is quite evidently one of the tares that were sown while the bishops slept.  12. In former times the canonical penalties were imposed not after, but before absolution, as tests of true contrition.  13. The dying are freed by death from all penalties; they are already dead to canonical rules, and have a right to be released from them.  14. The imperfect health [of soul], that is to say, the imperfect love, of the dying brings with it, of necessity, great fear; and the smaller the love, the greater is the fear.  15. This fear and horror is sufficient of itself alone (to say nothing of other things) to constitute the penalty of purgatory, since it is very near to the horror of despair.  16. Hell, purgatory, and heaven seem to differ as do despair, almost-despair, and the assurance of safety.  17. With souls in purgatory it seems necessary that horror should grow less and love increase.  18. It seems unproved, either by reason or Scripture, that they are outside the state of merit, that is to say, of increasing love.  19. Again, it seems unproved that they, or at least that all of them, are certain or assured of their own blessedness, though we may be quite certain of it.  20. Therefore by \"full remission of all penalties\" the pope means not actually \"of all,\" but only of those imposed by himself.  21. Therefore those preachers of indulgences are in error, who say that by the pope's indulgences a man is freed from every penalty, and saved;  22. Whereas he remits to souls in purgatory no penalty which, according to the canons, they would have had to pay in this life.  23. If it is at all possible to grant to any one the remission of all penalties whatsoever, it is certain that this remission can be granted only to the most perfect, that is, to the very fewest.  24. It must needs be, therefore, that the greater part of the people are deceived by that indiscriminate and highsounding promise of release from penalty.  25. The power which the pope has, in a general way, over purgatory, is just like the power which any bishop or curate has, in a special way, within his own diocese or parish.  26. The pope does well when he grants remission to souls [in purgatory], not by the power of the keys (which he does not possess), but by way of intercession.  27. They preach man who say that so soon as the penny jingles into the money-box, the soul flies out [of purgatory].  28. It is certain that when the penny jingles into the money-box, gain and avarice can be increased, but the result of the intercession of the Church is in the power of God alone.  29. Who knows whether all the souls in purgatory wish to be bought out of it, as in the legend of Sts. Severinus and Paschal.  30. No one is sure that his own contrition is sincere; much less that he has attained full remission.  31. Rare as is the man that is truly penitent, so rare is also the man who truly buys indulgences, i.e., such men are most rare.  32. They will be condemned eternally, together with their teachers, who believe themselves sure of their salvation because they have letters of pardon.  33. Men must be on their guard against those who say that the pope's pardons are that inestimable gift of God by which man is reconciled to Him;  34. For these \"graces of pardon\" concern only the penalties of sacramental satisfaction, and these are appointed by man.  35. They preach no Christian doctrine who teach that contrition is not necessary in those who intend to buy souls out of purgatory or to buy confessionalia.  36. Every truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of penalty and guilt, even without letters of pardon.  37. Every true Christian, whether living or dead, has part in all the blessings of Christ and the Church; and this is granted him by God, even without letters of pardon.  38. Nevertheless, the remission and participation [in the blessings of the Church] which are granted by the pope are in no way to be despised, for they are, as I have said, the declaration of divine remission.  39. It is most difficult, even for the very keenest theologians, at one and the same time to commend to the people the abundance of pardons and [the need of] true contrition.  40. True contrition seeks and loves penalties, but liberal pardons only relax penalties and cause them to be hated, or at least, furnish an occasion [for hating them].  41. Apostolic pardons are to be preached with caution, lest the people may falsely think them preferable to other good works of love.  42. Christians are to be taught that the pope does not intend the buying of pardons to be compared in any way to works of mercy.  43. Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the needy does a better work than buying pardons;  44. Because love grows by works of love, and man becomes better; but by pardons man does not grow better, only more free from penalty.  45. Christians are to be taught that he who sees a man in need, and passes him by, and gives [his money] for pardons, purchases not the indulgences of the pope, but the indignation of God.  46. Christians are to be taught that unless they have more than they need, they are bound to keep back what is necessary for their own families, and by no means to squander it on pardons.  47. Christians are to be taught that the buying of pardons is a matter of free will, and not of commandment.  48. Christians are to be taught that the pope, in granting pardons, needs, and therefore desires, their devout prayer for him more than the money they bring.  49. Christians are to be taught that the pope's pardons are useful, if they do not put their trust in them; but altogether harmful, if through them they lose their fear of God.  50. Christians are to be taught that if the pope knew the exactions of the pardon-preachers, he would rather that St.  Peter's church should go to ashes, than that it should be built up with the skin, flesh and bones of his sheep.  51. Christians are to be taught that it would be the pope's wish, as it is his duty, to give of his own money to very many of those from whom certain hawkers of pardons cajole money, even though the church of St. Peter might have to be sold.  52. The assurance of salvation by letters of pardon is vain, even though the commissary, nay, even though the pope himself, were to stake his soul upon it.  53. They are enemies of Christ and of the pope, who bid the Word of God be altogether silent in some Churches, in order that pardons may be preached in others.  54. Injury is done the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an equal or a longer time is spent on pardons than on this Word.  55. It must be the intention of the pope that if pardons, which are a very small thing, are celebrated with one bell, with single processions and ceremonies, then the Gospel, which is the very greatest thing, should be preached with a hundred bells, a hundred processions, a hundred ceremonies.  56. The \"treasures of the Church,\" out of which the pope grants indulgences, are not sufficiently named or known among the people of Christ.  57. That they are not temporal treasures is certainly evident, for many of the vendors do not pour out such treasures so easily, but only gather them.  58. Nor are they the merits of Christ and the Saints, for even without the pope, these always work grace for the inner man, and the cross, death, and hell for the outward man.  59. St. Lawrence said that the treasures of the Church were the Church's poor, but he spoke"]]]
