Also, why did he write you a threatening letter which would certainly bring him into the grip of the law and would have saved you a great deal of unpleasantness if he had decided upon taking action!”  He tapped his white teeth with the end of his pencil and then suddenly,  “I think I'll see that letter,” he said.  John Lexman rose from the sofa, crossed to the safe, unlocked it and was unlocking the steel drawer in which he had placed the incriminating document. His hand was on the key when T. X. noticed the look of surprise on his face.  “What is it!” asked the detective suddenly.  “This drawer feels very hot,” said John,--he looked round as though to measure the distance between the safe and the fire.  T. X. laid his hand upon the front of the drawer. It was indeed warm.  “Open it,” said T. X., and Lexman turned the key and pulled the drawer open.  As he did so, the whole contents burst up in a quick blaze of flame. It died down immediately and left only a little coil of smoke that flowed from the safe into the room.  “Don't touch anything inside,” said T. X. quickly.  He lifted the drawer carefully and placed it under the light. In the bottom was no more than a few crumpled white ashes and a blister of paint where the flame had caught the side.  “I see,” said T. X. slowly.  He saw something more than that handful of ashes, he saw the deadly peril in which his friend was standing. Here was one half of the evidence in Lexman's favour gone, irredeemably.  “The letter was written on a paper which was specially prepared by a chemical process which disintegrated the moment the paper was exposed to the air. Probably if you delayed putting the letter in the drawer another five minutes, you would have seen it burn before your eyes. As it was, it was smouldering before you had turned the key of the box. The envelope!”  “Kara burnt it,” said Lexman in a low voice, “I remember seeing him take it up from the table and throw it in the fire.”  T. X. nodded.  “There remains the other half of the evidence,” he said grimly, and when an hour later, the village constable returned to report that in spite of his most careful search he had failed to discover the dead man's revolver, his anticipations were realized.  The next morning John Lexman was lodged in Lewes gaol on a charge of wilful murder.   A telegram brought Mansus from London to Beston Tracey, and T. X. received him in the library.  “I sent for you, Mansus, because I suffer from the illusion that you have more brains than most of the people in my department, and that's not saying much.”  “I am very grateful to you, sir, for putting me right with Commissioner,” began Mansus, but T. X. stopped him.  “It is the duty of every head of departments,” he said oracularly, “to shield the incompetence of his subordinates. It is only by the adoption of some such method that the decencies of the public life can be observed. Now get down to this.” He gave a sketch of the case from start to finish in as brief a space of time as possible.  “The evidence against Mr. Lexman is very heavy,” he said. “He borrowed money from this man, and on the man's body were found particulars of the very Promissory Note which Lexman signed. Why he should have brought it with him, I cannot say. Anyhow I doubt very much whether Mr. Lexman will get a jury to accept his version. Our only chance is to find the Greek's revolver--I don't think there's any very great chance, but if we are to be successful we must make a search at once.”  Before he went out he had an interview with Grace. The dark shadows under her eyes told of a sleepless night. She was unusually pale and surprisingly calm.  “I think there are one or two things I ought to tell you,” she said, as she led the way into the drawing room, closing the door behind him.  “And they concern Mr. Kara, I think,” said T. X.  She looked at him startled.  “How did you know that?”  “I know nothing.”  He hesitated on the brink of a flippant claim of omniscience, but realizing in time the agony she must be suffering he checked his natural desire.  “I really know nothing,” he continued, “but I guess a lot,” and that was as near to the truth as you might expect T. X. to reach on the spur of the moment.  She began without preliminary.  “In the first place I must tell you that Mr. Kara once asked me to marry him, and for reasons which I will give you, I am dreadfully afraid of him.”  She described without reserve the meeting at Salonika and Kara's extravagant rage and told of the attempt which had been made upon her.  “Does John know this?” asked T. X.  She shook her head sadly.  “I wish I had told him now,” she said. “Oh, how I wish I had!” She wrung her hands in an ecstasy of sorrow and remorse.  T. X. looked at her sympathetically. Then he asked,  “Did Mr. Kara ever discuss your husband's financial position with you!”  “Never.”  “How did John Lexman happen to meet Vassalaro!”  “I can tell you that,” she answered, “the first time we met Mr. Kara in England was when we were staying at Babbacombe on a summer holiday--which was really a prolongation of our honeymoon. Mr. Kara came to stay at the same hotel. I think Mr. Vassalaro must have been there before; at any rate they knew one another and after Kara's introduction to my husband the rest was easy.  “Can I do anything for John!” she asked piteously.  T. X. shook his head.  “So far as your story is concerned, I don't think you will advantage him by telling it,” he said. “There is nothing whatever to connect Kara with this business and you would only give your husband a great deal of pain. I'll do the best I can.”  He held out his hand and she grasped it and somehow at that moment there came to T. X. Meredith a new courage, a new faith and a greater determination than ever to solve this troublesome mystery.  He found Mansus waiting for him in a car outside and in a few minutes they were at the scene of the tragedy. A curious little knot of spectators had gathered, looking with morbid interest at the place where the body had been found. There was a local policeman on duty and to him was deputed the ungracious task of warning his fellow villagers to keep their distance. The ground had already been searched very carefully. The two roads crossed almost at right angles and at the corner of the cross thus formed, the hedges were broken, admitting to a field which had evidently been used as a pasture by an adjoining dairy farm. Some rough attempt had been made to close the gap with barbed wire, but it was possible to step over the drooping strands with little or no difficulty. It was to this gap that T. X. devoted his principal attention. All the fields had been carefully examined without result, the four drains which were merely the connecting pipes between ditches at the sides of the crossroads had been swept out and only the broken hedge and its tangle of bushes behind offered any prospect of the new search being rewarded.  “Hullo!” said Mansus, suddenly, and stooping down he picked up something from the ground.  T. X. took it in his hand.  It was unmistakably a revolver cartridge. He marked the spot where it had been found by jamming his walking stick into the ground and continued his search, but without success.  “I am afraid we shall find nothing more here,” said T. X., after half an hour's further search. He stood with his chin in his hand, a frown on his face.  “Mansus,” he said, “suppose there were three people here, Lexman, the money lender and a third witness. And suppose this third person for some reason unknown was interested in what took place between the two men and he wanted to watch unobserved. Isn't it likely that if he, as I think, instigated the meeting, he would have chosen this place because this particular hedge gave him a chance of seeing without being seen?”  Mansus thought.  “He could have seen just as well from either of the other hedges, with less chance of detection,” he said, after a long pause.  T. X. grinned.  “You have the makings of a brain,” he said admiringly. “I agree with you. Always remember that, Mansus. That there was one occasion in your life when T. X. Meredith and you thought alike.”  Mansus smiled a little feebly.  “Of course from the point of view of the observer this was the worst place possible, so whoever came here, if they did come here, dropping revolver bullets about, must have chosen the spot because it was get-at-able from another direction. Obviously he couldn't come down the road and climb in without attracting the attention of the Greek who was waiting for Mr. Lexman. We may suppose there is a gate farther along the road, we may suppose that he entered that gate, came along the field by the side of the hedge and that somewhere between here and the gate, he threw away his cigar.”  “His cigar!” said Mansus in surprise.  “His cigar,” repeated T. X., “if he was alone, he would keep his cigar alight until the very last moment.”  “He might have thrown it into the road,” said Mansus.  “Don't jibber,” said T. X., and led the way along the hedge. From where they stood they could see the gate which led on to the road about a hundred yards further on. Within a dozen yards of that gate, T. X. found what he had been searching for, a half-smoked cigar. It was sodden with rain and he picked it up tenderly.  “A good cigar, if I am any judge,” he said, “cut with a penknife, and smoked through a holder.”  They reached the gate and passed through. Here they were on the road again and this they followed until they reached another cross road that to the left inclining southward to the new Eastbourne Road and that to the westward looking back to the Lewes-Eastbourne railway. The rain had obliterated much that T. X. was looking for, but presently he found a faint indication of a car wheel.  “This is where she turned and backed,” he said, and walked slowly to the road on the left, “and this is where she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2688"],["title","The Clue of the Twisted Candle (#6)"],["body","stood. There is the grease from her engine.”  He stooped down and moved forward in the attitude of a Russian dancer, “And here are the wax matches which the chauffeur struck,” he counted, “one, two, three, four, five, six, allow three for each cigarette on a boisterous night like last night, that makes three cigarettes. Here is a cigarette end, Mansus, Gold Flake brand,” he said, as he examined it carefully, “and a Gold Flake brand smokes for twelve minutes in normal weather, but about eight minutes in gusty weather. A car was here for about twenty-four minutes--what do you think of that, Mansus?”  “A good bit of reasoning, T. X.,” said the other calmly, “if it happens to be the car you're looking for.”  “I am looking for any old car,” said T. X.  He found no other trace of car wheels though he carefully followed up the little lane until it reached the main road. After that it was hopeless to search because rain had fallen in the night and in the early hours of the morning. He drove his assistant to the railway station in time to catch the train at one o'clock to London.  “You will go straight to Cadogan Square and arrest the chauffeur of Mr. Kara,” he said.  “Upon what charge!” asked Mansus hurriedly.  When it came to the step which T. X. thought fit to take in the pursuance of his duty, Mansus was beyond surprise.  “You can charge him with anything you like,” said T. X., with fine carelessness, “probably something will occur to you on your way up to town. As a matter of fact the chauffeur has been called unexpectedly away to Greece and has probably left by this morning's train for the Continent. If that is so, we can do nothing, because the boat will have left Dover and will have landed him at Boulogne, but if by any luck you get him, keep him busy until I get back.”  T. X. himself was a busy man that day, and it was not until night was falling that he again turned to Beston Tracey to find a telegram waiting for him. He opened it and read,  “Chauffeur's name, Goole. Formerly waiter English Club, Constantinople. Left for east by early train this morning, his mother being ill.”  “His mother ill,” said T. X. contemptuously, “how very feeble,--I should have thought Kara could have gone one better than that.”  He was in John Lexman's study as the door opened and the maid announced, “Mr. Remington Kara.”     CHAPTER IV   T. X. folded the telegram very carefully and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket.  He favoured the newcomer with a little bow and taking upon himself the honours of the establishment, pushed a chair to his visitor.  “I think you know my name,” said Kara easily, “I am a friend of poor Lexman's.”  “So I am told,” said T. X., “but don't let your friendship for Lexman prevent your sitting down.”  For a moment the Greek was nonplussed and then, with a little smile and bow, he seated himself by the writing table.  “I am very distressed at this happening,” he went on, “and I am more distressed because I feel that as I introduced Lexman to this unfortunate man, I am in a sense responsible.”  “If I were you,” said T. X., leaning back in the chair and looking half questioningly and half earnestly into the face of the other, “I shouldn't let that fact keep me awake at night. Most people are murdered as a result of an introduction. The cases where people murder total strangers are singularly rare. That I think is due to the insularity of our national character.”  Again the other was taken back and puzzled by the flippancy of the man from whom he had expected at least the official manner.  “When did you see Mr. Vassalaro last?” asked T. X. pleasantly.  Kara raised his eyes as though considering.  “I think it must have been nearly a week ago.”  “Think again,” said T. X.  For a second the Greek started and again relaxed into a smile.  “I am afraid,” he began.  “Don't worry about that,” said T. X., “but let me ask you this question. You were here last night when Mr. Lexman received a letter. That he did receive a letter, there is considerable evidence,” he said as he saw the other hesitate, “because we have the supporting statements of the servant and the postman.”  “I was here,” said the other, deliberately, “and I was present when Mr. Lexman received a letter.”  T. X. nodded.  “A letter written on some brownish paper and rather bulky,” he suggested.  Again there was that momentary hesitation.  “I would not swear to the color of the paper or as to the bulk of the letter,” he said.  “I should have thought you would,” suggested T. X., “because you see, you burnt the envelope, and I presumed you would have noticed that.”  “I have no recollection of burning any envelope,” said the other easily.  “At any rate,” T. X. went on, “when Mr. Lexman read this letter out to you...”  “To which letter are you referring?” asked the other, with a lift of his eyebrows.  “Mr. Lexman received a threatening letter,” repeated T. X. patiently, “which he read out to you, and which was addressed to him by Vassalaro. This letter was handed to you and you also read it. Mr. Lexman to your knowledge put the letter in his safe--in a steel drawer.”  The other shook his head, smiling gently.  “I am afraid you've made a great mistake,” he said almost apologetically, “though I have a recollection of his receiving a letter, I did not read it, nor was it read to me.”  The eyes of T. X. narrowed to the very slits and his voice became metallic and hard.  “And if I put you into the box, will you swear, that you did not see that letter, nor read it, nor have it read to you, and that you have no knowledge whatever of such a letter having been received by Mr. Lexman?”  “Most certainly,” said the other coolly.  “Would you swear that you have not seen Vassalaro for a week?”  “Certainly,” smiled the Greek.  “That you did not in fact see him last night,” persisted T. X., “and interview him on the station platform at Lewes, that you did not after leaving him continue on your way to London and then turn your car and return to the neighbourhood of Beston Tracey?”  The Greek was white to the lips, but not a muscle of his face moved.  “Will you also swear,” continued T. X. inexorably, “that you did not stand at the corner of what is known as Mitre's Lot and re-enter a gate near to the side where your car was, and that you did not watch the whole tragedy?”  “I'd swear to that,” Kara's voice was strained and cracked.  “Would you also swear as to the hour of your arrival in London?”  “Somewhere in the region of ten or eleven,” said the Greek.  T. X. smiled.  “Would you swear that you did not go through Guilford at half-past twelve and pull up to replenish your petrol?”  The Greek had now recovered his self-possession and rose.  “You are a very clever man, Mr. Meredith--I think that is your name?”  “That is my name,” said T. X. calmly. “There has been, no need for me to change it as often as you have found the necessity.”  He saw the fire blazing in the other's eyes and knew that his shot had gone home.  “I am afraid I must go,” said Kara. “I came here intending to see Mrs. Lexman, and I had no idea that I should meet a policeman.”  “My dear Mr. Kara,” said T. X., rising and lighting a cigarette, “you will go through life enduring that unhappy experience.”  “What do you mean?”  “Just what I say. You will always be expecting to meet one person, and meeting another, and unless you are very fortunate indeed, that other will always be a policeman.”  His eyes twinkled for he had recovered from the gust of anger which had swept through him.  “There are two pieces of evidence I require to save Mr. Lexman from very serious trouble,” he said, “the first of these is the letter which was burnt, as you know.”  “Yes,” said Kara.  T. X. leant across the desk.  “How did you know?” he snapped.  “Somebody told me, I don't know who it was.”  “That's not true,” replied T. X.; “nobody knows except myself and Mrs. Lexman.”  “But my dear good fellow,” said Kara, pulling on his gloves, “you have already asked me whether I didn't burn the letter.”  “I said envelope,” said T. X., with a little laugh.  “And you were going to say something about the other clue?”  “The other is the revolver,” said T. X.  “Mr. Lexman's revolver!” drawled the Greek.  “That we have,” said T. X. shortly. “What we want is the weapon which the Greek had when he threatened Mr. Lexman.”  “There, I'm afraid I cannot help you.”  Kara walked to the door and T. X. followed.  “I think I will see Mrs. Lexman.”  “I think not,” said T. X.  The other turned with a sneer.  “Have you arrested her, too?” he asked.  “Pull yourself together!” said T. X. coarsely. He escorted Kara to his waiting limousine.  “You have a new chauffeur to-night, I observe,” he said.  Kara towering with rage stepped daintily into the car.  “If you are writing to the other you might give him my love,” said T. X., “and make most tender enquiries after his mother. I particularly ask this.”  Kara said nothing until the car was out of earshot then he lay back on the down cushions and abandoned himself to a paroxysm of rage and blasphemy.     CHAPTER V   Six months later T. X. Meredith was laboriously tracing an elusive line which occurred on an ordnance map of Sussex when the Chief Commissioner announced himself.  Sir George described T. X. as the most wholesome corrective a public official could have, and never missed an opportunity of meeting his subordinate (as he said) for this reason.  “What are you doing there?” he growled.  “The lesson this morning,” said T. X. without looking up, “is maps.”  Sir George passed behind his assistant and looked over his shoulder.  “That is a very old map you have got there,” he said.  “1876. It shows the course of a number of interesting little streams in this neighbourhood which have been lost sight of for one reason or the other by the gentleman who made the survey at a later period. I am perfectly sure that in one of these streams I shall find what I am seeking.”  “You haven't given up hope, then, in regard to"]]]
