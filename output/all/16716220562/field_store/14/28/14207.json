It was MacGregor they saw, lying face downwards on a bed of dried grass.  The Rhodesian was unconscious, but on examination no trace of an injury could be found.  In his panic he had succeeded in climbing the tree as far as the lowermost branch and had been seized with a sudden faintness.  While the three officers were bending over him MacGregor opened his eyes.  Gradually their haunted expression gave place to a look of bewilderment, until he realised that he was surrounded by friends.  \"By smoke!\" he ejaculated.  \"I had cold feet with a vengeance--and before a lot of niggers, too.\"  \"So did we--that is, Danvers and I were in a mortal hurry to get out of the way of the lioness,\" rejoined Laxdale.  \"Good old Spofforth bore the brunt of it, and he's badly mauled.\"  \"Is that so?\" asked MacGregor.  \"I am sorry.  It's a bad beginning, this running away business.  I only hope the colonel and the others won't take it badly.\"  \"Don't worry, old chap,\" said Danvers.  \"Feeling fit to foot it?  Good. We've got to get Spofforth back as quickly as possible.\"  Walking with difficulty MacGregor managed to keep pace with the three officers, and presently the rough-and-ready stretcher was overtaken. Upon arriving at the camp the medical staff were soon busy, with the result that the wounds of the injured hunter were properly dressed.  \"Not so serious as at first sight,\" declared the senior medical officer.  \"Unless complications set in he'll be fit in a month, but he'll carry the scars all his life.\"     CHAPTER V  HOW THE KOPJE WAS STORMED  A few days later the battalion left Kilwa for the scene of action, a strong force of Germans being located by seaplane reconnaissance twenty miles north of the Rovuma River and nearly four times that distance from the coast.  Acting in conjunction with three battalions of the Waffs were a mounted Boer contingent and a Punjabi regiment that had already done good service in the northern part of the hostile colony, while three seaplanes were \"attached\" to the expedition for reconnoitring purposes.  In high spirits the Waffs marched out of camp, eager for the chance of a scrap.  The only malcontents were half-a-dozen hospital cases who perforce had to be left behind; amongst them, to his great disgust, Second Lieutenant Spofforth, who though convalescent was unable to bluff the doctor that his arm was \"quite all right--doesn't inconvenience me in the least, don't you know.\"  At the end of four days' hard marching through scrubby grounds the troops began to climb the almost trackless hinterland, where water was scarce and vegetation scanty.  It was much of the same nature as the veldt in the dry season, kopjes being plentifully in evidence.  There were unpleasant traces of Fritz and his native auxiliaries, for several of the springs had been systematically poisoned and cunningly-constructed booby-traps were frequently encountered.  Nevertheless all arms were sanguine of bringing the Huns to bay. Strong Belgian forces operating from the westward were driving the enemy towards the advancing British, while across the Rovuma Portuguese troops, well supplied with light field-artillery, were considered a bar to any attempted \"break-through\" on the southern frontier.  Towards evening scouts reported the \"spoor\" of the enemy, for the ground bore the impression of thousands of naked footprints and those of about a hundred booted men.  A strong force of German Askaris, supported by a \"white\" body of troops with machine guns and mule batteries, were retiring in a north-westerly direction, while a small detachment had broken off and was making almost north-east.  It was against the latter party that the Nth Waffs were to operate, since it was recognised that a small, mobile, and determined body of the enemy would give almost if not quite as much trouble as a large and consequently more cumbersome force hampered with guns in a difficult country.  \"Hullo!\" exclaimed Wilmshurst, as a couple of Haussa scouts hurriedly and stealthily rejoined the advance guard.  \"Tarry Barrel and Spot Cash have tumbled upon something.\"  \"Hun he lib for stop, sah,\" reported Tari Barl.  \"Stopping to make fight?\" asked the subaltern eagerly.  The Haussa shook his head, and moved his jaw after the manner of a person eating.  \"Lib for stop for grub,\" he exclaimed.  \"After that on him go.\"  \"How far?\" demanded Wilmshurst.  Tari Barl indicated that the scouts had followed two distinct spoors for more than a couple of miles without actually sighting any of the retiring enemy.  Acting upon this information the advance guard marched into the ground on which the Huns had recently halted.  Examination of the refuse and other traces revealed the fact that the enemy had been there but a few hours previously, for the ashes of the extinguished fires were still hot.  That the march had been resumed in a leisurely manner, showing that as yet the hostile detachment was unaware of the close pursuit, was evident by the systematic way in which the fires had been put out and earth thrown lightly over the embers.  \"We'll halt just beyond this spot,\" decided the company major, when the rest of the four platoons joined the advance guard.  \"Hanged if I fancy bivouacking on the site of a Boche camp.  What do you think of the fresh spoors, MacGregor?\"  \"That's the principal line of retreat, I think,\" replied the Rhodesian. \"They can't go very much farther, for it will be pitch black in twenty minutes.\"'  \"Just so,\" agreed the major.  \"Set the men to work, Mr. Wilmshurst. Mr. Laxdale, you will please send a runner to the colonel and tell him that we've proposed bivouacking here till dawn.\"  Until it was quite dark the Haussas toiled, building sangars and constructing light connecting trenches with abattis of sharp thorns sufficient to deter and hold up a rush of bare-footed Askaris, since there was no knowing that after all the enemy had been informed of the presence of the pursuing column.  In silence the men ate their rations, no fires being allowed, and sentries to outlying piquets having been posted, the troops slept beside their piled arms.  \"What do you think of our chance of overtaking the bounders?\" enquired Wilmshurst of MacGregor, as the former prepared to visit the sentries.  \"We ought to surprise them just after dawn,\" replied the Rhodesian. \"I'm just off to see the major and get his permission to try and discover their position.\"  \"But it's pitch dark,\" remarked Dudley.  \"You couldn't see your hand in front of your face.  Man, you'd be bushed for a dead cert.\"  \"I don't know so much about that,\" replied MacGregor confidently.  \"The fellows up at Umfuli often used to chaff me, saying that I had eyes like a cat.  Believe I have.  At any rate I'll risk it, and if I'm not back an hour before dawn my name's not MacGregor.\"  \"Let me know if the major agrees,\" said Wilmshurst.  \"I don't want my sentries to take pot shots at you when you return--and they are all jolly good marksmen,\" he added in a tone of pride, for he had good reason to pin his faith upon the Haussas' accuracy with a rifle.  It was not long before MacGregor returned.  \"Fixed it up all right,\" he announced, \"and now I'm off.  If, just before dawn, you hear the cry of a gnu you'll know it's this johnny returning, so please keep the sentries well in hand.\"  The subaltern accompanied the Rhodesian past the alert sentries; then, with Wilmshurst's good wishes for the best of luck, MacGregor vanished into the night.  In vain the young officer strained his ears to catch the faint noise of the Rhodesian's footsteps or the crackle of a dry twig under the pressure of his boot, but not a sound did the scout give of his progress.  \"Hanged if I'd like to take on his job,\" soliloquised Dudley, as he slowly felt his way to the next pair of sentries.  \"I'd have a shot at it if I were told off for it, of course, but this darkness seems to have weight--to press upon a fellow's eyes.  S'pose it'll end in having to send out parties to bring the fellow in.\"  Truth to tell, Wilmshurst was not particularly keen on his brother's chum.  Why, he could hardly explain.  It might have had something to do with MacGregor's conduct when the lioness charged.  But since then the Rhodesian had shown considerable pluck and grit, and his voluntary offer to plunge into the bush on a pitch dark night was a great factor in his favour, in Dudley's opinion.  The subaltern's soliloquy was cut short by the dull glint of steel within a few inches of his chest--even in the darkness all bayonets seem to possess self-contained luminosity--and a voice hissed, \"Who come?\"  Reassuring the sentries--there were two at each post--Wilmshurst received the report that everything was all correct.  \"Macgreg, him go,\" declared one of the Haussas, Macgreg being the name by which the Rhodesian was known to the black troops.  Wilmshurst was astonished.  He had heard nothing of the scout's movements, yet the sentry, fifty yards away, had declared quite blandly that MacGregor had passed the outlying post.  \"How do you know that, Brass Pot?\" asked the subaltern.  The Haussa chuckled audibly, and holding his rifle obliquely with the bayonet thrust into the ground, placed his ear to the butt.  \"Macgreg him go and go,\" he answered, meaning that the Rhodesian was still on the move.  In vain Wilmshurst tested the sound-conducting properties of the rifle. Normally of good hearing he failed to detect what to Private Brass Pot was an accepted and irrefutable fact.  \"Very good,\" said the subaltern, without admitting his failure.  \"If you hear foot of Macgreg come this way before sergeant come for reliefs then you send and tell me.  Savvy?\"  \"Berry good, sah,\" replied the Haussa.  Having twice visited the sentries Wilmshurst returned to the bivouac to snatch a few hours' sleep.  It seemed as if he had only just dozed off when he was awakened by Sergeant Beta Moshi,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26642"],["title","Wilmshurst of the Frontier Force (#7)"],["body"," informed him that the men were already standing to and that the brief tropical dawn was stealing across the sky.  \"Has Macgreg returned, Bela Moshi?\" asked Wilmshurst, stretching his cramped limbs, for he had not removed his boots during the last forty-eight hours, and with the exception of a brief interval had been on his feet practically the whole of that time.  \"MacGregor?\" exclaimed Laxdale, who happened to overhear his brother-officer's question.  \"Yes--rather.  It seems that he struck our main camp about an hour or so ago.  The colonel's sent to say that we are to attempt an enveloping movement.  The Boches are in force on a kopje about five miles on our right front--about eight hundred of 'em according to MacGregor's report.\"  \"That's good,\" declared Wilmshurst.  All the same he felt rather sceptical.  The spoor of the right-hand column of the retiring Huns hardly bore out the Rhodesian's statement, but evidently the scout knew his business.  \"Is MacGregor accompanying us?\" he asked, as the three subalterns prepared to rejoin their respective platoons.  \"Fancy not,\" replied Danvers.  \"He's pretty well done up, I imagine. The scrub's a bit thick out there, and a fellow can't crawl far without picking up a few thorns.  Plucky blighter, what?\"  \"A\" Company was to work round to the right of the hostile position, \"B\" operating to the left, both having two hours' start of the remainder of the battalion, which was to deliver a frontal attack simultaneously with the flanking movement.  With the night-mists still hanging in dense patches over the scrub tactics were resumed.  Wilmshurst had good reason to be delighted with his men as the scouts and advance guards slipped off to their detailed positions.  At a hundred yards they were lost to sight and sound, threading their way with the utmost caution through the long grass like experienced hunters stalking their prey, while the various units kept well in touch with each other by means of reliable runners.  Other methods of communication were out of the question.  Flag-waving and heliograph would have \"given the show away\" with the utmost certainty.  All feelings of physical tiredness vanishing under the magic spell of impending action, Wilmshurst led his extended platoon toward their allotted positions.  It was slow work.  The ground was difficult; every spot likely to afford concealment to a hostile sniper had to be carefully examined.  The absence of bird life was ominous.  It meant that either the returning Huns had disturbed the feathered denizens or else the advance of the Haussas had driven them over the enemy position, in which case the wily Hun would \"smell a rat.\"  It was noon before Wilmshurst gained his preliminary objective.  The tropical sun was beating down with terrific violence, the scrub offering scant shelter from its scorching rays.  Already the previously-dew-sodden ground was baked stone-hard, the radiating heat imparting an appearance of motion to every object within sight.  Literally stewing, the subaltern threw himself flat on the ground under the slight shadow of a dried thorn bush, and waited, at intervals sweeping the bare outlines of the kopje with his prismatic glasses.  Thirty long drawn-out minutes passed.  According to plan the enveloping movement ought to have been completed an hour ago, but not a sign was given that \"B\" Company had arrived at their position--a sun-baked donga at a distance of fifteen hundred yards behind the kopje.  Up crept Bela Moshi, his ebony features distended in a most cheerful looking grin.  \"Hun him lib for sit down, sah!\" he reported.  \"Five Bosh-bosh (his rendering of the word Boche) an' heap Askari--say so many.\"  He opened and closed his fingers of both hands four times, meaning that the hostile post consisted of five Germans and forty native troops.  \"They saw you?\" asked the subaltern.  \"Dem no look,\" replied the sergeant.  \"Too much busy make eat.\"  \"How far away?\"  \"One tousand yards, sah,\" declared Bela Moshi.  Writing his report on a leaf of his pocketbook Wilmshurst gave the paper to Tari Barl with instructions to deliver it to the company commander.  Quickly the major's reply was received.  The hostile post was to be surrounded, but no action taken until the order was given for the concentrated rush upon the Huns holding the kopje.  As rapidly as due caution allowed the enveloping of the outpost was completed.  From his new position, less than four hundred yards from the spot where the unsuspecting Huns were bivouacking, Wilmshurst could keep them under close observation.  Three of the Germans were middle-aged men, bearded, swarthy, and dressed in coffee-coloured cotton uniform, sun helmets and gum boots. The other two were quite young men, whose attention, despite the heat, was mainly directed towards the Askaris.  Evidently some of the stores had gone adrift, for the young Huns were browbeating a number of natives, punctuating their forcible remarks by liberal applications of their schamboks, while their elders looked on in stolid but unqualified approval.  \"Dem make for one-time good shot, sah!\" whispered Bela Moshi, calmly setting the backsight of his rifle.  \"Blow Bosh-bosh him head-bone inside out an' him not know anyting.\"  \"Go steady, Bela Moshi,\" cautioned the subaltern.  \"Pass the word for the men to fire one volley over their heads--but not before I give orders--and then rush them with the bayonet.  We want them alive, remember.\"  A whistle rang out faintly away on the left.  The call was repeated much nearer, while distinct blasts rose through the heated air.  It was the signal for the advance.  Almost as soon as Wilmshurst put his whistle to his lips a crisp volley from the rifles of his platoon rent the welkin, then with fierce shouts the khaki-clad, barefooted Waffs leapt to their feet, their bayonets glittering in the sun.  At first, too utterly astonished to realise that they were hopelessly trapped and outnumbered, the Huns stood stock still, gazing stupidly at the converging ring of steel.  The Askaris for the most part attempted to bolt, but finding their retreat cut off, grovelled in the dust.  \"Hands up!\" shouted Wilmshurst.  The three bearded Huns obeyed promptly and meekly.  Of the others one held up his arms with sullen reluctance, his flabby face distorted with rage.  The fifth, dropping on one knee, picked up a rifle and levelled it at the on-rushing British officer.  \"The fellow's showing pluck, by Jove!\" was the thought that flashed through Dudley's mind.  Like all brave men he admired courage even in a foe.  The fact that running over rough ground and firing a revolver at fifty yards did not give him much chance against a steadily held rifle entered into his calculations.  Before the Hun could press trigger a score of rifles spoke.  The Waffs, on seeing their young officer's danger, took no chances, and the German, his head and chest riddled with bullets, toppled over stone dead upon the ground.  As he fell his fingers closed convulsively against the trigger of his rifle and the bullet intended for Wilmshurst sung past the subaltern's left ear.  A loud yell from the other young Hun proclaimed the fact that he, too, was hit.  A bullet fired at the resisting German had been deflected, passing through the fleshy part of his comrade's left arm.  It was hard luck on a surrendered prisoner, but on these occasions luck, both good and bad, crops up at every available opportunity.  \"Sorry, Fritz,\" exclaimed Wilmshurst apologetically.  \"Accident, you know.\"  There was no time for explanation.  Directing a Haussa to attend to the Hun's injury and ordering others to round up and disarm the prisoners Wilmshurst hurried his men to the storming of the kopje.  On all sides the Waffs were climbing the slopes, yelling and cheering vociferously, but not an answering shout came from the rocky summit. It required enormous restraint on the part of the foe to withhold their fire, while already the Haussas had passed the zone where a volley at comparatively short range would have played havoc with them.  The silence on the part of the enemy seemed incomprehensible unless, not having sufficient numbers to hold the edges of the flat-topped hill they had concentrated at one spot, where with machine-guns they could rake the skyline as the Waffs breasted the top.  Over the position the exultant troops poured, the one fly in the ointment being the fact that their rush had met with no resistance.  In extended order they re-formed and dashed across the plateau--a rapidly contracting line of khaki tipped with steel.  Almost in the centre of the top of the kopje was an irregular mound of piled rocks and earth.  Towards this the Waffs charged, their officers momentarily expecting the rattle of musketry and the tic-tac of machine-guns.  Without resistance the Waffs bore on, overran the supposed earthworks and found--nothing.  There were not even traces of Hun occupation.  The enemy had got clear away with the exception of the small post rushed by Wilmshurst's platoon.  By an evident error of judgment on the part of MacGregor--a non-existent position had been the object of the column's attention, and although the operations were not entirely futile officers and men realised that they had experienced a great disappointment.  Descending the kopje the Waffs fell in, having secured their prisoners under a strong escort.  The order to march was about to be given when the distant rattle of musketry was distinctly heard.  The colonel looked at the senior major enquiringly.  \"A raiding crush, sir,\" replied the latter to the unspoken question. \"While we've been on a wild goose chase Fritz is raiding our camp.\"     CHAPTER VI  THE WARNING SHOT  Nobly the sorely-tried Waffs rose to the occasion.  Notwithstanding their arduous advance and its meagre results they eagerly hastened to meet the new danger, knowing that with the destruction of their baggage and transport and their lines of communication cut they"]]]
