But, almost immediately recovering herself, she launched a last projectile at her adversary.  “Oh! oh!” said she; “I have heard of many of these sorts of promises beforehand, which often lead people to flatter themselves with wild hopes, and at the last moment, when the time comes to keep the promises, and have the hopes realized, they are surprised to see the great credit upon which they reckoned vanish like smoke.”  “Oh! madame, the credit of my protector is incontestable and his promises are as good as deeds.”  “And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful protector?”  “Oh! _mon Dieu!_ no! it is that gentleman there,” said Montalais, pointing to Malicorne, who, during this scene, had preserved the most imperturbable coolness, and the most comic dignity.  “Monsieur!” cried Madame de Saint-Remy, with an explosion of hilarity, “monsieur is your protector! Is the man whose credit is so powerful, and whose promises are as good as deeds, Monsieur Malicorne!”  Malicorne bowed.  As to Montalais, as her sole reply, she drew the brevet from her pocket, and showed it to the old lady.  “Here is the _brevet_,” said she.  At once all was over. As soon as she had cast a rapid glance over this fortunate _brevet_, the good lady clasped her hands, an unspeakable expression of envy and despair contracted her countenance, and she was obliged to sit down to avoid fainting. Montalais was not malicious enough to rejoice extravagantly at her victory, or to overwhelm the conquered enemy, particularly when that enemy was the mother of her friend; she used then, but did not abuse her triumph. Malicorne was less generous; he assumed noble _poses_ in his _fauteuil_ and stretched himself out with a familiarity which, two hours earlier, would have drawn upon him threats of a caning.  “Maid of honor to the young madame!” repeated Madame de Saint-Remy, still but half convinced.  “Yes, madame, and through the protection of M. Malicorne, moreover.”  “It is incredible!” repeated the old lady: “is it not incredible, Louise?” But Louise did not reply; she was sitting, thoughtfully, almost sad; passing one had over her beautiful brow, she sighed heavily.  “Well, but, monsieur,” said Madame de Saint-Remy, all at once, “how did you manage to obtain this post?”  “I asked for it, madame.”  “Of whom?”  “One of my friends.”  “And you have friends sufficiently powerful at court to give you such proofs of their credit?”  “It appears so.”  “And may one ask the name of these friends?”  “I did not say I had many friends, madame, I said I had one friend.”  “And that friend is called?”  “_Peste!_ madame, you go too far! When one has a friend as powerful as mine, we do not publish his name in that fashion, in open day, in order that he may be stolen from us.”  “You are right, monsieur, to be silent as to that name; for I think it would be pretty difficult for you to tell it.”  “At all events,” said Montalais, “if the friend does not exist, the _brevet_ does, and that cuts short the question.”  “Then, I conceive,” said Madame de Saint-Remy, with the gracious smile of the cat who is going to scratch, “when I found monsieur here just now--”  “Well?”  “He brought you the _brevet_.”  “Exactly, madame; you have guessed rightly.”  “Well, then, nothing can be more moral or proper.”  “I think so, madame.”  “And I have been wrong, as it appears, in reproaching you, mademoiselle.”  “Very wrong, madame; but I am so accustomed to your reproaches, that I pardon you these.”  “In that case, let us begone, Louise; we have nothing to do but retire. Well!”  “Madame!” said La Valliere starting, “did you speak?”  “You do not appear to be listening, my child.”  “No, madame, I was thinking.”  “About what?”  “A thousand things.”  “You bear me no ill-will, at least, Louise?” cried Montalais, pressing her hand.  “And why should I, my dear Aure?” replied the girl in a voice soft as a flute.  “_Dame!_” resumed Madame de Saint-Remy; “if she did bear you a little ill-will, poor girl, she could not be much blamed.”  “And why should she bear me ill-will, good gracious?”  “It appears to me that she is of as good a family, and as pretty as you.”  “Mother! mother!” cried Louise.  “Prettier a hundred times, madame--not of a better family; but that does not tell me why Louise should bear me ill-will.”  “Do you think it will be very amusing for her to be buried alive at Blois, when you are going to shine at Paris?”  “But, madame, it is not I who prevent Louise following me thither; on the contrary, I should certainly be most happy if she came there.”  “But it appears that M. Malicorne, who is all-powerful at court--”  “Ah! so much the worse, madame,” said Malicorne, “every one for himself in this poor world.”  “Malicorne! Malicorne!” said Montalais. Then stooping towards the young man:--  “Occupy Madame de Saint-Remy, either in disputing with her, or making it up with her; I must speak to Louise.” And, at the same time, a soft pressure of the hand recompensed Malicorne for his future obedience. Malicorne went grumbling towards Madame de Saint-Remy, whilst Montalais said to her friend, throwing one arm around her neck:--  “What is the matter? Tell _me_. Is it true that you would not love me if I were to shine, as your mother says?”  “Oh, no!” said the young girl, with difficulty restraining her tears; “on the contrary, I rejoice at your good fortune.”  “Rejoice! why, one would say you are ready to cry!”  “Do people never weep except from envy?”  “Oh! yes, I understand; I am going to Paris and that word Paris recalls to your mind a certain cavalier--”  “Aure!”  “A certain cavalier who formerly lived near Blois, and who now resides at Paris.”  “In truth, I know not what ails me, but I feel stifled.”  “Weep, then, weep, as you cannot give me a smile!”  Louise raised her sweet face, which the tears, rolling down one after the other, illumined like diamonds.  “Come, confess,” said Montalais.  “What shall I confess?”  “What makes you weep; people don’t weep without cause. I am your friend; whatever you would wish me to do, I will do. Malicorne is more powerful than you would think. Do you wish to go to Paris?”  “Alas!” sighed Louise.  “Do you wish to come to Paris?”  “To remain here alone, in this old castle, I who have enjoyed the delightful habit of listening to your songs, of pressing your hand, of running about the park with you. Oh! how I shall be _ennuyee!_ how quickly I shall die!”  “Do you wish to come to Paris?”  Louise breathed another sigh.  “You do not answer me.”  “What would you that I should reply?”  “Yes or no; that is not very difficult, I think.”  “Oh! you are very fortunate, Montalais!”  “That is to say you would like to be in my place.”  Louise was silent.  “Little obstinate thing!” said Montalais; “did ever any one keep her secrets from her friend thus? But, confess that you would like to come to Paris; confess that you are dying with the wish to see Raoul again.”  “I cannot confess that.”  “Then you are wrong.”  “In what way?”  “Because--do you not see this _brevet?_”  “To be sure I do.”  “Well, I would have got you a similar one.”  “By whose means?”  “Malicorne’s.”  “Aure, are you telling the truth? Is that possible?”  “Malicorne is there; and what he has done for me, he surely can do for you.”  Malicorne had heard his name pronounced twice; he was delighted at having an opportunity of coming to a conclusion with Madame de Saint-Remy, and he turned round:--  “What is the question, mademoiselle?”  “Come hither, Malicorne,” said Montalais, with an imperious gesture. Malicorne obeyed.  “A _brevet_ like this,” said Montalais.  “How so?”  “A _brevet_ like this; that is plain enough.”  “But--”  “I want one--I must have one!”  “Oh! oh! you must have one!”  “Yes.”  “It is impossible, is it not, M. Malicorne?” said Louise, with her sweet, soft voice.  “If it is for _you_, mademoiselle--”  “For me. Yes, Monsieur Malicorne, it _would_ be for me.”  “And if Mademoiselle de Montalais asks it at the same time--”  “Mademoiselle de Montalais does not ask it, she requires it.”  “Well! we will endeavor to obey you, mademoiselle.”  “And you will have her named?”  “We will try.”  “No evasive answers, Louise de la Valliere shall be maid of honor to Madame Henrietta within a week.”  “How you talk!”  “Within a week, or else--”  “Well! or else?”  “You may take back your _brevet_, Monsieur Malicorne; I will not leave my friend.”  “Dear Montalais!”  “That is right. Keep your _brevet_; Mademoiselle de la Valliere shall be a maid of honor.”  “Is that true?”  “Quite true.”  “I may then hope to go to Paris?”  “Depend on it.”  “Oh! Monsieur Malicorne, what joy!” cried Louise, clapping her hands, and bounding with pleasure.  “Little dissembler!” said Montalais, “try again to make me believe you are not in love with Raoul.”  Louise blushed like a rose in June, but instead of replying, she ran and embraced her mother. “Madame,” said she, “do you know that M. Malicorne is going to have me appointed maid of honor?”  “M. Malicorne is a prince in disguise,” replied the old lady, “he is all-powerful, seemingly.”  “Should you also like to be a maid of honor?” asked Malicorne of Madame de Saint-Remy. “Whilst I am about it, I might as well get everybody appointed.”  And upon that he went away, leaving the poor lady quite disconcerted.  “Humph!” murmured Malicorne as he descended the stairs,--“Humph! there goes another note of a thousand livres! but I must get through as well as I can; my friend Manicamp does nothing for nothing.” "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],["title","Ten Years Later (#5)"],["body","   Chapter IV. Malicorne and Manicamp.  The introduction of these two new personages into this history and that mysterious affinity of names and sentiments, merit some attention on the part of both historian and reader. We will then enter into some details concerning Messieurs Malicorne and Manicamp. Malicorne, we know, had made the journey to Orleans in search of the _brevet_ destined for Mademoiselle de Montalais, the arrival of which had produced such a strong feeling at the castle of Blois. At that moment, M. de Manicamp was at Orleans. A singular person was this M. de Manicamp; a very intelligent young fellow, always poor, always needy, although he dipped his hand freely into the purse of M. le Comte de Guiche, one of the best furnished purses of the period. M. le Comte de Guiche had had, as the companion of his boyhood, this De Manicamp, a poor gentleman, vassal-born, of the house of Gramont. M. de Manicamp, with his tact and talent had created himself a revenue in the opulent family of the celebrated marechal. From his infancy he had, with calculation beyond his age, lent his mane and complaisance to the follies of the Comte de Guiche. If his noble companion had stolen some fruit destined for Madame la Marechale, if he had broken a mirror, or put out a dog’s eye, Manicamp declared himself guilty of the crime committed, and received the punishment, which was not made the milder for falling on the innocent. But this was the way this system of abnegation was paid for: instead of wearing such mean habiliments as his paternal fortunes entitled him to, he was able to appear brilliant, superb, like a young noble of fifty thousand livres a year. It was not that he was mean in character or humble in spirit; no, he was a philosopher, or rather he had the indifference, the apathy, the obstinacy which banish from man every sentiment of the supernatural. His sole ambition was to spend money. But, in this respect, the worthy M. de Manicamp was a gulf. Three or four times every year he drained the Comte de Guiche, and when the Comte de Guiche was thoroughly drained, when he had turned out his pockets and his purse before him, when he declared that it would be at least a fortnight before paternal munificence would refill those pockets and that purse, Manicamp lost all his energy, he went to bed, remained there, ate nothing and sold his handsome clothes, under the pretense that, remaining in bed, he did not want them. During this prostration of mind and strength, the purse of the Comte de Guiche was getting full again, and when once filled, overflowed into that of De Manicamp, who bought new clothes, dressed himself again, and recommenced the same life he had followed before. The mania of selling his new clothes for a quarter of what they were worth, had rendered our hero sufficiently celebrated in Orleans, a city where, in general, we should be puzzled to say why he came to pass his days of penitence. Provincial _debauches, petits-maitres_ of six hundred livres a year, shared the fragments of his opulence.  Among the admirers of these splendid toilettes, our friend Malicorne was conspicuous; he was the son of a syndic of the city, of whom M. de Conde, always needy as a De Conde, often borrowed money at enormous interest. M. Malicorne kept the paternal money-chest; that is to say, that in those times of easy morals, he had made for himself, by following the example of his father, and lending at high interest for short terms, a revenue of eighteen hundred livres, without reckoning six hundred livres furnished by the generosity of the syndic; so that Malicorne was the king of the gay youth of Orleans, having two thousand four hundred livres to scatter, squander, and waste on follies of every kind. But, quite contrary to Manicamp, Malicorne was terribly ambitious. He loved from ambition; he spent money out of ambition; and he would have ruined himself for ambition. Malicorne had determined to rise, at whatever price it might cost, and for this, whatever price it did cost, he had given himself a mistress and a friend. The mistress, Mademoiselle de Montalais, was cruel, as regarded love; but she was of a noble family, and that was sufficient for Malicorne. The friend had little or no friendship, but he was the favorite of the Comte de Guiche, himself the friend of Monsieur, the king’s brother; and that was sufficient for Malicorne. Only, in the chapter of charges, Mademoiselle de Montalais cost _per annum_:--ribbons, gloves, and sweets, a thousand livres. De Manicamp cost--money lent, never returned--from twelve to fifteen hundred livres _per annum_. So that there was nothing left for Malicorne. Ah! yes, we are mistaken; there was left the paternal strong box. He employed a mode of proceeding, upon which he preserved the most profound secrecy, and which consisted in advancing to himself, from the coffers of the syndic, half a dozen year’s profits, that is to say, fifteen thousand livres, swearing to himself--observe, quite to himself--to repay this deficiency as soon as an opportunity should present itself. The opportunity was expected to be the concession of a good post in the household of Monsieur, when that household would be established at the period of his marriage. This juncture had arrived, and the household was about to be established. A good post in the family of a prince of the blood, when it is given by the credit, and on the recommendation of a friend, like the Comte de Guiche, is worth at least twelve thousand livres _per annum_; and by the means which M. Malicorne had taken to make his revenues fructify, twelve thousand livres might rise to twenty thousand. Then, when once an incumbent of this post, he would marry Mademoiselle de Montalais. Mademoiselle de Montalais, of a half noble family, not only would be dowered, but would ennoble Malicorne. But, in order that Mademoiselle de Montalais, who had not a large patrimonial fortune, although an only daughter, should be suitably dowered, it was necessary that she should belong to some great princess, as prodigal as the dowager Madame was covetous. And in order that the wife should not be of one party whilst the husband belonged to the other, a situation which presents serious inconveniences, particularly with characters like those of the future consorts--Malicorne had imagined the idea of making the central point of union the household of Monsieur, the king’s brother. Mademoiselle de Montalais would be maid of honor to Madame. M. Malicorne would be officer to Monsieur.  It is plain the plan was formed by a clear head; it is plain, also, that it had been bravely executed. Malicorne had asked Manicamp to ask a _brevet_ of maid of honor of the Comte de Guiche; and the Comte de Guiche had asked this _brevet_ of Monsieur, who had signed it without hesitation. The constructive plan of Malicorne--for we may well suppose that the combinations of a mind as active as his were not confined to the present, but extended to the future--the constructive plan of Malicorne, we say, was this:--To obtain entrance into the household of Madame Henrietta for a woman devoted to himself, who was intelligent, young, handsome, and intriguing; to learn, by means of this woman, all the feminine secrets of the young household; whilst he, Malicorne, and his friend Manicamp, should, between them, know all the male secrets of the young community. It was by these means that a rapid and splendid fortune might be acquired at one and the same time. Malicorne was a vile name; he who bore it had too much wit to conceal this truth from himself; but an estate might be purchased; and Malicorne of some place, or even De Malicorne itself, for short, would ring more nobly on the ear.  It was not improbable that a most aristocratic origin might be hunted up by the heralds for this name of Malicorne; might it not come from some estate where a bull with mortal horns had caused some great misfortune, and baptized the soil with the blood it had spilt? Certes, this plan presented itself bristling with difficulties: but the greatest of all was Mademoiselle de Montalais herself. Capricious, variable, close, giddy, free, prudish, a virgin armed with claws, Erigone stained with grapes, she sometimes overturned, with a single dash of her white fingers, or with a single puff from her laughing lips, the edifice which had exhausted Malicorne’s patience for a month.  Love apart, Malicorne was happy; but this love, which he could not help feeling, he had the strength to conceal with care; persuaded that at the least relaxing of the ties by which he had bound his Protean female, the demon would overthrow and laugh at him. He humbled his mistress by disdaining her. Burning with desire, when she advanced to tempt him, he had the art to appear ice, persuaded that if he opened his arms, she would run away laughing at him. On her side, Montalais believed she did not love Malicorne; whilst, on the contrary, in reality she did. Malicorne repeated to her so often his protestation of indifference, that she finished, sometimes, by believing him; and then she believed she detested Malicorne. If she tried to bring him back by coquetry, Malicorne played the coquette better than she could. But what made Montalais hold to Malicorne in an indissoluble fashion, was that Malicorne always came cram full of fresh news from the court and the city; Malicorne always brought to Blois a fashion, a secret, or a perfume; that Malicorne never asked for a meeting, but, on the contrary, required to be supplicated to receive the favors he burned to obtain. On her side, Montalais was no miser with stories. By her means, Malicorne learnt all that passed at Blois, in the family of the dowager Madame; and he related to Manicamp tales that made him ready to die with laughing, which the latter, out of idleness, took ready-made to M. de Guiche, who carried them to Monsieur.  Such, in two words, was the woof of petty interests and petty conspiracies which"]]]
