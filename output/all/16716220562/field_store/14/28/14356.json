Cracking, munching, chewing, nibbling, sucking, and swallowing, Porthos occasionally said to the grocer:  “You do a very good business here, friend Planchet.”  “He will very soon have none at all to do, if this sort of thing continues,” grumbled the foreman, who had Planchet’s word that he should be his successor. In the midst of his despair, he approached Porthos, who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop itself. He hoped that Porthos would rise and that this movement would distract his devouring ideas.  “What do you want, my man?” asked Porthos, affably.  “I should like to pass you, monsieur, if it is not troubling you too much.”  “Very well,” said Porthos, “it does not trouble me in the least.”  At the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband, lifted him off the ground, and placed him very gently on the other side, smiling all the while with the same affable expression. As soon as Porthos had placed him on the ground, the lad’s legs so shook under him that he fell back upon some sacks of corks. But noticing the giant’s gentleness of manner, he ventured again, and said:  “Ah, monsieur! pray be careful.”  “What about?” inquired Porthos.  “You are positively putting a fiery furnace into your body.”  “How is that, my good fellow?”  “All those things are very heating to the system!”  “Which?”  “Raisins, nuts, and almonds.”  “Yes; but if raisins, nuts, and almonds are heating--”  “There is no doubt at all of it, monsieur.”  “Honey is very cooling,” said Porthos, stretching out his hand toward a small barrel of honey which was open, and he plunged the scoop with which the wants of the customers were supplied into it, and swallowed a good half-pound at one gulp.  “I must trouble you for some water now, my man,” said Porthos.  “In a pail, monsieur?” asked the lad, simply.  “No, in a water-bottle; that will be quite enough;” and raising the bottle to his mouth, as a trumpeter does his trumpet, he emptied the bottle at a single draught.  Planchet was agitated in every fibre of propriety and self-esteem. However, a worthy representative of the hospitality which prevailed in early days, he feigned to be talking very earnestly with D’Artagnan, and incessantly repeated:--“Ah! monsieur, what a happiness! what an honor!”  “What time shall we have supper, Planchet?” inquired Porthos, “I feel hungry.”  The foreman clasped his hands together. The two others got under the counters, fearing Porthos might have a taste for human flesh.  “We shall only take a sort of snack here,” said D’Artagnan; “and when we get to Planchet’s country-seat, we will have supper.”  “Ah, ah! so we are going to your country-house, Planchet,” said Porthos; “so much the better.”  “You overwhelm me, monsieur le baron.”  The “monsieur le baron” had a great effect upon the men, who detected a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind. This title, too, reassured them. They had never heard that an ogre was ever called “monsieur le baron”.  “I will take a few biscuits to eat on the road,” said Porthos, carelessly; and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge pocket of his doublet.  “My shop is saved!” exclaimed Planchet.  “Yes, as the cheese was,” whispered the foreman.  “What cheese?”  “The Dutch cheese, inside which a rat had made his way, and we found only the rind left.”  Planchet looked all round his shop, and observing the different articles which had escaped Porthos’s teeth, he found the comparison somewhat exaggerated. The foreman, who remarked what was passing in his master’s mind, said, “Take care; he is not gone yet.”  “Have you any fruit here?” said Porthos, as he went upstairs to the _entresol_, where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared.  “Alas!” thought the grocer, addressing a look at D’Artagnan full of entreaty, which the latter half understood.  As soon as they had finished eating they set off. It was late when the three riders, who had left Paris about six in the evening, arrived at Fontainebleau. The journey passed very agreeably. Porthos took a fancy to Planchet’s society, because the latter was very respectful in his manners, and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his woods, and his rabbit-warrens. Porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor. When D’Artagnan saw his two companions in earnest conversation, he took the opposite side of the road, and letting his bridle drop upon his horse’s neck, separated himself from the whole world, as he had done from Porthos and from Planchet. The moon shone softly through the foliage of the forest. The breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfumed to the horse’s nostrils, and they snorted and pranced along delightedly. Porthos and Planchet began to talk about hay-crops. Planchet admitted to Porthos that in the advanced years of his life, he had certainly neglected agricultural pursuits for commerce, but that his childhood had been passed in Picardy in the beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees, and where he had played under the green apple-trees covered with red-cheeked fruit; he went on to say, that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune, he would return to nature, and end his days, as he had begun them, as near as he possibly could to the earth itself, where all men must sleep at last.  “Eh, eh!” said Porthos; “in that case, my dear Monsieur Planchet, your retirement is not far distant.”  “How so?”  “Why, you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon.”  “Well, we are getting on pretty well, I must admit,” replied Planchet.  “Come, tell me what is the extent of your ambition, and what is the amount you intend to retire upon?”  “There is one circumstance, monsieur,” said Planchet, without answering the question, “which occasions me a good deal of anxiety.”  “What is it?” inquired Porthos, looking all round him as if in search of the circumstance that annoyed Planchet, and desirous of freeing him from it.  “Why, formerly,” said the grocer, “you used to call me Planchet quite short, and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner than you do now.”  “Certainly, certainly, I should have said so formerly,” replied the good-natured Porthos, with an embarrassment full of delicacy; “but formerly--”  “Formerly I was M. d’Artagnan’s lackey; is not that what you mean?”  “Yes.”  “Well if I am not quite his lackey, I am as much as ever I was his devoted servant; and more than that, since that time--”  “Well, Planchet?”  “Since that time, I have had the honor of being in partnership with him.”  “Oh, oh!” said Porthos. “What, has D’Artagnan gone into the grocery business?”  “No, no,” said D’Artagnan, whom these words had drawn out of his reverie, and who entered into the conversation with that readiness and rapidity which distinguished every operation of his mind and body. “It was not D’Artagnan who entered into the grocery business, but Planchet who entered into a political affair with me.”  “Yes,” said Planchet, with mingled pride and satisfaction, “we transacted a little business which brought me in a hundred thousand francs and M. d’Artagnan two hundred thousand.”  “Oh, oh!” said Porthos, with admiration.  “So that, monsieur le baron,” continued the grocer, “I again beg you to be kind enough to call me Planchet, as you used to do; and to speak to me as familiarly as in old times. You cannot possibly imagine the pleasure it would give me.”  “If that be the case, my dear Planchet, I will do so, certainly,”  replied Porthos. And as he was quite close to Planchet, he raised his hand, as if to strike him on the shoulder, in token of friendly cordiality; but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim, so that his hand fell on the crupper of Planchet’s horse, instead; which made the animal’s legs almost give way.  D’Artagnan burst out laughing, as he said, “Take care, Planchet; for if Porthos begins to like you so much, he will caress you, and if he caresses you he will knock you as flat as a pancake. Porthos is still as strong as ever, you know.”  “Oh,” said Planchet, “Mousqueton is not dead, and yet monsieur le baron is very fond of him.”  “Certainly,” said Porthos, with a sigh which made all the three horses rear; “and I was only saying, this very morning, to D’Artagnan, how much I regretted him. But tell me, Planchet?”  “Thank you, monsieur le baron, thank you.”  “Good lad, good lad! How many acres of park have you got?”  “Of park?”  “Yes; we will reckon up the meadows presently, and the woods afterwards.”  “Whereabouts, monsieur?” “At your chateau.”  “Oh, monsieur le baron, I have neither chateau, nor park, nor meadows, nor woods.”  “What have you got, then?” inquired Porthos, “and why do you call it a country-seat?”  “I did not call it a country-seat, monsieur le baron,” replied Planchet, somewhat humiliated, “but a country-box.”  “Ah, ah! I understand. You are modest.”  “No, monsieur le baron, I speak the plain truth. I have rooms for a couple of friends, that’s all.”  “But in that case, whereabouts do your friends walk?”  “In the first place, they can walk about the king’s forest, which is very beautiful.”  “Yes, I know the forest is very fine,” said Porthos; “nearly as beautiful as my forest at Berry.”  Planchet opened his eyes very wide. “Have you a forest of the same kind as the forest at Fontainebleau, monsieur le baron?” he stammered out.  “Yes; I have two, indeed, but the one at Berry is my favorite.”  “Why so?” asked Planchet.  “Because I don’t know where it ends; and, also, because it is full of poachers.”  “How can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you?”  “Because they hunt my game, and I hunt them--which, in these peaceful times, is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale.”  They had reached this turn of conversation, when Planchet, looking up, perceived the houses at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27101"],["title","Life of Rear Admiral John Randolph Tucker (#0)"],["body","made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)              *       *       *       *       *      +-----------------------------------------------------------+     | Transcriber's Note:                                       |     |                                                           |     | Inconsistent hyphenation in the original document has     |     | been preserved.                                           |     |                                                           |     | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.

JAMES HENRY ROCHELLE, the author of the following pages, and the subject of this sketch, was of French-English and Celtic, or Scotch-Irish, extraction--English through his paternal great-grandmother, who was the daughter of Hinchia Gilliam, and his wife (née) Harrison; Scotch-Irish through his maternal ancestry. The name itself proclaims its French (Huguenot) origin.  It is well known that when Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes many French Protestants, called Huguenots, fled from their homes to escape persecutions worse than death. About forty thousand took refuge in England, and in 1690 William III sent a number of them to America. A party of them made their way up the James river and made a settlement, which they called Mannakintown, or \"Manacan,\" because the lands formerly belonged to the Manacan Indians. Feeling that they no longer had to defend themselves against oppression and cruelty, and that in a free country their religion was no stigma, the characteristics of the race came out. With order and work Manacan became a flourishing town. Among those who had made a temporary home there was John Rochelle, who came with the other Huguenot exiles, and, if Pope be right, he soon enjoyed      \"All the joys of sense--     _Health, peace and competence._\"  But in a few years the spirit of discord entered among these exiles, who had found peace, liberty and homes. The three Rochelle brothers sought other homes; William settled in North Carolina, James went to South Carolina, and John bought of William and Jonas Longbottom two hundred and twelve acres of land on the south side of the Nottoway river in the then parish of Albemarle. Here he lived, and married Mary Gilliam, daughter of Hinchia Gilliam and his wife (née) Harrison. They had issue four sons--John, Levi, Hinchia and Nathaniel. John, the oldest son, married his cousin, Judith Gilliam, famed for her beauty, and they became the parents of nine children--Benjamin, John, Willis, Clements, Elizabeth (who will live in history as the mother of the famous soldier, George Henry Thomas), James, Lucy, and Mary.  James was born in the year 1786. At an early age he entered the clerk's office of his county as deputy to the then clerk, Samuel Kello. In 1815 he was chosen clerk and held the office until his death.  On the 19th of April, 1817, he married Martha (Hines) Gray, widow of Dr. Henry Mills Gray. Many children were born unto them, but only three lived beyond the early years of infancy--John, Martha and James Henry.  James Henry Rochelle was born at his father's home, near the Courthouse, on the 1st day of November, 1826. His boyhood was passed in the refining influence of a Virginia home, of the period when Virginia was the garden spot of America, when her daughters were the \"mothers of Presidents\" and her sons were statesmen, \"_Sans peur et sans reproche_.\"  On the 9th of September, 1841, he was appointed acting midshipman in the United States Navy; served six months at sea, and then received his warrant as midshipman. During the war with Mexico, young Rochelle served on both the _Falmouth_ and _Decatur_, in the gulf. He was with Commodore Perry, and participated in all the brilliant exploits of the naval forces, and remained on the Mexican coast until there was added to the United States a territory as large as Germany, France and Spain, all three added together.  In September, 1847, he reported at Annapolis, the Naval School, and was one of the 245 midshipman belonging to the famous \"Classe 41,\" which passed in 1848. He was at once ordered to the frigate _Constitution_, then in Boston harbor, ready to sail to the blue waters of the Mediterranean and the sunny coast of Italy. On this cruise he paid a visit to the beautiful and historical Island of Malta, and here, in the very cradle of Free Masonry, he"]]]
