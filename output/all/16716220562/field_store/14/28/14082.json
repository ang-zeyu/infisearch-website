They could not use what was not yet invented. They sang Gregorian because they had not Palestrina.\" Bateman: \"A paradox, a paradox.\" Campbell: \"Surely there is a close connection between the rise and nature of the Basilica and of Gregorian unison. Both existed before Christianity, both are of Pagan origin; both were afterwards consecrated to the service of the Church.\" Bateman: \"Pardon me, Gregorians were Jewish, not Pagan.\" Campbell: \"Be it so, for argument sake, still, at least, they were not of Christian origin.[58] Next, both the old music and the old architecture were inartificial and limited, as methods of exhibiting their respective arts. You can't have a large Grecian temple, you can't have a long Gregorian _Gloria_.\" Bateman: \"Not a long one, why there's poor Willis used to complain how tedious the old Gregorian compositions were abroad.\" Campbell: \"... Of course you may produce them to any length, but merely by addition, not by carrying on the melody. You can put two together, and then have one twice as long as either. But I speak of a musical piece, which must, of course, be the natural development of certain ideas, with one part depending on another. In like manner, you might make an Ionic temple twice as long or twice as wide as the Parthenon; but you would lose the beauty of proportion by doing so. This, then, is what I meant to say of the primitive architecture and the primitive music, that they soon come to their limit; they soon are exhausted, and can do nothing more. If you attempt more, it's like taxing a musical instrument beyond its powers.\"... Campbell: \"This is literally true as regards Gregorian music, instruments did not exist in primitive times which could execute any other.\"... Reding: \"... Modern music did not come into existence till after the powers of the violin became known. Corelli himself, who wrote not two hundred years ago, hardly ventures on the shift. The piano, again, I have heard, has almost given birth to Beethoven.\" Campbell: \"Modern music, then, could not be in ancient times for want of modern instruments, and, in like manner, Gothic architecture could not exist until vaulting was brought to perfection. Great mechanical inventions have taken place both in architecture and in music, since the age of Basilicas and Gregorians; and each science has gained by it.\" Reding: \"... When people who are not musicians have accused Handel and Beethoven of not being _simple_ I have always said, 'is Gothic architecture _simple_?' A Cathedral expresses one idea, but is indefinitely varied and elaborated in its parts; so is a symphony or quartet of Beethoven.\" Campbell: \"Certainly, Bateman, you must tolerate Pagan architecture, or you must in consistency exclude Pagan or Jewish Gregorians, you must tolerate figured music, or reprobate tracery windows.\" Bateman: \"And which are you for, Gothic with Handel, or Roman with Gregorian?\" Campbell: \"For both in their place. I exceedingly prefer Gothic architecture to classical. I think it is the one true child and development of Christianity; but I won't for that reason discard the Pagan style which has been sanctified by eighteen centuries, by the exclusive love of many Christian countries, and by the sanction of a host of saints. I am for toleration. Give Gothic an ascendancy; be respectful towards classical.\"... Reding: \"Much as I like modern music, I can't quite go the length to which your doctrine would lead me. I cannot, indeed, help liking Mozart; but surely his music is not religious?\" Campbell: \"I have not been speaking in defence of particular composers, figured music may be right, yet Mozart or Beethoven inadmissible. In like manner you don't suppose, because I tolerate Roman architecture, that therefore I like naked cupids to stand for cherubs, and sprawling women for the cardinal virtues.... Besides, as you were saying yourself just now, we must consult the genius of our country, and the religious associations of our people.\" Bateman: \"Well, I think the perfection of sacred music is Gregorian set to harmonies; there you have the glorious old chants, and just a little modern richness.\" Campbell: \"And I think it just the worst of all, it is a mixture of two things, each good in itself, and incongruous together. It's a mixture of the first and second courses at table. It's like the architecture of the _façade_ at Milan, half-Gothic, half-Grecian.\" Reding: \"It's what is always used, I believe.\" Campbell: \"Oh, yes, we must not go against the age, it would be absurd to do so. I only spoke of what was right and wrong on abstract principles; and to tell the truth, I can't help liking the mixture myself, though I can't defend it.\"[59]  [Footnote 58: \"I think with you that what is called Gregorian is but a _style_ of music: viz., before the fixing of the diatonic scale, and the various keys as rising out of it. The Pagan and Jewish tunes are _necessarily_ in this style. And in this sense certainly the Gregorian comes from the Pagan _and_ the Jewish. The names 'Lydian,' 'Phrygian,' &c., look like Pagan. One should think, however, some _must_ be Jewish. I can't answer your question about the genuineness of the professed specimen of Pagan, as in Rousseau's Dictionary. Will Rousseau answer your question? All true art comes from revelation, to speak generally, I do think, but not necessarily through the Jewish Dispensation,\" &c. (Dec. 1850, J.H.N.) Mozley, _Corr._ ii. 479.]  [Footnote 59: _Loss and Gain_, pp. 282-286.]  The irrepressible Bateman has Gothic and Gregorian on the brain: and in another place goes \"on boldly to declare that, if he had his will there should be no architecture in the English churches but Gothic, and no music but Gregorian. This ... gave scope for a very pretty quarrel, Reding said that all these adjuncts of worship, whether music or architecture, were national; they were the mode in which religious feeling showed itself in particular times and places. He did not mean to say that the outward expression of religion in a country might not be guided, but it could not be forced; that it was as preposterous to make people worship in one's own way, as to be merry in one's own way.'... Bateman: 'But surely ... you don't mean to say that there is no natural connection between internal feeling and outward expression, so that one form is no better than another?' Reding: 'Far from it, but let those who confine their music to Gregorians, put up crucifixes in the highways. Each is the representative of a particular locality or time.'... Campbell: 'You can't be more Catholic than Rome, I suppose, yet there's no Gothic there.' Bateman: '... Rome has corrupted the pure Apostolic doctrine, can we wonder that it should have a corrupt architecture?' Reding: 'Why, then, go to Rome for Gregorians?'\"[60]  [Footnote 60: _Loss and Gain_, p. 277.]  The foregoing would probably open out, in the eyes, say, of the accomplished author of the _Vesper Psalter_,[61] a wide field for further discussion, but so much may be fairly gathered, viz., that the Cardinal's musical views were sensible ones, even if open, theoretically, to some differences of opinion. _Omnia probate_, he seems to say, _quod bonum est tenete_. He had, of course, no sympathy with extravagances. His was a cultured, at any rate a refined taste, _sui similis_, and when it was said in April, 1886, that Niedermeyer's B minor Mass was \"elaborate,\" he observed: \"Well, I like a medium in music, although I may be wrong in that.\" All was well, we suppose, provided the best gifts of Catholic masters in their art were in good faith proffered to Almighty God. In the words herein of St. Gregory the Great: _Mihi placet ut, sive in Romanâ, sive in Galliarum, sive in quâlibet ecclesiâ, aliquid invenisti quod plus omnipotenti Deo possit placere, sollicite eligas._[62] All was well, too, if singers and players were animated with the Catholic spirit that breathed in a Haydn and a Mozart, to say nothing of later giants.[63] Under such conditions, and with due observance of the unaccompanied chant in Advent and Lent, the male choirs of both Oratories in England have probably done a good work, and if so, one worthy of St. Philip's blessing.  [Footnote 61: By the late Sir John Lambert, K.C.B., and published by Burns in 1849. Its Preface is well worthy of attention, and we note with pleasure his remark, \"that while pleading for the restoration of the Ritual Song as the Church system and the music of the people, and as the basis of all that is really grand and ecclesiastical, the writer would not wish to be understood to object to the superadding of the most elaborate music where it can be properly executed, if it does not supersede the Church Song, and is of a character to harmonize with it. Doubtless,\" he adds, \"as the Church employs all the resources of art, as far as in accordance with her own spirit, the most perfect celebration of the Divine Office would be where both could be combined. All would then be impressed and edified, each person according to his peculiar sense, and God would be worshipped with all the magnificence which art can be made to minister.\" (p. xiii.)]  [Footnote 62: S. Greg. Epist. xxxi. lib. xii. _De expos. divers. rerum._]  [Footnote 63: Thus M. Tonnellé, pupil of Father Gratry, of the Oratory: \"Haydn et Mozart, c'est la foi Catholique, c'est la soumission naïve et spontanée, c'est la devotion tendre et vive,\" which can, of course, be truly said without implying that they are always perfection.]  It was in April, 1886, that two of the Fathers, along with the writer, played over to Cardinal Newman, Dykes' well-known setting to \"Lead, kindly Light,\" which (he said) he had never heard before, and he seemed rather surprised at its very quiet, hymn-like quality.

In 1889 he had been very ill, and when recovering, said to a Father: \"Father Faber wrote the hymn 'Eternal Years.'[68] I have always had the greatest affection for it--quite a passionate affection for it--in connection with Father Faber, and I always used to think that when I came to die, I should like to have it sung to me; and I want you to play it for me.\" Would a harmonium do? \"Yes, a harmonium would be just the thing; perhaps one could be spared me.\"  [Footnote 64: There was nothing, however, so really \"magnificent,\" he said once (speaking of the wind instruments of brass and wood), as a military band.]  [Footnote 65: The following have set \"Lead, kindly Light\" to music: Canon J. Ballantine-Dykes, Rev. H. Earle Bulwer, Dr. G.A. Macfarren, Dr. S.S. Wesley, Dr. A.R. Gaul, Dr. C.J.B. Meacham, Sir A. Sullivan, J. Barnby, F. Tozer, C. Pinsuti, W. Hamilton, W.

Nicholson, J.W.R., and three anonymous composers. We may add that Mr. Rowton has musically essayed the _Dream of Gerontius_; \"J.W.R.,\" \"Warnings\" from the _Lyra Apostolica_; Dr. Macfarren a duet, \"O God, Who canst not change\" (breviary translation); \"R.S.,\" \"All is divine which the Highest has made;\" E.W., \"Softly and gently, dearly ransomed soul;\" the Rev. C.E. Butler, \"Praise to the Holiest;\" Maria Tiddeman, the same; Mr. Bellasis, the \"Haven,\" \"Consolation,\" \"Waiting for the Morning,\" \"The Two Worlds,\" \"The Watchman,\" and \"Heathen Greece;\" and an anonymous composer, \"The Pilgrim Queen,\" \"There sat a Lady,\" &c.]  [Footnote 66: From the _Lyra Apostolica_, and a striking little poem, as indeed are all the few signed [Greek: b], the music by a pupil of the Cardinal.]  [Footnote 67: _Verses on Various Occasions_, pp. 80, 319; the latter written in 1862, the music by a pupil, and according to the Father \"better than my words.\" The words also appear in the Birmingham book as a hymn (No. 67), entitled \"Sacrifice.\"]  [Footnote 68: Father Faber's _Poems_, No. 135, pp. 379-381, new edit. 1861. This is not in the London Oratory Hymn Book, but under the heading \"Eternity\" six of the quatrains (Nos. 1, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16) appear in the Birmingham book as No. 73, and are set to a tune in the minor from Beethoven's sixth trio (for flute, viola, and violoncello), taken _andante_.]  So, when evening had set in, a harmonium was put in the passage between his two rooms, a Father knelt at his side reciting each verse, while two others played and sang the \"Eternal Years.\"  [Music: BEETHOVEN.       How shalt thou bear the cross that now so dread a weight appears,      Keep quietly to God, and think upon th'eternal years.]  \"Some people,\" he then said, \"have liked my 'Lead, kindly Light,' and it is the voice of one in darkness asking for help from our Lord. But this (the 'Eternal Years') is quite different; this is one with full light, rejoicing in suffering with our Lord, so that mine compares unfavourably with it. This is what those who like 'Lead, kindly Light' have got to come to--they have to learn it.\" Then they played and sang it over again. And he said at the end, \"I thank you with all my heart. God bless you. I pray that when you go to Heaven, you may hear the angels singing with the genius that God has endowed them with. God bless you.\"  To quote as we began, and once again from Cardinal Capecelatro and Father Pope, and we have done. What His Eminence says of the first founder of any Oratorian Congregation may more or less apply to the great Oratorian whom we have mourned: \"The sweet enticement of music is quite in harmony with the spirit of St. Philip, and imparts to piety an ineffable gladness and gentleness and grace. Take away from our Saint his delight in music, and you leave his image in our hearts mutilated, despoiled of much of its winning beauty.\"[69]  [Footnote 69: Pope, _Capecelatro_, ii. 106.]     INDEX.   _Accentus_, 32.  _Adelphi_, 21.
