And there are hundreds of the enemy,\" protested Jim.  \"A necessary sacrifice,\" said Denny. \"And so perfect is their organization that no one, including the soldiers to be sacrificed, ever makes any objection.\"  Jim shivered a little. \"It's terrible, somehow. It's--it's inhuman!\"  \"Naturally. It's insectian, if there is such a word. And a wise man once predicted that the termite organization, being so much more perfect a one than man's, indicated the kind of society man would at some time build up for himself. In ten or twelve more centuries we, too, might go off in millions and deliberately starve to death because the ruling power decided there were too many people on earth. We, too, might devour our dead because it was essential not to let anything go to waste. We, too, might control our births so that we produced astronomers with telescopes in their heads instead of regular eyes, carpenters with hammer and saw instead of hands, soldiers with poison gas sacs in their chests so they could breathe death and destruction at will. It would be the perfect state of society.\"  \"Maybe--but I'm glad I'll be dead before that times comes,\" said Jim with another shiver.         *       *       *       *       *  By now the wall ahead of them was complete. On the other side of it the soldier termites stolidly fought on to their certain death. On the near side, the workers retreated to unknown depths in the great hollow mountain behind them. The main avenue was once more clear, and, save for a few workers hastening on unknown errands, deserted.  \"That act's over,\" sighed Dennis. \"But it may well be no more than a curtain raiser to the acts to come. Shall we be on our way? We're hardly on the fringe of the termitary yet--and I want to get at the heart of it, and into the depths far beneath it. Depths of hell, we'll probably find them, Jim. But a marvelous hell, and one no man has ever before seen.\"  They left their little haven and moved along the main tunnel toward the heart of the termitary, walking easily upright in this tunnel which was only one of many hundreds in the vast, hollowed mountain--which loomed into the outer sunshine to almost a height of a yard.     CHAPTER V  _Trapped_   On along the tunnel they went. And as they progressed, Dennis got the answer to something that had troubled him a great deal before their entrance here--a problem which had been solved, rather amazingly, of itself.  Termitaries, as far as the entomologist knew, were pitch-black places which no ray of light ever entered. He had been afraid he would be forced to stumble blindly in unlit depths, able to see nothing at all, on a par with the blind creatures among whom he moved. Yet he and Jim could see in this subterranean labyrinth.  He observed now the reason for that. The walls on all sides, made of half-digested cellulose, had rotted just enough through long years to be faintly phosphorescent. And that simple natural fact was probably going to mean all the difference between life and death: it gave the two men at least the advantage of sight over the eyeless savage creatures among whom, helped by the termite-smell given by the paste, they hoped to glide unnoticed.  However, even the termite-paste, and the fact that the termitary citizens were blind, didn't seem enough to account for the immunity granted the two men as they began to come presently to more crowded passages and tunnels near the center of the mound.  On every side of them now, requiring the utmost in agility to keep from actually brushing against them, were hordes of the worker termites, and dozens of the frightful soldiers. Yet on the two men moved, ever more slowly, without one of the monsters attempting to touch them. It was odd--almost uncanny.  \"Surely the noise of our walking, tiptoe as we may, must be heard by them--and noted as different from theirs,\" whispered Dennis. \"Yet they pay no attention to us. If it is due to the paste, I must say it's wonderful stuff!\"  Jim nodded in a puzzled way. \"It's almost as if they wanted to make our inward path easy. I wonder--if it's going to be different when we try to get out again!\"  Dennis was wondering that, too. It seemed absurd to suspect the things of being intelligent enough to lay traps. But it did look almost as though they were encouraging their two unheard-of visitors from another world to go on deeper and deeper into the heart of the eerie city (all the tunnels sloped down now), there perhaps to meet with some ghastly imprisonment.  He gave it up. Sufficient for the moment that they were unmolested, and that he had a chance at first hand to make observations more complete than the world of entomology had ever dreamed of.         *       *       *       *       *  They stumbled onto what seemed a death struggle between one of the giant soldiers and an inoffensive-looking worker. The drab, comparatively feeble body of the worker was wriggling right in the center of the great claws which, with a twitch, could have sliced it in two endwise. Yet the jaws did not twitch; and in a few moments the worker drew unconcernedly out and moved away.  \"The soldier was getting his meal,\" whispered Denny, enthralled. \"Their mandibles are enlarged so enormously that they can't feed themselves. The workers, who digest food for the whole tribe, feed them regularly. Then if a soldier gets in the least rebellious, he can simply be starved to death at any time.\"  \"Ugh!\" Jim whispered back. \"Fancy being official stomach to three or four other people! More of your wonderful 'organization,' I suppose.\"  They went on, down and down, till Denny calculated they had at last reached nearly to the center of the vast city. And now they stumbled into something weird and wonderful indeed. Rather, they half fell into it, for it lay down a few feet and came as a complete surprise in the dimness; and not till they had recovered from their near fall and looked around for a few seconds did they realize where their last few steps--the last few steps of freedom they were to have in the grim underground kingdom--had taken them.  They were in a chamber so huge that it made the largest of man-made domes shrink to insignificance by comparison.         *       *       *       *       *  A hundred yards or more in every direction, it extended. And far overhead, lost in distance, reared the arched roof. A twenty-story building could have been placed under that roof without trouble.  Lost in awe, Dennis gazed about him; and he saw on the floor, laid in orderly rows in countless thousands, that which gave further cause for wonderment: new-hatched larvae about the size of pumpkins but a sickly white in color--feeble, helpless blobs of life that one day develop into soldiers and workers, winged rulers or police. The termite nursery.  \"Whew!\" gasped Jim, wiping his face. \"From the heat in here you'd think we were getting close to the real, old-fashioned hell instead of an artificial, insect-made one. What are all these nauseating-looking blobs of lard lying about here, anyway?\"  Denny told him. \"Which is the reason for the heat,\" he concluded. \"Jim, it's twenty degrees warmer in here than it is outdoors. How--_how_--can these insects regulate the temperature like that? The work of the ruling brain again? But where, and what, can that brain be?\"  \"Maybe we'll find out before we leave this place,\" said Jim, more prophetically than he knew. \"Hello--we can't get out through the door we entered. We'll have to find another exit. Look.\"  Dennis looked. In the doorway they had just come through was a soldier--a giant even among giants. Its ten-foot jaws, like a questing, gigantic vise, were opening and closing regularly and rapidly across the opening of the portal. It made no attempt to enter the great nursery, just stood where it was and sliced the air rhythmically with its jaws.  \"We haven't a chance of walking through _that_ exit!\" Dennis agreed. \"Let's try the other side.\"         *       *       *       *       *  But before they could half cross the great room--walking between rows of life that weakly stirred like protoplasmic mud on either side of them--a soldier appeared at that door, too. Like the first, it stationed itself there, and began the same regular, swift slicing movements of jaws that compassed the doorway from side to side and halfway from top to bottom.  \"We might possibly be able to run through that giant's nut-cracker before it smashed shut on us,\" said Jim dubiously. \"But I'd hate to try it. There's a door at the end, too.\"  They made for this, running now. But a third soldier appeared to block the way out with those deadly, clashing mandibles.  \"You're _sure_ they can't see?\" demanded Jim, clutching his spear while he hesitated whether to try an attack on the fearful guard or to turn tail again. \"Because they certainly act as if they did!\"  \"Direct commands from the ruling brain,\" Denny surmised soberly. \"Somewhere, perhaps half a mile down in the earth, Something is able to see us through solid walls, read in our minds our intentions of what we're to do next, and send out wordless commands to these soldiers to execute countermoves.\"  \"Rot!\" said Jim testily. \"These things are bugs, not supermen. And the fact that they're now bigger than we are, and much better armed, doesn't keep them from being just bugs. There's no real brain-power in evidence here.\"  But an instant later he changed his mind. They approached the fourth and last exit from the giant chamber. And here there was no guard. They were able to race out of it without interference. The oddity of that was glaring.  \"Denny,\" gasped Jim, \"we're being _herded_! Driven in a certain direction, and for a certain reason, by these damned things! Do you realize that?\"  Dennis did realize it. And a moment later, when he glanced behind, he realized it more.         *       *       *       *       *  Behind them, marching in orderly twos that filled the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27248"],["title","The Raid on the Termites (#7)"],["body","from side to side, moved a body of the soldiers. As the men moved, they moved; never coming nearer and never dropping behind.  Experimentally, Dennis stopped. The grim soldiers stopped, too. Dennis walked back toward them a step or two, spear held ready.  The monsters did not try to attack. On the other hand they did not give ground, either; and as Denny got to within a few yards of them, one in the front line suddenly opened and shut his ponderous jaws.  They clashed together a matter of inches from Denny's torso--a clear warning to get on back in the direction he had come.  Jim came and stood beside him, heavy shoulder muscles bunched into knots, standing on the balls of his feet as a boxer stands before flashing in at an opponent.  \"Shall we have it out with them here and now?\" said Jim, his jaws set. \"We wouldn't have a chance--but I'm beginning to get awfully doubtful about the fate these things have in store for us. I can't even guess at what it may be--but I've an idea it may be a lot worse than a quick, easy death!\"  Denny shook his head. \"Let's see it through,\" he muttered, looking at the nightmare jaws of their guard. Two sweeps of those jaws and he and Jim would lie in halves.         *       *       *       *       *  They started back down the corridor, the monstrous shepherds moving as they did. The way descended so steeply now that it was difficult for them to keep their footing. Then, yards below the level of the horrible nursery, the tunnel narrowed--and widened again into a chamber which had no other opening save the one they were being herded into. A blind end to the passageway.  \"The bug Bastille,\" said Jim with a mirthless grin. \"Here, I guess, we're going to wait for the powers-that-be to judge us and give us our sentence.\"  The giant soldiers halted. Two of them stood in the narrowed part of the tunnel, one behind the other, blocking it with a double, living barrier. Their jaws commenced moving regularly, savagely back and forth, open and closed. Blind these guards might be; but no living thing, even though it bristled with eyes, could creep out unscathed through the animated threshing machine those jaws made of that doorway. The two men were more securely held in their prison cell than they would have been by two-inch doors of nickel-steel. They could only wait there, helpless prisoners, to learn the intentions of the unknown Something that ruled the great city, and that held them so easily in its grasp.     CHAPTER VI  _In the Food Room_   Restlessly, Jim paced back and forth in the narrow dank cell. At the doorway the two guards opened and closed their jaws, regularly, rhythmically, about sixty to the minute. Hours, the two men calculated, they had been there. And still the clashing of those jaws rang steadily, maddeningly in their ears.  Clash-clash-clash. The things seemed as tireless as machinery. Clash-clash-clash. And into that savage, tireless movement, Denny read a sort of longing refrain.  \"Try--to--es--cape! Try--to--es--cape!\"  He shivered. At any time, did he and Jim grow too fearful of the dark future or too nerve-wracked by the terrific suspense, they could step into these gigantic, steel-hard jaws. But to be sliced in two ...  Jim stopped his pacing, and stared speculatively at the wall of their cell. For the dozenth time he raised his ponderous spear and thrust the pointed end at the wall with all his strength. And for the dozenth time he was rewarded only by seeing a flake no larger than his clenched fist fall out.  \"Might as well be cement!\" he rasped. \"God, we're caught like flies in a spiderweb!\"  \"Well, you wanted excitement,\" remarked Dennis, a bit acidly. The strain was telling on him more than on the less finely strung Holden; but he was struggling to keep himself in hand.  \"So I did want excitement,\" said Jim. \"But I want at least a sporting chance for my white-alley, too. But--\"  He stopped; and both stared swiftly toward the door.         *       *       *       *       *  The ponderous, gruesome clashing of jaws had stopped. The two nightmare guards stood motionless, as though at command. Then they moved into the cell, straight toward the two men.  \"It's come!\" said Jim through set teeth. He swung his spear up, ready to shoot it at the horny breastplate of the nearest monster with all his puny strength. \"We're going to catch it now!\"  But Dennis gazed more intently; and he saw that the blind but ferocious creatures showed no real signs of molesting them. Instead, they were edging to one side. In a moment, as the two men moved warily to keep their distance, they found suddenly that the soldiers were behind them, and that the doorway was free to them.  The glimpse of freedom, however, was not inspiring. The meaning of the move was too apparent: they were again being herded.  Whatever reigning power it was that had let them penetrate so deeply into the trap, and then had surrounded and imprisoned them--was now going to honor them with an audience.  \"His Majesty commands,\" commented Jim, reading the sinister gesture as clearly as Denny had. \"I'll wager we're about to meet your 'unknown intelligence,' Denny. But be it 'super-termite' or be it Queen--whatever it may be--I want just one chance to use this spear of mine!\"  Reluctantly he stepped forth before the fearful guard; reluctantly, but in full command of his nerves now that the wearing inactivity was ended and something definite was about to happen. Which proves but once again the wisdom of the gods in not allowing man to read the future. For could Jim Holden have foreseen the precise experience awaiting them, his nerve control--and Denny's, too--might not have been so firm.         *       *       *       *       *  Again their way led sharply down, through tunnels loftier and broader and glowing more brilliantly with phosphorescence which was a testimonial to their greater age.  The efficiency of their herding was perfect. At each side entrance along the way stood one of the ghastly soldiers, jaws clashing with monotonous deadliness. Now and again several of the monsters appeared straight ahead, barring the avenue, and leaving no choice but to turn to right or left into off-branching tunnels. Small chance here of missing the path! And always behind them marched their two particular guards, closing off their retreat.  \"How do you suppose they sense our approach?\" wondered Jim, who had noticed that the menacing jaw-clashing began while they were still fairly far from whatever side entrance was being barred to them. And again: \"You're _sure_ they can't see?\"  \"There isn't an eye in the lot of them,\" said Denny. \"They must sense our coming by the vibration of our footsteps.\"  But when they tried tiptoeing, on noiseless bare feet, the result was the same. Surely the things could not hear them for more than a few feet; yet with no sound to guide them, the blind guards commenced automatically opening and closing those invulnerable jaws with the distant approach of the two men just the same. They could only ascribe it to the same force that seemed able to follow them, step by step and thought by thought, though it was far away and out of sight--the ruling brain of the termite tribe.         *       *       *       *       *  Ever hotter it grew as they descended, till at length a blast of heat like a draft from a furnace met them as they rounded a corner and stepped into a corridor that no longer led downward. They knew that they were very near the ruler's lair now, on the lowest level, deep in the foundations of the vast pile.  Dennis wiped perspiration, caused as much by emotion as by heat, from his face. He alone of all students on earth was going to penetrate the very heart of the termite mystery. He alone was going to have at least a glimpse of the baffling intelligence that science had guessed about for so many decades He ... alone. For it was hardly likely that he would ever get back up to the surface of earth to share his knowledge.  How different was this adventure from what he had hoped it might be! He had thought that the two of them might simply enter the termitary, mingle--perilously, but with at least a margin of safety--with the blind race it housed, and walk out again whenever they pleased. But from the moment of entering they'd had no chance. They had been hopelessly in the clutch of the insects; played with, indulged, and finally trapped, to be led at last like dogs on a leash to the lair of the ruling power.  They rounded another corner and now, ahead of them, they saw what must be the end of this last and deepest of all the tunnels. This end showed as a glare of light. Real light, not the soft gleam of the rotting wood walls which was already paling feebly in comparison. The glare ahead of them, indeed, had something of the texture of electric light. Neither Jim nor Dennis could repress a sudden start; it was like coming abruptly onto a man-made fact, a bit of man-made world in the midst of this insect hell.  The damp heat was almost paralyzing now. Their limbs felt weak as they stumbled toward the light. But they were inexorably herded forward, and soon were at the threshold of the oddly illuminated chamber.  Now the two stopped for an instant and sniffed, as a peculiar odor came to their nostrils. It was a vague but fearsome odor, indescribable, making their skin crawl. A smell of decay--of death--and yet somehow of rank and fetid life. A combination of charnel-house and menagerie smell.         *       *       *       *       *  Denny blanched as an inkling of what was before them came to his mind. He remembered the swooping wasp, that had so narrowly missed them at the start of their adventure. The wasp, he knew, was not the only insect that had certain dread ways of stocking its larder and keeping the contents of that larder fresh! The termites did not customarily follow these practises. Yet--yet the odor coming from the place before them certainly suggested ... But he tried to"]]]
