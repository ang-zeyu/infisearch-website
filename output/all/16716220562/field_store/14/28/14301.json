R. M. Algie, Chairman)   _Laid on the Table of the House of Representatives_   BY AUTHORITY: R. E. OWEN, GOVERNMENT PRINTER, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND.--1955     REPORT   By a resolution of the House dated the 28th day of September 1954 a Special Select Committee was appointed to consider and to report upon certain matters relating to moral delinquency. In particular, the Committee was instructed to study the recommendations contained in the report of the Mazengarb Committee and to make such observations thereon as it thought fit. This Special Select Committee was empowered to sit during recess and was directed to report its findings to the House within twenty-eight days after the commencement of the next ensuing session of Parliament.  The Orders of Reference relating to the Committee were as follows:      ORDERS OF REFERENCE      _Extracts from the Journals of the House of Representatives_      TUESDAY, THE 28TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1954      _Ordered_, \"That a Select Committee be appointed, consisting of ten     Members, to consider the Report of the Special Committee on Moral     Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (H-47, 1954); the Committee     to make such recommendations or observations as it thinks fit to     the House or the Government; the Committee to have power to sit     during the recess and for twenty-eight days after the commencement     of the next ensuing session; the Committee to consist of six     Members to be nominated by the Prime Minister and four Members to     be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, such names to be     submitted to the Clerk of the House on or before 31 December 1954.     (Right Hon. Mr HOLLAND.)\"      The names submitted in accordance with the above Order of Reference     were: Mr Aderman, the Hon. Mr Algie, Mr Barnes, the Hon. Mr Hanan,     Mrs McMillan, the Hon. Mr Mason, Mr D. M. Rae, the Hon. Mrs Ross,     Mr Skoglund, and the Hon. Mr Tirikatene.       WEDNESDAY, THE 20TH DAY OF APRIL 1955      _Ordered_, \"That the period set down by Order of the House dated 28     September 1954 within which the Juvenile Delinquency Committee was     required to present its report be extended to 1 September 1955.\"     (Hon. Mr ALGIE.)       WEDNESDAY, THE 31ST DAY OF AUGUST 1955      _Ordered_, \"That the period set down by Order of the House dated 20     April 1955 within which the Juvenile Delinquency Committee was     required to present its report be extended to 1 October 1955.\"     (Hon. Mr ALGIE.)  The Committee met on two days during the recess and on a number of occasions during the 1955 session.  For many reasons which need not be set out in this report, but which were communicated to Parliament, it was found impossible to present a report within the limits of time allowed, and by resolution of the House it was finally agreed that the report should be presented on or before the 1st day of October 1955.  We have given careful attention to each and every one of the recommendations of the Mazengarb Committee. We have not felt it to be our duty to hear over again all or any of the evidence placed before that Committee, nor have we regarded it as our duty to deal broadly with the incidence and causes of moral delinquency, or with the discovery and presentation of remedies for this social malady. On the contrary, we felt that we were required:      (1) To study the legislation relating to this subject and enacted     by Parliament in 1954, to consider its efficacy, and, if possible,     to make recommendations for its improvement, and      (2) To consider the suggestions made by the Mazengarb Committee for     action by particular Government Departments, to give an opinion as     to how far such recommendations could be given practical effect,     and to set out for the information of Parliament the extent to     which those recommendations had been put into operation.  Our views, suggestions, and recommendations are as follows:   The Need for Continuous Expert Investigation  In the course of our study of this problem it was frequently pointed out to us that there was a real need for a thorough and continuous study of this problem by those who from their training, experience, and occupation were best qualified to advise as to the scope and extent of the problem, as to its general causes, and as to the practical ways of dealing with it. From information in the possession of the police and of the Department of Justice it appeared that the extent of the evil was in fact not so alarming as one might be induced to believe by a perusal of the reports in the newspapers; there was, however, plenty of evidence to suggest that misconduct amongst adolescents was increasing and that this aspect of the matter was one for grave concern. There was support for these views in written memoranda submitted by two of our Magistrates, Mr Sinclair and Mr M. C. Astley. The Secretary for Justice and Controller-General of Prisons, Mr S. T. Barnett, wrote as follows:      \"My suggestion is that, as a first step, the Ministers in charge of     social Departments, e.g., Education, Child Welfare, Justice,     Police, should be requested to direct their Permanent Heads to     concert together and get down to a group study of the problem and     report to Government on the practical measures to meet it.      \"Within these Departments are experts who can get down to the facts     and who ought to be able to propound some suggestions to ameliorate     the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. They should, of     course, be authorized, and indeed requested, to enlarge the     departmental group and to take in representatives of principal     welfare organizations.\"  The suggestions made by Mr Barnett were adopted, and the work recommended by him is being carried on. The results have not yet been made available to us.  We think that in matters of this kind fact finding carried out by experts in a thoroughly scientific manner is fundamental, and in a later portion of this report we have a specific recommendation to make on this subject.   Specific Recommendations of Mazengarb Committee Relative to Child Welfare Administration  In paragraph (4) of the report of the Mazengarb Committee--pages 57 to 60 inclusive--there are a number of comments and suggestions relating to the Child Welfare Act and its administration. We have examined these paragraphs very carefully, and we set out below some excerpts from the report furnished to us by the Director of Education. Our views are given immediately following the extract from the opinion expressed by Dr Beeby, which is as follows:      \"We have always felt that the spirit of the Child Welfare Act 1925     placed an obligation on us to do preventive work, and there are two     Cabinet decisions, one going back to 1941, which certainly give the     authority. However, we agree that it might be desirable to have the     obligation expressed explicitly in the Act. Indeed, in the draft     Child Welfare Bill prepared by the Division some eighteen months     ago you will find this done in two ways:          \"(1) On page 43 of the draft Bill I sent you you will find Part         I devoted to preventive work, and clause 1 begins, 'It shall be         the _duty_ of the Superintendent to take positive action to         prevent children, etc.'.          \"(2) On page 1 the definition of 'Child in need of care and         protection' is so widened as to cover every possible type of         preventive case, if read in conjunction with the amendments         passed during last session and with the Cabinet authorities to         spend public funds on such children.      \"We do not think it necessary to increase the powers of Child     Welfare Officers for these purposes. To give them more actual     powers over children who have not committed an offence would be to     risk justifiable public objection to interference with the liberty     of the subject and the rights of parents.\"   _Page 58, paragraph (b)_  In its report the Mazengarb Committee said that the establishment a few years ago of a Ministry of Social Welfare, and the urgent need for more preventive work to be done, suggest the possibility of better administration if \"child welfare\" were given an independent status under the Ministry for Social Welfare.  This suggestion was examined by the Director of Education and by the Superintendent of the Child Welfare Division of the Department of Education. They reported fully to us, and their views are set out below in summarized form.  The strongest arguments that were placed before us in support of the view that child welfare should be a separate and independent Department were to the following effect:      (1) The Superintendent would--as the head of his own Department--be     the captain of his own ship subject only to the direction of his     own Minister.      (2) The Director of Education has a huge Department of his own to     administer, and he cannot be expected to give to child welfare the     full measure of attention it should have.      (3) The Minister of Education must in the main find his principal     and absorbing interest in the school system, and he could hardly     devote to child welfare the same degree of attention that could be     expected from the Minister of Social Welfare.      (4) There would be times when the Superintendent must find it     burdensome to have to work through a Department with far-reaching     special interests of its own.      (5) The public standing and prestige of the Superintendent of Child     Welfare would be enhanced if he were recognized as the head of his     own independent Department.  The arguments on the other side may be summarized in the following way:      (1) Child welfare by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#1)"],["body","would make a relatively small     Department and as such it might tend to become inbred and to     stagnate.      (2) A separate Department of Child Welfare would cost more than at     present because it would not be able to rely upon some of the     staffing and administrative facilities of the Department of     Education.      (3) Some of the institutions now conducted or controlled by child     welfare are really schools and as such they would always need to be     under the real control of the Department of Education.      (4) In actual practice no one could define with precision where the     functions of child welfare could be separated from those of     education.      (5) Over the years child welfare and education have worked out     their own joint policy of administration. They have in fact worked     along in harmony and with effective co-operation, and there     appeared to be no sound reason for disturbing a set-up which was in     fact efficient, economical, and harmonious.  We were completely satisfied that the present arrangement has the full support of the Director of Education and the Superintendent of Child Welfare. This view has also the support of the Public Service Commission. After a study of the evidence that was placed before us we came to the unanimous conclusion that matters should be left as they are.  If it was decided by Government that child welfare should remain linked with the Department of Education it would be advisable that some form of administrative procedure should be worked out to define the relations between the Director of Education and the Superintendent of Child Welfare in so far as their respective approaches to the Minister of Education and the Minister of Social Welfare are concerned. It was clear to us that the present set-up is both efficient and harmonious. A detailed plan for the due performance of the various duties was worked out and agreed to by all interested parties. As it is a purely administrative matter, we have not felt that it was necessary to embody it in this report. Suffice it to say that in our opinion child welfare should remain a part of the Department of Education, that its Superintendent should have a right of direct reference to the Minister of Social Welfare, that the Minister of Social Welfare should be directly responsible for the administration of the vote applicable to the Child Welfare Division, and that the administrative plan placed before us should be adopted and applied unless and until varied by agreement between the Ministers concerned.   _Page 59, paragraph (c)_  Dr Beeby said:      \"It is true that no regulations have ever been gazetted prescribing     the duties of Child Welfare Officers. The provisions for them under     the Act are merely permissive, and we think it would be a     retrograde step to gazette any. The duties of the Superintendent     are adequately defined in the Act, and, as in other parts of the     Public Service, he delegates such of those powers as he thinks fit     to his subordinates. The Division's work has been done on this     basis since the passing of the Act, and we can recall no incident     where the absence of regulations has caused any difficulty. To     define the powers might well be to restrict them and to interfere     with the very preventive work we all desire.      \"There should, as the Committee suggests, be some mention of     Honorary Child Welfare Officers in the Act, but their powers,     again, are better given by delegation than by legislation. It is     very desirable that the extent to which use is made of an Honorary     Officer's services be allowed to vary with the requirements of the     district and the ability of the officer.\"  We agree with the views expressed above by Dr Beeby.   _Page 59, paragraph (d)_  The Mazengarb Committee pointed out that the practice and procedure of the Children's Court may tend to vary from place to place throughout the Dominion because the Court was not presided over by its own specially appointed Magistrate.  On this point the Director of Education said:      \"This comment is true. The position has arisen because of the     practical difficulties of having the work carried out by specially     appointed Magistrates. The volume of work involved could justify     the appointment of only a few such Magistrates, and, because of the     geographical spread of the work, they could not handle it     expeditiously.\"  On this point we have no recommendations to make. We feel that the best possible results are being secured by the Magistrates having regard to their numbers and to the conditions under which they work.   _Page 59, paragraph (e)_  The Mazengarb Committee felt that it was a pity that proceedings in the Children's Court were not conducted in a separate and distinct building. It should at least be possible, said the report, to hear and determine the cases in a room other than the ordinary Court room of a Magistrate's Court. This was rather in the nature of a counsel of perfection. In less-densely populated districts it would not be easy or economic to provide separate accommodation of the kind envisaged. In larger and busier centres it was often necessary to study the convenience of the Magistrates themselves. The present Committee has no specific recommendation to make in this connection.  The best that can be done is in fact being done.   _Page 60, paragraph (f)_  On the subject of the publicity to be given to proceedings in the Children's Court the Mazengarb Committee said:      \"There may be reasons why a Children's Court should be open to the     public ... The public has a right to know how child offenders have     been dealt with. The Committee does not recommend any alteration in     the provision prohibiting the publication of the name of any child,     or of any name or particulars likely to lead to identification.     Subject to this, it is desirable that reporters should be allowed     to attend.\"  With these views we find ourselves to be in complete agreement.   _Page 60, paragraph (g)_  The Mazengarb Committee appeared to hold the view that when children have been placed under supervision there was no adequate \"follow up\" procedure.  The following is Dr Beeby's comment upon this paragraph:      \"It is a little difficult to see just what the Committee are     suggesting in this paragraph. If they are proposing that a Child     Welfare Officer be required to report progress to a Magistrate for     his personal information and to enable him to check on the     correctness of his judgment, there can be no possible objection.     When asked for, indeed, this is already done. If, on the other     hand, it is proposed that the Magistrate have continuing authority     over the child, then it would turn the Court into a social work     agency and would run counter to the whole trend in the development     of Children's Court and child welfare work from the beginning of     this century. The Magistrate would be compelled to take on     responsibilities for which he is not trained, and Child Welfare     Officers would tend to become merely junior probation officers     attached to the Court. One of the advantages of the present system     is that the Superintendent, being the final authority, can ensure     uniform standards of case work throughout New Zealand. If it were     left to each individual Magistrate to decide exactly what should be     done with children, it is certain that wide variations in     principles and procedures would occur. Experience has shown, for     example, that some Magistrates, with no first-hand knowledge of our     institutions, would send to them children for whom they are not     established to cater.      \"With regard to the Committee's suggestion that there 'should be     some person or body apart from the departmental officers to whom a     child could turn for help ...', we would agree that something like     the Visiting Justice system of the Justice Department might apply     to our institutions as a guarantee to the public and as a     protection to both children and officers. However, to extend such a     system to children boarded out in private homes would be to ask for     endless trouble. People would be loath to accept State wards into     their homes if it laid them open to official visits from laymen     whose sole function was to hear complaints from the children. The     visits of Child Welfare Officers and of Inspectors of the Division     must, we feel, be accepted as the main guarantee to the public of     fair treatment.\"  Without expressing any decided opinion, the Committee felt that what the Director of Education has to say is worthy of consideration by Government.   Certain Specific Changes Proposed by the Mazengarb Committee  In clause (5) on pages 60 to 63, both inclusive, of the report the Mazengarb Committee recommended that certain specific changes be made as soon as possible in the legislation relating to proceedings in the Children's Court. It was our duty to examine and report upon each of these suggestions. Our comments are as follow:      _Paragraph (a), page 61_ (creation of a new offence) and _paragraph     (b), page 61_ (the compulsory attendance of parents at a Children's     Court)  Both of these recommendations have been given effect to, and they are provided for in the legislation enacted late in the session of 1954.       _Paragraph (c). page 61_ (power of Court to make orders against the     parents of offending or delinquent children)  We agree with this recommendation, and we understand that the necessary provision has already been written into a new Child Welfare Bill which is in course of preparation.       _Paragraph (d), page 62_ (notification of fact of expulsion of a     child from school)  This proposal has already been given effect to by administrative direction. We feel that legislation on this point will not be necessary.       _Paragraph (e),"]]]
