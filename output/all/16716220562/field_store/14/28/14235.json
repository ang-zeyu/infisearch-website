An' y' all comin' here with guns, like you huntin' squ'rr'ls, an' now talkin' 'bout wadin' in the ditch!\"  \"But, Unc' Balla, that's the way all buccaneers do,\" protested Frank.  \"Yes, buccaneers always go by water,\" said Willy.  \"And we can stoop in the ditch and come in at the far end of the garden, so nobody can see us,\" added Frank.  \"Bookanear or bookafar,--I's gwine in dat garden and dig a hole wid my hoe, an' I is too ole to be wadin' in a ditch like chillern. I got the misery in my knee now, so bad I'se sca'cely able to stand. I don't know huccome y' all ain't satisfied with the place you' ma an' I done pick, anyways.\"  This was too serious a mutiny for the boys. So it was finally greed that one gun should be returned to the office, and that they should enter by the gate, after which Balla was to go with the boys by the way they should show him, and see the spot they thought of.  They took him down through the weeds around the garden, crouching under the rose-bushes, and at last stopped at a spot under the slope, completely surrounded by shrubbery.  \"Here is the spot,\" said Frank in a whisper, pointing under one of the bushes.  \"It's in a line with the longest limb of the big oak-tree by the gate,\" added Willy, \"and when this locust bush and that cedar grow to be big trees, it will be just half-way between them.\"  As this seemed to Balla a very good place, he set to work at once to dig, the two boys helping him as well as they could. It took a great deal longer to dig the hole in the dark than they had expected, and when they got back to the house everything was quiet.  The boys had their hats pulled over their eyes, and had turned their jackets inside out to disguise themselves.  \"It's a first-rate place! Ain't it, Unc' Balla?\" they said, as they entered the chamber where their mother and aunt were waiting for them.  \"Do you think it will do, Balla?\" their mother asked.  \"Oh, yes, madam; it's far enough, an' they got mighty comical ways to get dyah, wadin' in ditch an' things--it will do. I ain' sho' I kin fin' it ag'in myself.\" He was not particularly enthusiastic. Now, however, he shouldered the box, with a grunt at its weight, and the party went slowly out through the back door into the dark. The glow of the burning depot was still visible in the west.  Then it was decided that Willy should go before--he said to \"reconnoitre,\" Balla said \"to open the gate and lead the way,\"--and that Frank should bring up the rear.  They trudged slowly on through the darkness, Frank and Willy watching on every side, old Balla stooping under the weight of the big box.  After they were some distance in the garden they heard, or thought they heard, a sound back at the gate, but decided that it was nothing but the latch clicking; and they went on down to their hiding place.  In a little while the black box was well settled in the hole, and the dirt was thrown upon it. The replaced earth made something of a mound, which was unfortunate. They had not thought of this; but they covered it with leaves, and agreed that it was so well hidden, the Yankees would never dream of looking there.  \"Unc' Balla, where are your horses?\" asked one of the boys.  \"That's for me to know, an' them to find out what kin,\" replied the old fellow with a chuckle of satisfaction.  The whole party crept back out of the garden, and the boys were soon dreaming of buccaneers and pirates.     CHAPTER IX.   The boys were not sure that they had even fallen asleep when they heard Lucy Ann call, outside. They turned over to take another nap. She was coming up to the door. No, for it was a man's step, it must be Uncle Balla's; they heard horses trampling and people talking. In a second the door was flung open, and a man strode into the room, followed by one, two, a half-dozen others, all white and all in uniform. They were Yankees. The boys were too frightened to speak. They thought they were arrested for hiding the silver.  \"Get up, you lazy little rebels,\" cried one of the intruders, not unpleasantly. As the boys were not very quick in obeying, being really too frightened to do more than sit up in bed, the man caught the mattress by the end, and lifting it with a jerk emptied them and all the bedclothes out into the middle of the floor in a heap. At this all the other men laughed. A minute more and he had drawn his sword. The boys expected no less than to be immediately killed. They were almost paralyzed. But instead of plunging his sword into them, the man began to stick it into the mattresses and to rip them up; while others pulled open the drawers of the bureau and pitched the things on the floor.  The boys felt themselves to be in a very exposed and defenceless condition; and Willy, who had become tangled in the bedclothes, and had been a little hurt in falling, now that the strain was somewhat over, began to cry.  In a minute a shadow darkened the doorway and their mother stood in the room.  \"Leave the room instantly!\" she cried. \"Aren't you ashamed to frighten children!\"  \"We haven't hurt the brats,\" said the man with the sword good-naturedly.  \"Well, you terrify them to death. It's just as bad. Give me those clothes!\" and she sprang forward and snatched the boys' clothes from the hands of a man who had taken them up. She flung the suits to the boys, who lost no time in slipping into them.  They had at once recovered their courage in the presence of their mother. She seemed to them, as she braved the intruders, the grandest person they had ever seen. Her face was white, but her eyes were like coals of fire. They were very glad she had never looked or talked so to them.  When they got outdoors the yard was full of soldiers. They were upon the porches, in the entry, and in the house. The smoke-house was open and so were the doors of all the other outhouses, and now and then a man passed, carrying some article which the boys recognized.  In a little while the soldiers had taken everything they could carry conveniently, and even things which must have caused them some inconvenience. They had secured all the bacon that had been left in the smoke-house, as well as all other eatables they could find. It was a queer sight, to see the fellows sitting on their horses with a ham or a pair of fowls tied to one side of the saddle and an engraving or a package of books, or some ornament, to the other.  A new party of men had by this time come up from the direction of the stables.  \"Old man, come here!\" called some of them to Balla, who was standing near expostulating with the men who were about the fire.  \"Who?--me?\" asked Balla.  \"B'ain't you the carriage driver?\"  \"Ain't I the keridge driver?\"  \"Yes, _you_; we know you are, so you need not be lying about it.\"  \"Hi! yes; I the keridge driver. Who say I ain't?\"  \"Well, where have you hid those horses? Come, we want to know, quick,\" said the fellow roughly, taking out his pistol in a threatening way.  The old man's eyes grew wide. \"Hi! befo' de Lord! Marster, how I know anything of the horses ef they ain't in the stable,--there's where we keep horses!\"  \"Here, you come with us. We won't have no foolin' 'bout this,\" said his questioner, seizing him by the shoulder and jerking him angrily around. \"If you don't show us pretty quick where those horses are, we'll put a bullet or two into you. March off there!\"  He was backed by a half-a-dozen more, but the pistol, which was at old Balla's head, was his most efficient ally.  \"Hi! Marster, don't pint dat thing at me that way. I ain't ready to die yit--an' I ain' like dem things, no-ways,\" protested Balla.  There is no telling how much further his courage could have withstood their threats, for the boys' mother made her appearance. She was about to bid Balla show where the horses were, when a party rode into the yard leading them.  \"Hi! there are Bill and John, now,\" exclaimed the boys, recognizing the black carriage-horses which were being led along.  \"Well, ef dee ain't got 'em, sho' 'nough!\" exclaimed the old driver, forgetting his fear of the cocked pistols.  \"Gentlemen, marsters, don't teck my horses, ef you _please_,\" he pleaded, pushing through the group that surrounded him, and approaching the man who led the horses.  They only laughed at him.  [Illustration: \"GENTLEMEN, MARSTERS, DON'T TECK MY HORSES, EF YOU PLEASE,\" SAID UNCLE BALLA.]  Both the boys ran to their mother, and flinging their arms about her, burst out crying.  In a few minutes the men started off, riding across the fields; and in a little while not a soldier was in sight.  \"I wish Marse William could see you ridin' 'cross them fields,\" said Balla, looking after the retiring troop in futile indignation.  Investigation revealed the fact that every horse and mule on the plantation had been carried off, except only two or three old mules, which were evidently considered not worth taking.     CHAPTER X.   After this, times were very hard on the plantation. But the boys' mother struggled to provide as best she could for the family and hands. She used to ride all over the county to secure the supplies which were necessary for their support; one of the boys usually being her escort and riding behind her on one of the old mules that the raiders had left. In this way the boys became acquainted with the roads of the county and even with all the bridle-paths in the neighborhood of their home. Many of these were dim enough too, running through stretches of pine forest, across old fields which were little better than jungle, along gullies, up ditches, and through woods mile after mile. They were generally useful only to a race, such as the negroes, which had an instinct for direction like that shown by some animals but the boys learned to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26725"],["title","Two Little Confederates (#8)"],["body","them unerringly, and soon became as skilful in \"keepin' de parf\" as any night-walker on the plantation.  As the year passed the times grew harder and harder, and the expeditions made by the boys' mother became longer and longer, and more and more frequent.  The meat gave out, and, worst of all, they had no hogs left for next year. The plantation usually subsisted on bacon; but now there was not a pig left on the place--unless the old wild sow in the big woods (who had refused to be \"driven up\" the fall before) still survived, which was doubtful; for the most diligent search was made for her without success, and it was conceded that even she had fallen prey to the deserters. Nothing was heard of her for months.  One day, in the autumn, the boys were out hunting in the big woods, in the most distant and wildest part, where they sloped down toward a little marshy branch that ran into the river a mile or two away.  It was a very dry spell and squirrels were hard to find, owing, the boys agreed, to the noise made in tramping through the dry leaves. Finally, they decided to station themselves each at the foot of a hickory and wait for the squirrels. They found two large hickory trees not too far apart, and took their positions each on the ground, with his back to a tree.  It was very dull, waiting, and a half-whispered colloquy was passing between them as to the advisability of giving it up, when a faint \"cranch, cranch, cranch,\" sounded in the dry leaves. At first the boys thought it was a squirrel, and both of them grasped their guns. Then the sound came again, but this time there appeared to be, not one, but a number of animals, rustling slowly along.  \"What is it?\" asked Frank of Willy, whose tree was a little nearer the direction from which the sound came.  \"'Tain't anything but some cows or sheep, I believe,\" said Willy, in a disappointed tone. The look of interest died out of Frank's face, but he still kept his eyes in the direction of the sound, which was now very distinct. The underbrush, however, was too thick for them to see anything. At length Willy rose and pushed his way rapidly through the bushes toward the animals. There was a sudden \"oof, oof,\" and Frank heard them rushing back down through the woods toward the marsh.  \"Somebody's hogs,\" he muttered, in disgust.  \"Frank! Frank!\" called Willy, in a most excited tone.  \"What?\"  \"It's the old spotted sow, and she's got a lot of pigs with her--great big shoats, nearly grown!\"  Frank sprang up and ran through the bushes.  \"At least six of 'em!\"  \"Let's follow 'em!\"  \"All right.\"  The boys, stooping their heads, struck out through the bushes in the direction from which the yet retreating animals could still be heard.  \"Let's shoot 'em.\"  \"All right.\"  On they kept as hard as they could. What great news it was! What royal game!  \"It's like hunting wild boars, isn't it?\" shouted Willy, joyfully.  They followed the track left by the animals in the leaves kicked up in their mad flight. It led down over the hill, through the thicket, and came to an end at the marsh which marked the beginning of the swamp. Beyond that it could not be traced; but it was evident that the wild hogs had taken refuge in the impenetrable recesses of the marsh which was their home.     CHAPTER XI.   After circling the edge of the swamp for some time the boys, as it was now growing late, turned toward home. They were full of their valuable discovery, and laid all sorts of plans for the capture of the hogs. They would not tell even their mother, as they wished to surprise her. They were, of course, familiar with all the modes of trapping game, as described in the story books, and they discussed them all. The easiest way to get the hogs was to shoot them, and this would be the most \"fun\"; but it would never do, for the meat would spoil. When they reached home they hunted up Uncle Balla and told him about their discovery. He was very much inclined to laugh at them. The hogs they had seen were nothing, he told them, but some of the neighbors' hogs which had wandered into the woods.  When the boys went to bed they talked it over once more, and determined that next day they would thoroughly explore the woods and the swamp also, as far as they could.  The following afternoon, therefore, they set out, and made immediately for that part of the woods where they had seen and heard the hogs the day before. One of them carried a gun and the other a long jumping-pole. After finding the trail they followed it straight down to the swamp.  Rolling their trousers up above their knees, they waded boldly in, selecting an opening between the bushes which looked like a hog-path. They proceeded slowly, for the briers were so thick in many places that they could hardly make any progress at all when they neared the branch. So they turned and worked their way painfully down the stream. At last, however, they reached a place where the brambles and bushes seemed to form a perfect wall before them. It was impossible to get through.  \"Let's go home,\" said Willy. \"'Tain't any use to try to get through there. My legs are scratched all to pieces now.\"  \"Let's try and get out here,\" said Frank, and he turned from the wall of brambles. They crept along, springing from hummock to hummock. Presently they came to a spot where the oozy mud extended at least eight or ten feet before the next tuft of grass.  \"How am I to get the gun across?\" asked Willy, dolefully.  \"That's a fact! It's too far to throw it, even with the caps off.\"  At length they concluded to go back for a piece of log they had seen, and to throw this down so as to lessen the distance.  They pulled the log out of the sand, carried it to the muddy spot, and threw it into the mud where they wanted it.  Frank stuck his pole down and felt until he had what he thought a secure hold on it, fixed his eye on the tuft of grass beyond, and sprang into air.  As he jumped the pole slipped from its insecure support into the miry mud, and Frank, instead of landing on the hummock for which he had aimed, lost his direction, and soused flat on his side with a loud \"spa-lash,\" in the water and mud three feet to the left.  He was a queer object as he staggered to his feet in the quagmire; but at the instant a loud \"oof, oof,\" came from, the thicket, not a dozen yards away, and the whole herd of hogs, roused, by his fall, from slumber in their muddy lair, dashed away through the swamp with \"oofs\" of fear.  \"There they go, there they go!\" shouted both boys, eagerly,--Willy, in his excitement, splashing across the perilous-looking quagmire, and finding it not so deep as it had looked.  \"There's where they go in and out,\" exclaimed Frank, pointing to a low round opening, not more than eighteen inches high, a little further beyond them, which formed an arch in the almost solid wall of brambles surrounding the place.  As it was now late they returned home, resolving to wait until the next afternoon before taking any further steps. There was not a pound of bacon to be obtained anywhere in the country for love or money, and the flock of sheep was almost gone.  Their mother's anxiety as to means for keeping her dependents from starving was so great that the boys were on the point of telling her what they knew; and when they heard her wishing she had a few hogs to fatten, they could scarcely keep from letting her know their plans. At last they had to jump up, and run out of the room.  Next day the boys each hunted up a pair of old boots which they had used the winter before. The leather was so dry and worn that the boots hurt their growing feet cruelly, but they brought the boots along to put on when they reached the swamp. This time, each took a gun, and they also carried an axe, for now they had determined on a plan for capturing the hogs.  \"I wish we had let Peter and Cole come,\" said Willy, dolefully, sitting on the butt end of a log they had cut, and wiping his face on his sleeve.  \"Or had asked Uncle Balla to help us,\" added Frank.  \"They'd be certain to tell all about it.\"  \"Yes; so they would.\"  They settled down in silence, and panted.  \"I tell you what we ought to do! Bait the hog-path, as you would for fish.\" This was the suggestion of the angler, Frank.  \"With what?\"  \"Acorns.\"  The acorns were tolerably plentiful around the roots of the big oaks, so the boys set to work to pick them up. It was an easier job than cutting the log, and it was not long before each had his hat full.  As they started down to the swamp, Frank exclaimed, suddenly, \"Look there, Willy!\"  Willy looked, and not fifty yards away, with their ends resting on old stumps, were three or four \"hacks,\" or piles of rails, which had been mauled the season before and left there, probably having been forgotten or overlooked.  Willy gave a hurrah, while bending under the weight of a large rail.  At the spot where the hog-path came out of the thicket they commenced to build their trap.  First they laid a floor of rails; then they built a pen, five or six rails high, which they strengthened with \"outriders.\" When the pen was finished, they pried up the side nearest the thicket, from the bottom rail, about a foot; that is, high enough for the animals to enter. This they did by means of two rails, using one as a fulcrum and one as a lever, having shortened them enough to enable the work to be done from inside the pen.  The lever they pulled down at the farther end until it touched the bottom of the trap, and fastened it by another rail, a thin one, run at right-angles to the lever, and across the pen. This would slip easily when pushed away from the gap, and needed to be moved only about an inch to slip from the end of the lever and release it; the weight of the pen would then close the gap. Behind this rail the acorns were to be thrown; and the hogs, in trying to get the bait, would push the rail, free the lever or trigger, and the gap would be closed by the fall of the pen when the lever was released.  It was"]]]
