But remember this. It's pitch dark and raining again like cats and dogs; we don't know our way; we are sure to get lost before we have run fifty yards from the house, and these Vigilants, who understand every foot of the country, will divide into small parties, and hunt us down, as sure as fate. And if they can't, they will put hounds on our track--and then we'll be beautifully carved up into beefsteaks. I have seen hounds, and I know how they appreciate a nice little man hunt.\" Watson smiled grimly.  Macgreggor walked silently to one of the windows, opened the sash just a crack, and listened. He could hear nothing but the downpour of the rain. Yet it would not be long before the Vigilants dashed up to the house. No doubt they had all been telling anecdotes in the corner grocery store, and they would take but a short time for the mounting of their horses. Cautiously closing the window he returned to the centre of the room.  \"It's a dark night,\" he said, \"and all the better for a plan I have to propose. We are each secretly armed with pistols, are we not? Well, then, let us put out this candle, and open the window to the left, looking out towards the highroad to Jasper. When the Vigilants come riding up the road and get in front of the house we will suddenly fire on them. This may cause a panic, as the fellows will not be able to tell just where the enemy are, and then----\"  \"Pshaw!\" interrupted Watson. \"You don't know whom you're dealing with. These Vigilants are as brave as they are reckless, and there are at least twenty-five or thirty of them. Three men can't frighten them. They would only get us in the end, even if we did succeed in disabling one or two of them in the first surprise.\"  \"Then what are we to do?\" asked George eagerly. Watson was so composed that the boy felt sure he must have some better plan for escape.  \"I have a scheme,\" said Watson, quite simply. \"I have been hatching it in my brain while we were talking. But the quicker it's put to the test, the quicker will we save our necks. Are you willing to trust me blindly?\"  There was a whispered \"yes\" from both the other conspirators. Watson inspired confidence by his assurance.  \"Then let us get all our clothes, shoes, everything on at once, and walk boldly down-stairs.\"  Three minutes later the trio were marching down-stairs into the kitchen. Hare and his wife were standing at the fireplace, looking the picture of surprise, as their guests burst into the room, with the irrepressible Waggie at their heels. The old negro \"aunty,\" who had been dozing on a stool near the hearth, jumped to her rheumatic feet in consternation. \"Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\" she cried, throwing her withered arms above her turbaned head. For the guests held revolvers in their hands, and the \"aunty's\" heart always sank at the thought of gunpowder.  The farmer took a step forward, as if uncertain what to do or say. At last he said, trying to smile, yet only succeeding in looking hypocritical: \"You ain't going to leave us this time of night, are you? Wait till morning, and get some breakfast.\"  \"It's a nice breakfast you'd give us in the morning,\" laughed Watson, with a significant look at their host. \"A halter stew, or some roast bullets, I guess!\"  Hare jumped backward with such suddenness that he almost knocked into the fire his frightened wife who had been standing directly behind him. \"What do you mean?\" he hissed.  \"You know perfectly well what I mean, Mr. Hare,\" said Watson, looking him straight in the face, whilst the other spectators listened in breathless interest. \"You have sent word to the Jasper Vigilants to ride over here and arrest us, on the suspicion of being spies.\"  Had the heavens suddenly fallen, the countenances of the Hares could not have shown more dismay.  \"How did you find that out?\" asked the farmer, quite forgetting to play his part of amiable host.  \"Never mind how,\" cried George, who was burning to play his part. \"Only it's a pity you haven't as much mercy in you as your wife has.\"  \"Listen,\" said Watson, as he motioned the others in the room to be silent. \"George, you will watch this old negress, and if she attempts to make a sound, or to leave the room before we are ready, give her a hint from your revolver.\"  With a scream of fright, comical in its intensity, the \"aunty\" sank back on her stool near the hearth, and covered her dark face with her hands. There she sat, as if she expected to be murdered at any moment.  \"And you, Macgreggor,\" continued Watson impressively, \"will keep the same sort of watch over Mrs. Hare. Happen what may, there is not to be a sound from either woman.\"  Mrs. Hare started in confusion. Her husband made a bound for the kitchen door. With another bound no less quick Watson darted forward, caught the farmer, pushed him back at the point of the pistol, and bolted the door.  \"What do you want to do?\" demanded Hare. \"Are we to be murdered?\"  \"No,\" cried Watson, \"but----\"  Then there came the sound of horses' hoofs in the distance. Every one listened eagerly, and none more so than the farmer.  \"You're done for,\" he said slowly, casting a half-malevolent, half-triumphant glance at the three Northerners.  \"Not by a great deal,\" said Watson. \"March with me to the parlor, open the front door just a crack, and, when the Vigilants come up, say to them that we three men have escaped from the house, stolen a flatboat, and started to row across the Tennessee River. Send them away and shut the door. I will be standing near you, behind the door, with my pistol leveled at your head. Make one movement to escape, or say anything but what I have told you to say, and you are a dead man!\"  The patter of the horses was becoming more and more distinct.  \"Will you do as I tell you?\" asked Watson, very coolly, as he toyed with his revolver.  \"If I won't?\" asked Hare. His face was now convulsed by a variety of emotions--fear, rage, craftiness, and disappointment.  \"I give you three seconds to choose,\" said Watson. \"If you refuse, you will be stretched out on that floor.\"  Mrs. Hare, with white cheeks, leaned forward, and whispered to her husband: \"Do as he tells you, Jake. Better let these Yankees go, and save your own life.\"  \"One--two----\" counted Watson.  Hare held up his right hand, and then dropped it listlessly by his side.  \"I give in,\" he said sullenly. \"You've got the better of me.\" He looked, for all the world, like a whipped cur.  There was not a second to lose. The horsemen were riding up to the house. Watson motioned to the farmer, who walked into the parlor, which was unlighted, closely followed by the soldier. There were sounds without, as of horses being reined in, and of men's gruff voices. Hare opened the parlor door a few inches, while Watson, safe from observation, stationed himself within a few feet of him, with cocked revolver. \"Remember!\" he whispered, significantly.  \"Is that you, boys?\" shouted Hare. \"Those three spies I sent word about escaped from here ten minutes ago, stole a boat on the bank, down by the landing, and started to row across the river.\"  \"They will never reach the other side a night like this,\" called out some one.  \"What did you let 'em get away from you for?\" asked another of the Vigilants.  \"How could I help it?\" growled the farmer. \"They were well armed--and 'twas three men against one.\"  \"Pah! You've brought us out on a wild-goose chase, and on a durned bad night,\" came a voice from the wet and darkness.  \"Perhaps they'll drift back to this side of the river, and can be caught,\" one Vigilant suggested. But this idea evidently met with little approval. It was plain, from what Watson could hear of the discussion which ensued, that the Vigilants were disgusted. They were ready, indeed, to give up the chase, on the supposition that the three fugitives would either drift down in midstream, or else be capsized and find a watery grave.  \"Come, we'll get home again,\" commanded a horseman, who appeared to be the leader. \"And no thanks to you, Jake Hare, for making us waste our time.\"  \"Say Jake, won't you ask us in to have something warm to drink?\" cried another Vigilant.  Watson edged a trifle nearer to Hare, and whispered: \"Send 'em away at once, or else----\"  Once bring the Vigilants into the house, as the soldier knew, and capture or death would be the result.  Hare could almost feel the cold muzzle of the revolver near his head.  \"Go away, fellows,\" he called, \"You know I ain't got nothing for you.\"  A jeer, and a few sarcastic groans greeted this remark. \"I always reckoned you was a skinflint,\" yelled one of the party.  There was a derisive cheer at this sally. Then, at a word of command, the Vigilants turned their horses and cantered back towards Jasper. The sound of hoofs became fainter and fainter.  \"Shut the door,\" ordered Watson, \"and go back to the kitchen.\"  Sullenly the farmer obeyed. When the two were once more by the blazing hearth, George and Macgreggor, who had been guarding Mrs. Hare and the negress, rushed forward to grasp the hands of their deliverer. They were about to congratulate him upon his successful nerve and diplomacy when he interrupted them.  \"Don't bother about that,\" he said; \"let us get away from here as soon as possible, before our kind host has a chance to play us any more tricks.\"  \"I suppose you think yourself pretty smart, don't you?\" snapped Hare, casting a spiteful glance at Watson.  \"So smart,\" put in George, \"that if you don't want to be laughed at from now until the day of your death you'd better not tell the citizens of Jasper about to-night's occurrences.\"  \"Come, boys, let us be going,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26892"],["title","Chasing an Iron Horse (#5)"],["body"," Watson impatiently, as he offered his hand to Mrs. Hare, and said to that lady: \"Thank you for the best supper we've had since we left--home.\"  Mrs. Hare refused to shake hands, but she regarded Watson with an admiring expression. \"I won't shake hands with you,\" she replied, half smiling, \"for you may be an enemy of the South, but I'm glad you've escaped hanging. You've too much grit for that. As for you, Jake, don't ever pretend to us again that you're the brainiest man in the county.\"  \"Hold your tongue, woman,\" cried the amiable farmer.  In a couple of minutes the three travelers were striking out from the back of the house into the slush, and rain, and blackness of the night. Waggie was occupying his usual place inside a pocket of George's overcoat. He had supped regally at the Hares on bacon and bones, and he felt warm and at peace with the world.  Before the party had more than emerged from the garden (a task by no means easy in itself, on account of the darkness), something whistled by them, to the accompaniment of a sharp report. Looking behind them they saw the meagre form of Hare standing in the kitchen doorway. He held a rifle in his right hand. The kitchen fire made him plainly visible.  \"Pretty good aim, old boy,\" shouted Macgreggor, \"considering you could hardly see us. But I can see you plainly enough.\"  As he spoke he drew his revolver. Hare was already putting the rifle to his shoulder, preparing for another shot. He had hardly had a chance to adjust the gun, however, before he dropped it with a cry of pain and ran into the house. A bullet had come whizzing from Macgreggor, and struck the farmer in his right arm.  \"Just a little souvenir to remember me by,\" laughed the lucky marksman.  \"Hurry up!\" cried Watson. \"To-morrow night we must be in Marietta. We are still many miles away, and in a hostile, unknown country.\"  So the three pushed on into the gloom. The prospect of meeting James Andrews at the appointed place was not reassuring. Their only hope was to keep on along the bank of the Tennessee River until they reached Chattanooga. From there they could take a train for Marietta.  \"Shall we make it?\" thought George. Waggie gave a muffled bark which seemed to say: \"Courage!\"     CHAPTER III  MINGLING WITH THE ENEMY   It was weary work, this tramping along the Tennessee shore, through mud, or fields of stubble, over rocks, or amid dripping trees; but the three kept on towards Chattanooga for a couple of hours, until all the good effects of their warming at Farmer Hare's were quite vanished. Watson, having showed by his mother-wit and presence of mind that he was a man to be relied upon, had now resumed his privilege of growling, and gave vent to many angry words at the roughness and unutterable dreariness of the way.  \"Why was America ever discovered by that inquisitive, prying old Christopher Columbus?\" he grunted, after he had tripped over the stump of a cottonwood-tree, and fallen flat with his face in the slime. \"If he had never discovered America there would never have been any United States; had there never been any United States there would never have been any war between North and South; had there never been any war between North and South I wouldn't be making a fool of myself by being down here. I wish that fellow Columbus had never been born--or, if he was born, that he had never been allowed to sail off for America. Ugh!\"  In a few minutes they reached a log cabin situated on an angle of land where a little stream emptied itself into the now stormy waters of the Tennessee River. There was no light nor sign of life about the mean abode, and the travelers were almost upon it before they saw its low outline in the dense gloom.  \"Look here,\" said Watson, calling a halt. \"There's no use in our trying to go further to-night. It's too dark to make any sort of time. And we are far enough away now from Jasper to avoid any danger of pursuit--even if our amiable friend Mr. Hare should inform the Vigilants.\"  \"Don't be afraid of that,\" said Macgreggor and George in the same breath. Hare was not likely to relate a joke so much at his own expense as their clever escape had proved. Even if he did, they reasoned, the chances of capture were now rather slim, whatever they might have been when the three fugitives were nearer Jasper.  \"Then let us get a few hours' sleep in this cabin,\" urged Watson. \"Some negro probably lives here--and we can tell him our usual Kentucky story. Give the door a pound, George, and wake him up.\"  George used first his hands and then his boots on the door, in a vain effort to make some one hear. He took Waggie out of his pocket, and the shrill little barks of the dog added to the noise as he jumped around his master's feet.  \"Let's break the door down,\" urged Macgreggor. \"The seven sleepers must live here. We might pound all night and not get in.\"  With one accord the three threw themselves vigorously against the door. They expected to meet with some resistance, due to a bolt or two; but, instead of that, the door flew open so suddenly that they were precipitated into the cabin, and lay sprawling on the ground. It had been latched but neither locked nor bolted.  \"We were too smart that time,\" growled Watson, as the three picked themselves up, to the great excitement of Waggie. \"The place must be deserted. So much the better for us. We can get a little sleep without having to go into explanations.\"  He drew from inside his greatcoat, with much care, three or four matches. By lighting, first one and then the others, he was able to grope around until he found the hearth of the cabin. Cold ashes marked the remains of a fire long since extinguished. His foot struck against something which proved to be a small piece of dry pine-wood. With the flame from his last match Watson succeeded in lighting this remnant of kindling. He carefully nursed the new flame until the stick blazed forth like a torch. Then the travelers had a chance to examine the one room which formed the whole interior of the lonely place. The cabin was deserted. It contained not a bit of furniture; nothing, indeed, save bare walls of logs, and rude mortar, and a clean pine floor.  \"This palace can't be renting at a very high price,\" remarked Macgreggor, sarcastically.  \"It will do us well enough for a few hours' sleep,\" said George.  Watson nodded his head in assent. \"It's a shelter from the rain, at least,\" he said, \"and that's something on such a pesky night.\" While he was speaking the rush of the rain without confirmed the truth of his words, and suggested that any roof was better than none. Ere long the pine stick burned itself out; the intruders were left in absolute darkness. But they quickly disposed themselves on the floor, where, worn out by the fatigues of the day and the stirring adventure of the evening, they were soon fast asleep. They had closed the door, near which Waggie had settled his little body in the capacity of a sentinel. George dreamed of his father. He saw him standing at the window of a prison, as he stretched his hands through the bars and cried out: \"George, I am here--here! Help me!\" Then the boy's dream changed. He was back in the dark woods near Shelbyville, listening to Andrews as the leader outlined the expedition in which they were now engaged. In the middle of the conference some one cried: \"The Confederates are on us!\" George tried to run, but something pinned him to the ground--a wild animal was at his throat.  He awoke with a start, to find that Waggie was leaping upon his chest, barking furiously.  \"Hush up, you little rascal!\" ordered George. He felt very sleepy, and he was angry at being aroused. But Waggie went on barking until he had succeeded in awakening Macgreggor and Watson, and convincing his master that something was wrong.  \"What's the trouble?\" demanded Watson.  \"Listen,\" said George, softly. He was on his feet in an instant, as he ran first to one and then to the other of the two windows which graced the cabin. These windows, however, were barricaded with shutters. He hurried to the door, which he opened a few inches. The rain had now stopped, and he could hear, perhaps a quarter of a mile away, the sound of horses moving cautiously through the mud, along the river bank. In a twinkling Watson and Macgreggor were at his side, straining their ears.  \"Can it be cavalry?\" asked Macgreggor.  \"Mounted men at least,\" whispered Watson. \"Perhaps the Vigilants are on our track, bad luck to them!\"  \"Can Hare have told them, after all?\" queried George.  \"Don't know about that,\" muttered Watson, \"but I think we have the gentlemen from Jasper to deal with once again.\"  \"Let's decamp into the darkness before it's too late,\" said Macgreggor.  \"Come, come,\" whispered Watson impatiently. \"If they are on the scent, and we leave this hut, they will only run us to earth like hounds after a fox.\"  The baying of dogs which were evidently accompanying the party gave a sudden and terrible effect to the force of Watson's argument. And now the Vigilants, if such they were, came nearer and nearer. The three Northerners who listened so anxiously at the doorway could already detect the sound of voices.  \"There's but one thing for us to do,\" quickly murmured Watson. \"We must stay in this cabin.\"  \"But they won't pass the place by,\" urged Macgreggor. \"If they know it to be deserted by a tenant this is the very reason for their looking in to see if we are hiding here. And when it comes to defending ourselves, how can we put up any sort of barricade?\"  \"When you can't use force, or hide yourself, try a little strategy,\" answered the soldier. \"Can either of you fellows talk like a darky?\"  \"Not I,\" said Macgreggor. Had he been asked if he could speak Hebrew, he would not have been more surprised.  \"Can you, George?\" asked Watson, as he shut the door.  \"I might,\" whispered George. \"When I was up in Cincinnati we boys used----\"  \"Never mind what you boys did--only do as I tell you, and if you"]]]
