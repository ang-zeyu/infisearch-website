Come, quick! let us go   and look for the right man.    LAND.   Is he not the right one? Surely!    FRAN.   Surely not! Come, quick! I have not yet wished your daughter good   morning.    LAND.   Oh! you are very good   (still does not stir).    FRAN. (takes hold of him).   Come, and we will make the bill of fare. Let us see what we shall   have.    LAND.   You shall have first of all!!!!!    FRAN.   Stop, I say, stop! If my mistress knows now what she is to have for   dinner, it will be all over with her appetite. Come, we must talk that   over in private.   (Drags him off.)      SCENE IX.   Minna, Major von Tellheim    MIN.   Well, are we still both mistaken?    MAJ. T.   Would to heaven it were so--But there is only one Minna, and you are   that one.    MIN.   What ceremony! The world might hear what we have to say to one   another.    MAJ. T.   You here? What do you want here, Madam?    MIN.   Nothing now   (going to him with open arms).   I have found all that I wanted.    MAJ. T. (drawing back).   You seek a prosperous man, and one worthy of your love; and you find--   a wretched one.    MIN.   Then do you love me no longer? Do you love another?    MAJ. T.   Ah! he never loved you, who could love another afterwards.    MIN.   You draw but one dagger from my breast; for if I have lost your heart,   what matters whether indifference or more powerful charms than mine   have robbed me of it? You love me no longer; neither do you love   another? Wretched man indeed, if you love nothing!    MAJ. T.   Right; the wretched must love nothing. He merits his misfortunes, if   he cannot achieve this victory over himself--if he can allow the woman   he loves to take part in his misfortune... Oh! how difficult is   this victory!... Since reason and necessity have commanded me to   forget Minna von Barnhelm, what pains have I taken! I was just   beginning to hope that my trouble would not for ever be in vain--and   you appear.    MIN.   Do I understand you right? Stop, sir; let us see what we mean before   we make further mistakes. Will you answer me one question?    MAJ. T.   Any one.    MIN.   But will you answer me without shift or subterfuge? With nothing but a   plain \"Yes,\" or \"No?\"    MAJ. T.   I will--if I can.    MIN.   You can. Well, notwithstanding the pains which you have taken to   forget me, do you love me still, Tellheim?    MAJ. T.   Madam, that question!!!!!    MIN.   You have promised to answer Yes, or No.    MAJ. T.   And added, If I can.    MIN.   You can. You must know what passes in your heart. Do you love me   still, Tellheim? Yes, or No?    MAJ. T.   If my heart!!!!!    MIN.   Yes, or No?    MAJ. T.   Well, Yes!    MIN.   Yes?    MAJ. T.   Yes, yes! Yet!!!!!    MIN.   Patience! You love me still; that is enough for me. Into what a mood   have we fallen! an unpleasant, melancholy, infectious mood! I assume   my own again. Now, my dear unfortunate, you love me still, and have   your Minna still, and are unhappy? Hear what a conceited, foolish   thing your Minna was--is. She allowed--allows herself, to imagine that   she makes your whole happiness. Declare all your misery at once. She   would like to try how far she can outweigh it.--Well?    MAJ. T.   Madam, I am not accustomed to complain.    MIN.   Very well. I know nothing in a soldier, after boasting, that pleases   me less than complaining. But there is a certain cold, careless way of   speaking of bravery and misfortune!!!!!    MAJ. T.   Which at the bottom is still boasting and complaining.    MIN.   You disputant! You should not have called yourself unhappy at all   then. You should have told the whole, or kept quiet. Reason and   necessity commanded you to forget me? I am a great stickler for   reason; I have a great respect for necessity. But let me hear how   reasonable this reason, and how necessary this necessity may be.    MAJ. T.   Listen then, Madam. You call me Tellheim; the name is correct. But   suppose I am not that Tellheim whom you knew at home; the prosperous   man, full of just pretensions, with a thirst for glory; the master of   all his faculties, both of body and mind; before whom the lists of   honour and prosperity stood open; who, if he was not then worthy of   your heart and your hand, dared to hope that he might daily become   more nearly so. This Tellheim I am now, as little as I am my own   father. They both have been. Now I am Tellheim the discharged, the   suspected, the cripple, the beggar. To the former, Madam, you promised   your hand; do you wish to keep your word?    MIN.   That sounds very tragic... Yet, Major Tellheim, until I find the   former one again--I am quite foolish about the Tellheims--the latter   will have to help me in my dilemma. Your hand, dear beggar!   (Taking his hand).    MAJ. T. (holding his hat before his face with the other hand, and   turning away from her).   This is too much!... What am I?... Let me go, Madam. Your   kindness tortures me! Let me go.    MIN.   What is the matter? Where would you go?    MAJ. T.   From you!    MIN.   From me   (drawing his hand to her heart)?   Dreamer!    MAJ. T.   Despair will lay me dead at your feet.    MIN.   From me?    MAJ. T.   From you. Never, never to see you again. Or at least determined, fully   determined, never to be guilty of a mean action; never to cause you to   commit an imprudent one. Let me go, Minna!   (Tears himself away, and Exit.)    MIN. (calling after him).   Let you go, Minna? Minna, let you go? Tellheim! Tellheim!     ACT III.      SCENE I.   The Parlour. Just (with a letter in his hand)    JUST.   Must I come again into this cursed house! A note from my master to her   ladyship that would be his sister. I hope nothing will come of this,   or else there will be no end to letter carrying. I should like to be   rid of it; but yet I don't wish to go into the room. The women ask so   many questions, and I hate answering--Ah! the door opens. Just what I   wanted, the waiting puss!      Scene II   Franziska and Just    FRAN. (calling through the door by which she has just entered).   Fear not; I will watch. See!   (observing Just)   I have met with something immediately. But nothing is to be done with   that brute.    JUST.   Your servant.    FRAN.   I should not like such a servant.    JUST.   Well, well, pardon the expression! There is a note from my master to   your mistress--her ladyship--his sister, wasn't it?--sister.    FRAN.   Give it me!   (Snatches it from his hand.)    JUST.   You will be so good, my master begs, as to deliver it. Afterwards you   will be so good, my master begs, as not to think I ask for anything!    FRAN.   Well?    JUST.   My master understands how to manage the affair. He knows that the way   to the young lady is through her maid, methinks. The maid will   therefore be so good, my master begs, as to let him know whether he   may not have the pleasure of speaking with the maid for a quarter of   an hour.    FRAN.   With me?    JUST.   Pardon me, if I do not give you your right title. Yes, with you.   Only for one quarter of an hour; but alone, quite alone, in private   tete-a-tete. He has something very particular to say to you.    FRAN.   Very well! I have also much to say to him. He may come; I shall be at   his service.    JUST.   But when can he come? When is it most convenient for you, young woman?   In the evening?    FRAN.   What do you mean? Your master can come when he pleases; and now be off.    JUST.   Most willingly!   (Going.)    FRAN.   I say! one word more! Where are the rest of the Major's servants?    JUST.   The rest? Here, there, and everywhere.    FRAN.   Where is William?    JUST.   The valet? He has let him go for a trip.    FRAN.   Oh! and Philip, where is he?    JUST.   The huntsman? Master has found him a good place.    FRAN.   Because he does not hunt now, of course. But Martin?    JUST.   The coachman? He is off on a ride.    FRAN.   And Fritz?    JUST.   The footman? He is promoted.    FRAN.   Where were you then, when the Major was quartered in Thuringia with us   that winter? You were not with him, I suppose!    JUST.   Oh! yes, I was groom; but I was in the hospital.    FRAN.   Groom! and now you are!!!!!    JUST.   All in all; valet and huntsman, footman and groom.    FRAN.   Well, I never! To turn away so many good, excellent servants, and to   keep the very worst of all! I should like to know what your master   finds in you!    JUST.   Perhaps he finds that I am an honest fellow.    FRAN.   Oh! one is precious little if one is nothing more than honest. William   was another sort of a man! So your master has let him go for a trip!    JUST.   Yes, he... let him--because he could not prevent him.    FRAN.   How so?    JUST.   Oh! William will do well on his travels. He took master's wardrobe   with him.    FRAN.   What! he did not run away with it?    JUST.   I cannot say that exactly; but when we left Nurnberg, he did not   follow us with it.    FRAN.   Oh! the rascal!    JUST.   He was the right sort! he could curl hair and shave--and chatter and   flirt--couldn't he?    FRAN.   At any rate, I would not have turned away the huntsman, had I been in   the Major's place. If he did not want him any longer as huntsman, he   was still a useful fellow. Where has he found him a place?    JUST.   With the Commandant of Spandau.    FRAN.   The fortress! There cannot be much hunting within the walls either.    JUST.   Oh! Philip does not hunt there.    FRAN.   What does he do, then?    JUST.   He rides--on the treadmill.    FRAN.   The treadmill!    JUST.   But only for three years. He made a bit of a plot amongst master's   company, to get six men through the outposts.    FRAN.   I am astonished; the knave!    JUST.   Ah! he was a useful fellow; a huntsman who knew all the foot paths and   by-ways for fifty miles round, through forests and bogs. And he could   shoot!    FRAN.   It is lucky the Major has"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2663"],["title","Minna Von Barnhelm (#6)"],["body","got the honest coachman.    JUST.   Has he got him still?    FRAN.   I thought you said Martin was off on a ride: of course he will come   back!    JUST.   Do you think so?    FRAN.   Well, where has he ridden to?    JUST.   It is now going on for ten weeks since he rode master's last and only   horse--to water.    FRAN.   And has not he come back yet? Oh! the rascal!    JUST.   The water may have washed the honest coachman away. Oh! he was a   famous coachman! He had driven ten years in Vienna. My master will   never get such another again. When the horses were in full gallop, he   only had to say \"Wo!\" and there they stood, like a wall. Moreover, he   was a finished horse-doctor!    FRAN.   I begin now to be anxious about the footman's promotion.    JUST.   No, no; there is no occasion for that. He has become a drummer in a   garrison regiment.    FRAN.   I thought as much!    JUST.   Fritz chummed up with a scamp, never came home at night, made debts   everywhere in master's name, and a thousand rascally tricks. In short,   the Major saw that he was determined to rise in the world   (pantomimically imitating the act of hanging),   so he put him in the right road.    FRAN.   Oh! the stupid!    JUST.   Yet a perfect footman, there is no doubt of that. In running, my   master could not catch him on his best horse if he gave him fifty   paces; but on the other hand, Fritz could give the gallows a thousand   paces, and, I bet my life, he would overhaul it. They were all great   friends of yours, eh, young woman?... William and Philip, Martin   and Fritz! Now, Just wishes you good day.   (Exit.)      SCENE III.   Franziska, _and afterwards the_ Landlord    FRAN. (looking after him seriously).   I deserve the hit! Thank you, Just. I undervalued honesty. I will not   forget the lesson. Ah! our unfortunate Major!   (Turns round to enter her mistress' room, when the Landlord comes.)    LAND.   Wait a bit, my pretty maid.    FRAN.   I have not time now, Mr. Landlord.    LAND.   Only half a moment! No further tidings of the Major? That surely could   not possibly be his leave-taking!    FRAN.   What could not?    LAND.   Has not our ladyship told you? When I left you, my pretty maid, below   in the kitchen, I returned accidentally into this room!!!!!    FRAN.   Accidentally--with a view to listen a little.    LAND.   What, girl! how can you suspect me of that? There is nothing so bad in   a landlord as curiosity. I had not been here long, when suddenly her   ladyship's door burst open: the Major dashed out; the lady after him;   both in such a state of excitement; with looks--in attitudes--that   must be seen to be understood. She seized hold of him; he tore himself   away; she seized him again--\"Tellheim.\" \"Let me go, Madam.\" \"Where?\"   Thus he drew her as far as the staircase. I was really afraid he would   drag her down; but he got away. The lady remained on the top step;   looked after him; called after him; wrung her hands. Suddenly she   turned round; ran to the window; from the window to the staircase   again; from the staircase into the room, backwards and forwards. There   I stood; she passed me three times without seeing me. At length it   seemed as if she saw me; but heaven defend us! I believe the lady took   me for you. \"Franziska,\" she cried, with her eyes fixed upon me, \"am I   happy now?\" Then she looked straight up to the ceiling, and said again   --\"Am I happy now?\" Then she wiped the tears from her eyes, and   smiled, and asked me again--\"Franziska, am I happy now?\" I really   felt, I know not how. Then she ran to the door of her room, and turned   round again towards me, saying--\"Come, Franziska, whom do you pity   now?\" and with that she went in.    FRAN.   Oh! Mr. Landlord, you dreamt that.    LAND.   Dreamt! No, my pretty maid; one does not dream so minutely. Yes, what   would not I give--I am not curious: but what would not I give--to have   the key to it!    FRAN.   The key? Of our door? Mr. Landlord, that is inside; we took it in at   night; we are timid.    LAND.   Not that sort of key; I mean, my dear girl, the key--the explanation,   as it were; the precise connexion of all that I have seen.    FRAN.   Indeed! Well, good-bye, Mr. Landlord. Shall we have dinner soon?    LAND.   My dear girl, not to forget what I came to say!!!!!    FRAN.   Well? In as few words as possible.    LAND.   Her ladyship has my ring still. I call it mine!!!!!    FRAN.   You shall not lose it.    LAND.   I have no fear on that account: I merely put you in mind. Do you see,   I do not wish to have it again at all. I can guess pretty well how she   knew the ring, and why it was so like her own. It is best in her   hands. I do not want it any more; and I can put them down--the hundred   pistoles which I advanced for it, to the lady's bill. Will not that   do, my pretty maid?      SCENE IV.   Paul Werner, Landlord, Franziska    WER.   There he is!    FRAN.   A hundred pistoles? I thought it was only eighty.    LAND.   True, only ninety, only ninety. I will do so, my pretty maid, I will   do so.    FRAN.   All that will come right, Mr. Landlord.    WER. (coming from behind, and tapping Franziska on the shoulder).   Little woman--Little woman.    FRAN. (frightened).   Oh! dear!    WER.   Don't be alarmed! I see you are pretty, and a stranger, too. And   strangers who are pretty must be warned. Little woman! little woman! I   advise you to beware of that fellow!   (Pointing to the Landlord).    LAND.   Ah! What an unexpected pleasure! Herr Werner! Welcome, welcome! Yes,   you are just the same jovial, joking, honest Werner! So you are to   beware of me, my pretty maid. Ha! ha! ha!    WER.   Keep out of his way everywhere!    LAND.   My way? Am I such a dangerous man? Ha! ha! ha! Hear him, my pretty   maid! A good joke, isn't it?    WER.   People like him always call it a joke, if one tells them the truth.    LAND.   The truth. Ha! ha! ha! Better and better, my pretty maid, isn't it? He   knows how to joke! I dangerous? I? Twenty years ago there might have   been something in it. Yes, yes, my pretty maid, then I was a dangerous   man: many a one knew it; but now!!!!!    WER.   Oh! the old fool!    LAND.   There it is! When we get old, danger is at an end! It will be so with   you too, Herr Werner!    WER.   You utter old fool!--Little woman, you will give me credit for enough   common sense not to speak of danger from him. That one devil has left   him, but seven others have entered into him.    LAND.   Oh! hear him! How cleverly he can turn things about. Joke upon joke,   and always something new! Ah! he is an excellent man, Paul Werner is.   (To Franziska, as if whispering.)   A well-to-do man, and a bachelor still. He has a nice little freehold   three miles from here. He made prize-money in the war, and was a   sergeant to the Major. Yes, he is a real friend of the Major's; he is   a friend who would give his life for him.    WER.   Yes; and that is a friend of the Major's--that is a friend... whose   life the Major ought to take   (Pointing to the Landlord).    LAND.   How! What! No, Herr Werner, that is not a good joke. I no friend to   the Major! I don't understand that joke.    WER.   Just has told me pretty things.    LAND.   Just! Ah! I thought Just was speaking through you. Just is a nasty,   ill-natured man. But here on the spot stands a pretty maid--she can   speak, she can say if I am no friend of the Major's--if I have not   done him good service. And why should not I be his friend? Is not he a   deserving man? It is true, he has had the misfortune to be discharged;   but what of that? The king cannot be acquainted with all deserving   officers; and if he knew them, he could not reward them all.    WER.   Heaven put those words into your mouth. But Just... certainly there   is nothing remarkable about Just, but still Just is no liar; and if   that what he has told me be true!!!!!    LAND.   I don't want to hear anything about Just. As I said, this pretty maid   here can speak.   (Whispering to her.)   You know, my dear; the ring! Tell Herr Werner about it. Then he will   learn better what I am. And that it may not appear as if she only said   what I wish, I will not even be present. I will go; but you shall tell   me after, Herr Werner, you shall tell me, whether Just is not a foul   slanderer.   (Exit.)      SCENE V.   Werner, Franziska    WER.   Little woman, do you know my Major?    FRAN.   Major von Tellheim? Yes, indeed, I do know that good man.    WER.   Is he not a good man? Do you like him?    FRAN.   From the bottom of my heart.    WER.   Indeed! I tell you what, little woman, you are twice as pretty now as   you were before. But what are the services, which the landlord says he   has rendered our Major?    FRAN.   That is what I don't know; unless he wished to take credit to himself   for the good result which fortunately has arisen from his knavish   conduct.    WER.   Then what Just told me is true?   (Towards the side where the Landlord went off.)   A lucky thing for you that you are gone! He did really turn him out of   his room?--To treat such a man so, because the donkey fancied that he   had no more money! The Major no money!    FRAN.   What! Has the Major any money?    WER.   By the load. He doesn't know how much he has. He doesn't know who is   in his debt. I am his debtor, and have brought him some old arrears.   Look, little woman, in this purse   (drawing it out of one pocket)   are a hundred louis d'ors; and in this packet   (drawing it out of another pocket)   a hundred ducats. All his money!    FRAN.   Really! Why then does the Major pawn his things? He pledged a ring,   you know!!!!!    WER.   Pledged! Don't you believe it. Perhaps he wanted to get rid of the   rubbish.    FRAN.   It is no rubbish; it is a very valuable ring; which, moreover, I   suspect, he received from a loving hand.    WER.   That will be the reason. From a loving hand! Yes, yes; such a thing   often puts"]]]
