The Neanderthalers looked stupidly down at him for a moment. The huge male dropped the meat he was eating and rose, his mane and beard bristling with rage. With a roar, he charged down the slope, a huge flint smiting-stone in either hand.         *       *       *       *       *  The hunters closed up on Uglik. As the attacker came within range, he was saluted with a shower of stones which sprang harmlessly from his huge rounded chest. Uglik hurled his spear. It pierced the apeman's shoulder but did not make him pause. Other spears were hurled and struck their mark, but without a pause the Neanderthaler came on with howls of rage and pain, bloody froth flying from his lips.  Anak had not thrown his spear, and Invar, who stood beside his hero, had likewise retained his weapon. The apeman came on with a rush. Uglik sprang forward to meet him, but another hunter was directly in the path of the attack. He swung his flint smiting-stone with a will, but his blow was futile. He went down before a sweep of the apeman's arm, his skull crushed to fragments.  Uglik struck at the attacker. The Neanderthaler turned toward him, but as he did so, Anak hurled his spear. At close range, the stone-tipped weapon passed nearly through the apeman. He stopped his rush and began to cough up blood from a pierced lung. Anak seized Invar's spear and sprang to the attack. An unfledged youth who craved distinction, rushed ahead of the Chief Hunter, but his act spelled his doom. One blow of the huge smiting-stone laid him dead. Anak hurled Invar's spear and again his weapon found its mark. The Neanderthaler roared with pain and sank gradually to his knees. Uglik dashed in, knife in hand. He threw himself on the prostrate monster and stabbed him again and again. The blows struck home, but with a last effort the apeman threw off his assailant and struck at him with the huge stone which had already robbed the tribe of two of its members. Before the blow could fall, Samo, one of the hunters, threw himself in the way and took the blow on his arm. The arm bone snapped like a pipestem, but it was the monster's dying effort. With a shudder, he fell back dead.         *       *       *       *       *  A ferocious howl rent the air. With a smiting-stone in each hand, the female charged down at them. She was somewhat smaller than the male, but still a match for any two of the men. Uglik's face paled as he wrenched Invar's spear from the dead male and turned to face her. The howl was repeated from farther up the ravine. Two more males were approaching at a lumbering run, smiting-stones in either hand. Uglik was a brave man, but he was also a cautious leader. He did not care to expose his tribe to almost certain annihilation and he led a wild retreat down the valley, Samo, with his arm hanging limp, bringing up the rear. The Neanderthalers did not follow into the open valley.  Again at the camping place, Uglik called his hunters into council. The situation was grave enough. With the Neanderthalers so near them, it meant eventual annihilation to stay where they were, yet there was no place they could go. They had been driven from their old home by hordes of men who came up from the south. They had fought to retain their ancestral hunting grounds where they had dwelt since the beginning of time, but a series of defeats at the hands of overwhelming numbers had dwindled down the tribe until a migration was necessary. They had followed the migrating game toward the unknown north.  Several times they had tried to stop, but each time they had found the land in possession of other and stronger tribes. Their men had been killed and their women stolen until they again took up their march to the north. From the hundred that had formerly called Uglik \"Father,\" there now remained only a score of women and children, a half dozen youths, and five able-bodied hunters, besides Uglik.  South, they dared not go. North, there lay unknown horrors. West lay the raging sea. East, the Neanderthalers blocked the way.         *       *       *       *       *  The council broke up with no action decided on. Faced with the alternatives of moving or staying, there seemed to be little choice. Only death faced them, whichever way they turned. Uglik posted guards about the camp and announced that he would retire and consult with Degar Astok as to their future course.  As he disappeared into the woods, Esle sidled up to Anak.  \"It seems that Degar Astok no longer loves Uglik,\" she said slyly. \"Does not the Chief Hunter agree with me?\"  Anak looked at the withered hag coldly.  \"Who am I to tell his Priestess whom Degar Astok loves?\" he asked. \"You are his voice and should know.\"  \"True, Anak, I am his voice, and the God loves me,\" she went on, \"yet it may be that men do not always love me. Uglik thinks that I have given him false counsel and he is ready for a new Priestess to announce the will of Degar Astok to him. He believes that a new and younger Priestess would bring back the favor of the God.\"  \"What is that to me?\" asked Anak.  \"You desire the maiden, Una?\"  \"And if I do?\"  \"You are not to have her. Uglik will never grant your request. Already he plans to make her the High Priestess, should an accident happen to me.\"  Anak started. If Esle spoke the truth, it ended his chances of having Una. All women were tabu to all save the Father, but the High Priestess was doubly sacred.  \"What am I to do?\" he demanded.  Esle smiled slyly.  \"I was the Voice of the God before Uglik was Father,\" she said in a low voice, \"and I would be so after he is gone. Cry you rannag on him. I know many things, and I will cast a spell on him so that victory will be easy for you. Then will you be Father. The maiden Una will be yours, and old Esle will remain the High Priestess.\"  \"To give me false counsel as you have Uglik, and in time to plot my overthrow and death with another,\" said Anak sternly. \"No, woman or devil, whichever you are, I want no help of yours. If I ever cry rannag on Uglik, I will defeat him by my strength or not at all. If I win to be Father, be assured that an 'accident' will happen to you shortly.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Esle frothed at the mouth with rage.  \"You shall never have the maiden!\" she screamed. \"Rather will I kill her than that you shall have her. It was in my mind to make you Chief and to lead you from this trap that Uglik had brought you into, but you have sealed your doom and hers. I go to prepare a curse.\"  She turned to depart, but Anak grasped her by the arm.  \"Listen, woman,\" he said sternly as he raised his spear, \"it is in my mind to kill you and make an end of your evil plottings.\"  \"Spare me! Spare me, noble Anak!\" shrieked the hag, dropping to her knees as the flint point of Anak's spear hovered over her. \"I will not harm her nor you, either. I will soften Uglik's heart toward you and make him give you the maiden. I will declare it is the will of the God.\"  Anak lowered the spear.  \"As long as Una is safe, your life is spared,\" he said grimly; \"but pray to Degar Astok to keep her safe. Should any harm befall her, your life will answer for it.\"  \"I will weave spells to guard her from harm, Anak,\" she cried eagerly. \"Only let me live, brave hunter!\"  Anak spurned her contemptuously from him. The hag scuttled away and took the path into the woods which Uglik had taken earlier. Later in the day she returned with the Father. Uglik announced briefly that it was the will of Degar Astok that they remain at their present camping place.         *       *       *       *       *  Then began a time of horror for the children of the tribe. If one of them strayed for even a short distance from the circle of the camp fire at night, there came a scream from the darkness and the tribe would mourn another lost member. The tales of man-eating giants and ogres which even yet haunt the dreams of childhood have descended to us through the ages from those grim times when the race of men learned the lesson of fear of the dark that they are now slowly and painfully unlearning.  Anak did not renew his request for Una. He knew from her smiles that the maiden was more than willing to become his property, but in the face of their daily peril, he was not willing to precipitate a crisis which might easily cost the tribe most or all of their few remaining warriors. He kept a sharp watch on Esle and on Uglik, but neither the High Priestess nor the Father seemed to notice the girl.  As time went on, the Neanderthalers lost their fear of the fire and grew bolder. Their gray shapes could be seen prowling around at night, just outside the protecting circle of light. The climax came at last. There was a scream in the night. A howl of triumph came from the darkness. The quickly aroused hunters could see nothing at which to cast their spears.  \"Who is missing?\" demanded Uglik as the hunters returned empty handed.  \"The maiden, Una,\" cried Esle shrilly.  Anak rushed at her, spear in hand.  \"Unsay those words, hag of evil omen!\" he roared. \"Where have you hidden her?\"  \"Ask of the cousins of Gumor,\" she replied as she ducked behind the protecting frame of Uglik. \"They have taken her from us.\"  Anak dropped his spear and buried his face in his hands. When he raised his head again, resolution showed in his handsome face.  \"Prepare spears and throwing-stones,\" he cried. \"To-morrow we attack the cousins of Gumor. Either they or we shall be no more when the night falls again.\"  A murmur of dissent went around the camp. Uglik sprang to his feet.  \"What means the Chief Hunter of the tribe of Ugar?\" he demanded.  \"I mean that to-morrow we settle for all time who rules in this valley, the tribe of Ugar or the cousins of Gumor.\"  \"And has the Father no voice in the council of the tribe?\"  \"We have come to the end,\" replied Anak. \"If we do not strike now, soon we will be too weak"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26989"],["title","B. C. 30,000 (#2)"],["body","strike. To-morrow we attack!\"  \"I am Father of the tribe of Ugar,\" replied Uglik with a dangerous note in his voice. \"No one gives orders here except me. On you, Anak, the Chief Hunter that was, I place the word of death! Slay him!\"  The hunters raised their spears doubtfully. Anak raised his, ready to cast it at Uglik. Before a blow could be struck, a figure sprang across the fire and took a stand, back to back with Anak.  \"Who strikes my friend, strikes me!\" cried Invar.         *       *       *       *       *  Uglik gave a gasp at this fresh defection from his authority. He roared to the hunters to strike. The three hunters remaining to the tribe advanced half-heartedly. None of them cared to face Anak; and Invar, young as he was, had already proven himself a mighty warrior. Uglik shouldered them aside with a roar of wrath. Before he could attack, Anak's cry stopped him.  \"Hold, Uglik!\" cried the Chief Hunter. \"If you attack, the tribe will lose most or all of its hunters. You have put the death word on me, as is your right. I go now against the cousins of Gumor, and that, I think, is death. Let me go in peace and with weapons. Before they tear me limb from limb, at least one of them will not be alive.\"  \"And I go with Anak!\" cried Invar. \"More than one of the cousins of Gumor will know that the Chief Hunter of the tribe of Ugar and his friend have visited their home.\"  Uglik paused. No trace of fear entered his heart, but the wily politician saw the force of Anak's argument. He would gain doubly by the course that the hunter had proposed.  \"Go in peace, and with weapons,\" he said as he lowered his spear. \"Esle will take your weapons and make spells over them that will increase their might. At dawn you shall go. The word of death is on you, so come not back to the tribe again. Once you leave the camp, you are outlaw.\"  \"So be it!\" replied Anak.  Shortly before the dawn, Esle crept to Anak's side.  \"I've wrought spells over your weapons, Chief Hunter,\" she said softly, \"and over those of your companion. Remember this when the cousins of Gumor attack you.\"  \"I will, hag of evil,\" said Anak grimly. \"Better will it be for you that we never return.\"  \"Why leave?\" came Esle's insinuating voice. \"I am still ready to help you. Cry rannag on Uglik in the morning. Your weapons have had my attention and his have not. That alone would decide the fight. Slay him and the warriors of the tribe will fight at your back. I know spells, and mayhap, they will prevail even against the cousins of Gumor.\"  \"I go but for vengeance, Esle,\" said Anak wearily. \"With Una gone, I have no desire to live.\"  \"There are other maidens who are fair, Anak, and when you are Father you will have them all.\"  \"Leave me, Esle,\" said Anak shortly. \"I desire none but Una.\"  \"And may the cousins of Gumor crack your bones between their teeth,\" she hissed venomously as she slipped away into the darkness.         *       *       *       *       *  As the sun rose above the horizon, Anak and Invar took their way up the valley. Each carried three flint-tipped throwing-spears, while a good supply of flint throwing-stones were in their skin pouches. Half a mile from camp, Anak turned to his companion.  \"I thank you for coming with me,\" he said, his hand on Invar's shoulder. \"It is the deed of a brave man.\"  Invar flushed and looked down.  \"The least that I can do is to go to Degar Astok with my friend,\" he said.  \"It is the deed of a brave man, yet I think we are not yet ripe to die.\"  \"We go against the cousins of Gumor, do we not?\" asked the lad.  \"We do.\"  \"And is that not death?\"  \"Mayhap, and yet, I have a plan. We may live.\"  \"How can we two expect to do what all the tribe of Ugar dare not try?\"  \"The tribe of Ugar, or a dozen tribes of Ugar, could not conquer with Uglik leading them,\" replied Anak, \"yet we two may do so. Hark now to my plan. Like Gumor, the gray ape, his cousins walk ever with their eyes cast down. While we have been hunting, I have been spying on them in their home. Never have I seen one look up, and it may be that they cannot. Above or on a level with us, they can easily kill us. If we stand on the rocks above them, they cannot see us and will be at our mercy. They can run as fast as we on level ground, but going uphill, we will leave them as Guno, the deer, leaves Kena. They are few in number; I have watched and seen but two hunters and three females. It is my plan to scale the cliffs and watch them below us. When the time is ripe, we will launch our throwing-spears. If we fail to make a kill, we will bound up the hill and escape to strike again.\"  Invar looked with admiration at his leader. The habit of connected thought and reasoning was new in the world in those days. Such boldness of conception as was shown by Anak's plan was a thing for marvel. As the ramifications of the plan seeped into Invar's brain, his face glowed with enthusiasm.  \"Anak should be Father of the tribe of Ugar!\" he cried.  \"That may yet come to pass,\" replied Anak enigmatically. \"If I kill Uglik, however, it will be to avenge Una, not to win the chieftainship. Now keep silence, for here is the home of the cousins of Gumor.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cautiously the two hunters passed the mouth of the ravine and climbed the slopes of the valley. Once on the level ground, they moved to the edge of the ravine and looked down into it. Nothing could be seen moving. Anak led the way a hundred yards farther up the ravine.  \"Below us is a cave where dwell two,\" he whispered. \"Make ready your spear while I sound the challenge.\"  He raised his voice in a wild howl of challenge. For a moment there was silence. Then from the ravine came a hoarse rumbling bellow. An enormous male made his appearance, his mane and beard bristling with rage. He darted his eyes hither and thither, seeking the source of the challenge. Again a hoarse roar came from his broad, thick lips. As it rose to a crescendo, Anak hurled his spear.  His aim was true. The point struck the Neanderthaler at the junction of his neck and shoulder. As it struck, the haft flew from the spear and bounded down the slope. The first point made only a surface wound.  The apeman roared with pain and rage. Still he did not see his enemies. With careful aim, Invar launched his weapon. The stone-tipped spear struck the giant's groin, but the haft broke and the head was barely buried in the flesh. The Neanderthaler pricked up his pointed, lobeless ears, and located the source of the shout. By bending back his torso, he looked upward. With a roar of rage he started up the slope, a huge flint smiting-stone grasped in each hairy paw.  Anak and Invar dashed up the slope ahead of him. The keenness of the Chief Hunter's powers of observation was attested by the fact that they easily increased their distance from their pursuer. As they ran, Invar's foot dislodged a boulder which thundered down the slope. The Neanderthaler did not see it coming until it was too late to dodge. The stone took him full in the chest and he rolled down the slope, a shower of smaller stones going with him.  He smashed against a tree. With shouts of triumph, Anak and Invar bounded down the slope. The Neanderthaler was dying, his chest crushed in. Invar raised a spear and drove it at his heart. The weapon struck fair, but again the head of the spear came off the shaft. A sudden thought illuminated Anak's brain.  \"Esle!\" he cried in rage. \"She had our weapons last night!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He studied the two spears remaining in his hand. Each of them had the hide lashing which bound the head to the haft cut through. The weapons were useless.  Invar's face paled. From up the slope a roar assailed their ears. The female was rushing down at them, smiting-stones in hand.  \"Fly, Invar!\" cried Anak. \"Run up the slope and throw down stones at her. I will hold her for a moment.\"  \"Invar stays with his friend!\" cried the boy stubbornly as he gripped his useless throwing-spear.  \"Run up the slope!\" stormed Anak. \"It is our only chance. Remember how the male died!\"  Slowly the idea penetrated Invar's brain. With a shout he dashed away. He circled the oncoming female and got above her. Anak hurled one of his crippled spears. It struck her full in the chest, but made only a flesh wound as the handle dropped away. The female roared with rage and hurled herself at the hunter. Anak leaped to one side and ran for dear life. The clumsy female checked her rush and turned after him. He rapidly gained on her. A shout from above reached him.  \"Run to your left, Anak!\"  The hunter swerved sharply to his left. Invar threw his shoulder against a huge boulder on the slope. The stone rocked but did not fall. Again the lad exerted himself until his muscles cracked under the strain. The boulder tottered for a moment and then rolled down the slope, gathering momentum as it rolled. It was deflected from the direct line of the female's attack, but a smaller stone it dislodged struck her on the shoulder and knocked her from her feet.  \"More stones, Invar!\" cried Anak.         *       *       *       *       *  The two exerted themselves and an avalanche of rocks thundered down the slope. The female strove to rise, but she was overwhelmed. Down the slope rushed the two hunters, intent on finishing her with their smiting-stones and knives. She lay in a twisted heap, whimpering plaintively. Invar's knife found her heart, and she sank back dead.  \"Well struck, Invar!\" cried Anak. \"Would that we had spears. Others of the cousins of Gumor are coming.\"  Bellowing roars came from higher up the ravine. The two hunters bounded back up the slope. Down the ravine came another female, followed by a fourteen-year-old boy. Contemptuous of their assailants, the hunters betrayed their whereabouts with shouts. The female accepted the challenge and climbed heavily up the slope toward them, the boy trailing her and aping her cries with shrill shouts.  The"]]]
