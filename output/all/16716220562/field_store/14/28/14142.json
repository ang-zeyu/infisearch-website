Mac was interested to notice through the dome of the officers' dining saloon, which projected through the bridge deck, that a German naval officer prisoner drank the King's health along with the rest of the mess.  Several days dragged drowsily by in sweet procession.  Mac was doing the afternoon watch.  Between noon and one o'clock the signallers were usually fairly busy while latitudes and longitudes were hoisted and the staff disposed of the last of the morning's work.  Then peace reigned for three hours, while the fleet dozed through the hot afternoon, and Mac could see through his glasses lazy figures stretched in deck-chairs beneath shady awnings.  He leaned over the starboard light, neglected his lookout, and gazed far down at the swishing water which ran the ship's length at a lazy ten knots.  The fathomless blue of the midday sea, with the white marblings from the bow wave, never ceased to draw Mac's gaze.  Down in its depths the red jelly-fish went sailing past, and from there, too, came the terrified flying-fish, which went winging away out to the beam, glittering in the bright sun. The rumbling of the ship's engines filled the air with a sleepy monotone; and Mac was hard put to keep awake.  From his cool perch he looked down on snowy awnings stretching fore and aft, though here and there through openings he caught glimpses of mens' bare bodies as they lay sleeping on deck, and of horses' heads hanging low with half-closed eyes.  The other signaller on duty was buried behind the flag-locker, probably intending that it should be thought that he was busy putting away the flags used in the last hoists, though that might have been finished a full hour ago.  The officer of the watch took an occasional turn the length of the bridge, and now and then rang down to the engine-room for one more or one less revolution per minute; while the quartermaster periodically put the wheel a few spokes this way or that to keep the ship in station with the vessel ahead.  Mac had certainly drifted away to places other than the bridge of a ship in the Indian Ocean, when he was speedily brought back to the present by a vigorous poke in his ribs.  He turned hurriedly; and the officer of the watch with perfect clearness conveyed to him by a jerk of his thumb, and a quizzical expression, that the flagship was making a general signal.  Mac shoved up the answering pennant, roused the other drowsy signaller, and elicited the information that the New Zealand ships would anchor 1 1/2 miles S.S.E. of Ras Marshag at 17.50.  Mac looked ahead and saw the jagged blue outline of land above the horizon.  Towards four o'clock the heads awoke from their siestas, and the signallers were kept busy.  The forms on the decks below also commenced to stir, whistles sounded, and soon hoses and brooms were busy cleaning the horse-boxes.  Half-naked men were at work with brushes and combs in the narrow spaces between the animals; and others poured cooling streams of water about their legs.  Feeding time came with an excited whinnying, snorting and trampling, while the men stood along the deck in front with a long line of feed boxes.  Then there was a whistle and a chorus of neighing.  The men went forward and attached the boxes.  Comparative silence followed, while the horses in deep content poked their muzzles down into the feed and blew showers of chaff into the air.  For a time the satisfied munching went on quietly; but at length the horses which had finished first stamped their feet, and tugged at their halter chains, in attempts to get at their neighbours' feeds.  Mac finished his watch, and went below for a salt shower, and after that the evening meal, which was never much to boast about.  He went up to the bridge again to investigate Aden from the best standpoint.  The evening lights were colouring splendidly the rocky heights of the range above the port.  The anchored fleet spread far across the bay, the _Tahiti_ being close to the desert shore several miles from the port. It was an evening of perfect calm.  The last glow faded from the topmost pinnacles, the stars came out with the brightness of the desert, Morse signals winked from the mastheads, and the mooring lights cast reflections on the calm water.  For a time Mac joined a four for a rubber or so in the cool night air, and then, collecting his blankets from below, went away forward to sleep on top of the horse-boxes with nothing but stars overhead.  In the early morning, before the fresh charm of the desert dawn had fled before the tropic day, the fleet weighed anchor, and, with a great deal of signalling and manoeuvring, took steaming station again.  Soon after midday Perim lay on the starboard, its desolate sands shimmering in the noon sun, shortly to disappear astern, veiled by the trailing smoke.  It took the fleet five days to steam the length of the Red Sea; good days too, with cooling northerly breezes to air the stuffy horse decks, though the chill nights made the signallers shiver on watch. But, the day before they were due at Suez, the whole peaceful running of things was upset by wild rumours, and then by definite fact.  In late weeks it had been generally accepted by every one that England would be the destination of the Expeditionary Force, and they had settled comfortably to that point of view, and to the prospect of having nothing to worry them for three or four more weeks.  Turkey, however, had declared war; and now, they heard, they were disembarking immediately in Egypt.  The troops were undecided whether or not to be pleased.  Most of them had hoped to see the Old Country and their relatives there.  Mac did not care a straw, for he saw no delights in an English winter camp, and Egypt was said to be a fine interesting country.  Every one set about telling wild tales of Egypt; and proceeded to walk more rapidly about the ship, collecting and putting in order shore-going clothes--so that the quiet shipboard life was at an end.  In the voyaging days of 1914 the New Zealand troops regarded their chances of actually joining in the campaign as being regrettably small. It was clear, they thought in their out-of-the-world way, that the enemy would be speedily overrun; that the New Zealand troops were only untrained, untried colonials; that they could therefore expect no more than garrison duty; and that every available Imperial soldier would be thrown into the field before the colonial troops were drawn upon. Consequently there was an uneasy feeling abroad that, should they once land in Egypt, they would be left there for the duration of the war.  The New Zealand transports, which had taken the lead, cast anchor in Suez bay just as the sun was rising over the desert; and Mac gazed appreciatively at the sweeping bay, the palms, the flat-topped houses, and the open desert, clear cut in the early light.  Suez was not adapted for the disembarkation of large numbers of men and horses, and Alexandria was the only harbour with sufficient accommodation.  In the early afternoon the _Tahiti_ entered the Canal; and there were no dull moments for the next twelve hours.  They were surprised to find, at frequent intervals along the Canal bank, strongly wired entrenchments occupied by Indian troops, with whom they exchanged cheers as they passed.  At night a moon lit the silent desert in greater beauty; and Mac slept not a wink as the ship slid quietly past mile after mile of the queer waterway.  At three in the morning, with a clatter of chains and a good deal of shouting, they moored in Port Said harbour.  Again there was a day full of interest--bartering with natives, watching the coolies coaling, cheering Australian transports as they entered the basin, and examining the mixture of shipping in the port.     CHAPTER V  ASHORE AGAIN  Late in the same afternoon the New Zealand ships put to sea, under orders to steam individually at slow speed to meet off Alexandria at dawn.  There was not a great deal of settled sleep that night, for all men were busy packing kit-bags and putting in order shore-going clothes.  The days of decks, bare feet and semi-nakedness were at an end, and to-morrow would start again the life of boots and puttees, saddles and tents.  Men stood in small groups along the deck, shown only by the embers of pipes and the occasional glow of a match.  They watched the low line of the Egyptian shore, deep black against a sky which seemed vaster than usual and more brilliant with stars, and were exhilarated by the knowledge that they would disembark to-morrow in that queer old country.  The mess room was filled for a while with a cheery, laughing crowd to hear words of warning from an old soldier concerning the joys and sorrows of Cairo and a few general instructions on life in Egypt.  The ships stood in towards the entrance to the port just as the rising sun gilded the houses and minarets of Alexandria.  Soon the gangway was dropped for a pilot to come abroad, and shortly with much chattering that gentleman appeared on the bridge.  The Captain gazed on the apparition with horror, and the signallers, in security behind the flag locket, were convulsed with mirth.  A pale, underfed little Hebrew, not, apparently, the cleanest specimen of its race, clad in something like a dressing-gown and a pair of bath slippers, and topped off by a red tarboosh tilted well back and continuing the contour of its nose, it looked about as capable of piloting a ship as a waste-paper-basket. It chattered away cheerfully to every one on the bridge in a strange lingo, waved its hands alternately here, there and everywhere, and faced in all directions in the attitudes of ancient mural figures.  It was serenely unheeding of the business in hand, of the fact that four ships, occupying the narrow fairway ahead, were slowing down, and that three others were coming rapidly up behind,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26548"],["title","The Tale of a Trooper (#6)"],["body","trouble.  The skipper recovered from his astonishment.  \"Which way?\" he said, interrupting a friendly jabber to the third officer.  The figure raised its eyebrows, bared its rabbit teeth and, wildly waving its arms, poured a stream of unintelligible jargon in the skipper's direction.  \"Shall I stop her?\" yelled the skipper.  A wide, inclusive sweep of the arms was the only reply and the jabbering increased.  \"To starboard--or port?\" inquired the Captain, indicating each with his arm.  To both queries the figure energetically nodded assent.  The Captain flushed with anger.  The figure looked crest-fallen.  Meanwhile the bows were getting dangerously near the stern of the vessel ahead, while the ship astern was overlapping the port quarter. Moles threatened destruction on either beam, and quantities of small Greek sailing vessels were in imminent danger.  The Captain seized the little fellow by the shoulder and shook him.  \"Damn it, man!\" he shouted.  \"What in hell----!\"  The woebegone figure spread his hands in innocent protestation.  Then the light of a bright idea suffused his countenance.  He went to one side and craned over the rail, gazing first forward and then aft.  He did the same on the other side.  He repeated the action on both sides. Then a wild yell announced a discovery, and, following his gaze, Mac saw a launch which had appeared from behind one of the vessels ahead. Shrill shrieks from the figure at length drew its attention and a fortissimo of jabbering and arm-waving welcomed its nearer approach.  A more business-like person came aboard, who took the vessel in charge, the while its late pilot muttered unhappily in the background.  The rest of the manoeuvres went smoothly enough.  The only particular incident which amused Mac was watching a trio of Greek sailors tormenting a terrified Egyptian by holding him by the legs upside down over a ship's side, as if intending to drop him into the water.  It was not Mac's luck to disembark immediately on berthing, for his squadron were detailed to clean up the ship after all the men and horses had gone ashore.  They stripped themselves of their shore kit, and with hoses and brooms scrubbed decks for hour after hour.  In the afternoon Mac did a watch by himself on the bridge for any signals which might be sent.  Few came, and it was a sad and lonely bridge deserted after what seemed years at sea.  The evening brought unloading of the holds and by the light of great arc lamps stores of all sorts were piled high.  It was past midnight before the winches were silent.  Before four in the morning the few remaining troops were again astir, and by daybreak were all on the quay with their equipment.  The ship on which were the squadron's horses lay about two miles away, and they set out for her.  Mac was very sick, probably for unwisely sampling Turkish delight sold him yesterday by an Egyptian at the ship's side. Unaccustomed boots, a cobbled street and a heavy load did not add to the pleasures of the march.  They reached the other quay, and shivered for two hours in the chilly Mediterranean breeze until they were sent on board to unload stores.  Hard work set Mac to rights, and the piles of oats, chaff and hay grew steadily as the forenoon advanced.  They scratched up a meal in the depths of the ship, worked again, and then, in the middle of the afternoon, unshipped the horses.  One by one they led them up the gangways from the holds, and then, sliding and slipping on their weak legs, down a steep gangway to the low quay.  Once on firm ground, the horses threw up their heels, bucked and neighed in sheer delight.  But they overestimated their strength and came sprawling to earth and soon, for lack of breath, quieted down.  The squadron led its horses to a piece of waste sandy ground, removed their covers, and let them roll to their hearts' content.  They were in excellent condition after so long a voyage in warm seas, and Mac was grateful to the fellows who had looked after them.  His had been a pleasure voyage, but they had had no such luck.  From 5 a.m. till 9 p.m. it had been groom, clean decks, feed, water and exercise; and then, more often than not, it was horse-picket for part of the night.  The temperature of the horse-holes had for a long space never fallen below 110° F.; and five horses had been each man's charge.        *      *      *      *      *  \"Where are we going, d'you know, Bill?\" asked Mac.  \"Sure I don't know.  Some fellers say it's Cairo.  Others say it's a place called Zeitoun, and God only knows where that is.  Anyhow I hope it's Cairo.  Cobber of mine, who'd bin there, told me it was just a bit of all right.  Said it was a reg'lar hot shop.\"  \"No such luck, Bill,\" chipped in Jock.  \"You don't find the heads sending us anywhere decent like that.  Afraid of givin' us too good a time.\"  \"Yes.  And the dear old wowser boys at home in N.Z. would get up on their hind legs an' say, 'Is it right that our dear boys should be let go free in such a dreadful city, what with the awful drink, and gamblin' and worse than that, dear brethren.  No, we will petition the Minister of Defence to stop the dwedful catastrophe, to put the pubs outer bounds, an' ter never have any wet canteens in the camps.  Oh, our poor innocent boys!'\"  \"Ha!  Ha!  Ha!\" laughed Mac.  \"Anyway, it'll be a bit of a change. Wonder how long we'll be here?\"  \"Gawd only knows,\" answered Bill.  \"Mare looks well, Mac.  Legs a bit puffed, that's all.\"  They wandered off in due course to water and feed.  They rugged the horses, and at six o'clock entrained them, packing them tightly in the trucks.  The men had a bit of a meal then themselves, bought oranges from the natives, and settled down in third-class carriages of a filthy and uncomfortable kind.  Each horse truck bore a chalked date of when it had last been disinfected, but the carriages had no such reassuring legend.  As darkness fell, the train started with a series of crashes, and clanked unpromisingly away into the gloom.  It was a weary journey, and bitterly cold.  Mac could not sleep and watched, by the silver light of the waning moon, a not displeasing vista of palm trees, crops, houses and villages which went jogging steadily by.  Twice they crossed great rivers, and the whole carriage bestirred itself to see its first of what might be the Nile.  Then there were many railway junctions and tall houses and a tram-car or two, and again country.  At midnight the train jolted finally to a halt.  They led their horses out into a sandy square surrounded by houses and palm-trees.  Mac noticed that they were wandering unaware over what apparently were Nile mud bricks set out to dry in the sun.  Some poor native, he thought, would curse the war next day.  The column of tired horses and tired men wandered vaguely off to find the camp, barracks or what-not which should prove to be their destination.  No one knew who it was, where it was or what it was, and there was no guide.  They took a turning to the right, passed a convent, took other turnings and found nothing but shuttered houses among trees peacefully asleep in the moonlight.  There was no living thing, and the hollow echo of their own clatter was the only sound. They were all more or less asleep, and just wandered along, not caring a hang whether they walked or halted, or stood on their heads.  In due course they passed the same old convent, which, in Mac's sleepy mind, did not seem to be quite the right thing to be doing, though he did not mind much.  Eventually the column encountered a high iron railing barring its path--a great iron railing stretching for miles and inside it a camp.  They found troughs and watered the horses, and picketed them along the railings.  There was some one in the camp, and the squadron was told to stay by its horses till morning.  It was colder than Mac had ever felt it.  A great stillness held everything, and the moon lit the sleeping camp with a clear soft light. But it was cold!  After the warm tropic weeks, the keen Egyptian winter night went right to the marrow.  Mac tried to bury himself in the sand by scooping a long hole, lying in it and shovelling the sand back over him.  It was not a success, and there was nothing to do but pace up and down in a vain endeavour to get warm.  Hours passed in a dreamy fashion until at length Mac's attention was drawn by signs of activity in the camp.  He went there and found some cooks round their dixies and iron rails in the open just starting a fire.  He immediately made friends, and speedily assisted the fire to become a respectable blaze.  Others came from the squadron and soon the cooks were hospitably handing out mugs of tea and bread for toast.  It was the camp of the Lancashire Artillery, Mac learned, who had arrived from England a month since. The sergeant-cook soon joined the great-coated circle round the fire.  \"Yus,\" he said, with the confidence of a host to whom deference should be paid, \"Yus.  Hi 'eard as 'ow them Noo Zealanders wus comin', an' I says ter meself as 'ow it 'ud be another o' these 'ere lingos we'd 'av ter try an' parley.  An' I think's as 'ow that don't suit us chaps zactly.  But the fust of you fellers I sees this mornin' I says ter 'im like, 'Goo' mornin,' maate!'  An' 'e says ter me 'Goo' mornin,' maate,' jest the same as meself!  We thought as 'ow you'd talk some funny lingo, I tell yer I did.  But yuse jest speak same's us, an' I wus glad.\"  Daylight revealed a scene as inspiring to an untravelled New Zealander as America to Columbus.  Close at hand stood an oriental city of splendid architecture, the early light touching with romance its minarets and pillared galleries.  Spread before him, and stretching away into the distance until lost in a soft blue mistiness, lay Cairo, its forest of minarets, its domes and its square-topped houses. Beyond, unmistakable in the blue distance, were the old familiar outlines of the great pyramids.  Behind him, the great yellow desert"]]]
