LINCOLN, Volume Six, 1862-1863     1862     RECOMMENDATION OF NAVAL OFFICERS  MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.  WASHINGTON, D.C., May 14, 1862.  TO SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  The third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the Navy,\" approved 21st of December, 1861, provides:  \"That the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired list of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such officers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to be thus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation of the President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks of Congress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy, be restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\"  In conformity with this law, Captain David G. Farragut was nominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of the squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union by his successful operations on the lower Mississippi and capture of New Orleans.  Believing that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond with the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as an example, I cordially recommend that Captain D. G. Farragut receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the capture since 21st December, 1861, of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, city of New Orleans, and the destruction of various rebel gunboats, rams, etc.....     TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  I submit herewith a list of naval officers who commanded vessels engaged in the recent brilliant operations of the squadron commanded by Flag-officer Farragut which led to the capture of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, city of New Orleans, and the destruction of rebel gunboats, rams, etc., in April 1862. For their services and gallantry on those occasions I cordially recommend that they should, by name, receive a vote of thanks of Congress:  LIST:       Captain Theodorus Bailey.      Captain Henry W. Morris.      Captain Thomas T. Craven.      Commander Henry H. Bell.      Commander Samuel Phillips Lee.      Commander Samuel Swartwout.      Commander Melancton Smith.

MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Cumberland, Virginia:  Your long despatch of yesterday is just received. I will answer more fully soon. Will say now that all your despatches to the Secretary of War have been promptly shown to me. Have done and shall do all I could and can to sustain you. Hoped that the opening of James River and putting Wool and Burnside in communication, with an open road to Richmond, or to you, had effected something in that direction. I am still unwilling to take all our force off the direct line between Richmond and here.   A. LINCOLN.     SPEECH TO THE 12TH INDIANA REGIMENT, MAY [15?] 1862  SOLDIERS, OF THE TWELFTH INDIANA REGIMENT:  It has not been customary heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, for me to say something to every regiment passing in review. It occurs too frequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions. As you have paid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I should say a word or two in reply. Your colonel has thought fit, on his own account and in your name, to say that you are satisfied with the manner in which I have performed my part in the difficulties which have surrounded the nation. For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful, but on the other hand I assure you that the nation is more indebted to you, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in support of free government and free institutions.  For the part which you and the brave army of which you are a part have, under Providence, performed in this great struggle, I tender more thanks especially to this regiment, which has been the subject of good report. The thanks of the nation will follow you, and may God's blessing rest upon you now and forever. I hope that upon your return to your homes you will find your friends and loved ones well and happy. I bid you farewell.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.  WASHINGTON, May 16, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL:  What is the strength of your force now actually with you?   A. LINCOLN.     MEMORANDUM OF PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS OF ABOVE DATE  TO GENERAL McDOWELL, AND GENERAL MEIGS'S INDORSEMENT THEREON.  May 17, 1862. You will retain the separate command of the forces taken with you; but while co-operating with General McClellan you will obey his orders, except that you are to judge, and are not to allow your force to be disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this capital which may be possible from that distance.  [Indorsement.]  TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR:  The President having shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to direct a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case, and that to give instructions to General McClellan to this same end and furnish General McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object desired by the President. He desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to General McClellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary.  Respectfully, M. C. M.     MILITARY EMANCIPATION  INDORSEMENT RELATING TO GENERAL DAVID HUNTER'S ORDER OF MILITARY EMANCIPATION,  MAY 17, 1862  No commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without consulting me.   A. LINCOLN.     FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 18, 1862.  GENERAL: Your despatch to the President, asking reinforcements, has been received and carefully considered.  The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is believed that, even if this were prudent, it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order, therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route. He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by extending your right-wing to the north of Richmond.  It is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the Pamunkey River.  In any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's forces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon General McDowell. He will move with between thirty-five and forty thousand men.  A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation.  At your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before or after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover this city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation. When General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers to be prepared to supply him by that route.  The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the Department of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward.  By order of the President:  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.  MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Commanding Army of the Potomac, before Richmond.     PROCLAMATION REVOKING GENERAL HUNTER'S ORDER OF MILITARY EMANCIPATION,  MAY 19, 1862.  BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  A Proclamation  Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a proclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words and figures following, to wit:  (General Orders No. 11) HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HILTON HEAD, PORT ROYAL, S. C., May 9, 1862.  \"The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the military department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it became a military necessity to declare martial law. This was accordingly done"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2658"],["title","The Papers and Writings of Abraham Lincoln — Volume 6: 1862-1863 (#1)"],["body","the 25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible. The persons in these three States: Georgia Florida, and South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore declared forever free.  \"By command of Major-General D. Hunter: \"(Official.)ED. W. SMITH, \"Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.\"  And whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding: therefore,  I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare that the Government of the United States, had no knowledge, information, or belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a proclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document is genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the Government of the United States to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void so far as respects such a declaration.  I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed power, are questions which under my responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field.  These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps.  On the sixth day of March last, by special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be substantially as follows:  Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the inconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system.  The resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people most immediately interested in the subject-matter. To the people of those States I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue--I beseech you to make arguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs of the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics. This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you not embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.  In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.  Done at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-sixth.   A. LINCOLN.  By the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. E. McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 21, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  I have just been waited on by a large committee who present a petition signed by twenty-three senators and eighty-four representatives asking me to restore General Hamilton to his division. I wish to do this, and yet I do not wish to be understood as rebuking you. Please answer at once.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON CITY, May 22, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:  Your long despatch of yesterday just received. You will have just such control of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate. McDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats, if the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be resisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be confronting you at Richmond. By land he can reach you in five days after starting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks, judging by past experience. Franklin's single division did not reach you in ten days after I ordered it.   A. LINCOLN,  President United States.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.  WASHINGTON, May 24, 1862. 4 PM.  MAJOR-GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN:  In consequence of General Banks's critical position, I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell's movements to join you. The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw General Fremont's force and part of General McDowell's in their rear.   A. LINCOLN, President.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN  WASHINGTON May 24, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:  I left General McDowell's camp at dark last evening. Shields's command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the 26th. We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one regiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some peril.  The enemy's forces under General Anderson now opposing General McDowell's advance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to Richmond.  If, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000 men; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not do this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy bridges? McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move Monday morning. I wish you to move cautiously and safely.  You will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL RUFUS SAXTON.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May, 24 1862. 2 P.M.  GENERAL SAXTON:  Geary reports Jackson with 20,000 moving from Ashby's Gap by the Little River turnpike, through Aldie, toward Centreville. This he says is reliable. He is also informed of large forces south of him. We know a force of some 15,000 broke up Saturday night from in front of Fredericksburg and went we know not where. Please inform us, if possible, what has become of the force which pursued Banks yesterday; also any other information you have.   A. LINCOLN     TELEGRAM TO COLONEL D. S. MILES.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 1.30 P.M.  COLONEL MILES, Harper's Ferry, Virginia  Could you not send scouts from Winchester who would tell whether enemy are north of Banks, moving on Winchester? What is the latest you have?   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 4 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin:  You are authorized to purchase the 400 horses, or take them wherever or however you can get them. The exposed condition of General Banks makes his immediate relief a point of paramount importance. You are therefore directed by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and operate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks. This movement must be made immediately. You will acknowledge the receipt of this order, and specify the hour it is received by you.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 7.15 P.M.  MAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin, Virginia:  Many thanks for the promptness with which you have answered that you will execute the order. Much--perhaps all--depends upon the celerity with which you can execute it. Put the utmost speed into it. Do not lose a minute.   A. LINCOLN.     TELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, near Corinth, Mississippi:  Several despatches from Assistant Secretary Scott and one from Governor Morton asking reinforcements for you have been received. I beg you to be assured we do the best we can. I mean to cast no blame where I tell you each of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own. Under this pressure We thinned the line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was broken with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of which he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured. We need men to repair this breach, and have them not at hand. My dear General, I feel justified to rely very much on you. I believe you and the brave officers and men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth.   A. LINCOLN.    TELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL  WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Fredricksburg:  General Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from Franklin on Harrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson's and Ewell's forces. You are instructed, laying aside for the present the movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the Shenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of the Manassas Gap railroad. Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want of supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is believed that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish this object alone. The information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you"]]]
