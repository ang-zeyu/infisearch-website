None of them knew what lay ahead--what dangers awaited them--or what     rewards. But they did not hesitate because the first question asked     them had been: \"Are you a brave man?\"_     CHAPTER I  _Opportunity_   From where Dick Barrow sat, hundreds of men were visible, occupying benches in every manner of position. Some stretched at full length, sleeping in the morning sun after a night in the park. Others sat with heads hanging; thinking thoughts of their own.  Depression or recession, it meant the same to all of them. Some didn't care, but others tried to find any kind of work that would fill their stomachs with food.  For three days Dick hadn't eaten a good meal, and felt almost as low as the derelicts whom he had for companions. He would have enjoyed a smoke, but turned away as two men dove for a cigarette-butt; discarded by a passerby.  Anyone who could afford to buy a newspaper was an aristocrat, and Dick watched until he saw one discarded. For three days he had been reading them secondhand, but the only jobs were too far to walk and apply for.  His eyes stopped at one item in the column and a puzzled frown slowly puckered his forehead.      _Wanted: An Engineer. Young man with love for electrical and     mechanical work, who is not afraid of isolation. Have some knowledge     of engineering, but general experience more desirable than     specialized training. Must be willing to leave country, never to     return; for which he will be well remunerated. Have no close family     ties, and willing to submit to certain amount of danger. Will be     isolated with few members of own race, but will have great     opportunity to develop mastery of huge machines. Come prepared to     leave for post immediately, without preparation. Every want will be     taken care of by employers. This position is for lifetime, without     opportunity of turning back after having accepted responsibility.     GREAT OPPORTUNITY! Room 36, 18 W. Morgan Ave., City._         *       *       *       *       *  For a long time Dick Barrow gazed at the ad, mentally comparing his own qualifications for the position--and they _seemed_ to fit! He was not a graduate engineer, being forced to quit school after two years of study. Three years later his father died, then Dick lost the job that had kept them eating regularly. His love of mechanics remained insatiable, and he constantly hoped for work which would allow him to use his knowledge and ability.  He had no relations, and the _only_ girl had forgotten him, when he left school. He heard that she married a classmate!  Dick was twenty-seven. Five years had slipped by since he quit school, and he couldn't remember where they had gone. It was only six months after his father died that he lost his last regular job. He tried selling and was a failure. He had been carpenter's helper, plumber's helper, porter, counter-man and busboy as the months passed, but nothing steady. For the past two months he had been hunting for work, while his few dollars dwindled to where he no longer had room rent. Then it was the park.  His feet were sore and blistered from holes in his shoes, and he limped with every step. It took so long to reach the address that there was little chance of finding the job still open. It was not the first time he had missed--for the same reason.         *       *       *       *       *  He found that 18 Morgan Avenue was a dreary structure, appearing as if it had been standing twenty years too long. The wooden stairs creaked as he rested his weight on first one sore foot and then the other. Room 36 was at the top of the five-story building, and it seemed ages before he reached the doorway. The only sign of furnishing in the room was a hard bench, occupied by three men. Dick had to stand while his feet tortured him, but it was hopeful to see men waiting--_the job wasn't filled_!  Suddenly a door at the opposite side of the room jerked open and a man dashed through.  \"Get out of here! The man's _insane_!\"  Two of the men followed, but the man who remained on the bench glanced at Dick, grinned, shrugged his shoulders and entered the door. A moment later his booming voice could be heard through the thin partition, although his words were not clear.  An hour passed while Dick waited. When the man came out, with a smile on his face, he wished Dick luck and headed for the stairway.  Barrow felt a queer sensation as he stepped through the inner doorway. A man faced him in a huge leather chair across the room. At least Dick thought he was a man. Grotesque in every way, his body was small while his head was twice as large as normal. He was light complexioned, with almost white hair thinly covering the top of his enormous head. His features were finely cut, with large aquiline nose. He was not repulsive, and smiled in welcome as Dick hesitated at the threshold. When he spoke his tone was soft and musical.  \"Welcome, stranger. You have come in answer to my advertisement and I will explain without wasting time. But first tell me about yourself.\"  Going over his complete life history, including the two years in college, Dick came to the lean years when his father died. He hesitated slightly not proud of this period.  \"Go on, Mr. Barrow. It is not important to have been a success in business, and I will not consider that in your applications. It isn't what you _have_ done, but what you _want_ to do, that interests me.\"  He spoke with a strange accent, that Dick didn't recognize. But he was pleasant and made it easy to talk.  When Barrow finished, by relating the finding of the newspaper and the long walk to the office, the queer man was smiling.  \"I like your frankness and will tell you about the position, although I can't reveal the location of your work. It is not on any map, and you will work among a race such as myself, with no opportunity of leaving after reaching the destination.  \"You will be given every comfort and advantage among my people, and be required to work hard in return. There are several machines out of commission which must be repaired and put to work again. After a few months your work will be easier, although you must constantly watch all machinery to see that it is in perfect condition, and does not stop work for even a moment.  \"My people use mechanics of greater size and development than anything you have ever seen, and our lives depend on its perfect operation. In order to accept this position you must be married. Your wife must come with you, and be willing to accept the same living conditions which are offered to you.         *       *       *       *       *  \"The man who left this office as you entered has a fiancee and has gone to talk it over with her. In your instance _I must select your wife_! You will be the leader of the workmen whom I take back. There will be only a few people such as yourself, and you can never again see others of your race.  \"You will have power and wealth among my people, and every type of entertainment that you desire. But remember that you leave your race forever, with _no possibility_ of return! If you accept my offer you must trust entirely in what I say about the future.\"  When the man finished speaking Dick was quiet for a long time. Everything seemed so unreal, so different from what he had expected. He must be willing to leave everything that he had always known--to enter an existence which he didn't understand--without chance of return! Yet he believed every word this man spoke, impossible as it seemed. But _marriage_ ... with a girl he had never _seen_!  The man spoke again. \"You hesitate about marrying; I can see it in your eyes. But remember that _she_ must accept without knowing you, and is taking just as great a chance. This I can say. She will be brilliant, and I _could not_ trust you to pick out a brilliant woman for your wife. Love would come first in your eyes. Other things would seem unimportant. I know that you and the girl I select are apt to fall in love, as I shall choose a girl suitable to your temperament.\"  Dick answered slowly, \"I don't know what to say. I will have to live with her all of my life, and if we are not happy anything you could offer would mean nothing.\"  The smile spread over the strange man's face again. \"I wouldn't worry too much. I believe you could stand a greater chance of happiness if _I_ do the choosing than if you do it yourself as I can see more of the future. If you are mutually likable and willing to understand each other; if you are mentally on the same level, there is little chance of _not_ falling in love. My race mates in this way, and it works out better than your haphazard mating.\"  When he realized that Dick still hesitated, he was slightly upset. Then reaching into a leather bag, hung from a strap around his neck, he stretched forth a handful of bills.  \"Go and get yourself a good meal. It is now morning. When two more mornings have passed come again. Don't be afraid to use the money for anything that you desire. This does not mean that I expect you to accept the offer, but it will allow you to think it over carefully--without thinking of your _stomach_. Buy clothes, a room to sleep in, anything else that you want. Be comfortable and do not worry about what you spend. If you refuse my terms, I will be disappointed, but will not expect to be repaid.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As Dick reached the street he shook his head. It all seemed so fantastic. But the money in his hand was real money--and there was a lot of it! Suddenly he realized that people were staring at the handful of bills, and he hurriedly stuffed them in a pocket. When he was alone for a moment he stepped into "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26941"],["title","Wantedâ€”7 Fearless Engineers! (#1)"],["body","vacant doorway to count it.  There were 14 twenties, 10 fifties, and three ten dollar bills in the lot. Twenty-seven bills in all, representing eight hundred and ten dollars. Folding the money carefully and placing it in a safe pocket, he noticed a sign across the street. \"SHOES,\" it said. He glanced at his own, then limped slowly across when the traffic lights changed. For a moment he looked in the window, then stepped inside.  While the shoe clerk was busy he carefully slipped a twenty from the other bills. It would seem strange if he had too much money with his feet in such shape.  The next stop was a restaurant. Then followed a trip to a clothing store--and he left his old suit behind. With new clothes, shoes, and a meal beneath his belt, he began to think the offer of the stranger was far from fantastic. What if he did have to marry a strange girl? At least they would both have comfort and companionship, wherever they went.  Barrow's first appointment was on Tuesday morning, and Friday found him climbing the same stairs. He watched the papers but there had been no repetition of the advertisement. Evidently the strange man had all the applicants he wanted.  The outer office was empty, but when he opened the inner door, the queer man was smiling just as Dick remembered him.  \"Come in, Mr. Barrow. I'm glad to see you. I was surprised to hear of your use of the money, but was pleased rather than disappointed. You did well.\"  For a moment Dick was taken back, then he smiled sheepishly. \"I don't know just what to say, Sir, I did so many things. But I didn't know I was being watched.\"  \"Every move you made was watched carefully, and reported to me. I know where you spent every hour since you left here the other morning. I wanted to know how you would act with money enough to do as you pleased for a few days. You acted wisely, and I'm glad that you spent so much of it on men who need it. You bought twenty-two pairs of shoes, thirty-six shirts and forty-five suits of underwear. You also bought cheap suits for nine men and several odd and end accessories as well.  \"Out of the total sum you spent less than one hundred dollars for yourself, and yet you have only forty-two dollars of the sum I handed you. The remainder you used for meals and cheap lodging for the men you have taken care of in the past three days. You have gone through a lot of money since you were here.\"  Dick stammered as he spoke, \"I'm sorry, sir, but I thought--\"  \"You thought _just right_! I _did_ give you the money to use as you pleased and I'm proud of the way you spent it. But I want to know the answer. You must have decided by this time. If the answer is yes, you will bind yourself to a lifetime of work. If it is no, we will say goodbye.\"  Dick's face lighted with a smile. \"The answer is _yes_. I am proud to leave my future in your hands--even to my marriage. I made up my mind to do as you desire, and am prepared to leave any time you are ready. I hope you have hired every one you need and that we will all enjoy our new work.\"  \"You're a brave man, Dick Barrow.\" There was admiration in the voice of the stranger. \"If you remained here I believe you would make your mark in life, but you will have even greater opportunity where you are going. I believe your decision will prove to be a happy one.  \"You must stay at a good hotel. Reasonable if you want, although it is not important. I will send the girl to you within a few days. You will be married as soon as possible after you meet her.  \"She will bring a letter and will do exactly as you say. I will allow time for you to get acquainted before I have further orders. From that time you will obey my orders explicitly and follow every instruction without question. Every member of the party will take orders from you, and _you must give them_!\"  Once more Dick was handed a handful of bills as he prepared to leave, and knew there was even more than the first time. But he would live in constant dread of meeting the girl he was to marry. As he started to open the door, the man spoke again.  \"Use the money as you desire. It will be your last chance of spending any and I want you to enjoy yourself as much as possible during the time remaining. Do what you like for the men in the park or any others you wish to help. If you need more money send a messenger to this room, but don't come yourself. Don't contact me again until my orders require it. Have a good time.\"  Dick felt that he was living a dream, but a very pleasant one. Just one thought disturbed him. Who the girl would be--and what she would be like?     CHAPTER II  _Out to Sea_   The following morning an advertisement appeared in the papers, under the heading of help wanted: woman. It was the same address on Morgan Avenue. His heart sank! The man was _advertising_ for a wife! Now Barrow _knew_ he was in for a tough streak of luck. He read it carefully.      _Opportunity for young lady. Must be of age, single, brilliant, with     good family background. Higher education not necessary. Must be     willing to travel long distance. Must not be averse to marriage with     brilliant young man; give up all former associations, with no     possibility of return; live life in small community of own race,     with no possibility of communication with former home. Must be     without close family ties, or relationship. Opportunity to live life     of luxury and ease, with amiable group far from present home and     civilization. Young lady who fits qualifications will not regret     applying for position. Honor, love and security will be her reward.     OPPORTUNITY! Room 36, 18 West Morgan Avenue, City._         *       *       *       *       *  While Dick was eating dinner on Tuesday evening, a young lady fell headlong in front of his table. A moment later she was seated in the chair opposite his own. Ten minutes later he was ordering her dinner.  Afterward, as they walked toward a movie, Dick felt as if he was committing a crime. He was supposed to meet his future wife--and instead was entertaining this young lady who had fallen into his life. When he learned that she was staying at the same hotel, they made a date for breakfast the next morning.  Dolores Dunbar was good company, and seemed willing to spend most of her time in Dick's company. He learned that she was as friendless as himself, and wondered why they couldn't have met before he made the strange bargain. But as the third day drew to a close she appeared apprehensive.  When she kept glancing around, as if expecting someone, Dick became curious, and felt rather hurt to think she was looking for someone else. Finally she spoke.  \"I'm sorry, Dick, that I've made use of you the way I have, but I was ordered to do it. You see, my employer told me to meet you and spend every possible moment in your company. He also said that I would become acquainted with someone through you, and that you would know who he was, when I said I came from the large-headed man on Morgan Avenue--with a letter.\"  For a moment Dick was stunned. Then he laughed, a sickly, half-hearted laugh. When he found his voice it squeaked.  \"I think we had better go to my room. We have some very private things to say.\"  The queer man had succeeded in their being together for three days before either knew _they_ were the central figures in the drama. Now they felt farther apart than at any moment since they had met, but nervously admitted they had fared better than they expected.         *       *       *       *       *  They were married in the morning, to keep the agreement, but didn't consider it part of the bargain to live as man and wife.  Dick found only one order in the letter, to be at the office at ten o'clock on Tuesday morning. That left five days to enjoy themselves.  In spite of the stiffness between them Dick noticed how the light caught in Dolores' dark hair, and how her brown eyes sparkled at each new sight. Her head reached just above his shoulder, and he had never danced with a better partner. She enjoyed his company, and admitted to herself that he was a perfect gentleman.  During the five days they saw every good show, and visited every popular night club. Things they had always wanted to do were packed into the short time to themselves. Dick hired a car, and they drove for hours through the country. When Tuesday morning came they were tired, and it was hard to get up in time to keep the appointment.  When they opened the door, the big-headed man laughed at their yawns. \"I see that you've either _been_ enjoying yourselves, or have been _trying_ mighty hard. You can make up your sleep from now on, as it will be a long time before we reach our destination. How do you like each other for permanent companions?\"  Their faces grew crimson. Finally Dick found his voice. \"I'm perfectly satisfied, Sir. I think Dolores is very pretty, and is _very_ good company!\"  He looked the other way to hide his embarrassment, as the girl spoke.  \"I feel the same way. We have enjoyed being together, and perhaps when we are better acquainted the stiffness will disappear. We both feel odd, because we were required to marry!\"  The strange man laughed out loud at this. \"In other words you _might_ have fallen in love, if you had been allowed time to do it. But _having_ to marry creates an entirely different feeling. I believe it will work out well, even though you feel cheated at the moment. But we haven't any time to lose. Everyone is at the dock and we sail in two hours.  \"Here are your instructions, Dick. From now on _you_ give the orders, and I remain in the background. They will all feel more comfortable under the command of one of their own race. Study everything carefully on the way to the dock, then give them as your own orders.\"  Dick had little time for anything except to look through the sheaf of papers. On one sheet was a list of seven couples, with stateroom numbers beside each. His own was on the top, with number three room. This"]]]
