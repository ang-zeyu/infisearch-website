PREFACE   These are mighty days.  We stand at the close of a century of dazzling achievement; a century that gave the world railways, steam navigation, electric telegraphs, telephones, gas and electric light, photography, the phonograph, the X-ray, spectrum analysis, an√¶sthetics, antiseptics, radium, the cinematograph, the automobile, wireless telegraphy, the submarine and the aeroplane!  Yet as that brilliant century closed, the world crashed into a war to preserve that high level of human development from being dragged back to barbarism.  And how the scenes of battle change!  Cities are being smashed and ships are being torpedoed. Thousands of lives go out in a moment. And these tremendous tragedies pass so swiftly that it is risky to write a story round them carrying any touch of prophecy. I, therefore, attempt it, realising that risk. The story is written for the close of the year 1917. Its incidents are built upon the outlook at June, 1915.  It first appeared in an Australian weekly journal, \"Construction,\" in January, 1915, and already some of its early predictions have been realised; as, for instance, the entry of Italy in June, the use of \"thermit\" shells, and the investigation of \"scientific management in Australian work.\"  To many readers, some of the predictions may not pleasantly appeal. But it must be remembered that, being merely predictions, they are not incapable of being made pleasant in the practical sense. In other words, should any threaten to develop truth, to materialise, all efforts can be concentrated in shaping them to the desired end.  Predictions are oftentimes warnings. Many of these are.  The story is written to impress the people, with their great responsibilities in these wonderful days--when a century of incident is crowded into a month, when an hour contains sixty minutes of tremendous possibilities, when each of us should live the minutes, hours, days and weeks with every fibre strained to give the best that is in us to help in the present stupendous struggle for the defence of civilisation.  GEORGE A. TAYLOR. Sydney, Australia, June, 1915.      The map, on pages 6 and 7, shows the lines followed by the German    armies through Belgium and France during August and September, 1914.    The main line of the Allies' attack, through Metz, in August and    September, 1915, culminating in the defeat of Germany (predicted for    the purpose of this story) is also shown.     You can facilitate the early realisation of this prediction by    enlisting NOW.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration:  They often met before and fought. To gain supremacy in sport.

That day I fell into the hands of the German Army. \"Fell,\" in my case, was the correct word, for my monoplane was greeted with a volley of shots from some tree-hidden German troops as I was passing over the north-eastern edge of the Argonne Forest.  I was returning from Saarbruck when I got winged. Bullets whizzed through the 'plane, and one or two impinged on the engine. I tried to turn and fly out of range, but a shot had put the rudder out of action. An attempt to rise and trust to luck was baulked by my engine losing speed. A bullet had opened the water cooler, and down, down the 'plane glided, till a clear space beyond a clump of trees received it rather easily. I let the petrol run out and fired it to put the machine out of use. Then a rifle cracked and a bullet tore a hole through my left side, putting me into the hospital for six weeks.  That forced idleness gave me plenty of time for retrospection.  I lived the previous energetic five months over and over again. I had little time before to think of anything but my job and its best possibilities, but the quietness of the hospital at Aix la Chapelle made the previous period of activity seem a nightmare of incident.  I remember how surprise held me that I should be lying wounded in a German hospital--I, a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps, who for years before the war, had actually been a member of an Australian Peace Society!  Zangwill's couplet had been to me a phrase of force:--     \"To safeguard peace--we must prepare for war.    I know that maxim--it was forged in Hell!\"  I remembered well how I had hung on the lips of Peace Advocate Doctor Starr Jordan during his Australian visits, and how I had wondered at his stories that Krupp's, Vicker's, and other great gun-building concerns were financially operated by political, war-hatching syndicates; that the curse of militarism was throttling human progression, and that the doctrine of \"non-resistance\" was noble and Christianlike, for \"all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.\"  I remembered how in Australia I had grieved that aviation, in which I took a keen interest as a member of the Aerial League, was being fostered for military purposes instead of for that glorious epoch foretold by Tennyson:--  For I dipped into the future far as human eye could see, Saw the vision of the world and all the wonders that would be, Saw the heavens filled with commerce, Argosies of magic sails, Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales.  I remembered I felt that the calm of commerce held far more glories than the storm of war; that there was no nobler philosophy than:--     \"Ye have heard it said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;    but I say ... resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy    right cheek, turn to him the other also. If any man take thy coat,    let him have thy cloke also.\"  Then came the thunderclap of war; and in the lightning flash I saw the folly of the advocacy of peace. I felt that I, like others, had held back preparation for this great war, that had been foreseen by trained minds. I felt that extra graves would have to be dug, because dreamers--like myself--had prated peace instead of helping to make our nation more secure.  \"Non-resistance\" may be holy, but it encourages tyranny and makes easy the way of the wrongdoer. If every man gave his cloak to the thief who stole his coat, there would be no inducement for the robber to lead an honest life. Vice would be more profitable than virtue.  \"Non-resistance\" may be saintly, but it would make it impossible to help the weak or protect the helpless from cruelty and outrage.  All law, all justice, rests on authority and force. A judge could not inflict a penalty unless there were force to carry it out.  Creeds, after all, are tried in the fires of necessity. \"They that take the sword shall perish by the sword.\" Well, the Kaiser had grasped the sword. By whose sword should he perish except by that of the defender?  Christ's teachings are characterised by sanity and strength. He speaks of His angels as ready to fight for Him; He flogged the moneychangers from the temple: He said that no greater love can be shown than by a man's laying down his life for his friend; and the Allies fighting bravely to protect the oppressed, were manifesting to the full this great love. Germany's attack on a weaker nation, which she had signed to protect, called for punishment from other nations who had also pledged their honor.  Unhappy Belgium called to the civilised world to check the German outrages on its territory and people.  My peace doctrines went out like straw before a flame. I was a \"peace-dove\" winged by grim circumstance; and that is how I became a man of war.  [Illustration: HOW HISTORY REPEATED ITSELF.  England to Belgium, in 1870: \"Let us hope they (Germany) will not trouble you, but if they do--\"  (Tenniel, in \"London Punch,\" at the time of the Franco-Prussian War.)]     CHAPTER II.  The First Three Months of War.   I was in England when the war cloud burst, having just completed a course of aviation at the Bristol Flying Grounds; so I volunteered for active service; and, after a month's military training, was appointed a lieutenant in Number 4 Squadron of the R.F.C.  I remember how the first crash of war struck Europe like a smash in the face. How armies were rapidly mobilised! How the British Fleet steamed out into the unknown, and Force became the only guarantee of national safety!  It is hard to write of these things now that many days have passed between, for events followed each other with the swiftness of a mighty avalanche.  How Germany thrilled the universe by throwing at Belgium the greatest army the world had ever seen. An awful wave of 1,250,000 men crashed upon the gate of Liege.  How the great Krupp siege guns slowly crawled up, stood out of range of the Liege forts, and broke them at ease.  How through the battered gate a flood of Uhlans poured to make up for that wasted fortnight, preceded by their Taube aeroplanes spying out the movements of the Belgium army; the German artillery following, and smashing a track through France!  How that fortnight gave France and England the chance to interpose a wall of men and steel, which met the shock of battle at Mons, but was pushed back almost to the gates of Paris.  It was at the battle of Mons that the squadron to which I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27382"],["title","The Sequel (#1)"],["body","attached went into active operation, reconnoitring the battle line on our left flank. It was my first taste of battle, but I do not remember any strange feelings.  I was in that awful shock of forces that stopped the southern progress of the German juggernaut like a chock beneath a wheel, when on September 2 it recoiled back--back to the Marne--back to the Aisne--back almost to the Belgian frontier. Then winter dropped upon it, turning the roads into pools of mud, checking all speed movements necessary to active operations, and the troops dug in like soldier crabs upon a river bank.  [Illustration: \"The Aeroplane had been a ... curiosity.\"--Chapter III.  (The first Aeroplane to fly in Australia.)]  All surprise movements had to be made at night; the dawn finding our aeroplanes out in the frosty air spying out any changes in positions of the day before. A smoke-ball fired as we flew above a new trench gave our artillery the range; then till night fell a rain of shells would batter that new position. In the dark our troops would creep forward, rush that trench, and dawn would find them dozing in their newly won quarters. The war had become a battle of entrenchments.     CHAPTER III.  The Flying Men.   For ages man walked the earth.  To-day he is the only living creature that can travel in the air by other than its own substance.  'Till the Great War the aeroplane was a scientific curiosity. The Battle of the Nations blooded it; and its wonderful utility in speeding the end of the war has proved its right to be recognised as a distinct factor in human movement.  When the war crash came there were two aerial types; the lighter than air type, the dirigible balloon; and the heavier than air machine, the aeroplane. This is how the Powers stood in aerial furnishing when the first shot was fired. Germany and Austria had 25 airships, including 11 Zeppelins, as well as 556 aeroplanes.  England, France, Russia and Belgium had 33 airships and 1019 aeroplanes.  The English dirigibles had not made long flights, and not being very dependable had not received much attention from the military authorities. A non-dependable factor in war is worse than useless. A mistake may be made in tactics, but when ascertained may be retrieved and, perhaps, turned to good account. Non-dependability is fatal, as many a commander would not know how to act, and in war, he who hesitates is lost.  The French had experimented a good deal with the dirigible, but mostly of the non-rigid type, which was a type \"without a backbone\" and was as uncertain, so that its general non-dependability turned French attention to the aeroplane.  The Germans, however, pinned their faith on the balloon, and for long made it a feature for observation purposes, so that when Zeppelin brought out his rigid framework balloon, Germany fancied she saw in it the command of the air.  The Zeppelin, however, had many disabilities over the aeroplane. It had to have its own kennel. It was almost impossible to get it into its shed if the wind was against it. The kennels had, therefore, to be either on wheels or floating. Furthermore, not being able to replenish its gas, a Zeppelin had always to return to its base for supplies. But the gas balloon suited the smug character of the German. Unlike the aviator who threw himself into the air on a bundle of steel rods and rubber, a propeller and a petrol engine, the phlegmatic German took no risks with a balloon. He found, however, that Zeppelins were expensive freaks. They had a habit of catching fire in the air, because the tail created a vacuum and sucked back some escaping gas into the engine where the contact spark ignited it.  One recently alighted in a field and a country bumpkin came over with the crowd to see the fun. He had a pipe in his mouth. He was told to go away. He wouldn't for a while, but he soon left in a hurry. After the explosion they found bits of him and sixty-seven other people!  The Germans pinned their faith to the Zeppelin because it could carry a heavy load of explosives and would be an easy way of damaging an enemy; and it was only a few months before the war that considerable enthusiasm ruled Germany because a Zeppelin had made a record trip from the southern to the northern fringe of Germany, or, as \"Vorwarts\" said, \"as far as from Germany to England and back again.\"  Here, then, was an easy way to fight. Just rise up out of danger and drop bombs.  They tried it at Antwerp.  On 25th August, 1915, a Zeppelin flew over the sleeping city, guided by flash lamps from German spies on roofs. It was a night of terror--a bomb dropped to fall upon the royal palace, missed and injured two women; a bomb aimed for the Antwerp Bank missed and killed a servant; but one fell into a hospital and another into a crowd in the city square. Five people were blown to atoms.  It must have been an awful night, for it is recorded that the city watchman of Antwerp announced: \"12 o'clock and all's hell.\"  On September 2nd (the anniversary of Sedan), the Zeppelin came again to give its stab in the dark, but finding it was recognised, retreated. It did not rise higher to get out of danger of the air guns and put up a fight. The German in the air takes few risks. It is his temperament. Not so with the Frenchman. He is by nature dashing and volatile. The easy-going of the dirigible little appealed to him. The risk, the speed, the adventure of the aeroplane touched his soul, which explained why France had 2032 military aviators, whilst Germany had only 300 qualified military pilots.  The German lacks the dash, nerve, vim and initiative essential to a successful flier. He is moulded as a cog. He is part of a system--out of that he must not move. It has wrecked his initiative, and the sneer of the greatest German in history, Frederick the Great, has to-day grim significance.  \"See those two mules,\" he said satirically to one of his officers, who lacked initiative, \"they have been in fifteen campaigns and--they're still mules.\"  The German training system has taken all the humanity out of the men. They move like machines, either destroying or rolling on to destruction, and they often act with the dumb sense of the machine to pain and suffering.  Lloyd George has very truly put it: \"God made man to his own image, but the German recreated him in the form of a Diesel engine.\"  No one questioned the efficiency of the German machine. The Allies were disputing its right to go on destroying.  [Illustration: \"The New Arm.\"--Chapter IV.]     CHAPTER IV.  The New Arm.   \"It strikes me that these fool commanders don't know what to do with us. We aviators seem to be too new to come into all their stunts. Here we've been flying over eight years, and we're still novel enough to be repeatedly fired on by our own side. Why the beggars in our own battery, when they see an aeroplane overhead in their excitement let fly. They don't bother to notice that the plane of our Bleriot hasn't claw ends like the enemy's Taube. Neither do they note we carry our own distinguishing mark. We're the circus show. We're the 'comic relief' sure.\"  He was about to spit his disgust on an unoffending fly, but quickly changed his mind.  He was a Yank from the U.S.A. Military School at San Diego, and \"hiked over the pond as there was nothing doing.\"  In appearance he was tall and wiry with a thin face and hooked nose that suggested the bird-man. His name on the roll was Walter Edmund Byrne, but his bony appearance won him his nickname--Nap.  We knew nicknames would shock those who stand for the rigid rule of military discipline, but aviators clear the usual wall of demarcation between officers and subordinates. A nod supplants the \"heels together and touch your cap.\"  The Aviation Sections seemed to be communistic concerns, in the air rank being only recognised by achievement. In fact, the new arm was too new to be brought under the iron rule of military etiquette or into most Operation Orders. I told Nap as much.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I guess we're too new. Even when cannon first came into war it was novel enough to fire as often from the wrong end and teach things 'to the man behind the gun'; but I've a bit of dope here that ought to be pasted into every book of your field service regulations, and every officer ought to repeat it before breakfast three times a week. It's the flyers' creed.\"  Fumbling amongst some newspaper scraps in his note book, he produced this bit of verse.     The snake with poisoned fang defends      (And does it really very well).    The cuttle fish an inkcloud sends;      The tortoise has its fort of shell;    The tiger has its teeth and claws;      The rhino has its horns and hide;    The shark has rows of saw-set jaws;      Man--stands alone, the whole world wide    Unarmed and naked! But 'tis plain      For him to fight--God gave a brain!     Far back in this world's early mists      When man began to use his head;    He stopped from fighting with his fists      And gripped a wooden club instead.    But when the rival tribe was slain,      The first tribe then to stand alone    Had once again to work its brain      And made an axe--an axe of stone!    The stone-axe tribe would hold first place;      And ruled the rest where'er it went.    Because then--as to-day--the race      Was first that had best armament.    But human brain expanding more      (Its limits none can circumscribe);    The stone-axe crowd went down before      The more developed bronze-axe tribe.    Then shields came in to quickly show      Their party victors in the strife:    By warding off the vicious blow      And giving warriors longer life.    The tribe's wise men would urge at length,      No doubt as now, for tax on tax,    To keep the \"Two tribe\" fighting strength      With \"super-dreadnought\" shield and axe!     The bow and arrow came and won      For Death came winged from far away.    Then came the cannon and the gun;      And brought us where we are to-day.    And now we"]]]
