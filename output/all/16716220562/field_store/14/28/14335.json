Singing softly, the bronze globe over their heads glowed green. Dave Miller felt a curious lightness. There was a snap in his brain, and Erickson, Major and the laboratory faded from his senses.  Then came an interval when the only sound was the soft sobbing he had been hearing as if in a dream. That, and blackness that enfolded him like soft velvet. Then Miller was opening his eyes, to see the familiar walls of his own kitchen around him!  Someone cried out.  \"Dave! Oh, Dave, dear!\"  It was Helen's voice, and it was Helen who cradled his head in her lap and bent her face close to his.  \"Oh, thank God that you're alive--!\"  \"Helen!\" Miller murmured. \"What--are--you--doing here?\"  \"I couldn't go through with it. I--I just couldn't leave you. I came back and--and I heard the shot and ran in. The doctor should be here. I called him five minutes ago.\"  \"_Five minutes_ ... How long has it been since I shot myself?\"  \"Oh, just six or seven minutes. I called the doctor right away.\"  Miller took a deep breath. Then it _must_ have been a dream. All that--to happen in a few minutes-- It wasn't possible!  \"How--how could I have botched the job?\" he muttered. \"I wasn't drunk enough to miss myself completely.\"  Helen looked at the huge revolver lying in the sink.  \"Oh, that old forty-five of Grandfather's! It hasn't been loaded since the Civil War. I guess the powder got damp or something. It just sort of sputtered instead of exploding properly. Dave, promise me something! You won't ever do anything like this again, if I promise not to nag you?\"  Dave Miller closed his eyes. \"There won't be any need to nag, Helen. Some people take a lot of teaching, but I've had my lesson. I've got ideas about the store which I'd been too lazy to try out. You know, I feel more like fighting right now than I have for years! We'll lick 'em, won't we, honey?\"  Helen buried her face in the hollow of his shoulder and cried softly. Her words were too muffled to be intelligible. But Dave Miller understood what she meant.         *       *       *       *       *  He had thought the whole thing a dream--John Erickson, the \"time impulsor\" and Major. But that night he read an item in the _Evening Courier_ that was to keep him thinking for many days.      POLICE INVESTIGATE DEATH OF SCIENTIST HERE IN LABORATORY      John M. Erickson, director of the Wanamaker Institute, died at his     work last night. Erickson was a beloved and valuable figure in the     world of science, famous for his recently publicized \"time lapse\"     theory.      Two strange circumstances surrounded his death. One was the presence     of a German shepherd dog in the laboratory, its head crushed as if     with a sledgehammer. The other was a chain of small metal objects     stretching from one corner of the room to the other, as if intended     to take the place of wire in a circuit.      Police, however, discount this idea, as there was a roll of wire     only a few feet from the body.   THE END   FOOTNOTES:  [1] Obviously this electric time impulsor is a machine in the nature of an atomic integrator. It \"broadcasts\" great waves of electrons which align all atomic objects in rigid suspension.  That is to say, atomic structures are literally \"frozen.\" Living bodies are similarly affected. It is a widely held belief on the part of many eminent scientists that all matter, broken down into its elementary atomic composition, is electrical in structure.  That being so, there is no reason to suppose why Professor Erickson may not have discovered a time impulsor which, broadcasting electronic impulses, \"froze\" everything within its range.--ED.

In accordance with the decision of Cabinet, a special Committee was appointed on 4th August, 1936,--      (1) To inquire into and report upon the incidence of septic abortion     in New Zealand, including--          (_a_) The incidence among married and single women;          (_b_) Whether the rate of incidence has increased during recent         years;          (_c_) How New Zealand compares with other countries in this         respect;      (2) To inquire into and report upon the underlying causes for the     occurrence of septic abortion in New Zealand, including medical,     economic, social, and any other factors;      (3) To advise as to the best means of combating and preventing the     occurrence of septic abortion in New Zealand;      (4) Generally to make any other observations or recommendations     that appear appropriate to the Committee on the subject.      The following were appointed members of the Committee:--        Dr. D. G. McMillan, M.B., Ch.B. (N.Z.), M.P., Chairman.       Mrs. Janet Fraser.       Dr. Sylvia G. Chapman, M.D., D.G.O. (T.C.D.).       Dr. Thomas F. Corkill, M.D. (Edin.), M.R.C.P. (Edin.), M.C.O.G.       Dr. Tom L. Paget, L.R.C.P. (Lond.), M.R.C.S. (Eng.).     REPORT.   The Hon. the Minister of Health, Wellington.  SIR,--  The Committee set up by Cabinet to inquire into the various aspects of the Problem of Abortion in New Zealand has the honour to submit herewith its report.   HISTORICAL AND INTRODUCTION.  Since the rise in the death-rate from septic abortion in 1930, the Department of Health, the medical profession, and women's organizations and societies have shown great concern regarding the problem. The Obstetrical and Gynæcological Society of the New Zealand Branch of the British Medical Association conveyed to the Prime Minister a resolution passed at the meeting of its executive held in Wellington on 12th March, 1936, wherein it begged the Prime Ministry to consider the advisability of setting up a Committee of inquiry to investigate this matter.  This recommendation having been favourably considered, the following Committee was appointed:--      Dr. D. G. McMillan, M.B., Ch.B. (N.Z.), M.P., Chairman.     Mrs. Janet Fraser.     Dr. Sylvia G. Chapman, M.D. (N.Z.), M.B., Ch.B. (N.Z.).     Dr. T. F. Corkill, M.D. (Edin.), M.R.C.P. (Edin.).     Dr. T. L. Paget, M.R.C.S. (Edin.), L.R.C.P. (Lond.).  Although the immediate purpose of this inquiry was to investigate the problem of septic abortion, it at once became apparent that this matter was so inextricably bound up with the subject of abortion in general that all aspects would require consideration.  The Committee has therefore attempted to make this wider survey and to bring before you as complete a picture as possible.  The Committee has been guided by the Order of Reference, which was as follows:--        I. To inquire into and report upon the incidence of abortion in       New Zealand, including--           (_a_) The incidence among married and single women;           (_b_) Whether the rate of incidence has increased during          recent years;           (_c_) How New Zealand compares with other countries in this          respect.       II. To inquire into and report upon the underlying causes for the      occurrence of abortion in New Zealand, including medical,      economic, social, and any other factors.      III. To advise as to the best means of combating and preventing the     occurrence of abortion in New Zealand.       IV. Generally to make any other observations or recommendations      that appear appropriate to the Committee on the subject.  The preliminary meeting of the Committee was held on the 18th August, and in all sixteen meetings have been held, of which thirteen meetings were held in Wellington, one in Dunedin, one in Auckland, and one in Christchurch.  Evidence was heard from--      British Medical Association.     Church of England.     Crown Solicitor.     Dominion Federation of Women's Institutes.     Dominion Federation of Women's Institutes (Auckland Branch).     Government Statistician.     Lecturer in Medical Jurisprudence, Otago Medical School.     Maternity Protection Society.     Mothers Union.     National Council of Women.     National Council of Women (Canterbury Branch).     New Zealand Labour Party (Auckland Women's Branch).     New Zealand Registered Nurses Association.     New Zealand Registered Nurses Association (Auckland Branch).     New Zealand Registered Nurses Association (Christchurch Branch).     Obstetrical and Gynæcological Society.     Obstetricians and Gynæcologists attached to the Public Hospitals in       Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin.     Pharmaceutical Society.     Police Department.     Presbyterian Church of New Zealand.     Roman Catholic Church.     Royal Society for the Health of Women and Children.     St. John Ambulance Association Nursing Guild.     Women's Division of the Farmers Union.     Women's Division of the Farmers Union (Otago Branch).     Women's Division of the Farmers Union (South Auckland Branch).     Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.     Women's Service Guild.     Working Women's Movement (Auckland Branch).  In addition to these, evidence was heard from twelve other persons.  The Committee would like to express its thanks to the witnesses, many of whom have gone to considerable trouble to collect information and prepare their evidence.     PART I.--INCIDENCE OF ABORTION IN NEW ZEALAND.   All the evidence brought before the Committee indicates that abortion is exceedingly frequent in New Zealand.  It is quite impossible to assess the incidence with complete accuracy, for the reason that a very considerable number of these cases do not come under medical or hospital observation, but some definite indication of the frequency is given by the statistics obtained from various hospitals and practices.  In one urban district, for instance, in which the total live births for a two-year period were 4,000, the number of cases of abortion treated in the public hospital alone was 400.  When to this number were added the cases treated in the various private hospitals, those attended by doctors in the patients' homes, and those not medically attended at all, it was computed that a total of 1,000 abortions was a conservative figure. In other words, roughly twenty pregnancies in every 100 terminated in abortion.  Looked at from a somewhat different angle, figures were presented from one hospital showing that in a group of 568 unselected women of child-bearing age, there were 549 abortions in 2,301 pregnancies, or 23 per hundred.   HOW DO THESE CASES ORIGINATE?  It must be explained that a certain number of cases of abortion occur perfectly innocently as the result of some condition of ill health, or, occasionally, as the result of accident. These _spontaneous_ cases constitute an entirely medical problem.  All other cases are artificially produced or _induced_.  A very small number of these are honourably performed by medical practitioners when the mother's life is seriously endangered.  This procedure is termed \"_Therapeutic induction of abortion_.\"  Certain important questions in relation to therapeutic abortion will be discussed at a later stage in this report.  The remainder of the induced cases are unlawfully produced by the person herself or by some other person--_criminal abortion_.  The Committee received much evidence regarding the methods used in the attempt to procure abortion.  In the first instance it was shown that the use of so-called abortifacient drugs was extensively practised and was usually a first resort.  Little need be said about the matter at this stage except to state that the New Zealand evidence entirely supports the opinions expressed elsewhere that drug-taking is rarely effective.  Those tempted to use these drugs should realize the futility of the practice for the purpose intended and the frequency with which disturbances of health are caused by taking them.  Their only value is as a lucrative source of gain to those people who, knowing their inefficacy, yet exploit the distress of certain women by selling them.  It is perfectly clear that the real menace is the instrumentally produced abortion, either self-induced by the person herself or the result of an illegal operation performed by some outside person.  These abortionists include a few unprincipled doctors and chemists, a few women with varying degrees of nursing training, and a number of unskilled people.  It was a matter of considerable importance for the Committee to attempt to determine first the extent to which spontaneous abortions contribute to the total figures: the prevalence of unlawful abortion could then be better realized.  Here again it was found exceedingly difficult to obtain exact figures, but the evidence suggests that probably less than seven pregnancies in every 100 terminate in spontaneous abortion.
