This aspect of the matter is intimately interwoven with the economic considerations already set forth, but extends far beyond them.  The point of view of what we believe to be a very large body of women is illustrated by the following evidence, which is but one of many similar expressions of opinion heard by the Committee. This witness, speaking on behalf of a group with incomes of £300 to £400 per annum, stated:--      \"On present incomes, not more than two or three children at the     outside can be given educational and economic opportunities. It may     be said that it is quite possible to mitigate to a quite tolerable     degree the strain put upon the parents by the provision of (1)     adequate wages for husbands, and (2) a system of domestic help for     wives. With regard to (1) it is not probable within our lifetime     that everybody will be guaranteed an income adequate to the needs     of a family of, say, three children--'needs' as viewed by educated     parents. The most sympathetic administration would have its hands     full for many a year coping with the problem of helping those     thousands of our people who have been just on or very near the     bread-line. Those worst off hitherto need help first. A man earning     between three and four hundred a year should not claim Government     help to breed children, when there are such numbers of people     living on a much lower wage. But it must be perfectly clear to each     member of the Commission who figures the matter out that a salary     of less than £400 will not enable more than two children to be     given such chance of development as every parent reasonably     desires. It is pertinent to ask here what is the average number of     children in the families of the British middle class--which is     mainly the stratum from which our legislators, rulers, and     magistrates have been drawn. Do such people breed freely?     Self-respecting parents prefer to do without such Government help     as family allowances; but knowing the cost of training a child they     claim the rights first, to decide how many children they will     breed, and, secondly, to live themselves normally satisfied married     lives. Few women, moreover, of average intelligence are to-day     content to be breeding-machines, and their husbands support them in     that attitude. With regard to domestic help, even were this, or     nursing schools, or both, provided by the State, the responsibility     for her children's well-being would be still all-absorbing, at     least during the first four years of each one's growth. Students of     child psychology are insistent that the pre-school period is the     most important in the life of the individual and requires the most     skilful attention. Natural affection is not enough; it must be     wedded to care for the child's mind. Now, willy-nilly, modern life     itself takes such toll of nervous energy that there are few     educated women today who go through all the child-bearing period     and have sufficient nerve force to welcome each child that may     'come along' and rear it happily. Yet without adequate nervous     energy in the mother what family can develop into healthy and     well-balanced useful citizens? It necessarily follows that the     output of children will be limited if the parents are to do their     part adequately. Quantity, the mass production of the past, must     give way to quality. That involves birth-control. How is it to be     achieved?\"  Without necessarily assenting to the sentiments expressed in the above quotation, the Committee considers that such opinions cannot but demand thoughtful consideration. Dread of large families or of close-interval pregnancies under modern conditions is undoubtedly a common reason for attempting to limit the family.  But having made all allowances for the more difficult circumstances of modern times, the more thoughtful consideration of some husbands for their wives and of some parents for their children, and a legitimate intention to maintain a higher standard of living, it seems clear that amongst a considerable section of the community the demand for the limitation of families has passed beyond these motives into regions of thoughtlessness and selfishness.  Furthermore, an attitude of pitying superiority towards the woman with many children appears to be a current fashion. Many witnesses expressed the opinion that a young and sensitive mother was frequently deterred from a further pregnancy, for which she would in other circumstances be quite prepared, or tempted to seek abortion, because of the fear of ridicule by current public opinion.  Still other women, it has been explained, are influenced by comparisons. Seeing their neighbours leading less burdensome and more pleasure-full lives, they decide to follow suit.  The modern desire for pleasure and freedom from responsibility has led many to lose sight of the ideal of the family as a service to the State and the unit of social life.  Unwillingness on the part of the wife to give up remunerative work is a factor that operates in certain cases; this may be due to the position of the wife as the support of an invalid husband and family, but in other cases the reason is obviously selfish.  While dealing with this question of social outlook, it will not be out of place to refer to an aspect which, though mentioned by only a few witnesses, is known to all social workers as a factor of increasing importance. This is the fear of war. It may take the form of (_a_) conscious visualization of the horrors of war, or (_b_) sub-conscious fear evidenced by excessive anxiety regarding the future. In either case it acts as a powerful deterrent from child-bearing, although it is doubtful whether those who are influenced by this fear would resort to abortion where contraception had failed.  Speaking of social conditions, some witnesses, under the impression that the average age at marriage was rising, attribute the increasing abortion-rate among the unmarried partly to this cause.  The actual fact is that the age at marriage has decreased of late years, but is still probably higher than would be the case if economic conditions were more favourable.  It is clear that, whether the motives be worthy or selfish, women of all classes are demanding the right to decide how many children they will have. Methods which depend on self-control are ruled out as impracticable. Contraceptives are largely used, and, judging by the marked decline in the birth-rate in recent years, are in many cases successful. In other cases, however, they are not so, and there is then frequently a resort to abortion.   (5) IGNORANCE OF EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION AND OF THE DANGERS OF ABORTION.  The public as a whole is ignorant of the physiology of reproduction. This results in attempts being made to prevent conception by methods which are doomed to failure at the outset. The use of defective methods owing to their comparative cheapness and the unnecessarily high cost of effective appliances are undoubtedly among the causes of such failure.  While it is not the function of this Committee to report upon the wider aspect of contraception, but to deal with it only in relation to the abortion problem, yet we would point out that the evidence given showed that, though contraception is widely practised, many of the methods used are unreliable and not founded upon physiological knowledge, and that when they fail abortion is resorted to. Abortion is a delayed, dangerous, and unsatisfactory form of birth-control. It was stressed by some witnesses that many women have no idea of the risks to life and health involved in the procuring of abortion, a medical witness mentioning, among other evils, the tendency to spontaneous abortion arising from damage to the generative organs sustained at an initial induced abortion. Other witnesses, on the contrary, maintained that these risks are well known to the majority of women, but that when faced with an unwanted pregnancy they are willing to incur any risk. Fuller reference to these dangers appears in another section of the report.   (6) INFLUENCE OF ADVERTISING.  The attention of the Committee was drawn to advertisements appearing in certain periodicals which, while openly advocating the use of various contraceptives, referred to restraint and self-control in deprecatory terms. Abortifacients were advertised in terms which, while equally offensive, were less obvious. Other advertisements set forth the contents of certain books on sex matters of a very undesirable nature. The language of these advertisements can only be described as obscene, and their possible effects on immature and inexperienced minds can well be imagined.  A reprehensible practice is that of certain so-called \"mail order chemists,\" who send out price-lists of contraceptives and abortifacients indiscriminately through the post. In some cases these advertisements were shown to be of a definitely misleading and fraudulent character.     PART III.--POSSIBLE REMEDIAL MEASURES.   Having reviewed the position as it exists in New Zealand, and having set out what appear to be the main causes, it now remains to consider possible preventive measures.   (1) THE RELIEF OF ECONOMIC STRESS.  In so far as hardships resulting from economic difficulties are genuine, the Committee believes that there is a real call for and that there are definite possibilities of relief by the State.  Two classes in particular call for most sympathetic consideration:--      (1) The wives of the unemployed, or of those precariously employed.      (2) The wives of those engaged in small farming, especially in the     dairy-farming districts of the North Island.  For such women we consider that much could be done by way of financial, domestic, and obstetrical help.  _Financial Help._--In general terms all efforts at social betterment--the reduction of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27070"],["title","Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Various Aspects of the Problem of (#4)"],["body","ent, the improvement of wages and relief, the reduction of taxation, direct and indirect, and the provision of better housing conditions--should undoubtedly help to make conditions more secure and more satisfactory for the rearing of larger families.  But further than this, we believe that really adequate financial assistance _directly related to the encouragement of the family_ is urgently called for.  It is perfectly clear that general financial improvement does not, itself, necessarily bring about larger families; limitation of the family is probably more prevalent amongst those more fortunately placed. What form this financial aid to the family should take requires much consideration.  The assistance is required not merely at the time of confinement, but also during the much longer period of the rearing and the education of the family.  A general extension of the maternity allowance under any national health scheme would afford some immediate financial assistance.  Income-tax exemption for children, however generous the scale, would not benefit these badly circumstanced cases, for already they are below the income-tax limit.  It would appear that further financial provision would have to take the form of a direct children's allowance.  It is suggested that this might be put into effect by amending the present Family Allowances Act to provide that--        (1) The amount be increased;        (2) The permissible income-level be increased;        (3) That, where given, the allowance be in respect of all the       children in the family; and        (4) That the age-limit of the children be increased to sixteen.  _Domestic Assistance._--Equally important is the provision of domestic assistance, and here we are faced with a problem of the greatest difficulty--a national problem which is affecting women in all walks of life and of which this is but one aspect.  In many farming districts it is clear that lack of domestic help is a greater burden to the harassed mother than even financial stringency.  Many admirable efforts are being made to give assistance in this direction--in the country by the housekeeper plans of the Women's Division of the Farmers' Union and other organizations, in the cities by the Mothers Help Society and similar agencies.  Extension of such system is highly desirable, and the possibility of their organization on a much larger scale with Government subsidy well deserves consideration.  In many cases these efforts are limited as much by lack of personnel as by lack of funds.  Alternatively, we suggest--      (1) That the Government should inaugurate and recruit a National     Domestic Service Corps of young women agreeable to enter the     domestic-service profession;      (2) That the recruits be guaranteed continuity of employment and     remuneration as long as their service was satisfactory;      (3) That they undergo whatever training is considered desirable at     technical school or otherwise;      (4) That they agree to perform service wherever required by the     Domestic Service Department, which Department shall ensure that the     living and working conditions are up to standard;      (5) That the service be made available to all women, and that first     consideration be given to expectant mothers, mothers convalescent     after childbirth, and mothers who have young families, and that the     service be either free or charged for according to the     circumstances of each case.  Again, realizing the fact that many of the considerations involved in this question of domestic help are beyond the scope of this Committee, we recommend that a full investigation should be made of the whole matter.  _Obstetrical Aid._--As for obstetrical help, we believe that the position is in the main adequate and good.  As far as the larger centres are concerned, no woman, however poor her circumstances, need lack complete ante-natal supervision, for which no charge is made, and proper confinement care, at most moderate cost, in the St. Helens Hospitals or the various maternity annexes of the public hospitals; where the mother is actually indigent, free provision is available through the Hospital Boards or St. Helens Hospitals.  The country mother in certain districts is, however, much less well placed, although the Health Department through its district nurses, maternity annexes, and subsidized small country hospitals is trying to meet the need.  We commend all possible efforts in this direction, and suggest that transport difficulties as they affect the country mother be given special consideration.  To a certain extent transport difficulties can be eliminated by making more use of public hospitals nearest to the patient's residence, or of private maternity hospitals subsidized by the Hospital Board of the district.  Certain general criticisms of the maternity services are elsewhere discussed and certain recommendations are made.  It is in respect of overburdened and debilitated women of those classes who are not in a position to obtain it privately that we have suggested that the State might make provision for birth-control advice.  It is for such mothers especially that we have recommended the establishment of birth-control clinics in connection with our public hospitals.  We realize, however, that genuine economic hardship is not confined to the unemployed, the wives of struggling farmers, and those on the lowest wage-levels; relative to their own circumstances and responsibilities, the difficulties of many women whose husbands are in the lower-salaried groups, or in small businesses, for instance, are just as anxious. For these we should also advocate the extension of the maternity allowance and such further direct financial encouragement of the family as can be devised.  Here, too, is the definite need for domestic help--possibly on a subsidized plan.  Many of these women prefer to make their own private arrangements for their confinements, and to enable them to do so we suggest that further assistance might be given by the provision of more maternity hospitals of the intermediate type, in which these mothers may have all adequate facilities with the right of attendance by their own doctors. Here, too, we believe that proper knowledge of child spacing is most desirable, though we consider that this is a matter for private arrangement.   (2) REMOVAL OF FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH.  It has been indicated that whereas the majority of witnesses expressed the opinion that the fear of pregnancy and labour played little part in the demand for abortion, and that the majority of women were satisfied with the help and relief which they received at the time of their confinement, yet there were some witnesses who held very strongly that inadequate pain relief and lack of sympathetic understanding of the individual on the part of the attendants were factors of considerable importance.  We believe that these complaints are, as far as the maternity services in general are concerned, entirely unjustified.  Taken as a whole, there is probably a more general use of pain-relieving measures in New Zealand to-day than anywhere else in the world.  Nevertheless, while commending what has already been done, we trust that every endeavour will be made by the Health Department, the doctors of the Dominion, and those responsible for the management of our maternity hospitals to do everything possible to extend these pain-relieving measures within the limits of safety, and to encourage that sympathetic consideration of the individual which is so desirable.  While deprecating certain attacks which have been made on the St. Helens Hospitals, and appreciating the fact that there are other considerations involved besides the relieving of pain, we feel sure that the Health Department will investigate the possibility of improving the services rendered by these Hospitals by the introduction of resident medical officers.  We agree with one witness who expressed the opinion that too much had been done in the past in the way of publishing the risks of maternity.  We feel that there are real grounds for confidence in the obstetrical services of the Dominion and that any fear of pregnancy which does exist would be largely removed if the public were made aware that New Zealand now has a very low death-rate in actual childbirth, that relief in labour is largely used, and that further developments in this direction are continually being investigated.   (3) CONTROL OF ABORTION AMONGST THE UNMARRIED.  The evidence before the Committee indicates that, while this is not the major problem, it is, nevertheless, an important one.  Obviously, the main cause is a looseness of the moral standard, and the remedy must be educational.  It is not the province, nor is it within the capacity of this Committee, to make detailed recommendations on this matter, but we would urge upon all those concerned--the educational authorities, religious bodies, the various youth movements and women's organisations, and individual parents--the importance of enlightened education of the young in the matter of sex problems.  One factor of great importance we believe to be the widespread use of contraceptives amongst the unmarried.  It might, at first thought, seem likely that the use of contraceptives, however reprehensible, would tend to diminish the incidence of abortion.  But we believe that actually this is not the case: there is reason to think that many young women, relying on undependable methods of prevention, are tempted, and then, finding themselves in misfortune, resort to some method of abortion.  It is our opinion that not only is immorality encouraged by the indiscriminate sale of contraceptives, but, indirectly, criminal abortion has increased amongst the young.  For these reasons above all we are convinced that there should be a determined effort to suppress the indiscriminate sale of contraceptives.  While realizing the great practical difficulties, we"]]]
