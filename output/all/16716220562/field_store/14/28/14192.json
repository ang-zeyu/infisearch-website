Franziska, my heart tells me my journey will be a   successful one and that I shall find him.    FRAN.   The heart, my lady! One must not trust to that too much. The heart   echoes to us the words of our tongues. If the tongue was as much   inclined to speak the thoughts of the heart, the fashion of keeping   mouths under lock and key would have come in long ago.    MIN.   Ha! ha! mouths under lock and key. That fashion would just suit me.    FRAN.   Rather not show the most beautiful set of teeth, than let the heart be   seen through them every moment.    MIN.   What, are you so reserved?    FRAN.   No, my lady; but I would willingly be more so. People seldom talk of   the virtue they possess, and all the more often of that which they do   not possess.    MIN.   Franziska, you made a very just remark there.    FRAN.   Made! Does one make it, if it occurs to one?    MIN.   And do you know why I consider it so good? It applies to my Tellheim.    FRAN.   What would not, in your opinion, apply to him?    MIN.   Friend and foe say he is the bravest man in the world. But who ever   heard him talk of bravery? He has the most upright mind; but   uprightness and nobleness of mind are words never on his tongue.    FRAN.   Of what virtues does he talk then?    MIN.   He talks of none, for he is wanting in none.    FRAN.   That is just what I wished to hear.    MIN.   Wait, Franziska; I am wrong. He often talks of economy. Between   ourselves, I believe he is extravagant.    FRAN.   One thing more, my lady. I have often heard him mention truth and   constancy toward you. What, if he be inconstant?    MIN.   Miserable girl! But do you mean that seriously?    FRAN.   How long is it since he wrote to you?    MIN.   Alas! he has only written to me once since the peace.    FRAN.   What!--A sigh on account of the peace? Surprising? Peace ought only to   make good the ill which war causes; but it seems to disturb the good   which the latter, its opposite, may have occasioned. Peace should not   be so capricious!... How long have we had peace? The time seems   wonderfully long, when there is so little news. It is no use the post   going regularly again; nobody writes, for nobody has anything to write   about.    MIN.   \"Peace has been made,\" he wrote to me, \"and I am approaching the   fulfillment of my wishes.\" But since he only wrote that to me once,   only once!!!!!    FRAN.   And since he compels us to run after this fulfillment of his wishes   ourselves... If we can but find him, he shall pay for this! Suppose,   in the meantime, he may have accomplished his wishes, and we should   learn here that!!!!!    MIN. (anxiously).   That he is dead?    FRAN.   To you, my lady; and married to another.    MIN.   You tease, you! Wait, Franziska, I will pay you out for this! But talk   to me, or I shall fall asleep. His regiment was disbanded after the   peace. Who knows into what a confusion of bills and papers he may   thereby have been brought? Who knows into what other regiment, or to   what distant station, he may have been sent? Who knows what   circumstances--There's a knock at the door.    FRAN.   Come in!      SCENE II.   Landlord, Minna, Franziska    LAND. (putting his head in at the door).   Am I permitted, your ladyship?    FRAN.   Our landlord?--Come in!    LAND. (A pen behind his ear, a sheet of paper and an inkstand in his   hand).   I am come, your ladyship, to wish you a most humble good-morning;   (to Franziska)   and the same to you, my pretty maid.    FRAN.   A polite man!    MIN.   We are obliged to you.    FRAN.   And wish you also a good-morning.    LAND.   May I venture to ask how your ladyship has passed the first night   under my poor roof?    FRAN.   The roof is not so bad, sir; but the beds might have been better.    LAND.   What do I hear! Not slept well! Perhaps the over-fatigue of the   journey!!!!!    MIN.   Perhaps.    LAND.   Certainly, certainly, for otherwise.... Yet, should there be   anything not perfectly comfortable, my lady, I hope you will not fail   to command me.    FRAN.   Very well, Mr. Landlord, very well! We are not bashful; and least of   all should one be bashful at an inn. We shall not fail to say what we   may wish.    LAND.   I next come to...   (taking the pen from behind his ear).    FRAN.   Well?    LAND.   Without doubt, my lady, you are already acquainted with the wise   regulations of our police.    MIN.   Not in the least, sir.    LAND.   We landlords are instructed not to take in any stranger, of whatever   rank or sex he may be, for four-and-twenty hours, without delivering,   in writing, his name, place of abode, occupation, object of his   journey, probable stay, and so on, to the proper authorities.    MIN.   Very well.    LAND.   Will your ladyship then be so good...   (going to the table, and making ready to write).    MIN.   Willingly. My name is!!!!!    LAND.   One minute!   (He writes.)   \"Date, 22nd August, A. D., &C.; arrived at the King of Spain hotel.\"   Now your name, my lady.    MIN.   Fraulein von Barnhelm.    LAND. (writes).   \"Von Barnhelm.\" Coming from.... where, your ladyship?    MIN.   From my estate in Saxony.    LAND. (writes).   \"Estate in Saxony.\" Saxony! Indeed, indeed! In Saxony, your ladyship?   Saxony?    FRAN.   Well, why not? I hope it is no sin in this country to come from Saxony!    LAND.   A sin? Heaven forbid! That would be quite a new sin! From Saxony then?   Yes, yes, from Saxony, a delightful country, Saxony! But if I am   right, your ladyship, Saxony is not small, and has several--how shall   I call them? districts, provinces. Our police are very particular,   your ladyship.    MIN.   I understand. From my estate in Thuringia, then.    LAND.   From Thuringia! Yes, that is better, your ladyship; that is more   exact.   (Writes and reads.)   \"Fraulein von Barnhelm, coming from her estate in Thuringia, together   with her lady in waiting and two men servants.\"    FRAN.   Lady in waiting! That means me, I suppose!    LAND.   Yes, my pretty maid.    FRAN.   Well, Mr. Landlord, instead of \"lady in waiting,\" write \"maid in   waiting.\" You say, the police are very exact; it might cause a   misunderstanding, which might give me trouble some day when my banns   are read out. For I really am still unmarried, and my name is   Franziska, with the family name of Willig: Franziska Willig. I also   come from Thuringia. My father was a miller, on one of my lady's   estates. It is called Little Rammsdorf. My brother has the mill now. I   was taken very early to the manor, and educated with my lady. We are   of the same age--one-and-twenty next Candlemas. I learnt everything my   lady learnt. I should like the police to have a full account of me.    LAND.   Quite right, my pretty maid; I will bear that in mind, in case of   future inquiries. But now, your ladyship, your business here?    MIN.   My business here?    LAND.   Have you any business with His Majesty the King?    MIN.   Oh! no.    LAND.   Or at our courts of justice?    MIN.   No.    LAND.   Or!!!!!    MIN.   No, no. I have come here solely on account of my own private affairs.    LAND.   Quite right, your ladyship; but what are those private affairs?    MIN.   They are... Franziska, I think we are undergoing an examination.    FRAN.   Mr. Landlord, the police surely do not ask to know a young lady's   secrets!    LAND.   Certainly, my pretty maid; the police wish to know everything, and   especially secrets.    FRAN.   What is to be done, my lady?... Well, listen, Mr. Landlord--but   take care that it does not go beyond ourselves and the police.    MIN.   What is the simpleton going to tell him?    FRAN.   We come to carry off an officer from the king.    LAND.   How? What? My dear girl!    FRAN.   Or to let ourselves be carried off by the officer. It is all one.    MIN.   Franziska, are you mad? The saucy girl is laughing at you.    LAND.   I hope not! With your humble servant indeed she may jest as much as   she pleases; but with the police!!!!!    MIN.   I tell you what; I do not understand how to act in this matter.   Suppose you postpone the whole affair till my uncle's arrival. I told   you yesterday why he did not come with me. He had an accident with his   carriage ten miles from here, and did not wish that I should remain a   night longer on the road, so I had to come on. I am sure he will not   be more than four-and-twenty hours after us.    LAND.   Very well, madam, we will wait for him.    MIN.   He will be able to answer your questions better. He will know to whom,   and to what extent, he must give an account of himself--what he must   relate respecting his affairs, and what he may withhold.    LAND.   So much the better! Indeed one cannot expect a young girl   (looking at Franziska in a marked manner)   to treat a serious matter with serious people in a serious manner.    MIN.   And his rooms are in readiness, I hope?    LAND.   Quite, your ladyship, quite; except the one!!!!!    FRAN.   Out of which, I suppose, you will have to turn some other honourable   gentleman!    LAND.   The waiting maids of Saxony, your ladyship, seem to be very   compassionate.    MIN.   In truth, sir, that was not well done. You ought rather to have   refused us.    LAND.   Why so, your ladyship, why so?    MIN.   I understand that the officer who was driven out on our account!!!!!    LAND.   Is only a discharged officer, your ladyship.    MIN.   Well, what then?    LAND.   Who is almost done for.    MIN.   So much the worse! He is said to be a very deserving man.    LAND.   But I tell you he is discharged.    MIN.   The king cannot be acquainted with every deserving man.    LAND.   Oh! doubtless he knows them; he knows them all.    MIN.   But he cannot reward them all.    LAND.   They would have been rewarded if they had lived so as to deserve it.   But they lived during the war as if it would last for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2663"],["title","Minna Von Barnhelm (#4)"],["body","r; as if the   words \"yours\" and \"mine\" were done away with altogether. Now all the   hotels and inns are full of them, and a landlord has to be on his   guard with them. I have come off pretty well with this one. If he had   no more money, he had at any rate money's worth; and I might indeed   have let him remain quiet two or three months longer. However, it is   better as it is. By-the-by, your ladyship, you understand about   jewels, I suppose?    MIN.   Not particularly.    LAND.   Of course your ladyship must. I must show you a ring, a valuable ring.   I see you have a very beautiful one on your finger; and the more I   look at it, the more I am astonished at the resemblance it bears to   mine. There! just look, just look!   (Taking the ring from its case, and handing it to her.)   What brilliancy! The diamond in the middle alone weighs more than five   carats.    MIN. (looking at it).   Good heavens! What do I see? This ring!!!!!    LAND.   Is honestly worth fifteen hundred thalers.    MIN.   Franziska! look!    LAND.   I did not hesitate for a moment to advance eighty pistoles on it.    MIN.   Do not you recognize it, Franziska?    FRAN.   The same! Where did you get that ring, Mr. Landlord?    LAND.   Come, my girl! you surely have no claim to it?    FRAN.   We have no claim to this ring! My mistress' monogram must be on it, on   the inner side of the setting. Look at it, my lady.    MIN.   It is! it is! How did you get this ring?    LAND.   I! In the most honourable way in the world. You do not wish to bring   me into disgrace and trouble, your ladyship! How do I know where the   ring properly belongs? During the war many a thing often changed   masters, both with and without the knowledge of its owner. War was   war. Other rings will have crossed the borders of Saxony. Give it me   again, your ladyship; give it me again!    FRAN.   When you have said from whom you got it.    LAND.   From a man whom I cannot think capable of such things; in other   respects a good man.    MIN.   From the best man under the sun, if you have it from its owner. Bring   him here directly! It is himself, or at any rate he must know him.    LAND.   Who? who, your ladyship?    FRAN.   Are you deaf? Our Major!    LAND.   Major! Right! he is a Major, who had this room before you, and from   whom I received it.    MIN.   Major von Tellheim!    LAND.   Yes, Tellheim. Do you know him?    MIN.   Do I know him! He is here! Tellheim here! He had this room! He! he   pledged this ring with you! What has brought him into this   embarrassment? Where is he? Does he owe you anything? Franziska, my   desk here! Open it!   (Franziska puts it on the table and opens it.)   What does he owe you? To whom else does he owe anything? Bring me all   his creditors! Here is gold: here are notes. It is all his!    LAND.   What is this?    MIN.   Where is he? Where is he?    LAND.   An hour ago he was here.    MIN.   Detested man! how could you act so rudely, so hardly, so cruelly   towards him?    LAND.   Your ladyship must pardon!!!!!    MIN.   Quick! Bring him to me.    LAND.   His servant is perhaps still here. Does your ladyship wish that he   should look for him?    MIN.   Do I wish it? Begone, run. For this service alone I will forget how   badly you have behaved to him.    FRAN.   Now then, quick, Mr. Landlord! Be off! fly! fly!   (Pushes him out.)      SCENE III.   Minna, Franziska    MIN.   Now I have found him again, Franziska! Do you hear? Now I have found   him again! I scarcely know where I am for joy! Rejoice with me,   Franziska. But why should you? And yet you shall; you must rejoice   with me. Come, I will make you a present, that you may be able to   rejoice with me. Say, Franziska, what shall I give you? Which of my   things would please you? What would you like? Take what you will; only   rejoice with me. I see you will take nothing. Stop!   (Thrusts her hand into the desk.)   There, Franziska,   (gives her money)   buy yourself what you like. Ask for more, if it be not sufficient; but   rejoice with me you must. It is so melancholy to be happy alone.   There, take it, then.    FRAN.   It is stealing it from you, my lady. You are intoxicated, quite   intoxicated with joy.    MIN.   Girl, my intoxication is of a quarrelsome kind. Take it, or   (forcing money into her hand)   ... and if you thank me... Stay, it is well that I think of it.   (Takes more money from the desk.)   Put that aside, Franziska, for the first poor wounded soldier who   accosts us.      SCENE IV.   Landlord, Minna, and Franziska    MIN.   Well, is he coming?    LAND.   The cross, unmannered fellow!    MIN.   Who?    LAND.   His servant. He refuses to go for him.    FRAN.   Bring the rascal here, then. I know all the Major's servants. Which   one of them was it?    MIN.   Bring him here directly. When he sees us he will go fast enough.   (Exit Landlord.)      SCENE V.   Minna, Franziska    MIN.   I cannot bear this delay. But, Franziska, how cold you are still! Why   will you not share my joy with me?    FRAN.   I would from my heart, if only!!!!!    MIN.   If only what?    FRAN.   We have found him again. But how have we found him? From all we hear,   it must go badly with him. He must be unfortunate. That distresses me.    MIN.   Distresses you! Let me embrace you for that, my dear playmate! I shall   never forget this of you. I am only in love, you are good.      SCENE VI.   Landlord, Just, Minna, Franziska    LAND.   With great difficulty I have brought him.    FRAN.   A strange face! I do not know him.    MIN.   Friend, do you live with Major von Tellheim?    JUST.   Yes.    MIN.   Where is your master?    JUST.   Not here.    MIN.   But you could find him?    JUST.   Yes.    MIN.   Will you fetch him quickly?    JUST.   No.    MIN.   You will be doing me a favour.    JUST.   Indeed!    MIN.   And your master a service.    JUST.   Perhaps not.    MIN.   Why do you suppose that?    JUST.   You are the strange lady who sent your compliments to him this   morning, I think?    MIN.   Yes.    JUST.   Then I am right.    MIN.   Does your master know my name?    JUST.   No; but he likes over-civil ladies as little as over-uncivil   landlords.    LAND.   That is meant for me, I suppose?    JUST.   Yes.    LAND.   Well, do not let the lady suffer for it then; but bring him here   directly.    MIN. (to Franziska).   Franziska, give him something    FRAN. (trying to put some money into Just's hand).   We do not require your services for nothing.    JUST.   Nor I your money without services.    FRAN.   One in return for the other.    JUST.   I cannot. My master has ordered me to pack up. That I am now about,   and I beg you not to hinder me further. When I have finished, I will   take care to tell him that he may come here. He is close by, at the   coffee-house; and if he finds nothing better to do there, I suppose he   will come.   (Going.)    FRAN.   Wait a moment! My lady is the Major's... sister.    MIN.   Yes, yes, his sister.    JUST.   I know better; the Major has not a sister. He has sent me twice in six   months to his family in Courland. It is true there are different sorts   of sisters!!!!!    FRAN.   Insolent!    JUST.   One must be so to get the people to let one alone.   (Exit.)    FRAN.   That is a rascal.    LAND.   So I said. But let him go! I know now where his master is. I will   fetch him instantly myself. I only beg your ladyship, most humbly,   that you will make an excuse for me to the Major, that I have been so   unfortunate as to offend a man of his merit against my will.    MIN.   Pray go quickly. I will set all that right again.   (Exit the Landlord.)   Franziska, run after him, and tell him not to mention my name!   (Exit Franziska.)     SCENE VII.   Minna, _and afterwards_ Franziska    MIN.   I have found him again!--Am I alone?--I will not be alone to no   purpose.--   (Clasping her hands.)   Yet I am not alone!   (Looking upwards.)   One single grateful thought towards heaven, is the most perfect   prayer! I have found him! I have found him!   (With outstretched arms.)   I am joyful and happy! What can please the Creator more than a joyful   creature!   (Franziska returns.)   Have you returned, Franziska? You pity him! I do not pity him.   Misfortune too is useful. Perhaps heaven deprived him of everything--   to give him all again, through me!    FRAN.   He may be here at any moment.--You are still in your morning dress, my   lady. Ought you not to dress yourself quickly?    MIN.   Not at all. He will now see me more frequently so, than dressed out.    FRAN.   Oh! you know, my lady, how you look best.    MIN. (after a pause).   Truly, girl, you have hit it again.    FRAN.   I think women who are beautiful, are most so when unadorned.    MIN.   Must we then be beautiful? Perhaps it was necessary that we should   think ourselves so. Enough for me, if only I am beautiful in his eyes.   Franziska, if all women feel as I now feel, we are--strange things.   Tender hearted, yet proud; virtuous, yet vain; passionate, yet   innocent. I dare say you do not understand me. I do not rightly   understand myself. Joy turns my head.    FRAN.   Compose yourself, my lady, I hear footsteps.    MIN.   Compose myself! What! receive him composedly?      SCENE VIII.   Major von Tellheim, Landlord, Minna, and Franziska    MAJ. T. (walks in, and the moment he sees Minna rushes towards her).   Ah! my Minna!    MIN. (springing towards him).   Ah! my Tellheim!    MAJ. T. (starts suddenly, and draws back).   I beg your pardon, Fraulein von Barnhelm; but to meet you here!!!!!    MIN.   Cannot surely be so unexpected!   (Approaching him, whilst he draws back still more.)   Am I to pardon you because I am still your Minna? Heaven pardon you,   that I am still Fraulein von Barnhelm!    MAJ. T.   Fraulein...   (Looks fixedly at the Landlord, and shrugs his shoulders.)    MIN. (sees the Landlord, and makes a sign to Franziska).   Sir!!!!!    MAJ. T.   If we are not both "]]]
