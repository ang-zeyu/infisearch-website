[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#2)"],["body","63_ (notification to be given to principal of     a school where child found to be delinquent)  In normal practice the Child Welfare Officer does take a head teacher into his confidence when placing a child in his school district and actively seeks his co-operation. There are odd cases, however, where it may be thought that an individual head teacher should not be given, in the words of the report, all \"the circumstances which led to the delinquency\". This would be a very rare occurrence, but the statutory obligation to tell everything he knew on every occasion might prevent the Child Welfare Officer's taking steps he believed to be in the best interests of all concerned. The best results, we feel, will come from wise administrative action and from a general improvement in the mutual understanding between teachers and Child Welfare Officers.  The Committee felt that when information of this nature was passed on to a Headmaster it should be treated as confidential. We feel strongly that any child should always have a full opportunity of repentance and of re-establishing his character, and where a child showed that definite improvement had been made by him his chances of rehabilitation should not be prejudiced by the fact of his earlier breach.       _Paragraph (f), page 63_ (recommendation that Child Welfare Act be     completely redrafted, etc.)  A complete redraft of the Act is now in course of preparation.  Further comments on paragraph (_f_) above were made by Dr Beeby. They are as follow:      \"We think that the right of appeal from the decisions of the     Children's Courts might be usefully made explicit in the Child     Welfare Act. We agree also that it might be well to provide for the     right of appeal against the Superintendent in certain     circumstances. If the system is to be workable and not brought to a     standstill by a mass of frivolous appeals, it will be necessary to     restrict the right of appeal. If an appeal were to lie every time     the Superintendent shifted a ward of State, the proceedings would     be endless. The only appeal, we think, should be one to have a     child discharged from the care of the Superintendent. Serious     complaints of ill treatment could be aired in this way. We are not     able to suggest, off-hand, exactly what the restrictions should be,     and very full discussions between Child Welfare authorities and     legal authorities would be necessary as a preliminary to effective     legislation on the point.\"  Little, if anything, appeared in the Mazengarb Committee's report to justify us in thinking that a right of appeal of the kind suggested should be provided. The Committee express the hope that a step of this kind should not be taken unless sound reasons were advanced for taking it.   Summary of Proposals for Administrative Action  In its report at pages 67 and 68 the Mazengarb Committee set out a number of proposals which in its view could be met by appropriate action on the part of the Departments mentioned by the Committee. The suggestions made have been considered by the Departments, and we give below a statement of the extent to which the suggestions have been carried into effect.  (_a_) Police Department  It was suggested that the training of policewomen should be considered with a view to deciding the best method of dealing with girls involved in sexual offences.  For the information of Parliament we set out below a few excerpts from a report prepared in the Police Department and sent to us by the Minister of Police. The excerpts are to the following effect:      \"A. _Selection and Training_      \"The minimum educational qualities required are secondary school     (Form 2).      \"Policewomen are not required for clerical or administrative     duties, therefore importance is not attached to ability to perform     office work, typing, or shorthand writing.      \"Recruits chosen with due regard to the foregoing are required to     undergo a course extending over five weeks in the Police School at     Lyttelton. They are coached in subjects relating to statutes,     general police duties, powers and responsibilities of the police,     methods of dealing with various contingencies with which they may     be faced when on duty, relations with and bearing towards the     general public, first-aid, and self-defence. In short, this course     is similar in character to that undergone by male recruits to the     Force.      \"Women recruits are instructed by a pathologist in matters     pertaining to pregnancy, abortion, and the identification of     abortion instruments and drugs. They receive instruction in     maternity hospitals, with special reference to the unmarried     mother. Children's homes, orphanages, and also homes for the aged     are visited and studied with a view to creating a solid background     for the policewomen's work.      \"With the co-operation of the Justice Department women trainees     visit prisons and borstal institutions. They also attend and study     procedure at Magistrates' and Supreme Courts. The workings of the     probation service and Child Welfare Department are also the subject     of visits and study.      \"The training course of five weeks is shorter than that for men,     but women recruits appear to absorb instruction more quickly and     less time is devoted to physical training.      \"B. _Suggestions Relative to Training_      \"It is felt the present training syllabus coupled with the     practical experience which rapidly follows is adequate and that     each policewoman is capable of dealing with the problem of the girl     who has been involved in sexual offences.      \"C. _Further Comments_      \"The Police Department appreciates that if increased numerically     and used more generally policewomen may be a great factor in the     prevention of juvenile delinquency, provided that through their     frequent association with children, both in the company of their     parents and at all grades of school, they become accepted by these     young persons from infancy. The help and guidance of women police     could be sought on grounds similar to those of the school dental     nurse who in her particular sphere is banishing the fear of dental     treatment. It is felt a similar approach to the child's moral     welfare is worthy of consideration.\"  It is a fact that within recent weeks steps have been taken by the Government to establish and operate an improved system of training for recruits for the Police Force. We had no information before us as to the nature of the course or the length of the training period: nor do we know whether a specific course of training will be prescribed for women recruits. We feel, however, that it is a fair assumption that a sounder, more thorough, and more systematic system is about to be put into operation. We feel, too, that with the increased emphasis about to be laid upon training, it can safely be taken for granted that every effort has been, and will continue to be, made to give effect to the suggestions of the Mazengarb Committee.   (_b_) Department of Internal Affairs  It was a recommendation of the Mazengarb Committee that steps should be taken to gazette the outstanding regulations authorized under the relevant film censorship Acts of 1934 and 1953.  A report received from the Department of Internal Affairs contains the information set out below:      \"It could be assumed from the terms of the recommendation that no     regulations are at present in force governing the censorship of     films and film posters. This, however, is not the case, as     appropriate regulations have been in operation for many years. What     is now contemplated is a revision of the existing regulations to     take account of later legislation and to modernise them in the     light of new developments and policies relating to this aspect of     the film industry.      \"In particular, the Cinematograph Films Amendment Act 1953 made     fairly extensive amendments to existing law relating to censorship,     and this in turn has led to the necessity for a completely new     approach to certain policy and machinery aspects of the existing     regulations. For these reasons, and as the film industry is a     licensed and controlled industry, the Committee will understand     that it has not been possible, or even perhaps desirable, to     progress as speedily as would be the case with other regulations     of a more normal character.      \"For the information of your Committee the general position now is     that the regulations are in a final stage of preparation and will     be submitted for Government approval as soon as practicable.\"  We have been advised that quite recently a final draft of the regulations was forwarded to the Film Industry Board for consideration. We were told, too, that conferences are being held between officers of the Department of Internal Affairs on the one hand and members of the Film Industry Board on the other. It is expected that at the conclusion of such conferences an agreed draft will be sent forward to the Government.   (_c_) Broadcasting Service  Two recommendations were before us for our consideration:      (1) \"That the Service ensure that the concept 'Crime must never     pay' is more prominently featured in crime serials; and      (2) \"That a married woman be immediately appointed to the     auditioning panel.\"  In its report to us the Broadcasting Service says:      \"As regards (1), the Service has always attached great importance     to this principle. We can let feature producers know that we attach     greater importance to it than ever; but we cannot make it more     explicit or more prominent in a feature than the producers have.     (After all, no convention in the field of dramatic fiction, in any     medium, is stronger or better understood than the convention which     distinguishes hero and villain and makes the first triumph over the    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],["title","Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#3)"],["body"," second.)      \"As regards (2), this extends a practice in accordance with which,     since 1952, one or another of the senior women officers of the     Service has been used as a referee, when auditioning officers have     been in doubt about the proper classification and placement of     features.      \"It may be said in summary, then, that the principles, methods, and     practice of the Service are in general commended; that they are in     no respect criticized severely and in no respect without express     qualification; and that the Committee suggests or recommends no new     purpose, no new method, but only the closer application of methods     already well tried to a purpose which events have made weightier     and more urgent.      \"Nevertheless, it has appeared to be desirable to consider what     action could and should be taken in accordance with what appears to     be the spirit of the Committee's comments and recommendations on     Broadcasting rather than with their letter. This has been done, and     in what follows I wish to offer some comments and explanations, to     review action taken as soon as the report was available and later     decisions now being carried out, and to ask for further direction.\"          \"_Action: Immediate and Continuing:_          \"(i) After the report had been studied Station Managers and         other responsible officers were asked to take interim action to         ensure that the spirit of the Committee's conclusions in regard         to a certain type of song was reflected in their programmes.         They were also asked to let us know, with reasons, of any         serial features running at their stations which they think         should be considered for withdrawal or later time placement.          \"(ii) Two married women of senior status on our staff have been         selected to sit in alternation on the Standard Recordings         Purchasing Committee and the Features Purchasing Committee.         They will not be able to hear with every auditioning officer         all episodes of features or all single recordings of songs. To         duplicate auditioning staff for this purpose would require the         full-time service of five or six married women. Either one,         however, will with the Committee study reports, agreeing to         acceptance or rejection, and help to guide auditioning and         purchasing policy. Doubtful cases brought up by auditioning         officers will be heard by them as well as by other senior         officers.          \"(iii) The time allotted to features classified as suitable for         playing when large audiences of children may be expected to be         listening has been from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.; it is now to be from         4 p.m. to 8 p.m. There may be differences of opinion from time         to time on suitability of features for this classification as         we have a considerable number of public judges of our         decisions, but we shall do our best. All auditioning officers         will be fully alert to their responsibility.          \"(iv) Opportunity was taken at a conference in Wellington at         the end of last month of the senior programme organizers of all         stations throughout the country to discuss fully their         responsibilities towards the matters raised in the Committee's         report. They also discussed the draft of a revised code of         instructions to auditioning officers and others, and this code         is now being circulated.          \"(v) An extension of present procedure on popular song records         was decided upon for Head Office auditioning officers. Records         will be wholly rejected, or passed for general use, or passed         with the reservation that they are to be programmed with         special care (i.e., as to time placement, frequency, etc.).\"          \"The following further action is to be taken:          \"(i) The issue of the code referred to above will give effect         to the Service's desire for the consistent wholesomeness of         programmes, the need to aim constantly to maintain standards in         programmes of all kinds at the highest appropriate level, and         the need to exercise discretion in programming material which         might be rendered objectionable by repetition, inappropriate         time placement, or standard and style of performance.          \"(ii) Some of the dramatic features at present running will be         reauditioned if it is thought that they may be out of tune with         the present atmosphere or the revised time classification. Even         with additional assistance this task may take about six months.         There may be some financial loss if many episodes are to be         discarded or if the withdrawal of episodes or alteration of         time classification creates difficulties in providing         replacement programmes at short notice for sponsors. It is         relevant here to note the difference between ourselves and film         or book censors. After censoring we must ourselves face the         financial result of our actions and the administrative         difficulty of finding substitute and less objectionable         material.          \"(iii) Suppliers of transcribed programmes in Australia are to         be advised of the implications of the report so far as it is         likely to affect our future purchasing policy.          \"There has been a tendency amongst our critics (I do not refer         here to the Committee) to make insufficient allowance for the         considerable part played by broadcasting in serving the public         good in the spheres of information, education, the arts,         and community services. As Sir William Haley, formerly         Director-General of the B.B.C. and now Editor of the _Times_         said in a recent lecture on _The Public Influence of         Broadcasting and the Press_: 'It is, of course, possible to         counter all this by raising one's eyebrows at some of the         variety programmes. They are the other side of the medal. But         one must look at the whole'.\"  Our conclusions as a Committee are as follows:      (1) The officers of the New Zealand Broadcasting Service have     studied in a properly co-operative spirit the suggestions and     recommendations of the Mazengarb Committee, and that      (2) They are alive to the responsibilities that rest upon them as a     Department of State charged with the task of operating a most     important medium of public entertainment, information and     instruction, and that      (3) They have, over the years, worked out for themselves a code of     procedure under which a high and commendable standard of     broadcasting has been, and is being, maintained, and that      (4) They are taking all reasonable and practicable steps to give     effect to the suggestions put forward by the Mazengarb Committee,     and that      (5) We express the hope that the utmost vigilance should be     exercised over the choice, content, and timing of     programmes--especially over those designed for the extended hours     set apart for juvenile listeners--and that every effort be made to     maintain the high standard that the Service has set for itself. We     recommend, too, that during the hours set apart for children there     should be a complete absence of features that can fairly be     regarded as being unsuitable for or injurious to young people.   (_d_) Censoring Authorities  On this point we cite a paragraph from a memorandum placed before us by the Secretary for the Department of Internal Affairs. It reads as follows:      \"A further recommendation contained in the report is to the     following effect:          \"'Any Departments concerned with censorship should maintain a         liaison to produce as far as possible a uniform interpretation         of public opinion and taste.'      \"In the view of this Department the objective of the recommendation     is good and should be followed up by appropriate action. There are     several Departments concerned from different angles, and it would     seem that the recommendation could best be implemented by whichever     Department is charged with the general oversight of matters     relating to moral delinquency. It would then be merely a matter of     administrative action for that Department to call periodical     meetings of the appropriate officers concerned with censorship.\"  We, as a Committee, agree with the view expressed above, and recommend it to the Government for consideration.   (_e_) Department of Education  (i) _Relative Functions of Public Health Nurses and Visiting Teachers._--The duties of visiting teachers were laid down quite specifically in an official circular in 1953. Senior officers of the two Departments discussed the relative functions of public health nurses and visiting teachers very fully soon after the publication of the report. The two Departments and Education Boards have drawn the attention of all visiting teachers and public health nurses to methods of avoiding overlapping and of working in co-operation. In a number of districts Child Care Committees, sponsored by Senior Inspectors of Schools, have instituted central case registers. These have been a great help in ensuring that visiting teachers and public health nurses do not deal independently with the same child and family.  A residential course at Frederic Wallis House, Lower Hutt, has been planned for visiting teachers and public health nurses in 1956.  (ii) and (iii) _Additional Visiting Teachers and Type of Officer to Help in Post-Primary Schools_.--Approval has been given for four additional visiting teachers--two in Auckland, one in Wellington, and one in Christchurch. Discussions have been held with representative post-primary-school principals on the kind of help they need with problem children. Rather than have visiting teachers specially"]]]
