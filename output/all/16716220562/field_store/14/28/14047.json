One season I succeeded in finding at least five pairs of these warblers, in company with their clamorous broods.  The nest is set on the ground in the bushes and grass of second-growth timber tracts.  Lined with tendrils and fine strips of bark, it is \"firmly wrapped with numerous leaves, whose stems point upward.\"  Another haunter of the dusky depths of the woods is the ovenbird.  His song is one of the most peculiar in warblerdom.  Beginning in moderate tones, it grows louder and louder as it nears the end, and really seems like a voice moving toward you.  This bird also walks about in the woods, and does not hop, as most of his relatives do.  As he walks about on his leafy carpet, his head erect, he has quite a consequential air.  He derives his name from the fact that his nest, set on the ground, is globular in form, with the entrance at one side, giving it the appearance of a small oven.  The gay redstarts, which seem to be so tame and confiding in the early spring, turn into veritable eremites in the breeding season, seeking the most secluded portions of the woods as their habitat.  Their little nests are harder to find than one would suppose; yet I have had the good fortune to watch two females erecting the walls of their tiny cottages, and a pretty sight it was.  The redstart has some interesting ways.  One of them is his habit of spreading out his wings and tail as he perches or flits about in the trees, as if he were anxious to display the fiery trimmings that so elegantly set off his little black suit.  Blood will tell, for I have seen the young redstarts imitating their parents by spreading out their odd, croppy tails in a comical way.  [Illustration: Chickadee]  How early in life young birds are taught some of the lessons that are needful for their own safety!  One day I heard a young redstart chirping for his dinner.  I quietly thrust my head into the thicket, and soon espied the birdkin perched on a twig only about a rod away.  He either did not see me, or else decided that I was not a bugaboo.  A few minutes later the mother darted into the enclosure and fed her baby.  She was too much absorbed in her duties to notice me until the repast was over; then she suddenly caught sight of her unwelcome caller.  She stood transfixed with astonishment for one breathless moment, then uttered a piercing cry of alarm that sent the little one dashing away like a streak of lightning.  Plainly the youngster understood his mamma's signal, for until she uttered it he had sat perfectly quiet and unconcerned, perhaps not even aware of my presence.  Birds are taught the language of fear at a tender age.  Of course they learn it so readily because there is a basis of timidity in their natures, implanted by heredity.     CHICKADEE WAYS*  *Reprinted by permission, from \"Our Animal Friends,\" New York.   In a somewhat casual way, and without going into their natural history, the last two chapters have indicated the method of making an acquaintance with new species and of studying the habits of a few wild birds.  A few chapters will now be devoted to a fuller study of a number of interesting birds.  Not that I expect to write their complete life histories, which, indeed, would not be necessary; but that I may give you some idea of the large amount of knowledge that can be gained of one species.  If this were multiplied by the knowledge procurable from the study of all the members of the feathered brotherhood, think what an education the whole would give one.  Let us begin with the familiar little tomtit.  In his valuable manual, \"Birds of Eastern North America,\" Dr. Frank M. Chapman calls the little black-capped chickadee an \"animated bunch of black and white feathers.\"  That is certainly a graphic and correct way of putting it, for no bird is more active and alert than this little major with the black skull cap and ashy-blue coat.  Everybody knows him, I take it, but if any more points are needed for his identification, you must look for a little bird which, in addition to his cap of glossy black, wears a bib of the same color, buckled up close to his chin, with a wedge of white inserted on each side of his neck between the black of his throat and crown to the corner of his mouth.  If all birds were as sociably disposed as the little tomtit--for that is also one of his names--bird study would be a delight, and almost a sinecure.  Trustful and fearless, he often comes within a few feet of you, and fixes you with his keen little eyes, which dart out innumerable interrogation points.  Sometimes he calls his own name in a saucy way, \"Chick-a-dee-dee, chick-a-dee-dee,\" which, being interpreted, means, \"What is your business here, sir?  Aren't you out of your proper latitude?\"  Occasionally he will grow terribly excited over your presence--or at least pretend to--scolding and shaming you until you feel yourself a real interloper; at other times he will salute you in the most affable way, as if bidding you welcome to his haunts and inviting you to come often and make yourself at home.  What a pity it is he cannot talk, and let us know what he really thinks of us and of the world in general!  Dr. Chapman says that on two occasions chickadees have flown down and perched on his hand, giving him the feeling that he was being taken into their confidence.  Watch Master Tomtit as he performs some of his acrobatic feats, putting the tilters and tumblers in the human circus to the blush.  He often hangs back downward from a slender twig or even a leaf, and daintily picks the nits that have ensconced themselves in the buds or foliage. Let his flexile perch sway in the wind as it will, he is safe, for if the twig should break or his hold should slip, which seldom occurs, he can recover himself at once by spreading his nimble wings, wheeling about, and alighting on a perch below.  Ah, yes! the tomtit is the embodiment and poetry of nimbleness.  But he is more than a mere feathered gentleman; he is an extremely useful citizen.  Prof. E. D. Sanderson published a valuable article in \"The Auk\" for April 1898, in which he proved that this bird serves a most useful purpose as an insecticide.  He examined the craws of twenty-eight chickadees, nineteen of them secured in the winter and nine in the spring.  During the winter 70.7 per cent of the food found in these stomachs was animal, while in the spring no vegetable matter was found at all, the birds subsisting entirely on insects and their eggs and larvae.  By far the larger part of the insects thus destroyed were of the noxious species that bore into the bark and wood of the trees or sting the fruit.  An orchard in which several chickadees had taken up their abode one winter and spring was so well cleared of canker worms that an excellent yield of fruit was grown, whereas the trees of other orchards in the neighborhood were largely defoliated by the destructive worms, and there was no yield of fruit.  Professor Sanderson made an interesting estimate of the economic value of our little scavengers.  In the state of Michigan, where his observations were made, he thinks that a fair average is seven chickadees to the square mile.  If each bird should destroy fifty-five insects per day, which is a very modest estimate, the seven birds would consume three hundred and eighty-five every day, making about 137,500 per year in each square mile.  In this way about eight billions of insects would be destroyed annually in the state--an economic fact whose importance cannot be overestimated.  The same investigator also thinks that it would be wise for farmers and fruit-growers to encourage the chickadees to make their homes in orchards, and this could be done, he says, \"by placing food for them till they feel at home, by erecting suitable nesting sites, and by careful protection\"; to which I would add, by leaving a few old snags in the trees where the birds can find natural nesting places.  Besides the useful purpose the birds would serve, what pleasant companions they would be, piping, both summer and winter, their sweet minor tunes!  No one can deny that the tomtit is a companionable little fellow.  In addition to his vigorous call of \"Chick-a-dee-dee,\" he whistles, as has been said, a sweet minor strain which may be represented by the syllables, \"Phe-e-be-e,\" repeated again and again.  Often in midwinter, when bland days come, and even in very cold weather, too, sometimes, he will pipe his pensive air, which floats through the woods like a song of chastened sadness.  Not infrequently two tits will engage in what may be called a \"responsive exercise,\" swinging their two-part song back and forth in the woods like a silvery pendulum.  Not soon shall I forget a winter day on which I listened with delight to such an antiphonal duet.  I was standing in a road that wound along the foot of a steep, wooded bluff, and the two minstrels were in the woods above me, one of them singing very high in the scale, the other responding in the same tune, but almost, if not quite, an octave lower.  At first they were about twenty rods apart, but as they swung back and forth, they gradually approached each other until the distance between them was only a few feet.  The music seemed like a slender thread of silver which was being wound up at both ends, gradually drawing the little fluters together.  Sometimes one of them would miss one note of his dissyllabic song, and at times the refrains were repeated in a leisurely way, at times in quick succession; but the performers never sang simultaneously, each waiting until his fellow minstrel had given his reply.  The pleasing duet lasted for many minutes; indeed, it was kept up long after I left the immediate neighborhood, for when I had gone quite a distance the sweet cadenzas still fell rhythmically on my ear.  To my mind the two-part aria seemed like a voluntary performance, and I cannot doubt that it was.  There"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],["title","Our Bird Comrades (#7)"],["body","too much of an air of purpose about it to permit of the thought that it was a mere accident or coincidence; but whether it was a musical contest between rival vocalists, or the love song of a tomtit and his mate, I could not determine.  Cunning in other ways, it would be strange if the tomtits did not display acuteness in the selection of nesting sites.  A cosy hollow in a dead snag or stump is especially acceptable.  Sometimes it is a deserted woodpecker's cavity made trig and clean, while quite often, when the wood is soft enough, the tits themselves chisel out a little hole in a tree or stump or fence post.  I recall having once watched a pair of chickadees hollowing the upper end of a truncated sassafras tree that was half decayed.  They would fly into the cavity, pick off a chip, dash out and away a rod or two, drop the fragment, then dart back to the hollow for another piece.  In this way the busy couple worked hour by hour without resting for an instant.  Their reason no doubt for carrying the chips some distance away from their nest was that they did not want any telltale fragments to betray their secret to their enemies.  It would be impossible to tell how many chickadee nests I have found in all the years of my bird study.  One of them was in an old stump near a path along which I was sauntering.  My attention was attracted by the little husband's flying from the stump and calling nervously, thus unwittingly \"giving away\" his secret.  Had he been quiet, my suspicions would not have been aroused; but many birds, like a few people here and there, find it very hard to keep a secret.  And this, by the way, is one of the strangest things about Nature--that she has not taught her feathered children to go with apparent unconcern about their employment when a nest is near, but impels them to chirp and flit about in such a way as to excite the suspicion of an enemy.  Moralizing aside, however.  On examining the stump, I found a deep cavity just inside of the decaying bark.  Though it was quite dusk within, by slightly pressing the bark aside I could see the little mother sitting on the nest, unwilling to leave it in spite of my proximity.  I almost touched her with my hand, and still she did not move.  Unwilling to disturb so brave a heroine, I stepped back and walked quietly away a few rods to see what would happen, when she popped out of the orifice like an arrow and, joined by her mate, set up a loud chattering, which sounded as if they were saying that I was the nosiest and most impudent man in the whole countryside.  No doubt they were right, for I went back, in spite of their protest, and peeped into the nest, and found four gleaming white eggs studding the bottom like pearls.  Alas! when I visited the place two weeks later, the little domicile had been raided, the half-decayed walls having been broken down.  A tuft of gray hair hanging to a splinter proved the invader to have been a predatory animal of some kind, probably a cat.  The birds were nowhere to be seen--unless a pair chirping in the woods on the other side of the valley were the same couple, trying to rear a family in a safer place.  What a persistent sitter the female blackcap is!  One day I discovered a nest in a fence post by the wayside.  Pressing the bark aside, I could plainly see the little owner snuggling close to the bottom of the cup.  I thrust my finger through the aperture and gently stroked her head and back.  Still she hugged the nest, pressing her head close to the grassy bottom, as if she thought she would be safe if her head were hidden.  Thinking she must have little ones, or she would not cling so tenaciously to the nest, I pushed my finger under her and partly raised her from her seat.  Even this rude treatment she bore for a few moments--but it was going too far even for her courageous little heart; she lifted her head, glanced wildly at me for an intense moment, then sprang from the cavity with a piercing cry.  Imagine my surprise to find the nest entirely empty, not even an egg having yet been deposited.  The brave little lady had doubtless just entered the nest to lay her first egg, and was not going to be driven off without knowing the reason why.  The tomtit is game every time.  The entrance to most of the chickadee's nests is lateral, but I found one nest whose doorway was in the top of a fence post, so that the owners had to go down into it vertically.  The hole was quite deep, and the birds would drop down into it as you have seen swifts dropping into a chimney, but whether they went down head first or tail first I could not learn, their movements were so quick.  Another feature of this nest was that it had no roof, for the doorway was open to the sky, so that a cloudburst would have filled up their little nursery and drowned its inmates.     THE NUTHATCH FAMILY*  *This chapter is reprinted from that excellent bird magazine called \"American Ornithology,\" published by Charles K. Reed, Worcester, Mass., and edited by his son, Chester A. Reed.  The author is under obligation to these gentlemen for their courtesy in permitting him to reprint the article.   BIRDS OF THE INVERTED POSITION  There are a number of climbers in the bird realm, but none are quite so expert as the nuthatch, which may be regarded as a past-master in the art of clambering.  The woodpeckers amble up the boles and branches of trees, and when they wish to descend, as they do occasionally for a short distance, they hitch down backward.   The brown creepers ascend their vertical or oblique walls in the same way, but seldom, if ever, do anything else than clamber upward, never descending head downward after the fashion of the nuthatches.  [Illustration: Nuthatch]  A little bird that comes very near disputing the palm with the nuthatch as a sylvan coaster is the creeping warbler, which flits about over the tree boles in all kinds of attitudes, even with his dainty head pointed toward the earth.  No fear in his little striped breast of the blood rushing to his brain.  However, even this clever birdlet's dexterity is not equal to that of the nuthatch, for the latter is able to climb up and down a smoother wall than his little rival.  More than that, the nuthatch glides downward with more ease and in a straight line, and does not fling himself from side to side as the warbler does.  Indeed, the warbler's favorite method of going about is with his head directed toward the sky rather than the reverse, while it really seems that the nuthatch's predilection is to scuttle about in an inverted position. Does he wish to chisel a grub out of the bark of a tree?  He usually stands above the target at which he aims, so that he can deliver his blows with more force, just as the human woodchopper prefers to take his position above and not below the stick or log upon which he expects to operate.  There the bird clings to his shaggy wall, pounding away with might and main, until you fear he will shatter his beak or strew his brains on the bark.  Sometimes, too, he thrusts his long, slender beak into a crevice and pries with it in a way that threatens to snap it off in the middle.  What has been said applies to the white-breasted nuthatch (_Sitta carolinensis_), but it is fair to assume that all the other members of this subfamily behave in the same way.  The woodpeckers and creepers use their spiny tails as supports while stationary or in motion; not so the nuthatches, which are sufficiently nimble on their feet to stand or glide without converting their tails into braces.  Odd as it may seem to the uninformed, the nuthatches belong to the order of passeres or perching birds, in spite of their creeping habits.  The systematists have placed them in this niche of the avicular scheme, not only because they are able to perch like other passeres on twigs and small branches, but also because they have the foot of the true perching bird, with three toes in front and one, well developed, in the rear.  In this respect they differ again from the woodpeckers, which have either two fore and two hind toes, or two in front and only one behind.  This will appear all the more remarkable when it is remembered that the _Picidae_ do not descend head downward at all, while the _Sittinae_ are the head-downward goers par excellence.  Yet they have only one rear toe to support them in their inverted position.  You would naturally suppose that if any bird had need of two hind toes, it would be the nuthatch; but the result proves that, after all, Nature had her wits about her when she evolved this avian family.  The world over, there are twenty distinct species of nuthatches known to scientific observers, but only four of them are natives of America. Of course, there are a number of subspecies or varieties.  All of them are incessant climbers and foragers, peering into crannies, pounding here and there to make the grubs stir in their hiding places, jabbing and prying with their beaks, and chiseling out all kinds of larvae, grubs, and borers that would, if permitted to live and multiply, soon devastate the timber and fruit trees and make this world a desert indeed.  True, the other feathered clamberers and carpenters are fully as useful, but depend upon it, the nuthatches do their share in preserving our forests and orchards.  The white-breasted nuthatch is our most common species east of the great plains, breeding from the Gulf States to the northern border of the United States and to New Brunswick.  One peculiarity about him is that he breeds throughout his range, and therefore may be found as both a summer and winter resident in all suitable localities within these boundaries.  In the winter, no matter how old Boreas may bluster, he is one of the most cheerful denizens of the woods in our central latitudes, calling his nasal \"yank, yank, yank,\" and sometimes indulging in a loud, half-merry outburst that goes echoing through the woodlands.  No sound of the sylvan solitudes has a more"]]]
