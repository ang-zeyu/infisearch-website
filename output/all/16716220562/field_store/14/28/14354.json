After he had spent an hour on the look-out from the “Golden Portcullis,” under the pent-house of which he could keep himself a little in the shade, D’Artagnan observed a soldier leave the Bastile. This was, indeed, the surest indication he could possibly have wished for, as every jailer or warder has certain days, and even certain hours, for leaving the Bastile, since all are alike prohibited from having either wives or lodgings in the castle, and can accordingly leave without exciting any curiosity; but a soldier once in barracks is kept there for four and twenty hours when on duty,--and no one knew this better than D’Artagnan. The guardsman in question, therefore, was not likely to leave his regimentals, except on an express and urgent order. The soldier, we were saying, left the Bastile at a slow and lounging pace, like a happy mortal, in fact, who, instead of mounting sentry before a wearisome guard-house, or upon a bastion no less wearisome, has the good luck to get a little liberty, in addition to a walk--both pleasures being luckily reckoned as part of his time on duty. He bent his steps towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, enjoying the fresh air and the warmth of the sun, and looking at all the pretty faces he passed. D’Artagnan followed him at a distance; he had not yet arranged his ideas as what was to be done. “I must, first of all,” he thought, “see the fellow’s face. A man seen is a man judged.” D’Artagnan increased his pace, and, which was not very difficult, by the by, soon got in advance of the soldier. Not only did he observe that his face showed a tolerable amount of intelligence and resolution, but he noticed also that his nose was a little red. “He has a weakness for brandy, I see,” said D’Artagnan to himself. At the same moment that he remarked his red nose, he saw that the soldier had a white paper in his belt.  “Good, he has a letter,” added D’Artagnan. The only difficulty was to get hold of the letter. But a common soldier would, of course, be only too delighted at having been selected by M. de Baisemeaux as a special messenger, and would not be likely to sell his message. As D’Artagnan was biting his nails, the soldier continued to advance more and more into the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. “He is certainly going to Saint-Mande,”  he said to himself, “and I shall not be able to learn what the letter contains.” It was enough to drive him wild. “If I were in uniform,” said D’Artagnan to himself, “I would have this fellow seized, and his letter with him. I could easily get assistance at the very first guard-house; but the devil take me if I mention my name in an affair of this kind. If I were to treat him to something to drink, his suspicions would be roused; and besides, he might drink me drunk. _Mordioux!_ my wits seem to have left me,” said D’Artagnan; “it is all over with me. Yet, supposing I were to attack this poor devil, make him draw his sword and kill him for the sake of his letter? No harm in that, if it were a question of a letter from a queen to a nobleman, or a letter from a cardinal to a queen; but what miserable intrigues are those of Messieurs Aramis and Fouquet with M. Colbert. A man’s life for that? No, no, indeed; not even ten crowns.” As he philosophized in this manner, biting first his nails, and then his mustaches, he perceived a group of archers and a commissary of the police engaged in carrying away a man of very gentlemanly exterior, who was struggling with all his might against them. The archers had torn his clothes, and were dragging him roughly away. He begged they would lead him along more respectfully, asserting that he was a gentleman and a soldier. And observing our soldier walking in the street, he called out, “Help, comrade.”  The soldier walked on with the same step towards the man who had called out to him, followed by the crowd. An idea suddenly occurred to D’Artagnan; it was his first one, and we shall find it was not a bad one either. During the time the gentleman was relating to the soldier that he had just been seized in a house as a thief, when the truth was he was only there as a lover; and while the soldier was pitying him, and offering him consolation and advice with that gravity which a French soldier has always ready whenever his vanity or his _esprit de corps_ is concerned, D’Artagnan glided behind the soldier, who was closely hemmed in by the crowd, and with a rapid sweep, like a sabre slash, snatched the letter from his belt. As at this moment the gentleman with the torn clothes was pulling about the soldier, to show how the commissary of police had pulled him about, D’Artagnan effected his pillage of the letter without the slightest interference. He stationed himself about ten paces distant, behind the pillar of an adjoining house, and read on the address, “To Monsieur du Vallon, at Monsieur Fouquet’s, Saint-Mande.”  “Good!” he said, and then he unsealed, without tearing the letter, drew out the paper, which was folded in four, from the inside; which contained only these words:  “DEAR MONSIEUR DU VALLON,--Will you be good enough to tell Monsieur d’Herblay that _he_ has been to the Bastile, and has been making inquiries.  “Your devoted  “DE BAISEMEAUX.”   “Very good! all right!” exclaimed D’Artagnan; “it is clear enough now. Porthos is engaged in it.” Being now satisfied of what he wished to know: “_Mordioux!_” thought the musketeer, “what is to be done with that poor devil of a soldier? That hot-headed, cunning fellow, De Baisemeaux, will make him pay dearly for my trick,--if he returns without the letter, what will they do to him? Besides, I don’t want the letter; when the egg has been sucked, what is the good of the shell?” D’Artagnan perceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in convincing the soldier, and went on their way with the prisoner, the latter being still surrounded by the crowd, and continuing his complaints. D’Artagnan advanced into the very middle of the crowd, let the letter fall, without any one having observed him, and then retreated rapidly. The soldier resumed his route towards Saint-Mande, his mind occupied with the gentleman who had implored his protection. Suddenly he thought of his letter, and, looking at his belt, saw that it was no longer there. D’Artagnan derived no little satisfaction from his sudden, terrified cry. The poor soldier in the greatest anguish of mind looked round him on every side, and at last, about twenty paces behind him, he perceived the lucky envelope. He pounced on it like a falcon on its prey. The envelope was certainly a little dirty, and rather crumpled, but at all events the letter itself was found. D’Artagnan observed that the broken seal attracted the soldier’s attention a good deal, but he finished apparently by consoling himself, and returned the letter to his belt. “Go on,” said D’Artagnan, “I have plenty of time before me, so you may precede me. It appears that Aramis is not in Paris, since Baisemeaux writes to Porthos. Dear Porthos, how delighted I shall be to see him again, and to have some conversation with him!” said the Gascon. And, regulating his pace according to that of the soldier, he promised himself to arrive a quarter of an hour after him at M. Fouquet’s.    Chapter III. In Which the Reader will be Delighted to Find that Porthos Has Lost Nothing of His Muscularity.  D’Artagnan had, according to his usual style, calculated that every hour is worth sixty minutes, and every minute worth sixty seconds. Thanks to this perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds, he reached the superintendent’s door at the very moment the soldier was leaving it with his belt empty. D’Artagnan presented himself at the door, which a porter with a profusely embroidered livery held half opened for him. D’Artagnan would very much have liked to enter without giving his name, but this was impossible, and so he gave it. Notwithstanding this concession, which ought to have removed every difficulty in the way, at least D’Artagnan thought so, the _concierge_ hesitated; however, at the second repetition of the title, captain of the king’s guards, the _concierge_, without quite leaving the passage clear for him, ceased to bar it completely. D’Artagnan understood that orders of the most positive character had been given. He decided, therefore, to tell a falsehood,--a circumstance, moreover, which did not seriously affect his peace of mind, when he saw that beyond the falsehood the safety of the state itself, or even purely and simply his own individual personal interest, might be at stake. He moreover added to the declarations he had already made, that the soldier sent to M. du Vallon was his own messenger, and that the only object that letter had in view was to announce his intended arrival. From that moment, no one opposed D’Artagnan’s entrance any further, and he entered accordingly. A valet wished to accompany him, but he answered that it was useless to take that trouble on his account, inasmuch as he knew perfectly well where M. du Vallon was. There was nothing, of course, to say to a man so thoroughly and completely informed on all points, and D’Artagnan was permitted, therefore, to do as he liked. The terraces, the magnificent apartments, the gardens, were all reviewed and narrowly inspected by the musketeer. He walked for a quarter of an hour in this more than royal residence, which included as many wonders as articles of furniture, and as many servants as there were columns and doors. “Decidedly,” he said to himself, “this mansion has no other limits than the pillars of the habitable world. Is it probable Porthos has taken it into his head to go back to Pierrefonds without even leaving M. Fouquet’s house?” He finally reached a remote part of the chateau inclosed by a stone wall, which was covered with a profusion of thick plants, luxuriant in blossoms as large and solid as fruit. At equal distances on the top of this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],["title","Louise de la Valliere (#5)"],["body","were placed various statues in timid or mysterious attitudes. These were vestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum, with its thick, sinuous folds; agile nymphs, covered with their marble veils, and guarding the palace with their fugitive glances. A statue of Hermes, with his finger on his lips; one of Iris, with extended wings; another of Night, sprinkled all over with poppies, dominated the gardens and outbuildings, which could be seen through the trees. All these statues threw in white relief their profiles upon the dark ground of the tall cypresses, which darted their somber summits towards the sky. Around these cypresses were entwined climbing roses, whose flowering rings were fastened to every fork of the branches, and spread over the lower boughs and the various statues, showers of flowers of the rarest fragrance. These enchantments seemed to the musketeer the result of the greatest efforts of the human mind. He felt in a dreamy, almost poetical, frame of mind. The idea that Porthos was living in so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of Porthos, showing how tremendously true it is, that even the very highest orders of minds are not quite exempt from the influence of surroundings. D’Artagnan found the door, and on, or rather in the door, a kind of spring which he detected; having touched it, the door flew open. D’Artagnan entered, closed the door behind him, and advanced into a pavilion built in a circular form, in which no other sound could be heard but cascades and the songs of birds. At the door of the pavilion he met a lackey.  “It is here, I believe,” said D’Artagnan, without hesitation, “that M. le Baron du Vallon is staying?”  “Yes, monsieur,” answered the lackey.  “Have the goodness to tell him that M. le Chevalier d’Artagnan, captain of the king’s musketeers, is waiting to see him.”  D’Artagnan was introduced into the _salon_, and had not long to remain in expectation: a well-remembered step shook the floor of the adjoining room, a door opened, or rather flew open, and Porthos appeared and threw himself into his friend’s arms with a sort of embarrassment which did not ill become him. “You here?” he exclaimed.  “And you?” replied D’Artagnan. “Ah, you sly fellow!”  “Yes,” said Porthos, with a somewhat embarrassed smile; “yes, you see I am staying in M. Fouquet’s house, at which you are not a little surprised, I suppose?”  “Not at all; why should you not be one of M. Fouquet’s friends? M. Fouquet has a very large number, particularly among clever men.”  Porthos had the modesty not to take the compliment to himself. “Besides,” he added, “you saw me at Belle-Isle.”  “A greater reason for my believing you to be one of M. Fouquet’s friends.”  “The fact is, I am acquainted with him,” said Porthos, with a certain embarrassment of manner.  “Ah, friend Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “how treacherously you have behaved towards me.”  “In what way?” exclaimed Porthos.  “What! you complete so admirable a work as the fortifications of Belle-Isle, and you did not tell me of it!” Porthos colored. “Nay, more than that,” continued D’Artagnan, “you saw me out yonder, you know I am in the king’s service, and yet you could not guess that the king, jealously desirous of learning the name of the man whose abilities had wrought a work of which he heard the most wonderful accounts,--you could not guess, I say, that the king sent me to learn who this man was?”  “What! the king sent you to learn--”  “Of course; but don’t let us speak of that any more.”  “Not speak of it!” said Porthos; “on the contrary, we will speak of it; and so the king knew that we were fortifying Belle-Isle?”  “Of course; does not the king know everything?”  “But he did not know who was fortifying it?”  “No, he only suspected, from what he had been told of the nature of the works, that it was some celebrated soldier or another.”  “The devil!” said Porthos, “if I had only known that!”  “You would not have run away from Vannes as you did, perhaps?”  “No; what did you say when you couldn’t find me?”  “My dear fellow, I reflected.”  “Ah, indeed; you reflect, do you? Well, and what did that reflection lead to?”  “It led me to guess the whole truth.”  “Come, then, tell me what did you guess after all?” said Porthos, settling himself into an armchair, and assuming the airs of a sphinx.  “I guessed, in the first place, that you were fortifying Belle-Isle.”  “There was no great difficulty in that, for you saw me at work.”  “Wait a minute; I also guessed something else,--that you were fortifying Belle-Isle by M. Fouquet’s orders.”  “That’s true.”  “But even that is not all. Whenever I feel myself in trim for guessing, I do not stop on my road; and so I guessed that M. Fouquet wished to preserve the most absolute secrecy respecting these fortifications.”  “I believe that was his intention, in fact,” said Porthos.  “Yes, but do you know why he wished to keep it secret?”  “In order it should not become known, perhaps,” said Porthos.  “That was his principal reason. But his wish was subservient to a bit of generosity--”  “In fact,” said Porthos, “I have heard it said that M. Fouquet was a very generous man.”  “To a bit of generosity he wished to exhibit towards the king.”  “Oh, oh!”  “You seem surprised at that?”  “Yes.”  “And you didn’t guess?”  “No.”  “Well, I know it, then.”  “You are a wizard.”  “Not at all, I assure you.”  “How do you know it, then?”  “By a very simple means. I heard M. Fouquet himself say so to the king.”  “Say what to the king?”  “That he fortified Belle-Isle on his majesty’s account, and that he had made him a present of Belle Isle.”  “And you heard M. Fouquet say that to the king?”  “In those very words. He even added: ‘Belle-Isle has been fortified by an engineer, one of my friends, a man of a great deal of merit, whom I shall ask your majesty’s permission to present to you.’  “‘What is his name?’ said the king.  “‘The Baron du Vallon,’ M. Fouquet replied.  “‘Very well,’ returned his majesty, ‘you will present him to me.’”  “The king said that?”  “Upon the word of a D’Artagnan!”  “Oh, oh!” said Porthos. “Why have I not been presented, then?”  “Have they not spoken to you about this presentation?”  “Yes, certainly; but I am always kept waiting for it.”  “Be easy, it will be sure to come.”  “Humph! humph!” grumbled Porthos, which D’Artagnan pretended not to hear; and, changing the conversation, he said, “You seem to be living in a very solitary place here, my dear fellow?”  “I always preferred retirement. I am of a melancholy disposition,”  replied Porthos, with a sigh.  “Really, that is odd,” said D’Artagnan, “I never remarked that before.”  “It is only since I have taken to reading,” said Porthos, with a thoughtful air.  “But the labors of the mind have not affected the health of the body, I trust?”  “Not in the slightest degree.”  “Your strength is as great as ever?”  “Too great, my friend, too great.”  “Ah! I had heard that, for a short time after your arrival--”  “That I could hardly move a limb, I suppose?”  “How was it?” said D’Artagnan, smiling, “and why was it you could not move?”  Porthos, perceiving that he had made a mistake, wished to correct it. “Yes, I came from Belle-Isle upon very hard horses,” he said, “and that fatigued me.”  “I am no longer astonished, then, since I, who followed you, found seven or eight lying dead on the road.”  “I am very heavy, you know,” said Porthos.  “So that you were bruised all over.”  “My marrow melted, and that made me very ill.”  “Poor Porthos! But how did Aramis act towards you under those circumstances?”  “Very well, indeed. He had me attended to by M. Fouquet’s own doctor. But just imagine, at the end of a week I could not breathe any longer.”  “What do you mean?”  “The room was too small; I had absorbed every atom of air.”  “Indeed?”  “I was told so, at least; and so I was removed into another apartment.”  “Where you were able to breathe, I hope and trust?”  “Yes, more freely; but no exercise--nothing to do. The doctor pretended that I was not to stir; I, on the contrary, felt that I was stronger than ever; that was the cause of a very serious accident.”  “What accident?”  “Fancy, my dear fellow, that I revolted against the directions of that ass of a doctor, and I resolved to go out, whether it suited him or not: and, consequently, I told the valet who waited on me to bring me my clothes.”  “You were quite naked, then?”  “Oh, no! on the contrary, I had a magnificent dressing-gown to wear. The lackey obeyed; I dressed myself in my own clothes, which had become too large for me; but a strange circumstance had happened,--my feet had become too large.”  “Yes, I quite understand.”  “And my boots too small.”  “You mean your feet were still swollen?”  “Exactly; you have hit it.”  “_Pardieu!_ And is that the accident you were going to tell me about?”  “Oh, yes; I did not make the same reflection you have done. I said to myself: ‘Since my feet have entered my boots ten times, there is no reason why they should not go in the eleventh.’”  “Allow me to tell you, my dear Porthos, that on this occasion you failed in your logic.”  “In short, then, they placed me opposite to a part of the room which was partitioned; I tried to get my boot on; I pulled it with my hands, I pushed with all the strength of the muscles of my leg, making the most unheard-of efforts, when suddenly the two tags of my boot remained in my hands, and my foot struck out like a ballista.”  “How learned you are in fortification, dear Porthos.”  “My foot darted out like a ballista, and came against the partition, which it broke in; I really thought that, like Samson, I had demolished the temple. And the number of pictures, the quantity of china, vases of flowers, carpets, and window-panes that fell down were really wonderful.”  “Indeed!”  “Without reckoning that on the other side of the partition was a small table laden with porcelain--”  “Which you knocked over?”  “Which I dashed to the other side of the room,” said Porthos,"]]]
