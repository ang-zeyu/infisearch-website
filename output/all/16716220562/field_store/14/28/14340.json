But when somebody wanted to collect on that policy, the     claims investigator suddenly became a member of ..._   The RISK PROFESSION  By DONALD E. WESTLAKE   Mister Henderson called me into his office my third day back in Tangiers. That was a day and a half later than I'd expected. Roving claims investigators for Tangiers Mutual Insurance Corporation don't usually get to spend more than thirty-six consecutive hours at home base.  Henderson was jovial but stern. That meant he was happy with the job I'd just completed, and that he was pretty sure I'd find some crooked shenanigans on this next assignment. That didn't please me. I'm basically a plain-living type, and I hate complications. I almost wished for a second there that I was back on Fire and Theft in Greater New York. But I knew better than that. As a roving claim investigator, I avoided the more stultifying paper work inherent in this line of work and had the additional luxury of an expense account nobody ever questioned.  It made working for a living almost worthwhile.  When I was settled in the chair beside his desk, Henderson said, \"That was good work you did on Luna, Ged. Saved the company a pretty pence.\"  I smiled modestly and said, \"Thank you, sir.\" And reflected to myself for the thousandth time that the company could do worse than split that saving with the guy who'd made it possible. Me, in other words.  \"Got a tricky one this time, Ged,\" said my boss. He had done his back-patting, now we got down to business. He peered keenly at me, or at least as keenly as a round-faced tiny-eyed fat man _can_ peer. \"What do you know about the Risk Profession Retirement Plan?\" he asked me.  \"I've heard of it,\" I said truthfully. \"That's about all.\"  He nodded. \"Most of the policies are sold off-planet, of course. It's a form of insurance for non-insurables. Spaceship crews, asteroid prospectors, people like that.\"  \"I see,\" I said, unhappily. I knew right away this meant I was going to have to go off-Earth again. I'm a one-gee boy all the way. Gravity changes get me in the solar plexus. I get g-sick at the drop of an elevator.         *       *       *  \"Here's the way it works,\" he went on, either not noticing my sad face or choosing to ignore it. \"The client pays a monthly premium. He can be as far ahead or as far behind in his payments as he wants--the policy has no lapse clause--just so he's all paid up by the Target Date. The Target Date is a retirement age, forty-five or above, chosen by the client himself. After the Target Date, he stops paying premiums, and we begin to pay him a monthly retirement check, the amount determined by the amount paid into the policy, his age at retiring, and so on. Clear?\"  I nodded, looking for the gimmick that made this a paying proposition for good old Tangiers Mutual.  \"The Double R-P--that's what we call it around the office here--assures the client that he won't be reduced to panhandling in his old age, should his other retirement plans fall through. For Belt prospectors, of course, this means the big strike, which maybe one in a hundred find. For the man who never does make that big strike, this is something to fall back on. He can come home to Earth and retire, with a guaranteed income for the rest of his life.\"  I nodded again, like a good company man.  \"Of course,\" said Henderson, emphasizing this point with an upraised chubby finger, \"these men are still uninsurables. This is a retirement plan only, not an insurance policy. There is no beneficiary other than the client himself.\"  And there was the gimmick. I knew a little something of the actuarial statistics concerning uninsurables, particularly Belt prospectors. Not many of them lived to be forty-five, and the few who would survive the Belt and come home to collect the retirement wouldn't last more than a year or two. A man who's spent the last twenty or thirty years on low-gee asteroids just shrivels up after a while when he tries to live on Earth.  It needed a company like Tangiers Mutual to dream up a racket like that. The term \"uninsurables\" to most insurance companies means those people whose jobs or habitats make them too likely as prospects for obituaries. To Tangiers Mutual, uninsurables are people who have money the company can't get at.  \"Now,\" said Henderson importantly, \"we come to the problem at hand.\" He ruffled his up-to-now-neat In basket and finally found the folder he wanted. He studied the blank exterior of this folder for a few seconds, pursing his lips at it, and said, \"One of our clients under the Double R-P was a man named Jafe McCann.\"  \"Was?\" I echoed.  He squinted at me, then nodded at my sharpness. \"That's right, he's dead.\" He sighed heavily and tapped the folder with all those pudgy fingers. \"Normally,\" he said, \"that would be the end of it. File closed. However, this time there are complications.\"  Naturally. Otherwise, he wouldn't be telling _me_ about it. But Henderson couldn't be rushed, and I knew it. I kept the alert look on my face and thought of other things, while waiting for him to get to the point.  \"Two weeks after Jafe McCann's death,\" Henderson said, \"we received a cash-return form on his policy.\"  \"A cash-return form?\" I'd never heard of such a thing. It didn't sound like anything Tangiers Mutual would have anything to do with. We _never_ return cash.         *       *       *  \"It's something special in this case,\" he explained. \"You see, this isn't an insurance policy, it's a retirement plan, and the client can withdraw from the retirement plan at any time, and have seventy-five per cent of his paid-up premiums returned to him. It's, uh, the law in plans such as this.\"  \"Oh,\" I said. That explained it. A law that had snuck through the World Finance Code Commission while the insurance lobby wasn't looking.  \"But you see the point,\" said Henderson. \"This cash-return form arrived two weeks after the client's death.\"  \"You said there weren't any beneficiaries,\" I pointed out.  \"Of course. But the form was sent in by the man's partner, one Ab Karpin. McCann left a hand-written will bequeathing all his possessions to Karpin. Since, according to Karpin, this was done before McCann's death, the premium money cannot be considered part of the policy, but as part of McCann's cash-on-hand. And Karpin wants it.\"  \"It can't be that much, can it?\" I asked. I was trying my best to point out to him that the company would spend more than it would save if it sent me all the way out to the asteroids, a prospect I could feel coming and one which I wasn't ready to cry hosannah over.  \"McCann died,\" Henderson said ponderously, \"at the age of fifty-six. He had set his retirement age at sixty. He took out the policy at the age of thirty-four, with monthly payments of fifty credits. Figure it out for yourself.\"  I did--in my head--and came up with a figure of thirteen thousand and two hundred credits. Seventy-five per cent of that would be nine thousand and nine hundred credits. Call it ten thousand credits even.  I had to admit it. It was worth the trip.  \"I see,\" I said sadly.  \"Now,\" said Henderson, \"the conditions--the circumstances--of McCann's death are somewhat suspicious. And so is the cash-return form itself.\"  \"There's a chance it's a forgery?\"  \"One would think so,\" he said. \"But our handwriting experts have worn themselves out with that form, comparing it with every other single scrap of McCann's writing they can find. And their conclusion is that not only is it genuinely McCann's handwriting, but it is McCann's handwriting at age fifty-six.\"  \"So McCann must have written it,\" I said. \"Under duress, do you think?\"  \"I have no idea,\" said Henderson complacently. \"That's what you're supposed to find out. Oh, there's just one more thing.\"  I did my best to make my ears perk.  \"I told you that McCann's death occurred under somewhat suspicious circumstances.\"  \"Yes,\" I agreed, \"you did.\"  \"McCann and Karpin,\" he said, \"have been partners--unincorporated, of course--for the last fifteen years. They had found small rare-metal deposits now and again, but they had never found that one big strike all the Belt prospectors waste their lives looking for. Not until the day before McCann died.\"  \"Ah hah,\" I said. \"_Then_ they found the big strike.\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"And McCann's death?\"  \"Accidental.\"  \"Sure,\" I said. \"What proof have we got?\"  \"None. The body is lost in space. And law is few and far between that far out.\"  \"So all we've got is this guy Karpin's word for how McCann died, is that it?\"  \"That's all we have. So far.\"  \"Sure. And now you want me to go on out there and find out what's cooking, and see if I can maybe save the company ten thousand credits.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Henderson.         *       *       *       *       *  The copter took me to the spaceport west of Cairo, and there I boarded the good ship _Demeter_ for Luna City and points Out. I loaded up on g-sickness pills and they worked fine. I was sick as a dog.  By the time we got to Atronics City, my insides had grown resigned to their fate. As long as I didn't try to eat, my stomach would leave me alone.  Atronics City was about as depressing as a Turkish bath with all the lights on. It stood on a chunk of rock a couple of miles thick, and it looked like nothing more in this world than a welder's practice range.  From the outside, Atronics City is just a derby-shaped dome of nickel-iron, black and kind of dirty-looking. I suppose a transparent dome would have been more fun, but the builders of the company cities in the asteroids were businessmen, and they weren't concerned with having fun. There's nothing to look at outside the dome but chunks of rock and the blackness of space anyway, and you've got all this cheap iron floating around in the vicinity, and all a dome's supposed to do is keep the air in. Besides, though the Belt isn't as crowded as a lot"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27089"],["title","The Risk Profession (#1)"],["body"," people think, there _is_ quite a lot of debris rushing here and there, bumping into things, and a transparent dome would just get all scratched up, not to mention punctured.  From the inside, Atronics City is even jollier. There's the top level, directly under the dome, which is mainly parking area for scooters and tuggers of various kinds, plus the office shacks of the Assayer's Office, the Entry Authority, the Industry Troopers and so on. The next three levels have all been burned into the bowels of the planetoid.  Level two is the Atronics plant, and a noisy plant it is. Level three is the shopping and entertainment area--grocery stores and clothing stores and movie theaters and bars--and level four is housing, two rooms and kitchen for the unmarried, four rooms and kitchen plus one room for each child for the married.  All of these levels have one thing in common. Square corners, painted olive drab. The total effect of the place is suffocating. You feel like you're stuck in the middle of a stack of packing crates.  Most of the people living in Atronics City work, of course, for International Atronics, Incorporated. The rest of them work in the service occupations--running the bars and grocery stores and so on--that keep the company employees alive and relatively happy.  Wages come high in the places like Atronics City. Why not, the raw materials come practically for free. And as for working conditions, well, take a for instance. How do you make a vacuum tube? You fiddle with the innards and surround it all with glass. And how do you get the air out? No problem, boy, there wasn't any air in there to begin with.  At any rate, there I was at Atronics City. That was as far as _Demeter_ would take me. Now, while the ship went on to Ludlum City and Chemisant City and the other asteroid business towns, my two suitcases and I dribbled down the elevator to my hostelry on level four.         *       *       *  Have you ever taken an elevator ride when the gravity is practically non-existent? Well, don't. You see, the elevator manages to sink faster than you do. It isn't being _lowered_ down to level four, it's being _pulled_ down.  What this means is that the suitcases have to be lashed down with the straps provided, and you and the operator have to hold on tight to the hand-grips placed here and there around the wall. Otherwise, you'd clonk your head on the ceiling.  But we got to level four at last, and off I went with my suitcases and the operator's directions. The suitcases weighed about half an ounce each out here, and I felt as though I weighed the same. Every time I raised a foot, I was sure I was about to go sailing into a wall. Local citizens eased by me, their feet occasionally touching the iron pavement as they soared along, and I gave them all dirty looks.  Level four was nothing but walls and windows. The iron floor went among these walls and windows in a straight straight line, bisecting other \"streets\" at perfect right angles, and the iron ceiling sixteen feet up was lined with a double row of fluorescent tubes. I was beginning to feel claustrophobic already.  The Chalmers Hotel--named for an Atronics vice-president--had received my advance registration, which was nice. I was shown to a second-floor room--nothing on level four had more than two stories--and was left to unpack my suitcases as best I may.  I had decided to spend a day or two at Atronics City before taking a scooter out to Ab Karpin's claim. Atronics City had been Karpin's and McCann's home base. All of McCann's premium payments had been mailed from here, and the normal mailing address for both of them was GPO Atronics City.  I wanted to know as much as possible about Ab Karpin before I went out to see him. And Atronics City seemed like the best place to get my information.  But not today. Today, my stomach was very unhappy, and my head was on sympathy strike. Today, I was going to spend my time exclusively in bed, trying not to float up to the ceiling.         *       *       *       *       *  The Mapping & Registry Office, it seemed to me the next day, was the best place to start. This was where prospectors filed their claims, but it was a lot more than that. The waiting room of M&R was the unofficial club of the asteroid prospectors. This is where they met with one another, talked together about the things that prospectors discuss, and made and dissolved their transient partnerships.  In this way, Karpin and McCann were unusual. They had maintained their partnership for fifteen years. That was about sixty times longer than most such arrangements lasted.  Searching the asteroid chunks for rare and valuable metals is basically pretty lonely work, and it's inevitable that the prospectors will every once in a while get hungry for human company and decide to try a team operation. But, at the same time, work like this attracts people who don't get along very well with human company. So the partnerships come and go, and the hatreds flare and are forgotten, and the normal prospecting team lasts an average of three months.  At any rate, it was to the Mapping & Registry Office that I went first. And, since that office was up on the first level, I went by elevator.  Riding _up_ in that elevator was a heck of a lot more fun than riding down. The elevator whipped up like mad, the floor pressed against the soles of my feet, and it felt almost like good old Earth for a second or two there. But then the elevator stopped, and I held on tight to the hand-grips to keep from shooting through the top of the blasted thing.  The operator--a phlegmatic sort--gave me directions to the M&R, and off I went, still trying to figure out how to sail along as gracefully as the locals.  The Mapping & Registry Office occupied a good-sized shack over near the dome wall, next to the entry lock. I pushed open the door and went on in.  The waiting room was cozy and surprisingly large, large enough to comfortably hold the six maroon leather sofas scattered here and there on the pale green carpet, flanked by bronze ashtray stands. There were only six prospectors here at the moment, chatting together in two groups of three, and they all looked alike. Grizzled, ageless, watery-eyed, their clothing clean but baggy. I passed them and went on to the desk at the far end, behind which sat a young man in official gray, slowly turning the crank of a microfilm reader.  He looked up at my approach. I flashed my company identification and asked to speak to the manager. He went away, came back, and ushered me into an office which managed to be Spartan and sumptuous at the same time. The walls had been plastic-painted in textured brown, the iron floor had been lushly carpeted in gray, and the desk had been covered with a simulated wood coating.  The manager--a man named Teaking--went well with the office. His face and hands were spare and lean, but his uniform was immaculate, covered with every curlicue the regulations allowed. He welcomed me politely, but curiously, and I said, \"I wonder if you know a prospector named Ab Karpin?\"  \"Karpin? Of course. He and old Jafe McCann--pity about McCann. I hear he got killed.\"  \"Yes, he did.\"  \"And that's what you're here for, eh?\" He nodded sagely. \"I didn't know the Belt boys could get insurance,\" he said.  \"It isn't exactly that,\" I said. \"This concerns a retirement plan, and--well, the details don't matter.\" Which, I hoped, would end his curiosity in that line. \"I was hoping you could give me some background on Karpin. And on McCann, too, for that matter.\"  He grinned a bit. \"You saw the men sitting outside?\"  I nodded.  \"Then you've seen Karpin and McCann. Exactly the same. It doesn't matter if a man's thirty or sixty or what. It doesn't matter what he was like before he came out here. If he's been here a few years, he looks exactly like the bunch you saw outside there.\"  \"That's appearance,\" I said. \"What I was looking for was personality.\"  \"Same thing,\" he said. \"All of them. Close-mouthed, anti-social, fiercely independent, incurably romantic, always convinced that the big strike is just a piece of rock away. McCann, now, he was a bit more realistic than most. He'd be the one I'd expect to take out a retirement policy. A real pence-pincher, that one, though I shouldn't say it as he's dead. But that's the way he was. Brighter than most Belt boys when it came to money matters. I've seen him haggle over a new piece of equipment for their scooter, or some repair work, or some such thing, and he was a wonder to watch.\"  \"And Karpin?\" I asked him.  \"A prospector,\" he said, as though that answered my question. \"Same as everybody else. Not as sharp as McCann when it came to money. That's why all the money stuff in the partnership was handled by McCann. But Karpin was one of the sharpest boys in the business when it came to mineralogy. He knew rocks you and I never heard of, and most times he knew them by sight. Almost all of the Belt boys are college grads--you've got to know what you're looking for out here and what it looks like when you've found it--but Karpin has practically all of them beat. He's _sharp_.\"         *       *       *  \"Sounds like a good team,\" I said.  \"I guess that's why they stayed together so long,\" he said. \"They complemented each other.\" He leaned forward, the inevitable prelude to a confidential remark. \"I'll tell you something off the record, Mister,\" he said. \"Those two were smarter than they knew. Their partnership was never legalized, it was never anything more than a piece of paper. And there's a bunch of fellas around here mighty unhappy about that today. Jafe McCann is the one who handled all the money matters, like I said. He's got IOU's all over town.\"  \"And they can't collect from Karpin?\"  He nodded. \"Jafe McCann died just a bit too soon. He was sharp and cheap, but he was honest. If he'd lived, he would have repaid all his debts, I'm sure of it. And if this strike they made is as good as I hear, he would"]]]
