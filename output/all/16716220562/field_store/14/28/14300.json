When we know, for instance, that Fahrenheit’s scale is divided into 212 degrees, in which 32° corresponds with the freezing point, and 212° with the point of boiling water: and that Reaumur’s is divided only into 80 degrees, in which 0° denotes the freezing point, and 80° that of boiling water, it is easy to compare the two scales together, and reduce the one into the other. But, for greater convenience, thermometers are sometimes constructed with both these scales, one on either side of the tube; so that the correspondence of the different degrees of the two scales is thus instantly seen. Here is one of these scales, (PLATE II. Fig. 1.) by which you can at once perceive that each degree of Reaumur’s corresponds to 2¼ of Fahrenheit’s division. But I believe the French have, of late, given the preference to what they call the centigrade scale, in which the space between the freezing and the boiling point is divided into 100 degrees.    [Illustration: Plate II. Vol. I. p. 42.    Fig. 1. Thermometer.   Fahrenheit’s Scale.   Reaumur’s Scale.   Boiling point of Water   Freezing point of Water    Fig. 2. Differential Thermometer.]  CAROLINE.  That seems to me the most reasonable division, and I cannot guess why the freezing point is called 32°, or what advantage is derived from it.  MRS. B.  There really is no advantage in it; and it originated in a mistaken opinion of the instrument-maker, Fahrenheit, who first constructed these thermometers. He mixed snow and salt together, and produced by that means a degree of cold which he concluded was the greatest possible, and therefore made his scale begin from that point. Between that and boiling water he made 212 degrees, and the freezing point was found to be at 32°.  EMILY.  Are spirit of wine, and mercury, the only liquids used in the construction of thermometers?  MRS. B.  I believe they are the only liquids now in use, though some others, such as linseed oil, would make tolerable thermometers: but for experiments in which a very quick and delicate test of the changes of temperature is required, air is the fluid sometimes employed. The bulb of air thermometers is filled with common air only, and its expansion and contraction are indicated by a small drop of any coloured liquor, which is suspended within the tube, and moves up and down, according as the air within the bulb and tube expands or contracts. But in general, air thermometers, however sensible to changes of temperature, are by no means accurate in their indications.  I can, however, show you an air thermometer of a very peculiar construction, which is remarkably well adapted for some chemical experiments, as it is equally delicate and accurate in its indications.  CAROLINE.  It looks like a double thermometer reversed, the tube being bent, and having a large bulb at each of its extremities. (PLATE II. Fig. 2.)  EMILY.  Why do you call it an air thermometer; the tube contains a coloured liquid?  MRS. B.  But observe that the bulbs are filled with air, the liquid being confined to a portion of the tube, and answering only the purpose of showing, by its motion in the tube, the comparative dilatation or contraction of the air within the bulbs, which afford an indication of their relative temperature. Thus if you heat the bulb A, by the warmth of your hand, the fluid will rise towards the bulb B, and the contrary will happen if you reverse the experiment.  But if, on the contrary, both tubes are of the same temperature, as is the case now, the coloured liquid, suffering an equal pressure on each side, no change of level takes place.  CAROLINE.  This instrument appears, indeed, uncommonly delicate. The fluid is set in motion by the mere approach of my hand.  MRS. B.  You must observe, however, that this thermometer cannot indicate the temperature of any particular body, or of the medium in which it is immersed; it serves only to point out the _difference_ of temperature between the two bulbs, when placed under different circumstances. For this reason it has been called _differential_ thermometer. You will see by-and-bye to what particular purposes this instrument applies.  EMILY.  But do common thermometers indicate the exact quantity of caloric contained either in the atmosphere, or in any body with which they are in contact?  MRS. B.  No: first, because there are other modifications of caloric which do not affect the thermometer; and, secondly, because the temperature of a body, as indicated by the thermometer, is only relative. When, for instance, the thermometer remains stationary at the freezing point, we know that the atmosphere (or medium in which it is placed, whatever it may be) is as cold as freezing water; and when it stands at the boiling point, we know that this medium is as hot as boiling water; but we do not know the positive quantity of heat contained either in freezing or boiling water, any more than we know the real extremes of heat and cold; and consequently we cannot determine that of the body in which the thermometer is placed.  CAROLINE.  I do not quite understand this explanation.  MRS. B.  Let us compare a thermometer to a well, in which the water rises to different heights, according as it is more or less supplied by the spring which feeds it: if the depth of the well is unfathomable, it must be impossible to know the absolute quantity of water it contains; yet we can with the greatest accuracy measure the number of feet the water has risen or fallen in the well at any time, and consequently know the precise quantity of its increase or diminution, without having the least knowledge of the whole quantity of water it contains.  CAROLINE.  Now I comprehend it very well; nothing appears to me to explain a thing so clearly as a comparison.  EMILY.  But will thermometers bear any degree of heat?  MRS. B.  No; for if the temperature were much above the highest degree marked on the scale of the thermometer, the mercury would burst the tube in an attempt to ascend. And at any rate, no thermometer can be applied to temperatures higher than the boiling point of the liquid used in its construction, for the steam, on the liquid beginning to boil, would burst the tube. In furnaces, or whenever any very high temperature is to be measured, a pyrometer, invented by Wedgwood, is used for that purpose. It is made of a certain composition of baked clay, which has the peculiar property of contracting by heat, so that the degree of contraction of this substance indicates the temperature to which it has been exposed.  EMILY.  But is it possible for a body to contract by heat? I thought that heat dilated all bodies whatever.  MRS. B.  This is not an exception to the rule. You must recollect that the bulk of the clay is not compared, whilst hot, with that which it has when cold; but it is from the change which the clay has undergone by _having been_ heated that the indications of this instrument are derived. This change consists in a beginning fusion which tends to unite the particles of clay more closely, thus rendering it less pervious or spongy.  Clay is to be considered as a spongy body, having many interstices or pores, from its having contained water when soft. These interstices are by heat lessened, and would by extreme heat be entirely obliterated.  CAROLINE.  And how do you ascertain the degrees of contraction of Wedgwood’s pyrometer?  MRS. B.  The dimensions of a piece of clay are measured by a scale graduated on the side of a tapered groove, formed in a brass ruler; the more the clay is contracted by the heat, the further it will descend into the narrow part of the tube.  Before we quit the subject of expansion, I must observe to you that, as liquids expand more readily than solids, so elastic fluids, whether air or vapour, are the most expansible of all bodies.  It may appear extraordinary that all elastic fluids whatever, undergo the same degree of expansion from equal augmentations of temperature.  EMILY.  I suppose, then, that all elastic fluids are of the same density?  MRS. B.  Very far from it; they vary in density, more than either liquids or solids. The uniformity of their expansibility, which at first may appear singular, is, however, readily accounted for. For if the different susceptibilities of expansion of bodies arise from their various degrees of attraction of cohesion, no such difference can be expected in elastic fluids, since in these the attraction of cohesion does not exist, their particles being on the contrary possessed of an elastic or repulsive power; they will therefore all be equally expanded by equal degrees of caloric.  EMILY.  True; as there is no power opposed to the expansive force of caloric in elastic bodies, its effect must be the same in all of them.  MRS. B.  Let us now proceed to examine the other properties of free caloric.  Free caloric always tends to diffuse itself equally, that is to say, when two bodies are of different temperatures, the warmer gradually parts with its heat to the colder, till they are both brought to the same temperature. Thus, when a thermometer is applied to a hot body, it receives caloric; when to a cold one, it communicates part of its own caloric, and this communication continues until the thermometer and the body arrive at the same temperature.  EMILY.  Cold, then, is nothing but a negative quality, simply implying the absence of heat.  MRS. B.  Not the total absence, but a diminution of heat; for we know of no body in which some caloric may not be discovered.  CAROLINE.  But when I lay my hand on this marble table I feel it _positively_ cold, and cannot conceive that there is any caloric in it.  MRS. B.  The cold you experience consists in the loss of caloric that your hand sustains in an attempt to bring its temperature to an equilibrium with the marble. If you lay a piece of ice upon it, you will find that the contrary effect will take place; the ice will be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],["title","Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#8)"],["body","by the heat which it abstracts from the marble.  CAROLINE.  Is it not in this case the air of the room, which being warmer than the marble, melts the ice?  MRS. B.  The air certainly acts on the surface which is exposed to it, but the table melts that part with which it is in contact.  CAROLINE.  But why does caloric tend to an equilibrium? It cannot be on the same principle as other fluids, since it has no weight?  MRS. B.  Very true, Caroline, that is an excellent objection. You might also, with some propriety, object to the term _equilibrium_ being applied to a body that is without weight; but I know of no expression that would explain my meaning so well. You must consider it, however, in a figurative rather than a literal sense; its strict meaning is an _equal diffusion_. We cannot, indeed, well say by what power it diffuses itself equally, though it is not surprising that it should go from the parts which have the most to those which have the least. This subject is best explained by a theory suggested by Professor Prevost of Geneva, which is now, I believe, generally adopted.  According to this theory, caloric is composed of particles perfectly separate from each other, every one of which moves with a rapid velocity in a certain direction. These directions vary as much as imagination can conceive, the result of which is, that there are rays or lines of these particles moving with immense velocity in every possible direction. Caloric is thus universally diffused, so that when any portion of space happens to be in the neighbourhood of another, which contains more caloric, the colder portion receives a quantity of calorific rays from the latter, sufficient to restore an equilibrium of temperature. This radiation does not only take place in free space, but extends also to bodies of every kind. Thus you may suppose all bodies whatever constantly radiating caloric: those that are of the same temperature give out and absorb equal quantities, so that no variation of temperature is produced in them; but when one body contains more free caloric than another, the exchange is always in favour of the colder body, until an equilibrium is effected; this you found to be the case when the marble table cooled your hand, and again when it melted the ice.  CAROLINE.  This reciprocal radiation surprises me extremely; I thought, from what you first said, that the hotter bodies alone emitted rays of caloric which were absorbed by the colder; for it seems unnatural that a hot body should receive any caloric from a cold one, even though it should return a greater quantity.  MRS. B.  It may at first appear so, but it is no more extraordinary than that a candle should send forth rays of light to the sun, which, you know, must necessarily happen.  CAROLINE.  Well, Mrs. B--, I believe that I must give up the point. But I wish I could _see_ these rays of caloric; I should then have greater faith in them.  MRS. B.  Will you give no credit to any sense but that of sight? You may feel the rays of caloric which you receive from any body of a temperature higher than your own; the loss of the caloric you part with in return, it is true, is not perceptible; for as you gain more than you lose, instead of suffering a diminution, you are really making an acquisition of caloric. It is, therefore, only when you are parting with it to a body of a lower temperature, that you are sensible of the sensation of cold, because you then sustain an absolute loss of caloric.  EMILY.  And in this case we cannot be sensible of the small quantity of heat we receive in exchange from the colder body, because it serves only to diminish the loss.  MRS. B.  Very well, indeed, Emily. Professor Pictet, of Geneva, has made some very interesting experiments, which prove not only that caloric radiates from all bodies whatever, but that these rays may be reflected, according to the laws of optics, in the same manner as light. I shall repeat these experiments before you, having procured mirrors fit for the purpose; and it will afford us an opportunity of using the differential thermometer, which is particularly well adapted for these experiments. --I place an iron bullet, (PLATE III. Fig. 1.) about two inches in diameter, and heated to a degree not sufficient to render it luminous, in the focus of this large metallic concave mirror. The rays of heat which fall on this mirror are reflected, agreeably to the property of concave mirrors, in a parallel direction, so as to fall on a similar mirror, which, you see, is placed opposite to the first, at the distance of about ten feet; thence the rays converge to the focus of the second mirror, in which I place one of the bulbs of this thermometer. Now, observe in what manner it is affected by the caloric which is reflected on it from the heated bullet. --The air is dilated in the bulb which we placed in the focus of the mirror, and the liquor rises considerably in the opposite leg.    [Illustration: Plate III. Vol. I. p. 54   Mr. Pictet’s Apparatus for the Reflection of Heat.    Fig. 1.   A.A. & B.B Concave mirrors fixed on stands.   C Heated Bullet placed in the focus of the mirror A.   D Thermometer, with its bulb placed in the focus of the mirror B.   1.2.3.4 Rays of Caloric radiating from the bullet & falling on the     mirror A.   5.6.7.8 The same rays reflected from the mirror A to the mirror B.   9.10.11.12 The same rays reflected by the mirror B to the     Thermometer.]  EMILY.  But would not the same effect take place, if the rays of caloric from the heated bullet fell directly on the thermometer, without the assistance of the mirrors?  MRS. B.  The effect would in that case be so trifling, at the distance at which the bullet and the thermometer are from each other, that it would be almost imperceptible. The mirrors, you know, greatly increase the effect, by collecting a large quantity of rays into a focus; place your hand in the focus of the mirror, and you will find it much hotter there than when you remove it nearer to the bullet.  EMILY.  That is very true; it appears extremely singular to feel the heat diminish in approaching the body from which it proceeds.  CAROLINE.  And the mirror which produces so much heat, by converging the rays, is itself quite cold.  MRS. B.  The same number of rays that are dispersed over the surface of the mirror are collected by it into the focus; but, if you consider how large a surface the mirror presents to the rays, and, consequently, how much they are diffused in comparison to what they are at the focus, which is little more than a point, I think you can no longer wonder that the focus should be so much hotter than the mirror.  The principal use of the mirrors in this experiment is, to prove that the calorific emanation is reflected in the same manner as light.  CAROLINE.  And the result, I think, is very conclusive.  MRS. B.  The experiment may be repeated with a wax taper instead of the bullet, with a view of separating the light from the caloric. For this purpose a transparent plate of glass must be interposed between the mirrors; for light, you know, passes with great facility through glass, whilst the transmission of caloric is almost wholly impeded by it. We shall find, however, in this experiment, that some few of the calorific rays pass through the glass together with the light, as the thermometer rises a little; but, as soon as the glass is removed, and a free passage left to the caloric, it will rise considerably higher.  EMILY.  This experiment, as well as that of Dr. Herschell’s, proves that light and heat may be separated; for in the latter experiment the separation was not perfect, any more than in that of Mr. Pictet.  CAROLINE.  I should like to repeat this experiment, with the difference of substituting a cold body instead of the hot one, to see whether cold would not be reflected as well as heat.  MRS. B.  That experiment was proposed to Mr. Pictet by an incredulous philosopher like yourself, and he immediately tried it by substituting a piece of ice in the place of the heated bullet.  CAROLINE.  Well, Mrs. B., and what was the result?  MRS. B.  That we shall see; I have procured some ice for the purpose.  EMILY.  The thermometer falls considerably!  CAROLINE.  And does not that prove that cold is not merely a _negative_ quality, implying simply an inferior degree of heat? The cold must be _positive_, since it is capable of reflection.  MRS. B.  So it at first appeared to Mr. Pictet; but upon a little consideration he found that it afforded only an additional proof of the reflection of heat: this I shall endeavour to explain to you.  According to Mr. Prevost’s theory, we suppose that all bodies whatever radiate caloric; the thermometer used in these experiments therefore emits calorific rays in the same manner as any other substance. When its temperature is in equilibrium with that of the surrounding bodies, it receives as much caloric as it parts with, and no change of temperature is produced. But when we introduce a body of a lower temperature, such as a piece of ice, which parts with less caloric than it receives, the consequence is, that its temperature is raised, whilst that of the surrounding bodies is proportionally lowered.  EMILY.  If, for instance, I was to bring a large piece of ice into this room, the ice would in time be melted, by absorbing caloric from the general radiation which is going on throughout the room; and as it would contribute very little caloric in return for what is absorbed, the room would necessarily be cooled by it.  MRS. B.  Just so; and as in consequence of the mirrors, a more considerable exchange of rays takes place between the ice and the thermometer, than between these and any of the surrounding bodies, the temperature of the thermometer must be more lowered than that of any other adjacent object.  CAROLINE.  I confess I do not perfectly understand your explanation.  MRS. B.  This experiment is exactly similar to that"]]]
