Alone, we should be helpless to injure the Ruler of Oz, but with the aid of the evil powers we can summon we shall easily succeed.\"  King Roquat was delighted with this idea, for he realized how clever it was.  \"Surely, Guph, you are the greatest General I have ever had!\" he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with joy.  \"You must go at once and make arrangements with the evil powers to assist us, and meantime I'll begin to dig the tunnel.\"  \"I thought you'd agree with me, Roquat,\" replied the new General. \"I'll start this very afternoon to visit the Chief of the Whimsies.\"    5.  How Dorothy Became a Princess  When the people of the Emerald City heard that Dorothy had returned to them every one was eager to see her, for the little girl was a general favorite in the Land of Oz.  From time to time some of the folk from the great outside world had found their way into this fairyland, but all except one had been companions of Dorothy and had turned out to be very agreeable people.  The exception I speak of was the wonderful Wizard of Oz, a sleight-of-hand performer from Omaha who went up in a balloon and was carried by a current of air to the Emerald City.  His queer and puzzling tricks made the people of Oz believe him a great wizard for a time, and he ruled over them until Dorothy arrived on her first visit and showed the Wizard to be a mere humbug.  He was a gentle, kind-hearted little man, and Dorothy grew to like him afterward.  When, after an absence, the Wizard returned to the Land of Oz, Ozma received him graciously and gave him a home in a part of the palace.  In addition to the Wizard two other personages from the outside world had been allowed to make their home in the Emerald City.  The first was a quaint Shaggy Man, whom Ozma had made the Governor of the Royal Storehouses, and the second a Yellow Hen named Billina, who had a fine house in the gardens back of the palace, where she looked after a large family.  Both these had been old comrades of Dorothy, so you see the little girl was quite an important personage in Oz, and the people thought she had brought them good luck, and loved her next best to Ozma.  During her several visits this little girl had been the means of destroying two wicked witches who oppressed the people, and she had discovered a live scarecrow who was now one of the most popular personages in all the fairy country.  With the Scarecrow's help she had rescued Nick Chopper, a Tin Woodman, who had rusted in a lonely forest, and the tin man was now the Emperor of the Country of the Winkies and much beloved because of his kind heart.  No wonder the people thought Dorothy had brought them good luck!  Yet, strange as it may seem, she had accomplished all these wonders not because she was a fairy or had any magical powers whatever, but because she was a simple, sweet and true little girl who was honest to herself and to all whom she met.  In this world in which we live simplicity and kindness are the only magic wands that work wonders, and in the Land of Oz Dorothy found these same qualities had won for her the love and admiration of the people. Indeed, the little girl had made many warm friends in the fairy country, and the only real grief the Ozites had ever experienced was when Dorothy left them and returned to her Kansas home.  Now she received a joyful welcome, although no one except Ozma knew at first that she had finally come to stay for good and all.  That evening Dorothy had many callers, and among them were such important people as Tiktok, a machine man who thought and spoke and moved by clockwork; her old companion the genial Shaggy Man; Jack Pumpkinhead, whose body was brush-wood and whose head was a ripe pumpkin with a face carved upon it; the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, two great beasts from the forest, who served Princess Ozma, and Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E.  This wogglebug was a remarkable creature.  He had once been a tiny little bug, crawling around in a school-room, but he was discovered and highly magnified so that he could be seen more plainly, and while in this magnified condition he had escaped.  He had always remained big, and he dressed like a dandy and was so full of knowledge and information (which are distinct acquirements) that he had been made a Professor and the head of the Royal College.  Dorothy had a nice visit with these old friends, and also talked a long time with the Wizard, who was little and old and withered and dried up, but as merry and active as a child.  Afterward, she went to see Billina's fast-growing family of chicks.  Toto, Dorothy's little black dog, also met with a cordial reception. Toto was an especial friend of the Shaggy Man, and he knew every one else.  Being the only dog in the Land of Oz, he was highly respected by the people, who believed animals entitled to every consideration if they behaved themselves properly.  Dorothy had four lovely rooms in the palace, which were always reserved for her use and were called \"Dorothy's rooms.\"  These consisted of a beautiful sitting room, a dressing room, a dainty bedchamber and a big marble bathroom.  And in these rooms were everything that heart could desire, placed there with loving thoughtfulness by Ozma for her little friend's use.  The royal dressmakers had the little girl's measure, so they kept the closets in her dressing room filled with lovely dresses of every description and suitable for every occasion.  No wonder Dorothy had refrained from bringing with her her old calico and gingham dresses!  Here everything that was dear to a little girl's heart was supplied in profusion, and nothing so rich and beautiful could ever have been found in the biggest department stores in America.  Of course Dorothy enjoyed all these luxuries, and the only reason she had heretofore preferred to live in Kansas was because her uncle and aunt loved her and needed her with them.  Now, however, all was to be changed, and Dorothy was really more delighted to know that her dear relatives were to share in her good fortune and enjoy the delights of the Land of Oz, than she was to possess such luxury for herself.  Next morning, at Ozma's request, Dorothy dressed herself in a pretty sky-blue gown of rich silk, trimmed with real pearls.  The buckles of her shoes were set with pearls, too, and more of these priceless gems were on a lovely coronet which she wore upon her forehead.  \"For,\" said her friend Ozma, \"from this time forth, my dear, you must assume your rightful rank as a Princess of Oz, and being my chosen companion you must dress in a way befitting the dignity of your position.\"  Dorothy agreed to this, although she knew that neither gowns nor jewels could make her anything else than the simple, unaffected little girl she had always been.  As soon as they had breakfasted--the girls eating together in Ozma's pretty boudoir--the Ruler of Oz said:  \"Now, dear friend, we will use the Magic Belt to transport your uncle and aunt from Kansas to the Emerald City.  But I think it would be fitting, in receiving such distinguished guests, for us to sit in my Throne Room.\"  \"Oh, they're not very 'stinguished, Ozma,\" said Dorothy.  \"They're just plain people, like me.\"  \"Being your friends and relatives, Princess Dorothy, they are certainly distinguished,\" replied the Ruler, with a smile.  \"They--they won't hardly know what to make of all your splendid furniture and things,\" protested Dorothy, gravely.  \"It may scare 'em to see your grand Throne Room, an' p'raps we'd better go into the back yard, Ozma, where the cabbages grow an' the chickens are playing.  Then it would seem more natural to Uncle Henry and Aunt Em.\"  \"No; they shall first see me in my Throne Room,\" replied Ozma, decidedly; and when she spoke in that tone Dorothy knew it was not wise to oppose her, for Ozma was accustomed to having her own way.  So together they went to the Throne Room, an immense domed chamber in the center of the palace.  Here stood the royal throne, made of solid gold and encrusted with enough precious stones to stock a dozen jewelry stores in our country.  Ozma, who was wearing the Magic Belt, seated herself in the throne, and Dorothy sat at her feet.  In the room were assembled many ladies and gentlemen of the court, clothed in rich apparel and wearing fine jewelry.  Two immense animals squatted, one on each side of the throne--the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger.  In a balcony high up in the dome an orchestra played sweet music, and beneath the dome two electric fountains sent sprays of colored perfumed water shooting up nearly as high as the arched ceiling.  \"Are you ready, Dorothy?\" asked the Ruler.  \"I am,\" replied Dorothy; \"but I don't know whether Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are ready.\"  \"That won't matter,\" declared Ozma.  \"The old life can have very little to interest them, and the sooner they begin the new life here the happier they will be.  Here they come, my dear!\"  As she spoke, there before the throne appeared Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, who for a moment stood motionless, glaring with white and startled faces at the scene that confronted them.  If the ladies and gentlemen present had not been so polite I am sure they would have laughed at the two strangers.  Aunt Em had her calico dress skirt \"tucked up,\" and she wore a faded, blue-checked apron.  Her hair was rather straggly and she had on a pair of Uncle Henry's old slippers.  In one hand she held a dish-towel and in the other a cracked earthenware plate, which she had been engaged in wiping when so suddenly transported to the Land of Oz.  Uncle Henry, when the summons came, had been out in the barn \"doin' chores.\"  He wore a ragged and much soiled straw hat, a checked shirt without any collar and blue overalls tucked into the tops of his old cowhide boots.  \"By gum!\" gasped Uncle Henry, looking around as if bewildered.  \"Well, I swan!\" gurgled Aunt Em in a hoarse,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],["title","The Emerald City of Oz (#5)"],["body","voice.  Then her eyes fell upon Dorothy, and she said: \"D-d-d-don't that look like our little girl--our Dorothy, Henry?\"  \"Hi, there--look out, Em!\" exclaimed the old man, as Aunt Em advanced a step; \"take care o' the wild beastses, or you're a goner!\"  But now Dorothy sprang forward and embraced and kissed her aunt and uncle affectionately, afterward taking their hands in her own.  \"Don't be afraid,\" she said to them.  \"You are now in the Land of Oz, where you are to live always, and be comfer'ble an' happy.  You'll never have to worry over anything again, 'cause there won't be anything to worry about.  And you owe it all to the kindness of my friend Princess Ozma.\"  Here she led them before the throne and continued:  \"Your Highness, this is Uncle Henry.  And this is Aunt Em.  They want to thank you for bringing them here from Kansas.\"  Aunt Em tried to \"slick\" her hair, and she hid the dish-towel and dish under her apron while she bowed to the lovely Ozma.  Uncle Henry took off his straw hat and held it awkwardly in his hands.  But the Ruler of Oz rose and came from her throne to greet her newly arrived guests, and she smiled as sweetly upon them as if they had been a king and queen.  \"You are very welcome here, where I have brought you for Princess Dorothy's sake,\" she said, graciously, \"and I hope you will be quite happy in your new home.\"  Then she turned to her courtiers, who were silently and gravely regarding the scene, and added: \"I present to my people our Princess Dorothy's beloved Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, who will hereafter be subjects of our kingdom.  It will please me to have you show them every kindness and honor in your power, and to join me in making them happy and contented.\"  Hearing this, all those assembled bowed low and respectfully to the old farmer and his wife, who bobbed their own heads in return.  \"And now,\" said Ozma to them, \"Dorothy will show you the rooms prepared for you.  I hope you will like them, and shall expect you to join me at luncheon.\"  So Dorothy led her relatives away, and as soon as they were out of the Throne Room and alone in the corridor, Aunt Em squeezed Dorothy's hand and said:  \"Child, child!  How in the world did we ever get here so quick?  And is it all real?  And are we to stay here, as she says?  And what does it all mean, anyhow?\"  Dorothy laughed.  \"Why didn't you tell us what you were goin' to do?\" inquired Uncle Henry, reproachfully.  \"If I'd known about it, I'd 'a put on my Sunday clothes.\"  \"I'll 'splain ever'thing as soon as we get to your rooms,\" promised Dorothy.  \"You're in great luck, Uncle Henry and Aunt Em; an' so am I! And oh! I'm so happy to have got you here, at last!\"  As he walked by the little girl's side, Uncle Henry stroked his whiskers thoughtfully.  \"'Pears to me, Dorothy, we won't make bang-up fairies,\" he remarked.  \"An' my back hair looks like a fright!\" wailed Aunt Em.  \"Never mind,\" returned the little girl, reassuringly.  \"You won't have anything to do now but to look pretty, Aunt Em; an' Uncle Henry won't have to work till his back aches, that's certain.\"  \"Sure?\" they asked, wonderingly, and in the same breath.  \"Course I'm sure,\" said Dorothy.  \"You're in the Fairyland of Oz, now; an' what's more, you belong to it!\"    6.  How Guph Visited the Whimsies  The new General of the Nome King's army knew perfectly well that to fail in his plans meant death for him.  Yet he was not at all anxious or worried.  He hated every one who was good and longed to make all who were happy unhappy.  Therefore he had accepted this dangerous position as General quite willingly, feeling sure in his evil mind that he would be able to do a lot of mischief and finally conquer the Land of Oz.  Yet Guph determined to be careful, and to lay his plans well, so as not to fail.  He argued that only careless people fail in what they attempt to do.  The mountains underneath which the Nome King's extensive caverns were located lay grouped just north of the Land of Ev, which lay directly across the deadly desert to the east of the Land of Oz.  As the mountains were also on the edge of the desert the Nome King found that he had only to tunnel underneath the desert to reach Ozma's dominions. He did not wish his armies to appear above ground in the Country of the Winkies, which was the part of the Land of Oz nearest to King Roquat's own country, as then the people would give the alarm and enable Ozma to fortify the Emerald City and assemble an army.  He wanted to take all the Oz people by surprise; so he decided to run the tunnel clear through to the Emerald City, where he and his hosts could break through the ground without warning and conquer the people before they had time to defend themselves.  Roquat the Red began work at once upon his tunnel, setting a thousand miners at the task and building it high and broad enough for his armies to march through it with ease.  The Nomes were used to making tunnels, as all the kingdom in which they lived was under ground; so they made rapid progress.  While this work was going on General Guph started out alone to visit the Chief of the Whimsies.  These Whimsies were curious people who lived in a retired country of their own.  They had large, strong bodies, but heads so small that they were no bigger than door-knobs.  Of course, such tiny heads could not contain any great amount of brains, and the Whimsies were so ashamed of their personal appearance and lack of commonsense that they wore big heads made of pasteboard, which they fastened over their own little heads.  On these pasteboard heads they sewed sheep's wool for hair, and the wool was colored many tints--pink, green and lavender being the favorite colors.  The faces of these false heads were painted in many ridiculous ways, according to the whims of the owners, and these big, burly creatures looked so whimsical and absurd in their queer masks that they were called \"Whimsies.\"  They foolishly imagined that no one would suspect the little heads that were inside the imitation ones, not knowing that it is folly to try to appear otherwise than as nature has made us.  The Chief of the Whimsies had as little wisdom as the others, and had been chosen chief merely because none among them was any wiser or more capable of ruling.  The Whimsies were evil spirits and could not be killed.  They were hated and feared by every one and were known as terrible fighters because they were so strong and muscular and had not sense enough to know when they were defeated.  General Guph thought the Whimsies would be a great help to the Nomes in the conquest of Oz, for under his leadership they could be induced to fight as long so they could stand up.  So he traveled to their country and asked to see the Chief, who lived in a house that had a picture of his grotesque false head painted over the doorway.  The Chief's false head had blue hair, a turned-up nose, and a mouth that stretched half across the face.  Big green eyes had been painted upon it, but in the center of the chin were two small holes made in the pasteboard, so that the Chief could see through them with his own tiny eyes; for when the big head was fastened upon his shoulders the eyes in his own natural head were on a level with the false chin.  Said General Guph to the Chief of the Whimsies:  \"We Nomes are going to conquer the Land of Oz and capture our King's Magic Belt, which the Oz people stole from him.  Then we are going to plunder and destroy the whole country.  And we want the Whimsies to help us.\"  \"Will there be any fighting?\" asked the Chief.  \"Plenty,\" replied Guph.  That must have pleased the Chief, for he got up and danced around the room three times.  Then he seated himself again, adjusted his false head, and said:  \"We have no quarrel with Ozma of Oz.\"  \"But you Whimsies love to fight, and here is a splendid chance to do so,\" urged Guph.  \"Wait till I sing a song,\" said the Chief.  Then he lay back in his chair and sang a foolish song that did not seem to the General to mean anything, although he listened carefully.  When he had finished, the Chief Whimsie looked at him through the holes in his chin and asked:  \"What reward will you give us if we help you?\"  The General was prepared for this question, for he had been thinking the matter over on his journey.  People often do a good deed without hope of reward, but for an evil deed they always demand payment.  \"When we get our Magic Belt,\" he made reply, \"our King, Roquat the Red, will use its power to give every Whimsie a natural head as big and fine as the false head he now wears.  Then you will no longer be ashamed because your big strong bodies have such teenty-weenty heads.\"  \"Oh!  Will you do that?\" asked the Chief, eagerly.  \"We surely will,\" promised the General.  \"I'll talk to my people,\" said the Chief.  So he called a meeting of all the Whimsies and told them of the offer made by the Nomes.  The creatures were delighted with the bargain, and at once agreed to fight for the Nome King and help him to conquer Oz.  One Whimsie alone seemed to have a glimmer of sense, for he asked:  \"Suppose we fail to capture the Magic Belt?  What will happen then, and what good will all our fighting do?\"  But they threw him into the river for asking foolish questions, and laughed when the water ruined his pasteboard head before he could swim out again.  So the compact was made and General Guph was delighted with his success in gaining such powerful allies.  But there were other people, too, just as important as the Whimsies, whom the clever old Nome had determined to win to his side.    7.  How Aunt Em Conquered the Lion  \"These are your rooms,\" said Dorothy, opening a door.  Aunt Em drew back at the sight of the splendid furniture and draperies.  \"Ain't there any place to wipe my feet?\" she asked.  \"You will soon change your slippers for new shoes,\" replied Dorothy. \"Don't be afraid, Aunt Em.  Here is where you are to live, so walk right in and make yourself at home."]]]
