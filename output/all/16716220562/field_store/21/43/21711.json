Teddy, here, certainly couldn't tell them anything. They'd say it was a joke and forget it....\" His voice barely sounded the last few words. He no longer believed them. A smile flickered upon his face. \"Gentlemen, you don't think they'd--\"  \"The Russians,\" said Blake, without emotion, \"would go off their rockers, sir. To be unable to explain a thing like this would devastate their morale. The Communist is a man who must hold all the aces. He'll shuffle and reshuffle until he gets them, too. Well, we're giving him a cold deck, sir. There are no aces for him to find.\"  \"Hmmm,\" said the President. \"As long as there's any doubt in their minds, they'll have to keep plugging at it, won't they! And since there's no solution--\" His smile grew calculating. \"Yes, yes I begin to see. It's a small thing, to be sure, but I find I must leap at the opportunity to stick a few ants in _their_ pants for a change.\"  \"It won't wipe them out,\" began the Secretary.  \"But it'll wear them down a little,\" Blake finished.  \"Done!\" said the President. \"How soon can we get Operation Frustration under way?\"  \"The plane is ready to leave right now,\" said the Secretary, with a small blush. \"I--I rather thought you'd see this thing our way.\"  The President frowned at this, then shrugged. \"Good enough. Let's get this bear into the air.\"  <tb>  \"You sure this plane will work?\" asked the President, averting his face from the spray of leaves caught up in the shrieking jet stream of the waiting plane.  \"It's too simple not to,\" said Blake, clutching the suitcase--on whose side a large red \"Top Secret\" had been stenciled--to his chest, and shouting over the scream of the plane. \"The radar-resistant device is nothing more than a radio-receiver that blankets the structure, making the entire plane a receiver. If it receives the radar impulses, they can't bounce back and make a blip on the enemy radar screens.\"  The President sighed. \"You make it sound almost too easy. Very well.\" He shook the man's hand. \"Good luck.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Blake, patting the suitcase. \"I'll take good care of Teddy.\"  The President nodded and moved away. Blake boarded the jet, and, minutes later, the President was watching a last fading streamer of the twin exhausts dwindling upon the eastern horizon.  \"I shan't sleep till he's back,\" said the Secretary.  \"Nor I,\" said the President. \"I have the weirdest damned apprehension....\"  \"About what, sir?\" asked the Secretary, as they made their way from the field.  \"About the--\" the President looked around, then lowered his voice to a whisper--\"the Russians. There's something in their makeup we may have overlooked.\"  \"Impossible, sir,\" said the Secretary of Defense. \"Blake is our top psychologist.\"  \"I hope you're right. If this fails, I'd hate for it to be traced to us.\"  \"It can't be. The jacket was made in Japan, the boots in Mexico, the parachute in--\"  \"I know, I know,\" said the President. \"But if they _should_ trace it to us, we'll be a laughing-stock.\"  \"They won't,\" the Secretary assured him.  <tb>  Two days later, Blake was back, his manner jovial when he met in secret session once more with the two executives.  \"Couldn't have gone more perfectly, gentlemen,\" he said, rubbing his hands together and bouncing on his toes. \"We passed directly over Moscow, at a height of ten miles, on the stroke of midnight. The night was overcast and starless. Teddy was dropped through the bomb bay. I saw his parachute open myself. He's down there now, and we're sure to see signs any day now of the little cracks in the Iron Curtain.\"  \"You had no trouble with the enemy?\" the President asked, though the answer--since Blake was back alive--was obvious.  \"None,\" Blake said. \"The radar shield performed exactly as specified, sir. Not a blink of a searchlight nor a single ground-to-air rocket did we see. Perhaps, on hearing us pass by, they sent up an investigating plane or two, but we were long gone by then. That's the advantage of moving faster than the sound you make,\" he added pontifically.  \"I still feel we've overlooked something,\" said the President. \"In the back of my mind, a small voice keeps trying to remind me of something about the Russians, something that should have made me veto this whole scheme at the start.\"  Blake looked puzzled. \"What about them, sir? If it's in regard to their psychology, I can assure you--\"  \"I don't mean their psychology at _all_,\" said the President. \"No, wait--yes, I do, in a minor way. They must pursue this thing, no matter what, but--\"  A light glimmered, then burned brightly in the President's eyes, and he stood up and smacked his fist into his open palm. \"Of course!\" he said. \"Their methods!\"  \"Methods?\" asked Blake, a little nervously.  The President's reply was interrupted by a knock at the door. The three men exchanged a look; then the Secretary jabbed the button, and Jenkins came in.  \"This just came for you, sir,\" he said, handing the Secretary a small envelope, and making his exit silently.  The President waited impatiently as the envelope was torn open and its contents read. Then the Secretary's hands opened limply and the message fell upon the table.  \"Diplomatic note--Russian--Teddy,\" he whispered.  \"What!\" yelped the President. He snatched the paper from the table and read it, then sank into his chair once more, his face grim and eyes suspiciously moist. \"The dirty, lowdown, rotten....\"  Blake, hovering at tableside, hesitated a moment, then asked, \"What about Teddy? What's happened?\"  \"What we might have expected,\" said the Secretary dolefully.  \"You don't mean--\" Blake mumbled, horrified. He couldn't continue, just waited for the worst.  The President nodded miserably.  \"He's confessed.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51436"],["title","Bullet with His Name (#0)"],["body","With His Name                              By FRITZ LEIBER                          Illustrated By: DILLON             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                    Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him, and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"  His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither overly gaudy nor utterly drab--indicating median social level, which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably meshed--at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"  \"Except what?\"  \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"  \"Of course not! Thank your stars _that's_ beyond the reach of Galaxy Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and I'd be out of a job.\"  \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos with backtracking permitted.\"  \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest for the test?\"  \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.  \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember, the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"  \"No--at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"  \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the bluff, blunt type.  \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse for some sardonic trick--that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"  \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits, eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course. What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"  \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've already got atomic power.\"  \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of our Gifts--three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"  \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.  \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"  \"Yes to that too.\"  \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system we have to visit on this circuit.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ernie Meeker--of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol, Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy--rubbed his chin and slanted across the street to a drugstore.  \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"  At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.  Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the counter.  \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.  The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way. He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.  Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days--and shaves--later, he pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the packet.  Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade, although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.  But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.  Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last packet and shuffled it into this series.  Or maybe--although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to prevent it from happening--he'd got a decent blade for once.  Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost so.  \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"  \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your beard real good--four, five minutes at least--have the water steaming hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"  \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics.         *       *       *       *       *  But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an irritated shrug.  As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and--_urrk_!  Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor. Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.  He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.  Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring way.  He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.  The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted it out.  \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously couldn't be. Or maybe--\" he grinned a little wryly--\"maybe I'd almost get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"  So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later, it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle.         *       *       *       *       *  That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:  \"No, no, no!\"  Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the box firmly in both hands and studied it.  Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read:                           AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST      Dissociates H_{2}O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a     serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles,     automobiles, trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors,     torque-twisters, translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to     6000 meters per second).

He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff--after all, the human body is mostly water.  After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the broad"]]]
