Then he whirled, swinging at three hornets which had come at him through the boarded windows.  \"Forget the hornets!\" Drake shouted. \"Keep watching the ground!\"  There was movement on the floor. Several hairy spiders crawled out of the shadows. Drake and Recetich beat at them with rifle butts. Byrnes saw something crawling under the door. It looked like some kind of huge flat centipede. He stamped at it, missed, and the centipede was on his boot, past it, on the flesh of his leg. He screamed; it felt like a ribbon of molten metal. He was able to smash it flat before he passed out.  Drake checked the wound and decided it was not fatal. He stamped on another spider, then felt Sorensen's hand clutching his shoulder. He looked toward the corner Sorensen was pointing at.  Sliding toward them were two large, dark-coated snakes. Drake recognized them as black adders. These normally shy creatures were coming forward like tigers.         *       *       *       *       *  The men panicked, trying to get away from the snakes. Drake pulled out his revolver and dropped to one knee, ignoring the hornets that buzzed around him, trying to draw a bead on the slender serpentine targets in the swaying yellow light.  Thunder roared directly overhead. A long flash of lightning suddenly flooded the room, spoiling his aim. Drake fired and missed, and waited for the snakes to strike.  They didn't strike. They were moving away from him, retreating to the rat hole from which they had emerged. One of the adders slid quickly through. The other began to follow, then stopped, half in the hole.  Sorensen took careful aim with a rifle. Drake pushed the muzzle aside. \"Wait just a moment.\"  The adder hesitated. It came out of the hole and began to move toward them again....  And there was another crash of thunder and a vivid splash of lightning. The snake turned away and squirmed through the hole.  \"What's going on?\" Sorensen asked. \"Is the thunder frightening them?\"  \"No, it's the lightning!\" Drake said. \"That's why the Quedak was in such a rush. He saw that a storm was coming, and he hadn't consolidated his position yet.\"  \"What are you talking about?\"  \"The lightning,\" Drake said.  \"The electrical storm! It's jamming that radio control of his! And when he's jammed, the beasts revert to normal behavior. It takes him time to re-establish control.\"  \"The storm won't last forever,\" Cable said.  \"But maybe it'll last long enough,\" Drake said. He picked up the direction finders and handed one to Sorensen. \"Come on, Bill. We'll hunt out that bug right now.\"  \"Hey,\" Recetich said, \"isn't there something I can do?\"  \"You can start swimming if we don't come back in an hour,\" Drake said.         *       *       *       *       *  In slanting lines the rain drove down, pushed by the wild southwest wind. Thunder rolled continually and each flash of lightning seemed aimed at them. Drake and Sorensen reached the edge of the jungle and stopped.  \"We'll separate here,\" Drake said. \"Gives us a better chance of converging on him.\"  \"Right,\" Sorensen said. \"Take care of yourself, Dan.\"  Sorensen plunged into the jungle. Drake trotted fifty yards down the fringe and then entered the bush.  He pushed forward, the revolver in his belt, the radio direction finder in one hand, a flashlight in the other. The jungle seemed to be animated by a vicious life of its own, almost as if the Quedak controlled it. Vines curled cunningly around his ankles and the bushes reached out thorny hands toward him. Every branch took a special delight in slapping his face.  Each time the lightning flashed, Drake's direction finder tried to home on it. He was having a difficult time staying on course. But, he reminded himself, the Quedak was undoubtedly having an even more difficult time. Between flashes, he was able to set a course. The further he penetrated into the jungle, the stronger the signal became.  After a while he noticed that the flashes of lightning were spaced more widely apart. The storm was moving on toward the north, leaving the island behind. How much longer would he have the protection of the lightning? Another ten or fifteen minutes?  He heard something whimper. He swung his flashlight around and saw his dog, Oro, coming toward him.  His dog--or the Quedak's dog?  \"Hey there, boy,\" Drake said. He wondered if he should drop the direction finder and get the revolver out of his belt. He wondered if the revolver would still work after such a thorough soaking.  Oro came up and licked his hand. He was Drake's dog, at least for the duration of the storm.  They moved on together, and the thunder rumbled distantly in the north. The signal on his RDF was very strong now. Somewhere around here....  He saw light from another flashlight. Sorensen, badly out of breath, had joined him. The jungle had ripped and clawed at him, but he still had his rifle, flashlight and direction finder.  Oro was scratching furiously at a bush. There was a long flash of lightning, and in it they saw the Quedak.         *       *       *       *       *  Drake realized, in those final moments, that the rain had stopped. The lightning had stopped, too. He dropped the direction finder. With the flashlight in one hand and his revolver in the other, he tried to take aim at the Quedak, who was moving, who had jumped--  To Sorensen's neck, just above the right collarbone.  Sorensen raised his hands, then lowered them again. He turned toward Drake, raising his rifle. His face was perfectly calm. He looked as though his only purpose in life was to kill Drake.  Drake fired from less than two feet away. Sorensen spun with the impact, dropped his rifle and fell.  Drake bent over him, his revolver ready. He saw that he had fired accurately. The bullet had gone in just above the right collarbone. It was a bad wound. But it had been much worse for the Quedak, who had been in the direct path of the bullet. All that was left of the Quedak was a splatter of black across Sorensen's chest.  Drake applied hasty first aid and hoisted Sorensen to his shoulders. He wondered what he would have done if the Quedak had been standing above Sorensen's heart, or on his throat, or on his head.  He decided it was better not to think about that.  He started back to camp, with his dog trotting along beside him."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51834"],["title","Never Come Midnight (#0)"],["body","COME MIDNIGHT                           by CHRISTOPHER GRIMM                           Illustrated by DILLON             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                    Galaxy Science Fiction May 1958.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                  Across the void came a man who could not ever              have been born--from a world that could never              have been conceived--to demand his birthright              of an Earth that would have to die to pay it!   I  Jan Shortmire smiled. \"You didn't know I had a son, did you, Peter? Well, neither did I--until quite recently.\"  \"I see.\" However, Peter Hubbard knew that Jan Shortmire had never married in all of his hundred and fifty-five years. In that day and age, unmarried people did not have children; science, the law, and public sophistication had combined to make the historical \"accident\" almost impossible. Yet, if some woman of one of the more innocent planets had deliberately conceived in order to trap Shortmire, surely he would have learned of his son's existence long before.  \"I'm glad it turns out that I have an heir,\" Shortmire went on. \"Otherwise, the government might get its fists on what little I have--and it's taken enough from me.\"  Although the old man's estate was a considerable one, it did seem meager in terms of the money he must have made. What _had_ become of the golden tide that had poured in upon the golden youth, Hubbard wondered. Could anyone have squandered such prodigious sums upon the usual mundane dissipations? For, by the time the esoteric pleasures of the other planets had reached Earth--the byproduct of Shortmire's own achievement--he must have already been too old to enjoy them.  At Hubbard's continued silence, Shortmire said defensively, \"If they'd let me sell my patents to private industry, as Dyall was able to do, I'd be leaving a _real_ fortune!\" His voice grew thick with anger. \"When I think how much money Dyall made from those factory machines of his....\"  But when you added the priceless extra fifty years of life to the money Shortmire had made, it seemed to Hubbard that Shortmire had been amply rewarded. Although, of course, he had heard that Nicholas Dyall had been given the same reward. No point telling Shortmire, if he did not know already. Hubbard could never understand why Shortmire hated Dyall so; it could not be merely the money--and as for reputation, he had a shade the advantage.  \"That _toymaker_!\" Shortmire spat.         *       *       *       *       *  Hubbard tactfully changed the subject. \"What's your boy like, Jan?\" But of course Jan Shortmire's son could hardly be a boy; in fact, he was probably almost as old as Hubbard was.  Such old age as Shortmire's was almost incredible. Sitting there in the antique splendor of Hubbard's office, he looked like a splendid antique himself. Who could imagine that passion had ever convulsed that thin white face, that those frail white fingers had ever curved in love and in hate? Age beyond the reach of most men had blanched this once-passionate man to a chill, ivory shadow.  For once, Hubbard felt glad--almost--that he himself was ineligible for the longevity treatment. The allotted five score and ten was enough for any except the very selfish--or selfless--man.  But Shortmire was answering his question. \"I have no idea what the boy is like; I've never seen him.\" Then he added, \"I suppose you've been wondering why I finally decided to make a will?\"  \"A lawyer never wonders when people _do_ make wills, Jan,\" Hubbard said mildly. \"He wonders when they _don't_.\"  \"I'm going on a trip to Morethis. Only one of the colonized planets I've never visited.\" Shortmire's smile did not reach his amber-hard eyes. \"Civilized planets, I should have said. It isn't official government policy to colonize planets that have intelligent native live-forms.\"  Not even the most besotted idealist could ever have described Jan Shortmire as altruistic. And for him to be concerned about Morethis, of all planets--Morethis, where the indigenous life-forms were such as to justify a ruthless colonization policy ... it was outrageous! True, the terrestrial government had been more generous toward the Morethans than toward any of the seven other intelligent life-forms they had found. But this tolerance was based wholly on fear--fear of these remnants of an old, old civilization, eking out their existence around a dying star, yet with terrible glories to remember in their twilight--and traces of these glories to protect them.  How was it that Shortmire, who had been everywhere, seen everything, had never been to Morethis? Hubbard looked keenly at his client. \"What _is_ all this, Jan?\"  The old man shrugged. \"Merely that the Foreign Office has suggested it would be wise for travelers to make a will before going there. Being a dutiful citizen of Earth, I comply.\" He smiled balefully.  \"The Foreign Office has suggested that it would be wiser not to go at all,\" Hubbard said. \"There are people who say Morethis ought to be fumigated completely.\"  \"Ah, but it has rare and precious metals on which our industries depend. There are herbs which have multiplied the miracles of modern medicine, jewels and furs unmatched anywhere. We need the native miners and farmers and trappers to get these things for us.\"  \"We could get them for ourselves. We do on the other planets.\"  Shortmire grinned. \"On Morethis, somehow, our people can't seem to find these things themselves. Or, if they do, we can't find our people afterward. Which is why there is peace and friendship between Morethis and Earth.\"  \"_Friendship!_ Everyone knows the Morethans hate terrestrials. They tolerate us only because we're stronger!\"  \"Stronger physically.\" Shortmire's smile was fading. \"Even technology is a kind of physical strength.\"         *       *       *       *       *  New apprehension took shape in Hubbard. \"You're not going metaphysical in your old age, are you, Jan? And even if you are,\" he said quickly, while he was still innocent of knowledge, hence could not be consciously offending the other man's beliefs, \"what a cult to choose! Blood, terror and torture!\"  Shortmire grinned again. \"You've been watching vidicasts, Peter. They've laid it on so thick, I'll probably find Morethis deadly dull rather than just ... deadly.\"  Certainly, all Hubbard knew of Morethis was based on hearsay evidence, but this was not a court of law. \"Jan you're a fool! A third of the terrestrials who go to Morethis never come back, and mostly they're young men, strong men.\"  \"Then they're the fools.\" Shortmire's voice was low and tired. \"Because they're risking a whole lifetime, whereas all I'll be risking is a few years of a very boring existence.\"  Hubbard said no more. Even though the law still did not condone it, a man had the right to dispose of his own life as he saw fit.  Shortmire stood up. Barely stooped by age, he looked, with his great height and extreme emaciation, almost like a fasting saint--a ludicrous simile. \"My wine palate is gone, Peter,\" he said, clapping the younger old man's shoulder, \"women and I seem to have lost our mutual attraction, and I never did have much of a singing voice. At least this is one experience I'm not too old to savor.\"  \"Death, do you mean?\" Hubbard asked bluntly. \"Or Morethis?\"  Shortmire smiled. \"Perhaps both.\"  So Peter Hubbard was not surprised when, a few months later, he got word that Jan Shortmire had died on Morethis. The surprising thing was the extraordinarily prosaic manner of his death: he had simply fallen into a river and drowned. No traveler on Morethis had been known to die by undisputed accident before; as a result, the vidicasts devoted more attention to the event than they might have otherwise. But the news died down, as other news took its place. In so large a universe, something was always happening; the dog days were forever gone from journalism.  Going through the old man's papers in his capacity as executor, Hubbard came across an old passport. He was startled to discover that this trip had not been Shortmire's first to Morethis. Why had he lied about it? But that was a question that no one alive could answer--or so Hubbard thought.  Almost two years went by before the will was finally probated on all the planets where Shortmire had owned property. Then the search for Emrys Shortmire began. Messages were dispatched to all the civilized planets, and Peter Hubbard settled back for a long wait.         *       *       *       *       *  Five years after Jan Shortmire's death, the intercom on Peter Hubbard's desk buzzed and his secretary's voice--his was one of the few legal offices wealthy enough to afford human help--said, \"Mr. Emrys Shortmire to see you, sir.\"  How could a man come from so many light-years' distance without radioing on ahead, or at least tele-calling from his hotel? Dignity demanded that Hubbard tell his secretary to inform Shortmire that he never saw anyone without an appointment. Curiosity won. \"Ask him to come in,\" he said.  The door slid open. Hubbard started to rise, with the old-fashioned courtesy of a family lawyer. But he never made it. He sat, frozen with shock, staring at the man in the doorway. Because Emrys Shortmire wasn't a man; he was a boy. He might have been a stripling of thirty, except for his eyes. Copper-bright and copper-hard they were, too hard for a boy's. Give him forty, even forty-five, that would still have made Jan Shortmire a father when he was nearly a hundred and twenty. The longevity treatment produced remarkable results, but none that fantastic. Though health and strength could be restored, fertility, like youth, once vanished was gone forever.  Yet the boy looked too sophisticated to have made a stupid mistake like that, if he were an imposter. More important, he _looked_ like Jan Shortmire--not the Shortmire whom Hubbard"]]]
