Labuerre had made Halvorsen learn carpentry, and Labuerre had been right. You build a scaffold so you can sculp up high, not so it will collapse and you break a leg. You build your platforms so they hold the rock steady, not so it wobbles and chatters at every blow of the chisel. You build your armatures so they hold the plasticine you slam onto them.  But the help-wanted ads wanted no builders of scaffolds, platforms and armatures. The factories were calling for setup men and maintenance men for the production and assembly machines.  From upstate, General Vegetables had sent a recruiting team for farm help--harvest setup and maintenance men, a few openings for experienced operators of tank-caulking machinery. Under \"office and professional\" the demand was heavy for computer men, for girls who could run the I.B.M. Letteriter, esp. familiar sales and collections corresp., for office machinery maintenance and repair men. A job printing house wanted an esthetikon operator for letterhead layouts and the like. A.T. & T. wanted trainees to earn while learning telephone maintenance. A direct-mail advertising outfit wanted an artist--no, they wanted a sales-executive who could scrawl picture-ideas that would be subjected to the criticism and correction of the esthetikon.  Halvorsen leafed tiredly through the rest of the paper. He knew he wouldn't get a job, and if he did he wouldn't hold it. He knew it was a terrible thing to admit to yourself that you might starve to death because you were bored by anything except art, but he admitted it.  It had happened often enough in the past--artists undergoing preposterous hardships, not, as people thought, because they were devoted to art, but because nothing else was interesting. If there were only some impressive, sonorous word that summed up the aching, oppressive futility that overcame him when he tried to get out of art--only there wasn't.  He thought he could tell which of the photos in the tabloid had been corrected by the esthetikon.  There was a shot of Jink Bitsy, who was to star in a remake of _Peter Pan_. Her ears had been made to look not pointed but pointy, her upper lip had been lengthened a trifle, her nose had been pugged a little and tilted quite a lot, her freckles were cuter than cute, her brows were innocently arched, and her lower lip and eyes were nothing less than pornography.  There was a shot, apparently uncorrected, of the last Venus ship coming in at La Guardia and the average-looking explorers grinning. Caption: \"Austin Malone and crew smile relief on safe arrival. Malone says Venus colonies need men, machines. See story p. 2.\"  Petulantly, Halvorsen threw the paper under the table and walked out. What had space travel to do with him? Vacations on the Moon and expeditions to Venus and Mars were part of the deadly encroachment on his livelihood and no more.   II  He took the subway to Passaic and walked down a long-still traffic beltway to his studio, almost the only building alive in the slums near the rusting railroad freightyard.  A sign that had once said \"F. Labuerre, Sculptor--Portraits and Architectural Commissions\" now said \"Roald Halvorsen; Art Classes--Reasonable Fees.\" It was a grimy two-story frame building with a shopfront in which were mounted some of his students' charcoal figure studies and oil still-lifes. He lived upstairs, taught downstairs front, and did his own work downstairs, back behind dirty, ceiling-high drapes.  Going in, he noticed that he had forgotten to lock the door again. He slammed it bitterly. At the noise, somebody called from behind the drapes: \"Who's that?\"  \"Halvorsen!\" he yelled in a sudden fury. \"I live here. I own this place. Come out of there! What do you want?\"  There was a fumbling at the drapes and a girl stepped between them, shrinking from their dirt.  \"Your door was open,\" she said firmly, \"and it's a shop. I've just been here a couple of minutes. I came to ask about classes, but I don't think I'm interested if you're this bad-tempered.\"  A pupil. Pupils were never to be abused, especially not now.  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said. \"I had a trying day in the city.\" Now turn it on. \"I wouldn't tell everybody a terrible secret like this, but I've lost a commission. You understand? I thought so. Anybody who'd traipse out here to my dingy abode would be _simpatica_. Won't you sit down? No, not there--humor an artist and sit over there. The warm background of that still-life brings out your color--quite good color. Have you ever been painted? You've a very interesting face, you know. Some day I'd like to--but you mentioned classes.  \"We have figure classes, male and female models alternating, on Tuesday nights. For that I have to be very stern and ask you to sign up for an entire course of twelve lessons at sixty dollars. It's the models' fees--they're exorbitant. Saturday afternoons we have still-life classes for beginners in oils. That's only two dollars a class, but you might sign up for a series of six and pay ten dollars in advance, which saves you two whole dollars. I also give private instructions to a few talented amateurs.\"  The price was open on that one--whatever the traffic would bear. It had been a year since he'd had a private pupil and she'd taken only six lessons at five dollars an hour.  \"The still-life sounds interesting,\" said the girl, holding her head self-consciously the way they all did when he gave them the patter. It was a good head, carried well up. The muscles clung close, not yet slacked into geotropic loops and lumps. The line of youth is heliotropic, he confusedly thought. \"I saw some interesting things back there. Was that your own work?\"  She rose, obviously with the expectation of being taken into the studio. Her body was one of those long-lined, small-breasted, coltish jobs that the pre-Raphaelites loved to draw.  \"Well--\" said Halvorsen. A deliberate show of reluctance and then a bright smile of confidence. \"_You'll_ understand,\" he said positively and drew aside the curtains.  \"What a curious place!\" She wandered about, inspecting the drums of plaster, clay and plasticene, the racks of tools, the stands, the stones, the chisels, the forge, the kiln, the lumber, the glaze bench.  \"I _like_ this,\" she said determinedly, picking up a figure a half-meter tall, a Venus he had cast in bronze while studying under Labuerre some years ago. \"How much is it?\"  An honest answer would scare her off, and there was no chance in the world that she'd buy. \"I hardly ever put my things up for sale,\" he told her lightly. \"That was just a little study. I do work on commission only nowadays.\"  Her eyes flicked about the dingy room, seeming to take in its scaling plaster and warped floor and see through the wall to the abandoned slum in which it was set. There was amusement in her glance.  _I am not being honest, she thinks. She thinks that is funny. Very well, I will be honest._ \"Six hundred dollars,\" he said flatly.         *       *       *       *       *  The girl set the figurine on its stand with a rap and said, half angry and half amused: \"I don't understand it. That's more than a month's pay for me. I could get an S.P.G. statuette just as pretty as this for ten dollars. Who do you artists think you are, anyway?\"  Halvorsen debated with himself about what he could say in reply:  _An S.P.G. operator spends a week learning his skill and I spend a lifetime learning mine._  _An S.P.G. operator makes a mechanical copy of a human form distorted by formulae mechanically arrived at from psychotests of population samples. I take full responsibility for my work; it is mine, though I use what I see fit from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Augustan and Romantic and Modern Eras._  _An S.P.G. operator works in soft, homogeneous plastic; I work in bronze that is more complicated than you dream, that is cast and acid-dipped today so it will slowly take on rich and subtle coloring many years from today._  _An S.P.G. operator could not make an Orpheus Fountain_--  He mumbled, \"Orpheus,\" and keeled over.         *       *       *       *       *  Halvorsen awoke in his bed on the second floor of the building. His fingers and toes buzzed electrically and he felt very clear-headed. The girl and a man, unmistakably a doctor, were watching him.  \"You don't seem to belong to any Medical Plans, Halvorsen,\" the doctor said irritably. \"There weren't any cards on you at all. No Red, no Blue, no Green, no Brown.\"  \"I used to be on the Green Plan, but I let it lapse,\" the artist said defensively.  \"And look what happened!\"  \"Stop nagging him!\" the girl said. \"I'll pay you your fee.\"  \"It's supposed to come through a Plan,\" the doctor fretted.  \"We won't tell anybody,\" the girl promised. \"Here's five dollars. Just stop nagging him.\"  \"Malnutrition,\" said the doctor. \"Normally I'd send him to a hospital, but I don't see how I could manage it. He isn't on any Plan at all. Look, I'll take the money and leave some vitamins. That's what he needs--vitamins. And food.\"  \"I'll see that he eats,\" the girl said, and the doctor left.  \"How long since you've had anything?\" she asked Halvorsen.  \"I had some coffee today,\" he answered, thinking back. \"I'd been working on detail drawings for a commission and it fell through. I told you that. It was a shock.\"  \"I'm Lucretia Grumman,\" she said, and went out.  He dozed until she came back with an armful of groceries.  \"It's hard to get around down here,\" she complained.  \"It was Labuerre's studio,\" he told her defiantly. \"He left it to me when he died. Things weren't so rundown in his time. I studied under him; he was one of the last. He had a joke--'They don't really want my stuff, but they're ashamed to let me starve.' He warned me that they wouldn't be ashamed to let _me_ starve, but I insisted and he took me in.\"  Halvorsen drank some milk and ate some bread. He thought of the change"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51531"],["title","With These Hands (#2)"],["body"," the ten dollars in his pocket and decided not to mention it. Then he remembered that the doctor had gone through his pockets.  \"I can pay you for this,\" he said. \"It's very kind of you, but you mustn't think I'm penniless. I've just been too preoccupied to take care of myself.\"  \"Sure,\" said the girl. \"But we can call this an advance. I want to sign up for some classes.\"  \"Be happy to have you.\"  \"Am I bothering you?\" asked the girl. \"You said something odd when you fainted--'Orpheus.'\"  \"Did I say that? I must have been thinking of Milles' Orpheus Fountain in Copenhagen. I've seen photos, but I've never been there.\"  \"Germany? But there's nothing left of Germany.\"  \"Copenhagen's in Denmark. There's quite a lot of Denmark left. It was only on the fringes. Heavily radiated, but still there.\"  \"I want to travel, too,\" she said. \"I work at La Guardia and I've never been off, except for an orbiting excursion. I want to go to the Moon on my vacation. They give us a bonus in travel vouchers. It must be wonderful dancing under the low gravity.\"  Spaceport? Off? Low gravity? Terms belonging to the detested electronic world of the stereopantograph in which he had no place.  \"Be very interesting,\" he said, closing his eyes to conceal disgust.  \"I _am_ bothering you. I'll go away now, but I'll be back Tuesday night for the class. What time do I come and what should I bring?\"  \"Eight. It's charcoal--I sell you the sticks and paper. Just bring a smock.\"  \"All right. And I want to take the oils class, too. And I want to bring some people I know to see your work. I'm sure they'll see something they like. Austin Malone's in from Venus--he's a special friend of mine.\"  \"Lucretia,\" he said. \"Or do some people call you Lucy?\"  \"Lucy.\"  \"Will you take that little bronze you liked? As a thank you?\"  \"I can't do that!\"  \"Please. I'd feel much better about this. I really mean it.\"  She nodded abruptly, flushing, and almost ran from the room.  _Now why did I do that?_ he asked himself. He hoped it was because he liked Lucy Grumman very much. He hoped it wasn't a cold-blooded investment of a piece of sculpture that would never be sold, anyway, just to make sure she'd be back with class fees and more groceries.   III  She was back on Tuesday, a half-hour early and carrying a smock. He introduced her formally to the others as they arrived: a dozen or so bored young women who, he suspected, talked a great deal about their art lessons outside, but in class used any excuse to stop sketching.  He didn't dare show Lucy any particular consideration. There were fierce little miniature cliques in the class. Halvorsen knew they laughed at him and his line among themselves, and yet, strangely, were fiercely jealous of their seniority and right to individual attention.  The lesson was an ordeal, as usual. The model, a muscle-bound young graduate of the barbell gyms and figure-photography studios, was stupid and argumentative about ten-minute poses. Two of the girls came near a hair-pulling brawl over the rights to a preferred sketching location. A third girl had discovered Picasso's cubist period during the past week and proudly announced that she didn't _feel_ perspective in art.  But the two interminable hours finally ticked by. He nagged them into cleaning up--not as bad as the Saturdays with oils--and stood by the open door. Otherwise they would have stayed all night, cackling about absent students and snarling sulkily among themselves. His well-laid plans went sour, though. A large and flashy car drove up as the girls were leaving.  \"That's Austin Malone,\" said Lucy. \"He came to pick me up and look at your work.\"  That was all the wedge her fellow-pupils needed.  \"_Aus_-tin Ma-_lone_! _Well!_\"  \"Lucy, darling, I'd love to meet a real _spaceman_.\"  \"Roald, darling, would you mind very much if I stayed a moment?\"  \"I'm certainly not going to miss this and I don't care if you mind or not, Roald, darling!\"  Malone was an impressive figure. Halvorsen thought: he looks as though he's been run through an esthetikon set for 'brawny' and 'determined.' Lucy made a hash of the introductions and the spaceman didn't rise to conversational bait dangled enticingly by the girls.  In a clear voice, he said to Halvorsen: \"I don't want to take up too much of your time. Lucy tells me you have some things for sale. Is there any place we can look at them where it's quiet?\"  The students made sulky exits.  \"Back here,\" said the artist.  The girl and Malone followed him through the curtains. The spaceman made a slow circuit of the studio, seeming to repel questions.  He sat down at last and said: \"I don't know what to think, Halvorsen. This place stuns me. Do you _know_ you're in the Dark Ages?\"  _People who never have given a thought to Chartres and Mont St. Michel usually call it the Dark Ages_, Halvorsen thought wryly. He asked, \"Technologically, you mean? No, not at all. My plaster's better, my colors are better, my metal is better--tool metal, not casting metal, that is.\"  \"I mean _hand_ work,\" said the spaceman. \"Actually working by _hand_.\"  The artist shrugged. \"There have been crazes for the techniques of the boiler works and the machine shop,\" he admitted. \"Some interesting things were done, but they didn't stand up well. Is there anything here that takes your eye?\"  \"I like those dolphins,\" said the spaceman, pointing to a perforated terra-cotta relief on the wall. They had been commissioned by an architect, then later refused for reasons of economy when the house had run way over estimate. \"They'd look bully over the fireplace in my town apartment. Like them, Lucy?\"  \"I think they're wonderful,\" said the girl.  Roald saw the spaceman go rigid with the effort not to turn and stare at her. He loved her and he was jealous.  Roald told the story of the dolphins and said: \"The price that the architect thought was too high was three hundred and sixty dollars.\"  Malone grunted. \"Doesn't seem unreasonable--if you set a high store on inspiration.\"  \"I don't know about inspiration,\" the artist said evenly. \"But I was awake for two days and two nights shoveling coal and adjusting drafts to fire that thing in my kiln.\"  The spaceman looked contemptuous. \"I'll take it,\" he said. \"Be something to talk about during those awkward pauses. Tell me, Halvorsen, how's Lucy's work? Do you think she ought to stick with it?\"  \"Austin,\" objected the girl, \"don't be so blunt. How can he possibly know after one day?\"  \"She can't draw yet,\" the artist said cautiously. \"It's all coordination, you know--thousands of hours of practice, training your eye and hand to work together until you can put a line on paper where you want it. Lucy, if you're really interested in it, you'll learn to draw well. I don't think any of the other students will. They're in it because of boredom or snobbery, and they'll stop before they have their eye-hand coordination.\"  \"I _am_ interested,\" she said firmly.  Malone's determined restraint broke. \"Damned right you are. In--\" He recovered himself and demanded of Halvorsen: \"I understand your point about coordination. But thousands of hours when you can buy a camera? It's absurd.\"  \"I was talking about drawing, not art,\" replied Halvorsen. \"Drawing is putting a line on paper where you want it, I said.\" He took a deep breath and hoped the great distinction wouldn't sound ludicrous and trivial. \"So let's say that art is knowing how to put the line in the right place.\"  \"Be practical. There isn't any art. Not any more. I get around quite a bit and I never see anything but photos and S.P.G.s. A few heirlooms, yes, but nobody's painting or carving any more.\"  \"There's some art, Malone. My students--a couple of them in the still-life class--are quite good. There are more across the country. Art for occupational therapy, or a hobby, or something to do with the hands. There's trade in their work. They sell them to each other, they give them to their friends, they hang them on their walls. There are even some sculptors like that. Sculpture is prescribed by doctors. The occupational therapists say it's even better than drawing and painting, so some of these people work in plasticene and soft stone, and some of them get to be good.\"  \"Maybe so. I'm an engineer, Halvorsen. We glory in doing things the easy way. Doing things the easy way got me to Mars and Venus and it's going to get me to Ganymede. You're doing things the hard way, and your inefficiency has no place in this world. Look at you! You've lost a fingertip--some accident, I suppose.\"  \"I never noticed--\" said Lucy, and then let out a faint, \"Oh!\"  Halvorsen curled the middle finger of his left hand into the palm, where he usually carried it to hide the missing first joint.  \"Yes,\" he said softly. \"An accident.\"  \"Accidents are a sign of inadequate mastery of material and equipment,\" said Malone sententiously. \"While you stick to your methods and I stick to mine, _you can't compete with me_.\"  His tone made it clear that he was talking about more than engineering.  \"Shall we go now, Lucy? Here's my card, Halvorsen. Send those dolphins along and I'll mail you a check.\"   IV  The artist walked the half-dozen blocks to Mr. Krehbeil's place the next day. He found the old man in the basement shop of his fussy house, hunched over his bench with a powerful light overhead. He was trying to file a saw.  \"Mr. Krehbeil!\" Halvorsen called over the shriek of metal.  The carpenter turned around and peered with watery eyes. \"I can't see like I used to,\" he said querulously. \"I go over the same teeth on this damn saw, I skip teeth, I can't see the light shine off it when I got one set. The glare.\" He banged down his three-cornered file petulantly. \"Well, what can I do for you?\"  \"I need some crating stock. Anything. I'll trade you a couple of my maple four-by-fours.\"  The old face became cunning. \"And will you set my saw? My _saws_, I mean. It's nothing to you--an hour's work. You have the eyes.\"  Halvorsen said bitterly, "]]]
