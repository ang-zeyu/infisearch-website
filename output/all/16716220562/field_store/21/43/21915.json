I'm fine.\"  \"You look--\"  She never finished the sentence. The storm broke instead.  Dodd found himself weeping, twisting himself in the chair; reaching out with his hands, violently racked in spasms of grief: it seemed as if the room shook and he grasped nothing until she put her hands on his shoulders. His eyes were blind with water, his body in a continual series of spasms. He heard his own voice, making sounds that had never been words, crying for--for what? Help, peace, understanding?  Somewhere his mind continued to think, but the thoughts were powerless and very small. He felt the girl's hands on his shoulders, trying to hold him, and masked by the sounds of his own weeping he heard her voice, too:  \"It's all right ... calm down now ... you'll be all right....\"  \"... I ... can't....\" He managed to get two words out before the whirlpool sucked him down again, the reasonless, causeless whirlpool of grief and terror, his body shaking, his mouth wide open and calling in broken sounds, the tears as hot as metal marking his face as his eyes squeezed shut.  \"It's all right,\" the voice went on saying. \"It's all right.\"  At last he was possessed by the idea that someone else might come and see them. He drew in a breath and choked on it, and the weeping began again, but after a time he was able to take one breath and then another. He was able to stop. He reached into his pocket and found a handkerchief, wiped his eyes and looked into her face.  Nothing was there but shock, and a great caution. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"Are you all right?\"  He took a long time answering, and the answer, because it was true, surprised him. He was capable of surprise, he was capable of truth. \"I don't know,\" he said.     PART TWO     9   \"You will not tell me how to run my own division.\" The words were spaced, like steel rivets, evenly into the air. Dr. Haenlingen looked around the meeting-room, her face not even defiant but simply assured.  Willis, of Labor, was the first to recover. \"It's not that we'd like to interfere--\" he began.  She didn't let him finish. \"That's a lie.\" Her voice was not excited. It carried the length of the room, and left no echoes.  \"Now, Dr. Haenlingen--\" Rogier, Metals chairman and head of the meeting, began.  \"Don't soft-soap me,\" the old woman snapped. \"I'm too old for it and I'm too tough for it. I want to look at some facts, and I want you to look at them, too.\" She paused, and nobody said a word. \"I want to start with a simple statement. We're in trouble.\"  \"That's exactly the point,\" Willis began in his thin, high voice. \"It's because we all appreciate that fact--\"  \"That you want to tamper,\" the old woman said. \"Precisely.\" The others were seated around the long gleaming table of native wood. Dr. Haenlingen stood, her back rigid, at one end, facing them all with a cold and knowing eye. \"But I won't allow tampering in my department. I can't allow it.\"  Rogier took a deep breath. The words came like marshmallow out of his overstuffed body. \"I would hardly call a request for information 'tampering',\" he said.  \"I would,\" Dr. Haenlingen told him tartly. \"I've had a very good reason, over the years, to keep information about my section in my own hands.\"  Rogier's voice became stern. \"And that is?\"  \"That is,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"fools like you.\" Rogier opened his mouth, but the old woman gave him no chance. \"People who think psychology is a game, or at any rate a study that applies only to other people, never to them. People who want to subject others to the disciplines of psychology, but not themselves.\"  \"As I understand it--\" Rogier began.  \"You do not understand it,\" the old woman said flatly. \"I understand it because I have spent my life learning to do so. You have spent your life learning to understand metals, and committees. Doubtless, Dr. Rogier, you understand metals--and committees.\"  Her glance swept once more round the table, and she sat down. There was a second of silence before Dward, of Research, spoke up. Behind glassy contact lenses his eyes were, as always, unreadable. \"Perhaps Dr. Haenlingen has a point,\" he said. \"I know I'd hate to have to lay out my work for the meeting before I had it prepared. I'm sure we can allow a reasonable time for preparation--\"  \"I'm afraid we can't,\" Rogier put in, almost apologetically.  \"Of course we can't,\" the old woman added. \"First of all, I wasn't asking for time for preparation. I was asking for non-interference. And, second, we don't have any time at all.\"  \"Surely matters aren't that serious,\" Willis put in.  \"Matters,\" the old woman said, \"are a good deal more serious than that. Has anyone but me read the latest reports from the Confederation?\"  \"I think we all have,\" Rogier said calmly.  \"Well, then,\" the old woman asked, \"has anyone except myself understood them?\" The head turned, the eyes raked the table. \"Dr. Willis hasn't, or he wouldn't be sounding so hopeful. The rest of you haven't, or you wouldn't be talking about time. Rogier, you haven't, or you'd quit trying to pry and begin trying to prepare.\"  \"Preparations have begun,\" Rogier said. \"It's just for that reason that I want to get some idea of what your division--\"  \"Preparations,\" she said. The word was like a curse. \"There's been a leak, and a bad leak. We may never know where it started. A ship's officer, taking metals back, a stowaway, anything. That doesn't matter: anyone with any sense knew there had to be a leak sooner or later.\"  \"We've taken every possible precaution,\" Willis said.  \"Exactly,\" Dr. Haenlingen told him. \"And the leak happened. I take it there's no argument about that--given the figures and reports we now have?\"  There was silence.  \"Very well,\" she went on. \"The Confederation is acting just as it has always been obvious they would act: with idealism, stupidity and a gross lack of what is called common sense.\" She paused for comment: there was none. \"Disregarding the fact that they need our shipments, and need them badly, they have begun to turn against us. Against what they are pleased to call slavery.\"  \"Well?\" Rogier asked. \"It is slavery, isn't it?\"  \"What difference do labels make?\" she asked. \"In any case, they have turned against us. Public opinion is swinging heavily around, and there isn't much chance of pushing it back the other way. The man in the street is used to freedom. He likes it. He thinks the Alberts ought to be free, too.\"  \"But if they are,\" Willis said, \"the man in the street is going to lose a lot of other things--things dependent on our shipments.\"  \"I said they were illogical,\" Dr. Haenlingen told him patiently. \"Idealism almost always is. Logic has nothing to do with this--as anyone but a fool might know.\" She got up again, and began to walk back and forth along the end of the table. \"There are still people who are convinced, God knows why, that minds work on logic. Minds do not work on anything resembling logic. The laws on which they do work are only now beginning to be understood and codified: but logic was thrown out the window in the days of Freud. That, gentlemen, was a long time ago. The man in the Confederation street is going to lose a lot if he insists on freeing the Alberts. He hasn't thought of that yet, and he won't think of it until after it happens.\" She paused, at one end of her walk, and put her hands on her hips. \"That man is suffering from a disease, if putting it that way makes it easier for you to see. The disease is called idealism. Its main symptom is a disregard for consequences in favor of principles.\"  \"But surely--\" Willis began.  \"Dr. Willis, you are outdoing yourself,\" the old woman cut in. \"You sound as if you are hopeful about idealism resting somewhere even in us. And perhaps it does, perhaps it does. It is a persistent virus. But I hope we can control its more massive outbreaks, gentlemen, and not attempt to convince ourselves that this disease is actually a state of health.\" She began to pace again. \"Idealism is a disease,\" she said. \"In epidemic proportions, it becomes incurable.\"  \"Then there is nothing to be done?\" Dward asked.  \"Dr. Rogier has his preparations,\" the old woman said. \"I'm sure they are as efficient as they can be. They are useless, but he knows that as well as I do.\"  \"Now wait a--\" Rogier began.  \"Against ships of the Confederation, armed with God alone knows what after better than one hundred years of progress? Don't be silly, Dr. Rogier. Our preparations are better than nothing, perhaps, but not much better. They can't be.\"  Having reached her chair again, she sat down in it. The meeting was silent for better than a minute. Dr. Rogier was the first to speak. \"But, don't you see,\" he said, \"that's just why we need to know what's going on in your division. Perhaps a weapon might be forged from the armory of psychology which--\"  \"Before that metaphor becomes any more mixed,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"I want to clear one thing up. I am not going to divulge any basic facts about my division, now or ever.\"  \"But--\"  \"I want you to listen to me carefully,\" she said. \"The tools of psychology are both subtle and simple. Anyone can use a few of them. And anyone, in possession of only those few, will be tempted to put them to use. That use is dangerous, more dangerous than a ticking bomb. I will not run the risk of such danger.\"  \"Surely we are all responsible men--\" Rogier began.  \"Given enough temptation,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"there is no such thing as a responsible man. If there were, none of us would be here, on Fruyling's World. None of us would be masters, and none of the Alberts slaves.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'll give you an example,\" she said after a little time. \"The Psych division has parties, parties which are rather well-known among other divisions.

SMITH                           Illustrated by RITTER             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                     Galaxy Magazine February 1961.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                     There had to be a way for Sub-Archivist                 Clarey to get up in the world--but this                 way was right out of the tri-di dramas.   Clarey had checked in at Classification Center so many times that he came now more out of habit than hope. He didn't even look at the card that the test machine dropped into his hand until he was almost to the portway. And then he stopped. \"Report to Room 33 for reclassification,\" it said.  Ten years before, Clarey would have been ecstatic, sure that reclassification could be only in one direction. The machine had not originally given him a job commensurate with his talents; why should it suddenly recognize them? He'd known of people who had been reclassified--always downward. I'm a perfectly competent Sub-Archivist, he told himself; I'll fight.  But he knew fighting wouldn't help. All he had was the right to refuse any job he could claim was not in his line; the government would then be obligated to continue his existence. There were many people who did subsist on the government dole: the aged and the deficient and the defective--and creative artists who refused to trammel their spirits and chose to be ranked as Unemployables. Clarey didn't fit into those categories.  Dispiritedly, he passed along innumerable winding corridors and up and down ramps that twisted and turned to lead into other ramps and corridors. That was the way all public buildings were designed. It was forbidden for the government to make any law-abiding individual think the way it wanted him to think. But it could move him in any direction it chose, and sometimes that served its purpose as well as the reorientation machines.  So the corridors he passed through were in constant eddying movement, with a variety of individuals bent on a variety of objectives. For the most part, they were of Low Echelon status, though occasionally an Upper Echelon flashed his peremptory way past. Even though most L-Es attempted to ape the U-E dress and manner, you could always tell the difference. You could tell the difference among the different levels of L-E, too--and there was no mistaking the Unemployables in their sober gray habits, devoid of ornament. It was, Clarey sometimes thought when guilt feelings bothered him, the most esthetic of costumes.         *       *       *       *       *  The machine in Room 33 extracted whatever information it was set to receive, then spewed Clarey out and sent him on his way to Rooms 34, 35, and 36, where other machines repeated the same process. Room 37 proved to be that rare thing in the hierarchy of rooms--a destination. There was a human Employment Commissioner in it, splendidly garbed in crimson silvet and alexandrites--very Upper Echelon, indeed. He wore a gold mask, a common practice with celebrities who were afraid of being overwhelmed by their admirers, an even more common practice with U-E non-celebrities who enjoyed the thrill of distinguished anonymity.  Then Clarey stopped looking at the Commissioner. There was a girl sitting next to him, on a high-backed chair like his. Clarey had never seen a U-E girl so close before. Only the Greater Archivists had direct contact with the public, and Clarey wasn't likely to meet a U-E socially, even if he'd had a social life. The girl was too fabulous for him to think of her as a woman, a female; but he would have liked to have her in his archives, in the glass case with the rare editions.  \"Good morning, Sub-Archivist Clarey,\" the man said mellowly. \"Good of you to come in. There's rather an unusual position open and the machines tell us you're the one man who can fill it. Please sit down.\" He indicated a small, hard stool.  Clarey remained standing. \"I've been a perfectly competent Sub-Archivist,\" he declared. \"If MacFingal has--if there have been any complaints, I should have been told first.\"  \"There have been no complaints. The reclassification is upward.\"  \"You mean I've made it as a Musician!\" Clarey cried, sinking to the hard little stool in joyful atony.  \"Well, no, not exactly a Musician. But it's a highly artistic type of job with possible musical overtones.\"  Clarey became a hollow man once more. No matter what it was, if it wasn't as duly accredited Musician, it didn't matter. The machine could keep him from putting his symphonies down on tape, but it couldn't keep them from coursing in his head. That it could never take away from him. Or the resultant headache, either.  \"What is the job, then?\" he asked dully.  \"A very important position, Sub-Archivist. In fact, the future welfare of this planet may depend on it.\"  \"It's a trick to make me take a job nobody else wants,\" Clarey sneered. \"And it must be a pretty rotten job for you to go to so much trouble.\"  The girl, whom he'd almost forgotten, gave a little laugh. Her eyes, he noticed, were hazel. There were L-E girls, he supposed, who also had hazel eyes--but a different hazel.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Perhaps this will convince you of the job's significance,\" the interviewer said huffily. He took off his mask and looked at Clarey with anticipation. He had a sleek, ordinary, middle-aged-to-elderly face.  There was an awkward interval. \"Don't you recognize me?\" he demanded.  Clarey shook his head. The girl laughed again.  \"A blow to my ego, but proof that you're the right man for this job. I'm General Spano. And this is my Mistress, Secretary Han Vollard.\"  The girl inclined her head.  \"At least you must know my name?\" Spano said querulously.  \"I've heard it,\" Clarey admitted. \"'The Fiend of Fomalhaut,' they call you,\" he went on before he could catch himself and stop the words.  The girl clapped her hand over her mouth, but the laughter spilled out over and around it, pretty U-E laughter.  Spano finally laughed, too. \"It's a phrase that might be used about any military man. One carries out one's orders to the best of one's ability.\"  \"Besides,\" Clarey observed in a non-Archivistic manner, \"what concern have I with your military morality?\"  \"He's absolutely perfect for the job, Steff!\" she cried. \"I didn't think the machines were that good!\"  \"We mustn't underestimate the machines, Han,\" Spano said. \"They're efficient, very efficient. Someday they'll take over from us.\"  \"There're some things they'll never be able to do,\" she said. Her hazel eyes lingered on Clarey's. \"Aren't you glad, Archivist?\"  \"Sub-Archivist,\" he corrected her frostily. \"And I hadn't really thought about it.\"  \"That's not what the machines say, Sub-Archivist,\" she told him, her voice candy-sweet. \"They deep-probed your mind. You don't do anything, but you've thought about it a lot, haven't you?\"  Clarey felt the blood surge up. \"My thoughts are my own concern. You haven't the right to use them to taunt me.\"  \"But I think you're attractive,\" she protested. \"Honestly I do. In a different way. Just go to a good tailor, put on a little weight, dye your hair, and--\"  \"And I wouldn't be different any more,\" Clarey finished. That wasn't true; he would always be different. Not that he was deformed, just unappealing. He was below average height and his eyes and hair and skin were too light. In the past, he knew, there had been pale races and dark races on Earth. With the discovery of other intelligent life-forms to discriminate against together, the different races had fused into a swarthy unity. Of course he could hide his etiolation with dye and cosmetics, but those of really good quality cost more than he could afford, and cheap maquillage was worse than none. Besides, why should his appearance mean anything to anybody but himself? He'd had enough beating around the bush! \"Would you mind telling me exactly what the job is?\"  \"Intelligence agent,\" said Spano.  \"Isn't it exciting?\" she put in. \"Aren't you thrilled?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey bounced angrily from his chair. \"I won't sit here and be ridiculed!\"  \"Why ridiculed?\" Spano asked. \"Don't you consider yourself an intelligent man?\"  \"Being an intelligence agent has nothing to do with intelligence!\" Clarey said furiously. \"The whole thing's silly, straight out of the tri-dis.\"  \"What do you have against the tri-dis, Sub-Archivist?\" Spano's voice was very quiet.  \"Don't you like any of them?\" the girl said. \"I just adore _Sentries of the Sky_!\" Her enthusiasm was tinged, obscurely, with warning.  \"Well, I enjoy it, too,\" Clarey said, sinking back to the stool. \"It's very entertaining, but I'm sure it isn't meant to be taken seriously.\"  \"Oh, but it is, Sub-Archivist Clarey,\" Spano said. \"_Sentries of the Sky_ happens to be produced by my bureau. We want the public to know all about our operations--or as much as it's good for them to know--and they find it more palatable in fictionalized form.\"  \"Documentaries always get low ratings,\" the girl said. \"And you can't really blame the public--documentaries are dull. Myself, I like a love interest.\" Her eyes rested lingeringly on Clarey's.  They must think I'm a fool, Clarey thought; yet why would they bother to fool me? \"But I am given to understand,\" he said to Spano, \"even by the tri-dis, that an intelligence agent needs special training, special qualifications.\"  \"In this case, the special qualifications outweigh the training. And you have the qualifications we need for Damorlan.\"  \"According to the machines, all I'm qualified for is human filing cabinet. Is that what you want?\"  Spano was growing impatient. \"Look, Clarey, the machines have decided that you are not a Musician. Do you want to remain a Sub-Archivist for the rest of your days or will you take this other road? Once you'r"]]]
