He tried to fight; but, blinded by a sudden beam of yellow light, he was betrayed by total and enervating confusion.  The yellow light went off. The black beast bit down hard on the Quedak's armored back. The Quedak mustered his remaining strength, and, uncoiling his long, scorpion-jointed tail, lashed out.  He missed, but the black beast released him hastily. They circled each other, the Quedak hoisting his tail for a second blow, the beast unwilling to turn loose this prey.  The Quedak waited for his chance. Elation filled him. This pugnacious animal could be the first, the first on this planet to experience the Quedak mission. From this humble creature a start could be made....  The beast sprang and its white teeth clicked together viciously. The Quedak moved out of the way and its barb-headed tail flashed out, fastening itself in the beast's back. The Quedak held on grimly while the beast leaped and squirmed. Setting his feet, the Quedak concentrated on the all-important task of pumping a tiny white crystal down the length of his tail and under the beast's skin.  But this most important of the Quedak faculties was still dormant. Unable to accomplish anything, the Quedak released his barbs, and, taking careful aim, accurately drove his sting home between the black beast's eyes. The blow, as the Quedak had known, was lethal.  The Quedak took nourishment from the body of its dead foe; regretfully, for by inclination the Quedak was herbivorous. When he had finished, the Quedak knew that he was in desperate need of a long period of rest. Only after that could the full Quedak powers be regained.  He crawled up and down the piles of goods in the yard, looking for a place to hide. Carefully he examined several bales. At last he reached a stack of heavy boxes. One of the boxes had a crack just large enough to admit him.  The Quedak crawled inside, down the shiny, oil-slick surface of a machine, to the far end of the box. There he went into the dreamless, defenseless sleep of the Quedak, serenely trusting in what the future would bring.   PART TWO   I  The big gaff-headed schooner was pointed directly at the reef-enclosed island, moving toward it with the solidity of an express train. The sails billowed under powerful gusts of the northwest breeze, and the rusty Allison-Chambers diesel rumbled beneath a teak grating. The skipper and mate stood on the bridge deck and watched the reef approach.  \"Anything yet?\" the skipper asked. He was a stocky, balding man with a perpetual frown on his face. He had been sailing his schooner among the uncharted shoals and reefs of the Southwest Pacific for twenty-five years. He frowned because his old ship was not insurable. His deck cargo, however, _was_ insured. Some of it had come all the way from Ogdensville, that transshipment center in the desert where spaceships landed.  \"Not a thing,\" the mate said. He was watching the dazzling white wall of coral, looking for the gleam of blue that would reveal the narrow pass to the inner lagoon. This was his first trip to the Solomon Islands. A former television repairman in Sydney before he got the wanderlust, the mate wondered if the skipper had gone crazy and planned a spectacular suicide against the reef.  \"Still nothing!\" he shouted. \"Shoals ahead!\"  \"I'll take it,\" the skipper said to the helmsman. He gripped the wheel and watched the unbroken face of the reef.  \"Nothing,\" the mate said. \"Skipper, we'd better come about.\"  \"Not if we're going to get through the pass,\" the skipper said. He was beginning to get worried. But he had promised to deliver goods to the American treasure-hunters on this island, and the skipper's word was his bond. He had picked up the cargo in Rabaul and made his usual stops at the settlements on New Georgia and Malaita. When he finished here, he could look forward to a thousand-mile run to New Caledonia.  \"There it is!\" the mate shouted.  A thin slit of blue had appeared in the coral wall. They were less than thirty yards from it now, and the old schooner was making close to eight knots.         *       *       *       *       *  As the ship entered the pass, the skipper threw the wheel hard over. The schooner spun on its keel. Coral flashed by on either side, close enough to touch. There was a metallic shriek as an upper main-mast spreader snagged and came free. Then they were in the pass, bucking a six-knot current.  The mate pushed the diesel to full throttle, then sprang back to help the skipper wrestle with the wheel. Under sail and power the schooner forged through the pass, scraped by an outcropping to port, and came onto the placid surface of the lagoon.  The skipper mopped his forehead with a large blue bandanna. \"Very snug work,\" he said.  \"_Snug!_\" the mate cried. He turned away, and the skipper smiled a brief smile.  They slid past a small ketch riding at anchor. The native hands took down sail and the schooner nosed up to a rickety pier that jutted out from the beach. Lines were made fast to palm trees. From the fringe of jungle above the beach a white man came down, walking briskly in the noonday heat.  He was very tall and thin, with knobby knees and elbows. The fierce Melanesian sun had burned out but not tanned him, and his nose and cheekbones were peeling. His horn-rimmed glasses had broken at the hinge and been repaired with a piece of tape. He looked eager, boyish, and curiously naive.  One hell-of-a-looking treasure-hunter, the mate thought.  \"Glad to see you!\" the man called out. \"We'd about given you up for lost.\"  \"Not likely,\" the skipper said. \"Mr. Sorensen, I'd like you to meet my new mate, Mr. Willis.\"  \"Glad to meet you, Professor,\" the mate said.  \"I'm not a professor,\" Sorensen said, \"but thanks anyhow.\"  \"Where are the others?\" the skipper asked.  \"Out in the jungle,\" Sorensen said. \"All except Drake, and he'll be down here shortly. You'll stay a while, won't you?\"  \"Only to unload,\" the skipper said. \"Have to catch the tide out of here. How's the treasure-hunting?\"  \"We've done a lot of digging,\" Sorensen said. \"We still have our hopes.\"  \"But no doubloons yet?\" the skipper asked. \"No pieces of eight?\"  \"Not a damned one,\" Sorensen said wearily. \"Did you bring the newspapers, Skipper?\"  \"That I did,\" Sorensen replied. \"They're in the cabin. Did you hear about that second spaceship going to Mars?\"  \"Heard about it on the short wave,\" Sorensen said. \"It didn't bring back much, did it?\"  \"Practically nothing. Still, just think of it. _Two_ spaceships to Mars, and I hear they're getting ready to put one on Venus.\"  The three men looked around them and grinned.  \"Well,\" the skipper said, \"I guess maybe the space age hasn't reached the Southwest Pacific yet. And it certainly hasn't gotten to _this_ place. Come on, let's unload the cargo.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This place was the island of Vuanu, southernmost of the Solomons, almost in the Louisade Archipelago. It was a fair-sized volcanic island, almost twenty miles long and several wide. Once it had supported half a dozen native villages. But the population had begun to decline after the depredations of the blackbirders in the 1850s. Then a measles epidemic wiped out almost all the rest, and the survivors emigrated to New Georgia. A ship-watcher had been stationed here during the Second World War, but no ships had come this way. The Japanese invasion had poured across New Guinea and the upper Solomons, and further north through Micronesia. At the end of the war Vuanu was still deserted. It was not made into a bird sanctuary like Canton Island, or a cable station like Christmas Island, or a refueling point like Cocos-Keeling. No one even wanted to explode alphabet bombs on it. Vuanu was a worthless, humid, jungle-covered piece of land, free to anyone who wanted it.  William Sorensen, general manager of a chain of liquor stores in California, decided he wanted it.  Sorensen's hobby was treasure-hunting. He had looked for Lafitte's treasure in Louisiana and Texas, and for the Lost Dutchman Mine in Arizona. He had found neither. His luck had been better on the wreck-strewn Gulf coast, and on an expedition to Dagger Cay in the Caribbean he had found a double handful of Spanish coins in a rotting canvas bag. The coins were worth about three thousand dollars. The expedition had cost very much more, but Sorensen felt amply repaid.  For many years he had been interested in the Spanish treasure galleon _Santa Teresa_. Contemporary accounts told how the ship, heavily laden with bullion, sailed from Manila in 1689. The clumsy ship, caught in a storm, had run off to the south and been wrecked. Eighteen survivors managed to get ashore with the treasure. They buried it, and set sail for the Phillipines in the ship's pinnacle. Two of them were alive when the boat reached Manila.  The treasure island was tentatively identified as one of the Solomons. But which one?  No one knew. Treasure-hunters looked for the cache on Bougainville and Buka. There was a rumor about it on Malaita, and even Ontong Java received an expedition. But no treasure was recovered.  Sorensen, researching the problem thoroughly, decided that the _Santa Teresa_ had sailed completely through the Solomons, almost to the Louisades. The ship must have escaped destruction until it crashed into the reef at Vuanu.  His desire to search for the treasure might have remained only a dream if he hadn't met Dan Drake. Drake was also an amateur treasure-hunter. More important, he owned a fifty-five-foot Hanna ketch.  Over an evening's drinks the Vuanu expedition was born.  Additional members were recruited. Drake's ketch was put into seagoing condition, equipment and money saved or gathered. Several other possible treasure sites in the Southwest Pacific were researched. Finally, vacation time"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51833"],["title","Meeting of the Minds (#2)"],["body"," synchronized and the expedition got under way.  They had put in three months' work on Vuanu already. Their morale was high, in spite of inevitable conflicts between members. This schooner, bringing in supplies from Sydney and Rabaul, was the last civilized contact they would have for another six months.         *       *       *       *       *  While Sorensen nervously supervised, the crew of the schooner unloaded the cargo. He didn't want any of the equipment, some of it shipped over six thousand miles, to be broken now. No replacements were possible; whatever they didn't have, they would have to do without. He breathed out in relief when the last crate, containing a metals detector, was safely hoisted over the side and put on the beach above the high-water mark.  There was something odd about that box. He examined it and found a quarter-sized hole in one end. It had not been properly sealed.  Dan Drake, the co-manager of the expedition, joined him. \"What's wrong?\" Drake asked.  \"Hole in that crate,\" Sorensen said. \"Salt water might have gotten in. We'll be in tough shape if this detector doesn't work.\"  Drake nodded. \"We better open it and see.\" He was a short, deeply tanned, broad-chested man with close-cropped black hair and a straggly mustache. He wore an old yachting cap jammed down over his eyes, giving his face a tough bulldog look. He pulled a big screwdriver from his belt and inserted it into the crack.  \"Wait a moment,\" Sorensen said. \"Let's get it up to the camp first. Easier to carry the crate than something packed in grease.\"  \"Right,\" Drake said. \"Take the other end.\"  The camp was built in a clearing a hundred yards from the beach, on the site of an abandoned native village. They had been able to re-thatch several huts, and there was an old copra shed with a galvanized iron roof where they stored their supplies. Here they got the benefit of any breeze from the sea. Beyond the clearing, the gray-green jungle sprang up like a solid wall.  Sorensen and Drake set the case down. The skipper, who had accompanied them with the newspapers, looked around at the bleak huts and shook his head.  \"Would you like a drink, Skipper?\" Sorensen asked. \"Afraid we can't offer any ice.\"  \"A drink would be fine,\" the skipper said. He wondered what drove men to a godforsaken place like this in search of imaginary Spanish treasure.  Sorensen went into one of the huts and brought out a bottle of Scotch and a tin cup. Drake had taken out his screwdriver and was vigorously ripping boards off the crate.  \"How does it look?\" Sorensen asked.  \"It's OK,\" Drake said, gently lifting out the metals detector. \"Heavily greased. Doesn't seem like there was any damage--\"  He jumped back. The skipper had come forward and stamped down heavily on the sand.  \"What's the matter?\" Sorensen asked.  \"Looked like a scorpion,\" the skipper said. \"Damned thing crawled right out of your crate there. Might have bit you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sorensen shrugged. He had gotten used to the presence of an infinite number of insects during his three months on Vuanu. Another bug more or less didn't seem to make much difference.  \"Another drink?\" he asked.  \"Can't do it,\" the skipper said regretfully. \"I'd better get started. All your party healthy?\"  \"All healthy so far,\" Sorensen said. He smiled. \"Except for some bad cases of gold fever.\"  \"You'll never find gold in this place,\" the skipper said seriously. \"I'll look in on you in about six months. Good luck.\"  After shaking hands, the skipper went down to the beach and boarded his ship. As the first pink flush of sunset touched the sky, the schooner was under way. Sorensen and Drake watched it negotiate the pass. For a few minutes its masts were visible above the reef. Then they had dipped below the horizon.  \"That's that,\" Drake said. \"Us crazy American treasure-hunters are alone again.\"  \"You don't think he suspected anything?\" Sorensen asked.  \"Definitely not. As far as he's concerned, we're just crackpots.\"  Grinning, they looked back at their camp. Under the copra shed was nearly fifty thousand dollars worth of gold and silver bullion, dug out of the jungle and carefully reburied. They had located a part of the _Santa Teresa_ treasure during their first month on the island. There was every indication of more to come. Since they had no legal title to the land, the expedition was not eager to let the news get out. Once it was known, every gold-hungry vagabond from Perth to Papeete would be heading to Vuanu.  \"The boy'll be in soon,\" Drake said. \"Let's get some stew going.\"  \"Right,\" Sorensen said. He took a few steps and stopped. \"That's funny.\"  \"What is?\"  \"That scorpion the skipper squashed. It's gone.\"  \"Maybe he missed it,\" Drake said. \"Or maybe he just pushed it down into the sand. What difference does it make?\"  \"None, I guess,\" Sorensen said.   II  Edward Eakins walked through the jungle with a long-handled spade on his shoulder, sucking reflectively on a piece of candy. It was the first he'd had in weeks, and he was enjoying it to the utmost. He was in very good spirits. The schooner yesterday had brought in not only machinery and replacement parts, but also candy, cigarettes and food. He had eaten scrambled eggs this morning, and real bacon. The expedition was becoming almost civilized.  Something rustled in the bushes near him. He marched on, ignoring it.  He was a lean, sandy-haired man, amiable and slouching, with pale blue eyes and an unprepossessing manner. He felt very lucky to have been taken on the expedition. His gas station didn't put him on a financial par with the others, and he hadn't been able to put up a full share of the money. He still felt guilty about that. He had been accepted because he was an eager and indefatigable treasure-hunter with a good knowledge of jungle ways. Equally important, he was a skilled radio operator and repairman. He had kept the transmitter on the ketch in working condition in spite of salt water and mildew.  He could pay his full share now, of course. But _now_, when they were practically rich, didn't really count. He wished there were some way he could--  There was that rustle in the bushes again.  Eakins stopped and waited. The bushes trembled. And out stepped a mouse.  Eakins was amazed. The mice on this island, like most wild animal life, were terrified of man. Although they feasted off the refuse of the camp--when the rats didn't get it first--they carefully avoided any contact with humans.  \"You better get yourself home,\" Eakins said to the mouse.  The mouse stared at him. He stared back. It was a pretty little mouse, no more than four or five inches long, and colored a light tawny brown. It didn't seem afraid.  \"So long, mouse,\" Eakins said. \"I got work to do.\" He shifted his spade to the other shoulder and turned to go. As he turned, he caught a flash of brown out of the corner of his eye. Instinctively he ducked. The mouse whirled past him, turned, and gathered itself for another leap.  \"Mouse, are you out of your head?\" Eakins asked.  The mouse bared its tiny teeth and sprang. Eakins knocked it aside.  \"Now get the hell out of here,\" he said. He was beginning to wonder if the rodent was crazy. Did it have rabies, perhaps?  The mouse gathered itself for another charge. Eakins lifted the spade off his shoulders and waited. When the mouse sprang, he met it with a carefully timed blow. Then carefully, regretfully, he battered it to death.  \"Can't have rabid mice running around,\" he said.  But the mouse hadn't seemed rabid; it had just seemed very determined.  Eakins scratched his head. Now what, he wondered, had gotten into that little mouse?  In the camp that evening, Eakins' story was greeted with hoots of laughter. It was just like Eakins to be attacked by a mouse. Several men suggested that he go armed in case the mouse's family wanted revenge. Eakins just smiled sheepishly.         *       *       *       *       *  Two days later, Sorensen and Al Cable were finishing up a morning's hard work at Site 4, two miles from the camp. The metals detector had shown marked activity at this spot. They were seven feet down and nothing had been produced yet except a high mound of yellow-brown earth.  \"That detector must be wrong,\" Cable said, wiping his face wearily. He was a big, pinkish man. He had sweated off twenty pounds on Vuanu, picked up a bad case of prickly heat, and had enough treasure-hunting to last him a lifetime. He wished he were back in Baltimore taking care of his used-car agency. He didn't hesitate to say so, often and loudly. He was one member who had not worked out well.  \"Nothing wrong with the detector,\" Sorensen said. \"Trouble is, we're digging in swampy ground. The cache must have sunk.\"  \"It's probably a hundred feet down,\" Cable said, stabbing angrily at the gluey mud.  \"Nope,\" Sorensen said. \"There's volcanic rock under us, no more than twenty feet down.\"  \"Twenty feet? We should have a bulldozer.\"  \"Might be costly bringing one in,\" Sorensen said mildly. \"Come on, Al, let's get back to camp.\"  Sorensen helped Cable out of the excavation. They cleaned off their tools and started toward the narrow path leading back to the camp. They stopped abruptly.  A large, ugly bird had stepped out of the brush. It was standing on the path, blocking their way.  \"What in hell is that?\" Cable asked.  \"A cassowary,\" Sorensen said.  \"Well, let's boot it out of the way and get going.\"  \"Take it easy,\" Sorensen said. \"If anyone does any booting, it'll be the bird. Back away slowly.\"  The cassowary was nearly five feet high, a black-feathered ostrich-like bird standing erect on powerful legs. Each of its feet was three-toed, and the toes curved into heavy talons. It had a yellowish, bony head and short, useless wings. From its neck hung a brilliant wattle colored red, green, and purple.  \"It is dangerous?\" Cable asked.  Sorensen nodded. \"Natives on New Guinea have been kicked to death by those birds.\"  \"Why haven't"]]]
