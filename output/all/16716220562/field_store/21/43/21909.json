The door of my wife's room burst open and Jimmie appeared with a wild \"What on earth!\"  \"It's that dog, sir,\" gasped Myrtle. \"When I come--came--in with the bowl of water like you said, there he was lying on--on--your bed, like a Human, and--and--\"  \"And what?\" I demanded.  \"And he was wearing your pyjamas, sir,\" she sobbed. \"It's--it's--\"  \"Uncanny,\" Germaine supplied the word.  I gave a hollow laugh. \"He probably remembers that he isn't allowed to lie on the beds, Mary, and may have dragged my pyjamas up there to lie on. Whenever I let him up on the furniture I always make him lie on some of my clothes.\"  \"Oh,\" Myrtle said, suddenly calm. \"Is that it? It was just that it looked sort of queer to see his legs in the pyjama trousers.\"  \"Well, don't worry about it now, Myrtle,\" my wife remarked firmly. \"I'm not surprised it gave you a shock. He's such a big dog. I'll go in and see that he's comfortable. Come on, Winnie! Let's take a look at him. What's the matter?\" she added, noticing a certain reluctance in my attitude.  \"Nothing much,\" I martyrized. \"It's only that he flew for my throat when he got inside the door.\"  \"Nonsense!\" she replied in the firm tone of a woman who knows better and who, in any case, expects her husband not to be afraid of a mere infuriated Great Dane. \"You know Ponto always puts his paws on your shoulders and licks your face every morning, as you taught him.\"  My rollicking laughter was a work of art. \"Of course, that was it,\" I agreed, \"and he'd been away from us so long that he was over-eager. Come on, let's see if we can't make the poor beast comfortable.\"  But I let her lead the way.  The poor beast was lying panting on my still unmade bed. The flowered Chinese silk pyjamas which I had worn at breakfast were indeed strangely twisted around its gaunt body. The coat was across the animal's shoulders and both of its hind-legs were sticking through one of the trouser-legs.  \"There! Ponto! Poor old fellow!\" cooed Jimmie in a voice which would have charmed snails from their shells.  Ponto gave a self-pitying whine and his tail thumped the pillow like an overseer's whip across the back of Uncle Tom. My wife patted the animal's head and Ponto positively drooled at her. She gently disentangled him from among the pyjamas and hung them up in the closet. As she turned toward the bed, he jumped to the floor, reared up, put both paws on her shoulders and licked her face convulsively, giving little whines and shiverings.  \"Poor old fellow, poor old Ponto!\" she crooned. \"Was he glad to get home from the nasty old kennel? There!\" And she massaged his ears. \"Come on now, Ponto,\" she remarked more authoritatively, \"say good morning to your master.\"  The answer was a grand diapason of a growl and the baring of a thicket of gleaming white fangs in my direction.  \"Ponto!\" she ordered, as the beast positively cringed. \"Say good morning to the master!\"  He slumped to the floor with the grace of a pole-axed calf and approached me slowly, ears back, hair bristling and teeth in evidence.  \"Ponto!\" Germaine's cry was positively totalitarian but the dog lunged at me and I barely had time to close the door in its face.  A few minutes later, Germaine emerged looking bewildered. \"I've never known him to behave like this,\" she said. \"I don't like it. It's always been you he was so fond of and he barely tolerated me. Now he seems all mixed-up. After you left, he calmed right down and came back and licked my face all over again. What do you suppose is wrong with him. Can it be fits?\"  I shook my head. \"He doesn't act like fits,\" I said. \"He's had a bad go of distemper and is probably suffering from shock. Dogs do get shock, you know. I remember in Psychology at Harvard they told us about a very intelligent St. Bernard dog which was shocked into complete hysteria by the supernatural. That is, they pulled a lamb chop across the floor by a thread concealed in a crack between the boards. The dog nearly had heart failure when he saw a chop moving by itself.\"  \"But what can we do?\" she asked. \"Let's send him back to the kennels until he's cured.\"  \"Nope! From what Dr. Whatsisname--\"  \"Dalrymple.\"  \"From what Dalrymple said, he'd started acting up at the kennels and he--the vet, that is--thought Ponto would be better off at home.\"  \"But we can't have him going for you every time you use your room.\"  \"Then I won't use it. I'll sleep in the guest-room,\" I added swiftly, lest she leap to feminine conclusions. \"You might take him another bowl of water--he's all right with you--and spread the New York Times on the floor--and a damned good use for it--and bring out my clothes and things. He seems to have quite a leech for you and we'll just leave him there to think things over by himself.\"  \"How about his food?\" she asked. \"Shouldn't he have a special diet?\"  \"No. I'll let him go hungry for a day or so. So long as he has plenty of water it won't hurt him. Then when he's weak enough so as not to be dangerous I'll bring him some nice dog-biscuits and warm milk and he'll learn to love me the best way, by the alimentary canal.\"  She looked at me closely, \"You _do_ look rocky,\" she said. \"You've had a shock, too. Hadn't I better call the doctor?\"  I shook my head. \"No more doctors, please. I'm out of condition, I guess, and all this dodging Great Danes is hard on the nerves. I'll go down and mix myself a brandy-and-soda. You might join me when you've moved my things upstairs. We've got to talk over a lot of things.\"  When I finally managed to settle down in my den with a stiff drink I felt besieged, bewildered and backed up against the wall. There could be no reasonable doubt about it--_the dog knew_! Ponto knew that I was an interloper, that the real Winnie Tompkins no longer existed, that a stranger was masquerading in his body and clothes. The uncanny instinct of a dog had led him to the truth when even Winnie's wife had been deceived.  This was a new twist in the maze. I couldn't imagine the Master of the Rat-Race watching with scientific detachment to see whether Frank Jacklin would make it or would be disqualified in the first round. Of one thing I was certain, unless I could establish some kind of personal understanding with Ponto, suspicion would gather around me. For the moment, Germaine did not doubt that I was her husband: my conduct had puzzled her but she had lived with Winnie so long that it was probable that she no longer specifically noticed him. Virginia Rutherford would be more dangerous--she was a woman scorned and she had been tricked out of an intrigue. She had every motive for digging out or even for inventing the truth, but I had given myself a good excuse to keep her at arm's length. She couldn't force her way into my clubs. I would tell my office staff to keep her away from me, and she couldn't be so ill-bred as to thrust herself into my home. If I could appease Ponto and avoid Virginia, I had a fair chance of getting away with it.  \"Beg pardon, sir!\" It was Myrtle.  \"Yes, Mary?\"  \"Mrs. Rutherford is back, sir. She wants to see you.\"  \"Tell her I am not at home,\" I replied in a clear carrying tone. \"And that I never will be at home to her.\"  \"Oh, yes, you will.\" It was the red-head. She was wearing a long mink coat and carrying a short automatic pistol. \"Like it or not, Winnie, _we_ are going to have a talk--now.\" She turned to the startled maid. \"And don't you try phoning the police, Myrtle,\" she added, \"or the first thing you will hear is this pistol going pop at Mr. Winfred Tompkins of New York City and Bedford Hills.\"  \"That's all right, Mary,\" I added. \"Don't call the police. Tell Mrs. Tompkins that I'm busy. Mrs. Rutherford and I wish to have a conversation.\"     CHAPTER 5   As the door to the room slammed convulsively behind Myrtle, Mrs. Rutherford relaxed, laid the automatic on the sofa between us, and flung back her mink coat. She was an appetizing little number, if you like 'em red-haired, well-developed and mad through and through.  Instinctively I started to reach for the gun but was checked by her laugh.  \"Take it, by all means,\" she said. \"It's not loaded. I only needed it for the maid. Tell me, Winnie, have you got her on your string, too? The maid made or undone, as they used to say.\"  \"Virginia,\" I said firmly, \"I told you earlier this morning that we were through. There's nothing more to be said about it. It's finished, done, kaput! All's well that ends.\"  She laughed again, and looked at me closely. In spite of myself, I began pulling nervously at the lobe of my left ear, a habit of mine when confused which has always irritated my Dorothy.  \"There!\" Virginia said finally, \"that's it!\"  Her voice had a note of finality with a touch of total triumph that I found disturbing.  \"Well, have you anything to say?\" I asked.  \"Have _you_ anything to say?\"  \"I've already said it, Virginia. Nice as you are and beautiful as you are, we're washed up. It won't work and we both know it. So why not shake hands and quit friends?\"  She took my proffered hand in hers but, instead of shaking it, examined it carefully.  \"Very clever,\" she murmured. \"You've even got that little mole at the base of your thumb.\"  \"Of course I have. It's been there since birth.\"  \"Very, _very_, clever, Winnie,\" she continued, \"but it won't do, my Winnie, because you see you aren't my Winnie at all. You're a total stranger.\"  \"I've changed,\" I admitted. \"I'm trying to be half-way decent.\"  \"Whoever wanted Winnie to be half-way decent?\" she mused. \"Nobody. He was much pleasanter as he was--a rich, friendly boob. As for you, whoever you are, I'm on to your game. You aren't Winfred Tompkins and you know it.\"  I put some heavy sarcasm into my reply. \"How did you ever guess, Mrs. Rutherford?\"  She laughed airily, helped herself to a cigarette and leaned forward while I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],["title","The Rat Race (#6)"],["body"," it so that I could not help seeing deep into the straining V of her blouse.  \"Lots of things. In the first place, you call me 'Virginia' when we're alone instead of 'Bozo' as you always used to do.\"  \"I stopped calling you 'Bozo' when I made up my mind--\" I began.  \"Nuts to you, Buddy,\" she rejoined. \"Then you kept pulling at your ear as though you were milking a cow, while I was needling you. Winnie never did that. When he was in a spot, he always reached in his pocket and jingled his change or, as a desperate measure, twiddled his keys.\"  \"Don't judge my habits by my hang-overs,\" I insisted. \"I'm not feeling well and I've had a sort of psychic shock.\"  \"Winnie never said 'psychic' in his life, poor lamb,\" she observed. \"He didn't know what it meant. No, I don't know what your game is but I'm on to you and we're going to be real buddies from now on or--\"  \"Or what?\"  \"The police,\" she observed quietly, \"take a dim view of murder in this state. Now I'm willing to be broad-minded. Winnie was a louse who had it coming to him, I guess. I was playing him for a quick divorce and marriage. Three million dollars is a lot of money, even in these days, and it would have been nice to have been married to it. But it's even nicer this way, I guess.\"  The decanter was within reach. I poured myself another drink. \"Have some?\" I asked.  \"And why not? What's yours is mine, and we both need it.\"  \"Why did you say it was nicer this way, Mrs. Rutherford?\" I inquired.  \"Virginia to you, Winnie. It's because now I don't have to marry you and I still have a pipe-line to the Tompkins millions.\"  \"So you _are_ going in for blackmail,\" I observed. \"Suppose I threatened to divorce Jimmie and marry you. After all, I still could.\"  \"A girl has her pride,\" she murmured. \"Not that I'd mind having fun with you, Winnie--as I think I'd better call you. But a wife can't give testimony against her husband and I think I'd rather like to be able to give testimony if needed. Besides, a husband has too many opportunities to help the undertaker. There are accidents in bath-tubs and garages, medicines get mixed up in the bathroom cabinet and there is always the old-fashioned hatchet. No, since you've managed to get rid of the other Winnie, somehow, I think I'll keep a safe distance and my silence, as long as you make it worth my while.\"  \"Suppose I won't play?\" I suggested.  \"Then I'll go to the police or the F.B.I.--they're supposed to catch kidnappers, aren't they?--and tell them what I know.\"  I stood up. This would be easier than I had expected.  \"Okay, Virginia,\" I said, \"go right ahead. There's the telephone. You can use it to call the Secret Service for all I care. See what luck you have with your story, when my wife is here to testify that I'm Winnie Tompkins.\"  Her face paled and her eyes narrowed angrily. \"Jimmie too?\" she asked. \"Then you're both in it!\"  \"We're both in what?\"  The door opened and Germaine Tompkins stood in the entrance.  Virginia Rutherford looked trapped and she instinctively pulled her mink back over her shoulders.  \"Nothing, Jimmie,\" she said at last. \"I was foolish enough to hope that if I came back and had a talk alone with Winnie, we could pick up where we left off. He's been acting so strangely that he doesn't seem like himself at all. And so are you. That's what I meant by saying that you were both in it.\"  \"Virginia,\" my wife said firmly, \"my husband told you to stay out of this house--and it's my home, too--and now I find you here. Please go or I'll call the police.\"  The two women exchanged appraising glances which suggested that they were both thoroughly enjoying the touch of melodrama that had come into their well-fed lives.  \"No, it's my fault for letting her in,\" I said. \"She sent in word by Mary--\"  \"You mean Myrtle.\"  \"--that she would like to see me. I agreed to do so, so you can't blame her. We talked things over and decided that it's all off--a few moments of madness, but that's all, and not worth wrecking two marriages for. Isn't that so, Mrs. Rutherford?\"  Virginia shook her head. \"No, Winnie, it is not so. Jimmie, I came here with that gun. It wasn't loaded but the next time it will be. I made Myrtle or whatever her name is show me in and I told her I would shoot Winnie if she gave the alarm. Then I told him what I know about him.\"  \"And what is that?\" my wife asked.  \"That he is not Winnie at all,\" Virginia declared. \"That he is an imposter, that he and perhaps you had done away with poor old Winnie. I told him that I wouldn't tell his secret if he paid me to keep silent. And he told me to call the police.\"  My wife went over to her and took her hand. \"Poor, darling Virginia,\" she murmured, \"why don't you go away and have a good rest? You've got yourself all worked up for a nervous breakdown. Of course it's Winnie. I'm married to him and I ought to know my own husband, shouldn't I? You've simply got run down and all, with rationing and war-work. Why don't you let Jerry send you for a few weeks to the Hartford Sanctuary for psychoanalysis and a good rest?\"  Virginia dashed my wife's hand away. \"In other words, you think I'm crazy!\" she snapped.  \"No, but I do think you're hysterical. This is Winnie, I'm Jimmie and you're Virginia Rutherford. We've all been letting ourselves get over-emotional and this war is a strain on everybody. Don't worry. Jerry can fix it for you quite easily and I--we both will be glad to help pay for it, if you're worried about the money. After all,\" Germaine added wryly, \"the whole thing is pretty much of a family affair, isn't it? Let's keep it that way.\"  Mrs. Rutherford reached over and grabbed the gun from the sofa.  \"All right, Germaine Tompkins, murderess,\" she grated. \"If that's the way you're going to play it, I'll play too. Don't worry about my mind. Start thinking about the electric chair. Remember, in this state they execute women who kill their husbands.\"  Jimmie waited until the door closed behind the doctor's wife. Then she turned to me with a curious expression of weariness.  \"Poor man!\" she remarked. \"You have got yourself into a bad mess, haven't you?\"  I nodded.  \"It didn't seem like one while I was getting into it,\" I said. \"It's only now when I'm trying to get things straightened out that it seems so awful.\"  \"Let's see,\" she continued. \"How many women is it you've been trying to keep away from each other? There's myself, of course, but wives don't count any more, do they? And there's Virginia Rutherford and Myrtle, and there was that blonde actress we met at Martha's Vineyard last summer, and is it one or two girls at the office?\"  Here was where I could object with complete sincerity. \"I swear that I've not been fooling with any of the office girls,\" I said.  \"I know,\" Jimmie agreed wisely. \"You always used to tell me that it was considered bad for business to play with the help but after I saw the way you went for Myrtle I decided that there were exceptions to every rule.\"  \"Nobody in the office,\" I repeated. \"I swear it.\"  \"Then perhaps it was the office next door. Maybe you brokers have an exchange system for taking on each other's stenographers--charge it to business expenses for getting information about each other's dealings--but I know I've heard the name Briggs mentioned somehow in your connection.\"  \"The name means absolutely nothing to me,\" I insisted. \"If it will make you any happier I'll admit to a hundred women but I'm through with all that sex-stuff. From now on, I'm going to be a one-woman man.\"  Germaine faced me with an air of resolution. \"Would you mind giving me a drink of brandy?\" she asked. \"I've something to say to you and I'm afraid you won't like it.\"  I went to the portable bar and poured her a pony of Courvoisier.  \"Here you are. Down the hatch! And now what is it you want to tell me.\"  \"Believe me, Winnie,\" she said, \"it's not easy for me. But I'd better say it anyhow. I can't keep on suppressing it. Who _are_ you?\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Who _are_ you?\" she repeated. \"You look like my husband but you don't talk like him. His clothes fit you but Virginia Rutherford is _quite_ right--you aren't Winnie Tompkins.\"  \"How did you guess?\"  \"Don't think I'll give you away,\" she continued. \"I won't because you must have had a terribly important reason for doing whatever you have done. You seem to be in deep trouble of some kind. I--I'd like to help you, if I can. Don't think I'm hard on my husband. It's been years since we--oh, you know. I married him for his money and I still don't know why he married me. Yes, I do, but I've never liked to admit it. He'd made a lot of money in the market and had built this house. He needed a wife the way he needed an automobile, a portable bar, a Capehart, a thoroughbred Great Dane and a membership in the Pond Club. I was available, at a price, which he met--but that's all there is to our story.\"  \"Poor Jimmie!\" I sympathized. \"We're both lost, I guess. No, I'm not Winnie but I don't know who else I could possibly be. You see, less than twenty-four hours ago I was a lieutenant-commander on a light carrier in the North Pacific and--\"  Germaine slowly withdrew her hand from mine.  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed softly. \"Oh Winnie! Poor old idiot! I'll take care of you and see that you get over this. Wait, I'll call the doctor right away. The Hartford Sanctuary's a very nice place, and I can come over every week to--\"  I shook my head. \"You'll do nothing of the kind, my dear,\" I ordered. \"No doctor can help me on this one. Besides,\" I added, \"how do you know that I wasn't batty before and have just come to my senses.\"  Her eyes were frightened. \"All right, dear,\" she agreed. \"I like you better this way, anyhow.\"     CHAPTER 6   \"Thanks, Jimmie,\" I replied. \"I'm going to try to stay this way.\"  My wife sat down beside me and studied me closely. \"You _look_ different,\" she remarked. \"To me, at any rate. You're sort of coming to a focus. If only--. You're so different and--strange.\"  Here was my chance to recover lost"]]]
