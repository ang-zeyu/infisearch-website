As I said in the ad--this is an unusual adventure. It may--probably will--involve infringing various statutes and regulations of one sort or another. After you know the full story I'll leave you to judge whether it's justifiable.\"  If Foster was trying to arouse my curiosity, he was succeeding. He was dead serious about whatever it was he was planning. It sounded like something no one with good sense would want to get involved in--but on the other hand, Foster didn't look like the sort of man to do anything foolish....  \"Why don't you tell me what this is all about?\" I said. \"Why would a man with all this--\" I waved a hand at the luxurious room--\"want to pick a hobo like me out of the gutter and talk him into taking a job?\"  \"Your ego has taken a severe beating, Legion--that's obvious. I think you're afraid that I'll expect too much of you--or that I'll be shocked by some disclosure you may make. Perhaps if you'd forget yourself and your problems for the moment, we could reach an understanding----\"  \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Just forget my problems....\"  \"Chiefly money problems, of course. Most of the problems of this society involve the abstraction of values that money represents.\"  \"Okay,\" I said. \"I've got my problems, you've got yours. Let's leave it at that.\"  \"You feel that because I have material comfort, my problems must of necessity be trivial ones,\" Foster said. \"Tell me, Mr. Legion: have you ever known a man who suffered from amnesia?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Foster crossed the room to a small writing desk, took something from a drawer, then looked at me.  \"I'd like you to examine this,\" he said.  I went over and took the object from his hand. It was a small book, with a cover of drab-colored plastic, unornamented except for an embossed design of two concentric rings. I opened the cover. The pages were as thin as tissue, but opaque, and covered with extremely fine writing in strange foreign characters. The last dozen pages were in English. I had to hold the book close to my eyes to read the minute script:  _January 19, 1710. Having come nigh to calamity with the near lofs[1] of the key, I will henceforth keep this journal in the English tongue...._  [Footnote 1: Transcriber's Note: Sections of this text used \"long s\" typeface. Text left as printed with the letter \"f\" substituted for the \"long s\".]  \"If this is an explanation of something, it's too subtle for me,\" I said.  \"Legion, how old would you say I am?\"  \"That's a hard one,\" I said. \"When I first saw you I would have said the late thirties, maybe. Now, frankly, you look closer to fifty.\"  \"I can show you proof,\" Foster said, \"that I spent the better part of a year in a military hospital in France. I awakened in a ward, bandaged to the eyes, and with no memories whatever of my life before that day. According to the records made at the time, I appeared to be about thirty years of age.\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"amnesia's not so unusual among war casualties, and you seem to have done pretty well since.\"  Foster shook his head impatiently. \"There's nothing difficult about acquiring material wealth in this society, though the effort kept me well occupied for a number of years--and diverted my thoughts from the question of my past life. The time came, however, when I had the leisure to pursue the matter. The clues I had were meagre enough; the notebook I've shown you was found near me, and I had a ring on my finger.\" Foster held out his hand. On the middle finger was a massive signet, engraved with the same design of concentric circles I had seen on the cover of the notebook.  \"I was badly burned; my clothing was charred. Oddly enough, the notebook was quite unharmed, though it was found among burned debris. It's made of very tough stuff.\"  \"What did you find out?\"  \"In a word--nothing. No military unit claimed me. I spoke English, from which it was deduced that I was English or American----\"  \"They couldn't tell which, from your accent?\"  \"Apparently not; it appears I spoke a sort of hybrid dialect.\"  \"Maybe you're lucky. I'd be happy to forget my first thirty years.\"  \"I spent a considerable sum of money in my attempts to discover my past,\" Foster went on. \"And several years of time. In the end I gave it up. And it wasn't until then that I found the first faint inkling.\"  \"So you did find something,\" I said.  \"Nothing I hadn't had all along. The notebook.\"  \"I'd have thought you would have read that before you did anything else,\" I said. \"Don't tell me you put it in the bureau drawer and forgot it.\"  \"I read it, of course--what I could read of it. Only a relatively small section is in English. The rest is a cipher. And what I read seemed meaningless--quite unrelated to me. You've glanced through it; it's no more than a journal, irregularly kept, and so cryptic as to be little better than a code itself. And of course the dates; they range from the early eighteenth century through the early twentieth.\"  \"A sort of family record, maybe,\" I said. \"Carried on generation after generation. Didn't it mention any names, or places?\"  \"Look at it again, Legion,\" Foster said. \"See if you notice anything odd--other than what we've already discussed.\"  I thumbed through the book again. It was no more than an inch thick, but it was heavy--surprisingly heavy. There were a lot of pages--I shuffled through hundreds of closely written sheets, and yet the book was less than half used. I read bits here and there:  _\"May 4, 1746. The Voyage was not a Succefs. I must forsake this avenue of Enquiry...._\"  \"_October 23, 1790. Builded the weft Barrier a cubit higher. Now the fires burn every night. Is there no limit to their infernal perfiftence?_\"  \"_January 19, 1831. I have great hopes for the Philadelphia enterprise. My greatest foe is impatience. All preparations for the Change are made, yet I confefs I am uneasy...._\"  \"There are plenty of oddities,\" I said. \"Aside from the entries themselves. This is supposed to be old--but the quality of the paper and binding beats anything I've seen. And that handwriting is pretty fancy for a quill pen----\"  \"There's a stylus clipped to the spine of the book,\" Foster said. \"It was written with that.\"  I looked, pulled out a slim pen, then looked at Foster. \"Speaking of odd,\" I said. \"A genuine antique early colonial ball-point pen doesn't turn up every day----\"  \"Suspend your judgement until you've seen it all,\" Foster said.  \"And two hundred years on one refill--that's not bad.\" I riffled through the pages, then I tossed the book onto the table. \"Who's kidding who, Foster?\" I said.  \"The book was described in detail in the official record, of which I have copies. They mention the paper and binding, the stylus, even quote some of the entries. The authorities worked over it pretty closely, trying to identify me. They reached the same conclusion as you--that it was the work of a crackpot; but they saw the same book you're looking at now.\"  \"So what? So it was faked up some time during the war--what does that prove? I'm ready to concede it's forty years old----\"  \"You don't understand, Legion,\" Foster said. \"I told you I woke up in a military hospital in France. But it was an AEF hospital and the year was 1918.\"     CHAPTER II   I glanced sideways at Foster. He didn't look like a nut....  \"All I've got to say is,\" I said, \"you're a hell of a spry-looking ninety.\"  \"You find my appearance strangely youthful. What would be your reaction if I told you that I've aged greatly in the past few months? That a year ago I could have passed as no older than thirty without the slightest difficulty----\"  \"I don't think I'd believe you,\" I said. \"And I'm sorry, Mr. Foster; but I don't believe the bit about the 1918 hospital either. How can I? It's----\"  \"I know. Fantastic. But let's go back a moment to the book itself. Look closely at the paper; it's been examined by experts. They're baffled by it. Attempts to analyze it chemically failed--they were unable to take a sample. It's impervious to solvents----\"  \"They couldn't get a sample?\" I said. \"Why not just tear off the corner of one of the sheets?\"  \"Try it,\" Foster said.  I picked up the book and plucked at the edge of one of the blank sheets, then pinched harder and pulled. The paper held. I got a better grip and pulled again. It was like fine, tough leather, except that it didn't even stretch.  \"It's tough, all right,\" I said. I took out my pocket knife and opened it and worked on the edge of the paper. Nothing. I went over to the bureau and put the paper flat against the top and sawed at it, putting my weight on the knife. I raised the knife and brought it down hard. I didn't so much as mark the sheet. I put the knife away.  \"That's some paper, Mr. Foster,\" I said.  \"Try to tear the binding,\" Foster said. \"Put a match to it. Shoot at it if you like. Nothing will make an impression on that material. Now, you're a logical man, Legion. Is there something here outside ordinary experience or is there not?\"  I sat down, feeling for a cigarette. I still didn't have.  \"What does it prove?\" I said.  \"Only that the book is not a simple fraud. You're facing something which can't be dismissed as fancy. The book exists. That is our basic point of departure.\"  \"Where do we go from there?\"  \"There is a second factor to be considered,\" Foster went on. \"At some time in the past I seem to have made an enemy. Someone, or something, is systematically hunting me.\"  I tried a laugh, but it felt out of place. \"Why not sit still and let it catch up with you? Maybe it could tell you what the whole thing is about.\"  Foster shook his head. \"It started almost thirty years ago,\" he said. \"I was driving south from Albany, New York, at night. It was a long straight stretch of road, no houses. I noticed lights following me. Not headlights--something that bobbed along, off in the fields along the road. But "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51712"],["title","A Trace of Memory (#3)"],["body","kept pace, gradually moving alongside. Then they closed in ahead, keeping out of range of my headlights. I stopped the car. I wasn't seriously alarmed, just curious. I wanted a better look, so I switched on my spotlight and played it on the lights. They disappeared as the light touched them. After half a dozen were gone, the rest began closing in. I kept picking them off. There was a sound, too, a sort of high-pitched humming. I caught a whiff of sulphur then, and suddenly I was afraid--deathly afraid. I caught the last one in the beam no more than ten feet from the car. I can't describe the horror of the moment----\"  \"It sounds pretty weird,\" I said. \"But what was there to be afraid of? It must have been some kind of heat lightning.\"  \"There is always the pat explanation,\" Foster said. \"But no explanation can rationalize the instinctive dread I felt. I started up the car and drove on--right through the night and the next day. I sensed that I must put distance between myself and whatever it was I had met. I bought a home in California and tried to put the incident out of my mind--with limited success. Then it happened again.\"  \"The same thing? Lights?\"  \"It was more sophisticated the next time. It started with interference--static--on my radio. Then it affected the wiring in the house. All the lights began to glow weakly, even though they were switched off. I could feel it--feel it in my bones--moving closer, hemming me in. I tried the car; it wouldn't start. Fortunately, I kept a few horses at that time. I mounted and rode into town--and at a fair gallop, you may be sure. I saw the lights, but outdistanced them. I caught a train and kept going.\"  \"I don't see----\"  \"It happened again; four times in all. I thought perhaps I had succeeded in eluding it at last. I was mistaken. I have had definite indications that my time here is drawing to a close. I would have been gone before now, but there were certain arrangements to be made.\"  \"Look,\" I said. \"This is all wrong. You need a psychiatrist, not an ex-tough guy. Delusions of persecution----\"  \"It seemed obvious that the explanation was to be found somewhere in my past life,\" Foster went on. \"I turned to the notebook, my only link. I copied it out, including the encrypted portion. I had photostatic enlargements made of the initial section--the part written in unfamiliar characters. None of the experts who have examined the script have been able to identify it.  \"I necessarily, therefore, concentrated my attention on the last section--the only part written in English. I was immediately struck by a curious fact I had ignored before. The writer made references to an Enemy, a mysterious 'they', against which defensive measures had to be taken.\"  \"Maybe that's where you got the idea,\" I said. \"When you first read the book----\"  \"The writer of the log,\" Foster said, \"was dogged by the same nemesis that now follows me.\"  \"It doesn't make any sense,\" I said.  \"For the moment,\" Foster said, \"stop looking for logic in the situation. Look for a pattern instead.\"  \"There's a pattern, all right,\" I said.  \"The next thing that struck me,\" Foster went on, \"was a reference to a loss of memory--a second point of some familiarity to me. The writer expresses frustration at the inability to remember certain facts which would have been useful to him in his pursuit.\"  \"What kind of pursuit?\"  \"Some sort of scientific project, as nearly as I can gather. The journal bristles with tantalizing references to matters that are never explained.\"  \"And you think the man that wrote it had amnesia?\"  \"Not exactly amnesia, perhaps,\" Foster said. \"But there were things he was unable to remember.\"  \"If that's amnesia, we've all got it,\" I said. \"Nobody's got a perfect memory.\"  \"But these were matters of importance; not the kinds of thing that simply slip one's mind.\"  \"I can see how you'd want to believe the book had something to do with your past, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"It must be a hard thing, not knowing your own life story. But you're on the wrong track. Maybe the book is a story you started to write--in code, so nobody would accidentally read the stuff and kid you about it.\"  \"Legion, what was it you planned to do when you got to Miami?\"  The question caught me a little off-guard. \"Well, I don't know,\" I hedged. \"I wanted to get south, where it's warm. I used to know a few people----\"  \"In other words, nothing,\" Foster said. \"Legion, I'll pay you well to stay with me and see this thing through.\"  I shook my head. \"Not me, Mr. Foster. The whole thing sounds--well, the kindest word I can think of is 'nutty.'\"  \"Legion,\" Foster said, \"do you really believe I'm insane?\"  \"Let's just say this all seems a little screwy to me, Mr. Foster.\"  \"I'm not asking you just to work for me,\" Foster said. \"I'm asking for your help.\"  \"You might as well look for your fortune in tea leaves,\" I said, irritated. \"There's nothing in what you've told me.\"  \"There's more, Legion. Much more. I've recently made an important discovery. When I know you're with me, I'll tell you. You know enough now to accept the fact that this isn't entirely a figment of my imagination.\"  \"I don't know anything,\" I said. \"So far it's all talk.\"  \"If you're concerned about payment----\"  \"No, damn it,\" I barked. \"Where are the papers you keep talking about? I ought to have my head examined for sitting here humoring you. I've got troubles enough----\" I stopped talking and rubbed my hands over my scalp. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"I guess what's really griping me is that you've got everything I think I want--and you're not content with it. It bothers me to see you off chasing fairies. If a man with his health and plenty of money can't enjoy life, what the hell is there for anybody?\"  Foster looked at me thoughtfully. \"Legion, if you could have anything in life you wanted, what would you ask for?\"  \"Anything? I've wanted a lot of different things. Once I wanted to be a hero. Later, I wanted to be smart, know all the answers. Then I had the idea that a chance to do an honest job, one that needed doing, was the big thing. I never found that job. I never got smart either, or figured out how to tell a hero from a coward, without a program.\"  \"In other words,\" Foster said, \"you were looking for an abstraction to believe in--in this case, Justice. But you won't find justice in nature. It's a thing that only man expects or acknowledges.\"  \"There are some good things in life; I'd like to get a piece of them.\"  \"Don't lose your capacity for dreaming, in the process.\"  \"Dreams?\" I said. \"Oh, I've got those. I want an island somewhere in the sun, where I can spend my time fishing and watching the sea.\"  \"You're speaking cynically--but you're still attempting to concretize an abstraction,\" Foster said. \"But no matter--materialism is simply another form of idealism.\"  I looked at Foster. \"But I know I'll never have those things--or that Justice you were talking about, either. Once you really know you'll never make it....\"  \"Perhaps unattainability is an essential element of any dream,\" Foster said. \"But hold onto your dream, whatever it is--don't ever give it up.\"  \"So much for philosophy,\" I said. \"Where is it getting us?\"  \"You'd like to see the papers,\" Foster said. He fished a key ring from an inner pocket. \"If you don't mind going out to the car,\" he said, \"and perhaps getting your hands dirty, there's a strong-box welded to the frame. I keep photostats of everything there, along with my passport, emergency funds and so on. I've learned to be ready to travel on very short notice. Lift the floorboards; you'll see the box.\"  \"It's not all that urgent,\" I said. \"I'll take a look in the morning--after I've caught up on some sleep. But don't get the wrong idea--it's just my knot-headed curiosity.\"  \"Very well,\" Foster said. He lay back, sighed. \"I'm tired, Legion,\" he said. \"My mind is tired.\"  \"Yeah,\" I said, \"so is mine--not to mention other portions of my anatomy.\"  \"Get some sleep,\" Foster said. \"We'll talk again in the morning.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I pushed back the light blanket and slid out of bed. Underfoot, the rug was as thick and soft as a working girl's mink. I went across to the closet and pushed the button that made the door slide aside. My old clothes were still lying on the floor where I had left them, but I had the clean ones Foster had lent me. He wouldn't mind if I borrowed them for a while longer--it would be cheaper for him in the long run. Foster was as looney as a six-day bike racer, but there was no point in my waiting around to tell him so.  The borrowed outfit didn't include a coat. I thought of putting my old jacket on but it was warm outside and a grey pin-stripe with grease spots wouldn't help the picture any. I transferred my personal belongings from the grimy clothes on the floor, and eased the door open.  Downstairs, the curtains were drawn in the living room. I could vaguely make out the outline of the bar. It wouldn't hurt to take along a bite to eat. I groped my way behind the bar, felt along the shelves, found a stack of small cans that rattled softly. Nuts, probably. I reached to put a can on the bar and it clattered against something I couldn't see. I swore silently, felt over the obstruction. It was bulky, with the cold smoothness of metal, and there were small projections with sharp corners. It felt for all the world like----  I leaned over it and squinted. With the faint gleam of moonlight from a chink in the heavy curtains falling just so, I could almost make out the shape; I crouched a little lower, and caught the glint of light along the perforated jacket of a .30 calibre machine gun. My eye followed the barrel, made out the darker square of the entrance hall, and the tiny reflection of light off the polished brass doorknob at the far end.  I stepped back, flattened against the wall, with a hollow feeling inside. If I had tried to walk through that door....  Foster was crazy"]]]
