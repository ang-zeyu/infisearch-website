All we ask is that you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to make profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the Galaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out the full program takes time.\"  He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our extremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise, but sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the motto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\"         *       *       *       *       *  The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it was no more than fair to pay transportation.  He said, \"How much does the freight cost?\"  Broderick told him.  \"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is sixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the merchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering the cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\"  \"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together have so much money any more.\"  \"You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you credit!\"  \"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically.  \"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the rich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the involutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that might have had a discouraging effect.  On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting. Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do to get credit?\"  \"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our Easy Payment Plan.\"  Zotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for myself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\"  \"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each of your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is all there is to it.\"  It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul wrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.  \"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will have the figures.\"  The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul pointed this out politely.  \"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all, you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be paid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight. This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\"  \"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our plant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.\"  \"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You will start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain parts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local manufacture to help bring prices down.\"  \"We haven't the equipment.\"  \"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only a quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial company.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Zotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman, won over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter interest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth. These, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.  The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the Earthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.  For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the new concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a terrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from the crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit. The food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges, served up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the winter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though they had gas-fired central heating.  About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric generators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of electrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason, batteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to buy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?  The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan. They had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric fans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could possibly sell them.  \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but meantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\"  But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option. The Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The Earthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because it was so much more efficient--and to lower prices, which was Earth's unswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded. Broderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.  The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets were delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and maintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth had them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth, but to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.  The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush business.         *       *       *       *       *  For the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade and a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this backward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was slow, but it was extremely sure.  The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less money and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television kept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the pangs of impoverishment.  The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul designed and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons were a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold them for less.  The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any more, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.  \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with fists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some contracts to continue operating.\"  Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr. Broderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him. Would he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.  Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint of toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.  \"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He looked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of making it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"  \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul.  \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything attached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are attached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that--yet. We will only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your pottery to us.\"  The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of beating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was somewhat comforted.  \"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the governor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of Masur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is time for the government to do something for us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of confusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men covetous and Zurian women envious.  \"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting you.\"  \"Me?\" marveled Zotul.  She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor of Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a friendly smile.  \"Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.\"  Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick, the Earthman.  \"I--I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion.  Broderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted with your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\"  \"I don't understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are about to lose our plant.\"  \"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away from you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and richest on Zur, it has taken a long time--the longest of all, in fact.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have bought you out.\"  \"Our government....\"  \"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could not pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took them over, just as we are taking you over.\"  \"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything on Zur?\"  \"Even your armies.\"  \"But _why_?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Broderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared down moodily into the street.  \"You don't know what an overcrowded world is like,\" he said. \"A street like this, with so few people and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51129"],["title","A Gift from Earth (#3)"],["body","on it, would be impossible on Earth.\"  \"But it's mobbed,\" protested Zotul. \"It gave me a headache.\"  \"And to us it's almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth has made us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only habitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least populous worlds and--well, buy them out and move in.\"  \"And after that?\"  Broderick smiled gently. \"Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry with yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians nor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.\"  Zotul sat in silent thought. \"But you did not have to buy us out. You had the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could have been yours alone.\" He stopped in alarm. \"Or am I suggesting an idea that didn't occur to you?\"  \"No,\" said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with memory. \"We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method causes more distress than we like to inflict, but it's better--and more sure--than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is finished, we can repair the dislocations.\"  \"At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.\"  \"Slow but sure.\" Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the shoulder. \"Don't worry. You'll have your job back, the same as always, but you'll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur are equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That's why we had to break down your caste system.\"  Zotul's eyes widened. \"And that is why my brothers did not beat me when I failed!\"  \"Of course. Are you ready now to take the assignment papers for you and your brothers to sign?\"  \"Yes,\" said Zotul. \"I am ready.\""]]]
